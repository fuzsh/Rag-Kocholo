Non-diet soft drinks, energy or sports drinks, fancy coffees, and other beverages sweetened with sugar can mean extra pounds over time. In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says people consume about 400 calories per day in beverages. So today, try drinking only water, both with and between meals.\n\nSticking with zero-calorie water is an easy way to cut calories and get a jump on your weight-management goals. Plus, water is usually an inexpensive option. Drink water from the tap at home—it’s the cheapest way to stay hydrated. When you’re headed out and about, fill a water bottle and toss it into your bag or backpack. You can refill it throughout the day. Bonus: You’ll help the environment by reducing waste.\n\nArticle from the StayWell Company, LLC\n\nHave you ever felt overwhelmed by your stuff? Maybe your kitchen cupboards are packed with unused gadgets and servingware (how did you end up with two blenders?). Or maybe it’s your closet that’s the problem—it’s so stuffed with clothes, shoes, and other belongings that it’s hard to find what you’re looking for.\n\nMost of us have far more possessions than we need or even want. Why not cut back on the clutter and choose three things from your home to donate or throw away? If the item may be useful to someone else, set it aside for a charity or resale shop. If it’s broken or useless, throw it out. Getting rid of even a few items can reduce clutter, help you get organized, and help you feel more in control of your environment—and your life!\n\nArticle from the StayWell Company, LLC\n\nAlso, don’t forget about the Campus Cupboard in Rose Hall, room 140: https://www.uwgb.edu/cupboard/\n\nThe Wellness Committee recognizes how crucial eating well is to staying healthy. Countless studies show the value of increasing our vegetable and fruit intake, including increased energy and reduced risk for certain diseases and types of cancers. Set a goal for yourself to eat more vegetables and fruits – take good care of your body and you will feel the positive results!\n\nGarden to Doorstep Organics, LLC is a local family business that delivers fresh organic fruits and veggies each week. They will be on campus on Thursday, May 17th at 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at a table in the Union near the entrance to the Leona Cloud Commons across from the Phoenix Bookstore.

Please stop by and be entered in a drawing for a free box of produce!\n\nHere are some details:\n\nEach week there is a different variety of 100% organic produce\n\nTwo types of boxes available (Fruit/Veggie Combo boxes or Fruit only boxes)\n\nThree sizes of each type of box available (you pick the size that best fits your family)\n\nEach week you will know which produce is planned for your box.
