        "text": "Dolace McLean comes to Quinnipiac from the Office of the Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, where she served as General Counsel. She had previously founded and served as CEO of a specialty law practice with a focus on appellate litigation. She has also taught as an assistant professor of English at the University of the Virgin Islands, where she produced book reviews, interviews and articles dealing with law and Caribbean literature.\n\nMcLean was a member of the Task Force on the U.S. Territories, a joint effort by the New York State and Virgin Islands Bar Associations seeking equal treatment for citizens living in American territories. She is legal adviser to Healing Hands Worldwide Foundation, Inc., a non-profit dedicated to providing educational and medical help to persons in the Caribbean and Africa.\n\nMcLean holds a JD from Cornell University Law School and a Ph.D. in English from New York University. Her research and teaching interests include property, administrative law, and the law of American national identity. Her recent article, \"Cultural Identity & Territorial Autonomy: US Virgin Islands Jurisprudence and the Insular Cases,\" is forthcoming in the Fordham Law Review.\n\nWayne Unger is currently a visiting assistant professor of law and fellow with the Center for Law, Ethics and Commerce at Gonzaga University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law, First Amendment, and data privacy and security law.\n\nUnger’s research and writing focus on the intersection of constitutional law, emerging technologies and civil rights. He looks at the erosion of civil rights, liberties and democracy as technology advances. His scholarship has appeared in Columbia’s Science & Technology Law Review, the Richmond Journal of Law & Technology and the Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal. Forthcoming works will appear in the Washington & Lee Law Review and the UC Law SF Constitutional Law Quarterly. Prior to entering academia, Professor Unger started his own law firm in Arizona where he practiced business law and civil litigation.\n\nBefore law school, Unger worked in Silicon Valley in various roles, including managing multimillion-dollar corporate transformation initiatives for Cisco Systems. He holds a JD and a Bachelor of Science from Arizona State University.\n\nJennifer Pavane Kenter comes to Quinnipiac from the corporate litigation department at IBM, where she manages a docket of active commercial and employment litigation in state and federal courts and before arbitration panels, and counsels the business on disputes and other pre-litigation matters. Prior to joining IBM, Kenter practiced commercial litigation at Cooley LLP, where she handled a wide range of cases spanning contract disputes, trade secrets claims, shareholder derivative suits and First Amendment law, as well as criminal investigations and defense. Kenter also maintained an active pro bono practice, including work as co-counsel to legal services organizations on a class action lawsuit seeking payment of erroneously withheld welfare benefits for New York residents. Kenter is a graduate of Yale Law School, where she represented clients in the Domestic Violence Clinic and won the John Fletcher Caskey Prize for the best presentation of a case at the Yale Law School Barristers' Union Mock Trial Competition.\n\nKenter's scholarly interests lie at the intersection of contract law, discovery and the effective and efficient resolution of disputes. She will be teaching contracts as well as negotiation and other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) subjects.\n\nChester Eduardo Fernández will come to Quinnipiac from the National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA), where he currently serves as Director of Learning and Innovation. There, he focuses on integrating the voices of BIPOC and other marginalized individuals in training for legal aid and public defender attorneys. He is certified by the Black Public Defender Association as a racial justice trainer.\n\nPrior to working at the NLADA, Fernández served as a public defender in Boston, Massachusetts, and New Britain, Connecticut. In Connecticut, he worked in a training unit where he helped fellow public defenders learn best practices in providing passionate, client-centered representation that respects clients’ agency and humanity.\n\nFernández earned a Master of Science in Criminal Justice and a Master of Public Administration from Suffolk University, and a JD from the University of Colorado's School of Law. His research focuses on some of the most marginalized communities impacted by the criminal legal system including transgender and Latinx defendants who do not speak English. At Quinnipiac Law, he will teach criminal law, constitutional law and other courses related to criminal procedure, prisons and reentry."
