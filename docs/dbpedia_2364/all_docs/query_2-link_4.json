Learning new concepts, new ideas and sparking my inner energy. 📚 🔥 No matter how many times you have fallen, how many times you have been taken from and used ... you can keep moving forward. Even the tiniest step forward is progress. ☀️ Baby steps.... are still steps. Baby steps to the car ... baby steps to work ... baby steps to getting back up again and again. 🙌 Are you taking steps ? #whataboutBob #babysteps #energy #mindfulness #moutains #nature\n\n🪵 Preschool Perspective. 🏫 🙌 ❤️ 🌳 Took a nature walk with 2 three-year-olds, and we came across a tree in our path. 🪵 —>Both girls said we have to turn around and go back the way we came. Their comments made me laugh, smile and pause a moment to take in the situation from their perspective. 👧🏼🧒🏼 I explained to them if they held my hand they could easily put one foot on top of the tree, step up and jump right over. And with a hand and some reassurance they happily continued on our walk, to only ask to go around again and again. 🪵 🌳 The smallest change in perspective completely changed their path. Makes you think ... what have you been looking at like a huge hurdle ? With a little help ... looking at the problem from another direction ... could you jump right over ? 💥 🙌 #think #entrepreneurmindset #mindfulness\n\nBrief synopsis of my recent trip to Utah. ✈️ ⛰Saw beautiful mountains that mesmorized. Got to get out of my mom gear for a few days to socialize and meet new up and coming entrepreneurs.👩💻👨💼 🧬🔬Totally geeked out meeting scientists that are revolutionizing healthcare. Pic three ... well that’s the aftermath from chatting with the most brilliant minds I’ve ever met. 🤯🙌 . #healthcare #entrepreneurs #nerdlife #healingjourney #starttoday\n\nI lost my brain in Utah. 🧠 + 📚+🏔= ♥️ 🤷♀️ It was bogged down with clutter, dim lighting, and too many lattes and so the loss wasn’t tragic. I’d long become a zombie that I didn’t want to associate with. 🧟 It took several days to dump the trash talk from my inner dialogue and find the sun despite how incredibly gorgeous the mountains of Utah glow in the sunlight. ☀️⛰ Shocking what we discover when we stop looking and just be still. 🙌 I met new people. 🙍🏾♀️🙍🙍🏼♂️🙍🏽 Learned new things. 📚 Found that spark that had been buried too deep for too long. ⚡️ And the next chapter has been started. 💥💥💥💥💥W A R N I N G 💥💥💥💥 💥 It’s going to be a real page turner 😉 #freshstart #learning #newbeginnings #utah #mindset #healthcare #brainhealth"
