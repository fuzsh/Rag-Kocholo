My experience with the National Advocacy Service has been amazing. At the time of my husband's diagnosis, I felt lost and overwhelmed. Our lives were turned upside down, and I didn't know what to do. A google search leads me to the Peace of Mind Foundation and their support. From my first phone call, they have been a godsend.

I was provided with great advice, some financial assistance and help with applying for services that I never knew existed. Peace of Mind went above and beyond to help me get the proper support for my husband. The volunteers and team members I have interacted with have all had some experience with brain cancer and understand what is involved, which was essential and extremely helpful.

We recently applied for NDIS and were quickly approved. Thanks to Fiona and her incredible knowledge, the process was much easier than I anticipated. Her kindness and support mean more to me than I can describe. Our lives have definitely changed for the better. Even though we continue to face hardships that come along with a brain cancer diagnosis, the assistance we received from this wonderful foundation has helped immensely and taken a lot of our stress away.

I can't thank Fiona and the team at Peace Of Mind enough; they would be the first point of contact I recommend to anyone travelling this journey.
