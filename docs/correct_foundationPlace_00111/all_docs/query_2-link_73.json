        "text": "Global Ethics Day\n\nCreated by Carnegie Council, Global Ethics Day is an annual moment to empower ethics through the actions of individuals and organizations.\n\nCarnegie Ethics Accelerator\n\nThe Carnegie Ethics Accelerator is a new kind of incubator designed to empower ethics in the face of swiftly evolving challenges in technology and public policies.\n\nCarnegie Ethics Fellows\n\nThe Carnegie Ethics Fellows program (CEF) seeks to cultivate the next generation of ethical global leaders across business, policy, technology, NGOs, and academia.\n\nEthics & International Affairs Journal\n\nEthics & International Affairs is the quarterly journal of Carnegie Council. It aims to close the gap between the theory and practice of ethics.\n\nModel International Mobility Convention\n\nThe primary goal of the Model International Mobility Convention (MIMC) is to formulate new rules for migration and asylum that can benefit both migrants and refugees as well as their states of origin, transit, and destination.\n\nA Conversation with Carnegie Ethics Fellow George Shadrack Kamanda\n\nThis discussion features George Shadrack Kamanda, a diplomatic and legal affairs expert at the Permanent Mission of Sierra Leone to the United Nations.\n\nApplied Ethics\n\nCarnegie Council focuses on applied ethics through expert analysis on the ways that governments, institutions, and individuals interact and make choices on global challenges.\n\nMigration\n\nThough its initiatives and programs, Carnegie Council focuses on securing actions, rights, and duties to benefit migrants and refugees and their states of origin, transit, and destination.\n\nEmerging Technology\n\nCarnegie Council's programs, events, and experts focus efforts on applying ethical frameworks and solutions to the development of emerging technology.\n\nClimate Change\n\nCarnegie Council analyzes the ethics of climate change from socio-political perspectives in search of potential solutions to this pressing problem.\n\nDemocracy\n\nWith large numbers of people losing faith in democracy, Carnegie Council focuses on better understanding this trend.\n\nMultilateralism\n\nCarnegie Council sees multilateralism as essential to generating solutions to global problems and a critical component of an ethical present and future."
