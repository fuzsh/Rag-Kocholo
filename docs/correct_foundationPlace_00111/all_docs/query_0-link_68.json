        "text": "*In eligible fixed-rate purchase loan transactions, Pennymac will pay 1% of the note rate for the first 12 payments of the loan. This offer effectively reduces the rate of the loan by 1% for the first year of the mortgage. The payment of 1% by Pennymac will be accomplished through a custodial escrow account, to be funded by the lender-paid credit. The amount totaling the difference of 1% between the note rate and the temporary buydown rate will be dispersed to the escrow account, and the funds will be dispersed from the escrow account to the investor to account for the difference in interest during the buydown period (the first 12 months of the loan). The offer excludes VA, Jumbo, Closed-End Second and Adjustable-Rate Mortgages, refinance, investment property, third-party and in-process loans. The offer cannot be redeemed for cash or credit and is non-transferable. Occupancy restrictions may apply. Pennymac reserves the right to change or cancel the offer at any time, without notice. Additional restrictions or conditions may apply.\n\n**Customers who have obtained a Pre-Approval from Pennymac prior to locking any Pennymac purchase loan get $1,000 applied as a discount off total closing costs and/or principal curtailment, subject to investor guidelines. Excludes Jumbo, refinance, third-party and in-process loans. Offer subject to change or cancellation without notice.\n\n1Pennymac customers who close on a new purchase loan (\"Original Purchase Loan\") with Pennymac are eligible for a $2,000 credit on a refinance with Pennymac for the same property, subject to investor guidelines. Offer qualification period: The offer applies to Original Purchase Loans funded on 11/14/2023 through Original Purchase Loans locked by 12/31/2024. Customers must lock the refinance loan within three years of the funding date of the Original Purchase Loan to qualify. Credit may be applied as a discount off total closing costs and/or for principal curtailment. This offer cannot be combined with another lender credit offer, and may only be used once. Excludes Jumbo, Closed-End Seconds, third-party and in-process loans. Offer subject to change or cancellation without notice.\n\n2Pennymac Home Connect is offered in partnership with HomeStory Real Estate Services, a licensed real estate broker.
