        "text": "SPONSORED BY\n\nAbout\n\nThe Quad Fellowship is an initiative of the governments of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. Announced by the Quad partners on September 24, 2021, this first-of-its-kind scholarship program is designed to build ties among the next generation of scientists and technologists. The Quad Fellowship is operated in consultation with a non-governmental task force composed of academic, foreign policy, and private sector leaders from each Quad country. Beginning in 2024, the fellowship will be administered by the Institute of International Education (IIE), a global not-for-profit organization that manages many of the world’s most prestigious scholarship and fellowship programs.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship sponsors exceptional master's and doctoral students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the United States. The fellowship supports students from the four Quad countries – Australia, India, Japan, and the United States and expands this year to include sponsorship of students from Southeast Asian countries. The fellowship develops a network of science and technology experts committed to advancing innovation and collaboration in the private, public, and academic sectors, in their own nations and among Quad countries. The program builds foundational understanding among Quad Fellows of one another's societies and cultures through programming and networking opportunities with each country's top scientists, technologists, and politicians.\n\nSign up to receive program updates\n\nEmail Address\n\nThank you!\n\nCorporate Partners\n\nThe Quad Fellowship has been supported by a group of industry-leading corporate and civil society sponsors with track records of driving innovation and technological advancement.\n\nWant to learn more about the Quad Fellowship and the application process?\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Quad Fellowship offers a unique combination of financial benefits, cross-cultural exchange, networking, and programming.\n\nFinancial Benefit\n\nEach Quad Fellow will receive a one-time stipend of $40,000 to be used for academic expenses.\n\nProgramming\n\nDuring the Fellowship, Quad Fellows will have the opportunity to network and engage in programming with accomplished minds in STEM, government, and society.\n\nAlumni Program for Senior Fellows\n\nUpon graduation from the Quad Fellowship program, Senior Fellows will join a growing alumni network dedicated to advancing innovation and research for positive social impact.\n\nEligibility\n\nApplicants must:\n\nFAQ\n\nBenefits\n\nFinancial benefits\n\nEach Quad Fellow will receive a one-time award of $40,000 to be used for academic expenses. This award may be supplemented by other fellowships or grants.\n\nProgrammatic benefits\n\nIn addition to financial support, Quad Fellows will have the opportunity to participate in virtual programming with accomplished minds in STEM, government, and society.\n\nAlumni programming for Senior Fellows\n\nUpon graduation from the Quad Fellowship program, Senior Fellows will join a growing alumni network dedicated to advancing innovation and research for positive social impact.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship is the first multinational scholarship and educational fellowship program specifically supporting students in STEM.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship award of $40,000 can be used in combination with other grant and scholarship awards, enabling Fellows to maximize their education within a STEM field.\n\nQuad Fellowship programming will uniquely focus on elevating Fellows’ ability to use science and technology for social good.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship is an initiative of the Quad partnership between the governments of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. No other educational fellowship program operates with the express support of four national governments.\n\nMost exchange programs foster bilateral cultural exchange experiences. The Quad Fellowship uniquely offers opportunities for multilateral cross-cultural exchange and exposure, by recruiting from Australia, India, Japan, the United States, and the 10 ASEAN countries.\n\nThanks to support from the Quad governments and corporate partners, Quad Fellowship programming will offer Fellows unparalleled opportunities to connect with global leaders in STEM, government, business, and social impact.\n\nEligibility\n\nPlease see our eligibility criteria section to learn more about eligibility requirements.\n\nYes. So long as you are a citizen or legal permanent resident of Australia, India, Japan, the United States or any of the 10 Southeast Asian countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, or Vietnam, you are eligible to apply.\n\nYes. So long as you are a citizen or legal permanent resident of Australia, India, Japan, or the United States, or any of the 10 Southeast Asian countries, you are eligible to apply. If accepted, you must follow all visa application requirements using your Quad or Southeast Asian country citizenship or residency.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship will provide scholarship or research funding for master’s degrees and doctorate of philosophy degrees (PhDs) in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields. Clinical healthcare degrees such as doctorates of medicine and master’s of science in nursing are not eligible for funding.\n\nApplicants must be applying to or enrolled in a full-time degree-earning master’s of science (MS; MSc) or doctorate of philosophy (PhD) program at an accredited university in the United States in one of the following fields:\n\nAstronomy\n\nBiology\n\nChemistry\n\nCognitive Science\n\nComputer Science\n\nData Science\n\nEngineering\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\nGeology\n\nMathematics\n\nMaterial Science\n\nMeteorology\n\nNeuroscience\n\nOceanography\n\nStatistics\n\nPhysics\n\nPublic Health\n\nNo, clinical healthcare degrees such as medical degrees (including MDs, DOs, and PAs), nursing degrees, and clinical psychology degrees are ineligible for Quad Fellowship funding.\n\nYes.

So long as you are applying for a graduate degree in an eligible STEM field and satisfy the additional eligibility requirements, you are eligible to apply for the Quad Fellowship. If you are selected, the Quad Fellowship can only support academic expenses related to your STEM degree.\n\nThere are three components of the application process:\n\nOnline application requesting three essays, background information, and three letters of recommendation. At least two letters of recommendation must come from professors who can speak to the candidate’s academic abilities; one may come from either a professional contact or another academic contact.\n\nExpert review designed to assess proficiency in the applicant’s STEM field.\n\nFinal-round panel interview designed to assess passion for the intersection of STEM and social impact, and identify candidates who demonstrate integrity, curiosity, and compassion for the world around them.\n\nFor more details on the application process and required application materials, please see our Required Application Materials.\n\nWe use a holistic review process to evaluate applications within their context. While academic excellence is an important selection criterion, we do not rely solely on transcripts to make our decisions. The essays, letters of recommendation, and a candidate’s resume all factor into our assessment.\n\nThe application requires at least two letters of recommendation from professors who can speak to your academic abilities. The third letter of recommendation may be from either a professional contact or another academic contact.\n\nApplications\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Quad Fellowship does not sponsor Visas or National passports. We encourage you to inquire with your university as soon as possible about their visa process.\n\nSelected fellows must have no legal barrier to entry to the United States that would prevent them from acquiring a student visa to accept their Quad Fellowship. Failure to obtain a visa for any reason will result in your inability to accept a Quad Fellowship.\n\nThe Quad Fellowship does not offer financial support for partners or dependents of accepted Fellows.\n\nThe application and programming will be offered in English.\n\nYou may reapply in subsequent years so long as you plan to be enrolled in a qualified academic program during your time as a Fellow. We recommend indicating what has changed for you academically, personally, and professionally since your last application.\n\nDue to the high volume of applications, we are unable to offer individualized feedback, but encourage you to apply again if you continue to be eligible."
