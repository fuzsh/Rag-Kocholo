        "text": "A Nuisance No Longer\n\nStudents’ smartphones can enliven and enlighten an engineering classroom.\n\nBy Chris Rogers\n\nThe smartphone can be a major distraction, but it is in the classroom whether we want it or not. Every student has one, even in our partner K-12 schools, where most pupils qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. I learned this while speaking to elementary students in a summer program at the Tufts veterinary school. To differentiate engineering from science, I asked them to define each, working in teams of two or three. One student delivered an impressively detailed definition with great confidence. I must have looked surprised, because he happily raised his phone. For his generation, that’s where facts and definitions are found.\n\nMy goal is always to turn the classroom into a space where students find different solutions to the same problems, and thereby teach each other – and me. I’ve found the smartphone to be an invaluable tool. It has some amazing features, allowing anyone to find any fact – and evidence to support that fact – in seconds. A phone can let students share their work and ideas, learn from experts, interact in forums, and even act as a clicker (for example piazza.com). It can also be a calculator or a robot controller.\n\nIn a heat transfer class, students working together (at tables) can quickly look up material properties, estimate the fin efficiencies for various materials and geometries, and then compare across the classroom, spawning a conversation around which materials make good fins and which ones do not. Reading p-v plots in thermodynamics or even looking at the output of simulations in fluids can now be done quickly and easily.\n\nThe phone’s camera opens up the world of image processing and sensing. In high school physics, students have used their phones to video a ball bouncing and then used software (like the Vernier physics video app) to track the motion of the ball and compare it with known models. In teaching heat transfer last semester, I brought in the new FLIR infrared camera case for the iPhone (flir.com). The images catalyzed some excellent discussions as the students argued about which parts of the wall had more insulation, where the body lost most of its heat, and how different materials could feel colder or hotter and yet be the same temperature. Just by changing the lens through which they view the world, we can get them to eagerly discuss class content or appreciate and validate mathematical models.\n\nAs a robot-controller, the smartphone brings a number of advantages to robot design – from a touch screen user interface, to image processing, to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (and cellular) connection. One can even get rough positioning from the phone’s GPS hardware. The FIRST robotic competitions (USFirst.org) are starting this year with a cellphone at the center of their FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) competition. Most smartphones have built-in accelerometers, audio input and output channels, and some form of light sensor and buzzing motor, all of which can be integrated into the robot design. There are a number of companies (Romo, Woo Wee, and others) that sell robotic attachments for phones, and the larger world of telerobotics often relies on phones or tablets for all communication.\n\nThe phone can make the most difference in engineering education, though, as a documentation tool. Understanding the process the student goes through to solve a problem or design a solution is often very difficult if you have only the final product. Projects like Build in Progress at MIT (http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu) make it easy for students to document the progress of their work and get feedback from the cloud. Note-taking software, like Evernote, helps students share their progress and and get just-in-time feedback. One of my indicators of success in class is how many students take pictures or movies of their work, since that means they are sharing their learning with their friends.\n\nMaybe someday students will use watches instead. But in the meantime, I enjoy finding ways of leveraging phones to get students to think like scientists and engineers: questioning, testing, and iterating.\n\nChris Rogers is a professor of mechanical engineering and co-director of the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach at Tufts University. crogers@tufts.edu\n\nLeap of Imagination\n\nDesign Heuristics help students think outside the box and devise novel, more diverse solutions.\n\nBy Julia Kramer, Shanna Daly, Seda Yilmaz, Colleen Seifert, and Richard Gonzalez\n\nInnovations depend on creative-concept generation, but engineering students often struggle to come up with ideas. They typically proffer a handful and fixate either on their first idea or existing solutions. As a result, students explore only a narrow subset of possible solutions.\n\nTechniques to support concept generation include a tool called Design Heuristics, a collection of strategies for exploring variations in product designs (www.designheuristics.com). The tool was developed through empirical studies of industrial and engineering product designers and has been shown in prior research to assist students in creating new and diverse concepts.\n\nIn this study, we explored how students developed their initial ideas into final designs within a team project. We investigated whether initial ideas created using Design Heuristics led to successful, practical outcomes. At the beginning of the semester, undergraduate mechanical engineering students in a design project course learned the Design Heuristics tool. Each student used the tool to generate concepts for a remote-controlled machine to compete in a final challenge. The students then worked in teams to develop their ideas into a final design, which they built using traditional machining materials and techniques. Data collected included the initial concepts generated by individual students, team designs presented at the midterm review, and final designs presented by the teams at the end-of-term competition.\n\nThe results show that Design Heuristics were used to develop 91 percent of the students’ initial concepts and 78 percent of the final team designs. These findings suggest that the student teams found Design Heuristics to be applicable and practical for generating usable concepts and developing final designs. In addition, we found that almost half the teams synthesized components of several independent ideas into their team designs, using one or more of their Design Heuristics-inspired concepts.\n\nThese findings suggest several guidelines for engineering education. Instructors can provide tools for generating ideas and encourage students to use these methods to explore more initial design concepts. Engineering educators can also encourage their students to use Design Heuristics at several subsequent points in their design processes, and to engage in multiple divergent and convergent concept-development cycles. Revisiting the Design Heuristics tool throughout the design process may also support improvements in concept development by student teams. In particular, concept synthesis – combining the best ideas into one concept – is important for maximizing the impact of creative initial concepts.\n\nInstructors can implement these goals through the structures of their project deliverables. First, instructors may be able to alleviate their students’ tendency to settle on a concept too quickly by setting a minimum number of individual initial concepts, along with multiple initial team concepts. The Design Heuristics tool can be offered to help students reach this required number of concepts. Next, instructors could require student teams to demonstrate their concept development through divergent exploration, convergence, and synthesis throughout the design process. Requiring explicit documentation of these stages will help students learn to attend to concept development throughout their own developing design processes.\n\nThe assignment of appropriate deliverables must strike a balance between concept exploration and practical design outcomes. Our study offers support for Design Heuristics as a useful tool for encouraging students to consider a variety of ideas without sacrificing practical outcomes. As a result, students may learn to create practical and innovative design concepts for their projects.\n\nJulia Kramer is a Ph.D. graduate student in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.

Norton & Company. 2015, 288 pages.\n\nDepictions of introverted, socially inept mechanics may still exist to malign the engineering profession — but not for long, if Guru Madhavan has his way. A biomedical engineer, senior program officer at the National Academy of Sciences, and vice president of IEEE-USA, Madhavan helps debunk such stereotypes. His book offers an unabashed celebration of engineers and their plug-and-play thinking tool kit. These are people engaged in a profession “with profound consequences,” who are “deliberate, disciplined, open-minded, yet grounded in reality.”\n\nPeppered throughout the pages of this text are examples of engineering creativity, ingenuity, and determination, from the invention of the bar code to the modern cannon, cell phone GPS tracking, and the easy-flow plastic ketchup bottle. Madhavan is not simply touting success. Instead, he seeks to identify core mental capabilities that characterize the profession. Most notably, these include the ability to locate underlying structures of a project, to recognize and accommodate constraints, and to balance the necessary trade-offs. As the author notes, engineers must work “at the intersection of feasibility, viability, and desirability.”\n\nOffered with engaging flair, each case study emphasizes the importance of structures, constraints, and trade-offs. In Chapter Three, seemingly disparate discussions of mechanization at Piggly Wiggly stores, the function-based design of ATMs, and responsive supply methods at Toyota converge to demonstrate systematic design undertaken for efficiency and reliability. In Chapter Five, one engineer’s lifelong struggles to clean India’s Ganges River are placed alongside Sanford Fleming’s late 19th-century steps to establish standardized time zones and the 2012 Olympic committee’s efforts to prepare London for the summer games. All illustrate the chapter’s theme, “Solutions under Constraints.”\n\nThe opening chapters focus on flexible yet rigorous engineering mentalities. Hugh DeHaven devised the three-point seat belt, for example, after merging a study of human injuries sustained in suicide attempts with an analysis of commercial packaging. In each case, Madhavan reveals how constraints and inevitable trade-offs extend beyond technical considerations: Politics, religion, and human preference can often confound creators’ expectations. Fleming’s precise, logical formulations for standardized time offered considerable advantages over a mass of poorly aligned time systems; yet he had to labor to persuade mistrustful critics, including those who labeled him a communist. Many scientists and engineers zero in on the technical, but real-life constraints are inevitable, and effective response is crucial. Chapter Six, “Crossing Over and Adapting” highlights this point with the story of industrial engineer David Koon. His technical prowess with GPS technology and the personal anguish he faced following his 18-year-old daughter’s 1993 murder did little to aid Koon’s campaign to introduce improved 911 safety measures. Success came only after he immersed himself in the strategies of policymakers and learned to negotiate the labyrinthine requirements of legislation. Eventually, Koon pursued advocacy full time, leaving his position at Bausch & Lomb to run for the New York State Assembly.\n\nToday, as ever, scientists and engineers need to engage actively with social problems. “The soft stuff is actually the hard stuff,” the author writes, quoting former U.S. Navy Secretary and General Dynamics president Gordon England, a trained electrical engineer. Like many of his colleagues, Madhavan also argues that engineers can enhance their work through engagement with the arts, literature, humanities, sciences, and philosophy. Becoming more attuned to subtleties of human behavior can “boost our economies and serve our society” and encourage “an energetic type of pluralism.”\n\nApplied Minds is worth sharing with young engineering students. As Madhavan notes, engineering may be omnipresent, but it remains largely invisible to the general population, discussed primarily at points of failure, like airplane crashes and bridge collapses. This book helps support greater visibility and appreciation through anecdotes that will fascinate, amuse, and inspire. Each case study represents the ingenuity of engineers and the hard work that contributes to the creation of our world. Moreover, the text helps aspiring engineers value the rigorous thinking processes that characterize their profession. The engineering mind-set, Madhavan declares, can offer “an enduring cognitive archetype and durable practical construct for life.”\n\nReview by Robin Tatu\n\nRobin Tatu is Prism’s senior editorial consultant.\n\nDiversity\n\nWinners of the Student Video/Essay Contest\n\nBy the ASEE Diversity Committee\n\nOur exciting Year of Action on Diversity concluded with a student video and essay contest. We asked current engineering and engineering technology students to share a story related to any type of diversity (age, belief system, disability status, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, race, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and any other visible or non-visible differences). As hoped, we received a wide variety of entries, highlighting the diversity of our students and their willingness to discuss difficult issues, sometimes in front of faculty and staff from their own colleges. From veterans to international students, contestants shared stories and perspectives on topics ranging from gender identity to race, from visible to non-visible differences, and from inspirational, positive change to areas where change is needed. While their words are often encouraging, it is clear we still have a long way to go. We are pleased to share excerpts from the committee’s top selections. The full versions and other entries can be found on the diversity website: http://diversity.asee.org/essay-contest.\n\nOur first-place winner, Shante K. Stowell, created a unique audio piece that encourages thought and self-reflection. Stowell, an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, asked six students if there was one time in their lives when their race influenced their actions. Her intent was to “discover how these answers can help all of us understand each other better.” The question is interesting to ponder. How would you answer?\n\nThe second-place winner, Shenwei Chang, an undergraduate student at the University of Texas, Austin, provided a unique perspective on diversity through anecdotes that “illustrate the persistence of sexism in engineering,” as she explained in her application. Her essay “also briefly analyzes the diversity problem within engineering women’s spaces through the lens of intersectionality.” Chang challenges institutions to reform their “dominant microcultural norms in order to create a more inclusive and diverse educational environment.” She states:\n\nAs an aerospace engineering major, I have witnessed, through cases of blatant discrimination and subtler micro-aggressions, how deep-seated sexism remains in engineering. Multiple female friends of mine have quoted male peers who insist that women must “have it easy” in engineering due to affirmative action initiatives when evidence points to the opposite: Women often face pressure to perform better than their male peers to justify their presence in engineering. For example, male aerospace engineering students routinely discredit the women’s student organization for the major, assuming that our projects are less difficult than those of the other project-based organizations, which are male-dominated. Perhaps the most telling and egregious example, a friend of mine, the risk analyst and only woman on her senior design project team, was asked by her teammates to “analyze the risk of having an all-female design team.”\n\nArizona State University’s Samantha Matta, our third-place winner, provides a parallel between diversity and baklava. Matta reminds us that there is beauty in our differences. She states:\n\nThe burden of high family expectations that come with growing up as an Arab-American in America seem minuscule compared to the benefits of growing up in a bicultural Lebanese and American home. Truly, the baklava would not taste as wonderful with either of the layers missing. The adversity and beauty of the two separate cultures combined to make something unique and beautiful, something that has shaped me into the person I am today. Life as an Arab-American is not a piece of cake — I guess it’s more like a bite of baklava.\n\nThe ASEE Diversity Committee selected Sylvie DeLaHunt, of the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Florida’s Brianna Malcolm for honorable mention. DeLaHunt addressed the obstacles facing women in engineering and the positive change that her institution had implemented to tackle the gender gap. Malcolm’s essay describes the time when she realized she was the only black female in her mechanical engineering class but resolved not to let it deter her from pursuing her goals.\n\nPromoted by the ASEE Diversity Committee, the Year of Action is an open invitation to all ASEE members and constituents to engage in activities that lead our profession toward the creative strength, new ideas, and innovation that come with diversity.

Holder finished listening to the “sales pitch,” liked what he heard, applied, and got accepted. His friend went elsewhere. Holder, a strong math and science student, “wasn’t sure what engineering was and didn’t have any engineers in the family” but thought chemical engineering sounded “interesting.” So he enrolled in the college’s 3+2 program with Michigan, figuring “I could delay deciding until I understood what engineering was.” Three years did little to enlighten him, he recalls, “but I got to take history of art, religion, psychology, and other courses I couldn’t have taken if I had studied only engineering.”\n\nHolder quickly discovered he “wanted to be a professor more than to be an engineer,” threw himself into pursuit of a Ph.D., which he earned in 1976, and joined the chemical engineering faculty at Columbia University. Moving to Pitt three years later, he became department chair from 1986 to 1995.\n\n“I don’t think I aspired to be an administrator,” reflects Holder, who has rebuffed numerous requests to interview for provost and president, but he recognizes that “the dean has the most influence on the fortunes of the school.”\n\nOn Holder’s watch, the Swanson School of Engineering, named for the founder of ANSYS, launched a Center for Energy and the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation, which focuses on the design of sustainable neighborhoods and “green” construction technologies. He has also been engaged in partnerships with the School of Medicine and Innovation Institute to identify, develop, and commercialize promising biomedical projects. A joint engineering institute with Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, will teach the Pitt program in English to 1,600 Chinese undergraduates and let Pitt students study abroad and still stay on course to graduate.\n\nHolder serves on ASEE’s board as chair of the Engineering Deans Council. His goals for the Society include increasing diversity – an important priority at Pitt – and raising its profile in Washington. “It would be nice to have all these candidates for [U.S.] president become cognizant that the organization called ASEE exists.”\n\nMeet Your Staff\n\nAt Home with Classic Autos, Exotic Pets\n\nby Nathan Kahl\n\nJoe Dillon, ASEE’s relatively new CFO, is used to being in the middle of challenging situations, in the past dropping in to organizations in need of financial leadership.\n\nLiterally in the middle as a child – the fourth of seven kids – Joe was born and raised in the D.C. area. He was an enterprising youngster, buying a paper route from a friend’s brother and later having a mowing business that included 15 yards. “Mom told me when I was in sixth grade that if I wanted to go to college I needed to start saving for it,” a lesson he took to heart. That college turned out to be the nearby University of Maryland and after graduating with his accounting degree he worked in a variety of nonprofit organizations in the financial office – passing the CPA exam in 1984 – most recently as the CFO for the Council of Better Business Bureaus. He joined ASEE in August.\n\n“I’m boring, just like all accountants,” Joe jokes when asked what he does outside of work. His interests include dabbling in woodworking, kayaking with his wife, and restoring classic cars. “The cars started as a hobby that my two sons and I could work on together, and that lasted 10 minutes; they didn’t want anything to do with it.” Joe motored forward anyway, counting a 1960s GTO as one of his favorite projects.\n\nAmong the things that make Joe unique at ASEE (or anywhere) is that the now-deceased Dillon family pet was not a cat or dog, but an iguana… a reptile that measured six feet after Joe and family had owned him for 17 years. He would nestle on top of a couch in the sun (the iguana, not Joe), surprising guests who assumed it was a stuffed animal.\n\nJoe and his wife of 37 years, a schoolteacher, live in Montgomery County, Md., not far from their two adult sons. While there are no more iguanas in the future, the Dillons are expecting to become grandparents for the first time later this year.\n\nOpen Up Engineering Education Research\n\nIt’s time for a dialogue on sharing research data.\n\nOpinion by Aditya Johri\n\nIn March, 2015, the National Science Foundation released its Public Access Plan (Today’s Data, Tomorrow’s Discoveries), which lays out an impressive agenda to improve transparency of public funding by increasing access to research outcomes and data. The Public Access Plan is a necessary and ambitious document and follows in the steps of similar initiatives by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies. It is important for engineering educators to pay attention to this policy not only because the community receives significant support from NSF but also because the release of this document provides an ideal opportunity for the community to engage in an honest dialogue around a persistent problem in the community – the lack of sharing of research data.\n\nAs part of a recent research study on data sharing, funded by NSF, I have had numerous conversations with engineering educators who have all expressed their frustration with the lack of data sharing within the community. They contend that it’s the ethical and moral duty of a researcher to be as open as possible with research funded by taxpayers. They also argue that the lack of shared research data can lead to duplication of research efforts and resources (financial and physical), an inability to replicate or provide alternative explanations for findings (both hallmarks of peer-reviewed research), and exclusivity, as resource-poor researchers and institutions cannot participate in the research enterprise. Almost everyone I spoke to expressed an interest in crafting a common charter for more open and efficient research practices within the community, including shared norms around access to data.\n\nEven though interest in data sharing is high, researchers are keenly aware of potential barriers. They understand now that there is a need to better understand institutional review board-related issues, especially concerns with protecting the privacy of participants. Data are often highly dependent on the context for interpretation, and lack of description or meaningful metadata can make sharing unusable. Therefore, solutions such as sharing of de-identified data are easier to achieve with quantitative data but not necessarily with qualitative data collected for interpretive research.\n\nCommunity members also cited the absence of incentives for data sharing. For instance, research funding is directed towards new data collection rather than secondary data analysis. Within higher educational institutions, the tenure and promotion process values external funding and publications, but efforts to share data or create similar infrastructures go unrewarded.\n\nSome researchers are reluctant to share data because they plan to publish it and fear somebody else might get the benefit.\n\nRespondents identified several ways for data sharing to be supported. They expressed a desire for an easy-to-use online system that would require minimal effort and allow for uploading, downloading, and managing permissions. Best practices for data management throughout the research process could be integrated with data sharing. Such integrative workflows are common across other fields, and as a maturing research field, engineering education is well positioned to develop them. Educators suggested that incentives be designed to encourage both data sharing generally and secondary data analysis. Protocols are needed to guide who can publish first using shared data as well as authorship credit.\n\nSharing information is essential if institutions of higher education and their faculty members are to remain at the forefront of knowledge creation. If we want to make the engineering education field more inclusive, we need to reduce barriers to entry. A community effort to share research data is a critical step in that direction. Finally, technological advances will help, but they have their limits; research is a socio-technical enterprise, and norms have to come from within the community. In this effort the community can find models in such successful projects as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, Qualitative Data Repository, and Databrary, an open library for sharing video data. It is time to have an honest dialogue.\n\nAditya Johri is an associate professor of information sciences and technology and director of the Engineering Education and Cyberlearning Laboratory at George Mason University.
