        "text": "In simple terms, My Portal by Dignity Health is replacing My Care to serve you better. The enhanced My Portal by Dignity Health is part of our commitment to helping you better manage your health between visits, track appointments, and stay on top of preventive and screening services.\n\nMy Portal by Dignity Health replaced My Care, effective February 14, 2024, and became your go-to health management tool. The My Care mobile app will be officially retired as of April 16, 2024. After this date, My Care users won’t be able to get into the My Care mobile app.\n\nYou will no longer use your My Care account to access your portal. If you are searching for information about historical visits or the care you received on or before May 31, 2021, please access your health records here. This link will be valid through December 31, 2024.\n\nYou will no longer use your My Care account to access your portal. If you are searching for information about historical visits or the care you received on or before July 23, 2019, please access your health records here. This link will be valid through December 31, 2024.\n\nYou will no longer use your My Care account to access your portal. If you are searching for information about historical visits or the care you received on or before June 19, 2022, please access your health records here. This link will be valid through December 31, 2024.\n\n(Only new users need to enroll for portal access)\n\nSetting up your account is the first step. To start the set-up process, look for a patient portal invitation sent to the email you provided to the hospital or clinic during your visit or after scheduling your appointment and follow the steps to set up your account. Talk to your doctor’s office front desk staff if you haven’t received a patient portal email invitation.\n\nWe constantly assess the usage and impact of our services to ensure we allocate resources effectively and prioritize functionalities that benefit most users. In light of low usage, we have removed the Care Team feature to focus on delivering the best experience. You can still view and search for current providers within My Portal by Dignity Health. Simply click on Appointments and, using the new “filter” option, narrow down your search by provider name or appointment type.\n\nIf you need to reset your password, you can conveniently do it within My Portal by Dignity Health. Simply click on the Forgot Password button and follow the instructions sent to your email or phone number to regain access to your account.\n\nIf your account is not active or you need help adding an authorized representative, resending a pending or expired patient portal email invitation, or have other login problems, My Portal by Dignity Health offers technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week by telephone, toll-free at (844) 274-8497."
