Our department features state-of-the-art research labs, a training clinic, and a wide array of research and clinical opportunities for our graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nStudents in Drexel's Bachelor of Science in Psychology program learn how to frame and find answers to important questions regarding human behavior, cognition and emotion, while working alongside faculty who are leaders in the field. Within the Psychological and Brain Sciences program, students have the option to focus in specific areas: Mind, Brain and Behavior, Human Development or Clinical and Health. For a select number of undergraduates, the Psychological and Brain Sciences department offers an Accelerated BS/MS degree that allows students to earn both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in just five years.\n\nDrexel’s nationally recognized Psychological and Brain Sciences graduate programs prepare clinical and research leaders, advance the forefront of scientific discovery and address complex mental health issues. We offer four graduate degrees that position students for excellent careers in psychological and brain sciences across a broad spectrum of sectors and settings. At the graduate level, the Master of Science in Psychology is ideal for students who wish to pursue advanced education in scientific psychology and research methods. Our terminal degrees include the PhD in Clinical Psychology, which trains students in the scientist-practitioner model; the PhD in Applied Cognitive and Brain Sciences, which emphasizes rigorous quantitative and methodological training; and the joint JD/PhD in Law and Psychology, which bridges the gap between the two disciplines.\n\nDrexel Co-Op for Psychological and Brain Sciences Students\n\nThrough Drexel’s cooperative education program (co-op), undergraduates embark on up to three, six-month periods of employment, exploring their career options, strengthening their résumés and building a professional network in the process. Students in our Psychological and Brain Sciences program have held co-op positions at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Magee Rehabilitation Center, the School District of Philadelphia, the Drexel Psychological Services Center, as well as nonprofit organizations focused on health and wellbeing in the community.\n\nLearn More About Drexel Co-op\n\nMentorship and Support\n\nDrexel’s Psychological and Brain Sciences department is a close-knit group that prioritizes student support and mentorship. A unique feature of our undergraduate program is our Faculty First-Year Mentorship Program, which pairs new psychology majors with a faculty member with a similar clinical or research interest. During their first year at Drexel, students meet with their faculty mentors once per term to explore their academic and professional goals, learn about the department’s resources, and receive guidance as they adjust to life at Drexel. Graduate students in the department are mentored by one or two faculty members who serve as professional and academic advisers. They also work one-on-one in faculty labs, gaining intensive research experience in a variety of clinical and research settings.\n\nPsychological and Brain Sciences Student Organizations\n\nThe Psychological and Brain Sciences community in our department is lively and fueled by two active student organizations, which support the study of psychology in the college:\n\nPSI CHI Honor Society - Provides academic recognition for inductees and encourages the growth of psychology through members' participation in psychology-related activities.\n\nPsychology Club - Strives to promote interest in psychology through events, activities, and social interactions between students and faculty.
