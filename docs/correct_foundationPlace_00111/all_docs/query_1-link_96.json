        "text": "Thank you Keweenaw Community Foundation for your efforts in helping improve outdoor recreation in the Keweenaw. As the Township continues to expand its network of trails and outdoor recreational offerings,\n\nwe look forward to working with you again in the coming years.\n\nThe Keweenaw Community Foundation has made it possible to provide tangible energy savings to an often-overlooked sectorâ€”the 501c3 community, which will enable them to allocate more resources for their individual core missions. In addition to that, we've been able to bring knowledgeable energy experts to the area to help residents better comprehend our shared energy landscape.\n\nGreat trails don't happen by accident. For well over two decades volunteers from our community have come together to build and maintain exciting non-motorized trails for everyone to enjoy. What started as a fun hobby for a few local pioneers now attracts tens of thousands of people to the Keweenaw, helping to support our economy and boosting quality of life for those who live and work here. We are proud to have some of the best mountain bike trails in the Midwest and appreciate the support that our community has provided over the years to keep the dream alive. Ride on!"
