        "text": "Hi Marvin, ageusia and lack of smell started to improve by the 5th session (15-20 minutes). Fully recovered after 12 sessions. Thank you.\n\nIt works great for me\n\nDr JLO (experimental intranasal PBM trial)\n\nThanks to you my wife is still alive and sometimes lucid. You've given me time to make some great discoveries specific to the treatment of Lewy Body Dementia. Neurofeedback and 40hz lasers are an essential tool in helping the brain. heal.\n\nMichael - his wife has Lewy Body Dementia\n\nThe changes we have seen in our son are nothing short of amazing. He has severe PTSD, and was highly dissociative. He started NFB in July 2013, and by August, he was beginning to articulate the trauma...Since then, he has been able to describe his history, as to events, persons, and place. His dissociation is reduced by about 80%. It is such a beautiful thing to behold. He is becoming himself, his true self.\"\n\n​ - Mary B. Mother of PTSD client\n\n\"I am writing you this letter, delighted to inform you of the progress observed in my aunt. My aunt has a condition that causes the degeneration of the cerebellum of her brain; this has resulted in her spending a lot of time at home due to her limited movement and speech. This condition has caused us concern, as we started to notice other signs of cognitive decline, such as inability to understand what is being said to her, hand stutter, speech stutter, memory decline etc. After using the Vielight Neuro Alpha, my aunt has improved dramatically. We have noticed that her verbal stutter has improved, her hand stutter has improved, her memory has returned to normal, and her ability to understand what is being said to her has also returned to normal. We are very thankful for your treatment device, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is concerned about their loved one.\"\n\n-Demiana W\n\nWas just thinking about you and wanted you to know how grateful I am that you embarked on your journey with PBM. While not life changing cure, the treatment has improved my “quality of life”immensely. It has allowed me to focus more on living life as well as possible. Know how you’ve helped me. Thank you.\n\nAlso, a couple of observations for you: the new helmet settings are working fine. So all good there, maybe more interesting to you is that I’ve noticed that using the spine LED device seems to benefit my left leg movement. Here is why I say that. 5 days each week I walk on a manual treadmill. Before using the light the left foot “skidded” during the forward step. After the light use, I noticed that that was happening FAR less frequently. Then, I went off the light therapy for several days (and my sleep was very bad). After returning to regular therapy schedule, I’m now again “lifting” the leg better. While I hesitate to make a causal connection, that’s wonderful news.\n\nDT, 5 years with ALS\n\n​\n\n\"thanks for the video on how to reconfigure and train with the VieLight Neuro. Got my 2nd Moderna shot Friday, and next morning I had an unexpected reaction; fatigue, muscle aches, brain fog, and very unsteady on my feet causing balance problems not due to dizziness.\n\nYour new Vielight protocol quickly resolved everything on Saturday, except that my lower legs still felt “wooden”, and this was resolved today.\n\nHappily vaccinated for COVID 19\n\nMy husband and I have been using the PBM Helmet since August 6th. My husband noticed an immediate improvement in his balance, increased clarity of thoughts, and deeper, more restful sleep.\n\nI recently am noticing slightly improved memory recall, and my sleep is gradually improving.\n\nWe both feel fortunate to have met Marvin Berman, PhD to help us on our continued journey toward renewed health and vitality.\n\nTeri\n\n“After suffering severe traumatic brain injury, I went to more than 22 doctors before going to Dr. Berman. He told me he would help me get better and get my life back. And he has.”\n\n​- Stacey PTSD & TBI\n\n​\n\nI want to affirm my continuing support for Quietmind and all the ground-breaking research that you are doing. It is just simply wonderful. As someone whose parent has Alzheimer’s, the Neuradiant device offers a glimmer of hope for me and the millions of sufferers and their families. There is little hope of a pharmaceutical cure given all the failed drugs trials.\n\n- Yvonne, Mom with Alzheimer's"
