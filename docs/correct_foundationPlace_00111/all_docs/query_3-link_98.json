        "text": "I requested an absentee ballot. Can I change my mind and vote at the polls? Here are your state-specific rules.\n\nWith all the chatter about different ways of voting, many people are wondering about their options. We are receiving a lot of inquiries from voters about whether someone can change their mind and go to the polls if they have already requested an absentee ballot. Unfortunately, there is no single answer - it varies by state. This chart will help you determine what works best for you.\n\nIf you do change your mind and decide to go to the polls, in most cases, you’ll be asked to sign a sworn statement attesting that you have not already voted. You cannot go to the polls to change your vote, if you already cast your ballot. (Those are two very different things, friends;-) Voting more than once is against the law.\n\nIn all cases, we recommend sticking to your original voting plan - if you requested and received an absentee ballot, it is best to vote that ballot. Changing your mind creates additional work for poll workers and election officials in a year when there is already significant pressure on our election system.\n\nWe've identified 5 situations you may encounter, depending on your state: *see below for further detail on the definitions of these 5 situations\n\nNote: These provisions apply to voters who have already requested an absentee ballot.
