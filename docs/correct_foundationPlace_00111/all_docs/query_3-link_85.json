        "text": "Our Family is Changing the World\n\nAt Auburn, our work changes lives. We are dedicated to shaping the future of the people of Alabama, the nation, and the world through forward-thinking education, life-enhancing research and scholarship and selfless service.\n\nAuburn's most significant investment is in our employees, as they are vital to helping us remain one of the nation's top universities. We have been recognized as a Top Employer by DiversityJobs and other national publications.\n\nWe invite you to check out this page and to learn more about the many career opportunities offered at Auburn, and how you can become a part of the Auburn Family.\n\nThis Alabama city is full of small-town charm, cozy traditions and, yes, lots of team spirit. -Livability\n\nAuburn is one of the best places to live in America. We're not the only ones who think that. Southern Living recognizes Auburn as one of the South's Best College Towns. USA Today, Money magazine and Forbes are among the other national publications that have recognized Auburn and neighboring Opelika.\n\nIt's easy to understand why Auburn (population, 80,000) and Opelika (population, 32,000) are such great places to live. Centrally located in the Southeast, both cities are less than two hours from Atlanta and Birmingham, and only a few hours from the Gulf of Mexico beaches and the Great Smoky Mountains. (In fact, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is less than 90 minutes away!)\n\nAuburn and Opelika are both small cities that offer big opportunities. Both cities offer unique downtowns with fine dining and shopping, along with excellent schools and parks, championship golf and cultural opportunities that would rival many much larger cities. (We even have a 24-court pickleball facility that is among the best in the Southeast!)\n\n\"Here, you'll find a boutique town that's budget-friendly, a backyard full of Alabama pines, trails, and waterways to explore, year-round gentle seasons, legendary restaurants, a hub for engineering, a vibrant and youthful community, and venues that are extensions of our forward-thinking mentality and rooted traditions.\" the Auburn and Opelika Tourism Bureau states.\n\nCommunity Links and Info\n\n10 Reasons to Love Auburn & Opelika\n\n'We Believe in Auburn'\n\nAuburn University has developed into one of the\n\nlargest universities in the South, remaining in the educational forefront with its traditional blend of arts and applied science and changing with the needs of today while living with a respect for the traditions and spirit that are Auburn.\n\nAt the heart of the Auburn Family is the Auburn Creed. George Petrie wrote what he felt all Auburn students, faculty, and staff stood for. Today, the Auburn Creed is the beloved Auburn doctrine:\n\nI believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work.\n\nI believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work wisely and trains my mind and my hands to work skillfully.\n\nI believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men.\n\nI believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid, and in clean sports that develop these qualities.\n\nI believe in obedience to law because it protects the rights of all.\n\nI believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellow men and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all.\n\nI believe in my Country, because it is a land of freedom and because it is my own home, and that I can best serve that country by \"doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with my God.\"\n\nAnd because Auburn men and women believe in these things, I believe in Auburn and love it."
