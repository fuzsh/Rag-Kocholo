        "text": "​​​​​​The Tree City USA program is a national program that provides the framework for community forestry management for cities and towns across America.\n\nCommunities achieve Tree City USA status by meeting four core standards of sound urban forestry management:\n\nMaintaining a tree board or department\n\nHaving a community tree ordinance\n\nSpending at least $2 per capita on urban forestry\n\nCelebrating Arbor Day\n\nParticipating communities have demonstrated a commitment to caring for and managing their public trees. In Oregon, nearly 70 communities participate in the Tree City USA program.\n\nMap of Tree City USA communities​ in Oregon​\n\nList of Tree City USA communities​ in Oregon\n\nIf your community is interested in becoming a Tree City USA, please contact an Urban and Community Assistance Forester, view the storymap about celebrating Oregon's Tree City USA communities, or visit the Arbor Day Foundation website​.\n\nTree Campus USA\n\nThe Arbor Day Foundation also recognizes college and university campuses committed to their green space through the Tree Campus USA program. Tree Campus USA schools:\n\nEffectively manage their campus trees\n\nDevelop a connection with their community beyond campus borders to foster healthy, urban forests\n\nStrive to engage their student population with campus and community forestry efforts\n\nLearn more about becoming a Tree Campus USA​ from the Arbor Day Foundation​.​​​​\n\n​​​Tree City USA communities\n\nApril was proclaimed as Oregon Arbor Month for the first time in 2021.​ To mark the occasion, the Oregon Department of Forestry asked the state's 69 Tree City USA communities to send us a photo capturing the city's Tree City USA spirit. These same cities were asked the question, \"What does earning Tree City USA recognition mean to your city?\" With this information, we created what we believe is an inspiring and engaging story, combining images, text, and an interactive Oregon map. The storymap made its debut April 15 in the middle of Arbor Month.\n\n​View the storymap about celebrating Oregon's Tree City USA communities.​​​\n\n​​In Oregon, we set aside the month of April to honor trees. Click here for information about Oregon Arbor Month or contact your local Urban and Community Assistance Forester. In addition, click here ​to discover 14 pandemic-safe ways to celebrate Oregon Arbor month.\n\nArbor Day is America's national tree holiday. It's a day other states set aside to plant ceremonial trees, educate children about the importance of trees and honor the important role trees play in our daily lives. National Arbor Day is celebrated on the last Friday in April, but Oregon observes tree related activates all month to fit best tree planting times statewide.\n\nFor more information on Arbor Day or to plan a celebration, visit the Arbor Day Foundation.\n\n​​Late spring in Oregon with its long hours of daylight and warmer weather is a great time of the year to share your love of trees with your community. Although the people who care for urban trees are busy watering, pruning, and performing other day-to-day maintenance tasks, with trees leafed out and some still in flower, the weeks before summer are great times of the year even during our pandemic to celebrate and educate others about the many benefits trees provide.\n\nAdding a few fun education and outreach activities into your summer work plan helps raise awareness of trees and your program at a time when a lot of residents have more time on their hands because of COVID-19. You can reach an even larger audience by joining forces with other programs and non-profits in your area.\n\nHere are some good examples that residents of your community can engage in from home or alone at a safe physical distance from others:\n\nTree tours – Se​​lf-guided or online\n\nSolicit suggestions from community members to locate favorite trees in your town, then:\n\nCreate an online tour to showcase trees by taking photos and posting descriptions.\n\nCreate and print a brochure with a map for a self-guided city tree tour. Partner with a food delivery service to include one with deliveries in neighborhoods near the tour route.\n\nTree stories\n\nCollect stories about historic or prominent community trees and partner with the local newspaper to publish a “tree of the month\" article.\n\nResearch the history of a prominent local tree and consider nominating them as a heritage tree for your city or even with the state-level Heritage Tree program.\n\nTeam up with your community's parks or recreation department\n\nOffer an online tree identification webinar.\n\nHost a Zoom meeting about tree art – discuss how people can go find twigs, leaves, and branches in their yards or nearby (without damaging trees) and create interesting collages or other artwork.\n\nPartner with local or regional arborists\n\nHold online workshops explaining tree care or maintenance, proper pruning or tree watering, etc.\n\nHold a photo contest that highlights park trees in your community. The contest winner might receive a tree, planted on their behalf in their favorite park next spring. (Hint: Tree City USA Arbor Day grants can pay for trees planted for Arbor Day events.)\n\nWork with a local bookstore to hold a “poe-tree\" contest; display selected poems in large type in the store window or in City Hall. (Hint: Haiku poems are short and easy to fit on a single sheet.)\n\nThis list may help stir up some ideas about how you can involve your community in the joy and benefits provided by trees, while raising the visibility of your city's urban forestry program and the importance of caring for the community forest.​\n\nCelebrate Oregon Arbor Month\n\n​14 pandemic-safe ways to celebrate Oregon Arbor Month​\n\nWi​ll your​​​​​​ city be submitting a 2021 Tree City USA application?​\n\nDue to the pandemic, the Arbor Day Foundation has modified Standard 4 requirements of an Arbor Day proclamation and observance. Cities applying for Tree City USA status in 2021 are REQUIRED to proclaim Arbor Day, and ENCOURAGED (NOT required) to observe Arbor Day while safely socially distancing.\n\nLearn more about the Tree City USA - The Arbor Day Foundation."
