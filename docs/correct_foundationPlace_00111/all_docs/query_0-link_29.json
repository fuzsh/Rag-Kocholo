Licensing requirements are the exclusive responsibility of the State Board of Nursing.\n\nThe Associate in Applied Science (AAS) Nursing Program is approved by the Arizona State Board of Nursing and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN), 3390 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA 30326; (404.975.5000); email: info@acennursing.org.\n\nProgram offerings:\n\nThis program is offered at the following sites:\n\nChandler-Gilbert Community College\n\nEstrella Mountain Community College\n\nGateWay Community College\n\nGlendale Community College\n\nMesa Community College\n\nParadise Valley Community College\n\nPhoenix College\n\nScottsdale Community College\n\nWaiver of Licensure/Certification Guarantee:\n\nAdmission or graduation from the Nursing Program does not guarantee obtaining a license to practice nursing. Licensure requirements and the subsequent procedures are the exclusive right and responsibility of the Arizona State Board of Nursing. Students must satisfy the requirements of the Nurse Practice Act: Statutes, Rules and Regulations, independently of any college or school requirements for graduation.\n\nPursuant to A.R.S. 32-1606(B)(17), an applicant for professional or practical nurse license by examination is not eligible for licensure if the applicant has any felony convictions and has not received an absolute discharge from the sentences for all felony convictions. The absolute discharge must be received five or more years before submitting this application. If you cannot prove that the absolute discharge date is five or more years, the Board cannot process your application.\n\nLevel One Fingerprint Clearance is required for admission into the program.

At a minimum, students will be required to lift patients, stand for several hours at a time and perform bending activities. Students who have a chronic illness or condition must be maintained on current treatment and be able to implement direct patient care. The clinical nursing experience also places students under considerable mental and emotional stress as they undertake responsibilities and duties impacting patients' lives. Students must be able to demonstrate rational and appropriate behavior under stressful conditions. Individuals should give careful consideration to the mental and physical demands of the program prior to making application. All must provide documentation of compliance with all health and safety requirements required to protect patient safety. Only students in compliance are permitted to enroll in nursing courses.
