        "text": "Feel free to email us at inquiries@wennergren.org.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for a Dissertation Fieldwork Grant, a Post-PhD Research Grant, a Hunt Postdoctoral Fellowship, or a Fejos Postdoctoral Fellowship in Ethnographic Film, email applications@wennergren.org.\n\nIf you have a question about an active Dissertation Fieldwork Grant, a Post-PhD Research Grant, a Hunt Postdoctoral Fellowship, or a Fejos Postdoctoral Fellowship in Ethnographic Film, please contact Mary Beth Moss, mmoss@wennergren.org. If your final report is due and you have questions, contact Mark Ropelewski, mropelewski@wennergren.org\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about the Conference and Workshop Program or the Symposium and Seminar Program, contact Donna Auston at dauston@wennergren.org.\n\nFor information about the Engaged Research Grants, the Global Initiatives Grants, and the Wadsworth Fellowships, contact Judy Kreid at jkreid@wennergren.org.\n\nTo learn more about the Historical Archives Program, contact Mark Mahoney at mmahoney@wennergren.org.\n\nIf you have any questions about the online application submission process, contact applications@wennergren.org.\n\nWriting proposals is hard work. So is evaluating them. We do our best to provide all our applicants with fair and constructive feedback. This takes time.\n\nFor Dissertation Fieldwork Grants, Post-PhD Research Grants, and Hunt Postdoctoral Fellowships, there are two stages to our review process.\n\nStage One: One of our screeners will determine whether your application meets our general criteria for evaluation. Approximately 50 percent of these proposals are successful at this point and move on to Stage Two. If you have not heard from us by August 1 (for the May 1 application deadline) or March 1 (for the November 1 application deadline), please contact the Foundation for information on the progress of your application.\n\nStage Two: A panel of three reviewers will evaluate your proposal. Approximately 33 percent of Stage Two applications receive grants. We will do our best to inform you of our decision at least 2 weeks before the next application deadline (April 15 for the May 1 deadline and October 15 for the November 1 deadline). Again, contact us if you have not heard from us by these dates.\n\nFollow us on Facebook (facebook.com/wennergrenfoundation) and Twitter (@wennergrenorg) to learn when we have sent out the Stage One and Stage Two notifications.\n\nFor Engaged Research Grants, Fejos Postdoctoral Fellowships in Ethnographic Film, SAPIENS Public Fellowships, SAPIENS Public Scholars Training Fellowship, Wenner-Gren Fellowships in Anthropology and Black Experiences, Wadsworth International and Wadsworth African Fellowships, Wadsworth Institutional Grants, Conference and Workshop Grants, Global Initiatives Grants, and Historical Archives Program grants, a single panel of reviewers will evaluate your application. You should hear from us between 2 and 6 months after the application deadline.\n\nWe treat all application materials as confidential, with one notable exception. If you win a grant or fellowship, we will publish your name, your project title, and your abstract on our website.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to enlisting reviewers whose backgrounds are as wonderfully diverse as those of applicants. We have reviewers from every subfield of anthropology, based in every continent in the world. We look for individuals with expertise in emerging fields of inquiry, and we prioritize intellectual generosity. We are particularly eager to draw on the insights of anthropologists from historically marginalized communities and traditions of scholarship. Reviewing is hard work, and we’ve done our best to recruit individuals who have the skills and mindset they need to do a good job.\n\nYou will find annual lists of reviewers in https://wennergren.org/about-us/#financials\n\nYes. Covid taught us to expect the unexpected. Pandemics aren’t the only disaster that can disrupt a researcher’s plans. If you are applying for a Conference or Workshop Grant, you’ll want to think ahead about what you’ll do if you and your colleagues are not able to gather in person. If you are applying for an Engaged Research Grant, you and your partners should develop a broad sweep of methods, not all of which depend on your ability to meet face-to-face.\n\nApplicants for the Dissertation Fieldwork Grant and the Post-PhD Research Grant still need to provide two separate versions of their research design, including a Plan B that would be feasible to do remotely should conditions change radically. This could be a new pandemic, a disaster, or even a personal emergency that prevents your travel. We’ve found the process of thinking through a remote plan adds immeasurably to the depth of research possibilities before, during, and after fieldwork. Should your application be approved, we’ll fund your Plan A. But if the need arises, you’ll have a Plan B in your resources to allow your work to proceed. We want to know your project will be safe and ethical even if disaster strikes.\n\nNo, but we do expect you to know what kind of permission or permit(s) you will need. In your application, we will ask you to list the permits required and the estimated date by which you expect to secure each one. These might include research visas, letters of affiliation, human subject approvals, animal care and use approvals, excavation permits, and permissions from the local scientific, academic, museum, institutional, or tribal authorities who oversee your research area. We also ask for local permission: letters, emails, and other evidence of consent from within the country or community where you’ll be doing your research. To fund your project, we need to know that you are committed to addressing any ethical issues raised by your research. Consult with your interlocutors and/or contacts for help.\n\nWe designed this fellowship for students who plan to return to their home country after finishing their PhD, to accept an academic appointment in anthropology. We will ask your home sponsor to discuss why you are pursuing a doctorate abroad instead of seeking training in your own country. We will also ask them to comment on the opportunities that will be open to you as a teacher and/or researcher in your country upon completion of your degree. If there is a faculty member from the institution where you received your master’s degree, who is not going to be your host sponsor but who can provide this information, they could be your home sponsor.\n\nCongratulations! You can accept the grant by sending in the required items through the link in your approval notice. These items include your completed, signed grant forms and copies of your permits, permissions, study or research visas, and any other pertinent authorizations. It’s important that you gather the required items and submit them all together, as you can only use the submittal link one time. If you have any questions or if there will be a long delay in sending these items, please contact your program administrator.\n\nThe only deadline we have is 2 weeks before your start date, but grantees may request payment well in advance to be ready to go. Please note that we do not provide funding retroactively. If your start date is delayed, please let us know promptly; if we have not heard from you by that date, we may assume funding is no longer needed.\n\nA lot can happen between the day you receive your award letter and the day you complete your grant. You may need to change the location of your project. You may need to move your meeting to another city or take it online. Your topic may have shifted. If you have a Dissertation Fieldwork Grant, you may be working with a new supervisor. You may be affiliated with a new institution. You may have changed your name, your pronouns, or your contact information. Reach out to your program administrator. They will help you with the process.\n\nWe would love to publicize your accomplishments. As was the case with your application, we will treat your final reports, with the exception of your final abstract, as confidential. But if you provide us with photographs, films, or other materials created in connection with your project, we may want to use them on our website or for other purposes related to the Foundation’s activities. Unless you indicate otherwise, we will assume that you have given us permission to do so. We will also assume that we have your permission to use your name, a description of your research project, and the names of organizations you are associated with. If this is not the case, please let us know. And please only send us images that are ethically sourced, as described in our Standards of Practice for Photographs and Videos."
