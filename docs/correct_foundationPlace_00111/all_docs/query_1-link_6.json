        "text": "When I was 16, I worked as a software engineering intern at a company called uWink. uWink was a game developer for a restaurant chain based in Los Angeles.\n\nI used my experience from uWink to build a drive train for a robot which won the Los Angeles regional championship as part of FIRST Robotics Competition in the 2009 season.\n\nThe robotics win led to a referral as a rising sophomore to Applied Minds, a pioneer in robots, engineering, and design.\n\nApplied Minds was a wonderland of engineering marvels. My internship in 2011 introduced me to robotics, hardware and software engineering, mixed reality (MR) environments, and engineering design as a discipline.\n\nAs part of my Applied Minds internship, I built a digital signals processing platform. The platform triangulated the source of sounds using a microphone array, a beamforming algorithm, and an Arduino microcontroller.\n\nOne of my favorite memories from Applied Minds is meeting celebrated astronaut Story Musgrave for a lunch and learn meeting. He flew on many of the American space missions from the 1960s to the 1990s."
