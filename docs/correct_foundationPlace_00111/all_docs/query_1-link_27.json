        "text": "A growing number of clinical studies indicates that the therapeutic use of altered states of consciousness can be a promising addition to existing treatment options in mental health care. In Psychedelic-Augmented Psychotherapy, altered states of consciousness are purposefully induced to promote psychotherapeutic processes. Augmented Psychotherapy includes the following components:\n\nCareful screening of patients and treatment planning\n\nPreparatory therapy sessions to ensure safety and maximize therapeutic gains from altered states\n\nTherapy sessions that include an induction of altered states of consciousness using pharmacological (psilocybin, ketamine etc.) or non-pharmacological induction methods (breathwork, stroboscopic light etc.)\n\nIntegration-focused therapy sessions to help patients/clients draw therapeutic benefits from altered states\n\nIntegration-Focused Psychoherapy helps patients draw therapeutic benefits from psychedelic experiences that have taken place (or will take place) outside of the therapy setting while also minimizing potential harms.\n\nThe APT program takes a transtheoretical approach that aims to understand and conceptualize psychotherapeutic processes from an integrative perspective. No specific psychotherapeutic orientation or school is emphasized over others.\n\nEmpirical psychotherapy research has identified a number of common factors (also referred to as general change mechanisms) that are thought to underlie the effectiveness of all psychotherapies. Following this view, the distinct methods used in different schools of psychotherapy are thought to ultimately make use of the same therapeutic mechanisms. One particularly useful conceptualization of common factors was proposed by the psychotherapy researcher Klaus Grawe:\n\nResource activation\n\nTherapeutic relationship\n\nProblem activation\n\nMotivational clarification/clarification of meaning\n\nMastery/coping\n\nIn our experience, the common factors perspective allows for productive discussions across different psychotherapeutic schools and traditions. It is also immensely helpful for understanding and making optimal use of the therapeutic potential of altered states of consciousness. The common factors perspective is therefore strongly emphasized in the APT program.\n\nThe APT program includes of a total of 3 intensive training weeks in Berlin, Germany (see dates for the next English APT course here) and continuous online training sessions (lectures, journal club, mentoring sessions, and meditation training). Online sessions take place weekly on Thursdays (19:30 CET/CEST). No classes are held during the Christmas holiday season.\n\nThe program also includes the on-demand course Molecules that participants can attend in their own time. Participants are also required to participate in the MIND Foundation’s integration workshop Beyond Experience. If you have completed Molecules and/or Beyond Experience before enrolling in APT, you will be granted a corresponding discount on the tuition. Learn more about teaching contents and formats in APT here.\n\nThe three intensive training weeks take place on-site in Berlin, Germany. Since the intensive trainings include many experiential contents such as role-play, exercises, and self-experience with altered states (ketamine, breathwork, etc.), it is not possible to attend these trainings remotely.\n\nIf you miss an on-site training for reasons such as illness or travel restrictions, you will be allowed to attend it a year later with the next APT course.\n\nIf you miss an on-site training for reasons such as illness or COVID-related travel restrictions, you will be allowed to attend it a year later with the next APT course.\n\nTo become certified, participants are required to attend a minimum of 80% of the program.\n\nAfter successfully completing the APT Program, participants are awarded a certificate in Psychedelic Therapy – Integration-Focused Psychotherapy (IFP) and Psychedelic-Augmented Psychotherapy (PAP). Depending on their professional background, certified professionals are qualified to work independently and lead multiprofessional teams providing psychedelic therapy, or to work in such multiprofessional teams under the supervision of a medical doctor with training in psychotherapy or licensed psychotherapist. The certificate covers breathwork-, ketamine-, and psychedelic-augmented psychotherapy. However, the certificate does not legally entitle you to work with medications or other pharmacological substances. This authorization is acquired through country- and region-specific approbations and subject to corresponding legal regulations. We strictly require all APT participants to comply with the legal regulations applicable at their respective place of work.\n\nThe APT program teaches therapists to purposefully induce altered states of consciousness to promote psychotherapeutic processes. We teach different methods for inducing altered states of consciousness. Some of these methods are completely free to be used, and others are legally regulated. While non-pharmacological methods are at your disposal wherever you practice, ketamine-augmented psychotherapy should be available to you in most jurisdictions if you team up with a medical doctor or hold a medical license yourself. In most countries, the use of classical psychedelics such as psilocybin is still restricted to clinical studies and (in some counties) so-called “compassionate use” licenses. However, with the imminent approval of several psychedelic substances, the legal situation in many countries is likely to change substantially in the next few years. We explicitly do not train underground therapists, but professionals who adhere to the given legal frameworks.\n\nMembers of the OVID Clinic or EPIsoDE study teams are involved in the APT program as faculty. If you are currently a patient of either of these treatment teams, you cannot (yet) participate in APT since this will most likely lead to problematic role conflicts. If you have been a patient of the OVID clinic or the EPIsoDE study in the past, you may be able to participate in the APT program. However, you must inform the APT Program Committee during the admission process that you have been a patient of one of these teams in the past. This is the only way to examine whether problematic role conflicts may still arise and, if so, how they can be avoided. If you have any questions or doubts in this regard, please contact the APT Office ([email protected])."
