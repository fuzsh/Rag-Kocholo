The early careers team played a pivotal role in preparing me for success and encouraging me to chase my dreams no matter what. My experience was fantastic and helped me to build bridges that lead to my conversion to Full time employee at the studio. The Early careers programs commitment to diversifying the intern program, and by extension DreamWorks at large is no small feat. Their belief in young talent and dedication to passionate creatives like me inspired me as an HBCU Grad to pursue a career in animation. My DreamWorks internship not only encouraged me to go after my goals but emboldened me to dream even bigger, reach even higher, and do so much more!”\n\n- Myles, Former TV Development Production Intern, Summer 2022\n\nCurrent Assistant to the Producer/Director\n\n“Interning at Dreamworks was amazing! The program exceeded my expectations and provided a supportive environment that encouraged me to grow and explore my interests. This opportunity allowed me to network with industry professionals, learn about the industry, and practice valuable skills that directly translated into early career responsibilities.”\n\n- Kendall, Former TV Production Intern, Fall 2021\n\nCurrent TV Production Assistant\n\n“Through my internship I was tasked with various hands-on responsibilities that luckily already made me feel like I was an integral part of the team. I think getting to take on those responsibilities as an intern made the transition into becoming a full-time Production Assistant smooth. The team I interned with were always willing to answer my questions and walk me through any processes I might've had trouble with. They did such a wonderful job with training me that once I was brought on full-time, the only big difference was that I worked 5 days a week instead of 3 (which was very exciting).”\n\n- Ellie, Former Feature Production Intern, Summer 2022\n\nCurrent Feature Production Assistant\n\n“I had applied for the program because I was looking for an opportunity to break into the animation industry after leaving my almost 10 year career in banking in 2018, going back to school the same year after an 8 year hiatus and finally graduating in May of last year. I completed my internship in April, 2022 with the Gabby's Dollhouse Team and was offered a permanent position two weeks before it ended and I was absolutely on cloud nine! After many, many years I was finally working in the industry that I had wanted to be in since I was young. I had made the first part of my dream come true!”\n\n- Mike, Former TV Production Intern, Summer 2022\n\nCurrent TV Production Assistant\n\n“During the 12 weeks, I had the great opportunity to work on Abominable with an amazingly talented crew while building my portfolio pieces under the mentorship of an art director on TV. Every week, I received invaluable feedback on my production/personal work from my art director and mentor. The program provided me with so many helpful learning resources through virtual workshops and lectures. I got to connect with many professionals through the program as well. It was definitely beyond my expectations!”\n\n- Jiyoung, Former TV Art Trainee, Summer 2022\n\nCurrent TV Visual Development Artist\n\n“The Trainee Program allowed me to refine my work and the skills I already cultivated in a live production environment. I was encouraged to experiment and fail as often as I could by my mentors, and I was willing to do so knowing I had a safety net woven from their vast experiences to lean on. I got to make mistakes and learn quickly, as well as meaningfully contribute to the production. I've just finished up my first year as a full-time Storyboard Revisionist on Dragons: The Nine Realms, and I couldn't be more thankful for the work I get to do every day.”\n\n- Chad, Former TV Story Trainee, Summer 2021\n\nCurrent TV Storyboard Revisionist\n\n“DreamWorks has always been a staple of my childhood since I watched Shrek in theaters at a young age. Of course, being accepted to the DreamWorks Internship Program was an absolute dream! Working as an intern was a learning experience that eventually prepared me to understand the ins and outs of the industry. There are too many moments that I cherished during my internship but my favorite one has to be the day when the interns collectively painted murals for Franklin Elementary School. Not only was it a day of creativity, but it was also a heartwarming day where we knew that the students would appreciate the outcome of their new library! Not only did this program help me prepare myself production-wise, but it eventually landed me a job as a production assistant, to production coordinator, and ultimately as the new Vis Dev Artist for Gabby's Dollhouse! I am extremely thankful for the journey it took me to where I am now! I honestly could not have done it without the amazing internship program and the people I have met throughout my career. Thank you, Early Career Team!”\n\n- Eugene, Former Custom Animation Intern, Summer 2020\n\nCurrent TV Visual Development Artist\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCandidates must be pursuing an Associate, Bachelor or Graduate degree at a College/University (or equivalent), or be a recent graduate (within six months of graduation date).\n\nCandidates must be a recent graduate or entry-level (up to five years out of school), re-entering the workforce or pivoting from other industries.\n\nCandidates must be pursuing an Associate, Bachelor or Graduate degree at a College/University (or equivalent), or be a recent graduate (within six months of graduation date).\n\nYes, international students are eligible to apply as long as you are able to provide documentation to legally work in the United States throughout the duration of your U.S. based internship.\n\nThe Internship Program is 10 weeks long and offered three times a year: Spring, Summer, and Fall.
