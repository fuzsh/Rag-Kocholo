Our commitment translates into a set of actions to make a positive impact on the lives of people and communities around the world.\n\nPhilanthropy is an integral part of our approach to address the health needs of vulnerable populations in countries around the world.Â\n\nIn recent years, partly through the former Sanofi Espoir Foundation, we have focused on improving outcomes for children living with cancer and donating our products in crisis situations, when and where they are needed most.\n\nBut today, we see new challenges, and so we are renewing our commitment to continue to serve future generations. This engagement focuses on where we can have the greatest impact and where we can scale up and sustain our efforts over time.\n\nWith this spirit, we are proud to present Foundation S â The Sanofi Collective, the new philanthropic organization of Sanofi, which was launched in May of 2022."
