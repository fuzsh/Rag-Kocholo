Lindner College of Business, Victoria Mrofchak stands out not just for her academic excellence but for her remarkable blend of creativity and business acumen. A fourth-year marketing major with a minor in management and fine arts, scholarships help Mrofchak shape her future at the intersection of art and commerce.\n\nGrace Hall’s journey from National Guard to nursing school\n\nAs a dedicated member of the Army National Guard while balancing classes at the University of Cincinnati, Grace Hall has navigated a challenging but rewarding path toward her ultimate goal — a nursing degree. Her journey, marked by military service and academic excellence, reflects her unwavering commitment to making a difference in the medical field.\n\nCaring Connections: How scholarship support inspires next...\n\nDymond Robinson and Tate Coleman, spring graduates of the University of Cincinnati James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy, are driven by their passion to help others. The newly minted pharmacists are grateful for those who supported their educational journeys, sharing that scholarships have been vital to their success.\n\nUC grad turns humanities degree into entrepreneurial success\n\nGrowing up on Ludlow Ave. in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton, Harrison Fowler had planned to enroll in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Cincinnati. UC was close to home, and ROTC seemed like the right choice. But life had other plans. At the last minute, Fowler withdrew from ROTC and enrolled to earn his bachelor’s in Spanish, which meant he needed a study-abroad experience to complete his degree. He was apprehensive, but completed his requirement in Madrid, in a move that would change the direction of his life. Says Fowler of his foreign-language major, and his experience abroad: “Speaking another language opens up a whole other world and relationships for you.”\n\nScholarship success: Two UC grads shine at spring commencement\n\nIn a testament to the transformative power of education and financial support, Precious Randall and Corin Manning, recent graduates of the University of Cincinnati, have emerged as shining examples of success. Each graduated with bachelor's degrees from CECH in spring of 2024, but what sets them apart is not just their academic prowess; it's their remarkable journey made possible by scholarships that paved their paths to success.\n\nFrom communication degree to corporate entrepreneur\n\nMany communication and public relations majors have careers in mind before they graduate from college, but few may aspire to careers in logistics. But Nick Reasoner, who graduated from UC’s College of Arts and Sciences with degrees in both, forged his path there, and went on to found TransLoop, an award-winning third-party logistics firm. Headquartered in Chicago, TransLoop now has five additional locations, from Nashville to Ft. Lauderdale to Denver. Since its founding, the company has taken the number 12 spot on Inc. 5000’s list of Fastest Growing Private Companies in America, and Reasoner has been named to Business Elite’s 40 Under 40.\n\nUC grad shares path to success, from biochemistry to corporate...\n\nAs an undergrad in UC’s College of Arts and Sciences, majoring in biochemistry, Sujata Malhotra dreamed of going to medical school. But upon graduation she decided to go into the food and beverage industry, beginning her career at Cargill, Inc. She held various positions — quality assurance chemist, technical services manager, sales manager — while earning a master’s in business administration from Capital University, focusing on international marketing.\n\nLindner alumnus Xander Wells named Mr. Bearcat\n\nXander Wells approached his college experience with the idea that he’d rather depart the University of Cincinnati wishing he had done less than wishing he had done more. Mission accomplished for the recipient of the 2024 Mr. Bearcat award, as selected by UC honorary fraternity Sigma Sigma.\n\nTeeing off a new tradition with UC’s Ed Latessa Memorial Golf...\n\nOn April 23, 2024, members of the University of Cincinnati’s School of Criminal Justice, part of the College of Education, Criminal Justice, Human Services, and Information Technology (CECH), gathered with family and friends at Glenview Golf Course in Glendale, Ohio, for a round of golf. This wasn’t just any day on the greens, though – this was the inaugural Ed Latessa Memorial Golf Tournament."
