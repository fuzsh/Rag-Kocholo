Alexander founded The Interval, and The Organizational Continuity Project, and has facilitated The Rosetta Project, Long Bets, Seminars About Long Term Thinking, Long Server and others. Alexander shares several design patents on the 10,000 Year Clock with Danny Hillis. He writes about building artefacts and institutions that last, co-curates the Long Now Seminars, as well as The Conversations at The Interval and some talks at The Battery SF. Alexander is also an advisor to the METI project. Alexander lives in Marin County, California, and enjoys mountain biking, mountaineering and other outdoor activities.[10]\n\nProjects[]\n\nClock of the Long Now[]\n\nThe Clock of the Long Now is an all mechanical clock designed to keep time for 10,000 years. In 01998, Danny Hillis asked some friends to make sketches of what they imagined a 10,000-year clock should look like.[11] Hillis and a crew developed engineering designs for the Long Now 10,000-year Clock. They plan to build the Clock inside Mount Washington, Nevada, at the end of a long vertical tunnel entrance. It was designed with the principles of longevity, maintainability, transparency, evolvability, and scalability. In 01999, Long Now purchased 180 acres on Mount Washington, covered by ancient bristlecones, for the 10,000 Year Clock.[12][13] The clock powers itself, harnessing the day-to-night temperature shift and the piezoelectricity of ground quartz, and synchronizes itself. On the summer solstice (June 21st), the sun shines straight down the shaft and warms a part of the clock up, so it can adjust itself to that moment and stay on time. It displays the position of the sun and the moon and the stars, which move around as the clock goes. The clock accounts for the slowing of the earth and the melting of the icecaps.[14]\n\n[15]\n\nThe clock includes a Solar Synchroniser,[16] a Chime Generator that has been programmed to not repeat a chime for 10,000 years,[17] and a Speed Governor, which gears and moderates energy coming out of the power system, and only spins up when the chimes are ringing.[18]\n\nSeminars About Long Term Thinking[]\n\nThe Long Now Foundation hosts Seminars About Long Term Thinking (SALT). Long Now's first ever seminar was given by co-founder Brian Eno in 2003. It was titled \"The Long Now.\"[19] All of the past seminars, which often end with Q&As, were made available on YouTube in the summer of 02020.[20] Seminars have been given by people including Neil Gaiman and Sean Carroll. The seminars, summarized by Stewart Brand, are available in a book,[21] written with Kevin Kelly, Alexander Rose and Paul Saffo, and a foreword by Brian Eno.[22] The seminars (The Long Now Seminars, and Conversations at The Interval) are also available as podcasts.[23]\n\nThe Interval[]\n\nThe Interval is a bar, café, museum, and venue in the Fort Mason Center.[24] They host talks,[25] and have a floor-to-ceiling library of books that might be needed to rebuild civilization, mechanical prototypes for the 10,000 year clock, art that continually evolves in real time, and a time-inspired menu of artisan drinks.[26]\n\nLong Bets[]\n\nThe Long Bets website is an arena for competitive, accountable predictions \"of societal or scientific importance,” and a forum for focused discussion and debate about prediction. Participants have to use their real names, so they take personal responsibility for their ideas and opinions, and stand up for what they think. Like the predictions, a vote is “a permanent record of a judgement made at moment in time”. Anyone is welcome to cruise around the website anonymously. The project began in 02003, and it donates money to charitable causes.[27] Betting where bettors keep the money winnings is defined as gambling and is illegal throughout the United States. Though some may do it informally, a formal service like Long Bets cannot. Having the winnings become philanthropic gifts solves the legal problem and also introduces a charitable element to the process.[28]\n\nThe Rosetta Project[]\n\nThe Rosetta Project is a global collaboration of linguists and native speakers working to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages.[29] They created The Rosetta Disk, a three inch diameter nickel disk with nearly 14,000 pages of information microscopically etched onto its surface. Since each page is an image, rather than a binary code, it can be read by the human eye using 500 power optical magnification. The disk rests in a sphere made of stainless steel and glass which allows the disk exposure to the atmosphere, but protects it from casual impact and abrasion. There is a wearable version,[30] and a disc on board the European Space Agency’s Rosetta Probe.[31] The Long Now Foundation began by creating a key, a kind of \"decoder ring\" for any information humanity might leave behind, written in any language. The Rosetta Disk collection has as its core a set of \"parallel\" information - the same texts, the same set of vocabulary, and the same kinds of description, for over 1,000 human languages. The idea was inspired by the Rosetta Stone. The Rosetta Project collection has over 100,000 pages of documents, and language recordings, for over 2,500 languages. The collection is housed as a special collection in the Internet Archive, and they continue to expand the collection. The Rosetta Project has a principle of open access - all of the contents in the digital archive are publicly available, and all of the structured information they collect and maintain about languages and their speakers is freely available for download and reuse. The Rosetta Project also serves to draw attention to the loss of the world’s languages.[32]\n\nPanLex[]\n\nPanLex is a database enabling anyone in the world, regardless of their language, to communicate and exercise their rights. PanLex is a panlingual database (built to contain every language), and lexical (focused on words, not sentences). The mission of PanLex is to overcome language barriers to human rights, information, and opportunities. The team target under-served language communities, international humanitarian organizations, and global businesses to explore what practical problems PanLex can address. They work closely with the Rosetta Project. PanLex became a sponsored nonprofit project of the Long Now Foundation in 2012.[33]\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“The Long Now is the recognition that the precise moment you’re in grows out of the past and is a seed for the future.” - Brian Eno, a member of the Board of Directors.[34]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere is a play, titled The Long Now, inspired by The Long Now Foundation.[35]"
