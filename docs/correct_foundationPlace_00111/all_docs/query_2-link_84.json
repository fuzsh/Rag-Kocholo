        "text": "The Carnegie African Diaspora Fellowship Program (CADFP) is a scholar fellowship program for educational projects at African higher education institutions. Offered by IIE, the program is funded by a grant from Carnegie Corporation of New York (CCNY). A total of 705 African Diaspora Fellowships have been awarded for scholars to travel to Africa since the program’s inception in 2013. CADFP exemplifies CCNY’s enduring commitment to higher education in Africa. IIE manages and administers the program, including applications, project requests and fellowships.\n\nThe CADFP application cycle for Project Requests will open on July 15, 2024 and close on September 18, 2024.\n\nApplying to the CADFP\n\nThe Carnegie African Diaspora Fellowship Program (CADFP) is a fellowship program for African institutions in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and member institutions of the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA) and partner universities with the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA) to host an African-born scholar to work on projects in research collaboration, graduate student teaching/mentoring and curriculum co-development. The application process has two parts.\n\nHosts\n\nAccredited African universities in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and member institutions of the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA) and partner universities with the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA) can submit a project request to host an African-born scholar currently living in the United States or Canada to work on projects in research collaboration, graduate student teaching/mentoring and curriculum co-development. The host institution can collaborate with a specific scholar on the project request or submit without naming a scholar. If the host submits without naming a scholar, IIE will search their Roster of qualified candidates to be matched to the request.\n\nScholars\n\nAfrican-born academics currently living in the United States or Canada and working at institutions of higher education can submit a Scholar Application to the Scholar Roster. The scholar can work with a specific host institution on a Project Request or remain on the roster until a project that fits their expertise is submitted by an African host institution.\n\nSocial Media\n\nConnect with the CADFP on social media to stay updated with program news, announcements, and updates. Please email AfricanDiaspora@iie.org to be added to the program contact list to receive updates.\n\nSponsor\n\nThe Carnegie African Diaspora Program is funded by a grant from Carnegie Corporation of New York (CCNY)"
