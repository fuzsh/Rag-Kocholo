        "text": "What Physical Therapist Assistants Do\n\nPhysical therapist assistants help physical therapist in the treatment of individuals of all ages, from newborns to people at the end of life. Many patients have injuries, disabilities, or other health conditions that need treatment.\n\nA physical therapist will examine the patient and develop a treatment plan to improve their ability to move, reduce or manage pain, restore function, and prevent disability. Physical therapist assistant will work with the patient to implement the treatment plan, collect data, and provide feedback to the physical therapist.\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can have a profound effect on people's lives. They help people achieve movement goals, regain or maintain their independence, and lead active lives.\n\nVisit ChoosePT.com, APTA's official consumer information website, to learn more about the benefits of physical therapy.\n\nWhere Physical Therapist Assistants Work\n\nThe vast majority of physical therapist assistants, approximately 72%, work in hospitals or privately-owned (outpatient) physical therapy practices. Others work in home health, schools, and skilled nursing or long-term care facilities.\n\nHow Much Physical Therapist Assistants Earn\n\nThe median income for a physical therapist assistant is $62,770. Salaries vary based on position, years of experience, degree of education, geographic location, and practice setting.\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Education and Licensure\n\nTo work as a physical therapist assistant in the United States, you must graduate from a Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education-accredited physical therapist assistant education program and pass a state-administered national exam to obtain licensure or certification required in most states.\n\nThe average length of a PTA program is typically two years (five semesters). Primary content areas in the curriculum may include, but are not limited to anatomy, physiology, exercise physiology, biomechanics, kinesiology, neuroscience, clinical pathology, behavioral sciences, communication, and ethics/values.\n\nApproximately 75% of the PTA curriculum is classroom (didactic) and lab study and the remaining 25% is dedicated to clinical education. PTA students spend on average 16 weeks in full-time clinical education experiences.\n\nChoosing the Right Program\n\nAPTA does not rank PTA education programs. Programs are accredited by CAPTE, which assures quality in physical therapist assistant education. Among the factors you should keep in mind when choosing your program:\n\nCost and financial aid opportunities. Many PTA students graduate with student loans. Make sure that you are financially aware and prepared. Programs offer different student experiences and have different costs. APTA does offer scholarships and awards to eligible PTA students.\n\nDemographics and setting. Pursing PTA education will be an investment of your time and resources. Make sure that you select a program where you feel at home.\n\nYou may wish to contact current students and recent graduates of the program or interview employers who hire graduates to ask about program strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAdmissions\n\nEntry-level physical therapist assistant education programs are offered at the associate degree level.\n\nAPTA launched the Physical Therapist Assistant Centralized Application Service (PTACAS) in 2020 to help simplify the application process to physical therapist assistant programs. Applicants can apply to multiple PTA programs through this service using a single application. Not all PTA programs accept the PTACAS application at this time.\n\nA list of programs accepting applications through PTACAS can be found via the link below. If the program to which you are interested in applying is not on the list of participating programs, you will apply directly to the program.\n\nView PTACAS Programs\n\nAccess non-particpating accredited PTA programs\n\nLearn more about PTACAS\n\nAfter Graduation\n\nPhysical therapist assistants have the opportunity to increase their knowledge and skills through APTA's PTA Advanced Proficiency Pathways program. Content areas are acute care, cardiovascular/pulmonary, geriatrics, neurology, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, and wound management.\n\nParticipants receive guidance from a self-designated clinical mentor who has expertise in the content area. The program is voluntary; PTAs are not required to participate in order to work in a specific area."
