        "text": "Background information expands upon the key points stated in the beginning of your introduction but is not intended to be the main focus of the paper. It generally supports the question, what is the most important information the reader needs to understand before continuing to read the paper? Sufficient background information helps the reader determine if you have a basic understanding of the research problem being investigated and promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and findings. This information provides the reader with the essential context needed to conceptualize the research problem and its significance before moving on to a more thorough analysis of prior research.\n\nForms of contextualization included in background information can include describing one or more of the following:\n\nCultural -- placed within the learned behavior of a specific group or groups of people.\n\nEconomic -- of or relating to systems of production and management of material wealth and/or business activities.\n\nGender -- located within the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with being self-identified as male, female, or other form of gender expression.\n\nHistorical -- the time in which something takes place or was created and how the condition of time influences how you interpret it.\n\nInterdisciplinary -- explanation of theories, concepts, ideas, or methodologies borrowed from other disciplines applied to the research problem rooted in a discipline other than the discipline where your paper resides.\n\nPhilosophical -- clarification of the essential nature of being or of phenomena as it relates to the research problem.\n\nPhysical/Spatial -- reflects the meaning of space around something and how that influences how it is understood.\n\nPolitical -- concerns the environment in which something is produced indicating it's public purpose or agenda.\n\nSocial -- the environment of people that surrounds something's creation or intended audience, reflecting how the people associated with something use and interpret it.\n\nTemporal -- reflects issues or events of, relating to, or limited by time. Concerns past, present, or future contextualization and not just a historical past.\n\nBackground information can also include summaries of important research studies. This can be a particularly important element of providing background information if an innovative or groundbreaking study about the research problem laid a foundation for further research or there was a key study that is essential to understanding your arguments. The priority is to summarize for the reader what is known about the research problem before you conduct the analysis of prior research. This is accomplished with a general summary of the foundational research literature [with citations] that document findings that inform your study's overall aims and objectives.\n\nNOTE: Research studies cited as part of the background information of your introduction should not include very specific, lengthy explanations. This should be discussed in greater detail in your literature review section. If you find a study requiring lengthy explanation, consider moving it to the literature review section.\n\nANOTHER NOTE: In some cases, your paper's introduction only needs to introduce the research problem, explain its significance, and then describe a road map for how you are going to address the problem; the background information basically forms the introduction part of your literature review. That said, while providing background information is not required, including it in the introduction is a way to highlight important contextual information that could otherwise be hidden or overlooked by the reader if placed in the literature review section.\n\nYET ANOTHER NOTE: In some research studies, the background information is described in a separate section after the introduction and before the literature review. This is most often done if the topic is especially complex or requires a lot of context in order to fully grasp the significance of the research problem. Most college-level research papers do not require this unless required by your professor. However, if you find yourself needing to write more than a couple of pages [double-spaced lines] to provide the background information, it can be written as a separate section to ensure the introduction is not too lengthy.\n\nBackground of the Problem Section: What do you Need to Consider?

University of New Mexico.\n\nProviding background information in the introduction of a research paper serves as a bridge that links the reader to the research problem. Precisely how long and in-depth this bridge should be is largely dependent upon how much information you think the reader will need to know in order to fully understand the problem being discussed and to appreciate why the issues you are investigating are important.\n\nFrom another perspective, the length and detail of background information also depends on the degree to which you need to demonstrate to your professor how much you understand the research problem. Keep this in mind because providing pertinent background information can be an effective way to demonstrate that you have a clear grasp of key issues, debates, and concepts related to your overall study.\n\nThe structure and writing style of your background information can vary depending upon the complexity of your research and/or the nature of the assignment. However, in most cases it should be limited to only one to two paragraphs in your introduction.\n\nGiven this, here are some questions to consider while writing this part of your introduction:\n\nAre there concepts, terms, theories, or ideas that may be unfamiliar to the reader and, thus, require additional explanation?\n\nAre there historical elements that need to be explored in order to provide needed context, to highlight specific people, issues, or events, or to lay a foundation for understanding the emergence of a current issue or event?\n\nAre there theories, concepts, or ideas borrowed from other disciplines or academic traditions that may be unfamiliar to the reader and therefore require further explanation?\n\nIs there a key study or small set of studies that set the stage for understanding the topic and frames why it is important to conduct further research on the topic?\n\nIs the research study unusual in a way that requires additional explanation, such as,\n\nYour study uses a method of analysis never applied before;\n\nYour study investigates a very esoteric or complex research problem;\n\nYour study introduces new or unique variables that need to be taken into account; or,\n\nYour study relies upon analyzing unique texts or documents, such as, archival materials or primary documents like diaries or personal letters that do not represent the established body of source literature on the topic?\n\nAlmost all introductions to a research problem require some contextualizing, but the scope and breadth of background information varies depending on your assumption about the reader's level of prior knowledge. However, despite this assessment, background information should be brief and succinct and sets the stage for the elaboration of critical points or in-depth discussion of key issues in the literature review section of your paper.\n\nBackground of the Problem Section: What do you Need to Consider?
