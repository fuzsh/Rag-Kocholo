        "text": "Background\n\nDeveloping Minds Foundation aims to revitalize inner city areas in the United States by offering transformational learning experiences for youth at highest risk of becoming involved in behaviors that are destructive to themselves and the rest of society. We work to educate young boys and girls about constructive alternatives to gang activity, violence, and crime so that they may build for their futures.\n\nProject\n\nIn the Miami neighborhoods of Liberty City, Overtown and Little Haiti, we offer a combination of basic education and personal development workshops to instruct those who demonstrate characteristics of high risk behavior. Applying similar innovative educational approaches proven in our projects in Latin America’s violent neighborhoods, we seek to address core issues in the United States that frequently lead to violence and poverty – lack of education, lack of opportunity, hopelessness, lack of positive guidance."
