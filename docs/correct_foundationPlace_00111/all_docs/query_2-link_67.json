We strive to engage YOU in different ways, which helps us better understand who you are, what you are looking for, and how we can best serve you. Our enrollment process is a journey aimed at providing you with an experience that helps you understand what you are signing up for and providing you and us with enough information to make informed decisions!\n\nOur process:\n\nSubmit an application via the Youth Portal. (You will need to submit all eligibility documentation via the Youth Portal in order to successfully submit your application.)\n\nSign up for an intake/placement interview with one of our dedicated staff members. You will receive an invite to sign up once your application has been fully verified by one of our dedicated staff members.\n\nAttend your interview. This is a semi-formal interview. More information will be provided at the time of the invite so you can best prepare!\n\nAccept your placement!* (Upon being offered a placement which is based on information provided at your interview, you will need to formally accept your placement by a certain date to secure your spot in the program.)\n\nComplete all post-placement onboarding requirements (submission of HR documentation; submission of testing documentation; completion of background check)\n\n*Please note: due to availability, not all prospective applicants will be provided a placement into the program(s).\n\nHow to Be Successful During Your Intake/Placement Interview\n\nWe herald ourselves in creating a holistic process where everyone can bring their full selves and be able to be evaluated on the qualities that make an individual whole. We use our intake and placement process as a guiding tool to inform our decisions when deciding entry into our program(s). Below are some tips to help you be successful during the placement/intake process.\n\nBe Responsive and On-Time: When receiving an invitation to meet with one of our dedicated staff members via an intake/placement interview, it is imperative that you select the best time that works for you and that you show up on time. This not only helps us plan for the time we will spend with you but also gives you the opportunity to make a great first impression—showing up on time and ready is what sets the tone for how we will engage with one another moving forward.\n\nTreat This Like A Job Interview: Though you are not applying for a traditional job, per se, you are interviewing for a paid opportunity. When coming to the interview, you will want to make sure you are in the right space (with minimal distractions), have stable internet, wear presentable clothing, and come with a positive attitude. You may never know where this interview opportunity could lead—each staff member comes in with their own skillset as well as network; you may interview with someone that may want to introduce you to the CEO of Boeing.\n\nAnswer Questions Thoroughly: Provide as much detail as possible. This is our chance to get to know you and may be the first time we are interacting with you. Give us as much information as possible so that we can make an informed decision, as well as be able to advocate for you!\n\nPractice: Even before an interview, you will want to ensure you practice. Though this may not be a very formal interview for a job, you will want to treat it as such. Take time to practice what you will say prior to the placement/intake interview. You may find interest in googling some common interview questions and noting what you might say to them.\n\nView Employer FAQ\n\nWhat We Are Looking For?\n\nOpportunities to support youth and young adults in their career journey by providing in-demand internship opportunities. Per our participant data, youth are looking for employment opportunities and experiences in some of the following career fields:\n\nHealth Care\n\nTechnology Industry\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nS.T.E.M.\n\nPublic Sector\n\nCreative Arts\n\nWays to Get Involved\n\nHost an Intern\n\nWe have two types of internship opportunities we offer participants: Pathways and Foundations.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nSubmit An Interest Form via the Interest Form link, which will alert the SYEP Employer Engagement team of your interest and will initiate the application process.\n\nRegister a user account in our Employer Portal. Once we receive your interest form, one of our staffers will send you a personal invitation to our Employer Portal, where you can create an account that will allow you to submit an application to host interns.\n\nSubmit a completed application through the Employer Portal and upload any required documentation in support of your completed application.\n\nAfter Submitting an Application\n\nThe Employer Engagement team will review applications for completion. If we need of any additional information, we will reach out prior to our application deadline. Once the deadline has passed, we will begin our interview and matching process (April-early May) with the prospective interns.\n\nIn early May, we will reach out to all prospective employer sites regarding their application status. Those that receive an intern will be able to then check in the Employer Portal (using your User Account login) and indicate how many youth have been placed and their contact information. If you have been selected to host an intern, you will follow the steps below for Internship Readiness.\n\nInternship Readiness Steps:\n\nComplete, sign, and submit the Agency Agreement Contract, Supervisor Agreement, and Background Check* all via our Adobe Sign webforms provided to you in the Next Steps e-mail.\n\nParticipate in a site visit where one of our dedicated staff members will review your completed, signed paperwork, go over logistics, and preview the space interns will be occupying.\n\nPlan and share the work plan you envision for the intern(s). You can submit your workplan or first week plenary with your assigned SYEP staff member.\n\nAttend all required site supervisor trainings hosted by the SYEP program team.\n\nPlease note, as much as we would like to host every interested employing site, we cannot guarantee placement of interns at every site due to intern onboarding completion, intern removal or dropping from program and/or a limited number of interns or interest in a particular internship.\n\nFacilitate as a Subject Matter Expert\n\nIf you have an area of expertise that you would like to share with our program participants, we offer a Learn and Earn program during the fall to springtime during which we facilitate weekly workshops on career and job skill development. Some examples of workshops facilitated in previous cohort years and are of interest to our participants are:\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nFinancial Literacy\n\nImposter Syndrome\n\n“A Day in the Life” (in a specific role)\n\nHealthy Relationships\n\nCode Switching\n\nInterviewing\n\nIf there are any other ways you would like to support SYEP youth (e.g., mentorship, job shadowing), please reach out to our engagement team via e-mail: syepemprelations@seattle.gov."
