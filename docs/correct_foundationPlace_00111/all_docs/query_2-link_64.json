The music icon will take the stage for a live conversation about what scientists and philosophers for centuries have called “the eel question” alongside perhaps the greatest cultural authority on the topic, The Book of Eels author Patrik Svensson.\n\nDavid’s interest in “the eel question” adds to an ever-increasing range of pursuits that now includes two Broadway shows and an interactive neuroscience exhibit at Denver’s Center for the Performing Arts. The Book of Eels has amassed a long list of distinctions and awards for its meditation on our enduring fascination with “the most mysterious creature in the natural world.” Even in today’s age of advanced science, no one has ever seen eels mating or giving birth, and we still don’t understand what drives them — after living for decades in freshwater — to swim great distances back to the ocean at the end of their lives.\n\nThis live taping for the Sing for Science podcast is moderated by the show’s host, Matt Whyte. Ticket price includes a copy of The Book of Eels and book signing with the author following the taping.\n\nListen to Sing for Science on Spotify!
