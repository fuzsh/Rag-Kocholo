        "text": "Since 1962 the Host Program has provided an opportunity for connection and friendship between Harvard international graduate students who are new to the United States and residents who live in the Boston area. Residents in turn benefit from exposure to the wealth of cultures that come from around the world to study here at Harvard.\n\nWe invite prospective students and hosts to read the information below to gain a better understanding of what the Host Program entails. There are also school specific programs throughout Harvard for which students may qualify; check directly with your individual school to see if it has a host program.\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)\n\nWho are the students participating in the program?\n\nPriority is given to international graduate students who have never lived in the United States before. The overall goal is to match all international graduate students who apply.\n\nHow does a student apply?\n\nIf you are an international graduate student and would like to apply to the Host Program, you can access the application here.\n\nHow long does it take to be matched?\n\nMost student applications are received by the end of June. Hosts are contacted regarding potential student matches. The matching process may take time depending on when student applications are received, the host's interests, and their summer vacation schedules. The Host Program attempts to match the majority of students prior to the start of the fall semester.\n\nAre hosts paid?\n\nNo, their participation in this program is purely voluntary. Their goal is to be helpful in a friendly and supportive way.\n\nWhat do hosts do?\n\nHosts help students in many different ways. They may assist with both the exciting and overwhelming process of settling in and becoming acclimated to new surroundings. While hosts do not provide housing, they may offer occasional meals, interesting outings, stimulating conversations, encouraging words, or holiday celebrations. Students also are encouraged to invite their hosts to university events, to go out for walks, to prepare a dish from their country, etc. In addition, the Host Program organizes a few informal activities during the year where hosts and students can come together.\n\nWhat activities do hosts do with students?\n\nHosts may share a wide variety of activities with their students. They may invite students to participate in activities that they (the hosts) enjoy doing as well as introduce students to the local area and culture. In addition, through conversations hosts can find out about their students' interests. Hosts may discover some interesting and surprising activities that the students enjoy doing back home and would like to continue doing here in the U.S.\n\nWho are the hosts?\n\nHosts are Boston area residents who reflect the diverse society in the U.S. They live in local communities and come from many different backgrounds. They vary in age and may be single, couples, or families with children. Many hosts have Harvard affiliations (Harvard alumni, employees, retirees), but a Harvard affiliation is not required to be a host for this program.\n\nWhat makes a match successful?\n\nEach student-host pairing is unique. It is the students and their hosts who create the building blocks for a mutually rewarding friendship. Such friendship can enormously enrich life outside of academics. It may, in fact, last years beyond the student's time at Harvard!\n\nHow much time is required of hosts?\n\nThere is no set requirement for how much time hosts should spend with their students. It will depend on the hosts' and students' schedules. More time will likely be spent at the beginning of the student's stay and during the fall semester. As the academic year progresses, students will likely have less time available. It is critical to pay attention to the needs of students in the beginning because it is when the foundation is being established for the relationship.\n\nCan a host have more than one student?\n\nYes! The number of student applications usually outweighs the number of available hosts. Some hosts have found that hosting two (or more) students is actually easier. If they are from different countries, interesting conversations can occur when comparing experiences.\n\nWhat are the financial expectations of hosting?\n\nHosting should not be a costly endeavor. Shared activities and events do not need to be elaborate/expensive. Hosts should communicate with their students regarding payment expectations for any activities or outings (e.g. museum visits, concert tickets, etc.). Managing expectations is important to avoid confusion and misunderstandings.\n\nSince the hosting obligation is for one year, how do hosts handle students who are here for a longer period?\n\nStudents are aware that the program is for one year. If a strong friendship develops, that is great. However, the Host Program coordinator will be hoping that hosts are still available to host a new student for the coming academic year. Experience has shown that during the second year the meetings are much fewer, no matter how strong the friendship. Sometimes the hosts will invite their former student to activities and events to help a new student.\n\nAre there activities where the program gathers as a whole?\n\nThe Host Program organizes a few informal activities during the year where hosts and students can come together as a group. Hosts will inform their students when and where these activities take place. Students are welcome to attend these activities without their hosts and vice versa.\n\nApply to Become a Host\n\nBe part of a group of special people who help make Harvard a friendlier place for newly arrived international graduate students. By participating in the Host Program for International Students, you will join a group of hundreds of volunteers who have enriched the lives of thousands of graduate students, and, in turn, found their own lives enriched. A relatively small effort can reap big rewards. Hosting is a way in which one person can make a difference!\n\nApply to Host Program Online\n\nOr Contact:\n\nRenee Burke\n\nProgramming Coordinator, Harvard International Office\n\nGuidelines for Hosts\n\nExpectations of Hosts\n\nThe immediate post-arrival time is when students need and enjoy their host’s attention the most. The knowledge, support, and kindness that you can offer as a host is highly appreciated by students during their initial settling-in period. Once classes begin, students become more immersed in their studies and need less support. However, hosts are expected to stay in touch with students during the year. The amount of time spent together is up to the hosts and students.\n\nStudents appreciate the opportunity for a window into life in the United States. Events do not have to be elaborate or costly. The following are several activities to consider:\n\nSharing coffee or a meal\n\nGoing to a supermarket/farmer's market/other shopping\n\nVisiting a museum\n\nWatching a sports event\n\nGoing for a walk/hike\n\nExploring different neighborhoods, towns, etc.\n\nCelebrating a birthday or holiday\n\nA host’s most important contribution is to express care, whether it is spending time together or getting in touch to check in and say \"hi.\"\n\nOnce Hosts Have Been Matched with Students\n\nAn immediate welcoming email message gives new students a real sense of connection. Hosts may want to include information about their family, interests, profession, where they live in relation to the University, and a photo. If for any reason hosts have difficulty contacting their students, please email the Host Program Coordinator, Renee Burke.\n\nUpon a Student's Arrival\n\nHosts are not expected to meet students at the airport but are encouraged to arrange a first meeting soon after their arrival. The Harvard International Office (HIO) informs students not to expect housing of any kind from their hosts. The students' schools will have sent them housing information. You will find more details on this below.\n\nImmigration Requirements for Students\n\nInternational students have special obligations to the U.S. government, and it is the role of the HIO to help students meet them. If students have any questions regarding immigration, employment, travel outside the United States, or financial matters, please direct them to the HIO.\n\nOrientation Meetings\n\nEach school within Harvard provides orientations. The HIO offers optional \"Getting Started\" orientations to international students and spouses/partners as well.\n\nStarting the Academic Year\n\nThe beginning of an academic year is a critical time for students. Keep in mind that international students are making many adjustments simultaneously - new living accommodations, unfamiliar food, and new academic systems. What seems instinctive or obvious to locals may not appear so to the students.\n\nHousing\n\nMany students arrive knowing they have University housing - either graduate student dormitories or Harvard-owned apartments. Harvard-affiliated housing will provide instructions to the students as to when and how to get the keys to their accommodations, and they will inform students about what is included in University housing. Most dormitory rooms include basic furniture, but no linens. Harvard-owned apartments are unfurnished except for kitchen appliances.\n\nFurnishings\n\nFurnishing a temporary home can be overwhelming if one doesn't know where to go, or what to do. MIT has opened its MIT Furniture Exchange to Harvard and other local universities. In addition, Harvard's Recycling and Surplus Center offers furniture, household items, textiles, and a wide variety of other donated items for free to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis during their weekly opening hours.\n\nHosts can share information with students about yard sales, second-hand stores, Craigslist, or local Facebook groups where people are selling furniture and household items. Stores such as Cort Furniture Rental offer rental furniture and sell used furniture, and IKEA sells new furniture at reasonable prices. An offer by hosts to take students shopping is very helpful.\n\nDuring the Academic Year\n\nOnce classes begin, academics become foremost in a student's mind. However, hosts should stay in touch with their students during the year. It is up to the host to initiate contact and extend invitations. Occasional texts, calls, and/or emails provide tremendous encouragement and support for students. Should an invitation be turned down, it probably is due to students’ academic priorities. Don't let refusals dissuade from extending future invitations. Hopefully, students will soon feel comfortable enough to propose ideas for getting together.\n\nFinancial Guidelines\n\nThe HIO does not expect hosting to be a costly undertaking for hosts. However, communication is important to clarify expectations. If hosts would like their students to pay for something, for example, concert tickets, museum tickets, etc., they should explain their expectations of payment in advance. Hosts should not extend loans. Please let the program coordinator know immediately if a student informs you of a financial emergency, and please advise the student to contact their HIO advisor.\n\nGroup Activities\n\nWe will inform hosts when we are able to organize a group activity for students and hosts during the academic year. Please keep in mind that for all activities organized by the Host Program, the program coordinator only notifies the hosts. The hosts in turn notify their respective students.\n\nHosts will receive an invitation via email from the Host Program.\n\nHosts will contact their students to extend the invitation.\n\nStudents will only know about events from their hosts.\n\nHosts or students can attend without the other.\n\nFall\n\nAutumn in New England is a special time of year that hosts can share with students. Consider an afternoon of apple picking or cider pressing; a trip outside the city or to the Arnold Arboretum for spectacular foliage; a Harvard football game; Halloween trick or treating or a costume party. Students likely will have more time available to spend with hosts in the fall semester than in the spring semester.\n\nThe Holiday Season\n\nThe holiday season often presents a dilemma for hosts - flexibility is key! Some hosts love sharing their Thanksgiving, December, or New Year's traditions with students. Others may be traveling or find themselves wondering how to include non-family guests. For the students, this can be a time to travel or to catch up on academic work. Most international students, however, are curious about American holiday customs. Everyone has their own traditions, but giving thanks and sharing gifts seem to be universal. What better way to celebrate than providing students with a window into your own holiday world!\n\nOutings to Consider\n\nEncourage students to voice their interests and likes and dislikes. Hosts should be upfront about how much tickets cost if they would like students to pay.\n\nSome favorites:\n\nBoston area events\n\nBoston Marathon\n\nConcord\n\nFreedom Trail\n\nHarvard athletic events\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Library\n\nLexington\n\nOld Sturbridge Village\n\nSalem\n\nArnold Arboretum\n\nBlue Hills Reservation\n\nDept. of Conservation and Recreation\n\nWhale Watching\n\nPersonal Celebrations\n\nStudents will feel honored to be included in a host's celebrations of life's milestones - a birthday, wedding, retirement, or similar event. Allowing students to share a part of the host's life is a great gift. Students have told us they enjoy participating in family events!\n\nCommencement\n\nStudents may want to share it with their hosts. Graduation gives the hosts the opportunity to celebrate their student's academic achievement. If the student's family is here for the occasion, hosts might offer to help with housing arrangements for the family. The students will probably want their families to meet their host(s)—their American family.\n\nAbout Commencement Day"
