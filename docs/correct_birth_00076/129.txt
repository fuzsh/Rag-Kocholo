Ducal House of Wellington

House of Wellesley

The members of this family bear the surname Wellesley. The children of the Dukes of Wellington and Marquesses of Douro enjoy the title Lord or Lady before their Christian names.

The Dukedom of Wellington, derived from Wellington in Somerset, is a hereditary title in the senior rank of the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first holder of the title was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), the noted Irish-born career British Army officer and statesman, and unqualified references to the Duke of Wellington almost always refer to him. He is most famous for, together with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, defeating Napoleon I at Waterloo in Flanders. The Wellesley family is, in origin, an Anglo-Irish aristocratic dynasty.

The titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess Douro were bestowed upon Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, on 11 May 1814. The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are: Marquess of Wellington (1812), Marquess Douro (1814), Earl of Mornington (1760 - but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), Earl of Wellington (1812), Viscount Wellesley (1760 - inherited in 1863), Viscount Wellington (1809), Baron Mornington (1746 - also inherited in 1863), and Baron Douro (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The Dukes of Wellington also hold the foreign titles of Prins van Waterloo (Prince of Waterloo, United Kingdom of the Netherlands, 1815), Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo (Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo, Spain, 1812), Duque da Vitória (Duke of the Victory, Portugal, 1812), Marquês de Torres Vedras (Marquis of Torres Vedras, Portugal, 1812) and Conde de Vimeiro (Count of Vimeiro, Portugal, 1811). These were granted to the first Duke as victory titles for his distinguished services as victorious commanding general in the Peninsular War (in Spain and Portugal) and at the Battle of Waterloo (in what is now Belgium). The family seat is Stratfield Saye House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. Apsley House, in London, is now owned by English Heritage, although the family retain an apartment there.
