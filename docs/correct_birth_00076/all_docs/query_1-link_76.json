        "text": "Manuscript Name Papers of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington Manuscript Number MSS 280 Last Updated May 2021 Extent 1 folio box Location Special Collections, UNSW Canberra Abstract An original letter and invitation by Arthur Wellesley, together with notes by his biographer Herbert Maxwell and other family history source material (mostly copies) relating to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\n\nCollection Subject Type\n\nMilitary\n\nScope and Content\n\nThis collection comprises original and copied source materials relating to the life and career of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The papers belonged to the Duke’s grandson, George A. Wellesley, a resident of Sydney, Australia who gifted his personal collection of Wellingtonia to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Canberra in 1939-1940. As well as a handwritten letter and invitation in the Duke’s hand, the material includes a short sequence of notes made by Wellington’s biographer, Herbert Maxwell (with whom G.A. Wellesley was in contact), and copies of other Wellington family history-related papers. There is evidence suggesting that a proportion of the material was gathered and used by Maxwell for the purpose of his biography, then passed to G.A. Wellesley and absorbed into a small body of other papers held by the family.\n\nDate Range of Content\n\n1843, c1906-1948\n\nBiographical Note\n\nWikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington\n\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, KG, GCB, GCH, PC, FRS (1 May 1769–14 September 1852) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and Tory statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain, serving twice as Prime Minister. He won a notable victory against Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nReferences:\n\nNumber10.gov.uk: Duke of Wellington http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/duke-of-wellington retrieved 20 May 2020\n\nLibraryIreland.com: Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070415b.htm?hilite=bridges retrieved 20 May 2020\n\nAdministrative Information\n\nAccess and Copying Conditions\n\nAccess: Open Access\n\nThis collection contains a variety of copyright material.

Wellesley of Vaucluse, Sydney. A small addition of original Wellington correspondence and cuttings was made in February 1976, before the collection was transferred to Special Collections, UNSW Canberra following the closure of the Bridges Library in the 1980s\n\nAdditional Information\n\nRelated Material\n\nThe principal archive of the Duke of Wellington’s papers is housed at the University of Southampton (MS 61), comprising more than 100,000 manuscripts and other source materials.\n\nA summary list of additional archival collections relating to Arthur Wellesley (held elsewhere in Great Britain and internationally) is available on the National Archives (UK) website at https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F257265\n\nSeparated Material\n\nThis collection originally included a small group of historically significant publications, the early works formerly belonging to the private library of Duke of Wellington (thereafter added to by his descendants), some bound in red leather and bearing the Duke’s armorial binding.
