He was the son of Garrett Wellesley, 1st Earl of Mornington and the Hon Anne Hill-Trevor. He was baptised at St. Peter's Church, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland. [1]\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nHe married the Hon Catherine Sarah Dorothea Pakenham, daughter of Edward Michael Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford, and Catherine Rowley, at St. George's Church, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland. [2]The exact date is in dispute. FamilySearch gives marriage bond and license data as 1806. Wikipedia and other internet sites claim they married on 10 April of that year, probably quoting Citizen of the World' in The Military and Political Life of Arthur Wellesley. [3] However, on Wednesday 16 April 1806, the Belfast Commercial Chronicle reported that\n\nSir Arthur Wellesley will shortly set out for Ireland, where he will lead the Hon. Miss Pakenham, sister to the Earl Longford, to the hymeneal altar.[4]\n\nThe Annual Register of World Events reported that they married on (Sunday) 20 April. [5] The Bury and Norwich Post - on Wednesday 23 April 1806, stated that they had married on the previous Thursday (17 April). [6]The Staffordshire Advertiser on Saturday 26 April 1806 says they married on Thursday 24 April.[7]\n\nLife and Career\n\nArthur Wellesley was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman. He rose to prominence during the Peninsular War and became a national hero in Britain after the Napoleonic Wars, during which he led the victorious Anglo-Allied forces at the Battle of Waterloo. He would later be elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on two separate occasions.[8]\n\nIn 1851, aged 81, widowed, he was living at Apsley House, St George's Hanover Square, London, United Kingdom. [9]\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on 14 September 1852 at age 83 at Walmer Castle, Walmer, Kent, England. His public funeral took place on 18 November 1852 at St. Paul's Cathedral, The City, London, England[10], with his death being registered in the third quarter of 1852 at Eastry, Kent, England, United Kingdom[11]. and an elaborate procession and ceremony commemorated the life of one of the nation's most remarkable leaders.\n\nOn Wednesday evening , the 10th November, at seven o'clock, the Remains of the late illustrious deceased were privately removed from Walmer Castle, in a Hearse drawn by four horses, attended by an escort of the Rifle Brigade, and followed by three Mourning Coaches, each drawn by four horses, in the first of which were the Marquess Douro (now Duke of Wellington ), Lord Arthur Hay, and the Captain of Walmer Castle ( John J. Watts, Esq .); in the second, Thomas Charles March, Esq., Chief Clerk of the Department of the Lord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household; and in the third, Mr. Kendall and Mr. Collins, servants of the deceased: Minute Guns were fired from the ramparts of Walmer Castle whilst the Procession moved from thence to the Station at Deal. From the Station the Body, attended by the Marquess Douro and the other persons who had followed in the Mourning Coaches, was conveyed by Special Train to London, arriving there at twelve o'clock; and thence, being followed as before, the Body was conveyed under an escort of Life Guards to Chelsea Hospital, where, about three o'clock in the morning of Thursday the 11th, it was received by Norman Hilton Macdonald, Esq., Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Department, and by a Guard of Honour of the 2nd battalion of Grenadier Guards, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable James Lindsey, and a similar Guard of Honour, furnished by the brigade of Foot Guards, mounted daily, until the Remains were removed.

[13]\n\nThe Vickers Wellesley and later the Vickers Wellington bombers were named after him [14].\n\n\"At his funeral Wellesley's style was proclaimed (laid out in the following order and format in the London Gazette):\n\nArthur, Duke and Marquess of Wellington,\n\nMarquess Douro, Earl of Wellington,\n\nViscount Wellington and Baron Douro,\n\nKnight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,\n\nKnight Grand Cross of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath,\n\nOne of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, and\n\nField Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces.\n\nField Marshal of the Austrian Army,\n\nField Marshal of the Hanoverian Army,\n\nField Marshal of the Army of the Netherlands,\n\nMarshal-General of the Portuguese Army,\n\nField Marshal of the Prussian Army,\n\nField Marshal of the Russian Army, and\n\nCaptain-General of the Spanish Army.\n\nPrince of Waterloo, of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,\n\nDuke of Ciudad Rodrigo and Grandee of Spain of the First Class.\n\nDuke of Victoria, Marquess of Torres Vedras, and Count of Vimiera in Portugal.\n\nKnight of the Most Illustrious Order of the Golden Fleece, and of the Military Orders of St. Ferdinand and of St. Hermenigilde of Spain.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Orders of the Black Eagle and of the Red Eagle of Prussia.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Imperial Military Order of Maria Teresa of Austria.\n\nKnight of the Imperial Orders of St. Andrew, St. Alexander Newski, and St. George of Russia.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Royal and Military Order of the Sword of Sweden.\n\nKnight of the Order of St. Esprit of France.\n\nKnight of the Order of the Elephant of Denmark.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order.\n\nKnight of the Order of St. Januarius and of the Military Order of St. Ferdinand and of Merit of the Two Sicilies.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Supreme Order of the Annunciation of Savoy.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Royal Military Order of Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nKnight of the Royal Order of the Rue Crown of Saxony,\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Military Merit of Wurtemberg.\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Military Order of William of the Netherlands.\n\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Lion of Hesse Cassel,\n\nand\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Orders of Fidelity and of the Lion of Baden.\" [15]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Dictionary of National Biography: \"Dictionary of National Biography, Volumes 1-22\", London, England: Oxford University Press; Volume: Vol 20; Page: 1081, Ancestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 1981 #77353 (accessed 11 December 2023), Arthur Wellesley Duke of Wellington born in 1769, child of Garrett Wellesley & Anne Hill.\n\nTranscription:\n\n\"WELLESLEY, ARTHUR, first Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), field-marshal, was fourth son of Garrett Wellesley, first earl of Mornington[q.v.], by Anne, eldest daughter of Arthur Hill, viscount Dungannon. He was born in 1769, less than four months before Napoleon. There is some doubt about the exact date and place of his birth. His mother gave 1 May as his birthday, and he himself so kept it, but the nurse affirmed that he was born on 6 March at Dangan Castle, co. Meath. The registry of St. Peter's Church, Dublin, shows that he was christened there on 30 April 1769, and the May number of 'Exshaw's Gentlemaan's Magazine' has: 'April 29. The Countess of Mornington of a son.' The 'Dublin Gazette' of 2-4 May dates the event 'a few days ago , in Merrion Street.' On the whole the evidence points to 29 April, and to 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin (Notes and Queries, 4th ser. x. 443, 7th ser. xi 34: MURRAY, Wellington: the Date and Place of his Birth).\"\n\n↑ Marriage: \"Ireland, Diocesan and Prerogative Marriage License Bonds Indexes, 1623-1866\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:WG48-2J6Z : 3 December 2019), Arthur Hon Sir Wellesley, 1806.
