        "text": "Arthur Wellesley 1st Duke of Wellington, KG, KP, GCB, GCH, PC, FRS 1769 – 1852 was an Anglo Irish soldier and statesman, and one of the leading military and political figures of the nineteenth century.\n\nWellesley was a staunch advocate of homeopathy and a patron of the London Homeopathic Hospital, he was a friend of Frederick Hervey Foster Quin (Anon, The North American journal of homeopathy, Volume 7, (American Medical Union, 1859). Pages 117-119. See also Anon, British Medical Journal, (British Medical Association, 1858). Page 423. See also John Fitzgibbon Geary, Some local and general excrescences of Homoeopathy: being reviews of Dr. Hering’s “Homoeopathist, or domestic physician,” and of the homoeopathic “Materia medica pura”, (Henry B. Ashmead, 1858). Page 5).\n\nArthur Wellesley treated Richard Monckton Milnes 1st Baron Houghton with homeopathic remedies for influenza (_The life, letters, and friendships of Richard Monckton Milnes: first Lord Houghton, Volume 1. _Thomas Wemyss Reid. Cassell & Company, Limited, 1890. Page 497).\n\nArthur Wellesley was a close friend of Emily Mary Lamb (1767-1869) (the mother of William Francis Cowper Temple 1st Baron Mount Temple (1811-1888)) who later married Henry John Temple 3rd Viscount Palmerston (1784-1865).\n\nArthur Wellesley knew (everyone who mattered basically) Prince Albert, Henry Charles FitzRoy Somerset 8th Duke of Beaufort, Alfred Duke of Edinburgh, Robert William Gardiner, George Hamilton Gordon 4th Earl of Aberdeen, Robert Grosvenor, Henry William Paget, Henry Palmerston, Robert Peel, Mary Jane Seacole, Queen Victoria, Sarah Sophia Villiers, Countess of Jersey,\n\nArthur Wellesley was related by marriage to William Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer, the brother of Edward Bulwer Lytton,\n\nThe homeopathic hospital in Smyrna, was also supported by: Arthur Algernon Capell 6th Earl of Essex, Lord Lovaine MP (Algernon George Percy 6th Duke of Northumberland), James Gambier 1st Baron Gambier, George Wyndham 1st Baron Leconfield, Colonel Taylor, Edmund Gardiner Fishbourne, Robert Grosvenor 1st Baron Ebury, Richard Whately Archbishop of Dublin, Henry Charles FitzRoy Somerset 8th Duke of Beaufort, Arthur Wellesley 1st Duke of Wellington, James Hamilton 1st Duke of Abercorn, and 18 other members of the House of Lords, 43 Peer’s sons, Baronets and Members of Parliament, 17 Generals, 33 Field Officers, 43 other Officers of the Army, 2 Admirals, 15 Captains of the navy, 65 Clergymen, 45 Justices of the Peace, Barristers and Solicitors, and 314 Bankers, Merchants and others.\n\nArthur Wellesley was born in Ireland to a prominent Ascendancy family, he was commissioned an ensign in the British Army in 1787. Serving in Ireland as aide de camp to two successive Lords Lieutenant of Ireland he was also elected as a Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons. A colonel by 1796, Wellesley saw action in the Netherlands and later India where he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the Battle of Seringapatam. He was later appointed governor of Seringapatam and Mysore.\n\nWellesley rose to prominence as a general during the Peninsular campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, and was promoted to the rank of field marshal after leading the allied forces to victory against the French at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. Following Napoleon Bonaparte’s exile in 1814, he served as the ambassador to France and was granted a Dukedom.\n\nDuring the Hundred Days in 1815, he commanded the allied army which defeated Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nAn opponent of parliamentary reform, he was given the epithet the “Iron Duke” because of the iron shutters he had fixed to his windows to stop the pro-reform mob from breaking them.\n\nHe was twice Prime Minister under the Tory party and oversaw the passage of the Catholic Relief Act 1829. He was Prime Minister from 1828–30 and served briefly in 1834. He was unable to prevent the passage of the Reform Act of 1832 and continued as one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement. He remained Commander in Chief of the British Army until his death in 1852.\n\nOf interest:\n\n**Frederick Arthur Wellesley **1844 - 1931 was a close friend of Frederick Hervey Foster Quin.\n\nArthur Richard Wellesley 2nd Duke of Wellington (1807-1884) In 1866, Wellesley was on the Management Committe of the Association for the Trial of Preventative and Curative Treatment in the Cattle Plague by the Homeopathic Method, with George Thomas Keppel 6th Earl of Albemarle, William Pitt Amherst 2nd Earl Amherst, Henry Charles FitzRoy Somerset 8th Duke of Beaufort, Ralph Buchan, William Alleyne Cecil Lord Burghley 3rd Marquess of Exeter, William Coutts Keppel Viscount Bury 7th Earl of Albemarle, James Key Caird 1st Baronet (Vice Chairman), Colonel Challoner, George Grimston Craven 3rd Earl of Craven, Henry William Dashwood 5th Baronet, Patrick Dudgeon, Robert Grosvenor 1st Baron Ebury, Francis Richard Charteris 10th Earl of Wemyss Lord Elcho, Arthur Algernon Capell 6th Earl of Essex, Philip Howard Frere, Richard Grosvenor Earl Grosvenor 2nd Marquess of Westminster, Edward Kerrison, Henry Charles Keith Petty Fitzmaurice 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, Lord Llanover, Colonel Farnaby Lennard, George Loch, Archibald Keppel MacDonald, Arthur de Vere Capell Viscount Malden, John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough (Chairman), Frederick Francis Maude, William Miles, James Moore, Charles Gordon Lennox 5th Duke of Richmond, Charles Marsham 3rd Earl of Romney, Sir Anthony Rothschild, John Villiers Shelley, John Robert Townshend 1st Earl Sydney, Lt. Colonel Charles Towneley, Augustus Henry Vernon, William Warren Vernon, Wellesley, William Wells,\n\nIn 1866, the Treasury placed rooms at Adelphi Terrace at the disposal of John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough, who was the Chairman of the Association for the Trial of Preventative and Curative Treatment in the Cattle Plague by the Homeopathic Method, based on the research done in Belgium by Edward Hamilton, with John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough overseeing the work of Edward Hamilton, George Lennox Moore, James Moore and Alfred Crosby Pope.\n\nWilliam Coutts Keppel Viscount Bury 7th Earl of Albemarle issued an address or report for the Association for the Trial of Preventative and Curative Treatment in the Cattle Plague by the Homeopathic Method in 1866. Bury reported that the Dutch had experienced such success with homeopathy against that cattle plague, that they had authorised Edward Hamilton to visit Holland to investigate this.\n\nEdward Hamilton discovered that the Dutch had treated 4798 cattle, 1031 were destroyed = 3767 were treated (with a mixture of allopathic and homeopathic treatments), the survival rate for the beasts treated was 45%, and the survival rate for the beasts treated only by homeopathy was 72-5%.\n\nThe Dutch Government had agreed to allow E Seutin, a homeopathic chemist, the total control of infected cattle in Matterness, and initially, E Seutin saved 70% of the cattle, though latterly, he had saved 9 out of every 10 beasts brought to him for treatment, and E Seutin’s use of homeoprophylaxic treatment of unifected beasts brought the epidemic under control entirely within four weeks. Matterness was pronounced free from infection and it has remained thus ever since. The remedies used were arsenicum, phosphorus, phos ac, rhus tox and sulphur.\n\nIn 1866, George Lennox Moore became involved with Association for the Trial of Preventative and Curative Treatment in the Cattle Plague by the Homeopathic Method, alongside Edward Hamilton and Alfred Crosby Pope, and overseen by John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough.\n\nGeorge Lennox Moore wrote a detailed report on these trials, including a refutation of the falsities published in _The Lancet__ _regarding the homeopathic treatment of the cattle plague, attacking William Coutts Keppel Viscount Bury 7th Earl of Albemarle and accusing him of ‘being completely misinformed on this matter‘, and inventing a trail of misleading mistruths about the situation.\n\nThe orthodox statistics of this clinical trial revealed 8640 cases, 8% killed, 77% died and 15% recovered, though John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough subsequently issued the interim homeopathic results claiming up to 50% recovery rates with arsenicum, belladonna, phosphorus, rhus tox and turpentine as the main homeopathic remedies used.\n\nThe Times wrote an article wishing the homeopaths success in these homeopathic trials, but they also made a pithy comment that the allopaths would probably rather see all the cattle die than have homeopathy proved successfull.\n\nThe final report on the homeopathic trials in the treatment of cattle plague was issued by John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough. The orthodox statistics of this clinical trial revealed 8640 cases, 8% killed, 77% died and 15% recovered, though John Winston Spencer Churchill 7th Duke of Marlborough subsequently issued the interim homeopathic results claiming up to 50% recovery rates with arsenicum, belladonna, phosphorus, rhus tox and turpentine as the main homeopathic remedies used."
