        "text": "The Dukedom of Wellington, derived from Wellington in Somerset, is a hereditary title and the senior Dukedom in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first holder of the title was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769–1852), the noted Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman, and indeed an unqualified reference to the Duke of Wellington in a historical text or to a monument will almost certainly be a reference to this man.\n\nThe titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess Douro were bestowed upon Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, on May 11, 1814. The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are: Marquess of Wellington (1812), Marquess Douro (1814), Earl of Mornington (1760 - but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), Earl of Wellington (1812), Viscount Wellesley (1760 - inherited in 1863), Viscount Wellington (1809), Baron Mornington (1746 - also inherited in 1863) and Baron Douro (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Dukes of Wellington also hold the foreign titles of Prince of Waterloo (The Netherlands, 1815), Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo (Spain, 1812), Duque de Vitoria and Marquês de Torres Vedras (Portugal, 1812) and Conde de Vimeiro (Portugal,1811). These were conferred on the first Duke for his services in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nDukes of Wellington (1814)\n\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769-1852)\n\nArthur Richard Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington (1807-1884)\n\nHenry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington (1846-1900)\n\nArthur Charles Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington (1849-1934)\n\nArthur Charles Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington (1876-1941)\n\nHenry Valerian George Wellesley, 6th Duke of Wellington (1912-1943)\n\nGerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington (1885-1972)\n\nArthur Valerian Wellesley, 8th Duke of Wellington (b. 1915)"
