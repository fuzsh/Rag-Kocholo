        "text": "Although Wellington is remembered as a British military hero, and was honoured with land and titles in England during his life, Arthur Wellesley (1769-1852) was actually born in Dublin. However, he never thought of himself as Irish and claimed, perhaps less than tactfully, that \"because a man is born in a stable it does not make him a horse\".\n\nEveryone knows that he was twice elected Prime Minister after retiring from the battlefield, but Wellington had already worked in politics long before that. After an education at Eton, in Brussels and in France – a country that, lest we forget, he later trounced on the battlefield – Wellesley went into the Irish Parliament at just 20 years of age, where he served for five years.\n\nWhen he first started out, that is. At the age of 25, Wellington fought in the 1794 Flanders Campaign during the French Revolutionary war. He was appalled by British strategy. It was this that inspired him to study the art of war.\n\nIf you are an Iron Duke enthusiast, you can drink in 53 pubs called the Duke of Wellington, as well as 37 that go by an unadorned \"Wellington\". And that’s just in England. The Duke of Wellington is the oldest licenced pub in Melbourne, and now serves a variety of gastropub food. And then of course there are the countless pubs called simply The Duke. Just don't feel the need to get a pint in each one.\n\nThough he rarely showed emotion, Wellington cried when he read the list of dead after Waterloo and he would always avoid unnecessary bloodshed. He was upset by the sight of battle carnage and never glorified warfare, putting him in line perhaps with a more modern mindset. Though he always demanded obedience, in person Wellington was reserved, raising his voice only at officers he considered pampered. As a junior officer, he often failed to punish the men who thieved and pillaged on his watch.\n\nWellington wore dark clothes without decoration so that enemies would not be able to distinguish him from other officers in the field. Because of this, he wasn’t an easy target for those looking to assassinate him and could stay close to the front line, managing the lowest of his troops in the thick of battle. This can be seen as a forerunner of the modern camouflage adopted during the First World War.\n\nAt a time of powdered wigs or pigtailed hair, Wellington kept his hair short. This was considered a sign of modish flamboyance: Beau Brummell, the Regency dandy credited with inventing the monochrome suit, wore his hair short, and so did the fashionable London elite. But as for practical, earthy and plain-living gentlemen, wigs or longer, powdered hair were considered more respectable. Though he was noted for his sharp dress sense, even being nicknamed “the Beau” by his soldiers, his hairdo was a functional affair. After a while, the sense of having less hair to worry about during battle filtered down through the ranks.\n\nSome think this classic British dish emerged from Wellington’s fondness for a beef fillet covered in foie gras pâté and mushrooms and cooked in pastry (the ham and mustard must have come in later). Some believe it was a PR stunt similar to the Americans renaming French Fries \"Freedom Fries\", with England appropriating a French classic during the Napoleonic Wars. Some even believe it was an American or Kiwi dish. In any case, there is no evidence of the dish being eaten during either the Duke’s lifetime or the rest of the 19th century.\n\nThese were named after the multipurpose custom footwear Wellington wore during his campaigns. Adapted from the standard-issue leather Hessian boot, they had a low heel and were lined with calfskin ro ease the strain after a long day of battle, and could be translated into a fashionable evening setting. Beau Brummell, the infamous dandy mentioned above, also contributed to their popularisation, wearing his own version of the Hessian boot in drawing rooms before Wellington’s Victory at Waterloo made him a figure to emulate. In 1852, these boots started to be made from rubber rather than leather.\n\nThough respected, the Duke notoriously made an unsuccessful Prime Minister in later life. He hated attention and was embarrassed by public cheers; his plainness of speech was often mistaken for rudeness and he never addressed his troops en masse, thinking this “the stuff of players”. But then even while he was defeating Napoleon's generals one after the other during his Portuguese and Spanish campaigns, the British government were sceptical of his chances, refusing to send him reinforcements or supplies, and at one point calling him home to be court-martialled. The future George IV, then Prince Regent, had more admiration for Napoleon. But this lead Wellington to be a more resourceful soldier and leader. In contrast, Napoleon was always spoilt for loyalty, troops and resources and often squandered the lot.\n\nHaving no thirst for blood or victory for the sake of it, Wellington would always retreat if that meant avoiding heavy casualties or defeat. Because of this, he never lost a battle, whereas more daring and relentless military leaders of the time such as Nelson and Napoleon either died fighting or lost wars. Having reached his peak after the victory at the Battle of Waterloo, Wellington retired from the battlefield aged 46."
