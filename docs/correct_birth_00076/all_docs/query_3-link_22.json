        "text": "Made in Manchester, Bolton and Salford: Maxine Peake (b.1974), raised in Westhoughton, Bolton, was rejected by theatre education companies in north-west England, but won a scholarship to London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and became one of Britain’s best-loved actresses. After roles in TV productions such as dinnerladies, Shameless and See No Evil: The Moors Murders, she has starred in plays at Manchester’s Royal Exchange. She also wrote, directed and starred in the play Beryl, about Leeds-born cyclist Beryl Burton, for radio and stage. Peake joined Octagon Youth Theatre in Bolton at age 13, then the Royal Exchange youth theatre in Manchester and did a two-year performing arts course at Salford College of Technology. She joined the Communist Party of Britain and played for Wigan Ladies rugby league team. Her acting break came shortly after Rada, landing the role of Twinkle in Victoria Wood’s dinnerladies. While appearing in the hit comedy series, she decided to go on a diet and lost five stones. Her association with the Royal Exchange led to performances including The Children's Hour in 2008, The Masque of Anarchy in 2012 for the Manchester International Festival, Hamlet in 2014 and as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire in 2016. She played the lead role of Winnie in Samuel Beckett's Happy Days and starred in The Nico Project as Velvet Underground singer Nico at the Manchester International Festival 2019, co-created by Peake and artistic director Sarah Frankcom. Beryl: A Love Story On Two Wheels was commissioned by West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2014. She also wrote a play the following year called Queens of the Coal Age for Radio 4 telling the story of Annie Scargill and three other women who tried to occupy a coal mine in 1993. Peake left London in 2009 to live in Salford with her partner, art director Pawlo Wintoniuk. She was a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn’s leftwing leadership of the Labour Party. (See my new book 'Made in Manchester: A People's History of the City that Shaped the Modern World', published by HarperNorth.)\n\nMade in Manchester and Stockport: Sir Joseph Whitworth (1803-87), engineer, entrepreneur, inventor and philanthropist, created a standard for screw threads for nuts and bolts, allowing components to become interchangeable and laying the foundation of modern mass production. With other precision engineers, he pioneered a manufacturing revolution that transformed Britain from a craft economy to a fully mechanised one within two generations. Less celebrated than engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel or George Stephenson, he has arguably had an even greater impact on the modern world. His breakthroughs also included a measuring machine that could detect differences of less than one millionth of an inch. In addition, he designed rifles and cannon. Whitworth, born in John Street, Stockport, worked in London for a time for Henry Maudslay, inventor of the screw-cutting lathe. He returned to Manchester in 1833 and started a business in Openshaw, manufacturing lathes and other machine tools. In 1841, he designed the British Standard Whitworth system, the first accepted standard for screw threads. Parts could be made in different factories and would all fit together. Whitworth Standard remained in place in much of the world until after the Second World War. Letter-writer Jane Carlyle said he had ‘a face not unlike that of a baboon; speaks the broadest Lancashire; could not invent an epigram to save his life; but has nevertheless “a talent that might drive the Genii to despair”.’ Whitworth bequeathed much of his fortune for the people of Manchester, with the Whitworth Art Gallery and Christie Hospital partly funded by his money. He left money to create an institute incorporating Manchester Technical School on the site of his former works in Sackville Street. It became part of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and later merged with Victoria University of Manchester. (See my new book 'Made in Manchester: A People's History of the City that Shaped the Modern World', published by HarperNorth.)\n\nMade in Manchester: Ernest and Shena Simon were a formidable husband-and-wife team of social reformers who played a pivotal role in Wythenshawe’s growth from a handful of small villages to a settlement of 100,000 people. Ernest (1879-1960), Didsbury-born son of a German industrialist, was Liberal MP for Withington 1923-24 and 1929-31 and knighted in 1932. After the Second World War he joined the Labour Party and became Baron Simon of Wythenshawe and chairman of the BBC board of governors. Shena (1883-1972), born in Croydon, was an educational reformer who fought for the introduction of comprehensive education. She was a member of the city corporation 1924-33 and spent more than four decades on its education committee. In 1926 the pair bought Wythenshawe Hall and 250 acres of the surrounding estate and gave it to the people of Manchester 'to be kept forever as an open space', helping to kick-start a plan to create a garden city with jobs, schools, shops and leisure facilities. When his father died, Ernest entered the family engineering business, manufacturing flour milling machinery and coke ovens, and successfully expanded it into building grain silos. Wealth generated by the business allowed him to pursue outside interests, including politics. He was introduced to Shena and they married in 1912. They had three children. Ernest was lord mayor of Manchester 1921-2, the youngest person at the time to hold the office. He campaigned to end slum housing. Shena founded a Manchester branch of the Women Citizens' Association and became a Liberal city councillor. Even after defeat in 1933, she returned to the education committee as a co-opted member until she retired in 1970. In 1935 she joined the Labour Party. She devoted much of her energy to planning the Wythenshawe estate. She also championed feminist causes, notably a campaign against the marriage bar on women teachers in Manchester, which was lifted in 1928 as a result of her efforts. (See my new book 'Made in Manchester: A People's History of the City that Shaped the Modern World', published by HarperNorth.)\n\nMade in Manchester: Alliott Verdon Roe (1877-1958), pilot and aircraft designer, was the first Briton to construct and fly his own aeroplane. He founded manufacturer Avro at Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street in 1910. Avro, through the work of Farnworth-born designer Roy Chadwick, went on to design some of the most recognisable British aircraft, including the Lancaster bomber. Roe was born in Patricroft, Eccles, son of a doctor. He quit school at age 14 and went to British Columbia. He returned a year later and became an apprentice at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s locomotive shops. He left the shops and went to sea on a freighter where, while observing seagulls, he became interested in the problem of flight. He took a job in the motor car industry and spent his spare time making and studying flying models. After experimenting with model aeroplanes, he flew a full-size aeroplane at Brooklands in Surrey and became the first to fly an all-British machine, a triplane, on Walthamstow marshes in 1909. A year later, with brother Humphrey, Alliott founded the A.V. Roe Aircraft Co, later renamed Avro Aircraft. Avro’s most popular model, the 504, became the backbone of allied flying training during the First World War. Business declined after the war. Roe's attempts to diversify met little success and in 1928 he sold the controlling interest in A. V. Roe to Armstrong Siddeley and became co-owner of Saunders-Roe, which made flying boats. Roe was knighted in 1929. His reputation became tarnished by joining Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The Avro Lancaster became one of the Second World War’s leading bombers and the delta-wing Avro Vulcan a stalwart of the Cold War.
