        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_Earl_of_Mornington\n\nArthur Gerald Wellesley, Earl of Mornington (born 31 January 1978 at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London) is the elder son of Charles Wellesley, 9th Duke of Wellington. The Wellesleys are an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family. Through his mother, Antonia von Preussen, Duchess of Wellington, he is great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II. As a descendant of Queen Victoria, he is eligible to succeed to the British throne.\n\nMornington was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He is a partner in merchant bank, Charterhouse Capital Partners: coincidentally, one of his professional rivals is a descendant of the first Marquess' adversary, Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIn 2005 he married makeup artist and fashion model Jemma Kidd, great-granddaughter of Lord Beaverbrook. Since 2014, following the succession of his father as Duke of Wellington he did not take the courtesy title of Marquess of Douro, preferring instead to remain Lord Mornington.\n\nLord and Lady Mornington have twins and a younger son:\n\nLady Mae Madeleine Wellesley (born 4 January 2010 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London)\n\nArthur Darcy, Viscount Wellesley (born 4 January 2010 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London)\n\nThe Honorable Alfred Wellesley (born 10 December 2014)\n\nLord Mornington is the heir apparent to the Dukedom of Wellington and to the titles Prince of Waterloo and Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo. The first two titles can only be inherited in the male line, while the last can also devolve upon the holder's daughters."
