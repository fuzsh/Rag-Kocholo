        "text": "One among the worldâ€™s most legendary military leaders, Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington was perhaps the greatest of British soldiers in history. Widely regarded as the greatest man in the 19th century, Wellesley was despised by the men he commanded, for he was a rather strict disciplinarian. Born into a family of noblemen, Wellesley began his career in the army after his family faced financial problems post the death of his father. He was victorious at Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the Battle of Seringapatam, Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo. After serving a successful term as an army man, he returned to become the prime minster of The United Kingdom and Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, a position that he retained until his death. He is known for his unique defensive commanding style and today, many of his military strategies and battle plans are a part of academic programs in military academies across the world. Wellesley always planned extensively before battles and is thus, regarded as one among the best defence commanders of all time.To know more about his childhood, personal life and achievements in the field of military and politics, scroll down and continue to read this biography.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nBritish Celebrities Born In May\n\nNick Name: The Beau, The Peer, The Eagle, Douro Douro, Beau Douro, Sepoy General, The Beef, The Iron Duke\n\nAlso Known As: Arthur Wellesley\n\nDied At Age: 83\n\nFamily:\n\nSpouse/Ex-: Catherine Pakenham\n\nfather: Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington\n\nmother: Anne\n\nchildren: Arthur, Charles\n\nBorn Country: Ireland\n\npolitical ideology: Tory\n\nDied on: September 14, 1852\n\nplace of death: Kent, England\n\nCause of Death: Seizure\n\nCity: Dublin, Ireland\n\nMore Facts\n\nawards: - Knight of the Order of the Garter\n\n- Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath\n\n- Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order\n\n- Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Sword\n\n- Knight of the Golden Fleece\n\n- Knight Grand Cross of the Military William Order"
