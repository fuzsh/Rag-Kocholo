        "text": "The war hero, who takes up politics and rises effortlessly to the top, is a familiar figure in American history. At least eight presidents — George Washington, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower — conform to this stereotype. The only British Prime Minister to have followed a similar route is Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and even he is somewhat different, as he already had a fair amount of political experience before his military triumphs. Born Arthur Wesley, in Dublin, on 1 May 1769 (the same year as Napoleon), he was the fifth son and sixth child of nine children. His father, the 1st Earl of Mornington (in the Irish peerage), was a composer and Professor of Music at Trinity College, Dublin. His mother, the former Anne Hill, was the eldest daughter of the 1st Viscount Dungannon. Both of his parents were products of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland. Arthur grew up a solitary child, closer to his father than his mother, and showed no promise whatsoever, either academically or at games, other than at playing the violin, at which he seems to have inherited something of his father’s skill. (That is, if the first Lord Mornington was, indeed, his father. According to the historian L.G. Mitchell, Arthur later came to doubt his mother’s fidelity, and believed his actual father may have been a gardener on the Wesleys’ Irish estate — Mitchell, p. 183)."
