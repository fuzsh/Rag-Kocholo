        "text": "The context\n\nThe Peninsular War began with the French and Spanish invasion of Portugal in 1807. The following year, Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor, turned on his Spanish ally, placing his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne.\n\nAn expeditionary force was despatched to Portugal, commanded by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley. It enjoyed initial success, defeating the French at Vimeiro in August 1808. By 1812, Wellesley had secured Lisbon behind the Lines of Torres Vedras and had then driven French troops from Portugal. His successes in Iberia led to him being made first Viscount Wellington and then Earl of Wellington.\n\nAt the beginning of 1812, Wellington took the offensive into Spain. The town of Ciudad Rodrigo was taken on 8 January. Then, following a costly assault, the formidable fortress of Badajoz fell to the allied forces of Britain, Spain and Portugal on 6 April.\n\nThere were 230,000 French troops in Spain at this time, but they were divided between five armies. And Napoleon’s imminent campaign against Russia meant that reinforcements were not available.\n\nIsolating Marmont\n\nWellington had ensured French forces were held in place by Spanish regular and guerrilla actions that pinned them down throughout the Peninsula.\n\nOnce General Rowland Lord Hill severed communications between Marshal Marmont and Marshal Soult, capturing the Tagus crossing at Almaraz in May 1812, Marmont’s isolation made him Wellington’s prime target.\n\nWellington marched on Salamanca, entering the city on 17 June. Ten days later, he took three of the outlying forts in an attempt to force Marmont into action. With Marmont unwilling to commit, Wellington moved out to manoeuvre against him, probing for an advantage that would allow him to force battle.\n\nWellington’s intelligence reports, however, warned that Marmont was soon to be reinforced by troops sent by Joseph Bonaparte. Fearing he had lost the initiative, Wellington was forced to consider the abandonment of Salamanca and retreat back to Portugal.\n\nThe armies\n\nLieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, had been appointed to command in Portugal in April 1809, following the death of Sir John Moore. He had previously made his name in a series of campaigns in India.\n\nHe was given the title Viscount Wellington after defeating the French at Talavera in July 1809. At Salamanca, his army was 48,000-strong and included contingents of Portuguese and Spanish troops. He also commanded 60 guns.\n\nMarshal Auguste Marmont was a skilled artillery officer, who had been an aide to Napoleon in his 1796 campaign in Italy. Following Marshal Massena's decisive defeat to Wellington at Fuentes d’Onor (1811), Marmont replaced him as commander of the Army of Portugal. By July 1812, this consisted of 50,000 men and 78 guns."
