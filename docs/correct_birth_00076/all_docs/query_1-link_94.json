He was one of the leading political figures of 19th Century Birtain, serving twice as Prime Minister. He was also a military leader, and was one of the commanders who won and ended the Napoleonic Warsa when Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nHe is famous for his defensive and adaptive style of warfare, which led to many victories against numerically superior forces. His victories and battle plans are still srudied in military academies around the world. Post military career he served as British Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830 and then for only a month in 1834. He oversaw the Catholic Relief Act in 1829, but opposed it in 1832."
