        "text": "Wellesley, shown during his campaign in India, wears the uniform of a Major-General, the position he was promoted to in 1802. His right hand is placed on his chest through the opening of his jacket and his left hand rests on his curved sword. In the background, a group of soldiers heave a canon up a slope, while others have just raised the Union Jack.\n\nOne of several depictions of Wellesley by Home, this portrait presented to Admiral Page, captain of the boat that returned Wellesley from India to English shores, by the sitter himself. Page later gave the work to his close friend Walter Halliday. According to W. Foster’s ‘British Artists in India’ (1930):\n\n‘The [original] painting is now in the possession of the Government of India at Delhi, having been purchased from the artist in 1805 for 2,000 rupees; another hangs in Buckingham Palace; while a third, said to have been painted for Wellesley himself, belongs to the present Duke of Wellington.’"
