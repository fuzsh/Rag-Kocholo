Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Except for historical information, the discussion in this report (including, without limitation, the discussion under the heading ‘‘Results of Operations’’) contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks discussed under the caption ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 (A copy of which is available at www.sec.gov or upon request from the Company). Overview Yahoo! Inc. (‘‘Yahoo!’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) is a global Internet communications, commerce, and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services to millions of worldwide users daily. As the first online navigational guide to the World Wide Web (the ‘‘Web’’), www.yahoo.com is a leading guide in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user reach, and is one of the most recognized brands associated with the Internet. The Company commenced operations on March 5, 1995. In August 1995, the Company commenced selling advertisements on its Web pages and recognized its initial revenues. As of August 31, 2000, the Company had completed twenty acquisitions since its inception. The following table summarizes the acquisitions completed through August 31, 2000 that were accounted for as poolings of interests (shares issued in thousands).

For the six month period ended June 30, 2000, nonrecurring charges totaled $0.4 million related to the February acquisition of Arthas.com. For the year ended December 31, 1999, nonrecurring charges related to acquisition costs totaled $77.1 million and included investment banking, financial and legal advisory services, severance and contract termination costs related to the mergers. These costs were primarily attributable to the GeoCities and broadcast.com acquisition costs of $55.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively. For 1998 and 1997, nonrecurring charges related to acquisition costs were $3.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 1999, $5.6 million of accrued acquisition costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. These accrued amounts consist of contract termination and severance costs and will be paid during the year ending December 31, 2000. The Company’s supplementary consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes reflect the Company’s financial position and results of operations as if the above acquired entities, accounted for F-2\n\n8. as poolings of interests, were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company since inception, with the exception of WebCal and Arthas.com, whose historical operations were not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

June 30, 2000 8.9 ** Acquisitions completed by GeoCities prior to the Company’s acquisition of GeoCities. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The results of operations for entities acquired in 1999 and accounted for under the purchase method were not material to the Company. The results of operations of these acquired entities are included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to the acquisition date. Viaweb was a provider of software and services for hosting online stores. In connection with the acquisition of Viaweb and pursuant to discussions with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commis- sion (the ‘‘Staff’’), approximately $15 million of the purchase price was assigned to in-process research and development and expensed upon the consummation of the acquisition. Various factors were considered in discussions with the Staff in determining the amount of the purchase price to be allocated to in-process research and development such as, estimating the stage of development of each in-process research and development project at the date of acquisition, estimating cash flows resulting from the expected revenues generated from such projects and discounting the net cash flows, in addition to other assumptions. The remaining identified intangibles, including the value of purchased technology and other intangibles, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three and seven years, respectively. In addition, other factors were considered in discussions with the Staff in determining the value assigned to purchased in-process technology such as research projects in areas supporting the online store technology (including significant enhancement to the ability of the product to support multiple users and multiple servers), developing functionality to support the ability to process credit card orders, and enhancing the product’s user interface by developing functionality that would allow the product to be used outside of the United States. Starseed was a developer of technology that enabled the linking of topically related Web sites. Approximately $1.2 million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased technology which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over one year and approximately $24.0 million was allocated to goodwill which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. HyperParallel specialized in data analysis. Approximately $2.3 million of the total purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development. This amount was developed by estimating the stage of development of each in-process research and development project at the date of the acquisition, estimating incremental cash flows generated from such projects, and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 35%, which represents a premium to the Company’s cost of capital to F-3\n\n9. take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in-process technology. The projections were based on management’s estimates of market size and growth, expected trends in advertising and technology, expected research and development and selling and general adminis- trative expenditures, and the expected timing of new product introductions. Approximately $1.2 million of the total purchase price was allocated to existing technology which is being amortized over 3 years. The value of the existing technology was developed based on similar assumptions using a discount rate of 25%. The projections used in developing the values should not be considered an accurate predictor of future performance for several reasons, including the consideration of many factors outside the control of the Company. The remaining purchase price of approximately $4.6 million was allocated to goodwill which is being amortized over 7 years. Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material to the Company’s financial statements. Log-Me-On, founded in 1998, was a development stage entity with limited operations, no revenues, and four developers. As of the acquisition date, the Company’s efforts had been focused solely on developing a browser technology that was approximately 30% complete and there was no other technology developed or in process at such date. Approximately $9.8 million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development. This in-process research and development had not reached techno- logical feasibility and had no alternative future use. Additional development subsequent to the acquisition date principally relates to development of browser and toolbar technology that would allow users into Yahoo! sites without typing URLs or retrieving bookmarks, creation of the user interface, development of customization screens and procedures, and establishment of data links. The Company expects the development of this technology to be completed in the third quarter of 2000. Future research and development costs are not expected to be material to Yahoo!’s financial position or results of operations. In addition, if this technology is not successfully developed, Yahoo!’s revenues and profitability would not be materially adversely affected. The remaining purchase price of approximately $100,000 was allocated to the work force in place and is being amortized over the employment contract period. Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material to the Company’s financial statements. In February 1996, the Company and Rogers Media Inc. (‘‘Rogers’’) signed the Yahoo! Canada Affiliation Agreement whereby Yahoo! licensed certain intellectual property and development rights to Rogers, which Rogers utilized to operate Yahoo! Canada. On March 1, 1999, this agreement was terminated, as were all licenses and other rights and obligations granted under the agreement. As part of this agreement, Yahoo! acquired the Yahoo! Canada business including the URL, www.yahoo.ca.com, and existing advertising relationships from Rogers. Total consideration was $9 million in cash and the issuance of a note payable for $9 million which was settled in April 1999. The Company recorded an intangible asset of approximately $18 million which is being amortized over 10 years. The results of operations of Yahoo! Canada are included in the statement of operations of Yahoo! beginning March 1, 1999. In connection with the acquisition of ISSG, approximately $1.2 million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development. This in-process research and development had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Additional development subsequent to the acquisition date principally relates to the development and further adaptation of the technology to enhance the Company’s overall communications strategy. Future research and development costs are not expected to be material to Yahoo!’s financial position or results of operations. In addition, if this technology is not successfully developed, Yahoo!’s revenues and profitability would not be materially adversely affected. Of the remaining purchase price, $12.1 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years while $0.8 million was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In June 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of VivaSmart, Inc., through the issuance of 72,953 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately $8.9 million. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired, principally goodwill of $7.7 million, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Results of operations for F-4\n\n10. VivaSmart, Inc. for periods prior to the acquisition were not material to the Company and accordingly, pro forma results of operations have not been presented. Results of operations for VivaSmart, Inc. have been included with those of the Company subsequent to the acquisition date. The Company’s revenues are derived principally from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertise- ments. To date, the duration of the Company’s banner advertising commitments has ranged from one week to two years. Sponsorship advertising contracts have longer terms (ranging from three months to three years) than standard banner advertising contracts and also involve more integration with Yahoo! services, such as the placement of buttons that provide users with direct links to the advertiser’s Web site. Advertising revenues on both banner and sponsorship contracts are recognized as ‘‘impressions’’, or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the Company’s online properties, are delivered. Furthermore, advertising revenue is recognized provided that no significant Company obligations remain at the end of a period and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Company obligations typically include guarantees of minimum number of impressions; to the extent minimum guaranteed impressions are not met, the Company defers recognition of the corresponding revenues until the remaining guaran- teed impression levels are achieved. The Company also earns revenue from business services, electronic commerce transactions, and barter transactions. Business services revenues include fees for broadcasting live and on-demand events as well as hosting services and membership programs and are recognized in the month in which the service is performed, provided that no significant Company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Revenues from electronic commerce transactions are recognized by the Company upon notification from the advertiser of revenues earned by Yahoo!. Revenues from barter transactions are recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed in Yahoo! properties. Barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable in the circumstances. In determining the value of the goods or services provided, the Company uses historical pricing of comparable cash transactions. To date, revenues from electronic commerce transactions and barter transactions have each been less than 10% of net revenues. Revenues from business services were 10% of net revenues in 1999 and 9% and 7% in 1998 and 1997, respectively. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during 1999, 1998, and 1997. Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 Net Revenues Net revenues were $503.8 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2000, which represents an increase of 116% when compared with the corresponding period in 1999. Advertising Revenue. Of the total net revenues for six months ended June 30, 2000, advertising revenue was $457.0 million, which represents an increase of 116% when compared with the corresponding period in 1999. The increase was due primarily to the increasing number of advertisers purchasing space on the Company’s online media properties as well as larger and longer-term purchases by certain advertisers. Approximately 3,675 customers advertised on the Company’s online media properties during the quarter ended June 30, 2000 as compared to approximately 2,800 during the second quarter of 1999. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during the six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999. Advertising purchases by SOFTBANK and its consolidated affiliates, a 22% stockholder of the Company at June 30, 2000, accounted for less than 1% and approximately 5% of net revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Contracted prices on these orders are comparable to those given to other similarly situated customers of the Company. International revenues accounted for 15% of net revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2000 and less than 10% for the corresponding period in fiscal 1999. Barter revenues represented less than 10% of net revenues during those periods. There can be no assurance that customers will continue to purchase advertising on the Company’s Web pages, that advertisers will not make smaller or shorter-term purchases, or that market prices for F-5\n\n11. Web-based advertising will not decrease due to competitive or other factors. Additionally, while the Company has experienced strong revenue growth during the last three years, management does not believe that this level of revenue growth will be sustained in future periods. Business Services Revenue. Business services revenue consists of revenues generated from broadcast- ing live and on-demand audio and video events and subscription-based hosting services. Business services revenue comprised $46.8 million of total net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2000, which represents an increase of 120% when compared with the corresponding period in 1999. The increase is primarily attributable to the increasing number of events broadcasted by the Company and the increased number of users of the various hosting services. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the production and usage of Yahoo! and the Company’s other online media properties. These costs primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for content included on the Company’s online media properties, Internet connection charges, live event production costs, license fees, amortization of purchased technology, equipment depreciation, and com- pensation related expenses. The Company does not allocate any cost of revenues or operating costs to its business services segment as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the operating segment. Management does not believe that allocating these expenses is material in evaluating the segment’s performance. For the six months ended June 30, 2000, cost of revenues was $75.2 million, or 15% of net revenues compared to $46.4 million, or 20% of net revenues for the corresponding period in fiscal 1999. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues from quarter to quarter is primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity of content available on the Company’s online media properties, the increased usage of these properties, and an increase in license fees. The Company anticipates that its content and Internet connection expenses will increase with the quantity and quality of content available on Yahoo! online media properties, and increased usage of these properties. As measured in page views (defined as electronic page displays), the Company delivered an average of approximately 690 million page views per day in June 2000 compared with an average of approximately 315 million page views per day in June 1999. Yahoo! Japan, an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company, is included in these page view figures and accounted for an average of approximately 85 million page views per day in June 2000 and an average of approximately 22 million page views per day in June 1999. The Company anticipates that its content and Internet connection expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses were $186.8 million, or 37% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2000, as compared to $93.3 million, or 40% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses (which include distribution costs), compensation and employee-related expenses (which includes employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense), sales commissions, and travel costs. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and distribution costs associated with the Company’s aggressive brand-building strategy, increases in compensation expense associated with growth in its direct sales force and marketing person- nel, expansion in the international subsidiaries with the addition of subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Mexico subsequent to March 1999, and an increase in sales commissions associated with the increase in revenues. The Company anticipates that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in future periods as it continues to pursue an aggressive brand-building strategy through advertising and distribution, continues to expand its international operations, and continues to build its global direct sales organization. F-6\n\n12. Product Development Product development expenses were $54.1 million, or 11% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2000, as compared to $29.5 million, or 13% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999. Product development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses (which includes employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense) incurred for enhancements to and maintenance of the Company’s Web site, classification and organization of listings within Yahoo! properties, research and development expenses, amortization of capitalized Web site development costs, and other operating costs. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increases in the number of engineers that develop and enhance Yahoo! online media properties. The Company believes that significant investments in product development are required to remain competitive. Consequently, the Company expects to incur increased product development expenditures in absolute dollars in future periods. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $35.8 million, or 7% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2000, as compared to $18.2 million, or 8% of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation (which includes employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense) and fees for professional services, and the increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increases in these areas. The Company believes that the absolute dollar level of general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, as a result of an increase in personnel and increased fees for professional services. Amortization of Intangibles Total amortization expenses were $8.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 as compared to $6.7 million for the same period in fiscal 1999. The increase is principally attributable to goodwill amortization resulting from the November 1999 ISSG acquisition, which resulted in $12.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. Acquisition-Related Costs For the six months ended June 30, 2000, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge of $0.4 million relating to expenses incurred in connection with the February acquisition of Arthas.com. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, acquisition-related charges of $66.4 million included $56.6 million attributa- ble to the acquisitions of GeoCities, Encompass, Online Anywhere, and NetRoadshow, and a nonrecurring charge of $9.8 million for in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Investment Income, Net Investment income, net of expense, for the six months ended June 30, 2000 was $75.8 million as compared to $16.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher average investment balance and a gain from the exchange of certain equity investments in the amount of $40.7 million. Investment income in future periods may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in average cash balances maintained by the Company and changes in the market rates of its investments. Minority Interests in Operations of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries was $4.0 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2000 as compared to $1.2 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 1999. The change is attributable to the continuing profitable results recorded in the European and Korean joint ventures in the F-7\n\n13. aggregate during the six month period ended June 30, 2000 as compared to the corresponding year ago period. The Company expects that minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate will continue to fluctuate in future periods as a function of the results from consolidated subsidiaries. If the consolidated subsidiaries remain profitable, the minority interests adjustment on the statement of operations will continue to reduce the Company’s net income by the minority partners’ share of the subsidiaries’ net income. Income Taxes The Company’s effective income tax rate for the six month period ended June 30, 2000 was 44% and differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to state income taxes and nondeductible amortization charges related to acquisitions and non-deductible stock-based compensation charges. This rate may change during the remainder of 2000 if operating results or acquisition related costs differ significantly from current projections. The provision for income taxes for the six month period ended June 30, 1999 differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to nondeductible costs related to the acquisitions of GeoCities, Encompass, and Online Anywhere, nondeductible amortization charges related to other acquisitions, and a change in income tax regulations resulting in the recognition of certain acquired loss carryforward benefits. Net Income The Company recorded net income of $120.9 million or $0.20 per share diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2000 compared to net loss of $1.0 million or $0.00 per share diluted for the six months ended June 30, 1999. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2000 include non-recurring charges of $0.4 million incurred in connection with the February 2000 acquisition of Arthas.com, employer payroll taxes on option exercises of $8.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets of $13.0 million, a non-cash gain from the exchange of certain equity investments of $40.7 million, and goodwill amortization (included in investment income) of $1.5 million related to the Yahoo! Japan equity investment. The Company is subject to employer payroll taxes on employee exercises of non-qualified stock options. Assuming the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock was $125 per share on June 30, 2000, employer payroll taxes on unrealized gains related to vested and unvested non-qualified stock options would be approximately $48.1 million and $73.2 million, respectively. These employer payroll taxes would be recorded as a charge to operations (allocated between sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative) in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees. Net proceeds that the Company would receive upon the exercise of such vested and unvested stock options would approximate $360.7 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. In addition, the Company would receive tax deductions for gains realized by employees on the exercise of non-qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid-in capital. The Company’s quarterly results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that the stock options are exercised by employees and, consequently, the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed. Liquidity and Capital Resources for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 Yahoo! invests excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid, of high-quality investment grade, and predominantly have maturities of less than one year with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. As of June 30, 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities totaling $1.38 billion compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999. F-8\n\n14. For the six months ended June 30, 2000, cash provided by operating activities of $257.3 million was primarily due to net income before taxes. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, cash provided by operating activities of $46.4 million was primarily due to net income before taxes and other non-cash costs. Cash used in investing activities was $277.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Purchases (net of proceeds and maturities) of marketable securities and other investments during the period were $234.0 million and capital expenditures totaled $43.0 million. Capital expenditures have generally been comprised of purchases of computer hardware and software as well as leasehold improvements related to leased facilities, and are expected to increase in future periods. Cash used in investing activities was $115.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999. Purchases (net of proceeds and maturities) of marketable securities and other investments during the period were $94.2 million and capital expenditures totaled $20.9 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, cash provided by financing activities from the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options was $201.3 million and $61.8 million, respectively. During 1999, the Company entered into agreements for the development of an office complex in Sunnyvale, California, to be constructed from 2000 through 2003, and to serve as the Company’s new headquarters. Upon substantial completion of the buildings, the Company will collateralize a lease facility with deposited funds equal to the amount of the funds drawn on the facility by the lessors, estimated to range from $370 million to $380 million. Rent obligations for the buildings will bear a direct relationship to the lessors’ carrying costs. The amount of the rent obligation is contingent upon future events. The Company currently has no material commitments other than those under operating lease agreements. The Company has experienced a substantial increase in its capital expenditures and operating lease arrangements since its inception, which is consistent with increased staffing, and anticipates that this will continue in the future. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, and technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, which may require the use of cash. Management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet the Company’s operating requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, the Company may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance its liquidity position. The sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to the Company’s stockholders. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 Net Revenues Net revenues were $591.8 million, $245.1 million, and $84.1 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Advertising Revenue. Of the total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, advertising revenue was $535.4 million, $226.3 million, and $78.4 million, respectively. The increases from year to year are due primarily to the increasing number of advertisers purchasing space on the Company’s online media properties as well as larger and longer-term purchases by certain advertisers. Approximately 5,200 customers advertised on the Company’s online media properties during 1999 as compared to approximately 4,300 and 2,900 in 1998 and 1997, respectively. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. Advertising purchases by SOFTBANK and its consolidated affiliates, a 23% stockholder of the Company at Decem- ber 31, 1999, accounted for approximately 1% of net revenues during each of the years ended Decem- ber 31, 1999 and 1998 and 3% during the year ended December 31, 1997. Contracted prices on these orders are comparable to those given to other similarly situated customers of the Company. International revenues accounted for 10%, 7% and 4% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Barter revenues represented less than 10% of net revenues during those same F-9\n\n15. periods. There can be no assurance that customers will continue to purchase advertising on the Company’s Web pages, that advertisers will not make smaller and shorter-term purchases, or that market prices for Web-based advertising will not decrease due to competitive or other factors. Additionally, while the Company has experienced strong revenue growth during the last three years, management does not believe that this level of revenue growth will be sustained in future periods. Business Services Revenue. Business services revenue consists of revenues generated from broadcast- ing live and on-demand audio and video events and subscription-based hosting services. Business services revenue comprised $56.4 million, $18.8 million, and $5.7 million of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The year-to-year increases are primarily attributable to the increasing number of events broadcasted by the Company and the increasing number of users of the various hosting services. The Company broadcasted approximately 3,600 events during 1999, as compared to 1,800 and 742 during 1998 and 1997, respectively. Yahoo! Store, which was launched during the first quarter of 1998, comprised the most significant portion of revenue from hosting services. Yahoo! Store members totaled 9,000 and 3,500 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the production and usage of Yahoo! and the Company’s other online media properties. These costs primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for content included on the Company’s online media properties, Internet connection charges, amortization of purchased technology, equipment depreciation, and compensation related expenses. The Company does not allocate any cost of revenues or operating costs to its business services segment as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the operating segment. Management does not believe that allocating these expenses is material in evaluating the segment’s performance. Cost of revenues were $102.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, or 17% of net revenues, as compared to $52.2 million, or 21% of net revenues, and $19.9 million, or 24% of net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The absolute dollar increases in cost of revenues from year to year are primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity of content available on the Company’s online media properties, the increased usage of these properties, and the amortization of purchased technology. Unamortized purchased technology totaled $11.6 million as of December 31, 1999 and will be amortized through the fourth quarter of 2001. The Company anticipates that its content and Internet connection expenses will increase with the quantity and quality of content available on Yahoo! online media properties, and increased usage of these properties. As measured in page views (defined as electronic page displays), the Company delivered an average of approximately 470 million page views per day in December 1999 compared with an average of approximately 207 million page views per day in Decem- ber 1998 and an average of approximately 84 million page views per day in December 1997. Yahoo! Japan, an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company, is included in these page views figures and accounted for an average of approximately 39 million per day in December 1999, an average of approximately 13 million per day in December 1998, and an average of approximately 5 million per day in December 1997. The Company anticipates that its content and Internet connection expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses were $224.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, or 38% of net revenues. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, sales and marketing expenses were $125.0 million and $58.5 million, or 51% and 70% of net revenues, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses (which include distribution costs), compensation and employee related expenses (which include employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense), sales commissions, and travel costs. The year-to-year increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to an increase in advertising F-10\n\n16. and distribution costs associated with the Company’s aggressive brand-building strategy, increases in compensation expense associated with growth in its direct sales force and marketing personnel, expansion in the international subsidiaries with the addition of subsidiaries in Sweden, Australia, Singapore, Korea, Denmark, and Norway during 1997, Italy, Hong Kong, and Spain as well as Yahoo! guides in Spanish and Mandarin Chinese languages during 1998, and Taiwan, Brazil, China, and Mexico during 1999, and an increase in sales commissions associated with the increase in revenues. The Company anticipates that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in future periods as it continues to pursue an aggressive brand-building strategy through advertising and distribution, continues to expand its interna- tional operations, and continues to build its global direct sales organization. Product Development Product development expenses were $72.4 million, or 12% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $34.1 million and $16.7 million, or 14% and 20% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Product development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses (which include employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense) incurred for enhancements to and maintenance of the Company’s Web site, classification and organization of listings within Yahoo! properties, research and development expenses, amortization of capitalized Web site development costs, and other operating costs. The year-to-year increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to increases in the number of engineers that develop and enhance Yahoo! online media properties and increased amortization expense. The Company believes that significant investments in product development are required to remain competitive. Consequently, the Company expects to incur increased product development expenditures in absolute dollars in future periods. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $42.4 million, or 7% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $24.7 million and $12.9 million, or 10% and 15% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation (which includes employer payroll taxes assessed on non-qualified stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense) and fees for professional services, and the year-to-year increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to increases in these areas. The Company believes that the absolute dollar level of general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, as a result of an increase in personnel and increased fees for professional services. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization expense was $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. There was no amortization expense in 1997. The year-to-year increases are principally attributable to goodwill amortization resulting from the March 1999 Yahoo! Canada acquisition which resulted in $18.0 million in additional goodwill, the November 1999 ISSG acquisition which resulted in $12.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the June 1998 Viaweb acquisition and the December 1998 Starseed acquisition which resulted in a combined $48.3 mil- lion of additional goodwill and other intangible assets. Unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $66.5 million as of December 31, 1999 and will be amortized through the first quarter of 2009. Other—Nonrecurring Costs For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded nonrecurring costs of $88.0 million. These costs were primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses of $77.1 million in connection with the acquisitions of Encompass, GeoCities, Online Anywhere, broadcast.com and ONElist, Inc. The Company also recorded nonrecurring charges of $9.8 million and $1.2 million in connection with the F-11\n\n17. Log-Me-On and ISSG acquisitions, respectively, for in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company recorded nonrecurring costs of $21.2 million. These costs were primarily attributable to $17.6 million of in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Viaweb and HyperParallel. The Company also recorded non-recurring costs of $3.6 million for acquisition related expenses in connection with the acquisitions of Yoyodyne and SimpleNet. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recorded nonrecurring costs of $25.1 million, of which $21.2 million related to a one-time, non-cash charge to release the Company from obligations associated with an agreement with VISA and $3.9 million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisition of Four11. Investment Income, Net Investment income, net of expense, was $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $18.8 million and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The year-to-year increases are primarily attributable to a higher average investment balance. Investment income in future periods may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in average cash balances maintained by the Company and changes in the market rates of its investments. Minority Interests in Operations of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests in income from operations of consolidated subsidiaries was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to minority interests in loss from operations of consolidated subsidiaries of $68,000 and $727,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The change from loss from operations of consolidated subsidiaries in 1998 to income from operations of consolidated subsidiaries in 1999 was attributable to profitable results recorded in the European and Korean joint ventures for 1999. The decrease from 1997 to 1998 is primarily attributable to near break-even results in the European and Korean joint ventures in the aggregate. The Company expects that minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate will continue to fluctuate in future periods as a function of the results from consolidated subsidiaries. If the consolidated subsidiaries remain profitable, the minority interests adjustment on the statement of operations will continue to reduce the Company’s net income by the minority partners’ share of the subsidiaries’ net income. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1999 differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to nondeductible costs related to the Company’s acquisitions (primarily broadcast.com and GeoCities), nondeductible amortization charges related to other acquisitions, nondeductible stock-based compensation charges, and a change in income tax regulations resulting in the recognition of certain acquired loss carryforward benefits. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1998 differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to changes in the valuation allowance related to limitations on net operating losses of acquired companies and nondeductible acquisition related charges. No provision for income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 1997 as the Company had net operating losses. F-12\n\n18. Net Income (Loss) The Company recorded net income of $47.8 million or $0.08 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to net losses of $13.6 million and $43.4 million, or $0.03 and $0.11 per share diluted for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The results for 1999 include nonrecurring charges of $88.0 million incurred in connection with various 1999 acquisitions, employer payroll taxes on option exercises of $10.3 million, stock compensation expense of $10.4 million, and amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in certain acquisitions of $9.5 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The results for 1998 include nonrecurring charges of $21.2 million incurred in connection with various 1998 acquisitions, stock compensation expense of $2.5 million, and amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in certain acquisitions of $3.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The results for 1997 include the one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of $21.2 mil- lion recorded during the second quarter of 1997 for the restructuring of the Yahoo! Marketplace agreements with the Visa Group and the one-time charge of $3.9 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 1997 for costs incurred for the acquisition of Four11. Liquidity and Capital Resources for the Years Ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 Yahoo! invests excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid, of high-quality investment grade, and predominantly have maturities of less than one year with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities totaling $1.0 billion compared to $636.1 million and $136.6 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1999, cash provided by operating activities of $204.5 million was primarily attributable to earnings of $47.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $42.7 million, purchased in-process research and development of $11.0 million, tax benefits from stock options of $32.2 million, other non-cash charges of $10.4 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $49.1 million, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $51.1 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $22.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $22.3 million. The increase in deferred revenue relates principally to overall significant growth in revenue and increases in advanced payments on several new and relatively longer sponsorship agreements. For the year ended December 31, 1998, cash provided by operating activities of $81.4 million was primarily due to a net loss of $13.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.6 million, offset by purchased in-process research and development of $17.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $16.5 million, tax benefits from stock option plans of $17.8 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $34.1 million, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $22.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 1997, cash used in operating activities of $14.7 million was primarily due to the net loss of $43.4 million and increases in accounts receivable of $8.5 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.2 million, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $23.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.6 million, and increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $9.3 million, accounts payable of $4.7 million, and deferred revenue of $3.4 million. Cash used in investing activities was $451.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Purchases (net of sales and maturities) of investments in marketable securities, acquisitions, and other investments during the period were $399.1 million and capital expenditures totaled $52.4 million. Capital expenditures have generally been comprised of purchases of computer hardware and software as well as leasehold improvements related to leased facilities, and are expected to increase in future periods. Cash used in investing activities was $383.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Purchases (net of sales and maturities) of investments in marketable securities and other assets during the period were $360.7 million and capital expenditures totaled $23.0 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Sales and maturities (net of purchases) of investments in marketable securities during the period were $25.6 million and capital expenditures totaled $10.8 million. F-13\n\n19. Cash provided by financing activities was $284.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to stock option exercises. For the year ended December 31, 1998, cash provided by financing activities of $450.1 million was due primarily to the issuance of Common Stock to SOFTBANK in the net amount of $250 million during July 1998, the issuance of common stock as part of the broadcast.com July 1998 initial public offering in the net amount of $43.2 million, the issuance of Common Stock as part of the GeoCities August 1998 initial public offering in the amount of $84.3 million, the receipt of $25.0 million in connection with the sale of Mandatory Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 1997, cash provided by financing activities of $53.5 million was due primarily to the receipt of $7.9 million in connection with the sale of Preferred Stock and the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options. Year 2000 Update In order to reduce the risks of the Year 2000 compliance problem, Yahoo! established a Year 2000 Team which undertook a formal assessment of the impact of the Year 2000 problem. The formal process involved assessment of the following Yahoo! systems: • internal infrastructure systems; • hardware systems, including servers and systems used for date storage; • software systems, including applications, development tools and proprietary code; • infrastructure systems, including routers, hubs and networks; • facility systems, including general building functions, security, HVAC and related operations; • Yahoo! products, including Yahoo!’s Web site and related services; and • the systems of Yahoo! business partners, including content providers and ISPs. Yahoo! conducted its formal assessment of Year 2000 compliance by gathering information on each aspect of Yahoo!’s internal infrastructure, including all applications and hardware in use by Yahoo!, reviewing each component or application for date usage, and examining date representations. Yahoo! has not experienced any significant Year 2000 issues associated with its systems. Yahoo! focused on identifying and resolving any Year 2000 issues existing within the Yahoo! Web site and Yahoo!’s related services. Since the beginning of 2000, Yahoo! was not aware of any significant Year 2000 issues directly related to a failure of its products to be Year 2000 ready. With respect to vendor-supplied items and services, Yahoo! conducted an extensive review of product compliance information on such items and services available online, in vendor literature and through trade group information resources, contacted its vendors for compliance information, and maintained documen- tation of assessments that have been performed by such vendors or outside sources. Since the beginning of 2000, Yahoo! has not been negatively affected by the Year 2000 issue associated with these suppliers. Yahoo! did not incur material costs in this formal assessment process, and currently does not believe that the cost of any additional actions will have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition. The year 2000 is a leap year, and February 29, 2000 was a date frequently associated with the Year 2000 issue. In addition, some Year 2000 issues may not be discovered until well after January 1, 2000. As such, Yahoo! believes that risks associated with the Year 2000 issue may continue to exist after January 1, 2000. Yahoo! believes its most likely worst-case scenarios after January 1, 2000 will relate to undiscovered problems associated with its products, due to the inability to anticipate every possible Year 2000 problem, F-14\n\n20. or due to problems associated with the interaction between Yahoo!’s products and its vendors’ applica- tions. A failure in Yahoo!’s products could result in claims against Yahoo! and could materially and adversely affect Yahoo!’s financial condition and results of operations. Finally, Yahoo! believes that it has taken steps to identify and address Year 2000 issues within its various readiness programs. However, if efforts to identify and address Year 2000 issues in Yahoo!’s internal infrastructure, product readiness, and vendor base were unsuccessful, including those issues associated with the leap year, Yahoo! may experience unanticipated problems that could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. F-15\n\n21. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Yahoo! Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows (which statements are not presented separately herein) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s manage- ment; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As described in Notes 1 and 11, on August 31, 2000, Yahoo! Inc. merged with eGroups, Inc. in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. The accompanying supplementary consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger of Yahoo! Inc. with eGroups, Inc. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America proscribe giving effect to a consummated business combination accounted for by the pooling of interests method in financial statements that do not include the date of consummation. These financial statements do not extend through the date of consummation; however, they will become the historical consolidated financial statements of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries after financial statements covering the date of consummation of the business combina- tion are issued. In our opinion, the accompanying supplementary consolidated balance sheets and the related supple- mentary consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

(‘‘Yahoo!’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) is a global Internet communications, commerce, and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services to millions of worldwide users daily. The Company was incorporated in California on March 5, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. On May 18, 1999, the Company reincorporated in Delaware and changed the par value of its Common Stock to $0.001. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the reincorporation. The Company consummated the acquisition of eGroups, Inc. (‘‘eGroups’’) in August 2000 as well as various other acquisitions during 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, that were accounted for as poolings of interests.
