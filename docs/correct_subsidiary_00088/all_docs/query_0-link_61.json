        "text": "Hi Manoj,\n\nI agree with you. I also have strong CMMi background and I said in\n\ncomparison to that. Agile is certainly not as heavy as CMMi on metrics side.\n\nWhat we measure, drives behavior in an organization and I say this as I have\n\ncome across so many types of measures being organization wide metrics\n\ncoordinator in one of the large organization. I am all for code quality (or\n\nproduct quality) measures however I wish that these measures / metrics are\n\nhandled in mature way.\n\nWhat can be mature way? Lets take one analogy that we are having a puppet\n\nshow and puppet master is handling more than 10 strings to manage a splendid\n\nshow. Consider each string as one metric. Now, puppet master (or management)\n\nshould know when to pull which string, how much to pull, what strength to be\n\nused to pull/push the strings, etc to manage a splendid show (or high\n\nperforming culture).\n\nIn nutshell, Measures can be used and as well, be misused.\n\n--\n\nRegards,\n\nHariprakash Agrawal (Hari),\n\nhttp://opcord.com - OpCord provides services in the areas of Manual /\n\nAutomated Testing using QTP, Selenium, JUnit, AutoIT, Sahi, NUnit, VB/Java\n\nScript etc and Consulting / Trainings on Agile, CMMi, Six Sigma, Project\n\nManagement, Software Engineering etc.\n\nAbout me: http://www.linkedin.com/in/hariprakash\n\nOn Tue, Oct 5, 2010 at 10:43 AM, K G, MANOJ [AG/8042] <"
