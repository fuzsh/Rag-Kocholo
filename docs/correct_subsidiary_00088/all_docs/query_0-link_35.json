        "text": "If someone asked you, “Where do you go on the internet to look something up?” you likely would answer with “Google.” Before Google, though, Yahoo was the search engine go-to. Often outshined by its competitor, Google, Yahoo still exists today in much of the same capacity as its competitor.\n\nWhat Yahoo has struggled with, though, is maintaining its market share in this industry.\n\nEven when the company wasn’t performing well, Yahoo’s logo has remained a universally recognized one. Even if you never use a Yahoo application, the Yahoo logo is likely one you’ve encountered once, twice, or many times before.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Yahoo’s evolution as a brand and its evolution with its logo design, you came to the right blog post. Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll take a closer look at this company that paved the way for other tech companies to follow.\n\nMeet Yahoo\n\nEven if Yahoo may have started as a search engine, the Yahoo we use and know today encompasses so much more than that. Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was founded to search for different websites in one place.\n\nFounded in Stanford, Yahoo’s headquarters weren’t set up far from where it was founded. With headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, Yahoo evolved and grew right in the heart of Silicon Valley. We might even dare to say that Yahoo was one of the companies that helped establish Silicon Valley as a tech and start-up capital in the United States.\n\nToday, Yahoo is a global internet services company with services spanning from email to search engines to news to so much more. Its peak happened in 2007 when the website received 3.4 billion views, and since this peak, Yahoo has tried to maintain its status as a reputable and noteworthy internet conglomerate.\n\nThe Evolution of Yahoo\n\n1994-1997: Yahoo is born\n\nBefore there was Google, Yahoo was the go-to internet domain. Born out of a Stanford University dorm room, Jerry Yang and David Filo founded the company. Before Yahoo grew into a full-fledged online operation, Yahoo started much smaller, with a web directory.\n\nIn just one year, Yahoo reached one million views. Next up for the brand were two rounds of series funding, which propelled Yahoo to go public in 1996.\n\nAfter building out its web directory, Yahoo began to circulate news, sports, and finance updates to those using its online directory.\n\n1997-1999: Yahoo focuses on growing its services\n\nIn a quick effort to expand its services, Yahoo acquired Four11, which owned Rocketmail, in 1997.\n\nThe next year, in 1998, Yahoo expanded this directory even more. This time, Yahoo expanded to include email (which was formally Rocketmail), shopping, online games, travel tools, weather tracking, maps, and so much more.\n\nThese expanded services were born out of additional acquisitions from ClassGames.com, GeoCities, eGroups, and other tech companies. Yahoo was an early adapter in advancing alongside the internet and paved the way for many competing companies.\n\n2000-2005: Yahoo navigates the dot-com boom\n\nAfter Y2K, the internet experienced a boom, and Yahoo benefited from this. In 2000, Yahoo closed its stock at its highest price ever, $118.75. While Yahoo experienced a high at the start of 2000, the company also experienced an all-time low stock price in 2001.\n\nTo combat this decline, Yahoo began to frantically acquire more companies, primarily existing search engines, email providers, and Web 2.0 services that could help Yahoo rival competitors. Despite Yahoo’s attempts to combat this crash, the brand struggled to recover and never ended up back on top again.\n\n2006-2017: Yahoo goes through a series of different CEOs\n\nAs Yahoo tried to recover, the company brought on a series of new CEOs. Each CEO, though, had a different vision and failed to build on the work of the past CEO before them.\n\nFor instance, Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s’ CEO that reigned from 2012-2017, had hopes of transforming Yahoo into a mobile technology company but ultimately wasn’t able to see this plan through.\n\nIt’s important to note that this is only a high-level overview of Yahoo’s history as a brand, and much more took place beyond what we’ve highlighted in this article.\n\nRoadblocks Along the Way\n\nIf you asked various tech analysts, they probably would tell you that Yahoo experienced a series of roadblocks that stemmed from being a little too late to the acquisition game and from a series of poor strategic decisions.\n\nThe most crucial strategic missed opportunity was failing to be an early adapter to other services that could have been offered under the Yahoo umbrella. Coupled with Yahoo’s failed attempts at acquiring companies like Google, eBay, and YouTube, Yahoo struggled to keep its stock price and revenue as high as it was during the dot-com boom.\n\nIt also didn’t help that the companies that Yahoo did successfully purchase (like GeoCities and Broadcast.com), Yahoo purchased at a high buying price. Those companies, unfortunately, weren’t revenue generators, and the amount of money Yahoo spent to acquire these tech companies never really helped Yahoo in the long run.\n\nThe Meaning of Yahoo’s Logo and Yahoo’s Logo History\n\nIt’s common for tech logos to go through regular updates. As tech evolves, so do the logos of the companies in this industry. In this section, we’ll walk you through the seven different versions of the Yahoo logo to date.\n\nYahoo’s logo font:\n\nOver the years, Yahoo played around with different fonts. Some were more playful, some were thinner, and some were bolder. The current font features thick block lettering that is a unique sans-serif font. Rather than earlier fonts that were used, this font is easily scalable and legible whether it is online or printed on a physical medium.\n\nYahoo’s logo color:\n\nThe color that is tied to the Yahoo brand is purple. Purple often represents ambition, creativity, mystery, and power.\n\nThese are all components of the Yahoo brand and all components that Yahoo was hopeful this color could convey through its logo design.\n\nYahoo’s logo symbols:\n\nThe one symbol featured on Yahoo’s logo is an exclamation mark—the exclamation mark symbolizes energy, intensity, and major significance.\n\nThe exclamation point shows Yahoo’s early adaption into the internet space and how the brand has strived to maintain significance over the years.\n\nYahoo Today\n\nIf you looked at Yahoo today, you would still find a company focused on the wide range of services it once offered.\n\nThe only difference is that while Yahoo was once the standard and go-to internet spot, it now is an internet afterthought. Some people, though, have remained loyal to Yahoo and still regularly use it today. That and the fact that Yahoo left its imprint all over Silicon Valley has helped the business coexist alongside large competitors like Google.\n\nIn 2016, Yahoo’s core businesses were purchased by Verizon. The divisions that weren’t purchased were later dissolved. In 2021, Apollo Global Management set out to purchase and acquire 90% of Yahoo, leaving Verizon with 10%.\n\nToday, Yahoo’s headquarters can still be found in Sunnyvale, and as of 2020, Yahoo generated $7.4 billion. While Yahoo went through a string of CEOs who struggled to execute a strategic path forward, Yahoo’s current CEO is Jim Lanzone.\n\nMany former Yahoo employees have gone on to both start and work at several other tech companies across Silicon Valley, from WhatsApp to NextDoor to Facebook to Google itself.\n\nLessons Learned from Yahoo\n\nIf Yahoo had a motto today, that motto would be one focused on never giving up. The brand saw its peak and lowest point all in one year. For a company that experienced this volatile market performance, it’s impressive Yahoo was able to somehow find a way to stay relevant and stay on people’s minds. How Yahoo seemed to do this was through its logo design.\n\nThe Yahoo logo is bold, simple, and stands out. At the same time, the color choice directly ties to the spirit of the brand, and the font choice is highly legible no matter the size of the logo design.\n\nOver the years, Yahoo never altered its logo much, opting to stick to the same type of wordmark and color scheme. This helped the brand build recognition with users (and nonusers) even when the company wasn’t performing well.\n\nWhen you have a logo that resonates with people, that logo will stick in their heads even if your company experiences a tumultuous time, like Yahoo.\n\nAre you looking to design a logo for your business? If so, you might want to incorporate some of these lessons learned from Yahoo. The good news is that you don’t have to tackle this alone, though. When you’re ready to design a logo, head over to Hatchwise.\n\nHatchwise can partner with you on your logo wish list and turn those logo dreams into a reality."
