And most of them, as I am, are looking at alternatives should it be necessary to transition groups to another platform. I hope this will not become necessary but should it become necessary a plan will be in place. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n I will repot additionally on this matter as the situation evolves. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  AGAIN, DO NOT HIT REPLY.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Bob Chaparro \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Moderator \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n +++++ \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Hello, Fellow Yahoo Railroad Group Moderators - \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Those of you who follow the financial news regularly know that Yahoo has been struggling for several years. The last CEO brought in to turn the business around has not succeeded and Yahoo is looking for a buyer. The latest talk in business circles is that Verizon may buy Yahoo. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n The reason I bring this to your attention is that I suspect with or without a sale Yahoo will have to become more profitable to satisfy its investors. Additional significant revenue generation does not seem to be within Yahoo's grasp so cost cutting may be the road taken. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Which brings me to our Yahoo railroad groups. I fear that Yahoo will reduce the functionality of our groups, reduce service or perhaps eliminate the groups altogether. Perhaps they will impose a subscription fee, which would surely shrink membership. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n It's just hard to know at this point but you can be certain changes are coming. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n My question to you is, what contingency plan, if any, do you have to preserve your group should it be necessary for your group to leave Yahoo? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n I would like to see if there is a consensus among those of you operating the larger Yahoo railroad groups. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Thank you for listening. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Bob Chaparro \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Moderator \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n reposted by Dennis Austin \r\n\r\n ​ \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n__._,_.___",

I've got no problem with Yahoo's content, if I needed toe nail fungus remover I'd be grateful for the ad. and celebrities and weirdos sell product in this twisted society, that seems to be what people want. I've used Yahoo groups over the years but since MRH came on the scene I'd found it preferable to consolidate all my usage here instead of piecemeal on other sites. I do still play fantasy baseball on Yahoo every year.....DaveB\n\nSeems like an opportunity for\n\nSeems like an opportunity for the NMRA to provide a service to the hobby. If they provided the service to non-members and members alike, a good percentage of the users might join just to support the organization that provides the service.\n\nFlag the members name with an icon. Maybe make the email part of the service members only, with non-members having only on line access. Or keep it simple, open access for everyone to show the NMRA supports the hobby.\n\nI haven't heard that Verizon is actually planning on doing anything with Yahoo, so it's academic at this point. Maybe they are just collecting old internet service providers.\n\nGS\n\nBusiness model\n\nYahoo has been struggling like a number of others. What they want is for you to have them as your browser home page. They then can be your search engine, news source, etc. With mobile devices, social media and Google, that time has moved on. I doubt Verizon is interested for e-mail. They recently sold a significant part of that business to Frontier, who uses AOL to handle the e-mail.\n\nWhile in theory, it would be appropriate for the NMRA to provide the service for RR groups, they do not have the sponsor base to make it happen without some additional cost to the user. A group like MRH has that base. As Joe mentioned, there is some startup costs for what ever environment it is set up in. In this sense, the sponsors want exposer, so having more functions will increase their exposer. The question is \"does rhe model railroad sponsor community have deep pockets enough to provide the financial support for the additional functions?\"\n\nFrom a users perspective, it sounds great, makes a lot of sense and should be another game changer in the market place. While I would prefer it to be free, I would be willing to pay a fee for the service.\n\nJoe\n\nI would be willing to help on funding. Let me know what you need to make it happen Joe. Yahoo, whether you agree or disagree with them, has still provided a great service thru the years. Yes, it easy to kick them when they are struggling, but my email has performed flawlessly for over 30 years with them, and yes, I pay for the premium service. They allowed groups long before anyone knew what they were, and yes, just like anything free...it has ads. Google is not an end all result for anything. They have dropped more projects that were excellent ideas because Google lost interest...some of which were very expensive to individuals, Revolv being just the latest example. Google's famous \" Don't be evil \" went away in 2012 by their own admission, and it is nowhere to be found in the \" new \" Google...Alphabet, code of conduct. Google, and now Alphabet, has steadily proven that if they can not make massive amounts of money on a project they WILL drop it. NMRA is not an appropriate venue for such forums, it is a closed society, always has been...always will be, so why exclude the majority of model railroaders ?\n\nMichael\n\nMRH Groups? I thought you were nearly there already.\n\nJoe,\n\nI really thought that a lot of the vitality of the old Yahoo groups was already present with the variety of blogs, posts, and discussion forums that currently exist. Personally, I don't see Verizon's purchase as being anything but money down the toilet (and likely to drive up my package cost of Verizon services). They've been had, big time, on this acquisition. Yahoo has been circling the drain for years and the creditors have finally caught on.\n\nCase in point: I've had a Verizon email account for about 14 years now. I think I may have made one email when it first started. Have no idea what the password is, haven't been there since the first week I got Verizon after my local ISP gave up the ghost. Yahoo? Yeah, have an email account there for a couple of groups, but it's been forwarding the minimal traffic from those groups to my primary email address. Get about 3 emails a month. No idea what the account password is, haven't posted since the two primary groups I was interested in got moved to an adults-only area even though they deal with medical issues. That's been about 10 years. I don't think I've gone to Yahoo's home page since then.\n\nAds related to model railroading or even rail/tourist travel, would certainly be no problem for me, and I suspect most of the other subscribers and readers, because that's the 'price' we pay to read MRH. And it's stuff we're interested in. I've spent a lot more on model railroading over my life than on toenail fungus removers, and I don't expect that ratio to change.\n\nEven if it requires a subscription, I'd be willing to pay; perhaps rolling it in with Trainmasters TV as an additional feature for the term of that subscription would make financial sense for you.\n\nThanks for letting me put in my two cents.\n\nJanet\n\nI am a member of several Yahoo Groups, but.............\n\n.................have some issues with them that might get resolved if they \"moved\" somewhere. I know nada about the technical side of these groups but here goes. Posts are repeated over and over and every so often a \"reply\" is slid in. Then there are a few pages of gibberish (I think it's the code for the post) until you get to the next \"new\" post. Lastly, it seems I have to rest my pass word every couple of weeks when trying to view attachments. What's up with that? As a result of all of the above I visit them less and less as time goes on.\n\nI would not mind seeing them move somewhere that rectified these issues. If they moved here I would hope they would have a separate header to the right for groups and that their content would remain within that category, and that each group generate a \"digest\" that would be forwarded to our e-mail once a day, every 3 days, a week.....(you pick)........etc.\n\nThanks for listening......\n\nPeter\n\nMRH Groups\n\nAs the owner of several Yahoo groups, I'd love to be able to migrate those that are model-related to an MRH Groups service. Due to problems being experienced with Yahoo, I've already moved one to Google with okay results, but their limitations on the manual addition of new members when forming new groups there leaves it unsatisfactory for anything with larger membership numbers.\n\nI've also looked at Groups.io (referred to previously in this thread I believe - originating with one of the eGroups/Yahoo Groups founders), which seems like a great alternative, and offers some nice tools for moving groups - including their message and file/photo history I believe. However, something run by MRH and directly tied to model railroading would be far preferable if it offered similar functionality, and it seems like it'd be a nice way to drive more traffic to MRH.\n\nMigration?\n\nHey Joe, all,\n\nsome me yahoo groups have been around for a long time and have done a lot of good work. The work exists in the message archives, and in the files and photos sections. The work (in some cases at least is valuable within the Hobby.\n\nAs a list owner my question is would we be able to migrate the work, or just the members. If migration includes the work, then there is value to not only list owners, but also to members, and to the Hobby.\n\nif it's simply membership, well, many members are already here, and the existing forums, etc., are already available.\n\nid be willing to contribute to a Kickstarter campaign of the accomplishments of a group can be migrated.\n\nhope this helps,\n\njim\n\nIt would be nice to have the\n\nIt would be nice to have the groups moved to another venue. Particularly one that does not require an additional e-mail. I had been going to several groups on Yahoo at one time but since I only used the yahoo e-mail as a login and not for correspondence it was closed repeatedly. That then made the groups impossible to log into.\n\nGroups I was interested in involved many things not just model railroads. I would definitely be interested in the groups migrating from yahoo to a site that was operated intelligently like this one. Having banner ads on the top of pages such as the forum pages such as this would be no inconvenience at all as many of them would actually be of value to the readership.\n\nThe railroad groups would likely be different topics though, for example some were selling equipment, some were dealing with one railroad like the Virginian, or Wheeling and Lake Erie for examples. These things might have appeal to limited numbers of MRH readers separately for example, but several groups would collectively have a great deal of appeal. One way to defray the costs for such an effort would be to have a minimal fee for membership to as many groups as one desired to join. Say 12.00 per year payable via credit card or paypal, paypal users pay the paypal fees.\n\nThe individual group leaders would still be responsible for their membership management as well as policing the content. The fee should keep the advertisement to that which is of some value to the readership and somewhat limited in scope yet still allow for the bandwidth needed to provide the service."
