In accordance with the recently enacted Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, eGroups and Yahoo! requires your parent or guardian's consent to collect, use and disclose certain personal identifying information you may provide to us during the course of your use of our services.\n\nIf you would like to use eGroups' and Yahoo!'s services, please print the following materials as described below and have your parent or guardian complete and return them to us. If you have already completed a parental consent process with us you still need to submit the form below to maintain your account.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nThank you,\n\neGroups and Yahoo! Teams\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nDear Parent or Legal Guardian of DiAG-MAV.caritasRo-Stgt@t-online.de,\n\nDiAG-MAV.caritasRo-Stgt@t-online.de indicated that he/she is a child upon registering with eGroups, a Yahoo! company. In accordance with the recently enacted Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, eGroups and Yahoo! are seeking your consent to collect, use and disclose certain personal identifying information in the course of your child's use of our services.\n\nPlease note that Yahoo! has recently acquired eGroups. At this time, eGroups and Yahoo! members may only access eGroups and Yahoo! services independently, as separate services. But in the coming months eGroups and Yahoo! will be integrating services so that members of each service may access both companies' services seamlessly. When this occurs your child may be able to access Yahoo!'s services in addition to eGroups' services. We will notify you 30 days prior to this service integration with further information.\n\neGroups and Yahoo! are concerned about the safety and privacy of their members, particularly children. We are seeking your consent to collect and maintain the following information submitted by your child during registration for an eGroups account:\n\nEmail: DiAG-MAV.caritasRo-Stgt@t-online.de\n\nName:\n\nDate of Birth: 17/1/1989\n\nGender: Female\n\nAddress:\n\nCity:\n\nState:\n\nPostal Code: 89601\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nPlease review the eGroups Privacy Policy (http://www.egroups.com/info/privacy.html), and the Yahoo! Children's Privacy Policy (http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/kids) before completing the attached Parent/Guardian Consent Form. You may also request a copy of our privacy policies by contacting us at the address below. Neither eGroups nor Yahoo! will share the personally identifying information provided by your child during registration with a third party or other eGroups or Yahoo! members, except as may be necessary to comply with the law or legal process or after you have given your consent. You should be aware, however, that if your child posts to a public forum or discussion group on eGroups or Yahoo!, the child's e-mail address and any personal information he/she includes in the post, will be visible to the moderator, to members of the group and to anyone who may access the post.\n\nIN ORDER FOR YOUR CHILD TO USE EGROUPS AND YAHOO! SERVICES, YOU MUST SIGN THIS FORM AND FAX IT TO EGROUPS/YAHOO! AT THE NUMBER PROVIDED BELOW. PLEASE PRINT THIS MESSAGE NOW IF YOU WISH TO GIVE YOUR APPROVAL.\n\nNote: Consent forms are currently processed manually. It may take up to two weeks before your child is able to use the service.\n\nIf you have further questions about this notice, or if you at any time wish to review, update or delete personal identifying information provided by your child, please contact our Customer Support team, at support-coppa@egroups.com In addition, you may contact us at: eGroups/Yahoo! Customer Care, 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, (408) 731-3300.
