Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in this document as well as in other documents the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by the Company in fiscal year 2001.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nYahoo! Inc. (\"Yahoo!\" or the \"Company\") is a global Internet communications, commerce and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services. As the first online navigational guide to the World Wide Web (the \"Web\"), www.yahoo.com is the leading guide in terms of traffic, advertising, and household and business user reach. The Company also provides online business and enterprise services designed to enhance the productivity and Web presence of Yahoo!'s clients. These services include Corporate Yahoo!, a popular customized enterprise portal solution; audio and video streaming; store hosting and management; and Web site tools and services. The Company's global Web network includes 24 World properties. Yahoo! has offices in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Canada and the United States. The Company commenced operations in 1995, and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n\nUnder the Yahoo! brand, the Company provides broadcast media, communications, business, enterprise and commerce services. In December 2000, Yahoo!'s global audience grew to 180 million unique users who viewed an average of approximately 900 million Web pages per day on Yahoo!-branded online properties.\n\nIn general, the Company makes its properties available without charge to users, and generates revenue primarily through the sale of advertisements, promotions, sponsorships, merchandising and direct marketing. The majority of advertising on Yahoo! properties is sold through the Company's internal advertising sales force. Approximately 3,700 customers advertised on the Yahoo! Network during the fourth quarter of 2000, including 55 of the Fortune 100.\n\nMEDIA PROPERTIES AND SERVICES\n\nYahoo! Main Site\n\nThe Company's principal offering, www.yahoo.com, provides the flagship product for its global Internet media network. Yahoo! offers a comprehensive, intuitive and user-friendly online guide to Web navigation, aggregated informative content, communication services, a strong user community, and a commerce platform. Yahoo! includes a hierarchical, subject-based directory of Web sites, which enables Web users to locate and access desired information and services through hypertext links included in the directory. Yahoo! organizes Web site listings under the following 14 principal categories: Arts and Humanities, Business and Economy, Computers and Internet, Education, Entertainment, Government, Health, News and Media, Recreation and Sports, Reference, Regional, Science, Social Science, and Society and Culture. Web sites are further organized under these major headings by hierarchical subcategories. Users can either browse the directory listings by subject matter, or use a rapid keyword search facility that scans the contents of the entire directory or any subcategory within Yahoo!. The basic Web site listings are in many cases supplemented with brief descriptive commentary, and a special symbol is used to indicate listings that, in the view of the Company's editorial staff, provide unique presentation or content within their topic area. Yahoo! also provides Web-wide\n\n2\n\ntext search results from the Google search engine. These results are integrated into the directory search function so that Web-wide search results are presented in the absence of relevant listings from the Yahoo! directory.\n\nTargeted Online Properties and Services\n\nThe comprehensive subject-based, demographic and geographic listings in Yahoo! have provided a platform for the Company to develop and offer independent navigational tools and information services that are targeted to particular interests and Web users, and are presented within the familiar Yahoo! framework and style. Its Web-based media properties allow users to personalize and tailor the presentation of information and navigational resources. The Company has also developed a suite of communication and commerce services that facilitate interaction with the Yahoo! community and the greater Web community, and transactions among users and with merchants. The Company has strategic partners who develop localized or targeted content and/or provide a service under a Yahoo! brand or co-brand. The Company believes that tight integration of these services, if implemented successfully, will further strengthen customer loyalty to the Yahoo! brand and create additional revenue opportunities through a broader end user and advertiser base and increasingly targeted advertising and commerce opportunities.\n\nMedia Properties\n\nYahoo!'s Media properties focus on delivering information and entertainment conveniently to users from leading branded content providers, combined with other Yahoo! resources and related Web sites from the Yahoo! directory. Use of most properties is free, and many require registration.\n\nSubject-Based Properties\n\nThe Company has developed properties organized around subjects such as Sports, News, Weather, Music, and Finance. Yahoo! Entertainment aggregates information about recreation and leisure activities as well as interactive experiences through properties such as Yahoo! Movies, Music, TV, Games, and Chat Events. Yahoo!'s Full Coverage organizes hypertext links to Web sites featuring current events and issues of interest, such as elections, holidays, political issues and major weather conditions, organized in a topical format and updated regularly. Yahooligans!, a version of Yahoo! designed for children aged 7 to 12, includes content and a directory of Web sites selected by experienced educators who evaluate the sites for appropriate content and links, applicability to school curricula, and interest.\n\nContent integrated into subject-based properties include real-time news (provided by numerous sources including Reuters New Media, Associated Press, Deutsche Presse Agentur, & Agence France Presse), stock quotes (Reuters), corporate earnings reports (Zacks), audio and video news (AVC News & National Public Radio), mutual fund holdings (Morningstar), stock investing commentary (Motley Fool, CBS MarketWatch, & The Street.com), sports scores (ESPN SportsTicker & STATS, Inc.), sports commentary (The Sporting News), weather information (Weathernews, Inc. & AccuWeather, Inc.), and entertainment industry news (E! Online & RollingStone).\n\nRich Media Integration and Services\n\nYahoo! is focused on developing dynamic and robust properties, including rich media in the form of audio and video content. Yahoo! Music gives users the ability to watch and listen to Internet broadcasts from top music talent across virtually every musical genre, download and purchase both secure and open audio files, remix selected music tracks online, and view on-demand video channels. Yahoo! Sports offers live audio broadcasts of professional sporting events, such as the NBA, NFL and MLB games, and live audio or video broadcasts of certain leading collegiate events, including football and men's and women's basketball from such institutions as Michigan, Alabama and Syracuse. Yahoo! Sports also provides a host of daily audio and video highlight clips, press conferences and live and archived coaches shows. Yahoo! News offers live newscasts along with an expanded catalog of local and nationwide stories. In addition to rich media integrated throughout Yahoo!'s traditional media properties, the Company maintains a central hub for access to licensed audio and video content, which includes concerts, audio books, radio shows, company conference calls, and all of its sports, news and music content. Yahoo! FinanceVision, launched during 2000, is a live, web-based financial network that provides viewers in-depth market coverage, investing insight from third-party sources, morning brokerage calls, and news and commentary from a broad array of premier editorial sources. Yahoo! FinanceVision creates an integrated consumer experience of personalized data and streaming audio and video.\n\n3\n\nCommunications Properties\n\nYahoo! has established itself as a leading communications hub on the Internet with properties that have become essential services to many of its users. Through its integrated Mail, Groups, Chat, Messenger, Message Boards and Greetings products and services, registered Yahoo! members are given powerful ways to communicate one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. Yahoo! Mail, the Company's free email service, is one of the most popular on the Web, and the Yahoo! Groups platform enables over 17 million members to communicate with other individuals of similar interests. Yahoo! has also developed a suite of services which help users manage their personal information, such as Address Book, Calendar, and Briefcase. Users can access their personal information from the Web through their personal computers or other devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA's), pagers and cell phones, using Yahoo! Mobile and Intellisync for Yahoo!.\n\nDuring 2000, Yahoo! launched a powerful suite of voice services aimed at increasing the convenience for members to access information and communicate with anyone worldwide. These services, including Yahoo! by Phone, Voicemail, Voice-Enabled Email and PC to Phone Calling, offer consumers a convenient way to gain easy access to their online information from familiar devices and remain connected. With Yahoo! by Phone, people use a touch-tone keypad on any phone to gain easy access to Yahoo!'s essential services, including Yahoo! Mail, which is read to the user using advanced text-to-speech technology. Consistent with the Company's focus of enabling its members to communicate with anyone, anywhere, Yahoo! Messenger was enabled with a PC to Phone calling feature providing free long distance services (through our partner, Net2Phone) anywhere in the United States.\n\nCommunity services epitomize the fundamental essence of Yahoo!'s communication products. Whether it is Yahoo! Clubs, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Experts, Yahoo! Personals, Yahoo! Photos, Yahoo! Member Directory, Yahoo! Message Boards or Yahoo! GeoCities, Yahoo!'s member community has the tools necessary to create and build relationships through worldwide publishing and communication. Members can create GeoCities Home Pages, taking advantage of Yahoo! PageBuilder or Yahoo! PageWizard, join a Club or Group with other members of similar interests or share pictures with family and friends around the world.\n\nPersonalized Information Services\n\nMy Yahoo!, the Company's personalized Web information service, allows registered members to create a personal profile which organizes and delivers information of personal interest to the user via a user-customized interface. Users are able to capture their favorite Yahoo! products and services in one convenient location. From essential information and services, such as news, stock quotes, stock portfolio management, national headlines, local and national weather and sports scores, to more specific applications such as movie show times, ski reports, best travel fares, health tips and traffic reports, Yahoo!'s members have information of personal interest available at their fingertips in a customized format. Members are also able to conveniently monitor and transact business through use of the Auctions module or the Yahoo! PayDirect person-to-person payment mechanism. With the My Yahoo! platform, Yahoo! is able to deliver targeted product, advertising and transaction-based services.\n\nYahoo!'s Member Services are designed to enable efficient use of Yahoo!'s products and services worldwide. A cornerstone of these services is the universal registration system that permits users to easily access products and services, including My Yahoo!, Yahoo! Chat, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Portfolios, Yahoo! Message Boards, Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! Auctions, Yahoo! Clubs, Yahoo! Address Book, and Yahoo! Calendar, under a single username. Other Member Services include Yahoo! Wallet, which enables users to enter their financial, billing and shipping information into a secure location once and reuse the information for purchases throughout the Yahoo! Network without re-entering the information, and Yahoo! Companion, a browser add-on that enables users to conveniently access Yahoo!'s product and services from anywhere on the Web. Finally, the Yahoo! Points program encourages loyalty by allowing users to earn points for using services such as Yahoo! Travel and Yahoo! Shopping, and redeem them for prizes.\n\nCommerce Properties\n\nOne of the Company's primary strategies is to provide a marketplace for commerce on the Web. Through sponsorship arrangements with premier merchants, Yahoo! offers its members the opportunity to purchase a wide variety of goods and services such as automotive services (Ford), books (Barnes & Noble.com), brokerage services (E*Trade, Datek, Ameritrade & National Discount Brokerage), flowers (FTD & 1-800-Flowers.com), health care\n\n4\n\n(Healtheon/WebMD), mortgages (E-Loan), music (ARTISTdirect), and traditional communications services (AT&T Wireless). In addition to providing sponsorship opportunities, Yahoo! provides retail merchants the ability to build or seamlessly integrate their existing Web sites into the Yahoo! network, allowing merchants to more effectively utilize Yahoo!'s tools and commerce technologies. The addition in 2000 of a number of new, brand name merchants joining Yahoo! Shopping, including saksfifthavenue.com, Target, Circuit City, JCPenney.com, Handspring and Crutchfield, reinforces Yahoo! Shopping's position as a leading portal shopping destination on the Web.\n\nYahoo!'s popular array of e-commerce services allows users to find, connect, sell or buy in one central Web location. The spectrum of commerce offerings within the Yahoo! network, including Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! Store, Yahoo! Auctions, Yahoo! Classifieds, Yahoo! Travel, and Yahoo! Site, enables Yahoo! users to interact with a secure, convenient and powerful platform to conduct transactions and build community. Yahoo! directly enables transactions through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! Store and Yahoo! Auctions. Yahoo! Store provides merchants looking to sell products and services on the Web with a convenient, cost-effective and easy-to-use interface for building a web-site, processing orders, managing inventory and promoting their offerings. Taking advantage of Yahoo! Store's technology, Yahoo! Shopping allows merchants large and small to integrate their already developed commercial web sites into the Yahoo! Shopping network where consumers can compare and select items to purchase with a credit card, using Yahoo!'s universal Shopping Cart and Wallet technologies. Yahoo! Shopping is a consumer-focused site, aggregating prominent merchants and their wares in categories ranging from music, books and jewelry to apparel, electronics and collectibles. As of December 2000, Yahoo! Shopping and Store included over 13,000 merchants, including Brooks Brothers, Coach, Eddie Bauer, The Gap, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Macys, OfficeMax, Victoria's Secret and Zales. Yahoo! Auctions enables consumers and businesses to auction items online in 12 different categories including Antiques, Art & Collectibles, Business & Office, Computers, Home & Garden, Toys, Games & Hobbies, and Sports Cards & Memorabilia. Yahoo! also facilitates transactions on a referral basis in Classifieds properties such as Autos, Real Estate and Employment.\n\nThe year ended December 31, 2000 was marked by a number of enhancements to Yahoo!'s commerce properties including the launch of My Shopping which enables consumers to easily aggregate relevant purchasing information, personalized content, and their favorite stores in one centralized Web location. ShoppingVision, a rich media extension of Yahoo! Shopping, provides consumers with a dynamic way to buy products conveniently on the Web, enabling shoppers to view streaming video content and simultaneously purchase relevant merchandise through a single interface.\n\nFor businesses looking to simplify their purchasing process, the Yahoo! B2B Marketplace serves as a one-stop, business-to-business directory offering a comprehensive collection of equipment, inventory and product listings from many of the Web's leading B2B commerce sites. This B2B Marketplace complements Yahoo!'s successful commerce and communications solutions, providing business users with everything they need to research, price and purchase products for their businesses.\n\nYahoo! PayDirect, an online person-to-person payment solution, is a service that enables U.S.-based Yahoo! consumers to request, receive, send and make payments over the Internet, eliminating the need for mailing paper checks and money orders. It is supported by CIBC National Bank, which provides the necessary banking and fund transfer capabilities. Yahoo! also expanded its relationship with Visa U.S.A., the largest consumer payments system in the United States, to provide Visa's payer authentication services and create a more convenient and secure shopping experience for consumers. The launch of the Yahoo! Buyer Protection Program, backed by insurance obtained from Lloyd's of London, serves to protect purchases on Yahoo! Auctions and was developed in an on-going effort to give consumers increased trust and confidence when making online purchases.\n\nYahoo! also enhanced its mobile commerce services with the launch of Yahoo! PayDirect and Yahoo! Local Sales on Internet-enabled mobile phones in the United States. Yahoo! Local Sales provides mobile consumers with a one-stop source to find advertised sales and specials offered on products in local stores. Yahoo! PayDirect enables Yahoo! consumers to send or receive money online from any Internet-enabled phone. Yahoo! Shopping is also wireless enabled, providing wireless consumers with the ability to research, browse specific product offerings or comparison shop through one convenient device.\n\n5\n\nGeographic Properties\n\nThe Company seeks to build upon its global user base by developing Internet properties focused on geographic regions, which include foreign countries as well as domestic metropolitan areas. The Company has launched numerous geographically targeted Web properties. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 8 \"Segment and Geographic Information\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nInternational Online Properties. The Company has developed 24 international online properties in 13 languages, including localized versions of Yahoo! in Argentina, Asia, Australia & New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom & Ireland, in addition to Yahoo! guides in Spanish, Mandarin Chinese and Canadian French languages. Outside the English-speaking markets, the Company has built independent directories of local language Web sites and other content, developed by native speakers of each language. The Company owns a majority or 100% of its non-US operations (except in Japan), and has established Yahoo! offices in 26 different locations internationally to ensure the local development of these businesses. The Company has pursued a consistent strategy of content aggregation with best of breed third parties and intends to rollout the full range of its products and services for all these markets. During 2000, the Company launched Yahoo! Argentina, Yahoo! India and Yahoo! Canada en francais, featuring an extensive Web directory of Web sites and comprehensive local programming (news, finance, sports, weather and movies) and communication services (mail, chat, messenger and clubs).\n\nThe Company's joint ventures with SOFTBANK Corp. and its affiliates, a holder of 21% of the Company's Common Stock as of December 31, 2000, include Yahoo! Japan, Yahoo! Europe (separate companies formed in Germany, the United Kingdom and France) and Yahoo! Korea. The joint ventures were formed to establish and manage local versions of Yahoo! in the respective countries. As of December 31, 2000, Yahoo! owns approximately 34%, 70% and 67% of Yahoo! Japan, Yahoo! Europe and Yahoo! Korea, respectively.\n\nLocal Online Properties. Yahoo! Get Local offers extensive information for all 50 states, 219 metropolitan areas and more than 30,000 counties and cities in the United States. The property provides users with comprehensive local Web programming, including sports, weather, classifieds, events, maps, restaurants, shopping, news, yellow pages, white pages, entertainment, and community information. Yahoo! Get Local is also integrated into the main directory of Yahoo!, which enhances the subcategories under the Regional category of the main Yahoo! hierarchy, giving individuals easy access to a wealth of local information.\n\nPrint and Other Offline Properties\n\nThe Company seeks to extend the Yahoo! brand into print and other offline media, primarily for the purpose of promoting the brand and creating greater demand for the Company's online properties. The Company continued its agreement with Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, formerly affiliated with SOFTBANK, for the publication of Yahoo! Internet Life, a monthly print magazine companion to the online magazine. The publication was recently sold to Willis Stein & Partners. In addition, the Company has entered into a multi-book arrangement with Byron Preiss to publish Yahoo! branded Internet reference guides. The Company also has licensing relationships for merchandise in various categories such as digital cameras, digital music players, and computer hardware accessories. Royalty revenues under these arrangements have been and are expected to continue to be nominal.\n\nADVERTISING, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, AND BUSINESS SERVICES\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of advertising elements, including placement fees, promotions, banner advertisements, sponsorships, direct marketing, and transaction fees generated from the sale of merchandise on Yahoo! properties. The Company's advertising products currently consist of banner advertisements that appear on pages within Yahoo! properties, higher profile promotional sponsorships that are typically focused on a particular event, such as a sweepstakes, and merchant sponsorship buttons on targeted advertising inventory encouraging users to complete a transaction. Direct marketing revenues result from email campaigns targeted to certain members of the Yahoo! registered community who have indicated a willingness to receive such promotions. Hypertext links are embedded in each banner advertisement, button or directed email to provide\n\n6\n\nthe user with instant access to the advertiser's Web site, to obtain additional information or to purchase products and services.\n\nAlthough a significant amount of advertising purchases on Yahoo! properties are for general rotation on pages within the Yahoo! network, the Company also offers increasingly targeted properties that are designed to deliver greater value to advertisers through more focused audiences. By developing an extended family of Yahoo!-branded properties, the Company seeks to offer advertisers a wide range of placement options and promotional opportunities. Yahoo!'s Fusion Marketing is an integrated set of sales and marketing tools built on Yahoo!'s network and global audience. It consists of innovative, interactive marketing programs designed to provide one-stop shopping for companies seeking to secure a measurable Internet presence. Extending the depth of its advertising services in 2000, Yahoo! launched the Yahoo! Buzz Index, an interactive market research system developed by Yahoo! to measure public engagement with brands, products, people and technologies on the Internet. By aggregating and ranking the search queries of Yahoo!'s monthly users, the Yahoo! Buzz Index provides insight into the interests of the world's largest connected audience. Yahoo! also introduced Yahoo! Full Service, an interactive suite of data-driven tools and services, which enhances a media program and enables marketers to more easily achieve their objectives.\n\nAdvertising Services\n\nAs of December 2000, sales professionals were employed in fourteen locations across the U.S.: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The Company's sales organization consults regularly with agencies and customers on design and placement of Web-based advertising, and provides clients with measurements and analyses of advertising effectiveness.\n\nIn international markets, Yahoo!'s advertising sales are also principally handled by the Company's internal sales representatives. In some countries, including several where the Company has not established full operational capacity and localized properties, sales agency relationships have been put in place.\n\nThe Company offers many forms of advertising which have varying price ranges. In addition to targeted and general rotations of banner advertising, the Company offers premium positions on Yahoo! properties that typically are used in connection with promotions and special events. The Company's strategy is to use these sponsorship positions for high-profile promotions that can also result in additional visibility and awareness for Yahoo!. Yahoo! has also created special holiday- and event-oriented promotional spaces for occasions such as Back to School, Halloween and Christmas.\n\nE-Commerce Services\n\nYahoo! offers a technology platform directed toward the complete deployment of a commerce enabled Web site with email, reporting, payment processing, and search functionality. This technology is currently available in the Yahoo! Shopping and Store properties enabling large and small merchants to transact business online. The Company generates revenue from monthly hosting fees and through receiving a percentage of online sales from its merchant partners. Additionally, Yahoo! enables businesses and individuals to sell products and services online through Yahoo! Auctions. The Yahoo! Auctions service is currently free to buyers; sellers are required to pay a nominal listing fee. The Company generates auction revenues from advertising, featured auction listings and item listings based on dollar value.\n\nBusiness Services\n\nYahoo! Broadcast is a leading provider of streaming media, communications and collaboration tools to business customers. Whether it be live product launches, global corporate meetings or distributed learning, Yahoo! Broadcast's tools, infrastructure and partnerships are integrated to provide the solutions businesses seek for their complex business problems. During 2000, Yahoo! Broadcast launched the Webcast Studio Player and Corporate Broadcast Center applications, which offer enhanced data tools, new dynamic interfaces and advanced self-service capabilities, enabling customers to individually design solutions that fit their needs. Revenues are generated directly from business customers utilizing these turnkey-streaming services. To create visibility and promote access to their online events, businesses may also purchase online advertising throughout the Yahoo! network to drive increased traffic and awareness. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 8 \"Segment and Geographic Information\" of the\n\n7\n\nNotes of the Consolidated Financial Statements which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDuring 2000, the Company announced Corporate Yahoo!, a customized enterprise information portal based on the My Yahoo! platform. Corporate Yahoo! enables companies to integrate proprietary corporate content and applications with Yahoo!'s personalized Internet content and services behind existing firewalls. Yahoo! and TIBCO, a provider of real-time infrastructure software for e-business, co-developed the Yahoo! Portal Builder software which is used in customizing Corporate Yahoo! to fit the needs of the client's organization. Specifically, this software allows portal administrators to control the aggregation, personalization and delivery of content, services and applications that will be accessed by end-users. Corporate Yahoo! will leverage existing Yahoo! platforms, including mail, personal information management, content aggregation, wireless delivery and broadcast streaming, in addition to offerings from strategic partners such as Inktomi (search technology), Netegrity (security), SmartForce (online training), and WebEx (web-conferencing). The Company has relationships with Hewlett-Packard and Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) to deliver customized portal solutions leveraging Corporate Yahoo!.\n\nSTRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\nIn order to serve users more effectively and to extend the Yahoo! brand to new media properties, the Company has entered into relationships with business partners who offer content, technology, and distribution capabilities.\n\nContent and Commerce Relationships\n\nYahoo! has entered into strategic alliances with selected leading original content providers including ABC News, AccuWeather, Billboard, CNET, CNN, Forbes, Fox News, infoUSA.com, Muze, National Basketball Association, the National Football League, New York Post, Primedia, Reuters, RollingStone, The Sporting News, SportsTicker, The Wall Street Journal, Weathernews and Ziff-Davis, which permit the Company to bring Yahoo!-branded, targeted media products to market more quickly, while avoiding the cost of producing original editorial content.\n\nDistribution Relationships\n\nIn order to broaden Yahoo!'s user base, the Company has established relationships with commercial online services, Internet access providers, OEMs and operators of leading Web sites. The Company believes these arrangements are important to the promotion of Yahoo!, particularly among new Web users who may first access the Web through these services or Web sites. These arrangements typically are terminable upon short or no notice.\n\nLeading Web Sites. The Company has relationships with content, co-marketing and distribution partners to provide Yahoo! branding and links from partners' sites. In addition, millions of Web pages on the Internet voluntarily link to Yahoo!.\n\nOEMs. During 2000, Yahoo! had distribution agreements with personal computer manufacturers including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Gateway, and Toshiba whereby links to Yahoo! services are offered on the desktop of new computers.\n\nAlternative Devices. In 1999, the Company significantly increased its efforts to distribute Yahoo! information and services to non-PC devices, beginning with the acquisition of Online Anywhere. As part of its Yahoo! Everywhere service strategy, the Company has entered into certain global relationships with various wireless vendors to distribute a range of Yahoo! services including My Yahoo!, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Weather, Yahoo! Calendar, Yahoo! Address Book, Yahoo! Movies and Yahoo! Auctions. During 2000, Yahoo! announced the following additional services to the Yahoo! Everywhere service: Yahoo! Yellow Pages, Yahoo! Driving Directions and Yahoo! People Search. These global relationships include AT&T Wireless Services (PocketNet); Bell Mobility (Canada); British Telecom (UK); D2 Mannesman (Germany); France Telecom (France); Telefonica (Spain); Motient (eLink); Motorola (Internet connected wireless devices); Siemens (Germany); Sprint (Sprint PCS phones); Telecom Italia Mobile (Italy) and 3Com (Palm).\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nWe are in a highly competitive industry and some of our competitors may be more successful in attracting and retaining customers.\n\nThe market for Internet products and services is highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify. Negative competitive developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our stock.\n\n8\n\nWe compete with many other providers of online navigation, information, entertainment, business, community, electronic commerce and broadcast services. As we expand the scope of our Internet offerings, we will compete directly with a greater number of Internet sites, media companies, and companies providing business services across a wide range of different online services, including:\n\ncompanies offering communications services either on a stand alone basis or integrated into other products and media properties; vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition, and other factors; manufacturers of personal computers who may develop their own Internet portals to which they would direct their customers; online merchant hosting services; and online broadcasting of business events.\n\nIn particular, we face significant competition from the newly combined AOL Time Warner and Microsoft (MSN). The combination of America Online and Time Warner provides America Online with content from Time Warner's movie and television, music, books and periodicals, news, sports and other media holdings; access to a network of cable and other broadband delivery technologies; and considerable resources for future growth and expansion. The America Online/Time Warner combination also provides America Online with access to a broad potential customer base consisting of Time Warner's current customers and subscribers of its various media properties. To a less significant extent, we also face competition from other companies that have combined a variety of services under one brand in a manner similar to Yahoo! including CMGI (Alta Vista), Excite@Home, and Lycos. In certain of these cases, most notably AOL Time Warner and MSN, our competition has a direct billing relationship with the user, which we generally lack. This relationship permits our competitors to have several potential advantages including the potential to be more effective than us in targeting services and advertisements to the specific taste of their users. We also face competition from Web sites focused on vertical markets where expertise in a particular segment of the market may provide a competitive advantage. On an international level, we compete directly with local providers; they may have several advantages, including greater knowledge about the particular country or local market and access to significant financial or strategic resources in such local markets. We must continue to obtain more knowledge about our users and their preferences as well as increase our branding and other marketing activities in order to remain competitive and strengthen our market position.\n\nA large number of these Web sites and online services as well as high-traffic e-commerce merchants such as Amazon.com, Inc. also offer or are expected to offer informational and community features that may be competitive with the services that we offer. In order to effectively compete, we may need to expend significant internal engineering resources or acquire other technologies and companies to provide or enhance such capabilities. Any of these efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and be dilutive to our stockholders.\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS\n\nOur intellectual property rights are costly and difficult to protect. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\n\nWe regard our copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and similar intellectual property, including our rights to certain domain names, as critical to our success. We rely upon trademark, patent and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. For example, we have obtained the registration for certain of our trademarks, including \"Yahoo!\" and \"Yahooligans!.\" Effective trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed or made available through the Internet, and while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our licensees, our licensees may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or the reputation of our products and media properties. We are aware that third parties have, from time to time, copied significant portions of Yahoo! directory listings for use in competitive Internet navigational tools and services. Protection of the distinctive elements of Yahoo! may not be available under copyright law. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.\n\n9\n\nMany parties are actively developing search, indexing, e-commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as a variety of online business models and methods. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including, but not limited to, seeking patent protection. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies and rights associated with online business are likely to arise in the future. In addition to existing patents and intellectual property rights, we anticipate that additional third-party patents related to our services will be issued in the future. From time to time, parties assert patent infringement claims against us in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communications. Currently, we are engaged in two lawsuits regarding patent issues and have been notified of a number of other potential disputes.\n\nIn addition to patent claims, third parties have asserted and most likely will continue to assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights. In the event that we determine that licensing patents or other proprietary rights is appropriate, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to license such proprietary rights on reasonable terms or at all. We may incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights such as patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other third party rights such as publicity and privacy rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability or be prevented from using the rights, which could require us to change our business practices in the future.\n\nWe are aware of lawsuits filed against two of our competitors regarding the presentment of advertisements in response to search requests on \"keywords\" that may be trademarks of third parties. Initial rulings in these lawsuits were in favor of our competitors, but the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have appealed these initial rulings.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December 31, 2000, the Company had 3,259 full-time employees. Yahoo!'s future success is substantially dependent on the performance of its senior management and key technical personnel, and its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. See the \"Risk Factors\" section below for a further discussion of certain risks related to our employees.\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nFinancial results for any particular period will not predict results for future periods.\n\nBecause of the uncertain nature of the rapidly changing market we serve, period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not likely to be meaningful. In addition, you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance. In particular, although we experienced strong revenue growth through the year 2000, we do not believe that this level of revenue growth will be sustained in 2001 and in future periods, particularly on a long-term basis, and we recently announced that at the current time, we expect our first quarter 2001 revenues to be substantially less than our fourth quarter 2000 reported revenues. In addition, we currently expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expand our sales and marketing operations, continue to develop and extend the Yahoo! brand, fund greater levels of product development, develop and commercialize additional media properties, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We also hold investments in securities of technology companies. Due to the recent volatility in the stock market in general, and the market prices of securities of technology companies in particular, we have realized decreases in the market value of such investments of $163.2 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2000 which has been recorded on our financial statements. We may realize further decreases in the market value of certain investments in future periods. Further, we are subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their non-qualified stock options. The employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee's gain, which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price. During a particular period, these payroll taxes could be material. Depending on the number of shares of our Common Stock for which options are exercised and the fair market value of shares of our Common Stock during such period, these employer payroll taxes would be recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees. In addition to the net proceeds we would receive upon the exercise of stock options, we would receive tax deductions for gains realized\n\n10\n\nby employees on the exercise of non-qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid-in capital. However, because we are unable to predict our future stock price and the number of optionees who may exercise during any particular period, we cannot predict what, if any, expense will be recorded in a future period and the impact on our future financial results. In addition, if revenue growth levels do not meet our expectations, our financial results will be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely heavily on revenues derived from Internet advertising, which are subject to uncertain demand from our current and potential clients and are difficult to forecast accurately.\n\nCurrently, the majority of our revenues come from advertisements displayed on our online properties. Our ability to continue to achieve substantial advertising revenue depends upon:\n\ngrowth of our user base; our user base being attractive to advertisers; our ability to derive better demographic and other information from our users; acceptance by advertisers of the Web as an advertising medium; and our ability to transition and expand into other forms of advertising.\n\nIn addition, we are experiencing a shift in the source of advertising revenues from Internet companies to companies in more traditional lines of business. These advertisers often have substantially different requirements and expectations than Internet companies with respect to advertising programs. If we are unsuccessful in adapting to the needs of our changing mix of advertisers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, Internet companies are ceasing to spend money on advertising at a faster pace than we anticipated and companies in more traditional lines of business are not spending money on advertising as quickly as we anticipated. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of advertisements under short-term contracts, which are difficult to forecast accurately.\n\nMost of our revenues are currently derived from agreements with advertisers or sponsorship arrangements. These agreements generally have terms no longer than three (3) years and, in many cases, the terms are much shorter. In cases where the advertiser is providing services, the agreements often have payments contingent on usage levels. Many of our advertisers are Internet companies which, in certain cases, may lack financial resources to fulfill their commitments. Accordingly, it is difficult to accurately forecast these revenues. However, our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and are fixed over the short term with respect to certain categories. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, the cancellation or deferral of advertising or sponsorship contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Because our operating expenses are likely to increase significantly over the near term, to the extent that our expenses increase but our revenues do not, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe rate structure of some of our sponsorship arrangements subjects us to financial risk.\n\nA key element of our strategy is to generate advertising revenues through sponsored services and placements by third parties in our online media properties in addition to banner advertising. We typically receive sponsorship fees or a portion of transaction revenues in return for minimum levels of user impressions to be provided by us. These arrangements expose us to potentially significant financial risks in the event our usage levels decrease, including the following:\n\nthe fees we are entitled to receive may be adjusted downwards; we may be required to \"make good\" on our obligations by providing alternative services; the sponsors may not renew the agreements or may renew at lower rates; and the arrangements may not generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues, or sponsors may default on the payment commitments in such agreements as has occurred in the past.\n\nAccordingly, any leveling off or decrease of our user base or the failure to generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues could result in a significant decrease in our revenue levels.\n\n11\n\nWe have spent considerable amounts of money and resources to provide a variety of communications services, but such services may not prove to be successful in generating significant revenue for us.\n\nCurrently, a substantial portion of the traffic on our online properties is directed at our communications services, such as email, instant messaging, calendaring and chat rooms, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. We provide these and other basic communications services free of charge to our users, as is the case with most of our competitors, and have not yet determined an effective means of generating revenues directly from the provision of such services. Alternative revenue models for our communications and electronic commerce services, such as subscription fees and commissions, are relatively unproven and may not generate sufficient revenues to be meaningful to us. Currently, we are dependent upon the use of other Yahoo! services to generate revenues from our communication services, and there is a risk that this relationship will not be sustained. As communications services become an increasingly important part of our total offering, we must continue to provide new communications applications which are compelling to users and utilize more sophisticated communications technologies to provide such applications to many types of access devices in addition to the personal computer, while continuing to develop an effective method for generating revenues for such services. In addition, the development of these technologies require long development cycles and a more significant investment by us. If we were unable to develop such applications or use such technologies, the size and rate of growth in our user base would be adversely affected. If we cannot develop a direct or indirect means by which we generate revenues from our communications services that are more than sufficient to offset the costs of providing such services, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may not be successful in expanding the number of users of our electronic commerce services and our ability to effectively provide these services is limited because we do not have a direct billing relationship with our users.\n\nWe have focused, and intend to continue to focus, significant resources on the development and enhancement of our electronic commerce properties. These properties, such as Yahoo! Shopping, link users with a network of retailers with which we have relationships. However, we merely provide a means through which our users can access the sellers of the products such users may wish to purchase and do not establish a direct billing relationship with our users as a result of any such purchase. In addition, a large number of our users currently utilize our online shopping services simply to gather information for future offline purchases. We will need to effectively induce information gatherers to make purchases in order for our electronic commerce properties to be successful. Finally, the success of our electronic commerce properties will also depend on, among other things, our ability to attract and retain well-known brands among our network of retailers. The revenue that we derive from our electronic commerce services is typically in the form of a bounty or a commission paid by the retailer from whom our user purchased a product. If the user had a favorable buying experience with a particular retailer, the user may subsequently contact that retailer directly rather than through our service. If our users bypass our electronic commerce properties, such as Yahoo! Shopping, and contact retailers directly, we will not receive any revenue for purchases made through such direct contact. Competing providers of online shopping, including merchants with which we have relationships, may be able to provide a more convenient and comprehensive online shopping experience due to their singular focus on electronic commerce. As a result, we may have difficulty competing with those merchants for users of electronic commerce services. The inability of our electronic commerce properties to generate significant revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur business and enterprise services, while costly to develop, may fail to gain market acceptance.\n\nWe have invested a significant amount of money and resources in the creation of our business and enterprise services, such as Yahoo! Webcast Studio, which allows business customers to create and stream their own corporate events, Corporate Yahoo!, a customized enterprise portal solution; and Yahoo! Website Services, a turnkey service enabling companies to manage their Web presence. Many of these services are unproven and may fail to gain market acceptance. Because the market for these business and enterprise services is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict the size of this market and its rate of growth, if any. In addition, it is uncertain whether businesses and other organizations will utilize the Internet to any significant degree as a means of broadcasting business conferences and other events. Potential business services customers must accept audio and video broadcast\n\n12\n\nservices over the Internet as a viable alternative to face-to-face meetings, television or audio, audio teleconferences and video conferencing. We cannot assure you that the market for business and enterprise services will continue to develop or be sustainable. If the market fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes more competitive than is currently expected, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nWe will continue to expand into international markets in which we have limited experience, are faced with relatively higher costs and are exposed to greater risks.\n\nA key part of our strategy is to develop Yahoo!-branded online properties in international markets and we have developed, through joint ventures, subsidiaries and branch offices, Yahoo! properties localized for over 20 other countries. To date, we have only limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and operating our products and services internationally and we rely on the efforts and abilities of our foreign business partners in such activities.\n\nWe believe that in light of substantial anticipated competition, we need to move quickly into international markets in order to effectively obtain market share. However, in a number of international markets, especially those in Europe, we face substantial competition from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that offer or may offer their own navigational services. Many of these ISPs have a dominant market share in their territories. Further, foreign providers of competing online services may have a substantial advantage over us in attracting users in their country due to more established branding in that country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of users residing in that country and/or their focus on a single market. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with the development and maintenance of international online properties. International markets we have selected may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. In particular, international markets typically are slower than domestic markets in adopting the Internet as an advertising and commerce medium.\n\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand our international presence, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level, including:\n\ntrade barriers and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; difficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of unique foreign operations as a result of distance, language and cultural differences; higher costs of doing business in foreign countries; longer payment cycles; currency exchange rate fluctuations; political instability and export restrictions; seasonal reductions in business activity; risks related to government regulation including those more fully described below; and potentially adverse tax consequences.\n\nOne or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and, consequently, on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nWe depend on key personnel who may not continue to work for us.\n\nWe are substantially dependent on the continued services of our key personnel, including our two founders, our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, chief technical officer and vice presidents. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Yahoo! and its operations or, in the case of our chief financial officer, only recently joined us. If any of these individuals were to leave Yahoo! unexpectedly, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience. We announced in March 2001 that our Board of Directors has initiated a search for a new chief executive officer. Upon completion of this search, our current chairman and chief executive officer, Tim Koogle, will resign as chief executive officer and continue as our chairman. In addition, we have recently experienced announcements of departures by certain management personnel of our international properties and may experience similar departures from our domestic or international business units in the future. Many of our management personnel have reached or will soon reach the four-year anniversary of their Yahoo! hiring date and, as a result, will have become or will shortly become fully vested in\n\n13\n\ntheir initial stock option grants. While management personnel are typically granted additional stock options, which will usually vest over a period of four years, subsequent to their hire date to provide additional incentive to remain at Yahoo!, the initial option grant is typically the largest and an employee may be more likely to leave our employ upon completion of the vesting period for the initial option grant.\n\nWe expect that we will need to hire additional personnel in all areas. The competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located. At times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the right training or experience, particularly in technical areas. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe may have difficulty scaling and adapting our existing architecture to accommodate increased traffic and technology advances.\n\nYahoo! is one of the most highly trafficked Web sites on the Internet and is regularly exceeding previous standards for numbers of simultaneous users, unique users and daily page views delivered. In addition, the services offered by Yahoo! and popular with users have changed significantly in the past and are expected to change rapidly in the future. Much of the architecture that we employ was not originally designed to accommodate levels or types of use that we currently experience on our online properties and it is unclear whether current or future anticipated levels of traffic will result in delays or interruptions in our service. In particular, the architecture utilized for our email and certain other communication services was not primarily designed for this purpose, is highly complex and may not provide satisfactory service in the future, especially as it becomes an increasingly important service offering. In the future, we may be required to make significant changes to our architecture, including moving to a completely new architecture. If we are required to switch architectures, we may incur substantial costs and experience delays or interruptions in our service. If we experience delays or interruptions in our service due to inadequacies in our current architecture or as a result of a change in architectures, users may become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of online services. Further, to the extent that demand for our broadcast services content increases, we will need to expand our infrastructure, including the capacity of our hardware servers and the sophistication of our software. This expansion is likely to be expensive, complex, and require additional technical expertise. Also, as we acquire users who rely upon us for a wide variety of services, it becomes more technologically complex and costly to retrieve, store and integrate data that will enable us to track each user's preferences. Any loss of traffic, increased costs, inefficiencies or failures to adapt to new technologies and the associated adjustments to our architecture would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur competitors often provide Internet access or computer hardware to our customers and they could make it difficult for our customers to access our services.\n\nOur users must access our services through an Internet service provider, or ISP, with which the user establishes a direct billing relationship using a personal computer or other access device. To the extent that an access provider, such as AOL Time Warner or MSN, or a computer or computing device manufacturer offers online services or properties that are competitive with those of Yahoo!, the user may find it more convenient to use the services or properties of that access provider or manufacturer. In addition, the access provider or manufacturer may make it difficult to access our services by not listing them in the access provider's or manufacturer's own directory. Also, because an access provider gathers information from the user in connection with the establishment of the billing relationship, an access provider may be more effective than Yahoo! in tailoring services and advertisements to the specific tastes of the user. To the extent that a user opts to use the services offered by his or her access provider or those offered by computer or computing device manufacturers rather than the services provided by Yahoo!, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\n\nMore individuals are utilizing non-PC devices to access the Internet and we may not be successful in developing a version of our service that will gain widespread adoption by users of such devices.\n\nIn the coming years, the number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones and television set-top devices is expected to increase dramatically. Our services are designed for rich, graphical environments such as those available on personal\n\n14\n\nand laptop computers. The lower resolution, functionality and memory associated with alternative devices may make the use of our services through such devices difficult and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to modify our online properties to provide a compelling service for users of alternative devices. As we have limited experience to date in operating versions of our service developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in doing so and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such versions. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device users to our online services, we will fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services. Further, as the majority of our revenues are derived through the sale of banner and other advertising optimized for a personal computer screen, we may not be successful at developing a viable strategy for deriving substantial revenues from online properties that are directed at the users of alternative devices. Any failure to develop revenue-generating online properties that are adopted by a significant number of handheld device users could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe rely on the value of the Yahoo! brand and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.\n\nWe believe that maintaining and expanding the Yahoo! brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our user and advertiser base. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of Internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry. We have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of the Yahoo! brand. However, because the number of Internet navigation, commerce, community and service companies continues to grow dramatically, it has become increasingly difficult and, due to increased competition, expensive, to obtain quality television, radio, magazine, Internet and other advertising space. Further, the proliferation of Internet-based companies has resulted and will continue to result in increased consumer confusion. Consequently, we will spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the Yahoo! brand during 2001. We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Yahoo! brand in a cost-effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the supply of critical elements from other companies.\n\nWe will depend upon third parties, to a substantial extent, for several critical elements of our business including various technology, infrastructure, content development, software and distribution components.\n\nTechnology and Infrastructure. We rely on a private third-party provider, Frontier GlobalCenter, Inc., for our principal Internet connections. Email and other service Internet connections are provided to us by GTE. We rely on Network Appliances for key components of our email service. We also rely on Exodus Communications for the hosting of our users' homepages and Level 3 Communications for hosting and access to our broadcast services. Any disruption in the Internet access provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We license technology and related databases from third parties for certain elements of our properties, including, among others, technology underlying the delivery of news, stock quotes and current financial information, chat services, street mapping and telephone listings, streaming capabilities and similar services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Furthermore, we are dependent on hardware suppliers for prompt delivery, installation, and service of servers and other equipment to deliver our products and services. Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services could negatively impact our relationship with users and adversely affect our brand and our business, and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.\n\nDistribution Relationships. To increase traffic for our online properties and make them more available and attractive to advertisers and consumers, we have certain distribution agreements and informal relationships with leading Web browser providers such as Microsoft, operators of online\n\n15\n\nnetworks and leading Web sites, software developers and computer manufacturers, such as Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway, and telecommunications companies, such as Sprint PCS. These distribution arrangements typically are not exclusive and do not extend over a significant amount of time. Further, some of our distributors are competitors or potential competitors who may not renew their distribution contracts with us. Potential distributors may not offer distribution of our properties and services on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, as new methods for accessing the Web become available, we may be required to enter into additional distribution relationships. Any failure to obtain distribution or to obtain distribution on terms that are reasonable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nStreaming Media Software. We rely on the two leading providers of streaming media products, RealNetworks and Microsoft, to license the software necessary to broadcast streaming audio and video content to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license these products to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Our users are currently able to electronically download copies of the software to play streaming media free of charge, but providers of streaming media products may begin charging users for copies of their player software or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of these products. In order for our broadcast services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of these streaming media products. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of streaming media software, and to the extent that any of these circumstances occur, the broadcast services portion of our business will be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur dependence on third party content providers subjects us to risks.\n\nOur future success depends upon our ability to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through our online properties. Much of the content that attracts users to the Yahoo! online properties, such as news items, stock quotes, weather reports, maps and audio and video content, is licensed from third parties such as Reuters and TIBCO. In particular, Yahoo! Broadcast relies on major sports organizations, radio and television stations, record labels, cable networks, businesses, colleges and universities, film producers and distributors, and other organizations for a large portion of the content available on the site. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with third-party content providers will be critical to our success. We may be unable to enter into or preserve relationships with the third parties whose content we seek to obtain. Many of our current licenses for third-party content extend for a period of less than two years and there can be no guarantee that they will be renewed upon their expiration. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases both locally and abroad, Yahoo!'s content providers may increase the prices at which they offer their content to Yahoo! and potential content providers may not offer their content on terms agreeable to Yahoo!. An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party content providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our content licenses with third parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other Webcasters may be able to offer similar or identical content. Likewise, most sports and entertainment content available on our online properties are also available on other media like radio or television. These media are currently, and for the foreseeable future will be, much more widely adopted for listening or viewing such content than the Web. These factors also increase the importance of our ability to deliver compelling editorial content and personalization of this content for users in order to differentiate ourselves. If we are unable to license or acquire compelling content, if other companies broadcast content that is similar to or the same as that provided by Yahoo!, or if we do not develop compelling editorial content or personalization services, the number of users on our online properties may not grow at all or at a slower rate than anticipated, which would decrease our advertising revenue.\n\nAs we provide more audio and video content, particularly music, we may be required to spend significant amounts of money on content acquisition and content broadcasts.\n\nUntil recently, the majority of the content that we provided to our users was in print, picture or graphical format and was either created internally or licensed to us by third parties for little or no charge. However, we have been providing recently and we intend to continue to provide increasing amounts of audio and video content to our users, such as the broadcast of music, film content, speeches, news footage, concerts and other special events, through our broadcast services division and our other media properties, and such content may require us to make substantial payments to third parties from whom we\n\n16\n\nwill license or acquire such content. For example, in order to broadcast music through our online properties, we are currently required to pay royalties both on the copyright in the musical compositions and the copyright in the actual sound recordings of the music to be broadcast. Through our broadcast services division, we currently have obtained rights from ASCAP, BMI and SESAC that permit us to engage in the public performance of musical compositions for which they control the rights. With respect to the copyrights in the specific sound recordings that we desire to broadcast, we have entered into an agreement with the recording industry that permits us to engage in the public performance of all copyrighted sound recordings. All of the above rights have been obtained pursuant to short-term agreements or are under negotiation. If the royalty rates under negotiation are above our expectations, if the royalty rates charged by the various performance rights societies increase or if any of these or other parties with music licensing rights impose terms that make it difficult or impossible to broadcast music, we may be unable to provide music content to our users in a cost-effective manner. We believe that users of Internet services such as the Yahoo! online properties will increasingly demand high-quality audio and video content. The revenue that we receive as a result of our audio and video broadcasts may not justify the costs of providing such broadcasts. Our inability to cost-effectively provide high-quality audio and/or video content to our users could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nTo successfully improve our rich media offerings, we must rely on the deployment of a true multicasting network.\n\nThe streaming services that we acquired upon our acquisition of broadcast.com originally deployed unicasting (one user per company originated stream) technology to broadcast audio and video programming to users over the Internet. Recently, it began to deploy another broadcast technology, multicasting (multiple users per company originated stream). We believe that demand for multicasting will continue to expand and, as a result, we must continue to enhance this capability in the future.\n\nWe will be required to test, deploy and successfully scale a multicast network infrastructure to serve mass audiences. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, that multicasting will be able to support a substantial audience or that an alternative technology will not emerge that offers superior broadcasting technology as compared to multicasting. In the event that multicasting technology is not successfully deployed in a timely manner or such an alternative technology emerges, we may be required to expend significant resources to deploy a technology other than multicasting, which could adversely affect our results of operations. If Yahoo! Broadcast Services fails to scale its broadcasts to large audiences of simultaneous users, such failure could adversely affect that portion of our business.\n\nWe must manage our growth successfully, including the integration of recently-acquired companies, in order to achieve our desired results.\n\nWe have experienced dramatic growth in personnel in recent years and expect to continue to hire additional personnel. As the number of Yahoo! employees grows, it will become increasingly difficult and more costly to manage our personnel. Further, as a result of recent acquisitions and international expansion, almost one-half of our employees are based outside of our Santa Clara headquarters. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we have completed several acquisitions and expect to enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions. Acquisition transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\nthe difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology or content and rights into our products and media properties and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; the negative impact on reported earnings if any of our planned transactions that are expected to qualify for pooling of interest accounting treatment for financial reporting purposes fail to so qualify; the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in-process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset; the failure to successfully develop an acquired in-process technology resulting in the impairment\n\n17\n\nof amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;\n\nthe impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; and the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\n\nWe may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet, the impact of which is difficult to predict.\n\nThere are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to the Internet. The application of existing laws and regulations to Yahoo! relating to issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and dampen the growth in use of the Web.\n\nSeveral recently passed federal laws could have an impact on our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party Web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. The Children's Online Protection Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. Such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities.\n\nWe post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. In addition, GeoCities, a company we acquired in 1999, is required to comply with a consent order between it and the Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\"), which imposes certain obligations and restrictions with respect to information collected from users. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy, the consent order, FTC requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by the FTC or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could materially and adversely affect our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenues. This could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services.\n\nDue to the global nature of the Web, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe may be subject to legal liability for our online services.\n\nWe host a wide variety of services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, conduct business and engage in various online activities on an international basis, including public message posting and services relating to online auctions and homesteading. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we provide links to or that may be posted online or generated by our users or with respect to auctioned materials. For example, Yahoo! was recently the subject of a claim brought by certain entities in a French court regarding, among other things, the availability of certain content within our services which was alleged to violate French law. Due to the unsettled nature of the law in this area, we may be subject to similar actions in\n\n18\n\ndomestic or other international jurisdictions in the future. Our defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant distraction of our management and other resources. In addition, we are aware that governmental agencies are currently investigating the conduct of online auctions.\n\nWe also periodically enter into arrangements to offer third-party products, services, or content under the Yahoo! brand or via distribution on various Yahoo! properties, including stock quotes and trading information. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services or content. While our agreements with these parties often provide that we will be indemnified against such liabilities, such indemnification may not be adequate.\n\nIt is also possible that, if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users, third parties could make claims against us. For example, we offer Web-based email services, which expose us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email, lost or misdirected messages, illegal or fraudulent use of email, or interruptions or delays in email service. Investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive, even to the extent that the claims do not ultimately result in liability.\n\nOur stock price has been volatile historically, which may make it more difficult for you to resell shares when you want at prices you find attractive.\n\nThe trading price of our Common Stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During 2000, the closing sale prices of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from $237.50 to $25.625 per share and the sale price of our Common Stock closed at $15.00 per share on March 15, 2001. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable, and news reports relating to trends in our markets. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options.\n\nManagement and one large stockholder beneficially own approximately 38% of our stock; their interests could conflict with yours; significant sales of stock held by them could have a negative effect on Yahoo!'s stock price.\n\nYahoo!'s directors and executive officers and SOFTBANK beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2000. Eric Hippeau is a member of our Board of Directors and is also the President and Executive Managing Director of SOFTBANK International Ventures, an affiliate of SOFTBANK. As a result of their ownership and positions, our directors and executive officers and SOFTBANK collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Yahoo!. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by Yahoo!'s directors and executive officers and SOFTBANK, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of Yahoo! Common Stock.\n\nOur operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\n\nOur operations are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. In addition, the majority of our network infrastructure is located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. In recent months, the western United States (and California in particular) has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply. As a result of these episodes, certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to \"rolling blackouts\" or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power. The prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence, duration or cessation. We do not have multiple site capacity for all of our\n\n19\n\nservices in the event of any such occurrence. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. In addition, we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data, resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time. We have experienced a coordinated denial of service attack in the past, and may experience such attempts in the future. We do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\n\nWe recently announced our adoption of a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2001. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $250 per unit. Under certain circumstances, if a person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, holders of the rights (other than the person or group triggering their exercise) will be able to purchase, in exchange for the $250 exercise price, shares of our Common Stock or of any company into which we are merged having a value of $500. The rights expire on March 1, 2011 unless extended by our Board of Directors. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors, our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors regarding such acquisition.\n\nIn addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock (of which 2,000,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of Yahoo! without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Yahoo!, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors.\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nYahoo!'s headquarters facility is located in six offices in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, California. The Company occupies these leased facilities, which aggregate approximately 353,000 square feet. Office space for the Company's international subsidiaries is leased in Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Milan, Munich, Paris, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Taipei, Toronto, and Zurich. The Company also leases sales offices in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The Company's principal Web server equipment and operations are maintained by GlobalCenter in Mountain View, California, by Exodus Communications in Santa Clara, California, and by GTE BBN in San Jose, California.\n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the development of an office complex in Sunnyvale, California, to be constructed between 2000 and 2003, and to serve as the Company's new headquarters. Construction began in 2000 and buildings in the first two phases of the project are expected to be ready for occupancy in the second quarter of 2001. The Company believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any further physical expansion of corporate operations and for any additional sales offices.\n\n20\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and a variety of claims arising in connection with the Company's email, message boards, auction sites, shopping services, and other communications and community features, such as claims alleging defamation or invasion of privacy. In addition, from time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against the Company in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communication. Currently, the Company is engaged in two lawsuits regarding patent issues and has been notified of a number of other potential patent disputes.\n\nIn addition to intellectual property claims, on or about March 1, 2000, the Company was advised that the FTC was conducting an inquiry into certain of the Company's consumer information practices to determine whether the Company was complying with applicable FTC consumer protection regulations. The FTC has subsequently notified the Company that, pursuant to its inquiry, no compliance action by the FTC is warranted with respect to the Company or its practices.\n\nThe Company is not currently aware of any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims. In the event of a determination adverse to the Company, the Company may incur substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nItem 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders\n\nNo matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.\n\n21\n\nPart II\n\nItem 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\n\nYahoo! Inc. Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol YHOO. The following table sets forth the range of high and low closing per share sales prices for each period indicated and reflects all stock splits affected by the Company:\n\n2000 1999 High\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nFirst quarter $ 237.50 $ 153.81 $ 103.85 $ 62.00 Second quarter 167.38 112.06 109.57 59.63 Third quarter 139.81 90.38 92.35 60.50 Fourth quarter 87.94 25.63 216.35 83.78\n\nThe Company had approximately 8,290 stockholders of record as of December 31, 2000. The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock and presently intends to retain its future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of its business and, therefore, does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nYahoo! Inc. did not make any unregistered sales of the Company's Common Stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.\n\n22\n\nItem 6.
