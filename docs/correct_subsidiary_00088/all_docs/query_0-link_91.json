        "text": "Born in Baltimore and grew up in classic Boomer middle-class suburb (see film Dazed & Confused). Attended University of Maryland, received a BS in Civil/Structural Engineering and nearly an MS, when I was accepted into Cornell's Program of Computer Graphics.\n\nWorked hard for 3 glorious yrs in Ithaca--learning computer science, computer graphics, and completing my Master's thesis: \"Ray Tracing Textures\".\n\nTook my first job w/ Vertigo Computer Animation in Vancouver, Canada. Fell in love with Vancouver and worked too hard for 6 yrs, creating the Vertigo 3D Animation System.\n\nWorked at SGI for 9 years on a variety of fun, sometimes controversial projects: GLdebug, Inventor, VRML, 3D Annotator, 3D Whiteboard, Ricochet Ray Tracer, Cosmo line, etc. Somehow got convinced by Kai Fu Lee to come back to SGI and go down with the Cosmo Ship (sold).\n\nI jumped on the Internet bandwagon in 1998, whiffed at a couple startups, and joined eGroups as CTO. Yahoo! acquired us and I worked at Y! as GM of Music for a short stint.\n\nI worked at Napster for a long summer as a favor to a friend.\n\nCo-founded Plaxo and enjoyed a wild ride for six years. Plaxo was sold to Comcast.\n\nReturned to my roots in computer graphics and started a small online game studio, CloudPlay. Created a turn-based strategy game (early MOBA), ThreshWars.com, built Cafe for Tagged.com, and created an fb game.\n\nWhile developing ideas for our next game, I met the folks at Tophatter and joined. I designed and helped successfully launch their first iPhone app.\n\nI decided that I wanted to refresh my coding skills and built a game 100% solo (coding, art, design, etc.), XO Football.\n\nIn 2016, I co-founded a startup, Ethereal, that created a VR app and platform for social VR. Unfortunately, our market timing was terrible (too early) and we had to move on.\n\nI am quietly looking for a new adventure, preferably in VR, 3d, games or mobile."
