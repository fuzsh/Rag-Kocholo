It’s still a bit fussy figuring out all of the pieces.\n\nIf you need more help that you can get here, I can provide it, as it’s how I make my living. https://www.literatecomputing.com/. You can contact me directly or post in marketplace. I’m trying to be on vacation now, so I’m not as responsive as I usually am.\n\nExcellent, thanks! I would much rather hire you than figure it out for myself\n\nThe link you provided is for WooCommerce Memberships, but we use Subscriptions. Hopefully it’s still possible.\n\nI’ll be in touch if/when we want to proceed. Enjoy your vacation!"
