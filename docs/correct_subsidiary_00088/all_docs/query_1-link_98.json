I am soon going to set up another one for parents with disabled children in my LA BUT now I'm wondering if Facebook is better? I've always avoided Facebook like the plague but people often mention it as somewhere to have groups and small on-line communities\n\nSo which should I choose and which would work better? Obviously if Facebook is the \"winner\" then I'd have to learn how to use it so that is a slight disadvantage. Any advice or opinions greatly appreciated."
