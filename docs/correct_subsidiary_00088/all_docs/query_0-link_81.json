        "text": "UPDATE: Yep, it's official.\n\nGuess there will be big news at Yahoo's Monday product event in New York: The Wall Street Journal reports, \"The Yahoo board has approved a deal to pay $1.1 billion in cash for the blogging site Tumblr... By acquiring Tumblr, Yahoo would instantly gain a social-media website that has become a hub of communication and blogging for millions of people. Yahoo could help Tumblr generate more revenue from advertisements.\"\n\nAllThingsD adds, \"Sources close to the board said the deal was a foregone conclusion and was an unanimous vote by the Silicon Valley Internet giant... There were no other competing bids, despite reports, to snap up the New York-based hipster blogging service.\" Yes, because besides starting Tumblrs like \"Halloween or Williamsburg,\" hipsters love to blog porn.\n\nForbes notes the eerie similarities of the deal to a 1999 Yahoo deal:\n\nImagine a company backed by Fred Wilson, one of the top venture capitalists on the Internet. The company is largely reliant on user-generated content and has had difficulties generating revenue in line with its stratospheric valuation. All of a sudden, Yahoo appears and offers a billion-dollar-plus valuation to acquire the company.\n\nThis scenario may be the one many people are considering as rumors swirl that Yahoo is about to acquire New York-based Tumblr for over a billion dollars. But if you were to rewind to an earlier time, let’s say 1999, you’d find that the scenario is exactly the same as it was for Geocities, a company Yahoo acquired for $3.57 billion in stock...\n\nBack in 1999, Geocities had trouble monetizing its audience, slapping low-priced ads all over the site in a desperate attempt to monetize as much of its traffic as it could. Today, Tumblr is just starting to monetize its traffic, with mainstream advertisers still worried about the user-generated content next to which they might appear. To its credit, though, Tumblr has taken a slow and concerted approach to introducing advertising on its properties, carefully tuning their effort to improve response rates.\n\nAnother difference is that this Yahoo-Tumblr deal is reportedly all cash (the Facebook-Instagram deal was $1 billion, but $300 million cash and the rest in Facebook stock)."
