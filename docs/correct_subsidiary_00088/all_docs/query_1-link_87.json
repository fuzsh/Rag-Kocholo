Groups retrieved by Archive Team’s Python script as well as from other grabs has been organized and is now available on the Internet Archive. Special thanks to Doranwen for organizing this data.\n\nYahoo! Groups’ mailing lists, which are the last remaining part of Yahoo! Groups, will be shutting down in 10 days, on December 15, 2020. However, since group content is no longer accessible to the public, there is little left to archive.\n\nNext year, volunteers will be needed to sort and organize the full group data so related groups can be uploaded to the Internet Archive together. This will make it easier to access and browse archives for multiple groups related to similar topics."
