        "text": "I am forwarding this message to groups of which I am a moderator. It\n\nwas posted by the moderator of another e-mail group but it give a some\n\ngeneral information about the changeover. If you try to go to the\n\negroups web site, you will find it has switched to Yahoo. In order to\n\naccess anything on the website pertaining to our group, you must first\n\nconvert from the old egroups registration and register with Yahoo. They\n\nhave made it relatively painless, yet it requires you to choose a user\n\nname and password on Yahoo. It took me about 10 attempts before I\n\nfinally found a username not already in use. Once I successfully\n\nregistered with Yahoo, it automatically converted me and connected my\n\nnew Yahoo registration with all the groups I belong to.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, the changeover will have no affect on\n\nsending and receiving regular email messages to/from the group, but if\n\nyou are set up as \"web only\" or if you want to view the archives, etc.,\n\nyou will have to register with Yahoo before you can view and post\n\nmessages.\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\n-------- Original Message --------\n\nSubject: Egroups Has Now Finally Become Yahoo\n\nDate: Fri, 26 Jan 2001 14:21:40 -0500\n\nFrom: Harry Dewey <harryd@...>\n\nReply-To: \"Alpine-L, the Electronic Rock Garden Society;\n\npostings copyright by authors.\" <ALPINE-L@...>\n\nOrganization: Alpine-L, the Electronic Rock Garden Society\n\nTo: ALPINE-L@...\n\nEveryone who has tried today (January 26) to reach an egroups web\n\nsite has no doubt been surprised to see that the familiar Egroups\n\nlogos have been replaced by Yahoo logos and software.\n\nI have been as surprised by this development as anyone else, and am\n\nsorry I was not in a position to mitigate your surprise before now.\n\nIt is not the end of the world, although the software was, in my\n\nopinion, poorly designed in that, although there is a shortcut\n\nwhereby \"former Egroups members\" can bypass the worst of the Yahoo\n\nregistration procedures, the Yahoo \"welcome\" page does not make\n\ninstantly clear how you can simplify the transition from Egroups to\n\nYahoo. No warning that this was anything but weeks or months away\n\nreached me until I tried to reach our AlpenPix message archive\n\ntoday.\n\nAlthough Egroups doesn't make it very clear, the shortcut for\n\nEgroups subscribers is a blue-and-red-outlined box near the upper\n\nleft corner of the Yahoo screen. In the bluc-and-red-outlined box,\n\nin black letters, are the words: \"Welcome EGroups Members! Learn\n\nMore!\" If you click on that,\n\nyou will be able to make the transition much more simply than if you\n\nfollow the instructions for signing up that occupy the right-hand\n\nside of that screen. Maybe the Yahoo people thought this shortcut\n\nwould be obvious to all, but it was not so in my case, and I did it\n\nthe hard way.\n\nYahoo has declared today that it is entirely possible to continue\n\nreceiving email from existing Egroups/Yahoo emailinglists without\n\nhaving to acquire a Yahoo ID and password. The \"shortcut\" referred\n\nto in my third paragraph above is apparently designed to achieve\n\nthis result.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about procedure, please don't hesitate\n\nto write to Alpine-L-Request@...\n\nI believe it is still possible for me to sign you up to any Egroups\n\n(now Yahoo) subsidiary list for the purpose of accessing our FAQs,\n\nour AlpenPix picture archives, etc., without your giving your age,\n\netc. Let me know if you have problems, please."
