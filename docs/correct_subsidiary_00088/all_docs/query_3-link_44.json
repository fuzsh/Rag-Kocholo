        "text": "Starting October 15, no new Yahoo Groups can be created, and starting December 15, you will no longer be able to send or receive emails from Groups. The site will be entirely shut down.\n\nAny emails from Yahoo Groups you have sent or received will remain in your email account.\n\nSee the Yahoo Groups shutdown FAQ for more details, including a feedback email address.\n\nWhy the shutdown? Verizon says:\n\nYahoo Groups has seen a steady decline in usage over the last several years. Over that same period, weâ€™ve witnessed unprecedented levels of engagement across our properties as customers seek out premium, trustworthy content. While these decisions are never easy, we must sometimes make difficult decisions regarding products that no longer fit our long-term strategy as we hone our focus on other areas of the business.\n\nNo surprise there.\n\nIn 2001 Yahoo! (don't forget the !) acquired eGroups.com and integrated that with its own Yahoo! Clubs to launch Yahoo! Groups. It was huge in its time, with boards covering almost any topic (including the illegal and unseemly). But it was also long neglected, and with Verizon Communication's acquisition of Yahoo in 2017, it didn't seem to have a clear place Verizon's corporate strategy.\n\nOther parts of Yahoo were sold off, with Flickr acquired by SmugMug in 2018, and Tumblr acquired by Automattic (WordPress's parent company) in 2019. But I imagine that what amounts to a huge database of old mailing lists wouldn't be an attractive purchase, with low usership not able to offset the privacy and content issues.\n\nYahoo Group owners can download a list of group members\n\n1. Sign in to Yahoo and access your Group's page\n\n2. Click Management | Manage Members\n\n3. Click Actions\n\n4. Click Export"
