        "text": "Accessing the Yahoo Groups Website for Your Group(s)\n\nNOTE: This process was last updated on January 9, 2005. It is possible Yahoo has made changes since then. If you find that to be the case, I'd appreciate a note.\n\n1. As a Yahoo E-mail Group member you can send, receive and reply to Group e- mail without needing to access the Yahoo Groups web site.\n\nTo change your subscribed e-mail address, to read the Group e-mail archive or to use other features of the Yahoo Groups service, you will need to use their web site.\n\nThe following will help you set up the Yahoo prerequisites to access the site. It is arranged as a decision tree. When you are told GO TO #, go right to that step - don't bother reading the skipped information, as you will probably just find it confusing.\n\n2. Do you have any interest in accessing the Yahoo Groups web site (for any of the reasons stated above)?\n\n2.1. If NO, you need read no further.\n\n2.2. If YES, proceed.\n\n3. Here (between the *** ) is a nutshell summary of what you need to do to access a Yahoo Groups web site for any particular group. This may be all you need to know. If not, a step-by-step procedure follows. *** To access the Yahoo web site for a particular Group, you must have a Yahoo ID, and the address that is subscribed to the Group must be listed as an alternate address with your Yahoo ID. *** Want a little more help? Read on. HELPFUL SUGGESTION - PRINT THIS PAGE NOW.\n\n4. Do you already have a Yahoo ID?\n\n4.1. If YES, GO TO 6.\n\n4.2. If NO, GO TO 5.\n\n5. Your first step will be to establish a Yahoo ID.\n\n5.1. Log onto the Yahoo Groups web page at http://groups.yahoo.com\n\n5.1.1. If Yahoo recognizes you as already a member, they display the groups to which you already belong. In that case, GO TO 6.\n\n5.1.2. If Yahoo does not recognize you as already a member you will see an invitation to sign up.\n\n5.2. Click on the \"Sign up now\" link.\n\n5.3. You will now be at a screen saying \"Create your Yahoo! ID\". Fill in the blanks with the information requested. You choose your own Yahoo ID and password here. Some other information is required, and some is optional. Decide for yourself what you want to provide when the choice is optional. IMPORTANT - here is where you enter the e-mail address which is subscribed to the E-mail Group. It goes in the entry named \"Alternate Email\". Be sure it is a valid address at which you can currently receive mail, as Yahoo will send you a message here to activate your account. When you have filled in the blanks, click the button to submit the form.\n\n5.4. If all the blanks are filled in properly, the next screen will say \"Registration: Please activate your account\", and that a confirmation message will be sent. Write down your Yahoo ID, password and Alternate E-mail address. DO THIS NOW! Suggestion - print and save this page.\n\n5.5. Click the button \"Continue to Yahoo Group\". You now need to wait a while (probably less than an hour) to receive the email confirmation message noted in 5.4. It will contain a link that you click to continue the setup process. Click the link and GO TO 8.\n\n6. You have a Yahoo ID, so now you will use the Yahoo Membership Wizard to locate your groups. Go to http://groups.yahoo.com/mygroups. You should see a \"Welcome\" with your Yahoo ID. Click the \"Membership Wizard\" link near the bottom of the page.\n\n7. You'll see some explanatory information. Click the button to Continue.\n\n8. You'll see a list of the e-mail addresses that Yahoo knows are associated with this Yahoo ID, and some instructions specific to your situation. Follow them."
