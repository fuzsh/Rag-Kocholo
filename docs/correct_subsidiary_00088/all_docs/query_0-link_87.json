        "text": "Core War\n\nProgramming Games\n\nCROBOTS\n\nCROBOTS is a programming game inspired by RobotWar and released by Tom Poindexter in 1985. The aim is to write a program to control a battle robot in a subset of C. Up to four robots enter an arena with the last robot standing declared winner.\n\nSpecification\n\nPrograms are written in a subset of C and control a robot using the following functions:\n\nFunctionDescription scan(direction,resolution)Scan in direction (0..359) with resolution (0..10) and return range cannon(direction,range)Fire missile in direction (0..359) with range. Return 1 if successful drive(direction,speed)Set the direction (0..359) and speed (0..100) for the robot to move damage()Return damage sustained (0..100) speed()Return speed (0..100) loc_x()Return x-coordinate (0..999) loc_y()Return y-coordinate (0..999) rand(limit)Return a random number (0..limit) sqrt(n)Return the square root of n sin(n)Return 100000 times the sine of n° (0..359) cos(n)Return 100000 times the cosine of n° (0..359) tan(n)Return 100000 times the tangent of n° (0..359) atan(n)Return the arctangent (-90..90) of n÷100000\n\nRobots battle in a 1000×1000 metre arena. A robot is damaged when it collides with something or a missile explodes within 40 metres. A robot is destroyed when its damage reaches 100%.\n\nThe complete specification is available in the CROBOTS manual.\n\nSoftware\n\nCROBOTS was published as shareware for DOS by Tom Poindexter in December 1985, priced $20. Source code was available to registered users. CROBOTS was ported to the Amiga by David Wright in 1989. In October 2013 CROBOTS was relicensed under GPLv2.\n\nCROBOTS 1.1 (December 1985) - crobots.zip, manual\n\nCrobots Amiga 2.3w (April 1990) - crobots23.zip, manual\n\nController for CROBOTS v1.0 by E.
