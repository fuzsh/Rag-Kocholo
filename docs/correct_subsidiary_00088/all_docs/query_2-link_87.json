        "text": "Celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month\n\nIn the early days of the internet, when the World Wide Web was still a relatively new and uncharted territory, a young entrepreneur named Jerry Yang co-founded a company that would become one of the pioneers of the digital age. Jerry Yang, along with his partner David Filo, created Yahoo, an internet portal that would revolutionize the way we connect, search, and consume information online.\n\nBorn in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1968, Jerry Yang moved to the United States with his family at the age of ten. He had an early fascination with technology and computer science, which led him to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. It was during his time at Stanford that Yang crossed paths with David Filo, and together they embarked on a journey that would shape the future of the internet.\n\nIn 1994, Yang and Filo co-founded Yahoo, originally named “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.” The website started as a directory of web pages, organized into categories and subcategories to help users navigate the growing online landscape. However, as the internet rapidly expanded, so did Yahoo’s ambitions."
