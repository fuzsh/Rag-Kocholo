It was taken in February, 2000, which was after we merged with eGroups and before we were acquired by Yahoo (and became Yahoo Groups). The office was a converted warehouse and had about 50 people in it. This photo doesnâ€™t show all the cubicles behind the photographer, nor does it show the offices underneath.",
