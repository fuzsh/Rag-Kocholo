        "text": "caterina says:\n\nSo you're asking: why are you being acquired? Why Yahoo?\n\nWe thought about lots of ways to keep Flickr going, growing, and\n\ngetting better. We considered taking VC money, more angel\n\ninvestment, bootstrapping it and selling.\n\nWhen Yahoo first approached us eons ago, we were pretty\n\nskeptical. But after meeting the people on the Yahoo team and\n\ngetting a picture of where they were going, we got religion.\n\nMaybe that's too strong. We realized we were all eating at the\n\nsame church potluck.\n\nThe things that were important to us were: being open, building\n\ninnovative stuff and kicking ass. Were these people OUR people?\n\nYes. See the stuff Yahoo's announced recently (including, of\n\ncourse,this)? They're evolving in really interesting ways --\n\nand from our look inside, we know know that there's a lot more\n\ncoming.\n\nYahoo won't be the Yahoo you've come to take for granted.\n\nCompetition (with that other company with two O's in its name)\n\nhas done great things for Yahoo. Dude. The best thing is we no\n\nlonger have to worry about finance, HR, legal, or things at\n\nwhich we are completely incompetent and were taking our time\n\naway from building Flickr. Hot damn.\n\nages ago\n\nstriatic says:\n\ni just want to wish you guys well going forward with this.\n\nflickr has been all about change and flexibilty and trying new and different things .. both for ludicorp and for us flickrnauts .. new challenges are good challenges and i can see a lot of potential in flickr and yahoo combining like this, especially right now as yahoo reinvents itself.\n\ngood timing, and good luck.\n\nages ago\n\nOld Shoe Woman says:\n\nBlessings to Flickr and Yahoo. I use Yahoo because my high school has two groups that are active. Besides my personal friends and colleagues at work, Flickr and Yahoo are my communication with other people and a great source of pleasure to me. I pray God is able to use this as a \"Good Thing.\" I see regular, good people who are helpful, kind, and caring--not people who are out to exploit and harrass others--at Flickr AND with the members of my high school Yahoo groups. I'm fine with this. Competition is always good for the marketplace.\n\nages ago\n\nPaul Watson says:\n\n\"Pro account holders will get super mega bonuses, to be announced soon.\"\n\nWooohooo! Flickr hoodies! Oh wait, that was when Google bought Blogger. People still point at the tiny Google logo on mine more than the mammoth orange B on the front.\n\nWhile I don't want the team getting rich and buggering off to the Bahamas I do hope the hard working girls and boys get height-adjustable chairs now and real coffee, no more instant!\n\nWell done Flickr, don't change.\n\nages ago\n\nbosquetango says:\n\nMoi aussi. Good going to you all for surviving and giving the world the best world wide community I've been lucky enough to be part of. Now lets hope Yahoo doesn't f@ck it up! And please don't adopt the constant requirment yahoo demands to re sigh in. I know what security I need and don't need a big brother forcing me down one path.\n\nSo, pro users get a free bus ticket to visit flickr in Yaletown, i heard a rumour...\n\nages ago\n\nSpecial says:\n\nWill flickr be incorporated into the yahoo site as most of the other projects they've aquired have been? I mean.. will people have to have a yahoo id to view flickr photos?\n\nThat's the two things that worry me. That flickr will look like the yahoo site with ads everywhere and too many confusing navigation links.. and that they will force people to login to be able to view our photostreams.\n\nages ago\n\nemdot says:\n\ncongrats to ludicorp -- you guys deserve great things. and i am happy for you. i feel like my definition of what a good company is and what great customer service is has been redefined by you folk. you have something to be very proud of for the rest of your lives (that sounds corny, but i mean it seriously... most people only dream of creating such a fabulous community and service).\n\nyet... i feel a little saddened by the yahoo announcement. sigh. all things must pass, to quote the great george harrison. i'm going to jump in the knautia wagon and say if you can trust them i guess we can too... fingers crossed.\n\nages ago\n\nDawn Endico says:\n\nCongratulations! You must be very excited.\n\n> In the future, you'll be able to\n\n> log into Flickr using your Yahoo\n\n> account\n\nAre the flickr and yahoo namespaces going to remain separate? What are you going to do about name collisions? What's going to happen when fubuki@yahoo.com logs in to flickr?\n\nI can think of another merger a while back where they made thousands of people change their identity. what a mess.\n\nages ago\n\nBenODen says:\n\nCongrats! I've been a part of buy em and strip em mergers/buyouts, so I don't have great experience, but I hope you guys do better and they actually don't get in our way with their corporate guidlines!\n\nHopefully this won't effect FlickrLive's prospects for coming back down the line, though Yahoo doesn't have much in the way of global chat, so maybe you can infect Yahoo Groups with flickr Live! Then we get that work done that needs doing because they want it as badly as the FlickrLive junkies I've seen. No, not me, nuh uh. *laugh*\n\nWill this change the amount you can tell us about what's coming down the pike? We like to anticipate new toys, ya know!\n\nEverybody's bringing out their hopes and dreams to this announcement party, we're ready to dream of bigger things too, just give us inklings!\n\nOh, and nobody's asked THIS yet. When do the Y!s come out for good?\n\nages ago\n\nNeil says:\n\nCongratulations! Acquisitions are always worrisome, but I guess the best news is that \"Flickr?\" has now become \"Flickr!\"\n\nI guess Google seemed like a natural for us peon users, because like Flickr, it inspires a sort of obsessive love. On the other hand, Google is nowhere near Yahoo when it comes to providing personalized services and making communities.\n\n(sigh. I almost got a pro account yesterday.)\n\nages ago\n\nniznoz says:\n\nThink of it as Flickr acquiring Yahoo. Imagine how Yahoo can become more Flickry.\n\nNever the less I too have the same discomfort many feel when they move from their small and understandable primary/elementary schools to the big school down the road.\n\nWhat will Flickr be like with 10 million users (y'know, some time in the future)? 2 billion?\n\nIn the mean time, somebody mentioned super mega bonuses. . .\n\nages ago\n\nsarah.c says:\n\nWell yes, congratulations to you all on the personal side of things.\n\nYay! Stewart made money!\n\nI don't know that this bodes well for flickr or increases the slim chance that gne will return. I've been through this when a company I worked for was acquired and what I found was that the acquiring company nearly always says:\n\n\"Nothing will change, you guys rock!\"\n\nRight before changing everything, a smidgeon at a time. I have many friends who have gone through the same thing and it has nearly always ended badly.\n\nIf being bought was your end goal, then hey! Again, congrats.\n\nSo good luck to you all and I'll just keep hanging out to see what happens. For the sake of the nebulizers.\n\nages ago\n\nBrian T Wright says:\n\nYahoo is a very good company and I'm sure will do Flickr well. I've had their ISP service for years and their \"my yahoo\" portal is my home page. I even drive by their campus on the way to work; smiling, happy people who do not wear suits. You might not see their quality if you are not a paying member, but I can assure you I am a discriminating, happy customer.\n\nAs for any fear about ads disgracing the pro Flickr experience, there is always Firefox, as some of you have recently taught me. And with Yahoo mail I never see spam.\n\nBeside, Google is going down the toilet.\n\nages ago\n\nfallsroad says:\n\nI've only been around for two months so I'll have to put my trust in you guys that the acquisition won't destroy what is turning into a wonderful online experience for me.\n\nGood on ya for getting paid. In even the brief time I've been around I've witnessed the insanely hard work you've put into Flickr.\n\nCongrats.\n\nages ago\n\nAbu says:\n\nI think it's great that Ludicorp announced this on the Flickr Blog (and word sprads fast, even on Sunday; there are about 15 trackbacks to the posting already), but the Ludicorp web page hasn't been updated with a \"Press Release\" yet.\n\nI'll take that as a testament to where their priorities yet lie.\n\nAlso, I think it's fabulous that the devs will start getting paid for their outstanding work, which lies along several axes, from the datacenter to support a very data intensive process, to the user interface, the API work, and innovative and intuitive use of modern browser technology that degrades gracefully for older clients, as well as participating in the whole thing as members of the community they helped build. Whew.\n\nCongrats. I hope it cost Yahoo! deep in the purse.\n\nages ago\n\nlil miss priss says:\n\nCongratulations!!! and hats off to all of you.\n\ntaking deep breaths and hoping for the best. Though what I have seen in in the past few months gives me great faith in what flickr can and will achieve.\n\nand as stated above: don't change, Flickr, don't change\n\nI mean that in the good sense, of what you offer this community, your willingness to give it the best that you can.\n\nages ago\n\nholgate says:\n\nOh, I knew I should have tickle-tortured it out of you both. (Or out of Cal, since he looks to have a lower pain threshold.)\n\nSeriously, though, big congrats. I'm so chuffed for you. This ain't the beginning of the end for Flickr, in spite of what some may say, but, instead, the end of the beginning.\n\nages ago\n\nChris Campbell says:\n\nCongratulations! It's exciting and scary all at the same time.\n\nDon't forget where you came from and keep moving forward. You guys rock and you'll be spending more time doing cool stuff and less time doing administrative stuff.\n\nIt's kind of like graduating, you don't want it to end, but you know if can't stay the same forever.\n\nOnward, upward and a big toast to you all!\n\nages ago\n\nsbpoet says:\n\nI am very pleased that the folks who made this will get the money they deserve --\n\nOne of the things that makes this service so remarkable is the spectacular customer service. One of the things that makes Yahoo so disliked is its impossible customer service -- just try to find a real answer, or a real person to answer a question. I used to be a 'small business' customer of theirs; never again.\n\nI will hope they learn from you.\n\nages ago\n\nterrific rhythm [deleted] says:\n\nCongratulations, but I think I'm going to hold off a bit on the Pro account. I just hope Flickr doesn't become more Yahoo Cluttr.\n\nYahoo makes me upset: unbearably choked with irritating ads that interrupt navigation to the point that I rarely use it, and wouldn't even consider using their groups.\n\nThis talk by Scott Gatz, senior director of personalization products for Yahoo gave me a glimmer of hope that Yahoo was changing their philosophy. (My Yahoo is actually pretty decent.)\n\nHere's hoping things are changing at Yahoo, and that Flickr has not become Flickr of Borg.\n\nNow, I'm going to go read the blog post that seems to be reassuring people.\n\nages ago\n\nGail Edwin Aguiar says:\n\nPeter Norby: I completely abandoned Yahoo photo albums because of their total database restructuring several years ago -- by that time, I'd had thousands of photos arranged in albums, with links from my site. With the new database, the albums were all gone, the photos had no organisation, all links changed. I had to give up completely because they left the onus of re-linking up to the user! What kind of database is that?? Not only that, but the new default was that the albums were private, not public, so EVERYTHING had to be changed, including access and permissions. It was a gigantic, unholy mess.\n\nages ago"
