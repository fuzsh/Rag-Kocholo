        "text": "Yahoo's narrative arc as a company can be defined by its acquisitions, which taken together also serve as one take on the history of the web itself. In the Yahoo version of that history, founders and backers of overvalued companies enjoy huge exits while the buyer tends to learn too late that its exuberance was irrational. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will soon find out whether her company's $1.1 billion purchase of Tumblr becomes the latest chapter in a saga littered with mediocrity and failure.\n\n__Broadcast.com (1999)—__In one of the frothiest moments of the first dot-com bubble, Yahoo bought a financially unsuccessful internet radio startup for a reported $5.7 billion in stock and made Mark Cuban very rich. The service was rebranded Launchcast and has cycled through multiple corporate partners as better ideas – from the first Napster to Spotify – have made the very idea of \"broadcasting\" on the internet obsolete.\n\n__Geocities (1999)—__When the first great '90s nostalgia movie hits, we'll undoubtedly meet the protagonist as he rocks out to Pearl Jam while creating some sweet tiled backgrounds and table-based layouts on his GeoCities page. It's hard to fault Yahoo for swapping $3.6 billion in stock for what at the time was one of the web's most trafficked sites. It's easier to blame the company for allowing GeoCities to sputter in dot-com limbo before shuttering the U.S. version a decade later.\n\n__Overture Services (2003)—__Yahoo's purchase of Overture for more than $1.6 billion stands as its largest acquisition not directly aimed at consumers. The Google AdWords competitor was quickly rebranded as a Yahoo property and continues to serve up a high volume of internet advertising. But Yahoo has struggled to get those ads to generate as much revenue per ad as Google's, and has faced the wrath of advertisers over changes to the service.\n\n__Right Media (2007)—__To bulk up in its battle against Google, Yahoo spent $680 million to complete its acquisition of ad auction service Right Media. The purchase helped fill out Yahoo's Panama ad platform but hasn't helped Yahoo close the gap in the company's perpetual race to catch up to its dominant competitor.\n\n__Kelkoo (2004)—__Yahoo bought European price-comparison site Kelkoo in 2004 for nearly $600 million. In 2008, Yahoo reportedly unloaded the sputtering service for about one-quarter of what it paid.\n\n__Hotjobs.com (2002)—__Yahoo battled online job search rival Monster Worldwide to acquire HotJobs for $436 million. Less than a decade later, Monster took HotJobs off Yahoo's fumbling hands for $225 million.\n\n__eGroups (2000)—__In one of the few bright spots in Yahoo's history of acquisitions, its $432 million purchase of eGroups helped build the foundation of the incredibly popular Yahoo Groups. But popularity has never been Yahoo's main problem. Converting that popularity into profit is where the company has always foundered, and its priority if the Tumblr acquisition is to avoid a GeoCities repeat.\n\nThe Architect of Russia’s Google Is Back\n\nYandex cofounder Arkady Volozh fought off sanctions and kicked anti-war squatters out of his Amsterdam townhouse. Now he is ready to reveal his new AI company in the Netherlands. But can Europe forget his past?\n\nGoogle DeepMind's Chatbot-Powered Robot Is Part of a Bigger Revolution\n\nRobotics researchers are exploring how large language models can give physical machines more smarts.\n\nThe Hidden Ties Between Google and Amazon’s Project Nimbus and Israel's Military\n\nA WIRED investigation found public statements from officials detail a much closer link between Project Nimbus and Israel Defense Forces than previously reported.\n\nOpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a ‘Mini’ Model\n\nWith competing models—including many free ones—flooding the market, OpenAI is announcing a cheaper way to use its AI.\n\nOpenAI Is Testing Its Powers of Persuasion\n\nSam Altman is touting AI’s ability to sway people's behavior. His company is also wrestling with the risks.\n\nAmazon Is Investigating Perplexity Over Claims of Scraping Abuse\n\nAWS hosted a server linked to the Bezos family- and Nvidia-backed search startup that appears to have been used to scrape the sites of major outlets, prompting an inquiry into potential rules violations.\n\nLeading Lab-Grown Meat Company Cuts Dozens of Jobs\n\nUpside Foods is slashing staff, citing legislative, regulatory, and funding headwinds.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI\n\nCreators claim their videos were used without their knowledge."
