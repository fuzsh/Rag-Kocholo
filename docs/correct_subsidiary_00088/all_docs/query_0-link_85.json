        "text": "Otunba Oyenuga,\n\nYou have not explained the presence of Mr Abraham Adesanya in the entourage. Despite all the hot air about progressivusm, Hausa-Fulani this and that, the fact remains that the Yoruba remain the staunchest allies of the Hausa-Fulani in the Nigerian power game. Likewise, all the noise about southern governors and southern solidarity is mere hot air. The position taken by the obasanjo and Bola Ige duo in relation to resource control is far more reflective of the true position of the SW- Northern alliance which has been in power since 1967. All the noisy stuff simply masks the identity of interest between the Yoruba and the Hausa Fulani and their strategic aim of maintaining the Nigerian status quo. The outcome of the Chikago protests is the greatest validation yet of our concept of dual morality which will soon receive a rigorous treatment in a future edition of The Journal of Igbo Affairs.\n\nI feel sorry for those Igbo chaps who are pushed into the forefront of phoney activism and abandoned midway. Every generation of Ndiigbo experiences this phenomenon but nobody learns. Yesterday Ezeife, today the addle-headed Chicago protesters. Tufia!\n\nWhy was Adesanya there?

A couple of weeks ago, he was waxing lyrical about Alhaji Shagari\n\ncommissioning a project in Abia State. He wheeled\n\nout his decrepit snake oil theory to caution Ndiigbo about the dangers of\n\ndealing with the North.\n\nNow his hero, the future Aare Ona Kakanfo himself is tagging along in the\n\nrole of a 3rd fiddler to an ex-military dictator, the arch-ogre and the\n\nHausa-Fulani hegemonist personified- Mr Abdusalam Abubakar. otunpa Ayenuga\n\nis singing a different tone. Otunba Ayenuga has demonstrated the whole\n\nspectrum of what can go wrong with the politics of moral duality. Those Igbo\n\nwho allowed themselves to be so cynically manipulated over the Chicago will\n\nbe gnashing their teeth just like Ezeife, Udenta etc before them\n\nThis event has damaged all of Adesanya's claims to credibility and confirmed\n\nthe janus-faced manipulation that has been conceptualised as dual morality.\n\nIt is this sort of action that will make it impossible for Nigeria too be a\n\nsingle state for long. Now Otunba Oyenuga is beating his chest about Yoruba\n\npower while believing that political party registration should be an act of\n\ncharity dished out by Hausa-Fulani military fiat to which Adesanya will be\n\neternally grateful. What a farce.\n\nAnd so, within a short space of two weeks, Otunba Oyenuga has moved from\n\nsouthern solidarity through cautioning the Igbo about dealing with the North\n\nto a warm emrace with the North in the name of politics which he now\n\nconceptualises as a dirty game! From advising the Igbo against alliance with\n\nthe North, Otunba Oyenuga the janus-faced strategist now cautions Ndiigbo\n\nagainst being hollier than thou! What a load of crap!
