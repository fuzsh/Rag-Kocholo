        "text": "Index For This Page\n\nThoughts and commentary about [whatever]\n\n(Return to UtahRails Main Index Page)\n\nOverview\n\nThis is a simple effort to capture some of my own writings. I have participated in numerous online discussion groups as far back as November 1998, when I created LocoNotes on what was then OneList.com. I've been through numerous hard drive crashes, and some of what I have written about has survived, but most has not, especially before the mid 2001 time period. As I clean out my old emails, some are worth keeping, and most of those are presented here.\n\nBack in April 2005, I started a personal web log (blog) on Blogspot. It lay dormant for over two years while I was completing other projects. After the last book project, the second edition of Ogden Rails, was completed in 2005, I spent most of my time creating and updating a large number of web pages (Union Pacific steam locomotives and Union Pacific passenger cars), along with keeping the online roster listings of Union Pacific diesel locomotives up to date. Other activities included magazine articles for The Streamliner, published by Union Pacific Historical Society.\n\nIn August 2010, I migrated all of the Blogspot content to Wordpress.com, and in late June 2015, I retired the blog and migrated all of that content to either new web pages, or integrated it into existing web pages. This page is a place to put whatever does not fit on other pages.\n\nMany of the items included here come from some of the 15,000 emails I retained from as far back as 1999. I started a complete review of all my emails in October 2014, and finished the effort in May 2016. (Read more about my emails)\n\nAdditions have continued starting in May 2024, as still more emails have been reviewed and their contents integrated into UtahRails.net.\n\nWhat Makes A Good Railroad Book?\n\n(September 4, 1995, borrowing from a May 1992 essay by Harre Demoro)\n\nMost people are stunned to realize that it is just as difficult to write a good book about a railroad as it is to hammer out chapters about the White House during the Coolidge years, or a detective story. Writing books is hard work, and the financial rewards at best modest. My advice to people who want to write railroad books is: Don't. Books are awful work. To do them well requires massive bruising of ego. Books can ruin or challenge marriages and friendships -- especially friendships.\n\nOnce a person is willing to accept these conditions, the prospective railroad book author ought not to attempt to write a railroad book. The approach should be to write a book. Period. The fact that the topic may be about a railroad should not make any difference. Approach the subject as a curious person, not as a railfan. The worst research projects are conducted by people who are writing about their favorite railroad, or type of locomotive. Photographic collections usually don't make great books. The ones that are finished are almost always dull, slow journeys through every fact and non-fact, using muddy and mediocre photographs and maps. They tend to be totally about the railroad, without mentioning the geographic region, and the social, political, and economic conditions that may prevail on the railroad's operation.\n\nA book should tell a story. It should have information that almost anyone, railfan or not, would find interesting. I am doing two projects that, for the sake of readers, I probably should avoid: books about my two favorite subjects, Union Pacific diesels and the railroads of Utah. I am stumbling over facts. I am unsure my perspective is sharp. I fear I will bore the reader. The subjects are so close to me that I question my approach. The photographs and maps will be great. I have discovered that about 50 percent of what I was sure was about is 90 percent wrong and a lot of the remaining 50 percent is questionable. So I am researching more intensely that I thought would be necessary. Maybe that will save the books from dullness. I know there will be errors. Every book has them. Even mine.\n\n(View a list of my books and magazine articles.)\n\nThe Sound and The Fury\n\n(Posted to the Diesel List on April 19, 1999)\n\nThere is no sound system that gets it right, especially the feel. I appreciate the effort that went into them, but they are not for me. I have heard, and felt, the real thing. There is nothing that can duplicate the sound and feel of 12,000 ponies in four UP SD40-2s lugging 8,000 tons up Echo Canyon at 35 mph, and being side by side with them on a parallel road, for over four miles, sometimes right at truck level. The senses are almost in overload with the sound, the sand dust, the vibration; that's why I'm a modeler and a railfan. A real close second is standing at exhaust stack level as five Utah Railway SD45s and F45s pull 10,000 tons of coal past you, with four SD45s and F45s as mid train helpers, as they throttle up and come off the Utah and on to the Rio Grande at Utah Railway Junction in Price River Canyon.\n\nI think I became a railfan in the summer of 1964 as I watched and listened to a D&RGW GP9, in yellow stripes, work the Sugar House Local in Salt Lake City, following the train on my bike as it switched the myriad of industries found along the line. Its sound and feel was later firmly set in place in the cab of a UP GP9 in April 1968, when I was still in high school. There was a last run of the Cache Valley Local, a mixed local on one of UP's branch lines here in northern Utah. I was invited to sit in the fireman's seat of the train's GP9 for a good part of the trip, riding in the cupola of the caboose the rest of the trip, as they traveled at 25 mph over the branch, switching industries both coming and going. The sound and feel is something I will never forget, especially the sound of the diesel engine itself running, it is a sound truly unique to a GP9 (or at least to the 567). The sound of the engine rpm going up to kick a car, then coming back down. I have heard the sound several times since, and enjoyed it every time. A GP38-2 comes close, and is almost as good, but nothing beats a GP9.\n\nAnd, yes, an idling GP9 makes a great sleeping pill. UP's fireman and brakeman cab seats were large and extremely comfortable, nothing like those stools that are in the units now. Warm cab, dark outside, work caught up, and the boss out of sight. Good. Night.\n\nMisguided Rail Museums\n\n(Posted to Trainorders.com on on August 27, 1999.)\n\nPreserve a UP C630? Why? Because it's an Alco? It sure isn't a significant UP locomotive. As Blair said, there were only 10 C630s on UP, and they became orphans real quick. They were retired and sold six years after they were delivered.\n\nPreserve the SD40X from Cheyenne? They were definitely landmark locomotives, but not on UP. They were bears to maintain (unique electrical), and didn't play well with others. Steve Lee told me they saved the 3042 from the Houston dead line only to keep it from being scrapped, hoping to interest some museum at a later date. It was offered to several, with no response. Finally, they decided to sell it as an asset of the heritage fleet and use the money to keep the other stuff running.\n\nHow many realize that the old C&NW 5525 (planned UP 707) was the first GP40 built, as NYE 3036? I asked Steve Lee about preserving it, and he gave essentially the same answer as John Bromley, that UP is no longer in the preservation business. The heritage fleet must pay for itself.\n\nWhich brings me to the museums. The local Promontory Chapter of the NHRS had Utah Railway 306 and 401 in its collection. Great idea. But they sold them to keep their passenger car in operation, running with the Thiokol shuttle cars from Brigham City to Cape Canaveral. The money they make from these Thiokol moves doesn't come near covering the costs of keeping that stupid car in Amtrak running order, so they have to do anything they can to keep the money coming in, including getting rid of two locomotives that were very significant in Utah's railroad history. They were also offered a UP caboose back when UP was donating cabooses to anyone that was interested. Not interested. Go figure.\n\nIn 1993, Morrison Knudsen took over the maintenance of Utah Railway's locomotives, a fleet of rebuilt SD40s. When MK took over the actual shop space, they wanted the McKeen car body moved. This is the steel body of the largest McKeen car built, the most powerful one built, and the only one with a six-axle power truck. The car body had been sitting adjacent to the Utah's locomotive shop since 1926, and was recognized by Utah Railway as being historically significant. They offered it to the NRHS for preservation. Guess what? I was told that the NRHS chapter responded that they did not have the money to move the car (they were saving it for needed maintenance on the trucks on their passenger car). Utah offered to pay for the move. NRHS chapter said they did not have the money to store the car. End of discussion, thanks but no thanks. The car was sold to an employee, cut in half, and moved to his farm as a storage shed.\n\nRoster From Hell\n\n(August 9, 1999)\n\nUnion Pacific after the Harriman era is a fascinating subject. Unfortunately, there isn't near enough information published on the subject. The limited number of books and articles available are more a reflection of a publisher's personal interest in UP, rather than the road's marketability as the subject of a book. For the past ten years, I have been struggling to get the information into print, without it being edited for space or page count. The worst example was the 1992 UP locomotive annual. The roster in that book was severely edited for space because they wanted to include the articles at the front. The folks at Hyrail called it the \"roster from hell.\" If it was such, it was purely because they were trying to make it smaller. I sent them a full UP roster, from 1980 to 1992, including all new units, all renumberings, all retirements, and all known sales. I tried to convince them that while the articles and photos might sell the book, it was the roster that would have readers coming back to the book, and to Hyrail for more UP books. The 1992 book did not sell well, giving them the impression that UP does not sell well. I have just sent an all-time UP diesel roster to Withers Publishing, from 1934 to 1999. Time will tell how many volumes it ends up being.\n\nRoster Information Copyright\n\n(December 10, 1999)\n\nAn interested observer wrote: \"Information, facts themselves, cannot be copyrighted. If they could, every book whose bibliography lists other books would be in violation copyright law. In the present situation, off the top of my head, I can think of half a dozen different references by different authors that contain the information that ATSF 1460 is ex-1160, exx-2450, and exxx-2220. Who owns the copyright on that information? The publishers? The railroad? Actually, no one does. Those are facts, and cannot be copyrighted.\"\n\nWhen I started down this road of compiling information for publication in 1992, with the UP 1992 annual, Dale Sanders and I had a serious discussion about copyright. The advise he had received was that information cannot be copyrighted, but the format in which it is presented can be. Hence, Dale stuck with his established format, and the book was copyrighted by Hyrail, forcing them to re-type the entire roster, introducing several typographical mistakes in the process. It's a hard business to be in.\n\nFor the 1995 C&NW book, I did the roster and Paul Withers presented it in a particular format, and the copyright is his. I took the format I had initially used for the C&NW book, changed it slightly from lessons-learned for better usability and easier reading, and began compiling all my rosters in that format. When the 1998 UP locomotive directory was published, it presented the roster in my unique format, and Paul put my name on it as copyright owner. The 1999 book was the same, as will be the upcoming 1934-1982 book and 2000 locomotive directory. (In later locomotive directories after my last one in 2000, Paul Withers used a format that he developed and those books are his as copyright holder.)\n\nRobert Del Grosso's books present the BN and BNSF rosters in a unique format, that is recognizable as being done by Mr. Del Grosso. Hopefully, the UP rosters I have done are also recognizable as mine, as any author's writing style is recognizable as coming from that author. I don't own the information about Union Pacific's diesel locomotive fleet, but, hopefully, I present the information in a readable and usable format.\n\nI started this mailing list [LocoNotes] 14 months ago to share information about locomotives. The initial subscribers were all people that I specifically invited, and they are all publishers of locomotive information. I meant this list to serve as forum to develop information that would eventually find itself into published books and articles. ** And to seek out errors that need to be corrected. **\n\nUnfortunately, while the list has definitely served that purpose, it has also served as a source of information for folks who are building their own private databases, which bothers me a bit because a private database is just that, private. But that is the subject of another discussion.\n\nWhile I would like to publish an all-time UP roster to the web, it would be so big that it would cost me extra cash each month to rent server space, and I would not be able to make any of that money back. It is better to publish to a book, and thereby make it available to many more people. Contrary to what we read and hear in the media, the internet will not be replacing published information, at least in our life times. But it is a great place to gather and share information, and spread the latest rumors. I don't care who uses the information from my rosters, as long as they at least give me credit.\n\nThe Last One\n\n(December 26, 1999\n\nThe 2000 locomotive directory will be the last one. I'm giving serious consideration to dropping out of the current UP roster information loop. Both Paul Withers and I are kind of suffering from burn-out, and there are a lot of other things we both want to do, like the Merger Era book(s), and I want to get some modeling done. December 31, 1999 seems like an excellent date to end my interest in the current UP locomotive fleet. With Joe Shine dropping the Motive Power Annuals, and Withers backing off on the UP loco directory, that kind of leaves an open market (for a book with a press run of about 1,500 or maybe 2,000 books). The Motive Power Annuals are expensive and time consuming to produce, and the locomotive directories are extremely time consuming. I'm tired of it, and I wanna do something else. The two Classic Era volumes are done (and the follow-on Merger Era book(s) are almost done), and that has really been the focus of my interest for the past ten years. I think it's time for someone else to pick up the torch.\n\nDoing The Minimum\n\n(December 28, 1999)\n\nMost fans do not realize that the large railroads spend only the absolute minimum resources keeping track of their locomotive fleets. To them, it's like a utility company keeping track of their pick-up trucks. When I got into Kennecott Copper's property management records searching for renumber and retirement information for their electric and diesel fleet at the Utah operations, I was very surprised at the minimal methods large corporations use to keep track of millions of dollars worth of property, and my recent association with UP and their various renumber plans, and the minimal methods they use to keep track of their millions and millions of dollars worth of locomotives has been a real eye-opener. I'm losing interest real fast -- what a mess! It is truly like hitting your head against a brick wall.\n\nRoster Notes\n\n(March 19, 2000)\n\nConcerning the use of general notes in a locomotive roster, versus using specific notes for a single locomotive; although a general note may call out a specific unit, for the Union Pacific 2000 locomotive directory, I retained most notes as general notes because they deal with a subject or situation that applies more to a feature for the group than to that specific unit. Just because a note calls out a specific unit, it does not mean that it automatically needs to be a specific note.\n\nThe 1999 locomotive directory had many specific notes that had originally been general notes. I had one comment from a reader in July 1999 July that he found all of the specific notes a bit confusing, but I told him that we weren't going to do it that way again. But the final proofs for the 2000 directory showed that the editors had left the specific notes unchanged, which I found to be a bit upsetting.\n\nMy own definition of what is a specific note grew out of the earlier use of notes as dispositions. When I began using the heading of \"Notes\" rather than \"Dispositions,\" I continued to use specific notes only as dispositions. Conceding to an editor's thinking, I made all of the changes for a couple of the groups, but going back and reading them, they just don't seem right. It's simply not the way that I wanted the roster to read.\n\nI realize that the editor was concerned with the readability of the text, but so am I -- I guess the editors were assuming that I hadn't given much thought to the \"readability\" of the roster, that I was just stuffing numbers into a big list of numbers. If I have learned nothing else from authoring books, I have learned that I must consider the reader in everything that I write. I am also concerned with the amount of keyboarding that has to be done for each change. Every time we touch the keyboard, it is possible to introduce new mistakes.\n\nI will continue to use general notes for first and last units to be repainted into a group, because it deals with the repainting of the whole group, rather than a specific unit. Plus, in almost all cases, I would have to add another column just for notes on references to the first and last numbers repainted. With the many groups of renumbered units that would have been in the 2001 locomotive directory, and with the additional column for unit history, there was not sufficient horizontal room for additional columns.\n\nLife Changes\n\n(November 20, 2000)\n\nI was surprised at the silliness of a recent discussion of builder plate dates on the LocoNotes discussion group. Hopefully, I made it clear in my last posting that I was asking what to do if I didn't have plate dates, taken from actual checks of the builder's plate. Would it be okay to use delivery dates. The whole thing got twisted out of proportion.\n\nThis most recent UP 2000 Locomotive Directory will be the last. I may even give up moderating the LocoNotes discussion group. I am finding the whole current UP roster quite boring, mostly because with this renumbering effort and the people I have come to know, I can see just how incompetent the upper layers of UP's locomotive fleet management really is. In my day job I see good logistics management and planning, and plenty of bad planning too. The UP renumbering is a massive project, being very badly executed. BNSF did it so much better. It is simply a matter of good planning, which UP has never had to do.\n\nIt is a lot more fun researching history, especially Utah railroads and mining. After reading Ambrose's recent book, I am heading back into that subject, especially how the whole thing affected Utah before 1900. I have enjoyed helping the folks at the UP historical society, but most of those guys have blinders on and only see UP steam, especially operating excursion steam.\n\nI have been building a web site to share what I have, since I am haunted by the image of the only copy of my research being here in my basement. At least on a web site, it is available to anyone with a computer and internet access. I have pretty much given up on trying to make money from this stuff, since the personal cost in time and emotional strain is way too high. And I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable jumping through hoops and meeting deadlines, just so someone else can make a lot more money than me, off of my work. I'd rather share it free of charge.\n\nBook Reviews\n\n(May 10, 2001)\n\nOne of the many valuable lessons I have learned by being part of the publishing community is that no one gives a negative review. It's okay to give a positive review, but you will never see a negative review in any publication that has any advertisers to keep happy, or any kind of standing in the publishing field. It's okay to say what's right about a subject, but unless you truly feel that the item is a rip-off (and not merely as good as you think it should be), and that the producer is a con-man simply trying to separate people from their money, I would stay away from a negative review.\n\nIf you read an neutral review, it could mean that the reviewer did not care for the product, but had enough courtesy to not say so. Case in point is the recent review of my Diesels of the UP, 1934-1982, Volume 1 in Trains magazine. It is a neutral review in that the reviewer simply told what the book was about, and did not include any positive remarks, such as \"This is the best book ever written!\" A neutral review could also mean that the reviewer has no background at all in the subject of the book, so really could not do an in-depth review.\n\nI have seen several exchanges recently in online communities about whether or not someone is qualified to publish a review, meaning does the reviewer have a background in the subject being reviewed, giving credibility to his opinion. Simply being a consumer of the product does not make one qualified to publish a review. Such a thing would be akin to me doing a review of a book about the steam locomotives of the Florida East Coast simply because I decided to buy a copy of the book for its pretty pictures. I have no background whatsoever in FEC steam locomotives, so why would anyone care what Don Strack thinks about such a book. If I went ahead and did a review anyway, it would show an embarrassing level of arrogance on my part. But hey, that's just me. Back in my apprenticeship days at Union Pacific, many, many years ago, a very wise old boilermaker once told me, \"It's best to stay quiet and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\"\n\nPublished Facts\n\n(July 23, 2001)\n\nA well-known magazine editor wrote: \"What irritates me is that people speculate wildly on the internet -- and announce the \"facts\" with certitude -- but never once bother to ask the source. All they have to do is e-mail me! But I think they would rather throw stones than do anything else. They're not after information, or knowledge, or truth, or understanding; they're after making themselves feel more important.\"\n\nSteam Cleaning Tank Cars\n\n(April 2, 2002)\n\nI commented on the Steam Freight Cars group in answer to a comment that \"In those days, steam was everywhere in a railroad yard.\"\n\nUP maintained its tank car steam cleaning facility at Salt Lake City at least through 1978. They cleaned an average of 8 to 10 tank cars every day because of the nearby refineries. I got to know the old carman quite well. He was semi-crippled by an on the job accident and had spent over 10 years doing only one thing, cleaning tank cars. He had been a German soldier in World War II, and a prisioner of war to the Russians until 1949. He shared many war stories with me. I gotta say, that man hated Russians.\n\nThere were 6 cleaning stations along a ramp that was mounted at dome level, very similar to a tank car loading facility. The steam wands were lowered into the tank car through the open dome, the bottom drain was opened, and the steam turned on for about 4 hours.\n\nOthers commented that they assumed that besides the platform, there would be a boiler house and some sort of facility for handling the waste water? Another commented, \"A waste water facility? Not in those days. They probably just drained it into the nearest ditch!\"\n\nThe Speeder\n\n(January 10, 2003)\n\nBack on a night in spring of 1969, Rod Edwards, Floyd Jarvis, and Dennis Spendlove and I ran a motorized speeder up and down D&RGW's Wilford Brick Spur, which served Interstate Brick.\n\nThe backstory...\n\nWhile I was still a senior in high school, and during one of my regular railfan visits of Rio Grande's Roper Yard, I noticed a speeder sitting in the section gang's off-track equipment yard near 21st South. I asked about it, and found that it had been wrecked and written off. But it was still in pretty good shape. I bought it for $1, and Rod Edwards and I figured out a way to get it from Roper up to his garage at his home in Sugarhouse, maybe somehow using my Dodge Power Wagon (an early SUV). Rod's home was on the stub of 11th East, just north of 27th South.\n\nWe moved the speeder into Rod's small garage and got it cleaned up. I made new seat cushions in my high school upholstery class. Mostly, what was wrecked was the cab enclosure, so the car we got running was just the open version. One night we pushed it about 300 feet south down Rod's street to 27th South, then then east about 100 feet to the D&RGW Interstate Brick Spur.\n\nFloyd and I were the big guys, so we were elected to push the car to get it going. It took a couple tries, but we soon got it going -- putt, putt, putt, bang, putt, etc. We rode the car back and forth several times, from the brick yard at the south end, north to where the spur connected to the Sugarhouse branch, about two miles.\n\nWe commenced running it back and forth for about an hour. Sitting on my four new cushions, we all enjoyed the wind in our hair. We finally stopped at the Fairmont Lanes bowling alley at the spur's north end to get something to eat. Fairmont Lanes used to be on the curve near where the UTA Sugar House line ends today.\n\nAfter having a milk shake to celebrate, we came out and found a couple Salt Lake City policemen with flashlights looking over the speeder, as it was sitting on the rails adjacent to the bowling alley parking lot. The policemen were obviously trying to figure out what to do. We told them we were the owners, and they told of receiving reports that some kids had stolen the speeder and were running it up and down the track. We clarified the situation and they told us to take it back where we started, and stop making noise. We were closely watched by the policemen as we pushed the car by hand back to Rod's garage.\n\nTo this day, I don't know why we didn't at least get ticketed. Likely all we did was trespass and disturb the peace with the pop-pop of the car's two-cylinder engine. And since D&RGW didn't even know we were on their tracks, we likely got off real easy. Great memory, but it was at night, so no photos.\n\nI don't recall what happened to the speeder. It likely ended up at Heber, along with all the other stuff Rod Edwards claimed ownership to that was moved to Heber.\n\nLocomotive Improvements\n\n(December 12, 2003)\n\nBrian Rutherford wrote: \"If the reason for Tunnel motors is NOT to draw air in from a lower level in tunnels, can Jack explain why EMD and SP used \"elephant ears\" to test out the idea of drawing in air from down lower previous to building tunnel motors? I have to question this \"revised\" version of the tunnel motor reasoning as explained by Jack Wheelihan in Trains magazine.\"\n\nI responded: The increased cooling capacity due to larger radiators came as a side benefit. I agree that the SP experiments, beginning with the mods to the SP and ex-D&RGW Krause-Maffei units, were indeed to pull cooler air from lower in the tunnels/snowsheds. After SP prevailed on EMD to do the T-2 model, everyone found that the larger air intakes, along with larger radiators, produced the quicker recovery \"between tunnels\" that Wheelihan wrote about.\n\nLocomotive design is a very fluid and dynamic effort, and we locomotive geeks tend to put labels in each change (phase), when in fact, the changes are constant and on-going; some are simply more obvious than others. In my UP research alone, UP has been responsible for numerous improvements both inside and outside on EMD units since the late 1950s, and on GE units since the late 1980s. SP likely had its day in the sun with the T-2s.\n\nI've been told that the improvements in extended range dynamic braking since about 1965 was in answer to UP's and other roads' use of dynamic braking as a train control device, out in the flat lands as trains made their way across the bumps and dips of the high plains. After Missouri Pacific took over UP, they soon found that dynamic braking was also well used descending down the bluffs of the river valleys.\n\nGood Data vs. Bad Data\n\nPosted to the RR Rosters discussion group on August 9, 2004.\n\nTom Lundeen wrote: \"Once info is published, it's all but impossible to straighten it out for all of those reached by the initial publication. It's especially a problem for someone who comes upon the erroneous data years later.\"\n\nThis is what haunts me with everything I have ever had published. I get emails almost weekly asking for documentation for some data that was published 3, 5, or even 10 years ago. And then, there's the mistakes that creep into every article or book due to inadequate review due to publishing time constraints.\n\nA new example is the article in the most recent \"The Streamliner\" from Union Pacific Historical Society. An article was completed about UP's GE U50 locomotives. Like many other articles beginning in the late 1970s, the author (or the editor in this case) called the units U50D, based on a Don Dover comment in late 1969. These units were never known as U50D by anybody other than railfan writers, and yet, 30 years later, that incorrect nomenclature still haunts us.\n\nThe same with UP's 500 class F9s. They were never F9M, or F3u. Never! But yet, because of some author or editor saying so, all these years later they are regularly referred to as these types of units. Same goes for SP's rebuilt SD40 and SD45s. They were never, never called SD40E or SD45E, by anybody but over-enthusiastic railfans, but to this day, we read about these units as having these model designations.\n\nThis is one of my hot buttons. He who writes the book, writes the history, whether it's good data or bad data. It's great if your ego needs constant stroking. But for me, all I want to do is get it right.\n\nRailfans and railroad modelers are a habitual lot. It's hard to get them moving, but once the movement starts, there's no stopping it. \"I learned what I learned then, and by damn, you ain't changing what I learned.\"\n\nRailfan Photos\n\nPosted to Trainorders.com, June 7, 2005\n\nI kind of chuckle when a railfan goes on and on about how he wants his photos to last a lifetime, or even a century. I have thousands of 35mm slides, but there they sit. Most have only been looked at less than 5 times each in 30 years.\n\nWhat do you do with your rail photos? Look at the slides, holding them up to a light? Show them to friends using a slide projector? Send them to some publisher to be published in a magazine or book? Sell extra originals? Make duplicates and sell them? Make prints and sell them? Make prints and hang them on your wall? It's your hobby - do what you want.\n\nA couple months ago, I was given the opportunity to go through thousands of wonderful color slides taken by Roger Kingsford, for use in my upcoming second edition of Ogden Rails. I had always heard of his great photos of Ogden railroads, and seen a couple examples. Great stuff, but it turns out he was more of a scenery photographer than a rail photographer, with less than 60 actual railroad photos among the thousands of other photos. Roger died a couple years ago (at age 92), and his brother (age 83) has all of the thousands of Roger's slides. There are some absolutely beautiful scenery shots, but all they are, are great shots that can be used in the odd calendar here and there. The brother sincerely wants to do what is right, but is overwhelmed. They aren't worth anything, money-wise, other than to sell them to some stock photo house. But, Roger sure enjoyed taking the photos in the first place, which I think makes it all worth while.\n\nI know one local railfan who has been extremely focused on locomotive photos for over 35 years. He has taken some great photos (many bordering on mind-boggling), and he has been trading slides for most of those 35 years, so he also has thousands and thousands of other people's well-exposed locomotive photos. What will he do with his slide collection? He says that when he dies, his wife can burn them all, for all he cares. Whether he is serious with that comment, or not, such an attitude is quite surprising considering how important his hobby is to him today.\n\nIn the past 5 years or so, I have virtually stopped taking rail photos. Why? Because I realized I wasn't doing anything with them. Yes, I have done several books and magazine articles, but they have used mostly other people's photos, which for a variety of reasons is like getting blood from a turnip. Everyone (with good reason) protects their photos and many simply won't send them to anyone. So, what do you do with your rail photos?\n\nAs for my slides, I have sold thousands, and have kept thousands more. What will I do with those that are left? I've left specific instructions that they should go to the local university's special collections, along with all my railroad research, where they will sit, well cared for, and likely never be looked at again.\n\nBelieving the Written Word\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups, September 28, 2005\n\nWay back on August 20th, Joe Brugger wrote:\n\nAt any rate, in a world of $50 - $100 books, it's [Wikipedia] a useful tool for the researcher.\n\nLike all sources; some are good and some are bad. It's up to the reader to figure out the difference. That's what a \"scholar\" is, someone who has wasted enough time going down alleys to see if they are blind, and can call the bullshit factor right away when reading something.\n\nI have a co-worker who quotes the Bible regularly to prove or disprove whatever point is under discussion, and obviously believes whatever he reads that is printed to paper. Like many others who think that if they read it, it must be gospel, either on paper or on a computer screen.\n\nThis attitude scares the yikes out of me. As a railroad author, I am haunted by this way of thinking, as in, \"Will this story be quoted forever as the definitive source?\" I certainly hope not. I sincerely hope that anything I write gets someone either curious enough, or mad enough, to do his or her own research; either to add to what I write, or to prove me wrong. Please do. My favorite phrase is, \"As always, comment or correction is most welcome.\" And I truly mean it when I say it. Not that I'm on some sort of crusade, but that's what I like about Wikipedia: it's open source nature so that anyone can add to, or correct what is published on any particular subject.\n\nHistorical Vandalism\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups, September 28, 2005.\n\nBlair Kooistra wrote:\n\n. . . where it can sit in boxes on a concrete floor and rot away. OR it can be sent to a large museum or library, where it will likely also sit in a box until it crumbles into dust. Just donating the material someplace doesn't guarantee that it will be 'saved.\" Lord knows there isn't enough money out there for museums and such to take care of what they've got, let alone process the piles of new stuff donated to them. I find the bigger issue of \"historical vandalism\" is the destruction of large amounts of valuable (to me at least!) paper material and computer data by railroads in this country over the past couple of decades. Containers of shredded documents sent overseas for recycling; the reliance (can't blame em, really) of putting all the information on computers to save space, cost, money and improve accessibility to the information. None of which bodes well for the historically minded.\n\nLike many other railroad historians, I've certainly done my share of dumpster diving. How about the time, during a light drizzle on a weekday morning many Aprils ago, I was ass-deep in Union Pacific's South-Central (old LA&SL) superintendent records, at the wrong end of a 24-inch cardboard tube that hung outside of the top floor of the Salt Lake depot. The stuff I was finding from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s makes me almost weepy-eyed today. Everyday stuff, like tearing down this roundhouse, or building that new spur. It was an unplanned opportunity, so all I had was a (dumped-out) grocery sack, which was soon filled to the brim. I was already late to get someplace else, and by the time I got back to the dumpster, a new one was in place. Whatever was in the first dumpster was gone. Gone forever.\n\nMy recent Ogden book gave me several more chances to see other people's stuff, and where they were keeping it. Like Blair said, in a box, rotting on a concrete floor. When I think of all the stuff the kids have thrown out after the old man died, oh my! Here's the scenario: Dad's been in the hospital for three weeks, and he passes on. In about a week, the kids go into his train room and say, \"Now what?\" They all know how important this all was to Dad, but none of them have the faintest idea of what to do with it. Depending on whatever else is going on in their lives, the photos, books, magazines, and other odd paper items, may or may not get to the local historical society. More than likely, for want of time or desire, it all goes to the dump.\n\nA couple months ago, while en route to the annual convention in Denver, I helped the Union Pacific Historical Society go through boxes and boxes of stuff that gets donated to them every year. Most of it from the old railroaders in the Cheyenne area. By far, most of it is junk, like drink coasters or match books, but in almost every box there is a gem that truly adds to the documentary evidence of the Union Pacific Railroad. One recent example is in a box full of UP calendars from the 1990s. Among the rolled-up calendars, there was a calendar from 1953 and another from 1958. In the same box were some mimeographed sheets meant as a guide for dignitaries on board a business car. The sheets described the Wyoming Division in mind boggling detail, with full history and intelligent commentary about the business and traffic of the division at the time, in this case, 1963. Great stuff.\n\nOf course, we are all free to do whatever we want with our stuff, and this *is* just a hobby. But any historian (of any subject) can tell you a story of how he or she found something that really told the story better, simply because someone kept that photo, or piece of paper. We should all be giving some thought to what happens to our stuff after we leave this earthly existence.\n\nTrying To Write Right\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups, November 23, 2005.\n\nIn a discussion about researching and writing, Joe Brugger wrote on November 22, 2005:\n\nThe word for that process is \"gathering string,\" picking up bits and pieces of a story until it finally gels into some kind of coherent picture. For the writer, it's research, observation and interviews.\n\nThis is my experience also. Before an article takes shape, or text for a book starts to firm up on the computer screen, I have always done the digital equivalent of 3x5 note cards, i.e., a Word file that is arranged in chronological order to help me understand my subject. Then, I make a trip. My most vivid was a couple years ago when I wrote about UP's Shay locomotives, and the mining district here in Utah where they ran (published by the Union Pacific Historical Society in The Streamliner, Volume 19, Number 3, summer 2005)\n\nFor the Tintic article, I had looked at what seems to be a hundred maps and photos of the area, and then there I was, standing on the abandoned grade between Eureka and Mammoth, where the UP uphill line crossed the D&RGW downhill line. The crossing is a flat patch of cinder covered sagebrush hillside, and suddenly I could hear the offbeat exhaust of UP 61 as it climbed the 3 percent up to Mammoth. The view out across the Tintic Valley is still astounding, and the ghosts of Shay locomotives were so vivid that the memory is deeply embedded forever. I had the complete attention of 10 or so whiteface cattle, but they will never understand.\n\n(Read the text of the Tintic article)\n\nOther times, I've been working on Utah coal mining areas in Carbon County. Although the mines are long gone, as well as the rail spurs and branches that served them, I have stood among the sagebrush in Spring Canyon and listened to the ghosts of Utah Railway and D&RGW coal jobs as they shove their empties up the canyons. Malleys and Alcos, oh my!\n\nAnd of course, there's the magic spot on the curve at Echo as UP super power charges up the 1.14 percent, whether the power is a Challenger, a Big Blow, a Centennial, or today's SD70Ms, raw horsepower is raw horsepower. I've told my wife that she should spread my ashes on the ties of Number 2 track at Echo. She thinks I'm joking, but the thought of what's left of me mingling with the traction sand of up-bound trains headed east, brings a grin to my face every time.\n\nAs to the process of notes becoming something more final, I have come to realize that many of my projects will never come to final form, with maps and photos. So I made the decision a couple years ago to share my research notes with the world on my UtahRails web site. There they are, warts and all. The worst wart is the number of times that I failed to record where I got the information from. They are the result of 20-year-old research, back before I realized that I would not be able to remember where I got the information from. Oh well. At least the poor schmuck who follows me will at least have the barest of leads, so they can do better research.\n\nWhat To Do With It All\n\n(Originally posted to Trainorders.com on December 11, 2005.)\n\nI have also been giving lots of thought about what to do with what's in my basement. I have one advantage of a family member being an employee of my state's archive department. By far, most of what they preserve is mandated by either federal law or state law. Items such as birth and death records, military records, and communications and correspondence concerning the state's lawmakers. The advantage here is that they are not rail-centered, and everything that comes into their hands is treated with equal importance. They have a nice new high-tech storage facility, and everything at least gets its own archive box, with proper indexing in their multi-layered computer database, which is also accessible by way of an internet connection.\n\nMy state (Utah) is small enough that there are three state entities that are equally capable of preserving my stuff: the state archives themselves, the state university (University of Utah), and the state historical society. All are tied together by virtue of shrinking state budgets, and management of all three communicate closely to make best use of those limited funds, meaning they want to avoid duplicate efforts.\n\nMy major concern is that the stuff be accessible from a public entity, funded by public monies. This will ensure that at least the stuff is accessible, although the trend lately with all archives nationwide makes it hard for anyone to simply drop by to do some same-day research. Planning ahead is essential.\n\nThe point of this is that my stuff will likely be donated to the University of Utah's Special Collections. But before I die, I am getting good, professional advice as to the best ways to organize all that I have, and to get the stuff as fully indexed as possible, including good summaries that non-rail people (namely archives employees) can readily understand. What it is and why it's important. Also, I am making the time and financial commitment to get the photos scanned and preserved to CDs and DVDs. I've spent the past 30 years researching various aspects of Union Pacific history, and the history of railroads in Utah, and among the stuff are the only copies of numerous paper items and photographic prints and negatives and color slides, and I really don't want any of that to be lost to some random dumpster.\n\nRailroad Books I\n\n(December 30, 2005)\n\nIn an email exchange with Larry Southwick, I wrote.\n\n\"That's why I do my UtahRails web site, to get the information out to anyone interested, without having to worry about page count and skyrocketing production costs. My previous four or five book projects have taught me the hard lessons of book publication and book publishers. I dream almost daily about obtaining funding for a good, well-researched book about Utah railroads. Its cost would be pretty steep, especially since I now have a couple solid points of reference on book production. The real costs come from photo acquisition and map production. Plus there is always that stick-in-the-mud thing called page count. More pages directly relates to higher costs. Right now, I estimate that the costs run about $100-$120 per page, and I can easily envision a 400-page book about Utah's railroads. My recent 172-page Ogden Rails book, published this year, cost $32,000 to produce, but it has lots of color photos, which drives the cost way up. Two other separate projects could include books about Utah's coal mining and the story of railroads and mining in Bingham Canyon.\"\n\nRailroad Books II\n\n(January 22, 2006)\n\nThe author seldom has control over who gets gratis copies. That's the publisher. Sure, an author can send a gratis copy to a contributor, but he usually has to pay for it himself, out of the his paltry royalties. A hearty thank you and proper credit is usually all that the author can afford, especially in our extremely limited railroad market.\n\nBad captions are the bane of an author. You can only do so much research, and usually the publisher is breathing down your neck with a printer's window staring him in the face. Time is money, and tweaking captions and factoids usually falls by the wayside. I can't imagine what a general technology writer goes through to get his information compiled. Sure he misses the mark on a shockingly regular basis, but at least he is getting the books out, and as long as the publisher sells books, they will continue to publish books. And besides, 99 percent of railroad books are never read anyway.\n\nWhen, oh when, will my fellow railroad authors learn that railfans and railroad modelers buy railroad books for the pretty pictures. As I travel around the country, and talk to my potential buyers at various train shows, conventions, and general gatherings, I was at first shocked (and now accept) by the fact that very few railroad book buyers actually read the books they buy. They buy them for reference for some future project. When the book is first carried home, they flick through it quickly to admire a few of the photos, glance closely at about a third of them, read one or two captions, and put the book on the shelf. Acquisition completed. Library expanded. Done.\n\nBut I still write for the one or two buyers who are truly interested in the subject. It's just that I write web pages now, and have left the economics of railroad publishing in the dust. The realities and economics of railroad publishing are simply too frustrating. Now, my only limitation is time.\n\nRoster Style and Format\n\n(Posted to the Observation Car group at Yahoo Groups, on January 16, 2006.)\n\nA question about roster style and format:\n\nI recently upgraded some software to Microsoft Office which includes Access and Excel. It is time to move my MRL roster from the old Radio Shack TRS-80 4p to the real world of Windows XP.\n\nThe question is about any 'standard' roster formats for Access or Excel. Does anyone know of a boilerplate template commonly used for rosters to allow greater interchangeability? Lacking a set format, what common column headers are used to make the data easier to integrate with other personal formats?\n\nI also have Lotus Smart Suite available to me and could use the database in that program instead of the Office option.\n\nMr. Ardinger, Mr. Strack what works best in your experience? How well does Access work with dBase based rosters? Is there an easy way to attach photo thumbnails to a roster entry? Can the finished roster be posted to a web page with links to photos?\n\nI did my first locomotive roster in January 1973. It covered the diesel and electric locomotives of Kennecott's Utah Copper Division. It was done on a regular typewriter. My first computer arrived in late 1986, but was characters on an amber screen. The software was Wordstar. Within a couple years I was using a Windows computer with WordPerfect. In late 1988 I started compiling my Utah railroads research into computer files, including the locomotive rosters.\n\nFrom then on, all my rosters were formatted as tab-delimited columns in WordPerfect files. The first ones were what was used in Cockle's UP 1990 book. Next came the UP 1992 book from Hyrail, with the same file structure. By the time of the C&NW book in 1995, I had switched to Word and soon discovered that tables worked better than columns. For the files that were used for publication, I converted the tables to tab-delimited columns, but the actual roster files remained as tables.\n\nWhen I did my first web rosters, it was by direct conversion of the tabled Word files, into tabled HTML files, although Word back then (and still to some degree today) tended to produce really bloated HTML files. I have since gained quite a bit of experience in manipulating HTML tables, especially using styles for the actual on-line presentation. Today, the actual roster data is in simple HTML rows and cells, with CSS styles governing how the data looks.\n\nI have tried using formal databases on several occasions (including Access and FileMaker), starting way back in the late 1980s with DBASE II. But getting the reports to generate in a format usable in publishing was always the limiting factor. I always ended up exporting the report to a delimited text file and fixing it in either WordPerfect or Word. I have used Excel spreadsheets with some success, but always ended up exporting them into Word tables to be able to format the rosters into a usable format.\n\nFor anyone looking to start compiling rosters, I would recommend using tables in Word (or any other word processor). Using a database is too complex for the simple data we use in rail equipment rosters.\n\nAll my rosters today are done in HTML using Dreamweaver as the editor of choice. Editing a roster is very easy in Dreamweaver because it displays the HTML code as What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) tables, and I simply edit the data in the tables. Take a look at the source code for any of the rosters at UtahRails.net and you will see \"the man behind the curtain\".\n\nUsing this combination of software makes immediate publishing very easy, and I don't have to hassle with page-count as a limiting factor. Publishing to the web removes all of the limitations that publishing to paper brings with it, such as the limitations of page count, the lack of promotion, the lack of distribution, and the limited press runs. Of course, I have never seen my railroad interests as a potential revenue stream, which is good since there really isn't any money in it, except for fewer than five publishers who need to cover as broad a market as possible. Serving a broad market means that any \"deep-dive\" into any subject needs to be kept at a minimum.\n\nUnion Pacific Public Relations\n\nPosted to the Union Pacific discussion group on March 12, 2006.\n\nUnion Pacific abandoned their public relations department about 20 years ago, in lieu of what they called a \"Corporate Affairs Department\". The result may have served the bean counter mentality and modern management types very well (if you can't measure it, good or bad, then don't do it), but from then on their stature with the public began to deteriorate and continues to suffer greatly. When will corporate America learn that there simply is no way to measure good will, until the time that you need it and don't have it.\n\nI largely became a fan of Union Pacific back in the mid 1960s when I sent several letters to the public relations departments of several railroads nationwide, asking for information about their railroad. I think there were 16 letters, since my Mom made me reimburse her for the postage out of my weekly allowance. Regardless of the total number, I remember that I got responses from only about half the requests. Yup, UP's response was by far the largest and most in-depth. I still have all the booklets, maps and photos. I had two uncles working for UP at the time, who were both quite happy to answer my numerous questions. From then on, I was a UP man, and four years later as soon as I turned 18, I got a job with UP, which itself lead to a deep appreciation for the road's locomotives, equipment, and history.\n\nThat simple response from John Witherbee at UP, to me as a 14-year-old, literally changed my life. It likely cost UP somewhere in the $5.00 range to put the package together and send it to me. Of course, the costs of maintaining a Public Relations department and compiling and printing all the literature would be far in excess of that $5 figure. I have since learned that Mr. Witherbee, along with at least three other full-time employees, were completely and fully engaged on a full-time basis answering mail and working with the media keeping UP's name out there and keeping it's image positive. They stopped in the late 1980s, after trying to reduce costs by contracting part of the effort out. The bean counters still were not happy (\"Can't measure it -- get rid of it.\"), so the department was forced to die a slow and agonizing death.\n\nBad press is a direct result of a bad and incomplete public relations effort, and UP has certainly been the subject of bad press coverage. The worst of which was the 1996 meltdown. We all saw the lead stories on CNN, NBC, and other media outlets about how UP's trains had literally stopped running. The causes were numerous and varied, but the news media did not care, and still do not care. It was a dramatic story and they all ran with it. It has turned out to be the first of several anti-railroad stories from several national media outlets.\n\nBad news stories are a direct result of a lack of understanding on the part of the storywriters. No one in the news media knows anything about railroads and the part they play in America's economy. When America's railroad corporations decided to focus on investor information and shareholder value, trying to cow-tow to the fickleness of Wall Street, they abandoned general public information. And the public (and the media) has responded in kind, with a general negative feeling for railroads, except that they run steam locomotives, passenger trains, and cabooses. Those three bits of operational details have been gone for 45 years, 35 years, and 20 years respectively, but not in the public's eye.\n\nWho's fault is that? A very wise man once said, \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" Another cliche would be, \"You get what you pay for.\" UP stopped paying for good public relations 20 years ago, and they seem to have struggled in the public eye ever since.\n\nLightning Stripes and Paint Schemes\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups on April 28, 2006\n\nWay back on April 17, Dave Saums wrote:\n\nChris Faulk mentioned the credit to Mike Iden for the addition of a lightning stripe in the last C&NW diesel paint scheme.\n\nMike told me a couple years ago that his inspiration for the C&NW lightning stripe, and the later (and now-current) UP lightning stripe, was specifically his admiration for the NYC version.\n\nSpeaking of the UP version, the newest iteration was seen on several eastbounders and westbounders through Cheyenne these past weeks as Uncle Sam had me running all over southeastern Wyoming doing some magical tech things of which I cannot speak. But I did see lots and lots of trains. I don't take very many photos these days, but I did scramble a digital byte or two on a couple pure sets of brand new GEs. Those things are downright gorgeous, especially in packs of four. Building America, lightning stripes, yellow frame stripe, and wings, all in one place and still sticky fresh. Wow!\n\nGiving It All Away\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups on May 25, 2006\n\nDave Crammer wrote:\n\nI have on my hard drive a ton of articles I've written about the technical aspects of railroading. When someone asks a question that it pertinent to one of the articles I simply post the article. Why? Because it was written to pass on information. I've gotten to tour shops, ride with train crews, visit harbors and if I simply sit there with the information it does no one any good. If I pass it on it enhances other peoples experience of railroading. I will continue to follow this policy because when I started out I was helped in the same way by other people who passed on information.\n\nI, too, \"give it all away\". On my web site are edited versions (with updates and corrections) of my 28 articles, and the text from my 11 books, plus lots and lots of other stuff. I tend to shy away from posting any accompanying photos, but I do have some on-line photos. I only have one outlet now for my paper-published work, but, like Dave, my previous works have gotten me contacts that still amaze me. I am truly surprised at the number of people in the railroad (and now, railroad contracting) business who buy railfan books and magazines, and even more surprised when they recognize my name from something that has appeared in print. The current gaggle are the folks building our local commuter rail network, known formally as Salt Lake Commuter Rail Constructors. Apparently many are boomers in the railroad construction business and when they arrived here in Utah from all over the country, they went looking for Utah railroading info, and found my stuff.\n\nThe same goes for new arrivals with Uncle Pete; you know, the guys who keep the railroad running. Notably, they went looking via Google, not by visiting local hobby shops and bookstores. In-print stuff was dutifully procured, but only after an on-line search found the results, mostly from sites such as Karen's Books or Joe McMillan. This hobby is changing, or at least the sources of information are changing. The slow ones will cry about it and point fingers; the quick ones will adapt and continue on.\n\nOver the past 15 years, many people have willingly helped me, and they ask nothing in return, not even credit. I figure that the least I can do is share the results with other interested people. I'm in this to learn more about whatever subject may be at hand, and I share the results with whoever else is interested. It's nice that I can occasionally make some money, but that has never been the motivation.\n\nPosted to Observation Car at YahooGroups on June 18, 2006\n\nPDS wrote: \"Do *you* remember the first time you saw your byline in print (for a photo or a story) and how you felt? And does the feeling change after you've been published a few times?\"\n\nMy first time was as Trackside Editor for Don Dover's Extra 2200 South, back in 1973. Then again for the UP roster in X2200 in 1978/1979. The first \"real\" byline was in 1988 in Railroad Model Craftsman for my article about the Bamberger RS-1m. After that, they came kind of regular, with the last being last year for the second edition of Ogden Rails.\n\nSP Motive Power Annuals\n\nPosted on January 14, 2007\n\nI had purchased the SP 1968-69 annual way back in 1972, just before I started building my first UP roster while sitting at a typewriter in my Salt Lake City apartment. My parents had just moved to the Bay area, and my first trip to visit them in 1972 also resulted in my first Joe Strapac motive power annual. I missed out on the 1967-68 issue, but bought every one after that.\n\nI've started my first locomotive roster in 1972 with the local Kennecott Copper Corporation, but UP wasn't far behind. I learned roster building from one of the pros, Ken Ardinger, and he helped me tap into the Extra 2200 South gang, including Allen Copeland. In 1974, I discovered women, or as I may have mentioned before, one particular woman discovered me, so until I settled into a house in late 1976, the locomotive stuff got laid off for a couple years. When I came up for air and looked around, a phone call to Don Dover resulted in the five parter UP roster in X2200 in 1978-1979. I was working for UP until 1979, so roster data was easy to come by. The separation in 1979 was so bitter that it took at least five years to heal the wounds. A computer in 1986 brought back writing about history, and a 1988 phone call to George Cockle at UP in Omaha resulted in a restart of UP diesel roster building.\n\nWith each of the roster books I have been part of, I always lamented the weakness of keeping them up to date. So when the internet and web pages came along, I embraced them and learned how to wrestle them to do my will. After a total of seven UP roster books, each being an update of the last, I now do most of it on the web.\n\nAll this time, Joe's SP annuals remained as the standard to which I aspire. Photos are the meat of a roster book, and not being a photographer has always been a weakness in my efforts. I will always admire the depth and range of the photos Joe has been able to include in his books. That, and his ability to wrangle all those great photos to tell whatever story he is telling. Joe's first SP historic diesels books was my inspiration for a book about UP's switchers, but that book sold like a rock at a gravel pit. The poor sales of the first of a planned series about UP historic diesels made that one, the only one. UP simply is not SP. UP doesn't have the same loyal fans unless there's smoke coming out of the front end.\n\nOh well, I'll continue doing UP stuff until my head drops onto the keyboard. In the meantime, every SP book Joe does will automatically be added to my library. Keep up the good work Joe. You are still my inspiration.\n\nPrivate Databases\n\n(August 20, 2007)\n\nA mystery person named Ralph wrote to Bob Kreiger at the UPHS office in Cheyenne: \"I know I haven't attended a UP Convention in quite a while, but that doesn't mean I'm no longer interested. I continue to update and add data to my UP 100 year W/T roster database (10,000 records) and the All Time UP Passenger roster database over (9000 records).\"\n\nYet another private database. They always brag about the number of records. I guess he plans on having UPHS publish it but somehow I doubt it. I am most likely rushing to judgement here, but sorry to say, private databases are one of my hot buttons.\n\nAs with the many locomotive databases out there, they're never quite ready for publication, so any plans to publish are always on hold. Also, they don't want anyone to \"steal\" the data, due to all the work they have put into it. I really don't know why so many people think their private databases seem to have some sort of monetary value. I was that way until about 8 years ago [1999] when I realized the total lack of potential markets out there. At about the same time, I discovered that web pages make great \"first drafts\". Lots and lots of people help me out after they stumble on the web site, and I try to keep the updates flowing based on their input. Just the other day, the owner of several UP passenger cars sent the dates of movement and purchase.\n\nLucin, A Boat [Book Review]\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on October 20, 2007)\n\n(Book review published in Utah Historical Quarterly, Volume 69, Number 4, Fall 2001, page 360)\n\nTale of the Lucin: A Boat, a Railroad and the Great Salt Lake. By David Peterson. (Trinidad, California: Old Waterfront Publishing, 2001. 158 pp. Paper, $16.95)\n\nWhether we admit it or not, all of our lives are touched by the history of America's railroads, and it can be an unusual involvement with railroads and railroading that makes us each aware of that association. In the case of author David Peterson, who spent some of his formative years on the Pacific Ocean at Eureka, California, his story began with a boat, the oldest boat in the fleet at Eureka’s dockside.\n\nThis wonderful 158-page book tells the story of small boat that started its life in 1893 as a passenger launch on San Francisco Bay. Along the way, this book also tells the story of boats and shipping on Utah's Great Salt Lake, and the story of the completion of one of the greatest engineering feats of the Twentieth Century, the construction of Southern Pacific's Lucin Cutoff across this famous inland sea. In 1902 the boat was moved by Southern Pacific to the Great Salt Lake to help build the earth-fill and wooden trestle across the lake, becoming the first of a fleet of both large and small boats operated by the railroad on the lake.\n\nFor anyone interested in the Great Salt Lake, or railroads in Utah, this book is a must read. It begins with full review of the boats and shipping on Great Salt Lake, including the early explorers, and early attempts by Patrick Connor to use his steamer \"Kate Connor\" to ship mineral ores from Stockton on the south shore to Corrine on the newly completed railroad line on the north shore. Included is a review of the resorts and their excursion boats. The book makes excellent use of maps and photographs as visual aids.\n\nChapter Two relates the story of the construction of the railroad's Lucin Cutoff, beginning with the early engineering studies, and the 1900 decision to begin construction. The Lucin Cutoff was completed in 1904, and the author was able to complete extensive research, and successfully relates many aspects of the cutoff's difficult construction features. Intertwined are bits of how Southern Pacific's fleet of boats, specifically, the Lucin, did their part in the cutoff's construction. Especially well done are examples of the challenges of using earth fill to cross what was, and still is, a lake that has at its bottom a thin salt crust layer atop \"10,000 feet of mud.\" The delicate balance between the weight of the fill material, and the ability of the lake bottom to support the load is a battle that continues today.\n\nAdditional sub-chapters tell the stories of how the same construction crew, and their boats, built Southern Pacific's Dumbarton Cutoff across the southern part of San Francisco Bay, which was completed 1910. Under the heading of \"What's Next,\" the author presents material about the maintenance of the Lucin Cutoff, and its complete replacement in 1959 with an all-earth fill. This new fill also used a fleet of boats, and these later sub-chapters relate the modern methods of moving massive amounts of fill through the use of large tugs and barges. Later sub-chapters bring the reader up to date with the subsequent removal-from-service of the original wooden trestle, and the reclamation of its virgin-growth redwood lumber.\n\nAn interlude chapter does an excellent job at what the author calls biographies of all the San Francisco Bay launches that served on Great Salt Lake. In it are histories of the individual boats that Southern Pacific moved to and from the bay area to Utah.\n\nA final chapter returns to the later history of the boat Lucin, the survivor. This little boat was returned to San Francisco Bay with the completion of its namesake cutoff in 1904. The chapter contains numerous details of how the boat was converted from its original passenger launch configuration to a more utilitarian tug configuration. Its use on the bay ended with its sale, and movement in 1917 to Portland, Oregon, for service at the mouth of the Columbia River. In 1937, the tug was sold for its powerful gasoline engine, and in 1939 the hull was sold and converted from a medium-draft tug to a deep-draft fishing boat. This reviewer will leave the story of the boat’s final years to prospective readers to discover with their own reading of this most enjoyable book. The book ends with a note from the author seeking additional information, and a full bibliography that relates the author's journey for research for anyone who might want to follow in his path. A full index is also included.\n\nIn his prologue, the author states, \"History does not neatly divide into separate topics and periods; it is a complex weave of all that has ever passed.\" Nothing confirms this statement better than this book. While it is the story, or rather a tale, of a boat, it is also the story a railroad and the Great Salt Lake, and of man's crossing of the lake. There is no better history than history placed in context, which this book does very well.\n\nPublishing, Other Options\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on January 12, 2008)\n\nLike others, I have been contacted by Arcadia, and after a couple phone calls, they sent me their author guidelines. A review of the guidelines made it obvious that I wouldn't be making anything more than a good meal at a fast food restaurant. They make all the money, but...\n\n...maybe making money isn't my purpose. In most cases my motivation has always been to simply share my research. Having my own web site works great for that. In other cases, the subject requires photographs, so I've had to pimp myself to a publisher so that they can add the needed photos, but the costs of that (both real and emotional) have nearly undone me several times.\n\nIn my case, the subject of Arcadia's interest is my work concerning the railroads of Bingham Canyon here in Utah. I've got hundreds of photos (most are 8x10 negatives), and have access to lots more. Their guidelines show that I provide all the scans, and all the words, in their format.\n\nThis means that, as others have said, I do all the work and they get the money. But the benefit is that my book will get promoted and distributed. A friend in the railfan publishing field has mentioned that I should look at this like \"chumming the waters,\" hoping that doing an Arcadia book could lead to more photos and \"memories\" that could end up in a much bigger (and more scholarly) book later, with larger photos and good maps.\n\nWith my current skills, I could easily write all the words, and scan all the photos. From comments I have seen on a couple forums, it would be best to provide Arcadia with minimal words and clearly identified photo locations, due to Arcadia's editing methods. Since all the work is then done, I'm thinking, why not simply do a web page, with an associated photo album?\n\nThe difference is distribution and market. An Arcadia book would be put into people's hands via local bookstores and gift shops, and would likely reach an audience that a web page never would. But a web page has a potential worldwide audience. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection, and a web search site, will likely find my web page (as they do today, with over 1500 hits per day). I guess it all depends on which market we are chasing. And I still can't decide what to do. I'll wait until all the photos are scanned, maybe sometime this year, to make that decision.\n\nDoing an Arcadia book was a good experience for me, but I went into the project fully understanding what was involved. I knew that I would have to do all my own writing and fact checking, and with their limitation of more than 50 words, and no less than 70 words for each caption, it was a good exercise in writing. I did my own layout, which included creating a dummy version for photo placement. I was assigned three different editors during the six months or so that the book was in preparation, so continuity was a problem. I did all of my own scanning and image sizing (5x8 inches, at 350 ppi), which worked out very well. The dead line was the end of January 2011, and it was finished and sent to booksellers on August 1, 2011, as planned and promised.\n\nIn response to the above words, a suggestion was made that I look into on-demand, self-publishing, via something like Amazon's Kindle.\n\nIn response I say that they were assuming that everyone interested has a computer, or worse, that they even know how to use one.\n\nI have found that a surprising percentage of people interested in the history of industrial technology (railroads, mining, etc.) tend to shun using a computer for little else other than email, if that. That fact may be changing, as those persons either die, or become more technically savvy, but they are a significant part of the market, whether I make any money off of them, or not.\n\nMichael Seitz writes that \"the bigger hazard of a purely on-line distribution is the obsolescence factor and archival longevity of digital data. What if the device is damaged or lost? If you want your research to remain accessible to a larger portion of the reading public, then you really should consider hard-copy publication. How many folks can access 3.5\" floppies, or documents stored on old hard drives of obsolete computers?\n\nHe adds that when his \"local newsletter went from hard copy to digital distribution, I found I hardly looked at the thing after initial receipt. There are other things I have downloaded that I do refer to, but all are one hard drive crash away from oblivion, or I will need to burn back up copies of the information on the media of the day.\n\n\"Why not both? Web for control and continual updating, and the book for long term information preservation?\"\n\nI agree completely, Michael.\n\nAs for the long-term reliability of digital technology, I can certainly attest that your hard drive *will* fail. Make your backups now!\n\nRailroad Records\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on February 5, 2008)\n\nWhile Union Pacific's records for its cabooses and other rolling equipment show retirement dates up to the late 1970s, the records after that time are spotty and mostly incomplete, especially for sales. It was at about this time that Union Pacific began using a central computer for all record keeping. Most of the caboose donations were recorded, at least up to about 1995. After that time, records are mostly nonexistent.\n\nThe fact that UP's own equipment records are so incomplete is sad but true. In these days of no government regulation, and focus on increasing shareholder value, costs at headquarters have been severely cut, and the most expensive cost is labor, especially having clerks record and maintain information that the government no longer requires (car ownership and usage). Cars and locomotives are merely assets to be bought and disposed of, kind of like the little car that the guy at the pizza place drives; when he needs a new one, he simply goes and gets the cheapest one he can get, and does not need to answer to anybody.\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration still requires the air brake information to be recorded on the blue card in the locomotives, but only for the most minimal of safety reasons. The original blue card is in the locomotive cab, and a copy of the blue card is kept in Omaha, but there really is no hard emphasis to get the previous ownership right, or to get the date information correct. There is no penalty from the FRA if the information is found to be wrong, except for a minor slap-on-the-wrist of a one-time $250 fine. It's easy on the new stuff, but the leased stuff and stuff from merger partners generally falls by the wayside. And there is none of this safety requirement on cabooses after the 1989 decision by the Supreme Court that found that states could no longer require cabooses on all trains.\n\nGetting information about railroad equipment is very hard these days. It is amazing how many records have simply been destroyed. They take up space (that needs to be paid for), and there is only the most minimal government requirement for them in the first place.\n\nAlmost everything we know about Union Pacific from 1914 to about 1995 comes from the railroad's records that it kept to fulfill the ICC requirement for valuation of its assets. The ICC went away in January 1996, and with it went the history of railroading after that date. UP has disposed of almost everything prior to the magic seven years of required records retention, and they are very focused on that constantly moving date. Now, seven years later, anything before 1996 is gone. I have seen many, many boxes with this notation: \"Throw away after [some date]\" with the exact date being seven years after the record was initially boxed up and kept.\n\nTo return to the subject of cabooses; I have copies of records up to 1995 (retirements and donations, but sadly, no sales). After 1995, there are simply no records available, other than whatever some individual clerk may have kept at their own desk, or in their own files, to make their own everyday job easier. As these people have retired (and many have, with several buyouts having been offered), either the person themselves threw the stuff away as they left, or the railroad disposed of it to clean out the person's desk and files. I have gotten to know several clerks over the years, and they all have horror stories about missing records since 1995.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It means that current and future historians are in for a rough haul.\n\nEnd of the D&RGW\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on July 26, 2008)\n\nSteve Seguine wrote on March 8, 2002:\n\nI find 1988 a convenient end of the Rio Grande, because it was then that it officially became the SP. It has taken years for the SP and UP to erase the spirit of the D&RGW and soon that will be all gone.\n\nThe spirit of the Rio Grande will continue to live as long as people remember it. That's the purpose of a historical society. The equipment that was painted in D&RGW colors may be long-painted to another paint scheme, but we can all remember what is underneath it all, next to bare metal. Don't get sappy about it, but don't forget either. One benchmark most fallen flag historical societies use for their coverage of any particular railroad, is if the property still exists, i.e., the roadbed and trackage where the trains ran. I suspect that UP will be using former D&RGW trackage for quite some time.\n\nAs to dates, the DRGW reporting mark was transferred to UP on June 30, 1997. This is the same date that all existing equipment ownership and leases were also transferred to UP. The D&RGW corporate existence went away also on the same day. D&RGW never merged with SP, it was only controlled by SP on October 13, 1988 (actually, D&RGW's parent company is the one that took control of SP, and SP, in-turn, took control of D&RGW). The same goes for UP and D&RGW. September 11, 1996 was the day that UP controlled D&RGW, along with SP, SSW, and SPCSL.\n\nBut, don't worry about the dates, or the company. It's the railroad we want to remember. The spirit of the Rio Grande is different for everyone, and we really should not be arguing amongst ourselves about when D&RGW ended.\n\nI personally caught the spirit in 1964, when I spent an afternoon riding my bike along side a yellow stripe EMD GP locomotive on the Sugar House Local as it switched all the various spurs between Roper and Sugar House. The crew was very nice to a bike-riding 13-year-old kid, and explained all sorts of things about railroad operations. I was hooked, and as they say, the rest is history.\n\n(The other memory is that I completely filled my bike's tires with sticker weeds, and had to walk it five miles home on two very flat tires.)\n\nRailfans\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on July 26, 2008)\n\nIn response to several comments in a railroading forum about railroaders and drugs, a fellow railroad enthusiast named \"Wadsworth\" wrote on July 8, 2006:\n\nThe only reason Jerry Garcia used train & cocaine in that song is because it rhymed. It's not an anthem to professional railroaders. Your feeble attempt to connect the two is a slap in the face to professional railroaders. And you guys wonder why railroaders can't stand foamers -- sheesh!!\n\nI've been banging around this hobby for over 40 years, including working for Union Pacific for ten of those. I've come to know numerous professional railroaders who have a deep appreciation of their industry, well beyond it simply being a job to them. Many take photos, lots of photos, and read all the various railfan publications.\n\nBut, I have yet to meet a railroader who respects railfans as a group. Over the years I've known a couple national railfan magazine editors, who often meet professional railroaders at various symposiums and conferences. They tell of similar experiences in the battle between railfans and railroaders.\n\nI'm a bit embarrassed to admit that while at UP (almost thirty years ago), on one or two occasions I mentioned to a visiting \"railfan\", a couple bits a really silly information, just for the entertainment value. I recall one instance back in the early 1970s when I mentioned that I had just seen a Big Boy pass though town. The response was a bit frantic as the guy promptly set out on the grand chase. I know of other professional railroaders who admit to the same thing. Railfans can be, at times, amazingly gullible.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, professional railroaders can be amazingly dense about anything other than their own immediate job activities.\n\nSome of the worst are the few railfans who are also professional railroaders. These guys want to be seen as some sort of expert; a big fish in a small pond. They share information that they have access to through their jobs, and get all upset and defensive when someone applies common sense to the information's validity. I have learned on many occasions that, unfortunately, not every bit of information from a railroad employee is pure, or totally complete and accurate. This is free country, and you can say almost anything that tickles your fancy, but these guys should give consideration to the shrill and silly nature of their defensive responses. They likely want to be seen as professionals, not realizing that their responses prove otherwise.\n\nRailroaders and railfans do not mix very well. Mostly because railroaders think railfans are a bunch of idiots. Unfortunately, there are a few railfans who continue to prove that statement. I know one railroader who calls them \"fidiots\". And another who calls them \"vesties\".\n\nThe worst example of a railfan is the guy who uses only \"gossip\" from fellow railfans, including today's internet newsgroups, as his only source of information, without applying any sense of real-world logic, or business sense to what he may hear or read. I've seen guys who get tears in their eyes when they talk about UP 844. Like Wadsworth said, \"Sheesh!\" I always try to remember that this is just a hobby. It's what I do in my spare time.\n\nAs for myself, I like trains, I like railroads, and I like Union Pacific. I know enough to respect their business decisions, but I also like to simply watch their trains. And I like to research and write about railroad locomotives, UP history, and my local railroads and their history. But I describe myself as a railroad historian, not as a railfan, and definitely not as a rail buff.\n\nLocal Museums\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on November 15, 2008)\n\nSorry to say, I've never been much of a preservationist, other than photos and books. I have found that too many people get wrapped up in keeping for all time and forever, their mother's wedding dress, or Uncle Wilbur's family bible, or Aunt Wilma's dress from when she was baptized.\n\nToo much attention is paid to keeping the \"one-only\" stuff, rather than the every day stuff used by people to get through each and every day. The worst I've seen is at Daughters of Utah Pioneers, and at the Union Pacific museum in Omaha. Most of the stuff is insignificant junk that the museums dare not throw away because it was a gift.\n\nI've been to many local museums that have one too many washboards and butter churns, or three gold watches, and seventeen different gold buttons. Obviously, I'm not a fan of local museums, so I'm not the person to ask for an encouraging word. But yet, I visit them at every opportunity.\n\nMy interest is the history of industrial development in Utah, with a focus on railroad-related industries. I continue to be hopeful when I do go to a local museum, hoping for old photos of what the world looked like back then. The best have been in Crockett, California, with its great stuff about the C&H sugar factory there, and the museum in Helper, Utah. Both are wonderful places to visit, but I'm sure there are several more. A recent trip through Torrington, Wyoming included another very good local museum.\n\nSteam Locomotive Specifications\n\nA fellow researcher wrote on February 8, 2009: \"I have found that understanding how equipment was actually used leads to much understanding as to why it was purchased and later modified.\"\n\nI responded: So true. The work comes from learning the context in which the equipment is used. Where? When? Why?\n\nAll the steam roster guys dutifully record the \"specifications\" of a steam locomotive: driver, cylinders, engine weight, boiler pressure, and tractive force. But apparently they fail to ask why. During the 1880s, 1890s and the pre-Harriman years, UP changed driving wheel size of almost all the 4-4-0s and 4-6-0s, either smaller or larger. But try to find out why. Speed? Power? Maintainability? Dunno. Harriman's team apparently did not believe in the concept. They simply bought all-new instead. Very little rebuilding in the Common Standard era, except changing all the 2-8-0 and 4-6-0 Vauclain Compounds to simpled locomotives.\n\nLocal History\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on March 28, 2009)\n\nI've been asked for my thoughts about compiling the book with local history as its subject. Like any other project, you will have to decide what story you want to tell. No publisher will touch an \"all-time\", definitive history. So the challenge is the compromise that the author is willing to live with.\n\nThis is precisely why I do web pages. I'm in complete control, with no publisher breathing down my neck about page count and always trying to reduce costs. Plus there is no fear of a lack of promotion. Any good internet search engine will find a web site.\n\nIn my case I will always consider the Ogden Rails project incomplete. But there comes a time when you have to move on. I'd love to do a \"Salt Lake City Rails\" book, or a full history of Brigham Young and the railroads. But in reality, I doubt that such projects will ever see publication, other than in the form of loosely associated web pages.\n\nAbout doing a local history book: maybe a simple update of a previously published project might be good enough, such as my personal favorite, Ira Swett's \"Interurbans of Utah\", but with more and bigger photos, and good maps. Doing day-to-day newspaper research almost always adds new information, but can be incredibly boring and time consuming. At some point you will have to ask yourself, \"will it really add to the story I want to tell?\"\n\nAs words of encouragement, continue gathering data, photos, and maps. At some point, you will have to decide what exactly you want to say. Hopefully that decision will come sooner rather than later, and you won't pass from this world and leave your family with the decision as to what to do with all of your research.\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on April 26, 2009)\n\nHistory as pure dates is boring to many. But dates are the skeleton of history.\n\nIf you have your dates wrong, then any history based on those dates will be seen as lopsided and unsupported. This includes any history of equipment, of operations, or even social and cultural histories that seem to be in vogue today.\n\nHistory in context brings the past alive.\n\nHistory and Web Sites Are Fragile\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on April 26, 2009)\n\nIn June 2006, Ken Clark wrote:\n\nThe problem is that the records are fast disappearing. Twenty five years ago we had a lot of records that were 25 years old, now we can't find or read files that are three years old.\n\nIn my recent visit to UP at Omaha, I was more than surprised to learn that UP themselves cannot access equipment records from the mid 1980s, and through to the time of my visit in 1995. It was during the mid 1980s that UP computerized their record keeping. I discussed this with several contacts within the company, and learned that they accept the new reality, along with the fact that if an employee did not print the report out, and keep it in his personal stash, the record is likely not available. Also, now that the ICC no longer exists, with its requirements for volumes and volumes of retained records, the railroads simply don't retain the depth and range of records that they did previously. Also, one of the \"buried-in-the-minutiae\" parts of the 1980 Staggers act was the reduction in reporting required by the railroads, and less reporting meant less records retention.\n\nKen continued:\n\nOne author who contacted me brought up a more troubling issue, that of the relative fragility of the web site. Many have not had the staying power of the hard bound volume. What happens upon the maintainer's death? or the internet host quits? Dead links abound. Will historical societies provide secure host space and maybe digital backups to ensure that the information is not lost? At this time I think the digital media has proven more fragile than the printed medium. It requires continual renewal onto current technology to avoid rapid obsolescence.\n\nWhen I realized just how fragile web sites are, I determined to generate web pages that conform to current standards of future compatibility. All my web pages are fully compliant with XHTML standards, meaning mostly that they are simple text with formatting being handled by separate style sheets. I use PHP server-side includes so that I don't need to worry about keeping the formatting of every page perfectly up to date. No glitz. Each and every page is all about just the content.\n\nI'm a great believer in open source, public web sites, such as Wikipedia, the free on-line encyclopedia. They have over 200,000 articles, supposedly more than Encyclopedia Britannica and Encarta combined. For us railroaders, there is a remarkable range of railroad-related subjects. The editors take their (volunteer) jobs very seriously and strive to the most accurate information available. But their weakness is similar to any author's weakness; you can't use a source if you don't know of its existence.\n\nThe information at Wikipedia is always suspect, as is information in any printed source. But Wikipedia is fully editable by any registered user, with a full history shown of all changes. Wikipedia makes good use of peer review, much like academic research. Peer review is something our railroad writing could certainly use more of, but I have learned that there is a definite shortage of peers in the subjects I write about.\n\nI determined years ago that railroad publishing to paper has a severe limitation. The potential market is astronomically small (1000 to 1500 books), therefore the economics of such a small market severely limit both the size and content of the published work, and the promotion and advertising of newly released, or still available, books. I figured this out at about the same time that Google became available as the web's premier search engine. From then on, I decided to make my research readily available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection. The hard part, a difficulty also shared by commercial interests on the web, is to get the search engines to find your web site through a simple key word search.\n\nMy first Wiki edit was for Cooper bridge loadings. Some recent research about the weight limitations of the Salt Lake trestle brought a private email that mentioned the bridge loading standards known as Cooper loadings, with its axle loading standards, of which E-70 is an example. I did a search on Cooper loadings, along with the engineer who developed them, Theodore Cooper, and was a bit surprised that neither Google nor Wikipedia had any reference to this basic facet of railroad engineering. There is an article about Cooper, the man, but it makes no mention of the bridge loading standards named for him. Oh well, yet another subject to be researched and developed. Life goes on, and every work is a work in progress...\n\nMetallic Smokebox Color\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on April 26, 2009)\n\nIn October 2006, Harry Wong wrote on the Espee List:\n\n...had a darker shade of metallic on the smokebox.\n\nThis brings to mind my experience as a boilermaker apprentice back in 1971. I was an active modeler at the time (Denver & Salt Lake), and we were re-tubing the boilers in UP's huge power plant in Salt Lake City. These were massive water tube boilers, three in a row and three stories tall.\n\nMy journeyman was Glen Rice. One day he had me mix up what he called graphite paint. It was about a half gallon of some thick valve oil (a bit darker than your typical motor oil for automobiles), into which I mixed an equal measure of powered graphite. I then brushed it on an exposed part of the upper tube sheet. The heat took care of the oil in a couple hours, leaving behind a durable graphite coating as form of corrosion control. The next day, it was exactly the same color as Floquil's then-Graphite color that I took with me to work to compare.\n\nI have since learned that what we modelers know as silver paint is actually aluminum paint, or aluminum powder in a carrier solvent. I have also learned that aluminum paint came about as a replacement for aluminum leaf, which itself was a cheaper version of silver leaf in lettering. Aluminum paint was so cheap and so durable in high heat situations, that many railroads began using it in lots of applications. It wears very well, but also oxidizes pretty fast.\n\nAsking Questions\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on April 27, 2009)\n\nAn anonymous stranger wrote in June 2006:\n\nI cannot believe how mean spirited the responses to a simple question have been. Many of us (myself included) live on a limited income and cannot afford the spend $50.00 or more on books.\n\nJeff Cauthen wrote in June 2006:\n\nI'm sick of this \"limited income\" crap. WE'RE all on limited incomes. Buy a book, it won't kill you!\n\nI have been able to get an amazing variety of books through my local county library. It may take a while, but you, too, might be surprised as to what's available through interlibrary loan. At no charge, so the \"limited income\" argument has nothing to stand on.\n\nBut I can understand Jeff's frustration. I suspect the question asking for a detailed list of Cab Forwards that operated in northern California and southern Oregon was simply ill-considered about the depth and range of possible answers, but Jeff's words could have come from any of the 30+ authors that I know.\n\nThere are times that we authors get real tired of answering basic questions that we have all written about many times (kind of like a doctor being asked medical questions at a party). Why oh why don't people read the books and magazines they buy. By far, most railroad books are sold for the photographs, with most buyers simply flipping through a new book and putting it proudly on the shelf.\n\nAs for asking simple questions, it's a whole lot easier to simply tap a question on the computer keyboard, than it is to spend a couple hours reading various printed sources. A good comparison would be a conversation on a street corner, which is what I consider all of these discussion groups to be. Two people are talking, and one of them will ask the other a question.\n\nI run a very large web site, with over 1500 pages. It has a \"Contact Me\" feature. Anyone would be amazed at the variety and range of questions that get thrown my way. Most are pretty senseless, like a recent one, \"Can you tell me about my Grandfather Hector Holmes, who I think worked for a railroad in Colorado?\" This to a web site that is clearly marked UtahRails.\n\nBut every now and again, a question comes in that makes it all worth while. Or, even better, an offer to send along some item of interest, such as an extended correspondence with the son of Martin Blomberg, a design engineer at Pullman-Standard, and later at EMC/EMD almost from Day One.\n\nThe good questions force me to think about what I may, or may not know. The good questions make it all worth while. I love doing research, and I enjoy sharing the results of my research, but please, do a little basic research before asking your question.\n\nThe Truth Is Out There\n\n(First published to the UtahRails.net blog on Blogspot on November 1, 2009)\n\nLike everything on the internet, YouTube has some crap, and some great, funny and well done stuff. One recently viewed example is that all of the Super Bowl commercials are on YouTube, as well as lots of other clips of this and that, and even some other stuff. Whatever you want, even soft porn, and dumb ass guys doing stupid things.\n\nFor a place to start, click at the bottom \"Browse Channels\", then pick \"Best Of YouTube\".\n\n(Videos Popular On You Tube)\n\nHere is another example of why I like YouTube:\n\n(Reporters Blow Whistle on FOX News)\n\nThe truth is out there. We just have to find it. And the internet makes that a bit easier. Stuff like this is why \"they\" are always warning us about the dangers of the internet. \"Dangers\" indeed -- the truth always hurts. The people with an agenda hate that so many people have video cameras and cell phone cameras, and an internet connection.\n\nAs a historian, all I ever want to find is what really happened. Every time I get going on research on just about any subject, I soon learn that it is usually one person's personal agenda that drives any particular event, throughout history. And everyone around them either agrees with that agenda, or goes along in the interest of avoiding confrontation, or keeping their job. Peel away the layers of history, and it's always about money and power. \"You will do what I want you to do, because I think it's a good idea.\"\n\nConservatives want to limit your choices to what they think is good and right. Liberals want to offer you so many choices that nothing gets done, because in life's choices, nothing is easy.\n\nThe best we can ever hope to do is EDUCATE OURSELVES, make the decision and hope for the best. My favorite defense comes from Steve McQueen's character in the movie The Magnificent Seven when he said, \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\n\nSP Locomotive Records\n\n(January 8, 2010)\n\nAs strange as it may seem in this day of computers and digital records, when SP was taken over by Rio Grande in 1988, their record keeping went out the window. Then when the ICC went away in 1996, they truly had no reason to stay on top of the records of their locomotive fleet, and they actually threw away boxes and boxes of records that had been carefully packed and moved from San Francisco to Denver when the headquarters moved.\n\nThe retirements and sales in the 1990 to 1996 time period were all pretty much unrecorded, so with the help of a couple ex-SP guys who stayed with UP, and who had the sense to keep their paper records, we put together a pretty good picture of SP's diesel fleet up to the merger with UP. It was a bear to figure out, but we got it done and the results were published in the 1998 UP Locomotive Directory. Joe Strapac used much of the pre-1996 stuff for his later books. All of it is preserved and presented on UtahRails.net.\n\nShoving Cars\n\n(Posted to Trainorders.com on October 10, 2010.)\n\nIn the General Code for Operating Practice for railroad safety, Rule 6.5 states: \"When cars or engines are shoved and conditions require, a crew memb"
