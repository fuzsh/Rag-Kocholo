Since we're feeling good (and thanks to stylesheets... well mostly due to style sheets) you can see all the content on this page in black and white. Enjoy!\n\nSetting up an Egroup\n\nSince egroups is a free service on yahoo, it is a simple matter of signing up for a free account with Yahoo to get access to egroups. This application note will not detail how to get a Yahoo account.\n\nGo to http://www.groups.yahoo.com/ or http://www.yahoo.com/ and click the 'groups' link.\n\nIf you have a Yahoo account skip this step and move on click on the \"Sign Me Up\" and follow the instructions on the screen\n\nLog-in\n\nClick on the link to Create a New Group\n\nFill in the name of your group (i.e. 2002EE552) with an appropriate description (You can put this group in any category you think is appropriate)\n\nInvite the other members of your project group to join the egroup through the 'Invite' link\n\nNote: Member may join the group by replying to the e-mail but will only be able to send and receive e-mails to and from the group. He or she won't be able to access the files until she or he has a Yahoo account.\n\nPlease e-mail Dan (daniel.tse@ualberta.ca) if you have any questions about this application note."
