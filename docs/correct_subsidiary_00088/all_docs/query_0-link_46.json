        "text": "Thomas Hawk says:\n\nahhhh, but will Picasa get a Flickr Commercial API in order to allow us to import our photos and tags directly into it like we can with tabblo. Somehow I doubt it.\n\nI'd like to try Picasa and probably will shortly. I try most photo sharing sites and have thousands of my images up at Webshots, Riya, Zooomr, Vizrea, tabblo, etc. along with Flickr. But lately something has been bothering me. I'm investing many, many hours carefully documenting the metadata on my images (tags) but I'm increasingly becoming concerned that this data doesn't belong to me.\n\nI see the longer term answer coming from Microsoft who will allow you to tag your photos directly on your hard drive coming up in Vista. I'd assume that Flickr and other photosharing sites will begin to automatically read this metadata from the source file, rather than make you re-enter the data a second time. But this doesn't make me feel entirely comfortable about the many hours that I've spent tagging my photos on flickr. I really do kind of see this labor as belonging to me more than it belongs to flickr.\n\nWhat, if any, provisions is Flickr making (or should they be making) to ensure that the metadata that I build with my images is portable and can be imported and exported as I wish.\n\nI was thinking about this specifically because as I mentioned above I do want my images indexed for search at Google and I do suspect that having them all in Picasa will help me with that. I do not relish having to respend the countless hours though retagging all of my images all over again a second time. The more I think about this the more important I think that this is going to become for me. Maybe this won't affect the causual user who doesn't tag much anyway and sure I can use downloadr to get all of my images back if I want them (although in my case this is not necessary as I keep all of my originals on hard drive). But for those of us who are taking tagging seriously and in some aspects contributing the very most to flickr, don't we deserve to have our metadata made portable. We did the vast majority of the work to get it where it is today.\n\nShould I be denied the ability to export my metadata to Picasa just because Google is a competitor to Yahoo?\n\nages ago\n\nStewart says:\n\nThomas Hawk: \"... but I'm increasingly becoming concerned that this data doesn't belong to me.\" & \"I really do kind of see this labor as belonging to me more than it belongs to flickr\" & \"Should I be denied the ability to export my metadata to Picasa just because Google is a competitor to Yahoo?\"\n\nYour position strikes me as a little disingenuous. I know you know that we have an API (you even mention it at the top of your comment). We support tens of millions of API calls a day at no charge**. We spend a huge amount of time defending the rights of users, dealing with policy issues, explaining copyright laws, building technology to safeguard users' rights, etc. We take it extremely seriously.\n\nNowadays, many online services offer APIs as a matter of course, but when we released ours in 2004 that was not the case (note that even now, none of the other services you mention have an API, except Zooomr's partial support of the Flickr API). Why the suspicions of us then? Like, we've been playing along for years, but it's all been an extended ploy we're somehow about to screw you? We've been extremely open and we have no problem with people building tools to export their data from Flickr (there are several already). There is no lock in.\n\nWith respect to granting a commercial API license to a direct competitor: we might not. It kind of depends on the specific product, any relationship we have with them, whether we complement each other or not, etc. In the case of a truly direct competitor (and, so far, we have very few), we probably wouldn't. And I don't see that as malicious on our part: why should we burn bandwidth and CPU cycles sending stuff directly to their servers?\n\nIf a user developed it for their own purposes and distributed it, no problem. If they imported what the various Flickr exporting tools produced, no problem. We'd never go out of our way to block them -- we just wouldn't go out of our way to help them.\n\nAnd here's the thing: back when we first started, we got asked to develop tools to bring in people's photos in from other sites (notably Buzznet, which started before us, was larger, and was popular for cameraphone users). We actually developed a tool to do that, but never released it. Why? Because it just seemed ... lame, and mean, and competitive in a bad way, at least if we did it ourselves. (If the market develops a solution on its own,again, no problem.)\n\nFinally, re PicasaWeb: if Google requests a commercial API key from us, we'd consider it. But I wouldn't hold your breath on them asking us ;) On the flip side, for the last two years, hundreds (at least - probably thousands) of Picasa users have asked for a way to post directly from Picasa to Flickr (see the Picasa group on Google groups, the old Picasa forums, the Picasa group on Flickr, etc.) And that never happened, even when Picasa had no online component and even before we were acquired by Yahoo! But, eh ... you never know.\n\n** We have commercial relationships with some users of the API, and they do pay us. This represents a small fraction of a percent of API use. In the future, we intend to make a self-serve commercial API program.\n\n[edited to fix runaway italics]\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nStewart (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nStewart, my concern is at the user level. If I spend hours and hours tagging my photos in flickr this data is not at present able to be exported to the best of my knowledge. It is essentially locked into flickr.\n\nI've talked a lot about search in the past. I'd like my photos indexed for search. My past experience has been that photos that I've uploaded via Picasa get indexed really, really well for search at Google. Several of my Picasa uploaded images are on the first page search results for many terms on Google Image Search. A while back Choice Hotels found one of my photos via Google Image Search and paid me $500 to use it in a television commercial. For me that was kind of cool. I'm interested at the hobbyist level right now in opportunities like that. This is not my primary reason for posting to flickr but I think that there are a lot of us here that wouldn't mind the attention and possible opportunity from external search engines.\n\nMy Flickr Images by contrast fail to register significantly on either Google Image Search or Yahoo Image Search, or Image Search anywhere outside of Flickr. And so maybe Flickr doesn't want their images indexed, I don't know. But if I want to have my images indexed I think my tags will help Google better read the images in Picasa. But they are not my tags. They are flickr's tags. And the only site I've seen where I've been able to export them directly too is tabblo. I can't export them to Picasa, I can't export them to Zooomr, I can't export them to WebShots, I can't export them to Riya. I can't export them to Google Base where I suspect Google might index from most of all.\n\nAnd while I appreciate flickr's stance towards ensuring that content owners own their content and a supportive environment that you speak of above, even as flickr too benefits, I'm not suspicious just frustrated.\n\nI kind of feel like I was the one who took all of the time to meticulously tag my photos. I contribute heavily towards photos of flickr. Even beyond my own tags I tag a lot more photos than others tag mine -- because I think the metadata is cool and useful and fucntional.\n\nBut it seems to me like it's only functional to me within the confines of flickr. And I guess like my photos, my tags feel like they kind of belong to me. I'm sure in a legal sense they don't but since I did the majority of the work tagging them it just feels this way. I've got 5,600+ photos or so on Flickr and add new ones every day. I'd like to get it to 100,000 someday.\n\nObviously photos and tags can be transferred to other sites. Tabblo already an example of that. And I already transferred all of my photos and tags from Tabblo pretty much the day they launched. That seemed really cool to me. Do I spend much time on Tabblo? No. I've got two tabblos and that's it. Because it's nowhere near as cool as flickr. But I sure wouldn't mind having all my photos sitting in Picasa indexed highly by Google for search. And this I can't do today. So I'm frustrated.\n\nAnd I'm thinking about trying to, in fact, put something together as we speak, in the stock business. It may be pie in the sky stuff right now but I'd like to figure out a way for talented amateurs to monetize their libraries of images. For the non-pro photorapher I'd like to figure out a way where an on ramp to a career in photography can be built. A sort of transitionary agency between part time talented amateur work and full time stock or fine art work. Tag search would be critical to this. If I could figure this idea out and somehow create a business around it search and keyword tagging would play a critical role.\n\n\"On the flip side, for the last two years, hundreds (at least - probably thousands) of Picasa users have asked for a way to post directly from Picasa to Flickr\"\n\nAnd I think I'd be just as critical of Picasa for this as I feel about Flickr right now. But you're right. Probalby all that bullshit about Google doing no evil is just that bullshit. Google too is a business and they probably want to lock their users in. So I probably shouldn't hold my breath there either.\n\nThe problem is probably of my own making because I probably should have been tagging at the IPTC header level instead of on Flickr in the first place as has been suggested above. Vista will make it far easier to tag photos this way from the betas that I've played with.\n\n\"building tools to export their data from Flickr (there are several already).\"\n\nBut not to export tagged photos that I'm aware of. But I might be wrong about this and this is good to hear. Unfortunately I have zero programming skills but it's nice to know that the possibility might exist that someone else could build such a tool someday.\n\nages ago\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nUtata threads can't be viewed by non-utata members, Thomas.\n\nOops, sorry about that. Here's my business plan cut and pasted from the Utata thread. The thread by the way is by Catherine Jamieson is entitled \"Who Sells or Wants to Sell their Work.\"\n\nI've been shooting freelance stuff for San Francisco Magazine for the past 5 months or so. They actually are putting one of my photos on the cover in their big Best of San Francisco issue. And I've been making some money through that.\n\nI'm extremely interested in building a company or agency or whatever that caters to the pro/am and helps them market their images. I've been interviewing with people about this and doing mostly research at this point but the way I see it there are a lot of ways that pro/am photographers can make money with their work.\n\n1. Sell prints. I've been talking with some folks that would do all the framing/matting/shipping/mailing etc. The idea would be that people pull down your images and then can buy prints. It would be up to the artist as to how they were sold, limited edition, unlimited, size, format etc. The key though would be to make it super easy for the artist. They in fact would have to do nothing except post their images and maybe sign limited edition prints.\n\n2. Sell stock photography. I think that there is a sweet spot between the Getty Images/Corbis of the world and the almost freebie stuff at iStockphoto. I think sellling stock in a more simplified manner at maybe $100-$400 per image would have a lot of appeal to marketers.\n\n3. Get freelance work for photographers. The idea here would be to play matchmaker. Lots of publications are looking for specific assignment work. They could post an assignment and then local photographers could offer to shoot. Let's say there were three photographers willing to go do a shoot for money, the publication could then look at the three and pick one. Even thiings like weddings, shooting kids, etc. Kind of like a Craig'slist for photography but where buyers could actually see the work of the person that they might hire.\n\n4. Possibly open a real life actual physical gallery in San Francisco. You could showcase your member's work on there. Assuming a retail strategy could work and could be succesful consider expanding these types of galleries in other cities. These galleries might also be set up to serve beer and wine and they could be used as places for flickr meetups, other tech meetups, etc. There are two galleries like this in San Francisco now, 111 Minna and Varnish. I don't know about the economics of this side of the business though. I've been talking with SeenyaRita about something like this as well. It would be super cool to have a place to hang out for photographers and flickr users.\n\n5. Build photoblog templates for your members that they could use to customize their work. These templates would direct people back to the main site to buy work and could also contain advertisments if a user desired where they could earn ad revenue.\n\nMy thoughts would be to use a site like this to provide either an onramp for the hobbyist to ramp up and turn pro over time or simply as a place for the person that can't leave their full time job etc. to make some extra money with their passion, photography.\n\nThe idea would be to let users choose modules if they wanted. They could for instance sell prints and not stock or vice versa. Or they could sell both.\n\nI think that there would be a demand for a site like this from both users as well as from marketers. Some of our work is quite good it's just that as non pros it's difficult to get past the traditional gatekeepers of the fine art and stock business. A site like this would be designed to bypass the gatekeepers and allow it's members the ability to connect directly to marketers and art buyers.\n\nAgain it's very early and I'm really only in the research stage on all of this but I think our work is good enough and for those of us who want to begin to earn our living in photography a tool like this doesn't exist today.\n\nOf course I'd be thrilled to see flickr offer us a suite of tools to do this but I don't think that is where they are headed.\n\nages ago\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nRe API keys for direct competitors: this is something that we've never had any set policy on and this thread has sparked a lot of internal debate on the team: some people felt that it was unreasonable, some people felt like it didn't matter since Flickr should win on the basis of being the best thing out there.\n\nI actually had a change of heart and was convinced by Eric's position that we definitely should approve requests from direct competitors as long as they do the same. That means (a) that they need to have a full and complete API and (b) be willing to give us access.\n\nStewart this is really good to hear. And I appreciate the change of heart. What I meant with tabblo is that they have the capability (built on their end if I understand it correctly) to import all of my images and tags from flickr. I've in fact done this there. I don't think the tags are actually imbedded in the .jpg file when they import, I think they actually use your commercial API to pull the tags from Flickr's database. It doesn't really matter to me whether the data resides in the .jpg or in the flickr database, as long as flickr is willing to let others get at my data from your database (tags) when initiated by me the user on my own personal photos.\n\nI like the idea of tagging and creating richer and richer and richer metadata over time but I want to feel like I have some level of control via exportability and transferability of this data. With my RSS reader for instance I can export an OPML file and import it into any other RSS reader that I like. Photographs are more complicated of course, but I'm pleased that there is a willingness on flickr's part to say yes if a competitor requests a commerical API key to import. I also hope that someone develops a tool at some point that will do this as initiated by the actual user too. I wish I could write one myself and if I had any idea what I'm doing I would but I don't.\n\nLike Dshalock I too am really pleased by the way to see you answer these things here. It is very meaningful that you are willing to interact with flickr users. You don't have to do that of course and most large company executives never do. You of course though are not like most large company executives.\n\nages ago\n\nStewart says:\n\nstriatic: I think you rambled a few steps beyond me. We obviously don't have the keys to Google's servers and I'd be astonished if they built an import tool, so practically speaking it doesn't matter whether we'd give them access to the API. The fact that there are no services on the web that work in the way you describe is a pretty good indicator of the feasibility.\n\n(No services that I know of anyway, and I watch this stuff pretty closely.) That's why you download an OPML file and upload it somewhere else. More generally, that's why there .csv format, and XML all over the place, a zillion IEEE, ISO, ITU and IETF standards, and things like EXIF, DOPF, ITPC and XMP for photos. That's why you export your blog from one service and import it to another.\n\nAnd that's why I was talking about embedding information in the jpg files - the only way you get real interoperability is with a standard. Most people with digital cameras use their PCs to manage their photos. What are the chances that Microsoft builds a Flickr API-based Flickr importer into Windows or Apple builds one into OS X? Or Adobe Photoshop Album, Picasa (the desktop client), ACDSee, Jasc/Corel Photo Album, Thumbs Plus, iMatch and the dozens of others do the same? Would all of them start coming bundled with web servers? Are we going to implement an import service for each of them in case someone changes their mind after making some changes?\n\n\"flickr and the competing service don't suffer any more or less in this three party data transfer.\"\n\nYes, they absolutely do. It's the difference between building and maintaining one piece of software built on a standard which multiple parties support and implementing dozens of interfaces to differing systems. And on top of the code (and tracking changes to other developers systems, dealing with their downtimes, etc.) every time you have an interface like that, the support burden gets larger since approximately 0% of users have any idea how this stuff works and don't know who to contact when things break.\n\n\"is it flickr's place to enforce this?\"\n\nYes, absolutely. This is ... Flickr. There are servers in datacenters operated by Flickr, running code written by Flickr, which is used by people who are supported by Flickr staff. We listen very carefully to the people who use Flickr, and we have a much closer relationship to them than (as far as I know) any service of a similar size, but it's not a democracy. It's our place to make the decisions about the policies, business plans, feature set, design and all of the stuff that goes into Flickr, because the whole thing is our responsibility.\n\nWe also have to call the shots about the tradeoffs in what we do, given finite resources. The coding of the API and maintaining the machines to service it is actually a much smaller job than dealing with the issues it raises. And we're now still just scratching the surface when it comes to privacy, security and conveying to users a conceptual framework so they can understand what \"authentication\" is, and what the permissions levels mean, what risks they are taking, and who's responsibility it is should things go wrong (not that that matters much, since we already know who'll get blamed ;)\n\nAnd since a tiny number of people have the need to try every new photo service that comes out (believe it or not, the overwhelming majority of people who use Flickr love it), supporting competitors through the API will probably always take a back seat to, say, new features, stability, infrastructure, security, redundancy, projects that make us money, optimizing design, making Flickr easier, and on and on and on.\n\n[edit to fix a typo]\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nStewart (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nantrod says:\n\nHey all,\n\nSince we've been mentioned a few times in the thread, let me jump in here for a second.\n\nAt Tabblo, we have both Flickr integration and Picasa integration. In the case of the former, all we had to do was read a very well-written document and use a very easy to grok API and be off to the cool races. In the case of the latter, we had to spend a couple of days reverse-engineering a complicated desktop application/server-based protocol, then more time debugging it, and as of late, more time bringing it up to date for the 2.5 release of Picasa. So to anyone who thinks that Flickr is any less than open, I'd say: BS, go and try what we did if you want to see what less-than-open means.\n\nNow, having said that, I'm also really glad the Flickr guys are so open and good for a much more important reason– you guys (the community). As I think I've said before, we've learned tons from the folks who brought over big libraries of photos (and metadata) and started making albums with them. We're not trying to \"win you over\" or \"get you to leave flickr for tabblo--\" quite the contrary, we set out to build a tool that would help people get more out of all the stuff they had already uploaded to the cloud. I think the whole genesis of this debate came out of the fact that there are people out there who just want to knock off flickr and when you do that, the next logical conclusion is that the whole thing has been turned into a zero-sum game where if site X wins, flickr loses and vice-versa.\n\nFor our part, we're about to implement \"publish your tabblo to flickr\" as a raster so that people in the flickr community can participate and comment on tabblos being made. I like this feature because I like the flickr discussion threads better than ours, and because I like hanging out on flickr.com. And I want to continue to be able to do things like this because of the trust that I've feel we've built up with Flickr, and more importantly with the Flickr community.\n\nMaybe it has to do with the fact that our business model is not around ads/impressions/media, and so we don't feel threatened by people hopping from site to site. And maybe it's the fact that we're really trying to \"stand on the shoulders of giants\" with Tabblo instead of building a Flickr++. Either way, I really do want to take a moment to say \"thank you and hang in there\" to all of the Flickr folks following this debate.\n\nages ago\n\nazrasta says:\n\nThomas:I guess a lot's been said, I just wanted to hopefully add some things :).\n\nFirst, regarding your fear about 'not owning' your tags (not being able to get them back), the flickr api actually works really well. It does let you retrieve not only your tags, but the tags other users have added to your photos (if you allow them to).\n\nAnother cool feature of the api, is that it lets you 'search' for related tags (say you send a call for the tag 'city', it may return 'town' as a related tag).\n\nSo, in that aspect, I guess there should be no fear that you can't retrieve your tags. I don't know if there's any specific application that lets you backup photos and tags in a clean way (or save them as xml or any other format), but the tools are out there. The api is easy to use (even more with the wrappers that exist for the different programming languagees), and some basic functionality could be achieved spending a few hours playing with the api (that is, if you know some programming).\n\nI guess now what you need, is someone with enough time to create a little app for just that (although probably there's one out there already).\n\nAbout google not liking flickr :P\n\nWell, this is what i get from my google analytics stats for my blog:\n\n21% came from google.com\n\n7.3% from, images.google.com\n\n7.4% from, yahoo\n\nSo, I was getting a lot of traffic from google (almost one third), even when it almost has no text nor optimization for search engines (now, it could also be because of the nature of the blog ;) ). But, it's important to say that it was hosted on blogger (which is google's blog service), so that may be an important factor. I'll still have to see what happens now that I moved to my own domain with a wordpress installation (too soon to tell, but still, no traffic from any search engines).\n\nFinally, in my opinion, I think people tend to forget that flickr is a business. They offer a great service and a great community, but they are also here to make money. So, they should do everything possible to keep their users happy (and from my point of view they do an excelent job there), but when it comes to competitors, I think flickr should and probably will do what benefits them the most. So, I'd agree that if a competitor would use the API for their own advantage, it's up to flickr whether to let them use it or not. Actually, just as a very lame example, my blog is still there because flickr 'lets' me maintain it. It was blocked by flickr when I displayed ads there, and their reason was that making money from ads (which i wasn't making any anyway) from content provided and hosted by flickr just was not something they wanted to support. I absolutely agree with that\n\nages ago\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\n\"Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they. How did this change come about? I do not know. What can make it legitimate? That question I think I can answer.\" Jean Jacques Rousseau. The Social Contract.\n\nA lot of charged language has been flying around over the past four days or so with regards to Flickr and what rights their users ought or ought not to have with regards to their content. It started off with a thread in Flickr Central when Google launched their new Picasa photo sharing app and has escalated from there to Digg, TechCrunch and now Slashdot.\n\nAs I've been involved in the recent debate since it started I wanted to offer up my thoughts on the matter at hand. It's important to note that yesterday I joined Zooomr, a direct competitor to Flickr. I've kept quiet on the posts over the weekend because I wanted to announce that before offering up anything more on the subject than I already have.\n\nAs one of Flickr's heaviest users I feel that I have a decent understanding of the situation and problem at present.\n\nA number of months back Anil Dash wrote a post called \"The Interesting Economy.\" In this post Anil posed the most basic question of all from a Flickr user's perspective, \"what's in it for me?\"\n\nFrom Anil: \"But interestingness in Flickr doesn't pay. At least not yet. Non-pro users are seeing ads around my photos, but Yahoo's not sharing the wealth with me, even though I've created a draw. Flickr's plenty open, they're doing the right thing by any measure of the web as we saw it a year ago, or two years ago. Today, though, openness around value exchange is as important as openness around data exchange.\"\n\nCaterina Fake responded to Anil with the following: \"Everyone needs to get paid, businesses need to thrive. I don't begrudge blogs like Anil's their AdSense links, or Flickr displaying ads on free accounts (I may have a bias there). But monetization strategy or no, the culture of generosity is the very backbone of the internet. It is why I have always loved it.\"\n\nAt the time, and still today, I agree with Caterina Fake. I have always felt that I've gotten much more out of Flickr than money could ever provide and thus I've felt it more than a fair deal. I don't need to be paid by Flickr. I enjoy the generosity that Caterina speaks of and love the share and share alike spirt of Flickr. And over the past year I've spent hours and hours and hours working away at my flickrstream. Uploading new photos every day, meticulously documenting my images with detailed tags, building friends and making contacts, enjoying and sharing with everyone I meet, and participating actively in many different groups and conversations on the site. But lately I've been having some second thoughts.\n\nThe central issue around the recent debate is not whether or not you can get your photographs out of Flickr. Slashdot got this really wrong when they wrote, \"yet Flickr's API only allows uploading, not exporting.\" There are several tools that have already been developed to allow exporting out of Flickr. Downloadr and Slickr come to mind immediately.\n\nYou absolutely can get your photographs out of Flickr your photos are not locked up. Flickr is not the roach motel that others have been making it out to be.\n\nWhat is at issue is not your photos, but the metadata associated with your photos. At present Flickr does not keep the tags that you use to name and organize your photos in the photo files themselves. Rather these tags are part of a larger Flickr database that Flickr associates with your images. And this is the real issue to focus on. How can you as a user, and should you as a user, be able to easily get all of your photos and the metadata associated with them out of flickr and on to a competitive platform.\n\nRecently Zooomr requested a Commercial API from Flickr. This request, in part, was based on a desire to create an easy way for users to migrate their photos and metadata over to Zooomr should they want to try/use the Zooomr service. Zooomr was denied this request by Flickr. Other sites, like Tabblo, who is perhaps viewed as less of a direct competitor to Flickr than Zooomr have been given API keys and have in fact used them to create tools that easily allow a user the ability to transfer their photos and metadata over to their service. I personally used the tabblo service and tool to transfer all my flickr photos and metadata there and you can check out how complete a transfer it was at my tabblo page here.\n\nI think that it was a mistake to deny Zooomr this request. I think it was a mistake because at the foundation of this great thing that we call Web 2.0 I believe there exists a social contract between companies and their users that trumps business interests. Perhaps I'm being naive here but I firmly believe that the user's needs must always come first for any Web 2.0 company. As businesses profit from the free labor, goodwill and generosity that Caterina Fake writes of, I believe that while they may not be owed actual compensation, that they are owed every effort to protect their rights, privileges and control over that which they create and contribute.\n\nIt is very very cool how easy it was to transfer my entire flickrstream and all of the associated metadata easily and seamlessly over to tabblo. It should be that easy for any other site I choose to use as well. And while it should not be incumbent on Flickr to build the tools to do this, they should make their API available to other companies who would like to build these import tools nonetheless. They should do this because it's the right thing to do from their side of the user generated contract.\n\nAnd I think Flickr feels this way too. In fact it should be noted that after denying Zooomr's original request, Flickr's Stewart Butterfield has expressed that he has had a change of heart with regards to allowing competitors access to Flickr commercial API keys and will most likely grant these requests if a competitor also agrees to allow Flickr access to their open API. I applaud this effort but in fact still think it needs to go a tad further. I do think that flickr should open up their API for building import/export tools for competitors irrespective of the status of their API. Again, I may be living in a utopia here, but I do believe that in the end doing the right thing always wins out. And if other sites want to stay closed while Flickr stays open then I think in the end users will respect Flickr all the more for this and it will create a stronger bond between them and their users. Zooomr by the way is committed to an open API and Kris is working on the finishing touches on Zooomr's as I write this.\n\nOne final thing. I think that in this entire debate Flickr has at times been portrayed as the bad guy here. This could not be further from the truth. In fact, Flickr has probably done more for user's rights and ability to control their content then just about any Web 2.0 company that exists today. They have popularized the Creative Commons license. They have routinely listened to and actively engaged their users. They have created broad tools to allow users to offer varying degrees of access, privacy and control over their images. They have carefully cultivated an environment of mutual respect between they and their users and have constantly fought for the rights of these users. They will likely even change their position with regards to granting competitors Commercial API keys. They have been about as fine an example of good stewardship in the user generated contract as exists today. In all of this I think it's unfair for anyone to suggest otherwise.\n\n[edited to remove direct links to flickr and zooomr that I had in my original blog post]\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nThomas Hawk edited this topic ages ago.\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nEric. Flickr is definitely not a \"roach motel\" and I think Kris was speaking more broadly and in general about the need for a free flow of data between applications rather than calling flickr a name. I will also speak with him more specifically about that term though as I know it was used in an article on ZDNet a while back and it is inappropriate to in any way characterize flickr as such. I can't think of a photosharing company that has been more user centered an open than flickr. Flickr has done more for their users in terms of giving them control over their data than virtually any company I know of. I love flickr. very very much. I can't imagine ever not being a part of flickr.\n\nOf course Kris and I are certain to have different opinions about things too but I think bottom line is we both think user data ought to be completely portable.\n\nBut irrespecitive of the fact that I love flickr I think that Web 2.0 companies should in fact allow the infrastructure to allow users to easily move, control and migrate their data. I suspect that you feel the same way. And I also feel that it's important that this conversation take place and happen respectfully and maturely.\n\nA while back I wanted to try NewGator instead of bloglines. In the world of RSS now it is pretty common for companies to build import tools for RSS feeds from other readers. In fact I don't know a single RSS reader that doesn't have an import tool. Selfishly each of these companies wants to make it as easy as possible for someone to switch to their service. Of course exporting OPML files is far easier than huge image libraries complete with massive amounts of metadata.\n\nBut through using Flickr's API virtually any company can create as easy an import tool as tabblo has created. And flickr should allow this and I'm pretty sure will allow this at least to companies who also maintain open and shared APIs per Stewart's previous remarks on the matter which he also credited you with in part. This is a super positive thing. All companies should be open that way and thrive and compete based on their features, customer service, development, cost, etc. alone. The best companies truly will end up on top and I do believe that the companies that win will be the most open of them all.\n\nAs our lives increasingly are contained in various online properties it is important that these communities are fluid and allow us an opportunity if we want to move our stuff around. Fundamentally this stuff (and not just the photos but the metadata associated with them) belongs to users first and foremost.\n\nI feel that some of the comments on techcrunch, digg, and slashdot inappropriately portrayed flickr in a negative light when I truly believe flickr is about doing the right thing for the user at all times. Irrespecitve of what Kris or anyone else might write or say by the way.\n\nages ago\n\nequal rifle [deleted] says:\n\nThomas, I've followed this with interest out in the weblogs. Finally had to get a new Flickr account (I had deleted my old) just so I can comment.\n\n(Well, and I might post a few pics again...)\n\nYour boss is not very knowledgable about data interchange. About the worst thing to contemplate is direct service to service interchange of data through an open API.\n\nStewart is right: what is needed is a common export/import format. With this, a person could export their data, and then import into another tool, ensuring that only the data they want to go to the new service is being transmitted.\n\nIt would be two days work to create a tool to download a person's data, and embed the metadata into their images (PNG or JPEG). And any photo service should be able to read this and extract out the metadata.\n\nRegardless, one could use Atom or RSS for the metadata for an interim solution.\n\nPiece of cake to do. Didn't need to go through all this high profile BS. As for the burden of exporting this data -- that's silly. It hardly takes any space for 99% of Flickr users to export their photos and metadata to their personal computers. I'm assuming that power users could afford the space and time.\n\nAs for giving companies commercial API access, If Zooomer uses the API and has a person's account information, they can also get that person's contacts, and then how long before we see emails flying: Hi! Such and such is now a client at Zooomer. Wouldn't you like to be one, too?\n\nThen there are other companies that want to use Flickr as a central store. Oh, but they don't want to pay. They just want to have access to the API, totally disregarding that every call on the API takes resources and bandwidth.\n\nOh, but you say, data wants to be free.\n\nBull. Data wants to be secure. I suggest those who think otherwise, paint flowers on their navels and go live in a hut in the hills and practice free, and unprotected, sex.\n\nI hope that Flickr does NOT give an API key to Zooomr. I think it will be a bad mistake. But, has to be a decision for the Flickr group to make. I just hope Flickr's, and the client's, trust doesn't backfire on them.\n\nThe question back then is: if Kris is a programming wiz, why can't he take my and other's suggestions and create a tool for clients to use? And Zooomr's own API does....what was that again?\n\nages ago\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nShelly,\n\nBottom line is I cannot get my tags out of Flickr today period. The *only* place I've seen where they can be transferred is tabblo. And it is *super* easy to transfer them to tabblo. Many, many companies have the Flickr API and commercial APIs. Any one of these companies could abuse the API and I'd assume that if they did that that it would be revoked.\n\nOn the phone to me Stewart mentioned that maybe there might be a way to do it buy purchasing DVDs (and this is just that there *might* be a way). I did not hear any other way shared with me to do this at the user level. And buying DVDs is ridiculous. I have over 5,000 high res images. The cost associated this, inconvenience, etc. would be astronomical. Compare this to the ease of experience with importing into tabblo and there is no comparison.\n\n\"It would be two days work to create a tool to download a person's data, and embed the metadata into their images\"\n\nGreat. I welcome it being built, and I'll be the first person to test it out and review it when it's here. But I still doubt it will be as seamless as the experience is with tabblo and I still would assume someone would need a flickr API to builid even this tool. Kris was denied a flickr api and so he can't build it. This is a moot point though because this decision per Stewart is likely to be reversed.\n\nBull. Data wants to be secure. I suggest those who think otherwise, paint flowers on their navels and go live in a hut in the hills and practice free, and unprotected, sex.\n\nI'd hardly associate a user wanting access to their own data with unprotected sex. It may not matter to you Shelly that you can't get your data out of flickr. You youself said that you didn't have much data here. But what if your blog posts were tied to your current blog platform? What if you could export your blog posts but none of the comments that readers had made? I suspect you might feel differently then. I suspect that you might feel that the data on your blog belongs to you much more than to the platform provider that you choose to use.\n\n\"Piece of cake to do. Didn't need to go through all this high profile BS. As for the burden of exporting this data -- that's silly. It hardly takes any space for 99% of Flickr users to export their photos and metadata to their personal computers.\"\n\nThis is *not* a piece of cake to do. There is no way to do this at flickr today which is part of the point.\n\nI honestly do not understand the hostility at allowing users the capability of seamlessly moving their data to and from whatever service that they would like. To me this argument is about user choice and the obligations that Web 2.0 companies have to work together to make things as easy as possible for the user with whom I believe there ought to exist a social contract of sorts.\n\nBut all of this is a moot point and we are beating this conversation to death. Something for which I'm definitely known. Stewart already said he'd give Zooomr the API once Zooomr published and shared there own which Kris is in the process of doing. I just don't really understand the hostility for allowing competing companies the ability to trust each other and share these types of tools in an effort to provide users the easiest way possible to move their media around the web. This to me is what Web 2.0 is and should be about. And it shouldn't need to be something that someone has to defend.\n\nages ago\n\nStewart says:\n\nThomas, there's something you're not getting and if you actually care about this stuff, you should pay attention and think about it. If it doesn't make sense to you or you don't believe me, go talk to anyone with any real length of experience in the software business:\n\n**The only path to real data portability is through open standards**. If we have to rely on different vendors implementing each others API, it just won't happen. Yes, you might get a handful of sites doing one-off interop with each other, but *most* users won't have a choice because getting from their A to their B won't be implemented.\n\nNeither Microsoft nor Apple are going to build Flickr importers into their OSes. Right there, 90%+ of users are stuck. And the various desktop photo organization programs are not going to come bundled with web servers so the web-based services can built import tools from them (and, even in the bizarre parallel universe where they did, we wouldn't spend time building the import tools from them).\n\nWhen there is a standard, each vendor can implement it one time and then never has to do any more work (excepting updates to the standard, of course). And everything \"just works\". Tags and everything else are portable. ITPC (+XMP or not) is pretty close -- it may even be good enough as is (though it would be better with a few extensions, the creation of which we'd be happy to participate in).\n\nNot a single person has disgreed with you on the principle that data should be portable. You don't need to defend that. The method you're proposing is one that simply does not and will not ever work broadly. It is not the path to the most choice. And it also comes with a lot of subtle and complicated issues (which we're now working through).\n\nAnd, for the last time, the \"your data belongs to you\" characterization is a canard. Of course it does. We support that probably more than *any* *other* *company* around today. Your suggestions to the contrary are insulting and surreal.\n\nDo you have ANY evidence for it? What about the huge amounts of evidence to the contrary? The idea that we claim any ownership at all of people's photos or data is completely beyond the pale.\n\nAside from core operations, we probably spend a 1/3 of our time dealing with people who think \"public\" on flickr means \"public domain\" and use photos at will or try to monetize the search capability or treat flickr as a free stock site.\n\nOn top of that, we handle literallly *millions* of api calls per day and serve *100s* of *millions* of photos per day to sites outside the flickr.com domain, almost all of it so people can use their photos where they want, when they want.\n\nWe've written huge amounts of code at both the infrastructe level and the feature level to both promote users' (and data) freedom while protecting their rights, and it's still on-going.\n\nAn example: We were acquired a year ago and there's no Flickr integration in Y!'s image search. Why not? Easy win, right? Because we wanted to build a way for users to opt of API-based searches before doing so. And we wanted to do that because a lot of users don't want their photos in image search, but do want them showing up on Flickr.com. And that meant some fairly large changes to the way the search system worked, which we just completed.\n\nI could easily write 50,000 words in one sitting about all the decisions we've made and discussions we've had to protect users' rights and empower their freedom, almost none of which even show up to casual observers.\n\nThese aren't things we do to score PR points, but things we do because of fundamental convictions. And though most users don't notice most of these issues, we have made a lot of people happy.\n\nI'm off your blog and this is the last time I'll engage with you on these topics here too. Again, if you really care about this stuff, think it through.\n\n(P.s., why is the \"bottom line is that you cannot get your tags out of Flickr today period\" and not \"bottom line is that you cannot get your tags out of Zooomr today period\" or \"bottom line is that you annot get your tags out of PicasaWeb today period\". Wtf?)\n\nages ago\n\nequal rifle [deleted] says:\n\nThomas: Many, many companies have the commerial APIs? I'm aware of a few associated with the marketing here at the site for printing and other vanity press stuff, but I didn't know that Flickr was tossing the API out, willy,nilly to any company without having an agreement in place. What companies?\n\nI'm assuming for the companies that they entered an arrangement, and probably worked out restrictions as to what the company could do with the data, and what part of the data they could retrieve. Not to mention what they could or could not communicate to the Flickr folk.\n\nI'm also assuming the commercial agreements were for complementary services.\n\nThis is a far cry from giving a blank go ahead to Zooomr to use the API however it wants, with no agreement in place. I imagine that even if Flickr gives the go ahead, Zooomr is going to have to agree to some pretty strong restrictions, or the client data is as risk for being compromised.\n\nTabblo strikes me as a complementary service, not a competitive one. In addition, it also strikes me that they probably discussed a contract with Flickr, and probably entered into an agreement on the extent of data they can or cannot access -- and what they can do with that data.\n\nFlickr, first and foremost, has a responsibility to ensure the safety of the data people trust to the system. This means if the company enters an agreement with another company to allow direct transfer, it's responsibility doesn't end. If tabblo were to abuse the data, the 'blame' would have to also reside on Flickr for allowing this access.\n\nNow, if a person uses a home grown application to get their own photos and data, that's up to them. They're responsible for their own actions, because they own the data.\n\nIt's either/or: You can't grant an organization open and unregulated access to the data, because you can't ensure that this privlege won't be abused. You can grant open access to the user, because they have to be responsible for their decisions--it is their data.\n\n\"I'd hardly associate a user wanting access to their own data with unprotected sex. It may not matter to you Shelly that you can't get your data out of flickr. You youself said that you didn't have much data here. But what if your blog posts were tied to your current blog platform? What if you could export your blog posts but none of the comments that readers had made? I suspect you might feel differently then. I suspect that you might feel that the data on your blog belongs to you much more than to the platform provider that you choose to use.\"\n\nThomas, I've been weblogging since about 2000, and have used almost every weblogging tool there is. I've lost posts and comments both. I once was in a free ManilaSite, that's how long I've been weblogging. Oh, and I lost these posts and comments. But then, it was free and I wasn't that serious about weblogging at the time.\n\nIn most cases, the tool provided a way for me to export the posts and comments. I had to then in turn import them into other tools. I've helped hundreds of people do this effort. It works.\n\nNow, I only use centralized services if I can export the data I want to keep; preferably into a format that other tools can import.\n\nBut would I give one service my open connection to my account at another service? Only if I knew there was no vulnerable data they would have access to, and only if I were burning my bridges and not planning on coming back. The very fact that there are contacts with my Flickr account would make me extremely wary. I would most likely delete the contacts, first -- to protect them.\n\nIs this the type of connection you want from Zooomr to Flickr? A one way road?\n\nAs for DVD, I don't know what you and Stewart discussed over the phone. I am referencing the communication that's out in the open. I would think that the phone conversation between you both would be confidential to you both.\n\n\"I honestly do not understand the hostility at allowing users the capability of seamlessly moving their data to and from whatever service that they would like. To me this argument is about user choice and the obligations that Web 2.0 companies have to work together to make things as easy as possible for the user with whom I believe there ought to exist a social contract of sorts.\"\n\nBecause much of the time, the users don't necessarily understand the dangers of such openness. If you were to tell any Flickr account holder that Zooomr would have access to their contact list and information as photo and metadata, how many would be as comfortable with this type of direct access?\n\nNo one who has had an Orkut or LinkedIn account would be to ready to sign up, that's for sure.\n\n\"To me this argument is about user choice and the obligations that Web 2.0 companies have to work together to make things as easy as possible for the user with whom I believe there ought to exist a social contract of sorts.\"\n\nWhere did you hear this one? I would say that Web 2.0 companies first and foremost have an obligation not to fail. Where's the rulebook that said companies have to make it easier for their competitors?\n\n\"But all of this is a moot point and we are beating this conversation to death. Something for which I'm definitely known. Stewart already said he'd give Zooomr the API once Zooomr published and shared there own which Kris is in the process of doing.\"\n\npersonally, after the last week, I think this is a mistake. But hey, luckily, I don't have to worry about the consequences.\n\n\" I just don't really understand the hostility for allowing competing companies the ability to trust each other and share these types of tools in an effort to provide users the easiest way possible to move their media around the web. This to me is what Web 2.0 is and should be about. And it shouldn't need to be something that someone has to defend.\"\n\nUltimately, any service has as first priority the protection of that service's data. Then, and only once this responsibilitiy is met, it provides facilities for the user to get their data in a format that meets some industrial standard (for whatever industry, defacto or otherwise).\n\nAs for direct company to company transfer: there is no 'trust' in business. It is not in the user's best interest to have it so. If Flickr gives another company access to my data on Flickr, I want as many legal restrictions on this access as possible. I want that data to squeek as it's reluctantly pulled out. I want the data exchanges to be scrutinized, and hovered over.\n\nI don't want Flickr to give the data to any person who comes along who gets some A lister weblogger to harrass and haranque--because how will I know what the company will do with access to my data once I give them my precious username and password?\n\nThat's why I'm pushing back on this. Many of the people who use this service and might try Zooomr may not be fully aware of how vulnerable their data is. I know, though, and my responsibility is to make these folk aware of this vulnerability. It is the responsibility of any tech.\n\nIt may not be the Web 2.0 way, but I don't care. Then if folk want to shoot themselves, fine -- but I hope they don't take their contacts with them.\n\nI would also hate to see Flickr's integrity harmed, just because an A Lister is irresponsible in his reporting, and others wave \"Web 2.0\" as if its a magic wand to Keep Away Bad People.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nequal rifle edited this topic ages ago.\n\nThomas Hawk says:\n\nStewart, first off, I really do appreciate your taking the time to discuss this. I've said this before about your accesibility and it is a really great thing. You obviously are passionate and care about this and have thought it through greatly. I'm sure with access to much better information than I.\n\nAnd I do care about this stuff. A lot. And I appreciate your taking the time to educate me.\n\n\"**The only path to real data portability is through open standards**.\"\n\nOk, I think what you are saying here is that some kind of a tool needs to be created which will tie in the metadata associated with a user's images at flickr to the actual image file itself and then allow an easy and seamless way to download. And I think what you are saying is that although this is not here today, Flickr is committed to developing some kind of standard with regards to this and in the meantime things like the import/export functionality via tabblo are bandaid approaches and not the real deal.\n\nIs this something that flickr should build or are you saying that someone else should build it? And wouldn't someone need the api in order to build this? I take it that it's not here today because as of today I can't get my tags out of flickr (nor can I get them out of zooomr, or picasa or other places, mine just happen to be at flickr at present).\n\nZooomr, Picasa, etc. should all do everything they can too to provide the user the ability to transfer their data from service to service. At least in the case of Zooomr, I know that this is the plan.\n\nAnd, for the last time, the \"your data belongs to you\" characterization is a canard. Of course it does. We support that probably more than *any* *other* *company* around today. Your suggestions to the contrary are insulting and surreal.\n\nStewart, there is no need to defend this. I absolutely know how flickr feels about this. As I've mentioned in this entire debate and agree with you, Flickr has been a *huge* defender, proponent and suporter of users and their data. The entire site is built around users feeling good and comfortable with keeping their stuff here. Flickr bends over backwards to ensure that users are comfortable and in fact you push and promote things like Creative Commons licensing even when many of your users have no idea that you are looking out for them.\n\nIt sounds like it's just a technical blip more than anything that tags can't easily be retrieved at the moment and I'm confident that in the weeks ahead we will see a solution to this in some capicity some where in some way.\n\nThe fact that my tags feel trapped to me I fully understand is not part of some kind of intentional act on flickr's part to somehow hold flickr users captive. Flickr doesn't need to do this. People *love* flickr. I love flickr. Flickr would never pursue any type of path to lock people in. Flickr is about openess. Truly. I fully get this and believe this.\n\nI think in my own mind I just associated the ease at which I could export to tabblo and wished that I had that functionality with other sites whether as a temporary bandaid approach or not. It felt to me that by denyting others access to the same API that tabblo had access to that it was preventing me from doing so elsewhere. AND EVEN this has been addressed! You suggested that flickr would in fact even there go the extra mile to support these kinds of tools should a competitor also do this.\n\nPlease do not think that I in any way feel bad about flickr as a company.\n\n\"We were acquired a year ago and there's no Flickr integration in Y!'s image search. Why not? Easy win, right? Because we wanted to build a way for users to opt of API-based searches before doing so. And we wanted to do that because a lot of users don't want their photos in image search, but do want them showing up on Flickr.com. And that meant some fairly large changes to the way the search system worked, which we just completed.\"\n\nI appreciate your sharing this as well. Not that it's entirely relevent to the exact debate at hand but it certainly does show the care and concern that you take when considering what's best for your users. For what it's worth I think integrating images into Yahoo Image Search for those who don't object is a *huge* feature and am really excited to hear that you guys are doing this and am very much looking forward to seeing this as it rolls out.\n\nThe method you're proposing is one that simply does not and will not ever work broadly. It is not the path to the most choice. And it also comes with a lot of subtle and complicated issues (which we're now working through).\n\nYou are probably right here and although an api-api exchange may be a bandaid in the short term, I agree that if this is not the best approach that a longer term solution should be figured out. I'm still not sure exactly how this will/is going to happen but look forward to seeing companies adopt these kinds of standards to the best end use of portability for the user.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your willingness to discuss this publicly, as always your accesibility, and your patience with me in trying to get this all figured out in my own mind. And please know that I totally think Flickr is on the side of the user. Have always thought this. And can't imagine Flickr ever doing anything to change my opinion about this. I honestly now have a far better understanding of how all of this might/should/will eventually work and feel pretty good about it actually.\n\nages ago"
