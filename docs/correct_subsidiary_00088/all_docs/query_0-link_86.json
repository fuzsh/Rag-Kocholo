        "text": "CHAPTER 17Mark FletcherFounder, ONElist, Bloglines\n\nMark Fletcher was a senior software engineer for Sun Microsystems when he started ONElist, a free Internet email list service, in 1997. He ran ONElist as a side project until he received venture funding a year later. Yahoo acquired ONElist (later renamed eGroups) in June 2000.\n\nIn 2003, Fletcher created Bloglines, a web-based news aggregation service. He originally wrote the program to manage his own bookmark list, but once he launched it publicly, Bloglines was fast on its way to becoming the most popular news aggregator on the Internet. It was acquired by Ask Jeeves in February, 2005."
