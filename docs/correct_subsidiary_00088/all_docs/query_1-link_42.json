At present we have over 300 members which include B-29 veterans, their descendants and others who simply enjoy this magnificent flying machine.\n\nYahoo Groups is a free and easy email group. You can go to their site to check out their entire list of mail groups here. Check out eGroups by clicking on What is eGroups and Take the Tour - This will give you an overview of what an email mailing list is.\n\nSubscribe:\n\nIf you would like to join our mailing list:\n\nFirst, click here to go to our community's front page.\n\nNext you'll see a page with three columns: a left menu column, a center \"Description\" column, and a right column titled \"Join Now!\" Click on \"Subscribe\" in the right column.\n\nNow click the link that says, \"New Member? Click here to register for FREE!\" Then fill out the info and pick a password. Follow the instructions, such as submitting the verification code that Yahoo will send you by e-mail, and you'll be all set as a new B-29 community member!\n\nChanging Your Status:\n\nOnce you've subscribed you're now a member of our community. Now you can change your settings: how you receive e-mail, your profile, etc.\n\nFirst, go to the front page here.\n\nNow the third column on the right is labeled \"Membership.\" Click on \"Delivery Options.\"\n\nNow you can change how you receive messages:\n\nIndividual emails - getting the messages one at a time as they come in.\n\nDaily digest - getting all the messages combines into one digest (you will not receive any attachments of files or photos in this method)\n\nNo Mail - which means you are a member but don't want e-mail; you'll read the messages on the web site. Use this option when going on vacation or if you do NOT want email arriving at your inbox on your home PC.\n\nUnder \"HTML Email\" are these options:\n\nHTML You'll receive email with colors and graphics.\n\nPlain text You'll get mostly text in the body of the e-mails.\n\nOnce you make your changes, click on the \"Save Changes\" button, and you're set!"
