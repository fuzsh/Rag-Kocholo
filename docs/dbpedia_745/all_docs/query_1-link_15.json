        "text": "Gorga, a fraction of the municipality of Stio, is an ancient village located in the inner part of Cilento, which is located at the southernmost tip of Campania. The town is situated at 600 meters above sea level, at the source of the Alento river, in an area characterised by mountainous and hilly terrain, which is predominantly clay and rich in spring waters. This area has always committed a great amount of dedication to the cultivation of this bean species, so much so that over the centuries a particular ecotype has been isolated: The Gorga Queen bean. The royal-sounding name is linked to a legend, which states that this sweet bean was very popular with the Queen of Naples, Maria Carolina of Habsburg. Known already in the Bourbon Restoration period, this ecotype has been cultivated since before anyone can remember by all the families in the territory of origin (the municipality of Stio and at the source of the Alento river in the Gorga fraction) and in the neighbouring towns for its great storage characteristics, which , together with chestnuts, made it ideal both for small businesses and for surviving long mountain winters. Another piece of evidence which links this crop with the territory, is the presence of the ancient \"fraveche\", many of which are now abandoned. These are cultivatable terraces created using dry stone walls near the springs. The quality of the water, together with the soils rich in magnesium, appear to give the Gorga Queen bean its delicate flavour.\n\nIt is a climbing plant that can even exceed three meters in height and that adapts well to different types of soil, even if it prefers deep, cool, not too compact and well-drained soils.\n\nSowing takes place between mid-June and mid-July through the use of two methods: in rows with the use of nets (more modern) and in trenches with the use of poles (traditional). Both the sowing and harvesting phases are carried out by hand. Harvesting can go from late September to early November: the plants are left to dry in the field and then the removal of the beans from the pods is done by hand or with an artisanal machine. If the beans are still a little damp, they are placed in the attics of the producers’ farmhouses, where they dry out for a couple of days.\n\nThe Gorga Queen bean has a rounded tending to an oval shape and a pearly white colour. The cuticle is thin, the pulp is compact, and it is characterised by a high digestibility.\n\nTo enhance its sweetness, simple preparations are preferable, such as pasta and beans and salad, prepared with blanched beans and dressed with extra virgin olive oil and parsley. The symbolic dish of the local gastronomic tradition is the “ciccimmaretati”, a soup with seven different types of legumes and cereals. It is prepared on the occasion of the festival of poor Cilento dishes, held in August and, traditionally, it had the purpose of making room in the cupboards in order to make space for the new harvests.\n\nSeason\n\nGorga Queen bean is sown in the early summer and harvested in early autumn. As a dried product it is available all year round."
