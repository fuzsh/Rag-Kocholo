        "text": "Magliano Vetere is situated between the thick woods and the rocks shaped by the waters of Calore River. Magliano is formed by three hamlets, they are very ancient and surrounded by the wild nature of the Parco Nazionale del Cilento and Vallo di Diano. The path of the rocky chapels is really wonderful, and the itinerary to the Middle Ages bridge under Magliano Nuovo until the wonderful gorges of Calore River, is beautiful, too.\n\nAccording to a legend, in this territory there is a treasure abandoned by brigands, maybe escaped or caught by gendarmes. The ancient part of the town is inserted in the mountain, forming a “V” shape. The roads are linked thanks to a gallery and are often formed by large stone steps. The Feast of San Mauro, the patron, is very nice with the traditional “cente” that is oval baskets filled with candles, flowers, and ribbons as a homage to the Saint (11th July)."
