        "text": "Literary, artistic, philosophical and cultural movement\n\nThe Empathic Movement (Italian: La Scuola Empatica / Empatismo) is a literary, artistic, philosophical and cultural movement[1][2][3] founded in the South of Italy in 2020[1][4] within the 'New Cultural Triangle of Ancient Cilento':[5] Omignano - \"The Aphorisms Village\",[6] Salento - \"The Poetry Village\",[7][8][9] Vallo della Lucania - \"Seat of Contemporary Arts Centre\".[10][11][12][13][14][15] From this first Triangle the Cultural Pyramid of Cilento was born to represent the enlarged epicenter of the Movement with 25 villages involved which joined with a new cultural identity and signing a protocol agreement.[16]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nThe symbolic myth of the movement[17] is called Unus:[18] an unknown demigod (son of Zeus and of a mortal woman) representing the Total Artist killed, torn to pieces and thrown into the Alento (Campania) river by his brothers, determining the old separation of the Arts.[19][20] As highlighted by Giacomo Maria Prati, with the figure of Unus we are assisting at a return to the myth. A new figurative Greek character invented by Lerro using the literary device of the dream.[21] One of the proposal of the Movement is keeping searching for the symbolic figure of a Total Artist in the contemporary age: a single person or a combination of contributions by people engaged in different cultural fields. For this reason the Movement apply to the Art the principles of the indivisibility and interdisciplinarity and asks artists to join and even to work together when it can be useful. Furthermore they support the overcoming of the Western scientific-specialized model and, therefore, the logical-rational approach. Moreover they reject the principles of an \"unambiguous vision\" of the \"truth\" and on the other hand, they support the principles of the \"point of view\" and \"fragmentation\". The movement promote the development of emotional intelligence through the arts and of the arts and culture through emotions.[22]\n\nThe founder, the Italian poet Menotti Lerro, asked several noted artists to sign the “Empathic Manifesto”, to join in their peculiar expression of the “Arts” in a less individualistic way and also to react in that moment to a very difficul period for the world due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the consequent deep physical and psychological closure. As Lerro affirmed: \"Society needed again the figure of the artist as guide\"; the journalist Roberto Guidetti answered declaring that the Empathic Movement was really born in the perfect moment to give a direction to all people in that new tragic situation.[23][24] However, since 2019 a new growing group of joined artists started to help create a new cultural pole in Southern Italy, giving life first to the “Contemporary Arts Centre” in the Cilento area, which has invented \"The Poetry Village\", \"The Aphorisms Village\" and The Cilento Poetry Prize, giving light to new territory in terms of culture. The decentralization of culture gives voice to the silent masses of Cilento especially the peasant ones in the mountains, with a peculiar emphasis on intense and genuine emotion and feelings to share with others through Arts, refusing individualism, social exclusion, excesses of competition among artists and also rejecting the large phenomenon of plagiarism mainly due to the mass media and internet in particular.[25][1][26] The official slogan of the Movement used by Menotti Lerro is \"Be Empathic!\" (in Italian: \"Sii Empatico!\").[27]\n\nSince 2019 the Movement had its own seats (Centro Contemporaneo delle Arti, with the poet Franco Loi as Honorary President[28]) both in Cilento and in Milan to organize its events.[29] In the same year the artist and academic Marco Baudinelli from Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara created the logotype of the Centro Contemporaneo delle Arti.[30] Still in 2019 the official Manifesto[31] written by Menotti Lerro and Antonello Pelliccia was launched before at the literary Caffè Giubbe Rosse in Florence,[31] after at the Brera Academy of Milan[32] and later at the Central Library, Edinburgh in Scotland.[33] About the Manifesto it is important to say it was first conceived as an oral speech in occasion of the foundation of the Contemporary Centre of Arts; this discourse was defined as \"New Manifesto\" by the philosopher Remo Bodei.[34] Lerro explained it also in his article published on the daily newspaper Affari Italiani. In addition he affirmed he would never have written a classical manifesto in the contemporary age because it would have been limiting.[35][36] Regarding the Manifesto the musician Franco Mussida stressed the importance of this new vision, claiming that \"it is very rare nowadays to meet people feeling art as a mission to tell about its essence\".[37] In addition, the literary critic Francesco D'Episcopo affirmed that the Manifesto is \"like a central nucleus of a cultural planning\".[38]\n\nIn 2020 the first official volume of the Movement, La Scuola Empatica, with the first one hundred adherents, also defined Empathic Masters, was published in Italy and in Italian language by the publisher Ladolfi, established in Novara.[39] In the volume are also published the main movement proposals \"to combat the stagnation of hypertrophic contemporary individualism\". The same were published months later on the Italian literary magazine \"Riscontri\".[40] In the volume the poet Giampiero Neri explains how the movement developed and in addition asks to \"all people having the same principles, to join to them\".[41] Moreover, the poet Vivian Lamarque invited all artists to \"trace their own centimeter\" affirming that they are \"little voices / for a great choir\".[42] In addition, the Italian poet Elio Pecora interrogate the readers asking if \"empathy\" is really a gift only belonging to the human beings, explaining, immediately afterwards, that in his experience animals have always been very empathic with him much more than humans and in particular than poets.[43] The Italian Television 7 Gold invited Menotti Lerro to explain the importance of the Movement in particular in that difficult Pandemic period.[23]\n\nIn 2021, in occasion of the European Heritage Days, the Soprintendenza of Salerno e Avellino stressed how the Empathic School was the third School started in the Province of Salerno. The previous two were the Eleatic School and Schola Medica Salernitana.[44][45][46][47][48] According to the Soprintendenza of Salerno and Avellino the union of these three schools determined the birth of a macro cultural triangle of the Salerno's Province.[49] In relation to the latter topic, the literary critic Francesco D'Episcopo from Federico II University of Naples, wrote an article titled \"Scuola Eleatica, Scuola Medica, Scuola Empatica: il triangolo culturale del territorio salernitano, da Parmenide a Lerro\" (In English: \"Eleatic School, Medical School, Empathic School: the cultural triangle of the Salerno area, from Parmenides to Lerro\").[50] The 10th of August, Salento Cilento \"The Poetry Village\" put on the wall of its square the first Cultural Pyramid of Cilento.[26] In the same year The Biblioteca Città di Arezzo invited Menotti Lerro to present the Movement.[51]\n\nIn 2022 the Cilento Poetry Prize, flagship of the Movement, got financed by Ministero della Cultura.[52] That year the Giambattista Vico Foundation announced to have joined to the movement.[53] In the same period Piano Vetrale known as \"The Village of Murales\" announced to put on the wall of its main square the Cultural Pyramid of Cilento;[54] in addition the village named Roccadaspide offered a new site to the Movement and fixed on the wall of the \"Crescella\" square the same Cultural Pyramid.[55] In Paestum the Italian poet Franco Arminio presented the Empathic Movement.[56] In the November 2022 the \"Museo Eleousa\" of San Mauro Cilento inaugurate its Cultural Pyramid.[57]\n\nIn 2023 the Italian musician Stefano Pantaleoni, from Parma Conservatory Arrigo Boito, composed the official anthem of the Empathic Movement.[58][16] On the 26th of January at the \"Circolo della Stampa di Avellino\" a conference, about the new Movement, based on the Special Edition dedicated to it from the Magazine \"Riscontri\", was organized.[59] Furthermore the first volume about the Movement in English language was published in England with the title The Empathic Movement.[60] A section of the volume was dedicated to the \"Empathic Masters\" who adhered to the Movement.

As stressed by Andrea Caruso for rainews, the new Mayor, Michele Santoro, ordered without consulting anyone and without any official document approved, to destroy with pickaxes the poetic tiles with unpublished overwritten verses dedicated from all the winners of the Cilento Poetry Prize to the Cilento's territory. The case was quickly stigmatized by the national press like a regrettable and uncivilized act.[91][92][93][94] In an interview with Francesco Sampogna, Menotti Lerro asked to the Mayor Michele Santoro to give his resignation.[95] In addition the poet Davide Rondoni sent a letter to Il Mattino to express all his indignation for the mayor's reckless decision.[96] Moreover Pasquale Scaldaferri, a journalist of rainews, stressed how the complete outrage was nowadays impossible to imagine in our society, expecially after the shame happened with the destruction of art to Palmyra in 2013.[93] The journalist and poet Ottavio Rossani on the poetry blog of the Corriere della Sera asked \"Who are these people who are destroying the wonderful and deep work made in years by the poet Menotti Lerro to change his historical rural land in a land of poetry and high culture?\"[92] In the while time, on Tuesday the 16th of July, in England the Cambridge Scholars Publishing published the paperback edition of the volume The Empathic Movement. Moreover, the day after, Menotti Lerro inaugurated a new literary column with the title \"Il Foglio Empatico\" (in English: \"The Empathic Sheet\") for the online newspaper \"Il Quotidiano di Salerno\". In his first article Lerro interrogated the Mayor of Omignano Cilento (\"Il Paese degli Aforismi\")[97] asking if he still wished to support the project or not, accusing the same Mayor, Raffaele Mondelli, to never invest money in culture and in particular to not promote the \"aphoristic village\".[98] On the 19th of July the official Website of Roccadaspide (with Gabriele Iuliano as Mayor) announced that the 30 artistic canvases painted and showing poems hand written by Menotti Lerro some years ago, will constitute a permanent exhibition in Piazza Crescella in a dedicated room.[99] On Monday the 22th of July, talking to Radio Lombardia, the actor Mario Pirovano, well known for his work on the theatre of Dario Fo and Franca Rame, on the occasion of the awarding of the prize received in Peschici, the \"Trabucco Prize-2024\", talked of the importance of the Empathic Movement in his life in particular, Pirovano affirmed, because has given him new stimuli in the last years.[100] On the 19th of July Professor Francesco D'Episcopo from University of Naples Federico II sent an open letter to the new Mayor of Salento Cilento (\"The Poetry Village\") to remind him about his painted and hand written tile on the City hall's wall... and how much Menotti Lerro worked to bring Cilento to be known and respectable in the World;[101] On the 20th of July, the Director of the \"Museo del Somaro\" of Gualdo Tadino, Nello Teodori, with an official letter announced its adherence to the Empathic Movement.[102] On Tuesday the 23th of July the newspaper \"Il Quotidiano di Salerno\" published the second \"Empathic Sheet\" of Menotti Lerro. In the end of the article, stressing the ostracism they gave him, Lerro invited \"all artists and people of the world to resist to the brutal sentiments circulating nowadays in our society, and, furthermore, he added some \"points of no return\". In particular he affirmed that the International Cilento Poetry Prize will never be organized again in Salento Cilento (\"The Poetry Village\") as long as the present administration will be in command; in another key point he declared that he will never organize again a cultural event in Omignano Cilento (\"The Aphorisms Village\") as long as the present administration will be in command.[103] On the \"Empathic Sheet N°3\" Menotti Lerro praised all the Mayors of the Cilento's territory helping the Empathic Movement to develop its epicenter (the Cultural Pyramid of Cilento).[36] On the 1th of August the Empathic Masters, the Italian lecture Giuseppe Sica and Spanish Art Critic Rosa María Román Garrido, assisted their own territories, Orria Cilento and Cocentaina, to sign a twinning agreement in name of the Seventeenth-century painter Paolo De Matteis.
