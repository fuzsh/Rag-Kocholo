        "text": "Made from organically grown Aglianico grapes, this Italian Rosato has red berry and citrus notes. Crisp and bright, it’s an ideal match to seafood and spicy dishes.\n\nThe grapes are very gently pressed and then fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks. Magliano Vetere is the name of a small town near one of the San Salvatore vineyards. The word Vetere comes from the Latin word “vetus”, which means “old”.\n\nVarietals: 100% Aglianico"
