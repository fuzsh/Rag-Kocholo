        "text": "🤔 The Food2030 Networks Conference: Do incremental innovations delay progress to more systemic innovations that lead to fundamental change, or can the sum of many small incremental innovations build up to a larger systemic innovation? 💡 For FUSILLI, focusing on the 'transformation of the urban food system', this is an important question. When looking at all the individual activities we carry out in our Living Labs, they seem small. However, representing FUSILLI as a whole, these incremental changes are enough to make a shift in the small scope that make it easier to move the 'larger mountains' in food systems in the EU-wide context. \"There is a need for purposeful data sharing rather than sharing for the sake of sharing without knowing who will use it.\" - was a particularly interesting insights coming from the session \"Innovation, Data, Digital Tools, and Sustainability Assessment\". By sharing data with purpose, we can make sure that valuable data doesnt become lost in the crowd, and are user-friendly enough to be used in practice. Read further for more insights gained from the conference 👉 https://lnkd.in/e_fsvxG5 A nod of appreciation to FUSILLI partners present at the conference: Julia Pinedo Gil, Diego Fallah, Danielle Wilde, Elisabetta Luzzi, Lucia Hörner, Nina Isabella Moeller, Patricia Hernandez Lelli, and Oya Tabanoğlu! #FOOD2030 #sustainablefood #foodinnovation #foodsystems\n\n🇪🇺 📊 FoodTech looks really different in leading European ecosystems! We used DigitalFoodLab's database of European FoodTech deals to compare where the money was going for Europe's five leading ecosystems for 2023 and the first half of 2023. As you can see, they are super diverse, without a lot in common between them. 1 - The UK, France, and Germany have very diverse ecosystems: each with a leading category and a couple of followers: - The UK: food science, and more specifically brands (from pet food to beverages) is leading with more than half of the total funding. - Germany: delivery remains strong (it seems that quick-commerce deals are still a thing). - France: AgTech, notably animal feed (insects) with strong foodservice and supply chain chain categories. 2 - The Netherlands have an ecosystem highly concentrated on Delivery (and a single unicorn, Picnic) and on AgTech (more diverse). 3 - Switzerland: the country appeared on the radars last year due to a single huge deal ($325M) in Atlas Agro, a bioinputs (AgBiotech). Beyond that, the ecosystem is quite small, and wouldn’t be here. 👉 If you want to access to the full report on the state of the European ecosystem (70+ pages full of insights and data, ask for the link in the comments) #graphs #foodtech #agtech #europe\n\n𝙈𝙚𝙚𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙩𝙚𝙖𝙢, 𝙢𝙚𝙚𝙩 𝙂𝙚𝙧𝙩-𝙅𝙖𝙣🎤 Since early 2023, Gert-Jan van Heusden has been working at Royal Brinkman as an innovation specialist. Gert-Jan is athletic, musical and the connector of team Innovation. Let's have a chat with him: 𝙏𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝙢𝙚, 𝙬𝙝𝙤 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪? I am Gert-Jan van Heusden, 23 years old, married to Hanneke and living in beautiful Bommelerwaard. I am innovation specialist in cultivation at team Innovation. 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙬𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙙𝙚𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙧𝙤𝙡𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣 𝙍𝙤𝙮𝙖𝙡 𝘽𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙠𝙢𝙖𝙣? I am a connector. I do this by connecting other companies to Royal Brinkman, as well as connecting colleagues and specialists to team innovation. I also try to make our growers enthusiastic about our latest innovations to ensure that their development is accelerated so they can apply the innovations in a profitable and sustainable way. 𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙙𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙚𝙣𝙟𝙤𝙮 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠? The combination of cultivation and technology. That's why it's cool to contribute to the transition to data-driven cultivation by leading innovation projects that make this possible. 𝙒𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙝 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙟𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙙 𝙤𝙛? On the development of cameras under the spray boom. These are cameras which are attached to the existing spray boom, so the grower has a view of his entire greenhouse. By analysing the photos, we know which pests are where in the greenhouse. 𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙨 𝙞𝙣 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙛𝙞𝙚𝙡𝙙? The number of drugs that can be used is shrinking sharply every year. This makes it essential that diseases and pests can be recognised and monitored at an early stage. 𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙨 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙬𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙮 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙤𝙥 𝙤𝙛? The trend of collecting data, analysing the data through an AI model and then attaching a conclusion and subsequent follow-up action to it.

A lot of new research is done here. We attend these studies and try to steer them in such a way that they benefit the grower. #meettheteam #teamroyalbrinkman #team\n\nThrilled to share some highlights from my incredible time at the #FutureFoodTech Conference in Chicago! 🌍🚀 1. Innovative Conversations: Had the opportunity to engage with some truly innovative companies making strides in the food tech sector. Their creativity and passion are paving the way for a sustainable future! 🌱🤝 2. Consumer Acceptance: We dove deep into discussions about consumer acceptance, exploring what it takes to bring new tech from the lab to the table. Understanding consumer needs is key! 🍽️💡 3. Cultivated Meat Commercialization: Tackled the vital conversations around the challenges and opportunities in expediting the commercialization of cultivated meat. 🥩 4.

Endless Networking: Engaged in countless conversations throughout the conference, each adding valuable insights and fostering collaborative opportunities. 🗣️🤗 Thank you to all who joined and contributed to the discussions. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in food technology! 🌟🌐 #FoodTech #FoodInnovation #SustainableFuture #alternativeproteins\n\n🗓 Did you know that the 29 September is a special day for FOODRUS #H2020 Project ⁉ 🔔 It is an important date because today is the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, that seeks to promote awareness and collective action to reduce food loss and waste. 🇪🇺 The European Commission set up ambitious goals by 2030 to reduce food losses by 10% when processing and manufacturing and by 30% per capita and food services, restaurants and households. 🎯 To contribute to achieve these goals, the FOODRUS project is developing innovative solutions to help measuring and reducing FLW such as the The Food Loop App. This tool will show you the amount of 🍽 food wasted, the nutritional value, 👣 the avoided carbon footprint and 💦 the water saved! What are you waiting for to try it for free and become a #FoodWasteWarrior! ➡ https://lnkd.in/eu8EDxhM #FoodWasteEU #FLWDay #IDAFLW #foowaste #foodloss #farmtofork #sustainablefood #foodwastereductand #wasteframeworkdirective #EuropeanComission DeustoTech - Deusto Institute of Technology | European Research Executive Agency (REA) | ACR+ | Association of Cities and Regions for sustainable Resource management | AIN - Navarra Industrial Association | Basque Culinary Center | Correos | Consorcio EDER | ELIKA Fundazioa | Florette Ibérica | Eroski | Pablo Solano (Hazi) | @Ayuntamiento de Zamudio | Københavns Universitet - University of Copenhagen | Hørkram Foodservice A/S | Jespers Torvekøkken | Slovenská pol'nohospodárska univerzita v Nitre | Free Food - Jedlo pre všetkých, o.z. | @TBS | @NEW EDU | West Regional Development Agency - West RDA | Municipality of Chalandri | @Nébih | Plovdiv Chamber of Commerce and Industry | Business Upper Austria - OÖ.
