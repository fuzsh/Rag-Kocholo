        "text": "Infrared heaters from Star Progetti are an optimal solution for heating greenhouses and nurseries. Infrared radiation heating is not only the most environmentally friendly but also the healthiest heating solution. No additional C02 is emitted into the air compared to traditional thermo-hydraulic and gas systems, as there is no combustion. Furthermore, by not generating additional humidity and condensation, the proliferation of moulds, fungi and bacteria in the air is not stimulated, reducing the need for fungicides.\n\nHELIOS RADIANT heaters are used on farms to provide heat for chickens, calves, pigs, etc. during the winter period.\n\nStar Progetti heaters do not heat the air directly, but imitate the heating effect of the sun’s rays. ​\n\nTherefore, in buildings and barns with open or highly ventilated areas, young or newly born animals can grow in optimal conditions.\n\nStudies carried out with partner breeders and growers all over the world have shown how the use of Star Progetti’s electric infrared heaters, instead of traditional thermo-hydraulic systems, allows a drastic reduction in the concentration of air humidity and CO2.\n\nThe resulting lower spread of mould, fungus and bacteria inside the bedding, allows for a more natural and healthy environment, ACCELERATING THE GROWTH OF FARMED CATTLE, reducing the onset of pathologies and lowering the mortality rate.\n\nFurthermore, compared to infrared quartz heaters, which have reduced heating power and must be placed close to the animals, Star Progetti heaters are much more powerful and can be mounted on the wall or hung at a safe distance from the animals, creating a large and effective heat zone.\n\nStar Progetti’s equine solariums are the only wall-mounted solariums that do not have a superstructure, designed specifically to fully envelop horses in relaxing infrared heat that dries them completely.\n\nEffective for horses and ponies of all sizes, they are perfect for heating, therapy and rapid drying of the legs and belly.\n\nIn fact, compared to common equine solariums which, due to their structure, tend to provide heat only on the horse’s back, the Star Progetti equine solarium allows the entire body of the horse to be heated, including the legs and belly.\n\nFurthermore, the absence of frames or superstructures allows easy access for staff and provides freedom for the horse."
