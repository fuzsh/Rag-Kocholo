        "text": "The Fashion Panorama – The Italian New Wave project, promoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, curated by Vogue Italia, and dedicated to the new generation of Italian designers, made a stop in Los Angeles. On May 21, the exhibition opened at the Italian Cultural Institute in Westwood and will run until September, featuring creations from ten emerging Italian brands: ACT N°1, Cormio, Gisèle Claudia Ntsama, Lessico Familiare, Magliano, Marco Rambaldi, Medea, Niccolò Pasqualetti, Panconesi, and SSHEENA.\n\nThe inauguration provided an opportunity to explore fashion as a reflection of cultural and social changes in Italy and the USA. This was further discussed in a panel featuring curator Emanuele Coccia, a professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, and TJ Walker, a professor at the Los Angeles Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and co-founder of the historic brand Cross Colours. The panel was moderated by Elisa Pervinca Bellini, New Talents & Sustainability Editor of Vogue Italia.\n\n“Fashion is experiencing significant growth in Los Angeles, which can now be considered the fifth capital of the industry alongside Milan, Paris, New York, and London,” said Emanuele Amendola, Director of the Italian Cultural Institute in Los Angeles. “Fashion Panorama showcases ten innovative Italian designers who are creating new expressive codes, focusing on themes like gender, inclusivity, and sustainability. They engage in a dialogue with the tradition that has made ‘Made in Italy’ famous worldwide, reinterpreting and adapting it to their unique visions,” Amendola concluded.\n\n“As one cannot talk about art solely by mentioning Picasso, we must also highlight those who are shaping fashion today, the younger generation. I hope this project encourages the promotion of designers who are making the most interesting experiments and embracing change,” philosopher Emanuele Coccia explained to L’Italo-Americano. Coccia’s research focuses on nature, art, and fashion, and he was the driving force behind this initiative.\n\nWhat changes are we talking about?\n\nThere is a clear transformation in the concept of Made in Italy, which has traditionally been associated with names that brought glory to Italian fashion, like Armani, Fendi, Valentino, Krizia, Dolce & Gabbana, and Gucci. These brands have become global icons but embody a form of humanity that no longer exists. This new generation includes designers with diverse ethnic backgrounds, such as Luca Lin of ACT N.1, who grew up between China and Italy, Jezabelle Cormio,an Italian-American, and Gisèle Claudia Ntsama, of Cameroonian origin. They represent a much more multi-ethnic and hybrid culture than previous generations.\n\nWhat stories do these new generations tell?\n\nThey tell completely different stories; their ideal audience is not the upper Milanese bourgeoisie of the 1980s. It is a demographic that is, perhaps, still underrepresented. This generation has redefined elegance and silhouettes, creating designs that are more fragmented and composite, breaking away from recent fashion history. They also embrace contradictions, celebrating diverse body forms and establishing a different relationship with materials.\n\nFor example?\n\nOne designer, Gisèle Claudia Ntsama, works extensively with hemp, while others focus on recycling and re-purposing used clothes. They present collections aimed at older and differently-abled people, introducing a range of techniques and aesthetics not traditionally associated with Made in Italy. They speak to a segment of humanity that Italy has yet to fully embrace but which represents a significant portion of the population.\n\nHow long has this new generation of fashion been emerging?\n\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint exact timelines. Globally, fashion has changed dramatically due to geopolitical shifts. New regions, such as Africa and especially China, are emerging as creative hubs that are arguably more interesting than what has been happening in Italy, Europe, or the United States. These designers are pioneers in a new commercial landscape, inventing a new form of globalization. Fashion, by nature, cannot be a purely local expression; otherwise, it becomes mere folklore.\n\nWhy is fashion still considered superficial?\n\nThere’s a problem with education; fashion is perhaps the only artistic discipline not taught in standard faculties. There are very few history of fashion courses, and the existing schools are highly specialized and career-focused rather than culture-focused. Moreover, fashion houses themselves struggle to view themselves as cultural institutions. For instance, Chanel has a heritage that has liberated women for more than one generation. The fact that these legacies are kept secret for pseudo-industrial reasons is problematic; these treasures should be made public. Imagine if all painting collections were hidden for fear of being copied.\n\nWhen did you start getting interested in fashion?\n\nMy interest began partly due to family influences; one branch of my family works in fashion, while the other branch condemns it. When I explored what my cousins were doing, I found it fascinating. Then, when I arrived in Paris, I was fortunate to become close friends with Azzedine Alaïa, a great couturier, and Carla Sozzani, a significant figure in fashion culture over the past 40 years. They introduced me to this world, and now a fashion show impacts me deeply, both physically and emotionally, because it’s like seeing a work of art in motion.\n\nYou recently presented your book, La Vita delle Forme, at the Turin Book Fair, written with former Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, a treatise on the alchemy of life forms. How did this collaboration come about?\n\nWe met through Alessandro’s partner, a professor of urban architectural theory, and became friends. The idea for the book emerged because one of Alessandro’s innovations was to accompany Gucci’s fashion shows with philosophical reflections. As a philosopher who studies fashion, it was important for me to discuss fashion as a primary subject of philosophy, because it is the medium through which a form comes to life. There’s nothing more philosophical than that. We talked about it for a year and a half, and from these conversations, the book was born."
