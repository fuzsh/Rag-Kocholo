        "text": "The Story\n\nThis wine takes its name from Magliano Vetere, a small town in the Cilento National Park near San Salvatore's Cannito vineyards where the organic grapes used to make this wine are grown.\n\nProducer Story\n\nSan Salvatore combines the environmentally conscious with both tradition and technology to achieve modern wines of character. Driven by biodynamic farming, winemaker Giuseppe Pagano utilizes several unique plots of grapes strewn across the Campania region of Southern Italy. It is there that he produces wines made from native varieties such as Falanghina, Fiano, Greco and Aglianico. Among the historic vineyards, San Salvatore is flanked by olive groves, crops, and an infamous herd of water buffalo. All of these parts come together to form the biodiverse, sustainability-focused wines of Cilento.\n\nProducer Story\n\nSan Salvatore combines the environmentally conscious with both tradition and technology to achieve modern wines of character.
