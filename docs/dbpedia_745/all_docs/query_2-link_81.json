For myself i have a better understanding of what is most important to a student and what keeps the student/students motivated and excited about learning English. The two videos gave a very clear difference between what works and what doesn't work. The videos showed me that one needs precise and clear pronunciation, a caring attitude, patience, and a friendly personality.

Here Below you can check out the feedback (for one of our units) of one of the 16.000 students that last year took an online course with ITTT!\n\nUnit 1 begins with a look at what makes a good teacher, making the statement, 'A (good) teacher really cares about his/her teaching, but cares even more about the learning of the students.' As the unit unfolds the key to this assertion is revealed. It deals firstly with the roles of the teacher. For me, this was a brilliantly useful discussion which set out clearly and concisely the ways in which a teacher should approach a class. It outlined nine roles (Manager and Controller, Organizer, Assessor, Prompter, Participant, Tutor, Resource and Facilitator, Model, and Observer and Monitor) which cover every aspect of teaching behavior, explaining the strengths of the application, and their weaknesses or restrictions. Absorbing this section gave me a real sense of what is required of a good teacher, how many factors there are to consider, and instilled in me the confidence to recognize a class or student's needs and to handle them appropriately. The unit progresses to explore the learners. It outlines points for consideration (age, learning experience, motivation, nervousness, language awareness, behavior problems ,life experience, language level, and culture and first language. Each of these demonstrate that the teacher should not only be concerned with his/her teaching methods and skills but with the nature of each student. I now know that the more in tune a teacher is to the students' needs, the more effective they will be in applying the best approach to teaching them.\n\nTeach English in Atrani - TEFL Courses\n\nDo you want to be TEFL or TESOL-certified in Salerno?

People absorb languages either fast or slow not only because of the way there were brought up but also from there own experiences in life. you need to be able to learn to handle all sorts of experiences so as to get your students the attention they are needing to learn. What I have learned from this lesson is basically what I expected that a good teacher must be fair have knowledge of all her subjects and you have to learn how to motivate the student.\n\nTeach English in Auletta - TEFL Courses\n\nDo you want to be TEFL or TESOL-certified in Salerno?

The teacher needs to learn a variety of roles in order to effectively assist language learners. The issues of motivation, age, life experience, levels of English knowledge and ability, culture and self-confidence were all considered in relation to learners. One helpful point was that teachers need to care more about their students than about teaching, even though love of teaching is a valuable trait. Another helpful observation was that asian students may be reticent to communicate in class because culturally they are taught to respect the teacher by listening attentively and not speak unless directly addressed by the teacher.\n\nTeach English in Baronissi - TEFL Courses\n\nDo you want to be TEFL or TESOL-certified in Salerno?

I think the most important is that a teacher loves to teach ofcourse you need a good subject knowledge. But if you can share your knowledge and you love to teach it is quit easy to be lively and entertaining. The teachers attitude can and will likely motivate the student! In that case you will have (adult or young learner) students that want to participate!

It is important that students can and want to participate so you have to be carefull with the \"Controller roll\"\".\n\nTeach English in Bellosguardo - TEFL Courses\n\nDo you want to be TEFL or TESOL-certified in Salerno?

I believe becoming a good teacher is to be accountable to the students rather than just showing off what the teacher would know. I had experiences as a camp counselor and a Sunday School teacher as part of being someone to teach and lead. These experiences helped me to know how I can become better to be a leader of the classroom or group. The title of the teacher should not be given just out of respect, but someone that he or she could confidently look up to when the time is needed. This session has greatly reflected upon my past experience of teaching and what I should look upon when I would be able to teach English in different countries. As I look through more in this unit, I even reflected not only what I know how to become a good teacher, but what points that are being a bad teacher as well. I know there were some times when I regretted of the choices I made when I was a teacher or counselor. But because of the bitter past, I would be able to learn my mistakes. I know I will never be a greatest teacher in the world but I do try to just become a teacher to do good and right way of teaching. The teacher should also learn about the students. There are some students that will do either good or bad in the class but this reason should not stop teachers to be more encouraging even if there are failures in the way. There is always a way to motivate students to learn better. Motivation comes from both the student and the teacher. As long there is hope and going on a path to show that given up is not an option, then surely there is a way to become better at something.

One of the biggest things I learned from this is that it is important to care about teaching, but what comes first is the student and their learning. I think it would be impossible to be a good teacher without putting the students first. Another thing addressed in this unit was factors that make students good learners (i.e.: desire to learn, willingness to ask questions) as well as the factors that come into play such as age, culture and language levels which alter the ways in which students behave and influences their motivation to learn as well as connect to class material through their own life experiences. I think it is important for a teacher to consider students and their different levels of language as it helps to make sure that their teaching material is at the proper level and not too advanced or too repetitive.\n\nTeach English in Cannalonga - TEFL Courses\n\nDo you want to be TEFL or TESOL-certified in Salerno?
