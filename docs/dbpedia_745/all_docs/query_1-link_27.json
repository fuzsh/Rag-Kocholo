        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis is the first study to demonstrate that the incidence of inappropriate shocks in S-ICD patients can be significantly reduced by adequate device programming in clinical practice. Specifically, the standardized programming proposed by the UNTOUCHED study,2 with high-rate cut-offs for discrimination, performed better than various programming strategies involving lower cut-offs. We also showed that, in clinical practice, there has been a trend in recent years towards the wider adoption of optimized programming.\n\nObservational studies have confirmed the overall efficacy and safety of S-ICD1–3 and the positive patient acceptance.10 Moreover, randomized trials and meta-analysis demonstrated that the S-ICD is non-inferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to device-related complications and inappropriate shocks,4 and superior with respect to lead-related complications4,5,11 However, S-ICD therapy is less established than transvenous ICD therapy, with all the consequent limitations. Indeed, S-ICD implanters display a learning curve with respect to implant-related complications12 and new implantation techniques.9 Moreover, different anesthesia/analgesia approaches13 have been proposed, and improvements in S-ICD device technology have been shown to reduce the rate of inappropriate shocks.14 Moreover, an analysis from the S-ICD Clinical Investigation (IDE Trial) demonstrated that the addition of a second shock zone with an active discrimination algorithm was strongly associated with a reduction in inappropriate shocks and did not result in prolongation of detection times or increased syncope.6 Subsequently, the authors of the UNTOUCHED study proposed standardized programming with discrimination algorithms active from 200 to 250 bpm, and demonstrated that its use could reduce the rate of inappropriate shock in the S-ICD2 population. The UNTOUCHED programming modality is consistent with the high rates and relatively long-detection durations used for transvenous ICDs in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduce Inappropriate Therapy (MADIT-RIT), which demonstrated marked reductions in inappropriate therapies and mortality15 and established this programming as optimal. As recommended in consensus documents for primary prevention patients,16 such programming is now part of the standard of care for transvenous devices and, according to Gold et al.,2 it should also be adopted routinely in S-ICD patients, in order to avoid unnecessary shocks. The present study revealed that this S-ICD programming approach has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice, and that most patients currently receive this device programming on implantation or, at the latest, on follow-up.\n\nOn comparing different programming approaches, we confirmed the effectiveness of the UNTOUCHED programming modality in reducing inappropriate shocks, without affecting therapy effectiveness. We recorded a one-year rate of inappropriate shocks of 3.0% with optimal programming. This result is in line with, or even better than, the UNTOUCHED study, which reported a similar rate (3.1%) of inappropriate shocks2 in a population 7 years older than ours. It also compares favorably with the annualized rate of 6.4% in patients with single-chamber and S-ICD devices reported in a meta-analysis,17 and with the 4.8% 1-year rate in the long-detection arm of the transvenous ICD cohort of the Avoid DeliVering TherApies for Non-sustained Arrhythmias in ICD PatiEnts III (ADVANCEIII).18 In the S-ICD, the detection rate, but not the duration, is programmable. The mean time from detection to shock is 15 s, i.e. slightly longer than in the delayed-therapy arm of MADIT-RIT.15 Early studies showed that, with S-ICDs, inappropriate shocks were most commonly due to T-wave oversensing. In the present analysis, this remained one of the most frequent etiologies of inappropriate therapies, involving 1.4% of the study cohort, in line with the data from the UNTOUCHED trial (1.6%).2 Nonetheless, our results revealed the general improvement in S-ICD performance over the years, which is mainly attributable to the evolution of discrimination algorithms. Indeed, in our study cohort, which included new-generation SMART Pass enabled devices only, the one-year inappropriate shock rate was 3.0% with and 4.6% without UNTOUCHED-like programming; this is lower than the 8.1% rate reported in the Evaluation oF Factors ImpacTing CLinical Outcome and Cost EffectiveneSS of the S-ICD (EFFORTLESS) registry,1 which included only 8% of SMART Pass enabled devices. In the UNTOUCHED trial the proportion of new-generation devices was 60%. In addition to the low rate, it should be noted that most inappropriate shocks in the present study were successfully managed by reprogramming the device, and only 4 (0.3%) necessitated system removal.\n\nIn addition to UNTOUCHED-like programming, clinical factors that were multivariable predictors of inappropriate shocks were: gender and history of atrial fibrillation. Among procedural and programming factors, a single passing vector on screening was also associated with a higher risk of inappropriate shocks, while no association was seen between inappropriate shocks and the adoption of the 2-incision technique. These results are at variance with previous findings of the UNTOUCHED study,2 which reported no association with the number of passing vectors on screening, but more inappropriate shocks with the 2-incision technique. Nevertheless, a recently published comparison between 2-incision and 3-incision technique from the S-ICD post-approval study19 corroborated our findings, since the authors found no difference in inappropriate therapies between study groups.\n\nThe present findings not only elucidate how the S-ICD should be used in order to obtain a better outcome, but also show that the achievable performance of the S-ICD is even better than that observed in the first trials, which suffered from the limitations of an immature technology and an amendable programming strategy.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe cultural achievements in ICD therapy, gained by transvenous ICD and earliest S-ICD clinical trials have impacted on the use of S-ICD in recent years, promoting an updated programming that favours high ventricular rate for arrhythmia detection. In new S-ICD recipients, this is done at the time of implantation, while in the case of pre-existing implants, it is done during follow-up. This behaviour has contributed significantly to reducing the incidence of inappropriate shocks in clinical practice."
