        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study, placing the S-ICD generator in the IM space instead of the standard SC pocket resulted in fewer device-related complications and composite endpoints of complication or inappropriate shock over a mid-term follow-up. This is a relevant finding in the light of the first and only randomized clinical trial comparing S-ICD and transvenous ICD, i.e. the PRAETORIAN study, that demonstrated the noninferiority of the S-ICD with respect to the same composite endpoint of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks.5 That study was initiated in 2011, when S-ICD therapy was in its early development stages. Subsequently, the existence of a learning curve for S-ICD implanters with respect to implant-related complications has been demonstrated,10 new implantation techniques,6,7 and anaesthesia/analgesia approaches11 have been proposed, improvements in S-ICD device technology have been shown to reduce the inappropriate shock rate.12 All these considerations make the PRAETORIAN results not fully extendable to the S-ICD therapy in current clinical practice. In particular, the IM technique, not tested in the PRAETORIAN study, is now the most frequently adopted in Europe.13,14 It has been shown to be safe and effective, to offer better cosmetic outcomes and shorter procedural times,6,15 to yield low PRAETORIAN scores and shock impedance values, indicating optimal defibrillation system position and a high probability of effective defibrillation.7 The results of the present analysis extend these findings, demonstrating a better safety profile of the S-ICD therapy in patients who received the generator in an IM position, thus confirming previous observations from one uncontrolled study.8 In the present study, we showed a reduction in the rate of the combined endpoint with the IM positioning of the generator, the rate at 1 year decreasing from 8.4 to 2.4%. This result well compares with the PRAETORIAN study5 that demonstrated a rate of 8% at 1 year in the S-ICD arm. In particular, the rate of device-related complications at 1 year was ∼4% among the S-ICDs in the PRAETORIAN study.5 Although there was no significant difference between S-ICD and transvenous ICD in overall device-related complications in the PRAETORIAN trial,5 a recent secondary analysis showed that complications in the transvenous ICD group were more severe as they required significantly more often an invasive intervention.16 The present analysis revealed a decrease in the rate of complications from 4.6% in the SC group to 1.0% in the IM group, demonstrating an even better safety profile of the S-ICD when new implantation techniques are adopted. The components that seem to have determined this result are a lower need for reinterventions aimed at improving defibrillation efficacy and shock impedance and fewer revisions for pocket infections or patient discomfort, in agreement with preliminary findings on the benefits of the IM technique for implantation of the S-ICD.6,7,15 The rate of inappropriate shocks at 1 year was 1.4% in the IM group and 4.2% in the SC group, well comparing with the S-ICDs of the PRAETORIAN study whose rate was ∼5%. Indeed, a novel sensing methodology, the SMART Pass, was implemented in new-generation devices to reduce inappropriate shocks.12 In the UNTOUCHED study, the rate of inappropriate shocks at 1 year was 3.1% in the overall population and as low as 2.4% when SMART Pass-enabled generators were considered.3 Our analysis did not show any interaction between baseline variables and the primary endpoint. This is particularly reassuring for the adoption of the S-ICD therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, which has been shown to be increasing in recent years.13\n\nLarge trials have documented high rates (above 90%) of successful conversion on defibrillation testing with S-ICDs.2,13,17,18 In the present study, we confirmed this finding, as we recorded a conversion rate of 98% with 65J shock energy. This also yielded a high rate of conversion of clinical ventricular arrhythmias during follow-up, regardless of the generator positioning. In the present study, we reported successful cardioversion in 89% of episodes with the first shock, and 100% final success. Our results are in agreement with previous findings. Indeed, in the S-ICD System Post-Approval Study,19 first shock efficacy was 91% and final efficacy was 100% at 1 year. In the UNTOUCHED Trial, first shock efficacy was 94% and the final conversion efficacy was 98% at 18 months.3 The same efficacy rates were recently reported in the PRAETORIAN study.20 In the Evaluation of Factors Impacting Clinical Outcome and Cost-effectiveness of the S-ICD (EFFORTLESS S-ICD) Registry, the first shock success rate over 5-year follow-up was 90% and the final efficacy was 98%.4\n\nLimitations\n\nThe limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, its observational design may have introduced an inherent bias. Minor events may have been underestimated to some extent. However, we exclude that this limitation may have introduced a bias in the comparison of the two groups. The propensity score matching method was employed in order to minimize baseline differences between groups; however, residual and unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. Second, the limited sample size of our matched cohort might have prevented us from observing significant differences in the association between implantation technique and outcomes in the overall population and across subgroups. Third, the relatively short follow-up might have limited the statistical power of the analysis and concealed differences between the groups."
