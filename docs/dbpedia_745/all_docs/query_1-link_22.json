        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this multicentre study, we evaluated the rate of IS and device-related complications during long-term follow-up in patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies who had undergone S-ICD implantation. The main findings are:\n\n1.\n\nOver a median follow-up of 43 months, IS occurred in 10% (3.5% at 12 months) of patients who received a modern device, with SMART Pass filter activated in most cases and high detection cut-off rates programmed. Non-cardiac oversensing was the leading cause of IS, suggesting the potentially positive effect of modern S-ICD in reducing IS due to TWOS.\n\n2.\n\nThe rate of IS at 12 months was higher in patients with cardiomyopathies than in those with channelopathies (4.6% vs. 1.1%), despite similar values over the entire follow-up period.\n\n3.\n\nPatients with ACM presented the highest rate of IS at 12 months (10.9%).\n\n4.\n\nDevice-related complications were reported in 12% of patients (1.8% at 12 months). Pocket and lead complications were few (1% and 1.1%, respectively), while premature battery depletion was the most common (8%) complication. The management of all device-related complications requiring surgical intervention was safe and effective.\n\n5.\n\nS-ICD was effective in terminating clinical VA, and we did not report a need for S-ICD explantation and TV-ICD reimplantation to ensure ATP therapy.\n\n6.\n\nThe need for anti-bradycardia pacing was low, occurring in 0.8% of patients.\n\nPatients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of patients at increased risk of SCD.1–10 The common denominators of patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies are younger age than the typical ICD population with coronary artery disease referred for primary or secondary prevention of SCD, no or minor comorbidities, and an active lifestyle.1–11 Young patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies have a predominantly arrhythmia-related prognosis and may survive for many decades and have nearly normal life expectancy thanks to the protection against SCD provided by the ICD,1–11 as confirmed by the low mortality rate observed in our study group (3% over a median follow-up of 43 months). In these patients, IS are frequently caused by either supraventricular tachycardia or abnormal sensing (due to T- or P-wave oversensing, lead fracture, or electromagnetic interference) and have the potential to reduce the patient’s quality of life and compromise the acceptance of ICD therapy. Accordingly, the risk/benefit ratio should be carefully assessed when considering ICD implantation for primary prevention, especially in patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, and a high priority should be given to preventing IS by means of adequate device selection, targeted device programming, and modern discriminating software.13,15–19,33–35 In a large meta-analysis by Nordkamp et al.,10 which comprised 4916 young TV-ICD patients with inherited arrhythmia diseases (IADs), the crude annual IS rate was 4.7% per year. More recently, device manufacturers have implemented technological improvements in order to reduce inappropriate ICD interventions; this has resulted in more effective models of device programming and improved arrhythmia detection algorithms.13,15–19 Indeed, a systematic review and meta-analysis reported an annual IS rate of 6.4%, which later progressively decreased over time and significantly dropped to 1.9% in one of the more recent studies.34 Recently, Auricchio et al.36 conducted a subanalysis of the PainFree SST Study in which they specifically assessed the rate of IS in patients with IADs who had received TV-ICD endowed with the SmartShock Technology. The authors found that, in patients with IAD, the annualized IS rate was 1.6%. The study had some limitations, i.e. the small sample; the incomplete spectrum of IADs in analysis, which did not include important diseases such as HCM, dilated cardiomyopathy, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and short-QT syndrome; and the use of a TV-ICD from a single manufacturer. However, it confirmed the continuous improvement of detection algorithms, which may have a major impact on the patient’s quality of life, especially that of young IAD patients, who will have ICDs for a much longer time.\n\nThe most common complication of the TV-ICD is long-term transvenous lead issues; the S-ICD avoids such problems. Observational studies have shown the overall efficacy and safety of the S-ICD over medium- and long-term follow-up, despite relatively high IS rates. However, S-ICD therapy has evolved over the years, and more recent data show that the use of high-rate cut-offs, modern S-ICD with modern electrogram filtering, and discrimination algorithms has significantly reduced IS rates; indeed, with modern devices, the reported rate is 2.4%/year, a figure even lower than that of TV-ICD with modern programming.13,15,17–19 However, data on the performance of the S-ICD in patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies are scant, excluding observations on specific patient groups.20–26 Moreover, there are concerns regarding the presence of ECG depolarization/repolarization abnormalities, which may trigger IS, and the inability to deliver ATP, which may be an effective ‘pain-free’ therapy.\n\nIn a previous study by Rudic et al.,22 which involved patients with various IADs (24 with BrS, 17 with IVF, 6 with LQTS, 1 with short-QT syndrome, 3 with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, 8 with HCM, and 3 with ACM) who had received an S-ICD, the IS rate was 3.2% over a median follow-up of 31.0 ± 14.2 months. In the Effortless study cohort of S-ICD patients with channelopathies, the incidence of IS was 8.5% over 3.2 years of follow-up and the annualized IS rate was lower among S-ICD patients than TV-ICD patients (2.7%/year vs. 3.8%year).20 In that study, most IS were caused by oversensing, principally cardiac oversensing (5.0%), including TWOS. In our patients with channelopathies, the IS rate was lower (1.1% at 12 months) than in the Effortless study,20 suggesting the potentially positive effect of the new-generation S-ICD in reducing IS due to TWOS.\n\nA more recent study by Kuschyk et al.21 assessed the long-term outcome of S-ICD patients in comparison with TV-ICD patients in a cohort of patients with IADs; a relatively low incidence of IS (1.9%/year) was observed, and no statistically significant differences emerged between S-ICD and TV-ICD patients (though the rate was lower in the S-ICD group: 1.4%/year vs. 2.5%/year). These findings may be explained by the fact that modern devices were used in most S-ICD patients and improved programming strategies in both types of devices. The relatively higher rate of IS in our study may be explained by the difference between the study populations, in that ours had a higher prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathies, HCM, and, especially, ACM which is historically associated with higher rates of IS.23,24,37 Indeed, our patients with ACM had the highest rate of IS.\n\nIn their meta-analysis, Auricchio and co-workers34 found that studies with longer mean follow-up had lower annualized IS rates. It is likely that some patients are at higher risk of IS than others and tend to experience events earlier, leaving a lower risk group to the later follow-up times. In order to allow comparisons between groups, we estimated the IS rate at 12 months and observed a higher rate in patients with cardiomyopathies. This difference was not confirmed over the entire follow-up period, probably for the same reason. Indeed, patients with channelopathies might manifest IS later, owing to the evolution of the ECG signal detected by the device.\n\nRegarding the causes of IS, non-cardiac oversensing was the leading cause in our population. This can certainly be explained by the SMART Pass filter of modern S-ICD, which attenuates cardiac oversensing and especially TWOS.15,16,18\n\nMost IS in the present study were successfully managed by reprogramming the device, without system revision, confirming previous findings.19 The number of patients who experienced IS recurrences did not appear to be high in both groups. In particular, both first therapies and recurrences seemed infrequent in patients with channelopathies after the second year.\n\nOverall, device-related complications that required revision were relatively infrequent, i.e. 12% over a median follow-up of 43 months (1.8% at 12 months), and were comparable among the different types of diseases. In comparison, the rate of device-related complications at 1 year was ∼4% among the S-ICDs in the PRAETORIAN study.12 Early battery depletion was the most frequent cause of system revision in our study. Indeed, in 2020, the EMBLEM S-ICD was subjected to a safety notification because of an increased risk of rapid battery depletion (Boston Scientific urgent field action REF.92400926-FA). In addition, 4.8% of the devices underwent normal battery depletion, being replaced after about 6–7 years, depending on the number of therapies delivered and in line with the generator projected longevity. The rates of pocket and lead complications were low. This can be ascribed to the fact that the pulse generator was most often implanted in the intermuscular space rather than in the traditional subcutaneous pocket and the two-incision technique was used for lead deployment.31,32 Indeed, these approaches have recently been shown to result in fewer device-related complications and composite endpoints of complication or IS over medium-term follow-up.32\n\nLike other investigators,20,21,23 we observed a relatively low rate of appropriate shocks in S-ICD patients with cardiomyopathy and channelopathies. The high-rate cut-off programmed in S-ICDs and the multistep discriminative sensing algorithm may have reduced therapies, thus allowing many VA to self-terminate while still protecting against life-threatening VT/VF. Indeed, in previous studies, appropriate ICD intervention rates were lower in the S-ICD group than in the TV-ICD group, with no reduction in overall efficacy.20,21,23,38\n\nThe main potential limitation of the S-ICD is its inability to deliver ATP, which may be an effective ‘pain-free’ therapy in patients with structural heart diseases. In our study, no patients had the device removed because of a perceived need for ATP. Indeed, in TV-ICD patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, the availability of ATP therapy is not reported to result in fewer appropriate shocks.21 This may be explained by the fact that the majority of appropriate shocks in patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies is triggered by fast or polymorphic VT, which are less amenable to ATP.21 Thus, the decision of whether to implant an S-ICD in patients with structural cardiomyopathies needs to be patient-specific; indeed, the probability of lead-related complications, which are typically observed in TV-ICD patients, must be balanced with the likelihood of recurrent VT, which may be effectively pace-terminated.\n\nPossible strategies that could further reduce IS in patients with channelopathies and cardiomyopathies who receive modern S-ICDs are (i) thorough pre-implantation ECG screening and device programming with a high-rate cut-off (shock zone >250); (ii) targeting a surface ECG R-wave amplitude >1 mV and an appropriately high R/T and R/P amplitude ratio on implantation, which may allow better discrimination;39 (iii) tracking the sensed R-wave amplitude in various vectors at rest, during effort or Ajmaline challenge in BrS patients;40,41 (iv) considering patients with at least two suitable vectors, as the potential decline in R-wave amplitude during follow-up, especially in ACM patients, increases the risk of cardiac and/or non-cardiac oversensing;39 and (v) performing provocative tests at follow-up visit aiming for myopotential inducibility to select the optimal sensing vector.42\n\nLimitations\n\nThe limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, its observational and retrospective design may have introduced an inherent bias. Second, the small size of some groups did not allow us to accurately estimate the rate of endpoints or make direct comparison between groups. No direct comparison was made between TV-ICD and S-ICD nor between the traditional technique of S-ICD implantation and the intermuscular two-incision technique; however, this goes beyond the aim of the present study. Clearly, large randomized studies involving a predefined comparable cohort of patients with new-generation TV-ICDs endowed with updated discrimination algorithms and software would be needed in order to accurately define the clinical benefit or harm resulting from device choice. Despite our long follow-up, a relatively small number of events occurred, and this might have prevented us from identifying predictors. Finally, as all our procedures were performed by experienced operators, the results may not be widely applicable in less experienced centres. Despite these limitations, the data presented are unique in several ways and make an important contribution to the scant published data regarding the clinical performance of modern S-ICDs in patients with channelopathies and cardiomyopathies."
