Thus, major endeavors to understand the risk factors and pathogenesis of this disease have been undertaken. Reticular macular disease is a proposed subtype of age-related macular degeneration correlating histologically with subretinal drusenoid deposits located between the retinal pigment epithelium and the inner segment ellipsoid zone. Reticular lesions are more prevalent in females and in older age groups and are associated with a higher mortality rate. Risk factors for developing age-related macular degeneration include hypertension, smoking, and angina. Several genes related to increased risk for age-related macular degeneration and reticular macular disease are also associated with cardiovascular disease. Better understanding of the clinical and genetic risk factors for age-related macular degeneration and reticular macular disease has led to the hypothesis that these eye diseases are systemic. A systemic origin may help to explain why reticular disease is diagnosed more frequently in females as males suffer cardiovascular mortality at an earlier age, before the age of diagnosis of reticular macular disease and age-related macular degeneration.

Cross-sectional study. Fifty-two patients with choroidal neovascularization because of three different neovascular age-related macular degeneration subtypes were included in the study. Macular and peripheral fundus autofluorescence patterns of study subjects were compared in a masked fashion. Fundus autofluorescence patterns of all three neovascular age-related macular degeneration subtypes revealed similar patterns. However, peripapillary hypo-autofluorescence was more common among patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (88.2%) compared with patients with retinal angiomatous proliferation (12.5%) and patients without retinal angiomatous proliferation and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (21.1%) (P < 0.0001). Presence of peripapillary fundus autofluorescence defects in neovascular age-related macular degeneration maybe suggestive of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy as a variant of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe macular degeneration and aging study: Design and research protocol of a randomized trial for a psychosocial intervention with macular degeneration patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¶rensen, Silvia; White, Katherine; Mak, Wingyun; Zanibbi, Katherine; Tang, Wan; O'Hearn, Amanda; Hegel, Mark T\n\n2015-05-01\n\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible and predictable blindness among older adults with serious physical and mental health consequences. Visual impairment is associated with negative future outlook and depression and has serious consequences for older adults' quality of life and, by way of depression, on long-term survival. Psychosocial interventions have the potential to alleviate and prevent depression symptoms among older AMD patients. We describe the protocol of the Macular Degeneration and Aging Study, a randomized clinical trial of a psychosocial Preventive Problem-Solving Intervention. The intervention is aimed at enhancing well-being and future planning among older adults with macular degeneration by increasing preparation for future care. Adequate randomization and therapeutic fidelity were achieved. Current retention rates were acceptable, given the vulnerability of the population. Acceptability (adherence and satisfaction) was high. Given the high public health significance and impact on quality of life among older adults with vision loss, this protocol contributes a valid test of a promising intervention for maintaining mental and physical health in this population.

Patients with age-related macular degeneration, age-related eye disease study Categories 3 and 4, were recruited and underwent an 11-item questionnaire. The study included a total of 193 patients meeting the age-related eye disease study nutritional supplementation criteria (174 patients with age-related eye disease study Category 4 and 19 with Category 3). Seventy-seven (40%) were taking oral supplementation, 70 of whom (90%) 1 tablet/day. Oral supplementation was recommended by the personal ophthalmologist in 85 patients (44%), including all those currently receiving it. Eight patients of 85 (9.4%) rejected supplementation despite it being recommended, mostly because they were already taking other medicines. Ninety-four patients (48%) claimed they had not received any information from their ophthalmologist. Our data reveal that Italian patients with age-related eye disease study Categories 3 and 4 have a low adherence to nutritional supplementation. In 65% of cases, patients were not adequately informed by their ophthalmologist of the potential benefits of oral supplementation for age-related macular degeneration; indeed, 108 patients (56%) were not even aware such nutritional treatments are available. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the importance of giving advice to persons with age-related macular degeneration regarding the benefits of oral supplements.\n\nWet Macular Degeneration\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... has a hereditary component.

Chronic inflammation is closely linked to diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction, and age-related macular degeneration is accompanied by a general inflammatory response. According to current concept, age-related macular degeneration is a local manifestation of systemic vascular disease. This recognition could have therapeutic implications because restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize the condition of chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction by pharmaacological or non pharmacological interventions may prevent the development or improve endothelial dysfunction, which result in prevention or improvement of age related macular degeneration as well. Medicines including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and renin inhibitors), statins, acetylsalicylic acid, trimetazidin, third generation beta-blockers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, folate, vitamin D, melatonin, advanced glycation end-product crosslink breaker alagebrium, endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan, coenzyme Q10; \"causal\" antioxidant vitamins, N-acetyl-cysteine, resveratrol, L-arginine, serotonin receptor agonists, tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers, specific inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway, curcumin and doxycyclin all have beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Considering that the human vascular system is consubstantial, medicines listed above should be given to patients (1) who have no macular degeneration but have risk factors\n\nThe burden of age-related macular degeneration: a value-based analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, Melissa M; Brown, Gary C; Sharma, Sanjay; Stein, Joshua D; Roth, Zachary; Campanella, Joseph; Beauchamp, George R\n\n2006-06-01\n\nThe quality-of-life loss and the financial consequences associated with age-related macular degeneration are assessed. The quality-of-life loss associated with macular degeneration is markedly underestimated by the general public, nonophthalmic physicians, and ophthalmologists who treat patients with this condition. Mild age-related macular degeneration causes a 17% decrement in the quality of life of the average patient, similar to that encountered with moderate cardiac angina or symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus syndrome. Moderate age-related macular degeneration causes a 40% decrease in the average patient's quality of life, similar to that associated with severe cardiac angina or renal dialysis. Very severe age-related macular degeneration causes a large 63% decrease in the average patient's quality of life, similar to that encountered with end-stage prostatic cancer or a catastrophic stroke that leaves a person bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care. The return on investment is high for both treatment with current age-related macular degeneration therapies and the research costs invested in the development of age-related macular degeneration treatment modalities. Age-related macular degeneration is a major public health problem that has a devastating effect upon patients and marked adverse financial consequences for the economy.\n\nSelf-reported optometric practise patterns in age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nLy, Angelica; Nivison-Smith, Lisa; Zangerl, Barbara; Assaad, Nagi; Kalloniatis, Michael\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe use of advanced imaging in clinical practice is emerging and the use of this technology by optometrists in assessing patients with age-related macular degeneration is of interest. Therefore, this study explored contemporary, self-reported patterns of practice regarding age-related macular degeneration diagnosis and management using a cross-sectional survey of optometrists in Australia and New Zealand. Practising optometrists were surveyed on four key areas, namely, demographics, clinical skills and experience, assessment and management of age-related macular degeneration. Questions pertaining to self-rated competency, knowledge and attitudes used a five-point Likert scale. Completed responses were received from 127 and 87 practising optometrists in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. Advanced imaging showed greater variation in service delivery than traditional techniques (such as slitlamp funduscopy) and trended toward optical coherence tomography, which was routinely performed in age-related macular degeneration by 49 per cent of respondents. Optical coherence tomography was also associated with higher self-rated competency, knowledge and perceived relevance to practice than other modalities. Most respondents (93 per cent) indicated that they regularly applied patient symptoms, case history, visual function results and signs from traditional testing, when queried about their management of patients with age-related macular degeneration. Over half (63 per cent) also considered advanced imaging, while 31 per cent additionally considered all of these as well as the disease stage and clinical guidelines. Contrary to the evidence base, 68 and 34 per cent rated nutritional supplements as highly relevant or relevant in early age-related macular degeneration and normal aging changes, respectively. These results highlight the emergence of multimodal and advanced imaging (especially optical coherence tomography) in the assessment of age-related macular degeneration\n\nAssociations between Rs4244285 and Rs762551 gene polymorphisms and age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nStasiukonyte, Neringa; Liutkeviciene, Rasa; Vilkeviciute, Alvita; Banevicius, Mantas; Kriauciuniene, Loresa\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in elderly individuals in developed countries. The etiology and pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration have not been elucidated yet. Knowing that the main pathological change of age-related macular degeneration is formation of drusen containing about 40% of lipids, there have been attempts to find associations between age-related macular degeneration and genes controlling lipid metabolism. To determine the frequency of CYP2C19 (G681A) Rs4244285 and CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 genotypes in patients with age-related macular degeneration. The study enrolled 150 patients with early age-related macular degeneration and 296 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The genotyping of Rs4244285 and Rs762551 was carried out by using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/C genotype was more frequently detected in patients with age-related macular degeneration than in the control group (32.7% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.011) and was associated with an increased risk of developing early age-related macular degeneration (OR = 1.759, 95% CI: 1.133-2.729; p = 0.012). The CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/A genotype was more frequently documented in the control group compared with patients with age-related macular degeneration (46.3% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.002) and was associated with a decreased risk of having age-related macular degeneration (OR = 0.580. 95% CI: 0.362-0.929, p = 0.023) in the co-dominant model. The study showed that the CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/C genotype was associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration.\n\n[Current concepts in pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration].\n\nPubMed\n\nKubicka-TrzÄ ska, Agnieszka; Karska-Basta, Izabella; Romanowska-Dixon, BoÅ¼ena\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of central blindness in elderly population of the western world. The pathogenesis of this disease, likely multifactorial, is not well known, although a number of theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, genetic interactions, hemodynamic imbalance, immune and inflammatory processes. The understanding of age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis will give rise to new approaches in prevention and treatment of the early and late stages of both atrophic and neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n\nJuvenile Macular Degenerations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAltschwager, Pablo; Ambrosio, Lucia; Swanson, Emily A.; Moskowitz, Anne; Fulton, Anne B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper we review three common juvenile macular degenerations: Stargardt disease, X-linked retinoschisis, and Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

The retina is considered an immune-privileged tissue as a result of its unique anatomic and physiologic properties. During aging, the retina suffers from a low-grade chronic oxidative insult, which sustains for decades and increases in level with advancing age. As a result, the retinal innate-immune system, particularly microglia and the complement system, undergoes low levels of activation (parainflammation). In many cases, this parainflammatory response can maintain homeostasis in the healthy aging eye. However, in patients with age-related macular degeneration, this parainflammatory response becomes dysregulated and contributes to macular damage. Factors contributing to the dysregulation of age-related retinal parainflammation include genetic predisposition, environmental risk factors, and old age. Dysregulated parainflammation (chronic inflammation) in age-related macular degeneration damages the blood retina barrier, resulting in the breach of retinal-immune privilege, leading to the development of retinal lesions. This review discusses the basic principles of retinal innate-immune responses to endogenous chronic insults in normal aging and in age-related macular degeneration and explores the difference between beneficial parainflammation and the detrimental chronic inflammation in the context of age-related macular degeneration.

This was a cross-sectional study. Two-hundred glaucoma patients of whom 73 had age-related macular degeneration were included in the research. Sociodemographic information, visual field parameters and visual acuity were collected. Age-related macular degeneration was scored using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study system. The Rasch-analysed Glaucoma Activity Limitation-9 and the Visual Function Questionnaire Utility Index measured vision-related activity limitation and preference-based status, respectively. Regression models determined factors predictive of vision-related activity limitation and preference-based status. Differential item functioning compared Glaucoma Activity Limitation-9 item difficulty for those with and without age-related macular degeneration. Mean age was 73.7 (Â±10.1)âyears. Lower better eye mean deviation (Î²: 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.24-1.63, Pâ<â0.001) and age-related macular degeneration (Î²: 1.26 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.44, Pâ=â0.001) were independently associated with worse vision-related activity limitation. Worse eye visual acuity (Î²: 0.978, 95% confidence interval: 0.961-0.996, Pâ=â0.018), high risk age-related macular degeneration (Î²: 0.981, 95% confidence interval: 0.965-0.998, Pâ=â0.028) and severe glaucoma (Î²: 0.982, 95% confidence interval: 0.966-0.998, Pâ=â0.032) were independently associated with worse preference-based status. Glaucoma patients with age-related macular degeneration found using stairs, walking on uneven ground and judging distances of foot to step/curb significantly more difficult than those without age-related macular degeneration. Vision-related activity limitation and preference-based status are negatively impacted by severe glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

We examined 472 eyes in 241 patients (136 W/ 105 M) in age of 54-92 years (mean 62.6 years +/- 8.5) with dry or wet age-related macular degeneration using Cirrus HD-OCT (Zeiss) macular cube 512x128 program or 5-line pro-gram. Vitreomacular adhesion was observed in 139 eyes with dry age-related macular degeneration (29.4%, p=0.000*), in 101 eyes with drusen (21.4%, p=0.000*), in 38 eyes with retinal pigment epithelium alterations (8%, p=0.202), in 278 eyes with wet age-related macular degeneration (58.9%, p=0.001*), in 21 eyes with pigment epithelial detachment (4.4%, p=0.303), in 161 eyes with choroidal neovascularzation (34. 1%, p=0.031*/ and in 96 eyes with scar (20.4%, p=0.040*). Probably, vitreomacular adhesion alone is not able to induce age-related macular degeneration, but it may be associated with choroidal neovascularization development, it can contribute to exudate formation and choroidal neovascularization, it may induces or sustains a chronic low-grade inflammation in the macula region.\n\nLipofuscin accumulation, abnormal electrophysiology, and photoreceptor degeneration in mutant ELOVL4 transgenic mice: a model for macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaran, G; Lillo, C; Yang, Z; Cameron, D J; Locke, K G; Zhao, Y; Thirumalaichary, S; Li, C; Birch, D G; Vollmer-Snarr, H R; Williams, D S; Zhang, K\n\n2005-03-15\n\nMacular degeneration is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the central retina. An autosomal dominant form of Stargardt macular degeneration (STGD) is caused by mutations in ELOVL4, which is predicted to encode an enzyme involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids. We generated transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of human ELOVL4 that causes STGD. In these mice, we show that accumulation by the RPE of undigested phagosomes and lipofuscin, including the fluorophore, 2-[2,6-dimethyl-8-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-1E,3E,5E,7E-octatetraenyl]-1-(2-hyydroxyethyl)-4-[4-methyl-6-(2,6,6,-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-1E,3E,5E-hexatrienyl]-pyridinium (A2E) is followed by RPE atrophy. Subsequently, photoreceptor degeneration occurs in the central retina in a pattern closely resembling that of human STGD and age-related macular degeneration. The ELOVL4 transgenic mice thus provide a good model for both STGD and dry age-related macular degeneration, and represent a valuable tool for studies on therapeutic intervention in these forms of blindness.\n\n[Depression in Patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration].\n\nPubMed\n\nNarvÃ¡ez, Yamile Reveiz; GÃ³mez-Restrepo, Carlos\n\n2012-09-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a cause for disability in the elderly since it greatly affects their quality of life and increases depression likelihood.

M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAge-related Macular Degeneration is the most leading retinal disease in the recent years. Macular degeneration occurs when the central portion of the retina, called macula deteriorates. As the deterioration occurs with the age, it is commonly referred as Age-related Macular Degeneration. This disease can be visualized by several imaging modalities such as Fundus imaging technique, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) technique and many other. Optical Coherence Tomography is the widely used technique for screening the Age-related Macular Degeneration disease, because it has an ability to detect the very minute changes in the retina. The Healthy and AMD affected OCT images are classified by extracting the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) layer of the images using the image processing technique. The extracted layer is sampled, the no. of white pixels in each of the sample is counted and the mean value of the no. of pixels is calculated. The average mean value is calculated for both the Healthy and the AMD affected images and a threshold value is fixed and a decision rule is framed to classify the images of interest. The proposed method showed an accuracy of 75%.\n\nTreatment of Macular Degeneration with Sildenafil: Results of a Two-Year Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nColeman, D Jackson; Lee, Winston; Chang, Stanley; Silverman, Ronald H; Lloyd, Harriet O; Daly, Suzanne; Tsang, Stephen H\n\n2018-04-25\n\nTo evaluate PDE5/6 inhibition with sildenafil to reduce choroidal ischemia and treat age-related macular degeneration. Sildenafil was prescribed to treat participants with macular degenerations or macular dystrophies measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, color fundus photography, enhanced depth imaging, and best-corrected visual acuity. No change in calcified drusen was noted. Vitelliform-type soft drusen were not substantially changed. A participant with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy had a significant improvement in vision as well as in photoreceptor and ellipsoid layers. Our research supports sildenafil as a safe treatment for age-related and vitelliform macular degenerations. Thickened Bruch's membrane reduces the beneficial effect of perfusion increase, but all eyes appear to benefit from PDE6. Notably, maintenance or improvement in the photoreceptor layer may be the most significant result of sildenafil and is consistent with PDE6 inhibition. Thus, sil-denafil treatment of macular degeneration offers significant potential for vision retention and recovery. Â© 2018 S.

There is compelling evidence that atherosclerosis and age-related macular degeneration share a similar pathogenic process. The association between atherosclerosis and age-related macular degeneration has been inferred from histological, biochemical and epidemiological studies. Many published data indicate that drusen are similar in molecular composition to plaques in atherosclerosis. Furthermore, a great body of evidence has emerged over the past decade that implicates the chronic inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis and progression of both disorders. We speculate that vascular atherosclerosis and age-related macular degeneration may represent different manifestations of the same disease induced by a pathologic tissue response to the damage caused by oxidative stress and local ischemia. In this review, we characterise in detail a strong association between age-related macular degeneration and atherosclerosis development, and we postulate the hypothesis that age-related macular degeneration is a local manifestation of a systemic disease. This provides a new approach for understanding the aspects of pathogenesis and might improve the prevention and treatment of both diseases which both result from ageing of the human body.\n\nAssociation of HTRA1 rs11200638 with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Brazilian patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLana, Tamires Prates; da Silva Costa, Sueli Matilde; Ananina, Galina; Hirata, FÃ¡bio Endo; Rim, Priscila Hae Hyun; Medina, FlÃ¡vio MacCord; de Vasconcellos, JosÃ© Paulo Cabral; de Melo, MÃ´nica Barbosa\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a multifactorial disease that can lead to vision impairment in older individuals. Although the etiology of age-related macular degeneration remains unknown, risk factors include age, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and genetic factors. Two main loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies, on chromosomes 1 and 10. Among the variants located at the 10q26 region, rs11200638, located at the HTRA1 gene promoter, has been associated with age-related macular degeneration in several populations and is considered the main polymorphism. We conducted a replication case-control study to analyze the frequency and participation of rs11200638 in the etiology of age-related macular degeneration in a sample of patients and controls from the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, through polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic digestion. The frequency of the A allele was 57.60% in patients with age-related macular degeneration and 36.45% in controls (pÂ valueÂ <Â 1e-07), representing a 2.369-fold higher risk factor for the disease. Both the AA and AG genotypes were observed more frequently in the age-related macular degeneration group compared to the control group (pÂ =Â 1.21 e-07 and 0.0357, respectively). No statistically significant results were observed after stratification in dry versus wet types or advanced versus non-advanced forms. To our knowledge, this is the first time the association between rs11200638 and overall age-related macular degeneration has been reported in South America.\n\nMACULAR CHOROIDAL VOLUME CHANGES AFTER INTRAVITREAL BEVACIZUMAB FOR EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalkovits, Stefan; Seidel, Gerald; Pertl, Laura; Malle, Eva M; Hausberger, Silke; Makk, Johanna; Singer, Christoph; Osterholt, Julia; Herzog, Sereina A; Haas, Anton; Weger, Martin\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on the macular choroidal volume and the subfoveal choroidal thickness in treatment naÃ¯ve eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration. The macular choroidal volume and the subfoveal choroidal thickness were measured using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. After a screening examination, each patient received 3 monthly intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab. One month after the third injection was a final assessment. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 80 Â± 6.4 years were included. The macular choroidal volume decreased significantly from median 4.1 mm (interquartile range 3.4-5.9) to median 3.9 mm (interquartile range 3.1-5.6) between the baseline and final examination (difference -0.46 mm, 95% confidence interval: -0.57 to 0.35, P < 0.001). Similarly, subfoveal choroidal thickness had decreased from 157.0 Î¼m (interquartile range 116.0-244.5) at baseline to 139.0 Î¼m (interquartile range 102.5-212.0) at the final examination (P < 0.001). Both parameters macular choroidal volume at baseline and subfoveal choroidal thickness at baseline were not associated with the response to treatment. The macular choroidal volume and the subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased significantly after 3 monthly bevacizumab injections for exudative age-related macular degeneration.\n\nDoes Vertical Reading Help People with Macular Degeneration: An Exploratory Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCalabrÃ¨se, AurÃ©lie; Liu, Tingting; Legge, Gordon E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIndividuals with macular degeneration often develop a Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL) used in place of the impaired fovea. It is known that many people adopt a PRL left of the scotoma, which is likely to affect reading by occluding text to the right of fixation. For such individuals, we examined the possibility that reading vertical text, in which words are rotated 90Â° with respect to the normal horizontal orientation, would be beneficial for reading. Vertically oriented words would be tangential to the scotoma instead of being partially occluded by it. Here we report the results of an exploratory study that aimed at investigating this hypothesis. We trained individuals with macular degeneration who had PRLs left of their scotoma to read text rotated 90Â° clockwise and presented using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Although training resulted in improved reading of vertical text, the training did not result in reading speeds that appreciably exceeded reading speeds following training with horizontal text. These results do not support the hypothesis that people with left PRLs read faster with vertical text.

We describe a total of seven types of intraocular lenses (IOLs) recommended for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We used the PubMed web platform to search for implantable devices in various stages of AMD. We searched for both prospective and retrospective studies and also case reports. Clinical results in AMD patients have been described for a total of seven types of IOLs recommended for AMD: an implantable miniature telescope (IMT), IOL-VIP System, Lipshitz macular implant (LMI), sulcus-implanted Lipshitz macular implant, LMI-SI, Fresnel Prism Intraocular Lens, iolAMD and Scharioth Macula Lens. We conclude that to objectively ascertain the effectiveness and safety of these lenses, further independent clinical studies with longer follow-up data are necessary prior to the general use of these optical devices.\n\n[Disease perception in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration].\n\nPubMed\n\nKostadinov, F; Valmaggia, C\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe disease perception of the patients treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor due to wet age-related macular degeneration was investigated. 177 questionnaires focusing on the development of the perceived visual acuity and the quality of life were evaluated. The subgroup 1 included 125 patients (70.6%) with a unilateral wet age-related macular degeneration. The subgroup 2 included 52 patients (29.4%) with a bilateral wet age-related macular degeneration. Patients would almost always recommend the therapy to a friend (97.2%). The critical remarks are related to the uncertain course of the disease (22.8%) and the uncertain duration of the treatment (19%). There was a discrepancy between the measured visual outcome and the perceived one in 5.6% in the subgroup 1, and in 38.5% in the subgroup 2. This difference was statistically significant (chi-square test with p<0.01). The treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor is judged positively. Binocular affected patients have a higher disease perception and therefore a poorer self-assessment of their visual acuity and their quality of life compared with monocular affected patients.

Regular national polls conducted by an independent social research company have shown that awareness of macular degeneration increased from 47% to 80% in Australians aged 16 years or older and from 58% to 92% in those aged 50 years or older. The percentage of people aged 50 years or older who reported having had their macula checked in the 2 years prior to the survey increased from 33% to 70% from 2007 to 2011. Other measures, including analysis of Medicare data, have confirmed the success of the campaign.

This retrospective observational study matched 23,133 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration between 2004 and 2008 with a control group of 92,532 beneficiaries on the basis of age, sex, and race. The index date for each case-control set corresponded to the first diagnosis for the case. Main outcome measures were total costs per patient and age-related macular degeneration-related costs per case 1 year before and after the index date. Mean cost per case in the year after diagnosis was $12,422, $4,884 higher than the year before diagnosis. Postindex costs were 41% higher for cases than controls after adjustment for preindex costs and comorbid conditions. Age-related macular degeneration-related costs represented 27% of total costs among cases in the postindex period and were 50% higher for patients diagnosed in 2008 than in 2004. This increase was attributable primarily to the introduction of intravitreous injections of vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists. Intravitreous injections averaged $203 for patients diagnosed in 2004 and $2,749 for patients diagnosed in 2008. Newly diagnosed neovascular age-related macular degeneration was associated with a substantial increase in total medical costs. Costs increased over time, reflecting growing use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies.\n\nDriving and Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOwsley, Cynthia; McGwin, Gerald, Jr.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis article reviews the research literature on driving and age-related macular degeneration, which is motivated by the link between driving and the quality of life of older adults and their increased collision rate.

Consecutive patients (n = 200) with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were studied. A Control Cohort included patients with good (20/20-20/25) vision, while Study Cohort vision levels included Subcohort 1: 20/30 to 20/50, Subcohort 2: 20/60 to 20/100, Subcohort 3: 20/200 to 20/400, and Subcohort 4: 20/800 to no light perception. An interviewer-administered, standardized, written survey assessed 1) direct ophthalmic medical, 2) direct nonophthalmic medical, 3) direct nonmedical, and 4) indirect medical costs accrued due solely to neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The mean annual societal cost for the Control Cohort was $6,116 and for the Study Cohort averaged $39,910 (P < 0.001). Study Subcohort 1 costs averaged $20,339, while Subcohort 4 costs averaged $82,984. Direct ophthalmic medical costs comprised 17.9% of Study Cohort societal ophthalmic costs, versus 74.1% of Control Cohort societal ophthalmic costs (P < 0.001) and 10.4% of 20/800 to no light perception subcohort costs. Direct nonmedical costs, primarily caregiver, comprised 67.1% of Study Cohort societal ophthalmic costs, versus 21.3% ($1,302/$6,116) of Control Cohort costs (P < 0.001) and 74.1% of 20/800 to no light perception subcohort costs. Total societal ophthalmic costs associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration dramatically increase as vision in the better-seeing eye decreases.\n\nMACULAR ATROPHY FINDINGS BY OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY COMPARED WITH FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE IN TREATED EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakasago, Yukari; Shiragami, Chieko; Kobayashi, Mamoru; Osaka, Rie; Ono, Aoi; Yamashita, Ayana; Tsujikawa, Akitaka; Hirooka, Kazuyuki\n\n2017-11-28\n\nTo compare the areas of choriocapillaris (CC) nonperfusion and macular atrophy (MA) in treated exudative age-related macular degeneration. This was a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study. Forty-four eyes exhibiting MA (42 patients with age-related macular degeneration), with a dry macula, underwent fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography angiography. The area of MA detected by fundus autofluorescence and CC nonperfusion detected by optical coherence tomography angiography was measured using image analysis software. The rates of concordance between the MA and CC nonperfusion areas were calculated. We qualitatively and quantitatively compared the areas of MA and CC nonperfusion in age-related macular degeneration eyes. The mean areas of MA and CC nonperfusion were 5.95 Â± 4.50 mm and 10.66 Â± 7.05 mm, respectively (paired t-test, P < 0.001). In 39 eyes (88.6%), the CC nonperfusion area was larger than the MA area, and the mean CC nonperfusion area was significantly larger than the mean MA area. Fundus autofluorescence matching optical coherence tomography angiography showed that the CC nonperfusion area was almost included in the MA area. The mean concordance rate for the MA area inside the CC nonperfusion area was 87.7 Â± 13.9%. The MA and CC nonperfusion areas markedly overlapped. The area of CC nonperfusion correlated with the MA area. Choroidal ischemia might be involved in the pathogenesis of MA in treated age-related macular degeneration.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 (CCBY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nANTERIOR CHAMBER FLARE DURING BEVACIZUMAB TREATMENT IN EYES WITH EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.\n\nPubMed\n\nHautamÃ¤ki, Asta; Luoma, Arto; Immonen, Ilkka\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTo study the anterior chamber flare during bevacizumab treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration. During a 2-year prospective follow-up, 50 patients recently diagnosed with exudative age-related macular degeneration were treated at once-a-month visits if subretinal or intraretinal fluid or a new hemorrhage was present in the lesion area. Flare was measured weekly during the first month and then monthly in both eyes. Higher flare was associated with older age (P = 0.007, Linear Mixed Model), higher number of smoking pack-years (P = 0.019), macular cysts (P = 0.041), and pseudophakia (P = 0.003). The levels gradually increased during the follow-up (P < 0.0001) but less in the eyes with classic CNV (P = 0.011). Flare decreased during treatment-free periods lasting for at least two consecutive visits (P = 0.005). A peak in flare was observed 1 week after the first injection (P = 0.034, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In the fellow eyes, higher flare values in the beginning of the follow-up were associated with later conversion into exudative age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.015, Mann-Whitney U test). Anterior chamber flare correlated poorly with the CNV activity. Higher levels may, however, precede or exist early in the process that leads to the development of exudative age-related macular degeneration.\n\nDepression in Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCasten, Robin; Rovner, Barry\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of disability in the elderly, substantially degrades the quality of their lives, and is a risk factor for depression.

One hundred eighteen unrelated patients with recessive Stargardt macular degeneration and eight with recessive CRD were screened for mutations in ABCR (ABCA4) by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Variants were characterized by direct genomic sequencing. Segregation analysis was performed on the families of 20 patients in whom at least two or more likely pathogenic sequence changes were identified. The authors found 77 sequence changes likely to be pathogenic: 21 null mutations (15 novel), 55 missense changes (26 novel), and one deletion of a consensus glycosylation site (also novel). Fifty-two patients with Stargardt macular degeneration (44% of those screened) and five with CRD each had two of these sequence changes or were homozygous for one of them. Segregation analyses in the families of 19 of these patients were informative and revealed that the index cases and all available affected siblings were compound heterozygotes or homozygotes. The authors found one instance of an apparently de novo mutation, Ile824Thr, in a patient. Thirty-seven (31%) of the 118 patients with Stargardt disease and one with CRD had only one likely pathogenic sequence change. Twenty-nine patients with Stargardt disease (25%) and two with CRD had no identified sequence changes. This report of 42 novel mutations brings the growing number of identified likely pathogenic sequence changes in ABCR to approximately 250.\n\n[Non-pharmacologic therapy of age-related macular degeneration, based on the etiopathogenesis of the disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nFischer, TamÃ¡s\n\n2015-07-12\n\nIt has a great therapeutic significance that the disorder of the vascular endothelium, which supplies the affected ocular structures, plays a major role in the development of age-related macular degeneration. Chronic inflammation is closely linked to diseases associated with endothelial dysfuncition and age-related macular degeneration is accompanied by a general inflammatory response. The vascular wall including those in chorioids may be activated by several repeated and/or prolonged mechanical, physical, chemical, microbiological, immunologic and genetic factors causing a protracted host defence response with a consequent vascular damage, which leads to age-related macular degeneration. Based on this concept, age-related macular degeneration is a local manifestation of the systemic vascular disease. This recognition should have therapeutic implications because restoration of endothelial dysfunction can stabilize the condition of chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration, as well. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction by non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions may prevent the development or improve endothelial dysfunction resulting in prevention or improvement of age-related macular degeneration. Non-pharmacological interventions which may have beneficial effect in endothelial dysfunction include (1) smoking cessation; (2) reduction of increased body weight; (3) adequate physical activity; (4) appropriate diet (a) proper dose of flavonoids, polyphenols and kurcumin; (b) omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid; (c) carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthins), (d) management of dietary glycemic index, (e) caloric restriction, and (5) elimination of stressful lifestyle. Non-pharmacological interventions should be preferable even if medicaments are also used for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction.\n\nSuperior cervical gangliectomy induces non-exudative age-related macular degeneration in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nDieguez, HernÃ¡n H; Romeo, Horacio E; GonzÃ¡lez Fleitas, MarÃ­a F; Aranda, Marcos L; Milne, Georgia A; Rosenstein, Ruth E; Dorfman, DamiÃ¡n\n\n2018-02-07\n\nNon-exudative age-related macular degeneration, a prevalent cause of blindness, is a progressive and degenerative disease characterized by alterations in Bruch's membrane, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors exclusively localized in the macula. Although experimental murine models exist, the vast majority take a long time to develop retinal alterations and, in general, these alterations are ubiquitous, with many resulting from non-eye-specific genetic manipulations; additionally, most do not always reproduce the hallmarks of human age-related macular degeneration. Choroid vessels receive sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion, which, together with the parasympathetic system, regulates blood flow into the choroid. Choroid blood flow changes have been involved in age-related macular degeneration development and progression. At present, no experimental models take this factor into account. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of superior cervical gangliectomy (also known as ganglionectomy) on the choroid, Bruch's membrane, retinal pigment epithelium and retina. Adult male C57BL/6J mice underwent unilateral superior cervical gangliectomy and a contralateral sham procedure. Although superior cervical gangliectomy induced ubiquitous choroid and choriocapillaris changes, it induced Bruch's membrane thickening, loss of retinal pigment epithelium melanin content and retinoid isomerohydrolase, the appearance of drusen-like deposits, and retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor atrophy, exclusively localized in the temporal side. Moreover, superior cervical gangliectomy provoked a localized increase in retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor apoptosis, and a decline in photoreceptor electroretinographic function. Therefore, superior cervical gangliectomy recapitulated the main features of human non-exudative age-related macular degeneration, and could become a new experimental model of dry age-related macular degeneration, and\n\nDiagnosis of non-exudative (DRY) age related macular degeneration by non-invasive photon-correlation spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nFankhauser, Franz Ii; Ott, Maria; Munteanu, Mihnea\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPhoton-correlation spectroscopy (PCS) (quasi-elastic light scattering spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy) allows the non-invasively reveal of local dynamics and local heterogeneities of macromolecular systems. The capability of this technique to diagnose the retinal pathologies by in-vivo investigations of spatial anomalies of retinas displaying non-exudative senile macular degeneration was evaluated. Further, the potential use of the technique for the diagnosis of the macular degeneration was analyzed and displayed by the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). The maculae and the peripheral retina of 73 normal eyes and of 26 eyes afflicted by an early stage of non-exudative senile macular degeneration were characterized by time-correlation functions and analyzed in terms of characteristic decay times and apparent size distributions. The characteristics of the obtained time-correlation functions of the eyes afflicted with nonexudative macular degeneration and of normal eyes differed significantly, which could be referred to a significant change of the nano- and microstructure of the investigated pathologic maculas. Photon-correlation spectroscopy is able to assess the macromolecular and microstructural aberrations in the macula afflicted by non-exudative, senile macular degeneration. It has been demonstrated that macromolecules of this disease show a characteristic abnormal behavior in the macula.\n\nGene-diet interactions in age-related macular degeneration\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent blinding disease, accounting for roughly 50% of blindness in developed nations.

The medical records of 18 eyes of 18 patients who had received three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab were retrospectively studied. The BCVA, macular thickness determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and FMERGs were measured before the first injection, and 10 days after each of the intravitreal bevacizumab injections. The number of eyes with improvement in BCVA after the first injection was one (6%), after the second injection was four (22%), and after the third injection was five (28%). The number of eyes with reduction in macular thickness was 4 (33%), 8 (44%), and 10 (56%) after each of the three injections. The number of eyes with increase in b-wave amplitude of the FMERGs was 7 (38%), 6 (33%), and 10 (56%) after each of the three each injections. The mean macular thickness was significantly thinner after the first injection, and the mean BCVA was significantly improved after the second injection. The mean amplitude and implicit time of the b-wave of the FMERGs were significantly improved only after the third injection (P<0.05). All parameters improved but the best was after the third injection, indicating that three monthly intravitreous injections with bevacizumab may be an effective treatment regimen for AMD.\n\nThe Experience of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWong, Elaine Y.

Methods: Presented are angiographic- and OCT-findings in patients with macular degeneration of different origin. Choroidal neovascularisations, which are not likely to respond positively to established procedures like thermal laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy will be discussed. Results and conclusions: Present study-guidelines and new methods of pharmacological intervention are analysed in different patterns of macular degeneration. Conventional laser coagulation in the treatment of classic, extrafoveal CNV and photodynamic therapy of predominantly classic subfoveal CNV still represent a gold standard. There are new recommendations, loosening the tight criteria of the TAP and VIP-guidelines, which cover, for instance, wider visual acuity ranges and the treatment of juxtafoveally located choroidal neovascularisations. Positive findings in literature confirm the role of PDT in pathologic myopia and other non-AMD CNV. Studies about surgical procedures, like macula- or RPE-translocation after surgical removal or thermal laser destruction of the CNV are in progress and are expected to show promising results. Phase II/III studies will soon point out the effect of anti-VEGF agents. The application of intravitreal (triamcinolone) or peribulbar (anecortave acetat) steroids could be useful. The combination with surgical or laser techniques could bring further benefit to the patient.\n\nApproach of Turkish ophthalmologists to micronutrition in age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuhammed, Åahin; YÃ¼ksel, Harun; Åahin, Alparslan; CingÃ¼, Abdullah KÃ¼rÅat; TÃ¼rkcÃ¼, Fatih Mehmet; Ãzkurt, Zeynep GÃ¼rsel; ÃaÃ§a, Ä°hsan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the knowledge and behaviors of ophthalmologists in Turkey concerning micronutrition support in patients with age related macular degeneration (ARMD). This study involved 1,845 ophthalmologists. A scientific poll was sent to all participants by email. The survey covered the following: demographic features, subspecialty knowledge about micronutrition preference for prescribing micronutrition to age related macular degeneration patients, and the reason for this preference. If a participant indicated that he or she prescribed micronutrition, the participant was also asked to indicate the source of the treatment and supplemental treatments. Of 1,845 ophthalmologists, 249 responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 9% (22) never, 43% (107) sometimes, 37% (92) frequently, and 11% (27) always used micronutrition. The most frequent prescribing subgroup was general ophthalmology (22%), followed by the retina-uvea subspecialty (13.9%). The micronutrition prescribing ratio was 54.8% in retina-uvea specialists when the \"frequent\" and \"always\" responses were combined. There was no statistically significant difference between subgroups with respect to prescribing micronutrition. Among the ophthalmologists prescribing micronutrition, 57.1% of them did not use the Age-Related Eye Disease Study-1 (AREDS) criteria, and only 31.3% prescribe micronutrition according to AREDS criteria. The results for the general ophthalmologist and retina-uvea specialist subgroups were similar, 56.3% vs 20.2%, and 54.1% vs 36.1%, respectively. Micronutrition was not recommended for the following reasons: expensive (55.4%), low patient expectancy (40%), no effect (30%), and low patient drug compliance (25.4%). Moreover, 55.2% of the clinicians recommended physical activities, dietary changes, and smoking cessation; 7.3% did not recommend these behavioral changes. This survey demonstrated that micronutrition preference in age related macular degeneration was low in ophthalmologists in Turkey\n\nComplement pathway biomarkers and age-related macular degeneration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGemenetzi, M; Lotery, A J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) âinflammation model', local inflammation plus complement activation contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.

Reference case cost-utility analysis using value-based medicine principles, which use patient-based utility values and standardized, input variable criteria. Data from participants in the Macular Photocoagulation Study, Pegaptanib for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study, and the Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic Therapy Study. Visual data were converted to a value-based format using time tradeoff utility analysis values from patients with macular degeneration. Costs were obtained from 2005 Medicare data. Outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Interventional QALYs gained, percent improvement in quality of life, and dollars spent per QALY gained. Laser photocoagulation confers a 4.4% (P = 0.03 versus pegaptanib therapy) improvement in quality of life for the reference case, whereas pegaptanib therapy confers a 5.9% improvement and PDT confers an 8.1% (P = 0.0002 versus pegaptanib therapy) improvement. The cost-utility associated with laser photocoagulation is $8179, that for pegaptanib therapy is $66978, and that for PDT is $31544. All sensitivity analyses remain within the conventional standards of cost-effectiveness. Photodynamic therapy confers greater patient value than intravitreal pegaptanib therapy and laser photocoagulation for the treatment of classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization. Despite the fact that laser photocoagulation is the most cost-effective intervention, both PDT and pegaptanib therapy deliver greater value, and thus are both preferred over laser photocoagulation. Using an economic measure, photodynamic therapy is the preferred treatment among these 3 interventions.\n\nImmunology of age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmbati, Jayakrishna; Atkinson, John P; Gelfand, Bradley D\n\n2013-06-01\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in aged individuals.

This was a retrospective interventional case series in which patients with wet age-related macular degeneration were treated with stepwise dose escalation. Nonvitrectomized patients resistant to monthly (Q4W) ranibizumab/bevacizumab were switched to 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks. With resistance, they were escalated to Q4W 2 mg aflibercept, then Q4W 4 mg (high dose high frequency, 4Q4W) aflibercept. Resistance was defined as â¥2 recurrences after being dry following â¥3 injections or persistent exudation on treatment of â¥5 injections. Thirty-three eyes of 28 patients were treated with 4Q4W aflibercept and followed for a mean of 16 months. A dry retina (no intraretinal or subretinal fluid) was achieved after initiating 4Q4W aflibercept treatment at a mean of 3.8 months. Central foveal thickness, maximum foveal thickness, intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, and retinal pigment detachment height decreased significantly at 1 month after initiating the 4Q4W aflibercept, and the morphologic therapeutic effect was sustained until the last visit. Forty-five percent of eyes had one or more lines of vision improvement. New geographic atrophy developed in 9% of eyes during follow-up. No ocular or systemic adverse events occurred after initiating 4Q4W aflibercept. Intravitreal high-dose high-frequency aflibercept is an effective treatment for patients with refractory wet age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPatient Awareness of Cataract and Age-related Macular Degeneration among the Korean Elderly: A Population-based Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hankil; Jang, Yong Jung; Lee, Hyung Keun; Kang, Hye Young\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAge-related eye disease is often considered part of natural aging. Lack of awareness of eye conditions can result in missed treatment. We investigated the rates of awareness of cataract and age-related macular degeneration, the most common age-related eye-diseases, and the associated factors among elderly Koreans. We identified 7,403 study subjects (â¥40 years old) with cataract or age-related macular degeneration based on ophthalmic examination results during the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2010 and 2012. We assessed whether patients were aware of their eye condition based on a previous diagnosis by a physician. The average awareness rate over the 3-year study period was 23.69% in subjects with cataract and 1.45% in subjects with age-related macular degeneration. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with cataract were more likely to recognize their condition if they had myopia (odds ratio, 2.08), hyperopia (odds ratio, 1.33), family history of eye disease (odds ratio, 1.44), or a past eye examination (odds ratio, 4.07-29.10). The presence of diabetes mellitus was also a significant predictor of patient awareness of cataract (odds ratio, 1.88). Poor patient recognition of eye disease among the Korean elderly highlights the seriousness of this potential public health problem in our aging society. Pre-existing eye-related conditions and diabetes were significant predictors of awareness; therefore, patients in frequent contact with their doctors have a greater chance of detecting eye disease.

Methods: The search term âage-related macular degenerationâ was used to browse the web using four different search engines. The first 40 websites appearing on match lists provided by each search engine were recorded and those listed in at least three tab pages selected. The Sandvik Severity Index was used as to assess website quality. Results: Quality of information available on selected websites was rated average (mean Sandvik Score 7.08Â±2.23). Conclusion: Most websites disseminating information about age-related macular degeneration were of average quality. The need to readjust web-based information to target lay public and promote increased understanding was emphasized.

Post hoc analysis of a phase 3 multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-masked, active treatment-controlled clinical trial. Evaluable subjects (NÂ = 1095) with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to neovascular AMD treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg monthly or pro re nata (PRN). Fluorescein angiograms (FAs) and color fundus photographs at baseline and months 3, 12, and 24 were retrospectively graded by masked graders for MA: well-defined areas of depigmentation with increased choroidal vessel visibility, diameter â¥250 Î¼m, corresponding to flat areas of well-demarcated staining on FA, excluding atrophy associated with retinal pigment epithelium tears. Atrophy immediately within, adjacent, and nonadjacent to CNV lesions was included. Macular atrophy incidence, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). At baseline, MA was detected in 11.2% (123/1095) of study eyes. At month 24, 29.4% (229/778) of eyes without baseline atrophy had detectable MA. Eyes with and without baseline MA had significant mean BCVA gains from baseline at month 24 (letters [95% confidence interval]:Â +6.7 [4.1-9.3];Â +9.1 [8.0-10.2], respectively). Among eyes with and without MA at month 24, mean month 24 BCVA was 62.0 [60.3-63.7] and 64.7 [63.2-66.3] letters, respectively. Baseline risk factors for month 24 MA presence included intraretinal cysts (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45 [1.76-3.42]) and fellow eye atrophy (HR, 2.02 [1.42-2.87]); subretinal fluid was associated with a lower MA risk (HR, 0.50 [0.33-0.74]). Ranibizumab dose was not associated with MA development. Monthly versus PRN treatment trended toward an association with MA (HR, 1.29 [0.99-1.68]), but was not statistically significant. New MA was detected in 29% of study eyes after 24 months of treatment. Clinically significant BCVA gains were achieved with MA present over 24\n\nDurable recovery of the macular architecture and functionality of a diagnosed age-related macular degeneration 1â year after a single intravitreal injection of dobesilate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuevas, P; OuteiriÃ±o, L A; Azanza, C; GimÃ©nez-Gallego, G\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAmong the age-related diseases that affect vision, age-related macular degeneration is the most frequent cause of blindness in patients older than 60â years.

Since the initial observations that laser treatment can resolve drusen, there has been great interest in whether laser treatment can be used to reduce the progression of age-related macular degeneration. In this article, we review the development of lasers for the treatment of those with age-related macular degeneration. We provide an overview of the clinical trial results that demonstrated drusen resolution but that had mixed effects on progression of disease. In addition, we provide a summary of the recent developments in pulsed lasers that are designed to reduce the energy applied to the posterior eye to provide the therapeutic effects of conventional continuous wave lasers while reducing the secondary tissue effects.\n\nThe relationship of major American dietary patterns to age-related macular degeneration\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nWe hypothesized that major American dietary patterns are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk.

The condition of the vitreous was examined by slit-lamp funduscopy and ultrasonography in 93 eyes of 50 patients with AMD (exudative or dry) and 100 eyes of 50 controls. There was complete PVD in 31 of the 93 eyes (33.3%) of 50 patients with AMD and the posterior vitreous was attached in 62 of these eyes (66.6%). In the control group, in 50 eyes (50%) of 50 subjects there was posterior vitreous detachment. The prevalence of PVD in eyes with macular degeneration was significantly lower (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the exudative and the nonexudative groups in respect to PVD. PVD may have a protective role against the development of AMD. Chronic vitreomacular traction and/or continuous exposure to free radicals and cytokines may possibly be one of the causes of AMD in eyes with attached vitreous.\n\nCurrent knowledge and trends in age-related macular degeneration: genetics, epidemiology, and prevention.\n\nPubMed\n\nVelez-Montoya, Raul; Oliver, Scott C N; Olson, Jeffrey L; Fine, Stuart L; Quiroz-Mercado, Hugo; Mandava, Naresh\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTo address the most dynamic and current issues concerning human genetics, risk factors, pharmacoeconomics, and prevention regarding age-related macular degeneration.

In this study, we evaluate the relationship between the extent of macular drusen and specific choroidal parameters, including thickness and intensity. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were collected from two distinct, independent cohorts with nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration: Amish (53 eyes of 34 subjects) and non-Amish (40 eyes from 26 subjects). All spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were obtained using the Cirrus HD-OCT with a 512 Ã 128 macular cube (6 Ã 6 mm) protocol. The Cirrus advanced retinal pigment epithelium analysis tool was used to automatically compute drusen volume within 3 mm (DV3) and 5 mm (DV5) circles centered on the fovea. The inner and outer borders of the choroid were manually segmented, and the mean choroidal thickness and choroidal intensity (i.e., brightness) were calculated. The choroidal intensity was normalized against the vitreous and nerve fiber layer reflectivity. The correlation between DV and these choroidal parameters was assessed using Pearson and linear regression analysis. A significant positive correlation was observed between normalized choroidal intensity and DV5 in the Amish (r = 0.42, P = 0.002) and non-Amish (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) cohorts. Also, DV3 showed a significant positive correlation with normalized choroidal intensity in both the groups (Amish: r = 0.30, P = 0.02; non-Amish: r = 0.32, P = 0.04). Choroidal thickness was negatively correlated with normalized choroidal intensity in both Amish (r = -0.71, P = 0.001) and non-Amish (r = -0.43, P = 0.01) groups. Normalized choroidal intensity was the most significant constant predictor of DV in both the Amish and non-Amish groups. Choroidal intensity, but not choroidal thickness, seems to be associated with drusen volume in Amish and non-Amish populations.

Value-based medicine is the practice of medicine based upon the patient value (improvement in quality of life and length of life) conferred by an intervention. For ophthalmologic interventions, in which length-of-life is generally unaffected, the value gain is equivalent to the improvement in quality of life. Photodynamic therapy delivers a value gain (improvement in quality of life) of 8.1% for the average person with classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, while laser photocoagulation for the same entity confers a 4.4% improvement in quality of life. Preliminary data suggest the value gain for the treatment of occult/minimally classic choroidal neovascularization with ranibizumab is greater than 15%. The average value gain for statins for the treatment of hyperlipidemia is 3.9%, while that for the use of biphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis is 1.1% and that for drugs to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia is 1-2%. Interventions, especially ranibizumab therapy, for neovascular macular degeneration appear to deliver an extraordinary degree of value compared with many other interventions across healthcare.\n\nThe Effect of an Educational Program for Persons with Macular Degeneration: A Pilot Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSmith, Theresa Marie; Thomas, Kimberly; Dow, Katherine\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMacular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss in the United States for persons aged 60 and older.

Two hundred thirty-four subjects who were treated for neovascular age-related macular degeneration were assessed to identify prechoroidal cleft on optical coherence tomography. Clinical variables were compared between patients manifesting a cleft (cleft group) and patients who did not (control group). Prechoroidal cleft was detected in 29 of 234 patients (8.1%). Although the baseline visual acuity was not different between the 2 groups, logMAR visual acuity at final visit was 0.89 Â± 0.74 (with approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/160) in the cleft group and 0.65 Â± 0.69 (with approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/100) in controls (P < 0.05). Within cleft group, the early-onset (<6 months) subgroup had even worse visual outcomes than the late-onset subgroup (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the incidence of prechoroidal cleft was positively correlated with having received intravitreal gas injection to displace a submacular hemorrhage and a diagnosis of retinal angiomatous proliferation and typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration (P < 0.05). Diagnosis of retinal angiomatous proliferation and typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and a submacular hemorrhage treated by pneumatic displacement were the independent risk factors for development of prechoroidal cleft. Eyes with a cleft, especially clefts that develop early, generally had worse prognoses than eyes without clefts.\n\nTriple therapy for age-related macular degeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nAugustin, Albert\n\n2009-06-01\n\nChoroidal neovascularization is a hallmark sign of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) but it is not an isolated feature. Several processes are likely to contribute to the fibrotic scarring and vision loss that accompanies progressive disease. In a case series, a triple therapy approach to wet AMD was based on the goals of halting choroidal neovascularization, controlling the inflammatory response, and modifying proliferative factors. To address each of these goals, respectively, patients received photodynamic therapy, bevacizumab, and the steroid dexamethasone. The encouraging rate of response, including significant improvements in visual acuity, is consistent with the combined activities of these agents and provides the basis for more definitive studies.\n\nOptical coherence tomography angiography in age-related macular degeneration: The game changer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLupidi, Marco; Cerquaglia, Alessio; Chhablani, Jay; Fiore, Tito; Singh, Sumit Randhir; Cardillo Piccolino, Felice; Corbucci, Roberta; Coscas, Florence; Coscas, Gabriel; Cagini, Carlo\n\n2018-04-01\n\nOptical coherence tomography angiography is one of the biggest advances in ophthalmic imaging. It enables a depth-resolved assessment of the retinal and choroidal blood flow, far exceeding the levels of detail commonly obtained with dye angiographies. One of the first applications of optical coherence tomography angiography was in detecting the presence of choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration and establishing its position in relation to the retinal pigmented epithelium and Bruch's membrane, and thereby classifying the CNV as type 1, type 2, type 3, or mixed lesions. Optical coherence tomography angiograms, due to the longer wavelength used by optical coherence tomography, showed a more distinct choroidal neovascularization vascular pattern than fluorescein angiography, since there is less suffering from light scattering or is less obscured by overlying subretinal hemorrhages or exudation. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of optical coherence tomography angiography findings in exudative and nonexudative age-related macular degeneration have been largely investigated within the past 3âyears both in clinical and experimental settings. This review constitutes an up-to-date of all the potential applications of optical coherence tomography angiography in age-related macular degeneration in order to better understand how to translate its theoretical usefulness into the current clinical practice.\n\nTreatment of dry age-related macular degeneration with dobesilate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCuevas, P; OuteiriÃ±o, L A; Angulo, J; GimÃ©nez-Gallego, G\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe authors present anatomical and functional evidences of dry age-macular degeneration improvement, after intravitreal treatment with dobesilate.

At the end, only 160 references were included in this review. Treatment for age-related macular degeneration is a very dynamic research field. While current treatments are mainly aimed at blocking vascular endothelial growth factor, future treatments seek to prevent vision loss because of scarring. Promising efforts have been made to address the dry form of the disease, which has lacked effective treatment.\n\nEstimated cases of blindness and visual impairment from neovascular age-related macular degeneration avoided in Australia by ranibizumab treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitchell, Paul; Bressler, Neil; Doan, Quan V; Dolan, Chantal; Ferreira, Alberto; Osborne, Aaron; Rochtchina, Elena; Danese, Mark; Colman, Shoshana; Wong, Tien Y\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, such as ranibizumab, have significantly improved the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. This study used patient-level simulation modelling to estimate the number of individuals in Australia who would have been likely to avoid legal blindness or visual impairment due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration over a 2-year period as a result of intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The modelling approach used existing data for the incidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in Australia and outcomes from ranibizumab trials. Blindness and visual impairment were defined as visual acuity in the better-seeing eye of worse than 6/60 or 6/12, respectively. In 2010, 14,634 individuals in Australia were estimated to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration who would be eligible for ranibizumab therapy. Without treatment, 2246 individuals would become legally blind over 2 years. Monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab would reduce incident blindness by 72% (95% simulation interval, 70-74%). Ranibizumab given as needed would reduce incident blindness by 68% (64-71%). Without treatment, 4846 individuals would become visually impaired over 2 years; this proportion would be reduced by 37% (34-39%) with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab, and by 28% (23-33%) with ranibizumab given as needed. These data suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, given either monthly or as needed, can substantially lower the number of cases of blindness and visual impairment over 2 years after the diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n\nStatin use and the incidence of advanced age-related macular degeneration in the Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaguire, Maureen G; Ying, Gui-shuang; McCannel, Colin A; Liu, Chengcheng; Dai, Yang\n\n2009-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the impact of statin use on the incidence of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and its components, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and geographic atrophy (GA), among patients with bilateral large drusen. Cohort study within a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial. Patients enrolled in the Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT). Eligibility criteria for the clinical trial required that participants have >or=10 large (>125 microm) drusen and visual acuity >or=20/40 in each eye. Patients scheduled for their final CAPT visit after May 2005 were interviewed on their history of use of cholesterol-lowering medications, including statins. Trained readers identified CNV and end point GA (>1 Macular Photocoagulation Study disc area of GA) based on review of fluorescein angiograms and fundus photographs taken at annual follow-up visits and when patients reported symptoms. The risk ratio for participants developing CNV or developing GA associated with statin use was estimated with time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. Development of advanced AMD, CNV, and end point GA. Among 764 patients eligible for the interview, 744 (97.4%) patients completed the interview on medication use. Statin use was reported by 296 (39.8%) of those interviewed, with the majority, 187 (63.2%) of the 296, beginning use after enrollment in CAPT. Among 744 patients, advanced AMD developed in 332 (22.5%) eyes of 242 (32.5%) patients, CNV in 222 (15%) eyes of 176 (23.7%) patients, and GA in 114 (7.7%) eyes of 80 (10.8%) patients. With adjustment for other risk factors, the estimated risk ratio for eyes (95% confidence interval) associated with statin use was 1.15 (0.87-1.52) for advanced AMD, 1.35 (0.99-1.83) for CNV, and 0.80 (0.46-1.39) for GA.

Human genetic studies have suggested perturbation of the complement system is important in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. The mechanisms underlying the involvement of the complement system are not understood, although complement and inflammation have been implicated in drusen formation. Drusen are an early clinical hallmark of inherited and age-related forms of macular degeneration. We studied one of the earliest stages of macular degeneration which precedes and leads to the formation of drusen, i.e. the formation of basal deposits. The studies were done using a mouse model of the inherited macular dystrophy Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy/Malattia Leventinese (DHRD/ML) which is caused by a p.Arg345Trp mutation in EFEMP1. The hallmark of DHRD/ML is the formation of drusen at an early age, and gene targeted Efemp1R345W/R345W mice develop extensive basal deposits. Proteomic analyses of Bruch's membrane/choroid and Bruch's membrane in the Efemp1R345W/R345W mice indicate that the basal deposits comprise normal extracellular matrix (ECM) components present in abnormal amounts. The proteomic analyses also identified significant changes in proteins with immune-related function, including complement components, in the diseased tissue samples. Genetic ablation of the complement response via generation of Efemp1R345W/R345W:C3â/â double-mutant mice inhibited the formation of basal deposits. The results demonstrate a critical role for the complement system in basal deposit formation, and suggest that complement-mediated recognition of abnormal ECM may participate in basal deposit formation in DHRD/ML and perhaps other macular degenerations.

A phase IV, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled exploratory study including subjects with subfoveal NV-AMD who had had one to three induction treatments 30-120 days before entry and showed investigator-determined clinical/anatomical NV-AMD improvement. Lesions in the study eye were: any subtype, 12 or fewer disc areas; postinduction centre point thickness (CPT) 275 Î¼m or less or thinning of 100 Î¼m or more (optical coherence tomography); visual acuity (VA) 20/20-20/400. Intravitreal pegaptanib 0.3 mg was administered as maintenance every 6 weeks for 48 weeks with follow-up to week 54. Booster treatment additional unscheduled treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, was allowed in the study eye at the investigators' discretion for clinical deterioration. Of 568 enrolled subjects, 86% completed 1 year of pegaptanib. Mean VA improvem"
