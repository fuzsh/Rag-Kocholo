        "text": "There's a whole lotta love for burgers in Zagreb right now and it seems that the burger frenzy is not going to end soon. I’m still not sure if that’s a good thing or not. Don’t get me wrong, I adore burgers but I just wish there was more diversity to the Zagreb food scene.\n\nAll you old souls, lovers of all things retro with a keen appreciation for the simplistic life of a time gone by, remember the name of Caffe Bar Finjak and the address Vlaška 78, for it is your temple! Filled with historic items dating from the beginning of the 20th century and reflecting old Zagreb’s everyday life, Finjak is a place where time stands still and where things are taken easy. The way they should always be, not only on vacation.\n\nHello, dear fellow foodies! It has been a very exciting month and I have so many stories to share with you! So without further ado I’m going to start with my recent visit to the Kutjevo winery. Less than a month ago I was invited by the Croatian lifestyle magazine “Ljepota i zdravlje” to participate in a field trip to Kutjevo.\n\nIt seems that spring has sprung in more ways than one, and that is especially true in the case of Zagreb’s food scene! New restaurants, cafés and bistros are springing up like mushrooms ‒ so fast that I can barely keep track! If you follow this blog, you know I’ve written about cool breakfast places in Zagreb before, but a lot has changed over the past six months and it’s time for some serious revision. Though, I must say, not a lot has changed in Zagrebians’ early morning eating habits. Breakfast is still the most neglected meal of the day, but that doesn’t mean you should follow in our footsteps. Exploring the streets of an unknown city on an empty stomach is never a good idea, as you surely know. That’s why I’m sharing with you 7 great breakfast spots that our beloved city has to offer. From an artisan bakery, a café serving stacks of pancakes and toasts, a glamorous breakfast in a historic hotel bistro to a place devoted entirely to eggs, here’s where you should go for breakfast in Zagreb in 2017!\n\nI thought this post was never going to see the light of day, but at last, here it is! I must admit that I was having a lot of trouble with reviewing this particular restaurant (the kind of trouble also known as writer’s block or “Look, there’s dust everywhere and I should clean the entire apartment, iron all my clothes, my boyfriends’ clothes and find the answer for world peace” level of procrastination). And it wasn’t because I didn’t like the food, I really did, but it had to do with the fact that this place is seriously popular with tourists, and I’m particularly careful at recommending a restaurant as touristy as this one.\n\nAs a traveller in Zagreb, there’s one thing you’re bound to notice: the abundance of bakeries (aside from the abundance of cafés). It seems that every 50 meters there is at least one bakery tempting you with the smell of their freshly baked goodies. From the small independent, family-owned ones to popular bakery chains, the offer is remarkably rich and the choices are too many so we Zagrebians actually suffer from overchoice. And that can sometimes trigger passionate (and completely absurd) disputes among friends around the topic of bakery they choose to buy their daily loaf from. #FirstWorldProblems\n\nAlthough Oranž Streets (previously called Oranž bistro & wine bar) is not the newest kid in town, their recent change in staff, with the renowned Maltese chef Jeffrey Vella taking the helm of the kitchen, has undoubtedly put Oranž Streets on Zagreb’s food map. And mine, too :). I’ve known of Oranž for a while and passed by its glass walls on the corner of Ilica and Margaretska Street a thousand times, but there was nothing particularly interesting about this place that made me want to check it out. Until now."
