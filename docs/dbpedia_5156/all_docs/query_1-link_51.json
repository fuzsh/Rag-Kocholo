        "text": "Each wine has its own character, recognizable features, and we can say – a soul. Two wines from the same region, produced under the same conditions and from the same grape variety, may be as different as two brothers can be. What will make the wine special and unique are the hands of the winemaker who produces it. Winemakers are the ones who go out at dawn to check their vineyards, to look after every single grapevine, to listen to the wind and the rain, considering every bunch of grape a piece of treasure they cherish as best they can.\n\nIn the World of Graševina, there are winemakers who pour all their passion into wine.\n\nSome of them have reached the status of true legends of winemaking art thanks to decades of hard work and good results. But there is also a generation of young winemakers who are not afraid to experiment and innovate, to look for new ways and means of wine production that will delight the tasters with every drop of wine.\n\nWe will mention one of the most experienced winemakers, Mr. Vlado Krauthaker. He left his native Međimurje for Slavonia, which was the best decision of his life. At the beginning a young oenologist employed at the Agriculture and Food Company Kutjevo, he made his career and became one of our best known and most successful winemakers.\n\nThe transition to private ownership and the development of his own winery was a demanding and risky undertaking, but today’s results show that it was really worth it. What is special about this winery is the use of old grape growing techniques that are in accordance with ecological principles. For example, vineyards are cultivated by means of horses instead of modern machines, and organic fertilizer is used for fertilizing. As a result, these wines delight with their colour, taste and aroma.\n\nListening to nature and every message it conveys is the basis of this approach in wine production and therefore, it does not surprise that the Krauthaker wines win a large number of awards and recognitions at competitions all over the world.\n\nHere is also the indispensable Ivan Enjingi who showed how one good decision can affect the entire wine culture. He stopped with the sale of wine in barrels and was the first to buy equipment for bottling wine, thus taking a significant step for the development of winemaking in the entire region.\n\nSince that distant year of 1972, half a century has passed and the name of Enjingi has become a synonym for quality. The best proof for this is the first golden Decanter award for Croatia in 2004. Winning the world’s most prestigious wine award is the result of many years of effort and dedication to excellence which has always been the guideline for Mr. Enjingi’s work.\n\nAnd this was just the beginning as the wines of this winery won so many awards that we cannot even list them all here. The Enjingi Wine Symphony, a piece of classical music composed by Mr. Davor Bobić and inspired by both the unique wines and the winemaker himself, is also an example of how strong the impression and impact of Mr. Enjingi’s appearance can be.\n\nThere is also Josip Galić, a young winemaker whose relatively new winery keeps inextricable ties with tradition. He has been familiar with wine from an early age and did his first jobs in his parents’ small vineyard where wines were made for personal use, family and friends. Mr. Galić also remembers with joy his grandfather Rudolf, who grew the black variety of grapes, and his grandmother, who simply adored that variety.\n\nStarting his own wine production was a dream that encouraged Mr. Galić to start by his own the project of a modern, successful and exemplary winery. The passion for wine is visible in every detail of his winery, from the architectural design of the exterior building to every barrel, pipe and winemaking equipment in its interior.\n\nThe whole winery was built in the sign of number 9 and the numbers from which 9 can be derived. This number is present in as many places and details as possible. Thus, the building has 3330 square meters, the metal barrels are from 330 to 900 litres and the annual production is 333,000 litres. More important than all the details is the feeling of love for wine, which you can feel here at every step.\n\nThe winning combinaton of tradition and innovation, youth and experience, the conservation of what is and its continuous improvement can be experienced with any family and individual who deal with winemaking. Majetić, Sontacchi, Zorić, Adžić, Sajfert, Fumić, Tandara, Vuković, Markota, Ćasić… You will encounter all these names and many more when exploring the World of Graševina.\n\nWhich winery and wine tasting room you visit first, whose wine you will taste first, is less important – what is really important is the fact that you can always count on one thing – in each of them, you will encounter the well-known Slavonian hospitality of your host. He will always await you with widely open arms and a warm heart sharing with joy his wine story with you."
