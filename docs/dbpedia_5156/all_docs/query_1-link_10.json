        "text": "June 2, 2023 – Step into the unique world of Kutjevo, a renowned wine region in Croatia, where a remarkable project awaits wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs.\n\nAfter a record-breaking year in 2022, during which Kutjevo Winery sold 5.3 million liters of wine, including 400,000 liters of the best-selling Vrhunska Graševina, the year 2023 marks the opening of the restored Turković cellar from 1896 and the introduction of an exceptional project—the Trezor 1232, the first vine vault of its kind in Croatia and this part of Europe.\n\nWINE VAULT FOR PASSIONATE WINE LOVERS\n\nLocated in the depths of the cellar, which houses a total of 40 premium Slavonian oak wine barrels, Kutjevo Winery has unveiled a wine vault, an exclusive space where their clients can store their prized bottles from the Koria, de Gotho, and Maximo premium wine labels.\n\nLucky individuals, wine lovers, and enthusiasts will have the opportunity to deposit their favorite wine labels from these collections for a recommended period of several years under the care of Kutjevo’s enologists, allowing the wine to reach its full potential.\n\nThe Trezor 1232 is situated in the space that once housed Croatia’s first glass wine cistern in Croatia, which Kutjevo Winery decided to repurpose into a vault due to its ideal conditions for wine storage.\n\n“Koria, de Gotho, and Maximo are wine lines with great aging potential, representing the terroir and specific characteristics of Kutjevo’s renowned grape varieties, and with this new and unique project, Kutjevo Winery aims to elevate the wine culture and scene to a higher level.\n\nFurthermore, the idea is to educate consumers and premium wine enthusiasts to exercise patience and wait for the purchased wine to reach its full potential”, explained Dino Galić, a member of the management board of Kutjevo d.d.\n\nHow Does Trezor 1232 Work?\n\nAlthough the vault has a capacity for 1232 positions, the number of positions an individual or company can lease is limited to six.\n\n“We wanted to give our clients the opportunity to age their favorite premium labels, and the duration will depend on the chosen label. All wines deposited in Trezor 1232 have a specific year until they are recorded in the vault.\n\nFor example, the Pinot Noir de Gotho 2020 will be best aged in the vault until December 1, 2025, while the recommended aging period for the Graševina de Gotho 2020 is until December 2026.\n\nA panel of experts, led by Saša Špiranec and including wine connoisseurs Rene Bakalović, Ivan Kozarčanin, and Darko Lugarić, helped us determine the specific years when each label reaches its full potential,” added Ivan Marinclin, the head enologist of Kutjevo Winery.\n\nWhat Happens When You Lease a Position in the Vault?\n\nUpon leasing a position in the vault, customers receive a gift package that includes an ID card with the necessary information, such as the position of their wine, vintage labels indicating the year until the wine will age in Trezor 1232, and the deposit date recorded in the vault.\n\nIn addition, the buyer receives a membership token, which grants them regular tastings in Kutjevo Winery, ensuring exclusive access to the wines and gastronomy experiences within the vault.\n\nThe gift package also includes a special vial with a cork stopper containing a sample of the soil on which the wine was produced.\n\nFind awarded and premium wine labels of Kutjevo Winery at wineandmore.com\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
