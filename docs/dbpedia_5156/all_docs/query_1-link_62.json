        "text": "The Croatian Competition Agency declared the agreements entered into by Dukat and Konzum, and Kutjevo and KTC, null and void. At the same time it imposed sanctions for the infringements of Competition Act to the undertakings concerned in total amounting to 1.63 million Kuna.\n\nIn both cases it was established that the undertakings concluded prohibited vertical agreements causing harm to the consumers and imposing restraint on competition.\n\nIn the first case, with regard to the agreement concluded between the undertakings Dukat and Konzum, the CCA found that the annexes to the sales agreement which were concluded between these parties from January 2009 to January 2011 contained provisions that were binding for Konzum in so far as the latter was obliged to apply minimum wholesale and retail prices imposed by the undertaking Dukat. If Konzum as a buyer would not comply with these restrictive provisions, Dukat could have terminated the supply of its products.\n\nIn the second case, regarding the agreement concluded between the undertakings Kutjevo and KTC, the CCA found that the agreement between these two undertakings which was in force from January 2010 to April 2011 contained provisions on the basis of which Kutjevo as the supplier of products imposed on KTC the agreed minimum resale price restrictions in regard to its final consumers, as it was clearly defined in the appendix to the agreement. If KTC would not comply with these restrictive provisions, Kutjevo could have unilaterally terminated the agreement.\n\nIn both above mentioned cases the CCA established hardcore restrictions of competition rules on the account of the fact that provisions in agreements involving vertical price restrictions or minimum resale price restrictions are always prohibited regardless of the fact whether they have actually been applied or not, and regardless of the market share of the parties to the agreement. These provisions restrict the seller to freely set the prices which directly affects the interests of the final consumers.\n\nHowever, taking into account that the currently valid Competition Act entered into force on 1 October 2010, it could have been applied in both above described cases of established prohibited vertical agreements only to the period after its entry into force. In other words, and it has been stated in the decision of the CCA, the duration of the prohibited agreement between Dukat and Konzum was from 1 October 2010 to 17 January 2011, whereas the duration of the prohibited agreement between Kutjevo and KTC was from 1 October 2010 to 15 April 2011.\n\nGiven their market position and significance in the Croatian market regarding their line of business the undertakings concerned undoubtedly must have been acquainted with competition rules. However, when imposing the sanctions, the CCA took into account the fact that the duration of the established infringements was relatively short and that the prohibited provisions actually did not apply and therefore did not significantly impede competition.\n\nThe CCA also took into account the fact that the participating undertakings revised the challenged provisions on their own initiative before the CCA initiated the proceeding and that the new agreement entered into by Dukat and Konzom on 17 January 2011 and the new agreement entered into by Kutjevo and KTC on 15 April 2011 did not contain the minimum resale price restrictions i.e. the minimum prices below which the seller may not sell the products of the supplier to the final consumer.\n\nHence, the fines imposed by the CCA on the parties to the prohibited agreements were symbolic, in compliance with their market position and financial and market power: Dukat was fined 800,000 Kuna, Konzum 600,000 Kuna, whereas the fine imposed on Kutjevo amounted to 130,000 Kuna and to KTC 100,000 Kuna.\n\nIn both cases it is the opinion of the CCA that these symbolic fines are adequate for the said infringements, at the same time producing a preventive effect on the participating undertakings but also a deterrent effect which should keep other undertakings from any further infringements of competition law. Namely, rules of competition law are mandatory rules and the undertakings must become aware that agreements between them cannot change this fact."
