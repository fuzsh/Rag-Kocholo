        "text": "As the summer looks to wind down so does our number of sections. The second to last Rosé in this series brings us to Croatia from winemakers Kutjevo d.d.. Kutjevo Rosé is produced in the region of Slavonia at the Danube-Kutjevo Vineyard. Made with a variety of Pinot Noir and Zweigelt, Kutjevo has an alcohol content of 12.5% with suggested pairings being of the lighter food variety. This was an unexpected pick for us as we have never tried a Croatian Rosébefore, but we were pleasantly surprised during our tasting. Light, with a slight bitterness, this Rosé has a very good acidity. It possesses a fresh taste with strong hints of berries that come through. We did not pair this with any foods and it was still very good on it’s own. While it doesn’t quite beat our two top summer favorites so far (Vē-Vē and Olivares) it’s a step below which isn’t that bad of a place to be."
