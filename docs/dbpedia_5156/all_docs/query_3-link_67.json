From what I can tell it is very much like Italy terrain and architecturally, 1% of entire country is under vine (that is a lot of grapes!) and is supposed to be a better value compared to other mediterranean countries.\n\nWere going to be in France early fall and looking for someplace new for an add on week. We like to cycle, eat great food, visit wineries, hike, explore.\n\nTIA\n\nOh Slovenia is pretty sweet… went for 2 weeks last summer Croatia and Slovenia… I really liked most of Slovenia.\n\nLjubljana- fun, young, hip definitely. some really good food.\n\nLake Bled - spend 2-3 days here… the lake is beautiful, and there’s some cool drives/hikes around the area, including an interesting gorge hike/walk\n\nCaves - there are a few famous ones… we went to two with names starting with Skoc and Post… i forget the full names. One is more touristy… one is more intimate… both are awesome.\n\nSo yah 1 weeek add on. perfect timing. .hit it.\n\nhere is my post about croatia on another thread fwiw:\n\nI was in Croatia back in July. We had an amazing trip driving the country side and cruising along the Adriatic. We visited several wineries near Zagreb and also from the island of Hvar, Mljet and Korcula. The standout wineries/wines for me were:\n\nTomac - the winery is located near Jasterbarsko (about 30 minutes away from Zagreb). They make Pinot Noirs, Rieslings, White Blends (Chardonnay and other locally grown varieties), but their claim to fame is their sparkling wines. The winemaker (Tomislav) spent time learning/working in Champagne – which you can clearly see in his wines (taste, profile, style, etc.) Probably the top sparking producer in the country according to Edi Maletic and Ivan Pejic (the two Croatian Research Scientists who were credited in tracing the Zinfandel’s root back to Croatia) – and I wholeheartedly agree. Keep an eye out for this.\n\nKorak – also near Jasterbarsko ,sits on top of a hill with a stunning panoramic view of the lush country side with neatly lined up rows of vines ala Germany’s Mosel Region. Arguably the top Pinot Noir producer in the country – the 07 Pinot Noir was my wine of the trip (perfect balance – fruit, structure, acidity and length). Also keep an eye out for this.\n\nZlatan – from the island of Hvar. The Barrique Plavac Mali along with the Reserve Plavac Mali was pretty darn tasty. We docked on the other side of the island and loaded up on these puppies. We ran out halfway through our voyage so we stocked up via Konzum (THE grocery chain of Croatia).\n\nBibich – there was a Bibich wine outlet in Vodice – nice wines (white and red).\n\nKutjevo – they make a nice Grasevina. Light, crisp and refreshing. They are pretty much available everywhere. They also come in 1ltr bottles. A nice qpr.\n\nThe people in Croatia are warm, friendly and generous. You will have a great time in Rovinj. Love the narrow hilly streets. Dubrovnik was quite a site, I would’ve enjoyed it more but the temp was just too freakin hot.\n\nSretan put,\n\nSo this is our itinerary starting in Dubrovnik and ending in Split.\n\n“This self guided bike tour is covering all the most important and most beautiful sites of Dalmatia, coastal part of Croatia. We can suggest and provide accommodation in Dubrovnik for you, and you should spend 1 or 2 nights there. Dubrovnik’s historical sites as well as the old town can be seen in 1 day. In this day you will have time to relax, besides visiting the sites. It is very touristic town, but worth visiting. You should definitely walk the city walls (if they are not packed with guests from tour ships) from where you will have great view on the old town and endless sea. We will pick you up from your accommodation and transfer to peninsula Peljesac, where your bike tours starts. This is due to heavy traffic coming to/from Dubrovnik on the only road that connects Dubrovnik with the rest of Croatia. You will spend 2 nights in Korcula and Hvar town, both being probably most beautiful and well preserved ancient towns. You will have 2 days on each island and plenty of time to explore the coast, rural and ancient villages, eat great homemade food, and choose your bike distance, from easy to very long and hard rides. Connection between those 2 islands, Hvar and Korcula is done with private 8 or 9 meter power boat, which is very safe and stabile – definitely another highlight of your bike trip. Finish your self guided tour in 1700 years old town Split, cultural and administrative centre of Dalmatia. Easy biking is possible in Split as well. Connections between Peljesac and Korcula, Hvar and Split are provided by official ferry company, which is another authentic experience. Both of those ferries depart several times a day, so you can decide when to leave. Of course, all of this will be explained to your during the welcome briefing.\n\nBeing local’s we can proudly say this tour covers the most beautiful area of Croatian coast in a very short time!”\n\nThanks for the input!"
