        "meta_description": "In the Croatian fauna, horseflies (Tabanidae) are represented by 78 species belonging to two subfamilies, five tribes, and 10 genera. Identification of these species is based on morphological characteristics. In this study, 43 species of horseflies were analyzed. The highest number of species (19) belongs to the genus Tabanus, followed by the genera Hybomitra with seven species, Haematopota with six species, Chrysops with four species, Atylotus and Philipomyia with two species each, and the genera Silvius, Dasyrhamphis, and Heptatoma with one species each. The standard DNA barcoding region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene, subunit I (COI), was sequenced and compared to the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). Our analyses confirmed our morphological identifications and added 16 new Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) for Tabanidae to BOLD. Potential problems in the systematics and taxonomy of this family are highlighted.",
