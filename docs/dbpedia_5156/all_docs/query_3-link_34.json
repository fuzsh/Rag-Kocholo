        "text": "We left the hotel in Plitvice National Park early in the morning.\n\nThere was a long line of people from different tour groups waiting at the entrance to the hotel’s restaurant before its opening time of 7:00am. It looked like a lot of folks had early departures.\n\nBy this time in the trip, the urge to try all the different things available in the breakfast buffet was subsiding. Eggs and a chocolate croissant (if available) with some juice and a cup of coffee were sufficient to keep me going till lunch time.\n\nThis was a view outside the window of the bus early in the drive. I had the sun in my eyes.\n\nWe were stuck behind a convoy of logging trucks as we were passing through the village of Korenica. In fact we were rudely cut off by one of these trucks earlier, the truck driver probably hastening onto the main road to catch up to his buddies up ahead.\n\nThe region we were passing through has a village called Smiljan. It was settled by Serbs after the Battle of the Field of Blackbirds in Kosovo. (I mentioned this battle in my previous blog.) Nicola Tesla was born in the village of Smiljan. There is a memorial complex and a museum in his honor there. Croatia is one among the few countries who claim Tesla as their own.\n\nWe passed Udbina, the village where Tito’s wife was born. We were driving in the valley of Krabava, also called Krbava field (Krbavsko polje). This is the area of a battle between the Croatians and the Ottomans in 1493. This picture shows the Catholic Church of the Croatian Martyrs in the village of Udbina – on the hill. This region has a significant population of people of Serbian origin, and Udbina is apparently still majority Serb.\n\nThis is a rural region with farming, apiculture, lifestock, etc… The newer source of income for the locals is rural tourism. You can live with the farmers and do outdoor activities with them and by yourself. Very noticeable were the many wildflowers beside the road that we were driving on.\n\nWe were about to cross the Velabit mountain range. Dalmatia, the region that we would be ending our travels in, is on the other side of these mountains.\n\nWe were told that the Croatians talk about the 4 different winds that blow through this region. Two of them were expanded upon:\n\nThe cold Bora winds blow over (catapult over!) the Velabit mountains from the north in winter. A wind speed of 304 kmph wind has been reported on one occasion. Locals know when the wind is coming. The wind clears the sky and the locals like it. It gives energy to people. The skies are clear and there is no pollution.\n\nThe Jugo wind blows in the opposite direction over the mountains. These are hot winds and it is very rainy. The mood is more melancholy. Fishermen are aware when these winds blow. They do not go out to sea during these times.\n\nWe were told that the weather was quite different on the two sides of the mountains. Dalmatia was hotter. I checked the air temperature before we entered the Sveti Rok tunnel that would take us to the other side of the mountains. It was 17.1° C. This tunnel is more than 5 km long. It is the second longest tunnel in Croatia. (Construction on this tunnel started in 1993. The first tube of the tunnel was opened in 2003.)\n\nThere is apparently a higher proportion of roads to railroads in Croatia than in other European countries.\n\nWe crossed the mountains via the tunnel into the region of Dalmatia. After exiting the tunnel, the road descended down the side of a ridge following a path that included two switchbacks with three tunnels along the way. We got our first view of the Adriatic between the first two tunnels (the Ledenik and the Bristovac) .\n\nThis was the view entering the last switchback after exiting the last tunnel (the Celinka Tunnel).\n\nWe made a rest stop as we were descending down the mountain to sea level. (A suggestion was made to try the cream cake, a specialty of the region, here.)\n\nAn issue with the seating arrangements for tour members who were traveling by themselves came to a head while we were at this stop. They were supposed to get an additional space on the bus if available because they pay a surcharge. Mira was not good at enforcing discipline, and we did have a few aggressive characters on the bus who claimed seats for themselves and created a situation. Seating arrangements for the next day were adjusted as a result of a conversation that took place here.\n\nI wanted to check the change in the air temperature after crossing the mountains. It was 25° C on the bus after we left the rest stop, much higher than what it was before we entered the Sveti Rok tunnel.\n\nWe passed the Maslenica Bridge as we got closer to sea level. Beyond the bridge lies the Adriatic sea. The Maslenica bridge and the bridge that we were on carry traffic over a strait that connects the Adriatic to a bay called Novigrad Sea. The Maslenica bridge was destroyed during the Homeland war in 1991. At that time it provided the primary connection between Zagreb and Split by land. The bridge that we were on was only completed in 1997. The bridge that you see in the picture was reopened only in 2005. There was a temporary solution for crossing the strait that was devised during the time when neither of the bridges were in existence.\n\nWe passed Zadar, the location of an underwater architectural piece of art called the Sea Organ. Harmonious sounds emanate when the waves hit the sea organ. We had no time to stop at Zadar.\n\nWe heard that there is a leisurely way of life in Dalmatia, and that they are a romantic people. They listen to Klapa acapella music. We listened to music from Croatia on the bus at this point. We heard about one of the famous musicians from Split, the city were were about to visit. His name was Oliver Dragojević. He was revered by the people. He died recently. The whole country mourned his death and the government also declared a national day of Condolences in his honor. Apparently, his last journey on a boat to his hometown on an island for burial was an event that was followed by all Croatians. We listened to one of his songs on the bus.\n\nTrivia: There are about 1200 islands of Croatia on the Adriatic. There is even a Wikipedia page with statistics on some of the bigger ones.\n\nWe passed the village of Skradin, located in a narrow bay of the Adriatic, where Bill Gates has some property. He owns a yacht that is berthed there. Celebrities like to vacation on the Adriatic Coast of Croatia and some own property there.\n\nFrom my position near the front of the bus I noticed that they have bridges for wildlife crossing over the highway. This particular one had a sign that showed a bear and what looked like a fox.\n\nWe stopped at one more rest area just before exiting the highway. It was a pit-stop so that we could start our tour as soon as we reached our destination in Split without have to look for a restroom there. Drazn was in a good mood and picked up the microphone to tell us the story of how his parents gave him and his brother their names when they were born. Because of the times they were born in, there was apparently a suggestion by one of the parents to name the child Elvis! Drazn was happy that this suggestion did not stick! Drazn retires from his job as a tour bus driver after this trip.\n\n(More Trivia: Apparently, Croatian soccer teams do not use foreign players. Also, Croatia used to have different prices for things for foreigners and locals. That practice is disallowed by law these days. Also, Croatia is spelt Hrvatska in Croatian, and the suffix for Croatian Internet websites is “.hr”.)\n\nAs we were arriving in Split, we crossed a cutting in a ridge, after which the highway wound its way down the hillsides to reveal this impressive view of the Fortress of Klis. (I had to take this picture out of the other side of the bus! I got a better picture of the fortress the next day.) The fortress is located in a pass that separates the mountains of Mosor and Kozjak. The fortress has played a very important role in Croatian history over the centuries, protecting the region from many different invasions, and also serving as the residence for many rulers. The Illyrians first built the fort. The fortress overlooks the cities of Solin (ancient Roman city of Salona) and Split which neighbor each other. Over the course of history, the fortress was taken over by the Romans, Ottomans, Venetians and Austrians, all of whom made modifications to the fort. The Wikipedia site for the fortress makes for fascinating reading.\n\nWe passed the aqueduct that fed water to Split.\n\nThe name of the city is said to have been derived from Spiny Broom that grows in the area. (It is a variety of Spanish Broom.) Split was started by the Greeks in 3rd century BC. The Illyrian’s came in the 7th century AD. The Romans came next. Diocletan’s palace was built over the old Greek town. This palace represented the extent of the Roman city in those days. Split is now the second largest city in Croatia. Traditional industries like concrete, chemicals, and paper are making a comeback. It has Croatia’s largest shipbuilding facility. It has the largest airport in Croatia after Zagreb. The city has become more popular after Game of Thrones.\n\nWe arrived at the historical section of the city, next to the port, where the Palace of Diocletian is located. The palace is the central attraction in Split. (The rest of this big city creates the impression of being like any other bustling metropolis – people, homes, commercial areas, parks, public transportation, etc…)\n\nOur guide’s name was Verdana. She could not be missed – tall and well-built, dressed to be noticed, and with a big personality. She spoke with a perfect American accent, while admitting that she had not visited the US. (She had picked up the accent from watching American TV shows.) And above all, she exuded confidence and knew her stuff!\n\nWe toured Diocletian’s palace. Diocletian was a Roman emperor from the late 3rd century AD. He was not of noble descent. He was born in a poor family in the town of Salona (today called Solin). He abdicated the throne after 21 years and retired to the palace that he had built for this purpose in Split. The scholars today think it took 10 years to build the palace. (The palace was used recently for the filming of a season of Game of Thrones.) We entered the palace from the South Gate (The Bronze Gate).\n\nI tried to take a picture of a display of a re-creation of the layout of the original palace but it did not come out well. I had to resort to downloading a picture from the Internet!\n\nThe sea used to come all the way up to the south gate in those days.\n\nDiocletian persecuted the Christians. He was brutal. The Christians who came later had their revenge by destroying Roman artifacts in the palace.\n\nThe Venetians built a star shaped castle around Diocletian’s Palace in the 15th century that encompassed the expanded city of Split of that time. The walls eventually included five bastions as illustrated in this article.\n\n(Trivia: The language in use in Split includes elements of Italian since the city used to be part of the Venetian empire. )\n\nWe went to the paid section of the cellars of the palace (otherwise known as the basement). There is apparently another section of the cellars that one can can visit for free where there are many activities for tourists to indulge in. The cellars supported the palace above it, and used to provide a place of storage and for other activity. People used to live in this space in later years. In the more recent years, it became the garbage and sewage dump for people living above. There are holes on top of the basement for dumping from above. It actually used to be used as a septic tank! It was cleaned out only during more recent times, when archeologists rediscovered the cellars of the palace (in the 19th century) and started the restoration process. The cellars have been open to the public only since the 1960s. The eastern section of the basement only opened to the public in the 1990s. (I have to believe that access to the cellars played a very important role in making Split the popular tourist destination it is today.) The hall in the picture above is below the reception hall of the palace. It was apparently used as a dragon dungeon in one season of the Game of Thrones!\n\nBig holes on both sides of the second room of the basement that we visited provide ventilation to the cellars. We saw one of the original beams for supporting the basement roof in a third room. We also saw the original garbage dumped from above that had accumulated in a space and had not been cleared out.\n\nThe wells near the entrance to the cellars are from Greek times (3rd century BC).\n\nAlso near the entrance to the cellar museum, unrelated to the artifacts of the palace itself, on the wall, was a 3-D topographical map of the area near Split showing the path along which water was brought down from the mountains to the city during Roman times. The map also shows the location of two aqueducts that were a part of this system. They were built to carry water through a valley.\n\nWe walked up to the main level of the palace. People live in the rooms that remain of the palace.\n\nThere were locals hanging out along with the tourists. We walked past the Ethnographic museum. To the left of the picture above are the remains of the imperial apartments. The space has lost its roof, but one is allowed to enter.\n\nWe heard klapa music in the Vestibule, or the Rotunda. (You can make out the top of the bell tower in the corner of the opening in the roof in the picture below.) The groups sing there regularly because of the great acoustics of the space. According to the Wikipedia article on the subject, Klapa music includes four parts – the base, baritone, and two tenors. There can be many singers in a group, and women also sing klapa music. Some of the harmonies I heard sound remarkably similar to those I hear in barbershop music. You can hear a sample here.\n\nThe next stop was at the main square, called the Peristyle. Sphinxes from Roman times, mostly destroyed, surround this space. This is a picture of one of the sphinxes.\n\nThe Bell tower and Jupiter’s temple are on two sides of this space.\n\nThe Christians converted Jupiter’s temple to a baptistry dedicated to St. John.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Dominus lies behind the bell tower. It originally used to be a mausoleum to Diocletian but was repurposed by the Christians later in history. It is one of the oldest Catholic cathedrals in the world that remains in use in its original structure, without a complete renovation at a later date. The bell tower was added only in later years.\n\nThe organized tour ended in another square just next to Diocletian’s Palace called Radić Brothers Square (or Fruit Square), with its statue of Marko Marulic, the national poet of Croatia. In the background is the Venetian Tower and what remains of the Venetian castle built in the 15th century. On the other side of the square is the Milesi Palace, dating back to the 17th century.\n\nWe had to walk down an alleyway that they called the narrowest street in Split in order to get to this square.\n\nWe had time on our hands on our own after this for the rest of the afternoon to get lunch and then explore the port and the rest of the palace area. We would leave for our hotel after that.\n\nWe walked along the promenade to look for a place that had been recommended for its pizza. We passed Republic Square.\n\nWe had lunch at the restaurant in the picture below. It was such a pleasant day that the glass wall of the restaurant was fully open to the outdoors. Lunch was a very nice and easygoing affair, with a very pleasant waiter. I also had a refreshing wheat beer!\n\nAfter lunch, we walked back to the palace, some of the walk taking us along the seawall.\n\nI really like the architecture of the older buildings in Split. Here is a set of homes that caught my attention.\n\nWe went to a place in the palace that was supposed to have the best gelato in the city. After that, we arrived at the Gold gate (North Gate), with its statue of Gregory of Nin, a Croatian bishop who was known for promulgating Catholicism in Croatia (by being inclusive of the local ways), while at the same time being strongly opposed to the dictates for the pope.\n\nAt this point, our little subgroup split (get it?!) to go different ways. I walked back by myself to the bell tower to climb it and get a view of the city. It was a good climb to the top, somewhat challenging in certain sections in its nature. I did get some good views. The pictures are in my gallery. I will only include a couple of the views here. This is a closeup of the Silver Gate. This picture is of the bay. You can see the port of Split and the railroad station near the harbor in other pictures.\n\nAfter the tour, during the ride to the hotel that we were staying at that night (The Atrium), we heard that the Jewish people came to Split during the Spanish Inquisition. They were apparently well respected. Everything was good until WW2 when Italians and Nazis came. There are not many Jewish people remaining in Split. A small synagogue still remains that is still in use.\n\nOur hotel was in a mixed residential and commercial section of town. We checked into the hotel after our arrival there. Drazn had gone the extra mile by getting to the hotel before us, getting our rooms assigned, and having our bags put into the rooms.\n\nI have this faint recollection of the buffet dinner in the hotel not being that great. In general, this was, unfortunately, not an impressive hotel. Our room was strange with a support pillar next to the bed. Everybody we spoke to had problems in their rooms with the bathroom fixture to hold the shower head up, an interesting challenge for a tour group in which a majority of folks were of retirement age! Others had issues getting the soap dispenser to dispense soap. Some reverse-engineering was required address the issue.\n\nAt dinner time, I went up to the bar in the reception area of the hotel to get some scotch (for the first time during the trip). It turned out to be very expensive, and the pegs are rather small in Europe. I got an extra hit of my drink when I tried to double the quantity – as the bartender emptied what was left in the bottle without charging me!\n\nThe research work I did for this particular blog indicates to me that the palace in Split is a very popular tourist destination. There are many people who have written about their experiences here. The area in and around Diocletian’s palace are indeed very nice to visit.\n\nThis is the gallery in which I have posted all my pictures for the day. In general, there is too much material to be able to cover in a single blog!\n\nWe left Slovenia that day. Our destination for the day was the Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia.\n\nWe were back in the countryside soon after leaving Bled.\n\nMira offered a tribute to Slovenia as we were leaving:\n\nShe called the country an unknown gem. It has a good economy, is well organized, has a lot of recreational opportunities, and healthy people. There are centenarians who live in the mountains.\n\nThe country has a population of about 2.1 million. It is a beautiful country. They invest in the quality of life. They have a good health care system. They nurture family life, communing with nature, and have healthy living habits. They teach kids about the outdoors – to ride bikes, hiking, etc… They teach them cooking when they are young.\n\nShe noted that mobile services and streaming video services are cheap in Slovenia. She made a comment about computer literacy being low, but I have found no data on the Internet to back this up.\n\nWe stopped at the Novo Mesto rest area once again on our way back to Croatia. (We had stopped on the other side of the highway on our way from Zagreb to Lubljana.)\n\nIn general, Slovenian’s appear to be very conscious of the need to maintain a balance between the needs and wants of humans, and the preservation of nature. We heard that Slovenians even care about the safety of their frogs. There are frog-crossings in Slovenia to prevent them from being squashed by vehicles on the road. I am reminded of how the Slovenians are also deeply involved in apiculture. Perhaps Mira is right in her praise of all things Slovenian!\n\nOur route to Plitvice Lakes National Park took us past Zagreb. We did not pause our travels as we drove by.\n\nMira dug back into the history of the lower Balkans during this part of the drive. Some of the information was repetitive, but there were also some interesting nuggets of information.\n\nThe Illyrians who were the early settlers to the land were amazing warriors who lived in tribes. But they did not form states and empires. The tribes used to fight between themselves, which made them vulnerable to outside forces. The Romans, who were initially invited to the help them against the Greeks, took over and settled for 800 years. (They called this the region of Imona.) It was a peaceful assimilation.\n\nThe border between the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empires during the time of the Tetrarchy was between Bosnia and Serbia. The capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) was in Constantinople.\n\nCharlemagne came to power during the 8th century after the fall of the Roman empire and reunified the west. He converted the people to Catholicism. Croatia received Papal recognition as a state earlier in the 9th century when Branimir was the ruler. Croatia was recognized as a kingdom (or country) in the 10th century. The 12th to 14th centuries were the heyday of Croatia. (Trivia – Croat is an ethnic designation while Croation is a national designation.)\n\nOttomans moved into the region through Bulgaria. They never took over Slovenia. (The Ottomans were supposedly actually small in their numbers when they invaded.) They introduced taxes in the areas that they conquered. The Devshirme was an especially bloody form of taxation in the Balkans – they took away the first born in a family when the child was 7 or 8 years old and trained the child to become a Janissary, one of the elite soldiers of the Ottoman Empire. The children converted to Islam and they would eventually forget their parents, perhaps even being prepared to kill them for the Ottoman cause. They were eunuchs. The Ottomans also converted locals in the areas that they conquered to Islam. Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro and parts of Bulgaria have Muslim populations today.\n\nThe 16th century Hapsbergs knew that the Ottomans were dangerous. They settled Serbs in the border area of Croatia with the objective of creating a military border to stop the Ottomans. Serbs and Croats lived together in this area. They spoke the Serbo-Croatian language and had their own identity. When the Croatian nation came into being in the 1990s, there were concerns about the Serbo-Croatian community losing its identity. There was politics about domination by and ethnic group in Croatia, and persecution of the minority population. Serbo-Croatians are now recognized as a national minority, and they have seats in parliament.\n\nIn 1941 Serbia and Bulgaria were attacked by the Nazis. Mussolini invaded Montenegro. A puppet Nazi state was also set up in Croatia. (The Jewish population in Croatia was targeted for genocide during this time. So was the Serbian population.) Serbia was liberated by Russia and they still have policies that are more Russian oriented. Bulgaria and North Macedonia are also apparently aligned with Russia.\n\nThen came the times of Tito. Yugoslavia used to be a socialist country in those days. An interesting piece of trivia is that there are no memorials to Lenin in Yugoslavia in spite of that, including in parts of the lower Balkans that are still aligned with Russia.\n\nConflicts between the different countries of the former federation continue. They have different religions, history, and different economic levels. Croatians were upset since they were the givers into the system. Croatia was the third region to get their independence.\n\nSlobodan Milošević exacerbated the issues in Kosovo especially when he went to the Field of Blackbirds in Kosovo in 1989. This is site of the pivotal 1389 Field of the Blackbirds (Kosovo Polje) battle between the Serbs and the Ottomans. Serbia lost, but both the leaders of Serbia and the Ottoman Empire were killed in the battle. It was the beginning of the fall of Serbia. The Kosovo conflict is still going on.\n\nDr Franjo_Tuđman was the first president of Croatia. He led Croatia in the process of its becoming an independent country.\n\nWe stopped at a rest area on the highway, after Zagreb near the the town of Karlovec, to pick up something for lunch. It was too early in the day to eat immediately. I got myself a sandwich. I managed to find my chocobar ice cream! The rest area was run by the hotel chain Movenpick. You can actually rent rooms in the rest area for the night.\n\nAnd then we were passing through Karlovac. The city was built as a citadel to stop the Ottomans. Four rivers pass through the area of Karlovac. The city was badly damaged in the homeland war between the Croatians and Serbians. There is a big and historic brewery in town. It was taken over by Heineken in 2003. They have been producing the local Karlovačko beer using only Croatian barley since 2015.\n\nThe drive beyond Karlovac, heading further south at this point, was with the border with Bosnia to our left, beyond some hills. Apparently, the border area in Croatia is mainly forest land with some abandoned homes these days. There was fighting here during the homeland war of the 1990s. Serbs were trying to claim some of the land for a Greater Serbia. The area was also bombed. The local Serbian population (settled here from the time of the Hapsbergs!) had to flee in certain instances. (I cannot help but despair about the kind of misery that we human beings bring upon each other during the course of history in the cause of nationalism. This is pure folly.)\n\nAt this point we were traveling very roughly along the course of the Korana river. This river flows through the lakes that we were about to visit. The river also actually forms the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina in this region.\n\nThen we were passing the village of Rastoke (called Little Plitvice according to Mira). It looked like a touristy area, and it was quite pretty as we descended closer to the level of the Korana river. We crossed the river at Rastoke. The Slunjica river flows into the Korana river in this town. The area has been inhabited since the 16th century. Water power was used for the mills built in the area. There was a fortress built there to defend against the Ottomans. I could not take decent pictures from the moving bus. Also, the view from the other side of the bus – of the river and the village beside the river below us – with its old houses and establishments, and the old bridge across the river, would have been more beautiful and charming. Anybody going to this part of Croatia on their own should make it a point to spend a few hours in this quaint little town. We did not have time for that on this tour.\n\nWe were now back into the region of the Balkans Mountains. There were forests all around us as we approached our destination, the Plitvice Lakes National Park. We entered the park at Entrance 1. We would be slowly making our way on foot through a river canyon, and then by boat on a lake, to the Entrance 2 of the park, where the hotel that we were staying at that night was located. As can be seen above, lakes feed most of the waterfalls in the park. The Korana river flows out of the lowest lake. The river empties into the Black Sea.\n\nOur guide for the day was going to be Sara.\n\nThe area near the entrance of the park was packed with people. While we waited, I had to quickly consume the sandwich that I had picked up at the rest area earlier. Mira had given us incomplete directions about how lunch was going to be handled that day. I should have eaten on the bus!\n\nThe first sight that one gets of waterfalls once one enters the park at this entrance is from a cliff overlooking the canyon. The view was spectacular! The Big Waterfall (that is its name in Croatian – Veliki Slap) seen in the picture above is the only waterfall in the park not fed from a lake. Its source is a stream (called Potok Plitvice on Google maps). If you look at the picture closely, you will notice that there is a boardwalk to provide closer access to Veliki Slap. This pathway appeared to be not in use while we were there.\n\nThis is a visualization of how the lakes in the park feed into each other. The lakes started after the last ice age. Dolomite and limestone form the base of the lakes. We were going to end our visit to the park at the level of the Kozjak Lake. The highest lake in the park is at about 2000 ft.\n\nThis area is said to be rich in its biodiversity, including a variety of flora and fauna. The brown bear and the grey wolf were among the animals specifically mentioned. There are also a variety of fish, including some subspecies that are indigenous to the place.\n\nWe walked down from the lookout point that we were at to the level of the lakes on a trail that followed a series of zigzags, or switchbacks. The trail was overcrowded and the traffic was two way. It was not the most ideal of conditions. It was difficult to position oneself to be able to take pictures. We had a very hard time hearing Sara, or even keeping up with her.\n\nWe got down to the level of Kaluderovac Lake and followed the trail as it made its way across the lake and back. It was quite pretty. The color of the water was quite amazing. Apparently it turns greyer in winter. We walked along the front of a waterfall from one lake to the other. The side trails to some of the sights (including Valeki Slap, it seems) were blocked off. It was a good thing. It was impossible to manage the crowds on the boardwalk. You can also get an idea as to the condition of the boardwalk in one of the pictures above. I cannot imagine what would happen if somebody happened to fall into the water! By this time some of us in the back of the tour group had completely lost contact with Sara on the radio system.\n\nWe made our way past two lakes. Lake Milanovac had a memorial to Gustav Janeček, Czech-Croatian chemist, philosopher and physician who was behind the preservation of this park area and the creation of the space for people to visit. This national park is the oldest one in Croatia, created in 1949.\n\nOne of the members of our group had her wallet stolen from her in this time period. Luckily the wallet was found later by one of the people working in the park. The money had been taken by the pickpocket, but the travel documents, including passport, were left in the wallet. She was grateful for that!\n\nWe crossed over to the other side of the lakes at the far end of Lake Milanovac and, after a short walk, arrived at the ferryboat station on Lake Kozjak.Ferries carry folks across the lake from this point to the area of the park near its Entrance 2 (as indicated on the map). This is where our hotel for the evening was located.\n\nThe area of the ferry station included a large open space with a souvenir shop, restaurant and restroom, along with picnic tables.\n\nThe ride across the lake was a short one. We had been told that there would be an opportunity to see see some waterfalls during the ride. What I ended up seeing was not impressive at all. I wondered if they were the actual waterfalls that we had been told about. Mira was not of much help when I asked her about it.\n\nOnce the boat reached its destination, we had to climb a short hill from the lakeside to the level of our hotel.\n\nWe were told that Hotel Jezero, the place where we were staying, is state owned. It was built during the time of the communists. The hotel appeared to me from the outside to be somewhat simple and functional. It was not showy at all. It did not advertise itself. Our room was quite utilitarian, but big and comfortable. It was actually a very nice place to stay. The inside of the hotel was quite spacious and the staff were super-friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, we had been given a room on the ground floor, and facing the parking lot. (It felt like this kind of a room assignment was happening to us a lot during this trip!)\n\nWe had dinner in the hotel’s restaurant. We had our own assigned seating in the restaurant. They had a nice buffet. The food was good. As is the practice with Gate1, we all got a complementary glass of wine or bottle of beer. The beer served was from Karlovac! The restaurant soon filled up with other tour groups.\n\nI went for a walk by myself in the evening to explore the space near our hotel. Although the area was wooded, there was not much to explore, and I was not even tempted to take pictures. There were a few other hotels in the area, and one of them appeared to be abandoned and in disrepair. I wanted to climb up some stairs to a terrace but had to stop because the steps were rusted. All in all, it was a short walk, and I encountered very few people during the walk.\n\nWe were staying only one night in this hotel. We were to depart early the next morning for Split.\n\nThe pictures for the day are in this gallery.\n\nThe morning started out with a very nice breakfast in the hotel’s restaurant. We had a great open view of Bled Lake and Bled Castle through the glass doors of the restaurant overlooking the lake. The lighting for taking pictures was perfect. And then there was the one hot air balloon! The restaurant’s space was set up with a varied buffet spread, and also included an ala carte item from their breakfast menu. Eating breakfast in moderation during the Gate1 tours requires additional discipline!\n\nAfter breakfast we set out on our tour of Bled (blate) and the surrounding area. A young man whose name was Matko joined us on the bus as our guide as we departed the hotel. He first talked about the history of Bled. The place is first mentioned in the year 1004. Matko mentioned a person named Arnold Rikli from the 1800s who apparently was sick and came here to die, but was cured. He realized that this was a healing place. He figured out that mud pools helped healing. He also found a hot thermal spring. He started developing the place as a destination for healing. In 1906, the first railroad to come through the area provided a link to Vienna. Tourism came eventually.\n\nAgriculture is common in the area surrounding Bled. Bled is close to both Italy and Austria. The town has about 6000 inhabitants. This is the region where the Julian Alps begin. Caravans used to come over these mountains. Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia, can be seen from the area. (Unfortunately, I did not think to search for a view of the mountain and take a picture.)\n\nWe heard that it had snowed a couple of days back in Bled. That was quite surprising considering the conditions that we were experiencing during our visit. The snow did not stick since the temperatures were well past freezing, and it was actually quite pleasant all around.\n\nThe Sava river flows close by the area. This is the region where its two major tributaries, the Sava Dolinka and Sava Bohinjka meet. The latter starts at a location close to where we were, a place that we were going to visit later in the day. This is a watershed area for rivers, and the rivers flow both into the Adriatic Sea and Black Sea.\n\nWe arrived at Bled Castle after a short drive from the hotel. Preparations for an archery competition were going on on the grounds outside the castle when we arrived.\n\nWe crossed a moat and a gate at the outer walls of the castle. During medieval times they used to pour hot oil and shoot arrows down on people who were trying to storm the castle through the gates. It was a steep climb from the outer gate to the inner entrance of the castle. We entered through its oldest tower, arriving at the lower courtyard of the castle.\n\nIn the center of the courtyard was a 12 meter deep well that had been dug through the rock to bring fresh water to the castle. There were places to visit around this courtyard, including the printing works, the “Beehouse”, and a coffee shop.\n\nThere is a beautiful view of mountains and Bled Lake from this courtyard. The color of the water was stunning! (The color has been referred to as turquoise.)\n\nWe took the stairs from the lower courtyard to the upper courtyard, encountering this particular view along the way in a small mid-level courtyard between the two. Bled Island looks very pretty in the middle of the lake.\n\nHere is a picture of the space of the upper courtyard. The king and dukes used to stay in the highest level of the castle. The upper courtyard in this castle was used for outdoor events, and we were told that not all of them were pleasant. To the left of the building seen above is the chapel. The right side has been converted into a museum. The peacock in the yard is one of the symbols of Bled.\n\nMatko noted that the castle was not a place of romantic lore. It used to have dungeons and a prison.\n\nHe also mentioned a vine growing on one of the buildings that was part of the original stock brought from Albania. I could not find a reference to this on the Internet, but I did read that the oldest vine in the world grows in Maribor in Slovenia.\n\nWe visited the museum in the building. The subject matter covered by the museum is quite broad, including both the geography and the history of the region. It is curated by the National Museum of Slovenia. I wish we had a little more time to explore it. I was barely able to pay attention to the narration from Matko while trying to take some pictures. It was too much information!\n\nSome random notes from the museum visit:\n\nThere is a skeleton in the museum of a local lady who we were told was of royal heritage. This skeleton is from the 10th century. The lady died at the age of 20.\n\nBecause of the geography of the area, there used to be a phenomenon where eruptions in the woods would result in iron balls that were about 90% pure being thrown up into the air. The iron used to be collected and processed.\n\nThere was a famous Slovenian knight in the middle ages whose name was Gašper Lamberger (or Laremberg) whose tombstone is at the castle. He apparently won 85 tournaments in a row. (It was difficult to find documentation about Sir Lamberger on the Internet. I did find a very interesting PhD thesis on this topic.) Gašper used to participate in the jousting tournaments in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in Germany at the tail end of the 15th Century.\n\nOne of the rooms has the original wooden beams from the castle that have survived the destruction of the castle by fire.\n\nApparently, it was rare for castles in Slovenia to have toilets in them. The Bled Castle is said to have “the most beautiful toilet” because of the view from its location. (Erasmus of Lueg, a robber baron who was the ruler of the other castle in Slovenia with a toilet in it, was killed on the toilet in that castle. It is a dastardly tale of betrayal!)\n\nThe castle’s printing works contain a replica Gutenberg wooden press which you can use to print a souvenir certificate, with the help of the master printer. We were told that the first book was printed in the castle in 1600. (The first Slovenian book was printed by Primož Trubar in 1550 in Germany.)\n\nSlovenia is known for beekeeping. Bees are exported from the country.\n\nThis website has a list of things to see in the castle.\n\nIt was a short bus ride from the castle to the village along the side of the lake where we would catch the boat to take us to Bled Island. During the bus ride we heard that there is no private property along rivers and lakes in Slovenia. The exception is Tito’s house at Lake Bled. It is called Vila Bled these days, and it is now an upscale hotel.\n\nOther random facts heard during the ride back from the castle:\n\nA fault runs through this area around Bled. It is a source of low energy earthquakes. Also, about 30% of the Slovenian language is derived from Sanskrit. We had heard that the Pagan religion survived in Slovenia till WW2. The form of paganism that was practiced here is similar to the religions of Scandinavia and India. Matko mentioned that Slovenia has the 2nd highest concentration of churches today.\n\nDuring the ride we also heard that Lake Bled formed 14000 to 12000 years back when an earthquake sunk the land. A glacier came through next. It is a very deep lake. The lake is known for fishing. A record breaking 2.45 meter long catfish was caught here in 2014. You can apparently land on a catfish if you fall into the lake during breeding time at a particular spot in front of Vila Bled.\n\nAnd then we were on our way to Bled Island on the boat. One rides on a traditional flat-bottomed wooden boat called a pletna to get there. This is a picture of one of the other boats accompanying ours. The color of water was unreal! These small flat bottomed boats have a single person standing at the back of the boat who propel it forward. The “rowing” action is different from that of a traditional rower. Because of the nature of the boats, they have strict rules about the tourists’ entry and exit from the boats in the harbor area so that the boats remain balanced at all time. You can hear a little bit more about the tradition of the people who row the boats in the link I have provided.\n\nThe island used to have a polytheistic pagan temple consecrating Ziva, the Slavic goddess of love and fertility, originally. The church that exists on the island today is called the Church of our Mother of God on the Lake. The church also goes by the name Church of the Assumption of Mary. There are 99 steps to get to the level of church from the harbor. We walked on a trail that went around the island to get to the level of the church instead, and only took the steps for our return back to the boat.\n\nWe passed a grotto with a spring as we made our way on the trail. I noticed this color of the water in a section of the shoreline. Crazy colors, man!\n\nWe climbed up to the level of the church.\n\nWe were able to enter the church.\n\nThe interior of the church was all white except for the adornments on the walls. This was a very different feel from that of the ornate interiors of churches that we had been to during previous trips to Europe, and even different from some interiors of churches seen earlier during this trip.\n\nNotable was this unusual painting of the circumcision of Jesus.\n\nThe Pope of those times decreed that anyone who rang the bell of the church three times and believed in God would have their wish granted. People in our tour group attempted to ring the bell – with different levels of success. You had to pull hard on the rope to get the process going. The timing was a bit tricky, and some people were more successful in mastering this than others, leading to loud pealing of the bells in these cases. I did not do that well!\n\nI climbed the tower outside the church (seen in one of the pictures above) in record time because there was very little time left before we had to get back to the boat that would take us back to shore. There were bars on the windows in the tower that marred the views. I did not stay long in the tower.\n\nCheck out this color of the water!\n\nOn the boat ride back to the shore, we heard that the city of Trieste that is now in Italy used to be a part of Slovenia till 1960s. There was an episode with a spy that was captured by Italy, and one of the conditions for the return of the spy was the transfer of Trieste to Italy. The actual truth is much more complicated it seems – first of all since Slovenia did not exist at that time. For more details about the history of the Free Territory of Trieste during the Cold War, check out this video.\n\nMatko also said that Slovenia’s national anthem is the only one that is not patriotic. It is more internationalist in theme.\n\nOur next visit was going to be to the Triglav National Park – to the Bohinj Lake and the general area where the Sava Bohinjka river starts its flow.\n\nWe drove past the entrance to Tito’s villa on our way out of Bled. The road that we were on soon dipped to a lower elevation. Matko pointed out that Lake Bohinj was at a lower elevation than Bled. He also noted that the roads in this section were washed away often due to flooding. He pointed out the folly of trying to stand in the way of nature.\n\nWe were told that we were passing a hydroelectric power plant on the river, but I missed it completely because of the low profile of the whole facility. This space that we were driving through is known as an area good for outdoor activity, including things like white water rafting.\n\nWe eventually entered a canyon. The railroad line that runs next to road in this area brings tourists. This line was built in 1906 to connect the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Adriatic and originally ran into Trieste. You can see the path of the railroad tracks on the other side of the Sava Bohinjka river in this picture. They have a steam engine running on the line just for tourists and railroad enthusiasts. Here is another website about the train experience.\n\nWe had a sighting of Mount Triglav during the drive, but I did not realize it at that time! I just happened to take this picture. Mount Triglac is the peak towards the left side of the picture.\n\nWe arrived at Ribčev Laz, the village at the east end of Lake Bohinj. We were entering the area of the massive Triglav National Park at this point. This appears to be a great area for outdoor activities. There were a lot of visitors in the village.\n\nWe heard about the Legend of the golden horn.\n\nWe passed the Church of John the Baptist in the village, on the other side of the bridge across the Bohinjka river. We were offered the opportunity to go to the church itself during the lunch stop on our way back to Bled. We did not take this up.\n\nThere are plenty of hiking trails in the area, including around the lake, and even up to the source of the Sava Bohinjka river. The biggest ski resort in Slovenia is at the top of Mount Vogel at the western end of the lake. (We could see the cable cars that go up to the resort.) Paragliding opportunities exist from both Mount Vogar and Mount Vogel. This was like a paradise for people interested in outdoor activities! This certainly appeared to be a popular area to visit.\n\nWe drove along the southern shore of the lake to its western end, to an area that is called Ukanc. We stopped at a big camping ground on the lake. We had a sweeping view of the mountains beyond the end of the lake from lakeside. We could see the waterfall that is known as the start of the Sava Bohinjka river in the distance. The name of this waterfall is Slap Savica. You can actually hike up to the waterfall. There is an underground lake in the area. That underground lake is the source of Lake Bohinj. If it overflows, the main lake floods by up to 44 feet. The road that we were on would be under water. The Bohinj lake empties the volume of its water three times a year. Lake Bled empties once a year.\n\nWe were told the story of a sunken train in the lake that was blown up during the war. I do not believe that story to be true – for many reasons! It is interesting how the tour guides try to find the stories that they think will catch the interest of their customers.\n\nWe stopped at the village of Ribčev Laz for lunch. Pizza and beer went down nicely at the restaurant. We walked around the village a little bit after lunch. I failed to find the chocobar ice-cream bar I was looking for in the local store!\n\nI was enjoying the sights of the countryside and its villages during our ride back to Bled. I managed to get a picture of St. Nicholas Church in Bohinjka Bistrica. (Santa Claus is popular everywhere!) I also caught sight of this church as we got closer to Bled. To me, there is a certain simplicity in the appearance of the churches in this part of Slovenia, and I appreciate it.\n\nThere was enough time in the evening before dinner to take a walk around Bled Lake after getting back to to town. The distance we covered during the walk was about 6 km. We were able to see Bled Island and its church from different angles. There were a lot of people on the pathway that we were on. There were also people in the water. There was an outdoor event happening at one corner of the lake that we had to negotiate around during the walk.\n\nWe headed out on the bus to Radovljica village for dinner that evening. The Sava Bohinjka and Sava Dolinka rivers meet just outside this village. We walked towards the central section of the old village after being dropped off at what appeared to me to be a bus stand. There was an improvised stop at a village chocolate store that turned into a longer affair than what Mira had anticipated because of a breakdown in group discipline. This threw the timing of the visit off a little bit!\n\nSome of us took an unplanned walk through the village while waiting for those in the store. It was a cute little village, with its quaint streets, old buildings and, on this particular street, outdoor restaurants. There was a church at the end of the street. People were out enjoying the evening. The Austro-Hungarian influence on the architecture of the buildings in the village was obvious.\n\nWe arrived at an overlook where we could look into a valley with the Sava River flowing through it. The view is of a section of the river beyond the confluence of the two tributaries mentioned earlier. I read later that this was also a good viewpoint for Mount Triglav.\n\nWe took a short walk through the village back to the building with the restaurant and a gingerbread museum we were supposed to be visiting. The name of the establishment was Gostilna Lectar Musei. We were greeted by our hostess in front of the establishment.\n\nThe house of the gingerbread factory was built 500 years ago. It used to be part of the local castle. We went downstairs to the gingerbread “museum” for a presentation. We were told that chestnut, honey, and spices are the main ingredients for their gingerbreads They do not use eggs. milk, oil, or butter. There is no ginger in their gingerbread! Apparently, it lasts forever (but they are not supposed to be eaten after some time!). They had some old gingerbread samples to show. Truth be told, I felt that the experience of this visit was not something remarkable.\n\nWe had a very nice time in the restaurant! We were the second Gate1 group to be seated in the restaurant, a little late due to the delay at the chocolate store. The program started with some entertainment. The cultural influence of the countries to the north of Slovenia was obvious from the way the entertainers were dressed, and from the music and dancing. The entertainment included a hat game.\n\nDinner started with soup served in a container of bread. I was wondering what was going to happen with all the leftover bread.\n\nThe group joined in the entertainment activities after dinner, including the hat game and the dancing.\n\nTowards the end of dinner, I requested a topping for my second (or was it third?) glass of wine. The waitress sternly responded, “That is enough!” We had a good laugh over that.\n\nWe walked back to the bus stop for our ride back to Bled. Perhaps because of the influence of the wine, I complained a little bit on the bus, and probably a little more loudly that I usually do, about how I had been unfairly kicked out of the hat game in the restaurant. It was all just in good fun!\n\nIt was quite a late return to the hotel considering the early departure we were going to have the next day.\n\nThe complete set of pictures for the day are saved here.\n\nThe next blog in this series here.\n\nWe left Zagreb early morning, in rush hour traffic. We were headed for the country of Slovenia and the city of Ljubljana, heading almost due west from Zagreb. (In general, Slovenia lies to the northwest of Croatia.)\n\nWe left the city and were into the countryside in a very short while. We crossed the border into Slovenia within an hour of leaving our hotel.\n\nWe were in the rolling hills of the countryside. Mira noted that the mountains in Slovenia are not considered a part of the Balkans. The Julian Alps start soon after Ljubljana and as we get closer to Bled. The Balkan mountains cross the rest of the Balkans from east to west. The word Balkans means wooden forests. They are called the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. Her comment was that the Balkans are the place you stop eating apple strudel and start eating baklava.\n\nThere were more baroque styled buildings along the highway as we headed further into the country. This region used to be the border between the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires.\n\nThe first country to peel off from Yugoslavia in the 1990s was North Macedonia. Apparently, they did so without much fighting. Slovenia and Croatia wanted to separate soon after. The Slovenians met with some resistance to this. (The Croatians had a harder time.) Slovenia achieved nationhood in 1991. They joined the EU in 2003. Immediately after that they became a donor to the system rather than a receiver. (Many new members of the EU usually start out by receiving aid from the organization.) Mira noted that Slovenia was the most eco-friendly country in the Balkans. According to her, they love outdoor activities, including biking and hiking. They are the sportiest nation of Europe. They are very family oriented. The country has the lowest level of crime. They are a very healthy nation! Their population is about 2.1 million.\n\nWe crossed the Krka River and passed a nuclear plant that is is apparently shared with Croatia. The region also uses electricity from thermal and hydroelectric plants.\n\nThis is the entrance to the rest area that we stopped at along the way. (Mira called these places Kiki Riki stops!)\n\nThe road signs for the towns along the highway in Slovenia are interesting, basically including a very specific illustration of what exactly is there to be seen in the area if one were to take the exit. This particular exit is for the former hometown of Melania Knavs, who has gone on to become Melania Trump. Slovenian is the official language of Slovenia. Serbo-Croatian is an older language that was used in the country. English is getting more popular, and, indeed, it was easy for us to get by with English during our visit.\n\nWe were in Ljubljana by mid-morning. Simona, our local tour guide, was waiting for us. She told us that she lived in the city. She also mentioned that it was a safe city. She also claimed that it is a laid back city.\n\nLjubljana is the capital of Slovenia. Mira had told us earlier that the city was clean, compact and organized. We were about to find out! As a part of of its history of the city, Simona noted that the Roman settlement of Emona was created here in the early 1st century. It was destroyed after less than 500 years by Attila the Hun.\n\nWe started walking towards the Old Town, arriving at Prešeren Square along the way.\n\nFrom the square, one can see Ljubljana Castle on the hill behind Old Town, on the other side of the Ljubljanica River.\n\nWe passed through Prešeren Square and in front of the Prešeren Monument that dominates the space. France Prešeren is considered one of Slovenia’s most famous poets. Hovering over him is the statue of his muse, Julija Primic. Simona spoke about the statue and the church, called the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation, that is next to the square. The Triple Bridge, next to the Prešeren Square, crosses the Ljubljanica River into Old Town.\n\nShe noted that cars had been removed from the Old Town area in 2007. The effort was initiated by the mayor in an attempt to make life in the city more pleasant, livable, and sustainable. There was initial resistance to the idea.\n\nWe walked along the side of the river to a second square called Congress Square. Next to the square is the palace that is being used today by the University of Ljubljana. There was construction underway in the square in front of the building.\n\nSimona told us some more about the country of Slovenia. She mentioned that everybody can get a free education until the age of 26. The universities are free. The income tax rate in the country is 45 to 55 percent. They also have a VAT. They have a 4% unemployment rate, and that number is about the same for all types of jobs. The country has a low birth rate. The immigrant population is increasing quickly. I noticed that it was still not a diverse population. As can be seen from the pictures, the buildings in town reflect a baroque style and reflect the Austro-Hungarian influence.\n\nMira had told us earlier that literacy is very high in Slovenia. Inflation rate only 2% today.\n\n(Interesting aside – Just as in Croatia, it appears that Slovenia only exports a small percentage of the wine they produce. Claims to be good wine!)\n\nAlthough most buildings we were walking past were occupied and being used by businesses, there were a few like this one awaiting renovation. (One of the buildings that you can see in the next picture in this blog is also in similar shape.) This building was apparently slated for non-tourism related commercial activity in the future.\n\nWe continued walking along a path on the side of Ljubljanica River and eventually crossed over to the old town on Cobbler’s Bridge.\n\nWe strolled along what appeared to be the main street of the old town. Old buildings, primarily in the baroque style – many with small store fronts, and with eateries (many with outdoor seating) – lined the streets of cobblestone. We got to sample some food in front of one of the stores. At least one of the dips that we were offered here had the flavor of truffles. I felt that it was an acquired taste.\n\nWe observed a trash pickup on the street. The setup for the trash bins was similar to what we had seen in Portugal during one of our earlier trips. The receptacle for the trash is actually underground, under the bin itself. A truck comes by to lift the whole structure, including the underground receptacle, off the ground to get at the trash and dispose it. These particular trash bins are apparently designed to also encourage recycling. You use a card to open up the trash bin and deposit stuff in it, and you pay based on weight of trash. The Slovenians appear to be very conscious of their environment.\n\nWe passed the city hall.\n\nWe were told the story of Jason and the Argonauts and how Jason killed the local dragon and helped create the city. It is, of course, mythology.\n\nThe Fountain of the three rivers, or Robba Fountain, is near the city hall. I could not help noticing that lots of people of all ages were making their way around Old Town on bicycles. The place is indeed quite “green”. You can also see that this part of town was a very busy space at this time of the year and at this time of the day. There were a lot of tourists.\n\nWe next passed the Roman Catholic cathedral. It is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Catholicism is the dominant religion in Slovenia. The artwork on the side door to the church (seen in the distance in the picture above) is relatively new and is a bronze sculpture of five bishops of Ljubljana from the 20th century. It was completed only in 1996.\n\nWe turned the corner around the building next to the church seen in the picture above and arrived at the central markets of Ljubljana. The place was bustling with activity.\n\nWe crossed over the Ljubljanica river on Butchers bridge after walking past the market. There is a statue of Satyr on the bridge. It apparently show him startled by a serpent. (I am not sure I get it!) The railings of the bridge are lined with Lover’s locks. In the distance in the picture below you can see the Open Market building from the bridge. We got a different view of the Open Market building from the Triple bridge after crossing Butchers bridge and making our way back to Prešeren Square.\n\nThe dragon is the symbol of Ljubljana. This manhole cover in the Old Town shows the dragon on top of the castle. There is an older bridge called Dragon Bridge across the Ljubljanica river that includes sculptures of dragons at the four corners. We did not quite get to the location of that bridge during our walks through town.\n\nWe had been told about the skyscraper of Ljubljana which is supposed to give you the best view of town. It used to be one of the taller buildings in the world during its heyday. I don’t think there was anybody in our group who ventured there. The picture in the Wikipedia article of Ljubljana from that vantage point actually looks good.\n\nAt this point we split off from the rest of the group to explore the town on our own. We first got lunch from the Open Kitchen stalls in an area of Old Town next to the central market. This is actually a regular outdoor event that happens in the open space of the Central Market, and it is called Odprta Kuhna in Slovenian. They even had a stall where they were making dosas!\n\nWe walked to the castle after lunch. Simona had told us where to go to find the path up the hill that would take us there. Our search led us to this path. Truth be told, some of the locals whom we asked for directions seemed to be somewhat clueless about the way up the hill, making me wonder if they have ever climbed up to the castle themselves.\n\nThere were some maps along the way as we went up the hill. I realized that there were many ways up the hill, some shorter than the one we were taking, and Simona had happened to point us to this particular one for some reason or the other.\n\nWe got some views of the town itself from the vantage point of the castle.\n\nOne of the pictures above is of Congress Square, a space that we had walked past earlier that morning.\n\nWe walked down from the castle on a trail next to to the funicular.\n\nWe continued our walk through the Old Town. We ended up on the Cankarjevo nabrežje (Cankarjevo Embankment), stopping at a place that had been pointed out to us as having the best gelato in Ljubljana. The place was for some reason labeled with the letter F. Some of us sat around in the ice-cream place after its consumption, while others went shopping. Mira had recommended buying salt with herbs mixed in from Slovania. We did return home with a couple of bottles from Ljubljana.\n\nWe returned to Prešeren Square and joined the rest of our group. We then walked back to where the bus was waiting for us to take us to Bled. The full set of pictures of our visit to Ljubljana are in the gallery here.\n\nAnd then we were on our way north (actually more like northwest), headed for Bled (pronounced “blate”) for the evening. This resort town is located at the foot of the Julian Alps and is about 30 miles away from Austria. We were going to be staying in a historic hotel with good views of Lake Bled. Our hotel had a swimming pool with water from the mineral water spring under it! Mira informed us that ours was one of the few remaining Gate1 tours with overnight stays in the town of Bled. It is not big enough to handle bigger loads of tourist traffic. It is apparently more common these days for the tours to stop overnight at Ljubljana and make a day trip to Bled.\n\nThere was a backup of traffic all the way from the exit of the highway for Bled into the town of Bled itself. This was a Friday, the beginning of the weekend. People were heading out to places where they could enjoy some weekend activity. There was also some road realignment work being done that contributed to the delay.\n\nWe got a nice view of the Bled castle as we were arriving at the lake shore. We first checked in at our hotel which was located along the lake shore. (Unfortunately, our rooms were located on the side of the hotel facing the road, and not the lake.) Due to the location, next to the road around the lake, our bus had to make a short stop to drop us off before departing to a parking area elsewhere.\n\nThe Grand Toplice hotel was an historic luxury hotel that has been renovated in recent times. The age of the hotel was apparent in the nature of the keys that were provided for our rooms. These were old-fashioned physical keys that needed to be turned, and they were attached to a big wooden block that made it inconvenient to carry around. We were told that we could deposit the keys with the front desk whenever we went out because of the inconvenience. We actually found the people at the front desk to be very friendly and helpful during our stay. Our own room key proved to be problematic in that the key chain itself kept separating from the wooden block, and this could not be fixed properly at the front desk. Teresa fashioned a more effective solution than they could using tape!\n\nWe had a little bit of time to explore Bled before dinner time. Since we were on the first floor, our views from the room, and even from the open space at the ends of the hotel were not good. We went down to the trail that ran all around the lake. The lake and its surroundings – with the castle on the hill, the church across the water, the unique color of the water, and the boatmen with their tourists on the water – was quite pretty. The light at that time of the evening was not ideal for taking a picture of Bled Castle itself. I was able to get better pictures the next morning.\n\nWe walked along the shore to the Central Park of Bled. People were hanging out by the water.\n\nLater that evening, the whole tour group walked from the hotel to the restaurant that we were dining at.\n\nSome of the food tasted a little strange. I believe there was too much truffle mixed with the potatoes. I cannot remember if we had the Carniolan sausage, a specialty of this area that we had been told about earlier in the day. It was nice spending some time with members of the tour group that we were meeting with for the first time. One of the ladies was an artist who did portraits!\n\nOne of the people in the group at our table made the mistake of ordering an extra dessert for our table after dinner, which ended up delaying the entire tour group on our return to the hotel. The others finally left before we did, and we had to walk back as a small group to the hotel by ourselves. It was a nice enough walk. The lights of the town along the shoreline of the lake were muted. This was one of the many pictures that I took of the castle when walking back to the hotel.\n\nWe were ready for bed when we got back. It had been a long day.\n\nThe next blog in this series here.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when looking out of our hotel’s front doors that morning were the trams that were running close to the hotel. Here are a couple of different models of trams that were passing by.\n\nValentina was going to be our local guide for the walking tour of Zagreb that day. We were going to start the tour right from the front of our hotel.\n\nThere was a slight chance of rain showers. Some of us were prepared accordingly, including Valentina. Unfortunately, the wireless audio system (called “Whisper” – could be a brand name!) that Valentina was going to use to communicate (via headphones) with her large group was having intermittent breakdowns. The speculation was that there was electrical interference from the overhead cables of the tram system. We managed somehow.\n\nWe heard that Zagreb has been the capital of Croatia since 1990. The first thought that came to me was that this was a very short time period. What could have been the capital of the country before this? Then one remembers that the country only came into being in the 1990s!\n\nIt was rush hour time in Zagreb. We had to cross the streets carefully as a group. Valentina told us that Croatians are a walking nation. She also cautioned us about staying off the busy bicycle lanes on the sidewalk. It was especially important for a big group like hours.\n\nWe arrived at a park with an art pavilion. This building was first built for an exhibition in Budapest. After the exhibition had ended, the building’s iron skeleton was transported to Zagreb and the building was reconstructed.\n\nJust beyond the park on which the building sits, behind it, is Zagreb’s main train station. We turned in the opposite direction to walk towards Zagreb’s main square. We passed Strossmayer Park first..\n\nThere was a major earthquake in the area around Zagreb four years ago. The city is still being rebuilt. We could see damaged buildings, and buildings with damaged facades, all around town.\n\nWe next entered the area of Zrinjevac park. (We were actually in a long stretch of three different parks, and this was the last of the parks that we would be passing!) There are sycamore trees in the park, some over 140 years old. There is a bandstand and a meteorological Post within the space of the park. There are occasional busts of people important to the locals.\n\nWe were told that the parks in Zagreb are clean. The process of keeping the place clean starts with the childhood education. The people of Zagreb also like their flowers. Also, summers are hot in Zagreb.\n\nThis area of the parks is surrounded by embassies and government buildings. This includes the Supreme Court.\n\nWe next left the area of the parks and turned on to the road that would take us towards the main square. We were at an intersection with a street called Nikola Tesla street. We were told that this street has the bars and restaurants of the city.\n\nWe passed the location of a synagogue that was destroyed by the Axis powers in 1941. The location is now a parking lot. We were told that 94% of the population is Roman Catholic.\n\nSwitzerland had just won the Eurovision music contest at the time of our visit. The artist who performed from Switzerland was somebody named Nemo, and the winning song was called The Code. (It is a pretty good song!) In second place at the contest was Croatia with a song from a singer named Baby Lasagna! There was apparently a signature move from a section of the song that his audience joined in. People were apparently doing the move all over town (but I did not see it myself!). One of the workers in a store that we were passing by got excited and asked our tour group if we would do the move for her. Most folks obliged. Here is the song performed at Eurovision.\n\nWe continued our walk. This was the first full view of the space of the Ban Jelačić Square that we were entering. The space was still relatively empty at that time of the morning. At that point we were entering the upper town from lower town. The Austro-Hungarian influence can be seen in the architecture around the square. There is one building that was out of place in the square that Valentia considered a monument to socialism. It was the only building in the square that does not fit the place. Today it is expensive office space.\n\nThe trams were not running at that time. There was some work going on on the overhead cables.\n\nIn the middle of the square is a statue of Ban Jelačić on a horse. Ban is the term used for a ruler of Croatia.\n\nThe Zagreb Cathedral is in a space close to the square. It was damaged by the earthquake of in 2020. We were not taken to that location. This is a picture of the spires of the church taken from a distance.\n\nWe walked across the square and to the Farmers market and approached the fruit, vegetables, and flower section.\n\nWe then moved on to a street with clothes stores, and from then onto a promenade known as Krvavi Most, or Bloody Bridge. There used to be a bridge over a creek here. The bridge gained its name because of the constant conflicts happening on it between the citizens of the towns of that time which are now a part of Zagreb. Today, it is a shopping area connecting two streets.\n\nMira (who was following the group trying to make sure nobody was left behind) asked me if Valentina had mentioned Number 13 – apparently the address of a brothel during days past. She had not, and I could not find out anything about this establishment on the Internet either. I did find out that the space that we were standing in was known for its many brothels in times past.\n\nAfter crossing the promenade, we walked up a very steep street to the location of the old city walls. The picture below shows the challenge we faced. This is the view looking down the street in the opposite direction.\n\nThere is a Statue of St. George and the dragon next to the city wall at the top of the street. (St. George is a popular patron saint in the area in general.) The comment was made that the slain dragon in this statue looks like a lizard!\n\nWe climbed some steps from the street we were on up to the wall and walked to a tower and a gate to the Upper Town. It happens to be the only one still preserved. The Gate is called the Stone Gate. There is a shrine inside the gate to Our Lady of the Stone Gate. The slabs to the left and right of the altar have words etched on them. Most of the writing includes the word Hvala, which means Thank You in English.\n\nEmerging from the gate one sees the oldest working pharmacy in Zagreb.\n\nThe next sight along the path of our walking tour was St. Marks Church. On the roof are the coat of arms of Zagreb, and that of The Triune kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. The checkerboard pattern of red and white on the roof can be seen on the uniforms of players in different sports representing Croatia.\n\nThe parliament building, and other government buildings, surrounded the big and empty square around the church. Barriers prevent entry by the common man to the square itself. We were there when a convoy of black cars pulled up to one of the buildings and some official looking people stepped out, surrounded by what looked like security people. (They were keeping an eye on what was going on around them.) The barriers came up during COVID. The politicians are apparently not inclined to give up their fence, but the local population is not happy about the situation. It is a fluid situation.\n\nWe were told about the coffee drinking habits of the Croatian people. They do not take it “to go” when they go to the cafes. They always sit in the cafes and socialize. Apparently, the appearance of paper cups for “take out” is a newer phenomenon in the country, accelerated by COVID. One can buy food from bakeries and other places close by to consume in the coffee shops – which typically only have coffee.\n\nOn the road leading away from St. Marks Church, we passed the Croatian Museum of Naïve Art, the Greek Catholic Church, and the Museum of Broken Relationships.\n\nWe heard about King Bela 4th of Hungary and Croatia. The upper part of Zagreb, called Gradec, was proclaimed a royal free city during his time (see Golden Bull of 1242). The people of this town had some additional freedoms because of this. The citizens of the city were expected to build fortifications for their town at their own expense in return. The walls of the upper city encompassed the space they occupied. This community used to be in conflict with the neighboring Kaptol community which was under the control of the church. These two communities used to tangle with each other, and the Bloody Bridge was the site of some of these fights. The two communities together eventually combined to form the city of Zabreb.\n\nWe passed a crowd of young kids getting an outdoor history lesson. It was fun to watch the lesson and see the way the kids responded to the teacher.\n\nWe walked to the Southern defensive tower, called Lotrščak Tower. The cannon in the upper window fires at noon every day. You can see the cannon better in this zoomed in picture. The cannon startles the tourists, but the locals are used to it. The tower is next to the funicular, which was not operational at that time.\n\nWe made our way down steps from the wall of the upper town to the main shopping street of Old Zagreb.\n\nThis was one of the steps we encountered on our way down. I saw a reference to it on the Internet that used the phrase “Okolo Around”. This is what Okolo Around is all about.\n\nWe arrived at the main road, and after a short distance took a side street that led towards Petar Preradović Square. On the way we passed the only Orthodox Church in Zagreb, the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord. There was the smell of incense within the church. The interior appeared to be under renovation. We were told that the Greek and Russian patriarchs are the most powerful of the leaders in the Orthodox church.\n\nWe next passed through Petar Preradović Square itself, passing the statue of Petar Preradović along the way. The other side of this square was busy with activity by this time in the morning. The square is also called Flower Square.\n\nWe passed through a building next to the square whose most significant feature was a open area in a wide passageway called the Octogon. It is considered a tourist attraction.\n\nComing out of the passageway, we were back on the main road leading up to Ban Jelačić Square.\n\nThis was the end of the walking tour from Gate1. We had time on our own after this to wander around, till about noon time. We had another optional tour scheduled for the afternoon.\n\nThe first thing we did was go back to the tunnel and the funicular that we had passed during the walking tour earlier in the morning.\n\nWe first walked through the Gric tunnel. Its entrance had been pointed out to us earlier on. The tunnel was built during World War II as a bomb shelter and a promenade. There was an exhibition going on at the time we were there.\n\nApparently, there are other tunnels like this in Croatia, and more old tunnels are still being discovered even today.\n\nUsing Google maps as our guide, we found our way to the street with the funicular at the end of it. The funicular was not operational at the time. You can see that some work is going on on the rails. I walked up to the funicular and got a picture that includes the funicular and the Lotrščak Tower towering above it.\n\nWe retreated back to the main square to have our lunch and to get ready to walk back to the hotel to catch the bus for our outing that afternoon. I was happy to see the the trams had started running by this time. Mira had gotten tickets for us to be able to take the tram back to the hotel if we wanted, but that plan apparently was no longer in play.\n\nWe got sandwiches from a bakery next to square (annoying the lady behind the counter with our questions and indecisiveness in the process I think!), and then walked over to the Kraš ice cream place (that had been pointed out to us earlier in the day) in order to consume the food. We had been told that Kraš sells some of the best chocolate in Croatia. Some of us had their chocolate ice cream. Others just had coffee with their lunch. The ice cream was very good indeed.\n\nWe had had a wonderful morning walking the streets of Zagreb. The city square had been a charming place to be in. I enjoyed watching the city in action. I enjoyed watching the constant movement of many generations of blue city trams through the square.\n\nWe walked back to the hotel shortly after.\n\nWe had a little time to go to our rooms before departing for our afternoon tour of the countryside.\n\nYou can find all my pictures from the visit to Zagreb that morning here.\n\nIt was raining as we departed the hotel on our afternoon trip, but, thankfully, the skies cleared up quickly.\n\nWe left Zabreb county and headed north to enter the county of Krapina-Zagorje.\n\nKrapina is the town in which they have a museum containing remains from a Neanderthal settlement that were found in this area. Ages of the individuals whose remains were found ranges between 2 and 38. They were taller people than homo sapiens of today, but had less brain development. They have found traces of cannibalistic behavior amongst the population.\n\nOur bus route ran close to the Sutla River that forms the border between Croatia and Slovania in this region. The Sutla is a tributary of the Sava river.\n\nOur first destination for the afternoon was the town of Kumrovec. We saw signs of interest in development of tourism in the area.\n\nWe were going to the ethnographic village museum in Kumrovec. This space includes many houses of permanent ethnographic displays, focusing on the crafts and customs of Croatia. One of the houses in Kumrovec happens to be the one where Josip Broz Tito was born and brought up.\n\nA young man whose name was Carlo (seen with the microphone in this picture) was our guide at Kumrovic. We started the tour at the far end of the old village and made our way slowly towards the entrance.\n\nThe first place we passed was a massive house with a barn underneath. Two families shared the space. The families apparently made crafts at home. The first house we actually entered had displays of pottery. The theme for the second house we entered was toys. Then there was the home for the newlyweds. After that, there was the house with Gingerbread hearts display.\n\n(A fuller set of pictures from this visit can be seen here.)\n\nSome houses had gardens. There is a stream that flows through the village, and there are locations along the stream where the villagers can go down from the embankment to the stream to access the water. Corn cobs were used for decoration outside some homes, and was also used for keeping the birds away from the inside.\n\nWe passed a building with a traditional thatched straw roof, an opportunity to talk about the nature of roofs in that part of Croatia. Thatched roofs made the homes difficult to keep dry.. Grey tiled roofs were good but heavy. The locals finally moved to clay roofs.\n\nThe next display was about blacksmiths. They were some of the wealthier people in the village. Tito’s family were blacksmiths.\n\nThere was the house with Zagorje-style wedding display. Then a big two story house (I forgot the theme for this house, but here is a picture of a room in it) with a corn crib next to the house. The next stop in the village was the Firehouse display.\n\nThe final stop was Tito’s home. It included a barn. The barn was built by his grandfather. Tito’s father and grandfather lived in separate parts of the house next to each other. We entered the black room, which was the kitchen in the center area between the two parts of the house. Tito was proud of his home. Later on, he converted his grandfather’s room into a display room for people he invited to visit. These people included dignitaries and leaders from other countries. The statue next to the barn is from 1948.\n\nPeople who had originally lived in the homes in the area of this museum were given alternate homes to move to after their homes were taken over for the museum. Houses could even be in other places. Some folks still remain in the space surrounding the museum.\n\nWe left the museum soon after to drive to our next destination.\n\nWe heard that this area was at the crossroads for trade and engagements between different peoples. We were in an area of castles inhabited by the people who controlled the local spaces. We were going to go to dinner at a restaurant with a good view of one of these castles. Its name is Veliki Tabor. This one dates back to the middle of the 15th century. It is a gothic style castle which was fortified in the 16th century, when more towers and walls were added. In 1793 the castle changed ownership and went into disrepair. It was used for other purposes since then, including as a school, an orphanage etc.. The castle is used for re-enactments these days.\n\nThis castle is the setting for the love story of Frederick and Veronica, a story that is worth repeating here. In the Middle Ages, Veliki Tabor belonged to Count Hermann II of Celje. His son Fridrik fell in love with Veronika, a girl from a poor family. Hermann refused to accept a minor noblewoman as his daughter-in-law. He accused her of witchcraft in court but lost his case. Hermann had her imprisoned and then drowned anyway. Frederick’s rebellion against Hermann ended with Frederick’s imprisonment.\n\nThe restaurant was on top of a hill and provided a good line of sight to the castle which was also on a hilltop.\n\nWe had to walk up from the bottom of the hill to the top to get to the restaurant. People who had trouble walking uphill were taken up by car. There were little wayside displays along the way with the primary themes being the castle and the love story of Frederick and Veronika.\n\nWe all got a welcome drink of honey liqueur before we entered the restaurant. I went looking for seconds but it was all gone.\n\nThe restaurant was run by a family and was quite homey on the inside – in fact it might have been a converted home! We sat with a couple of ladies (they were friends who were traveling together) at the dinner table in a far corner of one of the rooms. After a salad, we were served a dinner of Mlinci pasta with chicken, pork chops and beans. This is the plate from which we shared. The young lady who was serving us gave us the recipe for the pasta, and one of the ladies at our table decided she was going to make it when she got back to the US. The pictures I found on the Internet make it look like a chapati prior to its being served as a base for the meat that is placed over it. The pasta actually cannot be well seen in the picture I took.\n\nBlueberry liqueur with a strudel dessert followed our dinner.\n\nWe had to walk back down the hill after dinner to get back to our bus. The sun had already set by the time we got back to Zagreb.\n\nThe next blog in this series here.\n\nWe left our hotel in Belgrade at 8:00 that morning to head out to Zagreb.\n\nZagreb is the capital of Croatia. It is a center for government and industry. Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet here, making the area the center of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia, and a hub for transportation in the country.\n\nThis was going to be one of the long drives of the tour. The only real stop for tourism along the way was at a winery.\n\nIt did not take long to leave the city. We were heading towards western Serbia. It was a work day in the city.\n\nSoon we were driving past fields and plains. We drove past an old Roman settlement. The current town of Sremska Mitrovica used to be one of the capitals in the Roman Empire. It used to be called Sirmium. (The empire of Rome was split by Emperor Diocletian at one point into four jurisdictions managed by four tetrarchs.) The town used to be a stop on the tour in the past, but no longer is. Perhaps it takes up too much time to properly explore the space.\n\nConstantine was born in Serbia. Serbia gave the world 18 Roman emperors.\n\nWe took a break at a rest stop just before we got out of Serbia.\n\nAs we approached the border, we started passing a long line of trucks next to the road. They were basically parked on one of the two lanes. The line stretched a few miles long. It takes a lot of time for the trucks to cross the border because Serbia is not part of Schengen nations. Each of the trucks needs to be checked. These trucks are apparently transporting goods from Serbia and Turkey. We were told that it could sometimes take days for them to cross. This is a major bother, and a bigger concern if the trucks carry perishable items that needs to be kept refrigerated.\n\nThis was going to be our first border crossing in a Gate1 tour, and it happened to be on a bus! Apparently, procedures for the passengers at this border can be fluid and unpredictable. One could not predict exactly how the bus and its passengers would be checked, and how long the process would take. This time a young Serbian Immigration officer came on board the bus to collect our passports. (Apparently, the tour managers were sometimes told to collect the passports.) He returned quickly with the stamped passports.\n\nThere was a separate stop the for Customs check. We did not have to get out of the bus, and the stop here was quick.\n\nThe next stop was Croatian Immigration. We stepped out of the bus and into a building to get our passports stamped. It was also a quick process.\n\nThere was a line of trucks on the other side of the border waiting to cross into Serbia. The line was shorter than the one waiting to leave Serbia.\n\n(Recap of history of this region: We were told that the place was inhabited first in 1100 BC by the Illyrians. (But they have also found some Neanderthal skeletal remains in a place called Krapina.) Around 230 BC, Princess Teuta apparently invited Romans to keep the Greeks away. They stayed for 800 years! This included the time of the Byzantine empire. Then came the Slavs and the Ottomans. Croatia separated from Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It joined the EU in 2013, and the Schengen and Eurozone in 2023.)\n\nThe regions of Croatia include Istria in the north (influenced by Italy and Austria), Zagreb (or Central Croatia), Dalmatia (Roman influenced) and Slavonia (Austro-Hungarian influence). We had entered Croatia in the region of Slavonia.\n\nThe highway to Zagreb runs near the Bosnian border in this region. This is a picture of the countryside we were passing.\n\nWe got off the highway and continued our drive to the winery on country roads.\n\nSlavonia is an agricultural area, and is the breadbasket of Croatia. There is no heavy industry. There is no pollution. The region produces a lot of fruits and dairy products. Honey is produced. They have free range chicken. Houses will advertise that they are selling jaja – eggs! A very high proportion of the families own tractors. This is also the region of wineries. Rakia and wine are also produced in the homes. Lipizzaner horses are bred in Slavonia. They follow the patriarchal model of life and have joint families.\n\nWe heard about the music of Slavonia, and also heard some of it, on the bus. Bećarac music is listed as an UNESCO-intangible cultural heritage. It is humorous music and mainly sung by men. It is influenced by Hungarian music. The tamburica is a regional musical instrument. Songs of romance are popular. Mira recommended our coming back for a well known regional music festival.\n\nAs we were passing some woods, we were told that Slavonian oak was used for making barrels for the wineries since they are less expensive. They apparently also have a good reputation.\n\nThe winery we stopped at was in Kutjevo village. It is called the Krauthaker Winery. It is one of the biggest private wineries in Croatia. Our guide for the tour of the winery was a gentleman named Drajen (not completely sure that I spelt that correctly). He is the sommelier. He gets to sample all the wines regularly, and also with the visitors. What a job!\n\nThe winery overlooks the Golden Valley.\n\nThe winery was established in 1992. It is a young winery. They produce 700,000 liters of wine annually today. They have three different locations, 35 labels, and use 44 different varieties of grapes.\n\nWe got to sample multiple wines while Drajen spoke to us about the nature of these wines. We were given some platters of bite size food to go with our wine. (It has been emphasized to me that it is not good to drink on an empty stomach.☺️).\n\nThe food was made by Drajen and he was proud of it. Pumpkin seed oil was used in the hummus. Apparently this is significant because pumpkin oil is very difficult to extract. The bread was made in clay oven.\n\nAs a part of the wine tasting process, we were given instructions to not try to finish the wines we did not like. There were metal containers that were placed on the table to allow us to empty any leftover wine into, so that the next sample could be poured into the glass. I only know that I did not throw out any wine!\n\nWe had the following wines: Julija sparkling wine, Grasevina Italian Reisling, Pinot sivi, Sauvignon Vidim, Chardonnay Rosenberg, Blauburger (our first red wine – with 14% alcohol), Mercs (a red blend of Merlot of Cabernet) and Mustra (a sweet wine). They all had distinctive tastes.\n\nAbout the wine making process – Vineyards are typically on the hillsides. 10% of Croatian wines are produced in the area around Kutjevo. The primary market for the wines is Croatia. If production suffers, exports are reduced.\n\nDifferent grapes are harvested at different times during the season. They take 45 days to harvest all their grapes. The grapes are picked by hand. 12% of the grapes today are red grapes. Red wine is stored in wooden barrels and the white wines mainly in metal barrels. Red wine includes skin in the fermentation process. Drajen told us about the processes for creating sweet wines, and wines of different alcohol levels.\n\nHe noted that Shiraz is one of the oldest varieties of wine. It is good for mixed wines for adding color. Another fact noted was that one has to be careful when making fruit wines. Methanol, or methyl alcohol, a poison, can be generated in varying concentrations as a part of the process.\n\nThere was a rush for the rest room after this activity, after which we got to visit the storage area for the wines, the place in which they were aged in barrels, and also do some shopping if we were so inclined.\n\nTeresa offered folks some of the snacks that we had taken with us. I noticed Drajen partaking from the bag more than once. I thought that he definitely could have used the food in his stomach after all his “sampling”. It seemed to me that he was getting more and more animated, and perhaps a little red faced, as he was going through his long presentation earlier, although he never lost his place, and even manned the wine store afterwards! I wondered how he kept up with the pace of his job, especially the sampling of the wines. The word on the bus from Mira was that he does have regular medical checkups, and all is well!\n\nThe rest of the drive to Zagreb was uneventful, except for the need for a pit stop because of all the wine that had been consumed. This time, I was the one who had to declare the emergency. I tried to do it quietly, but my effort was partially thwarted by Mira – she was not looking at her messages on her mobile phone. I had to stagger up to the front of the fast moving bus to pass on my message.\n\nIt was interesting to see a Croatian Railroad train during this part of the ride. The trainset is the HŽ 7023. They came into service during the last decade.\n\nWe arrived in Zagreb soon after. What was noticeable to me were the tram lines running on all the major roads. All of the trams were a shade of blue that caught your attention, and these trams were running quite frequently. There were also trams from so many different generations sharing the lines. I think I would have appreciated seeing something like this even more when I was a kid, but the curiosity still exists! I could not get a good picture that evening because I was on the wrong side of the bus!\n\nRush hour traffic was quite heavy in the city. We arrived at the Zagreb Sheraton soon after. It turned out to be an older facility that had undergone renovation to get in newer features..\n\nDinner was in the hotel itself. We got a chance to meet up with the rest of our group. We retired to our rooms soon after dinner.\n\n*****************\n\nWe had received a lot more information as we were leaving Belgrade and Serbia that morning. These are from my notes:\n\nSerbia has negative birth rate. Steps have been taken to encourage larger families. Woman get one year of maternity leave, mostly paid for by the government. There are also many cheap government kindergartens.\n\nChildren in Serbia learn Cyrillic first and then English.\n\nThe government spends money on infrastructure, including hospitals. There is corruption in the medical field even though medical services are supposed to be free. Doctors expect more money to provide a better quality of care. Nurses are not paid well – even waitresses get a better income.\n\nThere are new occupational opportunities in Serbia. Call centers are being set up in the country. Digital nomads also come to Serbia to work.\n\nMira recommended a couple of Serbian movies – Underground and Black cats and white cats. The movies are by Emir Kusturica, a reknown Serbian Director. His movies appear to focus on life of the common man in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSerbian people are said to be good neighbors and socialize with each other. It is different in countries like Croatia and Slovenia. Serbians are curious about each other – they want to know how much you earn. They are gossipy people in general!\n\nWeddings in Serbia: Weddings are big, especially in the countryside. The whole community is invited. A member of the family goes round with a wooden flask of Rakia to share with people. Before 1846, you could buy the bride. Now there are just ceremonial gestures in this regard. You apparently also had to fill the woman’s shoe with money until the shoe fits before your proposal was accepted. There is also the shooting of an apple involved before the wedding! Weddings happen in the church. Everything is done three times including exchange of rings. First steps of the young couple includes walking under the table. (I have not seen any online confirmation on this one!) The best man throws coins into the crowd at the end of a wedding! Live musicians are important at weddings. The music is lively. Watch this dance video from a wedding in Serbia. I believe the dance is called the Kolo. People used to give gifts like cattle, barbecue, etc. Today they give money.\n\nDivorce rates in Serbia are high. Drazn said it is 33%.\n\nSerb and Croatian foods: There are different spices and flavors in the different regions. Serbs (and eastern Balkans) use a lot more onions and garlic than Croatians. There is more of the influence of spices from the Ottomans in Serbia. Serbs use sunflower oil. Croats use olive oil (more Mediterranean influenced). Foods from both regions are considered light. Carp is popular in Serbia. Squid is popular in Dalmatia in Croatia. Black risotto is from Croatia. Strukli is the local pastry from Zagreb. Apple strudels and dumplings are popular in Slovenia. In East Serbia they eat more roasted meat. Croatia has more fish and cheese .\n\nMira expressed the opinion that it is not likely that Serbia will convert to the Eurozone any time soon. Also, that there is still general propaganda from Russia these days that western values and ways are bad. Older people tend to believe this propaganda. Mira claims that Serbia is and was better off than other Eastern European countries – foreign goods, music, etc., were always available in Yugoslavia but not in some other Balkan countries.\n\nThe next blog in this series here.\n\nWe had booked our airline tickets for this trip independent of Gate1 since the company’s pricing of tickets from the Washington, DC, area was higher than the pricing I found on my own. We ended up getting our tickets through Austrian Airways. This would be the first time we would be flying this airline. The tickets were expensive, the Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Washington, DC, return flights costing quite a bit.\n\nOur travel into Belgrade was uneventful. We shared an Uber ride with our friends from their house to Dulles airport, the ride being notable because we rode in a huge black SUV that looked as if it was suitable for use by the Secret service. Our nattily dressed driver kept a clean and neat vehicle inside and outside, and offered us some Werthers candy for the ride, with the admonition that we should not leave the candy wrappers in the car.\n\nAustrian Airlines had an early evening departure to Vienna, and we would also be getting to our destination of Belgrade early the next day. After checking in, we walked to our departure gate with plenty of time to spare.\n\nDaylight soon turned into nighttime because of the eastward direction of our flight and the crossing of time zones. I did manage to get pictures of the Aurora Borealis out of the window of the aircraft with the smartphone. The pictures were not very good and I do not consider them suitable for posting. Also of note is the fact that the smartphone worked better than the regular camera when trying to take these pictures.\n\nIt"
