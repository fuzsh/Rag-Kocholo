        "text": "The first Croatian wine label that I saw might as well have been on a bottle of vodka. I couldn't even distinguish the name of the winery from the name of the grape varieties on the wine label. Fortunately, Sasha Lusic, owner of D'Vino wine bar in Dubrovnik and one of the funniest guys I met on my five-week press trip, took a minute to show me how to read a Croatian wine label.\n\nEvery Croatian wine label will display the wine's quality level. This is similar to Italy's IGT, DOC, and DOCG quality rankings. Croatia's wine quality rankings are:\n\nVrhunsko - \"top quality wine\"\n\nKvalitetno - \"quality wine\"\n\nStolno - \"table wine\"\n\nThese rankings are generally helpful, but some great wines are labeled stolno, or table wine. \"You have Frano Miloš,\" explained Sasha, \"who's 2004 Stagnum won a Bronze at the Decanter World Wine Awards. The government only labeled his wine stolne, but he's winning awards with that particular wine.\"\n\nThe next thing to look for is the grape name, which is almost always proudly displayed in large letters on the label. Croatia's popular grapes include:\n\nCroatian White Grapes:\n\nDebit\n\nGrasevina\n\nMalvazija\n\nMarastinat\n\nMuškat\n\nPinot Sivi (Pinot Gris)\n\nPinot Bijelo (Pinot Blanc)\n\nPosip\n\nCroatian Red Grapes:\n\nBabic\n\nCabernet Sauvignon\n\nPinot Crni (Pinot Noir)\n\nPlavac Mali (relative of Zinfandel)\n\nRefosk\n\nTeran\n\nHowever, not every label features a grape name, especially in the case of blended wines, and sometimes the growing region is so famous that it takes the place of the grape name. Of course, many labels list both the grape name and the growing region. The wine label to the right features a wine from the famous Dingac region, where some of Croatia's best red wines are made with the Plavac Mali grape.\n\nCroatia has a large number of wine producing regions, and the one's I came across the most during my trip were:\n\nDingac\n\nPostup\n\nthe island of Korcula\n\nSlavonia\n\nIstria\n\nthe island Krk\n\nKutjevo\n\nInterestingly, many wine labels do not prominently display the name of the winery. The above wine is made by Milicic winery, and the name is half obscured by the growing region. This isn't the case withe label below:\n\nThis label below features a wine produced by one of the few cooperatives that still operate in Croatia. For this reason, the winery is simply represented by the name of the town in which the cooperative operates: Cara.\n\nThe word \"vinogorje\" means vineyard grape-growing region, and this label shows that the Posip grapes were grown on the island of Korcula.\n\nThese are the most important aspects of a Croatian wine label. To recap, look for quality of the wine, the grape, and the growing region, and whatever word is left on the label is most likely the name of the winery. If you get this down, the label below should pose no problems:"
