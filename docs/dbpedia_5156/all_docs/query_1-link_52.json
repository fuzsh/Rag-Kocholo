        "text": "The oldest wine cellars in Croatia came into existence in 1232, when the Cistercian monks arrived in Kutjevo. The very same order of monks had started the wine culture in Burgundy – famously recognizing and establishing numerous Grand Cru locations in one of France’s wine heartlands – and in the Mosel Valley, before hand-selecting Kutjevo as an ideal location for the planting of vines.\n\nThe abbey and cellars were established, wine-making traditions and techniques were institutionalized, and the rest is history.\n\nLocated in the vast expanse of the low-lying Pannonian Basin, the Kutjevo wine region has a unique microclimate. The vineyards of Kutjevo winery are rising 300 – 400 meters above sea level, with south-facing, sun-drenched, mineral-rich slopes which benefit from daily breezes to keep the disease in control. The result: perfect conditions for growing Croatia’s most widely planted varietal, Graševina.\n\nSteeped in history, Kutjevo winery recognizes the importance of evolution and has recently brought in a new generation of winemakers who are both embracing tradition whilst also looking to innovate and create a new and exciting chapter.\n\nThe jewel in their crown is their work with Graševina. Other varieties are:\n\nChardonnay,\n\nPinot Gris,\n\nTraminer,\n\nPinot Noir,\n\nMerlot,\n\nCabernet Sauvignon,\n\nCabernet Franc,\n\nSyrah,\n\nZweigelt.\n\nVisitors can experience a wine tasting in the old wine cellar, tour the rest of the cellar complex, and archive cellar where more than 50.000 aged bottles of wine rest, or have a tour through vineyards in a horse carriage."
