Its coastal wine regions and islands have harbored vineyards since the Illyrians first planted vines there during the Bronze Age, and a long, rich viticultural history led to the birth of hundreds of native varieties.",

        "text": "Following the devastation of phylloxera, which reached Croatia’s vineyards in the early 20th century, only 130 indigenous varieties remain, most planted in pocket-sized parcels in small family vineyards. Approximately 40 of these native varieties are used in commercial production alongside a dozen international varieties spread across Croatia’s 20,700 hectares of vineyards.\n\nMuch of Croatia’s wine production of 69 million liters stays within the domestic market—Croatia consumes an impressive 46.9 liters per capita annually, according to a 2014 report by the Wine Institute. However, since Croatian independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, and the country’s entrance into the EU in 2013, the wine industry has become more organized and exports are multiplying.\n\nBesides being the most planted grape variety in Croatia, Graševina is the most sought-after white wine. The Slavonia region is almost a synonym for this variety, where Graševina shows the best results.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of ferti-activator Sanbio PLANTA on the sugar content of vine variety ´Graševina´.\n\nThis study was executed in cooperation with the famous winery KUTJEVO d.d., located in the Slavonia region, northeast of Croatia and SANBOS GmbH, Germany.\n\n1. Background\n\nKutjevo is known for its wines, and the local agricultural joint stock company Kutjevo d.d. is the largest exporter of wines in Croatia.\n\nSituated on the southern slopes of the Krndija Mountains at 200-300 meters elevation, with only 500-800 mm of rainfall, and at 45.3 degrees North, Kutjevo vineyards are on the same parallel as Piedmont, Bordeaux, Côte du Rhone and Oregon.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\nTable 1. Basic data\n\nSeason 2014 Location Croatia, Slavonia region, Vinkomir, Kutjevo\n\nPicture 1.
