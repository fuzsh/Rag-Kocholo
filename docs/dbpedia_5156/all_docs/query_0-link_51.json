This grape is known by many other names, such as Welschriesling, Ryzlink and Olasz Rizling. Grasevina is a grape indigenous to Croatia. Grapes are grown between 200 and 450 metres above sea level.\n\nGrasevina food pairings: grilled fish, grilled pork chops, charcuterie and hard cheeses.\n\nScrumptious Seafood Wine\n\nThis Kutjevo Grasevina 2020 was reviewed on February 19, 2022 by Natalie MacLean\n\nNatalie MacLean is a new force in the wine writing world &dash; a feisty North American answer to Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson. She can write beautifully about wine.\n\nThe Financial Times of London\n\nThere are very few people in the wine world who \"get it\" and Natalie is one of those who brings more fun to a buttoned-up and stodgy game.\n\nGary Vaynerchuck, Wine Library TV"
