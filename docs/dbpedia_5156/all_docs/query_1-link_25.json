        "text": "Maximo Oro 2016 wins a major prize in its first appearance at the Decanter World Wine Awards.\n\nShortly after winning three bronze medals and recommendations at the International Wine Challenge, the Kutjevo winery has won new accolades. At the world’s largest wine competition Decanter World Wine Awards in London, which brought together 270 international experts to rate wines from 61 countries, the Kutjevo winery has won two silver and two bronze medals, reports Večernji List on June 9, 2018.\n\nSilver medals were won by Graševina de Gotho 2017 and Vrhunska Graševina 2017, while the bronze medals went to Graševina de Gotho 2016 and the new wine from the premium line, Maximo Oro 2016. It was created in response to market demands for new wines which will be primarily intended for restaurants for ideal pairing with top quality dishes.\n\nThe wine is a blend of Graševina, the most widely cultivated white wine grape variety in Croatia and Chardonnay, one of the most famous wine varieties in the world. Grapes for the production of this exclusive wine originate from the location of Vetovo, which is one of the best grape locations in the Kutjevo vine region.\n\nThe cuvee is characterized by a yellow colour with greenish glare, rounded aromas and discrete minerality specific to the Kutjevo terroir. Primary floral notes can be scented, while the fullness of taste reveals delicate fruitiness of apples and pears, with a harmonious and pleasant body with refreshing acids. The wine will be produced in limited quantities and will be available exclusively over the HoReCa marketing channel.\n\nThe Kutjevo wines, kept at an old Cistercian cellar built in 1232, are one of the symbols of the Croatian wine industry. The Kutjevo cellars are some of the oldest cellars in Southeast Europe and have kept one particular secret for more than three centuries. According to the rumours, Empress Maria Theresa and Baron Trenk spent there a full week, which is proven by marks left on the cellar walls.\n\nThis legend has inspired the creation of the Maximo premium wine series. The design of wine labels from the Maximo series connects this old legend with the latest trends in viticulture and winemaking.\n\nMaximo Bianco, Maximo Nero and sparkling wine Maximo Brut have been winning prestigious awards at world competitions for years, and the new Maximo Oro wine has now joined them.\n\nTranslated from Večernji List.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
