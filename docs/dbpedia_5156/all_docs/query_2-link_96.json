        "text": "Požega – Slavonia County Download as PDF Add to basket\n\nThe Požega-Slavonia County, green and golden “Vallis Aurea” was mentioned for the first time in 1210 as the Požega County with its seat in the Požega fortress (today the Old Town in the centre of Požega). With an area of 1,823 square kilometres, about 64,420 inhabitants (1.66% of the total population of Croatia), and an average population density of 35.34 inhabitants/km2, Požega-Slavonia County is one of the smallest counties in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nPožega-Slavonia County consist of 5 cities (Lipik, Kutjevo, Pakrac, Pleternica, Požega) and has the same number of municipalities (Brestovac, Čaglin, Jakšić, Kaptol, Velika). When we think about Slavonia, continental region in Croatia, the first idea of it is long and flat space. However, Požega-Slavonia County is surrounded with hills and mountains, which the higher parts are mostly covered with forests with the moderate continental climate. On the southern slopes of the mountains and hills are placed world-known vineyards, and the valley is covered with fertile fields. It is important to mention the northern hill Papuk that make different climate on southern slopes and protects the valley from strong northern winds, and the southern slopes have a milder climate than the valley. The county abounds in rich flora and fauna (45% is covered by forests), many thermal springs and river courses, and a rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe economic environment of Požega-Slavonia County is based on agriculture and processing industry. The most represented branches of the processing industry are metal processing, wood processing and food industry, while a smaller part are the textile industry and the production and processing of non-metallic mineral products and electrical equipment. The economy of the Požega-Slavonia County is traditionally export-oriented to approximately 30 European and global markets. The tradition of entrepreneurship and craftsmanship as well as the metal processing, textile, wood and food industries give a great opportunity for the further development of the Požega-Slavonia County. The county is also known as an agricultural area, especially for wine production. Furthermore, the wealth of natural resources and raw materials and the long-standing tradition of agricultural production at more than 5,000 family farms and trading companies are also great investment potentials of the Požega-Slavonia County.\n\nIn the Požega-Slavonia County, there is a tradition and additional potential for the improvement of freshwater fishing and horse breeding in the western parts of the County. In addition, the preserved environment and natural resources are a potential and motivation for honey production. Rich cultural and historical heritage and preserved nature are potentials for the development of continental tourism, especially by strengthening cultural tourism and cultural and creative industries. These resources are also the potential for more intensive development of other selective forms of tourism, such as hunting, rural, sports tourism, etc. It is important to mention few more examples that have the potential to strengthen the tourist offer and those are numerous villas, manors, castles, Lipik Spa and the State Stud Farm Đakovo – Lipik as many others. In addition, the wealth of mineral raw materials (stone, quartz sand) is certainly a potential for economic development.\n\n[Source: Regional Development Coordinator of Pozega-Slavonia County, July 2022]\n\nMain Indicators\n\nGDP EUR 556.301.000 Population 64.084 Men 31.200 Women 32.884 Age 0-14 9.152 Age 15+ 54.932 GDP Per Capita EUR 8.672,00 Area Size km² 1.823\n\nGross Value Added by ActivitiesEUR\n\nInfrastructure\n\nMotorways km 0 Broadband Connections number and density 13.594 / 57% Number of issued building permits 122\n\nInvestments\n\nAmount Foreign Direct Investments million EUR 64\n\nForeign Direct Investment by Activitymil.
