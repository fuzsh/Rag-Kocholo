        "text": "Diana Becevello WSET 2, WSET 3 in p rated this wine as 92/100 with the following review:\n\nOne of my favourite Croatian white wines. It is my go-to white wine and I always have a bottle in the fridge.\n\nGraševina is a widely planted grape in Croatia and is best produced in the region of Slavonia. This wine takes me back to my summer vacation in Croatia.\n\nThis dry wine has a medium body and a golden colour with flavours of apple, lemon, ripe peach, and honeydew melon with balanced acidity and a slight minerality, and a long finish.\n\nBest served at 8-10° C. It is a beautiful wine on its own or paired with seafood or a cheeseboard.L.J. Palmer WSET 3 rated this wine as 90/100 with the following review:\n\nFragrant deep lemon coloured dry wine with a pronounced aroma of juicy fruit; apple, ripe pear and lemon with a hint of butterscotch and melon. Zesty and medium bodied, this wine tastes of juicy pear, lemon zest, apple, butterscotch, melon and a briny tang. Paired well with charcuterie and cheese and is very pleasant drunk on its own."
