        "text": "The first thing I noticed when looking out of our hotel’s front doors that morning were the trams that were running close to the hotel. Here are a couple of different models of trams that were passing by.\n\nValentina was going to be our local guide for the walking tour of Zagreb that day. We were going to start the tour right from the front of our hotel.\n\nThere was a slight chance of rain showers. Some of us were prepared accordingly, including Valentina. Unfortunately, the wireless audio system (called “Whisper” – could be a brand name!) that Valentina was going to use to communicate (via headphones) with her large group was having intermittent breakdowns. The speculation was that there was electrical interference from the overhead cables of the tram system. We managed somehow.\n\nWe heard that Zagreb has been the capital of Croatia since 1990. The first thought that came to me was that this was a very short time period. What could have been the capital of the country before this? Then one remembers that the country only came into being in the 1990s!\n\nIt was rush hour time in Zagreb. We had to cross the streets carefully as a group. Valentina told us that Croatians are a walking nation. She also cautioned us about staying off the busy bicycle lanes on the sidewalk. It was especially important for a big group like hours.\n\nWe arrived at a park with an art pavilion. This building was first built for an exhibition in Budapest. After the exhibition had ended, the building’s iron skeleton was transported to Zagreb and the building was reconstructed.\n\nJust beyond the park on which the building sits, behind it, is Zagreb’s main train station. We turned in the opposite direction to walk towards Zagreb’s main square. We passed Strossmayer Park first..\n\nThere was a major earthquake in the area around Zagreb four years ago. The city is still being rebuilt. We could see damaged buildings, and buildings with damaged facades, all around town.\n\nWe next entered the area of Zrinjevac park. (We were actually in a long stretch of three different parks, and this was the last of the parks that we would be passing!) There are sycamore trees in the park, some over 140 years old. There is a bandstand and a meteorological Post within the space of the park. There are occasional busts of people important to the locals.\n\nWe were told that the parks in Zagreb are clean. The process of keeping the place clean starts with the childhood education. The people of Zagreb also like their flowers. Also, summers are hot in Zagreb.\n\nThis area of the parks is surrounded by embassies and government buildings. This includes the Supreme Court.\n\nWe next left the area of the parks and turned on to the road that would take us towards the main square. We were at an intersection with a street called Nikola Tesla street. We were told that this street has the bars and restaurants of the city.\n\nWe passed the location of a synagogue that was destroyed by the Axis powers in 1941. The location is now a parking lot. We were told that 94% of the population is Roman Catholic.\n\nSwitzerland had just won the Eurovision music contest at the time of our visit. The artist who performed from Switzerland was somebody named Nemo, and the winning song was called The Code. (It is a pretty good song!) In second place at the contest was Croatia with a song from a singer named Baby Lasagna! There was apparently a signature move from a section of the song that his audience joined in. People were apparently doing the move all over town (but I did not see it myself!). One of the workers in a store that we were passing by got excited and asked our tour group if we would do the move for her. Most folks obliged. Here is the song performed at Eurovision.\n\nWe continued our walk. This was the first full view of the space of the Ban Jelačić Square that we were entering. The space was still relatively empty at that time of the morning. At that point we were entering the upper town from lower town. The Austro-Hungarian influence can be seen in the architecture around the square. There is one building that was out of place in the square that Valentia considered a monument to socialism. It was the only building in the square that does not fit the place. Today it is expensive office space.\n\nThe trams were not running at that time. There was some work going on on the overhead cables.\n\nIn the middle of the square is a statue of Ban Jelačić on a horse. Ban is the term used for a ruler of Croatia.\n\nThe Zagreb Cathedral is in a space close to the square. It was damaged by the earthquake of in 2020. We were not taken to that location. This is a picture of the spires of the church taken from a distance.\n\nWe walked across the square and to the Farmers market and approached the fruit, vegetables, and flower section.\n\nWe then moved on to a street with clothes stores, and from then onto a promenade known as Krvavi Most, or Bloody Bridge. There used to be a bridge over a creek here. The bridge gained its name because of the constant conflicts happening on it between the citizens of the towns of that time which are now a part of Zagreb. Today, it is a shopping area connecting two streets.\n\nMira (who was following the group trying to make sure nobody was left behind) asked me if Valentina had mentioned Number 13 – apparently the address of a brothel during days past. She had not, and I could not find out anything about this establishment on the Internet either. I did find out that the space that we were standing in was known for its many brothels in times past.\n\nAfter crossing the promenade, we walked up a very steep street to the location of the old city walls. The picture below shows the challenge we faced. This is the view looking down the street in the opposite direction.\n\nThere is a Statue of St. George and the dragon next to the city wall at the top of the street. (St. George is a popular patron saint in the area in general.) The comment was made that the slain dragon in this statue looks like a lizard!\n\nWe climbed some steps from the street we were on up to the wall and walked to a tower and a gate to the Upper Town. It happens to be the only one still preserved. The Gate is called the Stone Gate. There is a shrine inside the gate to Our Lady of the Stone Gate. The slabs to the left and right of the altar have words etched on them. Most of the writing includes the word Hvala, which means Thank You in English.\n\nEmerging from the gate one sees the oldest working pharmacy in Zagreb.\n\nThe next sight along the path of our walking tour was St. Marks Church. On the roof are the coat of arms of Zagreb, and that of The Triune kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. The checkerboard pattern of red and white on the roof can be seen on the uniforms of players in different sports representing Croatia.\n\nThe parliament building, and other government buildings, surrounded the big and empty square around the church. Barriers prevent entry by the common man to the square itself. We were there when a convoy of black cars pulled up to one of the buildings and some official looking people stepped out, surrounded by what looked like security people. (They were keeping an eye on what was going on around them.) The barriers came up during COVID. The politicians are apparently not inclined to give up their fence, but the local population is not happy about the situation. It is a fluid situation.\n\nWe were told about the coffee drinking habits of the Croatian people. They do not take it “to go” when they go to the cafes. They always sit in the cafes and socialize. Apparently, the appearance of paper cups for “take out” is a newer phenomenon in the country, accelerated by COVID. One can buy food from bakeries and other places close by to consume in the coffee shops – which typically only have coffee.\n\nOn the road leading away from St. Marks Church, we passed the Croatian Museum of Naïve Art, the Greek Catholic Church, and the Museum of Broken Relationships.\n\nWe heard about King Bela 4th of Hungary and Croatia. The upper part of Zagreb, called Gradec, was proclaimed a royal free city during his time (see Golden Bull of 1242). The people of this town had some additional freedoms because of this. The citizens of the city were expected to build fortifications for their town at their own expense in return. The walls of the upper city encompassed the space they occupied. This community used to be in conflict with the neighboring Kaptol community which was under the control of the church. These two communities used to tangle with each other, and the Bloody Bridge was the site of some of these fights. The two communities together eventually combined to form the city of Zabreb.\n\nWe passed a crowd of young kids getting an outdoor history lesson. It was fun to watch the lesson and see the way the kids responded to the teacher.\n\nWe walked to the Southern defensive tower, called Lotrščak Tower. The cannon in the upper window fires at noon every day. You can see the cannon better in this zoomed in picture. The cannon startles the tourists, but the locals are used to it. The tower is next to the funicular, which was not operational at that time.\n\nWe made our way down steps from the wall of the upper town to the main shopping street of Old Zagreb.\n\nThis was one of the steps we encountered on our way down. I saw a reference to it on the Internet that used the phrase “Okolo Around”. This is what Okolo Around is all about.\n\nWe arrived at the main road, and after a short distance took a side street that led towards Petar Preradović Square. On the way we passed the only Orthodox Church in Zagreb, the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord. There was the smell of incense within the church. The interior appeared to be under renovation. We were told that the Greek and Russian patriarchs are the most powerful of the leaders in the Orthodox church.\n\nWe next passed through Petar Preradović Square itself, passing the statue of Petar Preradović along the way. The other side of this square was busy with activity by this time in the morning. The square is also called Flower Square.\n\nWe passed through a building next to the square whose most significant feature was a open area in a wide passageway called the Octogon. It is considered a tourist attraction.\n\nComing out of the passageway, we were back on the main road leading up to Ban Jelačić Square.\n\nThis was the end of the walking tour from Gate1. We had time on our own after this to wander around, till about noon time. We had another optional tour scheduled for the afternoon.\n\nThe first thing we did was go back to the tunnel and the funicular that we had passed during the walking tour earlier in the morning.\n\nWe first walked through the Gric tunnel. Its entrance had been pointed out to us earlier on. The tunnel was built during World War II as a bomb shelter and a promenade. There was an exhibition going on at the time we were there.\n\nApparently, there are other tunnels like this in Croatia, and more old tunnels are still being discovered even today.\n\nUsing Google maps as our guide, we found our way to the street with the funicular at the end of it. The funicular was not operational at the time. You can see that some work is going on on the rails. I walked up to the funicular and got a picture that includes the funicular and the Lotrščak Tower towering above it.\n\nWe retreated back to the main square to have our lunch and to get ready to walk back to the hotel to catch the bus for our outing that afternoon. I was happy to see the the trams had started running by this time. Mira had gotten tickets for us to be able to take the tram back to the hotel if we wanted, but that plan apparently was no longer in play.\n\nWe got sandwiches from a bakery next to square (annoying the lady behind the counter with our questions and indecisiveness in the process I think!), and then walked over to the Kraš ice cream place (that had been pointed out to us earlier in the day) in order to consume the food. We had been told that Kraš sells some of the best chocolate in Croatia. Some of us had their chocolate ice cream. Others just had coffee with their lunch. The ice cream was very good indeed.\n\nWe had had a wonderful morning walking the streets of Zagreb. The city square had been a charming place to be in. I enjoyed watching the city in action. I enjoyed watching the constant movement of many generations of blue city trams through the square.\n\nWe walked back to the hotel shortly after.\n\nWe had a little time to go to our rooms before departing for our afternoon tour of the countryside.\n\nYou can find all my pictures from the visit to Zagreb that morning here.\n\nIt was raining as we departed the hotel on our afternoon trip, but, thankfully, the skies cleared up quickly.\n\nWe left Zabreb county and headed north to enter the county of Krapina-Zagorje.\n\nKrapina is the town in which they have a museum containing remains from a Neanderthal settlement that were found in this area. Ages of the individuals whose remains were found ranges between 2 and 38. They were taller people than homo sapiens of today, but had less brain development. They have found traces of cannibalistic behavior amongst the population.\n\nOur bus route ran close to the Sutla River that forms the border between Croatia and Slovania in this region. The Sutla is a tributary of the Sava river.\n\nOur first destination for the afternoon was the town of Kumrovec. We saw signs of interest in development of tourism in the area.\n\nWe were going to the ethnographic village museum in Kumrovec. This space includes many houses of permanent ethnographic displays, focusing on the crafts and customs of Croatia. One of the houses in Kumrovec happens to be the one where Josip Broz Tito was born and brought up.\n\nA young man whose name was Carlo (seen with the microphone in this picture) was our guide at Kumrovic. We started the tour at the far end of the old village and made our way slowly towards the entrance.\n\nThe first place we passed was a massive house with a barn underneath. Two families shared the space. The families apparently made crafts at home. The first house we actually entered had displays of pottery. The theme for the second house we entered was toys. Then there was the home for the newlyweds. After that, there was the house with Gingerbread hearts display.\n\n(A fuller set of pictures from this visit can be seen here.)\n\nSome houses had gardens. There is a stream that flows through the village, and there are locations along the stream where the villagers can go down from the embankment to the stream to access the water. Corn cobs were used for decoration outside some homes, and was also used for keeping the birds away from the inside.\n\nWe passed a building with a traditional thatched straw roof, an opportunity to talk about the nature of roofs in that part of Croatia. Thatched roofs made the homes difficult to keep dry.. Grey tiled roofs were good but heavy. The locals finally moved to clay roofs.\n\nThe next display was about blacksmiths. They were some of the wealthier people in the village. Tito’s family were blacksmiths.\n\nThere was the house with Zagorje-style wedding display. Then a big two story house (I forgot the theme for this house, but here is a picture of a room in it) with a corn crib next to the house. The next stop in the village was the Firehouse display.\n\nThe final stop was Tito’s home. It included a barn. The barn was built by his grandfather. Tito’s father and grandfather lived in separate parts of the house next to each other. We entered the black room, which was the kitchen in the center area between the two parts of the house. Tito was proud of his home. Later on, he converted his grandfather’s room into a display room for people he invited to visit. These people included dignitaries and leaders from other countries. The statue next to the barn is from 1948.\n\nPeople who had originally lived in the homes in the area of this museum were given alternate homes to move to after their homes were taken over for the museum. Houses could even be in other places. Some folks still remain in the space surrounding the museum.\n\nWe left the museum soon after to drive to our next destination.\n\nWe heard that this area was at the crossroads for trade and engagements between different peoples. We were in an area of castles inhabited by the people who controlled the local spaces. We were going to go to dinner at a restaurant with a good view of one of these castles. Its name is Veliki Tabor. This one dates back to the middle of the 15th century. It is a gothic style castle which was fortified in the 16th century, when more towers and walls were added. In 1793 the castle changed ownership and went into disrepair. It was used for other purposes since then, including as a school, an orphanage etc.. The castle is used for re-enactments these days.\n\nThis castle is the setting for the love story of Frederick and Veronica, a story that is worth repeating here. In the Middle Ages, Veliki Tabor belonged to Count Hermann II of Celje. His son Fridrik fell in love with Veronika, a girl from a poor family. Hermann refused to accept a minor noblewoman as his daughter-in-law. He accused her of witchcraft in court but lost his case. Hermann had her imprisoned and then drowned anyway. Frederick’s rebellion against Hermann ended with Frederick’s imprisonment.\n\nThe restaurant was on top of a hill and provided a good line of sight to the castle which was also on a hilltop.\n\nWe had to walk up from the bottom of the hill to the top to get to the restaurant. People who had trouble walking uphill were taken up by car. There were little wayside displays along the way with the primary themes being the castle and the love story of Frederick and Veronika.\n\nWe all got a welcome drink of honey liqueur before we entered the restaurant. I went looking for seconds but it was all gone.\n\nThe restaurant was run by a family and was quite homey on the inside – in fact it might have been a converted home! We sat with a couple of ladies (they were friends who were traveling together) at the dinner table in a far corner of one of the rooms. After a salad, we were served a dinner of Mlinci pasta with chicken, pork chops and beans. This is the plate from which we shared. The young lady who was serving us gave us the recipe for the pasta, and one of the ladies at our table decided she was going to make it when she got back to the US. The pictures I found on the Internet make it look like a chapati prior to its being served as a base for the meat that is placed over it. The pasta actually cannot be well seen in the picture I took.\n\nBlueberry liqueur with a strudel dessert followed our dinner.\n\nWe had to walk back down the hill after dinner to get back to our bus. The sun had already set by the time we got back to Zagreb.\n\nThe next blog in this series here.\n\nWe left our hotel in Belgrade at 8:00 that morning to head out to Zagreb.\n\nZagreb is the capital of Croatia. It is a center for government and industry. Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet here, making the area the center of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia, and a hub for transportation in the country.\n\nThis was going to be one of the long drives of the tour. The only real stop for tourism along the way was at a winery.\n\nIt did not take long to leave the city. We were heading towards western Serbia. It was a work day in the city.\n\nSoon we were driving past fields and plains. We drove past an old Roman settlement. The current town of Sremska Mitrovica used to be one of the capitals in the Roman Empire. It used to be called Sirmium. (The empire of Rome was split by Emperor Diocletian at one point into four jurisdictions managed by four tetrarchs.) The town used to be a stop on the tour in the past, but no longer is. Perhaps it takes up too much time to properly explore the space.\n\nConstantine was born in Serbia. Serbia gave the world 18 Roman emperors.\n\nWe took a break at a rest stop just before we got out of Serbia.\n\nAs we approached the border, we started passing a long line of trucks next to the road. They were basically parked on one of the two lanes. The line stretched a few miles long. It takes a lot of time for the trucks to cross the border because Serbia is not part of Schengen nations. Each of the trucks needs to be checked. These trucks are apparently transporting goods from Serbia and Turkey. We were told that it could sometimes take days for them to cross. This is a major bother, and a bigger concern if the trucks carry perishable items that needs to be kept refrigerated.\n\nThis was going to be our first border crossing in a Gate1 tour, and it happened to be on a bus! Apparently, procedures for the passengers at this border can be fluid and unpredictable. One could not predict exactly how the bus and its passengers would be checked, and how long the process would take. This time a young Serbian Immigration officer came on board the bus to collect our passports. (Apparently, the tour managers were sometimes told to collect the passports.) He returned quickly with the stamped passports.\n\nThere was a separate stop the for Customs check. We did not have to get out of the bus, and the stop here was quick.\n\nThe next stop was Croatian Immigration. We stepped out of the bus and into a building to get our passports stamped. It was also a quick process.\n\nThere was a line of trucks on the other side of the border waiting to cross into Serbia. The line was shorter than the one waiting to leave Serbia.\n\n(Recap of history of this region: We were told that the place was inhabited first in 1100 BC by the Illyrians. (But they have also found some Neanderthal skeletal remains in a place called Krapina.) Around 230 BC, Princess Teuta apparently invited Romans to keep the Greeks away. They stayed for 800 years! This included the time of the Byzantine empire. Then came the Slavs and the Ottomans. Croatia separated from Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It joined the EU in 2013, and the Schengen and Eurozone in 2023.)\n\nThe regions of Croatia include Istria in the north (influenced by Italy and Austria), Zagreb (or Central Croatia), Dalmatia (Roman influenced) and Slavonia (Austro-Hungarian influence). We had entered Croatia in the region of Slavonia.\n\nThe highway to Zagreb runs near the Bosnian border in this region. This is a picture of the countryside we were passing.\n\nWe got off the highway and continued our drive to the winery on country roads.\n\nSlavonia is an agricultural area, and is the breadbasket of Croatia. There is no heavy industry. There is no pollution. The region produces a lot of fruits and dairy products. Honey is produced. They have free range chicken. Houses will advertise that they are selling jaja – eggs! A very high proportion of the families own tractors. This is also the region of wineries. Rakia and wine are also produced in the homes. Lipizzaner horses are bred in Slavonia. They follow the patriarchal model of life and have joint families.\n\nWe heard about the music of Slavonia, and also heard some of it, on the bus. Bećarac music is listed as an UNESCO-intangible cultural heritage. It is humorous music and mainly sung by men. It is influenced by Hungarian music. The tamburica is a regional musical instrument. Songs of romance are popular. Mira recommended our coming back for a well known regional music festival.\n\nAs we were passing some woods, we were told that Slavonian oak was used for making barrels for the wineries since they are less expensive. They apparently also have a good reputation.\n\nThe winery we stopped at was in Kutjevo village. It is called the Krauthaker Winery. It is one of the biggest private wineries in Croatia. Our guide for the tour of the winery was a gentleman named Drajen (not completely sure that I spelt that correctly). He is the sommelier. He gets to sample all the wines regularly, and also with the visitors. What a job!\n\nThe winery overlooks the Golden Valley.\n\nThe winery was established in 1992. It is a young winery. They produce 700,000 liters of wine annually today. They have three different locations, 35 labels, and use 44 different varieties of grapes.\n\nWe got to sample multiple wines while Drajen spoke to us about the nature of these wines. We were given some platters of bite size food to go with our wine. (It has been emphasized to me that it is not good to drink on an empty stomach.☺️).\n\nThe food was made by Drajen and he was proud of it. Pumpkin seed oil was used in the hummus. Apparently this is significant because pumpkin oil is very difficult to extract. The bread was made in clay oven.\n\nAs a part of the wine tasting process, we were given instructions to not try to finish the wines we did not like. There were metal containers that were placed on the table to allow us to empty any leftover wine into, so that the next sample could be poured into the glass. I only know that I did not throw out any wine!\n\nWe had the following wines: Julija sparkling wine, Grasevina Italian Reisling, Pinot sivi, Sauvignon Vidim, Chardonnay Rosenberg, Blauburger (our first red wine – with 14% alcohol), Mercs (a red blend of Merlot of Cabernet) and Mustra (a sweet wine). They all had distinctive tastes.\n\nAbout the wine making process – Vineyards are typically on the hillsides. 10% of Croatian wines are produced in the area around Kutjevo. The primary market for the wines is Croatia. If production suffers, exports are reduced.\n\nDifferent grapes are harvested at different times during the season. They take 45 days to harvest all their grapes. The grapes are picked by hand. 12% of the grapes today are red grapes. Red wine is stored in wooden barrels and the white wines mainly in metal barrels. Red wine includes skin in the fermentation process. Drajen told us about the processes for creating sweet wines, and wines of different alcohol levels.\n\nHe noted that Shiraz is one of the oldest varieties of wine. It is good for mixed wines for adding color. Another fact noted was that one has to be careful when making fruit wines. Methanol, or methyl alcohol, a poison, can be generated in varying concentrations as a part of the process.\n\nThere was a rush for the rest room after this activity, after which we got to visit the storage area for the wines, the place in which they were aged in barrels, and also do some shopping if we were so inclined.\n\nTeresa offered folks some of the snacks that we had taken with us. I noticed Drajen partaking from the bag more than once. I thought that he definitely could have used the food in his stomach after all his “sampling”. It seemed to me that he was getting more and more animated, and perhaps a little red faced, as he was going through his long presentation earlier, although he never lost his place, and even manned the wine store afterwards! I wondered how he kept up with the pace of his job, especially the sampling of the wines. The word on the bus from Mira was that he does have regular medical checkups, and all is well!\n\nThe rest of the drive to Zagreb was uneventful, except for the need for a pit stop because of all the wine that had been consumed. This time, I was the one who had to declare the emergency. I tried to do it quietly, but my effort was partially thwarted by Mira – she was not looking at her messages on her mobile phone. I had to stagger up to the front of the fast moving bus to pass on my message.\n\nIt was interesting to see a Croatian Railroad train during this part of the ride. The trainset is the HŽ 7023. They came into service during the last decade.\n\nWe arrived in Zagreb soon after. What was noticeable to me were the tram lines running on all the major roads. All of the trams were a shade of blue that caught your attention, and these trams were running quite frequently. There were also trams from so many different generations sharing the lines. I think I would have appreciated seeing something like this even more when I was a kid, but the curiosity still exists! I could not get a good picture that evening because I was on the wrong side of the bus!\n\nRush hour traffic was quite heavy in the city. We arrived at the Zagreb Sheraton soon after. It turned out to be an older facility that had undergone renovation to get in newer features..\n\nDinner was in the hotel itself. We got a chance to meet up with the rest of our group. We retired to our rooms soon after dinner.\n\n*****************\n\nWe had received a lot more information as we were leaving Belgrade and Serbia that morning. These are from my notes:\n\nSerbia has negative birth rate. Steps have been taken to encourage larger families. Woman get one year of maternity leave, mostly paid for by the government. There are also many cheap government kindergartens.\n\nChildren in Serbia learn Cyrillic first and then English.\n\nThe government spends money on infrastructure, including hospitals. There is corruption in the medical field even though medical services are supposed to be free. Doctors expect more money to provide a better quality of care. Nurses are not paid well – even waitresses get a better income.\n\nThere are new occupational opportunities in Serbia. Call centers are being set up in the country. Digital nomads also come to Serbia to work.\n\nMira recommended a couple of Serbian movies – Underground and Black cats and white cats. The movies are by Emir Kusturica, a reknown Serbian Director. His movies appear to focus on life of the common man in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSerbian people are said to be good neighbors and socialize with each other. It is different in countries like Croatia and Slovenia. Serbians are curious about each other – they want to know how much you earn. They are gossipy people in general!\n\nWeddings in Serbia: Weddings are big, especially in the countryside. The whole community is invited. A member of the family goes round with a wooden flask of Rakia to share with people. Before 1846, you could buy the bride. Now there are just ceremonial gestures in this regard. You apparently also had to fill the woman’s shoe with money until the shoe fits before your proposal was accepted. There is also the shooting of an apple involved before the wedding! Weddings happen in the church. Everything is done three times including exchange of rings. First steps of the young couple includes walking under the table. (I have not seen any online confirmation on this one!) The best man throws coins into the crowd at the end of a wedding! Live musicians are important at weddings. The music is lively. Watch this dance video from a wedding in Serbia. I believe the dance is called the Kolo. People used to give gifts like cattle, barbecue, etc. Today they give money.\n\nDivorce rates in Serbia are high. Drazn said it is 33%.\n\nSerb and Croatian foods: There are different spices and flavors in the different regions. Serbs (and eastern Balkans) use a lot more onions and garlic than Croatians. There is more of the influence of spices from the Ottomans in Serbia. Serbs use sunflower oil. Croats use olive oil (more Mediterranean influenced). Foods from both regions are considered light. Carp is popular in Serbia. Squid is popular in Dalmatia in Croatia. Black risotto is from Croatia. Strukli is the local pastry from Zagreb. Apple strudels and dumplings are popular in Slovenia. In East Serbia they eat more roasted meat. Croatia has more fish and cheese .\n\nMira expressed the opinion that it is not likely that Serbia will convert to the Eurozone any time soon. Also, that there is still general propaganda from Russia these days that western values and ways are bad. Older people tend to believe this propaganda. Mira claims that Serbia is and was better off than other Eastern European countries – foreign goods, music, etc., were always available in Yugoslavia but not in some other Balkan countries.\n\nThe next blog in this series here."
