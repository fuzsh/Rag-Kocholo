You could translate it as “little blue.” Plavac Mali shows two characters. One, cultivated on superior appellations, such as Dingač and Postup, differs from those cultivated in other areas of Pelješac and the South Dalmatian hinterland.\n\nWith its full-bodied, strong taste and stable characteristics, higher alcohol and tannins, and rich aromas of carob, figs, and sage, Plavac Mali can compete with some of the most prominent international wines. The microclimate, sun exposure, so-called triple insolation, and steep slopes are characteristic of Pelješac Dingač and Postup appellations, which is one of the reasons for the distinctive character of Plavac Mali.\n\nNotable producers of Plavac Mali wines from Dingač appellation:\n\nMatuško winery\n\nBura-Mrgudić winery\n\nBenmoche family\n\nVicelić winery\n\nMadirazza winery\n\nSaint Hills winery\n\nKiridžija winery\n\nMatković winery\n\nEdivo winery\n\nDingač winery\n\nSagul\n\nSkaramuča winery.\n\nNotable producers of Plavac Mali wines from Postup appellation:\n\nBura-Mrgudić winery\n\nMadirazza winery\n\nMikulić winery\n\nNotable producers of Plavac Mali wines from other Pelješac appellations and wine-growing Dalmatian regions:\n\nKorta Katarina winery\n\nGrgić winery\n\nKriž winery\n\nMarkus winery\n\nVislander winery\n\nTerra Madre\n\nRizman winery\n\nStina winery\n\nVolarević winery\n\nPlenković winery\n\nCrvik winery\n\nIndulge your senses with an excellent introduction to this popular Croatian red wine with our Plavac Mali special case and best of Dingač wine case.\n\nBABIĆ [ba-bie-ch]\n\nBabić, native to Šibenik-Primošten wine-growing region, is potentially the noblest Dalmatian red grape variety. It can showcase a truly unique terroir character when grown on Bucavac terraced, steep, sunny slopes in extreme conditions. Like Plavac mali, Babić needs as little soil as possible, lots of sun exposure, and lower yields. It also has one characteristic that potentially makes it more successful than its cousin.\n\nDespite the summer heat and the red-hot stone under it, Babić successfully preserves the ideal acidity ratio, giving it a more harmonious tone and a livelier character. Its elevated acids combine fantastically with high alcohol and ripe tannins, so the body becomes bold but at the same time drinkable and delicious. Concentration, minerality, and depth are the key ingredients that make this wine truly exceptional.\n\nBut the most impressive quality of Babić is its remarkable ability to preserve freshness and brightness, even in the scorching Mediterranean heat. It’s as if this wine is naturally immune to over-ripeness and jamminess, making it a top pick for any wine connoisseur.\n\nNotable producers of Babić from the famous Bucavac appellation:\n\nGracin winery\n\nPrgin winery\n\nMarkus winery\n\nNotable producers of Babić from other appellations and wine-growing Dalmatian regions:\n\nRAK winery\n\nTestament winery\n\nDelusional wine winery\n\nBibich winery\n\nGalić winery (Ego brand)\n\nLivaić winery\n\nPlenković winery\n\nCRLJENAK KAŠTELANSKI [tserl-yee-ehnak kashh-tell-ann-skee]\n\nCrljenak Kaštelanski (also known as Tribidrag and Pribidrag in Croatia Zinfandel in America, and Primitivo in Italy) is a red grape variety native to Kaštela wine-growing region. Due to its low resistance to diseases, the variety has almost disappeared from Croatian vineyards. It experienced a renaissance in California under the name Zinfandel and in southern Italy under the name Primitivo.\n\nKnown as the father of Plavac mali, Crljenak Kaštelanski is a grape whose written records date back to the 15th century. Crljenak Kaštelanski is a full-bodied, intensely deep, and strong red wine with a pronounced varietal aroma of spices, berries, and a charming and easy-to-pronounce name.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nKorta Katarina winery\n\nBenmoche family winery\n\nRizman winery\n\nBedalov winery\n\nStina winery\n\nGrabovac winery\n\nVuina winery\n\nMatela winery\n\nRadunić winery\n\nKrolo winery\n\nGrgić winery\n\nMatuško winery\n\nAlthough known by different names, it is still the same variety. We prepared a selection of six different Crljenak wines from its region of origin – Dalmatia. Feel free to compare it during a blind tasting with Zinfandel and Primitivo.\n\nMALVAZIJA [malvaˈziːa]\n\nLet’s talk about Malvasia – but not just any Malvasia, we’re talking about the native variety – Malvazija or Malvasia Istriana! Now, you might be thinking, “what’s so special about this one?” Well, every winemaker in Istria makes at least one, and each one is unique.\n\nBut first, a little background. Did you know that the Malvasia grape variety is a shared name of up to as many as 20 different varieties grown all over Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, California, Slovenia, and Croatia? Many of these varieties have nothing in common – they’ve been called Malvasia historically.\n\nIstrian winemakers are creative, so they transform this grape variety into everything: from sparkling wine to light, fresh wine, serious vintages aged on the lees, orange wines, and intense sweet wines. With so many stylistic differences, there’s a Malvazija for everyone.\n\nSo, what can you expect from a glass of Malvasia Istriana? It’s usually made in a refreshing and easy-drinking fruit-forward style, with a unique acacia note that sets it apart.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nKabola winery\n\nKozlović winery\n\nBenvenuti winery\n\nClai winery\n\nCoronica winery\n\nTrapan winery\n\nMatošević winery\n\nFranković winery\n\nVina Laguna winery\n\nMedea winery\n\nRossi winery\n\nPiquentum winery\n\nDamjanić winery\n\nMeneghetti winery\n\nGordia winery\n\nRitoša winery\n\nDvorac Belay winery\n\nGRAŠEVINA [graʃevɪna]\n\nCroatian wine buffs are especially proud their Graševina is recognized as the finest face of Welschriesling. It is official. The World Atlas of Wine uses the name Graševina and “Graševina first” truly sounds like an unspoken slogan of Croatian wines since this is the most planted variety in Croatia. It can be done dry, sweet, sparkling, or anything.\n\nIf you plan on a celebration in Croatia, you can’t miss out on Graševina wine. It’s no wonder that this wine is a staple, given the incredible range of styles winemakers can produce. The most common style is a fresh, young, dry wine that bursts with fruity and floral aromas. Think green apple, quince, pear, and elderflower, all perfectly balanced with crisp acidity and medium alcohol content.\n\nBut here’s the real kicker – depending on where the vineyard is located, you may also detect mineral qualities in this wine.\n\nGraševina is a late-ripening grape capable of producing late-harvest dessert wines and sweet wines made from botrytis grapes. These sweet wines are a different game, with more concentrated aromas and flavors, ripe fruit notes, and a honeyed character. And suppose you’re lucky enough to visit during the winter. In that case, when the conditions are right, and the grape “survives” until January/mid-February, some producers will even pick Graševina to make ice wine after the temperatures drop below -7°C (45 F).\n\nNotable producers:\n\nKutjevo winery\n\nKrauthaker winery\n\nAntunović winery\n\nAdžić winery\n\nJosić winery\n\nBarun winery\n\nIločki podrumi winery\n\nIlovčak winery\n\nKrešić winery\n\nGalić winery\n\nEnosophia winery\n\nMarkota winery\n\nPetrač winery\n\nSontacchi winery\n\nJakovac winery.\n\nPOŠIP [poe-ship]\n\nThis white variety is a true Croatian treasure native to the stunning island of Korčula. But what makes this grape so special? Luckily, it was discovered and is one of the few grapes that survived the devastating phylloxera outbreak. It still grows on its original rootstock since it was first planted in the sandy soils of Smokvica village. So not only is it delicious, but it’s also a survivor! Pošip is now grown throughout Dalmatia – from the Pelješac peninsula to the islands of Brač and Hvar and Biokovo slopes.\n\nWhen harvested and vinified right, it is a full-bodied white wine with the perfect balance of alcohol and acidity. The wine boasts an intense aroma and flavor that will have you dreaming of dried apricots and figs. It’s no wonder why Pošip is a beloved grape variety in Croatia and beyond!\n\nNotable producers of Pošip from Korčula island:\n\nPZ Nerica winery\n\nKrajančić winery\n\nMerga Victa winery\n\nPecotić Baran winery\n\nZure winery\n\nPZ Čara\n\nBlato 1902.\n\nNotable producers of Pošip from other parts of Dalmatia:\n\nGrgić winery\n\nKorta Katarina winery\n\nStina winery\n\nVolarević winery\n\nSenjković winery\n\nMilan winery\n\nTestament winery\n\nRizman winery\n\nDeggara winery\n\nPlenković winery\n\nGrabovac winery\n\nTerra Madre winery\n\nSkaramuča winery\n\nGRK [g r k]\n\nGrk is a tough one!? Well, not exactly. It’s pronounced the way it is written. Think of it as a test to pronounce three consonants in a row. It sounds a bit like a work “Greek” (without “ee”) and, surprisingly so, has the same meaning. But it is a native white variety from the small town of Lumbarda on Korčula island. Exclusive, rare, and obscure variety, Grk is.\n\nNow, there is no need to travel to Korčula to enjoy a glass of Grk or two. But beware, as Grk absorbs all the sun exposure transforming it into intoxicating, powerful, structured white wine. Get ready to indulge in medium-bodied wines with zingy high acidity. Grk wines are known for their unique fruity and mineral aromas, with hints of herbs, saltiness, or even pine with a delightfully tart and delicately bitter aftertaste.\n\nNotable producers from Korčula island:\n\nBire winery\n\nZure winery\n\nCebalo winery\n\nMatuško winery.\n\nŽLAHTINA [ʒlahtɪna]\n\nŽlahtina is a native white grape variety grown specifically in the vineyards of a small town called Vrbnik on the island of Krk. It’s become an absolute must-have on the wine lists of restaurants and online shops nationwide and wider. Wine enthusiasts are smitten with its refreshing character and the delightful, airy scent that reminds one of the gentle flowers and ripe fruit. But that’s not all – its light, smooth, and silky taste is the cherry on top. It’s no wonder that Žlahtina is considered the leading varietal of the region.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nToljanić winery\n\nŠipun winery\n\nIvan Katunar winery.\n\nDEBIT [de-bit]\n\nLet us paint a picture for you: imagine a grape that’s so special. It was once used as a currency for payment. That’s Debit, a late-ripening white grape native to North Dalmatia. This grape has quite a fascinating history, having won numerous awards and even being exported to France and Italy. It’s said that even Marshal Marmont couldn’t resist a glass of Debit!\n\nSo what makes Debit so unique? Well, this grape combines the freshness of the north with the strength of the south, resulting in a light, mineral, fresh, and dry wine with a one-of-a-kind style. When you take a sip of Debit, you’ll be hit with the scent of citrus blended with chamomile flower, rounded out with the flavor of the sea, salt, and stone.\n\nIf you want to try the best expressions of Debit, you’ll want to head to the Promina and Drniš wine regions. Here, you’ll find Debit with a fluttery and fresh taste, boasting floral and fruity aromas with a hint of acidity.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nAnte Sladić winery\n\nBibich winery\n\nTestament winery\n\nRAK winery\n\nMARAŠTINA [ma-rash-ti-na]\n\nMaraština is an old and indigenous grape variety found along the Dalmatian coastline. Also known as Rukatac and Krizol, Maraština was once one of the most widespread Dalmatian white grape varieties.\n\nAromas and flavors range from herbal, ripe pears, quince-like fruit characters, apricot, peach, and hints of vanilla. With a fruity fragrance, golden-yellow color, and lower acidity and alcohol content, this wine is perfect for those who enjoy a smooth and flavorful feel.

The fruity flavor is mild and reminiscent of barely ripe apples and young pears, with just a touch of dried herbs. The more prestigious brands of Škrlet wine also have distinct mineral notes of quartz and schist, adding depth and complexity to their exquisite taste.\n\nNotable producers from Moslavina wine-growing region:\n\nKosovec winery\n\nLagena winery\n\nVinarty winery\n\nIlovčak winery\n\nVoštinić Klasnić winery\n\nVUGAVA [vu-ga-va]\n\nGet ready to discover one of Croatia’s oldest grape varieties, the mighty Vugava (or Bugava), from the stunning Vis island!
