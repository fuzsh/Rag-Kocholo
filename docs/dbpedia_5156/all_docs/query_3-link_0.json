        "text": "The story of Gra≈°evina\n\nAccording to some researchers, every fourth sold bottle of Croatian wine ‚Äì is Gra≈°evina. Although highly grown in the Slavonia and Danube region, you will find it almost everywhere in the continental part of Croatia. Check out our extensive guide to Croatian wine regions for more detailed insight.\n\nPicture 1. Croatian wine regions\n\nWinemakers can perform miracles with this grape, and Gra≈°evina rarely disappoints. It thrives and adjusts well to different soils and adores continental climates. Not only that, but Gra≈°evina proved to be resistant to ever-expanding natural challenges, and careful viticulture brings results even in the most challenging years.\n\nIn the past, Gra≈°evina‚Äôs international reputation suffered due to two reasons. Firstly, certain countries oriented their production to quantity and not quality; secondly, it was often compared to Rhein Riesling (a completely different grape variety) and considered an inferior imitation.\n\nNo celebration or a good party in Croatia goes without Gra≈°evina. It‚Äôs so popular and in demand that Gra≈°evina is planted at more than 50% of the total vineyards in many continental parts of Croatia. Internationally approved, this wine often receives recognition in various international wine competitions.\n\nThe name ‚ÄúGra≈°evina‚Äù derives from the fact that the berries are green, resembling green peas, in one growth stage.\n\nTips: If you enjoy Chenin Blanc or younger Rieslings, even-aged Chardonnays, Gra≈°evina should be the next one on your list. You can find this variety in plenty of diverse styles: from sparkling wines to sweet dessert wines, which leaves us confident that you‚Äôll find the one that will suit your palate the most.\n\nThe mystery behind Gra≈°evina origin\n\nWhile some sources suggest that Gra≈°evina has its roots in France and Italy, and others point to neighboring Austria, Croatian winemakers assert with pride that the grape variety originated in the continental part of Croatia.\n\nYou will find this variety under different names, such as:\n\nWelschriesling (Austria and Germany),\n\nRiesling Italico (Italy),\n\nOlaszrizling (Hungary),\n\nRizling Vla≈°sky (Czech Republic and Slovakia),\n\nLa≈°ki Rizling (Slovenia),\n\nGra≈°ac and Italian Riesling (or just Riesling) (Serbia).\n\nThe stir behind the debated origin continues, although wine professionals and the wine public agree that the best examples come from Croatia.\n\nFor example, Mrs. Jancis Robinson, in the monumental ‚ÄúWine Grapes‚Äù ‚Äì a guide to world grape varieties co-written with Julia Harding and Jos√© Vouillamoz ‚Äì preferred the Croatian name ‚Äì Gra≈°evina ‚Äì as the official name for this variety. Enough said!\n\nOnce regarded as a loser, Gra≈°evina gained a newfound appreciation, almost as an act of rebellion of winemakers who continued to experiment, evolve and introduce new knowledge and practices in viticulture and the winemaking process.\n\nRegardless, the grape is once again recognized as a versatile entity, a multifaceted variety with the capacity to become ‚Äì almost anything!\n\nGra≈°evina grape variety characteristics\n\nIn contrast to the vineyards in Central and Eastern Europe, those on the southern and southwestern slopes of the mountains and hills of the Slavonian and Danube region, at positions, 200-400 meters above sea level, produce top-quality grapes.\n\nGra≈°evina is an exceptional grape variety that has the potential to produce a wide range of outstanding wines. Its capabilities span from producing light and refreshing dry wines to mature and more structured wines and excellent sparkling wines.\n\nIt can also produce late and selective harvests with noble rot, sweet dessert wines, and some of the most exquisite archive wines that can age for decades.\n\nMost Gra≈°evina wines are characterized by their fruity, mineral, and floral aromas, giving them a fresh and lively taste.\n\nOn the nose and palate, fresh apple, citrus, and pear notes are often prominent, along with white flowers and grassy flavors. Sweeter hints of exotic fruits, cantaloupe, quince, and honey are also commonly found in these wines.\n\nOne of the best descriptions of this variety was given by a woman winemaker Jasna Antunoviƒá Turk, owner of the Antunoviƒá winery in Dalj:\n\n‚ÄúFor me, Gra≈°evina is the perfect variety ‚Äì it is tender in the vineyard but resistant and persistent; in the winery ‚Äì beautiful and sparkling in the primary floral and fruity sensations, elegant and delicious even up to two or three years after the harvest, and rich and sumptuous in the tertiary predicate aromas. A wine so simple, yet so complex and diverse.‚Äù\n\nBest Gra≈°evina wine-growing regions and subregions\n\nThe Slavonia and Podunavlje wine region is divided into two sub-regions, Podunavlje (around the Danube river) and Slavonia (a historic region of Croatia located in the Pannonian basin, bordered by the Danube, Drava, and Sava rivers), with Slavonia being the most famous for winemaking. Those sub-regions are divided into smaller wine-growing regions.\n\nPodunavlje is known for its Baranja, Erdut, and Srijem wine-growing regions. Slavonia for Kutjevo, Daruvar, ƒêakovo, Feriƒçanci, Nova Gradi≈°ka, Orahovica-Slatina, Pakrac, Po≈æega-Pleternica, Slavonski Brod and Virovitica.\n\nGra≈°evina has been cultivated for more than 200 years in most of continental Croatia, particularly in the important regions of Kutjevo and regions near the Danube river, such as Srijem, Erdut, and Croatian Baranja. Some of the most stunning Croatian vineyards and appellations are located here.\n\nKutjevo wine-growing subregion\n\nKutjevo is the town‚Äôs name and the wine-growing region, also known as the ‚Äúcapital of Gra≈°evina.‚Äù Wines are grown on volcanic soils on the southern slopes of Krndija mountain and Papuk UNESCO Geopark and have a remarkable mineral and flinty character that perfectly conveys the terroir.\n\nThe Kutjevo wine region wines are among the finest Gra≈°evina examples. Check out our story about the oldest Croatian wine cellar and its remarkable archive cellar with 65.000 bottles of aged wines (the oldest one from vintage 1947) located in Kutjevo ‚Äì here and here.\n\nMany Kutjevo wineries offer entry-level Gra≈°evina, a lighter version of the variety. However, renowned wineries also produce full-bodied, well-balanced, single-vineyard wines that can age for several decades, such as Kutjevo, Krauthaker, Mihalj, Galiƒá, and Enjingi wineries.\n\nThese wineries, with lower yields and the right vineyard management, give Gra≈°evina of such complexity and longevity that wine lovers often leave a few bottles of premium wines in the wine cellar to see how they develop.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nKutjevo winery,\n\nKrauthaker winery,\n\nGaliƒá winery,\n\nAd≈æiƒá winery,\n\nSontacchi winery,\n\nEnjingi winery,\n\nMihalj winery,\n\nTandara winery,\n\nJakoboviƒá winery,\n\nSoldo winery,\n\nPerak winery.\n\nBaranja wine-growing subregion\n\nBaranja, a small triangular region located in the far northeast of Croatia, extends towards Serbia and Hungary, where the Drava and Danube rivers converge.\n\nThe area has gentle hills, sprawling wheat fields, and charming villages. Baranja is recognized as one of Croatia‚Äôs most important wine-growing subregions, featuring a variety of historic cellars and wineries.\n\nBelje winery,\n\nJosiƒá winery,\n\nKalaziƒá winery,\n\nGer≈°tmajer winery,\n\nSvijetli dvori winery,\n\nZlatno brdo winery,\n\nPinkert winery,\n\nKolar winery,\n\nSzabo winery,\n\nKusiƒá winery.\n\nErdut wine-growing subregion\n\nVineyards are located on the southern slopes and only a few kilometers away from the Danube River, which meanders in that position and embraces some vineyards from the north, east, and south.\n\nThe terroir of the Erdut wine-growing region in Croatian Podunavlje is specific precisely because of the dominant influence of the Danube on the climate and soil characteristics. The climate is moderately continental with warm and hot summers and cold winters, the altitude is from 150 to 400 m, moderate amounts of moisture and precipitation, and the soil is a type of degraded chernozem.\n\nAntunoviƒá winery,\n\nErdut wine cellars winery,\n\nJaneƒçiƒá winery,\n\nJakovac winery,\n\nSiber winery,\n\nBrzica winery.\n\nSrijem wine-growing subregion\n\nSrijem subregion boasts a tradition of wine-growing and production that goes back to Roman times. Free-draining soils sitting on a loess base are abundant on these slopes overlooking the Danube river, with an average elevation of 200-250 meters above sea level.\n\nThe constant winds that cool the slopes bring an intriguing note of salinity. Ilok, along with Vukovar and Dalmatian island Hvar have for years shared Croatia‚Äôs record for the most annual hours of sunlight per year.\n\nIloƒçki podrumi winery, as the most prominent producer of the region, has a good and precious archive cellar and an extensive collection of aged wines. If you‚Äôre wondering where to buy some amazing old vintages, look no more!\n\nIloƒçki podrumi winery,\n\nKre≈°iƒá winery,\n\nBuhaƒç winery,\n\nƒåobankoviƒá winery,\n\nPapak winery,\n\nZajac winery,\n\nMarija winery,\n\nPZ Trs winery.\n\nFeriƒçanci ‚Äì Orahovica wine-growing subregion\n\nThe wine-growing regions of Feriƒçanci and Orahovica are situated in a remarkably picturesque and varied terrain on the edge of Papuk UNESCO Geopark and Krndija mountain.\n\nThese regions boast exceptional diversity, complex geology, and a unique microclimate, making them highly suitable for viticulture. The vineyards have southern exposure at altitudes ranging from 160 to 250 meters.\n\nNotable producers:\n\nEnosophia (former Feravino) winery,\n\nPP Orahovica winery.\n\nDifferent Gra≈°evina expressions\n\nGra≈°evina is a late harvesting grape variety and, in the simplest young and fresh style, it will have a dominantly fruity, flowery character with crispy acidity and medium alcohol levels. It is a great start to a meal, as a chilled aperitif drink, and a companion to summer foods like clams, oysters, salads, and cured meat and cheeses.\n\nBecause it is a late harvesting grape variety and very resistant to diseases, some winemakers in Croatia tend to leave it a bit more in the vineyards until 5-10 % of the grapes get affected by the noble rot Botrytis.\n\nThis kind of noble rot is very welcoming when the conditions allow it to winemaking. Noble rot causes the grapes to shrink and accumulate acids and sugars, giving special and cherished flavors to the wine.\n\nThese styles show more complex and structures, fruit aromas become riper and, in some cases, cooked. There is a honey character on the nose but well balanced with fresh apples and citrus fruits. Gra≈°evina in this style often has slightly more alcohol; in drier years, that level can exceed 13.5% alc.\n\nNevertheless, concentrated berries give these wines power and more body, so the alcohol never stands out but is well integrated into the wine.\n\nWhen the vintage conditions allow it, producers will make selected berries harvest, producing intense dessert wines that require time to develop. You can even pick it so late, in the winter, when the temperatures go below ‚Äì 7 ¬∞C or -45¬∞F and grapes freeze on the vines ‚Äì producing adored golden drops of sweet ice wine (Eiswine).\n\nGra≈°evina aging potential\n\nGra≈°evina wines, made in dry or semi-dry styles, are often released to the market to be consumed young, fresh, and energetic, but that doesn‚Äôt diminish their true potential for aging.\n\nThe aging potential is astonishing when talking about premium Gra≈°evina from top producers. And those top-quality premium wines are rarely priced above 15 EUR. Older, aged, or archive wines and vintages are, of course, more expensive, as they should be.\n\nWe wrote about Enjingi Venje ‚Äì a collector‚Äôs treasure, and the same goes for Kutjevo Winery and its archive cellar or Iloƒçki Podrumi and its archive. Every wine enthusiast dreams!\n\nRecently, we had a vertical tasting of Krauthaker Mitrovac Gra≈°evina ‚Äì currently one of the most valued winemakers and Gra≈°evina producers among wine lovers and connoisseurs.\n\nVertical Tasting of Krauthaker Gra≈°evina Mitrovac\n\nSome winemakers, like Vlado Krauthaker, produce their premium Gra≈°evina Mitrovac from vineyards that have vines older than 30 years. These wines show concentration, power, and elegance and, in good vintages, give the wine strength to develop in the bottle for more than 5 years.\n\nVlado Krauthaker started producing his premium line of the Gra≈°evina Mitrovac in 2004. Tastings have shown that his bottles, some older than 10 years show development.\n\nThrough the aging process, Gra≈°evina has become softer and rounder, aromas develop in a riper style; cooked peaches, pears, quince, and some tropical nuances are followed by honey and mushrooms in the latest vintages.\n\nIf you want to relate to Croatian customs, you must try Gra≈°evina in all its styles and expresions!\n\nChardonnay vs. Gra≈°evina\n\nAt some point, the wine-drinking clique got so fed up with Chardonnay that the term ABC was coined. This abbreviation stands for Anything But Chardonnay.\n\nIt‚Äôs no coincidence that Chardonnay is one of the most planted varieties in the world. Some argue that Chardonnay became a synonym for a dry white wine as it grows everywhere and people worldwide enjoy it.\n\nBut why is it so popular around the world? First, it is a relatively low-maintenance grape variety, and disease control is more efficient. There are many practical solutions available for Chardonnay in terms of vineyard management.\n\nSecondly, its aroma and flavor are not too expressive. Although they depend on the climate conditions and sometimes the respected terroir, they also depend very much on the winemaker‚Äôs taste and desired design.\n\nWhen we think of a mainstream Chardonnay, what comes to mind is a relatively fresh and fruity, medium to fuller-bodied wine, commonly with buttery and vanilla notes achieved by malolactic fermentation and oak usage.\n\nSuch Chardonnays are very versatile wines. Want to have a grilled fish or a stuffed turkey breast filled with collard and Epoisses cheese on white polenta with slices of an avocado marinated with herb-infused sauce and a dressing of soy-coconut emulsion‚Ä¶ no problem. Good old Chard can go along.\n\nIn Croatia, Chardonnay grapes are grown in every wine region ‚Äì continental and coastal. These are very popular in fine dining.\n\nOf course, when you say Chardonnay, it rolls on the tongue beautifully‚Ä¶ shaa-duh-nay sounds like some Elven magic, doesn‚Äôt it. It makes you sound so sophisticated, like you just cast a spell of finesse and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, grah-sh‚Äôvin-ah sounds like you‚Äôre demented and having a psychiatric episode. Sometimes it feels that way too, in case you irresponsibly consume some homemade stuff üôÇ\n\nHowever, what is Chardonnay to the world that is Gra≈°evina to Croatia? And much more.\n\nInteresting fact: Chardonnay also, sort of, originates from Croatia genetically üôÇ\n\nIt is proven that Chardonnay is a cultivar that we got back in the day from crossing Pinot and a Croatian (Pannonian as a likely origin) variety Belina Bijela, aka Gouais Blanc. Although an extinct curiosity, this variety still exists in some old vineyards.\n\nPerhaps you have tried Gra≈°evina under its other names: Welschriesling, Olasz Riesling, Riesling Italico, La≈°ki Rizling, or others. These are the synonyms for Gra≈°evina, the same way Gra≈°evina is a synonym for white wine in Croatia.\n\nSo, one could argue that Gra≈°evina is perceived in Croatia as Chardonnay in the rest of the world ‚Äì a top-of-mind dry white wine (drank in large quantities ;)).\n\nAnother similarity between the two is that the style of Gra≈°evina wine greatly depends on the desired style of the winemaker, so you can find: dry, off-dry, and sweet Gra≈°evina.\n\nAlso, Gra≈°evina gives very good results as an amber/orange wine.\n\nWhat about bubbles? Yes, there is a sparkling wine from Gra≈°evina as well.\n\nSo, why should we give up ‚ÄúChardonnay‚Äù? We are talking about the prevailing practice. To produce modern wines from old native varieties. And if they all resemble ‚ÄúChardonnay,‚Äù what‚Äôs the point?\n\nSo, it‚Äôs not Chardonnay per se we‚Äôre suggesting we should drop. It‚Äôs the design by which the wines all look alike.\n\nIronically, most appreciated Chardonnay wines don‚Äôt even carry a name on the label. Yet, some of those Chablis or Montrachet wines represent the finest expression of terroir conceivable. Instead of broad generalization, we could seek out wines with a unique identity.\n\nHere you can find our selection of Gra≈°evina!\n\nAnd why not a Chardonnay as well?"
