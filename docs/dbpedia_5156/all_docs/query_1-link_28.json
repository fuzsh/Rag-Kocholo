        "text": "Galić Winery\n\nGalić winery is the generator of development of Croatia's continental region Slavonia, the cradle of winemaking in Croatia.\n\nPrivate client, for whom Dva arhitekta has already designed the project Wine chateau, wanted to invest in development of his hometown by builing a modern winery in the very center of Kutjevo town. On the nearby location, the monks in the 13th century founded the first abbey and wine cellar. Despite rich tradition in winemaking and many other prominent and awarded winemakers operating nowadays in the area, it remains underdeveloped, which makes bussiness initiative important for the whole region. By builiding a winery, basic conditions are created for the following: the development of new technologies in the production of wine, enlargment of the existing capacities in vineyards, modernisation of the touristic presentation techniques, new employment opportunities; all in the service of establishing a new set of standards concerning wine tourism and the following industry.\n\nThe winery is found in the Kutjevo city centre, on the main street near the castle (original abbey), on the spot where an old school used to be. Althought it is a city centre, the houses are very modest which is why the idea was for the winery to be primarily experienced as a city house. Only upon entering, the visitor would discover it is a production facility as well.\n\nA clear architectonic design derives from the intent the house fits into the city structure and yet remain contemporary. Initial inspiration comes from the traditional wine cellars and country houses. Buildings of the area often have concrete bases and brick walls which gain in patina and robustness in time. Contrary to the usual winery scheme, the barrels are placed into street window, instead of a cellar, to have contact with the street and invite passer-bys. Concrete base also comprises wine degustation facilities. The upper part of the house in brick houses the wine production and the storage, which communicate via back street.\n\nThe structure is in concrete, very basic. The base remains in concrete, forming vaults which both open and hide the space for wine ageing in barrels. The upper volume is cladded in brick. The division in materials follows the division of function."
