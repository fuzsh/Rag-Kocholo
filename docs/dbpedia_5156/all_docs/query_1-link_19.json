Reviewers may know general information about a flight to provide context—vintage, variety or appellation—but never the producer or retail price of any given selection.

The Malbec varietal is almost synonymous with Mendoza as it accounts for the majority of the region’s plantings, but Cabernet Sauvignon, Torrontés and Chardonnay are also heavily produced.

Some of the top northern Central Coast AVAs include, Santa Lucia Highlands, Santa Cruz Mountains and Monterey.
