        "text": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nEvery January there’s a gathering in Osijek dedicated to celebrating Croatian wines and the surrounding regions named WineOS. January 2020 marked the sixth edition of the festival. In addition to Croatian wines, there were selections from Hungary, Serbia, and Bosnia Herzegovina to taste.\n\nHere are my biggest takeaways from this sixth edition of WineOS. These are grapes, wines, and styles you should seek out if you make it to the region.\n\nGraševina\n\nGraševina is the most widely planted grape in Croatia. It’s a grape that goes under a myriad of names including Olaszrizling, Italian Riesling, Welschriesling, Grašac, Laški Rizling, and more. The grape is Croatia’s most planted variety.\n\nKutjevo (Slavonia) is considered the spiritual home of the grape but there are also fine examples being made along the Danube in Baranja county and around the city of Ilok. The latter two areas give warmer, meatier examples with lower acidity while wines from Kutjevo show herbal and grassy notes.\n\nCroatian Graševina is an ongoing story and the wines continue to improve. I generally prefer examples from Kutjevo where you can find everything from sparkling to botrytized sweet wines. The fresh examples of Graševina are wonderful with fresh seafood from the Dalmatian coast and come in at lower price points than other white Croatian wine staples like Malvazija Istarska and Pošip.\n\nWine Recommendations: Antunović Graševina 2018, Adžić Graševina 2018, Krauthaker Mitrovac 2018, Perak Mitrovac 2018, Kutjevo Degotho Graševina 2018, Belje Graševina 2018, Sontacchi Graševina 2019, Kolar Graševina 2018, Buhač Graševina Izborna Berba Bobica 2018\n\nContinental Red Croatian Wine\n\nThe majority of Croatian wine production in Slavonia and the Danube is white but there are some delicious reds being made too. The Central European grapes Frankovka (Blaufränkisch) and Zweigelt may be best suited for the region’s climate but many producers still opt to give Bordeaux varieties and Pinot Noir a go.\n\nThe reds in this region continue to improve. At the moment, they offer the best bang for the buck as far as red Croatian wines go. I would like to see more of a focus on regional blends like the Feravino Miraz Cuvée, Enjingi Venje, and Iločki Podrumi Kapistrani Crni, all of which contain Frankovka and or Zweigelt.\n\nThere are several delicious, fruity reds made from Bordeaux grapes. In terms of varietla wines, there are a handful of fine Cabernet Francs, which makes me wonder why more producers don’t focus on the grape. Don’t miss the TRS Cabernet Franc if you can find it.\n\nWine Recommendations: Feravino Miraz Cuvée 2017, Krauthaker MERCS 2017. Iločki Podrumi Kapistran Crni 2018, Buhač Cabernet Sauvignon 2017, Sontacchi Pinot Noir 2017, TRS Cabernet Franc 2016, Belje Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot 2016, Enjingi Venje Crno 2009\n\nBosnia Herzegovina\n\nSurprisingly, my biggest takeaway at WineOS 6 wasn’t Croatian wine.\n\nThere were 12 producers present from Bosnia Herzegovina, all of them from Western Herzegovina. All of them were pouring their wines made from Žilavka (white) and Blatina (red). It was the first time I had such an extensive tasting of the wines since the Blaž Festival 2018.\n\nI noticed a vast improvement in all of the producers present at the show, especially the examples of Žilavka. It’s a white grape with enormous potential and when I tasted through the samples a few years ago, almost everyone was using it to make simple, fruity innocuous whites. It seems like that is all in the past.\n\nThe newest vintages of Žilavka are full in body and have salty, savory notes with substantial texture. Some producers like Marjanović and Škegro macerate the grapes to extract even more flavor. Others that barrel ferment or barrel age their Žilavkas are dialing back on the oak, resulting in wines with more balance.\n\nWine Recommendations: Marjanović Žilavka Selekcija 2018, Vino Milas Žilavka 2018, Škegro Krš Orange Žilavka 2017, Vilinka X-Line Cuvée Red 2015, Brkić Plava Greda 2017, Carska Vina Blatina 2017\n\nThe finest selection of\n\nwines available at:\n\nShipping is available EU-wide and to the UK.\n\nCheck out Wines Available in the USA.\n\n************\n\nDo you want to try Croatian wines?\n\nIf you’re looking to savor the exquisite flavor of Croatian wines, look no further than wineandmore.com With an abundance of options from different winemakers, it’s easy to find exactly what your palate desires.
