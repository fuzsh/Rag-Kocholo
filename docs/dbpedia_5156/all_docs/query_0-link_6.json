        "text": "Slavonia is the beautiful, least visited and most eastern region of Croatia. It’s full of rolling hills of grain, vineyards, all kinds of produce, and in the summertime — sunflowers literally as far as the eye can see! It’s known as the “Bread Basket” of Croatia and holds one of the country’s most famous and beloved wine regions near the small village of Kutjevo. A big part of why we traveled there was to visit two of our favorite wineries, Krauthaker and Adžić. One of the wonderful aspects of wineries in Croatia is that they are almost always small, family owned and run and with the focus on quality, not quantity. Nearly every winery we’ve visited has been in the family’s home or their personal cellar and we’ve had the chance to taste wines with the winemaker himself.\n\nSweet Gracie girl exploring the Krauthaker cellar.\n\nCam was poured (huge!) tastings straight from the barrels.\n\nDrinking amazing Adžić wines (with local cheese and bread) with Mr. Adžić himself!\n\nThe dvorac (castle) just a short walk up the street from where we stayed in Kutjevo at Sontacchi Winery B&B — owned by a lovely family that cooked traditional Slavonian meals for us each night.\n\nThe beautiful Cathedral of St. Peter in Đakovo, not far from where we stayed. I’m in love with the starry night ceilings inside the cathedrals and churches in this part of the world!\n\nWe visited this Serbian Orthodox Monastery, without knowing that it was a Serb Orthodox holiday. It was packed with people and vendors, and as we walked in, it felt as though the music stopped and everyone abruptly ended their conversations and all turned to outright stare at us. I’m laughing writing this, but needless to say, we felt incredibly foreign and awkwardly out of place. The monastery is beautiful though! It’s in a remote, forested spot surrounded by mountains and would have been lovely to visit on a quiet day."
