Kutjevo cellar is one of the oldest wine cellars in South East Europe. Through centuries of dedication, refinement, devotion and passion we have learnt to extract the very best from our wines. KUTJEVO has now become a potent symbol of both Croatian wine and culture. Today, about 1.000 ha of modern vineyards have been spread on the southern slopes of archaic mountains Papuk and Krndija, of rolling middle Slavonia, at 200-350 m height above sea level. The varieties are modern, European and have an excellent genetic potential. The quality of KUTJEVO is clear from our numerous gold medals and awards - from Wine Fairs in Zagreb and Split to the prestigious Concours Mondial de Bruxelles in Belgium where the KUTJEVO cellar won the gold medal last year and repeat this success also this year. Our most popular wine is the crisp refreshing white, Grasevina, but we also produce top quality Rhenish Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Noir, Grey Pinot, Sauvignon, Tramine and Merlot.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.kutjevo.com/\n\nExternal link for Kutjevo d.d.\n\nIndustry\n\nBeverage Manufacturing\n\nCompany size\n\n501-1,000 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nKutjevo\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n1963\n\nSpecialties\n\nproduction and distribution of agricultural and nutritional products and wine production"
