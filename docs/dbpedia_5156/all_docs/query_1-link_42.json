        "text": "Jane Staples - Certified Sommelier rated this wine as 90/100 with the following review:\n\nWhite fruit aromas(apple) with lemon and slight herbal notes Dry on palate with excellent acidity. Pair with shellfish or Chicken Alfredo. Excellent value.\n\nLook for this one in LCBO Vintages in March 2019.Wineboy rated this wine as 90/100 with the following review:\n\nA bit of sulphur but this blew off quickly. Softer nose of citrus and tree fruits. While quite full flavours replayed on the palate. A great kiss of sweetness to balance the acidity and keep the flavours long and pure.Andrea Shapiro rated this wine as 90/100 with the following review:\n\nLooking for something new to try from a lesser known wine region? - Grasevina. This grape is known by many other names, such as Welschriesling, Ryzlink and Olasz Rizling. This was a grown in ancient volcanic soil from an old world winery. A beautiful fruit forward mineral driven fresh white wine from Kutjevo. Located in Slavonia, Croatia - this fascinating grape variety and wine has hints of golden apples, pear skins and delicate ashy salt driven mouth watering minerals. An awesome pairing with fresh grilled octopus, fish and local cheeses. Unique and refreshing. 90 points - tasted at the Kutjevo winery November 2018Greg Hughes rated this wine as 89/100 with the following review:\n\nGrasevina, or Welschriesling, is a wonderful grape that is starting to be appreciated for its quality.\n\nIn eastern Europe (Croatia, Macedonia etc...) It can make very zesty, tropical wines with a great pricepoint.\n\nThis wine is a nice light lemon colour.\n\nThe aromas remind one a bit of Trebbiano di Soave, but woth a slightly more pronounced herbaceous character.\n\nAromas of grapefruit, lime and zest, chamomile, honeysuckle, and almond.\n\nThe flavours are fresh. Lots more citrus and zestiness. More gentle acidity than the aromas suggest.\n\nPair with scallops and a fresh salad woth tahini.Neil Phillips rated this wine as 89/100 with the following review:\n\nYou don't see a lot of Croatian wine in our crowded market - but with value gems like this, I expect that may change.\n\nOn the nose, bruised apple, lemon curd, acacia, hint of vanilla.\n\nApple and woodsy notes on the palate, gooseberry and yellow raspberry chutney, viscous mouthfeel. Fair amount of structure, nice acidity. Bitter almond and saline finish. (Ideal with food - French onion soup or goat cheese salad with lardons comes to mind.)\n\nGreat value.\n\nTasted April 2019.Courtney Flood rated this wine as 88/100 with the following review:\n\nFor an interesting alternative to your plain-Jane Italian pinot grigio, try this Croatian white. Yellow apple, lemon, bitter lemon pith, and herbal tarragon, and a touch of creaminess, Would pair with cacio e pepe, goat cheese-arugula salad."
