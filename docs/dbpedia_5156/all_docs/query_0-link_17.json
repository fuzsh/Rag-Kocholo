        "text": "We left our hotel in Belgrade at 8:00 that morning to head out to Zagreb.\n\nZagreb is the capital of Croatia. It is a center for government and industry. Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet here, making the area the center of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia, and a hub for transportation in the country.\n\nThis was going to be one of the long drives of the tour. The only real stop for tourism along the way was at a winery.\n\nIt did not take long to leave the city. We were heading towards western Serbia. It was a work day in the city.\n\nSoon we were driving past fields and plains. We drove past an old Roman settlement. The current town of Sremska Mitrovica used to be one of the capitals in the Roman Empire. It used to be called Sirmium. (The empire of Rome was split by Emperor Diocletian at one point into four jurisdictions managed by four tetrarchs.) The town used to be a stop on the tour in the past, but no longer is. Perhaps it takes up too much time to properly explore the space.\n\nConstantine was born in Serbia. Serbia gave the world 18 Roman emperors.\n\nWe took a break at a rest stop just before we got out of Serbia.\n\nAs we approached the border, we started passing a long line of trucks next to the road. They were basically parked on one of the two lanes. The line stretched a few miles long. It takes a lot of time for the trucks to cross the border because Serbia is not part of Schengen nations. Each of the trucks needs to be checked. These trucks are apparently transporting goods from Serbia and Turkey. We were told that it could sometimes take days for them to cross. This is a major bother, and a bigger concern if the trucks carry perishable items that needs to be kept refrigerated.\n\nThis was going to be our first border crossing in a Gate1 tour, and it happened to be on a bus! Apparently, procedures for the passengers at this border can be fluid and unpredictable. One could not predict exactly how the bus and its passengers would be checked, and how long the process would take. This time a young Serbian Immigration officer came on board the bus to collect our passports. (Apparently, the tour managers were sometimes told to collect the passports.) He returned quickly with the stamped passports.\n\nThere was a separate stop the for Customs check. We did not have to get out of the bus, and the stop here was quick.\n\nThe next stop was Croatian Immigration. We stepped out of the bus and into a building to get our passports stamped. It was also a quick process.\n\nThere was a line of trucks on the other side of the border waiting to cross into Serbia. The line was shorter than the one waiting to leave Serbia.\n\n(Recap of history of this region: We were told that the place was inhabited first in 1100 BC by the Illyrians. (But they have also found some Neanderthal skeletal remains in a place called Krapina.) Around 230 BC, Princess Teuta apparently invited Romans to keep the Greeks away. They stayed for 800 years! This included the time of the Byzantine empire. Then came the Slavs and the Ottomans. Croatia separated from Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It joined the EU in 2013, and the Schengen and Eurozone in 2023.)\n\nThe regions of Croatia include Istria in the north (influenced by Italy and Austria), Zagreb (or Central Croatia), Dalmatia (Roman influenced) and Slavonia (Austro-Hungarian influence). We had entered Croatia in the region of Slavonia.\n\nThe highway to Zagreb runs near the Bosnian border in this region. This is a picture of the countryside we were passing.\n\nWe got off the highway and continued our drive to the winery on country roads.\n\nSlavonia is an agricultural area, and is the breadbasket of Croatia. There is no heavy industry. There is no pollution. The region produces a lot of fruits and dairy products. Honey is produced. They have free range chicken. Houses will advertise that they are selling jaja – eggs! A very high proportion of the families own tractors. This is also the region of wineries. Rakia and wine are also produced in the homes. Lipizzaner horses are bred in Slavonia. They follow the patriarchal model of life and have joint families.\n\nWe heard about the music of Slavonia, and also heard some of it, on the bus. Bećarac music is listed as an UNESCO-intangible cultural heritage. It is humorous music and mainly sung by men. It is influenced by Hungarian music. The tamburica is a regional musical instrument. Songs of romance are popular. Mira recommended our coming back for a well known regional music festival.\n\nAs we were passing some woods, we were told that Slavonian oak was used for making barrels for the wineries since they are less expensive. They apparently also have a good reputation.\n\nThe winery we stopped at was in Kutjevo village. It is called the Krauthaker Winery. It is one of the biggest private wineries in Croatia. Our guide for the tour of the winery was a gentleman named Drajen (not completely sure that I spelt that correctly). He is the sommelier. He gets to sample all the wines regularly, and also with the visitors. What a job!\n\nThe winery overlooks the Golden Valley.\n\nThe winery was established in 1992. It is a young winery. They produce 700,000 liters of wine annually today. They have three different locations, 35 labels, and use 44 different varieties of grapes.\n\nWe got to sample multiple wines while Drajen spoke to us about the nature of these wines. We were given some platters of bite size food to go with our wine. (It has been emphasized to me that it is not good to drink on an empty stomach.☺️).\n\nThe food was made by Drajen and he was proud of it. Pumpkin seed oil was used in the hummus. Apparently this is significant because pumpkin oil is very difficult to extract. The bread was made in clay oven.\n\nAs a part of the wine tasting process, we were given instructions to not try to finish the wines we did not like. There were metal containers that were placed on the table to allow us to empty any leftover wine into, so that the next sample could be poured into the glass. I only know that I did not throw out any wine!\n\nWe had the following wines: Julija sparkling wine, Grasevina Italian Reisling, Pinot sivi, Sauvignon Vidim, Chardonnay Rosenberg, Blauburger (our first red wine – with 14% alcohol), Mercs (a red blend of Merlot of Cabernet) and Mustra (a sweet wine). They all had distinctive tastes.\n\nAbout the wine making process – Vineyards are typically on the hillsides. 10% of Croatian wines are produced in the area around Kutjevo. The primary market for the wines is Croatia. If production suffers, exports are reduced.\n\nDifferent grapes are harvested at different times during the season. They take 45 days to harvest all their grapes. The grapes are picked by hand. 12% of the grapes today are red grapes. Red wine is stored in wooden barrels and the white wines mainly in metal barrels. Red wine includes skin in the fermentation process. Drajen told us about the processes for creating sweet wines, and wines of different alcohol levels.\n\nHe noted that Shiraz is one of the oldest varieties of wine. It is good for mixed wines for adding color. Another fact noted was that one has to be careful when making fruit wines. Methanol, or methyl alcohol, a poison, can be generated in varying concentrations as a part of the process.\n\nThere was a rush for the rest room after this activity, after which we got to visit the storage area for the wines, the place in which they were aged in barrels, and also do some shopping if we were so inclined.\n\nTeresa offered folks some of the snacks that we had taken with us. I noticed Drajen partaking from the bag more than once. I thought that he definitely could have used the food in his stomach after all his “sampling”. It seemed to me that he was getting more and more animated, and perhaps a little red faced, as he was going through his long presentation earlier, although he never lost his place, and even manned the wine store afterwards! I wondered how he kept up with the pace of his job, especially the sampling of the wines. The word on the bus from Mira was that he does have regular medical checkups, and all is well!\n\nThe rest of the drive to Zagreb was uneventful, except for the need for a pit stop because of all the wine that had been consumed. This time, I was the one who had to declare the emergency. I tried to do it quietly, but my effort was partially thwarted by Mira – she was not looking at her messages on her mobile phone. I had to stagger up to the front of the fast moving bus to pass on my message.\n\nIt was interesting to see a Croatian Railroad train during this part of the ride. The trainset is the HŽ 7023. They came into service during the last decade.\n\nWe arrived in Zagreb soon after. What was noticeable to me were the tram lines running on all the major roads. All of the trams were a shade of blue that caught your attention, and these trams were running quite frequently. There were also trams from so many different generations sharing the lines. I think I would have appreciated seeing something like this even more when I was a kid, but the curiosity still exists! I could not get a good picture that evening because I was on the wrong side of the bus!\n\nRush hour traffic was quite heavy in the city. We arrived at the Zagreb Sheraton soon after. It turned out to be an older facility that had undergone renovation to get in newer features..\n\nDinner was in the hotel itself. We got a chance to meet up with the rest of our group. We retired to our rooms soon after dinner.\n\n*****************\n\nWe had received a lot more information as we were leaving Belgrade and Serbia that morning. These are from my notes:\n\nSerbia has negative birth rate. Steps have been taken to encourage larger families. Woman get one year of maternity leave, mostly paid for by the government. There are also many cheap government kindergartens.\n\nChildren in Serbia learn Cyrillic first and then English.\n\nThe government spends money on infrastructure, including hospitals. There is corruption in the medical field even though medical services are supposed to be free. Doctors expect more money to provide a better quality of care. Nurses are not paid well – even waitresses get a better income.\n\nThere are new occupational opportunities in Serbia. Call centers are being set up in the country. Digital nomads also come to Serbia to work.\n\nMira recommended a couple of Serbian movies – Underground and Black cats and white cats. The movies are by Emir Kusturica, a reknown Serbian Director. His movies appear to focus on life of the common man in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSerbian people are said to be good neighbors and socialize with each other. It is different in countries like Croatia and Slovenia. Serbians are curious about each other – they want to know how much you earn. They are gossipy people in general!\n\nWeddings in Serbia: Weddings are big, especially in the countryside. The whole community is invited. A member of the family goes round with a wooden flask of Rakia to share with people. Before 1846, you could buy the bride. Now there are just ceremonial gestures in this regard. You apparently also had to fill the woman’s shoe with money until the shoe fits before your proposal was accepted. There is also the shooting of an apple involved before the wedding! Weddings happen in the church. Everything is done three times including exchange of rings. First steps of the young couple includes walking under the table. (I have not seen any online confirmation on this one!) The best man throws coins into the crowd at the end of a wedding! Live musicians are important at weddings. The music is lively. Watch this dance video from a wedding in Serbia. I believe the dance is called the Kolo. People used to give gifts like cattle, barbecue, etc. Today they give money.\n\nDivorce rates in Serbia are high. Drazn said it is 33%.\n\nSerb and Croatian foods: There are different spices and flavors in the different regions. Serbs (and eastern Balkans) use a lot more onions and garlic than Croatians. There is more of the influence of spices from the Ottomans in Serbia. Serbs use sunflower oil. Croats use olive oil (more Mediterranean influenced). Foods from both regions are considered light. Carp is popular in Serbia. Squid is popular in Dalmatia in Croatia. Black risotto is from Croatia. Strukli is the local pastry from Zagreb. Apple strudels and dumplings are popular in Slovenia. In East Serbia they eat more roasted meat. Croatia has more fish and cheese .\n\nMira expressed the opinion that it is not likely that Serbia will convert to the Eurozone any time soon. Also, that there is still general propaganda from Russia these days that western values and ways are bad. Older people tend to believe this propaganda. Mira claims that Serbia is and was better off than other Eastern European countries – foreign goods, music, etc., were always available in Yugoslavia but not in some other Balkan countries."
