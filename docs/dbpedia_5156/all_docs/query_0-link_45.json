        "text": "Did you know...\n\nWines shrouded in an ancient mystery\n\nCroatian wines are one of the best kept secrets among wine lovers. Wine production in Croatia dates back to the 5th century BC, to the famous Croatian wine region of Baranja.\n\nBaranja was called \"Vallis Aurea\" (Golden Valley) by the ancient Romans because it was home to the golden drops they liked so much.\n\nDid you know...\n\nZinfandel & Primitivo are from Croatia\n\nThe grapes that Americans call Zinfandel and Italians call Primitivo are also Crljenak Kaštelanski. After many years of scientific research, the words that Zinfandel comes from the origin and Plavac Mali are his offspring.\n\nDid you know...\n\nGraševina\n\nIt is one of the most popular white grapes in Croatia, widely considered to be indigenous. When you order house wine in Croatia, you can be sure that you will get Grasevine or Malvazje.\n\nGraševina is a dry, fresh, aromatic white wine with hints of apple."
