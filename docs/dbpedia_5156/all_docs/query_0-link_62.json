Under Ottoman rule, the religious order was dissolved and the ecclesiastical buildings were subsequently destroyed.\n\nThe Jesuits settle down in the 18th century and rebuilt an abbey on the ruins of the former monastery. They also continued the production of wine in the fields next to the Abbey. Not long after the Abbey became a manor house.\n\nOver the 20th century, the building changed owners many times. Due to this, the original structure was also altered throughout the century. The monastery church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the only original building still standing today."
