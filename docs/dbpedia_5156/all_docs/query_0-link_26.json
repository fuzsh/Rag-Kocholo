        "text": "Classification: Weyland Spring bottling plant | Boom or bust rim colony\n\nLocation: LV-686 (Dykuma I)\n\nPopulation: ~2700\n\nBottled fresh daily!\n\nHistory\n\nKutjevo Refinery (also known as Kutjevo bottling plant / facility, and Weyland Spring bottling center No. 8) was a human water refinement and bottling facility operated and owned by the Weyland-Yutani corporation on the planet LV-686. Kutjevo was originally established as an independent extension of the GL1 Starview core world colony in 2160. Dykuma I, originally thought to be a terra-formable desert world, was found to feature a vibrant ecosystem that fed off of a network of potable aquifers. The colony administration experienced a hostile corporate takeover by members of the Canadian Space Affairs Ministry in 2162, and was sold in December of that year to the Weyland-Yutani corporation.\n\nBottling operations for the Weyland Spring brand began in 2165. Subsequently the refinery and surrounding colony housing exploded due to the reversal of the employment dearth in the outer American Corridor, which drew in a large swathe of rim colonists.\n\nCurrently Kutjevo houses over 2000 colonists and is a prime candidate for entry into the United American sphere of influence as a recognized terrestrial body. Of those 2000 colonists, around 70% are employed by the Company, with the rest working in adjacent supporting labor sectors.\n\nLV-686\n\nLV-686 is a terrestrial world located in the Dykuma system just 14ly from the American Corridor. The Dykuma system is composed of Dykuma I (LV-686), ‘Dykuma’ an A6 IV White Subgiant, and its smaller unnamed M1 V Red Dwarf companion.\n\nDiscovered in late 2089, just months after Waypoint Station was christened by the UA, Dykuma would not be colonized until 2158, and later would declare alignment with the independents in 2160. Dykuma’s star and namesake is 25 times brighter than that of the Sun. Dykuma I features a relatively common iron/silicate core and gravity only .05% greater than that of Earth’s, making it very appealing for settlement.\n\nDykuma I has three moons in orbit, A, B, and C respectively. Dykuma IC is commonly known as ‘The Chariot’ due to its anomalous and incredibly rapid orbit, passing around Dykuma I in merely one and a half Earth weeks. The other two moons are far less exciting, with orbital periods of 1 and 2.3 Earth months respectively.\n\nThe Kutjevo complex is located in the Hangelkesk basin. The area having been named after the creator of the first lander to breach the planet’s atmosphere. The complex itself is broken down into various components, only the outermost areas actually doing any of the water pumping or filtering. The central and initial aquafers long dried up.\n\nTrivia\n\nKutjevo Refinery’s initial concept was a combination of Trijent Dam and Sidewinder, from Halo: CE.\n\nKutjevo Refinery was originally named Camp Sibilliad, a USCM boot camp.\n\nThe colony walls, platforms, floor tiles, and rock walls all use the same 6 color palette.\n\nKutjevo was originally snowy, owing both to the aforementioned Sidewinder, and that the same code used to handle Ice Colony’s snow turfs is also used to handle Kutjevo’s sand.\n\nThe code that Ice Colony’s snow turfs originally ran on are suspected to be a Byond forums code sample."
