        "text": "WINERY KUTJEVO 1232\n\nSymbol of Croatian wine culture\n\nA hallmark of Croatian wine culture, Winery Kutjevo, established in 1232, is the region's most venerable and lauded winery. It has been producing high-quality wines that capture the distinctive essence of the Kutjevo terroir for centuries.\n\nFor generations, the Kutjevo winery and its cellars have been synonymous with the Croatian wine tradition. With a heritage stretching back to 1232, this distinguished winery from the region is renowned for creating wines that distinctively reflect the extraordinary qualities of the local terroir.\n\nPlace from which our vines draw their identity\n\nOur vines have taken root so deeply in this unique terroir that they can reach and wake up the unknown parts of your palate.\n\nCLIMATE AND POSITION\n\nSunny side of Papuk\n\nVineyards are planted on the southern slopes of Papuk, surrounded by forests, exposed to the sun and constant air flow, which significantly affects the quality of grapes.\n\nClusters of pure pleasure\n\nWines from the best Kutjevo micro-locations carry recognizable notes. Grapes for premium labels are ideal for long storage on the vine. These are mostly late or ice harvests. On Hrnjevac, due to the emphasized airiness, but also the great number of the sunny hours, there is a strong concentration of aromas in the berries. The grapes in these positions achieve an ideal balance of sugars and acids, and create the preconditions for the production of premium quality wine labels."
