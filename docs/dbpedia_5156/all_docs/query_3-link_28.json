        "text": "The origin of the Welschriesling is still nebulous. It is certain that it is not related to Riesling (Rheinriesling). A genetic similarity seems to exist with the grape variety Elbling from the Moselle river. The Welschriesling is spread mainly in Eastern Europe, starting from the Austrian Burgenland and Northern Italy, it is actually cultivated in all cultivating countries east to Romania. Therefore the variety also has a variety of synonyms: Olaszrizling (Hungary), La≈°ki Rizling (Slovenia), Grasevina (Croatia) or Riesling Italico (Italy) to name a few.\n\nJust as numerous as its names, are the wine styles produced from Welschriesling. In Austria it is customary to produce rather neutral, light and crisp dry white wines from it, as well as in the Burgenland also noble sweet specialties, while in Croatia it is processed to medium-weight to sometimes extraordinarily rich white wines. It is suitable for cultivation in low-rain zones, since it requires little water.\n\nThese wines contain Welschriesling:"
