Vines were grown here as early as the time of the ancient Romans. Since 1232, with the construction of the wine cellars of the Cistercian monastery in Kutjevo, top wines have been produced. Specific natural conditions made it possible for the Graševina and Riesling wine varieties to produce excellent white wines. Kutjevo is part of Požega's \"Golden Valley\". In the heart of the Papuk Nature Park is the Jankovac Forest Park, which is the most famous mountain excursion site in Slavonia, with lakes and waterfalls reminiscent of a smaller version of the Plitvice Lakes."
