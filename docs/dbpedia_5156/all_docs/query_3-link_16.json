International\n\nSource: http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/005/2004/en/df4d5196-\n\nd54c-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652/eur640052004en.html\n\nCroatia\n\nA shadow on Croatia's future: Continuing impunity for war crimes and crimes\n\nagainst humanity\n\n[…]\n\nImpunity for unlawful killings and extrajudicial executions allegedly committed by members of the\n\nCroatian Army and police forces\n\nA considerable number of trials for war crimes and crimes against humanity have been held before Croatian\n\ncourts over the past few years and the Croatian judiciary continues to actively investigate and prosecute war-time\n\nhuman rights violations. However, in the vast majority of cases, criminal proceedings have been initiated only\n\nwhen victims of such crimes were ethnic Croats.\n\nAmnesty International welcomes the stated commitment of the Croatian authorities to tackle impunity for war\n\ncrimes through full cooperation with the Tribunal and through criminal proceedings instituted before Croatian\n\ncourts. Moreover, Amnesty International notes that in 2003 the Rijeka County Court issued the first domestic\n\nconvictions for war crimes of relatively high-level perpetrators of war-related human rights violations committed\n\nagainst members of the Croatian Serb communities.(28) Amnesty International also notes that the Croatian\n\nSupreme Court has played an increasingly positive role in addressing some of the shortcomings in trials for war\n\ncrimes and crimes against humanity conducted before lowe r level courts.(29) However, Amnesty International\n\nremains concerned that the Croatian authorities overwhel mingly failed to address crimes allegedly committed by\n\nmembers of the Croatian Army and police forces against the Croatian Serb population and that most of the\n\nperpetrators have continued to enjoy impunity for their crimes.\n\nIn June 2004 the UN Committee against Torture (CAT) issued its Conclusions and Recommendations, after\n\nhaving examined Croatia's third periodic report on measures taken by Croatia to give effect to the rights enshrined\n\nin the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.(30) The\n\nCAT expressed concern at the \"reported failure of the State party to carry out prompt, impartial and full\n\ninvestigations, to prosecute the perpetrators and to provide fair and adequate compensation to the victims [of\n\ntorture and ill-treatment which occurred during the conflict ]\", at \"[a]llegations that double standards were applied\n\nat all stages of the proceedings against Serb defendants an d in favour of Croat defendants in war crime trials\" as\n\nwell as at \"[t]he reported harassment, intimidation and threats faced by witnesses and victims testifying in\n\nproceedings and the lack of adequate protection from the State party\".(31) The CAT recommended, inter alia, that\n\nthe Croatian authorities \"[t]ake effective measures to ensure impartial, full and prompt investigations into all\n\nallegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the prosecution and punishment of the\n\nperpetrators as appropriate and irrespective of their ethnic origin, and the provision of fair and adequate\n\ncompensation for the victims\".(32) A recent OSCE report on domestic war crimes trials in Croatia noted that \"the\n\nnational origin of defendants and possibly even more important ly that of victims continued to affect war crimes\n\nproceedings in 2003\".(33) According to statistical data compiled by the OSCE Mission to Croatia,(34) in 2003 19\n\nof 20 people arrested, 137 of 148 under investigation, thre e of three indicted, 83 of 102 on trial, and 10 of 12\n\npeople convicted were ethnic Serbs.(35) The total number of ethnic Croats arrested, indicted and put on trial for\n\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity decreased from 2002 to 2003.(36)\n\nIn a few cases, investigations into violations committed against members of the Croatian Serb communities were\n\nlaunched during the armed conflict, or soon afterwards, and the trials that followed were conducted in a politically\n\ncharged atmosphere which was not conducive to the fair adm inistration of justice. Croatian Serbs Mihajlo Zec, his\n\nwife Marija and his 12-year-old daughter Aleksandra were killed in Zagreb in December 1991, allegedly by\n\nmembers of the Croatian police.(37) In 1992 the suspected perpetrators of the murder were acquitted by the\n\nZagreb County Court reportedly because their confessions were considered to be inadmissible in court since they\n\nwere made to the investigative judge in the absence of their legal representatives.(38) Reportedly, during the\n\nproceedings the court was subjected to strong political pressure.(39) In 1994, the ninth periodic report on the\n\nsituation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia by the Special Rapporteur of the UN\n\nCommission on Human Rights noted that \"[i]ndependence and impartiality in the administration of justice\n\n335constitute one of the basic foundations of effective protection of human rights\"(40) and quoted the unresolved\n\nmurder of members of the Zec family as a case which \"casts serious doubts on measures taken to ensure such a\n\nsystem in Croatia\".(41) The report in particular stated:\n\n\"In December 1991, Mr. and Mrs. Zec and their 12- year-old daughter were murdered in Zagreb and\n\nseveral days later five persons were arrested as alleged perpetrators of the crime. According to reliable\n\nsources, four of the suspects were members of a special police unit. The five admitted having committed\n\nthe murders; however, they were released soon after their arrest for procedural reasons, and have never\n\nbeen punished\".(42)\n\nIn April 2004 the Croatian authorities pledged to pay compensation amounting to approximately 200,000 Euros to\n\nthe two surviving members of the Zec family and the Croatian Prime Minister has reportedly recently stated that\n\nthe murder of members of the Zec family must be solved. However, the perpetrators of this crime continue to\n\nenjoy impunity.\n\nThe intimidation of witnesses,(43) as well as the tribunals' perceived or actual lack of impartiality, have often been\n\nserious obstacles to the delivery of justice also in re cent trials for crimes committed against members of the\n\nCroatian Serb communities. The \"Lora\" trial against eight former members of the Croatian Military Police, held at\n\nthe Split County Court in 2002, is a case in point. The suspects, accused of having tortured non-Croat civilians\n\nand of having murdered two of them in Split's Lora military prison in 1992, were reportedly welcomed by loud\n\napplause from the public at the start of the trial.(44) It wa s reported that, during the trial, the president of the panel\n\nof judges repeatedly addressed the accused by their first names and shook their hands when they entered the\n\ncourtroom.(45) Moreover, the presiding judge reportedly appeared to mock a statement made by one of the\n\nwitnesses who claimed he had been tortured in the Lora prison.(46) Widespread witness harassment and\n\nintimidation was also reported and several prosecution witnesses heard by the court retracted the detailed\n\nstatements they had made during the criminal investigati on into human rights violations in Lora prison. Many of\n\nthe witnesses were former detainees who suffered human ri ghts violations, or former prison guards. The \"Lora\"\n\ntrial ended with the acquittal of all the accused in No vember 2002.(47) In August 2004 the Croatian Supreme\n\nCourt overturned the verdict ruling that the Split County Court had incorrectly and incompletely established the\n\nfacts and ordered a retrial of the suspects before a new panel of judges.(48) A new trial is reportedly expected to\n\nbegin in January 2005.\n\nIn another high profile case, a former member of the Croatian special police forces was twice acquitted by the\n\nKarlovac County Court of charges of having killed 13 disarmed JNA reservists in 1991, by firing bursts from his\n\nmachine gun. The accused was first acquitted in 1992 and the Croatian Supreme Court overturned the verdict in\n\n1993. The retrial, which started in 2000, was completed after various delays in 2003. Also in this case the\n\nproceedings, which were reportedly accompanied by pub lic demonstrations of support for the defendant,(49)\n\nended with an acquittal. The Karlovac court reportedly ruled that the accused acted in \"self-defence\". The\n\nCroatian Supreme Court overturned the verdict, ruling that, in the trial, facts had been incorrectly established.(50)\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered the suspect's retrial for the third time in March 2004. The retrial before the Karlovac\n\nCounty Court began in September 2004.\n\nInformation on crimes against the Croatian Serb population in and around Sisak,(51) a town in central Croatia\n\nsituated approximately 50 km southeast of Zagreb, became available in the early phase of the armed conflict. In\n\nseveral cases, the suspected perpetrators were members of the Croatian Army or police forces. Between 1991\n\nand 1992 Croatian Serbs in Sisak and in the surrounding area became victims of a campaign of killings,\n\nabductions, \"disappearances\", assaults and threats. In No vember 1991 Amnesty International reported that \"[u]p\n\nto 21 Serbian villagers are said to have been killed on 22 August [1991] in the villages of Kinjacka, Cakle and\n\nTrnjani near Sisak when Croatian security forces undertook a house-to-house search for Serbian paramilitaries\n\nwho had fired mortars at the town of Sisak\".(52) In a report published in March 1992, Amnesty International\n\nprovided information on the killing of 12 Croatian Serbs in Sisak,(53) some of whom had been employed in the\n\nINA oil refinery.\n\nThis report documents further examples of impunity for human rights violations committed in Sisak during the\n\narmed conflict. Crimes committed in Sisak, relatively little known outside of Croatia, were chosen as illustrative\n\nexamples of a widespread pattern of violations committed against the civilian population allegedly by members of\n\nthe Croatian Army and police forces. To Amnesty International's knowledge, in no cases have these crimes\n\nresulted in a conviction. Some of those who may have directly committed, ordered or tolerated these crimes, or\n\nmay have participated in their subsequent cover-up, remain in powerful positions at the local level of state\n\ninstitutions or in the police and are thus still in a position to undermine the investigation of these crimes.\n\nThe climate of intimidation against Croatian Serbs, and in general, those suspected of not supporting Croatian\n\nindependence, which was prevailing in Sisak already at the start of the conflict, is illustrated by the publication on\n\n29 June 1991, in the Croatian tabloid Slobodni Tjednik,of a list of 14 Sisak residents. The list included the names\n\nand, in some cases, the addresses and telephone numbers of alleged \"enemy collaborators\" and members of the\n\nYugoslav military intelligence ( Kontraobaveštajna Služba – KOS). Jovo Crnobrnja, a retired police officer from\n\nSisak and one of the Croatian Serbs named in the Slobodni Tjedniklist, was reportedly killed on 27 August 1991\n\nby armed men in uniform who attacked him in his house.\n\n336On the evening of 22 August 1991 Croatian Serb Miljenko Ðapa, a worker at the Sisak oil refinery, was arrested\n\nby armed men in his home.(54) Miljenko Ðapa's mother, in the days following his arrest, tried to obtain information\n\non the fate and whereabouts of her son, addressing the Croatian police and military authorities. However, for\n\nseveral days she was kept in the dark about her son's fate and she reported having been intimidated by members\n\nof the Croatian police, who alleged that her son was a \"spy\". On 29 August she was informed by the police\n\nauthorities that Miljenko Ðapa's body had been found near the village of Èigoè, approximately 20 km from Sisak.\n\nReportedly, Miljenko Ðapa died as a result of gunshot wounds. The Croatian authorities failed to thoroughly\n\ninvestigate this crime, whose perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity.\n\nOn 13 September 1991 the family home of Croatian Serb Damjan Žiliæ in the small town of Petrinja was\n\nbombarded with machine guns and hand grenades, allegedly by members of the Croatian Army. Damjan Žiliæ,\n\naged 52, a chemical engineer and chief of production at the INA oil refinery in Sisak, was not injured, but the\n\nhouse was considerably damaged. Although he was not a member of any political party, and had signed an oath\n\nof loyalty to the Republic of Croatia, he was aware of hostility at his place of work, apparently based on his\n\nnationality (the security guards had on a number of occasi ons refused him entry to the premises). After the attack\n\non their home, he and his wife (an ethnic Croat) moved to Zagreb. On 23 November 1991 he was abducted from\n\noutside his home in Novi Zagreb. Reportedly, he was killed by blows to the head and his body was thrown in the\n\nSava River.(55) On 7 December four reservists of the Croatian Army, two of whom had been employed at the INA\n\nrefinery, were arrested and charged with his murder. Their trial began on 20 February 1992. It is reported that a\n\nlarge group of Croatian Army soldiers were present in the court building and shouted abuse and threats at\n\nDamjan Žiliæ's wife and daughter.(56) The president of the court reportedly suspended proceedings, after\n\ndeclaring that she had received death threats and that in these circumstances it was not appropriate to try the\n\ncase in a civilian court. Reportedly, the four were amnestied in 1993.\n\nCroatian Serb Petar Pajagiæ, employed in the Sisak oil refinery as the head of the control unit, was killed\n\nfollowing his arrest, in September 1991. Reportedly, after having had lunch with his daughter, on 20 September\n\n1991 Petar Pajagiæ left her house, walked to his nearby fl at,(57) where he was later arrested by three men in\n\npolice uniform.(58) Following his arrest, the family was unable to obtain information on Petar Pjagiæ's fate and\n\nwhereabouts. There are indications that in the case of Petar Pajagiæ, and possibly of other Croatian Serbs killed\n\nand \"disappeared\" in Sisak, the perpetrators may have acted chiefly in pursuit of their individual interest, taking\n\nadvantage of the ongoing campaign of intimidation against Croatian Serbs and of the impunity for crimes against\n\nmembers of these communities. Reportedly, Petar Pajagiæ's position in the refinery was occupied by another\n\nperson immediately on the first working day which follow ed his \"disappearance\". Moreover, four days after the\n\n\"disappearance\" of Petar Pajagiæ, his flat, to which he had tenancy rights, was occupied by another person.(59)\n\nThe body of Petar Pajagiæ was found in 2002 in the Danube river near Novi Sad, in the territory of the then\n\nFRY.(60) The identification was reportedly co nducted at the Military Medical Academy ( Vojnomedicinska\n\nAkademija)in Belgrade (FRY). Reportedly, the settlement request(61) filed by Petar Pajagiæ's daughter Diana\n\nPajagiæ was rejected in 2004 by the State Attorney, inter alia, on the grounds that the documents issued by the\n\nSerbian authorities related to the identification conducted in Belgrade were not recognized as evidence of the\n\nvictim's death.(62) Moreover, after Diana Pajagiæ's stat ements to the Croatian press on impunity for the murder\n\nof her father, she reported that she was on several occasions subjected to intimidation and anonymous threats.\n\nOn 17 September 1991 19-year-old student Ljubica Solar was killed in her boyfriend's flat in Sisak by a bullet fired\n\nfrom outside the building.(63) Ljubica Solar was the daught er of an ethnic Croat mother and of a Croatian Serb\n\nfather, and her boyfriend, Duško Maloviæ, was a former JNA soldier.(64) Ljubica Solar's mother, Vjera, has\n\nrepeatedly addressed the Croatian authorities demanding a thorough investigation into her daughter's killing and\n\nthat the perpetrators be brought to justice. Repor tedly, in 2001 a former member of the \"Wolves\" ( Vukovi), a\n\nspecial police unit, stated to the investigating judge in Sisak that the perpetrators of the killing of Ljubica Solar\n\nwere former members of his unit.(65) The Croatian authoritie s are reportedly still investigating this crime and so\n\nfar, to Amnesty International's knowledge, no one has been indicted in connection with the murder of Ljubica\n\nSolar. Moreover, Vjera Solar's settlement request was rejected, apparently because criminal proceedings in her\n\ndaughter's murder have not been completed.\n\nIn the past years Vjera Solar has brought to the attention of the Croatian public her daughter's unresolved murder.\n\nShe has also founded the Civic Association against Violence ( Graðanska udruga protiv nasilja ) to raise\n\nawareness and collect data on crimes allegedly committed by members of the Croatian army and police forces,\n\nmostly against Croatian Serbs. To date, Vjera Solar has gathered information on approximately 115 people,\n\nmostly members of Croatian Serb communities, killed or \"disappeared\" in and around Sisak. In July 2002, the\n\nCroatian magazine Hrvatska ljevicapublished a dossier on war crimes in Sisak, as well as a list of 107 names of\n\nvictims of killings or \"disappearances\", the majority of which occurred during the second half of 1991.\n\nIn June 2003 two former Croatian police officers were arrested and charged with having killed a Croatian Serb,\n\nNikola Drobnjak,(66) on 5 April 1992, in the village of Blinjski Kut, near Sisak. Reportedly, following the arrest of\n\nthe suspects, a group of former Croatian soldiers, as well as representatives of veterans' organizations, protested\n\nin front of the Sisak County Court building. According to the findings of trial monitoring conducted by the OSCE,\n\nduring the trial supporters of the defendants direct ed comments at prosecution witnesses during their\n\ntestimony.(67) Moreover, the OSCE reported that one of the witnesses stated that he \"was contacted by three\n\n337former high ranking army officials prior to the hearing all of whom inquired into the content of his testimony\".(68)\n\nAccording to the OSCE, the witness reported that one of the former army officials threatened him and his family.\n\nAt the end of the trial, the prosecution amended the indictment by charging the suspects for the killing of an\n\nunidentified person, reportedly because the fact that the body of the victim had remained for 28 days in the Sava\n\nRiver prevented the identification.(69) In June 2004 the defendants were acquitted, reportedly for lack of\n\nevidence.\n\nDespite information on widespread human rights violations against Croatian Serbs in Sisak, which were\n\ndocumented in the Croatian press, as well as by local organizations, the Croatian authorities have failed to bring\n\nthe perpetrators of these crimes to justice. The direct perpetrators of these crimes, as well as officials with chain-\n\nof-command responsibility in the civil and military administration, who may have ordered or tolerated killings and\n\nother human rights violations, continue to enjoy impunity.\n\n338341342343 KN-oIO03/94-99\n\nMINUTES OF WITNESS HEARING\n\ntaken on 19 February 2002 before the investigating magistrate of the First Municipal Court in\n\nBelgrade in the criminal case against unknown persons, for committing the criminal act\n\npunishable under Article 120 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nInvestigating Magistrate\n\ns s e n t i cW i v o r a s e C n a g a r D\n\nc i s o T e c n a l i M\n\nCourt Recorder\n\nJasna Marinkovic\n\nWitness has been cautioned that he/she is bound to tell the truth and not to hold\n\nanything back; he/she has been warned ag\n\ntestimony and that he/she is not bound to answer some of the questions asked if he/she is\n\nlikely to put himself/herself or a close relative to utter disgrace, considerable material\n\ndamage or to be criminally prosecuted; therefore, the witness has given the following\n\nanswers to the general questions posed:\n\n1) Name and surname:\n\n2) Father’s name:\n\n3) Occupation:\n\n4) Address:\n\n5) Place of birth:\n\n6) Year of birth:\n\n7) Relationship to the\n\naccused and injured party:\n\nWitness has been cautioned that he is bound to tell the truth and not to hold anything back; he\n\nhas been warned against the consequences of gi ving false testimony and that he is not bound\n\nto answer some of the questions asked if he is likely to put himself or a close relative to utter\n\ndisgrace, considerable material damage or to be criminally prosecuted, he stated as follows in\n\nreply to the questions asked by the Court:\n\nIn the period 1991-1992, I served my military service in the JNA. Actually, I ended my military\n\nservice in February, but due to the war breaking out, my service was extended by three months.\n\nI did my national duty in Gabela, near Capljina. I guarded a warehouse. As early as 1991, we\n\nhad provocations from members of the then HVO. The warehouse that I guarded was full of\n\nammunition and explosives, which was probably the reason why they had not attacked us\n\nopenly. This installation was handed over by the JNA on 12 April 1992 when it was completely\n\nempty and we, as JNA soldiers, were surrounded by HVO soldiers and regular Croatian Army\n\nwhich was then known as the ZNG. Our captain first class Dusko Gidic, in consultation with\n\nlocal authorities, turned over the installation and we, soldiers, were promised that no one would\n\ndo any harm to us and that they would enable us to return to Yugoslavia.As we left the warehouse, HVO soldiers waited fo r us fully armed, although we had left our\n\narms in the warehouse, which means that we were unarmed. My group numbered 15 soldiers\n\nand 3 officers, and HVO men thre w all of us into a van and drove us to Neum, near Ploce,\n\nwhere they took our particulars and moved us, in the evening, to Split. There, we were\n\ndetained in the Dracevo facility which was us ed by the ZNG military police and, the same\n\nevening, we were transferred to the Lora pr ison in Split. In Dracevac, they again took our\n\nparticulars and we were interrogated by military investigators and were mistreated, beaten,\n\nslapped and done other things by them. The military police, by and large, punched us, and\n\nsome of them I saw both in Dracevac and later in Lora.\n\nIn the Lora prison I was placed in the so-calle d block A, in a cell of approximately 2 by 3\n\nmeters, where the four of us shared the same cell. During the first week or in the first two days,\n\nthe cell was empty; there were no beds or chairs in it; we all slept on a linoleum which covered\n\na concrete floor. For the first two days we sleptwithout a blanket or a mattress, and later on, we\n\nonly got a blanket each. It was only a week or two later that they brought in dunk beds. At first,\n\nthere were four of us with prisoners being changed: some were moved out and others brought\n\nin. Now, after all this ordeal, I can say that I was lucky to have been placed in this cell block\n\nand not in block C where there were prisoners of war – volunteers, as they were referred to by\n\nthe Croats, as well as reservists. I also saw that civilians from Split and environs, who were\n\nSerbs, were also taken there. This prison was, after a while, visited by an ICRC delegation,\n\nwhich was approximately a month after my detent ion, but they had only access to blocks B and\n\nA, while block C was not even mentioned to them by the Croatian side. Therefore, before their\n\narrival, some of the prisoners from block B, pilotsin the first place, had been moved to block C.\n\nThere, at Lora, I was beaten by guards almost every day. In the first month and a half of my stay\n\nthere, I received no decision concerning my detention nor had they instituted any proceedings\n\nagainst me before the Croatian authorities. As regards their beatings of me, I can say that I was\n\nmainly punched and kicked by guards individually, and they punched and kicked me where they\n\npleased. They made me and other prisoners sing Ustasha songs all day and night, and salute the\n\nguards, fascist style, by raising our hand above the head. The guards took particularly morbid\n\npleasure in torturing me and other prisoners by using water hose under high pressure to press me\n\nand others literally up against the wall. On three occasions, I was electrocuted in a room on cell\n\nblock A where I received electric shocks through the inductor of a field telephone when I held the\n\nconductors in my hands. While I was electrocuted, I had to count to 15 in order to see to what\n\nextent I can endure while receiving electric shocks. Sometimes, after receiving the first electric\n\nshock I dropped the wires, so they made me hold them tight, threatening that, unless I did so, they\n\nwould tie the wires to my fingers and put them through my ears. After such electric shocks, I fell\n\ndown and was completely dazed and confused. Nevertheless, they forced me to stand up, while\n\nthey repeated the whole procedure all over again. Those who beat me the most and electrocuted\n\nme were a man of lower built, by the name Andjelko Botic, and one named Ante Gudic. When\n\nthey took us for electrocution, they told us that we had to ring home or ring Milosevic up. Later\n\non, because I was able to go to all cell blocks, I saw that they introduced sophisticated methods of\n\nelectrocution by acquiring potentiometer by which they held in check the intensity of shocks by\n\nstepping on a pedal. During my detention at Lora, its warden Tomo Dujic and his wife, who\n\nfrequently accompanied him, whose name I do not know, also wearing a uniform, participated in\n\nthe torture of prisoners as well. Tomo Dujic himself repeatedly beat me with the baseball bat.\n\nAs I already said, after a month and a half of this torture against me, they stopped, because I\n\nheard that if I applied to them to stay three years, I could later get a passport and leave\n\nCroatia, so I agreed to it in order to avoid any further beatings and mistreatment. After this, I\n\n348was mainly given various physical tasks, ranging from cleaning, washing the dishes to doing\n\nhard physical jobs around the house, such as land raking, cleaning footpaths, lawn mowing\n\nand similar jobs. In particular, I had trouble mowi ng grass and raking land in the field around\n\nLora, which were suspected of being minefields left by the JNA, which was why they actually\n\nused us, as guinea pigs, to survey these fields. I heard, although I cannot confirm it with\n\ncertainty, that one of the prisoners was killed while mowing, as he stepped on a landmine, but\n\nI do not know the name of that man. Neverthe less, I know that Croatian soldiers came there\n\nlater on with detectors which detected some anti-personnel landmines.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, after a month and a half , I was given greater liberty to move around\n\nthe prison so I could see what was going on in other blocks. The treatment of prisoners and\n\ncivilians on cell block C was particularly cruel.\n\nI cleaned toilets on block C more than once and heard that prisoners had been mainly taken\n\nthere for beating and torture. I saw that the toilet was almost, at all times, bloody and I washed\n\nthat blood away. This room was used by Croatian prison guards especially before the visits of\n\nICRC delegates. They concealed prisoners from this block and moved them into another facility\n\ncalled tower, near the prison and towards the docks of the port, before their tour of the prison.\n\nOf all prisoners detained in block C, the followi ng persons were particularly brutally beaten\n\nand ill treated: Luka Adzic, Gavrilo Tripkovi c and his brother Damjan Tripkovic, Jelenko\n\nKovacevic, Gavrilo Kovacevic, Dobrivoje Bojovic, as well as former JNA pilots Milan Micic,\n\nGoran Pantic, Dragan Arsovski and Nikola Derfi. Luka Adzic, whom I saw, was disfigured by\n\nbeating; his ears were swollen and dangled like balls; they also plucked the hairs out of his\n\nbeard; almost all his teeth were broken, because he only had a few teeth in his jaws.Gavrilo\n\nand Damjan Tripkovic had thei r bones broken by beating, while Jelenko and Gavrilo\n\nKovacevic had their jaws broken so that the wires from their dental prosthesis were in full\n\nview. The pilots that I mentioned were also b eaten black and blue and swollen from beating.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no prisoner from block C who had not been, at least once, taken to\n\nhospital for medical treatment . I remember that Vladimir Zarkovic had his earlobes cut\n\nthrough. He was injured in this way while he was electrocuted when they put the wires\n\nthrough his earlobes and he tore the earlobes when he shook his head from electric shocks.\n\nZarkovic and Miroslav Cucak were brutally beat en by the guards, Ante Gudic and Andjelko\n\nBotic, in my presence, several times. A man su rnamed Perisic, also known as Rambo, took\n\npart in those beatings, alongside a man named Zdenko, I presume.\n\nPrisoners from block C were beaten with baseba ll bats and police clubs by guards. The other\n\nprisoners were also beaten in this way, but somewhat less than block C prisoners. The above\n\nmentioned guards often took prisoners to the pr ison grounds where they forced them to lean\n\nagainst the wall with their hands and then they beat them. Some prisoners were tied to the\n\nradiators so that they hung, in a way, and then they beat them, with their arms raised, with\n\nbats and whatever they came across, all over their bodies.\n\nIt is known that ambulance came to the prison when the guards called them after the prisoners had\n\nlost their consciousness from beating. I remember one nurse who was of large build and fair-haired,\n\nwho attended the beaten prisoners and who subsequently beat the other prisoners with a police club.\n\nAlso, while I was in prison, the guards brou ght, on several occasions, some women aged\n\nbetween 17 and 18. I guessed from their behaviour that they were prostitutes.Then they asked\n\nthe prisoners if they wanted to have sex with them. We were all silent , refusing to have any\n\n349relations with such persons. Once they also as ked me the same questi on and, after I had said\n\nthat I did not want to, then the guards beat me up saying that they were not good enough for\n\nme, because they were Croats. After this inci dent, even though the answer was yes to such\n\nrelations, we still were beaten a nd they told us that we were not good enough for these girls,\n\nas Croats. In other words, whatever was the answer, we got the beating all the same.\n\nDuring my detention at Lora, I was aware that three prisoners had been killed. One of them\n\nwas the soldier nicknamed \"White Eagle\". I kno w that he was from Kragujevac and that he\n\nwas very young. He was nicknamed \"White Ea gle\" after they had found the white eagle\n\nemblem in his pocket. He was de tained in block C and was beaten to such an extent that he\n\nwas totally black from bruising on his body. Hi s face was purple and he had sore wounds on\n\nhis legs, that looked like gaping holes that ha d not been bandaged. His cell was all stained\n\nwith blood, faesces and urine. I know this because, on more than one occasion, I brought him\n\nfood myself, but he could not eat and only lay in the far end of the cell and moaned. We could\n\nnot sleep from his screams during the night when they beat him. One day, he simply\n\ndisappeared and I heard from Zarkovic and Mirosl av Cucak that this young fellow had been\n\nkilled in the prison, and that they themselves had made a coffin for him out of ammunition\n\ncases and took it to the perimeter fence. Later on, I heard that his throat had been slit, there.\n\nThe other prisoner who had been killed was named Vlado Savic. He had been beaten so\n\nsavagely that was in a very bad psychological shape, almost out of his mind. They morbidly\n\nbeat him almost every day and, one day, we saw him no more. That was in the middle of May\n\n1992. I do not know any other details about this killing. I would like to draw attention that the\n\nprison had often been visited by Croatian soldiers coming fro m battlegrounds and that they,\n\ntoo, participated in the beating of prisoners and got kicks out of it.\n\nI know that one civilian person had also been killed in this prison; he was a Serb as to ethnic\n\norigin and came from the vicinity of Split. He was between 35 and 40 years of age. I do not\n\nknow his name and I only know that he had been brought to Lora and that, on one occasion,\n\nas far as I can remember, when he had to be transferred from Lora, he tried to escape and I\n\nwas in the prison grounds when I saw the guards shoot at him. When he fell down on a\n\nfootpath, the guards came to him along with warden Tomo Dujic. They beat him and took him\n\nto the toilet on block A where they beat him so savagely and, since I happened to pass by\n\nwhen they did so, I know that he was most beaten and punched by Tomo Dujic himself and\n\nthat he died then and there of the injuries he sustained. On that occasion, in addition to the\n\nwarden, there were some other prison guards in the toilet, who took out their knives, so I\n\nguess that they had stabbed him to death.\n\nDuring my detention in this prison, together with Zarkovic and Cucak, I made two or three\n\ncoffins out of timber from the ammunition cases. Finally, I would like to add that, of other\n\nprison staff, apart from Tomo Dujic, whom I think was from Vukovar and who was in\n\ncommand of the prison, I also knew a man called Brkic or Vrkic, his first name was Tonci\n\nwho accompanied Dujic, Zoran Dozder who stood in for Dujic in his absence, and among the\n\nprison guards I remembered vividly, by their br utality, Ante Gudic, Andjelko Botic, brothers\n\nDamir and Davor Perisic, one of whom was nicknamed Ra mbo, Tonci Rogosic, who was\n\nparticularly cruel, as well as Emilio Bung ur, Josko Pribudic and Zoran Sulejmanovic. The\n\nother guards I can recognize by sight, but I do not know their names. Some of them even took\n\npictures with us, to keep them as souvenirs of the imprisoned Chetniks.\n\nI was at Lora until 20 August 1992 when they transferred me for the purpose of prisoner exchange,\n\nfirst at Kerestinac near Zagreb and then in Osijek. I was exchanged on 14 August 1992, at Nemetin.\n\n350And last but not least, I would like to add that, considering that I worked in the kitchen, food\n\nwas good enough to survive, but it was bad an d insufficient, and provided once or twice a\n\nday. However, on block C, they did not get an y food or got it irregularly, and it was very\n\npoor, so that I often pushed to them leftovers behind the bars, sometimes even cigarettes and\n\nother things.\n\nAs regards my willingness to stand as witness in Split, I am, in principle, ready to do so\n\nprovided that some other witnesse s who used to be detained with me at Lora appear as well\n\nand on condition that we receive full assuran ces regarding our security and permanent\n\nprotection by the Croatian police from the border crossing to Split, and from Split on our\n\nreturn to Yugoslavia.\n\nThat is all I had to say; I heard what was dictated out loud as the minute; I do not wish to read\n\nit and I sign it as my own statement without any comments.\n\nThe hearing was adjourned at 10:35 a.m.\n\nRoeurtrder InvestiMatigistrate\n\nJasrinkoigced) DC raganoigiced)\n\nMiTlogieed)\n\n351352353354355356357 KN-oIO5/93\n\nMINUTES OF WITNESS HEARING\n\ntaken on 21 February 2002 before the investigating magistrate of the First Municipal Court in\n\nBelgrade in the criminal case against unknown persons, for committing the criminal act\n\npunishable under Article 120 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nInvestigating Magistrate\n\ns s e n t i cW i v o r a s e C n a g a r D\n\nVojvakovic\n\nCourt Recorder\n\nJasna Marinkovic\n\nWitness has been cautioned that he/she is bound to tell the truth and not to hold\n\nanything back; he/she has been warned ag\n\ntestimony and that he/she is not bound to answer some of the questions asked if he/she is\n\nlikely to put himself/herself or a close relative to utter disgrace, considerable material\n\ndamage or to be criminally prosecuted; therefore, the witness has given the following\n\nanswers to the general questions posed:\n\n1) Name and surname:\n\n2) Father’s name:\n\n3) Occupation:\n\n4) Address:\n\n5) Place of birth:\n\n6) Year of birth:\n\n7) Relationship to the\n\naccused and injured party:\n\nThe witness was cautioned that he was bound to\n\nevidence; he was also warned against the consequence of giving false evidence, as well as that\n\nhe was not bound to answer some of the questions if they were likely to put him or any of his\n\ncloser relatives to utter disgrace or to cause him considerable material damage or to be\n\ncriminally prosecuted, and he made the following statement:\n\nFrom 1989, I worked as a lieutenant in the then JNA at the Army Post Office 5542 in Nis. On\n\n2 August 1991, I was assigned to Army Post Office 5919 in Knin. In January 1992, I received\n\nthe assignment to evacuate, with my unit, the Serb civilians from the village of Noskalik,\n\nwhich is situated in the vicinity of Sibenik. Bearing in mind that it was the outset of the war in\n\nCroatia and that this village was near the Croatian army forces, there was a danger that the\n\nlives of civilians could be jeopardized, because of the daily military activities of the Croatian\n\nforces and the infiltration of their subversive groups. On 29 February 1992, I set off with my\n\nunit to complete the assignment I was given. I was with 22 other soldiers, all JNA recruits.\n\nWe arrived in this village in the after\n\npopulation. The village had about 300 civilians, including 35 children. So we had to evacuatethem to Knin. During this evacuation, a Croatian subversive group numbering 10-20 people\n\nwith ZNG symbols attacked the village cutting off my unit, which was followed by an all-out\n\nattack of ZNG forces on us. They killed two of my soldiers, Zivko Zenek and Niko Zeljak,\n\nboth were from the vicinity of Knin, and after two days when I saw their bodies I noticed that\n\ntheir throats had been cut. During this operation of the Croatian forces, Zivko Zeljak's mother\n\nwas killed along with another woman whose body was decapitated and I don't recall her\n\nname. My unit withdrew to another village an d we battled with the Croatian forces until 2\n\nMarch 1992. During this fighting, I was wounded in my left leg and was also injured in the\n\nhead, in a hand-grenade explosion. I was also taken prisoner by ZNG forces, on that occasion.\n\nAs soon as they caught me wounded and injured, they threw me into a nearby stream and\n\nstarted drowning me. Then they took me out of water and walked over me. They kicked me\n\nall over my body. After they had beaten me over my wounds, they took me on a stretcher,\n\nimprovised from a ladder, to their prison in Kuli na, near Sibenik. While they transported me\n\nto Kulina, they also kicked me, hit me with rifle butts, wooden bats and similar instruments. I\n\nremember that my lips were cut from the beating, and that the doctors stitched them later on at\n\na hospital where I received medical assistance . Along with me, 7 other soldiers had been\n\ntaken prisoner, as well as a number of civilians. They threatened us that we would all be\n\nkilled. They even went so far as to put a firing squad in front of us, threatening to execute us.\n\nThere at Kulina, in Sibenik, one soldier show ed me a piece of paper with my alleged\n\nconfession typed on it saying that I had killed Croatian soldiers and civilians and he\n\ndemanded that I signed it. I did not want to si gn it and, later, I saw that somebody else had\n\nsigned for me. That same evening, I and six other soldiers were moved to a prison in the\n\nDracevac barracks, near Split. No sooner had I co me there, that the guards tore both of my\n\nearlobes with a piece of wire or staple, and left them hanging in my ears, as earrings. I had\n\nthese wires in my ears for two months.\n\nOn 3 March 1992, I was transferred from the pr ison at Dracevac to a military prison located\n\nwithin the naval port of Lora, in Split. I was driven to Lora together with 6 other JNA soldiers,\n\nmost of whom were active soldiers, but there were also some reservists among them. Along\n\nwith me were also brought: Mirko Milovac, Jovo Zeljak, Pero Zeljak and Dino Zeljak, as well\n\nas some other men whose names I cannot remember now. As soon as they took us out of this\n\ntruck, a group of guards was already lined up waiting to beat us, kick us with their boots and hit\n\nus with rifle butts and clubs. They beat us for about two hours in the courtyard; then they put us\n\ninto cells, one by one. The cell I was in was the size of 2 by 3 metres. It had no beds and no\n\nchairs or any other furniture. The floor was made of concrete. I had no blanket or mattress to\n\nsleep or sit on, and I lay there on the concrete floor itself. As soon as I was put into this cell, I\n\nwas beaten. A group of 3 guards burst in and theybeat me, kicked me and hit me with baseball\n\nbats, all over my body. When the three of them got tired, they came out and another group of 3\n\nguards came in. They kept beating me. I also heard from the sound coming from other cells that\n\nthe soldiers, who had been brought in with me, were also being beaten. They beat us without\n\ninterruption. I could not sleep whether from aches and pains or from the fact that they were\n\nconstantly coming in and beating us. Because I was completely disfigured from the beatings I\n\nreceived, I lost track of time, but I think it was morning when they brought me to an office and\n\nthe guards called the military policeman wearing a uniform, who was in front of me, the\n\nwarden, and some even called him by his first na me Tomo. Later on, I found out that this Tomo\n\nwas commander of this prison and that his surname was Dujic. Together with him in the office\n\nwas, I was later told, his wife, and I believe thather name was Sandra or Tanja, I am not sure. I\n\nremember that Tomo Dujic again gave me a piece of paper with a text which says that I had\n\nkilled Croatian soldiers and civilians, to sign it,and since I refused, he told a guard to cut off my\n\nfingers. Then the guard who was present in the office came to me, pulled out his knife, put my\n\n362hand onto the table, took my right hand first, and then he made a move to cut my index finger,\n\nof which I even have a scar today. The investig ating magistrate noted that, having the witness\n\nshown his right hand index finger and a visible scarin the middle of it, as well as that he had the\n\nsame scar also on the index finger of this left hand.\n\nHaving started cutting my right had index finger, the guard took my left hand and repeated the\n\nsame process with my left hand index finger. Then, Dujic stopped him and told me to sit on a\n\nchair, tying my arms and legs to it himself, after which he tied two wires on the improvised\n\nearrings that had already been put into my ears at Dracevac. I noticed that the wires were\n\nconnected to the field inductor telephone. Then, Dujic turned the handle of the telephone and\n\nswitched on the electric current. That was a 11 5 volt current and it caused strong electric\n\nshocks and pains so that my whole body twitched, following which Dujic tied the wires to my\n\nlegs and to my penis so that this torture last ed for several hours. While Dujic subjected me to\n\ntorture with electric shocks, the guards beat me all over my body which was tied up.\n\nAfter these electric shocks, they used to take me back to my cell, and I recall that, after a\n\nwhile, some children came in and beat me also with various objects. I believe that one of them\n\nwas the son of Dujic or another prison guard.\n\nBesides, I also remember a guard, whose name I do not know, but I can describe what he\n\nlooked like at the time. He had eith er on his left or right arm a scar that he used to show me\n\neach time. He was not so tall, brown-haired and had a fringe. He drove me in a car to his\n\nhome and held me there in the basement. Then he called some of his acquaintances and they\n\nbeat me mostly with chains in that basement. After that, they bundled me into the back of his\n\ncar and he drove me back to Lora. Again, they threw me into my cell and the guards brought\n\nGerman Shepherd dogs which were trained and ga ve them orders to dig their teeth into my\n\nneck. After that, they would sooth the dogs and the guards would force me to kiss the dog,\n\nwhich held me by the neck, on its mouth.\n\nAfter this torture, the guards would take me and the others to the prison grounds, saying that\n\nthey were taking us out for execution by shooting, because we were all sentenced to death and\n\nthey lined us up against the wall. One of the guards who wore a black cap with a slit, on the\n\nhead would stand out, pull out his gun and shoot me and others, just missing our heads.\n\nDuring my detention at Lora, I was taken out a dozen times for these mock \"shootings\". They\n\nalso forced me and Mirko Milovac repeatedly to beat each other with bats and sticks, as well\n\nas to punch each other, so hard or else we would be beaten by the guards.\n\nApart from seven prisoners of war, I saw that three civilians were detained with us at the time.\n\nI had not seen any other prisoner and I believe that there were no such prisoners. However, I\n\ndo not know the names of these civilians.\n\nI would also like to add that besides the warden Tomo Dujic, I do not remember the names of\n\nother prison guards except for the name of his wife who also used to beat me and the other\n\nprisoners alongside her husband Tomo Dujic. Howe ver, I am sure that despite the passing of\n\ntime, I can recognize these guards. I also know th at at the Dracevac prison where I had also\n\nbeen beaten and subjected to torture, th e commander was Ivica Bacic, whom I had known\n\nfrom an earlier period when he was a non-commissione d officer in the JNA. He also brutally\n\nbeat me at the prison at Dracevac and threatened to kill me. He used to tell me that I had come\n\nfrom Aleksinac to Split to kill his family. While I was at Dracevac and Lora, I was not given\n\nany decision on my detention. It was long after th is that I was tried in Zagreb for the criminal\n\nact of armed rebellion and I was sentenced, I believe, to 22 years in prison.\n\n363 I also believe that I was in luck because, immediately upon my imprisonment, I was spotted\n\nquite by accident by ICRC dele gates and after being captured, I was recorded as such right\n\naway. That was why I stayed alive. Had it not be en for these records, I believe I would have\n\nbeen dead.\n\nI was at Lora until 7 March 1992 when they drove me to the prison in Sibenik where I was\n\nalso tortured and mistreated in various ways, like at Lora. Finally, in April I was moved to\n\nKerestinac in Zagreb.\n\nMy detention in these prisons in Croatia that I would refer to as detention camps has resulted\n\nin my terrible physical and psychological c ondition, even today. For instance, when I was\n\ncaptured I weighed 97 kg and when I was exchanged, I weighed only 46 kg. I had my ribs\n\nbroken in these prisons, five ribs on my right hand side and two on my left hand side. I can\n\nprove it with my medical documents.\n\nI would be prepared to testify in court rega rding developments at Lora if all security\n\nassurances were given by the Croatian government.\n\nThat is all I had to say; I listened to what was dictated as the minute out loud; I do not wish to\n\nread it and I sign it as my own statement, without any comments.\n\nThe hearing was adjourned at 12:20 p.m.\n\nRoeuortrder InvestiMatigistrate\n\nJaarinkoigiced) DCraganoigiced)\n\nVZojvkoigced)\n\n364365366367368369373374On 21 November 1993, Nikola Nadoveza was h eard as witness of what happened on\n\nMiljevacki Plato on 21 June 1992 in the offices of the Main Staff of the Serbian Army of\n\nKrajina, Room No. 51, and he gave the following\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nMy name is Nikola Nadoveza. I was born on 2 January 1953 in the village of Icevo,\n\nMunicipality of Sibenik, of late father Stojan and mother Stevanija, nee Urukalo. I work for\n\nthe enterprise TVIK in Knin, I am married and a father of three. I am a Serb and have no\n\ncriminal record.\n\nOn 21 June 1992, as a TO soldier, I was deploy ed in Kljuc on Miljevacki Plato. The Croatian\n\nArmy attacked us around 4:40 a.m. and as we withdrew, I was taken prisoner in Siritovci\n\naround 7:00 p.m. I was captured together with 18 soldiers of whom two were killed and 3\n\ninjured. When we were captured, they stripped us into our underwear. We had to empty our\n\npockets of all documents, money and other pos sessions. As we did so, we were hit and\n\ninsulted by whoever pleased.\n\nAfter a while, a truck came to the scene. We had to load one killed soldier onto it. His name\n\nwas Ljubo Trifunovic. Three wounded soldiers we re also loaded onto the truck. After a\n\nkilometer drive, the truck came to a stop and they called out Djuro Cosic who had to step out.\n\nTwo soldiers led him away and we had to lo ad another body in. The killed man had a belt\n\naround his neck and no injuries on his body. Later on, it turned out that he had been strangled.\n\nHis name was Medos and I don't remember his first name. From there we travelled on to\n\nVisovac where we waited for a boat. There, they ill-treated us by forcing us in and out of\n\nwater which was terribly dirty and cold. Then arrived the boat into which we loaded the\n\nwounded and dead, and we travelled to the Krka Falls. From there, we boarded a bus which\n\nwas lined up by Croatian army soldiers who kicked us with their boots and hit us with rifles\n\nwherever they could. We then came to Sibenik, in the prison, in front of which there was a\n\nline-up of Croatian soldiers. who beat us again.\n\nWhen we came into the cell, we all slept ther e together and they t ook our particulars during\n\nthe night. The next day, they used various methods to beat us. On 23 June 1992, they dragged\n\nus out of the cell and took us to Miljevacki Plato where we had to bury our dead soldiers.\n\nWe were four in a group. At first, we dug graves where we buried our fellow soldiers. We\n\nburied two bodies in one grave and five in the other. Then I found Djuro Cosic and\n\nrecognized him. He was the one who had been dragged out of the truck and stayed behind. I\n\nlooked at him and saw that his lip was cut, mo st probably because he was stabbed into the\n\nthroat and he also had stabwounds on both of his thighs. The skin on his chest, 3 cm by 2 cm,\n\nwas ripped. When we had done this job, ther e came another order not to bury them any\n\nlonger, but to load them into the truck and drive them to the pit. When we were in the village\n\nof Kljuc, we had two dead - Ilija Canak and Nikola Mircetic - who had been burnt down by a\n\nstinger missile fired at close range. The truc k was driven to the pit at Drinovci which was\n\ncovered with concrete at the top. I did not know what it was for.\n\nThen they gave us orders to throw them into the pit. We threw them by putting one body onto\n\ncanvas and then, four men carried it and threw th e bodies into the pit. When we had finished,\n\nwe drove by truck to Noskalik to catch a boat. There, we washed shovels and the other tools,\n\nand cleaned ourselves. A man named MIROSLAV SUBOTIC was killed there. He was killed\n\n377by a military police officer, Gojko Zivkovic, fro m Pokrovnik. He ordered him to walk about\n\n20 meters and to turn, and then he fired a couple of shots at him. After that, four of us dug a\n\ngrave by the Krka River and we buried him there. Following this, we went to the Krka Falls\n\nand from there onto the prison.\n\nIn prison, mistreatment was a daily occurrence. We also had to do hard labour and they hit us\n\non such jobs more than they did in the prison. When they wanted to extract some confession,\n\nthey electrocuted us. They loved to strip us na ked, to form a single file and walk over us.\n\nThey forced us to do calisthenics, to dance in a circle, to sing Ustasha songs and salute \"For\n\nHomeland Ready\" and this routine was repeated day after day. We went from Sibenik to be\n\nexchanged on 11 August 1992 and were held up at the port of Lora for about 5 or 6 hours,\n\nwhere we were relentlessly beaten. The mistr eatment included their stepping onto our bare\n\nfeet with their boots, forcing us to eat the zest of oranges, forcing us to pick up cigarette butts\n\nwith our teeth, etc. They forced us, one by one , to do so, while shooting at us at the same\n\ntime.\n\nAfter that, we travelled by bus to Zagreb where, at the Kerestinec camp, we were held for two\n\ndays. I have no objections to our treatment at the Kerestinec camp. From Kerestinec, we\n\nheaded for Nemetin where we were exchanged on 14 August 1992.\n\nI have read the statement and I have no objections to it. Therefore, I sign it with my own\n\nhand.\n\nStatement taken by: Borka Torbica (Signed)\n\nStatement given by: Nikola Nadoveza, LLB (Signed)\n\n378379380 Kri.24/95\n\nMINUTES OF WITNESS HEARING\n\ntaken on 7 May 1995 before the investigating magistrate of the Basic Court in Gradiska in the\n\ncriminal case against unknown persons, for co mmitting the criminal act punishable under\n\nArticle 142 of the Criminal Code.\n\nCMkocdi, Witness\n\nr a t e P , c i z o B\n\nCourt Recorder\n\nAleksandra Cvetkovic\n\nThe proceedings rose at 9:45 a.m.\n\nWitness has been cautioned that he/she is bound to tell the truth and not to hold\n\nanything back; he/she has been warned ag ainst the consequences of giving false\n\ntestimony and that he/she is not bound to an swer some of the questions asked, if he/she\n\nis likely to put himself/herself or a close rela tive to utter disgrace, considerable material\n\ndamage or to be criminally prosecuted (Art icle 229 of the Criminal Procedure Code),\n\ntherefore, the witness has given the following answers to the general questions posed:\n\n1) Name and surname: Bozic, Petar\n\n2) Father’s name: Savo\n\n3) Occupation: Carpenter\n\n4) Address: temporarily residing in Nova Topola, municipality of Gradiska\n\n5) Place of birth: Vrbovljani, municipality of Okucani\n\n6) Year of birth: 11 January 1960\n\n7) Relationship to the\n\naccused and injured party: Bozic, P. (Signed)\n\nI was born in the village of Vrbovljani where I lived and worked. I am married and have two\n\nunderage children. I used to live with my parent s, father Savo and moth er Milka in the same\n\nhousehold.\n\nDuring the war in Croatia in 1991, I was in my native village and was aware that the Croatian\n\narmed forces committed mass crimes against civilians in Masicka Sagovina. Some even say\n\nthat they killed more than 20 civilians. I did not witness these crimes myself. The victims I\n\nknow included Mladen Ozegovic and some members of the Milosavljevic family.\n\nWhen, on 1 May 1995, the Croatian armed for ces suddenly attacked Western Slavonia,\n\naround 5 a.m., I was in my home with my family and parents. During this attack, they shelled\n\neven my village, although it was farthest from Okucani, and other villages that were the main\n\ntargets of the Croatian armed forces. My parents, wife and children, along with other civilians\n\nfrom my village and other villa ges nearby, headed for Gradiska or Republika Srpska and\n\nmanaged to cross the Sava River in the afternoon.\n\nI remained behind in the village and joined my military unit which was deployed in the field\n\nnear Dubovac. On the evening of 1 May 1995, I can’t recall exactly what time it was, my unit got the assignment\n\nto enter the village of Novi Varos and secure the passage of civilians from Novi Varos towards\n\nthe Strug waterway, which was used by the convoy of Serb civilians fleeing as refugees before the\n\nattack of the Croatian armed forces. Meanwhile, we got the information that this road was blocked\n\nby Croats and that, during the night, they had massacred civilians travelling in a convoy of\n\nrefugees, which came under attack in the stretch of 70 meters. That was why we pushed through\n\nto get to that place, which I did only at 6 o’clock in the morning. We continued to fight back the\n\nCroatian forces lined on both sides of the road in the Prasnik and Ljeskovaca woods, as well as in\n\nthe village of Novi Varos itself. However, we managed to get the civilian convoy through,\n\ntowards the destroyed bridge on the Strug waterway, but the convoy departed only around 11 a.m.\n\nIn the meantime, we had clashes with the Croatian forces that relentlessly shelled the stretch of the\n\nroad where there were civilians, and I noticed that they used aircraft to bomb civilians on the road.\n\nI saw a large number of killed Serb civilians in the village of Novi Varos itself, as well as on its\n\noutskirts, leading to the Strug waterway. In my own assessment, there were about 250 victims or\n\naccording to the accounts of some other eyewitnesses, the same number of victims also figured in\n\ntheir assessments. I saw some 25 victims myself; I took them from the scene together with others\n\nand I took only the victims that were scattered on the roadway, so that they would not be run over.\n\nAmong those victims, I recognized Vukadinovic,Zoran from Okucani; Milasinovic, Milan from\n\nRajic; Grubor, Janko from Okucani and Kesic, Anka,dahter of the SerbianOrthodox priest Savo\n\nPocuca from Okucani. Among those wounded, I recognized Savo Pocuca, priest from Okucani,\n\nand Slobodan Stojanovic from Vrbovljani, bothwfhom are now hospitalized in Banja Luka.\n\nThose who survived the unrelenting shelling by Croats managed to get via the Strug waterway\n\nand the bridge to cross into Gradiska, to the territory of Republika Srpska.\n\nI also saw with my own eyes in the village ofviaros itself, as well as on the road leading to the\n\nStrug waterway, great many overturned and destroyed tractors, animal carts, cars and other vehicles.\n\nAmong these, there were also a few medical corps vehicles with distinct Red Cross emblems that\n\nhad also been shelled, although I was not able to see the victims in those medical vehicles.\n\nJudging by what I saw and experienced on 1 and 2 May 1995, I can say, responsibly, that on\n\nthat occasion, the Croatian armed forces committed a large number of massive crimes against\n\nSerb civilians in Western Slavonia.\n\nIn particular, I point out that great many civ ilians had remained behind in Western Slavonia,\n\nwho were either captured by Croats or are now sheltering in the woods, many of whom have\n\nalready been killed. Because I know the attitude of Croats towards Serbs in Western Slavonia\n\nin the past and their attitudes even today, I reasonably assume that they will continue with\n\ntheir crimes and genocide against the Serbian people.\n\nThis is all I had to say concerning the above -mentioned incident; the minute was dictated out\n\nloud and it contains all I have said; I do not wish to read it; I recognize it as my own statement\n\nand will sign it with my own hand.\n\nBozic, P.

I am\n\nmarried and have four children.\n\nWhen the war broke out in the former Yugoslavia and the Croats committed an aggression\n\nagainst the Serb population in Western Slavonia, I was in Okucani. During this war, I saw\n\nwith my own eyes many Serb victims who had been killed by Croats in this region. While\n\ndoing my duties, I performed funeral ceremonies for a large number of such victims,\n\nincluding massacred ones in a most brutal and savage way. I shall name, among the most\n\nbrutal murders, that of the Keleula couple from the village of Borovac, Rajici parish, who\n\nlived in Novska and were killed on 21 Oct ober 1991. On the same date, and on the same\n\nscene, another married couple was also killed. I cannot recall their first and last names, as well\n\nas an elderly man from Lovska. Their bodies were exchanged in April 1992 and transported to\n\n391the graveyard in Borovac. While performing the funeral services for these victims, I saw that\n\nthey had been massacred in the most atrocious way. One of the killed women had her breast\n\ncut through and put her arm into. All other vi ctims had massacred parts of their bodies, like\n\nsevered ears, noses or similar. There were also other like instances of killed and massacred\n\ncivilians and defenders of this region, whose specific names I cannot recall.\n\nOn the Serbian Christian Orthodox feast of pa tron saint, St. Nicholas, on 19 December 1991,\n\nCroats, posing as former JNA soldiers and wearing their uniforms, took advantage of the local\n\nSerbs’ festive mood in the villages of Masicka Sagovina and Sirinci to force their way into\n\nthese villages, fully armed, and committed an aggression killing 65 Serb villagers. A small\n\nnumber of these victims were subsequently exchanged, while information on other victims is\n\nstill not known, even today. These victims were mainly massacred, too. UNPROFOR soldiers\n\ndid not allow these victims to be buried at local cemeteries. Therefore, their funerals took\n\nplace in Okucani and I performed the ceremonies, which were also attended by the family\n\nmembers of victims. Some of the victims did not even have families, because all of them too\n\nhad probably been killed.\n\nIn my own parish church in Okucani, I kept the original copy of the “Proclamation” made by\n\nCroats on forced population transfers within 24 hours, in 28 Serbian villages located in the area\n\nof Pozega towards Kamenska, at the foot of Mt. Papuk. This “Proclamation” was issued on 28\n\nAugust 1991 and I believe that a copy of this “Proclamation” can be found in the Patriarchate of\n\nthe Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, name ly, it is kept by Mr. Slobodan Mileusnic. I\n\nknow that the population of these villages had been forcibly moved out; that all the houses had\n\nbeen destroyed and levelled to the ground by bulldozers so that practically no traces had been\n\nleft behind. I heard this myself from local pe ople who had managed to cross over into the\n\nliberated territory of Western Slavonia. I remember that I have been told this, among others, by\n\nthe wife of Branko Kovac from the village of Oprsici, whose maiden name was Petrovic, and by\n\nother people whose names I cannot recall right now. I do not know where this woman is now,\n\nbecause she moved on in 1991 to other Serb-held territories seeking shelter.\n\nAt the end of September 1991, Croats perfidi ously attacked the village of Gredjani,\n\nmunicipality of Okucani, killing 18 civilians, mainly elderly people, and setting about 50\n\nhouses on fire. I remember that one of the vic tims was Petar Calic, while the others I knew\n\nonly by sight. On the same date, Croats also attacked the village of Covac, killing several\n\ncivilians there. I cannot remember, now, their exact number and they torched some 30 Serbian\n\nhouses. I remember that they mutilated, then, among other people, Stevan Stancic, aged about\n\n50. Among other things, for the sake of illustratio n of what perfidious methods Croats used, I\n\nmention an instance in the village of Covac when they, during their attack against this village,\n\nplanted a landmine in a tractor and put it beside the road in the maize field. When the owner\n\nof this tractor called for help Majstorovic’s son Milan, a 25-year-old young man, to pull the\n\ntractor out with his own tractor, which he did, but at that moment the landmine blew off and\n\nboth men were killed on the spot.\n\nOn 1 May 1995 I was with my family at home, when Croats committed an aggression against\n\nWestern Slavonia. The episcope of Western Sl avonia, Mr. Lukijan, was with us because his\n\ntemporary seat was in Okucani from 1991 onwards, and he used to spend most of his time in\n\nmy home.\n\nThe local population was warned via local radio Okucani against possible shelling and\n\nbombardment of villages, since first shells fell in the town itself and around it. Sometime\n\nbetween 9 and 10 a.m., the radio broadcast th at the population should prepare for a possible\n\n392evacuation but that they should stay put for the time being. This situa tion lasted all the time\n\nuntil 1 p.m. or so. In the meantime, news came in that Croats were closing in from all sides\n\nand that the defence lines still held. A number of civilians had, on their own initiative, left for\n\nthe village of Novi Varos or for Gradiska, travelling in various vehicles, but after 1 p.m.\n\ninitial evacuations were organized, primarily of children, women and elderly people.\n\nAround 9 p.m. I drove my wife, three children and two other women from Okucani as well as\n\na student of theology, who happened to visit the episcope at the time, in my own car, and I\n\nintended to get back to Okucani as soon as I could.\n\nI was wearing my cloth and had a ll the other priest’s symbols. The episcope had remained in\n\nmy home in Okucani.\n\nThe following morning, on 2 May 1995, around 7.30 a.m., I was headed back in my car for\n\nOkucani. In Gradiska Milka Kesic, a resident of Okucani, hopped in and sat on the front seat\n\nto my right-hand side. I drove across the bridge over the Sava River and the Strug waterway\n\n(“the new Sava”). As we entered the village of Novi Varos, all of a sudden we were sprayed\n\nwith a burst of machine gunfire from one of the first rows of one-storey houses by the\n\nroadside to my right. Then we were attacked with small arms from 20-odd houses, also on my\n\nright-hand side. Milka Kesic was instantly dead leaning to my side. I was hit with nine bullets\n\nbut I kept on driving until the car came to a stop itself. Still under heavy gunfire I managed to\n\nget out of the car (Aleco Russian car) and ran for some 200 metres to the centre of the village\n\nwhere I fell down. Right there, in front of me, I saw a terrible scene: A multitude of vehicles\n\non the road were on top of each other and many civilians beside them lay dead on the road.\n\nSome felt their way between the cars disc oncertedly under small arms fire coming from\n\nnearby houses and the Prasnik woods close by , as well as exposed to explosions from\n\ngrenades fired onto the road. Many vehicles were on fire. On both sides of the road there were\n\nwomen, children and the elderly who had managed to take cover in the houses there.\n\nFrom a house which was some ten metres away from me, civilians who had sheltered there\n\ncame out and rushed to help me. They took me to the nearby house; gave me first aid as much\n\nas they could, and tried not to let me lapse into a coma by pouring water over me and calling\n\nmy name. They did not let me drink any water which I asked for, fearing the consequences.\n\nI did not know how much time had passed until the units of the Army of the Republic of\n\nSerbian Krajina came. They succeeded in pushing back the Croats from houses nearby to the\n\nwoods, where they continued their offensive. However, our army managed, though under heavy\n\nfire, to open a passage to the Sava River and enable the survivors and wounded civilians to pull\n\nout of that place of death. The civilians who were around me succeeded in taking me to a car in\n\nwhich I was transported to the hospital in Gradiska and from there on to Banja Luka.\n\nI cannot say how many civilians were dead in the village of Novi Varos, but I can say that there\n\nwere many women, children and elderly among them. I personally do not know what happened\n\nto these victims later on, but I heard from people who came to the territory of Republika Srpska\n\nthat Croats had set their corpses alight and destroyed the traces of this atrocity.\n\nAmong those who assisted me I know Dusa nka Kovacevic and her daughter, both from\n\nOkucani, a young man nicknamed “Kliki”, also from Okucani, who was incidentally a refugee\n\nfrom Lipik, and others whose names I cannot re call for the moment. Dusanka Kovacevic and\n\nher daughter are most probably now in Nova Topola, and for the rest of them, I am not sure.\n\n393Among those wounded, I saw Vaso Raus; Milan Martinovic, a driver, and many others whose\n\nnames I cannot recall either, although I know them very well by sight. Also, among the dead I\n\nsaw Momcilo Dojic and his wife, Ostoja Deja novic, a man surnamed Vukasinovic and some\n\nothers whose names I cannot recall right now.\n\nThe fact that I am still in a terrible psychological state of shock explains why I am unable to\n\nremember the names of other wounded and killed or surviving people.\n\nMy Aleco car, registration OK-22-28, had stayed in the above described place, riddled with\n\nbullets.\n\nMy family members and episcope of Western Slavonia Mr. Lukian managed to pull out of\n\nOkucani via the bridge over the Sava River near Gradiska, on 2 May 1995, also under fire\n\nfrom the Croatian armed forces.\n\nWhile I was still in Okucani, I saw that the church and the parish house where I lived had\n\nbeen damaged by Croatian shells and that the window glass had been smashed.\n\nI managed to take out some of the church documents, although most of the records and other\n\ndocuments had remained behind, including the bi shopric archive. My seals were also left\n\nbehind.\n\nIn my home, I left all the furniture I had aall the clothing that I and my family could not\n\ntake with us, including a BMW car and another, ol der type of Aleco car. I used to have eight\n\npigs, two sheep, four lambs, two goats and one kid (baby goat), which I also left behind. Of\n\nfarm machinery I used to have a cultivator, a disk harrow, a tractor trailer, a car trailer, a\n\ndouble-furrow ploughshare and others.\n\nThe survived Serbian population of Western Sl avonia left in their lands an innumerable\n\nnumber of victims and the material wealth that they had acquired until then.\n\nI demand that the perpetrators of the above described crimes be brought to justice and\n\npunished accordingly.\n\nThis is all what I had to say in this connection; the minute was di ctated out loud and it\n\nincluded all I had said; I do not wish to read it; I recognize it as my own statement and sign it\n\nwith my own hand.\n\nArchpriest Savo Pocuca (Signed)\n\nThe hearing was adjourned at 3:15 p.m.\n\nCO UERCORDER JUDGE\n\nAleksCaverkogiced) Djordje Stojakovic (Signed)\n\n394395396397398399400401405409410411412 Public Statements that directly provoked the Perpetrators to commit Genocide against\n\nthe Serbs in Croatia\n\n1. Dr Franjo Tudjman, President of the Republic of Croatia, during the first election campaign\n\nin 1989:\n\n“Thank God, my wife is neither a Serb nor a Jew.” 1\n\n2. Dr Franjo Tudjman, Wastelands of Historical Reality, Zagreb, 1990:\n\n“Seen from this point of view – and this can only account for the incessant repetition of\n\nhistorical events – such violent even genocidal changes that were made also after the end of the\n\nSecond World War always bring about dual consequences. On the one hand, they inevitably\n\ndeepen historical discord. (....) On the other ha nd, they bring about ethnic homogenization of\n\nsome peoples, leading to more harmony in the national composition of the population and state\n\nborders of individual countries, thus also having possible positive impact on developments in the\n\nfuture, in the sense of fewer reasons for fresh violence and pretexts for the outbreak of new\n\n2\n\nconflicts and international friction.”\n\n3. Šime Djodan, Special Envoy of the Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in his speech at a\n\ntraditional competition in Sinj held in August 1991:\n\n3\n\n“The Serbs had pointed heads and probably also small brains.”\n\n4. Marjan Jurić, Deputy in the Croatian Parliament, at a session held on 1-3 August 1991:\n\n\"But I am asking these same Serbs whether it wi ll dawn on them when they - and I am just\n\nwondering - and I’m not making a statement[sic!]- whether they would come to their senses if ten\n\ncivilians were executed for one k illed policeman or if a hundred civilians were killed for one\n\n1 See L.

This is something that my Christian, Catholic faith would not let me, because Father\n\nStanko Bogeljic has taught me that there is one commandment in those ten commandments:\n\n“thou shall not kill”, and it does not allow me to say that this is right, but it would be right for me\n\nif ten Serb intellectuals would get the sack in Zagreb, Rijeka, Split or Osijek for every policeman\n\nkilled. For, intellectuals cannot go to the woods. They are not like those ignorant Banija peasants\n\nwho could go to bed without washing their feet fora month!

The same is true of those who came to\n\n4\n\nus as our guest-workers.\"(Deputy Jurić ended his speech with a raised hand in a fascist-style salute).\n\n5. Krešimir Dolenčić, Director of \"Gavella“ Theatre in Zagreb, in his article in daily Danas,\n\nZagreb, 12 November 1991:\n\n“Beasts from the East stand no chance. A monkey smashes everything around the house\n\nand it is all the same to the animal whether it smashed a glass or a Chinese vase, because\n\nit is unable to tell the difference. There is no way that the monkey has any chances in the\n\nfight against the human. There will always be a way to put it to sleep and place it in a\n\ncage where it belongs.[...] The distinction between us and them is like between computers\n\nof the first and the fifth generation.

Dubravko Horvatić, Croatian academic and writer, in his article Matoš o Srbiji published in\n\ndaily Večernji list, Zagreb, 17 June 1992:\n\n“Matoš [Croatian poet]taught both his contemporaries and the generations to come what\n\nSerbia is and what it is like.
