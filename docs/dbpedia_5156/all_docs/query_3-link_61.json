        "text": "Last weekend, the first underground festival was organized by the Adria.fun portal, ZAGREB UNDERGROUND, was visited by more than 3,000 people, who, walking along the red carpet from the entrance to the Tunnel Grič in Mesnička Street to the exit in Radićeva Street, tasted Croatian wines and delicacies while having a good time.\n\nDelighted faces of visitors and exhibitors, as well as an exceptional visit, are a sign that we succeeded in creating a new center of hedonism and entertainment in the center of Zagreb, at the foot of the Upper Town, from the first attempt.\n\nAds\n\nHowever, visitors to the Zagreb underground were not only from Zagreb, but also from many other cities in the wider area such as Rijeka, Pula, Varaždin, Karlovac, Petrinja, Sisak, Pitomača, Virovitica, but also Celje, Maribor, Kranj, Jesenice, Ljubljana…\n\nThere were also tourists from all over the world, who happened to be in Zagreb during the festival and were able to feel the unique atmosphere brought by the first ZAGREB UNDERGROUND.\n\nSome of them had the opportunity for the first time to taste the exceptional offer of more than 200 Croatian wines, so they sweetened their palates with Muscat, Traminac, Graševina, Riesling, Škrlet, Teran, Malvazija, Sauvignon and many other wine varieties from the offer.\n\nSo that the visitors would not be hungry, the tasting offer included many Croatian delicacies, so the exhibitors, with a lot of effort and love, put smiles on the faces of the visitors while they tried dried meat and fish products, different spreads, honey products…\n\nZagreb is buzzing about the exceptional atmosphere created by the organizers by painting parts of the tunnel in the colors of the four wine regions, as well as the central part of the tunnel, which has been transformed into the legendary Studio 54.\n\nThe fantastic Disco Magic band from Split, with the sounds of Abba, Boney M, Kool and the Gang, and many other legendary performers, danced with the visitors who relaxed to the rhythm of the music with a glass of good wine in hand.\n\nThe pauses between the bands’ performances were superbly filled by DJ MacGregor, keeping the atmosphere high.\n\nVisitors used every opportunity to make unforgettable memories by taking photos at the entrance next to the panel with the names of the sponsors, but also in the Tetra photo booth in the central part of the tunnel.\n\nThe visit to the stand of the association Krijesnica, which collected voluntary contributions for children and families suffering from malignant diseases, was well attended, so once again the visitors expressed themselves when it was necessary to help those in need. And we will set aside a portion of the ticket revenue for their selfless efforts.\n\nOur original and unique winemaking exhibition of the future captured the attention of everyone who walked through side tunnel number two. A dozen or so exhibits gave us an insight into the near future, so we cleverly used artificial intelligence to see the times to come.\n\nThe Tunnel Grič thus extremely successfully “acted” as a wine cellar, especially since the temperature outside was 30 degrees, and inside a pleasant 20.\n\nAll visitors who bought tickets could participate in a creative giveaway for the duration of the festival, in which the main prize is a 7-day vacation for two people at the all-inclusiveLabranda Senses resort in Vrboska on the island of Hvar.\n\nNamely, in the mini catalog, which we handed out at the entrance to the tunnel, there was a QR code that led to our destination page where you had to rate the wineries and creatively describe why you chose that particular winery. We received answers from almost 500 visitors, who tried their best to make the job of the three-member jury difficult with their imaginative descriptions.\n\nAfter a long deliberation, the jury decided that the main prize was given to the following description!\n\n“Ama baš svako vino bilo je pitko i fino.\n\nNa štandu mi nije bilo dosadno\n\njer je svako vino bilo baš posebno.\n\nTe kada sam došao doma\n\nnedostajala mi je ta fina voćna aroma.\n\nMalo Traminaca, Graševine, i Rizlinga\n\nuhvatila me bezbriga.\n\nSada je vrijeme da idem spavati,\n\nznam da ću danas dobro sanjati.”\n\nThe owner of this description is DAVOR MLADIĆ from Zagreb, so he is also the winner of the main prize. Congratulations!\n\nConsolation prizes, and wine gift packages from our sponsors, were given to:\n\nMarijana Perić from Bjelovar\n\nAleš Sorič from Celje\n\nRadislav Anić from Rijeka\n\nAlenka Radić from Zagreb\n\nMagdalena Jerbić from Split\n\nCongratulations to them too! We will contact all the winners about the realization of the prizes via the e-mail you left us in the applications!\n\nAnd finally, we would like to emphasize that you rated the first underground festival ZAGREB UNDERGROUND with a high score of 9.1 (on a scale of 1 to 10), and here are the five best wineries of the ZAGREB UNDERGROUND 2024 festival according to your ratings!\n\nRoxanich from Motovun (Region of Istria and Primorje)\n\nApolitico from Virovitica (Slavonia and Danube region)\n\nMarčeta wines from Fažana (Istria and Primorje Region)\n\nGalićwines from Kutjevo (Slavonia and Danube region)\n\nPlančić Winery from Svirče, Hvar Island (Dalmatia Region)\n\nThank you to everyone who came, thank you to the exhibitors and sponsors, and to all of you who incorporated a part of yourself into the foundations of the new project of the Adria.fun portal. See you next year at ZAGREB UNDERGROUND 2025!\n\nBefore that, hopefully, this summer, in one of the cities on the beautiful coast of the Adriatic Sea!"
