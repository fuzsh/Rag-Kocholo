What is Peppol Network?

Peppol is the open network that has been established for the exchange of electronic documents in Europe (and increasingly in countries such as Australia and New Zealand) that allows the sending of electronic invoices from both of companies to public administrations as between the own private companies. The different countries where Peppol is deployed may have different legal requirements, but they all conform to the established standard format.

The standard Peppol format is Peppol BIS3 , and it is mandatory to specify the Peppol Participant ID of the client to be registered with a network registration service called SMP.

B2Brouter is an accredited Peppol Access Point (AP) and Service Metadata Publisher (SMP), so your invoices and other electronic documents can be sent to and received from any member of the Peppol network directly and transparently. Besides, as a B2Brouter member we always record the ability to receive invoice status change notifications, so that you are always informed of the process status of your invoice.

What is the Croatian business unit code?

In order to issue an invoice through Peppol Network it is necessary to obtain the Croatian Business Unit of the company or public administration to which you want to invoice. This identifier is required by the Croatian Institutions as it will allow the invoice to be transmitted to the correct receiver within the public structure of Croatia.

In the B2Brouter directory you can find the verified Croatian Business Unit of DVD BEKTEÅ½ and those of other registered companies in Peppol Network.
