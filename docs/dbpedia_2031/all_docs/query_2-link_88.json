        "text": "Maria Victoria (Minnie) Osmena, granddaughter of the late Sergio Osmena, former president of the Philippines, was married in Beverly Hills, Calif., Sept. 2 to Dwight Lyman Stuart, president of the Carnation Company. Judge Charles H. Older of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County performed the ceremony at the couple's new home.\n\nThe bride, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sergio Osmena Jr. of Los Angeles, formerly of Cebu City, the Philippines, is a financial futures broker with the Park Avenue office of Conti Commodities in New York. Her previous marriage was annulled. Her father, a former Philippines Senator, ran unsuccesfully as Liberal Party candidate for the presidency in 1969 against Ferdinand E. Marcos.\n\nThe bridegroom is the son of the late Elbridge Hadley Stuart, former president and chairman of Carnation, and the late Nan Fullerton Stuart, and a grandson of the late Elbridge Amos Stuart, founder of Carnation. He has been previously married and divorced."
