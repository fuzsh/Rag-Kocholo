        "text": "Today is the 144th birth anniversary of the only Cebuano who became president. He became president by succession when President Manuel Luis Quezon died on August 1, 1944 and he served until May 28, 1946. He was not elected president. He was defeated by his former Nacionalista partymate Manuel Roxas, the first turncoat, who left the NP and founded the Liberal Party in 1946. But Don Sergio lived until the ripe old age of 83 on October 19, 1961. His son and grandsons tried to run for president too but they lost.\n\nDon Sergio was the son of Juana Osmeña y Suico but his father remained unknown for his mother was a solo parent. The Osmeñas were rich and he was able to study in Colegio de San Carlos, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and University of Santo Tomas. He was a brilliant student with better academic records than his UST classmate Manuel Quezon. They took the Bar together. Osmeña placed second, Quezon fourth. There were less than 50 who took the Bar. Don Sergio was appointed fiscal at the age of 28 and was elected governor of Cebu less than a year later. He served as governor from 1904 to 1906. He was elected representative in 1907 and was chosen the First Speaker of the House. He served as such from 1907 to 1922. Then as senator from 1922 to 1935. He was the first vice president of the Philippine Commonwealth from November 15, 1935 to August 1, 1944.\n\nUnknown to many, Don Sergio also served as a member of the War Staff of Emilio Aguinaldo while working as a courier and journalist. In 1900, he founded the Cebu-based newspaper, El Nuevo Dia which lasted for three years. The Quezon-Osmeña alliance was an example of a strong partnership that at times was tested by principles. They parted ways a number of times but reconciled until Quezon died. When Osmeña was elected House speaker, Quezon was the speaker pro tempore. In 1916, Quezon ran for senator and became Senate president. Osmeña remained as speaker of the House. Osmeña and Roxas were sent to the US to lobby for Philippine independence. They came back with the Hare-Hawes-Cutting law, which was rejected by Quezon. The latter went to the US and came back with the Tydings-McDuffie Law. That caused the split between the two.\n\nThereafter, they reconciled and in 1935 ran under the Nacionalista Party. With the two united, they defeated two famous opponents, Gregorio Aglipay of Ilocos and Emilio Aguinaldo of Cavite. In 1941, Quezon and Osmeña ran together again. They defeated Juan Sumulong (grandfather of the late president Cory Aquino). In 1943, Quezon was barred by law to continue serving as president. Osmeña could have succeeded him at that point in time. But the great leader from Cebu persuaded the US Congress to pass a law extending the term of Quezon. That was for the sake of unity because the country was at war against Japan. But destiny intervened and Quezon died in 1944. Osmeña took over. When the Philippines was liberated by MacArthur, it was Osmeña who joined him in Palo, Leyte.\n\nDon Sergio married twice. The first wife was Estefania Veloso and their marriage lasted from 1901 to 1918. After Estefania died, Don Sergio married Esperanza Limjap. All in all, he had 13 children. His descendants include Sergio “Serging” Osmeña Jr., former Cebu City mayor, provincial governor, and candidate for both vice president and president. Sergio Osmeña III or Serge is the son of Serging and a former senator and vice presidential candidate. John Henry Osmeña, former senator and mayor of Toledo City and also congressman, was a grandson. Tomas Osmeña, former mayor of Cebu City and also congressman was a grandson, being another son of Serging. Emilio Osmeña, former governor of Cebu, brother of Sonny and presidential candidate, was also a grandson.\n\nDon Sergio was a great man, an honest public servant, a humble person and a loyal friend. He was the only Cebuano who became president. It is very difficult to find another person who has all his traits. If Quezon is honored with Quezon City and Roxas exalted with Roxas City, why was Don Sergio not honored the same way? The bridge was named in honor of Marcelo Fernan. Don Sergio does not even have a bridge named in his honor. This country has not been fair to the Grand Old Man of Cebu."
