        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis study attempted to assess the perceptions on early marriage among women who married early at barangay Venus Sergio Osmena Zamboanga del Norte. The researcher did a qualitative research utilizing Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) and individual interviews of married women who married early from Barangay Venus, Sergio Osmena Zamboanga del Norte. The researcher focused on the topics as to the optimum/right age for marriage; reasons or factors for getting married early; and the advantages and disadvantages of early marriage.\n\nResults showed that these women entered early marriage due to reasons like love and sexual desire, poverty, freedom from the bondage of strict parent, forced marriage, to have their own living. Some was due to the influences of television, media, friends and peers. Among the advantages of marrying early was financial stability; having a direction in life; having children to help in household and farm works. It was perceived that making immature decisions in selections of mates, separations, and marital problems were among the disadvantages of early marriage."
