He was Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon, and rose to the presidency upon Quezon's death in 1944, being the oldest Philippine president to hold office at age 65. A founder of Nacionalista Party, he was the first Visayan to become President of the Philippines.\n\n9.

In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for the presidential election that year. The tandem was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941.\n\n10. Osmeña is the patriarch of the prominent Osmeña family, which includes his son (former Senator Sergio Osmeña, Jr.) and his grandsons (senators Sergio Osmeña III and John Henry Osmeña), ex-governor Lito Osmeña and Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña.\n\n11. Sergio Osmeña was born in Cebu to Juana Osmeña y Suico, who was reportedly only 14 years of age when she gave birth to him.

Together with Manuel Roxas, Pres. Sergio Osmeña went on a mission to the US to ask for the Philippines' independence. The mission was called OSROX, coined from combining the first letters of their family names. The mission was successful. The Philippines was granted its independence.\n\n18.

For the presidential election of 1946, Osmeña refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew of his record of 40 years of honest and faithful service. He lost to Manuel Roxas, who won 54 percent of the vote and became president of the independent Republic of the Philippines.\n\n20. WHO IS THE MOTHER OF SERGIO OSMENA?\n\n21.
