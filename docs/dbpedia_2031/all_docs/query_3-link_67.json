        "text": "Valentin Teus was born in Navarra, Spain in 1832. At just 15 years of age, he traveled to the Philippines to try his luck in business where he purchased a distillery in Hagonoy, Bulacan. He would eventually merge with Ynchausti y Compania, one the first Philippine-owned conglomerates of business tycoons, Joaquin Elizalde and Joaquin Ynchausti who dealt mostly in shipping and trade. Teus was an industrious worker who eventually founded what we know today as Tanduay Distilleries, Inc.\n\nHe married Teresa Ferrater Ponte, the niece of the Governor General, who he bought the mansion from. In just two decades, she would meet her untimely demise. Valentin Teus became the Alcalde Primero of the Ayuntamiento de Manila in 1871. At the age of 62, he would re-marry for a second time, Dolores Menendez Valdes de Cornellana, the 20 year old niece of his deceased wife. They had four children together : Valentin Jr., who died at a young age, Concepcion, Valentin III and Dolores.\n\nThe family first lived in Binondo before Don Valentin surprised his wife with a home located at the corner of General Solano street. It would eventually be known as the Teus Mansion.\n\nDon Valentin would meet his demise in 1909. Since most of his children had migrated to Spain, his eldest daughter Concepcion, inherited the mansion. After her high school education at the Assumption Convent, she continued her studies in Spain where she married and remained. She rarely visited the house and had an old man as caretaker. Years passed and the once proud mansion eventually deteriorated. Its kitchen roof fell and the attic became home to a bat colony. In 1974 Concepcion decided to sell the house to then First Lady, Imelda Romualdez Marcos.\n\nMrs. Marcos turned it into a guest house. She restored and remodeled it with the help of interior decorator Ronald D. Laing and antique dealer Viring de Asis. Housed at the second floor are collections of gifts to President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos including the ones given during their silver wedding anniversary such as silverware and porcelain.\n\nThis room features our National flag, Presidential flag and the Presidential seal.\n\nThe current seal was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947.\n\nA distinct feature of the Presidential flag and seal is the “sea lion” granted by King Philip II of Spain in 1596. The sun with its eight rays represent the eight provinces that were placed under martial law during the Philippine Revolution. The three stars symbolize the three main regions of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nThis room features our National flag, Presidential flag and the Presidential seal.\n\nThe current seal was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947.\n\nA distinct feature of the Presidential flag and seal is the “sea lion” granted by King Philip II of Spain in 1596.

On January 23, 1899, he was elected the first President of the Philippines by the Malolos Congress of the First Republic.\n\nPresident Manuel L. Quezon\n\nFamously described as the “Paladin of Philippine Freedom”, Manuel Quezon was instrumental in the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Act of the United States Congress which, in turn, paved the way for the transition of an independent Philippine republic. During his time, and because of the Japanese occupation of the country, President Quezon was forced to go into exile in the United States.\n\nPresident Emilio Aguinaldo\n\nGeneral Emilio Aguinaldo, a leader of the Katipunan in the province of Cavite, went on to become the undisputed head of the Philippine Revolution.

He resigned in 1906 and was subsequently elected as a member of the new Philippine Assembly. He served in this capacity as founding Speaker until his election to the Senate in 1922.\n\nWhile in exile with Quezon, he succeeded as President of the Commonwealth upon the latter’s death in 1944. He famously “returned” to the country with General Douglas MacArthur and worked towards the rehabilitation of our war-torn country.\n\nPresident Jose P.

Marcos in the late 1970’S.\n\nThe mansion was restored by British designer Ronnie Laing and antique dealer Viring de Asis in 1975 and used as a guest house to receive visiting dignitaries of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. After EDSA I, the mansion remained unused and inaccessible to the public."
