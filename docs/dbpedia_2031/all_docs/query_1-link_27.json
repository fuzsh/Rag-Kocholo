He served as the governor of Cebu from 1904 to 1907 and then became the first Speaker of the Philippine Congress and so far the only Cebuano who became president, when he succeeded Don Manuel Quezon when the latter died on August 1, 1944.\n\nDon Sergio married twice. His first wife was Estefania Chiong Veloso who produced the following children: Vicenta, Nicasio, Milagros, Edilberto (who married a Veloso.
