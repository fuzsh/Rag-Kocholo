To them, I owe a great deal for sharing their knowledge, time, and expertise to a fledgling student from the Philippines. During my doctoral studies at the University of Southern California, I had the opportunity to further hone my intellectual skills under the able guidance of the following professors: John E. Wills, Jr. expanded my knowledge on Chinese history and encouraged my study on the Chinese diaspora, while excellently serving as my main dissertation advisor; my other dissertation committee members Charlotte Furth and Eugene Cooper, aside from contributing to my knowledge on Chinese Studies, introduced me to the theoretical issues of family, class, gender, race, and nation through the graduate courses I took with them; and Lon Kurashige and Soo-Young Chin guided me to read on historiographical isues and works in Asian American Studies that have helped shape my research questions and methodology. Finally, Michael Salman at University of California, Los Angeles exposed me to a wide range of works in Philippine history and historiography. To all of them, I am deeply grateful and indebted for training me as a historian. Funding for my research and writing came from various sources: a University of Southern California dissertation fellowship from the Ahmanson Foundation; the Program for International Cooperation, Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain, Manila, Philippines; the Hanes Fellowship, History Department, University of Southern California; the China Times Cultural Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan; the Liong Tek Tong Fraternity, Manila; the Chin-Ben See Memorial Fund, Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, Inc., Manila; two summer visiting research fellowships from The Centre for Intercultural Studies, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines; a Research and Curriculum Enhancement Leave from the History Department at University of Massachusetts at Amherst; and a Dean’s Research Grant and a Faculty Research Grant from the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Without their\n\nxvi\n\nacknowledgments\n\ngenerous support the research, writing, and the completion of this book would not have been possible. I would also like to thank the staff of following archives, libraries, and institutions both in the United States and abroad: the University of Southern California libraries; the W.E.B. Du Bois library at University of Massachusetts at Amherst; the libraries of the Five Colleges, Inc.; the National Archives and Records Administration; the Family History Centers in Los Angeles and Oakland; the Genealogical Society of Utah in Salt Lake City; the Rizal Library of the Ateneo de Manila University; the American Historical Collection of Ateneo’s Rizal Library; the Miguel de Benavides Library of the University of Santo Tomas, Manila; the libraries of University of the Philippines Diliman; the National Historical Institute of the Philippines; the National Library of the Philippines; and the archives office of Quanzhou, Fujian. Special thanks go to Mercedita Servida of the Lopez Library Collections at the Lopez Memorial Museum, Manila; Gemma Boja, Meah See, and Liza Alcayde of Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, Inc.; Lulu del Mar of the Spanish Archives at the Archives of the University of Santo Tomas, Manila; Lea de la Paz and Bernie Sobremonte of the Archives of the Archbishop of Manila; Rowena Relator and Marvic Mendoza of the Record Management and Archives Office, Manila; Fe Tiangco of The Centre for Intercultural Studies, University of Santo Tomas, Manila; and Melvin Thatcher of the Genealogical Society at Utah. Administrators and colleagues at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Five Colleges Inc. have in different ways facilitated the transformation of my doctoral dissertation into a book. In terms of funding for research and travel, the offices of Lee Edwards and Joel Martin, former and current deans, respectively, of the College of the Humanities and Fine Arts at University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Paul Kostecki, Vice Provost for Research at University of Massachusetts at Amherst; and Lorna Peterson, former director of the Five Colleges, Inc. have all provided crucial support. I would also like to thank the following friends and colleagues for their help as I navigate and balance the demands of teaching and research: Audrey Altstadt, David Glassberg, Mary Wilson, Richard Minear, Sigrid Schmalzer, Nate Therien, Joshua Roth, Lili Kim, Floyd Cheung, Kimberly Chang, C.N. Le, Milianne Kang, Karen Cardozo, Jerry Dennerline, and Rick Millington. Through the writing of the doctoral dissertation and of the book, I have benefitted from the input and feedback of the following individu-\n\nacknowledgments\n\nxvii\n\nals: Ling Shiao, John Williams, Allison Rottman, Eugenio Menegon, Andrew Wilson, Adam McKeown, Lok Siu, Teresita Ang See, Go Bon Juan, Michael Salman, Cynthia Luz Rivera, Nicanor Tiongson, Rene Javellana, Dai Yifeng, and Paul Kramer. Through the years I have also benefitted from the intellectual stimulation and friendships with members of the following groups and organizations: Critical Filipina and Filipino Studies Collective; Philippine Palimpsests; Asian-Pacific American Studies Certificate Program, Five Colleges, Inc.; Crossroads in the Study of the Americas (CISA), Five Colleges, Inc.; Inter-Asian Political Cultures faculty seminar, Five Colleges, Inc.; and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst Asian and Asian-American Studies Program. The completion of my book would not have been possible with the valuable contribution of the following research assistants: Devin Fitzgerald, Jennifer Kleinman, Luis Loya Garcia, Qian Jin, Kai Yu, and Lou Depita. Over the years I have come to appreciate not only the research assistance, but also the friendships of the following: Rose Mendoza, Danna Santiago, Tina Bernabe, and Marpa Maria Cleofe. In the course of my research I have had the great pleasure and fortune to meet the following individuals who have generously shared their own family histories and provided important photos: Raul Boncan and Barbara Pratt, Josephine M.T. Khu, and the family of Rony and Lolita Lutanco. I am also grateful to the following for granting permission to use some of the images and illustrations found in the book: Philippine Free Press, The Geronimo Berenguer de los Reyes, Jr. Foundation, Inc. (GBR Foundation); José Maria A. Cariño and Sonia Pinto Ner; Alfred W. McCoy; and Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, Inc. My thanks also goes to Don Sluter for the maps and to Trinidad Linares for copyediting. Likewise, my gratitude goes to the anonymous readers of the manuscript, whose careful reading and insightful comments have aided me in revising the manuscript. All errors found in this book are my sole responsibility. It was indeed fortuitous that at one of the Association for Asian Studies conferences I met Matt Kawecki, Acquisitions Editor in Asian Studies at Brill-Boston. He, Katelyn Chin, and Mike Mozina have provided the much needed support and guidance to see this project through. To the editors of the “Chinese Overseas History, Literature, and Society” series at Brill; namely, Wang Gungwu, Evelyn HuDeHart, David Der-wei, and Wang Wong Siu-lun, I thank you for the support you have given to this project.\n\nxviii\n\nacknowledgments\n\nI would also like to thank the various coffee houses in Los Angeles, Berkeley, Manila, Western Massachusetts, and Boston in which I spent hours sipping coffee while writing my manuscript. In one’s life there are always a number of special men and women whom one meets and from whom one receives the spiritual nourishment to one’s soul. Nerissa Balce, Fidelito Cortes, Jeffrey Santa Ana, Greg Mullins, Amy Martin, Dan Weinbaum, Paula Chakravarty, Gianpaolo Baoicchi, Asha Nadkarni, Jason Moralee, Jessica Delgado, Daniel Rivers, Dayo Gore, Norma Akamatsu, Ryan Joo, Laurence Breiner, and Larry Hunt have all made my life richer with their friendships. To Eugenio Menegon and John Leupold I cherish the years spent together. My career as a historian and my interest in the Chinese diaspora would not have been made possible without the support and encouragement of the late Edgar Wickberg. His work on the Chinese in the Philippines and Chinese diaspora continues to inspire and guide me as a scholar. It is indeed my deep regret that he had not lived long enough to see the publication of this work, which has greatly benefitted from the path he had set forth. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family: my sisters Nelly, Julie, Caroline, Mona, Gina, and Lisa, and my nephews, nieces, and brothers-in-law. One cannot ask for a more loving family than the one I have. Their love, encouragement, and support have sustained me over these years living abroad carving out a life and career. To our father Go Tian Hua and our mother Agustina T. Chu: even if fate had taken you away so soon, your memory continues to live in our hearts. This book is lovingly dedicated to both of you.\n\nA NOTE ON THE CHINESE TERMS The Chinese terms found in this book are either from Hokkien (Minnanhua) or putonghua. The decision on whether to use the Hokkien or putonghua version is mainly based on sources. For example, if a word or name appears in a document using the Hokkien Romanization of a Chinese term, then that version is used. If deemed useful, the putonghua or Hokkien equivalent of the term is provided. The romanization of Hokkien words is based on the Chinese-English dictionary of the vernacular or spoken language of Amoy, with the principal variations of the Chang-chew and Chin-chew dialects by Carstairs Douglas (1873) as well as the Taiwen-Putonghua dictionary (http://203.64.42.21/ iug/ungian/SoannTeng/chil/taihoa.asp).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTO BE A “FILIPINO” AND “CHINESE” IN THE PHILIPPINES Introduction “Pero hindi ka Pilipino, Intsik ka.”1 “But you’re not Filipino, you’re Intsik.”\n\nUttered my college classmate as a rejoinder after I started a sentence referring to myself as “Filipino.” To be an “Intsik” (引叔) meant, and still does today, being “Chinese.” Hearing his words was both a jarring and crystallizing moment for me. Two years into a private Catholic university in Manila, I was relishing the experience of meeting new people coming from different high schools around the Philippines. Prior to college, I had been educated for thirteen years at Xavier School, an all-boys Catholic “Chinese” school, where I grew up thinking that I was a “Filipino.” For who would not? Every Monday morning, we all had to line up in the gymnasium where the Filipino flag was displayed, recite the “Panatang Makabayan” (Patriotic Oath) and sing the Philippine national anthem.2 In our classrooms we learned about Philippine 1 This term is mostly used colloquially by Filipinos to refer to the “Chinese.” This word could have come from the Minnan word in-chek, which means “his uncle.” For more information, see World News, 22 December 2002. 2 PANATANG MAKABAYAN Iniibig ko ang Pilipinas Ito ang aking lupang sinilangan Ito ang tahanan ng aking lahi Ako’y kanyang kinukupkop at tinutulungan Upang maging malakas, maligaya at kapakipakinabang Bilang ganti, diringgin ko ang payo ng aking mga magulang Susundin ko ang mga tuntunin ng aking paaralan Tutuparin ko ang mga tungkulin ng isang mamamayang makabayan at masunurin sa batas Paglilingkuran ko ang aking bayan nang walang pag-iimbot at ng buong katapatan Sisikapin kong maging isang tunay na Pilipino Sa isip, sa salita, at sa gawa\n\nPATRIOTIC OATH I love the Philippines This is the land of my birth, the home of my race She has sheltered and helped me to become strong, happy, and productive\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nhistory, national heroes, government, cultures, values, society, etc.3 My Xavier classmates and I enjoyed Filipino movies and spoke, aside from English or Hokkien (the language spoken in the southeastern part of Fujian; transliterated from 褔建 or “Fujian” in putonghua or Mandarin), Tagalog (the language used in Manila and outlying provinces, and on which the official language “Filipino” is mainly based) to each other everyday. At home, my family and I watched the Philippine Basketball Association games and rooted for our favorite team just like everybody else. Whenever I filled out any application form inquiring about my citizenship, I never second thought about putting down “Filipino.” Therefore, it was jarring to be told that I was not one. Nor did I ever hear anyone said to me before: “Intsik ka.” To be sure, I had by then also identified myself as a “Chinese,” having been born to ethnic Chinese parents, or heard other people say that I was “Chinese.” But seldom had I heard anyone else call me “Intsik,” much less apply the word directly to me. The label carries negative connotations, and is commonly used within the context of criticizing, making snide remarks, or expressing curiosity about the Intsik. So when my classmate jokingly used this epithet to refer to me, I felt stung. But it was a crystallizing moment for me too, for it was then that I began to notice and realize that I had been living in a world in which there was an ethnic divide between “Filipinos” and “Chinese.” Before going to college, my classmates and I—mostly ethnic Chinese—were “sheltered” from interacting much with the wider society. Though I grew up hearing distinctions being made between us the lán-lâng (咱人; a Hokkien word to mean literally “our own people” to refer to the ethnic Chinese in the Philippines) and the hoan-á (番仔; a Hokkien word to refer to the Filipinos), it was not later in my young adult life that I learned that hoan-á meant “foreign barbarian.” Whenever I In return, I shall heed the advice of my parents, follow the rules of my school, and fulfill the duties of a patriotic and law-abiding citizen I shall serve my country unreservedly and loyally I shall strive to be a genuine Filipino in thought, word, and deed I would like to thank Ari Dy and Nemesio Dormiendo for their assistance in providing additional details and translations to the oath. 3 In 1974, the Philippine government under then President Ferdinand Marcos issued a decree calling for the “Filipinization” of all Chinese schools, which, among other provisions, effectively reduced the number of hours teaching Chinese-related subjects from half a day to one hour a day, and passed on the ownership and administration of “Chinese schools” solely to Filipino citizens (see Conclusion).\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n3\n\nspoke in Tagalog instead of Hokkien, my elders would call me hoan-á gōng (番仔戆; stupid foreign barbarian) (see Chu 2001). Young children in the “Chinese” community were often reminded to speak lánlâng ōe (咱人話; lit. “the language of our people,” or more precisely, Hokkien); encouraged to have lán-lâng friends; and silently or openly admonished not to marry a hoan-á. Moreover, they were reprimanded if they were seen as adopting the hoan-á thai (番仔態) or the “attitude (or ways) of the foreign barbarian.” A hoan-á was supposed to be lazy and spendthrift, while a lán-lâng hardworking and frugal. Needless to say, we lán-lângs were supposed to be better than them hoan-ás. Yet while my own parents imparted such views to my siblings and me they behaved in ways that contradicted their words. They socialized with “Filipinos,” spending time together with their Filipino comadres and compadres (Spanish words for godmothers or godfathers of one’s children, respectively) and my father’s business associates and their wives, playing mah-jong, bowling, golf, or attending each other’s parties. My father even once considered changing our surname to one of my godfather’s surname—Zapanta—instead of what I use now—Chu. At home, we ate “Filipino” as much as we ate “Chinese” food, and celebrated Christmas and Easter just as most Filipinos did. Furthermore, even when my parents exhorted us to speak Hokkien, they often spoke to my younger siblings and me in Tagalog. Although I had been aware of an ethnic division between the hoan-á and the lán-lâng growing up in Manila, I still considered myself as “Filipino,” and the land of my birth as the Philippines. It took a ribbing from a “Filipino” classmate, a face-to-face encounter with a “Filipino” telling me that I was not “Filipino,” and within a university context in which ethnic Chinese Filipinos like myself were a “minority,” for me to realize that not only did we lán-lângs see the Filipinos apart, but that “Filipinos” also see us as different. As I became more aware through my personal experiences of this separation between the Filipinos and Chinese, I also began to notice how this division was being played out in the wider society. During a spate of kidnappings involving Chinese victims in the early 1990s, an indifferent Philippine government gave these cases low priority, in contrast to its quick response to solving cases involving the abduction of American or Japanese nationals (Ang See 1997a, 173). Furthermore, in newspapers one would sometimes find articles critical of the “Chinese,” accusing them of being loyal only to their economic interests and to\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nChina. This happened, for instance, when certain Chinese businessmen were linked to former Philippine president Joseph Estrada who was removed from office in 2001 on charges of corruption and cronyism (cf. The Philippine Star, 21 February 1999; The Philippine Daily Inquirer, 21 February 2000). At times, articles written about the “Chinese” in the Philippines could display even more vehement and hostile attitudes toward them, telling the “Chinese” to go back to China (cf. Ang See 1997a, 37). Thus started my quest to understand the dichotomy that I see in Philippine society. Why do such divisions exist between the “Chinese” and the “Filipinos”? What is the source of Chinese prejudices against Filipinos, and vice-versa? Why, for example, do many Chinese still exhibit a strong adverse reaction to intermarriage between Chinese and Filipinos, especially when this involves their own children? When I use the term “Chinese” here I am referring to those whose families migrated almost en toto to the Philippines prior to or right after 1949, and whose families therefore had been in the country for more than three generations. More precisely, I refer to those who self-identify as ethnically “Chinese,” although they may have been born and raised in the Philippines, have Filipino citizenship, and are also viewed by “Filipinos” as “Chinese” or “Intsik.” They also retain to some extent the practice of “Chinese” customs, such as ancestral worship or the observance of certain Chinese funerary rites; speak or understand Hokkien to some extent; and marry endogamously. Their children often attend one of the several “Chinese” schools in the Philippines, and still carry a Chinese name apart from a “Filipino” one. Therefore, when using this term I am not particularly referring (although they will be mentioned in this book) to families who, while descended from “Chinese” ancestors and decidedly bear “Chinese” surnames, consider themselves and are generally considered by the majority of the population of the Philippines, including the “Chinese,” as “Filipino,” such as the Tantocos, the Cojuangcos, or the Lichaucos. This also excludes the more recent migrants from China who began arriving in the Philippines in the 1980s up to the present—those who lived through or grew up in Communist China after 1949. The “Chinese” that this book refers to are the 1.0 to 1.2 percent of the total population in the Philippines of roughly 94 million (circa 2009), which would then place their number at 940,000 to 1,128,000, although these estimates are by-and-large unofficial (cf. Ang See 1997a, 40).\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n5\n\nHistorical Works on the Chinese in the Philippines In my quest for answers to my questions, I started reading Edgar Wickberg’s groundbreaking work The Chinese in Philippine Life, 1850–1898 ([1965] 2000). To date, this brilliant study remains the most influential book on the history of the Chinese in the Philippines. In Chinese in Philippine Life, Wickberg looks for ways to explain the division between “Chinese” and “Filipinos” in contemporary Philippine society. As he states in his introduction, to understand present-day Chinese-Filipino ethnic relations it is important to examine the history of the Chinese and the Chinese mestizos from 1850 to 1898 for the following reasons: 1) this period saw the increase in the number of “Chinese” in the Philippines; 2) in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the Chinese in the Philippines began to resort to communalism as a response to the rising tide of local anti-Chinese sentiments in the 1880s and 1890s, as well as to the rising proto-nationalism in China; and 3) it was during this period that the Chinese mestizos, who descended from intermarriages between Chinese men and local women, began to be identified or identify themselves with the indios, the latter comprising the majority of the local population, and with whom the former shared a similar “Hispanicized” and “Catholic” heritage. As a result, when the United States colonized the Philippines in 1898 and nationalized citizenship by dividing its colonial subjects into either “Filipino” or “non-Filipino/ alien,” departing from the earlier three-way ethno-legal classificatory system of “sangley (refers to the Chinese)-Chinese mestizo-indio” of the Spanish colonial period, it seems only logical that the Chinese were categorized or chose to categorize themselves as “Chinese” (thus “aliens”), while the Chinese mestizos, along with the indio majority, as “Filipino.” Further evidence of Chinese mestizo identification with the wider “Filipino” community could also be seen in their broad and significant involvement in the reformist and revolutionary movements in the late nineteenth century that planted the seed of “Filipino” nationalism and led to the creation of the Philippine nation-state (Wickberg 1964; Tan 1985). This would help explain, among other things, why the Tantocos, the Cojuangcos, or other families who trace their lineage to earlier Chinese immigrants, are now “Filipinos.” Following Wickberg’s pioneering study, other scholars took up where he left off in his study of the Chinese in the Philippines. For instance, Antonio Tan’s The Chinese in the Philippines, 1898–1935 (1972) examines how during the American colonial period the “Chinese” in the\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nPhilippines, imbued with rising Chinese nationalistic consciousness, established the institutions, organs, and organizations that increasingly made them a “Chinese” community both separate from the larger “Filipino” society and more closely identified with their “mother” country China.4 In their approaches to the study of the history of the Chinese in the Philippines, Wickberg (at least in his earlier works) and Tan were primarily concerned with the question of how the Chinese in the Philippines would and could “fit” within the national Filipino polity. As a result, their works share with other studies of “overseas Chinese” communities (e.g., Cushman and Wang 1988; Purcell 1965; Suryadinata 1997) the same approach of using earlier sociological and anthropological theories of ethnicity—theories that are based on the concepts of assimilation and integration and often tied-up with nation-based metanarratives. In these discourses ethnic identities are often reified and essentialized, and couched in the language of inclusion and exclusion.5 Recent works in cultural studies, however, have shown such ethnic constructions to be the modus operandi by which national governments and other dominant groups seek to control others. Theorists of nationalism (e.g., Anderson 1991; Alonso 1994; Chatterjee 1993; Eley and Suny 1996; Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983) have also demonstrated how governments and their leaders have invented, imagined, or constructed many contemporary ethnic classifications in order to unite a large number of people from diverse backgrounds within a territorialized state. In the case of China, reformist leaders and intellectuals such as Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei began in the latter part of the 1800s, when faced with the prospect of the country being “cut up like a melon” by foreign (European, American, and Japanese) aggressors, to launch a movement to save and unite their “mother country.” Consequently, this led to constructions of a homogeneous “Chinese” culture, race, and civilization within a defined territorial and national space. Moreover, in the process of establishing China as a modern nation, Chinese leaders created a “cultural” China to go along with 4 Tan also published a book on the Chinese during the Japanese occupation (1981). There is a gap therefore, in terms of chronological order, of studies focusing on the Chinese in the Philippines during the Commonwealth Period, or roughly from 1935 to 1942. 5 Other works on the Chinese in the Philippines, whether focusing on their past or present, also tend to use similar frameworks (e.g., Ang See 1997a; Liu 1964; Chen 1998.)\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n7\n\na “political” China, i.e., defining certain characteristics that made its people “Chinese.” Simultaneously, the Chinese government started reaching out to the “overseas Chinese,” appealing to their patriotic sentiments, and encouraging their identification with “China.” While the construction of this “imagined community” with an invented history, race, and civilization may have provided China and “overseas Chinese” communities today with a form of unity to achieve status and power in the world and within their “local” communities, respectively, it has also engendered ethnic divisions and tensions by reifying and essentializing ethnic identities into oppositional binaries of an “Us” versus “Them.”6 As a result, in studies on “overseas Chinese,” not only are such communities often depicted as one homogeneous group distinct from a larger similarly homogenized majority population in their “host” countries, but also is their “Chinese-ness” often described as part of a timeless and universal “Chinese” culture, discrete and separate from that of the majority population. Contemporary journalists, popular writers, and even academics can thus use these “Chinese” cultural traits such as familism, guanxi (networking) particularism, a superior work ethic, and adherence to certain “Confucian” values to explain the economic “success” of “overseas Chinese” communities. However, these “self-important tracts” and “neo-Confucian triumphalist visions” are also used to extol the superiority of “Chinese” culture over the “West,” or over that of the local “host” society, leading to a type of “cultural chauvinism” that reinscribes the “Orientalist binary oppositions of East versus West,” or, in countries where these diasporic communities are found, of the “Chinese” versus “non-Chinese” (cf. Ong and Nonini 1997, 8–9). Moreover, by calling these communities “overseas Chinese” or “Chinese overseas,” the use of “overseas” inevitably results in installing China as the “primal source and center, the Middle Kingdom, fons et erigo of ‘Chinese culture’ ” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 9). Consequently, these “overseas Chinese” can be regarded as part of a “Greater China”—whether politically, economically, or culturally (see Gold 1993; Harding 1993; Shambaugh 1993; Yahuda\n\n6 Taking the cue from these theorists, many scholars of modern Chinese history (e.g., Crossley 1989, 1990a and 1990b; Duara 1995; Gladney 1991; Honig 1992) as well as those of Philippine history (Ileto 1979 and 1998; McKenna 1998) have begun to question and deconstruct the administrative, ideological, and religious classificatory systems used by the colonial rulers and the nationalist governments of China and the Philippines.\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\n1993; Wang 1993)—so that, while such a mythic world can benefit those who strive to create and live within it (e.g., enabling the Beijing government to tap its “overseas compatriots” to invest in China), it can also lead the majority population of nations with a significant minority ethnic Chinese population to suspect the loyalty of the latter. Several scholars have thus offered alternative theoretical frameworks for the study of “overseas Chinese” communities. One such approach is to use the word “diaspora” instead of “overseas.” The use of “diaspora” would instead emphasize and describe the connections, links, and flows that characterized the experiences of these Chinese in “modern” times, as well as their flexible, border crossing practices to elude, overcome, or manipulate the efforts of modernizing nationstates or of other dominant groups to localize them into disciplinable subjects (McKeown 1999; Ong and Nonini 1997). In such an approach “Chinese” identity, instead of being culturally deterministic, is viewed as part of a “discursive trope” that is constantly “cast and recast by both Chinese and by Westerners” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 9). Among diasporic Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, what it means to be “Chinese” is best understood by examining how European and American colonial powers, modern nation-states, and other “regimes of truth and power” attempted or attempt to define, categorize, and therefore control the Chinese, and how the diasporic Chinese colluded or collude with as well as acted or act “obliquely to them, and systematically set out to transgress the shifting boundaries set by [such regimes]” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 20). This way, we can veer from nation-based approaches to the study of ethnic identities of Chinese diasporic communities; rescue their “histor(ies) from the nation”; and understand what “Chinese-ness” means in different and specific historical contexts (see Duara 1995). Accordingly, my work takes its inspiration from other studies dealing with modern Chinese transnationalism, including those found in the edited volume Ungrounded Empires: The Cultural Politics of Modern Chinese Transnationalism (Ong and Nonini 1997) that ground the study of diasporic Chinese within a period in history distinguished by an increasing “mobility of people, commodities, ideas, and capital” (see also McKeown 2001; Hsu 2000). Consequently, “modern Chinese transnationalism” is referred to as a kind of “third culture” that has arisen out of the “new transnational economic processes that transcend the porous political boundaries of nation-states even as they now penetrate them” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 11). Seeking to study\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n9\n\nthis phenomenon, the several essays found in this volume focus on “the ways in which people’s everyday lives are transformed by the effects of global capitalism, how their own agencies are implicated in the making of these effects, and the social relationships in which these agencies are embedded” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 13). Moreover, they study how, in their “multifaceted and shifting experiences,” the diasporic Chinese “liv(e) under, yet (rework), the conditions of flexibility” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 12). The acquisition of multiple citizenships, the dispersion of family members in different countries, the adoption of hybrid identities, becoming “astronauts”—these are just some examples of how modern Chinese transnationals engage in flexible and bordercrossing strategies to “elude,” “take tactical advantage of,” “temporize,” “redefine,” and “overcome the “disciplinings of modern regimes of colonial empires, postcolonial nation-states, and international capitalism” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 19). The roots of modern Chinese transnationalism can also be traced to the time of “premodern trade systems, European colonialism, and more recent American geopolitical domination of the Pacific” (Ong and Nonini 1997, 12). Therefore, one contribution of this book is found in its focus on an earlier period that would provide a historical context to understand today’s modern Chinese transnational practices. Recently, Andrew Wilson published a study that not only examines the history of the Chinese in the Philippines during colonial times, but also “salvage(s) the history of the (Philippine) Chinese . . . from the nationalist historiography of both China and the Philippines” that tends to cast these people either as “loyal Chinese” or “disloyal Filipinos” (2004, 7). He describes the various flexible strategies that Chinese merchant elites deployed—strategies that displayed their “liminal virtuosity”—in playing with their identities to suit local conditions and to achieve their ambitions. While the time period and the subjects discussed in Wilson’s book overlap with mine, Chinese and Chinese Mestizos diverges from Wilson’s book in fundamentally different and important ways. First, my book focuses not only on the Chinese, but also on the Chinese mestizo population in colonial Manila. Second, my research also takes inspiration from works in cultural anthropology (e.g., Leonard 1992; Oxfeld 1993) that investigate closely the everyday socio-economic practices of families and individuals, especially from marginalized and ethnic minority communities, as a way to discuss their ethnicity, while Wilson’s book is primarily interested in merchantelite political activism and not in identity construction and negotiation.\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nSince imagining communities or the invention of tradition involves the construction of a “cultural” identity to go with “political” identities and loyalties, I am interested in examining how such cultural markers were created and reified, and how individuals, whether singly or as members of their families or “communities,” contested or negotiated these. After the path-breaking work of Fredrik Barth (1969), theorists of ethnicity have pointed out that the study of ethnicity needs to take into consideration not only how groups have been identified by others, but how members of these groups view themselves in relation to others, since ethnic identities also are self-ascriptive (e.g., Cohen 1978). Works that aim to challenge the nation-based ethnic identifications of “ethnic minorities” by focusing on the socio-cultural practices of members of these “groups” provide not only a more complex and sophisticated understanding of “identity,” but also agency to the people they study (e.g., Ong and Nonini 1997; Leonard 1992; Oxfeld 1993). Such an approach also invariably leads to studies that are micro-historical, focusing on the life stories and daily practices of specific individuals or families, and how these present us with meanings of “identity” that differ from—and therefore that challenge—the essentialized and reified versions of ethnic identifications dominant groups create. Studies like those of Wickberg and Tan, which approach the study of ethnic identities from a macro-historical perspective, tend to gloss over or simply neglect the daily practices of individuals that can provide us with variegated and constantly changing meanings of identities.7 Following the lead of these works on modern Chinese transnationalism and in cultural anthropology, Chinese and Chinese Mestizos will examine the commercial and familial practices of Chinese merchants and their families from the late Spanish to the early American colonial periods. In studying some of the flexible and border-crossing commercial or business practices of Chinese merchants and their families in late Spanish and American colonial Manila, I aim to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) to complement or veer away from earlier studies inclined to focus on the Chinese merchant community as part of a separate ethnic\n\n7 Another work called Indio to Filipino seems to indicate a study focusing on the ethnogenesis of identities in the Philippines, but an examination of it only explains how the word “Filipino” was originally used during the Spanish colonial period to refer to Spanish individuals born in the Philippines. Furthermore, its discussion on “mestizos” mainly refers to “Spanish mestizos,” and not Chinese mestizos who are the subjects of this study (Abella 1970s).\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n11\n\nenclave, with little or no interaction with other ethnic groups; and 2) to describe their practices not as part of a culturally deterministic “Chinese” way of doing business, but as part of their tactical and strategic ways to evade, manipulate, or collaborate with hegemonic efforts to control their bodies, identities, families, movements, and resources. Furthermore, in focusing on their everyday and socio-cultural practices, I am able to look more intimately at how people identified themselves. If Wickberg was right in saying that Chinese mestizos during the Spanish colonial period were a “special kind of Filipino” (i.e., to mean that they identified with their “Hispanic” and “Christian” and “rejected their “Chinese” heritage), what then, did that exactly mean within the context of individuals’ experiences, particularly those who belonged to families that were “bi-ethnic”? In this regard my work is influenced by Karen Leonard’s pioneering study (1992) of Punjabi-Mexican families in Imperial Valley, California. In examining how “culture” was transmitted in these bi-ethnic families, and in reconstituting family histories, Leonard is able to demonstrate how “ethnic markers and boundaries were contested and negotiated within marriages, within families, throughout the history of this social group” (1992, 13). And, in emphasizing how the individuals and family life processes, i.e., micro-level processes, interacted with the political economy, she is able to show how ethnicity is constructed and what it means “to people across time, space, and context” (Leonard 1992, 14). Following her lead, Chinese and Chinese Mestizos is, at heart, a social history that is interested in examining—borrowing Leonard’s term—the “ethnic choices” made by these Chinese merchants as well as by their families in late colonial Manila within the historical specificities of their times. In this study, I aim to demonstrate how these individuals and their families negotiated, contested, or colluded in the creation of “Chinese” and “Filipino” identities—and by extension, families—in contemporary Filipino society. Lastly, my book participates in recent works in post-colonial and empire studies such as Michael Salman’s The Embarrassment of Slavery (2001) and Paul Kramer’s The Blood of Government (2006) that are critical of the role of the United States (U.S.) colonial regime in creating a Philippine nation-state that benefited or continues to benefit certain groups while marginalizing and oppressing others. Past studies on the Chinese in the Philippines focusing on the American colonial period (e.g., Tan 1985; Wilson 2004; Wong 1999) often tend to either regard the period as a “golden era” for the Chinese, since American economic\n\n12\n\nintroduction\n\npolicies supposedly allowed them better opportunities to increase their wealth, or neglect to cast a more critical eye on how American colonization of the Philippines marginalized the Chinese. However, my work will provide a needed balance to this historiography by demonstrating how American colonial rule in the Philippines (along with Filipino and Chinese nationalisms) contributed significantly to the creation of an ethnic divide between the Chinese and the Filipinos, which did not necessarily outweigh the economic benefits the former enjoyed as a result of American colonialism. The hypothesis I am setting forth therefore in this book is this: that in the examination of the domestic and everyday practices of Chinese merchants and their families in the Philippines, and focusing on their “border-crossing” and “flexible” practices, we can gain better insights into the “ethnogenesis” of “Filipino” and “Chinese” identities in the Philippines. As efforts by different dominant hegemonic groups and increasing competition from rising capitalism in the Philippines and in the region sought to curtail, limit, and constrain their bodies and resources, Chinese merchant families in Manila, with their commercial and familial connections to Minnan, simultaneously negotiated such outside forces and interventions through a variety of familial and economic practices. Such practices included, among other things, switching their identities and playing with multiple ones in ways that were often asymmetrical and different from those constructed by dominant groups designed to localize them. Furthermore, in the accumulation of wealth for these diasporic families such flexible practices often involved the creation of their own familial “regime of truth and power” that controlled and oppressed members of their family, including the young, the women, and the poor (Ong 1998, 135–9). The period that I seek to focus on is from the 1860s to the 1930s. There are both phenomenological and practical reasons for this. In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, ethno-legal classifications under the Spanish colonial period for tax purposes were constructed three-ways: sangley, Chinese mestizo, and indio. The rise of a Chinese mestizo class in Philippines, especially in the urban areas, was a product of various socio-historical and economic forces, among which was the role that the Catholic Church had played in encouraging, first, Christian conversion among the Chinese, and second, intermarriages between these converts and local Philippine women. The goal was to create in Binondo (a district in Manila) a community of Chinese merchant-families whose members would help the\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n13\n\nCatholic Church’s missionary efforts in China (including Taiwan) once they were converted to the faith. Consequently, scholars often take into account when studying the ethnicity of the Chinese and their descendants both state and church classifications (e.g., Sugaya 2000; Wickberg [1965] 2000). In such an approach, Wickberg was the first one to advance the thesis that, Chinese mestizos primarily identified with their “Hispanic” and “Catholic” culture (and in fact were the most “Hispanicized” and “Catholic” among the Spanish subjects) and “rejected” their Chinese heritage. Their Catholic Chinese fathers, on the other hand, were often accused by Spanish missionaries as “bad” and “insincere” converts, who maintained their “heathen” ways such as engaging in polygamy and the practice of other “pagan” beliefs, and apostatized upon returning to China. Furthermore, as mentioned above, they were beginning to see themselves as a “community” in the midst of a growing proto-nationalism in China and of anti-Chinese sentiments in the Philippines. Partly because of his macro-historical approach to the study of ethnic identity formation in Philippine society, especially in urban centers such as Manila where there were significant numbers of Chinese, Chinese mestizos, and indios living together, and partly because of his use of earlier assimilationist theories on the study of ethnic identities, Wickberg could only paint in broad strokes what it meant to be “sangley,” “Chinese,” “mestizo,” or “Catholic” back then. In such an approach to the study of ethnic identity construction and formation, his definition of the “Chinese mestizo” as a “special kind of Filipino” to explain why today descendants of Chinese merchant families in urban areas are now considered as “Filipinos” makes sense. But herein lay the main differences between Chinese and Chinese Mestizos and Wickberg’s Chinese in Philippine Life. First, my book is primarily interested in “first-generation” Chinese mestizos, while Wickberg’s focuses on “Chinese mestizos” in general. Second, while Wickberg’s study ends in 1898, mine ends in the 1930s, just right after the beginning of the Commonwealth government and right before the Japanese occupation in the Philippines. I chose to bookend my work with, on the one hand, the period in which an increasing number of Chinese migrated to the Philippines under the more liberal emigration laws of China and due to other factors, and on the other, the time when the number of “Chinese” families in the country began to rise due to the increasing political instabilities in China and in Fujian, the province from where most Chinese trace their ancestral land. In choosing to focus on this timeframe, I am arguing in this book that during the\n\n14\n\nintroduction\n\nperiod under study, ethnic categories are better understood as flowing along a shifting and problematic continuum. Several factors interacting with one another would eventually give rise to the construction of dichotomous and oppositional political as well as cultural “Chinese” and “Filipino” identities that we see in Philippine society today. These factors included American racial and anti-Chinese policies (building upon earlier Spanish colonial ones) set within the context of American imperial ambitions; Filipino and Chinese nationalisms (the latter pertaining to both China and the Philippines); and other local and regional factors such as the diminished role that Catholic conversion played in the creation of “loyal” and “faithful” citizens, or the growing economic and political instabilities in China that rendered moving back and forth between China and the Philippines more difficult and dangerous, thereby leading to the creation of more “Chinese” families in the Philippines. The combination of these factors also caused the long-standing practice of intermarriages or consensual unions between “Chinese” men and local women in the Philippines, including the practice of bigamy or polygamy that wealthy Chinese merchants practiced at the time, and that gave rise to “Chinese mestizos,” to become more and more rare and taboo in a society that learned and adopted nation-based, thus territorialized, and modern “pure-based” notions of ethnic identities.8 Consequently, a Filipino’s recollection of a pig-tailed or female “Chinese” ancestor in the not-too-distant past becomes the stuff of family lore long forgotten, or, at best, relegated to the dustbin of history. And among “Chinese” families, “Chinese” racial purity within the family and lineage should be maintained as much as possible, and “Filipinos” only to be regarded as friends, business associates, as the “Other” that one should not aspire to become like, much less become part of one’s own.\n\n8 While other scholars have conducted studies dealing specifically with the marriage practices, culture, and identities of the “Chinese” and their families, they primarily focus on the post-World War II period (Chen 1998; Amyot 1973; Omohundro 1981; Reynolds 1998; Dannhaeuser 2004; Cheong 1983; Zarco 1966). Furthermore, except for Hodder 1996, these studies still subscribe to integrationist and assimilationist approaches that framed the studies of earlier works.\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n15\n\nMethodology and Sources The method used for this study is basically ethnographic, reconstructing and reconstituting individual and family life stories as well as describing particular everyday commercial and domestic practices. However, because of the historical nature of the study, the “fieldwork” done was primarily in the archives, especially those found in Manila. For the part of my study dealing with the Spanish colonial period, three archives were utilized; namely, the Record Management and Archives Office (RMAO, formerly known as the Philippine National Archives); the Archives of the Archdiocese of Manila (AAM); and the Archivo de la Universidad de Santo Tomas (AUST)—all of which hold huge volumes of hitherto unused or underutilized records pertaining to the Chinese and the Chinese mestizos. From the RMAO, I examined hundreds of protocolos, which are notarial records such as powers of attorney; sales of property and goods; testaments; issuance of promissory notes; and civil marriage contracts. [This is where the “pragmatic” part of choosing the 1860s for my study comes into play; the compilation of complete sets of protocolos started only in the late 1860s. Unfortunately, as of this writing notarial records beyond 1903 are not yet publicly accessible to scholars.] Another important set of documents I used from this archive is the Varios Personajes, which contains the dossier of prominent individuals living in Manila, including transcriptions of court cases brought against them and personal records. From the AAM, I examined bundles of baptismal and matrimonial records belonging to Chinese converts in Manila, carefully noting down and collecting important biographical data from these sources. Complementing these Spanish government and church records are letters, reports, and publications found at AUST, the archives of the Catholic Dominican order. The Dominican friars were in charge of evangelizing and administering to the spiritual needs of the Chinese in Manila, and kept many records and files of their Chinese ministry. The utilization of these mostly Spanish sources allows for a more intimate and first-hand look into the lives of Chinese and Chinese mestizos long gone from the face of the earth. For the part of my study dealing with the American colonial period, I utilized for primary sources mostly Western-language newspapers, government records, travel accounts, court cases, and other forms of printed material such as works of fiction. Chinese sources for both colonial periods are restricted mostly to gazetteers, family genealogies, and\n\n16\n\nintroduction\n\nbiographies. Unfortunately, Chinese newspapers published in Manila during the first few decades of the twentieth century, which could have been a valuable source of information, were mostly destroyed during World War II. Finally, interviews conducted with descendants of people included in my study as well as privately written family histories covered the gaps between other sources. Limitations/Scope of Study As I mentioned earlier, the reason why I chose to focus on the 1860s to the 1930s is that it is within this time frame that we can begin to understand the reasons for the ethnic division between “Chinese” and “Filipinos” today. Another reason for choosing this period that spans both the latter part of the Spanish colonial period and the early American period is that I wanted to avoid the usual periodization used by other scholars in tracing the history of the Chinese in the Philippines. The year 1898 has always been utilized as the cut-off point, i.e., it was this year when Spanish colonial rule officially ended and American colonial rule began. While this periodization may seem logical, past scholars have unfortunately also used what was a political change to describe changes in ethnic classifications in the Philippines. In other words, when the Americans established new citizenship laws in the Philippines that divided its people into “Filipinos” and “aliens” (thereby removing the three-way classificatory system of sangleys, Chinese mestizos, and indios instituted by the Spanish government in the Philippines), these scholars have sought to explain the changes in the ethnic identities of the Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the Philippines to support what were legally-imposed categories, instead of analyzing how the affected people negotiated these changes. As I will demonstrate in Chapter 7, the conflation of political and cultural identities of what it meant to be “Chinese” or “Filipino” took a few decades to be formed. Even though by 1899 the American colonial government had established a new classificatory system dividing the population in the Philippines into “Filipinos” and “aliens” (i.e., “Chinese”), I argue that the process of propagating and constructing a homogenized and reified view of “Chinese-ness” and “Filipino-ness” took several decades, and reached a crucial moment in the 1930s, when the meanings of such identities became more defined, consolidated, and unified, establishing the bases upon which they are understood and circulated in contemporary Philippine society.\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n17\n\nAs to the individuals I have included in my study, most of them were merchants or belonged to the middle or upper class. Many of the Chinese included here also converted to Catholicism and married local (i.e., Chinese mestizo and indio) women. At the outset, therefore, I would like to state that my study does not claim to paint a picture of a wide spectrum of the Chinese population in Manila. I was partly constrained by the types of documents available to me. Individuals and families of some economic capability and mobility were the ones who often drew up the business and marriage contracts and testaments. In doing so, they left records that researchers can use to reconstruct their everyday practices and life histories.9 Lastly, I chose to focus on Chinese merchant families in Manila, especially those living in Binondo or the areas around it. This arises from a conscious decision to make them the focus of my study as Manila continues to be the main urban center where a big proportion of the Chinese diasporic community in the Philippines resided (and continues to reside), although during the period under study significant numbers of Chinese were also found in other urban areas, particularly Cebu and Iloilo.10 Chapter Summaries As a way to provide a broader context to the history and society of the Chinese in the Philippines, a background on the history, society, political set-up, and economy of the Minnan region up to the early part of the twentieth century is established in the first chapter. Drawing on Western and Chinese sources, this chapter in particular discusses certain factors, such as the topography of the Minnan region, the advances made in navigational technology, and Chinese government policy changes, which would help explain the influx of Chinese 9 This does not mean, however, that there are no archival records that could be used to study the ethnic identities of people from the lower socio-economic class. Two such records that could be possibly used are the criminal and civil cases found at the RMAO. These records have been transferred to CD-rom formats. However, a cursory examination of these records shows that most documents are haphazardly arranged, with dates not chronologically arranged. Thus, researchers will have to first sift through these voluminous files and create some order before being able to use them efficiently. 10 Significant studies on other “Chinese” communities outside Manila include Dannhaeuser 2004; Reynolds 1998; Omohundro 1981; Hodder 1996; and the different essays in Ang See 1997b.\n\n18\n\nintroduction\n\nmigrants into the Philippines after the 1850s. Furthermore, Chapter 1 provides a description of late imperial and early Republican Minnan society, focusing especially on the people’s various commercial and socio-cultural practices that had bearing on Chinese merchant society and families in Manila. (Other aspects of Minnan society not discussed in this chapter are included in the proceeding chapters). In providing such details, this work hopes to present a more transnational context to the study of the Chinese diaspora in the Philippines. The second chapter begins with a general description of the history of the Chinese in the Philippines, and then focuses on the local and regional contexts in which the Chinese and Chinese mestizos in Manila lived during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It also produces a general picture of the district of Binondo where many Chinese and their families resided. Furthermore, data gathered from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources reveals a demographic picture of the individuals and families under study, including statistical information pertaining to population, sex ratio, native-place origins, age, and occupational backgrounds. The chapter ends with an examination of Spanish colonial policy and outside perceptions toward the Chinese during the last few decades of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. A discussion of the ways in which the Spanish colonial government regulated the economic activities of the Chinese merchants starts off Chapter 3. This is followed by an investigation of the specific business practices of the members of this diasporic community. Using mainly the notarial records found in the RMAO, I provide specific examples of business transactions that entailed border-crossing practices. For instance, while building companies in Manila, many wealthy Chinese merchants also set up companies in Hong Kong or Xiamen (in China). They then willingly dispersed family members to operate these distant businesses. Another strategy they adopted was to establish connections and conduct business transactions not only with other Chinese merchants, but also with people of different ethnic groups. I also describe how these merchants practiced another flexible strategy by Hispanicizing themselves—learning to speak, read, or write Spanish, and applying for Spanish citizenship. Finally, I describe how Chinese merchants, by having several names to use in different situations, confounded colonial authorities attempting to pin down their identities and to regulate them. The chapter concludes with a section on the business practices of three Chinese merchants: Joaquin Barrera Limjap, Ignacio Jao Sy Boncan, and Carlos Palanca Tan Quien-sien, as a way to particular-\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n19\n\nize and concretize the practices discussed herein. Of note are some descriptions of how these wealthy Chinese merchants, particularly Carlos Palanca Tan Quien-sien, interacted with men—both Chinese and non-Chinese—of lower-class standing. Chinese merchants adopted flexible strategies in their public and commercial lives in order to take advantage of their diasporic positionalities and hybrid identities. But in order to succeed, they also had to create structures and border-crossing strategies within the familial realm of their lives. For instance, capitalizing on the privileges that accompanied Christian conversion and marriage, many of these prominent Chinese merchants became Catholics. This is why I investigate their religious practices, notably those that pertain to Catholic baptism and marriage in Chapter 4, beginning with a description and discussion of Spanish government and Church policies designed to turn the Chinese and their families into “loyal” and “faithful” subjects. Then I outline the procedures for a Chinese to receive baptism and marry a local woman, and how the Spanish church and secular authorities dealt with the issue of polygamy. Specifically, this chapter demonstrates how pertinent Church policies toward intermarriages between the Chinese and local women actually condoned, if not encouraged, the polygamous practices engaged in by some converts. Hence, the accounts of outside observers or Spanish missionaries who tended to describe these Chinese converts who had multiple wives as “bad” or “insincere” Catholics need to be reassessed in the light of such accommodations. For these Chinese and their families, such arrangements, which were part of their flexible strategies to adapt to local (both within China and the Philippines) and regional conditions and to accommodate the itinerant lifestyle of Chinese traders, were based on both Chinese and Philippine cultural practices that allowed if not tolerated such marriage and kinship practices, even if these went against Catholic-proscribed norms. After marriage, how did family life unfold in Chinese mestizo households? Where did the newlyweds live? How did they raise their children? What were some of their familial and socio-cultural practices and how did these differ from those in China? These are some of the questions that the fifth chapter seeks to answer in depicting some facets of family life within Chinese merchant families from womb to tomb. The picture described here is necessarily general and incomplete. It is only meant to give the reader a glimpse, and not a template, of what family life might have been for these families. The overall aim of the chapter is not simply to provide a description of their lives, but, more\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\nimportantly, also to demonstrate what kinds of flexible strategies they employed in navigating the cross-cultural exchanges and encounters that went on within their households and without, and in thwarting or negotiating the efforts of dominant groups to restrict and control their lives. I also discuss how we can interpret some of these practices, such as the creation of networks or guanxi with non-Chinese of higher standing or believing in gods from different religious traditions, not in terms of their mindset as rational homo economicus, but from the perspective of their cosmological worldview. Chapter 6 focuses on and examines the lives of the first-generation Chinese mestizos and their socio-religious and business practices as a way to understand their ethnic identities. Past scholarship described these Chinese mestizos as mainly Hispanicized and Catholic to explain why they became “Filipino” and not “Chinese” when ethnic identities were nationalized. In contrast, by examining their everyday practices, this chapter shows that many Chinese mestizos spoke Hokkien (the language spoken by most of the Chinese in Manila); engaged in business dealings with the Chinese; entered into partnerships with them; and even traveled to China or Hong Kong as merchants or students. Thus, I argue that identities of first-generation Chinese mestizos during this period are better understood as multiple, constantly shifting, and ambiguous. Apart from male Chinese mestizos, this chapter also has a section on the family and business practices of Chinese mestizas. Including the lives and everyday practices of Chinese mestizas in my discussion of Chinese mestizo identity further complicates the nationalist version of what constitutes a “Filipino,” a category historically understood only from the points of view and lives of male individuals. For example, I demonstrate that the “ethnic choices” made by Chinese mestizas—such as marrying a Chinese merchant, thereby repeating the same pattern their Chinese mestizo mothers practiced—forces us to rethink Wickberg’s thesis that Chinese mestizos “rejected” their “Chinese-ness.” Finally, a section is devoted to an in-depth description of how the lives of some Chinese mestizos, namely, Mariano Limjap, Ildefonso Tambunting, and Bonifacio Limtuaco, reflect the flexible strategies of many Chinese mestizos during this historical juncture. Aside from examining the economic changes under the American colonial period and adaptations made by Chinese merchants to these changes, Chapter 7 provides an overview of the different factors in the first three decades of the twentieth-century that led to the distinct racial and ethnic divide between the Chinese and the Filipinos today. One major factor was American discriminatory policies against\n\nto be a “filipino” and “chinese” in the philippines\n\n21\n\nthe Chinese, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers into the Philippines. While racist American views of the Chinese did not essentially differ from those of the Spanish colonial rulers, one important difference was the belief in American nationalist exceptionalism (as part of American imperial ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region) that pushed U.S.-based legislators and their counterparts in the Philippines to exclude Chinese laborers, even if this meant slowing down the economic “development” of their newly-established colony; and to categorize the Chinese as “aliens.” Once the foundation for a legal segregation of “Filipinos” and “Chinese” was set, burgeoning and competing Filipino and Chinese nationalisms (in the latter case both in China and in the Philippines), along with rising political and economic instability in China, the subsequent rise of “Chinese” families in the Philippines, and other American policies targeting or affecting not only the business, but also the domestic lives of the “Chinese” and their families all combined to help create nation-based and territorialized cultural distinctions between the “Chinese” and the “Filipinos.” How did Chinese merchants and their families adapt to and negotiate the changes in the local and regional contexts? More specifically, what were the ways by which Chinese merchant families employed flexible strategies in their familial lives in order to adapt to the sociopolitical changes during the first three decades of the twentieth century under American colonial rule? How were these practices different or changed from those observed by Chinese merchant families in the Spanish colonial period? Furthermore, how did first-generation Chinese mestizos live out and negotiate their identities in light of a new classificatory system and the quest for building the Philippine nation-state under the American colonial period? Chapter 8 seeks to provide some answers to these questions by describing the actions of these individuals and families, especially as they related to marriage and other domestic practices. As a way to render clearer the examples given in the previous chapter, Chapter 9 incorporates the family history of the “richest” Chinese merchant at the time, Guillermo Araullo Cu Unjieng, and of the last two decades of Mariano Limjap’s life. In examining the flexible strategies of these Chinese merchant families and individuals in light of the changing political economy in the first three decades of the twentieth century, the chapter delineates the processes by which not only “Chinese” and “Filipino” identities, but also “Chinese” and “Filipino” families were formed.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE MINNAN REGION OF FUJIAN: HISTORY AND SOCIETY Introduction Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is a cosmopolitan, bustling megalopolis. As Metropolitan Manila, it is home to over 10 million residents (circa 2008), and attracts multitudes of people near and far searching for economic and other opportunities.1 Big local and international corporations set up their head offices in Manila’s financial centers such as Makati and Ortigas Center. Among those who participate in its economy are Filipinos of Chinese ethnic background, whose businesses range from banks with billions of pesos in assets and equity to food chains and large department stores. In another section of greater Manila not far from Binondo, Manila’s “Chinatown,” a big enclosed flea market called “168” attracts thousands of buyers from all over the country, especially during the holiday season, looking for bargain wares and goods, many of which are imported from China. The owners of many of these stalls are recent migrants from China. For centuries, the Chinese in the Philippines have played an important role in the Philippine economy, infusing the country with their capital, labor, knowledge, and skills. Where do most of the Chinese in Manila trace their ancestors’ origin? What factors brought their ancestors to the country? In order to answer these questions it is necessary to go back in time and examine the conditions in the Minnan region of southeastern Fujian province. As we will see, Minnan in the middle to the latter part of the nineteenth century was home to a population of people with a long history of maritime trade and cultural interaction with peoples from Southeast Asia, including the Philippines (cf. Liu 1964, 64–6, 228–36).\n\n1 Greater or Metropolitan Manila, which encompasses twelve cities and five municipalities, counts 14 million people (circa 2008).\n\n24\n\nchapter one\n\nFigure 1. Maps of Fujian and Philippines. Created by Don Sluter.\n\nFujian—Early History Most of the Chinese in the Philippines today trace their origins to Fujian (褔建) province in China. The province’s original inhabitants were members of the “seven Min tribes” that lived in the area during the Zhou dynasty (1111–255 BCE). During the Tang Dynasty, political instability forced many living in the northern part of China to flee to the southern provinces of China, including Fujian ( JJHQZ 1994, 25). Over time, the earlier inhabitants were displaced or outnumbered by people of Han ethnicity, making Fujian’s population today predominantly Han Chinese (fig. 1).2 Tracing the ethnic and regional background of most Chinese in the Philippines shows that most of them come, in particular, from the southeastern part of Fujian, the region known as Minnan (閩 南). The word “Min” (閩) stands for the abbreviated name of Fujian. 2 The largest ethnic minority group consists of She tribesmen (Shemin), who inhabit the mountainous regions of the northern Fujian. Hakka (Kejia), a Han branch with its own distinct identity, live in the southwestern parts of Fujian. Hui’an, also a Han branch with unique culture and fashion, populate Fujian’s southeast coastline in Hui’an County. The archaeological findings indicate that the original inhabitants in Fujian were Austronesians who made their living by fishing.\n\nthe minnan region of fujian: history and society\n\n25\n\nIt also refers to the river Min located in the northeastern part of the province.3 “Nan” (南), on the other hand, means “south.” Thus, “Minnan” means “South of the river Min.” At the height of their migration in the nineteenth century, many of the 90,000 or so Chinese in the Philippines were chiefly from Minnan. In 1822, this region accounted for over ninety percent of the recorded Chinese in the Philippines. More than seventy years later, it still accounted for 87.5 percent of Manila’s Chinese (Doeppers 1986, 352).4 The people who live in Minnan, including in the cities of Zhangzhou (漳州), Quanzhou (泉州), and Xiamen (厦門), speak a language that is often referred to as Hokkien (a term that stands for “Fujian” in the Minnan language). In the Philippines, the language is often referred to as “Amoy,” which was the name commonly known to Western outsiders, and which is based on its Minnan derivative.5 During the earlier dynasties, Minnan encompassed two prefectures: Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Quanzhou was a leading foreign trade and shipbuilding center from the twelfth to the thirteenth century.6 Zhangzhou began to catch up as the new terminus for overseas trade at the turn of the sixteenth century. Of the two, Quanzhou will merit further discussion due to its connections to the Philippine Chinese. Quanzhou Quanzhou (known in the Arab world as Zaytun, or in older English works, Chinchew or Chinchu) was founded as early as 718 CE under the Tang dynasty.7 It began to develop as large immigration flows from\n\nThe river had a length of 350 miles, circa 1923 (Chen [1923] 1967, 24). The rest mostly came from the Canton region. 5 For the rest of the book, “Xiamen” will be used instead of “Amoy,” unless “Amoy” is found in the original source that is being quoted or cited. 6 For more information on the history and society of Fujian during earlier times, the following English books are suggested: (on the founding of the Min empire in the tenth century) Schafer 1954; (for stone inscriptions from the Song to the Qing dynasties) Vermeer 1991; (on agriculture and economy) Rawski 1972, Ng 1983, Gardella 1994; (on religion) de Groot 1892–1910. 7 From about 900–978, it operated as a semi-autonomous kingdom within the larger kingdom of Min, and for a period of time, under the rule of the Wang family, was fairly autonomous until Song Taizu annexed it in 978 (Clark 1982). For more information, especially on the rise of Quanzhou from obscurity to prominence during the Tang to the Song transition period, see Clark 1982. 3 4\n\n26\n\nchapter one\n\ncentral China increased its population.8 Quanzhou’s topography and location helped shape people’s choices and decisions. As in the rest of Fujian province, Quanzhou abounds with hills and has limited land for cultivation, except in some areas.9 Thus, the low man-land ratio and the challenges posed by the geographical limitations of the place for agricultural production led people to engage in maritime commerce, handicraft industries, and domestic trade.10 Located at the mouth of the Jin River (晋江) that flows out into the South China Sea, Quanzhou became an important overseas trading port at the beginning of the Song dynasty, attracting foreigners such as Japanese, Indian, and Arab traders, with the latter bringing in not only their goods for trade but also their religion ( JJHQZ 1994, 24).11 By the ninth century, when the Chinese empire’s maritime trade grew, Quanzhou was one of the empire’s four great trading ports, along with Jiaozhou, Yangzhou, and Guangzhou, the last being the center of trade and commerce at the time. As navigational technology vastly improved, Quanzhou also became a major gateway for people traveling to the Nanyang (南洋) region (Southeast Asia).12 A Song dynasty poem reflects the long historical tradition of maritime travel among the people of Quanzhou: Quanzhou is thick with people The mountains and valleys sterile Although they want to take up the plow There’s no land free\n\n8 The influx of people from central China was due to the An Lushan rebellion from 755–763. Due to its many mountains and rivers, Fujian provided a natural protection against rebellious forces and elements within the empire (Nian 2005, 25). 9 It is estimated that mountainous areas constitute 70 percent of Quanzhou. A little flatland is found along the coastline and in the lower reach of Jin River, but 25 percent of this area cannot be used for farmland due to undeveloped irrigation system. 10 Fujian was one of the most secluded areas in eastern China due to the lack of rail and underdeveloped networks of paved roads before the 1950s. The geographical character can be traditionally described to be “Eight parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland” (八山一水一分田). It must be noted however that the region also allowed for the planting of cash crops such as cotton. Eventually, cotton textiles and clothes became one of the leading exports from the region (Ng 1983, 10–1). 11 Islam was a religion that was present in Minnan for a period of time. It was introduced by Arab traders who came to Quanzhou during the height of its reputation as a major trading port. Today, one can find remains of a large number of Muslim gravesites (Nian 2005, 20). 12 Links were not limited just to Southeast Asia, but also included Japan and the Korean kingdom of Goryeo ( JJHQZ 1994, 25).\n\nthe minnan region of fujian: history and society\n\n27\n\nSouth of the province is the ocean Expansive and without limit Every year they make boats to go to other lands (Zhuang 1985, 293).13\n\nIt was during the Yuan dynasty that Quanzhou reached its apex, surpassing Guangzhou as the center of commercial activity, and becoming China’s main trading harbor and Fujian’s biggest city (Mote 1999, 467; cf. Ng 1983, 12).14 It was also one of the world’s largest seaports and the starting point of what was known as the “Maritime Silk Road.” But it was a site of not only great commercial, but also cultural activity. During the Song dynasty, the famous Confucian scholar Zhuxi visited Quanzhou to give lectures, and many Confucian scholars came out of this place. However, during the Ming dynasty, the Jin River became silted, thus affecting commerce. Furthermore, in 1433 the Ming dynasty banned maritime trade in order to curb piracy and other dangers and unwanted consequences associated with maritime trade ( JJHQZ 1994, 6; Mote 1999, 719). Despite the ban, private trade continued, but the southern coasts of China continued to be plagued by pirates, who, while officially labeled as “Japanese” were often Chinese merchants whose livelihoods were affected by the ban on maritime trade (Mote 1999, 719–21; Zheng 2001, 12).15 The coming of the European colonizers to Southeast Asia in the sixteenth century ushered a new period of growth in trade. After the death of Emperor Shizong in 1567 the ban on trade was lifted. Moreover, Chinese merchants began to take over the trade previously dominated by Japanese, Arabs, and others, and as trade grew, emigration to Taiwan and Southeast Asia also increased (Zheng 2001, 14). However, when the new Qing dynasty enforced a policy of evacuation in order to defeat the forces of the Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong (鄭成功), also known as Koxinga, maritime trade in the region was again affected.16 In 1660, the Qing government ordered the entire\n\nI want to thank Devin Fitzgerald for translating this poem. The location of Minnan, which is far from the power center, also helped mercantilism to thrive as its economy was often beyond the reach of bureaucratic control of the central government as well as the Fujian provincial government. 15 These pirates were referred to as wokou (倭寇), or “Japanese pirates.” 16 Zheng Chenggong was born in 1624 to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, and his “upbringing suitably reflected the polyglot world of international relations” (Spence 1990, 54). His father’s side traced its roots to Xiamen and Minnan, and as a boy he went to school in Quanzhou. He is most well known for his connections to Taiwan, 13 14\n\n28\n\nchapter one\n\nevacuation of the population of coastal Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces and moved them inland twenty miles away from the coast, thus making maritime trade difficult (Mote 1999, 849; Kuhn 2008, 21). Furthermore, during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Minnan was incessantly attacked and invaded by pirates, causing much instability and the increased deterioration of the economy. For reasons of coastal security, the Chinese state decreed bans on maritime trade in 1655 and 1717. For instance, fear of leakage of defense secrets from contacts with foreigners prompted the Kangxi Emperor to impose the ban in 1717. Thus, Quanzhou’s prosperity suffered, and its reputation as a major trading port further declined with the Qing dynasty’s policy of isolation, while Xiamen, located further south of Quanzhou, rose to prominence (Lin 1988, 38; Ng 1983, 96). Traders and travelers from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou began to use Xiamen’s port as a point of entry and departure for travel overseas. As a result of the instability of the Kangxi period and the consequences from restrictive anti-maritime legislation, many also decided to settle in the Philippines and other countries in the Nanyang (QZSHQZ 1996, 3; JJHQZ 1994, 28). When provincial authorities pointed out that the ban in overseas trade resulted in hardships for the people, the court listened and lifted the bans in 1684 and 1727, only to reinstate it later. However, even if the Qing government punished those who returned to China, “in the nineteenth century . . . this measure of migration control fell by the wayside when beleaguered Qing officials became fully occupied with defending the dynasty from attacks by foreigners armed with cannons and warships and bands of millenarian rebels” (Hsu 2000, 24). Furthermore, in compliance with the 1860 Peking Treaty signed with Britain and France, the Qing government lifted its ban on overseas immigration of Chinese labor.17 China also signed the Burlingame Treaty with the United States in 1868 that legalized the emigration of Chinese laborers. Later on, the Qing government realized that overseas immigration could help ease social unrest and that the Chinese living “overseas” could be tapped to help China, both politically and\n\nhis fight with and defeat of the Dutch, and his anti-Qing rebellion. Even though his father Zheng Zhilong defected to the Qing, he refused to do so, and for years, until his death in 1662, he continued to embark on military operations versus the Qing. 17 Douw writes that the law banning emigration had been anachronistic since “mass emigration from South China had started during the 1840s” (1999, 32).\n\nthe minnan region of fujian: history and society\n\n29\n\neconomically. Consequently, the attitude of the Qing government in China toward the Chinese who traveled to Southeast Asia and elsewhere changed, as will be discussed in Chapter 7 (Wickberg [1965] 2000, 211). In the 1880s, the Qing government signed agreements and treaties with Britain, Germany, Brazil, and Mexico to lay down the articles about Chinese labor rights and consular services in those countries. In 1893, the Qing government officially lifted the ban on maritime trade on the advice of the Chinese ambassador to Britain, Xue Fucheng, thereby allowing émigrés to legally return to China in 1893 (Zhuang 2001, 133; Hsu 2000, 4; Qiao 1992, 98; Kuhn 2008, 240). From 1880 to 1909, over 2 million Chinese contract labor workers departed from Xiamen to western countries, a figure that reflected an annual increase of 70,000 ( JJHQZ 1994, 30). Jinjiang Up until the end of the Qing dynasty, the following seven counties belonged to the Quanzhou prefecture: Jinjiang (晉江), Nan’an (南 安), Dehua (德化), Tong’an (同安), Huian (惠安), Anxi (安蟋), and Yongchun (永春).18 Of the seven counties under the Quanzhou prefecture, Jinjiang, located along the coast and situated by the Jiulong and Jin rivers, produced the most number of Chinese migrating to the Philippines. A study of over 30,000 tombstones in Manila’s Chinese Cemetery shows the following statistical information regarding the birthplace of those buried there: Jinjiang 66.46 percent; Nan’an 17.63 percent; Xiamen 8.12 percent; Huian 2.96 percent; Longxi 1.55 percent; Enming 1.24 percent; Quanzhou 1.17 percent; Tong’an 1.12\n\n18 Other sources give a slightly different list of the counties belonging to the Quanzhou prefecture. Zheng 2001 and the QZWSZLXJ (1988, Vol. 4, 36) list only five: Huian, Nan’an, Tong’an, Jinjiang, and Anxi. Ng gives the same list for the year 1735, with no mention of Dehua and Yongchun as an “autonomous department” (1983, ix). In Zheng 2001, the Quanzhou prefectural seat and the Maxiang subprefecture were also listed as being under the jurisdiction of the Quanzhou prefecture. The counties under the Zhangzhou prefecture included the following counties or xian (xian): Longxi, Nanjing, Zhaoan, Dongshan, Pinghe, Changtai, Haideng, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, Huaan, Longyan, Zhangping, Ningyang and thirteen other counties (Lin 1988, 35). Today, the city of Zhangzhou is part of the Longxi county.\n\n30\n\nchapter one\n\npercent; Shishi 0.85 percent; Yongchun 0.58 percent; and Anxi 0.54 percent (World News, 29 January 1995; Ang See 2004, 198).19 Jinjiang’s deep harbors are situated by the South China Sea, and are ideal for maritime travel. Today the county borders Nanan county in the west, and faces Taiwan toward the east. In the north, it shares a border with Dongli city proper, and in the northeast with the city of Shishi. Jinjiang is one of the fourteen county-level cities of Fujian and is under the jurisdiction of the prefecture-level city of Quanzhou. Its total population, circa 2000, was 480,000. Many foreign companies have set up their factories in the city, particularly those producing clothing and footwear.20 Economy of Fujian/Minnan As mentioned earlier, land was limited in Fujian, including the Minnan region. For centuries, people in Minnan had been seeking more farm land with massive land reclamation projects, but the farmland was still inadequate even after draining the malarial marshes and pushing back the sea. Despite this, or probably due to the limitations on the land, Fujian “played a leading role in agricultural innovations,” that included “the more efficient use of land from improved seeds, changing cropping patterns, . . . double-cropping and terracing” (Ng 1983, 9). The main cash crops in Jinjiang were lychee, longan, orange, plums, olives, mulberry, sugarcane, and indigo. But with a limited agricultural economy, Minnan people had to trade goods or cash for food products. Jinjiang people relied heavily on trade with Taiwan, Canton, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand (QZSHQZ 1996, 9). With the coming of the Spanish and other European traders to Southeast Asia, new agricultural products such as the peanut, the sweet potato, and tobacco were introduced into the Minnan region (Rawski 1972, 73). Raw cotton was also initially imported from Luzon, processed and then exported as finished cotton goods, but by 1700, it was grown locally. With silver pouring in from Acapulco via the Philippines new\n\n19 These places, all located within the Minnan region, account for 89.26 percent of the total, while those from Guangdong total 9.86 percent. Quanzhou as used here refers not to the prefecture but most likely to the city. Note that some of the names of these places have changed over time. 20 For more information about Jinjiang, see Chen M. 1994.\n\nthe minnan region of fujian: history and society\n\n31\n\nwealth was produced which affected “agriculture through land prices, land rents, and productivity” (Rawski 1972, 75).21 For one, land prices rose, and lands that were idle were converted to agricultural land, and mountains razed for cultivation. Rice became the main export crop, although at one point exporting sugar was big business. It was estimated Quanzhou could produce 25,000 tons of sugar in 1884 ( JJJ 1992, 10). But people continued to plant rice and did not shift to planting other cash crops. Competition from other places with better agricultural land and the practice of multiple landownership that fragmented the land (see below) were some of the factors that prevented the agricultural economy in Minnan from becoming fully developed and highly commercialized (Ng 1983, 20). System of Landownerhip In southern Fujian people practiced the system of multiple landownership. The de jure landowner had the right to the subsoil and the ability to rent it out. The right to the topsoil was sold to another person—a tenant who did not have to pay the taxes, as this was the landowner’s responsibility. This tenant could in turn rent the land to a third party. Rents were paid either by paying a portion of one’s harvest, by sharecropping, or by cash (silver). The underlying objective of the landowner in renting out his property was to assure the security of an annual income, and it was he who often benefited the most, although this system allowed for the less well-to-do to also obtain some kind of security for himself and his family, either in the form of the actual purchase of land or the tenancy rights to a particular piece of property (Ng 1983, 16–9; cf. Rawski 1972, 14–24). Furthermore, the “desire to live a more secure and prestigious life after retirement, to bring up offspring, and to keep lineage intact was enough to attract a certain amount of investment in land,” although, overall there was a “lack of serious investment in land and agriculture” (Ng 1983, 19). Statistics on returns from rental property paled in comparison from profits that could be made from money lending and commerce (Rawski 1972, 84– 6). Thus, people invested in land not so much for profit as “to ensure a stable income and reaffirm a deep cultural value in owning land”\n\n21\n\nJapanese silver was also exchanged for Chinese copper cash (Rawski 1972, 75–6).\n\n32\n\nchapter one\n\n(Rawski 1972, 86). It must be noted too that absentee landlordism was prevalent. Other Economic Activities Some families in Quanzhou, especially those living in the coastal towns, also produced skillful fishermen who caught fish, shrimps, and clams, while some men engaged in making earthenware and stone cutting (Zheng 2001, 191). Women also engaged in domestic handicraft, making ceramics, textile, embroidery, and silk. However, with foreign goods flooding in Chinese market after the Opium War, these local industries declined (Zhuang 1985, 303). There were state monopolies in salt, precious metals, pearls, and ginseng. As early as in Tang dynasty, Jinjiang already became one of three salt industrial bases in Fujian ( JJWSZLXJ 1994, Vol. 15, 124). From then on up to the Qing dynasty, the state managed the production and distribution of salt. The salt industry was very important to Chinese émigrés mostly because their family members who still lived in Minnan could be free from military conscription if they opened a salt factory ( JJWSZLXJ 1993, Vol. 14, 62–3). Maritime Trade and Settlement Elsewhere Since Fujian is a mountainous province, its rugged terrain restricted travel and communication between this province and other neighboring provinces.22 A twentieth-century outsider observer was quoted as saying that the province was “ ‘one of the most completely isolated provinces of China’ ” (quoted in Rawski 1972, 59). While this may be true in relation to other provinces of China, it certainly was not in relation to other places in Nanyang. With its extensive river systems and wide coastal areas, Fujian developed a shipbuilding industry that made it possible for its people to engage in extensive maritime trade, as described earlier in this chapter. The boats or junks they built easily navigated the many “narrow and fast flowing streams in these river systems” as well as the wide-open seas in the Nanyang (Rawski 1972, 59–60).\n\n22 The two main provinces that the southwest part of Fujian traded with in the Ming period were Jiangxi and Zhejiang (Rawski 1972, 60).\n\nthe minnan region of fujian: history and society\n\n33\n\nFor those living in the southern coastal region of Fujian, the sea provided the gateway to overseas trade (Rawski 1972, 57–8). Thus, even when there were times when maritime trade was banned, people continued to engage in this activity. There were other factors contributing to this. For instance, Fujian government officials and military officials supported maritime trade and engaged in the trade themselves. Scholars had a deep appreciation of and direct involvement in trading activities as well (Ng 1983, 200–1). The long shared history and culture between the people of Minnan and the local populations in Southeast Asia also facilitated trade.23 Evidences of such extensive and deep interaction include the similar religious traditions, agricultural technology, and kinship practices found between the two regions. Furthermore, the coming of the British and advances made in navigational technology spurred more economic activity (Kuhn 2008, 99–103). Prior to the nineteenth century people used junk ships to travel. But with British rule established in Hong Kong in 1842, and the invention of steamship, a major gateway for the Southern Chinese was opened. In treaty port cities like Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Shanghai shipping companies were established and people could find “labor recruiters, friends, and businessmen who could tell them about opportunities abroad and give them credit to buy tickets to get there” (Hsu 2000, 31; cf.
