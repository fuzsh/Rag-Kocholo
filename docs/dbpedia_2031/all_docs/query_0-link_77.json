        "text": "et seg. citing decisions of California, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Miss., Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Nebraska, Wisconsin.) In fairness to the Court of Appeals it should be stated that the above volume of Corpus Juris Secundum was published in 1950, whereas its decision was promulgated on September 30, 1949. The reason why a swimming pool or pond or reservoir of water is not considered an attractive nuisance was lucidly explained by the Indiana Appellate Court as follows: \"Nature has created streams, lakes and pools which attract children. Lurking in their waters is always the danger of drowning. Against this danger children are early instructed so that they are sufficiently presumed to know the danger; and if the owner of private property creates an artificial pool on his own property, merely duplicating the work of nature without adding any new danger, . . . (he) is not liable because of having created an 'attractive nuisance.' Anderson vs. ReithRiley Const. Co., N. E., 2nd, 184, 185; 184, 185; 112 Ind. App., 170. Therefore, as petitioner's tanks are not classified as attractive nuisance, the question whether the petitioner had taken reasonable precautions becomes immaterial. And the other issue submitted by petitioner - that the parents of the boy were guilty of contributory negligence precluding recovery, because they left for Manila on that unlucky day leaving their son under the care of no responsible individual — needs no further discussion. The appealed decision is reversed and the Hidalgo Enterprises, Inc. is absolved from liability. No costs.

ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE, WHAT CONSTITUTES; MAINTAINER LIABLE FOR INJURIES CAUSED TO CHILD. — One who maintains on his premises dangerous instrumentalities or appliances of a character likely to attract children in play, and who fails to exercise ordinary care to prevent children from playing therewith or resorting thereto, is liable to a child of tender years who is injured thereby, even if the child is technically a trespasser in the premises. 2. ID.; DOCTRINE NOT APPLICABLE TO SWIMMING POOL OR WATER TANK. — The attractive nuisance doctrine generally is not applicable to bodies of water, artificial as well as natural, in the absence of some unusual condition or artificial feature other than the mere water and its location. DECISION\n\nSECOND DIVISION BENGZON, J p: [G.R. No. 149570. March 12, 2004.] This is an appeal by certiorari, from a decision of the Court of Appeals requiring Hidalgo Enterprises, Inc. to pay Guillermo Balandan and his wife, damages in the sum of P2,000 for the death of their son Mario. It appears that the petitioner Hidalgo Enterprises, Inc. \"was the owner of an iceplant factory in the City of San Pablo, Laguna, in whose premises were installed two tanks full of water, nine feet deep, for cooling purposes of its engine. While the factory compound was surrounded with fence, the tanks themselves were not provided with any kind of fence or top covers. The edges of the tank were barely a foot high from the surface of the ground. Through the wide gate entrance, which was continually open, motor vehicles hauling ice and persons buying said commodity passed, and any one could easily enter the said factory, as he pleased. There was no guard assigned on the gate. At about noon of April 16, 1948, plaintiffs' son, Mario Balandan, a boy barely 8 years old, while playing with and in company of other boys of his age, entered the factory premises through the gate, to take a bath in one of said tanks; and while thus bathing, Mario sank to the bottom of the tank, only to be fished out later, already a cadaver, having died of 'asphyxia secondary to drowning.'\". The Court of Appeals, and the Court of First Instance of Laguna, took the view that the petitioner maintained an attractive nuisance (the tanks), and neglected to adopt the necessary precautions to avoid accident to persons entering its premises. It applied the doctrine of attractive nuisance, of American origin, recognized in this jurisdiction in Taylor vs. Manila Electric 16 Phil., 8. The doctrine may be stated, in short, as follows: One who maintains on his premises dangerous instrumentalities or appliances of a character likely to attract children in play, and who fails to exercise ordinary care to prevent children from playing therewith or resorting thereto, is liable to a child of tender years who is injured thereby, even if the child is technically a trespasser in the premises. (See 65 C. J. S., p. 455.) The principal reason for the doctrine is that the condition or appliance in question although its danger is apparent to those of age, is so enticing or alluring to children of tender years as to induce them to approach, get on or use it, and this attractiveness is an implied invitation to such children (65 C. J. S., p. 458). Now, is a swimming pool or water tank an instrumentality or appliance likely to attract little children in play? In other words is the body of water an attractive nuisance? The great majority of American decisions say no. \"The attractive nuisance doctrine generally is not applicable to bodies of water, artificial as well as natural, in the absence of some unusual condition or artificial feature other than the mere water and its location.\" \"There are numerous cases in which the attractive nuisance doctrine has been held not to be applicable to ponds or reservoirs, pools of water, streams, canals, dams, ditches, culverts, drains, cesspools or sewer pools, . . . .\" (65 C. J. S., p. 476\n\nHEIRS OF ROSENDO SEVILLA FLORENCIO, as represented by ESTRELLITA FLORENCIO-CRUZ and RODRIGO R. FLORENCIO, petitioners, vs. HEIRS OF TERESA SEVILLA DE LEON as represented by VALERIANA MORENTE, respondents. DECISION CALLEJO, SR., J p: Before us is a petition for review of the Joint Decision 1 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 59698-99 which affirmed the June 5, 2000 Decisions 2 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 20 in Civil Cases No. 1018-M-99 and 1019-M-99, and the resolution of the appellate court denying the petitioners' motion for reconsideration. The Antecedents Teresa Sevilla de Leon, owned a residential lot with an area of 828 square meters located in San Miguel, Bulacan. The said lot was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-44349. 3 In the 1960s, De Leon allowed the spouses Rosendo and Consuelo Florencio to construct a house on the said property and stay therein without any rentals therefor. On September 26, 1966, De Leon, with the consent of her husband Luis, leased the aforesaid parcel of land for P5 per month to Bienvenido Santos \"for as long as the lessor (Teresa de Leon) had an outstanding loan with the Second Quezon City Development Bank of Quezon City but not to exceed the period of fifteen (15) years.\" 4 De Leon assigned her leasehold right in favor of the Second Quezon City Development Bank. The lease and De Leon's leasehold right were annotated at the back of TCT No. T-44349 as Entry Nos. 152248 and 152249, 5 respectively. Thereafter, Bienvenido Santos constructed a house thereon. In November 1978, De Leon, then already a widow, died intestate. In deference to her wishes, her heirs allowed Rosendo Florencio to continue staying in the property. In March 1995, Florencio died intestate, but his heirs, the respondents, remained in the property. On April 26, 1995, the heirs of De Leon, through counsel, sent a letter to the heirs of Florencio, demanding that they vacate the property within ninety (90) days from receipt thereof. 6 The latter refused and failed to vacate the property. The heirs of De Leon, through Valeriana L. Morente, thereafter filed a complaint for ejectment against the heirs of Florencio before the Municipal Trial Court of 1\n\nSan Miguel, Bulacan, docketed as Civil Case No. 2061. Therein, the plaintiffs alleged that they were the pro-indiviso owners of the 828 square-meter lot covered by TCT No. T-44349, which they inherited from their mother. During her lifetime, their mother allowed Florencio and his family to occupy the property without any compensation, subject to the condition that they shall vacate the same upon demand; such arrangement went on even after their mother's demise. They further averred that sometime in 1995, they demanded that the heirs of Florencio vacate the property, but that the latter refused to do so. 7\n\nheirs of Bienvenido Santos, only Florencio's heirs had the right to cause their eviction from the property by reason of the deed of donation executed in favor of the latter. The trial of the two cases was consolidated. The parties agreed to litigate the following issues: After the preliminary conference, parties submitted their respective position papers.\n\nThe plaintiff thence prayed: WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed that after due hearing, judgment be rendered ordering defendants to:\n\nPlaintiffs raised and argued on the following issues: a). Defendants' possession of the premises was merely on the tolerance of the late Teresa de Leon.\n\n1. Vacate the premises which they are presently occupying; cIETHa 2. Pay plaintiff the amount of P100,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees;\n\nb). The alleged Deed of Donation does not exist, is patently a falsified document and can never be the source of any right whatsoever.\n\n3. Pay plaintiff P100,000.00 as moral damages; Defendants, on the other hand, raised and argued on the following issues: 4. Pay plaintiff P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. a). Defendants do not have only a better right of possession over the questioned parcel of land and they do not have only the absolute and lawful possession of the same but they have the absolute and lawful ownership of the same not only against the plaintiffs but against the whole world.\n\n5. Pay plaintiff P 10,000.00 per month from April 26, 1995 up to and until defendants vacate the premises. Plaintiff prays for other reliefs just and equitable under the circumstances. 8\n\nb). Defendants are entitled to their counterclaim. 13 In their answer to the complaint, the heirs of Florencio alleged that the plaintiffs had no cause of action against them, as Teresa de Leon had executed a Deed of Donation on October 1, 1976 over the said parcel of land in favor of their predecessor, Rosendo Florencio. The latter accepted the donation, as shown by his signature above his typewritten name on page one of the deed. The execution of the deed was witnessed by Patria L. Manotoc and Valeriana L. Morente. Atty. Tirso L. Manguiat, a notary public in the City of Manila, notarized the deed on said date and entered it in his notarial record as Doc. No. 1724, page 71, Book IV, series of 1976. 9\n\nOn motion of the plaintiffs in both cases, the court issued an Order directing the heirs of Florencio to produce the original of the Deed of Donation purportedly executed by Teresa de Leon. However, they failed to comply with the order of the court and submitted a mere photocopy of the same. 14 The plaintiffs adduced in evidence the following: (1) TCT No. T-44349 in the name of Teresa Sevilla; 15 (2) demand letters sent by the plaintiffs' counsel to the defendants demanding that the latter vacate the subject premises; 16 (3) affidavit-complaint of Valeriana Morente filed in the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Bulacan docketed as I.S. No. 96-1513 for falsification, perjury and applicable crimes against Rodrigo Florencio and Atty. Tirso Manguiat, dated May 8, 1996; 17 (4) affidavit-complaint executed by Ramon de Leon Manotoc dated May 8, 1996; 18 (5) copies of Teresa de Leon's passport issued on April 28, 1975 containing specimens of her signature; 19 (6) copy of Patria Manotoc's passport issued on September 16, 1997 with her specimen signature therein; 20 (7) copy of Valeriana Morente's passports issued on the following dates: (a) February 20, 1967; 21 (b) April 28, 1975; 22 (c) October 4, 1984; 23 and (d) August 22, 1994, 24 with specimens of her signature appearing therein covering a span of thirty years; (8) copy of the Certificate of Death of Patria Manotoc; 25 (9) Certification dated April 23, 1996 issued by Teresita R. Ignacio, Chief, Archives Division of the Records Management and Archives Division of Manila 26 to the effect that nothing in the notarial register of Atty. Tirso L. Manguiat show that he notarized a deed of donation dated October 1, 1976 in favor of Rosendo Florencio; (10) copy of Sinumpaang Salaysay dated July 19, 1996 executed by one Rodolfo Apolinario; 27 and, (11) copies of the official receipts of the real estate taxes paid. 28\n\nThe heirs of Florencio further averred that since then, their predecessor and his family possessed the aforesaid property as owners. After De Leon's death, Florencio and his children, in coordination with Jose de Leon, the administrator of the aforesaid property, arranged for the registration of the land subject of the donation in the name of Rosendo Florencio, which was, however, superseded by the untimely demise of Jose de Leon in 1991. Thus, the property remained in the name of Teresa Sevilla de Leon, even after Florencio's death in March of 1995. 10 On February 1, 1996, the heirs of De Leon, represented by Valeriana L. Morente, also filed a complaint for ejectment against the heirs of Bienvenido Santos before the MTC of San Miguel, Bulacan, docketed as Civil Case No. 2062. 11 They prayed, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed that after due hearing, judgment be rendered ordering defendants to: 1. Vacate the premises which they are presently occupying;\n\nFor their part, the heirs of Florencio adduced in evidence a photocopy of the Deed of Donation dated October 1, 1976 purportedly executed by De Leon in favor of Rosendo Florencio. 29\n\n2. Pay plaintiff the amount of P100,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees; 3. Pay plaintiff P100,000.00 as moral damages;\n\nThe heirs of Bienvenido Santos submitted in evidence as Exhibits \"1\" and \"1-H\" the Contract of Lease dated September 6, 1966 between Teresa Sevilla and Bienvenido R. Santos. 30\n\n4. Pay plaintiff P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; 5. Pay plaintiff P10,000.00 per month from April 26, 1995 up to and until defendants vacate the premises.\n\nOn December 3, 1996, the MTC rendered a decision in Civil Cases Nos. 2061 and 2062 dismissing the complaints for lack of jurisdiction upon the finding that the issue of possession cannot be determined without resolving, in a full blown trial, the issue of ownership. 31\n\nPlaintiff prays for other reliefs just and equitable under the circumstances. 12 In their answer to the complaint, the heirs of Bienvenido Santos, through counsel, alleged that the plaintiffs had no cause of action against them, and that they did not occupy the property by mere tolerance but on the basis of a contract of lease executed by De Leon on September 26, 1966. Furthermore, De Leon donated the property to Rosendo Florencio on October 1, 1976, and the latter, after the expiration of the contract of lease, allowed and permitted them to continue and remain in possession of the property without any compensation. According to the\n\nThe heirs of De Leon appealed the decisions of the MTC to the RTC of Bulacan, Branch 83, which rendered judgment reversing the decision of the court a quo. It held that the MTC had jurisdiction over the cases; as such, the trial court should proceed and render judgment therefor. CaTcSA\n\n2\n\nFourth. The Court has noted, as anyone can easily do, that the signature purported to be that of Teresa de Leon appearing in the deed of donation (Exh. \"1-B\"), is dissimilar to her customary signatures affixed to her passports (Exhs. \"B\" and \"E-1\"). The same is true with those of Patria Manotoc and Valeriana L. Morente appearing in the same deed of donation (Exhs. \"1-D and \"1-E\"), with those of their customary signatures appearing in their respective passports (Exhs. \"F\" and \"F-1\"; \"G,\" \"G-1\" and \"G-2\"; \"H,\" \"H-1\" and \"H-2\"; \"I\" and \"I-1\" and \"J\" and \"J-1\").\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the defendants adduced in evidence a copy of the Deed of Donation as certified by the RTC of Bulacan on May 29, 1996. 32 On August 27, 1999, the MTC rendered an Amended Decision in Civil Case No. 2061 in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs. The dispositive portion of the decision reads: WHEREFORE, the court finds the defendants as having a better right of possession over the subject parcel of land as against the plaintiffs and hereby orders this case DISMISSED.\n\nAnd Fifth. There is no explanation given why since 1976, when the deed of donation was supposedly executed, up to the present, the defendants did not register the same to secure a new title in their names. In fact, there is no showing that efforts toward that end were ever executed.\n\nFor lack of evidence to prove bad faith on the part of the plaintiffs in the filing of this case, and in line with the policy not to put premium on the right to litigate, the counterclaim of the defendants is, likewise, ordered DISMISSED.\n\nAs it is, the Court holds that the deed of donation in question is not a credible piece of evidence to support the defendants' claim of acquisition of title and ownership over the subject property and therefore insufficient to justify their continuing possession and occupancy thereof. Thus, as against defendants' claim which is unregistered, the plaintiffs' right over the property as the legal heirs and successors-in-interest of the registered owner must prevail. 35\n\nWith no pronouncements as to costs. SO ORDERED. 33 The decision was appealed to the RTC of Bulacan. On June 5, 2000, the RTC rendered judgment reversing the decision of the MTC and rendered a new judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, as follows:\n\nThe Present Petition The petitioners now contend in this case that the Court of Appeals and the RTC erred in rendering judgment for the respondents, thus:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated August 27, 1999, rendered by the Municipal Trial Court of San Miguel, Bulacan, in Civil Case No. 2061, is hereby set aside and a new one is hereby rendered, as follows:\n\n1. In finding no reversible error committed by the Regional Trial Court as an appellate court and affirming its decision.\n\na) Ordering the heirs of Rosendo Florencio and all those claiming any rights under them to vacate the subject premises, particularly that parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-44349, situated in San Jose, San Miguel, Bulacan;\n\n2. In concluding that the evidence presented reveals serious doubts as to the veracity and authenticity of the notarized deed of donation, contrary to the findings of the trial court that there is a legal presumption of regularity in the execution thereof.\n\nb) Ordering the Heirs of Rosendo Florencio to pay the heirs of Teresa Sevilla the amount of P2,000.00 per month as reasonable monthly rental on the premises, to commence on April 1995 until the premises is vacated by them; and\n\n3. In holding that private respondents are entitled to possess the subject property notwithstanding petitioners' claim to the contrary and despite the latter's continuous, open and adverse possession for more than forty years. 36\n\nc) Ordering the heirs of Rosendo Florencio to pay the heirs of Teresa Sevilla the amount of P10,000.00, as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.\n\nThe petitioners aver that donation is one of the modes of acquiring ownership. Their claim for possession is precisely based on the deed of donation executed by Teresa Sevilla de Leon on October 1, 1976 in favor of their father, Rosendo Florencio. The aforesaid deed was duly notarized, and by virtue of its notarization, such deed became a public document. Furthermore, according to the petitioners, an examination of the deed reveals that it had conformed to all the essential requisites of donation, as required by the provisions of the New Civil Code; hence, its validity must be presumed. 37 From the time of the donation up to the present, the petitioners assert that they possessed the property openly, publicly and against the whole world. SacTCA\n\nSO ORDERED. 34 The RTC ruled that the deed of donation was insufficient to support the claim of the heirs of Florencio that they were the owners of the property and were, thus, entitled to its possession. The defendants, now the petitioners, filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals of the decision of the RTC. On May 28, 2001, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment dismissing the petition and affirming the RTC decision. The CA adopted the findings of the RTC and its disquisitions on why the deed of donation was not a credible piece of evidence to support the petitioners' claim over the property; hence, did not transfer title over the property in favor of the petitioners.\n\nAs regards the alleged forgery of the signatures of the donor and the witnesses, the petitioners assert that absent any clear, positive and convincing evidence that the same were forged, the presumption is that they are genuine. The mere variance in the signatures of the donor and the witnesses cannot be considered as conclusive proof of the forgery. They aver that the Certification dated April 23, 1996 of the Manila Records Management and Archives Office stating that no such notarized deed existed in the notarial records of Atty. Manguiat cannot be conclusive evidence that no donation ever existed. According to the petitioners, such certification was merely preponderant and, therefore, not enough to overthrow the presumption of regularity in the notarization as well as the genuineness of the document.\n\nFirst. The deed of donation (Exh. \"1\"), which purports to have been executed in 1976, is not annotated on the title to the property which remains registered in the name of Teresa Sevilla under TCT No. T-44349 (Exh. \"A\" and \"A-1\"). There is no showing whatsoever that the same or a copy thereof was submitted to the Office of the Register of Deeds. Second. As earlier pointed out, throughout the years, the real estate taxes on the property continued to be paid in the name of Teresa Sevilla by the caretaker Rodolfo Apolinario and nobody else. There is no showing that the defendants had previously laid any claim of title or ownership over the property and attempted to pay the taxes thereon.\n\nThe petitioners posit that their failure to register the deed of donation did not affect its validity, it not being a requisite of a valid donation. They allege that their effort to register the same during the lifetime of Jose de Leon, the administrator of the property, did not materialize because of the latter's untimely death in 1991. The petitioners conclude that because of the respondents' failure to destroy the validity of the deed of donation, their right over the property should prevail; the petitioners' right accrued on October 1, 1976, while that of the respondents accrued only in November of 1978.\n\nThird. Although it purports to have been notarized in the City of Manila by one Atty. Tirso L. Manguiat, there is no indication of its existence in the notarial record of Atty. Manguiat, as per Certification dated April 23, 1996 (Exh. \"L\") of the Manila Records Management and Archives Office. One can only wonder why from the place of execution in San Miguel, Bulacan on October 1, 1976, its notarization on the same date had to be in the City of Manila.\n\nIn their comment, the respondents, through counsel, argue that the deed of donation executed by De Leon dated October 1, 1976 in favor of Rosendo Florencio is not a credible piece of evidence. The deed is insufficient to justify the petitioners' stay in the premises because the original copy was never presented 3\n\nto them or to the court. Furthermore, while the photocopy of the deed of donation states that it was notarized by a certain Tirso Manguiat, a notary public for the City of Manila, under Doc. 1724, Page No. 71, Book No. IV, Series of 1976, the presumption of regularity in the notarization of the deed was destroyed by the certification from the Records Management and Archives Office of Manila that no such deed exists. The respondents further assert that the signatures appearing on the said deed, i.e., that of Teresa Sevilla de Leon, Patria Manotoc and Valeriana Morente, were all forgeries.\n\nthe person whose name appears therein as the registered owner. 50 The registered owner has the right to possess, enjoy and dispose of the property without any limitations other than those imposed by law. In this case, the deed of donation, on its face, appears to bear all the essential requisites of a valid donation inter vivos. With Teresa de Leon as the donor and Rosendo Florencio as the donee, the deed of donation appears to have been notarized by Notary Public Tirso Manguiat. On this premise, Florencio, and after his death, his heirs, acquired ownership over the property although Certificate of Title No. T-44349 under the name of Teresa de Leon had not yet been cancelled.\n\nAccording to the respondents, the following facts bolster the incredibility of the deed of donation: (a) the deed of donation was executed in 1976 but was not registered; (b) the TCT is still registered in the name of Teresa Sevilla de Leon; (c) the owner's duplicate copy of the TCT should have been transmitted to the donees; and, (d) the real estate taxes were continuously paid in the name of Teresa Sevilla de Leon. Thus, the respondents, as her heirs, are the legal owners of the property.\n\nHowever, as pointed out by the RTC and the Court of Appeals, there are cogent facts and circumstances of substance which engender veritable doubts as to whether the petitioners have a better right of possession over the property other than the respondents, the lawful heirs of the deceased registered owner of the property, Teresa de Leon, based on the Deed of Donation.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court The threshold issue in this case is whether or not the petitioners, as heirs of Rosendo Florencio, who appears to be the donee under the unregistered Deed of Donation, have a better right to the physical or material possession of the property over the respondents, the heirs of Teresa de Leon, the registered owner of the property.\n\nFirst. Teresa de Leon purportedly executed the Deed of Donation on October 1, 1976 in favor of Rosendo S. Florencio. If she, indeed, donated the property, she would surely have turned over the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-44349 to Florencio, to facilitate the issuance of a new title over the property in his favor. There was an imperative need for the deed to be registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds, and the title to the property to be thereafter issued in the name of the donee, Florencio. Before then, Florencio and his family had been residing in the property solely at the sufferance of Teresa de Leon and her husband. Their possession of the property and their continued stay therein was precarious. They could be driven out from the property at any time by De Leon if she disowned the deed or, after her death, by her heirs. It behooved Florencio to have the said deed filed and duly registered 51 with the Office of the Register of Deeds without delay and, thereafter, to secure a new title under his name. This would have resulted in the cancellation of TCT No. T-44349 under the name of Teresa de Leon, and thereby averted any disturbance of Florencio's possession of the property, and after his death, that of his heirs.\n\nThe petition has no merit. Prefatorily, in ejectment cases, the issue is the physical or material possession (possession de facto) and any pronouncement made by the trial court on the question of ownership is provisional in nature. 38 A judgment rendered in ejectment cases shall not bar an action between the same parties respecting title to the land and shall not be conclusive as to the facts found therein in a case between the same parties upon a different cause of action involving possession of the same property. 39\n\nAt the very least, Florencio should have caused the annotation of the deed immediately after October 1, 1976 or shortly thereafter, at the dorsal portion of TCT No. T-44349. Such annotation would have been binding on the respondents, as De Leon's successors-in-interest, as well as to third persons. However, Florencio failed to do so. Even as De Leon died intestate in 1978, Florencio failed to secure title over the property in his name before he himself died intestate in 1995. If, as the petitioners claimed, Florencio acquired ownership over the property under the deed, it is incredible that he would fail to register the deed and secure title over the property under his name for almost twenty years. All these years, Florencio, and thereafter, his heirs, remained passive and failed to act upon the deed of donation to protect their right. This, the Court finds difficult to understand.\n\nWe agree with the petitioners that under the New Civil Code, donation is one of the modes of acquiring ownership. 40 Among the attributes of ownership is the right to possess the property. 41 The essential elements of donation are as follows: (a) the essential reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (b) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (c) the intent to do an act of liberality or animus donandi. When applied to a donation of an immovable property, the law further requires that the donation be made in a public document and that the acceptance thereof be made in the same deed or in a separate public instrument; in cases where the acceptance is made in a separate instrument, it is mandated that the donor be notified thereof in an authentic form, to be noted in both instruments. 42\n\nThe claim that Florencio and his heirs sought the registration of the deed and the transfer of the title to and under Florencio's name from 1978 to 1991, in coordination with Jose de Leon is incredible. There is no evidence on record that the deed of donation was ever filed with and registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds at any time during the period from 1978 to 1991. The petitioners' claim that the registration of the deed was delayed and later aborted by the demise of Jose de Leon is not substantiated by evidence. Moreover, there is no reason why Florencio, or after his death, the petitioners, could not have had the deed registered even after Jose de Leon's death.\n\nAs a mode of acquiring ownership, donation results in an effective transfer of title over the property from the donor to the donee, and is perfected from the moment the donor is made aware of the acceptance by the donee, provided that the donee is not disqualified or prohibited by law from accepting the donation. 43 Once the donation is accepted, it is generally considered irrevocable, and the donee becomes the absolute owner of the property, except on account of officiousness, failure by the donee to comply with the charge imposed in the donation, or ingratitude. 44 The acceptance, to be valid, must be made during the lifetime of both the donor and the donee. It must be made in the same deed or in a separate public document, and the donee's acceptance must come to the knowledge of the donor. 45\n\nSecond. Florencio failed to inform the heirs of De Leon that the latter, before her death, had executed a deed of donation on October 1, 1976 over the property in his favor. It was only in 1996, or eighteen years after the death of De Leon when the respondents sued the petitioners for ejectment that the latter claimed, for the first time, that De Leon had executed a deed of donation over the property in favor of their predecessor, Florencio.\n\nIn order that the donation of an immovable property may be valid, it must be made in a public document. 46 Registration of the deed in the Office of the Register of Deeds or in the Assessor's Office is not necessary for it to be considered valid and official. Registration does not vest title; it is merely evidence of such title over a particular parcel of land. 47 The necessity of registration comes into play only when the rights of third persons are affected. 48 Furthermore, the heirs are bound by the deed of contracts executed by their predecessors-ininterest. 49\n\nThird. In the meantime, the respondents consistently paid the realty taxes for the property from 1978 up to 1996, completely oblivious to the existence of the deed of donation. On the other hand, Florencio, and, after his death, the petitioners, never paid a single centavo for the realty taxes due on the property, even as they continued staying in the property without paying a single centavo therefor. The petitioners should have declared the property under their names and paid the realty taxes therefor, if they truly believed that they were its owners. They failed to do so. The fact of Florencio's inaction and that of the petitioners' weakened the\n\nOn the other hand, the fundamental principle is that a certificate of title serves as evidence of an indefeasible and incontrovertible title to the property in favor of 4\n\nlatter's claim that they acquired ownership over the property under the deed of donation.\n\nVELASCO, JR., J p: Say not you know another entirely, 'til you have divided an inheritance with him.\n\nFourth. The petitioners never adduced in evidence the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-44349 under the name of De Leon. Their possession of the owner's duplicate of the title would have fortified their claim that indeed, De Leon had intended to convey the property by donation to Florencio. Furthermore, the petitioners did not explain why they failed to adduce in evidence the said owner's duplicate of the title. The only conclusion is that the said owner's duplicate copy was not turned over to Florencio contemporaneously with or after the execution of the deed of donation; hence, their failure to secure title over the property. 52\n\n––Johann Kaspar Lavater Can a party who lost rights of ownership in a parcel of land due to laches be allowed to regain such ownership when one who benefited from the delay waives such benefit? This is the core issue to be resolved from this Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 that seeks to set aside the January 26, 1999 Decision 2 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 54795 which overturned the April 2, 1996 Decision of the Dumaguete City Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Civil Case No. 9975 declaring null and void the December 27, 1972 Deed of Quitclaim executed by petitioners Jovito Reyes and Victorino Reyes and ordering respondents to vacate Lot No. 3880 in Tanjay, Negros Oriental, remove their houses from the said lot, and pay petitioners' attorney's fees of PhP10,000.00. Also challenged is the March 25, 1999 Resolution 3 which denied petitioners' February 12, 1999 Motion for Reconsideration. 4\n\nFifth. The respondents adduced in evidence the affidavit-complaint of Valeriana Morente dated May 8, 1996, one of the witnesses to the deed, for falsification and perjury against Florencio and Atty. Tirso Manguiat. They also adduced the Certification dated April 23, 1996 issued by Teresita R. Ignacio, Chief, Archives Division of the Records Management and Archives Division of Manila, to the effect that nothing in the notarial register of Atty. Tirso L. Manguiat, a notary public of Manila, showed that the latter notarized a Deed of Donation executed by De Leon and Florencio in San Miguel, Bulacan dated October 1, 1976. However, the petitioners failed to adduce in evidence Atty. Manguiat's counter-affidavit to the said complaint, or, at the very least, a separate affidavit explaining the facts and circumstances surrounding the notarization of the deed of donation.\n\nThe Facts It is sad and tedious when relatives bicker over inheritance — when the differences could have been amicably settled and harmony prevail among relatives. The instant case involves Lot No. 3880 of the Cadastral Survey of Tanjay, Negros Oriental which has a land area of around 25,277 square meters, more or less. Said lot was originally owned by a certain Isidro Reyes, who sired eight children, viz: Victoriana Reyes Manaban, Telesfora Reyes Manaban, Leonardo Reyes, Juan Reyes, Eduarda Reyes, Miguel Reyes, Eleuteria Reyes, and Hermogenes Reyes.\n\nSixth. A reading of the deed will show that at the bottom of page one thereof, Florencio was to subscribe and swear to the truth of his acceptance of the donation before Municipal Mayor Marcelo G. Aure of San Miguel, Bulacan. However, the mayor did not affix his signature above his typewritten name, thus: SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN to before me this 1st day of October, 1976, the DONOR having exhibited her Res. Cert. No. A-3723337 issued at Quezon City on January 10, 1976.\n\nThe protagonists are the descendants, specifically the grandchildren, of the three eldest children of Isidro Reyes, namely, Victoriana, Telesfora and Leonardo. To better understand the relation of the parties, it is apt to mention the lineal positions of the pertinent heir-litigants whose names are emphasized for clarity and identity.\n\nMARCELO G.

Respondent Felipe Cueco was included among the litigants, being the husband of Pelagia Manaban.\n\nIt appears that a second page was added, with the name of Atty. Manguiat typewritten therein as notary public, obviously, with the use of a different typewriter. In sum then, we agree with the RTC and the Court of Appeals that the deed of donation relied upon by the petitioners is unreliable as evidence on which to anchor a finding that the latter have a better right over the property than the respondents, who, admittedly, are the heirs of Teresa de Leon, the registered owner of the property under TCT No. T-44349 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan.\n\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is DENIED.

It was docketed as Civil Case No. 9975 and raffled to RTC Branch 44.\n\nFor clarity, a chart showing the family tree originating from Isidro Reyes is provided as follows (with the parties' names given emphasis):\n\nIn gist, petitioners, as registered owners of Lot No. 3880, alleged that by tolerance they allowed respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang to cultivate an area of about one hectare of the said property; and also by tolerance allowed respondents Manabans and Agalas to occupy another hectare portion of the same lot. They further alleged that in December 1972, petitioners Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes got sick; and believing that they were bewitched by the occupants of the said lot, they signed a Deed of Quitclaim, waiving all their rights and interests over their respective shares in the disputed lot in favor of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes; and that thereafter, the latter filed Civil Case No. 6238 in 1987, which was dismissed by the Dumaguete City RTC.\n\n[image] With the foregoing perspective on the relational positions of the protagonists, we move on to the factual antecedents: Among Isidro's children, it was Leonardo Reyes, in behalf of his seven (7) siblings, who managed the properties of their father. In 1924, a cadastral survey was conducted pursuant to Act No. 2259. Leonardo, through his representative, Angel Calumpang, filed an answer in the cadastral court naming all eight children of Isidro Reyes as claimants of the said lot. However, on July 10, 1949, a certain Dominador Agir filed another claim over the disputed lot, this time naming some grandchildren of Leonardo Reyes (greatgrandchildren of Isidro Reyes), which included most of the children of Higino and Policarpio Reyes as claimants, namely: Victorino, Cipriano, Luis, Ricardo, and Daylinda all surnamed Reyes, who are the children of Higino Reyes; and Beatriz, Guillermo, and Jovito all surnamed Reyes, who are the children of Policarpio Reyes. Subsequently, on July 19, 1949, a Decision was rendered in Cadastral Case No. 12, G.L.R.O. Cad. Rec. No. 31 which covered four (4) lots, among which is Lot No. 3880, whereby the Decision granted judicial confirmation of the imperfect title of petitioners over said lot. Consequently, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. OV-227 was issued on August 5, 1954 in the name of petitioners, namely: Victorino, Cipriano, Luis, Ricardo, Jesus, Daylinda, Jovito, Guillermo, and Beatriz, all surnamed Reyes.\n\nDuring the hearing of the instant case, petitioners presented their sole witness, Ricardo Reyes, who testified on the identity of OCT No. OV-227, the character of its possession, existence, and the Decision in the prior Civil Case No. 6238; 8 and the estimated income of the disputed lot, and the expenses incurred in pursuing the instant case.\n\nThe nine (9) registered co-owners, however, did not take actual possession of the said lot, and it was Victorino and Cipriano Reyes who paid the land taxes. The heirs of Telesfora Reyes Manaban and Victoriana Reyes Manaban (daughters of Isidro Reyes) retained possession over a hectare portion of the said lot where they built their houses and planted various crops and fruit bearing trees. Meanwhile, sometime in 1968, Jose Calumpang, grandson of Leonardo Reyes and cousin of petitioners, also took possession over a hectare of the said lot, planting it with sugarcane. Thus, Jose Calumpang and his son Geoffrey continued to plant sugarcane over almost a hectare of the said lot while the heirs of Telesfora Reyes Manaban and Victoriana Reyes Manaban — the respondents Agalas and Manabans — occupied the rest of the same lot which is about one hectare.\n\nSubsequently, the trial court rendered its judgment on April 2, 1996. The dispositive portion reads:\n\nOn the other hand, respondent-heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes presented Lorenzo Manaban, 9 who testified on the relationship of respondents to Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes; that they were in actual and adverse possession of Lot No. 3880; and, the existence and due execution of the assailed Deed of Quitclaim in their favor which was duly annotated on the back of OCT No. OV-227. Respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang did not participate in the trial although they filed their answer.\n\nWHEREFORE, this Court renders judgment declaring NULL and VOID the Deed of Quitclaim dated December 27, 1972 signed by Jovito and Victorino all surnamed Reyes. Ordering defendants to vacate Lot No. 3880, Cadastral Survey of Tanjay and to remove their house thereon; and to pay jointly and severally plaintiffs the sum of P10,000.00, by way of reimbursement for attorney's fees, and to pay the costs. 10 Believing that they were the legal and true owners of Lot No. 3880, respondents interposed an appeal to the CA on June 27, 1996, which was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 54795.\n\nSometime in 1972, respondent Agapito Agala (grandson of Victoriana Reyes Manaban) was informed by his cousin Victorino Reyes, one of the petitioners and registered co-owner of Lot No. 3880, that there was already a title over the said lot. This prompted respondent Agapito Agala and the other heirs of Telesfora and Victoriana to seek advice from a judge who suggested that they request the registered co-owners to sign a quitclaim over the said lot.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals For non-payment of the requisite docket fee, the appeal of respondent Jose Calumpang was dismissed by the CA on December 19, 1997, 11 and a Partial Entry of Judgment for Appellant Jose Calumpang Only 12 was issued on January 23, 1998.\n\nA conference was allegedly held on December 27, 1972, where three (3) of the registered co-owners — Victorino, Luis, and Jovito all surnamed Reyes — signed a Deed of Quitclaim, 5 where, for a consideration of one peso (P1.00), they agreed to \"release, relinquish and quitclaim\" all their rights over the land \"in favor of the legal heirs of the late Victoriana Reyes and Telesfora Reyes.\" 6\n\nHowever, the appeal filed by respondents Agalas and Manabans was found to be meritorious, and on January 26, 1999, the CA reversed the Decision of the trial court and dismissed Civil Case No. 9975. While it ruled that petitioners had a cause of action to institute the case assailing the Deed of Quitclaim as its validity was not disputed in Civil Case No. 6238, upon review of the evidence adduced, the CA found that petitioners utterly failed to present evidence substantiating their allegation of fraud and mistake in the execution of the assailed quitclaim. The CA reasoned out that it was incumbent for petitioners to prove their allegations of fraud and mistake, but they failed to overcome the presumptions that a person takes ordinary care of one's concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular.\n\nThe Deed of Quitclaim was annotated on the back of OCT No. OV-227. Thereafter, respondent Agapito Agala had the then Police Constabulary (PC) summon the other registered co-owners, namely: Cipriano, Ricardo, Daylinda, Guillermo, and Beatriz, to sign another deed of quitclaim. But the latter allegedly ignored the call, prompting the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes to file on June 9, 1975 in Civil Case No. 6238, with the Dumaguete City RTC, Branch 40, a Complaint for Reconveyance of Real Property, Cancellation of Certificate of Title and Damages against the registered co-owners of the disputed lot who did not sign a deed of quitclaim and Dominador Agir, who filed the amended answer in the cadastral proceedings in 1949. On April 28, 1987, the trial court dismissed the complaint and ruled in favor of the registered co-owners of Lot No. 3880. On appeal, the CA upheld the trial court and affirmed the RTC November 29, 1989 Decision. 7 The CA Decision was not raised for review before this Court, thereby attaining finality.\n\nThus, the CA ruled that the trial court had no basis in fact and in law to declare the Deed of Quitclaim null and void, and concluded that it remained valid and binding to all the signatories. The rights and interests in the shares of Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes over Lot No. 3880 were deemed waived in favor of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes (that is, respondents Agalas and Manabans) who had the right to retain possession of the lot.\n\nConsequently, on July 2, 1991, petitioners filed the instant civil case for Recovery of Possession, Declaration of Non-existence of a Document, Quieting of Title and\n\nPetitioners registered a Motion for Reconsideration of the January 26, 1999 Decision of the CA, which was however turned down in its March 25, 1999 6\n\nResolution, as petitioners were unable to raise new substantial issues which had not been duly considered in arriving at the challenged judgment.\n\nBut, as correctly held by the appellate court, petitioners failed to present evidence in support of their allegation. Indeed, even a cursory glance at the records reveals that no evidence was adduced substantiating petitioners' allegation of fraud and mistake in the execution of the assailed quitclaim, neither from the documentary evidence formally offered 16 nor from the testimonial evidence of petitioners' sole witness, Ricardo Reyes, who testified on the identity of some documents to prove ownership, the character of the possession of the subject lot, and the existence of the Decision in Civil Case No. 6238.\n\nHence, the instant petition. The Issues In the instant petition, petitioner raises the following assignment of errors for our consideration: (a) In exercising jurisdiction over the appeal of the defendants when in fact the issues are purely questions of law misfiled in the Court of Appeals, which should have been filed directly to the Supreme Court at that time;\n\nBasic is the rule of actori incumbit onus probandi, or the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff. Differently stated, upon the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts. 17 In the case at bar, petitioners must therefore establish their case by a preponderance of evidence, 18 that is, evidence that has greater weight, or is more convincing than that which is offered in opposition to it 19 — which petitioners utterly failed to do so. Besides, it is an age-old rule in civil cases that one who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it and a mere allegation is not evidence. 20 Fraud is never presumed, but must be established by clear and convincing evidence. 21 Thus, by admitting that Victorino, Luis, and Jovito, all surnamed Reyes, indeed executed the Deed of Quitclaim coupled with the absence of evidence substantiating fraud and mistake in its execution, we are constrained to uphold the appellate court's conclusion that the execution of the Deed of Quitclaim was valid. ICHcaD\n\n(b) In reversing the RTC Decision dated April 2, 1993; and in reversing its own resolution dated December 19, 1997; (c) In declaring that the fraud and mistake in the execution of the waiver was not substantiated, when in fact there is overwhelming evidence of infirmity of the document as found by the trial court, which should not be disturbed on appeal. (d) In sweepingly dismissing the complaint, including the claim against the Calumpang defendants, even as the latter did not adduce any evidence in the trial court, and whose appeal had already been dismissed by the CA Resolution dated December 19, 1997; and the Calumpang defendants did not also appeal to the Supreme Court from such dismissal. 13\n\nThis finding is consonant with the findings of the trial court in the prior Civil Case No. 6238, 22 as affirmed in CA-G.R. CV No. 14527, 23 that while respondents Agalas and Manabans (the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes) had lost their equitable remedy in law on the ground of laches, yet the Deed of Quitclaim is deemed valid and binding.\n\nThe Court's Ruling The petition is partly meritorious. First Assignment of Error: There is a Question of Fact In the first assignment of error, petitioners argue that the appeal of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes should have been filed before this Court and not in the CA since it involves only pure questions of law, that is, whether their counterclaims are barred by the judgment in Cadastral Case No. 12, LRC 311, rendered by the Hon. Roman Ibañez, Judge of the CFI of Negros Oriental, which involves the law on estoppel by judgment, and Sections 38, 39, and 47 of Act 496. aDCIHE\n\nEquitable Rights Subsist Despite Laches On the issue of the rights of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes being barred by the indefeasibility of petitioners' Torrens Title over subject lot, we qualify. White it is true that the indefeasibility of petitioners' title on the ground of laches bars the rights or interests of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes over the disputed lot, still, the indefeasible rights of a holder of a Torrens Title may be waived in favor of another whose equitable rights may have been barred by laches. In Soliva v. The Intestate Estate of Villalba, 'laches' is defined as:\n\nWe disagree. the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which — by the exercise of due diligence — could or should have been done earlier. It is the negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable period, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert it has either abandoned or declined to assert it.\n\nA question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted. A question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation. 14\n\nUnder this time-honored doctrine, relief has been denied to litigants who, by sleeping on their rights for an unreasonable length of time — either by negligence, folly or inattention — have allowed their claims to become stale. Vigilantibus, sed non dormientibus, jura subveniunt. The laws aid the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights. 24 (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted.)\n\nThe appeal before the CA by respondent-heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes clearly assails the trial court's decision, inter alia, on the ground of lack of evidence and questions the factual findings of the trial court. This question is undoubtedly one of fact, falling squarely within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. 15\n\nVerily, laches serves to deprive a party guilty of it to any judicial remedies. However, the equitable rights barred by laches still subsist and are not otherwise extinguished. Thus, parties guilty of laches retains equitable rights albeit in an empty manner as they cannot assert their rights judicially. However, such equitable rights may be revived or activated by the waiver of those whose right has ripened due to laches, and can be exercised to the extent of the right waived.\n\nThe second issue \"that the CA erred in reversing the April 2, 1993 Decision of the RTC and its resolution dated December 19, 1997\" will be jointly discussed with the fourth issue that \"the CA erred in dismissing the complaint including the claim against the Calumpang defendants.\" Third Assignment of Error: Question of Evidence In the third assignment of error, petitioners strongly assert that overwhelming evidence of infirmity of the document substantiated the fraud and mistake in the execution of the questioned waiver or deed of quitclaim.\n\nEquitable Rights Revived through Waiver In the case at bar, petitioners' title over Lot No. 3880 had become indefeasible due to the laches of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. However, like any rights over immovable property, titleholders may convey, dispose, or encumber their right or interest. Thus, through the waiver and quitclaim, the rights of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes were acknowledged, revived, and activated to the extent of the rights waived by titleholders Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes. Clearly, the quitclaim executed by titleholders Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes waived and conveyed their rights over the said lot in favor of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes, whose equitable rights were barred by laches.\n\nWe are not persuaded. Petitioners failed to adduce evidence Petitioners admit the execution of the quitclaim by Victorino, Luis, and Jovito, all surnamed Reyes; however, petitioners allege fraud and mistake in its execution. 7\n\nwas issued, the respondents Agalas and Manabans, as heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora, were excluded.\n\nIn this light, we note that both trial and appellate courts in Civil Case No. 6238 did not categorically pronounce that the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes had no rights over the disputed lot. Their pronouncements were to the effect that whatever equitable rights the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes may have had over the subject lot had been barred by laches. Thus, the voluntary waiver of Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes revived and activated the equitable rights of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes over Lot No. 3880. But such revived and activated rights over Lot No. 3880 correspond only to the extent of the rights of Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes waived in their favor.\n\nIn this factual setting, respondents could have filed an action for reconveyance to recover their shares in Lot No. 3880. However, instead of instituting such a suit, respondents were able to convince Victorino, Luis, and Jovito, all surnamed Reyes, to execute a Deed of Quitclaim restoring to them their shares. Therefore, it is clear that the quitclaim is not a donation for the three (3) Reyeses — Victorino, Luis, and Jovito — who merely acknowledged the ownership of and the better right over the said lot by the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. Having acquired title over the property in 1954 to the exclusion of respondents Agalas and Manabans, through the Deed of Quitclaim executed in 1972, the three (3) Reyeses merely acknowledged the legal rights of respondents over their shares in the said lot. In fine, the Deed of Quitclaim, not being a donation, no formal acceptance is needed from the Agalas and Manabans.\n\nThe Quitclaim (Waiver) is Valid The waiver is clear. The recent case of Valderama v. Macalde reiterated the three (3) essential elements of a valid waiver, thus: \"(a) existence of a right; (b) the knowledge of the existence thereof; and, (c) an intention to relinquish such right.\" 25 These elements are all present in the case at bar. The three (3) executors, who were co-owners and titleholders of the said lot since 1954, were aware of their rights, and executed the Deed of Quitclaim in clear and unambiguous language to waive and relinquish their rights over Lot No. 3880 in favor of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. Thus, the existence of a valid waiver has been positively demonstrated. Moreover, in People v. Bodoso, cited in Valderama, it was held that the standard of a valid waiver requires that it \"not only must be voluntary, but must be knowing, intelligent, and done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\" 26 In the instant case, petitioners utterly failed to adduce any evidence showing that the assailed quitclaim was done absent such standard. Indeed, we note with approval the CA's apt application of the presumption \"that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular.\" 27\n\nAfter resolving the validity of the Deed of Quitclaim and elucidating on why the deed is not tantamount to a donation, we will now resolve what the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes are entitled to own and why they can legally possess the disputed lot: Heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes entitled to 1/3 of disputed lot Through the Deed of Quitclaim, the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes — respondents Agalas and Manabans and their co-heirs — are entitled to the aggregate shares of Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes over Lot No. 3880. OCT No. OV-227 shows that the said lot has a total area of around 25,277 square meters, more or less. The shares of the registered co-owners in the OCT are given as follows:\n\nWaiver Complies with the Requisites of a Valid Contract and the Formal Requisites to Convey Real Property Petitioners argue that even if the conveyance or waiver was duly executed, such is ineffective on the grounds of non-compliance with the requirements of Article 1318 of the new Civil Code on the requisites of a contract, and that it cannot be considered a donation for non-compliance with the formalities required by the law on donation, for example, acceptance.\n\n[I]t is hereby decreed that [1] Victorino Reyes, single; [2] Cipriano Reyes, single; [3] Luis Reyes, 19 years of age, single; [4] Ricardo Reyes, 17 years of age, single; [5] Jesus Reyes, 11 years of age; [6] Daylinda Reyes, 8 years of age; [7] Jovito Reyes, single; [8] Guillermo Reyes, 19 years of age, single; and [9] Beatriz Reyes, 17 years of age, single; in the proportion of undivided 1/2 in equal shares to the first six (6) named and the remaining 1/2 in undivided equal shares, to the last three (3) named . . .\n\nThe argument is bereft of merit. From the foregoing division of pro-indiviso shares, Victorino's share is 1/6 of 1/2 undivided share or 1/12 of the total area. Luis has the same share as Victorino's; while Jovito's share is 1/3 of 1/2 undivided share or 2/12 [1/6] of the total area. Thus, Victorino and Luis have equal shares of 2,106.417 square meters while Jovito has a share of 4,212.833 square meters. Thus, the aggregate area of the shares of Victorino, Luis, and Jovito is 8,425.667 square meters or 1/3 of the total land area of subject lot, which will be passed on to the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes — respondents Agalas and Manabans, and their co-heirs, the Balsamos, Aguilars, and Mayormitas.\n\nThe Deed of Quitclaim complies with the essential requisites of a contract provided in Article 1318 of the Civil Code, viz: (a) consent of the parties; (b) object certain that is the subject matter of the waiver and quitclaim; and, (c) the cause of the waiver and quitclaim that is established. First, there is no doubt as to the consent of the executing parties and the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. Second, the object is the executors' right over the subject land. And third, the cause is certain, that is, the recognition by the executors of the rights of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes over the disputed lot. It likewise complies with Article 1358 (1) of the Civil Code which requires that \"acts and contracts which have for their object the creation, transmission, modification or extinguishments of real rights over immovable property\" must appear in a public document. This is complied with, as the Deed of Quitclaim is a public document having been acknowledged before a notary public. 28 Moreover, the Deed of Quitclaim has been duly annotated in the original certificate of title covering the subject lot.\n\nSecond and Fourth Issues: Respondent Calumpangs barred by Civil Case No. 6238 We will now tackle both alleged assignments of errors as regards respondents Calumpangs because both issues are closely related. In the second assignment of error, petitioners, as registered owners, contend that they are in constructive possession of the disputed land and have the right to demand that respondent Calumpangs, who are occupying the land, to vacate it. And, in the last assignment of error, petitioners contend that the appellate court erred in dismissing the complaint, including the claim against respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang, who did not contest the case in the trial court, aside from their joint answer and whose appeal before the appellate court was dismissed with finality.\n\nDeed of Quitclaim not a donation Petitioners contended that the Deed of Quitclaim is really a donation and thus necessitates acceptance by respondents Agalas and Manabans. A purview of the factual antecedents of the execution of the Deed of Quitclaim shows otherwise. Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes signed the Deed of Quitclaim to relinquish their rights in recognition of respondents' right over the said land and thus conveyed their rights and interest in the quitclaim to respondents Agalas and Manabans (the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes). DACTSa\n\nWe agree with petitioners. As mentioned above, petitioners' title over Lot No. 3880, Tanjay Cadastre, Original Certificate of Title No. OV-227 issued in their names sometime in 1954, had become indefeasible pursuant to the trial court's Decision duly affirmed by the appellate court in Civil Case No. 6238. Respondent Calumpangs apparently did not adduce evidence to assert their rights over subject lot both in the prior Civil Case No. 6238 and in the instant one. Be that as it may, the claim of respondent Calumpangs over Lot No. 3880 had been conclusively denied in Civil Case No. 6238. Thus, whatever rights and interests respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang have had over Lot No. 3880 are barred by the Decision in Civil Case No. 6238. Moreover, the December 19, 1997 Resolution of the CA had become final and executory. Consequently, having no rights over Lot No. 3880, there is no\n\nIt should be remembered that respondents Agalas and Manabans are the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. Originally the rights and interests of respondents over Lot No. 3880 were formally filed in 1924 in the cadastral proceedings in the Cadastral Court. Leonardo Reyes instructed his representative to file an answer asserting the ownership of said lot by the eight (8) children of Isidro Reyes which includes Victoriana and Telesfora. However on July 10, 1949, another claim was filed by Dominador Agir only in behalf of the children of Higino and Policarpio Reyes, and excluded Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes. Thus, when OCT No. OV-227 8\n\nreason for respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang to continue occupying a portion of Lot No. 3880.\n\n1. a parcel of land for Church Site purposes only. 2. situated [in Barrio Bayugan, Esperanza]. 3.

The January 26, 1999 Decision and the March 25, 1999 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 54795 are hereby SET ASIDE. Respondents Jose and Geoffrey Calumpang are ORDERED to VACATE Lot No. 3880, REMOVE their houses from the said lot, if any, and PAY petitioners, jointly and severally, PhP 10,000.00 as attorney's fees. The heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes — among whom are respondents Agalas and Manabans — are entitled to 8,425.667 square meters of Lot No. 3880. The parties are ORDERED to have Lot No. 3880 surveyed, and a subdivision plan prepared showing the respective shares of the parties as basis for the issuance of separate titles. The Register of Deeds of Tanjay, Negros Oriental is hereby ORDERED to issue separate Transfer Certificates of Title based on the said survey plan; one title in the name of the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes over 8,425.667 square meters, who will retain possession of such area only, and another title over the remaining area of 16,851.333 square meters of Lot No. 3880 which shall be issued in the names of Cipriano, Ricardo, Jesus, Daylinda, Guillermo, and Beatriz, all surnamed Reyes, excluding Victorino, Luis, and Jovito Reyes, whose shares were conveyed to the heirs of Victoriana and Telesfora Reyes.\n\n4.

Twenty-one years later, however, on February 28, 1980, the same parcel of land was sold by the spouses Cosio to the Seventh Day Adventist Church of Northeastern Mindanao Mission (SDA-NEMM). 5 TCT No. 4468 was thereafter issued in the name of SDA-NEMM. 6 Claiming to be the alleged donee's successors-in-interest, petitioners asserted ownership over the property. This was opposed by respondents who argued that at the time of the donation, SPUM-SDA Bayugan could not legally be a donee because, not having been incorporated yet, it had no juridical personality. Neither were petitioners members of the local church then, hence, the donation could not have been made particularly to them.\n\nNo costs. SO ORDERED. Quisumbing, Carpio, Carpio Morales and Tinga, JJ., concur.\n\nOn September 28, 1987, petitioners filed a case, docketed as Civil Case No. 63 (a suit for cancellation of title, quieting of ownership and possession, declaratory relief and reconveyance with prayer for preliminary injunction and damages), in the RTC of Bayugan, Agusan del Sur. After trial, the trial court rendered a decision 7 on November 20, 1992 upholding the sale in favor of respondents.\n\nSECOND DIVISION [G.R. No. 150416.

Thus, this petition. The issue in this petition is simple: should SDA-NEMM's ownership of the lot covered by TCT No. 4468 be upheld? 9 We answer in the affirmative. The controversy between petitioners and respondents involves two supposed transfers of the lot previously owned by the spouses Cosio: (1) a donation to petitioners' alleged predecessors-in-interest in 1959 and (2) a sale to respondents in 1980.\n\nDECISION CORONA, J p:\n\nDonation is undeniably one of the modes of acquiring ownership of real property. Likewise, ownership of a property may be transferred by tradition as a consequence of a sale.\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari assails the Court of Appeals (CA) decision 1 and resolution 2 in CA-G.R. CV No. 41966 affirming, with modification, the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bayugan, Agusan del Sur, Branch 7 in Civil Case No. 63.\n\nPetitioners contend that the appellate court should not have ruled on the validity of the donation since it was not among the issues raised on appeal. This is not correct because an appeal generally opens the entire case for review.\n\nThis case involves a 1,069 sq. m. lot covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 4468 in Bayugan, Agusan del Sur originally owned by Felix Cosio and his wife, Felisa Cuysona.\n\nWe agree with the appellate court that the alleged donation to petitioners was void.\n\nOn April 21, 1959, the spouses Cosio donated the land to the South Philippine Union Mission of Seventh Day Adventist Church of Bayugan Esperanza, Agusan (SPUM-SDA Bayugan). 3 Part of the deed of donation read:\n\nDonation is an act of liberality whereby a person disposes gratuitously of a thing or right in favor of another person who accepts it. The donation could not have been made in favor of an entity yet inexistent at the time it was made. Nor could it have been accepted as there was yet no one to accept it.\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That we Felix Cosio[,] 49 years of age[,] and Felisa Cuysona[,] 40 years of age, [h]usband and wife, both are citizen[s] of the Philippines, and resident[s] with post office address in the Barrio of Bayugan, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Agusan, Philippines, do hereby grant, convey and forever quit claim by way of Donation or gift unto the South Philippine [Union] Mission of Seventh Day Adventist Church of Bayugan, Esperanza, Agusan, all the rights, title, interest, claim and demand both at law and as well in possession as in expectancy of in and to all the place of land and portion situated in the Barrio of Bayugan, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Agusan, Philippines, more particularly and bounded as follows, to wit:\n\nThe deed of donation was not in favor of any informal group of SDA members but a supposed SPUM-SDA Bayugan (the local church) which, at the time, had neither juridical personality nor capacity to accept such gift. Declaring themselves a de facto corporation, petitioners allege that they should benefit from the donation. But there are stringent requirements before one can qualify as a de facto corporation: (a) the existence of a valid law under which it may be incorporated; 9\n\nthat titles were legally issued and that they are valid. It is irrevocable and indefeasible and the duty of the Court is to see to it that the title is maintained and respected unless challenged in a direct proceeding. . . . The title shall be received as evidence in all the Courts and shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein.\n\n(b) an attempt in good faith to incorporate; and (c) assumption of corporate powers. 10 While there existed the old Corporation Law (Act 1459), 11 a law under which SPUM-SDA Bayugan could have been organized, there is no proof that there was an attempt to incorporate at that time.\n\n[This action was instituted almost seven years after the certificate of title in respondents' name was issued in 1980.] 20\n\nThe filing of articles of incorporation and the issuance of the certificate of incorporation are essential for the existence of a de facto corporation. 12 We have held that an organization not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cannot be considered a corporation in any concept, not even as a corporation de facto. 13 Petitioners themselves admitted that at the time of the donation, they were not registered with the SEC, nor did they even attempt to organize 14 to comply with legal requirements.\n\nAccording to Art. 1477 of the Civil Code, the ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual or constructive delivery thereof. On this, the noted author Arturo Tolentino had this to say: The execution of [a] public instrument . . . transfers the ownership from the vendor to the vendee who may thereafter exercise the rights of an owner over the same 21\n\nCorporate existence begins only from the moment a certificate of incorporation is issued. No such certificate was ever issued to petitioners or their supposed predecessor-in-interest at the time of the donation. Petitioners obviously could not have claimed succession to an entity that never came to exist. Neither could the principle of separate juridical personality apply since there was never any corporation 15 to speak of. And, as already stated, some of the representatives of petitioner Seventh Day Adventist Conference Church of Southern Philippines, Inc. were not even members of the local church then, thus, they could not even claim that the donation was particularly for them. 16\n\nHere, transfer of ownership from the spouses Cosio to SDA-NEMM was made upon constructive delivery of the property on February 28, 1980 when the sale was made through a public instrument. 22 TCT No. 4468 was thereafter issued and it remains in the name of SDA-NEMM. WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. Costs against petitioners.\n\n\"The de facto doctrine thus effects a compromise between two conflicting public interest[s] — the one opposed to an unauthorized assumption of corporate privileges; the other in favor of doing justice to the parties and of establishing a general assurance of security in business dealing with corporations.\" 17\n\nSO ORDERED. Puno, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna and Garcia, JJ., concur.\n\nGenerally, the doctrine exists to protect the public dealing with supposed corporate entities, not to favor the defective or non-existent corporation. 18 THIRD DIVISION In view of the foregoing, petitioners' arguments anchored on their supposed de facto status hold no water. We are convinced that there was no donation to petitioners or their supposed predecessor-in-interest. TCDHIc\n\n[G.R. No. L-44628. August 27, 1987.]\n\nOn the other hand, there is sufficient basis to affirm the title of SDA-NEMM. The factual findings of the trial court in this regard were not convincingly disputed. This Court is not a trier of facts. Only questions of law are the proper subject of a petition for review on certiorari. 19\n\nCONSUELO SEVILLE JUTIC, JUAN JUTIC, CELESTINO SEVILLE, TIBURCIO SEVILLE, RAVELLO SEVILLE, SONITA SEVILLE, LUCY SEVILLE, EPIFANIA SEVILLE, NARACY SEVILLE, EMMANUEL SEVILLE, ORLANDO MANICAN, and PACIFICO MANICAN, petitioner, vs. THE COURT OF APPEALS, MANILA, VICENTE SULLAN, TRINIDAD SULLAN, TERESITA SULLAN, ULYSSES SULLAN, ALEJANDRINO SULLAN, BUENAVENTURA SEVILLE, and ZOILO SEVILLE, respondents.\n\nSustaining the validity of respondents' title as well as their right of ownership over the property, the trial court stated:\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n[W]hen Felix Cosio was shown the Absolute Deed of Sale during the hearing . . . he acknowledged that the same was his . . . but that it was not his intention to sell the controverted property because he had previously donated the same lot to the South Philippine Union Mission of SDA Church of Bayugan-Esperanza. Cosio avouched that had it been his intendment to sell, he would not have disposed of it for a mere P2,000.00 in two installments but for P50,000.00 or P60,000.00. According to him, the P2,000.00 was not a consideration of the sale but only a form of help extended.\n\n1. CIVIL LAW; DONATIONS; INSTRUMENT IS A MERE DECLARATION OF AN INTENTION AND A DESIRE NOT CONSIDERED A CONCRETE AND FORMAL ACT OF GIVING OR DONATING; THERE IS NO INTENTION TO TRANSFER OWNERSHIP. — The trial court was correct in stating that \"a close reading reveals that Exhibit 4 is not a donation inter vivos or mortis causa but a mere declaration of an intention and a desire. Certainly, it is not a concrete and formal act of giving or donating. The form and contents of said Exhibit 4 amply support this conclusion.\" There clearly was no intention to transfer ownership from Arsenio Seville to Melquiades Seville at the time of the instrument's execution. It was a mere intention or a desire on the part of Arsenio Seville that in the event of his death at some future time, his properties should go to Melquiades Seville.\n\nA thorough analysis and perusal, nonetheless, of the Deed of Absolute Sale disclosed that it has the essential requisites of contracts pursuant to . . . Article 1318 of the Civil Code, except that the consideration of P2,000.00 is somewhat insufficient for a [1,069-square meter] land. Would then this inadequacy of the consideration render the contract invalid?\n\n2. ID.; ID.; DONATIONS WHICH ARE TO TAKE EFFECT AFTER THE DEATH OF THE DONOR PARTAKES THE NATURE OF TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION. — It is quite apparent that Arsenio Seville was thinking of succession (\". . . in case I will die, I will assign all my rights, share and participation over the above-mentioned properties and that he shall succeed to me in case of my death. . . . \"). Donations which are to take effect upon the death of the donor partake of the nature of testamentary provisions and shall be governed by the rules established in the title on succession (Art. 728, Civil Code).\n\nArticle 1355 of the Civil Code provides: Except in cases specified by law, lesion or inadequacy of cause shall not invalidate a contract, unless there has been fraud, mistake or undue influence. No evidence [of fraud, mistake or undue influence] was adduced by [petitioners].\n\n3. REMEDIAL LAW; CIVIL ACTIONS; PARTIES; LEGAL HEIRS HAVING ACTUAL AND SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION QUALIFIES THEM AS REAL PARTIES IN INTEREST. — Private respondents as legal heirs of Arsenio Seville have actual and substantial interests in the subject of litigation thus qualifying them as real parties-in-interest. Common ownership is shown by the records. Therefore,\n\nxxx xxx xxx Well-entrenched is the rule that a Certificate of Title is generally a conclusive evidence of [ownership] of the land. There is that strong and solid presumption 10\n\nany claim of ownership of the petitioners is not based on Exhibit 4 but on the fact that they are heirs of Arsenio Seville together with the private respondents.\n\nInvolved in this appeal is the issue of whether or not there was a valid donation from Arsenio Seville to Melquiades Seville. The facts of the case are briefly stated as follows —\n\n4. ID.; EVIDENCE; FINDINGS OF FACT OF THE TRIAL COURT GENERALLY NOT DISTURBED ON APPEAL. — It is well-established rule that the factual findings of the trial court are generally not disturbed except where there is a clear cause or a strong reason appearing in the record to warrant a departure from such findings (Alcaraz v. Racimo, 125 SCRA 328; People v. Tala, 141 SCRA 240; and People v. Alcid, 135 SCRA 280).\n\nDuring his lifetime, Arsenio Seville owned — (1) a parcel of agricultural land described as Lot No. 170 situated at Anquibit, Asuncion (Saug), Davao del Norte containing an area of 11.9499 hectares, more or less; (2) a parcel of agricultural land described as Lot No. 172 likewise situated at Anquibit, Asuncion (Saug), Davao del Norte with an area of 9.6862 hectares; (3) a residential house erected on Lot 172; (4) rice and corn mills and their respective paraphernalia valued at P5,000.00; and (5) five (5) carabaos in the possession of the then defendants (pp. 6-9, Petitioners' brief). Cdpr\n\nDECISION GUTIERREZ, JR., J p:\n\nOn March 4, 1963, Arsenio Seville executed an affidavit in favor of Melquiades Seville, which reads:\n\nThis is a petition to review on appeal by certiorari the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the decision of the then Court of First Instance of Davao del Norte, Branch 9. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\n\n\"A F F I D A V I T\n\n\"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed and this case is remanded to the court a quo for implementation of, and compliance with Rule 69, Revised Rules of Court, and to partition the property in accordance with the rights as herein determined, defined and declared, with costs against defendantsappellants.\" (p. 48, Petitioner's brief)\n\n\"I, ARSENIO SEVILLE, of legal age, WIDOWER, Filipino, and a resident of Anquibit, Cambanogoy, Saug, Davao, Philippines, after having been duly sworn to in accordance with law do hereby depose and say, as follows: \"That I am the declared and legal owner of a certain parcel of land otherwise known as Lot Nos. 172 and 170 Cad. 283, containing an area of 21.6361 has., and situated at Cambanogoy, Saug, Davao and covered by H.A. No. V-77791 (E-69793) and approved by the Director of Lands as per Order issued on March 5, 1954;\n\nVicente Sullan and the other respondents filed a complaint with the then Court of First Instance at Tagum, Davao del Norte against the petitioners for partition and accounting of the properties of Arsenio Seville, alleging they are heirs of the decedent.\n\n\"That I am a widower as indicated above and that I have no one to inherit all my properties except my brother Melquiades Seville who appears to be the only and rightful person upon whom I have the most sympathy since I have no wife and children: \"That it is my desire that in case I will die I will assign all my rights, interest share and participation over the above-mentioned property and that he shall succeed to me in case of my death, however, as long as I am alive I will be the one to possess, enjoy and benefit from the produce of my said land and that whatever benefits it will give me in the future I shall be the one to enjoy it;\n\nThe petitioners, averred the following in their answer: cdrep xxx xxx xxx \"7.

ARSENIO SEVILLE Affiant\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx \"9. That Melquiades Seville and his family have been in actual possession, occupation and cultivation of Lots Nos. 170 and 172, Cad-283, since 1954 continuously and peacefully in concept of owner, up to the time of his death, and had introduced valuable improvements thereon. After his demise his heirs, the defendants herein, succeeded to the occupation and possession of the said parcel of land and improvements with the knowledge of the plaintiffs and with the acquiescence of Arsenio Seville during his lifetime.\n\n(p. 7. Appellees' brief; Exh. 4, p. 52, Folder of Exhibits). On May 24, 1968, Arsenio Seville mortgaged said properties to the Philippine National Bank in consideration of a loan. This was done with the knowledge and acquiescence of Melquiades Seville. On May 15, 1970, Arsenio Seville died intestate, single, without issue, and without any debt. He was survived by his brothers, Buenaventura Seville and Zoilo Seville who are included as respondents; brother Melquiades Seville; and sisters Encarnacion Seville and Petra Seville. Thereafter, Melquiades died and is survived by his children Consuelo, Celestino, Tiburcio, Ravelo, Sonita, Lucy, Epifania, Naracy and Emmanuel, all surnamed Seville. Sisters Encarnacion and Petra died later. Encarnacion is survived by her children Trinidad, Teresita, Ulysses and Alejandrino, all surnamed Sullan, and her husband Vicente Sullan while Petra Seville is survived by her children Orlando Manican and Pacifico Manican. cdrep\n\n\"10. That even during the lifetime of the deceased Arsenio Seville it had been his desire, intention and his wish that Lots 170 and 172 shall be owned by Melquiades Seville, the father of the herein defendants. \"11. That the ownership over the said Lots 170 and 172, Cad-283 and improvements had been vested, transmitted, conveyed and or descended unto the defendants by virtue of Exhibit '1' of this answer and through continuous possession and cultivation of the land since 1954 continuously up to the present, in concept of owner as alleged under paragraph '9' hereof.\n\nThe children of Melquiades Seville are now claiming exclusive ownership of the properties and improvements thereon on the basis of the instrument executed by Arsenio Seville in favor of Melquiades Seville and on their alleged actual possession, occupation, and cultivation of Lots Nos. 170 and 172 since 1954 continuously and peacefully in the concept of owner up to the time of Arsenio Seville's death.\n\n\"12. That by reason of this unfounded action by the plaintiffs, defendants have been compelled to engage services of counsel for which they bound themselves to pay P3,000.00 as attorney's fees. \"13. That Melquiades Seville during his lifetime had taken legal steps to perfect titles to these parcels of land in his name.\" (pp. 11, 14-15, Record on Appeal).\n\nThe petitioners assign the following alleged errors of the respondent court: On September 19, 1972, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the private respondents. The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.\n\nI THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE AFFIDAVIT IN QUESTION A DEED OR INSTRUMENT OF DONATION INTER VIVOS: 11\n\nII\n\nCommon ownership is shown by the records. Therefore, any claim of ownership of the petitioners is not based on Exhibit 4 but on the fact that they are heirs of Arsenio Seville together with the private respondents. prcd\n\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT RULING CATEGORICALLY THAT ARSENIO SEVILLE COULD VALIDLY DISPOSE OR DONATE THE PROPERTIES IN QUESTION.\n\nIt is likewise significant to note the respondents' assertion that the signed affidavit is a forgery because Arsenio Seville was illiterate during his lifetime. He could not write his name. He executed documents by affixing his thumbmark as shown in the Real Estate Mortgage (Exhibit A-4), which he executed on May 24,1968 in favor of the Philippine National Bank. The real estate mortgage came much later or more than five years after the supposed donation (Exhibit 4) to Melquiades Seville where Arsenio Seville allegedly affixed his signature. This fact was not disputed by the petitioners.\n\nIII THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT VACATING THE JUDGMENT OF THE LOWER COURT AND ENTERED (SIC) A NEW ONE HOLDING THAT THE AFFIDAVIT IN QUESTION IS A DEED OF DONATION AND THAT THE DONATION IS A DONATION INTER VIVOS THUS VALIDLY CONVEYING THE LAND UNTO THE DONEE MELQUIADES SEVILLE. (p. 10, Petitioners' brief).\n\nMoreover, the petitioners' actions do not support their claim of ownership. During the lifetime of Arsenio Seville, he paid the PNB amortization out of his personal funds and out of the income on his property. The payments were not continued by the petitioners when Arsenio Seville died so much so that the property was extrajudicially foreclosed and had to be repurchased by Zoilo Seville, one of the respondents, through installment arrangements. (Deed of Promise to Sell appended as Annex 4 to respondents' brief). The actions of the respondents are in consonance with their claim of co-ownership.\n\nAll the above assigned errors discuss the issues as relating to a donation. The trial court was correct in stating that \"a close reading reveals that Exhibit 4 is not a donation inter vivos or mortis causa but a mere declaration of an intention and a desire. Certainly, it is not a concrete and formal act of giving or donating. The form and contents of said Exhibit 4 amply support this conclusion.\" (p. 37, Record on Appeal). A discussion of the different kinds of donations and the requisites for their effectivity is irrelevant in the case at bar. There clearly was no intention to transfer ownership from Arsenio Seville to Melquiades Seville at the time of the instrument's execution. It was a mere intention or a desire on the part of Arsenio Seville that in the event of his death at some future time, his properties should go to Melquiades Seville. LLpr\n\nFinally, it is a well-established rule that the factual findings of the trial court are generally not disturbed except where there is a clear cause or a strong reason appearing in the record to warrant a departure from such findings (Alcaraz v. Racimo, 125 SCRA 328; People v. Tala, 141 SCRA 240; and People v. Alcid, 135 SCRA 280). There is no such clear cause or strong reason in this case.\n\nIn Aldaba v. Court of Appeals (27 SCRA 263, 269-270) we ruled on a similar expression of an intention, as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DISMISSED. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.\n\n\"The question to be resolved in the instant case is: Was there a disposition of the property in question made by the deceased Belen Aldaba in favor of herein petitioners? The note, Exhibit 6, considered alone, was, as held by the Court of Appeals, confirming the opinion of the lower court, only an indication of the intention of Belen Aldaba to donate to the petitioners the property occupied by the latter. We agree with this conclusion of the trial court and the Court of Appeals. The note, in fact, expressed that the property was really intended for the petitioners, 'talagang iyan ay para sa inyo.' If the property was only intended for petitioners then, at the time of its writing, the property had not yet been disposed of in their favor. There is no evidence in the record that such intention was effectively carried out after the writing of the note. Inasmuch as the mere expression of an intention is not a promise, because a promise is an undertaking to carry the intention into effect, (17 American Jurisprudence, 2d p. 334) We cannot, considering Exhibit 6 alone, conclude that the deceased promised, much less did convey, the property in question to the petitioners. . . . . \"\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nIt is quite apparent that Arsenio Seville was thinking of succession (\". . . in case I will die, I will assign all my rights, share and participation over the abovementioned properties and that he shall succeed to me in case of my death. . . . \"). Donations which are to take effect upon the death of the donor partake of the nature of testamentary provisions and shall be governed by the rules established in the title on succession (Art. 728, Civil Code).\n\nM.G. Goyena and Ty Kong Tin for appellant.\n\nFernan (Chairman), Feliciano, Bidin and Cortes, JJ., concur.\n\nDI SIOCK JIAN vs. SY LIOC SUY ET AL. FIRST DIVISION [G.R. No. L-17783. June 22, 1922.] DI SIOCK JIAN, as guardian of the minors Sy Kiong Chuan and Florencia Sy Lioc Suy, plaintiff-appellant, vs. SY LIOC SUY ET AL., defendants-appellees.\n\nFisher & DeWitt and Francisco Lavides for appellees. SYLLABUS 1. DONATIONS; PURE AND CONDITIONAL. — Where, in a donation, an obligation is imposed upon the donee to support the donor and defray his necessary expenses during his lifetime, the donation is not a pure, but a conditional, one, since the obligation imposed upon the donee is in the nature of the condition without which the donation would not have been made. 2. ID.; DONATION TO A MINOR; ACCEPTANCE BY NATURAL GUARDIAN. — A conditional donation in favor of a minor is not perfected unless it is duly accepted by his legal representative. The acceptance made by the mother of said minor is not sufficient for the perfection of the donation unless said mother had been appointed by competent court as guardian of the property of her minor child to whom the donation was made. 3. ID., REVOCATION. — A conditional donation which has been accepted in accordance with the law may be revoked by the donor, who afterwards dispose of the property donated, as though no donation had been made. 4. FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES; DAMAGE ESSENTIAL IN FRAUD; RIGHTS OF HEIRS. — In order that the conveyances of the property may be held fraudulent, it is necessary that the person alleging the fraud be possessed of an existing right over the said estate, and not merely a right in expectancy. A donation which has not been accepted in accordance with the law does not transmit any right to the donee, and the donor has power to dispose of the thing donated in favor of the\n\nThe petitioners likewise contend that the document was a valid donation as only donations are accepted by the donees. However, the petitioners could not have accepted something, which by the terms of the supposed \"donation\" was not given to them at the time. The affidavit could not transmit ownership except in clear and express terms. Furthermore, the homestead application was later prosecuted in the name of Arsenio Seville and the land, much later, was mortgaged by him to the Philippine National Bank (Annex 1, p. 100, Rollo) in consideration of a loan. Arsenio dealt with the land and entered into transactions as its owner. All these happened with the knowledge and acquiescence of the supposed donee, Melquiades Seville. Contrary to the petitioners' allegations in their brief, there was no immediate transfer of title upon the execution of Exhibit 4. Contrary to what the petitioners aver, private respondents as legal heirs of Arsenio Seville have actual and substantial interests in the subject of litigation thus qualifying them as real parties-in-interest.\n\n12\n\nthird person after the revocation of said donation. The donee in such a case cannot allege that the conveyance is fraudulent on the mere ground that the purchaser had knowledge of the donation, inasmuch as the donee has not acquired any right over the estate which could have been injured, and even if the donee were a presumptive heir, he cannot allege the conveyance to be fraudulent, for his right as an heir is but a right in expectancy. DECISION\n\nhaving been fraudulently made. The last error assails the omission of the court a quo to decree the registration of the donation in the name of the donees. It appears that Sy Lioc Suy, one of the defendants, executed on April 23, 1918, a deed of donation Exhibit A in the favor of his minor children represented by their mother, the herein plaintiff, which was accepted on the same date in the document Exhibit B. Later on, that is, on July 5, 1919, the same Sy Lioc Suy executed the document Exhibit D, revoking said donation, and on July 12 of the same year, he executed another document of purchase and sale of the same property, Exhibit C, in favor of the other defendants in the amount of P45,000. The first question raised by the appellant deals with the nature of the donation under consideration. The fifth clause of the deed of donation contains an obligation on the part of the person, accepting the donation on behalf of the donees, to provide the donee with lodging, food, clothing, and laundry, medical attendance and medicine, and all other things necessary for his subsistence during his lifetime, this obligation to cease upon the destruction of the property by accident of fortuitous event. The appellant contends that such a donation is pure, and not, as was held by the court a quo, conditional or onerous. We concur with the trial court in that donation involves a condition or burden which must be complied with by the donees. Articles 618 and 619 of Civil Code give an idea of the different kind"
