In the film, a professional writer witnesses a murder. He decides not to testify on behalf of an innocent man accused of the crime, wishing to protect his own reputation. The innocent man spends 15 years in prison for the murder. Once released, he tries to clear his name.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nPromising writer Christopher Drew conceals his relationship with a murdered woman in order to protect his career, even though this results in an innocent man going to prison for the killing.\n\nThe upper-class Drew decides he needs some first-hand experience to invigorate his work, so he explores the seedier areas of town in search of inspiration. Much to his dismay, he witnesses a murder, but he then refuses to help an innocent man, Herbert Logan, who has been arrested for the crime, because his presence in such a neighbourhood would cause a scandal. Logan is freed after serving 15 years in jail. He hears his \"crime\" detailed in a radio drama written by Drew and gathers enough evidence to clear his name.[5]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Todd as Herbert Edward Logan\n\nPatricia Plunkett as Rosie\n\nStephen Murray as Christopher Drew\n\nMichael Laurence as Jim Heal\n\nVida Hope as Olive Mockson\n\nRosalyn Boulter as Frankie Ketchen\n\nJames Hayter as 'Jocko': John Cragie Glenn\n\nHarry Fowler as Dave\n\nGeorge Hayes as Artist\n\nMichael Brennan as Inspector Benstead\n\nJoan Dowling as Gracie\n\nMichael Medwin as Len\n\nMary Merrall as Mrs. Drew\n\nIrene Handl as Inn owner\n\nJohn Salew as Ainsley, Prosecutor\n\nRobert Harris as Sir Huntley, Defence counsel\n\nKynaston Reeves as The Judge\n\nHelen Cherry as Mary Drew\n\nFrederick Leister as The Vicar\n\nEdward Lexy as the Second Prison Warder\n\nValentine Dyall as Toastmaster\n\nCharles Lloyd Pack as Theatre Critic\n\nAndreas Malandrinos as Nicholas\n\nGeorge Merritt (actor) as Engine Driver\n\nKenneth Moore (1914-1982) - as Prison Warder\n\nAlan Wheatley as Librarian\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was the first film to be made at Elstree Studios since it re-opened following World War II.[6] Richard Todd was cast after a screen test. It was his first leading role. His casting was announced in July 1948. He was also signed to a seven-year contract with Associated British.[7] The film led to Todd being cast in The Hasty Heart.[8]\n\nKenneth More has one of his first film roles.[9]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New York Times called it \"a drab and dreary little film\".[10] On the other hand, Sky Movies calls it a \"gripping movie drama which has a lot of high feeling and style. ... Still impressive, though more than 40 years after.\"[11]\n\nTodd called it \"dreary\" but it led to him being offered a long-term contract with Associated British.[12]\n\nBox Office\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1 April 1950 the film earned distributor's gross receipts of £71,954 in the UK of which £38,467 went to the producer.[1]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
