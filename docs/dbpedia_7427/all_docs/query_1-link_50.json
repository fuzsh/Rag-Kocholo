What you send CCSO must be signed by the subject being trespassed. If this is not done, the trespass is NOT valid.\n\nSend a copy of page 1 and page 2 along with the copy of the return receipt (green card) to:\n\nCitrus County Sheriff’s Office\n\nATTN: Trespass Warning Registration Center\n\n1 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Avenue\n\nInverness FL 34450\n\nUpon receipt of the copies, the documents will be reviewed and approved.

If the subject is no longer on the premises, a report will be completed and you may be referred to the State Attorney’s Office to pursue charges against the subject who violated the trespass warning.\n\n**** The trespass warning is NOT an injunction for protection. To obtain an injunction, contact the Clerk of Courts (341-6400)."
