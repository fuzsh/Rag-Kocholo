        "text": "You can give someone a written or verbal trespass notice if you want them to leave a property or premises that you own or legally occupy (for example, rent or lease). If you give someone a trespass notice, it’s important to let Police know.\n\nIf something is happening now or there is a threat to life or property call 111.\n\nThere are several reasons you might want someone to leave your home or workplace. They may be committing an offence on your property or premises (for example, shoplifting), being disorderly or have no right to be there.\n\nWritten trespass\n\nTo serve a written trespass:\n\nGet a copy of the trespass notice template, either by:\n\nprinting the online trespass notice form (PDF 455KB)\n\ngoing to your local Police station\n\nFill out and sign the notice. You need 3 copies in total – one for:\n\nyourself (if you photocopied the form, keep the original)\n\nthe person you are serving the trespass notice on\n\nPolice (you can also send us a scan).\n\nServe the notice in one of these ways:\n\nhand it to the person – it is still considered served if they drop it on the ground\n\ndrop it at their feet if they refuse to accept it\n\nhire a document service company to deliver it\n\nask someone else to serve it on your behalf, for example, a friend (it’s a good idea to give them permission to do so in writing)\n\ncourier it by registered mail to the person’s home address using a tracking number (make sure you keep the receipt).\n\nIf you serve the notice to the person and they drop it or refuse to accept it, keep that copy and write on it what happened.\n\nThere is no legal requirement to give a trespass notice in writing. However, if you give a written trespass notice to someone in person then they know:\n\nabout the notice\n\nthat they must leave and not return.\n\nIf you are trespassing more than person, and/or for more than one property/premises, you need one trespass notice per person, per property/premises.\n\nVerbal trespass\n\nTo deliver a trespass notice verbally, tell the person in clear terms they must leave the property and not return.\n\nIf you deliver a trespass notice verbally, you should write down:\n\nthe date and time you verbally gave the trespass notice to someone\n\nwhy you are verbally giving a trespass notice to that person\n\nthe name or description of that person.\n\nHow to let Police know about a trespass notice\n\nIt’s easy to tell us you have given someone a trespass notice:\n\nreport it online: Report trespass\n\ngo to your local station to report it: Police stations\n\nIf you gave someone a written trespass notice, make sure you give us a signed copy, along with any other supporting photos or documents.\n\nIf the trespasser takes too long to leave or comes back\n\nYou must give the trespasser a reasonable amount of time to leave. If the person stays or takes an unreasonable time to leave, call 111 and ask for Police.\n\nThe trespasser must not return to your property/premises for two years. If they do come back they will have committed an offence. Call 111 and ask for Police.\n\nIf the trespasser is invited back to your property or premises\n\nIf you, or someone who lives at your property or works on your premises, invites the trespassed person back to that location, then:\n\nthey are allowed to enter into or onto the property/premises\n\nthey will not be trespassing\n\nthe invitation to return means the original trespass notice is invalid (void).\n\nIf you want to trespass the person again, you need to serve them a new trespass notice either in writing or verbally.\n\nSomeone who does not live at your property or work on your premises cannot invite the trespassed person back to that location.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can read the Trespass Act 1980 on the Legislation New Zealand website.\n\nTrespass Act 1980 – Legislation New Zealand\n\nFor more information about your rights as a landlord or tenant, contact Tenancy Services on 0800 836 262 (0800 TENANCY) or visit the website\n\nRenting and you – Tenancy Services (PDF 2.8MB)"
