        "text": "The Longmont Police Department is committed to fostering a partnership with the businesses and residential dwellings in our community as a means of ensuring public safety. We believe that the Trespass Program increases our ability to better address quality of life issues within the community. It is by working together to make our community safer that we achieve our common goals.\n\nNOTE: This is a voluntary program. Multi-family properties, businesses and HOAs may participate, but only common areas are covered; the individual residential units are not (i.e., individuals actively invited to visit a tenant).\n\nTrespass Law\n\nCity of Longmont Municipal Code: 10.24.100, Trespass\n\nPolice Authorization:\n\nEnrollment into the Trespass Program authorizes the Longmont Police Department and its officers to act as agents of owner/property management. Officers of the Longmont Police Department are specifically authorized to make reasonable requests to leave of any persons in or on the premises at a time or in a place wherein the premises are not open to the public. The officers are authorized to act as agents of the owner/property management in the barring, or subsequent arrest and prosecution of any persons who refuse a reasonable request to leave given by officers. By following these steps, any Longmont Police Officer can act as your authorized representative, even in your absence, to order trespassers to leave your property.\n\nEnrollment:\n\nEnrollment into the Trespass Program requires a notarized Trespass Affidavit English or Trespass Affidavit Spanish to be completed and returned to the Longmont Police Department, as well as the posting of trespass signs at your property. You must post no trespassing signs at your property.\n\nPlease allow 72 hours for this affidavit to post to the 911 communications CAD system. In the meantime, please retain a copy that could be emailed to a responding officer.\n\nThe affidavit MUST be notarized and returned to our staff before it can be enforced.\n\nYou may drop this off at 225 Kimbark during lobby hours or mail to Longmont Public Safety, ATTN: Trespass Affidavit, 225 Kimbark, Longmont, Colorado 80501. You may also email the document.\n\nTips for filling out this document:\n\nWe do not recommend listing a specific person on the form as this document would serve to trespass the named individual.\n\nIf you want this to include the public, who will be on your property, or do not have legitimate business or reason to be there please leave the “Specific Restrictions Information” blank or write in N/A.\n\nFor the length of the enforcement period, please write 24/7, if you want 24 hours coverage.\n\nApproved Signage:\n\nPlease find below an example of an example of a trespass sign here."
