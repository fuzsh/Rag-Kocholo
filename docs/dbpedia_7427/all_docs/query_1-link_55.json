        "text": "What do you do as the business and/or property owner?\n\nThe business owner, representative or property owner completes a one-page Trespass Affidavit containing the following information:\n\nName of the business or property and the location where the Trespass Affidavit is in effect.\n\nIdentifying demographics of owner or representative along with an address for subpoenas for prosecutorial purposes along with telephone number(s).\n\nSignature of the owner or representative.\n\nA notary must complete the remainder of the form and the affidavit must be signed in the presence of the notary by the affiant. The original affidavit is retained by the police department for filing and reference. The completed affidavit may be given to any Tampa Police officer for filing.\n\nWhat are the business and/or property owner's responsibilities?\n\nThe business representative, owner or property owner assumes the following responsibilities. If the representative or owner no longer wishes the department to act as an agent, they must notify the department in writing. When a representative or owner changes representatives or management, contact numbers or subpoena address, the business or property owner is responsible for filing a new affidavit following the described procedures. If the department or court cannot contact the owner or agent, prosecution will not be pursued.\n\nThe representative or owner must affirm their assistance and testimony in a prosecution of persons arrested under the TPD Trespass Affidavit Program.\n\nThe Tampa Police Department is committed to fostering a partnership with the businesses in our community as a means of ensuring public safety. We believe the Trespass Affidavit Program will empower both police and owners in dealing with quality of life issues in the business communities, as well as, through the judicial system when resulting arrests are made."
