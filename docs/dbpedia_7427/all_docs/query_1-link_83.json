A conviction pursuant to NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 operates only to increase, not to reduce, the sentence otherwise provided by law for the principal crime.\n\n2. If a count pursuant to NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 is included in an information charging the primary offense, each previous conviction must be alleged in the accusatory pleading, but no such conviction may be alluded to on trial of the primary offense, nor may any allegation of the conviction be read in the presence of a jury trying the offense or a grand jury considering an indictment for the offense. A count pursuant to NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 may be filed separately from the indictment or information charging the primary offense, but if it is so filed, the count pursuant to NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 must be filed not less than 2 days before the start of the trial on the primary offense, unless an agreement of the parties provides otherwise or the court for good cause shown makes an order extending the time. For good cause shown, the prosecution may supplement or amend a count pursuant to NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 at any time before the sentence is imposed, but if such a supplement or amendment is filed, the sentence must not be imposed, or the hearing required by subsection 3 held, until 15 days after the separate filing.\n\n3.

At such a hearing, the defendant may not challenge the validity of a previous conviction. The court shall impose sentence:\n\n(a) Pursuant to NRS 207.010 upon finding that the defendant has suffered previous convictions sufficient to support an adjudication of habitual criminality;\n\n(b) Pursuant to NRS 207.012 upon finding that the defendant has suffered previous convictions sufficient to support an adjudication of habitual felon; or\n\n(c) Pursuant to NRS 207.014 upon finding that the defendant has suffered previous convictions sufficient to support an adjudication of habitually fraudulent felon.\n\n4. Nothing in the provisions of this section, NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 limits the prosecution in introducing evidence of prior convictions for purposes of impeachment.\n\n5. For the purposes of NRS 207.010, 207.012 and 207.014, a certified copy of a felony conviction is prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.\n\n6. Nothing in the provisions of this section, NRS 207.010, 207.012 or 207.014 prohibits a court from imposing an adjudication of habitual criminality, adjudication of habitual felon or adjudication of habitually fraudulent felon based upon an agreement of the parties.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1995, 1238; A 1997, 519, 524, 1186; 2003, 1483; 2007, 1441; 2013, 1373)\n\nVAGRANTS\n\nNRS 207.030 Prohibited acts; penalty.\n\n1.

The sheriff shall, during fair and reasonable weather, when the same can be done without extra expense to the county, procure employment for and set at work such persons convicted of violating NRS 207.030 who are serving out their term of imprisonment; and to this end, upon application of any road supervisor, superintendent, foreman or other overseer or custodian of any public works, buildings or grounds, the sheriff may deliver into the custody and charge of such person making the application such prisoners, to do labor as required, who after working hours of the day, or after suspension of labor from any cause, must be returned into the custody of the sheriff of the county for safekeeping until again required for labor.\n\n[1911 C&P § 358; RL § 6623; NCL § 10306]—(NRS A 1995, 1083)\n\nINTERFERENCE WITH EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS\n\nNRS 207.161 Definitions.

It is unlawful for a person to refuse to relinquish a public telephone immediately when the person has been informed that it is needed for an emergency call and in fact the line is needed for an emergency call and there is no other reasonably apparent and immediately accessible telephone from which to make the call.\n\n2. It is unlawful for a person to secure the use of a public telephone by falsely stating that it is needed for an emergency call.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1973, 718; A 2003, 326)\n\nNRS 207.165 Telephone directory must contain warning notice of offense provided in NRS 207.163.\n\n1.

After an information or indictment is filed regarding a violation of NRS 207.400, the prosecuting attorney may request the court to:\n\n(a) Enter a restraining order or injunction;\n\n(b) Require the execution of a satisfactory bond;\n\n(c) Appoint a receiver; or\n\n(d) Take any other necessary action,\n\nÊ to secure property which is subject to criminal forfeiture.\n\n2. The court shall, after a hearing for which notice was given to any person whose rights in the property proposed for forfeiture would be affected, order such an action if the prosecuting attorney shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the action is necessary to preserve the defendants property which is subject to criminal forfeiture.\n\n3. If no indictment or information has been filed regarding a violation of NRS 207.400, the court may, after such a hearing and upon a showing of the prosecuting attorney that:\n\n(a) There is probable cause to believe that the property for which the order is sought would be subject to criminal forfeiture; and\n\n(b) The requested order would not result in substantial and irreparable harm or injury to the party against whom the order is to be entered that outweighs the need to secure the property for the potential criminal forfeiture,\n\nÊ order an action to secure the property. Such an order may not be effective for more than 90 days unless it is extended for good cause or an indictment or information is filed regarding a violation of NRS 207.400 and the extent of the criminally forfeitable property is listed therein.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1498)\n\nNRS 207.450 Criminal forfeiture: Order of forfeiture; protection of property.\n\n1. Upon entry of a judgment for a violation of NRS 207.400, the court may order the forfeiture of the appropriate property.\n\n2. Upon entry of such an order, the court may:\n\n(a) Enter a restraining order or injunction;\n\n(b) Require the execution of a satisfactory bond;\n\n(c) Appoint a receiver; or\n\n(d) Take any other necessary action,\n\nÊ to protect the interests of the State.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1499)\n\nNRS 207.460 Civil forfeiture: Property subject to forfeiture.\n\n1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the following are subject to civil forfeiture to the State:\n\n(a) All property, real or personal, including money used in the course of, intended for use in the course of, derived from or gained through conduct in violation of NRS 207.400;\n\n(b) Any title or interest a person has acquired or maintained in violation of NRS 207.400; and\n\n(c) Any property or contractual right which affords a source of influence over any enterprise established, operated, controlled, participated in or conducted in violation of NRS 207.400.\n\n2. Upon a showing by the owner of the requisite facts, the following is not subject to forfeiture under this section:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), property used without the knowledge or consent of its owner; and\n\n(b) A means of transportation used by a person in the transaction of business as a common carrier unless it appears the owner or person in charge of the common carrier consented to or had knowledge of the violation of NRS 207.400.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1499)\n\nNRS 207.470 Civil actions for damages resulting from racketeering.\n\n1. Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of any violation of NRS 207.400 has a cause of action against a person causing such injury for three times the actual damages sustained. An injured person may also recover attorneys fees in the trial and appellate courts and costs of investigation and litigation reasonably incurred. The defendant or any injured person in the action may demand a trial by jury in any civil action brought pursuant to this section. Any injured person has a claim to forfeited property or the proceeds derived therefrom and this claim is superior to any claim the State may have to the same property or proceeds if the injured persons claim is asserted before a final decree is issued which grants forfeiture of the property or proceeds to the State.\n\n2. A final judgment or decree rendered in favor of the State in any criminal proceeding under NRS 205.322 or 207.400 estops the defendant in any subsequent civil action or proceeding from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense.\n\n3. Any civil action or proceeding under this section must be instituted in the district court of the State in the county in which the prospective defendant resides or has committed any act which subjects him or her to criminal or civil liability under this section or NRS 205.322, 207.400 or 207.460.\n\n4. Any civil remedy provided pursuant to this section is not exclusive of any other available remedy or penalty.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1501)\n\nNRS 207.480 Order of court upon determination of civil liability. A district court may, following a determination of civil liability under NRS 207.470 or 207.490, take such actions as it deems proper, including ordering the defendant to pay all costs and expenses of the proceedings.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1502)\n\nNRS 207.490 Criminal and civil forfeiture: Seizure of property before forfeiture and final disposition; order of forfeiture; intercession by Attorney General; interlocutory actions by court.\n\n1. Property subject to forfeiture under NRS 207.420 and 207.460 may be seized by a law enforcement agency upon process issued by a court. Before an order of civil forfeiture is issued and without legal process, notice of the claim for forfeiture of real property may be given in the manner provided in NRS 14.010 and 14.015. A seizure of personal property may be made without legal process if the seizure is incident to:\n\n(a) A lawful arrest or search; or\n\n(b) An inspection under an administrative warrant.\n\n2. Property seized or made the subject of notice under this section is deemed to be in the custody of the agency subject only to orders of the court which has jurisdiction over the proceedings for forfeiture. An agency which has seized such property without process shall begin the proceedings for forfeiture promptly. Such an action takes precedence over other civil proceedings. The seized property is subject to an action to claim the delivery of the property if the agency does not file the complaint for forfeiture within 60 days after the property is seized. If a complaint for forfeiture is filed after an affidavit claiming delivery, the complaint must be treated as a counterclaim.\n\n3. When property is seized under this section, pending forfeiture and final disposition, the law enforcement agency may:\n\n(a) Place the property under seal.\n\n(b) Remove the property to a place designated by the court.\n\n(c) Require another agency authorized by law to take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location.\n\n4. The district attorney may institute civil proceedings under this section for the forfeiture of property subject to forfeiture pursuant to NRS 207.460. The Attorney General may institute such proceedings when the property is seized by a state agency. If a district attorney has not instituted such a proceeding or has not pursued one which was instituted, the Attorney General may intercede after giving 30 days written notice to the district attorney of the intention to do so.\n\n5. In any action so brought, the district court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination. Pending final determination in an action brought under this section or NRS 207.470, the district court may at any time enter such injunctions, prohibitions or restraining orders, or take such actions, including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, as the court deems proper in connection with any property or interest subject to forfeiture.\n\n6. Upon a finding of civil liability under this section or NRS 207.470, the court may order the forfeiture of the appropriate property and interests.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1500)\n\nNRS 207.500 Use, sale and other disposal of forfeited property by State, county or city; payment of certain encumbrances.\n\n1. The State, county or city may sell or retain for its official use the property or interests so forfeited. If the forfeited property or interest is to be sold or otherwise disposed of, the State, county or city shall do so as soon as commercially feasible. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the proceeds from such a sale must be used:\n\n(a) First to satisfy a claim of an injured person as provided in NRS 207.470;\n\n(b) Then for payment of all proper expenses of any proceedings for the forfeiture and sale, including any expenses for the seizure and maintenance of the property, advertising and court costs; and\n\n(c) Then to repay any money received pursuant to NRS 207.415 and to pay the amount required to be paid by that section.\n\nÊ The balance of the proceeds, if any, must be deposited in the General Fund of the State or a county or city as the court provides in the order of forfeiture.\n\n2. If the property forfeited is encumbered by a bona fide security interest and the secured party shows that the secured party did not consent or have knowledge of the violation causing the forfeiture, the State shall pay the existing balance or return the property to the secured party.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1501; A 1985, 973)\n\nNRS 207.510 Parties to proceedings for forfeiture of property. No person, except one:\n\n1. Who holds a community property interest in the property;\n\n2. Whose name or interest appears on the document of title or certificate of registration of the property;\n\n3. Who is injured in his or her business or property by the violation; or\n\n4. Who can otherwise prove ownership or a bona fide security interest in the property or interest subject to forfeiture,\n\nÊ may be a party to proceeding for a forfeiture brought pursuant to NRS 207.490.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1983, 1501)\n\nNRS 207.520 Limitation of actions. A criminal action or proceeding under NRS 205.322 or 207.400 may be commenced at any time within 5 years after the conduct in violation of the section occurs. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 217.007, a civil action or proceeding under NRS 207.470 may be commenced at any time within 5 years after the violation occurs or after the injured person sustains the injury, whichever is later. If a criminal prosecution or civil action or other proceeding is brought to punish, prevent or restrain any violation of the provisions of NRS 205.322 or 207.400, the running of the period of limitations prescribed by this section with respect to any cause of action arising under NRS 207.470, which is based in whole or in part upon any matter complained of in the prosecution or proceeding, is suspended during the pendency of the prosecution or proceeding and for 2 years following termination of the prosecution or proceeding."
