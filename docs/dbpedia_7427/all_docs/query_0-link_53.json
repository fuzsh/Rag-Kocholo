        "text": "It goes without saying that you are free to behave however you so wish, and that every situation, or encounter whilst trespassing is different. However, to be published on this website we ask that you tick the box that confirms you have adhered to our code of conduct. The code is not meant to patronise you, to imply that you don’t already know how to act in nature, but to ensure that each of the trespasses on this site benefits the campaign, and does not harm it in any way. An issue that arises with decentralised campaigns like this is that any negative press caused by individual actions reflects poorly on the wider aims oif the campaign. You can go trespass how you like, but your trespass will only become a part of this collective direct action to improve national access if you can confirm you have abided by the following code:\n\nDo your best to remain polite at all times. This is a tricky one: Gamekeepers and landowners are allowed to use reasonable force when interrupting your trespass, and will often come at you with a level of aggression totally incongruous with your actions. They might goad you, patronise you, get all red-faced and shouty. But to rise to the bait not only leaves you exposed in law (rude language is considered threatening, and could up the charge to aggravated trespass) but also plays into the orthodox notion that we, the public, are a threat to nature and its community. We are not. We are accessing nature for calm, serenity, care, interest and love, not to engage in aggression conflict.\n\nOn top of all this, let’s be honest: gamekeepers are humans too. More often than not, you’ll be accosted by a young lad or a stout middle-aged man, who are operating in a distinctly patriarchal work culture. They might shout and puff their chest, just like all men who feel threatened, but since it is in their job remit to get you off the land, your presence demonstrates to their bosses that they are not doing their job properly. This puts them in a difficult position. But shouting back at a gamekeeper is as worthwhile as insulting a Vodafone call centre operative. It leaves you feeling awful, and doesn’t change the wider picture. Be like Michelle Obama, and when they go low, go high."
