        "text": "We all have seen “No Trespassing” signs, but not everyone knows what it actually means to trespass. Generally, trespassing involves being on the property of another without their permission. In New Jersey, criminal trespassing could actually involve much more than that. Anyone charged with trespassing in New Jersey should contact an experienced criminal defense attorney.\n\nWhat is Criminal Trespassing?\n\nGenerally, N.J.S.A. 2C:18-3 defines criminal trespassing as unlawful entry onto a property. There are several different ways a person can commit criminal trespass in New Jersey.\n\nOne is to surreptitiously remain in any research facility, structure, or separately secured or occupied a portion of such a structure while knowing that one is not licensed or privileged to be there.\n\nA person could also be guilty of criminal trespass if he/she peers into a window or other opening of a dwelling or structure adapted for overnight accommodation (e.g., a hotel/motel, RV, tent, etc.) for the purpose of invading the privacy of another. This type of trespass requires that a reasonable person inside would not expect to be observed. It also requires that the offender know he/she is not licensed or privileged to do so.\n\nAdditionally, a person can be considered a “defiant trespasser” if he/she enters or remains in any place where notice against trespassing is given through verbal or other communication, posting of a sign or a fence.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Criminal Trespassing and Burglary?\n\nCriminal trespassing means one has deliberately entered or remained on private property without permission. Burglary alleges the same, but also alleges one did so with the intent to commit a crime. Burglary will carry higher penalties because of the “intent to commit a crime” element. For more information, see our page on burglary.\n\nPenalties and Fines\n\nDefiant trespassing a petty disorderly persons offense. A conviction could lead to up to 30 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. Other penalties for trespassing include financial restitution (where applicable) to the victim and a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license.\n\nTrespassing on most other structures is a disorderly persons offense. The penalties for a conviction include up to 6 months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nTrespassing on school property, in a dwelling (i.e. a home), in a research facility, in a power generation facility, or in any similar facility is considered a fourth-degree crime. Likewise, trespassing by peering is a fourth-degree crime. A conviction for this level of trespassing can mean up to 18 months in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nWhen it comes to medical malpractice on an adult, a person has up to 2 years from the point at which a reasonable person might realize that malpractice has occurred.\n\nConsequences for a First Offense\n\nIn most cases, a violation of NJ trespassing laws is a fairly minor offense. A first-time offender with no prior convictions or arrests has a high chance of not being sentenced to jail time upon conviction.\n\nStill, it would be unwise to just plead guilty and accept the consequences. Even a petty disorderly persons conviction means having a criminal record that will come up in background checks and can limit job prospects. If trespassing is charged as a fourth-degree crime, it is the equivalent of being convicted of a felony, and the stigma that comes with being a “convicted felon” can have long-term negative effects on one’s life.\n\nRegardless of whether this is one’s first offense of trespassing or if one has a sizable criminal history, it is always best to consult with an attorney who can assess the facts and negotiate with prosecutors to have the charges dropped or reduced.\n\nConsequences for Juveniles\n\nYoung kids and teens often push boundaries and test authority—it’s just part of being young and growing up. A juvenile charged with trespassing should be treated lightly by a judge in Family Court. However, that does not always happen.\n\nIt is not uncommon for minor instances of trespassing to be overblown by prosecutors and for juveniles to suffer unnecessary punishments, including time in a detention facility. It is critical for anyone whose child has been charged with trespassing in New Jersey to hire a skilled defense attorney to fight the charges and seek either a dismissal or reduced charge with less serious consequences.\n\nDefenses to Criminal Trespassing\n\nThere are three main defenses that an experienced attorney can raise to help avoid a conviction. First, if the structure entered was abandoned, one usually will be able to avoid a conviction. Second, if the location was open to members of the public at the time the defendant allegedly trespassed and he/she complied with all the lawful conditions imposed on gaining access and remaining in the structure, then one will be able to avoid a conviction. Lastly, a person can avoid a conviction if he/she reasonably believed that the owner (or someone else with the authority to give permission) would have:\n\ngiven him/her access to the structure;\n\nallowed him/her to remain there; or\n\nlet him/her peer into it.\n\nIn most cases, trespassing is a minor offense, although a conviction can result in a permanent criminal record and all the associated hardships. Thankfully, with the help of a skilled defense attorney, it may be possible to avoid a conviction or reduce the charges to a lesser offense that will not establish a criminal record.\n\nWhat if I’ve Been Charged With Criminal Trespassing?\n\nIf you or someone you know is facing charges for criminal trespassing, it is important to contact an attorney right away. There are defenses and other options available that would clear you of charges or give you the opportunity to face lesser penalties. A good attorney will put you in the best position to overcome these charges.\n\nContact an Attorney\n\nYou should not navigate the complexities of criminal law procedures on your own. Criminal trespassing could have serious short- and long-term repercussions. For this reason, one of the most important things to do is to find an experienced attorney who you trust, and start the legal process with that attorney in your corner.\n\nExpunge a Trespassing Conviction\n\nA person convicted of trespassing may have the option of getting his/her criminal record cleared (expunged) if he/she otherwise meets the necessary criteria. This means having no more than 5 disorderly persons offenses on the record, or 3 disorderly persons offenses and 1 indictable (felony) offense.\n\nIn addition, one cannot be convicted of any offense that would disqualify a person from expungement, such as aggravated sexual assault or robbery. To find out more about the expungement process, how it works, and whether one is eligible to file a petition, visit our expungement page and contact one of our attorneys for a free consultation.\n\nClean Slate Law\n\nIn 2019, New Jersey enacted a new clean slate law that allows a person who has not been convicted of a crime in 10 years and has expungeable offenses on their record to have them cleared from their criminal record in full. This means that the person is eligible if they have convictions of one of more disorderly offenses and/or indictable crimes that are eligible for expungement. The person must have fulfilled all obligations of prior convictions in order to be considered. Conversely, if they are convicted for any offense that would disqualify them from expungement (i.e., sexual assault or robbery), they will not be eligible for clean slate. It is also worth noting that having had a conviction expunged in one’s past does not remove them from eligibility for a clean slate.\n\nCase Law Analysis\n\nWho Should I Contact?\n\nIf you or a loved one was recently charged with criminal trespassing in New Jersey, contact Rosenblum Law today.
