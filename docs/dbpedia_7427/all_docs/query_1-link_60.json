        "text": "For landowners, the nuisance of potential trespassers and the liability that comes with them is a real concern. Because of this issue, many owners of private land must take special care to post the appropriate signage to deter passersby or people with nefarious intentions from going in.\n\nA formal “no trespassing” sign may differ in format and content from state to state since trespassing laws vary across the country, but all states have them in some form or another.\n\nBut what is trespassing, exactly? Generally speaking, criminal trespassing is defined as “entering or remaining on another’s property without the owner’s consent”, but each state has its own specification as well. The consequences for this crime also vary from state to state, but may include fines or jail time. However, the penalty may be more severe if significant damage is done to the property.\n\nWhy Post a “No Trespassing” Sign?\n\nProperty owners have greater legal recourse if they have the properly written notices posted. Below we break down the trespassing laws and notice/signage requirements for all 50 states as a guideline when creating your property’s signage.\n\nWhile most states do not have specific guidelines on the sign text itself, it can be a good idea to familiarize yourself with the appropriate statute that can be listed at the bottom of your sign for reference, should you want to include it in the notice.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: The following information is not official legal advice, and any laws listed may be subject to change. For official legal counsel on property concerns, consult an attorney or another legal professional.\n\nAlabama\n\nAccording to Alabama law, “A person is guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises.”\n\nNo trespassing signs in Alabama must be reasonably likely to come to the attention of intruders and should provide a reference to the legal code Title 13A. Criminal Code § 13A-7-4.\n\nAlaska\n\nIn Alaska’s trespassing statute, AS 11.46.350, notice against trespassing must be either personally communicated or given by posting “in a reasonably conspicuous manner under the circumstances.”\n\nNotices should be placed at all access points to the property, be legible in English, and contain specific prohibitions such as no trespassing, digging, hunting, etc.\n\nArizona\n\nArizona’s trespassing law, A.R.S. §13-1502, states that property owners must provide a reasonable notice prohibiting entry.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas statute Ark. Code Ann. § 5-39-203 states that criminal trespassing occurs when a “person unlawfully enters either someone’s property or vehicle.”\n\nViolations of this statute are a Class C misdemeanor unless the land is clearly marked with a “No Trespassing” or “Keep Out” sign.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia Penal Code Section 602 PC includes over thirty different forms of trespassing, but all adhere to the same general elements of willfully entering or remaining on someone else’s property.\n\nLandowners should have either “No Trespassing” signs posted, and/or enclose their land with a fence.\n\nColorado\n\nThe law in Colorado is fairly strict regarding trespassing, and may even be considered a felony if criminal intent is involved. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-4-504 considers it criminal trespassing if a person “unlawfully enters or remains in or upon premises of another.”\n\nNo trespassing notices may include the statute citation at the bottom.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUnder Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-110a, a first-degree criminal trespass occurs when a “person enters or remains in a building or any other premises after an order to leave or not to enter personally communicated to such person by the owner of the premises or other authorized person.”\n\nDelaware\n\n11 Del.

The markings must be visible, starting at least three inches off the ground and covering the top two inches of the post.\n\nIowa\n\nUnder Iowa Code § 716.8, “Any person who knowingly trespasses upon the property of another commits a simple misdemeanor.” However, the intent of the trespasser is also taken into consideration, and may alter the degree of misdemeanor.\n\nKansas\n\nThe state trespassing law in Kansas, Kan. Stat.

Code, Crim. Law § 6-402 states that “ person may not enter or trespass on property that is posted conspicuously against trespass”, specifying that signs must be placed where they can reasonably be seen, or paint marks must conform with regulations of the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nPaint marks must be placed on trees located at each road entrance to the property, as well as those adjacent to public spaces.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nIn Massachusetts, M.G.L. c. 266, § 120 states that trespassing occurs when “Whoever, without right, enters or remains in or upon the dwelling house, buildings, boats or improved or enclosed land, wharf, or pier of another, or enters or remains in a school bus … after having been forbidden so to do by the person who has lawful control of said premises, whether directly or by notice posted thereon…”\n\nA formal notice must be communicated by posting of a “no trespassing” sign on the property or direct notification.\n\nMichigan\n\nUnder Mich. Comp.

The sign must carry a general warning against trespassing.\n\nMississippi\n\nThe trespassing law in Mississippi, defined in Mississippi Code Title 97. Crimes § 97-17-93, states that trespassing occurs when “Any person who knowingly enters the lands of another without the permission of or without being accompanied by the landowner or the lessee of the land, or the agent of such landowner or lessee…”\n\nWhile landowners are not required to post no trespassing signs on their property, it is recommended, as they have more legal recourse in the event of a trespassing incident.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri statute Mo. Rev. Stat. § 569.140, says that trespassing occurs when “property is fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders or as to which notice against trespass is given…”\n\nThe notice must be given through actual communication to the actor or posting in a manner that is reasonably likely to come to the attention of intruders.\n\nMontana\n\nMCA § 45-6-203 defines trespassing as when “A person enters or remains unlawfully in or upon any vehicle, occupied structure, or premises when the person is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to do so.”\n\nTo meet the requirements for posting on private land, the notice must:\n\nBe placed on a post, structure, or natural object with at least 50 square inches of fluorescent orange paint\n\nAppear on outer gates and normal points of access\n\nNebraska\n\nNebraska’s laws against trespassing, as listed in Neb.
