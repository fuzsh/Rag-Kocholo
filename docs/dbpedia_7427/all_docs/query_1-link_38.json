HOW WILL IT BE USEFUL TO ME?\n\nA Trespass Letter of Consent (TLC) is a specifically worded, legal document which allows a police officer to take enforcement action, on your behalf, without contacting you first.\n\nPolice officers do not have the authority to go onto private property and remove individuals or request them to leave without the consent of the property owner. If an officer observes someone on private property, when the business is closed, or a problem is called in by someone who does not have the authority to sign a trespass complaint, MPD must then contact the person who is legally responsible for the property. A Trespass Letter of Consent gives Monroe Police officers permission to act on the property owner's/manager's behalf, in trespass situations.\n\nOfficers who observe trespassers on private property can then immediately address the problem, rather than be delayed in acting or be unable to take action at all.\n\nWHAT IS THE LAW REGARDING TRESPASSING IN MONROE?\n\nMMC 9.10.140 - Criminal trespass\n\nRCW 9A.52.070 - Criminal Trespass in the first degree - A person is guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree if he or she knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building.\n\nRCW 9A.52.080 - Criminal Trespass in the second degree - A person is guilty of criminal trespass in the second degree if he or she knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon the premises of another under circumstances not constituting criminal trespass in the first degree.\n\nRCW 9A.52.010(3) - \"Premises\" includes any building, dwelling, structure used for commercial aquaculture, or any real property.\n\nRCW 9A.52.105 & 9A.52.115 also provide additional information regarding the removal of unauthorized persons.\n\nWHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO DO?\n\nIn addition to filing the trespass letter, your property must be posted with \"No Trespassing\" signs for immediate enforcement action. These signs should not include any language directed at loitering as there is no law that can be enforced regarding loitering. If there is not a \"No Trespassing\" sign present, the Officer will issue a notice of trespass form for future enforcement.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nShould an officer respond to your property, he/she will be notified by dispatch if there is a Trespass Letter of Consent filed on the property. Once the letter has been confirmed, the officer will take appropriate action.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF I CHANGE MY MIND OR SELL MY PROPERTY?\n\nYou may revoke your Trespass Letter of Consent at any time. Simply notify us of your wishes in writing at PD records by email here and your letter will be removed from the records. Although trespass letters have no expiration date, if the status of the property changes in any way, we ask that you notify us as soon as possible and arrange for your trespass letter to be updated.\n\nTo submit a Trespass Letter of Consent: Trespass Letter Application"
