        "text": "Because this is the sort of thing I do for fun I thought I'd share a bit of sleuthing regarding the Lord's Prayer.\n\nHave you ever noticed when praying the Lord's Prayer aloud that everybody does good until you get to the line \"forgive us our...\"?\n\nAt that point in the prayer cacophony breaks out as some people say \"debts\" and others say \"trespasses.\"\n\nThe other day I got curious about that and went in search of the translations that render this differently. I started with the NIV:\n\nNIV:\n\nOur Father in heaven,\n\nhallowed be your name,\n\nyour kingdom come,\n\nyour will be done,\n\non earth as it is in heaven.\n\nGive us today our daily bread.\n\nAnd forgive us our debts,\n\nas we also have forgiven our debtors...\n\nOkay, so the NIV has \"debts.\" So I went on to look at other translations. And guess what? There is almost universal agreement among the major translations, all having \"debts\" like the NIV:\n\nESV, ASV, NASV, KJV, NRSV, NJ:\n\nour debts...our debtors.\n\nTo be sure, some more modern, dynamic and contemporary translations have \"sins\" or \"wrongs.\" But none of these, along with the more established translations, have \"trespasses.\"\n\nSo that left me scratching my head. Where in the world did \"trespasses\" come from?\n\nGiven that I use the Book of Common Prayer I knew it had \"trespasses.\" So my hunch was that \"forgive us our trespasses\" came from the BCP rather than from the bible translations. I'm using the 1979 BCP. But just to make sure I went back to the 1549 edition, the very first BCP. And sure enough, \"forgive us our trespasses\" is there:\n\nBook of Common Prayer (1549):\n\nOURE father, whiche arte in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kyngdom come. Thy wyll be done in earth as it is in heaven. Geve us this daye oure dayly bread. And forgeve us oure trespasses, as we forgeve them that trespasse agaynst us. And leade us not into temptacion. But deliver us from evell. Amen.\n\nBut that raises another question. Where did the 1549 BCP come up with this translation? Recall, the Authorized (King James) Version didn't appear until 1611.\n\nAfter some sleuthing I learned that the 1549 edition of the BCP used the Tyndale Bible (1526). And checking the Tyndale Bible I think we find the origin of \"forgive us our trespasses\":\n\nTyndale Bible (1526):\n\nAnd forgeve vs oure treaspases eve as we forgeve oure trespacers.\n\nIn short, from the KJV onward the translation of Matthew 6.12 has gone with \"debts.\" But the 1526 Tyndale Bible had it as \"trespasses.\" This translation was used in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer and is preserved in the BCP to the present day.\n\nIt's a Tyndale vs. King James thing.\n\nAnd thus the cacophony in our churches.\n\nLeave a Reply"
