        "text": "KJV Dictionary Definition: trespass\n\ntrespass\n\nTRES'PASS, v.i. L. trans, beyond, and passer, to pass.\n\n1. Literally, to pass beyond; hence primarily, to pass over the boundary line of another's land; to enter unlawfully upon the land of another. A man may trespass by walking over the ground of another, and the law gives a remedy for damages sustained.\n\n2. To commit any offense or to do any act that injures or annoys another; to violate any rule of rectitude to the injury of another.\n\nIf any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him-- 1 Kings 8. See Luke 17. 3. and 4.\n\n3. In a moral sense, to transgress voluntarily any divine law or command; to violate any known rule of duty.\n\nIn the time of his disease did he trespass yet more. 2 Chron.28.\n\nWe have trespassed against our God. Ezra 10.\n\n4. To intrude; to go too far; to put to inconvenience by demand or importunity; as, to trespass upon the time or patience of another.\n\nTRES'PASS, n. In law, violation of another's rights, not amounting to treason, felony, or misprision of either. Thus to enter another's close, is a trespass; to attack his person is a trespass. When violence accompanies the act, it is called a trespass vi et armis.\n\n1. Any injury or offense done to another.\n\nIf ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Matt.6.\n\n2. Any voluntary transgression of the moral law; any violation of a known rule of duty; sin. Col.2.\n\nYou hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins. Eph.2.\n\ntrespasser\n\nTRES'PASSER, n. One who commits a trespass; one who enters upon another's land or violates his rights.\n\n1. A transgressor of the moral law; an offender; a sinner.\n\ntrespassing\n\nTRES'PASSING, ppr. Entering another man's inclosure; injuring or annoying another; violating the divine law or moral duty."
