        "text": "The following questions were submitted to John Roska, whose column, \"The Law Q&A,\" ran in the Champaign News Gazette.\n\nQuestion\n\nI inherited a house that I rented out to a family friend. They stopped paying rent, so I called the police to have them removed as a trespasser. The police said they couldn’t do anything because it was a civil matter. Isn’t trespassing criminal? Why can’t they do something?\n\nAnswer\n\nTrespassing can be both a criminal or civil matter. Your situation was a landlord-tenant matter, which is civil. You have to evict. The police can’t just arrest unwanted tenants.\n\nUnder the Illinois Criminal Code, trespass is misdemeanor. This can get you 30 days to 6 months in jail, and a maximum $500 fine.\n\nCriminal trespass to real property happens two basic ways:\n\nWhen someone enters after being warned not to, or\n\nWhen someone won’t leave after being asked.\n\nThe second type happens when someone stays on someone else's property after being told to leave.\n\nThat may sound like it covers your landlord-tenant situation, but it doesn't. The criminal law does not apply to anyone with a lease agreement with the owner or their agent. It also doesn’t apply to anyone invited there by a tenant.\n\nCriminal trespass mostly occurs when someone refuses to leave a business or public area. It's rarely to get rid of someone who claims a right to live somewhere.\n\nSo, it’s not criminal trespass for the tenant to refuse to leave after a landlord asks. The police should stay out. Getting involved and arresting the tenant, is illegally evicting the tenant.\n\nThe legal way to get rid of someone who moves in with permission, and won’t leave, is an eviction. That’s done by following the Eviction Actin the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. It’s designed to settle landlord-tenant disputes peacefully.\n\nThe Act is meant to stop people from using force or violence to take back their property.\n\nLandlords can’t call the police, and can’t just do it themselves. They must follow the rules set out in the law.\n\nThose rules boil down to two steps:\n\nNotice, and\n\nA court case.\n\nThe written notice is required before the court case. So, you can’t take step two without properly completing step one. If the notice doesn’t say the right things, or isn’t delivered correctly, case, then that case can be dismissed.\n\nDoing things right isn’t hard, and doesn’t take long. In Champaign County, it’s possible to go from notice to eviction court in less than a month."
