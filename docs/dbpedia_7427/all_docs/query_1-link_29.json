        "text": "When a person or group of people enters private property without the present owner’s consent, they’re committing what is called criminal trespass.\n\nAccording to Texas criminal trespass laws, this offense has several stages, as well as multiple defenses that can be utilized to fight charges.\n\nIt’s important to get acquainted with these laws in order to defend yourself against any unjust allegations. On that account, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide on trespassing laws in the Lone Star State.\n\nWhat Is Considered Criminal Trespassing in Texas?\n\nAs defined by the Texas Penal Code 30.05, criminal trespassing is the act of intentionally entering private property without the owner’s consent.\n\nSeveral things can fall under the category of private property, such as:\n\nResidential land\n\nAgricultural land\n\nRV park\n\nBuilding\n\nCar\n\nAircraft\n\nOther vehicles\n\nFurther, a person is considered a trespasser and has broken the law if they were asked to leave but refused to do so.\n\nCriminal trespass may also be charged against someone whose right to remain on the property has been terminated.\n\nTrespass Notices in Texas\n\nTo establish criminal trespass, the prosecution must first show that the defendant was fully aware of all notices and prohibitions. But what exactly qualifies as proper notice?\n\nThere are several methods of giving a trespass notice.\n\n1. Direct Communication From the Owner\n\nThe owner or someone authorized to act on behalf of the owner may write to or speak with the trespassing party.\n\nThis suggests that a text message, phone call, email, or verbal communication from the property owner informing the intruder that they aren’t welcome on the property qualifies as enough notice.\n\n2. Signs\n\nA clear sign displayed in front of a property that indicates entrance is prohibited counts as reasonable notice. Some examples include “Keep Out” and “No Trespassing” signs.\n\n3. Purple Markings\n\nAccording to the state of Texas, purple markings on trees or posts are considered viable notices. They are typically located on properties that are being developed in woodlands.\n\nThese markings, however, must meet certain requirements to be considered legitimate notices. For example, they must be:\n\nVertical lines that are no less than eight inches long and one inch wide.\n\nNo less than three feet from the ground and no more than five feet from the ground.\n\nEasily visible to anyone approaching the property.\n\nNo more than 100 feet apart on woodland properties and no more than 1,000 feet apart on non-forest lands.\n\n4. Crops\n\nVisible crops that are being harvested or cultivated for consumption naturally serve as a clear notice. Even if the land isn’t encircled by a fence, entry is forbidden if it includes crops that may be harmed by trespassing.\n\n5. Fencing\n\nAny fencing or other enclosure put up to exclude intruders or to contain livestock.\n\nTexas Trespassing Laws: Overview\n\nA criminal trespassing charge is issued when a defendant enters someone else’s property while aware that entry is forbidden.\n\nUnder Texas law, there are four methods for a private property owner to provide legal notice:\n\nA verbal or written statement that forbids trespassing.\n\nA clear sign prohibiting entry.\n\nA piece of land containing crops.\n\nVisible purple paint markings on trees or posts\n\nFencing or other enclosures\n\nThere are three penalty classifications for a criminal trespassing charge.\n\nClass A: the defendant is carrying a deadly weapon—the penalty is one year in prison and a $4,000 fine.\n\nClass B: the defendant trespassed on a prohibited property—the penalty is 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.\n\nClass C: the trespasser is arrested within 100 feet of agricultural land—the penalty is a $500 fine.\n\nAs per defenses, defendants usually go with one of these three:\n\nUnclear signage: notice isn’t clear enough.\n\nPublic necessity: trespassing to assist the public.\n\nPrivate necessity: trespassing to protect an individual.\n\nPenalties for Trespassing in Texas\n\nAccording to the Texas Penal Code, criminal trespassing is automatically considered a class B misdemeanor. This has a penalty of 180 days in prison and a $2,000 fine.\n\nHowever, there are a few circumstances in which criminal trespassing may be upgraded to a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nThese instances include:\n\nThe trespasser is carrying a lethal weapon capable of causing injury or death.\n\nTrespassing on a property where the defendant has a prior criminal conviction.\n\nThat said, a Class A misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of one year in prison along with a $4,000 fine. On the other hand, criminal trespassing can be reduced to a Class C misdemeanor.\n\nFor instance, if a person trespasses on agricultural land (farm or ranch) and is arrested within 100 feet of the property’s perimeter, the court then downgrades the offense to a Class C misdemeanor. This is punishable by a fine of up to $500.\n\nDefenses to Trespassing Charges in Texas\n\nThere are trespassing protections that apply to public workers, such as firefighters, emergency medical responders, utility workers, and other employees of the service industry who typically enter residences regularly.\n\nIf they’re charged with criminal trespassing, it would be simple to prove that they were merely on the job. This, of course, depends on the nature and the time of day of the alleged trespass.\n\nAside from public workers, if you’ve been wrongfully charged with criminal trespassing, one of these three defenses is your best bet.\n\nUnclear Signage\n\nWhat if you didn’t receive adequate notice to depart? This takes us back to the signage.\n\nFor example, you come across what appears to be an open area near a lake or pond. You settle down to enjoy the sun and maybe do some fishing.\n\nThe next thing you know, you’re being arrested for trespassing. It turns out that some properties have some form of sign, but it’s hardly visible and sometimes even in obscure locations.\n\nIn this case, a good attorney may get your case dismissed entirely.\n\nPublic Necessity\n\nThis protection works best in times of crisis, such as a natural disaster. Public necessity constitutes that you only trespassed to assist the public during an emergency.\n\nPrivate Necessity\n\nWhile not the most powerful defense against a criminal trespassing charge, private necessity is a feasible option for a person who trespassed on private property to protect someone else from physical harm or death.\n\nGet Help For Your Defense Against Criminal Trespass Charge\n\nCriminal trespassing is simply being somewhere you shouldn’t be, and the penalties are to be taken seriously. Even if it was an unintentional mistake, it can be difficult to get out of."
