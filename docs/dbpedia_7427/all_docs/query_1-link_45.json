        "text": "Nick Hayes\n\nThe Book of Trespass\n\nCommissioned | Professional\n\nWhy did you make this work:\n\nI had written a non-fiction book about the English right to freely wander the land and swim its rivers. This is a highly controversial subject in England, so I wanted to illustrate the text myself, first to prove that not every trespasser is a wanton vandal, and second, to put the reader inside these forbidden lands, to allow them to see what is denied, a kind of trespass of the eyes.\n\nHow was the illustration used:\n\nThese form part of a series of 11 illustrations, plus two extra images and chapter headings, that appear throughout the book. They were used to emphasise the dark, witchy tone of the book, to add to the themes of folklore and ghosts that haunt the text.\n\nHow did you make this work:\n\nThis is a technique I created to mimic linocut, that uses a paint brush and ink to make the same marks as a scorper. I call it lie-no, or li-not. The image is then scanned in and inverted in Photoshop to mimic the print process. This allows me to work in greater detail, and with perhaps a bit more flow, as I am painting rather than digging.\n\nCommissioner Company :\n\nBloomsbury\n\nSocial Media:\n\ntwitter.com/nickhayesillus1\n\ninstagram.com/nickhayesillustration\n\nPersonal Website:\n\nfoghornhayes.com\n\nAgent Website:\n\nhttps://folioart.co.uk\n\nCurrently Based:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBiography:\n\nNick Hayes studied English at University and an Art Foundation at LCC in London. He has four graphic novels published by Random House, and this work of non-fiction, The Book of Trespass, with Bloomsbury."
