Biography

Schirach was born in Berlin in 1907 to a noble family of Sorbian West Slavic origins. Schirach joined a Wehrjugendgruppe (military cadet group) at the age of 10 and became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1925.

In 1929, he became the leader of the National Socialist German Students' League. On October 30th, 1931, he was named as Reichsjugendf√ºhrer (Youth Leader, the highest rank of the Hitlerjugend program) of the Nazi Party. In 1932, he married Henriette Hoffmann, the daughter of Heinrich Hoffmann, who was Adolf Hitler's personal photographer. Schirach's family was opposed to this marriage, but Hitler insisted.

In 1940, Schirach became a Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of the Reichsgau Wien (encompassing the City of Vienna and its suburbs). Schirach was a huge anti-Semite, responsible for sending most of the Jews from Vienna to Nazi concentration camps. During his tenure, 65,000 Jews were deported. In a speech on September 15th, 1942, he said that their deportation was a "contribution to European culture."
