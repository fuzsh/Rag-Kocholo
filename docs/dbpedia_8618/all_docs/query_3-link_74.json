U  B M R L Schirach: Eine Generation zwischen Goethe und Hitler. By O R. Vienna: Molden. .  pp. €. ISBN ––––. ‘I was one of you’. is was the epitaph engraved on the tombstone of Baldur von Schirach aer his death in . Under the ird Reich, Schirach, as the leader of the Hitler Youth organization, had overseen the indoctrination of more than eight million young people between the ages of ten and eighteen, before taking up the position of Gauleiter of Vienna between  and , a role in which he— among administrative, cultural, and representative tasks—oversaw the deportation of , Viennese Jews. e reaction by the public and by Schirach’s closest family to his epitaph’s enigmatic claim of belonging, which he himself had requested before his death, ranged from bewilderment to indignation. Indeed, Schirach’s oldest son, Klaus, once laconically remarked that he liked it because later he would be able to counter on his own tombstone: ‘I was not one of you’. In , the contested monument was ﬁnally removed, as Oliver Rathkolb recounts in the ﬁnal pages of his new Schirach biography, when the grave was levelled aer the family decided not to renew the lease. is tombstone—and, indeed, its removal—is nonetheless emblematic of the life of a man who, following his appointment in Vienna, ultimately fell from favour, having strayed from the Nazi Party’s cultural line. Aer his twenty-year prison sentence in Spandau, during which Schirach remained almost completely isolated from German post-war discourse, he struggled not only to reconnect with his family but also to oﬀer the answers and apologies younger generations demanded of him. It is ﬁtting, therefore, that Rathkolb’s biography engages with Schirach’s political rise (and fall) before and during the ird Reich, as well as his trial, imprisonment, and subsequent attempts at shaping his own myth of having been a blindly devoted believer in Hitler. Over fourteen chapters, Rathkolb delivers a fascinating, detailed, and oen sharp-tongued chronicle of Schirach’s life (and aerlife). His vivid account covers Schirach’s family and his youth in conservative Weimar (Chapters –); his student years in Munich, during which he devoted more of his time to Hitler and the growing Nazi Party than the literature he purported to study (Chapters –); as well as Schirach’s rise through the party ranks aided by his own ambition, persistence, and sometimes sheer luck, along with his inﬂuence on NS propaganda and educational politics (Chapter ). It is to Schirach’s role as Gauleiter of Vienna, however, that Rathkolb devotes the greatest number of pages (Chapters –). If the book’s ﬁrst part delivers a comprehensive and well-written account of Schirach’s political rise to power, then these Vienna chapters are where Rathkolb’s study truly shines. MLR, .,   Drawing on materials from Viennese archives, including speeches, newspaper reports , court documents, and eyewitness accounts, Rathkolb highlights Schirach’s shiing cultural allegiances, while simultaneously illustrating the complex power struggles within the Nazi Party, especially as it became increasingly apparent that the Germans were losing the war. Rathkolb also devotes much space to presenting evidence that Schirach, contrary to his own statements at the Nuremberg trials and aer his release from prison, had indeed been aware of the full extent of the crimes committed against Viennese Jews, forced labourers, and other persecuted groups under his jurisdiction. Either by highlighting omissions and half-truths in Schirach’s own narrative or by placing his statements opposite convincing counter-evidence, Rathkolb continually and relentlessly holds Schirach accountable , not only for the crimes he authorized and ordered to be committed but also for his falsiﬁed account of them aer . e book’s ﬁnal chapters (Chapters –) detail Schirach’s post-war path, focusing particularly on the struggles of his family and friends—his former wife, his children and grandchildren, and his former colleagues—to come to terms with the jurisdictional, ﬁnancial, and, most importantly, moral fallout of his..."
