He joined the Nazi Party in 1925 and became president of the Nazi student league in 1928, serving until 1932. He became the national youth leader of the Nazis, serving from 1931 to 1940, and of Germany in 1933. In this capacity he built up the Hitler Youth into a national mass organization. From 1940 to 1945 he was the Nazi gauleiter of Vienna. At the Nuremberg Trials, he was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. He was released in 1966, and he died in Kroev, Rhineland-Palatinate, West Germany in 1974."
