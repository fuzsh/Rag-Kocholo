        "text": "“Any nation that draws too great a distinction between its scholars and its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools.” - Thucydides\n\nAmerican Metaphor\n\nSeptember 1930\n\nHenry Ford's image transfixed Europeans, especially the Germans, arousing the \"fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all\".[92] Germans who discussed \"Fordism\" often believed that it represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production .\n\nThe Case of Henry Ford,and Baldur von Shirach\n\nHenry Ford had an extraordinary influence on Baldur von Shirach.\n\nWikipedia: Baldur Benedikt von Schirach (9 May 1907 – 8 August 1974) was a NaziGerman politician who is best known for his role as the Nazi Party national youth leader and head of the Hitler Youth from 1931 to 1940. He later served as Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter (\"Reich Governor\") of Vienna. After World War II, he was convicted of crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trials and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nSchirach (far left) watches as Hitler greets his Chancellery chief Philipp Bouhler in Munich 1938.\n\nSchirach (right) with Hitler, Bormannand Göring at the Obersalzberg\n\nSchirach was born in Berlin, the youngest of four children of theatre director, grand ducal chamberlain and retired captain of the cavalry Carl Baily Norris von Schirach (1873–1948) and his American wife Emma Middleton Lynah Tillou (1872–1944). A member of the noble Schirach family, of Sorbian West Slavic origins, three of his four grandparents were from the United States, chiefly from Pennsylvania.[1] Through his mother, Schirach was a descendant of Thomas Heyward Jr., a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nEnglish was the first language he learned at home and he did not learn to speak German until the age of five. He had two sisters, Viktoria and the opera singer Rosalind von Schirach, and a brother, Karl Benedict von Schirach. His brother committed suicide in 1919 at the age of 19. He was confirmed at church at age 14 although grew away from the church in favor of the Nazi youth movement.[2]\n\nOn 31 March 1932 Schirach married the 19-year-old Henriette Hoffmann, the daughter of Heinrich Hoffmann, Adolf Hitler's personal photographer and sometime friend. Schirach's family was vehemently opposed to this marriage, but Hitler insisted.[3] Gregor Strasser dismissively described Schirach as \"a young effeminate aristocrat\" upon whom Hitler bestowed both Henriette and the Hitler Youth position. Through this relationship, Schirach became part of Hitler's inner circle. The young couple were welcome guests at Hitler's Berghof.\n\nPart 5 of On the Road to America; The Case of Joachim Peiper"
