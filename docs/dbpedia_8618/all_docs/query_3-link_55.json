        "text": "Baldur von Schirach was an antisemite, early Nazi Party member, the head of the Hitler Youth, and the Nazi Party’s “Gau Leader” (German: “Gauleiter”) of Vienna. He was also a member of the Nazi Party’s SA. Schirach joined the Nazi Party in 1925. He gave members of the Hitler Youth opportunities to fulfill Christian religious duties, attend Sunday services, and receive religious education. As “Gau Leader” of Vienna starting in August 1940, Schirach was responsible for the deportation of Jews to concentration camps. He received a sentence at the Nuremberg trials and served twenty years.\n\nQuotes\n\n“… I solemnly declare here, before the German public, that I stand on the basis of Christianity …”, Baldur von Schirach, December 1933.\n\n“… I even am of the opinion that religious meetings and arrangements in particular religious youth leagues are not at all in contradiction to the totalitarian claim of the Hitler Youth. Every effort which aims to deepen and intensify religious life must not only be welcomed by a responsible youth leadership but also be furthered. I believe that through the agreement with the Reich Bishop of the Protestant Church, that the Hitler Youth has indicated that it is ready to grant the necessary space for religious education. …”, Baldur von Schirach, “The Hitler Youth”, Chapter 3, 1934.\n\n“He who serves our Führer, Adolf Hitler, serves Germany, and he who serves Germany, serves God.”, Baldur von Schirach, July 25, 1936.\n\n“… Jewry attempted with all available means to spoil the healthy youth… every Jew at large in Europe is a danger to European culture. If one wished to confront me with the accusation that I have deported tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of Jews to the eastern ghetto from this city that was once the metropolis of Jewry, I must answer that I consider it an active contribution to European culture. …”, Baldur von Schirach, 1942.\n\n“If he descended from heaven today, the great warrior who beat the money-traders, you would shout your “crucifige!” and nail him to the cross which he himself bore. But he mildly smiles upon your hate: “The truth will prevail, even if the bearer falls; the faith will live, for I give my life… and stand tall at the cross for all warriors of the world.”, poem by Baldur von Schirach in The Flag of the Persecuted (Die Fahne der Verfolgten), Christ, page 51.\n\n“Führer, my Führer given me by God. Protect and preserve my life for long. You rescued Germany from its deepest need. I thank you for my daily bread. Stay for a long time with me, leave me not. Führer, my Führer, my faith, my light. Hail my Führer.”, a prayer by Baldur von Schirach and used during meals in schools during Nazi Germany and by Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth).\n\n“In the presence of this blood banner which represents our Führer, I swear to devote all my energies and my strength to the savior of our country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready to give up my life for him, so help me God.”, Hitler Youth oath by Baldur von Schirach.\n\n“We all believe in an almighty God. We are all, even the youngest among us, witnesses to the wonderful transformation that the Volk has experienced through His help, the transformation from impotence and destruction to strength and harmony. The Hitler Youth wants nothing less than to secure this strength and harmony for all time.”, Baldur von Schirach."
