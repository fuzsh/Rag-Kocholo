        "text": "His quote : \"Its Not for us to reason why,,,but it is for us to obey and do\"...was the most widely used phrase during the trials. Quite scary..following orders and knowing about it. Von Schirach was a cool cat throughout most of the interview..except towards the end..as he was fidgeting and had an uncomfortable look on his face. David Frost accomplished what he set out to do..through the questions that were asked.\n\nHJ Leader Arthur Axmann post war interview was less favorable of Schirachs persona.\n\nWe see photos of these personalities in uniforms..and hear speeches by them..with translated sub titles....the masses that surround them...and what they have done during the time..is atrocious!!....BUT it is not all that available the opportunity to actually hear a one on one chat with one of these type minds...compared to TV related series and some documentaries.\n\nMost of what we hear is only about 5 minutes of interviews..that pan away from the person ..and go to film footage. To me..there is no effect in horror in that time frame. Listening to this Guy in a straight on interview really opens up..ones mind of the type of mindset these people were. Von Schirach was still convinced of his duties...his calm demeanor is obvious.\n\nI knew Charles Manson was a nutbag sicko..and never thought more of it..when David Frost also interviewed him during the 1980s. My impression of that was Manson was on a life long acid trip..and was quite frightful...saying \"Some\" things that seemed to make sense was the scary part..as was with Von Schirach....none of which were fit for modern day society and human life.\n\nIt would be encouraging that more of these 1 on 1 interviews come to surface..and be posted. We have seen the horror in photos and text...hearing the minds of those top Nazis who participated brings the uniform into a scary reality.\n\nRegards Larry"
