        "text": "Biography[]\n\nBorn in 1907 in Prussia, Germany, to a German father and an Anglo-American mother, Baldur von Schirach joined the NSDAP in 1925, becoming head of the Hitler Jugend in 1933. Personally attractive and popular, regarded as both a moderate and something of an idealist, and a sincere believer in the values of the NSDAP. After a long period as Education Minister in the Government of National Concentration, von Schirach became Chancellor in 1962 amid a brief political struggle with Arthur Seyss-Inquart, replacing Alfred Rosenberg. He was the nominee of the new Reichsprasident, Erwin Rommel, and of the Reichsfuehrer-SS, Arthur Nebe. He was in turn replaced by Albert Speer in 1973."
