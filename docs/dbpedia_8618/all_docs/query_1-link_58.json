The book which details Italy's state under Mussolini is double signed by Baldur Von Schirach, once in full, and then a more intimate ink hand written dedication, \"Whilst Others Wither we shall become a state, Baldur, Christmas 1929.\"\n\nThe book with black linen covers and gold blocked title and Italian Fasces motif. 208 pages with some black & white photographs. Baldur Von Schirach signature in full to the inside front. Then further ink dedication. The book bearing ink stamps of the Library Of Congress collection.\n\nCondition report:Overall very good towards excellent condition. Spine good. Pages clean.\n\nRarity status (Up to 10 rarest):10/10. Particularly rare to find Von Schirach's signature from the \"Kampszeit\" era.\n\nProvenance: Obtained by G2 (US Intelligence W.W.II) during information gathering towards the end of the war. Their book collection was given over to the Library Of Congress during the 1960s. Many of the books came from the personal libraries of Hitler, Goring, and Himmler. This book may have come from one of those libraries. During the 1980s, the Library Of Congress took the decision to clear down on duplicate copies, and this book was sold off under their 'Surplus Duplicates' scheme.\n\nBackground to Baldur Von Schirach:Baldur Benedikt von Schirach (born 9th May 1907 â€“ died 8th August 1974) was best known for his role as the German Nazi Party's Hitler Youth Leader and head of the Hitler Youth from 1931 to 1940. He later served as Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter (\"Reich Governor\") of Vienna, and also held the rank of Reichsleiter. After World War II, he was convicted of crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison."
