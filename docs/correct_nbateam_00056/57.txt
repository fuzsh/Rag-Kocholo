The Portland Trail Blazers have reached agreement on a two-year, $4 million contract with Steve Blake, league sources told Yahoo Sports.

Blake, 34, agreed to take the Blazers' biannual exception, sources said.

This will be Blake's third stay with the Blazers. He spent the 2005-06 season in Portland and played another 2Â½ seasons with the Trail Blazers from 2007-10. The Los Angeles Lakers traded Blake to the Golden State Warriors at the February deadline, where he became a free agent this summer.

Blake has averaged 6.9 points and four assists in his 11 NBA seasons.
