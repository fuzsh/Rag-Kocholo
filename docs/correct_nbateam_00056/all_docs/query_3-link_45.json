        "text": "Author & Historian\n\nSteve Blake is one of the original members of the P‑38 National Association and was an attendee at the 1987 P‑38 National Convention, where the Association was officially born.\n\nSteve has been from the beginning and remains the Association’s historian, and one of its most valued members.\n\nAs a student while growing up in Anaheim, California, Steve was fascinated with World War II fighters and their pilots and devoured the popular “ace” memoirs of the 1950s such as Thunderbolt, Samurai and Wing Leader. He was also an avid modeler.\n\nAround 1980 he decided to put to use all the research he was doing on WWII fighter pilots and turn it into a real avocation. He did so initially by publishing and editing a magazine called Fighter Pilots in Aerial Combat from 1981 to 1984.\n\nSteve began his writing career in earnest when he and his friend and fellow WWII aviation (and P-38 Association) historian John Stanaway worked together on Adorimini (“up and at ’em!”) A History of the 82nd Fighter Group in World War II.\n\nHis subsequent books include: P-38 Lightning Aces of the 82nd Fighter Group, P-38 LIGHTNING—Unforgettable Missions of Skill and Luck, and Lightning Strikes! The Lockheed P-38.\n\nSteve retired after 35 years with the USPS, and he and his wife, Marjorie, moved from Southern California to Prescott, Arizona, where they enjoy hiking and exploring their home state. Steve keeps busy with his various P‑38 Association projects, including being co-editor of their membership publication, Lightning Strikes (see below). Marjorie has also become a valued member of our Association team, and has for many years been Lightning Strikes‘ design and layout artist.\n\nSteve and Marjorie plan to continue their work on behalf of the P‑38 National Association for many years to come."
