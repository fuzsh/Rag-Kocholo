Freeland joined the Oral Roberts staff from Charleston Southern University, where he served in a number of capacities in the sports information office over the span of seven years, most recently being named the Assistant A.D. for Media.\n\nDuring his career, Freeland has aided in the publicity of a national champion, numerous AP All-American selections including 2012 ORU men's basketball selection, Dominique Morrison. He has covered the ORU baseball and women's basketball teams at the NCAA Tournament, the ORU men's basketball team at a pair of postseason tournaments, and the CSU football team as they took on the defending national champion Florida Gators.\n\nUnder his direction, the ORU Media Relations department has won a pair of CoSIDA \"Best in the Nation\" awards, including the 2013-14 women's basketball media guide and the 2016-17 men's basketball #NextDayNumbers infographics.\n\nImmediately after moving to ORU, Freeland went to work improving all facets of the Media Relations operations. In his first two years, he increased the size and content of the five existing media guides, including men's and women's basketball and baseball, and has added other publications as well.\n\nAdditionally, Freeland has overseen an increase in the number of live events streamed through the ORU Sports Network, upgrading the quality as well with the use play-by-play for baseball broadcasts.\n\nAt CSU, Freeland was the main contact for the football, cross country, and track & field programs, while overseeing the coverage of all 16 Division I teams. In seven years, Freeland had the chance to serve as the main contact for every sport. He hosted the Big South Women's Soccer Championship three times, the Big South Track and Field Championship, and also helped out at the Southern Conference Basketball tournament.\n\nUnder his direction, the Buccaneers had two AP All-American selections in football, as well as a Draddy Trophy Semifinalist and two finalists for the ADA postgraduate scholarship. Freeland also directed the publication efforts for two Atlanta Area Boy Scout Peach of an Athlete selections, a Lowe's Senior CLASS finalist in baseball and a Johnny Bench Watch List selection. He oversaw a redesign of the athletics Web site and has started a number of new media projects for the department, including a Facebook fan page, Twitter and YouTube sites. He started and maintained the athletic department's blog as well.\n\nAs the head of the video streaming operations, Freeland oversaw the expansion to include seven sports, and was key in adding graphics and a Daktronics score bug. Under his direction, Charleston Southern led the Big South in total sales, total subscribers and most live events broadcasted during the 2008-09 winter season. They also finished second in total peak views to Liberty.\n\nPrior to CSU, Freeland spent two years in the media relations office at his alma mater, Oklahoma State, where he worked for Steve Buzzard. He was a contact for tennis and cross country, and helped out with football, basketball and baseball, among others.\n\nFreeland has had the opportunity to work the NCAA Men's Basketball tournament in both Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and worked a number of conference championship events.\n\nMarried July 2007 to the former Katie Davis, he is a member of CoSIDA, serving on the publications committee, and served as the chairman of the Big South Football SIDs in 2008-09 and 2009-2010. The couple has a son, Beckett, born April 2011 and a daughter, Jensen Kate, born June 2015."
