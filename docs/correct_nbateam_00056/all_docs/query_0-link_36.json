        "text": "Blake has maintained a home in West Linn, so signing with the Blazers to back up Damian Lillard was very much a homecoming.\n\n“There’s no better place to play basketball,” Blake said. “I love it here. Like I said, I have a house here, I had my kids here, or my wife had my kids here. So it’s a great place to be, great city, great fan base. I love the way coach has the team playing, and I think it’s a good fit.”\n\nIn a way, Blake, 34, presents a sort of living history of the Blazers’ recent past. Neil Olshey, who signed Blake, is the third Blazers general manager he has played under, joining John Nash and Kevin Pritchard, who were running the team during Blake’s first two stints."
