        "text": "It will be two steps forward and one step back for the Los Angeles Lakers’ beleaguered bench on Friday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Forwards Josh McRoberts and Troy Murphy will be back in the lineup at the same time Steve Blake is being placed on the inactive list with a costochondral fracture, which is a fracture of the cartilage connecting the rib to the sternum. “That thing is at a point to where even if he makes a hard move, it can hurt him or bother him,” Lakers coach Mike Brown said of Blake’s condition.\n\nThe triangle offense did plenty for the Lakers, helping them win five championships under Phil Jackson. It featured a two-guard front instead of the more traditional point guard and shooting guard delineation, which meant Blake didn’t necessarily bring the ball up court. He likes Brown’s offense, which is more akin to typical pro sets. “I get to push the ball more and feel the ball in my hands,” he said. “In your whole life, you’re bringing the ball up and then you don’t [last season] … it’s nice to get back to that same feeling.”\n\nOr from his past five years attending the league’s board of governors meetings in both spring and fall, entering stride for stride with Jerry and Jeanie to convene with all other NBA owners. Or from him sitting in with Jerry, Jim and Mitch Kupchak last summer as the free-agent names Steve Blake and Matt Barnes were kicked around. Or from him huddling with Jim on draft night in June, studying Synergy Sports Technology scouting video before the Lakers’ picks were made. “The long term is my dad wants to transfer the shares out to his children,” Joey said. “It’ll become a process in which all of us will have ownership of the team. I just think there’ll be a natural progression, and I should be ready when that happens and not try to push anything earlier than that. Using this as an opportunity to grow is great for me. “My dad will bounce things off of me. Business and basketball. I get somebody’s ear basically all the time, so there’s always influence that way. At the end of the day, the top-level Lakers decisions are not mine to make, but I definitely do have a voice.”\n\nBrown said that the players’ association was vigilant in sending out a steady stream of emails to its constituents as developments in negotiations occurred. He said he knew of player reps trying to reach out to their teammates only to find the phone number they were provided with had been changed or disconnected. “It wasn’t like things were done behind anybody’s back,” Brown said. “Everybody knew and know what’s going on at all times because the letters that were sent out.”\n\nBlake disagreed with Brown’s assessment of his stance on the last deal offered by the owners and issued a statement to ESPNLosAngeles.com on Tuesday evening. “It has been my goal, throughout my career and even more so during the lockout to be a responsible and active member of our Players Association,” Blake wrote. “With that said, many of the reports published have been inaccurate. I have actively had conversations with my teammates, Player Representatives and the Executive Committee over the past weeks and months about the status of the negotiations and proposals. My stance is simply to make sure we weigh all proposals. I have not made a decision on whether or not a proposal was right to take, just simply encouraging all of our players and representatives to review everything carefully and then make the appropriate choices as a collective body.”"
