In the years after college, Will worked in a number of leadership roles. Heâs served as an Executive Director, a Senior Executive Director, an Operations Specialist, and most recently as an RVPO and then VP of Operations with Dominion Senior Living.\n\nWill holds a BS in Health Science and an MBA in Healthcare Administration from Southern Adventist University.
