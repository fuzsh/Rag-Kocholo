        "text": "Another free agent has just left the market. Free agent Steve Blake has reached an agreement on a contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, as first reported by Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski. The deal is for two years and $4.2 million, using the team's bi-annual exception, and Blake will have a player option on the second year, a source told CBSSports.com's Ken Berger.\n\nBlake is a solid role player and probably the best backup point guard left on the market, so this is a great deal for the Blazers. CBSSports.com's Matt Moore ranked him the seventh-best free agent at his position:\n\nA quality shooter who has been a part of good teams consistently. Blake's a quality teammate and can hit decently-to-great from three depending on system (see his drop from 39.7 percent with the Lakers last year to 34 percent from three with Golden State).\n\nInjuries have been a plague, and he plays smaller than his 6-3 height. He's also 34 years of age. But he's more consistent than most of the players on the rest of this list, so here he sits, still capable of doing the work he needs to do. He's a poor man's Derek Fisher, and while that sounds like an insult, those guys usually tend to help teams win.\n\nThis will be the third time Blake has signed with Portland as a free agent. He played there in 2005-2006, and again from 2007 until he was dealt at the 2010 trade deadline.\n\nBlake split last season between the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors, and averaged 6.9 points and 5.6 assists in 27.2 minutes per game. He'll slide nicely into the role occupied by Mo Williams last year, and should be a good mentor for young combo guard C.J. McCollum."
