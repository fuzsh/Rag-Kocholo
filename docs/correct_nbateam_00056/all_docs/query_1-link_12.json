This issue is especially dedicated to all new students. We hope you enjoy your stay at AC. THE ALABAMIAN is a student publication. We urge you to read it because it is your paper; it belongs not to the faculty, not to the ad- ministration, but to the students of Alabama College. This paper is your voice. Use it by writing letters to the editor, join- ing the staff, or by giving the editors your opinions and comments about what you have read in it. Editorial views expressed in the two editorial columns and in the edi- torials themselves are to be taken as such; they are opinions and inter- pretations of events that concern this college. We do NOT ask that you agree with our views; we do ask that you read and criticize objectively what we say. In closing, we wish to re-emphasize that your comments and criti- cisms are always welcome.

You will be permitted much more freedom at Alabama College than that to which you have been accustomed in the past. Freedoms are special privileges, and they are won only by establishing con- comitant responsibilities. The con- tinuance of your newly won in- dependence will depend on your proper assumption of your mature responsibilities. We are intensely proud of Ala- bama College. The institution has a noble heritage and an outstand- ing record. It is our duty to main- tain these fine educational tradi- tions. We shall anticipate your complete cooperation in the main- tenance of superlative standards, high moral and social codes of When you entered Alabama Col- lege, you availed yourself of the greatest opportunity obtainable for the youth of the world— the op- portunity to acquire a college ed- ucation. In this great nation of ours, in America, one can acquire a college education at less cost and much more democratically than in any other nation. It is important initially for you to be fully cognizant of the many opportunities and challenges avail- able to you at college. You should apply yourself diligently to all of your assignments in order to reap the greatest benefits. Moreover, you should become an integral part of the total educational pro- gram, including the extracurricu- lar as well as the curricular as- pects, if you should be successful. Your college experiences should make you a more mature and re- \" fined person, as well as a better educated person. You will be given an opportunity to acquire much SHRAPNEL By Jerry Gray Because the editor has told us that this issue of the ALABAMIAN is intended largely for the incoming freshmen, and because the policy t>f this column often strays from the dictates of the editor, you will find that this bit is not fondly dedicated to the \"firsties.\" May we then say a simple \"hello,\" and go on from there. But, if there remains some among you who prefer more typical \"first issue\" com- /4H% ments than those found in this space, may we suggest p you look elsewhere on this page. Something called \"* w APROPOS (what???) is new and may be found to be rather interesting, if you like triteness. Said column is ^^idi^^ handled by a former sports writer with gargantuan as- j^V I pirations for becoming \"legitimate.\" The writer of that ■ MM I piece has been around triteness all his life, and has H KM I doubtlessly acquired a great familiarity with it. (He ^™ really is a nice young boy. kind of sad . . . but nice). Shall we proceed .... A question was posed last year, in reference to this column; \"Don't you like anything?\" Why yes, we dearly love complaints. Do you have any? We like two or three other things too, but why write about them? Just a thought in passing ... If anyone wishes to aid and abet the ALABAMIAN \"working\" staff . . . come on up. They always need help. (They're really a miserable group. We try to stay as far away from them as possible.)

Welcome aboard! Dr. Howard M. Phillips, President, Alabama College * * * To Our Freshmen: Mary was in the third grade, Jane in the second. They came bouncing home from school one day with report cards. Mary was elated because her teacher said she was improving. Jane, always trying to keep up and not to be outdone replied, \"Oh, I'm improv- ing too. I've finished improving.\" Strange how one remembers lit- tle things. I guess it is because so many people have finished im- proving. We hope this is the beginning of a stimulating and exciting year- one that will measure up to the highest hopes you have had for college. May your friendships and asso- ciations be broadened and enrich- ed. May your mind and imagina- tion reach new and absorbing heights, and your presence at Ala- bama College add new lustre and prestige to your chosen Alma Ma- ter. And remember never finish im- proving! Best wishes and welcome. Adelaide Paty Dean of Women // A FIFTH by Mike Mizzel War, Death, Disease, Famine, and Freshmen. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have recruited a \"fifth\"? This new member sweeps down on college campuses throughout the world each year to leave in its wake enough ulcers, jangled nerves, mental disorder, etc. to put the other four of the \"quintet\" to shame. Of the original Four Horsemen, only Death can equal this new scourge. Disease, Famine, and War can all be prevented or avoid- ed; but only Death and Freshmen come inevitably and unchangingly. Surely the grand-master of human suffering himself, the Marquis de Sade, would be nauseated by such a disgusting \"thing\" as this para- site of human minds and morals. UPPERCLASSMEN, UNITE! Let us put forth every effort to reduce the destructive of this hor- ror to a minimum. No method of defense has ever been devised against Freshmen, but perhaps it will help if we get to know the enemy a little better. Freshmen are masters of deceit. They like to disguise themselves as innocent children and will ap- pear to be completely helpless. DON'T BE FOOLED! Woe be unto the hapless upperclassmen who al- lows a freshmen to win his confid- ence. He will awake one morning to find his grades dropped and his morals corrupted. In order to make the enemy easily recognizable we require them to wear a distinctive green hat. A few of them may try to fool you by not wearing their hat. These are not to be worried about. They are freaks and will probably die. Besides, they still have that stupid look on their faces. Surely, with a united effort we can survive. Perhaps we can adopt the ancient Chinese philosophy. In- stead of fighting them, let's ab- sorb them. May we be more suc- cessful this year than we were last year. On* or il* more cUss.

Finishing Touches Being Added To New Maintenance Building Operations and Maintenance members at Alabama College will be working in new quarters this year. Finishing touches are now being added to the new two- story bidding which is located on the northwest border of the cam- pus. Containing 13,360 square feet of floor space, the structure will house the paint, plumbing, electri- cal and carpenter shops. Aubrey C. Folsom, planning en- gineer and operations director at the college, noted that a large area of the ground floor is being as- signed for storage of maintenance equipment and supplies. In addi- tion, the building also houses the threatre scenery construction shop and the college's fire department, as well as operations and main- tenance offices. Renovation and remodeling of the bulding formerly housing the carpenter, plumbing and electrical shops is under way, converting it into ..classrooms ..and ..laboratory space for the college's mathema- tics-physics department. The paint shop building will be remodeled to house the biology de- partment's newly established geo- logy section. C. W. Williams Construction Company of Marion constructed the building.

It also wants swimmers, basket- ball players and track and field athletes. In all, the Peace Corps is seek- ing about 50 athletes, both men and women who have participated in college sports, for projects in Morocco, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. The athletes, who need not be college graduates, have been in- vited by newly independent Afri- can nations to coach and assist in the training of regional and na- tional teams. The African governments are keenly interested in sponsoring and fostering the tremendous in- terest in sports in their countries. Government officials look upon this interest as a way of using the common bond of widespread sports interest to unify peoples accus- tomed to living in decentralized and tribal nations and to identify thm strongly as participants in the single endeavor of building na- tions. Additonally, they feel that sports can be one of the most ef- fective ways of working with the nations' youth. Training for those selected will begin about mid-October in an American university. Applicants should therefore submit applica- tions immediately and notify their references to repond to questions as soon as they are contacted. The Peace Corps is drawing on the experience and knowledge of leadng sports organizations and as- sociations in devising and admin- istering the training program.

Griffith, professor of history at Alabama College. Published by the Colonial Press of Northport, Miss Griffith has pieced together events of an era spanning some 360 years from 1540 to 1900. The book has been compil- ed from \"diaries, letters and pa- pers of the times.\" \"This book,\" Miss Griffith stat- ed, \"grew out of frustration!\" In teaching Alabama history, which she has been doing at Alabama College since 1954, she \"felt ham- pered by the dearth of accessible teaching materials.\" She said that, aside from The Alabama Histori- cal Quarterly and The Alabama Review, \"sources of collections for the state are both very meagre and widely scattered.\" Miss Griffith based her latest book on the theory that \"the most interesting history is that told by contemporary participants or ob- servers.\" She added that \"few secondary accounts give the read- er quite the same feeling of being a participant, or at least a close bystander, as accounts written in the heat of battle by the people who were there.\" Information has been drawn from manuscripts in several col- lege and university libraries and in the Department of Archives and History at Montgomery. Miss Grif- fith in her forward passages, ac- knowledges help from her students and others \"in allowing me to use family papers or unpublished material.\" Material has been assorted into chronological periods and topical classifications. She noted that, al- though the decision is \"open to question,\" she chose arbitrarily to end the book at about the year 1900, because that \"seemed a rea- sonable terminal date.\" The work was originally intend- ed for college students . . . and (I) \"had my own in mind as I pre- pared it\" . . . but the nature of letters, diaries and other personal accounts \"make it useful for high school students as well.\" Miss Griffith is a native of Bess- .ville, Mo., and is a graduate of Belhaven College at Jackson, Miss. She received her Master of Arts degree from Tulane Univer- sity, and her Ph.D degree from Brown University at Providence, ILL Before joining the faculty at AC, she taught high school in Missis- sippi and was chairman of the his- tory department at East Mississip- pi Junior College. Active in a number of profes- sional honor societies, she is also a member of the American His- torical Association and the Vir- ginia Historical Society. Miss Griffith is president of the state division, American Associa- tion of University Women and is a member of the AAUW National Committee on Higher Education. She served on the editorial board of the Alabama Review from 1958- 62. She has traveled extensively throughout North America and was director of last summer's Ala- bama College European Seminar, during which she accompanied a group of AC students throughout most of western Europe.

Dr. Connell received his B.S. de- ree from L.S.U., his Masters and )octorate degrees in geology from he University of Oklahoma. Dr. onnell has taught at die Univer- sity of Oklahoma, Louisiana Poly- echnic Institute, University of Southern Mississippi and New York State University. Dr. Connell comes from southern Maryland, but has lived in the South half of his life. The Connell family consists of Dr. Connell, Mrs. Connell, and his four-year-old, red- headed son who already shows ten- dencies of following in his father's footsteps. 'Bones' Enjoys Trains Dr. Connell, known as \"Flint- stone\" (attributed to Coach Ander- son and some workmen) and \"Bones,\" has a subtle sense of hu- mor in addition to a warm, con- genial manner. Although he is greatly dedicated to his teaching, he is also fascinated with his model railroad (seventeen locomotives, eighty cars, a few miles of track), and music. He plays the oboe and enjoys light opera, musical come- dies and the \"Watusi.\" Dr. Connell said that his biggest classroom problem was adult stu- dents who persisted in arguing reli- gion versus geology. Once known as* \"el carniciers,\" or \"the but- cher,\" because of his strict grad- ing system, Dr. Connell said the alias would be needed no longer as students here seem to be more in- dustrious and down to earth or rocks! Asked what was his advise to all A.C. students, Dr. Connell replied, \"It's later than you think— start studying ...\" Honor Is Stressed During Past Week Students, faculty, and staff mem- bers of Alabama College observed Honor Code Emphasis Week at the state liberal arts college Oct. 1-5. During the week-long program, which was directed by the Student Court, special events were sche- duled to familiarize new students with the honor system, a tradition of long standing at AC. Chief Justice Douglas Rodgers, Montgomery, called Honor Code Emphasis Week a period \"during which students should seriously consider the importance of honor, both as individuals and as a group.\" He said activities are designed to direct students' thinking toward honor and integrity \"with its broad implications of conscientious and courageous living in academic, so- cial and private life.\" Mrs. Charlotte Blackmon, Eng- lish instructor at AC, was the prin- cipal speaker at special Convoca- tion ceremonies in Palmer Audi- torium Tuesday morning, Oct. 2. Rodgers said Mrs. Blackmon, a recent graduate with highest honors from AC, had been invited by the Student Court as special guest speaker due to her \"recent transition from student to faculty member.\" \"She addressed the student body from her perspective as a former student and as a member of the teaching profession,\" he stated. Court members conducted a panel discussion Tuesday evening, primarily for freshmen and trans- fer students. The discusssion per- iod was followed by a question- answer period. Chief Justice Rod- gers said the evening program had been arranged \"to clarify Student Government regulations and the functioning of the honor system.\" Members of the Student Court in addition to Rodgers are: Associate Chief Justice, H^rma forger, Sal- ma; .Court Clerk, John Bullock, Mobile; and Justices, Anthony Bel- lia, Buffalo, N.Y.; Charlotte Gale, Alexander City; James Hurt, Prichard; Judith Ann Williams, Ft. Rucker; and Sidney Benton, Eu- faula. Speech Majors Hold Meeting By John Batson The speech department held a reception for all its majors in Rey- nolds lounge September 24. The purpose was to acquaint the stu- dents with the new speech teachers and renew acquaintance with the teachers of previous semesters. The various fields of the speech department were represented by students in their respective depart- ments. The Women's Speech Honorary Fraternity, Zeta Phi Eta, was represented by Rebecca Cane. Elaine Kilgore spoke on the de- bate division of A.C. speech de- partment. National Collegiate Play- ers was represented by President Betty Kirk. The speech correction phase was handled by Waldo Hornsby. Steve Charlton commented on the technical phase of the theater while Larry Robinson spoke on the college radio station, WRSD. Each representative spoke for several minutes on his particular Interest in as effort to acquaint all speech majors with the many as- pects of the Alabama College speech department. Afterwards pie and coffee were served to all pre- sent and a get acquainted period followed. President Howard M. Philips an- nounced his resignation as Presi- dent of Alabama College this after- noon at a special faculty meeting. Dr. Phillips, who has been select- ed to assume the Presidency at Birmingham-Southern, stated in an interview with the Alabamian just minutes before this meeting that he was leaving A.C. \"with mixed emotions.\" The noted educator said that he was regretful at leaving so fine an institution as Alabama College, but the challenge presented to him by the Board of Trustees of Birm- ingham-Southern was too great to turn down. Dr. Phillips will continue as head of Alabama College until the end of the academic year.

Skk American Tells Why The following letter was sent by a resident of San Francisco to Paul A. Terry, director of education of the Copley newspapers: \"I am one of the Americans who heard Mr. Khrushchev tell our Na- tion that my great-grandchildren will grow up in a Communist world. \"For some time now this has bothered me. \"I am not a brave man — not even a big one. \"I suppose I would have to ad- mit that I am, among my own neighbors and in my own culture, the typical, average, well-educated genteel suburbanite to whom fami- ly, the mortgage, and security have been the all-important items. \"I am now 50, and soon my wife and I will see the first of our three children married. \"I paint my own house, repair my own car, grub my own devil grass, and nurse a modest savings account at the Bank of America. I am a law-abiding man on the quiet side and dissension makes me terribly nervous. Frankly, I am the kind who simply doesn't have it in him to fight anyone ever. \"My wife had me cleaning out an old trunk in the storage room the other day, and I ran across the huge old family Bible that I hadn't thought about for years. My great-grandmother had kept a jour- nal of the trip across the Great Plains with a wagon and oxen wl)en she and great-grandpa were youngsters coming out to settle in California in the great migration. Great-grandma wrote about it as the wild, new land, rich and abund- ant in mythical proportions. \"On the trail she wrote of sick- ness and hunger, and heat and cold, and dust and thirst, and the deaths and births like beads strung together on a thread of hope of freedom and a land of plenty for their children yet unborn. \"And when she viewed the new land she wrote in simple word pic- tures of the cities and farms and schools, and happiness that would someday bloom in the greatness of the vast new land. She wrote of her tomorrow and my today. \"The ink was badly faded, but the message was clear. \"As I read, I began to think about America and being an American and what it all stands for; and I thought about our ene- mies and what they intend to do to America, to those rich lands and farms, to the cities and the people, to its freedom and its hope. \"And, suddenly, I realized that I am a sick American. I mean really sick. \"I am sick of reactions where there should be initiative. \"I am sick of bureaucrats who tell me that my enemy is not really my enemy, and that I should live together with murderers and ty- rants. \"I am sick of government that hasn't the guts to clean traitors out of its own offices. \"I am sick of my country being ridiculed all over the world. \"I am sick of pink-livered politi- cians who place personal career above the fate of the flag. \"I am sick of 40 years of relent- less, creeping, cancerous, commu- nistic godlessness that never once ■has wavered from its avowed pur- pose of conquering that flag and seeing it trampled in the mud un- der Russian boots. \"I am sick of my genteel desire to stand pat and pray while the enemy advances. \"I am sick of educators who teach tolerance of subversion and of clergymen who would have me quail at the specter of battle and turn my cheek in fear of what our enemies might do. \"Jen all honesty, the thing o£ which I am most sick is the man who let these things come to me: myself. \"And by the living God who made me, sir, I am a sick Ameri- can who intends to get well.\" gort There are those, Sort, who say that I was the First Man. I know, Adam. Oh?... Where did you get that opinion, Gort? Where did you get that navel, Adam?... Expression Of Sympathy The ALABAMIAN would like to express sympathy to the family of Dr. Ethel Marshall in their breavement. Dr. Marshall did much for the school and for the student publications. Her presence is greatly missed by all. SHRAPNEL By Jerry Gray For those freshmen among you who have not yet graduated from the \"Dick and Sally\" primer stage, the title of this bit may be \"Shrapnel,\" . . . but only if you read it correctly. It is written by someone, (rather odd, don't you think?) and also written by hand. . . arbitrarily speaking of course. If you are still reading, and detect no signs of hem- morages or loose liver or any other common malady (recognized by 9 out of 10 New York doctors who smoke Viceroy, and find crazy, wild, strange, little green things in their wash day product, where Mary Jane and Snif- fles and Manners the butler play strip poker with the four little rabbits, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Fred Cooper every fort-night.) then see your psychiatrist im- £| I mediately because this little opus is sick. Since we are supposed to be educated (see there, didn't your teacher tell you, just yesterday, that Batman was homosex- ual?) and because this is a sort of introductory column, why don't we approach it in that manner? i.e English 241-242.

For example there has been the addition of a tray disposal and also new plates are now being used. But there have been other changes. The students now cope with de- manding regulations. (Demanding, that is, by the management). Stu- dents cannot forget their meal tickets. This regulation is strictly enforc- ed. It seems that the ticket holes must be punched lest the cashiers have nothing to do. Men must wear shirts in their trousers. Much to do (about nothing) has been said to this effect. It seems that the cafeteria management has taken the students' dress regulations upon themselves. (Is this the answer to the question we asked last year: \"Who or What is the Commit- tee on Better Dress?\") Another rule which has injured the pride of many true Southern gentlemen is the one that does not permit a student to fill two glasses of tea at one time. Think of the embarassment our young gentlemen suf- fer when they return to their ladies with only one glass of tea. Alas, Southern traditions must go with the changing times! We all have noticed the increased efficiency due to this time saving rule. Or perhaps the price of tea has risen, and the money saved is being used to purchase more jello. Forgetfulness is something we are all guilty of at one time or the other. But after standing in line, we do not feel too enthused when asked to procure \"a meal ticket or money\" or go get the meal ticket, especial- ly if we have to attend a class in a few minutes. We feel that the man- agement should be more understanding about the student's plight. Regarding the dress regulation, is not S.G.A. supposed to be the regulating factor on student attire? AH though it is difficult for us to do so, we try to understand why only one glass of tea can be refilled. However, we cannot understand the sharp words given us when we unwittingly forget and bring back two glasses. We hold these truths to be self evident; and in as much that the cafeteria is of students (tuition), by the students (student workers), and for the students (we have to eat there), it should be managed as such.

Thaxton Springfield, native of Sul- ligent and graduate of Emory Uni- versity and Chandler School of Theology, will speak during the week of October 23 at three convo- cations. Theme for the first convocation is \"Man in Outer Space.\" Subject is how we get where we are psy- chologically, scientifically and reli- giously. On Wednesday Mr. Spring- field will make an examination of the effects of external condition of modern man and to describe what this man is as he sees him- self and others. Title of his speech will be \"Man Trandscending,\" the meaning of obsolete absolutes, relative abso- lutes, unrelative absolutes, and ab- solute absolutes. During this, he shall point out \"what difference it does make.\" Discussion groups will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 7: 30 in Tutwiler Parlor. In recent years, much violence has been done In print, and in tele- vision and movie scripts to the image of the Jazz musician. True, the eccentric activities that some of them carry on along with their weird ..thoughts ..and .ideas ..have helped this along. But, today, a new species of jazz musicians have come into light. One of these men is a big, burly man by the name of \"Cannonball\" Adderly. The name sounds like something out of a Hollywood movie, but actually, he got this name from his tremendous eating habits in high school where the name started. His name is the only thing that links him with the Stereotype of yesterday. Even the bit about pa- rental injunctions being turned aside (\"It's no use, Dad; you may call it the devil's music, but it's in my blood; besides, I can never be half the preacher you are.\") is no good in this man's case. Julian Adderly studied brass and reeds in high school with firm parental blessing. No Gin, Peanuts There is still more. Instead of slaving for gin and peanuts in a cellar to preserve his art, Cannon- ball was a schoolteacher from the age of twenty (he now teaches English and drama in a Tallahas- see high jschool), serving as band director \"at Dillard High in Fort Lauderdale. He didn't quit until 1956, when he went on the road as a leader of a Jazz quintet. In 1960, his number came up. Af- ter gaining popularity through working in Miles Davis' group, he reorganized his quintet. Since then, he has come out with a new type of jazz that people used to hear during the days of Charlie Parker. He talked as if it were his divine mission to destroy all the myths STUDENT SPOTLIGHT By Patricia Mann Students! Arise and meet the celebrity in our midst. He is Tarn Duffill, one of the more talented members of the Junior class. Tam, a second semester Jun- ior, hopes to be graduated in Au- gust of 1963 with a major in his- tory and a double minor in Span- ish and psychology, After gradua- tion, he plans to attend graduate school and specialize in either his- tory or psychology. Tam came to Alabama College from Fairhope High School in Fair- hope, Alabama. He was born in Bremerton, Washington, on No- vember 22, 1940. Tam, who has been playing the guitar since he was 14 years old, also plays the electric bass. This year he is playing and singing with a quartet Here on campus. Other members of the group Include TAM DUFFILL about illiterate and inarticulate musicians that prevailed since jazz was born. In the following months, his group was built up to a sextet and was able to put out such albums as \"Cannonball Enroute\". (Mercury), \"The Cannonball Adderly Sextet in New York\" (Riverside), and \"A Child's Introduction to Jazz: Ju- lian 'Cannonball' Adderly\" (River- side). His night club work has earned him not only immense pop- ularity, but genuine respect as one of the best Jazz musicians around. Adderly's music is hard to de- scribe. It is contemporary in a sense. From what I have heard him play, I would say that his sax is comparable to that of Parker's, but not as bitter as Parker's was. It is an outgrowth of earlier forms which means it is not entire- ly his own, but in this day, very few have a music they can call their own, including Chubby Check- er. The spirit of Parker persists in Julian's long, surging phrases, in his thorough control of the horn, and in his slightly hard but bouy- ant sound. Let this be a memo to the name droppers, the word droppers, the \"cool ones\" who like to keep Jazz a mystery, the pseudo-intellects, the pseudo-pseudos and Look magazine: Here is a man deeply committed to the heritage of his past, but with his feet firmly plant- ed in the present, listening to the sounds in the future. Here is a man that spoils your myths and stories you have fed to us up to now, be- cause this man is the jazz musician that is representative of our times. Buster Ross, Louis Harris, and Fatz Lowery. When he's not studying, singing or playing with a band, Tam likes to collect folk songs and ride his motocycle. He also enjoys working on cars. Agent \"Finds\" Tam In August of 1961, when Tam was singing in a night club in south Alabama, an agent for RCA heard him and suggested that he send tape recordings of some of his songs to New York. This Tam did and the RCA Company asked him to come to New York for an audi- tion. He spent spring holidays there as the guest of RCA, and recorded four songs. Early in July, Tam signed a con- tract with the RCA-Victor Com- pany and his first record was re- leased nationally on July 10, 1962. This was \"Cooly Dooly,\" which he wrote, backed with \"You Put the Hurt on Me.\" (This record is on the juke box in the Tea House and can be purchased at Betty's Re- cord Shop in Montevallo.) Tam plans to have another release sometime this fall. If Tam does not find success In the entertainment world, he would like to become a college professor. When asked if he had any advice for freshmen, Tam replied, \"I think each of them should find out what is the right combination of work and play for himself or her- self.\" On Wednesday, October 17, a representative of the Peace Corps will speak at Alabama College. The first of his talks will be at 10:00 a.m. in Comer 311. He will speak again at 7: 30 p.m. in Comer Audi- torium. A film will be shown in conjunction with the lectures. USHERS MAKE PLANS Head Usher Vic Brown conduct- ed the first meeting of this year's Usher's Club September 24 in Tut basement. The purpose of the meeting was to orientate new members. New subheads for the year are Nancy Autery, Chris Politis, Bar- bara Forrester, and Lynn Hudson. Anyone interested in participating in the Club's activities is urged to contact Vic Brown. Editor's Note: Mike Hill's laundry list was requested for this issue and it was assumed by the staff that the list would be a perfectly normal one resembling all the other lists given out by the laundry. However, it seems mat Mike Hill Is such a personage on the campus that he has been granted a special list.We of the Alabamian have decided to print this list, in spite of its unorthodoxy, to give the students of A.C. a slight glimpse into the private life of a great man.

Landers Myong Nam Limb, Korean edu- cator who has lived in Japan all of his life, conducted an informal discussion on Japan at the Inter- national Relations Club meeting Monday night. Mr. Limb has been in the United States since 1955. Residing in Nash- ville at the present time, he came here in conjunction with the Mon- tevallo Church of Christ. Mr. Limb told IRC members that Japan was now under strong Com- munist influence. \"About 30% of Japanese profes- sors are Communists or Commu- nist sympathizers,\" he stated. Giving a brief summary of the history of Japan, he stated that the tiny island was able to become a world power in World War II be- cause of two reasons— its religion and its military strength. He went on to explain that the Japanese believed that they were direct descendants of God, and thus had the right to conquer all other peoples. They became strong militarily because they were the first country in the East to acquire guns. Mr. Limb pointed out that Japan, for many years, was a feudalistic country. \"I was surprised to see feudalis- tic conditions still prevailing in the (American) South,\" he said. Mr. Limb is currently working on his Ph.D. Degree at Vanderbilt University. He has numerous de- grees from both American and Japanese universities.

A special assembly called \"Rat Court\" will be held in honor of all Freshmen as a result of the Field Day activi- ties last Saturday. ' The upperclassmen once again showed their get-up-and-go team work in an overwhelming victory over the Freshmen. The scores were: Softball, 31 to 3. Egg Throw, 5 to I. Football, 18 to 0. Upperclassmen also won in the track and tug-of-war contests. The highlight event was a Victory dance in honor of all the upper- classmen. Congratulations to all the participants for the good sport- manship displayed. team captains. Mr. Anderson's team emerged the victor. After a short intermission the two teams met again in a best two out of three game series of volley ball. Mr. Anderson's team won again. Following the team games, the group went to the swimming pool for a swim before going out to the camp house for a picnic supper. After supper the group gathered around the fire place and sang songs accompanied by Kay Cheney and Ann Farley. Fifteen women students stayed at the camp house ftver night. Miss Miriam Collins and Miss Geneva Myrick chaperoned. pation of the coming season. Team members are working almost every afternoon in unofficial practice. Coach Anderson will not indi- cate how he thinks his boys will do this year, but from the smile on his face when this season's team is mentioned you can be sure that AC will be well represented. Team members of last year are Bob Mathews, Darold Dunlavy, Richard Lyle, Jim Mullins, Will Oliver, and Michael Marchese. Others are Lamar Hines, Donly Ray, Robert Singleton, Gillis Payne, and Donald Partridge. P. E. Club Holds Annual Picnic On Saturday afternoon, Septem- ber 29, the Alabama College Physi- cal Education Club held its annual fall picnic. The club met at Bibb Graves Hall for an informal intro- duction. At this time new students and up- perclassmen were provided the op- portunity to become acquainted with one another. The festivities began with a soft- ball game which saw Dr. Chester Palmer and Mr. Floyd Anderson as Tennis Courts Are Popular If you have wandered down to- wards the athletic field recently you are sure to have noticed that both sets of tennis courts are al- most always in use. The reason for this enthusiastic participation in tennis is not due to the weather, but rather to the fine tennis team AC had last year. Last year's team finished the season with a ranking of second place in the Alabama Collegiate Conference. This is not a bad ac- complishment in itself, but the amazing point to note is that not a single player was lost from last year's squad. Every player from last year's team will be eligible.

The Alabamian IT'S GREEK TO GRAY (See Page 2) IN THE HEART OF ALABAMA\" VOLUME XL ALABAMA COLLEGE, MONTEVALLO, ALABAMA, NOVEMBER 8, 1962 NUMBER 3 Critic Thomas Says: if Tiger At The Gates\" Stalks Across Stage, Meets Inevitable Fate Of Curious Cats >ARIS IN LOVE — Helen trayed by Tracy Metclaf life. portrayed by Anne Kemp and Paris por- in \"Tiger At The Gates\" discuss love and By Charles Thomas TIGER AT THE GATES stalked across Palmer stage this weekend past, and met the fate of that other proverbial cat, the Curious One. Its demise was a valiant one, however, and came very hard. Al- though the play very probably did not approach the Broadway pro- duction, which received the New York Critics Award, neither did that production have to contend with a shortage of available actors, understaffed crews, lack of money and equipment, a limited ward- robe, nor a host of other, equally vexing problems. When we see the production in this light, we can have nothing but praise for those points in the production that made the evening, on the whole, a rather enjoyable one. The most obtrusive of these points, naturally, was Mr. Paul Looney. As the prissy poet Demo- kos, Looney cavorted about an otherwise static stage, overplaying, hamming it up, and only incidently giving the most professional, the most enjoyable, and the most live- ly performance in the play. John Batson's Hector was not the most profound sort of characteriza- tion imaginable, but what he had he sustained remarkably well, turn- ing in a pleasant, solid perfor- mance. Helen, played by Ann Kemp, was more than enjoyable in many places, but her delivery was a bit unpolished, and she seemed to fade into the background entirely too of- ten for such a lovely femme fatale —a thing that Helen would never do, if we are to believe Homer. Tracy Metclaf did as much for the role of Paris as he did for the role of Romeo last season. Shirley Styles, as Hecuba, and James Rohr, as the blustering, thoroughly obnoxious Ajax, both sustained their characters quite well. We are not surprised at Miss Styles' invariably excellent per- formance, but were gladdened that a newcomer carried it off so well. The remainder of the cast, many of them old troopers, acted well their parts, but outside of a few mo- ments of brilliance, which most of them had, the play lacked sparkle. Why this was so is beyond human divination, we suppose; such things just happen. We can, however, give a qualified \"well done\" to the cast and crew, and look forward with high expectations to the forthcom- ing DIARY OF ANNE FRANK in December. As a sort of footnote to this re- view, we might consider the play itself, or rather its philosophy. As a play, it is brilliant and effective. Only one dissenting thought occurs, and it concerns not the artistry of the play, which is above reproach, but the idea that underlies it. Writing in the late 'thirties, Jean Giradoux warned his countrymen that the tiger of war was at their gates. \"War is madness, idiocy, and unworthy of civilized man,\" he seems to say in this play, and this might be true today. He warned the world to get rid of this tiger- to appease it, mollify it, make peace with it. The world seemed to follow Jean Giradoux' s advice then, as some would now. The world tried appeasing the tiger, all for the sake of Peace. A scant few years later, the British were eva- cuating Dunkirk beaches, and SS officers strolled down the Champs Elysees. War was ushered into France by the dreaded Panzer Di- visions. Ironically, the tanks of this division were called Tigers. Can we appease the tiger at our gates today, M. Giradoux? j A C Visit Planned By Marine Corps November 12-13, 1962 will mark the campus visit of the Marine Corps Officer Selection Team head- ed by Captain A. L. Stewart, Jr. The team will talk to college men and women about the officer train- ing program offered by the Ma- rines. Freshmen, sophomores, and jun- iors in good standing are eligible for the platoon leaders class. PLC prepares a man for a Marine commission by two summer train- ing camps, each six weeks, during the regular summer vacations from school. During the school year, there are no classes or drills to in- terfere with study or activities. Both camps are held at Quantico, Virginia. Candidates are paid at camp and receive first-class transportation to and from Quantico. PLC candi- dates are draft deferred while en- rolled in college. Upon graduation, they are commissioned second lieutenants. Seniors and recent graduates are I eligible for the officer candidate course program which is a direct assignment from civilian life to a ten-week course as an officer can- didate. Completion of this course, also held at Quantico, Virginia, during the spring and fall, means a Marine commission. Upon enrollment in either the platoon leaders class or the officer candidate course, each man may choose to train for either a ground or an aviation commission. When he graduates and is commissioned, bis chosen field is the one in which he will assume duties as a Marine icer. Newly commissioned avia- officers begin flight training at Pensacola, Florida, while those commissioned in the ground com- ponents report immediately to Quantico for duty. Institute Offers Seven Scholarships For Undergraduate Study Abroad he w offio tion Scholarship applications for un- dergraduate study in Europe dur- ing the academic year 1963-64 will be accepted by the Institute of European Studies beginning Thurs- day, November 1. Seven scholarships are being of- fered for study at the Institute's centers in Vienna, Paris, and Frei- burg, West Germany. Included are three full scholarships which cover all basic costs such as tuition, fees, field-study trips, room, most meals, and round-trip ocean transporta- tion from the United States. Each program embraces formal classes, lectures, seminars and field-study, and is designed to ful- fil usual course requirements at its academic level, officials of the Institute said. The programs in Vienna and Paris are open to col- lege sophomores and juniors, while the Freiburg program is limited to juniors. A full scholarship valued at $2,230 and partial scholarships valued at $500 and $1,000 are avail- able for the Institute's program at the University of Vienna. The program there combines English-taught liberal arts and general studies courses, intensive German language instruction, regu- lar university courses taught in German for those competent in that language, and supplementary lectures and seminars. Previous knowledge of German is not requir- ed. For its program at the Univer- sity of Freiburg, the Institute is of- fering a full scholarship worth $2,125 and a partial scholarship valued at $1,000. The program stresses political science, German language study, German philoso- phy and literature, and European history, with all classes taught in German. Scholarships offered for study in Paris include one covering all basic costs, equivalent to $2,475, and a partial scholarship valued at $500. Intended for superior stu- dents, the program encompasses liberal arts and general studies combined With opportunities for in- dependent study at the University of Paris and other institutes of higher learning in Paris. The Institute's announcement said scholarships will be granted on the basis of academic achieve- ment, financial need, and recom- mendation by the applicant's \"home\" college or university. Ap- plicants must be aged 18 to 24 and unmarried. Completed applications must be submitted no later than February 15, 1963. Forms and descriptive literature are available from the Institute of European Studies, 35 E. Wacker Drive, Chicago 1. Awards will be announced about May 1, 1963. Enrollees bound for Paris and Vienna will sail for Europe late in August, followed in mid-September by those bound for the Freiburg program. The Institute, a nonprofit organi- zation described as the largest in- stitution conducting foreign study programs, is currently accepting non-scholarship applications for its spring semester, 1963, program at the universities of Vienna and Frei- burg. The application deadline for those programs is December 10, with sailing scheduled for early February. Seminar Announcements Alabama College is making plans for a European Seminar for the summer of 1963, it is announced by Miss Lucille Griffith, chairman of the faculty committee making the arrangements. This is a program of study and travel for which Ala- bama College will give summer school credit. While the details for the coming seminar have not been worked out, it is assumed that the program will be similar to the ones in the past. In 1961 the Alabama College stu- dents attended lectures in England, the Netherlands, and France and travelled in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. They attended con- certs and plays and visited many museums and historic scenic places. A member of the Alabama Col- lege faculty will accompany the group as director and there will be a European student as a guide. A meeting of all interested in the seminar was held after Convoca- tion, October 30, in Palmer Audi- torium. out future obligation. In addition to these programs, the WAC offers unlimited job op- portunities to qualified high srhnol graduates in a variety of interest- ing career fields. Capt. Heseman, a native of Ala- meda, California, is a graduate of San Jose State College and served as Dean of Girls and Counselor at Yuba City High School in Califor- nia prior to being commissioned in the Women's Army Corps. Captain Heseman discussed career oppor- tunities in the Women's Army Corps with interested young wo- men during her visit to Alabama College. TOWER ANNOUNCEMENTS In order to promote interest in The Tower, A.C.'s literary maga- zine, Editor Pam St. John is giv- ing a $20 prize for the best poem and short story submitted. Because of the limitef budget of The Tower, Pam is requesting that students send contributions for this endeavor. Send all contributions to Pam St. John, c/o The Tower. Women's Army Comes To AC Captain Virginia L. Heseman, Women's Army Corps Career Guid- ance Officer for the Third United States Army Recruiting District, visited Alabama College on Wed- nesday November 7, to discuss the career opportunities offered by the Women's Army Corps. The Women's Army Corps is now offering direct commissions as of- ficers to qualified college grad- uates who are interested in a career as an executive. For young women who have completed their Junior year in college, the Wo- men's Army Corps has adopted a four-week summer orientation pro- gram, without further obligation, to afford these young women an op- portunity to sample WAC life with- College Press Meets In Detroit Detroit, Michigan, was the scene for the twenty-eighth annual Asso- ciated College Press \"Conference held October 25, 26, 27. Over 900 delegates from all over the nation attended. Sectional meetings were held for yearbooks, magazines, and news- papers of colleges. Basic journa- lism courses were presented as well as panel discussions on vari- ous problems that collegiate jour- nalists encounter. Topics of meetings included: \"Better Copy in Yearbooks,\" \"Stu- dent Vacuum,\" \"Freedom of the College Press,\" and \"Advertising Short Course.\" General Motors also sponsored a banquet the following day. Harri- son E. Salisbury of the New York Times spoke on \"The New Rus- sia.\" In his speech he emphasized that Americans were not aware of how strong and powerful a nation Russia is. He stressed the im- portance of a free American press that would inform the people about the true position of Russia as a world power. Attending the ACP Convention from Alabama College were: Class editor of Montage, Harriet Sco- field; Associate Editor of ALA- BAMIAN, James Allen Ray; Edi- tor-in-Chief of ALABAMIAN, Mari- lyn Landers; Faculty Adviser for Publications, Miss Maria Jane Adams. Page 2 November 8, 1962 THE ALABAMIAN, Alabama Colleg SUSGA Workshop Held At Auburn by James Allen Ray \"To better resolve our common problems ...\" This was perhaps the general character of the an- nual Southern Universities Student Government Association Publica- tions Workshop. Held at Auburn University, the workshop was at- tended by students from more than fifty colleges and universities. Dr. Robert C. Anderson, Execu- tive Vice President, Auburn Uni- versity, was the guest speaker at the opening session. Discussions ranged from finance, organization, to photography. Edith Edfeldt, Editor of the Montage, commented upon impressions at Auburn. \"We found out how for- tunate 'we were concerning prob- lems faced by many year book staffs.\" Edith also said she receiv- ed many beneficial ideas from the conference. Marilyn Landers, Editor of the Alabamian, commented upon the lively discussions held on edi- torial policy and the role of the newspaper editor. Marilyn had this to say, \"The staff of the Ala- bamian considered itself very for- tunate in relation to censorship and editorial policy advisory boards.\" She continued, \"The Alabamian should be governed by a complete policy of journalistic freedom.\" Pamela St. John, Editor of the Tower, had this to say, \"I found out that the Tower is a well known literary magazine, which has the respect of many colleges through- out the state.\" Pam also said she profited from the meetings. She is in the process of procurring an exchange list. Thursday night a banquet was held in the Student Union Building. Mr. Rohr Hickman, President of Alabama Engraving Company, spoke at the banquet. Talent fur- nished by International Talent As- sociates of New York was a con- cert by the Journeymen, a folk song group. ^Thoge attending besides the edi- tors were Susanne Owens from the Tower; Ed Blake and Lynn Hud- son from the Montage; and Dottie Pitts, John Tyler, James Ray, and Wilmer Oliver from the Alabamian. Steve Huffstutler, Chairman of the Publications Committee; and Darold Dunlavy, President of Stu- dent Government Association, also attended. Editors' Comment College newspaper editors and staffs gathered last month at Au- burn for the SUSGA Worshop. They represented collegiate press throughout the Deep South. One subject emphasized was censor- ship. This seems to be one of the most discussed topics whenever newspaper students meet. The Alabamian staff was proud to announce in the open discussions that there was no censorship, no editorial advisory committee, and no pressure on the editors to print or not print this or that. One of the main points involving censorship in student press is poli- tics. This includes social and governmental matters. The Ala- bamian has a policy which governs these subjects. This policy is a policy drawn up by the Editorial Staff of The Ala- bamian. We will not editorialize on mat- ters which are highly provocative and controversial; if they endanger the financial, academic or political status of Alabama College. We reserve the right to com- ment upon student, faculty, and ad- ministration. We print opinions based upon fact. We urge opinions or rebuttal to any thing concerning the paper or the school, through a letter to the editor. We The Alabamian editors are proud of this freedom and shall conduct ourselves in a manner so as to continue under the present policy. We do not feel that the poli- cy is too loose or too tight. We challenge any attempt to change this policy unless under special or specific conditions. POEM by Royce Jordan I've been in many predicaments, Some were large, some small. But the predicament I got into yesterday, Was the biggest one of all. It didn't really worry me much, The time I wrecked Harry's car. It only upset me little when I got caught, Underage in Joe's Bar. I got caught stealing hub caps, And was on probation six months or so. Why I've done almost everything, To get my hands on a little dough. The time I lost my head, And got into a brawl. The time I hit a police car, And the time I got caught by \"Fatz\" playing poker in the hall I guess I've had a lot of nerve, But yesterday I got carried away. So now here it is tomorrow, I'm getting married today.

It seems that there is a campaign underway de- ~ - ' signed to create and stimulate interest in the foremost honorary men's organization on this campus. Said cam- ^■T^- paign is intended to arouse a wee bit of curiosity, and B t when enough curiosity has been excited and sufficient I ■ interest manifested, perhaps this organization can get Hi I I to its real business of making this school better than it is now, and making this student body better than it is at present. There are twenty-nine organizations on campus. Twenty-three of them don't function. The one mentioned above (which for the time being shall remain nameless . . . see, if you're really interested you might go to the trouble of checking the Greek alphabet and finding out just what those symbols mean.) definitely does.

This isn't turning into a personals column, but we have been asked to announce that anyone interested in accompanying a group of fellow students to the annual snowball fight at Rinky-Dink, should contact Mike Hill.

The picture accompanying this column has caused no little com ment itself ... in answer to the questions it has raised, yes I do smile . . . occasionally . . . and in order to lengthen the paragraph, let me add this ... if there is anyone who wants to work on the Alabamian don't hestitate to come up ... the office is in Reynolds Hall, second floor . . . office hours are from 7 to 10 or anytime theing light's on . . . Also in answer to a question asked recently, the only censorship on this paper is good taste ... in order for a newspaper to function pro- perly that is the way it must be and anytime this right is tampered with, all concerned will suffer . . . I hate to go through this column without mentioning Jerry Gray at i least one more time ... his attempt at literary creation is really im-, proving . . . maybe one of these days he'll say something worth-; while . . . Since last issue, the food and other things in the dining hall have improved considerably and this should be acknowledged . . . however, 1 the weekend meals, notably the suppers, offer very little to be en-' thusiastic about . . . perhaps the reason for this is the small number of students who remain on campus ... it seems, though, that these va j people should be fed as well over the weekend as they are during the week when those that regularly leave are here Has anybody ever thought about how much money is saved by hav- loi ;es ing a free juke box in the Tea House instead of a coin-devouring ^ monster like most places have ... or how quiet the place would be if weren't free ... pm And in closing . . . Larry Ross, if you're talking about what I think you're talking about, you don't know what you're talking about . . . Until next time . . .

He was perhaps a deca- jent poet, as the world has come lo label those souls who concern- »d themselves with wine, women and song. People never forgot Modigliani with his aristocratic bearing, his landsome features, his diabolical >ride. Legend usually describes iim as a Bohemian who seemed in g mad frenzy to live his life in ex- citement because of his ill health. } Born in Leghorn, Italy in 1884, t Modigliani was first influenced by the Italian art of his time and also if the Renaissance masters. He iad his first lessons at fourteen by ine Micheli. Modigliani was suffer- ng from a pulmonary disease at his time and spent several years n southern Italy for bis health. Af- er convalescing, he visited Rome, Florence and Venice and was able o study the works of great artists jefore him. by Ronnie Horton Modigliani arrived in Paris in J1906. Here he was influenced by ;ezanne and of course the tradi- ions of Impressionism and Divi- iionism. But the real influen- 3 :es were from the works of Bran- tfcusi, a sculptor; and the carvings rjfrom Africa. These influences are r >vident in much of his work. Having tuberculosis did not hin- der his wild mad life. He consumed unlimited quantities of alcohol and also tried drugs, including Hashish. He slept wherever he could find a bed or a floor, and ate whenever he could afford it. Modigliani was often forced to sell his painting for ridiculously low prices in order to buy food. He had his first official recogni- tion as an artist when he exhibited at the Solon des Independants in 1910 and again in 1911. Through a Polish art dealer and poet Leopold Zborowski, Modigliani was able to sell his paintings at reasonable prices and also in 1917 to have the first one man show at the Berthe Weille Gallery. Modigliani's works have amazed many, especially his nudes which he presented with a candor and frankness that so shocked the authorities that they closed his ex- hibitions. His works weren't re- ceived well by the public until several years after his death be- cause of this. Modigliani died in January of 1920 of meningitis after only two days in the hospital. His wife, Jo- y Anna Hebuterne, threw herself from a window on hearing of his death. Montparnasse was emptied of artists the day of Modigliani's funeral for the people knew, loved, and admired him. Modi- gliani had what he wanted, a short and intense life. EXCHANGE NEWS Lancaster, Pa.— (LP.)— A nation- M placement service to match aca- idemic personnel with the needs of academic institutions is needed to lelp trim the excessive costs of faculty recruitment, according to \"President Frederick Bolman, Jr., 'of Franklin and Marshall College. Not only is present recruitment sprocedure costly and time consum- eing, said President Bolman, it loesn't even have efficiency to re- »mmend it. The judicious use of 1 kvailable recruiting techiques does \" lot guarantee finding the right 1 man for the job. In proposing his plan for a na- tional clearing house which would ' issemble information on schools - ind available faculty, President lolman made it clear that such » a placement service would have to r perform two functions: first, 'gathering, sorting, and matching Information on schools and per- r tonnel; second, making available 3 valid evaluation techniques. Si pjXI- President Bolman expressed loubt whether automatic pre- ssing machines could adequately ' handle the evaluation of individual ; Abilities and institutional needs, mt he said this is a problem to be c rorked out. In the meantime, old- ashioned verbal interviews will lave to continue doing this job. In looking ahead, he said that ' while the need for such a service is ilready great, it will become even nore important as both the num- >er and turnover rate of college acuity increases. It is necessary, ie warned, in making use of such • i service to keep two cautions in nind: the first is to be sure the f ervice provides complete informa- ion on a candidate or school; the Second is to insure objective, can- lid information. , Concerning this second caution, y W. Bolman said, \"Graduate school s {acuity and others must be taught n>ot to write those eloquent, if im- proper"
