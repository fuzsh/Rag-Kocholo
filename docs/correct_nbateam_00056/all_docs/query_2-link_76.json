        "text": "Former Maryland basketball star Steve Blake was about eight years into his 13-year NBA career when he began thinking about his post-playing career.\n\nAs his playing career wound down, Blake took part in National Basketball Players Association programs to learn about his options once he retired. He began coaching his kids' AAU teams after retiring, and this past season, Blake served as a coaching intern with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nBlake, 39, was hired by the Phoenix Suns as an assistant coach in June. He'll work alongside head coach Monty Williams, who was hired in May after the Suns went 19-63 during the 2018-19 season."
