        "text": "Considering Blake's hyper-competitive nature I wouldn't be surprised if the acquisition of these other guards only drove him harder; there's two ways to react as an athlete: elevate your game and rise to the challenge, or roll over and pout about it. From the sounds of things Blake chose the former route versus the latter... which is great for him and great for the team. Now we wait and see if this translates to success on the court.\n\nThe problem is that substitution patterns in the NBA aren't like a hockey line change -- you don't swap out 5 for 5; so there are undoubtedly going to be starters on the floor at all times. The reason Blake is probably a better fit on the starting unit is that he's proven that he knows how to run the offense and set people up and with the potentially dominate frontcourt that we possess you want, need and should be feeding Greg and LaMarcus as often as possible.\n\nIF Bayless can show that he's capable of running the offense and setting other people up, then it's possible that in time he'll move into that starter's role, but for all his summer league heroics, he's still just a rookie, and it's almost a given that rookie point guards struggle in the NBA -- look at Chris Paul and Deron Williams rookie seasons; those guys weren't exactly world beaters out of the gate.\n\nI agree, it may not be all five guys out but there are going to be plenty of times that you are sitting both Roy and Blake so Rudy and Bayless will be playing together.\n\nRoy is running the show on the 1st unit so Blake will spend most of his time being a spot up shooter. I'm not saying Bayless is better than Blake, I'm just making the argument if Bayless is the better shooter he should be the starter allowing us to move Blake to run the 2nd unit. Also from the sounds of it Bayless is going to be a very good defender so he can concentrate on defense and spot up shooting in the first unit. Just my opinion.\n\nI understand what you're trying to say, but the fact is Roy has never been the team's point guard for the whole game; typically he's slid over to that role in the fourth quarter ... in which case I can see a good argument for Bayless (or Rudy?) to be on the floor with him at the same time. But our \"vanilla\" starting unit is going to need to be able to get into its half-court sets, protect possessions, and try to convert at a high rate. Don't forget that the second unit guys are frequently going to be paired off against the other teams' bench guys, which means burners like Jerryd, and slashers like Rudy should theoretically be able to get by their man, and will have more opportunities against second string bigs.\n\nAs for who is the better shooter between Bayless and Blake that remains to be seen, but based on last year's performance Blake's mark of 40% from 3 is going to be pretty tough for Jerryd to top -- he's still going to have to adjust to the NBA line.\n\nIn any case, I think we'll all agree that the season can't start soon enough so we don't have to keep talking about all this stuff on an academic level, and instead can over-analyze and pick apart game performances and start debating who should get the bulk of PT.\n\nGreat point and that only adds to the depth of the Blazers. But I believe Blake's limitations will keep him from seeing the court as much as he likes. We stuggled last year with getting easy buckets because Roy & Jack were the only players that could/would take it to the rack. KP saw this and got Bayless, and Rudy is fearless, so there goes some of Blake's minutes.\n\nIf he could shoot aroun 45% from three, then he could hold down his spot in the rotation to keep the floor spread."
