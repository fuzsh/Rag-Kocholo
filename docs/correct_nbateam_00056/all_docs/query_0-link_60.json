        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA gritty and tenacious leader on the court. He ran the offense well, was a smart distributor, and he didn't make a lot of mistakes with the rock. He was a pass-first point guard, yet was also clutch with the three-ball. His big hands gave him an edge as a ball-handler. He was quicker than he was fast, and he didn't get to the rim well (with his offense mostly perimeter-focused, significantly hampering his field-goal percentage). He could get posted up on defense, and his lack of bulk made him less than durable over the years."
