        "text": "During his time with the Golden State Warriors, Steph Curry has had 106 teammates who have appeared in at least one game. Some played in exactly one game, while others played in hundreds. Some never actually played in a game that Curry was active for, while others formed historically great partnerships with him.\n\nAnd I’m ranking all 106 of them before a new season starts and he adds to the tally. Better get a move on.\n\nPlayers are ranked — and stats are shown — based only on their time as Curry’s teammate. How good/bad they were in other organizations doesn’t matter. How good/bad they were on pre-2009-10 Warriors teams doesn’t matter.\n\n#47 — Steve Blake\n\nGames: 28 (T-70th out of 106)\n\nPoints per game: 4.4 (T-68th out of 106)\n\nRebounds per game: 2.0 (T-70th out of 106)\n\nAssists per game: 3.6 (T-9th out of 106)\n\nIf you’re an NBA fan, you’re surely quite familiar with Steve Blake. Yet even if you’re a Warriors-loving NBA fan, it can be hard to remember that Blake was a member of the Dubs.\n\nThat’s not an indictment of his time in Oakland. It’s just that Blake played 870 career games for eight NBA teams, and just 28 of those games came in a Warriors jersey. He has a long NBA story, and the Warriors are something of a footnote.\n\nBlake joined the Warriors towards the end of the 2013-14 season, in the trade that sent Kent Bazemore to the Los Angeles Lakers. He played out the end of the season, including the fun playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, and then was on to his next team.\n\nHe struggled with this shot while in the Bay Area, and that made his efficiency rather ugly. But he took care of the ball, dished out a lot of assists, and played very solid defense. He was nothing special, but just what the doctor ordered to back up Steph Curry."
