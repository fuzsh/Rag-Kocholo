        "text": "Steve Blake Biography\n\nA current member of the NBA, Steve Blake has been a lover of the game of basketball all his life. Growing up in Hollywood, Florida, Blake starred on his high school teams at both Miami Killian High School and Miami High School. After winning consecutive state championship titles, his high school basketball career was unfortunately cut short when it was revealed that some of the team members did not live in correct zone to be playing for the high school. However, Blake did not let that stop him from pursuing basketball in the years to come. He went on to play for the University of Maryland, where he immediately started for the team his first year and became the first ACC player to earn 1,000 points, 800 assists, 400 rebounds and 200 steals. Making a name for himself as a phenomenal passer, Blake helped lead his university to a Final Four appearance in 2001 and later, an NCAA championship in 2002. As the 38th pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, the Washington Wizards did not hesitate to scoop up the talented, young athlete. Throughout his time in the NBA, Blake has also played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors. He currently plays for the Portland Trail Blazers, as he returned to their team to sign a $4.2 million deal just before this past season as an interchangeable point and shooting guard.\n\nBook Steve Blake for your Next Event"
