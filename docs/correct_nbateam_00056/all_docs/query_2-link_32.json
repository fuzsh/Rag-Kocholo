        "text": "Post by DiamondThief on\n\nBlazers to sign veteran PG Steve Blake\n\nVeteran point guard Steve Blake will return for his third stint with the Trail Blazers, reported by Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nBlake and the team have agreed on a two-year contract where the Blazers will use their $2.1 million bi-annual exception. The contract will contain a player option for the second year. Blake played for the Blazers from 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2010. He was traded to the Clippers along with Travis Outlaw on trade deadline day 2010 in the deal which brought Marcus Camby to Portland.\n\nHe is expected to back up Damian Lillard at point guard.\n\nHe has averaged 6.9 points and 4.0 assists over his career, with the best year of his career coming in 2008-09 with the Blazers where he averaged 11.0 points and 5.0 assists while starting in all 69 games in which he played. He also shot 38.8 percent from three-point range over his career\n\nBlake last played with the Warriors, who acquired him in February from the Lakers. He will be entering his 12th season in the league. Blake, who owns a home in Portland, attended the University of Maryland.\n\n- ANM\n\nPost by SurferGirl on\n\nI liked Blake in the half season the Clippers had him. He's a smart guy who can definitely contribute to the bench. I kind of see him as a Mo Williams type of guy who plays much better defense. For what Neil Olshey had to work with, this is a pretty good move.\n\nPost by DiamondThief on\n\nWanted Mo back, not this traitor. This is going backwards, not forwards.\n\nWe did not have money to sign Mo without going into the luxury tax.\n\nWhat makes Blake a traitor? That he played for the Lakers?\n\nPost by Kasey on\n\nhe's a great teammate and a great guy so i think he will gel with the team rather easily. he's a much better defender than Mo was so in that regard this is a good signing. what always frustrated me about him was his inconsistent shooting. one night he would hit 8-10 and give us 18 points and the next he would go like 1-9 and it would end up hurting us. i had a feeling we might get Steve because the money seemed right for a guy at his stage of career. offensively, this may not be the best move, but defensively it should help us a lot.\n\nnow if we could just trade Leonard for a draft pick and sign Ha Seung-Jin, i would be a very happy girl!\n\nPost by DiamondThief on\n\nI will also add that back in December 2011 when it was announced that the lockout was over and players could begin practicing at any team's practice facility, Steve Blake was the first player in the gym at the Blazers practice facility and one of the first around the entire league to get back to work. I think that says a lot about his competitiveness and desire to be the best player he can be.\n\nPost by newellbrian on\n\nWanted Mo back, not this traitor.

That he played for the Lakers?\n\nMo didn't necessarily want more money, just a longer contract. And it's the fact that Blake WILLINGLY signed for the Lakers that makes him a traitor.\n\nPost by newellbrian on\n\nhe's a great teammate and a great guy so i think he will gel with the team rather easily. he's a much better defender than Mo was so in that regard this is a good signing. what always frustrated me about him was his inconsistent shooting. one night he would hit 8-10 and give us 18 points and the next he would go like 1-9 and it would end up hurting us. i had a feeling we might get Steve because the money seemed right for a guy at his stage of career. offensively, this may not be the best move, but defensively it should help us a lot.\n\nnow if we could just trade Leonard for a draft pick and sign Ha Seung-Jin, i would be a very happy girl!\n\nI'd trade Leonard for a sandwich.\n\nPost by DiamondThief on\n\nWe did not have money to sign Mo without going into the luxury tax.\n\nWhat makes Blake a traitor?

My theory is that he was working as a double-secret agent for the Blazers all along, spying on and sabotaging the Lakers efforts to make the playoffs. He accomplished his mission so we brought him home!\n\nPost by newellbrian on\n\nMo didn't necessarily want more money, just a longer contract.
