        "text": "Pistons ship Quincy Miller to Nets for Blake, which means team could carry four point guards into 2015-16 season\n\nWith Brandon Jennings still recuperating from a ruptured left Achilles and an uneven summer-league performance from Spencer Dinwiddie, the Detroit Pistons went searching for some insurance behind starting point guard Reggie Jackson.\n\nAnd they hope that have found it in veteran Steve Blake.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons acquired Blake, 35, from the Brooklyn Nets for forward Quincy Miller, the team announced Monday evening.\n\nThe move instantly creates questions about Jennings and Dinwiddie, but Pistons president Stan Van Gundy said Blake is an inexpensive insurance policy.\n\n\"Just insurance,\" Van Gundy told the Free Press via text. \"We're very hopeful that Brandon will play at a high level. And can develop Spencer, but not have pressure on him.\"\n\nBlake, 35, is on the books for one season at $2.1 million and it appears the Pistons will go with four point guards on their roster next season.\n\nJennings, 25, suffered the injury in January and the team says his rehab is on schedule. He has yet to start running yet, and that's the goal for next month.\n\nDinwiddie, 22, averaged more than four turnovers in five games during the Orlando Summer League last week.\n\nThe Pistons have the rights to 17 players for 15 roster spots. With the expectation that Danny Granger will ultimately be waived, it appears Darrun Hilliard, Reggie Bullock and Cartier Martin will fight for two roster spots.\n\nBlake, 35, has appeared in 812 career games (345 starts) in 12 seasons with seven teams.\n\nMiller, 22, signed two 10-day contracts with the Pistons before being signed for the remainder of the season on March 13. He played little, but there was hope he would impress at summer league. He suffered a broken nose during practices and was forced to miss all five games.\n\nRealGM is reporting the Nets will waive Miller and his nonguaranteed contract."
