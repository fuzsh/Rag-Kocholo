In this piece we hear Kuyper’s heart speaking a language that some have described as baroque, language that suits both the occasion and his subject.\n\nThe arrangement of this piece into numbered segments is entirely our invention, as are all the notes.\n\nThe translated sermon you are about to enjoy owes its readability at many points to Dr. Harry Vandyke, who kindly reviewed the piece and suggested numerous essential improvements. Dr. John Halsey Wood Jr. also deserves our thanks for his thoughtful suggestions.\n\nNelson D. Kloosterman\n\nFOREWORD\n\nAlthough he is celebrated for his achievements in the academy and in politics, concern for the church permeated Abraham Kuyper’s career and even preceded these other concerns. Kuyper’s student days were marked by a master’s thesis and a doctoral dissertation on the history and theology of the church. He then took several pastoral positions in the Netherlands Reformed Church, the broad national church of the Netherlands. Parallel to the founding of the Free University of Amsterdam and the Antirevolutionary political party was Kuyper’s work as an instigator of a secession church out of the national church in 1886. He continued as an active teacher, preacher, and churchman in that church for the rest of his life. In fact, one of Kuyper’s last writings was a series of articles on ecclesiology, which remained unfinished only because of his death.\n\nThis translation of Abraham Kuyper’s Rooted & Grounded anticipates the publication of a larger collection of Kuyper’s writings on the church soon to appear under the imprint of Christian’s Library Press and by the generous support of Rimmer de Vries and the Acton Institute. The complete volume will include selections from Kuyper’s doctoral dissertation on the theology of John Calvin and John a Lasco; various treatises and sermons, such as Twofold Fatherland and Address on Missions; and selections from larger works on the church, such as Kuyper’s commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism, and his Antirevolutionary Politics. The centerpiece will be Kuyper’s programmatic statement Tract on the Reformation of the Churches, which takes a unique approach to ecclesiology, particularly its development through the stages of church formation, deformation, and reformation. In addition, two interpretive essays will be included, one theological by Ad de Bruijne and one historical by John Halsey Wood. This larger collection by no means exhausts Kuyper’s ecclesiological reflections, since they were so numerous, but it aims to provide readers of Abraham Kuyper and anyone generally concerned with theology in the nineteenth century and the modern period with a resource on one of the most contentious issues and one of the most dynamic figures of the era.\n\nJohn Halsey Wood Jr.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAbraham Kuyper and the Challenge of the Church\n\nJohn Halsey Wood Jr.\n\nAbraham Kuyper preached his sermon Rooted and Grounded at a time when the ground was shifting under the feet of the churches in the West. His sermon was, of course, not a comprehensive theological account, but he nonetheless provided in short compass an account of the church that answered the chief questions raised by modern society: What is the church? and What is its position in the emerging society?\n\nHistoriography of nineteenth-century theology, particularly Protestant theology, regularly treats the secularization of the mind, rationalism, as the primary theological challenge, especially when beginning with matters of Scripture and theological prolegomena.¹ Abraham Kuyper, however, perceived the main challenge facing Christianity differently. [A] time like ours, Kuyper said, was a time when especially the church question dominates every other issue.² Elsewhere he said that the church problem was none other than the problem of Christianity itself.³ It should not surprise us, then, to find that Kuyper often thought in terms similar to Max Weber’s and Ernst Troeltsch’s church and sect, since these contemporaries were likewise concerned with the church question.⁴\n\nSocial changes, as much or more than intellectual ones, caused trouble for the church. Mass, democratic culture, the separation of church and state, and religious pluralism were particularly difficult to"
