        "text": "For Bavinck is it not enough that “grace restores nature,” but rather that “grace repairs and perfects nature,” and this concept of the latent perfectibility of nature is what holds Bavinck’s whole nature/grace relationship together. As Brian Mattson highlights, for Bavinck included in the notion of imago Dei is not simply what humanity is at their creation, but also what they must become. Such a destiny of humanity detailed in the covenant of works serves as a limiting principle for how one is to understand the nature of redemption: grace in restoring and perfecting nature does not return creation to the pristine conditions of its beginning, but rather leads it into the beatitudinal perfection for which it was designed. Therefore, nature and grace are united in a singular telos of God.\n\nThis article examines two fundamental ecclesiological questions in light of the confession “credo in unam ecclesiam,” which is one of the marks of the Church —indeed, it has first place in the list of marks: one, holy, catholic, and apostolic—in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (A.D. 381). This confession can mean two things. First, it can mean that there is only one Church, not many churches, and this oneness then refers to the unicity of the one and only Church in which many individual churches are united in Trinitarian communion, the unity of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Second, it can mean that the Church possesses inner unity, meaning thereby as Walter Cardinal Kasper explains, “being undivided, and thus the identity of the Church with itself and the unanimity in the Church.” Now, I shall examine the unicity of the Church and her inner unity by addressing two questions: “What is the Church? But also: Where is the Church and where is she realized in her fullness?” These questions will be considered in light of the ecclesiology of the Dutch master of dogmatic and ecumenical theology, G.C. Berkouwer (1903-1996), and Walter Kasper (1933-), the Roman Catholic theologian, cardinal, and the former President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (2001-2010). The article proceeds in the following manner. First, I consider the views of Berkouwer and Kasper on the unicity and hence unity of the Church as well as the concrete place where the Church is realized in all her fullness. Especially important in making their views clear is understanding the distinctions they make between unity and uniformity, division and diversity, and complementary and contradictory differences in ecclesiological epistemology. Second, Catholic teaching holds that “[j]ust as in Jesus Christ, God has taken form not in any general humanity, but by becoming concretely ‘this’ man Jesus of Nazareth, it is analogously true that the fullness of salvation revealed in Jesus Christ is also present in a concrete visible form” in the Catholic Church. This scandal of ecclesiological particularity in this concrete Church “provokes opposition in other churches and church communities.” Third, I will respond to this opposition that is expressed in the charge, for example, that the Catholic Church’s ecclesiology has the tendency to “assimilate Christology into ecclesiology,” or make “the church . . . constitutive of the Son’s identity’s as are the Father and the Spirit.” In sum, the main aim of this paper is to provide an answer to the question regarding ecclesial unity and diversity within the one Church of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn this study I argue that Abraham Kuyper’s doctrine of common grace is ultimately inconsistent with his understanding of particular grace within the parameters of supralapsarianism which he sets for himself. This inconsistency leads to stark tension in Kuyper’s thought which gives rise to prolific debates in the early to mid-twentieth century over the doctrine of common grace among the Dutch Reformed churches on both sides of the Atlantic. Ultimately these debates concern whether God’s disposition of favor towards his creation in general, as articulated by Kuyper’s doctrine of common grace, can be reconciled with Reformed orthodoxy. This study surveys Kuyper’s theology of common grace and the ensuing debates over the doctrine represented in the writings of Herman Bavinck, Herman Hoeksema, Klaas Schilder, and Cornelius Van Til. This study will then argue that, as shown by the debates over common grace, Kuyper’s supralapsarianism hamstrings what he intends to accomplish in his doctrine of common grace, namely a program for Christian cultural engagement. Further, infralapsarian attempts to modify Kuyper’s framework pose no better progress towards consistency regarding common grace and God’s decrees. My proposal is for common grace to be reconstructed within a Molinist framework in order to accomplish what Kuyper intends for his popularly-cited doctrine.\n\nRecent critiques of Protestantism argue that its theological principles undercut ecclesial unity while creating endless interpretive plurality. This plurality, in turn, perpetuates the secular conditions that characterize the contemporary Western world-the nurturing of personal autonomy, a buffered self that deafens theological dimensions of existence, and an unenduring institutional visibility that renders Protestant churches incapable of engaging the modern world with a unified theological voice. In this context, this paper retrieves Herman Bavinck's understanding that a specifically Protestant view of the church can properly ground a catholicity that centers on a unity-in-diversity that is \"confessional, international, and cosmopolitan\" in character. Word Count: 6892 words. Writing on the perennial philosophical conundrums that plague theology, William Abraham comments that the \"epistemic and political turmoil that grew out of the disputes after the Reformation were sufficiently radical to generate the Enlightenment.\" 1 Abraham's remark rings a familiar note. Indeed, recent critiques of Protestantism argue that its theological principles undercut ecclesial unity while creating endless interpretive plurality. This plurality, in turn, perpetuates what Brad Gregory has called an \"unintended Reformation\" that fosters the secular conditions that characterize the contemporary Western world-the nurturing of personal autonomy, a buffered self that deafens theological dimensions of existence, and an unenduring institutional visibility that renders Protestant churches incapable of engaging the modern world with a concrete and unified theological voice. 2 Similar arguments to Gregory's are propelled by Hans Boersma, and Catholic and secular apologists alike, suggesting that Protestantism is unintentionally the hotbed from which a truly catholic vision of the church crumbles, and out of which secularism thrives. 3 Presbyterian theologian Peter Leithart goes so far as to claim that the unified and catholic trajectory of Jesus' vision in the Bible thus \"bids Protestantism to come and die.\" 4 1 William"
