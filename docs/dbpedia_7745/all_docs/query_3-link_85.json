        "text": "The recent observance of the 502nd anniversary of the Protestant Reformation should once again prompt us to reflect on the unity of God’s church amidst so many divisions. Christians everywhere can point to Jesus’ high priestly prayer recorded in John’s gospel: “that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you” (John 17:21), yet wonder why this cannot be a present reality. It’s not just that churches are organizationally distinct but that they do not enjoy full communion with each other, erecting barriers preventing their members from recognizing outsiders as brothers and sisters in Christ.\n\nOf course, some church bodies deny that God’s church is divided at all. The Roman Catholic Church claims to be the one holy catholic and apostolic church founded by Jesus nearly 2,000 years ago. Other communions are officially in schism from this one true church, and their members constitute at most separated brethren in imperfect communion with Rome. The Orthodox Churches, while organizationally more pluriform, return the favour, claiming that Rome, along with every other ecclesiastical body, is outside the one true church, embodied in global Orthodoxy.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead more\n\nIn Luke’s Gospel, just after Jesus calls the disciples to deny themselves, take up their crosses, and follow him, Jesus leads three of his disciples up a high mountain to see him transfigured. This little exercise was not merely so that Jesus could somehow show off before his disciples. The disciples’ presence is crucial, especially after being told what it means to follow him. Jesus wants to give them a taste of what is coming for them as they continue to follow him. A foretaste of Jesus’ coming glory on that mountain is just as much for the disciples as it is for Jesus. The cross of which Jesus just told them is not the end for Jesus or for the disciples. The cross is the necessary path to glory, but the cross is not the end of the story.\n\nIn his fear, Peter doesn’t seem to remember what Jesus told them about eight days before concerning the cross. He wants to stay there on top of the mountain. This can’t be done. Glory is coming, but it will not be a cross-less glory. Jesus will lead the way through the death of the cross to glorious transfiguration in resurrection. All those who follow him will follow the same path in one way or another.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead more\n\nIt has to be Kuyper’s fault. I have been pondering his words ever since 2003. Someone gave me a copy of his Lectures on Calvinism and it hit me with electrifying power. Now, mind you, I was already versed in Rushdoony, North, Van Til, Bahnsen, and Sproul, but Kuyper was from the past; an ancient past. At least that’s how I viewed him as a novice in Church History. And what is it that brought me to my theological knees when I first read him? It was his non-exhausting claim of the exhaustive Lordship of King Jesus. Here are five propositions that makes him such a superb apologist for the kingdom of Jesus:\n\na) Kuyper was Trinitarian. In his Pro Rege: Living Under Christ’s Kingship (Volume 1), he notes that “There can be no separation or contrast between the authority of God and the authority of Christ.” For Kuyper, the dominion power is not inherent in fallen humanity but comes from the divine power of the Son who creates all things. Kuyper does not separate the power of the Son from the Father, but he harmonizes the Triune work. As the Catechism states, “…and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.” Kuyper operates from beginning to end as a Trinitarian Christian. Dominion can only occur in a Trinitarian universe and the Father and the Son work together to ensure it.\n\nb) Kuyper believed in the fulfillment of the Great Commission. Though Kuyper did not use the theological categories of Postmillennialism in his writings, his vision harmonizes quite well with that of his fellow theologian B.B. Warfield who invited Kuyper for the Princeton lectures in 1898. Kuyper notes in profoundly optimistic categories:\n\nChristianity [is] being carried forth into the world, coming into contact with the elements and laws of human life and through that contact modifying and changing life entirely.\n\nJesus’ Commission was not a mere hope, but the promise that the nations would fall under Christ’s authority. Everything Christianity touches, Kuyper notes, changes for the good.\n\n(more…)\n\nThe other quotations come from the same source (back)\n\nRead more\n\nDear friend,\n\nI am a better pastor than John Piper, John MacArthur, Tim Keller and any other pastor of renown. No, I am not as rhetorically gifted, nor am I widely published, nor will I ever draw the crowds, but for you, specifically, the members of my congregation, I am the best pastor you will have. I will go further and say that your local pastor, whoever he may be, is also a better pastor than all the men I mentioned above. They are uniquely called men to shepherd you, to hear your stories, to know your individual names, to baptize your children, marry your daughters, bury your fathers; yes, these men are better pastors than the prestigious men above.\n\nYou can go ahead and gain from their insights, listen to their sermons and lectures, read their books, but at the end of the day, only one man (or a couple of them) will be at the hospital when your son has a concussion or breaks his leg, or when your aging mother has a heart attack, or when the unexpected comes.\n\nFriends, don’t lose sight of your local reality and community. Encourage your pastor to continue the hard work of ministering, bearing burdens, exhorting, comforting, and more. Don’t believe the lie that you can do church alone with these celebrities or that you don’t need a local body or that theology is a job best done in isolation or that your local pastor is only a fill-in or an add-on to the real pastors. You belong to a local body. And that weak and sometimes unsophisticated and sometimes clumsy, and sometimes corny, but always faithful man is a better pastor for you than all those super names combined.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA local pastor\n\nRead more\n\nAugustine’s book Confessions is a wonderful reflection on the sovereignty of God and the evangelical nature of the gospel. That is to say, in reading in the Confessions, you are steeped in the reality that God will judge every moment of your life. Augustine underlines and highlights this reality throughout the book by writing it as one long prayer to God.\n\nOne time I was talking with a friend about the book and he commented that he kept getting caught on the pronoun “you”. He would be reading along and then Augustine would say “you” and my friend said that pronoun would reorient everything: the book is not addressed to the reader but to God. This is true throughout the whole book even up to the end where Augustine writes, “Only you can be asked, only you can be begged, only on your door can we knock” (Bk XIII.38).\n\nAs I reflect on the nature of prayer and what Augustine is doing in this book, I am challenged in a couple of ways. First, do I have such a robust prayer life that I could pray to God like Augustine? Augustine prays about everything imaginable. Big things and small things: he prays about smiling as an infant, being beaten at school, dreams, friendships, reading, death, philosophy, memory, etc. Augustine’s prayer life is his whole life. I don’t know when I have ever heard someone pray about the nature of time. But Augustine does it.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead more\n\nAbraham Kuyper’s most concise work is entitled Lectures on Calvinism which were lectures delivered at Princeton in 1898. Little did Kuyper know just how much these lectures would shape Calvinist thought to this very day. Kuyperian Commentary decided to dedicate the month of October to Abraham Kuyper and his famous work. Our very own Jesse Sumpter took on the task to summarize the chapters of this work by providing the central features of each section and adding his own observations. The end result is six fine articles focusing on Kuyper’s views on Science, Sphere Sovereignty, Election, Culture, and more.\n\nThis is a great interview to send to a friend who you think would benefit from a synopsis of the work of this Reformed giant.\n\nYou can find Jesse’s articles here.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Mask and the Person\n\nOur English word for “person” comes from the Latin word “Persona” or the Greek equivalent πρόσωπα (prosopon). This Greek version of person should conjure in the mind of the reader the idea of ancient Greek theaters and the various “masks” they would use to express emotions and communicate identity. Today phrases like “be my own person” reveal that we share this Hellenistic inclination to use person as an expression of who we are as an individual. Or perhaps, like the Greek actors, we use masks to contrive an identity as to alter how we are seen by others.\n\nThe Greek theatre modeled itself after the Greek god Dionysus. Dionysus is famous for his bodily transformations and for appearing to mortals as a variety of creatures, as a male or female, and as the patron of wine and various ceremonial meals. Professor Thanos Vovolis of the American University of Greece describes a connection between the mask and the Dionysus. “This contradictory, polymorphous, paradoxical god [Dionysus], was most often depicted as a mask.”\n\n(more…)\n\nA word also worthy of study for its Christological implications in the work of Theodore of Mopsuestia.

In what seems to be a common occurrence, the men are sleeping while Jesus is praying. They awaken to find Jesus transfigured, radiating glory in his face and clothes, and Moses and Elijah speaking to him about the exodus he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem (Lk 9.31). Peter, speaking for the other two, suggests that they should erect three tabernacles for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah.\n\nPeter’s response was wrong, but it wasn’t wrong in the way that many people think. Peter was working out a Scriptural theology of glory and applying it to what he saw at the moment. When glory appears, you build a house for it. This was true for the Tabernacle, the Temple, and was involved in the Feast of Booths every year. Peter wasn’t wrong to want to house glory. He was wrong in his timing.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead more\n\nThis is the sixth part of a six part article series on Abraham Kuyper’s Lectures on Calvinism. He gave these lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary over a series of days in October 1898. Happy International Abraham Kuyper Month!\n\nHere is an overview of Kuyper’s other lectures on Calvinism: Life-system, Religion, Politics, Science, and Art.\n\nIn this final lecture, Kuyper begins by summarizing his past lectures with these words: “[Calvinism] raised our Christian religion to its highest spiritual splendor; it created a church order, which became the preformation of state confederation; it proved to be the guardian angel of science; it emancipated art; it propagated a political scheme, which gave birth to constitutional government, both in Europe and America; it fostered agriculture and industry, commerce and navigation; it put a thorough Christian stamp upon home-life and family-ties; it promoted through its high moral standard purity in our social circles; and to this manifold effect it placed beneath Church and State, beneath society and home-circle, a fundamental philosophic conception strictly derived from its dominating principle, and therefore all its own” (p 171).\n\nKuyper then moves on to look at his current time and suggests where Calvinism can help in shaping and building for the future. He suggests that the topic of his final lecture is “A new Calvinistic development needed by the wants of the future” (p 171).\n\n(more…)\n\nRead more"
