        "text": "Workshop Description\n\n2020 marked 100 years since the death of the great Dutch philosopher, theologian, and statesman Abraham Kuyper. To commemorate Kuyper’s contribution, The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion is hosting an academic workshop online entitled ‘Abraham Kuyper, Science, and Philosophy: A Centenary Celebration’.\n\nSpeakers\n\nPlenary Speaker: Professor Richard Mouw (Fuller Seminary) – Kuyper, Science, and Kinds of Explanation\n\nProfessor René van Woudenberg (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) – Kuyper on the relation between science and religion\n\nProfessor Gerrit Glas (VU Amsterdam) – Sphere sovereignty and the idea of normative (professional) practices\n\nProfessor Lydia Jaeger (Nogent Bible Institute) – Human freedom between scientific determinism and liberty of creation\n\nDr Jordan Ballor (The Acton Institute, VU Amsterdam) – ‘A theater of God’s grace and glory’: Kuyper and the Reformed Tradition on Natural Philosophy, Theology, and Science\n\nRevd Dr Craig Bartholomew (Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics, Cambridge)\n\nDr Deborah Haarsma (President, BioLogos) – Kuyper on Evolution, Then and Now\n\nConference Papers [Downloadable pdf]\n\nThursday 2nd September\n\n15:00 René van Woudenberg – Kuyper on the relation between science and religion\n\n17:00 Lydia Jaeger – Human freedom between scientific determinism and liberty of creation\n\n19:30 Jordan Ballor – ‘A theater of God’s grace and glory’: Kuyper and the Reformed Tradition on Natural Philosophy, Theology, and Science\n\nFriday 3rd September\n\n15:00 Gerrit Glas – Sphere sovereignty and the idea of normative (professional) practices\n\n17:00 Alden McCray – Theological Scientia and Epistemological Principia: Abraham Kuyper and John Calvin on the Principles of Theological Knowledge\n\n17:35 Timothy Jones – The World Will Not be Lost\n\n19:30 Richard Mouw – Kuyper, Science, and Kinds of Explanation\n\nSaturday 4th September\n\n15:00 Craig Bartholomew – Kuyper, the doctrine of creation, and science\n\n17:00 James Eglinton – Kuyper on Evolutionary Linguistics\n\n18:30 Deborah Haarsma – Kuyper on Evolution, Then and Now\n\nAll sessions will be opened 15 minutes before start time.\n\nCall for Papers\n\nWe welcome abstracts for papers that discuss Abraham Kuyper’s views on the intersections between philosophy, theology, and science.\n\nTopics might include Kuyper’s notion of the Reformed worldview’s contribution to modern science, Kuyper’s attitude toward the tradition of natural philosophy/natural theology, Kuyper’s account of creation and the image of God, his notion of ‘Platonic dualism’, or other aspects of his thought. But we also view the Kuyperian tradition as a living (and contested) framework for philosophy, theology, and science. So we welcome constructive papers which develop some Kuyperian themes in conversation with a contemporary scientific discipline or scientific issue.\n\nFinally, we encourage papers which provide more critical perspectives on the Kuyperian tradition. Papers should be written for presentation in about 20 minutes. Applicants should register and apply here (DO NOT register on this main registration site if submitting an abstract).\n\n———-\n\nCost: Free\n\nRegistration is now closed for this event. If you have any further questions please don’t hesitate to contact events@faraday.cam.ac.uk.\n\nConference Organisers: Prof. René van Woudenberg, Dr Jon Thompson\n\nHosted and Organised by: The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion\n\nevents@faraday.cam.ac.uk\n\nFacebook.com/Kuyperworkshop\n\nThe organisers gratefully acknowledge generous funding from The John Templeton Foundation, VU Amsterdam, and The Acton Institute."
