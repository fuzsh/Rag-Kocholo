        "text": "From Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920), Our Worship (Onze Eredienst), p. 6-7\n\n“In a genuine church…the gathering of believers” originates in “a historical past that goes back all the way to Pentecost in Jerusalem. Such a church is rooted in a past of eighteen centuries, in which a temporary minister serves for only a set number of years to accomplish his holy service, and then that same service continues under the ministry of his successor. That means that it is not the minister who created the church, but that the church existed long before him. He was born in the church, he served in it, and therefore had to honor the traditions that developed within the church over the centuries.”\n\nKuyper is reacting to the “free-reining spirit” common today (yes, even back in c. 1900) where a minister starts his own church, gets some followers and goes from there. Kuyper said that such a conglomeration is “nothing other than a circle gathering around a talented speaker”. Kuyper’s response is classic: the minister is a very tiny part of a much greater thing. He does not have the liberty to do what he wants with the church. He’s an important servant in some sense, but he must remember that the church existed before him and will be there long after his tongue no longer speaks. He’s a tool in the hands of Christ, used for a time to build something much more significant than himself: the body of Christ. “The church has authority over the minister and not the minister over the church”.\n\nThe minister serves Christ and his church – not the other way around."
