        "text": "It is now rightly taken for granted that the Christian faith is to be professed in a post-Christendom context. The public sphere in Western democracies has become one which is a mix of the secular, the Christian, the post-Christian, multicultural and multifaith. With respect to Western civilisation Jurgen Habermas describes the present as being one which is post-secular and must now acknowledge the power of religion in the public sphere1: that religious reference for him is no longer necessarily Christian. How can it be with the rise of Islam, in particular, in his own immediate context of Europe? In a similar vein, writing on the Australian Soul Gary Bouma refers to the eclipse of the secularisation hypothesis which imagined all religions would gradually disappear and to its replacement with the resurgence of spirituality.\n\nThe theology of Dutch pastor and politician Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) is presently experiencing something of a renaissance among English-speaking evangelicals. Such an embrace of his thought by those of disparate ecclesiological traditions, however, would come as quite a surprise to Kuyper himself. While outside of the Netherlands Kuyper is known for his notions of Christian cultural responsibility and transformation, for the Dutch his ecclesiology stands as his most important legacy. Indeed, one cannot easily extricate Kuyper’s work of church reform from his public theology, for the latter emerged from the former at key points in his career. If this is the case, that Kuyper the churchman cannot be separated from Kuyper the cultural transformationist, it leads one to wonder if Kuyper is as helpful to evangelicals outside the Reformed tradition as initially thought. This is especially so for credobaptists, whose ecclesiological differences with the Reformed tradition could not be starker, especially regarding infant baptism and a believers-only church. Upon closer inspection of Kuyper’s ecclesiology as it developed across his career, however, his thought appears surprisingly friendly to those of Baptist convictions. This essay contends that Kuyper’s developing ecclesiology, formulated in response to various ecclesiastical and political debates, bears a certain arc, the trajectory of which serves to situate him in territory which Baptists could find quite amiable to their own ecclesiology. Three phases from Kuyper’s career are examined, with an eye towards his work of reform to see churches freed from state control and composed of believers only. This trajectory maps well onto Baptist hallmarks of soul competency and regenerate church membership, leading to the conclusion that a Kuyperian inheritance for Baptist public theology need not set aside questions of the nature of the church and its relation to society. Baptists may find in Abraham Kuyper an unexpectedly friendly resource."
