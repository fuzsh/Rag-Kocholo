        "meta_description": "Among historians there is little disagreement about the significance of Dutch theologian and statesman Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920), but discussions about Kuyper have centered mostly on his worldview, with little said about his context and personal life. Jan de Bruijn's beautiful pictorial biography fills a gap in offering a full-fledged portrait of this remarkable, visionary, polemical, complex character.\n\nNearly four hundred full-color illustrations with extended explanatory captions make up the book. Readers will see political cartoons, family photos, posters, pictures of important places in Kuyper's life. Even Kuyper enthusiasts are sure to find something new here! Never before has there been a book available in English that illustrates Kuyper's life to such a great extent.",
