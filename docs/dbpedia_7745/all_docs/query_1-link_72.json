This was certainly true for Kuyper, he not only preached it, he lived it.\nKuyper has been described as a renaissance man, and this renaissance man is certainly undergoing a renaissance. This reader, a collection of articles written on the life, work, and legacy of Kuyper, provides evidence that work on Kuyper and Kuyperianism is alive and well. This book provides and introduction to Kuyper's life and thought through the eyes of others. The breadth and scope of these articles all stand as testimony to Kuyper's desire to see the lordship of Christ extended to every area of life.",
