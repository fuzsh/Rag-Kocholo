        "text": "How should Christians turn towards modern politics? What are their obligations in contemporary public life? Which Christian values should be endorsed in the framework of modern democracy? And which political instruments are permitted to attain them? Obviously, in the past centuries, several Christian philosophers, theologians, and politicians wished to provide answers to these crucial questions. The present series of articles intends to renew the interest in these authors facilitated by two main factors. First, we believe that these authors receive less attention than they deserve. We do not doubt the richness of academic literature on them (since most of them attract serious research interest), but we argue that there is a lack of discussion on their ideas in the public sphere. Second, we believe that if someone wishes to find answers to the questions raised above should be able to research acknowledged theologians and philosophers who are immersed in the wisdom of Christian faith and who based their political arguments on those insights. Consequently, a few political insights from “theologians” of modern politics will be presented with a special focus on the Christian source of their thought. We hope that these short introductions will increase the public interest in these inspirational figures.\n\nKuyper believed that Calvinism was so comprehensive that it was easily comparable with other life systems and worldviews, such as Paganism, “Romanism”, Buddhism and Modernism. He believed that Calvinism was not just on the same level, but—in several aspects—it provided better answers to crucial religious, scientific, or political questions and dilemmas. Concerning his era and the future, probably the greatest clash or antithesis he envisioned, and in which he played an apologetic role, was between Calvinism (or more broadly Christianity) and Modernism. But when did Modernism occur? Why is it corrupted? And why does it pose a serious threat to Christianity?\n\nSimilarly to many other Christian or conservative scholars, Kuyper treated 1789 as a turning point in history #2. Even though he opposed rapid, inorganic changes and his movement was called anti-revolutionary, Kuyper’s primal concern was not the revolutionary nature of the French events. If it was God’s intention to overthrow the tyranny of the Bourbons and to judge those who abused their powers on the nation by the means of a revolution, it might have been a fruitful circumstance – he writes. The problem was more the “anti-Christianity” of the Revolution: ‘Voltaire’s mad cry, “Down with the scoundrel”, was aimed at Christ himself (…) The fanatic outcry of another philosopher, “We no more need a God,” and the odious shibboleth, “No God, no Master,” of the Convention; – these were the sacrilegious watchwords which at that time heralded the liberation of man as an emancipation from all Divine Authority.’#3 For the leaders of the French revolutions, God was mediated through the Romish Church, and in the attempt to get rid of the Church they also declared war against God and every religious confession – argues Kuyper.\n\nIt is also conspicuous how Kuyper repeatedly highlights the religious nature of Modernism which is an all-encompassing worldview that has its picture of God#4, the world and humans. In the latest case, the difference between Christian and Modern ideas could not be greater. Kuyper claimed that not uniformity but endless multiformity is among individuals. Man and woman, just like physical and spiritual gifts/talent and social positions highly differ. Still, it does not lead to the dominion of individuals over individuals in Calvinism since everyone is created in God’s likeness, and before God everyone, as a creature of God, and as a lost sinner, is equal. In short#5, this leads to the Calvinistic acknowledgment of the democratic framework which paves the way to personal and communal liberties. In this context, everyone has the possibility to move towards God in his ways and this plurality should not be endangered by the state or by the majority of the people. Kuyper argues that Modernism is, on the other hand, ‘denies and abolishes every difference, cannot rest until it has made woman man and man woman, and, putting every distinction on a common level, kills life by placing it under the ban of uniformity. One type must answer for all, one uniform, one position and one and the same development of life; and whatever goes beyond and above it, is looked upon as an insult to the common consciousness.’#6"
