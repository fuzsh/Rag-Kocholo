Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) was a Dutch Reformed theologian and politician who founded the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Free University. He emphasized that Jesus is Lord over all areas of life and developed the concept of sphere sovereignty. Kuyper served as Prime Minister from 1901-1905 and was influential in establishing neo-Calvinism, which views all of life as being redeemed under God's authority. His writings established principles like common grace and the antithesis between believers and unbelievers that shaped Reformed theology.
