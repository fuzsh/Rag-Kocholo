The Subhumans are a punk band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that formed in 1978.

Known by pejorative, punk rock nicknames, original members were known simply as "Useless" (Gerry Hannah), "Dimwit" (Ken Montgomery), "Wimpy" (Brian Roy Goble) and "Normal" (Mike Graham).

History

Dimwit quit the band shortly after their first 7" was released and was replaced by Koichi Imagawa, also known as Jim Imagawa, on drums.

In 1981, Hannah left the band and gradually became involved with a small group of underground activists calling themselves "Direct Action". In the alternative media they were referred to as the "Vancouver 5", but in the mainstream press they were dubbed the "Squamish 5". The group, composed of ecologists and feminists, were responsible for a number of actions, including the 14 October 1982 bombing of the Litton Industries plant in Ontario which made guidance systems for cruise missiles. The Litton bombing hurt several plant workers and a police officer was also injured. While Gerry was not part of the Litton bombing, he supported it, and did take part in other actions, as well as planning to rob a Brinks truck to fund future actions. He was arrested on 23 January 1983, along with the four other members of Direct Action. Many benefits were arranged for the group by people such as Jello Biafra and Joey Shithead of D.O.A. to pay lawyers fees but, in the end, Hannah pled guilty to avoid years in prison. He received a 10 year sentence and was released after serving 5 years. During his time in prison, he began writing a column for the fanzine Maximum RocknRoll which helped maintain his connection to the punk scene. A number of years after his release he was the subject of a documentary film made by B.C. filmmaker Glen Sanford, called "Useless".

After Hannah left the band, the Subhumans re-formed with Ron Allan on bass. After Imagawa left the band, Randy Bowman joined in his place. With the line up of Wimpy Roy, Mike Graham, Ron Allan, and Randy Bowman, the Subhumans recorded the album 'No Wishes, No Prayers' for Black Flag's SST Records. Ron Allan and Randy Bowman later went on to form the premier Vancouver band The Scramblers.

The Subhumans finally broke up, with the singer joining D.O.A. on bass. However, their songs have been covered by many other bands, including D.O.A., NoMeansNo, MDC, Jingo de Lunch and Vancouver all-women band Cub, and they are highly regarded within the punk community.

In 2005 the Subhumans reunited with the following lineup: Gerry Hannah on bass, Jon Card (ex of Personality Crisis (band), SNFU and D.O.A.) on drums, Wimpy Roy on vocals and Mike Graham on guitar. They signed to Alternative Tentacles and G7 Welcoming Committee Records. A new album, "New Dark Age Parade", was released in September 2006. The Subhumans also plan to re-release their earlier recorded material, which is no longer available.
