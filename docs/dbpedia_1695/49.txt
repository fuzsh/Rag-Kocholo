This page is about the UK punk rock band. For information about their Canadian namesakes see The Subhumans (Canadian band).

The Subhumans are an anarcho-punk band formed in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, UK in 1979 by Dick Lucas, who had formerly been in local bands including The Mental and Stupid Humans.

The band released a demo in 1981 which was heard by members of the band Flux of Pink Indians, who were so impressed that they offered the Subhumans a chance to put out a record on their newly formed Spiderleg label. Shortly afterwards the Subhumans began to release material on their own Bluurg Records label.

After the Subhumans split up Lucas formed the bands Culture Shock and Citizen Fish. The Subhumans occasionally reform for live performances, including at least two major tours of North America in the 21st Century, (Live in a Dive is a product of the first) and they continue to command a strong cult following.
