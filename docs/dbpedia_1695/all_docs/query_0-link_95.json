This thread will likely make you rage.\n\nI've seen commies on Holla Forums say that white people commit more overall crime. They don't understand or see the world like we do, user. If statistics are beyond them or they go heaven and beyond to deny their legitimacy, then all I can say is that they have to be baptised by fire. They never have a come back when you try to tell them to go live in Detroit and see how much niggers sympathize with class rather than race. The approach to get to them has to be different. Also for future reference, many older infographics are not sourced/sources have been removed. That needs attention. This is a problem because leftists like to nitpick things like that and it ruins efficiency. Not like they read them anyway, but it's best not to give them an argument.\n\nYes, those graphics are what helped to inspire me to create my infographics. I wanted more detail and to focus on a case, by case basis.\n\n0255\n\n—————-\n\nJanuary 8, 2015\n\nVictim(s): Stephanie Michele Waters 21\n\nAttacker(s): Deauntay Dontaz Moye 16, Ryan James Hardwick 15\n\nDescription: Stephanie’s boyfriend Benjamin (white) sent her to handle the drug deal he had setup with Moye & Hardwick. Stephanie drove to meet with the two who, after examining the $250 worth of marijuana for sale, robbed her, with Moye shooting Stephanie in the neck, then the head, before Hardwick shot her dog Duke.

A couple of thoughts.\n\n1) A mega link where one could get the whole set in one click - this would make it much easier to disseminate them. If you can do this, I'll see if I have any luck reformatting them as I mention below.\n\n2) If they were formatted 1800x1200 they would be the perfect dimensions to print at 300 dpi on post cards. 3300x2550 would be ideal for posters. It would be possible then for anons to print them and anonymously mail them to targets around the country - say, perhaps, everyone living in a particular zip code. This is a great way to bring the reality of diversity right into the faces of rich white liberals, who will look at these pictures and see their son or daughter. I also have some ideas for how to get bulk printing done, but don't want to promise anything. To my knowledge, it would be legal to send these through the mail. They also look quite good in greyscale if one wants to cut down on printing costs.\n\n3) If anyone else goes with the post cards, on the obverse they need a catchy slogan. I like: \"End White Silence - Stop Black Violence\". Ideally, a website can be set up with a bunch of redpills available.\n\nEither way, you've done incredible work here.\n\nI might eventually do different sizes, but I'm sticking with 1024X768 for the time being. Thanks for the heads up on sizing. The way I'll be printing out the ones I post, is with a used inkjet printer from a local thrift store.\n\nAnother distribution method I was thinking of, was to print these out and slip them into newspapers so they'll fall out when it's unrolled, then deliver them to white neighborhoods.\n\nThank you for your praise and your input concerning my work. My images have gotten better thanks to various people making suggestions.\n\n0364\n\n—————-\n\nMay 4, 2015\n\nVictim(s): Charles Ferrell 51\n\nAttacker(s): Marshall Harris\n\nDescription: Harris, a cocaine addict and convicted felon, beat Charles to death with an old-style (CRT) television, a glass jug, and also stomped on his chest. He bragged to others about what he had done.\n\nArchive.is Link(s):\n\nweb.archive.org /web /20170811170054 /https: / /patch.com /florida /clearwater /man-bragged-killing-another-cops-say-0 Harris is arrested. He bragged to others about what he done\n\n—————-\n\nIf you do black and white printouts, you can tape over the yellow print head to block the dots as well. Be sure the printer does not have access to your network or any WiFi capabilities.\n\nThe newspapers are a good idea, but unless you were a newspaper roller, it'd be hard to get them into the paper. If you were, you'd be easily traced.\n\nI like postcards because they are highly targetable, easy to do undetectably, and aren't terribly expensive. The other thing I was thinking was to set up a bitcoin address where anons who couldn't do post cards themselves could send enough money to cover the printing and mailing plus a list of addresses. It'd be better to have more people doing it, of course, but anything that can help the scale is a good idea.\n\nI would have started at #500, personally…I always liked that trick the NSDAP used. Not that there won't be enough anyway, but if someone gets 0001 they won't realize the scale of the problem.\n\nI meant those free papers you can access in major cities. Grab a bunch of those.\n\nI thought about using bitcoin in some fashion, but that's still down the road. I honestly feel that the graphics themselves will inspire people to print them out once they go viral.\n\nI prefer to stick to the truth with regards to numbers, as anything that's technically not true, can be used against us/the message. I will be at #500, likely by sometime in September, and then infographic #5XX is backed by 500+ actual previous graphics. I understand the logic behind your approach, but I prefer mine.\n\n0365\n\n—————-\n\nJuly 5, 2015\n\nVictim(s): John David Hester Sr. 68\n\nAttacker(s): Adrian Lyryan Robinson, Brandon Quanterrious “Brad” Wynn, Christian Savion Glover, Derrick Demond Phillips, I-Key Tumazs Pinkins, Ty’Cameron La’Darius Hayes, Tykerious Raheem “Grump” Jones 17\n\nDescription: The group was breaking into homes when they decided to break into the home of John’s son, John Hester Jr., across the road from his own home.

It looks like if you scale them to 1600x1200 you get minimal loss of quality and retain the same original dimensional ratio, but get an image that fits in 5.33x4\" at 300 DPI. I might try to put a bunch together in this format later for convenience. That means you can fit 4 of them on an 8.5x11 sheet with sufficient margins for the printer. They should still be large and clear enough to be readable, and they're in a size that qualifies for the USPS definition of a postcard if they are printed on card stock that is .007\"-.016\" thick. Post cards are not legally required to have a return address and can be sent through any blue mailbox with the proper stamp. Stamps are $0.34 each. 65 lb paper that should meet the USPS specifications is $11 for a pack of 250 sheets, which would yield 1,000 \"postcards.\"\n\nUnfortunately the stamps make the postcard route fairly expensive, I estimate it would be ~$400/1000 postcards sent when you total in stamps, paper, ink, and gas to drive to somewhere a long ways away from your house to drop them off at the mailbox. It is, however, the easiest to target effectively. The people I think these would have the most effect on are the upper middle class cuckservatives. They donate money to \"right wing\" candidates, and so they have the most ability to influence the total shift to the right by funding pro white candidates instead of the neocon trash.\n\nOP, do you have any restrictions on how you want people to use your work? Would it be acceptable to you to have someone solicit donations while mailing these out to help defray the costs?\n\nAlso please if you can upload these in a batch to your favorite upload site.

Frequent name misspellings (victim & attacker) in reports, especially with niggers names being retarded to begin with, can make searches difficult. Find a grave is usual for finding out the victim's full name if one can't get it elsewhere. This can aid searching, as I find news organizations will use multiple versions (e.g.:with and without middle initial/full middle name) of names in its reports.

I thought about this today. What if I make a series of drawing and paintings of each white person killed by a black person this year? I love doing portraits and I could probably finish one every day or two if I stay focused. I would present the series as \"Racial Crime in America\" or something like that, without saying exactly that I'm focusing on white victims specifically. People would look, since racial things are a hot topic now, and see all of the victims the media glossed over. If anyone tries to pull the racism card on me and dox me, I won't have a job to get fired from and I'll be moving anyways. I think I could seriously garner attention to this problem in our society and whitepill a bunch of people, as long as I present it in the correct way, which I must figure out. Does this seem like a good idea? One thing I fear is being pegged as \"that racist artist\" and getting blacklisted or something, because once I step out and do this, there's no going back.\n\nIt's a great idea. However IMO, you should pretty much resign yourself to being part of a different group other than artists, as even people who even slightly step out of the groupthink are attacked. You still are an artist of course, but you'll have to carve out your own path. I'm not saying you can't pull it off, but just \"prepare for the worst, hope for the best\".\n\nDo you have any examples? How about taking one of the child victims of my graphics and doing one based on that?

When quoting sources (well I am just talking about the link at the beginning of the video), make sure that you use proper academic format of citation, such as the chicago format. Never post stand alone links as they are always subjected to change. If you can, cite journals that have been written and published. And place more than one source in order to fortify the strength of the argument.\n\nExample.\n\nNIGGA, T \"Dindu Nuffin… Overstating, Deceiving and Overreacting like a Nigger for beginners\" p. Marxism approved books, Print, 1984 pg 69\n\n2. Make sure you introduce the 'Nigger in the hood' picture as a placeholder image, idiot-proofing it, to make it is completely obvious to onlookers that there is no picture available. People will scrutinize even the most trivial of things in order to defend their beliefs that niggers are sweet innocent creatures that are misunderstood.\n\n3. Make sure it is relevant to the here and now, any crimes older than 20 years will be seen as a superfluous approach to bulster the statement, this will really backfire.\n\n4. Remove any crimes that involve Spics/Whites as perps, this again will be scrutinized as a cheap way to bulster the statement. There are PLENTY of crimes commited by 100% pure nigger here, don't dilute it!\n\n5. Maybe highlight the most disgusting cases, knowing how Niggers really have no sense of mercy it will be tempting to highlight 70-80% of the crimes, but keep them low such as murders and rapes of elderly or young children.\n\nAnyway keep up the good work, we need to make a case to everyone that Blacks are the ones at fault and not us.\n\n0105\n\n—————-\n\nNovember 3, 1980\n\nVictim(s): Alfred J Koll (age unknown)\n\nAttacker(s): Prentice Juan Snow\n\nDescription: Prentice Snow was sentenced to death on 08/31/1982 for the murder of Alfred J. Koll. Prentice Juan Snow was resentenced in 1990 in Los Angeles County Superior Court of the first degree murder of Alfred J. Koll. The jury also sustained a special circumstance allegation that Snow intentionally killed Alfred to prevent his testimony in another criminal proceeding.\n\nOn August 27, 1979, two men robbed Alfred of cash at his pharmacy, located at 939 East Walnut Street in Pasadena. Snow and James Phillips were charged with the robbery and with felony assault. At the preliminary examination, Alfred identified Snow as one of the robbers.\n\nOn November 3, 1980, the robbery case was scheduled for trial in a department of the Los Angeles County Superior Court located in the Pasadena courthouse. Alfred had been subpoenaed as a witness and was on call if needed. During the morning session, before court and counsel started to select a jury, the prosecutor, Gerald Haney, and defense counsel, Adolfo Lara, discussed a disposition by plea. Haney offered to drop the assault charge if defendant pled guilty to robbery. According to Haney, Lara left the room to talk to defendant. Snow wanted to wait until after the lunch break to think it over. During the lunch break Snow, dressed in a motorcycle helmet and denim jacket, walked a short distance from the courthouse to Alfred's Pharmacy and shot him to death.\n\nArchive.is Link(s):\n\narchive.is /CTITr Death sentence upheld.\n\narchive.is /VMPCz Crime & Punishment thread.\n\narchive.is /G1kb8 Case history – Still appealing.\n\narchive.is /FcXL0 More death penalty info.\n\narchive.fo /28Vq8 More details about the initial robbery and the murder of Alfred.\n\n—————-\n\nI finally got his picture.

Hog-tied, her face was wrapped in a plastic bag, and was placed in a large trash can, where she slowly suffocated to death.\n\nAccording to news reports, Christian and Newsom had gone on a date at a local restaurant on Saturday, January 6, 2007, but did not return home. During their night out, the couple were carjacked, bound and blindfolded by three males, and \"taken back to Lemaricus Devall 'Slim' Davidson's rented house on Chipman Street.\"[6]\n\nChristian's parents found her abandoned Toyota 4-Runner two blocks away from the Chipman Street house the following Monday with the help of her mobile phone provider.

Barefoot, he was either led or dragged outside the house to a set of nearby railroad tracks. He was shot in the back of the head, the neck, and the back, and his body then set on fire.\n\nChannon's death came only after hours of sexual torture, medical examiner Mileusnic-Polchan testified. Channon suffered horrific injuries to her vagina, anus and mouth. She was not only raped but savaged with \"an object,\" possibly a broken chair leg, the doctor testified. She was beaten in the head. Some type of chemical was poured down her throat, and her body, including her bleeding and battered genital area, likely scrubbed with the same solution - all while Channon was alive, the forensic expert said. She was then \"hog-tied,\" with curtains and strips of bedding, her face covered tightly with a small trash bag and her body stashed inside five large trash bags before being placed inside a large trash can and covered with sheets.

In 1857, he published a book which he dedicated to the \"nonslaveholding whites\" of the South.\n\nen.wikipedia.org /wiki /Hinton_Rowan_Helper\n\n\"The common food of the natives of Ansiko (former Bantu tribe) is men's flesh,\n\ninsomuch that their markets are provided with that, as ours in\n\nEurope with beef or mutton : all prisoners of war, unless they can\n\nsell them alive with greater advantage, otherwise, as we said,\n\nthey fatten them for slaughter, and at last sell them to the butchers.\n\nTo this savage barbarity they are so naturalized, that some slaves,\n\nwhether as weary of their lives, or to show their love to their\n\nmasters, will proffer themselves freely to be killed and eaten.\n\nBut that which is most inhuman, and beyond the ferocity of beasts,\n\nis, that the father scruples not to eat his son, nor the son his father,\n\nnor one brother the other, but take them by force, devouring their\n\nflesh, the blood yet reeking hot between their teeth.\" Ogilby's\n\nAfrica, page 518. \"\n\n“Before they sit down to eat meat in company, the Kaffirs are very careful to immerse their hands in fresh cow-dung, wiping them on the grass, which is considered the perfection of cleanliness. Except an occasional plunge in a river, they never wash themselves, and consequently their bodies are covered with vermin.” — Steedman’s Africa, Vol. I, page 265\n\nHinton Helper was a famous prewar Southern Abolitionist and CRITIC of slavery and secession whose first book, The Impending Crisis of the South, was popularized by the Republican Party (anti Slavery Party). Africa opened his eyes.\n\nTo think, if we never had the niggers picking cotton they would have been eaten alive by their fellow niggers, as should be. Anyone have a time machine? We need to make sure slavery never happens and niggers get what they deserve.\n\n0603\n\n—————-\n\nJune 6, 2017\n\nVictim(s): Kera Laneigh Teel 19, Kyndal Jae Teel, Mindy Morris (survived)\n\nAttacker(s): Jared Javon Bias, Atayanna Asia Nicole Douglas 17\n\nDescription: Kera, a mother who was 7 months pregnant with her second child, had pulled into the parking lot of the apartment complex she lived in, when she and her mother Mindy noticed a car driving back and forth near the exit.
