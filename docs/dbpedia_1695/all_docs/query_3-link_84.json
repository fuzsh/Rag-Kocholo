It’s Huck Finn and crew rafting down the Mississippi. Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland puttin’ on a play. It’s teenage boys hunkering down in a suburban garage, strumming elec­ tric guitars over the grease spot left from Dad’s Mustang. David Byrne’s garage band was called the Revelation, and they covered the Rolling Stones and Beatles. Drummer Chris Frantz’s high school band was named the Hustlers. They played the Stones and Beatles as well. The Walkers was Jerry Harrison’s first band. He played keyboards. His band only covered the Stones. Tina Weymouth was never in a garage band. Chicks didn’t do that in the 1960s. Tina did what girls did—sat cross-legged on her bed with a wooden guitar in her lap strumming Joan Baez. But after a year, she gave it up when, as she put it, she “discovered boys.” Years later, Chris and David taught Tina how to play bass guitar. It was in New York that these kids formed Talking Heads, a group that was completely of its time and totally outside of it. Talking Heads was a product of Art School America circa 1970. Painting was dead, so why not form a band? Talking Heads began as New Wave art rockers who understood soul music. They were accepted and thrived in the Bowery punk scene, although they were total outsiders. No torn T-shirts or black leather for them. They dressed prep-school casual. Little alligators over their hearts. The band’s leader, David, was about as sexy as Norman Bates. The doe-eyed Tina played her huge bass with the fearful look of a blond Joan of Arc about\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nto be burned at the stake. Talking Heads seemed too odd and original to ever be signed to a record company. One night in the early days, Chris overheard two music critics talking in the men’s room of a club: “Whaddaya think? You think the Talking Heads are gonna get signed?” “I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I think they’re just a downtown thing.” “Yeah. No one outside of New York City is gonna get it or even want it.”\n\n2\n\nNot so fast, gentlemen. Talking Heads was signed, of course. Their first effort, Talking Heads ’77, was a perfect platter of pristine electric min­ imalism produced by a disco carpetbagger. Its standout track was the lyrical musing of a serial killer sung partially in French. Then the band hooked up with the Svengali of avant-garde pop, Brian Eno, and released the absurdly titled More Songs About Buildings and Food. Against cultural logic, this album contained their first bona fide hit, a cover of Al Green’s “Take Me to the River.” Talking Heads’ third album, Fear of Music, forever etched the psyche of underground Manhattan into the national vocabulary with Byrne’s declaration, “This ain’t the Mudd Club, or CBGB. . . .” On three perfect albums, the band had pushed artiness to the brink before fulfilling Dylan’s example of pop metamorphosis by adding five new members and becoming an integrated psychedelic funk troupe. Talking Heads’ monster hit “Burning Down the House” was inspired from a chant heard at a Funkadelic concert. Their extraordinary pair of funk albums, Remain in Light and Speaking in Tongues, weren’t just another example of whitey ripping off the ’hood. They were the products of delighted anthropol­ ogists that transcend global pop. The band began charting back in the days of MTV’s conception. Talking Heads made use of their art-school credentials to shoot surreal state-of-the­ art eye candy that blatantly mocked the lip-sync clichés of the new genre of music video. Talking Heads didn’t stop with conquering video. They borrowed from New York avant-garde theater and toured an elaborate rock ’n’ roll per­ formance piece that documented their progress from funky art music to art­ ful funk. The show climaxed with David Byrne dancing onstage wearing a monstrous white business suit, singing, “Who took the money? Who took the money away?” A celebrated Hollywood director filmed the show and created the best rock on celluloid since A Hard Day’s Night.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThen the band changed direction yet again and recorded a “simple” pop album of Americana called Little Creatures. Although Talking Heads was satisfying the Beatlesque tenet that a band change directions several times in its career, Little Creatures was not the way musical evolution was supposed to work. It was as if the Fab Four had recorded Revolver first, then Help! David Byrne once said, “I think Talking Heads can be as popular as the Carpenters.” Before his band completed rock mythology by breaking up acrimoniously, they were indeed almost as big as Karen and Richard. This band that should never have been understood outside of New York City was a hit in Ohio and New Brunswick. They got them in Hollywood. They got them in Sheboygan. The Brits got Talking Heads. So did the Krauts and Danes. The last live Talking Heads performance happened on a New Zealand stage with Maoris in the audience. Facts don’t do what I want them to. David Byrne and Brian Eno Talking Heads starts with David Byrne. What I can tell you about meeting the man is that he doesn’t just look like himself, he looks like a movie star. He’s handsome enough to carry a picture. Interestingly though, it wasn’t until the early eighties that Byrne became photogenic. In those first publicity shots he appears hollow-eyed and stricken—an American Artaud. A few years later, in photographs by Richard Avedon and Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe, Byrne has come into himself as a figure and an artist. He no longer has the face of an animal searching for a home. In person, Byrne is very low key in a paradoxical jittery sort of way—although he is no longer excruciatingly shy like the early days. He’s soft-spoken, but laughs often. And he has this little Scottish speech thing going, leaving the “g” off words endin’ in “ing.” Byrne talks and acts and looks like a big kid who has just stolen something good out of the cookie jar. I once asked him about rock histories: “Should these things be writ­ ten?” David Byrne answered that he hadn’t read any rock histories lately— “But I read quite a few at one point and, yeah, I think they are a good thing. I was wonderin’, ‘How do you do this? How did this person do this? What’s their attitude toward living? How do they make life decisions in this kind of work?’ It’s not like a nine-to-five job. You have to figure it out yourself. They\n\n3\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\ndon’t teach it in school. They get you started with the rudiments, but then you’re on your own. Yeah, I derived tremendous inspiration from reading how other people got through it.” You have everything wrong. Everything in here is wrong. That’s why I said I have to rewrite your book for you. It’s all wrong, David. You know nothing about us. Tina Weymouth 4\n\nTina Weymouth had played the thing for less than a year when the Village Voice called her “the queen of the bass players.” In the early days of Talking Heads, Tina was treated like royalty while the press treated David Byrne like a carny geek. Ex–Velvet Underground member John Cale says Tina was queen because “she had a Jean Seberg thing going,” that short­ haired look of the actress who played Joan of Arc for Otto Preminger. The New Wave tomboy who hawked the Herald Tribune in Godard’s Breathless. Both Jean Seberg and Tina Weymouth seemed adorably feminine because, to paraphrase Seberg’s lover Carlos Fuentes, “To get to those two you had to negotiate the twists and turns of androgyny and homoeroticism.” Month by month, as Talking Heads conquered the small network of Manhattan nightclubs, Tina’s “twists” began to matter less and less. David Byrne overshadowed his bandmate in the pages of the New York Times as well as the Soho News. Talking Heads became his group, not hers. Tina didn’t stay quiet about it. She began what would become a career-long tech­ nique of using the press to send messages to David. She complained about him in newspapers and rock magazines. Cut him down to size. Long after the group finally broke up, Tina continues to rail against Byrne. She once said to me, “I’m going to become a hysterical woman. I’m going to become a hys­ terical woman if you keep me talking about the story of the band.” Tina said this in a Greek coffee shop near Columbus Circle. It was late afternoon in winter. It was already dark. Our table sat in a draft, and the joint was half empty. The vibe was pure 1940s film noir. I could imagine her as a figure in an Edward Hopper painting. She is attractive, but she no longer has her Jean Seberg going. She seemed a little brittle. She had the vibe of a Catholic saint. Or maybe a tragically lame prima ballerina. Or maybe Valerie Solanis, the woman who shot Andy Warhol. Just as the story of the Beatles can be reduced to a tale of the\n\nIntroduction\n\nlove/hate relationship between John and Yoko and Paul, the story of Talking Heads can be reduced to a similar equation between Tina and David. Only Tina is complicated enough to fill the roles of both John and Yoko. “I always lived in the world of imagination,” she told me as she paid for our coffee. Then she said, “I thought that David Byrne was like me.” She paused. “I made a mistake.” According to John Cale, the incredible thing about Talking Heads was no one could figure out what kept them together. A chronicle of the band and their times will provide some answers. As I was writing this book I asked David Byrne, “Does truth matter in rock ’n’ roll?” “No,” he answered. “What’s that quote? ‘Between a truth and a myth, print the myth.’ ”\n\n5\n\nDAVID BOWMAN\n\n6\n\nTalking Heads is composed of four very neat-looking individuals whom any parent would introduce in polite company without a trace of nervousness. When they freak out, it’s in a much more complicated way. Frank Rose\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nmemories can’t wait\n\nBOOK ONE\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n1\n\nthe secret\n\nlife of\n\ntina weymouth In the summer of 1973, Chris Frantz was trimming Tina Weymouth’s hair. They were both art students at Rhode Island School of Design, aka RISD, pronounced RizzDee. They were both in their early twenties. Tina was born in 1950, Chris the next year. Chris Frantz had come into masculine beauty early. He was thin with a Lancelot intensity about him. As he snipped away at Tina’s hair he was so taken with her that his hands trembled. Young men’s hands didn’t usually tremble like this in the early seventies. Certainly drummer’s hands didn’t shake around chicks. Chris was a rock ’n’ roll drummer who had shared an art studio with Tina for more than a year. But he had a girlfriend and Tina had a beau. When their respective college flings crashed in winter, Chris and Tina decided to start dating. Now Chris’s hand was shaking. “You know. I feel like we could be married,” he said. “You know,” Tina answered. “So do I.” Tina believed from that moment on that she “was already a mar­ ried woman in the eyes of God.” We could consider the story of Talking Heads as their private love story. That’s one way to look at it.\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nTina was born Martina Michèle Weymouth on November 22, 1950, in Coronado, California. Coronado is part of San Diego, a navy town. Her father, Ralph Weymouth, was a navy lifer who would eventually become an admiral. Tina’s mother was French. Tina had a nine-year-old brother, Yann, and a seven-year-old sister, Nanu. Both had been born in Santa Barbara during World War II. Two years after Tina’s birth, sister Danielle was born. Ralph Weymouth then moved his family to Hawaii where Tina was schooled by Hawaiian nuns. Her parents gave her two more sisters, Lani and Letita—Hawaiian names. Then Tina’s father moved his family again. He was stationed in France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Washington, D.C. Tina was taught by French, Belgian, and Swiss nuns. During this time, she was given yet another sister, Laura, in 1957. Three years later, a second brother, Lawrence.\n\n10\n\nTina’s first mention in the New York Times occurred on November 29, 1964, in the wedding announcements section. Her brother Yann had married Elizabeth Morris “Lally” Graham, the Radcliffe-educated daughter of the Washington Post’s Katherine Graham, on the previous afternoon at the Naval Chapel in Washington, D.C. A photo of Mr. and Mrs. Yann R. Weymouth after their marriage appeared next to the story. The bride gave a toothy Gloria Vanderbilt stage smile while her taller husband stood beside her with a stunned and equally goofy look. Holy cow. What have I done? The paper didn’t mention that the marriage “was horribly rash.” Those would be the bride’s words twenty years later. The paper did report that Martina and her younger sister Danielle were junior bridesmaids. They wore similar gowns as well as wreaths of small peach chrysanthemums, and they carried bouquets to match. Tina’s two other younger sisters were flower girls. The paper mistakenly called Tina’s father a captain, but he was actually a rear admiral assigned to the Pentagon. The paper didn’t mention the bride’s father—newspaperman Phil Graham, publisher of the Washington Post. The year before, he had shot himself dead. The last note Phil Graham sent his daughter read, “I’ll keep trying and before long I’ll be doing better.” The January after Lally and Yann’s wedding, Tina’s father was sent to Iceland. It was there in frigid Keflavík that Tina pushed the boundary of vice. She had always been taught that marriage was holy and “prolonged\n\nT h e S e c r e t L i f e o f T i n a We y m o u t h\n\nkissing” was a mortal sin. After Tina made out with a boy in the Icelandic mountains, she was consumed by guilt. Thankfully her father moved the family yet again to Los Angeles. She tried to forget her Icelandic sin by becoming the captain of the high school cheerleading squad. “It was so unreal,” she would tell a reporter. “But this didn’t make me any happier. I still always felt really left out and different. I would try to sneak into Whiskey-A-Go-Go because that was one place you could get in if you were underage. I’d see Paul Revere and the Raiders jumping in the swimming pool at Marineland and I felt they had such extraordinary, exciting lives. The radio was playing really good songs. When I was sixteen one of the big hits was ‘Love Is All Around’ by the Troggs.” Love was all around. Tina’s parents would arrange dates for her with the sons of other military officers. When Tina was seventeen, she was escorted to Whiskey-A-Go-Go by a general’s nineteen-year-old son. This was the summer of ’68, and gunsmoke still hung over the L.A. shooting of Robert Kennedy. “Not wishing to look as weird as I felt,” Tina recollected, “I wore the uniform of a California girl on a date: a bright pink A-line jer­ sey knit mini dress with chunky white patent leather high-heeled sandals.” The general’s son wore wheat jeans and a madras button-down shirt. The two drank soda, danced to top-forty songs. This was Tina’s first nightclub. It was no big deal. “The experience was novel and yet thoroughly banal. I thought, ‘So what’s the big deal, why do adults like this?’ ” On the drive home, the boy mentioned that Vatican II had just banned the use of contraceptives. He asked if a “good Catholic” girl like Tina would ever consider having an abortion. Tina turned red. “Embarrassingly, I had to ask my date what was meant exactly by ‘abortion’ and ‘contraceptives,’ because these things were never defined for us by the innocent little nuns at my school. I was not prepared for a sexual confronta­ tion with a nineteen-year-old boy, let alone a moral confrontation with Mother Church. I was still feeling pretty guilty about those ‘prolonged kisses’ I had enjoyed two years earlier in Keflavík. As it was, I sensed that my igno­ rance struck my date as perhaps rather ‘uncool,’ but my innocence seemed to turn him on, a truly weird double standard.” If this seems rather weighty for a girl in the mid-sixties with the Summer of Love just around the bend, keep in mind that Tina always saw herself as a nun inside her own interior. “I was very, very shy,” she said. “That was because we moved all\n\n11\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n12\n\nthe time. I had my own inner world. Have you ever read Frank O’Conner’s ‘The Ugly Duckling’? It’s a story about a girl who becomes a nun. He describes so beautifully what happened to her. She became a raving beauty sometime in her teens and had a lot of suitors. And the narrator moved to Dublin because of her and became a writer in order to impress the girl. She ended up dumping him for another guy, and in his pain and everything the narrator just forgets about her. Years later he found that she had gone into a nunnery. So he went and talked to her and eventually real­ ized why she’d done what she’d done. She explained that she had been so long ignored and left to her own devices that she had created her own very, very rich emotional world. When finally the world was offered to her on a silver platter—when finally the boys took notice of her, when finally the boys were nice to her—they didn’t compare. What they had to offer was so shallow it didn’t compare to the inner world she had created in her mind. That’s why she became a nun. She didn’t need that extra baggage. As a nun she could continue in her world.” Rather than sequester herself in a nunnery, Tina got a summer job working for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the naval shipyard in Washington, D.C. Then she went up to Barnard College in New York where she had a double major in French literature and art history. She transferred to Old Dominion University for half a year, went back to Barnard for half a year, then dropped out. These were the 1960s. Previously college had been a privilege. Now it was an expectation that could always be put off if one lost one’s mooring. The chronology of this portion of Tina’s life is confusing to dig up if the sub­ ject stops cooperating with the biographer. I don’t want you to get all personal so I’m not going to answer any more personal questions about my family. Talking Heads is one thing. My personal history is another thing, you know. . . . Tina Weymouth is difficult, but needs no apologist. Gary Kurfirst, Talking Heads’ future manager, explains the woman’s psyche this way: “Tina is very intelligent, and has always had her own way of seeing things. Tina can look at a picture that’s painted red and she’ll tell you that it’s green. But she’s not putting one over on you. Tina sees things. You and I\n\nT h e S e c r e t L i f e o f T i n a We y m o u t h\n\ncould look at something and go, ‘God, look at that dog,’ and she’ll go, ‘It’s a fox.’ And we’ll go, ‘No it’s a dog.’ And she’ll go, ‘No it’s a fox—can’t you see?’ And it’s not that she’s putting one over on you. In Tina’s eyes she saw a fox.” Before Tina clammed up, she talked about staying several months down in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with her sister Nanu and Nanu’s husband. Tina hated Tulsa, there was nothing but “foxes” everywhere. Tulsa was Oral Roberts’s town. Everyone knew Roberts was estranged from his son solely because his progeny grew a beard. Tulsa drove Tina nuts. During her exile from college, Tina’s brother Yann had become an architect while her sister-in-law Lally wrote for the Boston Globe. Then a daughter was born. And another. Then after six years of marriage, Yann and Lally divorced. Lally kept the family name of Weymouth and became an author and newspaper columnist. Soon she began to move in what Tina called the “very rarefied atmosphere” of Manhattan high society. Lally would become a cohort of Jackie Onassis and Truman Capote. The latter wrote that Yann’s ex-wife had a “first-class mind, which she sometimes tries to disguise.” Capote felt that this trait was common to intellectual women “who are very attractive.” According to Tina, Yann flipped out after the breakup. One after­ noon he rode his bicycle into a tree and was knocked into a coma for three days. Tina saw this as his “unconscious” death wish. He soon recovered and did his younger sister a great favor by asking her to come to New York to help him paint his new bachelor apartment. Tina’s shyness flared again when she arrived in New York. She found that she couldn’t bear to talk to the operator in order to make a collect call to her parents. If she got lost on the streets, she wouldn’t ask strangers for directions. “I’d rather wander around lost for hours.” But little by little the edginess of New York cured her. “New York opened me up,” she said later. “In New York, somebody is going to say terrible things to you or not say terrible things to you. It doesn’t matter. You have no choice. You can’t escape it.” Tina left Yann and New York and enrolled at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence in 1970. New York may have indeed skinned the girl of shyness. Apparently Tina showed up at an art orientation meeting stark naked and covered with green paint. This wasn’t unusual RISD behav­ ior in the early 1970s. That said, Tina the nun had decided to become a painter. One fellow student remembers her work as “gray.” She was doing\n\n13\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n14\n\ngray aircraft-carrier paintings. She’d take strips of canvas and paint the whole thing gray. Another student remembers Tina’s studio full of “huge canvases that she’d lay on the floor and do quite a bit of splattering around. Swirls of color. They weren’t Jackson Pollock drips. Tina was using a tremendous amount of paint and smearing it around. She’d keep bending over and splattering all over the place.” Within a year, Tina’s parents retired to Providence, buying a beau­ tiful home up on the hill near Brown University. Two or three of Tina’s younger sisters were living there. Fellow student Jean De Segonzac remem­ bers, “The mother was having some problems with some of the younger girls because of Tina going to college. This meant the younger girls were also hanging out with college kids. I remember Tina’s mother screaming, ‘You can’t see that girl anymore, she’s a lesbian!’ ” An understandable concern for a Catholic mother back in the early 1970s. The Weymouths did not seem overtly Catholic to outsiders, but De Segonzac, himself the son of a French mother, gives this testament: “A French mom is going to take you to church. This is very much a trait of French mothers. Doing what is supposed to be done. Acting the way you’re supposed to act. Very much concerned about what the family would think. My mom dragged us to church every Sunday. She said that it’s better to keep going to church just in case.” Tina’s studio mate, Chris Frantz, painted differently. His work was col­ orful. He could get layers going. You could see through a chunk of color—a yel­ low area with red coming through. Chris’s paintings were hard-edged. They had drips coming down. A little bit like Rothko, but not as soft. They had a rhyth­ mical feeling to them. Which made sense, because Chris was a drummer. He had been born Charlton Christopher Frantz at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He had a high-ranking military pop just like Tina, a general. Chris grew up in the south. Then Pittsburgh. He drew as a kid. In fourth grade, he tried to play trumpet but his embouchure was too big, so the band leader made him switch to trombone. Chris couldn’t blow that either. The band leader gave him some drumsticks and a little pad to beat. It has been said that white people have no sense of rhythm, and this is frequently true. Imagine seeing a band play at Madison Square Garden with the massive audience clapping along to the rhythm of the music. In a white audience, thousands and thousands of people will all clap on the\n\nT h e S e c r e t L i f e o f T i n a We y m o u t h\n\nupbeat, sounding like dull robots. In an audience of people of color, most will clap on the downbeat. This is the beat that syncopation demands. Chris Frantz had the ears to hear this. The boy loved beating his pads. Soon he even got to smack a real drum. After the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan, he got a drum kit. A tomtom. A snare. The bass drum. He even got a charleston cymbal, which you could clank with a foot pedal. Like most of the kids in America post-Beatles­ on-Ed-Sullivan, Chris went out and joined a garage band. He’d also excelled in art class. He found himself winning interscholastic arts festivals around Pittsburgh. One garage band Chris was in, the Beans, took him for an extended gig to the Electric Circus in New York City in the summer of 1970. When the Beans failed to become the next Steppenwolf, Chris returned to the world of art and enrolled at RISD. During Chris’s freshman year, many intellectuals in America declared that painting was dead. Painting was nothing more than decadent picture making for the bourgeoisie. But Chris didn’t care. He loved dabbing paint on his brushes, then smearing it on canvas. He loved painting and loved the drums. Jean De Segonzac remembers seeing a performance piece at school during which Chris sat on the top of a metal cage and provided rhythmic beatings. De Segonzac also remembers hearing that Chris Frantz dropped acid every day. That was probably just a rumor. Witnesses generally remem­ ber Chris as spacy at times. But he was also taciturn. Chris Frantz was a good listener. Mark Kehoe was one of the crazier characters on campus. He and his girl­ friend, Naomi, knew every Italian soap opera star from the dubbed shows they’d watch late at night. Kehoe himself knew Tina and found her abrasive at times. “We used to smoke pot and be miserable. Tina would be talking half in French.” Chris and Tina once served Robitussin cough syrup at a dinner party. Kehoe asked Chris to make some music for a film he’d completed. It was about a guy’s girlfriend getting run over by a car. Chris said, “Oh, sure.” The soundtrack was to be recorded at Tina’s attic room in the garage behind her parents’ house in Providence. If Tina’s French mother was worried about lesbians corrupting her daughters, Tina’s father was reportedly cool and relaxed. The admiral was\n\n15\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nalways happy to see ten kids in the house. He wasn’t square. He wasn’t both­ ered by boys with long hair. Tina’s younger brother was always seen out in the driveway taking cars apart. “Here I’d been living away from home for two to three years,” Tina said. “But to save money, my parents didn’t want me to have an apartment. So they fixed the garage. I ended up spending most of my time at other peo­ ple’s apartments. I did do work in the garage. And we kept Chris’s drums there. He could play without bothering anybody. It was right next to the Brown tennis courts, which always had balls going back and forth.” Tina showed up at the garage to watch the recording of the soundtrack. It was there she first met an intense young man face-to-face. He was a musician like Chris. He played guitar. “I had seen him around and thought, ‘That’s one guy to give a wide berth to,’ ” Tina recalls. The kid’s name was David.\n\n16\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n2\n\nbyrned to a crisp It’s 1973 and David Byrne is twenty-one years old. He has a short Sigmund Freud beard and is playing “Pennies from Heaven” on a violin. A tiny feath­ ered fake bird is attached at the end of his bow. A woman’s high-heel shoe is strapped heel up on his head. The accompanist, Mark Kehoe, squeezes his accordion like the second coming of Myron Floren, Lawrence Welk’s old wind box player. Kehoe’s girlfriend, Naomi, stands at an easel and displays Russian words written on cardboard. The audience is enthusiastic but puz­ zled. Now David lowers his violin and produces a razor from his pocket. He raises it to his chin and begins shaving. If he’d been a real man—say, a real Russian—he’d have used a straight razor. Instead, he uses a Gillette safety razor. Still the boy winces. Someone from the audience hands him a can of Narragansett beer. He splashes the brew on his face and begins hacking away in earnest. Naomi now passes out photocopies of Lenin signed, “Sincerely Yours, Walter Kaputski.” Kehoe grunts over his squeeze box. Blood is running down David’s neck. Lots of blood. Nobody in 1973 has seen anything like this before. “Performance art”—what a strange cultural animal. Not a play. Not a dance. It’s an art form for people who can’t paint. David Byrne was a per­ formance artist like German Fluxus artist Joseph Beuys, whose seminal 1965 piece was titled “How to Explain Painting to a Dead Hare.” For the piece, Beuys wandered through a gallery in Düsseldorf with his head cov­\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n18\n\nered in honey and gold leaf, explaining his art work to a dead hare he cra­ dled in his arms. Byrne’s bleeding was a rougher, cruder affair. His shaving was also distinctly masculine (discounting bearded ladies at freak shows). It was as gender specific as Shigeko Kubota painting pictures with a brush up her vagina. And a safer method of drawing blood than that of Californian Chris Burden, who several years before instructed a pal to shoot him in the arm. Most Americans would have called that homi­ cidal insanity. Burden called it art. He even gave the performance a name: “Shoot.” Performance art was a new animal to the twentieth century. It began in Swiss coffeehouses during World War I, where the renegade art movement Dada was invented. Dadaists with names like Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara and Hans Arp would read nonsense poems composed of words cut randomly from newspapers, while someone beat a drum with a riding crop. Men would pound on tables, then turn and pull down their trousers, mooning the audience. Had anyone thought of it, the Dadaists would have been quite comfortable shaving their beards while playing violins with small birds attached to the bow. As with all performance art, from Dada to Fluxus, the mythology of David’s shave was more important than the details of the actual occurrence. Maybe the shave didn’t quite happen the way it was described. Thirty years later, David himself didn’t remember whether or not he shaved with beer. A member of the audience claimed Kehoe actually played Cole Porter while David shaved. When the incident was later mentioned in Rolling Stone, the performance was said to have taken place at the Mercer Arts Center in Manhattan. But reality isn’t the point in performance art. Who knows what Joseph Beuys really said to the dead hare in his lap. In 1960, Yves Klein, a wild French conceptual artist known for using naked women as paint brushes, did a swan dive onto an empty Parisian street. The only witness appeared to be the photographer who recorded the dive on film. What a won­ drous image that was: Klein’s arms outstretched. His back arched. The empty pavement—looming. Looming. It was a perfect symbol of the arc the 1960s took. Perhaps the twenty-first century really began with Klein’s leap. But the photograph is doctored. The shot is a combination of an empty street and Klein diving onto a trampoline, surrounded by friends. The heart of performance art has always been fraud.\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nDavid Byrne was born on May 14, 1952, in Dumbarton, Scotland, the son of an electrical engineer, Thomas Byrne, and his wife, Emma. They moved to Hamilton, Ontario, around 1956 at the expense of a company that was recruiting engineers and semi-scientists from Europe. Young David chipped his front tooth chasing a girl on the boat coming over to Canada. His sister, Celia, was born in 1957 in the New World. Tina would later say that this was the most traumatic event in David’s life, that David never recovered from not being the only child. After his sister was born, David and his parents would sit at the din­ ner table and eat baby food with Celia. When David was seven or eight, his father moved the family to the American town of Lansdowne, six miles from downtown Baltimore, where he had become an engineer for Westinghouse. Every so often in the middle of warm summer nights, David and his sister would sneak out of their house completely naked and sit on the neighbors’ porches. Sometimes David would cover his sister with postage stamps. The most generous description of the town that David and his sister would haunt is “lower-middle-class.” Most everybody in that town during the 1960s lived near the train tracks. There were no bad or good parts of town. Everything was mostly the same—row houses or two-story industrial build­ ings. David didn’t stay there long. “Lansdowne was on the fringes of subur­ bia—there were woods and farms on one side of us. We had to leave one house there because the new improved I-95 between Baltimore and D.C. was going through . . . right over our house, it turned out. I have a pretty good sec­ ond sense of where the house was when I pass over it now on the highway. After moving out of there, we moved to a home on the main street of the lit­ tle town of Arbutus—one movie theater (25¢), one A&P, a five-and-dime, and, of course, a gas station. We eventually had to leave there, as well. The house and yard were to be the site of a new parking lot. My friends and I got to see our house get compacted into its own cellar. . . . Amazing that it fit.” Baltimore was a place where the 1960s never happened. Screenwriter Bradley Paul gave this historical perspective on his hometown: “Baltimore is not Manhattan! I mean, from the 1820s to the 1940s, Baltimore was actu­ ally quite an urbane, happening place, supposedly a somewhat more Southern version of NYC, with a happening jazz scene. Billie Holiday was born here and cut her teeth with the likes of Duke Ellington and Eubie Blake in West Baltimore. And lots of writers—F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude\n\n19\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n20\n\nStein, and others. Herman Melville mentions the city as a center of sophis­ tication in Moby Dick, but these facts are decades or even a century old. In the sixties and seventies, Baltimore was a charismatic but bleak, depressed town that had long since fallen from glory. Places like Lansdowne had an even more distant notion of culture.” This was the American environment in which David Byrne grew up. Everyone would remember this immigrant kid as a little withdrawn, a little weird. He tried to take after his old man. Byrne senior was an “electronics whiz.” The man allegedly once “fixed a submarine with a coat hanger.” Young Byrne thought science was a “noble calling.” David Byrne was not a brave kid. The first film he saw without his parents was Godzilla. At the beginning of the film, when the monster makes his debut and the ocean starts to bubble, David froze with his hand in his popcorn, suddenly convinced that whatever he was about to see was going to scare him out of his wits. David was a nervous kid but he was also musical. He played violin and accordion. He later took up guitar. Although he was left-handed, he learned to strum with his right. “A teacher, of course, tried to get me to write with my right hand in fifth grade I think,” David Byrne remembered. “I wrote like a real psycho killer for a couple of months before giving up. I didn’t realize when I got my guitar that there might have been options to play it with my left hand. You know, turn it around, seek out a lefty guitar. Those ideas were well outside my field of vision. Maybe this helped me be a stronger rhythm than lead player.” As musical as Byrne was, he was denied a spot on the Arbutus Junior High choir because the choirmaster found him “off-key and with­ drawn.” When he was fifteen, he wrote his first song, “Bald-Headed Woman.” He wore his hair in a Beatles mop top, a style that had taken a year to filter down to suburban America. He formed a garage band called the Revelation. The drummer was the singer, not Byrne. The latter saved his voice for a local coffeehouse near the University of Maryland campus where he strummed and piped out Dylan songs on a ukulele. He knew all ten verses of “Desolation Row.” He also began making cut-up musique concrète experiments with an old reel-to-reel, influenced by the Stockhausen records he checked out from the library as well as John and Yoko’s “Revolution #9” from the White Album. The Vietnam War played itself out as the background of Byrne’s\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nyouth. He went to one of the Nixon inaugurations. As Nixon went by, little D.B. inexplicably held up a banana. In high school, Byrne’s peers consid­ ered him an oddball. He smoked a little pot. He had a girlfriend named Wendy. Her parents didn’t dig David, but they didn’t forbid their daughter to see him either. Young Byrne was flamboyant enough to attempt a run for stu­ dent council president in his senior year. His platform was built around his desire to return the jukebox to the cafeteria. He lost. He performed at the senior talent show singing a corny old song on the ukulele. If there is an instrument that designates Byrne, this is the one. From a young buck to middle age, Byrne would retain a love of this toylike mini-guitar. “I’ve always liked the idea of a portable music-making device,” Byrne said. “A take-anywhere, always-ready instrument. The ukulele has unfortunate associations—Tiny Tim—but if you listen to Smiley Smile and some of the other cool nutty psychedelic Beach Boys tracks, their use of the ukulele is subtle and sweet. It doesn’t have to be campy.” In May 1970, David bought the new Beatles album, Let It Be. The depth of Beatles mythology is so vast that minor aspects are overlooked. We knew all about their major business. How John said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus. How George found the Maharishi. How John found Yoko. But it’s often forgotten that many Americans assumed that 100 percent of every song writ­ ten by Lennon/McCartney was actually written by both John Lennon and Paul McCartney, when it was just a convention they used both for songs they actually collaborated on (“A Day in the Life”) and the numerous ones they wrote individually (“Hey Jude,” Paul; “Come Together,” John; etc.). Publicity photographs several years before, during the time of Sgt. Pepper, showed the Beatles playing brass instruments. Many American suburban­ ites, both children and their parents, assumed that these photographs were for real, that the Beatles were so gifted they actually played all the instru­ ments that were recorded on their psychedelic albums. We hadn’t yet heard of studio musicians. With thirty years’ perspective, David Byrne would say, “The Beatles were the first group where it was assumed that the band mem­ bers were all more or less equal. Wrote and performed their own songs. Had a certain amount of self-determination. It became a very important item— the band as a whole stood for something. Everybody more or less said the same thing—as if the group was on a mission.”\n\n21\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nBack in 1970, these things seemed eternal: Tang. The USSR. The Beatles. On April 10, a Friday, the British papers announced, “Paul has quit the Beatles.” Today bands break up as often as Slavic countries, but in 1970 the Beatles’ split was unthinkable. From that moment on, rock ’n’ roll fol­ lowed this drama: Act 1 Form a band.\n\nAct 2 Take over the world.\n\nAct 3 Break up.\n\nThe possibility of a fourth and final act will haunt this present story—the ghost of a chance that the group would get back together.\n\n22\n\nWhen eighteen-year-old Byrne graduated from high school, he was eligible for the draft—Uncle Sam didn’t care that he was not a citizen. But David Byrne didn’t go to Vietnam. Instead, he donned the white uniform of a Good Humor man and pedaled a little cart around the neighborhood selling ice cream sandwiches to the kids. Byrne claims he was accepted at both MIT and RISD.\n\nScience. Art.\n\nDad’s direction pointed to MIT. Byrne’s heart pointed differently. In\n\nlater years, Byrne quipped that he chose RISD because “the graffiti looked the best.” Gus Van Sant, director of the first “grunge” cinema classic, My Own Private Idaho, met Byrne at RISD. In My Own Private Idaho, the late River Phoenix plays a hustler in Portland, Oregon. Van Sant saw similarities between Portland and Providence. “They were very big in the twenties and thirties. Somewhere in the forties, they fell off. In Providence it was because of the textile industry. The population was bigger in the twenties than it is today. In our society that rarely happens because populations increase not decrease. S. J. Perelman came from there. Spalding Gray. H. P. Lovecraft, too. But I always think of it as a city that imploded. When we were there in the early 1970s, it was probably the bleakest time.” “I knew Providence was weird,” David remembered. “It didn’t feel like a real town. It seemed totally fragmented as a city. The worlds of the uni­ versity and the city were totally separate. A lot of American towns are like that. The center is just completely vacated. They try blaming it on the car\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nand suburbia, but they have cars in Europe and it doesn’t seem to happen.” When David lived there, the Providence River flowed underground like the River Styx. “It was channeled through pipes and tunnels. So you never saw it. There were a couple of spots where you could go and there would be a space between some of the road and you could look down and go, ‘Oh, look. It’s a river. There it is.’ Where did it come from? There was no evidence of it anywhere.” David’s first dorm mate at RISD covered his side of the room with big pic­ tures of Charlie Manson and the devil. “They were beautiful drawings actu­ ally,” David Byrne remembered. “He was tripping a lot of the time he was there, but eventually had to drop out halfway through the year when his junk habit got too serious.” Sometimes you heard rock music blasting out of David’s room, but just as often you’d hear the bell and gongs of Balinese gamelan music. This would prove to be a lifelong love. Called “World Music” today, it was more accurate in David’s era to call it “Library Music.” His interest in offbeat music was first sparked by all those peculiar records he used to check out of the library. He wasn’t interested in global culture. He was just looking for weird sounds. At RISD, David also studied Bauhaus theory and conceptual art. Some say he let his hair grow long. Other say he choose to cut it unfashion­ ably short like John Lennon. He might also have grown a scruffy beard. David soon abandoned painting for statistics. He wanted to develop a Neilsen rating system for visual arts. He also made Xerox art. Took Polaroids. He gave readings of lines from TV quiz shows. “Come on down!” he would shout, echoing Johnny Olson’s familiar cry from The Price Is Right. David dropped out of RISD a year later because, as he claimed, “the students were all rich kids.” During the next few years, David would tell anyone who’d listen about his “working-class” background. He proba­ bly embellished a bit. Although he came from a lower-middle-class back­ ground, his pop was never a union man. Old man Byrne never worked in a factory, drove a truck, or pumped gas. His father and mother were more antisuburban than working-class. David would later admit that he was copping a typical 1960s attitude: The poor are better than anyone else. •\n\n•\n\n•\n\n23\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n24\n\nDavid Byrne left Providence to join ex–high school girlfriend Wendy on a commune in Kentucky called the Flying Frog Farm. Communes have a long tradition in America, from the Amana colonies—a utopian religious com­ munity that flourished twenty miles northwest of Iowa City in the late nine­ teenth century—to Woodstock host Wavy Gravy’s Hog Farm Commune out in Tujunga, California. By the early 1970s, there were perhaps a thousand such American-style kibbutzes across the country. David recollected that this particular commune had no apparent philosophy “except to get away from ‘society’ and smoke as much dope as you wanted.” One could also aspire to “be free and read cool stuff.” David was not a big doper and spent his days reading a vast amount of Fantastic Four comics (someone had a huge collection). He also played saxophone “à la Beefheart . . . noisy amelodic animal-like sounds.” He was expected to do a few farm chores. Milking the cows was fun. He spent a few hard days lifting hay bales onto wagons. Other days he cleaned and sorted tobacco, a task that got him high after a couple of hours. “The nicotine must seep in through the skin,” David hypothesized, finding it “a rather strange euphoric dizzy feeling to associate with work.” He also had to cook now and then—“God, I can’t imagine anything worse than these poor kids having to eat my cook­ ing!” A quickie paperback on Talking Heads published in the 1980s states that David now met commune leader Jim Brown’s brother David. This second David—David Brown—was a science student. They both dug The Fantastic Four. When David Brown returned to Baltimore to continue his research with monkeys, David Byrne followed and crashed with him and tended to the monkeys. The two species took to each other. All the monkeys loved David. David Byrne claims this never happened. But it is such a winsome detail—Byrne among the primates, especially in light of the monkeyshines contained on the last studio Talking Heads album, Naked—that it deserves mention even if it’s legend. During the summer of 1971, men were still being sent to the moon. The Twenty-sixth Amendment was ratified, which would have allowed David, had he been an American citizen, the right to vote. At summer’s end, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird announced that for the most part the Vietnam War was over. David started school again. A new art school, the\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nMaryland Institute, located in Baltimore, the quiet town where Edgar Allan Poe died of drink or possibly rabies. Mark Kehoe was not yet an influence in young David Byrne’s life. He was just a student at the Maryland Institute. David had met Kehoe once or twice at RISD, and he wrote him a letter saying, “I heard you had a huge space. Could I come live with you?” Kehoe wrote back, “Sure.” Kehoe was nineteen. Born in Pittsburgh, raised in Metuchen, New Jersey. His father was an office worker for RCA’s appliance division in Bayonne. The boy was a hippie who had applied to be a conscientious objector. He lucked out and drew a very high lottery number. In those days Kehoe had such a compelling personality that he was the one other kids would phone after their suicide attempts failed. He spent a lot of time in hospital emergency rooms while someone had their stomach pumped. The lad had rented a floor of a house north of North Avenue. It was a bad neighborhood, but a big space. When David showed up that fall, Kehoe discovered that the owner of the house had rented out all the rooms on his floor, so David and Kehoe were stuck in a tiny L-shaped maid’s room. David didn’t have a bed. He built one out of a door, some cinder blocks, and a bedroll. Out back was an alley where packs of wild dogs lived. The newspa­ pers were always saying the dogs had eaten small black children. David and Kehoe fell into the habit of daring each other—“Smoke that cigar we just found on the street.” “Walk on that ledge!” “Pet that dog!” The house was filled with other art students and everything was communal. A group refrigerator. Voting every week on new rules. Kehoe discovered that many residents thought David was retarded. When parents visited they shook their heads behind David’s back. There’s something really wrong with that kid. David was jerky and ungainly. He would get very quiet and then burst out laughing. Kehoe saw the other side of David. He was very smart and particu­ lar and very single-minded. David knew what he wanted to do. He wrote free-form poems about the glory of fame. He could seem edgy because he\n\n25\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nkept to himself, didn’t tell other people what he was doing. David could make the whole house feel uncomfortable. But it was a house full of artists, and everybody knows artists are very insecure people. Neither David nor Kehoe really gave a hoot about the Maryland Institute. They started spending most of the week hitchhiking to and fro to Providence, crashing there with Kehoe’s girlfriend, Naomi. David did stick around Maryland Institute long enough to take a course on realism, the school’s specialty. Kehoe remembered David coming home with a painting of a playing card. Kehoe thought it was “pretty good.” David also experi­ mented with sculpture. One Saturday morning, he baked some bread but for­ got to watch the oven. Seven hours later, the kitchen was filled with smoke, and the bread was baked into a dense nugget the size of a baseball. David brought the burnt object to an art show at the institute and set it among var­ ious small sculptures, along with a white card that said, BREAD, DAVID BYRNE. When the show closed a week later, the curators returned David’s bread in a small box filled with packing paper. Although the two didn’t make much art, they still talked about it constantly. Kehoe loved smoking dope with David because David could real­ ly appreciate it. David revealed to Kehoe that he had the soul of an old California wino crossed with a moonshiner. He taught Kehoe how to brew “balloon juice”: Place Welch’s frozen grape juice in a jug; add yeast and water; seal it with a balloon; when the balloon goes up and down and up a second time, the balloon juice was done. Sweeten with sugar. Drink—but be careful, it ends up being more potent than wine.\n\n26\n\nDavid always had a guitar. He’d strum good jerky versions of Beatles songs as well as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. Kehoe had been forced to play accordion by his mom as a kid. One night David asked, “Why don’t you get it?” Kehoe did. David got out a violin. They decided to learn corny songs like “Pennies from Heaven” and “Dancing on the Ceiling” from Kehoe’s fake book. They formed a duet called Bizadi and played “Pennies from Heaven” on the commons and for people standing in movie lines. They would play in the dark, with candles attached to the bow of David’s violin. The American pursuit of corny taste has been examined by eggheads, although not extensively. Clement Greenberg was the first high­ brow to look at kitsch. In 1938 he wrote, “Kitsch was the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our time.” Tap dancing was kitsch. Hollywood was\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nkitsch. And so was Norman Rockwell. The point of his essay was that kitsch was the only culture available in fascist countries like Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Mother Russia. How was Greenberg to know that at various moments after we won World War II, the avant-garde would embrace kitsch with a vengeance? In 1964 one of the post-Eisenhower era’s most prominent cultural critics, Susan Sontag, would exalt kitsch, calling it “camp.” “Camp asserts that good taste is not simply good taste,” she wrote in her seminal essay “Notes on Camp”—a collection of fifty-eight numbered ruminations on the subject. Number 54 states, “There exists, indeed, a good taste of bad taste.” David Byrne and Mark Kehoe were glorious examples of “a good taste of bad taste,” fiddling and squeezing out “Pennies from Heaven” on the streets of Baltimore. Kehoe got the idea they should play these songs on the street wearing papier-mâché dog heads. “David’s looked like Anubis.” Kehoe remembers his mom shooting eight-millimeter footage of the two boys wearing dog heads and playing “Pennies from Heaven” in his parents’ liv­ ing room up in New Jersey. They also played a high school gig in Baltimore and brought David’s sister along. The black kids in the audience witnessed Bizadi’s camp in dead silence. A James Brown cover band followed. The moment the guitars started to play, knives were pulled and metal chairs started flying. During this time David got a new girlfriend, a chick a little older than him named Joan Lobell—one of those perpetual students with a couple of degrees. Joan was of medium height, with creamy skin and red-blondish hair. She’d been to Europe. She seemed sophisticated. And she had a car. Joan lived in an old mansion in downtown Baltimore. David soon left the room above the Alley of the Dogs and moved in with her. Kehoe moved in as well, taking a vacant room above Joan and David. Gypsies lived in the basement. One night another tenant—a hippie—deliberately burned his worldly possessions in the fireplace. Kehoe and Joan and David awoke to a house filled with smoke, firemen with big rubber coats pounding through their bedroom. Later the gypsies surfaced and began rummaging wildly through everyone’s apartment. One of the things the three loved to do was wander through Bolton Hill at dark. This was the neighborhood surrounding the school. Wild dog\n\n27\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n28\n\npacks did not swarm through Bolton. There were no gypsies. A slum belt extended from Boston to Washington, D.C., but Bolton Hill had remained intact and classy. Ten years later, you’d call the residents of Bolton Hill yuppies. David and Joan and Kehoe liked to walk across the darkened lawns, dodging sprinklers and watching people inside their homes before they’d seal up the windows for the night. “Shhh, don’t laugh!” Joan would scold. “This is normal life.” Joan could afford to admonish the boys. She was familiar with the Bolton Hill lifestyle. She had money in her background—her father was president of the Cavalier Shoe Polish Co. He considered himself the “Shoe Polish King.” Kehoe and David could only compare what they observed in Bolton Hill with the circus that was their own experience. They’d watch a mother unloading sacks of groceries and know that those bottles of Welch’s weren’t for balloon juice. And everyone’s kitchen was so clean. One night back in the old place, Kehoe went down to the communal kitchen and the walls were covered with undulating bugs. He took that as a sign. Soon after, he went back to his parents’ house in New Jersey and cut his hair. He left his locks in a paper bag on the kitchen table. When he woke up in the morning, his parents had placed the bag of hair on the kitchen floor and were dancing around it. You didn’t see anyone’s parents dancing around bags of hair in Bolton Hill. You didn’t see the general chaos of David’s old home either. Kehoe had gone home with David to his folks’ house in Columbia. Very strange. They had two televisions, but little other furniture. In the morning there would be all these televisions and radios blaring. David’s mother yelling, “Get up. Get up.” Mr. and Mrs. Byrne seemed cool enough, but their accents were so thick the boy couldn’t understand a thing they said, except David’s pop’s cry of “Emmah, brrringh me a cop-ah!” Kehoe and David split up in the fall of 1972. Kehoe went to live with Naomi in Providence. David wrote lots of letters to Kehoe. David was a mail freak. When he was a kid he had wanted to be a mailman so he could read everyone’s postcards as he made his delivery rounds. •\n\n•\n\n•\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nAround Thanksgiving, Kehoe got a letter from David posted from California. David and Joan had gone there to meet up with a kid named Michael who was building a pinecone-shaped dome on a parcel of land north of San Francisco. By December, when Kehoe hadn’t heard any more, he thumbed out west himself. There are no official records of young hitchhikers in the 1970s, only personal ones. Psycho killers might inhabit the hills of L.A. and Death Valley, but back then the rest of the country truly seemed like an extension of the Woodstock Nation. Hitchhiking was relatively safe—you were picked up by either Kerouacian working-class folk, older hippies, or hippies who’d gone straight. A boy didn’t need a car or a ticket or even money to travel the breadth of America. Kehoe met up with David at someone’s parents’ house in Sausalito. Joan had become disgusted with the scene and already returned to Baltimore. The house turned out to be a Frank Lloyd Wright building. None of the rooms were square—they were all rhomboid. The mother was all raged up because these kids were crashing in the rhomboid rooms. The family’s black maid was named America. Soon after Kehoe arrived, the mother kicked everyone out of the rhomboid house, but David had a car. He had bought it in New Mexico. It was a two-tone black 1956 DeSoto with a bullet hole by the inspection sticker. David and Kehoe decided to live in the DeSoto and play “Pennies from Heaven” on the streets of San Francisco for spare change. Some days they would make enough silver to get food. Other times the two would only come up with a buck-fifty. This was needed for gas. Those nights the two were forced to survive on the curried popcorn the Hare Krishna gave out. By the early 1970s, the Summer of Love was long dead and buried. Kehoe remembers Haight-Ashbury as a terrifying slum, its streets filled with crazy burned-out speed freaks. The streets were almost as terrifying as David’s driving. “His mind is always in another world,” Kehoe said. “You’d have to sit and really watch.” The two would spend the night in gas station parking lots or places with views. Kehoe would flip for which one would get to stretch out in back and who was stuck up front with the steering wheel. Imagine creeping up to the car and viewing the sleeping boy in the front seat. How far from Scotland David Byrne was. This was the wrong ocean. Californians were the wrong people. Instead of frugal, they were\n\n29\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nindulgent. Instead of honest whiskey, they drank wine. Instead of Macbeth, they had Charlie Manson. The next day, David wised up. He sold his car for $150, and he and Kehoe hitched back east. They leapfrogged rides for three days before one ride reached the outskirts of Baltimore on Christmas Eve. David commanded the driver to pull over. “I have to get out here,” he said. And he did. He hopped out of the car and disappeared in the snow without so much as a wave good-bye to Kehoe. But that was David. And after Kehoe rode farther north to his par­ ents’ house in New Jersey, he crashed for a monstrous eighteen hours. When he woke up, the television was on. Hitchock’s Vertigo was being broadcast. There on the screen was the San Francisco that Kehoe had just left, Jimmy Stewart driving a ghost version of David Byrne’s 1956 DeSoto.\n\n30\n\nDuring the winter of 1973, David returned to Joan Lobell. The two began hanging out with the Fells Point underground film crowd who gathered around John Waters, a twenty-seven-year-old Baltimorian who cultivated a Gomez Adams look. Number 51 of Sontag’s essay “Notes on Camp” acknowledges gay culture’s strong identification with camp. “Not all homosexuals [gay wasn’t in the popular lexicon in 1964] have camp taste. But homosexuals, by and large, constitute the vanguard—and the most articulate audi­ ence—of camp.” Sontag postulates this, but her answer to why is thin: “Camp is a solvent of morality. It neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.” Actually, gay camp serves as a method to both embrace and dismiss the “normal” American culture that exiled gays to begin with. Sontag mentions that these citizens value camp items such as Tiffany lamps, Swan Lake, and the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley. Sontag never envisioned the taste of John Waters, a gay man who did not see swish art in art nouveau, let alone any goddamn Tiffany lamps. Instead he pursued his own vision, which included perhaps the single most grotesque act of the twentieth century—him filming a fat transvestite named Divine scoop­ ing up dog poop and eating it. This was art to Waters. To hell with Susan Sontag’s stereotypes. Waters became a cultural saint to both culturally exiled Americans as well as citizens who never outgrew the devilish joy of playing in their doo-doo. Waters will admit to knowing the contemporary David Byrne, but\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\ndoesn’t remember him from the old days. Baltimore expert Bradley Paul explained Waters: “Everyone claims to have a John Waters story. Even in his early career, he was revered in Baltimore. Most of these tales are probably invented or embellished. I think one reason he’s so popular, besides being a hometown success story, is that he speaks to the many intelligent Baltimorians who have realized that they live in a weird, insulated, perva­ sively idiosyncratic city.” John Waters may not remember David Byrne from other hangers-ons, but David and Joan became closer friends with Edith the Egg Lady, the obese woman Waters had filmed sitting in a crib in her underwear worshiping eggs in 1972’s Pink Flamingos. David and Joan would drive Edith around in Joan’s car. When the Elgin Movie Theater up in Manhattan began showing the film, David phoned Kehoe (who was working again at the Revlon factory in Jersey) and told him, “Joan and I are taking Edith to the Elgin—we’re going to stop by.” Kehoe’s mother had never seen Pink Flamingos, but she assumed Edith was a movie star. Mrs. Kehoe prepared a platter of salami spread out like a deck of cards. Her son reported that when Joan and David appeared with Edith, complete with bad teeth and three hundred pounds’ worth of girth, “My parents took one look and ran upstairs and slammed the bedroom door.” Right after this visit, Kehoe returned to Providence. David followed. Tina Weymouth said that David was clearly Kehoe’s sidekick: “Mark would have these ideas and say, ‘David, why don’t you do this.’ And David would do it. And sometimes David would misunderstand, and it would be cute. When David misunderstood, he misunderstood in a big way.” David moved with Kehoe and Naomi into a five-room apartment on Brown Street, in the Italian section of Providence. It was the top floor of a big house, with huge ungainly rooms and sloping ceilings. The rent was forty bucks a month. With twenty-five years of perspective Tina remarked: “Kehoe and Naomi were the Chris and Tina before Chris and Tina.” Naomi was physically quite different from Tina. She was about five-foot-four. She had big eyes, big lips, looked a lot like Laura Nyro. Kehoe described Naomi as an “earthy outspoken deeply emotional person.” Her mother had been a painter and an opera singer. Before Kehoe had gone to work for\n\n31\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n32\n\nRevlon, Naomi had been a chubby Jewish hippie girl. When Kehoe returned to Providence, she met him at the bus station slimmed down and wearing an animal-print dress and thrift shop high heels, with a blond streak in her hair and heavy makeup. She even had a fake beauty mark. Naomi was still actually enrolled at RISD. She showed Kehoe her new work—portraits of screaming women and depictions of Jackie Onassis in bondage. The first thing Kehoe decided to do was make a super-8 movie with Naomi titled The Private Secrets of Liz Taylor. The two proceeded to joy­ fully embrace kitsch glamour together. Naomi wore rhinestone sunglasses. They both wore black nail polish. Their clothing got wilder and wilder. A store in downtown Providence sold platform shoes really cheap. Kehoe him­ self had eight pairs. They were overjoyed at the revival of leopard-skin fab­ ric. They wore matching leopard-skin coats. Kehoe even wore a leopard-skin pillbox hat. After David’s arrival, the three became photo hounds. There was a photobooth sitting in a corner at the all-night train station in Providence. They’d go down there at three in the morning with wigs and hats and a roll of quarters. The three also took millions of Polaroids. Black and white. The peel-off kind. “Somewhere I did an art photo of David Byrne without his shirt,” Kehoe remembered. “I drew a diagram of male TV stars of the early 1970s, like the guy from Adam-12, on David’s chest.” The three formed a mini–Jayne Mansfield cult. They listened to her rock ’n’ roll album as well as her record reciting Shakespeare. Jayne Mansfield def­ initely fit Susan Sontag’s definition of camp like a glove. In note number 9, Sontag claims the camp relish for androgyny is balanced by a contradictory enjoyment of “exaggerated sexual characteristics.” However, in light of the practitioners of Queer Aesthetics’ late-breaking attempts to claim camp as a solely gay concern, there is an alternate term to consider, cheese. As in the word cheesy. Professors Kevin Dettmar and William Richey wrote, “Cheese is a highly rhetorical embrace of those things that many would consider to be in bad taste.” Thus David, Kehoe, and Naomi were into cheese as much as camp. The big rock ’n’ roll band at RISD was called the Motels—although they can only be called that for convenience. The band changed its name from year to year: Electric Drive Way. Iron Grandmother. Each concert was an elabo­\n\nByrned to a Crisp\n\nrate singular performance. They rehearsed for months. They were accompa­ nied by their own troupe of costumed dancers called the Tampoons. Gus Van Sant remembered the Motels as RISD’s version of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. The first time Mark Kehoe saw the band, the musicians were surrounded by a ring of lava lamps and were play­ ing a song called “She’s an Albino.” “It all looked too good not to be a part of,” Kehoe said. He and Naomi ran up on stage and started dancing alongside the Tampoons. Soon he and David were booked as Bizadi between sets. It was at a Motels concert that David Byrne played violin and shaved while Naomi wore a blue cock­ tail dress. Mary Clarke, one of the Tampoons, remembered, “Yes, yes, yes. There was lots of blood. All running down David’s face. I remember being worried that this person was hurting himself.”\n\n33\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n3\n\ndown normal David had met Chris Frantz two years back during David’s freshman year. After his violin shave in the fall of ’73, the two got reacquainted when they began working on a soundtrack for the Kehoe film about a girlfriend getting run over by a car. Chris was attracted to David’s screwy musical vision and suggested they form a band. Not a performance group like the Motels, but a garagestyle rock ’n’ roll band. David went along with this. Chris scouted up the other musicians, even came up with the group’s obvious art school name, the Artistics. Along with Chris on drums and David on rhythm guitar and vocals, there was a kid named Hank Stahler on bass. Tim Beal honked sax. Another RISD student named David Anderson, who knew Chris from summer trips to Kentucky, played lead. Little is known about Hank. Tim Beal was a film student. According to De Segonzac, “Beal’s flicks were always about naked people.” He had a party trick. He’d jump up and suddenly leap out of his third-story window as if he thought he was Yves Klein. Shocked witnesses inside the apartment would scream and dash to the window, only to see Beal laughing on the fire escape one floor down. David Anderson wasn’t as extravagant. He was a strangely softspoken painter from some backwater in Tennessee. David Byrne was the unofficial band leader. Everyone would just\n\nDown Normal\n\njam and see what came out. David might then make suggestions. The band practiced for two hours a day, real loud. When they finally got gigs, they played real loud at the Pub, the RISD student bar. And Sam’s in downtown Providence. And a few parties. Artistics lore says the band all wore black. David Byrne played a leopard-skin guitar. The band did mainly covers. Al Green’s “Love and Happiness.” Smokey Robinson’s “Tears of a Clown.” The 1910 Fruitgum Company’s “1-2-3 Red Light,” a song whose lyrics were a repetition of “One, two, three red light . . .” It was the kind of lyric that David could appreciate, because he was very interested in a peculiar philosophy called cybernetics. An egghead named Norbert Wiener coined that word in his 1947 book, Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. Cybernetics is a mind game that believes that all human structures can be more or less delineated as a series of mathematical functions. When this book was translated into French in 1948, Parisian newspapers used the term cerveaux mécaniques—“mechanical brains”—to describe cybernet­ ics. This resulted in the average Frenchman concluding that Wiener was writing about robots (HAL hadn’t been imagined yet). This misconception filtered back to America, where it morphed into bionic—the turning of peo­ ple into mechanical men. David Byrne didn’t make the French mistake. He was familiar with Wiener’s book. “I thought cybernetics made beautiful and intelligent insight about how the mind and perception and social organizations work,” he said. The linguistic branch of cybernetics was interested in the statistical possibilities of meaningful sentences being constructed at random, com­ pared to pure gibberish. Although Norbert Wiener would never admit this, he was a brother to the Dadaists who created poems of words cut randomly from the Zurich Times. Many of the songs David was writing seemed cyber­ netic—such as “Warning Sign,” a song that resembles a random rewriting of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Bad Moon Rising.” In David’s song, he alerts us that a warning sign is coming, although he doesn’t tell us what form this sign will take. Neither does he inform us what exactly this sign will warn us about. Instead, he mentions his hair. He moves it around a lot. He likes its design. Perhaps his hair is in fact the warning sign. David later said this was the most decadent song he had ever written. He imagined a Fellini­ esque swarm of naked people all overdosing on drugs. Indeed, in the song the singer looks at his girl and she has glassy eyes and her mouth is gaping.\n\n35\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n36\n\nThe song’s most memorable lyrics would prove to be David’s decla­ ration, “I’ve got money now/I’ve got money now.” Perhaps the warning sign will occur when someone takes his money away? A week after the Artistics’ first gig, David was in despair because he didn’t have money now. Gus Van Sant sat over lunch with the sad sack in a restaurant where David was a dishwasher. The two were “pretty good friends” according to Van Sant, but this was the first time David had ever opened up to him, muttering dramat­ ically, “Something’s got to happen. Something’s got to break. Or I’m just going to kill myself.” David was in despair because he wasn’t making any money from the Artistics. Van Sant was silent for a moment. He felt sorry for the guy. Van Sant was under the impression that David Byrne wasn’t an actual RISD stu­ dent because his parents couldn’t afford tuition. Van Sant tried to say some­ thing hopeful. “Maybe the pain of not getting paid will add to your art.” David looked up, “No, no, no—that’s sick! That’s not how it works!” He was fervent that the myth of suffering for art was a cultural lie. Van Sant didn’t defend his position. “I felt bad for Byrne,” Van Sant recalled. “While he was complaining about his band, I was being consoling, but at the same time I was thinking, ‘His singing is way off. His guitar playing is weird. If I ever met anyone on the planet who isn’t going to make it, it is this guy.’ ” After David spilled his guts to Van Sant, he realized how tired he was of washing dishes. He saw that he needed “that degree.” David tried to get back into RISD. He showed admissions his conceptual art questionnaire projects—his “Do you believe in UFOs?” polls (Choose one: Definitely False/Probably False/Probably True/Definitely True), his collection of “objec­ tive” accounts of car accidents. The admissions department was outwardly sympathetic, but basically said, “We don’t teach this kind of stuff. You should move to New York and make a go of it.” New York was definitely Oz. David wasn’t ready for the tornado to take him there, so he did the next best thing. He began working at New York Systems, a Smith Hill hot dog joint modeled on forties/fifties New York nos­ talgia. The climax of the New York Systems eating experience involved the wiener boy delivering hot dogs balanced on his bare arms to your table. David was stuck as a grillman. His arms were too hairy to deliver hot dogs. During the winter of 1974, David didn’t have time for Bizadi, but he invited Kehoe and Naomi to perform in between sets for the Artistics at an art show\n\nDown Normal\n\nhe was organizing at RISD’s Woods-Gerry Gallery. The show would be full of nude Polaroid collages as well as Naomi’s portrait of Jackie O. in bondage. Cocktails would be served. Kehoe and Naomi would show up wearing gorilla suits and sing “My Baby Must Be a Magician.” But the school canceled the show. Not because Jackie was in bondage, but because David wasn’t a student. Just as things were going to hell at RISD, things were starting to go to hell all over. There was a terrible gasoline shortage. Kehoe remembers driving with David to Boston to return the gorilla suits, then getting stranded there because Beantown had no gas. The two spent the day sitting in gas lines. Every time they finally got up to the pumps, the gas jockey would shake his head. “Sorry. No more.” David kept writing songs. A lot of them. In the beginning of 1974, he wrote what would prove to be his signature song, “Psycho Killer,” a song that could serve as an underground national anthem for the America that has always produced the world’s most compelling amateur killers. Charles Manson. Richard Speck. Leatherface. David Byrne’s voicing of America’s passion for homicide was inspired by a twenty-four-year-old girl named Barbara Conway, one of the Tampoons dancers. Fellow Tampoon Mary Clarke called Conway a cross between Nancy Sinatra and Tina Turner. Barbara took the stage name Simone Cuc. She had a facile tongue when it came to language, inventing dozens of pet terms. “Down normal,” she would say. “In the Twinkie zone.” She called cool people and situations “psycho killer.” For example, “Rosemary Woods is real psycho killer.” Or she’d shorten the two words to PK, as in “Rose is real pee-kay.” In a bit of American irony worthy of any Dadaist performance art, Barbara Conway would herself be shot by a psycho killer—a female stalker—in 1985. Around Thanksgiving ’73, David heard Barbara say “psycho killer” for the zillionth time and finally thought, “There’s a song here.” He tried to write a tune that could have fit on Alice Cooper’s Billion Dollar Babies, which was all over the radio. David also tried to duplicate the dark sophistication of Randy Newman, maybe even the more populist wit of the Kinks’ Ray Davies. As David begins singing, his killer addresses the listener directly, revealing that he is in denial (“I can’t seem to face up to the facts”), that\n\n37\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nhe’s wired, an insomniac. In case we miss the point, the killer announces, “Don’t touch me I’m a real live wire.” Then the psycho killer begins speak­ ing French, “Psycho killer, qu’est-ce que c’est?” Paul McCartney speaks French in “Michelle” to give the song a fake sophistication. One version of history says David’s psycho speaks in French because the maniac imagines himself as very refined. Another because of his split personality. A third story says David originally wanted the guy to speak Greek, but was convinced that French was a more suitable language for someone who was disturbed. Chris told David, “Hey, Tina speaks French. She’ll help with the lyrics.” Tina remembers visiting David at his apartment to work on the song. His room was the proverbial pigsty, clothes strewn everywhere—including a corset and a pair of white shiny Nancy Sinatra vinyl boots. “Whose are those?” Tina asked.\n\nDavid answered, “Mine.”\n\n“Oh, really,” Tina said. “Prove it to me. Okay?”\n\n“Okay,” David said. “Don’t look.”\n\nThe boy went behind a wall. He took off his clothes and put on the\n\ncorset and boots. “You never knew what to expect with David,” Tina said later.\n\n38\n\nTina never seriously questioned David’s sexuality. The corset was Kehoe’s kitsch influence. She had once seen David at a party with peroxide hair, wearing a red chiffon dress with high heels. Tina remarked, “To me, back then, David was kind of fun.” Tina contributed more than French to the song. Both she and Chris were Otis Redding freaks. Redding was a Stax recording artist best known for his ’68 hit, “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay.” Two years before he released a single called “Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song).” It’s a relaxed song. Otis tells us that he keeps singing sad songs. They’re all he knows. But this particular sad song is a sweet song as well. Anyone can sing it. Fa-FaFa-Fa-Fa. The story goes that after Chris and Tina played it for David, he incorporated a string of fas in his psycho killer song. He sang that short syl­ lable fa—a simple exhalation of breath, with upper teeth pressed against\n\nDown Normal\n\nlower lip, ten times: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Otis Redding may or may not have been an influence, but there is a problem of pronunciation. The real influence of the fas in “Psycho Killer” probably came from the Kinks’ song “David Watts,” which begins with Ray Davies singing: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa David would pronounce his fa the same as Davies. This slight one-symbol word has a maddening mystery connected to it. When the song was released in 1977, the printed lyrics appeared with only six fas. But on the actual record, as well as in concert, Byrne sang ten fas. Bootlegs reveal that David Byrne experimented constantly with the rhythm of his fas in the early days. A few times he sang seven fas. Other times he did a kind of speeded-up string of them, sputtering his fas like Porky Pig’s famous line, “Tha-tha-tha-that’s all folks.” But he never sang six fas. The mystery may never be explained. David first sang “Psycho Killer” at RISD’s St. Valentine’s Day Masquerade Ball in 1974. I’ve got money now. The band was paid $200. He would end up playing this song at almost every concert he did from then on. The song became David’s personal hurl toward glory. It is less a Warren Zevonish “Werewolves of London” novelty number and more a Macbethian reflection on deranged violence. Splatter-film fans should note that the narrator doesn’t actually mention shooting or choking or going chop chop chop to anyone. The fellow’s only misanthropic remark is “I hate peo­ ple when they’re not polite.” John Douglas, the FBI agent who invented the art of profiling serial killers as well as being the man Thomas (Silence of the Lambs) Harris based his fictional profiler on, was both impressed and made nervous by David’s take on psychosis, from the killer speaking in French to his aversion to rude­ ness. “Is that what Byrne really thinks?” Douglas said. “He could be walk­ ing the line. How is Byrne normally? Could he find himself in the position\n\n39\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nwhere he could whack somebody?” Of course it’s ridiculous for Douglas to make such assumptions based on a few song lyrics, but the story of Talking Heads is similar to any American history—be it artistic, political, or financial. Everything in the land is occasionally touched by blood. Murder is the American way.\n\n40\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n4\n\nfind yourself a city to live in By spring 1974 the Artistics had acquired a new nickname—the Autistics. Rumor had it that David Anderson was autistic. At least Tina Weymouth assumed he was. But then, she assumed David Byrne was autistic, too. Tina says, “Watch out for the autism. It might be something much more complex. Psychics say he just has a firewall around him. He’s only going to show you what he wants. He’s not someone you can have a perception about.” David Byrne only remembered that David Anderson was “pretty mentally disconnected . . . as was I to a lesser degree.” Mark Kehoe has a conclusive word on the subject of autism. Neither of the Davids were autistic. David Anderson was “an interesting character.” Strange, soft-spoken, almost to the point of being a nerd. One night he went out and walked up Angel Street and across Thayer Street and Waterman Street completely naked. “What do you think you’re doing?” a police officer shouted. Anderson stood there naked and said, “I’m a RISD student.” The cop rolled his eyes. “Then you better get back to your dorm.” Tim Beal did something only slightly less outrageous. He got real stoned one night and did his leap-out-the-window trick. Except he missed the fire escape. He was suspended in the air like Yves Klein, then fell three\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\n42\n\nstories to the pavement and broke both his arms. The saxophonist was laid up in a hospital for three or four months. But it wasn’t just the Autistics/Artistics who were strange. Mark Kehoe would occasionally stand on a street corner screaming at traffic lights. He would stand at the door of the cafeteria and try on everyone’s clothes as they went in for lunch. He would put on people’s hats and dance. Gus Van Sant thought Kehoe was “like an insane person you would see on the street.” Kehoe eventually calmed down. Whenever Van Sant asked him about his behavior, Kehoe would say, “I was going through an experiment.” Then there was the twenty-seven-year-old RISD video artist Jamie Dalglish. He was older than the other students. He was a Vietnam vet. Rumor had it that Dalglish went nuts inside a submarine. Jean De Segonzac found Dalglish pretty flipped. “Jamie would do things like stand on his head and everything would fall out of his pockets.” Jamie Dalglish made videos. One of his videos consisted of a con­ tinuous shot of him walking back and forth on a beach until his feet dug a trench in the sand. Dalglish went to RISD on the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of the Veterans Administration. “I served in the navy from 1967 to ’69,” Dalglish explained. “I was on a diesel submarine. We’d listen to Janis Joplin on the submarine. When you’re in a submarine fifty-five days underwater, a lot of shit happens. And you’re suppose to take it all. Our mission at the time was secret. If we were blown up or taken prisoner, the U.S. wouldn’t have acknowledged us. We had to go into Chinese waters. We had to study the movements of the Khmer Rouge. I didn’t want to get behind a gun and shoot people. We were headed back to Japan. We hit a typhoon. The engine room was really messed up. When we got back to the port, I was ordered to clean up the engine room. I didn’t want to go down and clean. ‘They’ were trying to frame me. So I went and threw a fit. The captain of the boat took me to the naval hospital in Japan. I spent my time next to another guy on a cot who claimed he had seventy-seven ears in a seabag. He kept reassigning to Vietnam so he could shoot people. He claimed you got a prize if you cut an ear off. I had a collection of submarine letters that my mother gave to Dennis Hopper for Christmas. Then video took the place of writing for me.” Near the end of the school year, Dalglish found a 1,200-square­ foot loft in Manhattan, on Bond Street, for $225 a month. There was talk about David going to New York with him. Graduation had broken up his\n\nF i n d Yo u r s e l f a C i t y t o L i v e I n\n\nband. He got into a car with Dalglish and they drove to New York for the summer of 1974. Just as Tina Weymouth’s brother had given her room and board in New York in exchange for painting his floors, Dalglish let David live with him for as long as it took to sand the floors and paint the walls and build a loft bed. Et cetera, et cetera. In New York City terms, Dalglish now pos­ sessed raw space. There was still raw space in Manhattan to be had. Girls dug Dalglish because he was tall and wore a big cowboy hat and had just come to Providence from Colorado. Mark Kehoe said that Dalglish looked like Clint Eastwood. Tina Weymouth disagreed. “Jamie didn’t look like Clint Eastwood. Jamie was very tall and lanky and good look­ ing.” She paused. “All those Dalglish boys are.” Gus Van Sant said, “Jamie was a pretty-looking guy. He looked like a young William Hurt.” Dalglish not only did videos, but he also painted. He had a wife at RISD who did ceramics and was referred to as “Mrs. Jamie.” Her name was Nancy. People remembered her as very tall. And very, very uncomfortable with people. The last thing that Dalglish did in Providence before he left for New York was to divorce Mrs. Jamie. David Byrne heard all of Dalglish’s stories, but he didn’t tell his. David rarely talked. The two would smoke a little dope, then Dalglish would yack. He’d talk about the submarine. He’d talk about art. Dalglish told David that when Matisse visited New York in the autumn of 1930, the Frenchman loved Gotham’s light because it reminded him of home, as New York was located on the same meridian as Nice. David could have cared less about Matisse or the light in New York. Painting was dead—all those mediocre works of abstraction, accom­ panied by a great deal of tedious terminology. Performance art was the art that was real. Dalglish called it all “conceptual art” and said, “Conceptual art is only as good as its ideas. And ideas are found in newspapers. Then they’re thrown away.” Dalglish believed it was the painter who truly revealed his soul. Whatever David revealed through his artistic hijinks, Dalglish cer­ tainly didn’t think it was the kid’s soul. Of course, Dalglish’s perceptions have to be taken with a little bit of salt because during this time he was taking var­ ious psychopharmacological remedies to stave off submarine craziness. It was difficult to tell who was the bigger kook. One afternoon Dalglish opened the door to his loft and found David lying on his back on\n\n43\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nthe floor with a radiator on his chest as if it had fallen from the floor above. Was this a joke? Or performance art? Dalglish would play cards with David and find aces stuck everywhere. Was this conceptual art or conceptual cheating? After Dalglish’s girlfriend, Susan, moved to the city from Providence, Dalglish came home and found David plucking her eyebrows and carefully arranging each strand in a row on a napkin in a perfect replica of the arch of her brow. This could have been art. But if it was, how could you sell it? David later said that during this time he considered himself an artist, but he knew that he wasn’t doing the kind of work he could bring into a gallery on a slide.\n\n44\n\nJamie’s new girl, Susan, was a Providence townie. She was a lot of fun. Susan got drunk at parties and did a striptease. Susan had a very deep voice because of cigarettes. Dalglish planned for her to move in proper when he and Byrne finished fixing up the loft. Later he’d marry Susan and start selling paintings. In those days, Dalglish painted rather undistin­ guished abstracts. But they got better. It was still abstract, but now the swirls of colors were divvied up into grids or panels. He titled his work quaintly—The All-American Pumpkin Patch was a long painting of green­ ish stripes augmented by abstract strips of de Kooning–like chaos done with acrylic and gold powder. Dr. Lee Salk would buy Dalglish’s work one day. So would Armand Hammer. But back in 1974, Dalglish spent most of his energy on his ideas about video as a replacement for language. At year’s end, Dalglish would undertake a massive seven-and-a-half-hour video consisting of more talking than images. It would be composed of fif­ teen static shots of fifteen different people sitting in a chair listening to David Byrne. David was talking—jabbering actually—performing a stream-of­ consciousness dialogue off camera. Tina said, “The tape was David spout­ ing off what other people thought. Memorizing anecdotes and advertisements from TV. Things that he’d heard other people say. David Byrne has this pho­ tographic memory. He’s like this idiot savant. He just hears what you say and boom, before you know it—‘I wrote this!’ We once had to stop him from using a T. S. Eliot line from The Wasteland. David didn’t even know it was T. S. Eliot. It was something he saw. Then he regurgitated it. ‘I wrote this!’ That’s how he is. He doesn’t understand because he didn’t go to college. He doesn’t realize the seriousness of the crime, which is academic fraud.”\n\nF i n d Yo u r s e l f a C i t y t o L i v e I n\n\nAcademic fraud? “David is like Jerzy Kosinski—but at least he paid the ghost writers and stuff. The translators. He wrote the stories.” The point of Dalglish’s video wasn’t what David said, but the body language of the listeners. Dalglish also made this video for revenge. Byrne wouldn’t talk? Well, Jamie Dalglish would make that tight-lipped son of a bitch talk for seven-and-a-half fucking hours. To Dalglish, the silent David had become insufferable. Like Andy Warhol. Dalglish felt both David and Warhol were enigmas without a sphinx. Warhol had become more than a cultural reference point to Dalglish. The wigged artist was an unseen presence in the building on the next block uptown. He owned a building on Great Jones Street, although he no longer lived there. One warm summer night in 1974, Dalglish and David came across a box of old Life magazines that had Warhol’s address label on them. Yes. Andy Warhol subscribed to Life. Didn’t this seem so American? So suburban? David and Dalglish flipped through them as the traffic sped by on the Bowery. In 1974 the street’s citizens were for the most part old black winos with TB, and even older white ones. The Bowery itself resembled the main street of a Midwestern town. The average building was just four stories tall, and traffic moved both up and downtown—unlike most other avenues in Manhattan, which are one-way. The year before, novelist Don DeLillo’s fic­ tional rock ’n’ roll star Bucky Wunderlick fled what he called “the tropics of fame” and holed up in an apartment near the Bowery on Great Jones Street (thus the novel is titled Great Jones Street). Bucky would gaze out the win­ dow on a cityscape of “warehouses, trucks and rubble.” He contemplated all the wild men down on the Bowery cleaning the windows of cars for chump change to score Thunderbird or Black Cat. A bar called CBGBs—just two blocks down from Great Jones, one block down from Bond Street—was droll enough to have been created by Don DeLillo, but that joint was real. CBGBs was located on the first floor of the Palace Hotel building, the biggest flophouse in New York. The Palace could hold 400, 500 people. People out of jail. Out of something. “Lost souls,” Hilly Kristal called them. He owned the then–Hell’s Angels bar called CBGB—a small “s” added to the name by those in the know. The\n\n45\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\njoint’s complete name was CBGB+OMFUG, short for: Country, Blue(G)rass, Blues & Other Music for Uplifting Gourmandizers. “Every once in a while a bum would dive out of the window or stag­ ger in here with a knife,” Kristal remembered. “Every once in a while things dripped down and you never knew if it was wine or pee. The Angels? I’d never known a Hell’s Angel in my life. They just came in. I think I was on crutches then. They took a liking to me.” Kristal at the time was a sort of leprechaun ex-Marine with curly long hair and a beard. On bad mornings, he wouldn’t necessarily look out of place up in the Palace Hotel instead of crashed out below, there in the back of his bar where he lived. “The Bowery had once been a farm lane,” Kristal explained. “It started in the aftermath of the Civil War. A lot of people came here after Gettysburg and Shiloh lost, out of their heads. People hung out here. First they had stables. Then it became a railroad street. It was dark and dingy from the third story down, and trains went by every few minutes. The place was lined with derelict bars in the early 1900s. So you had the Confidence Bar. The Last Mile. My place used to be called the Palace Bar.”\n\n46\n\nDavid and Dalglish would drift catty-corner across the Bowery at night to play a little pool at CBGBs. David often wore a white plastic raincoat and shades. He was experimenting with his look. Neither of the two were any good at eight-ball, but David remembered, “We were posing as hard as we could.” CBGBs was no longer just a dive with a pool table. It was a place to hear bands—bands that weren’t just cover bands or boogie bands. The music blaring through that 167-by-25-foot room was unwieldy. Raw. Unschooled—the antithesis to Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. The Artistics would have felt at home. People called this music Street Rock. The big band of the early summer was Television. It was fronted by a kid gui­ tarist name Tom Verlaine. Kristal had actually “created” CBGBs the year before. In a story that’s become to rock legend the equivalent of Washington crossing the Delaware—or at least the Beatles at the Top Ten Club in Hamburg circa 1961—young Tom Verlaine, aka Tom Miller, walked past CBGBs just as Kristal was on a ladder hanging a sign. Verlaine, an intrep­ id lad, tugged on Kristal’s pants cuff and asked if his band could play there some Sunday. Kristal was reluctant. Then he wasn’t. And Verlaine’s group Television—although neither country nor bluegrass nor blues—had a gig. Television played a version of electric Dionysian ecstasy. “I didn’t\n\nF i n d Yo u r s e l f a C i t y t o L i v e I n\n\nlike them at first,” Kristal recalled. “They were very raw. I was used to hear­ ing a different kind of music. I liked classical music. I studied opera. I liked folk singing and stuff. I had managed the Village Vanguard for three years. I saw the best jazz groups in the worlds. All my favorites are not alive any­ more. Miles. Monk. Mingus.” Kristal and most everyone else immediately dug Verlaine’s lover, Patti Smith. She was a tough Jersey broad who played music that was the incarnation of a Baudelaire vision. Smith and her small band would do a set that segued from Smokey Robinson’s “The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game” (which she might dedicate to actress Charlotte Rampling) to an insane Wilhelm-Reich-returns-to-his-son-in-a-flying-saucer song, “Bird­ land”—both numbers sung in a slow Billie Holiday tempo. Smith yapped as if she’d just invented the idea of singing poetry. Who the hell is Bob Dylan? Smith didn’t play only at CBGBs. That summer she opened upstairs at Max’s Kansas City for John Lennon’s new backup band, Elephant’s Memory. Max’s was the once legendary Union Square haunt of Andy Warhol/Velvet Underground fame. To get to Max’s from Dalglish’s on Bond Street, you’d saunter north on Bowery, cut over to Lafayette at Cooper Square, the Cooper Union lit clock staring down like the Cyclops of Time. You could almost hear the voice of Abraham Lincoln giving the speech that won him the Republican Party’s nomination for president. Now head up Third Avenue. Cut by the Con Ed clock tower. Walk across the street from desolate Union Square— dark, trees, loitering junkies under a statue of General Grant. Then there was Max’s. If you hadn’t been mugged or met any Civil War ghosts, it was only a fifteen-minute walk. Did Kristal feel he was competing with Max’s? “I didn’t compete with anybody,” he said. “I just did what I did. I felt it was eas­ ier that way. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I just picked the bands I wanted. I wished they only played here. But they played here and they played there. When Max’s reopened in late 1975, they copied CBGBs.” On the other hand, if you cut west on Bond Street to Broadway, walked a short walk to Fourth Street, then a couple of blocks west, you’d be at the Bottom Line. An upscale club. “The Bottom Line was a record club,” Kristal said. “You didn’t come there when you were a nobody. You came there when you had a record deal.”\n\n47\n\nTHIS MUST BE THE PLACE\n\nThat summer a promising Jersey rocker named Bruce Springsteen had a gig at the Bottom Line. On a different night, Jobriath tried to burn up the stage. Jobriath was the corporate attempt to capitalize on David Bowie’s glam-rock image—Bowie himself playing Madison Square Garden that sum­ mer to promote Diamond Dogs, an album whose cover portrays the singer as a Great Dane with large hairy balls. David was too broke for Max’s, let alone Madison Square Garden. He did manage to see the New York Dolls somewhere uptown. What made the biggest impression on young Byrne was that this mock-transvestite band all wore red in front of a huge Soviet flag. David felt obligated to follow the rock scene because he was writing opaque little songs for his white electric guitar. What he cleverly did was plug it into a reel-to-reel tape recorder that served as a tiny PA. (Remember, David Byrne was the son of a man who could “fix a submarine with a coat hanger.”) This setup gave his guitar a clean sound, and it wasn’t so loud that it would bug Dalglish. He found himself writing songs against the concept of compa"
