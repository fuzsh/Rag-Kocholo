        "meta_description": "Crisis Point by Subhumans, released 13 September 2019\n\n1. Terrorist In Waiting\n2. Fear And Confusion\n3. Information Gap\n4. Atom Screen War\n5. Follow The Leader\n6. Strange Land\n7. 99%\n8. Punk Machine\n9. Poison\n10. ♫\n11. Thought Is Free\n\nThe first new record from Lucas and his Subhumans in a while (Twelve Years?) and with the current global situation its not like Lucas has had writers block or lacking the inspiration. Everywhere you look there’s a meltdown – climate change, government leaders lying, despots taking over, smiling, lying and cheating yet it seems OK to the public. Nobody loses their jobs its all fair game. Summed up nicely on ‘Fear &amp; Confusion’. A more polished sounding record that their last outing ‘Internal Riot’ but it every bit as sharp and relevant.\r\n\r\nTo be fair Subhumans have always released intelligent records their Anarcho leanings have always been dressed really well in big riffs, tight time changes and some sharp as fuck punk rock. ‘Crisis Point’ seems apt as Lucas starts the war cry with the flurry of opening punches on ‘Terrorist In Waiting’ great lyrics (as usual) thunderous drumming and riffs raining down on the listener with an energy and excitement that sets the album up really well.\r\n\r\nthroughout the albums eleven tracks the ebb and flow is excellent. I love the attitude on ‘Atom Screen War’ emanating from the riff as it pounds away but it’s nicely pinned by the bass thats rumbling away underneath. To be fair the sound is reminiscent of the last few UK Subs albums. ‘Follow The Leader’ takes that edginess up a notch as the album has warmed up and is really taking flight. Strange land has the feel and sound the band had back in the ’80s with that flange riff and repetitive beat its a really good tune and one that shows how bloody good a band Subhumans are.\r\n\r\nIts no good looking for a weakness because there isn’t one. Its a really consistent album its focused and as you’d imagine thought provoking with excellent lyrics and a great production. ‘Crisis Point’ is ticking all the boxes whats not to like? If you want fast no nonsense heads down punk rock then Subhumans do that ‘Poison’ if you want intricate musicianship Subhumans can do that for you, if you want lyrics that are well constructed and thought provoking to prick your conscience subhumans can do that. They were a big part of that early ’80s punk explosion and are still going strong along with the Subs, they always turned in better records than Crass and Conflict in my humble opinion and this record is proof that they are as relevant now as they always were. ‘Crisis Point’ can cover all your modern punk rock needs as well as you old school punks wondering if Dick has still got it. Of course he has. My advice is get hold of ‘Crisis Point’ now and get on board its never too late. Buy it!\r\nDom Daley, RPM Online",

Is it conspiracy Or is it you? If knowledge is power then where's the revolution? Balancing facts to avoid confusion Screenshot theories gathering dust Instant proofs and no more trust Fake news false flags disinformation This is how the structure holds Everything has a contradiction Til nobody knows if what they're being told Is true Ch Sow confusion Laced with fear Stop the people getting anywhere near Coordination, realisation That everything's lost to hesitation Go with your brain go with your heart go with your guts Cos fear and confusion will have us all fucked Ch\n\n3.\n\nInformation Gap 02:49\n\nsee the diamond its forever disconnected from the horrors of child labour so intensive mining undermining our perception of expensive shiny lies to pacify the apprehensive CH: disinformation- what do we know? it's propaganda- telling us what they think they need to coffee romance in the adverts love drug revival far away the migrants sweat for their survival here's the latest cola burger infatuation fed on chemistry and death - deforestation CH: +telling us what they think we need to know here's the product here's the facts they rarely interact check the deadline on the back best before you think about it propaganda met the rumour theres more than meets the eye confusing the consumer get the facts before you buy CH\n\n4.\n\nAtom Screen War 02:40\n\nyour television is a bomb its another world war when you turn it on press the button to forget its a mini explosion chemistry set we're drowning in a box of noise in the attempt to find some peace we overdose on input + we all forget to breathe CH victims of the atom screen war -don't forget to breathe the television is your friend the chemical heads met the media men everybody makes a bomb hyno-tick the box saying free will gone well i don't know about you but i know when atoms crash It creates a slight reaction In the nearest stable mass CH I can stare for half an hour at you and feel completely wired But half an hour of anything on telly and I’m tired Which, in the case of tv signals and whatever’s in computers Is the watching semi-human being slow but surely neutered CH\n\n5.\n\nFollow The Leader 02:34\n\nNow is the deadline and always will be under the breadline in the land of the free no time to plan its a planet gone mad running on empty illusions of good and bad CH: follow the leader do as you're told how much can you be controlled? learn by example of people with guns shooting their mouth off for the freedoms they've won armed to the playground or bombing for peace what kind of human is this inhumanity?
