        "text": "Democrats are going after the black vote by deliberately spreading false information. Apparently it has worked pretty well in the past, but this may be changing.\n\nYou may also be interested in the page about Race-based Political Opportunism.\n\nBackground, overview and recap articles:\n\n(Scroll down for timely news, or click here.)\n\nA racist institution that truly deserves to be renamed: the 'Democratic' Party. As historian and author Bruce Barlett outlines in his book Wrong on Race — the Democratic Party's Buried Past, the Party has deceptively reinvented itself as the Civil Rights Party, in spite of its despicable racial history. Let's review a few of the destructive and divisive policies the Democrats have advanced:\n\n• Woodrow Wilson's segregation of the entire federal civil service\n\n• FDR's appointment of a member of the KKK to the Supreme Court\n\n• Affirmative action, which has driven a wedge between the races and sexes by doling out college admissions and jobs based upon immutable characteristics\n\n• The late Robert Byrd, who was once President pro tempore of the Senate, third in line in the presidential line of succession, was former member of the KKK\n\n• Lyndon Johnson's administration's welfare rules, which effectively banished fathers from homes receiving assistance, and effectively led to the destruction of the urban Black family\n\nDemocrats are worried about black voters in November. Democrats like to hide the fact that it was once Republican party that had the lock on black voters. The Republicans had earned that relationship. The Republican party was formed in 1854 as an abolitionist party, and it was the Republican party, under Abraham Lincoln's leadership, that spearheaded a vast civil war to end that immoral practice. What finally pried blacks away from the Republican party was government money. The first round of government checks came under Franklin Roosevelt. The second round came through Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. That second round not only cemented blacks' allegiance to the Democrat party, it also destroyed much of the black community.\n\nReparations, the New Slave Wages. Every Black History month Blacks sing \"We Shall Overcome\" but if the Black community in America continues to accept and foolishly advocate for a slave mentality, that is what they shall get. The progressive socialist left, aka the Democrat party, has been highly successful in perpetuating a victim mentality for the black community. And in many ways, it has been the policies of the white socialist elitists of the left that have decimated and destroyed the black community. Over the centuries, it has been the Democrats who have brought forth the policies of secession, slavery, segregation, and socialism... the dreaded 4S's of the leftist apocalypse. In every way, these ideologies have proven detrimental to the existence of the black community. It is very comical to me to hear Democrats talk about Jim Crow when that is the policy they created and implemented, along with poll taxes, literacy tests, and lynchings. It was the Senate Democrats who have the record for the longest filibuster in US Senate history, against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which passed thanks to Senate Republicans led by Everett Dirksen. The so-called Great Society programs of widely known racist Democrat president Lyndon Johnson proved not so great. It led to the destruction of the traditional nuclear black family and turned American inner city communities into new economic plantations. Today, the black community is plagued with high unemployment, rampant fatherlessness, the genocidal murdering of our unborn babies, substandard schools, and lagging small business entrepreneurship. The new civil rights issue of this current age is school choice, but leftists, led by the Randi Weingarten teacher's unions stand against it.\n\nTimely news and commentary:\n\nAmericans Must Reject Kamala Harris's Cave to the Darker Parts of the Democratic Party. [Scroll down] The politician who brought the house down was the man who unexpectedly was not chosen to be Harris's VP: Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Shapiro gave a rousing speech that was inaudible at times due to a \"thunderous applause\" that illustrated \"Pennsylvania Democrats' love for the first-term governor.\" Given that Pennsylvania may decide the 2024 presidential race and Minnesota appears firmly in the Democratic column, how could Harris pass over Shapiro and choose Walz? The Harris campaign said the decision was because Harris and Walz have good chemistry. The campaign also claimed Walz was chosen to help Harris, a California liberal, pick up votes in the Midwest. There were also press reports that Shapiro was not chosen because he was too ambitious and might have overshadowed Harris. There may be some truth in these explanations. But make no mistake: the main reason Harris did not select Shapiro is because anti-Semitic, pro-Hamas progressives pressured her not to choose the Pennsylvania governor since he is a pro-Israel Jew.\n\nCNN Stunned as a Group of Black Men at Harrisburg Barbershop in Pennsylvania [State] 'Kamala Ain't Black'. A group of Black men at a barbershop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, voiced their skepticism on Kamala's racial identity. [...] As the leftist media continues to promote her as a Black American figure, a recent visit to a barbershop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, revealed that many local Black men are not convinced. When asked about their views on Harris, the overwhelming response was clear: 'Kamala ain't black.' In a segment aired on CNN, a CNN reporter noted that callers on an XM radio program quickly dismissed the opinions of the barbershop patrons. \"When I played that audio on XM radio program on Thursday, many callers who self-identified as African-American were quick to tell me that those men were the exception, not the rule. Some described them as low information voters, no different than you'd find among Whites.\" [Tweet with video clip]\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe people who are quick to call a radio station (and get through the screener) to promote a Democrat are probably political activists. The people \"randomly\" encountered in an all-black barber shop were probably expected to support the Democrat, which is why they were interviewed in the first place. Blacks who care about race and politics don't appreciate a mostly-Indian opportunist calling herself black and putting on a phony black dialect when it suits her needs. If you disagree with the Democrats, they'll call you stupid: \"Low-information voters.\"\n\nCNN Wasn't Expecting What These Black Voters Had to Say About Kamala Harris. Despite the humor that's deeply embedded in them, I still feel that deep personal attacks on Kamala Harris do nothing but animate the liberal base. There's enough to rip apart Kamala on her record and accompanying video. With the race tightening up, the Trump camp needs to focus. [Tweet] Donald Trump caused a stir at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago when he said he doesn't know what ethnicity Kamala Harris is, noting that she portrayed herself as Indian but \"became black\" when her national profile was heightened. Everyone who isn't a liberal knows what he was referencing, which is that the woman will say and embody anything to win an election; we don't know the real Kamala. Yet, the media, lusting for an attack to deliver an election-killing blow, is trying to weaponize this soundbite. CNN tried to manufacture some attack material for Democrats by speaking to black voters in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and they were not expecting this response: [Video clip from X]\n\nMedia Completely Ignores 'Blacks Against Harris' Zoom Call Event. This week, a large Zoom event called 'Blacks Against Harris' took place and was attended by thousands of people, but the media ignored it. Apparently, 'White Dudes for Harris' and 'White Women for Harris' are fine, but 'Blacks Against Harris' is unacceptable. Why do you suppose that is? If Democrats and their media allies want to live in this divisive world of identity politics, they should not be allowed to pick and choose which groups deserve attention and praise. [Tweet with video clip] There has been a lot of talk in this election cycle about the increasing amount of support for Trump among black voters, particularly black men. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), one of Biden's biggest boosters, is dismissing this as a non-starter.\n\n'Race-faking' is now okay? So Kamala Harris has shared heritage from India and Jamaica, but identifies as black? I thought being black was the provenance of African heritage, and why is it so sensitive of a question to raise? Is it not a legitimate inquiry? Usually when a question provokes such a disproportionate and angry backlash, it indicates that the inquiry is hitting a nerve because those being questioned have no good response. Are blacks descended from Africa not offended when non-Africans appropriate their culture, history, and heritage for political purposes? It's funny, when Jessica Krug and Rachel Dolezal masqueraded as black women while being white, they were taken to the woodshed for their temerity to culturally appropriate another race.\n\nThe Democrats and Racism in History. Journalists, academics, and Hollywood continue to falsely reify the Democrat party as heroically saving black people from the throes of anti-black racism. One of the significant moments of this alleged rescue is the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964. The Democrat party under the Senate leadership of Robert Byrd fought the passage of the bill in the Senate for 14 hours of filibuster. President Biden eulogized former Klan member Byrd in 2010. In the speech, Biden described Byrd as \"dean of the Senate\" and a \"dear friend and mentor.\" Six Republican senators and 20 Democrat senators voted to deny cloture alongside Byrd in 1964 — an attempt to prevent the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. At the time, the Senate was composed of 67 Democrats and 33 Republicans. Eighty-two percent of the Republican Senate caucus voted for passage of the Civil Rights Act. Two thirds of Democrats supported passage, and one third opposed. The House vote was 289-176 in favor of the legislation. Ninety-one Democrats voted against (37%) the bill in the House, and 35 Republicans voted against it (20%).\n\nPeople Leave Kamala Harris' Atlanta Rally After She Starts Speaking — They Only Showed Up to Watch [a] Rapper. Kamala Harris on Tuesday evening [7/30/2024] held a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia where she vowed to confiscate firearms and absurdly claimed she was working to secure the border. Only it wasn't just a campaign rally for Harris. After stealing Joe Biden's delegates, the media is desperate to sell 'Kamalamania.' Kamala Harris has never won a primary. She didn't win the primary in 2020 and she stole Biden's delegates in the 2024 election cycle. [...] The Atlanta crowd didn't show up to see Kamala Harris. They turned out to see rappers twerk.\n\nMore Blacks Resisting the Narrative: National Assoc. of Black Journalists Hosts Conversation With Trump. As I covered extensively on Saturday, the dam is breaking in terms of Blacks and their presumed lockstep support of the Democrat Party. This is particularly prescient among Black men, who have become quite vocal about no longer supporting the party and its aims, which are counter to their concerns and issues. Fox Digital interviewed attendees at a July 27 Grand Rapids, MI, Trump Rally, and they sounded off about what the Democrat Party gets wrong about them. Something else is causing a stir among the Black intelligentsia. Some are highly upset that the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) plans to have a conversation with former President and GOP nominee Donald Trump at their annual Convention & Career Fair in Chicago.\n\nBlacks Loudly Declare Their Lack of Support for a Kamala Harris Presidency. Despite the tremendous psyop by the Democrat Party and the legacy media to shove Vice President and anointed Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris through without debate or question, not everyone is on board. Surprisingly, certain aspects of the Black community are tacitly refusing to play along, even as the media gaslights and attempts to memory hole Harris' past and present record. [Tweets] #BlackTwitter, a still powerful remnant on the X social media platform, has been particularly vocal about the media power brokers and Harris' insistence that she is Black. Not only do they not consider her to be Black, they also drag Harris for her record of public service. In over 30 years of being in public office, Harris has done absolutely nothing for the Black community: [Tweet]\n\nKamala Harris Musters Fake Accent in North Carolina. Why does she always do this? Kamala Harris was in North Carolina rallying a small crowd of supporters as Joe Biden stayed out of the public eye after he announced he has Covid. Harris mustered a fake accent as she delivered a campaign speech to North Carolina rallygoers in a city near Fort Liberty (previously Fort Bragg). \"We too busy watchin' what you doin' to hear what you're sayin,'\" Harris said in her fake accent.\n\nDemocrats' greatest fear is coming true: Black men and young people like Trump. For decades, Democrats had a lock on two very important demographics: blacks and the youth vote. Part of the Democrats' screaming panic and hyperbole in this election cycle is because both of those groups are waking up to the fact that the Democrat party is not serving them well. [...] What most scares Democrats is that they're suddenly losing black voters while the trend away from Democrats continues among the youngest voters.\n\nIt Has Dawned on Some That Biden Never Liked Black People. Along with the discoveries and sudden revelations of President Joe Biden's cognitive issues — a fact that alternative and right-leaning media has been reporting for years — Biden's overt racism has been given a fresh look. In a post-July 4th campaign stop on Sunday, a young Black girl waits patiently on the rope line for President Biden to greet her and take a selfie. After glad handing the white man standing next to her, Biden treats the young girl like she's invisible and immediately goes to the elderly white woman standing on the other side of her. Talk about rude. [Tweet with video clip] I was this many years old when I realized Joe Biden is a racist. I have been a political junkie since I was seven. I am now 57, and I can recall all of these racist comments from then-Senator and VP Joe Biden compiled in this snippet. [Tweet with video clip]\n\nThis Was The Moment This Black Woman Discovered Biden Hates Black People. Not only did Biden shun the black girl, not once, but twice, and one of the old white hags that Biden favored cursed her for holding a sign. Look at the evil in that woman's face. It gets worse. The black girl was pulled from the back row and placed up front where cameras could see her. She was nothing more than a political stunt for Biden to gain appeal with black voters, and he ignored her. [Video clip]\n\nJoe Biden, advanced dementia patient, enduring symbol of sclerotic late-stage liberal democracy. Joe Biden, sitting President of the United States, in his historic debate with former President Donald J. Trump, on the climate crisis: [\"]We find ourselves — and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they'll be able to get those jobs in high tech.[\"] [...] Nobody can any longer deny that the United States is in the hands of a senile figurehead suffering from serious dementia. Biden remains in office for reasons of convenience and political patronage; who is actually steering the executive branch is anybody's guess.\n\nVince Everett Ellison Exposes the Lies Sold to Black America: MLK, Hip Hop Culture, & Democrats. [Video clip only.]\n\nAt CNN, the hysteria is ratcheting up as young blacks abandon Biden for Trump. Republicans were the party of abolition and the Civil Rights Act. Democrats were the party of slavery and Jim Crow. However, reflecting a trend that started under FDR, accelerated in the 1960s, and went into hyperdrive with Obama, blacks have been America's most passionate Democrat voters. That may finally be changing. Biden, who's proven to be America's most consequential president in a bad way (having destroyed our economy, border, military, etc.), has done one useful thing: He seems to have broken the Democrat party's stranglehold on the black vote.\n\nJoe's Distemper Is Showing. It's been said that in the end, fate gives us all the face that we've earned. That maxim seems to have been tailor-made for Joe Biden; can there be a more revealing portal to the man's core than the unpleasant countenance he now imposes on the public? [...] We saw Biden's true identity during his recent commencement \"address\" to Morehead College, the historically black all-male university. It is difficult to imagine a more selfishly destructive, dishonorable, and unworthy tactic than the one Biden employed on what should have been a positive and hopeful occasion for these graduates. For the sake of political advantage, this not-so-closeted bigot attempted to turn the place into a Plantation of Higher Learning. Forget the efforts of these young men to educate and better themselves; according to this half-crazed haranguer they were more likely destined for a George Floyd-esque fate in the irredeemably evil America that Biden sketched.\n\nThe Evidence Is In: Progressivism Is a Mental Illness. [P]rogressive whites have a reductionist, racist view of blacks and other ethnic minorities as exotic but pitiable, helpless, and childlike, without personal agency, with no free will, no moral compass, no impulse control, and therefore no responsibility for their actions. However, mentally juxtaposing black skin color with rampant crime and other social pathologies causes cognitive dissonance, because progressive whites simply cannot abide, or even acknowledge, the suggestion that they as progressive white Democrats might be racist (!). White progs cope with the cognitive dissonance by displacing their negative perceptions about black behavior onto other whites, blaming and accusing those \"other\" whites of racism toward blacks. The self-loathing and redirected racism also explain progressive whites' remarkable hostility toward their own race.\n\nA Short History of Democratic Party Lawfare. The Democratic Party's use of law and the criminal justice system to maintain political power dates back to the \"peculiar institution\" of slavery. It is often ignored or deliberately forgotten that the Democratic Party was the party of slavery. In the states of the Deep South and elsewhere, Democratic Party legislators enshrined slavery into law, Democratic executives enforced those laws, and Democratic judges upheld those laws against legal and constitutional challenges. Democratic presidents like Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, and Andrew Jackson were slaveholders. So were many Democratic governors. It was Democrats who insisted on passage of the Fugitive Slave Act as part of the Compromise of 1850. It was a Democratic Supreme Court Chief Justice (Roger Taney) who wrote the court's opinion (Scott v. Sanford, known as the Dred Scott case) upholding slavery and declaring African Americans to be chattel. It was Democratic Party state and local officials that in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction imposed so-called \"Jim Crow\" laws in many states of the Deep South.\n\nIf You Stand With Joe Biden, You Are Standing With An Actual White-Supremacist. Isn't that a lovely picture of Angie Brennan and the imposter-figurehead-President Joe Biden. But does Little Miss Angie know she is standing with a White-Supremacist? For example, Biden believes that White people like him should get to decide who is a \"real Black\" and who is not. Remember this from 2020: [Video clip] And this was NOT a \"one-off.\" Just recently, Biden told graduates at Morehouse College essentially that they had just wasted four years because America is pervasively and incurably racist ... the clear implication being that these graduates will amount to nothing without Great White Father Biden in the White House. A variation on 2020's \"you ain't Black.\"\n\n'He's talking like he's a black man!' Lawrence Jones blasts Biden over race-baiting Morehouse speech. President Joe Biden's \"race baiter\" commencement address over the weekend left an incensed Lawrence Jones in disbelief. \"He's talking like he's a black man[.]\" [Video clip] [Advertisement] Stops in Detroit and Atlanta were heavy-handed on divisive politics from the president as he appeared at an NAACP event after celebrating the graduates of Georgia's Morehouse College. The latter drew particular ire from \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Jones on Monday as he challenged the claims made with the question, \"How does he know?\" During the speech that co-host Steve Doocy would go on to suggest had been \"focus-tested,\" Biden pivoted off the 2020 death of George Floyd while in police custody in the months after COVID had begun sweeping across the country.\n\nFewer than 24 of 400 Graduates at All-Black Morehouse College Applaud Biden. [Tweet with video clip] Please play the video in the Tweet above. My first reaction was wow, what a dismal round of applause. And that's still my reaction, now backed up by numbers. Fewer than 24 of 400 blacks applauded Biden. I did not plan to do two political posts in a row, nor did I have any idea that Morehouse College graduates would have this reaction or that Biden was even speaking at Morehouse College. Biden has serious issues with Black voters judging from recent polls. And judging from the reaction to Biden's speech to the graduating class of Morehouse College on Sunday, his support may be less than the polls indicate.\n\nBiden's presidential motorcade drives through deep blue Atlanta neighborhood, but draws only sparse crowd. President Joe Biden's motorcade drove through deep blue Atlanta this weekend to little fanfare, leading many to wonder about the enthusiasm for his 2024 campaign. In 2020, the president became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia in 30 years. The party also won both senate seats in the Southern state. But the state's landscape has shifted significantly over the last four years, with recent polls suggesting former president Donald Trump is in the lead in the Peach State.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul and the Democrat party's hard bigotry of no expectations. You've already heard about New York Governor Kathy Hochul's gaffe about black children. (I'm using the word \"gaffe\" in the way that Michael Kinsley defined it: \"A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth — some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say.\") In Hochul's case, when she said black kids in the Bronx didn't know what a computer is, she was stating the unspoken Democrat party view about blacks: To a Dem, blacks are stupid, incompetent, incapable, and unteachable. To the extent that, sadly, some blacks conform to this stereotype, it's because the Democrat party has systematically removed all hope of betterment from them. [Tweet with video clip] [Transcript] Hochul later had \"regrets\": \"In a statement later Monday, Hochul said 'I misspoke and I regret it.'\" I bet she does. It speaks volumes, though, that she didn't bother with a huge apology. With Hispanics flooding the country, Democrats may be rethinking how much they need the black community.\n\nThe Governor of New York thinks that Black kids don't even know what a computer is. [Scroll down] If you have ever wondered how a Democrat could believe some outlandish thing like \"socialism works\" or that \"you can just print money to pay for things,\" know this: they don't live in this universe. They have invented one in which they are the only good guys, vast numbers of people need Democrats to tell them how to live, and anybody who disagrees with them is Hitler. Not quite Hitler, because Hitler was an evil genius. We are more like lobotomized Hitlers too stupid to understand things like The Science and that the Earth is literally burning. [Tweet] Imagine living in a world where cartoon characters like Klaus Schwab are well-respected. One where telling people they should eat bugs instead of beef is a good idea. Or one where solar panels will replace nuclear reactors and natural gas plants. Or one in which sex is \"assigned at birth\" rather than determined by your genes and genitals. [Tweet] One of the striking things about the liberals you see in power is that they are, to a great extent, stupid and disconnected from reality.\n\nDem NY Gov. Kathy Hochul Says 'Young Black Kids' Don't Know the Word 'Computer'. Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) believes that \"young black kids growing up in the Bronx don't even know what the word 'computer' is.\" \"They don't know,\" she added. \"They don't know these things.\" [Advertisement] [Tweet] This condescension toward black people has always simmered just beneath the surface of the Democrat Party (the party that fought a Civil War to hold onto their slaves, and then created the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow, and segregation). But earlier this month, it bubbled and then burst to the surface through Hochul's ignorant and racist mouth.\n\nRacist NY Governor Says Black People Don't Even Know What A Computer Is. New York Governor Kathy Hochul says that young black kids growing up in the Bronx don't even know what the word 'computer' is. [Video clip]\n\nThe Democratic Party: The Purveyor of Anti-Semitism. The plain, hard fact that must now be understood is that one of America's two major political parties — the Democrat Party — has not only become the command central platform for today's outbreak of anti-Semitism; for those who came in late, anti-Semitism has always had a home on the left and specifically in the Democratic Party. Recall that the party has always had race as a central component. Founded by slave owners, as I have noted in this space previously, it was early on record as a staunch supporter of everything from slavery to segregation to — yes, indeed — the Ku Klux Klan. As noted here previously, the party was a serious handmaiden to the \"formation of the Ku Klux Klan, which, according to Columbia University historian Eric Foner[,] became 'a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.'\" According to \"University of North Carolina historian Allen Trelease's description,\" the Klan was specifically the \"terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nTim Scott: Trump Trial 'Injustice' [is] Driving Black Voters to GOP. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) told Breitbart News exclusively on Monday afternoon that the trial that Democrats are dragging former President Donald Trump through in New York is only driving more black voters away from Democrats — like President Joe Biden — and toward the Republican Party and Trump. \"There's no doubt that when you see a nearly 75 percent increase in black men wanting to support President Trump, that's not an insignificant increase,\" Scott told Breitbart News as Trump sat in a New York courtroom facing criminal charges from District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \"That is a gargantuan step in the right direction. Why? Because the Democrat stronghold on power is being broken by people who say, 'This isn't fair, and I want an America that is fair, and if they will do it to him, they will do it to me.'[...]\"\n\nBlack Men Dumping Democrat Party to Support Trump. Bless Joe Biden's heart. The arguably worst president in American history has intentionally screwed up this country, in less than four years, beyond what even I thought he was capable of doing. [...] How badly so? A new Wall Street Journal poll found that 30 percent of black men in seven swing states now support former President Donald Trump over Biden. Trump garnered only 12 percent of black male voters in 2020. That's a monumental shift, which hurts Biden more than it helps Trump, meaning that the traditional coalition of disparate voting groups must hold for a Democrat to win the White House. I'm not suggesting Joe's toes up, but his campaign does appear to be on life support.\n\nThe losers in Biden's America. [Scroll down] I call out black people as a \"group,\" as they've consistently voted for the Democrats upwards of 90 [to] 95% despite their relative standard of living declining year in, year out. Crime, education outcomes, inflation, and illegal immigration have seen generational declines in the black community and have accelerated in the past three years. Many black influencers have asked the question: \"We've voted for Democrat promises year in, year out; what has it gotten us?\" Nothing but despair.\n\nBiden's pandering to a few terrorist sympathizers drives away millions of other voters. In 2020, about five and a half million people voted in Michigan. Biden won by about 155,000 votes. Of those five and a half million who voted in Michigan, about 145,000 were Muslim. About 100,000 of them voted for Biden. Those 100,000 Michigan Muslims are now making a stink. They're unhappy that Biden is permitting Israel to finish the war that Palestinian terrorists started on October 7. They demand that Biden pressure Israel into a cease fire that would leave the terrorists free to murder, rape, behead, burn alive, and terrorize another day — and another year and another decade. These terrorist sympathizers have instilled in Biden... well, terror. Without Michigan, the math is very difficult for him to win reelection. And he's already on the defensive there.\n\nWhy Biden Is Bleeding Non-White Voters. For decades, the Democrats have depended on the overwhelming support of minority voters to keep their party electorally viable. Even when they nominated candidates with spotty civil rights records, like Joe Biden, the Democrats could count on at least 90 percent of the Black vote and about 70 percent of the Latino vote. Now, however, polls suggest that neither the President nor his party can take these votes for granted. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll, for example, found that Biden's lead over former President Trump among non-white working class voters has plummeted to 6 points (47-41). In 2020, Biden led Trump by nearly 50 points among these voters.\n\nBiden and the insurmountable. Black voters seem to have matured a bit. Street interviews and polls suggest that an increasing number realize that they re-enslaved themselves to the Democrat party and received little by way of meaningful benefits in return. Yes, they got welfare, cheesy food stamps, and drug-infested housing, but look what it cost them: their dignity, a husbandless family, females working two and three jobs to feed their families, alienation from their churches, more crime, and you know the rest. Biden inflation has eaten any wage increases workers obtained during the Trump years. The cost of essentials is devastating for those on the lower-socioeconomic level. Furthermore, competition from Biden illegals is beginning to create adverse employment opportunities, and it will only worsen. The military was an employment refuge for many black and white citizens, who gained many social benefits and positive life experiences as well as post-service education stipends. Now the military cannot fill its quotas because of what Biden has done by way of sexualization.\n\nThe Latest Black Conservative that Leftists Despise. The Left is so predictable that I can tell you with complete accuracy how they will respond to a Black conservative's candidate. On cue, without missing a beat, the day after Mark Robinson won the Republican primary for governor in North Carolina, the vicious press, putting in overtime, went to work. Nine of 10 articles that you would encounter on Mark Robinson were complete hit jobs, taking his words and phrases out of context. The same was true on the internet. Google, among the most evil companies that has ever appeared on Earth, with their oh-so-mysterious algorithms, made sure that nothing good was said in links about Mark Robinson until about the 12th listing. Then, Google followed with links to more hit pieces. Why does the Left so thoroughly despise Black conservatives? Why does the Left disparage them at every turn, such as Larry Elder, Candace Owens, Lt. Col. Allen West, and Senator Tim Scott? Because the mere existence of a Black conservative upsets everything that the Left stands for, such as keeping Blacks \"in their place,\" ensuring they dare not leave the liberal plantation, and hoping that they don't have an original political thought.\n\nDisposable Democrats. In a totalitarian government, everyone is a Kleenex. Once you serve your purpose, you are disposable. Oh, the ruler may keep you around for a while, but sooner or later, everyone gets thrown away. Democrats are showing their supporters just how disposable they are. In recent weeks, Biden has betrayed black people, women and others. Let's start with black people who provide one-fourth of the votes Democrats receive. That's a lot of votes and a lot of clout. For decades, Democrats took them for granted but about 20 years ago, Democrats adopted a DEI strategy that has led to a surge of black mayors across the country and of course, Barack Obama. All was good except Democrats sought to expand their base by opening the borders to gangbangers, drug cartels, Red China's spies, terrorists and a few people seeking freedom and welfare. Democrats worked to let them in and sign them up. Along came Governor Greg Abbott of Texas who began shipping illegal aliens to sanctuary cities. This quickly overwhelmed those cities, leading mayors to have illegals oust black people from the top of the Democrat totem poll. The reaction is as one may expect.\n\nWe Don't Need a New G.O.P. We Need the Old One. One of the most racist films ever made in Hollywood was screened and applauded at Woodrow Wilson's White House. D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation was an eye opener for me when I first watched it 20 years ago because I had never been aware of the origin of the Ku Klux Klan or how racist the Democrat party was and still is. It was Democrat Wilson who authorized segregation in the federal government under the guise that it would benefit Black workers. Today, Democrat politicians routinely toss out the race card against GOP rivals because so many voters are ignorant of that party's racist past. The Civil Rights Act of 1965 had more Republicans vote for it than the hypocritical Dems. Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) was a former member and organizer of the KKK and filibustered the passage of the Civil Rights Act, yet served in Congress for 51 years.\n\nYou're getting what you voted for, Boston! And even this won't change the way you vote.\n\nBoston Families Furious as City Kicks Black Children Out of Community Center to House Biden's Migrants. Local families in the predominantly black Roxbury neighborhood of Boston are furious after the city shut down the local community center to instead use it to house more of President Joe Biden's illegal border crossers. Roxbury's Melnea A. Cass Recreational Community Center, which was once a meeting place for Little League ball players, volleyball games, and other sports and community events, has now been dedicated to rows of cots for illegal border crossers, CBS, WBZ-TV Boston reported. WBZ interviewed pre-teen Jeremiah Rodriguez who showed up at the community center on Feb. 17 under the mistaken impression that his community baseball team was using the facility for batting practice. He was devastated to find out his community center was now closed to him.\n\nRachel Levine claims climate change has 'disproportionate' impact on black people. Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel (Richard) Levine marked Black History Month on Thursday by releasing a video claiming climate change disproportionately affects black people. Levine also suggested the new bureaucracies established under the Biden administration dedicated to \"climate change and health equity\" and \"environmental justice\" will help tackle the alleged inequality. [Tweet with video clip]\n\nAdmiral 'Rachel' Levine: 'Climate change is having a disproportionate effect on black communities'. [Tweet with video clip]\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nNothing says credibility like a guy in a dress. Or a guy who was promoted to Admiral overnight. Or a well-fed white man pretending to be the champion of the black community.\n\nBiden Slammed for Buying Fried Chicken for Black Family in 'Outreach' Video. Before his landslide victory in South Carolina's Democratic primary on Saturday, President Joe Biden released a video in which he blatantly pandered to black voters while promoting ethnic stereotypes. The video was filmed during a recent visit to Raleigh, North Carolina — anticipated to be a key swing state in the 2024 election. Biden, along with Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper, stopped at Cook Out, a North Carolina-based fast-food chain, before meeting with local Wake County school administrator Eric Fitts and his two teenage sons, Christian and Carter. [Video clip]\n\nJoe Biden Put Out A Video Of Him Eating Fried Chicken With A Black Family To Get The Black Vote Back. After new polls show President Trump taking about 30% of the black vote, which is a game changer, bumbling Biden released a video of him eating fried chicken with black people to reconnect. [Video clip]\n\nThe Absurd Democrat Border Con. Major blue-state cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., became outraged that they were inundated with tens of thousands of immigrants, all without legality, veritable identification, or background checks. Some proved violent. Others crowded out scarce resources essential to millions of inner-city poor. The liberal architects of illegal immigration are usually rich and powerful enough to be insulated from the consequences of their utopian policies. But not so their poor or minority constituents. They deal first-hand with spiking crime, appropriation of their parks and civic centers, and restricted access to now overwhelmed social services. So the once open-border Democrat Party and Joe Biden are in a quandary. They now fear mass defections of core Latino and Black voters in an election year.\n\nDemocrats: We Need Illegals to Do Menial Tasks. I hate to repeat the by-now tired observation that Democrats are racists, but I will anyway. [...] The latest example of unintentional humor is Jerry Nadler's unintentionally hilarious excuse for why the United States needs to import several million illegal immigrants a year: They make great menial laborers. Without illegals, vegetables would rot in the fields. [Tweet with video clip] [...] This is actually a common assertion of Democrats, who generally know about as much about agriculture as I know about performing brain surgery. Nancy Pelosi has made this same assertion, and I do have to admit that she knows a bit about viniculture, although I do wonder if admitting that you employ illegal immigrants to do work for you is a smart move. It is still illegal to do that, I think. Not that Democrats care about such things unless a Republican does it. Then, it is a scandal.\n\nDemocrats Love Racists Because They Are Racists. Ever been to a club where the bouncer checking IDs at the door is also working a clicker to keep a headcount so the place doesn't violate the fire code capacity (by too much). Each person in is a click, each person out is a click. [...] The most common button on the \"progressive clicker,\" and their favorite, is the race button. They wear it to a nub on an average day on MSNBC with the fervor of Hunter Biden face-planting into a pile of blow. It's their go-to for everything. What used to be an emergency brake for when they were losing an argument is now their opening salvo — calling something racist is easier than trying to make a case or refuting facts and reality. That's wearing pretty thin, as most people yawn at the charge now.\n\nThe president of the Illinois NAACP called illegal aliens 'savages'. For decades, the Democrats have built a political coalition based on victimhood. Indeed, they even have a name for this coalition: Intersectionality. Women, blacks, the handicapped, Hispanics, the LGBTQ+ cadre, they were all bound together by shared resentment against white men. As the old Arab proverb went, \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" But what happens when the common enemy is less of a problem than that intersectional friend? We're finding out in Chicago where blacks are increasingly dismayed by the city giving illegal aliens resources that once went to the black community. And in a city plagued by crime, it turns out that at least some blacks prefer the familiar black criminals as opposed to the new illegal alien criminals. News broke yesterday that the president of the Illinois NAACP got in trouble because she called illegal aliens rapists, robbers, and even \"savages\": [...]\n\nBlacklisting is no longer enough, now the goal is justifying mass murder. It seems the rising effort of many — mostly on the left but not entirely — to blackball and censor their opponents in the past decade is no longer satisfied with these ugly goals. Now it seems the goal is to justify mass murder and the rape and torture of women and children. We can see this by what happened during a city council event in Oakland, California yesterday. When one Jewish council member, Dan Kalb, attempted to add language condemning Hamas to a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, he was greated by boos and an unrelenting stream of locals not only opposing his amendment but denying that the mass murder by Hamas had even occurred, that it was instead committed by Israeli troops, and that anyone who dared disagree with them was a \"white supremacist.\" The video below provides a quick selection of this hate and ignorance: [Video clip]\n\nThe federal government and states have the power to go after rampant antisemitism. What to do with the Jew-haters who walk among us? They fall into two broad categories: non-citizens and citizens, and the answer depends on the category into which they fall. For the non-citizen category, Newt Gingrich writes, \"Americans overwhelmingly believe that activities designed to intimidate or frighten Jewish Americans can be punished legally (66 percent to 17 percent)\" and \"By 66 percent to 22 percent, Americans would deport non-citizens who publicly support the killing of Jews or support Hamas or other terrorist organizations.\" Newt calls upon Congress to enact legislation that mandates deportation. As for the citizen category, when it comes to our mostly home-grown loudmouth punks calling for violence against Jews, let them be prosecuted! Many states have statutes criminalizing threats of bodily injury and threats intending to place others in fear of bodily injury. These crimes may be called \"menacing,\" \"intimidation,\" \"harassment,\" or some variation of this concept.\n\nBehind Our Politics is the Existential Fight for the Middle Class. [Scroll down] Why does the educated ruling class practice the cruel humiliation of the ordinary White middle class? It is because the educated ruling class believes that the ordinary White middle class is a caste of White oppressors that must be defanged and stripped of power in order to end the unjust oppression of the non-white lower class. This is a lie. The ordinary White middle class is not interested in power, or humiliation, or anything else connected with political power. Why does the educated ruling class obsess about the oppression of the non-white lower class? It is because the educated ruling class believes, with religious faith, that without its support, the non-white lower class would descend into poverty and unjust subservience to the White oppressor class — that you and I know as the ordinary White middle class. This is a lie. Even if it wanted to, the ordinary White middle class does not have the power to oppress anyone.\n\nDemocrats and racists. The Democrat party is comprised of racists. It is anti-Semitic, anti-white, and anti-Christian. In recent weeks, they have revealed that they will not stand up for Israel and her Jewish population. Democrats consistently vote against anything that could even remotely be considered anti-Hamas. They won't even censure members who openly stand with known terrorist organizations. Need it be noted that Hamas is a terrorist organization that has openly sworn not only to destroy Israel and every Jew they can get their blood-stained hands on, they have also sworn to destroy America, Christians and all \"infidels,\" meaning non-Muslims? There are enemies in the very guts of American life, like tapeworms devouring any source of national nourishment.\n\nNo, They Aren't Peace Activists, They Are Antisemites. There is nothing wrong with hoping for a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. In fact, for over 70 years the Israelis, the UN, and most people around the world have been arguing that a two-state solution is the only outcome that could achieve permanent peace. There is one problem: the Palestinian leadership and most of the Palestinians, along with a large number of Muslim extremists, don't want a two-state solution. Their goal is one state, one people, and the Middle East altogether cleansed of Jews. It's pretty hard to find a compromise with people who want you dead and gone. Many well-meaning people don't really understand this fact. They have been educated to believe that Israel has been the obstacle to Middle East peace, which explains why so many people have mixed feelings about the conflict and why there is so much sympathy for the Palestinians. Those ignorant of the long and sad history of peace negotiations in the region may be forgiven because they have been taught a false history by academia and the MSM.\n\nKentucky Democrats Go Full Racist Against Daniel Cameron. Democrats love to refer to themselves as the party of diversity. It's always important for leftists to display how many different demographic categories are among their ranks. But what we don't see on the left is diversity of thought. Black conservatives become the targets of disrespect and outright racism from the left. Just ask Clarence Thomas, Tim Scott, and Condoleezza Rice. The latest example of this phenomenon is taking place in Kentucky, where Democrats are going full racist in attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron, who is black. Cameron has trailed incumbent Gov. Andy Beshear until recently. According to RealClearPolitics, the latest Emerson poll shows Cameron with a narrow one-point lead over Beshear, while a poll from the same outlet from the beginning of October showed Beshear with a 16-point lead.\n\nThe Hamas Wing of the Democrat Party Now Numbers 45. It's quite an eye-opener. A vote was taken in the House on Thursday to sanction Hamas terrorists and their supporters. 45 Democrats said no to that resolution. Name 'em and shame 'em. I call them the Hamas Caucus. [Tweet] The resolution is for new sanctions on Hamas' international backers and a policy of opposing Iran's nuclear program 'by any means necessary.' The Squad and its fellow travelers voted against that.\n\nRashida Tlaib Releases Astonishing Propaganda Video That Confirms Her Hatred for Jews. It's hard to imagine there's a more antisemitic person in the U.S. than Congress' own Rashida Tlaib. Every time she opens her mouth these days, she spews incendiary, hateful rhetoric against the Jewish state, even as Jews in her own country fear for their safety. The fact is, Tlaib doesn't care about them and probably would prefer they go away — by any means necessary. It's clear she doesn't care about those who are being held hostage in Gaza after being brutally ripped from their homes in Israel. She hasn't once expressed remorse about that or called for them to be returned to their families. No, Rashida Tlaib is 100 percent aligned, instead, with the antisemitic mobs that, throbbing with self-righteous rage, are taking to college campuses and the streets of U.S. cities demanding, well, the extermination of Jews. Those are her people, and there's no denying it.\n\nThe Muslim-American Revolt Against Joe Biden Has Begun. The Democratic Party is facing a crisis of identity. After Hamas invaded Israel on October 7th, killing well over a thousand people, including many women and children in the most brutal ways, the far-left found itself with a decision to make. Would it apply some nuance to the situation, or would it fall into its default of openly supporting Hamas? Unsurprisingly, they chose door number two, with massive pro-Hamas protests breaking out across the country, many of which have included genocidal language against Jews. That has left the most vocal segment of the Democratic Party in conflict with the President of the United States. While Joe Biden and his handlers have often made equivocating and confusing statements regarding the war, it would be dishonest to suggest that they haven't broadly supported Israel's right to self-defense. Call it a stopped-clock moment or a remnant of the old left remaining, but that tension is now leading to an open revolt of Muslims against the Democratic Party. [Tweet]\n\nThe Death of Democrat Jewish Innocence. Jewish conservatives, while considered a bit of an oddity despite growing numbers, are commonly asked Why are so many Jews liberals? From conservative luminaries like Norman Podhoretz and Dennis Prager to B-team influencers like me, Jewish conservatives have struggled to provide a satisfactory answer. Like any other group, we do not march in lockstep, certainly not when it comes to our religion and definitely not politically. Still, Jewish conservatives readily acknowledge that, like Black Americans, most of us tend to be liberal if not downright progressive and, regrettably, sometimes Marxist. Books and articles have been written, and theories abound as to why this is, including, among others, the idea that Jews are liberal out of residual devotion to FDR and his pro-unionism; as pushback against the brutality they suffered under right-wing totalitarians like Hitler; and because, when Jews became secular, they replaced their religion with progressivism. None of these quite hits the sweet spot, but they all resonate to some extent.\n\nFamed Jewish Playwright Tells Jews: Stop Voting Democrat. Famed award-winning playwright David Mamet, who is Jewish, railed against the Democratic party, urging Jews to stop voting Democrat as there is \"no more cozy mystery in the antisemitism of the Democratic Party.\" Mamet's comments came from an essay he wrote titled, \"How the Democrats betrayed the Jews: The sick thrill of antisemitism has a price.\" \"Today, Jews vote Democratic: electing Presidents who refused to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister (Obama and Biden) in times of 'peace,' who gave and give aid to the terrorist state of Iran in exchange for some semi-specified 'deal.' American 'Aid' to Iran pays for the equipment and ordnance, which is, at this moment, eradicating Jews,\" he wrote. \"There is no more cozy mystery in the antisemitism of the Democratic Party; Representatives are affiliated with the Democratic Socialists and pro-Palestinians, calling for the end of the state of Israel — that is, for the death of the Jews,\" he noted. \"And Democrat Representatives repeat and refuse to retract the libel that Israel bombed a hospital, in spite of absolute proof to the contrary, and will not call out the unutterable atrocities of Hamas. The writing is on the wall. In blood.\"\n\nAnti-Semitic Nuts are Coming Out of the Woodwork in California [and] New York. We've seen this sort of thing happen before. Just a couple years ago there was a wave of anti-Semitic attacks with notable incidents in New York City and Los Angeles. Now it seems to be happening again. Last night a deranged man broke into a Jewish family's home in Studio City, CA and threatened to kill them. The couple's four children were home at the time. [...] Was this guy trying to reenact the murder of Jewish families is Israel? Fortunately, the husband forced the man outside where police found him still ranting when they arrived. He was armed with a kitchen knife and kept shouting \"Free Palestine!\" as he was arrested.\n\nSome American Jews Reassess the Progressive Left. [Scroll down] Not all but many progressive Jews find themselves surrounded by people like the Squad who burst into tears over deaths in Gaza but have much less to say about the murder of Israeli civilians. None of this means Jews are about to move right and join the Republican Party but it may mean they move away from the woke fringe of the Democratic Party, a fringe that continues to lose friends every time they open their mouths.\n\nObama's Racist Chickens Have Come Home to Roost. Rather than elevate black people, the far left has created a situation where black crime is legal and white people are racist if they notice. Shoplifting alone has gutted major cities, and most of the videos we see show black perps. Some localities have made it illegal to try to stop thieves. Businesses even fire employees for trying to stop criminals from stealing, to the point that the stores close and the workers lose their jobs. Hundreds of businesses have left West Coast cities and taken their jobs with them. Once flourishing cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Portland are turning into ghost towns. Crime, drugs, and tent cities have taken over, as planned by the Marxists looking to enslave us all. [...] This is what happens when lefty politicians convince black people they are \"victims\" and then make crime an entitlement. Black crime is now acceptable. What could go wrong? The truly insidious move here is that someday a reckoning will occur. Whether a patriotic president wins or globalists take over our nation, criminals, many of them black, who enjoyed surfing the Democrat-created crime wave will likely end up in prison, never realizing they were pawns.\n\nDemocrats Are Showing You Who They Are, Believe Them. The party of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation isn't suddenly going to pull a 180 and not be monsters; it's who they are. They've never changed their objectives, only their tactics. Now, their embrace of segregation is done in the name of tolerance, of providing a \"safe space\" to minorities. But make no mistake, the end result is the same. That's the thing about the left — they'll happily tell you who they are and the horrible things they hold dear; all you have to do is believe them. The terrorist attack in Israel two weeks ago brought out the worst in the left, but it's also their true self. You can't cheer for the wholesale murder of innocent people and \"really be a good person, deep down.\" No, that's not how it works. It's the opposite — they are raging bigots and monsters who manage to tamp it down below the surface most of the time until there's something to protest or celebrate. It's really that simple.\n\nThousands of protesters demanding eradication of Israel clash with NYPD. Thousands of anti-Israel protesters clashed with police Saturday night after they refused to vacate the Bay Ridge street they had flooded for hours. The \"Flood Brooklyn for Palestine\" demonstration devolved into chaos as night fell, with protesters completely shutting down traffic, screaming at police and lighting small fires in the middle of the roadways. The aggressive protesters dug their heels into the ground when the NYPD tried to push them out of 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, where 5,000 ralliers converged earlier in the day to demand that the United States withdraw support for its closest ally in the Middle East.\n\nWhen You Tell a Jewish Person You'd Put Them in a Gas Chamber, You're Going to Get Fired. Jihadi scum buckets are living among us, and they're being exposed. We all knew the Left's bellowing about white supremacy being an existential threat was nonsensical. It seems anti-Semitism was the real culprit, hidden by years of left-wing hyperbole about other phantom threats. It masked the obvious: there are a lot of Democratic Party supporters who support an Israeli genocide. And it's not an exclusively American problem — Britain's Labour Party is awash with antisemites.\n\nCalifornia to institute missing child alert system specifically for black youth. NBC News has reported that California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed Senate Bill 673 into law, thus making the erstwhile Golden State the first to create a missing child alert system specifically for black children. According to NBC: [\"] [...] The Ebony Alert will be used for missing Black people aged 12 to 25.[\"] Fantastic. But what about missing black people under 12 or over 25? Perhaps there needs to be a separate alert for each of those groups. Twenty-one to twenty-five-year-olds don't seem like \"youth\" to me, yet those under 12 certainly are.\n\nHow do Democrats really view blacks? If blacks need any more proof that, as a group, the white Democrats and leftists who run things see them as inferior, the \"Fire Alarm\" issue surrounding Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) should leave no doubt. Briefly, during the recent vote to avoid a government shutdown, the Democrats sought to delay the vote because the resolution did not include Ukraine funding, but they were unable to buy time. Coincidentally (and conveniently), Rep. Bowman pulled a fire alarm Rep. Bowman, causing a 1-hour delay in the proceedings. It's worthwhile considering how Rep. Bowman came to do this. White liberal leftist Democrats, plus blacks who are running their own con, such as Reverend Al, the SPLC, Ibrahim X. Kendi, and the founders of BLM, see the average black citizen as both a fool and a pawn to be used for gaining and maintaining money and power. Deep down, Democrats truly believe that blacks are incapable of being successful — or even leading an average life — without their help. It is endemic to the leftists' psyche.\n\nWhite House Quietly Edits Transcript After Joe Biden Says Black and Hispanic Workers Don't Have High School Diplomas. The White House quietly edited a transcript of Biden's remarks at a community college in Maryland after another racist slip-up. Joe Biden on Thursday delivered remarks on his failed economic agenda dubbed \"Bidenomics\" at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Maryland. Biden's speech was a total disaster. He lost a few battles with his teleprompter and began shouting out of nowhere.\n\nClimate Eugenics. No, I'm not talking about climate change. I'm talking about eugenics, the early 20th-century belief that there were too many of the wrong people in the world. One hundred years on, though, eugenics has fused with climate change for the perfect anti-human storm. The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, a progressive, was one of the most strident supporters of this new theory. Financial support poured in from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Harriman fortune. (These funds all still support progressive causes.) In 1916, Sanger established the first \"birth control\" clinic. Back in that era, it was commonly believed that \"the best\" human beings (white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants) were not having as many children as \"inferior ones,\" such the immigrants from Eastern Europe and Asia, blacks, degenerates, etc. Sanger spoke of the burden of carrying the \"dead weight of human waste.\" President Theodore Roosevelt, the first progressive presidential candidate, declared that \"Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.\"\n\nCracks in the Rainbow. In 2020, Biden took 42 percent of older white voters. This was on par with his overall performance among whites, and dramatically better than one might expect given that these voters experience the largest and most jarring difference between the America of their youth and the America of today. Among younger members of the Democratic coalition, Biden is also remembered with a warm glow by \"Obama Democrats\" because of his close association with Barack. But \"Uncle Joe\" nostalgia has a rapidly-approaching expiration date for the Democrats. His exit from the scene will likely hasten the rise of a more explicitly left-wing Democratic Party, dominated by minority politicians and often pushing explicitly anti-white interests. In this way, Biden is also an appropriate symbol for the Left — a geriatric, enfeebled white man serving as a figurehead for minority power. Going forward, the Left's public face will increasingly match its public policies. At long last, the party's demography finally will herald its destiny.\n\nThe game is afoot. Democrat policies have left black Americans in broken inner cities with no protection from crime, failing schools, and little opportunity. Their inane policy in giving single mothers more money than households with a man have destroyed the once-proud black American family. Poignantly, many spoke of identifying with Trump's prosecution. \"The man\" has done to black Americans what \"the man\" is now doing to Trump. Also, they stated that things were better under Trump, that his policies worked, gas was way cheaper, and they had more money in their pocket.\n\nLiberals Accuse Cornel West, a Black Man, of 'Stealing Votes' From Biden. [Scroll down] Now, on cue, the corporate state media is framing Cornel West as an illegitimate spoiler candidate getting in the way of the Brandon entity's re-coronation as lord of the plantation — even going so far as to accuse him of \"stealing\" votes, particularly black votes, that are rightfully the property of the Democrat Party. On his show \"Morning Joe,\" host Joe Scarborough — a nominal Republican, mind you — prompts his guest, John Della Volpe: \"How devastating is it if Cornel takes 2, 3, 4% from Joe Biden in 2024?\" Della Volpe nods and receives the question with the appropriate constipated, concerned look at the prospect. \"Joe, I think that if he takes that 2 [to] 3%, it's going to be from the constituency that we just talked about,\" Della Volpe responds. The constituency he references is black Democrat voters.\n\nSenator John Kennedy Goes Off on Senate Democrats for Excusing the Evil, Racist Attacks Against Clarence Thomas. The Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC) did a markup on \"ethics\" legislation Thursday targeting conservative Supreme Court Justices. While the Democrats managed to pass out of this sick bill out of committee on a party-line vote, they got humiliated by Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) in the process over a simple amendment condemning racism. Kennedy is a straight-shooting national treasure complete with an incisive wit and dry sense of humor. He has displayed these talents throughout his time in the Senate whether by stumping unqualified Biden nominees or in interviews with reporters. As Townhall reported, he put his remarkable skills once again to the test and went scorched earth on the Democrats for refusing to pass his amendment calling out the evil, racist attacks against the great Clarence Thomas.\n\nDemocrats Have a Nazi Problem: Here are the Nine Jew Haters Who Voted Israel Is a Racist State. There are two million Arab citizens of Israel with full civil rights, a million seven of those are Muslims. No Muslim country offers that for Jews. Israel is the most full integrated country in the region whose citizens (whatever their religion, race, sexual preference, gender etc) enjoy unparalleled freedoms and rights. The Democrat party is one short, blunt mustache away from their goal. [Tweet with video clip]\n\nWhite Liberal Bullies And Intimidates Black Trump Supporter To Take Off His MAGA Hat. White Democrats have never changed. They are still the rabid racists who feel privileged enough to tell a black man how to think. Just look at how no one comes to this man's defense. Liberals keep telling us that silence is violence. [Video clip]\n\n'60s Denialism: Affirmative Action's Last Ditch Defense. [Scroll down] Almost unnoticed, a labyrinth of soul-crushing social programs was taking root and would soon be institutionalized by the Lyndon Johnson administration under the rubric of \"The Great Society.\" At the time, the only person brave enough — or crazy enough — to call attention to the damage done by these programs was Johnson's undersecretary of labor (and later U.S. senator), Daniel Patrick Moynihan. In his remarkably prescient report, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" Moynihan sounded the alarm in 1965, the same year the Great Society was launched. \"The evidence — not final, but powerfully persuasive — is that the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling,\" Moynihan warned. Causing the dissolution were the sundry social programs that promised women financial security on the real but rarely spoken condition that there be no married father in the household. Until about 1960, the income gap between backs and whites was narrowing. After 1960, with the surge in single-parent households, it began to reverse itself.\n\nGeorgia Democrat Rep. Switches Parties: Democrats 'Crucified Me' and Abuse the Black Community. A Georgia Democrat state representative announced that she is switching parties after her leftist colleagues \"crucified\" her when she chose to support school choice, adding that the Democrat Party has \"gotten away with using and abusing the black community.\" State Rep. Mesha Mainor, who represents District 56 in the Peach State, announced on Tuesday that she is officially switching her party registration from Democrat to Republican following a tumultuous relationship with her colleagues.\n\nAfter Ben & Jerry's Demands U.S. Return Land to Indians, Indian Chief Asks for its HQ. Ben & Jerry's, makers of overpriced stale ice cream that, no matter the flavor, always smells a little like cleaning fluid, keeps bouncing from one dumb controversy to another. First, under the influence of its pro-Hezbollah equity person decided to boycott Israel, leading to counter-boycotts and an eventual surrender, then it got caught using child labor, and now it decided to use July 4th to demand the dismantling of America. [...] Ben & Jerry's, which is in Vermont, then demanded that America turn over Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills to the Indians, where the company conveniently has no facilities. But if we're turning over land to the Indians, why not start with the land that the child labor social justice ice cream place is located on?\n\nDemocrats Baseless Lies Are Responsible For Today's Divisiveness. For as long as I can remember, the Democratic Party has claimed to be a champion for all Americans, particularly for the working class, minorities and for those who are considered marginalized, oppressed or downtrodden. But somewhere between fighting to keep slavery alive (Andrew Johnson); deliberately reducing the number of black civilian employees from the federal workforce and airing a film that glorified the Ku Klux Klan at the White House (Woodrow Wilson); throwing Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II (Franklin Delano Roosevelt); promoting a culture of government dependence, poverty and fatherlessness (Lyndon Johnson); creating racial tension by declaring cops racist — leading to further destruction of our inner cities, while mocking legitimate concerns of disgruntled blue collar midwesterners frustrated by decreasing wages, lack of employment opportunities — and an opioid epidemic hollowing out their communities (Barack Obama); the intentional failure to enforce our country's immigration laws, contributing to a four decade high of inflation by spending trillions of taxpayer dollars on Democrat pet projects that mostly help special interest groups, referring to roughly half the country as violent extremists and weaponizing the Department of Justice — to throw his leading political rival in prison (Joe Biden); it seems fair to say the Democratic Party has fallen well short of being a champion for anyone, except for its own desperate attempt to stay in power at any and all costs.\n\nThe Real Status of Black Students. [Scroll down] First, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty began to cripple the Black family. African American women could get more money from Uncle Sam than they could from their working husbands. Actually, if these husbands were working, their families could not have access to government benefits. Fathers left the home, leaving the raising of children to mothers and grandparents. By 2021, over four million African American kids live with only their mothers. Second, overwhelmingly Democrat-led cities promised hope, but ran down their cities creating increasing crime and slums: environments of hopelessness. Third, for the past several years schools have been teaching Critical Race Theory, in which Black students are told they are systemically inferior and will never be able to compete fairly with White students. Liberals and Black activists hate the removal of affirmative action for racial purposes.\n\nWhite House blames technical glitch for removal of Jean-Pierre's hostile exchange with reporter. A reporter known for his clashes with the Biden White House has accused it of purposefully deleting a heated exchange with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre from Monday's official live stream. \"I'm Black, I'm an immigrant and I'm the little guy... I'm just trying to do my job,\" the White House correspondent for Today News Africa, Simon Ateba, told Fox News Digital. The missing portion, which was later restored after Fox News reached out for comment, featured Ateba accusing the White House of discriminating against him. [...] After Fox News Digital reached out for comment about the missing exchange, the portion of the missing video was then restored to the stream. The White House told Fox News that the portion missing was caused by an error with the encoder that feeds the live stream to YouTube.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nOf course the video was intentionally deleted. Of course the story about a technical issue was an obvious lie. Encoders do not spontaneously edit video in just the right places.\n\nSecretary of Interior Deborah Haaland seizes control of native lands. [Scroll down] Haaland rekindled old conflicts between the nineteen Pueblos and the Navajo Nation when she unilaterally seized control of over 350,000 acres of Navajo Nation Land and BLM land surrounding Chaco on behalf of nineteen Pueblos on June 2, 2023. UNESCO website states, \"Chaco Canyon, a major centre of ancestral Pueblo culture between 850 and 1250, was the focus for ceremonials, trade and political activity for the prehistoric Four Corners area.\" The nineteen Pueblos and the Navajo Nation have been discussing how to manage energy development in the area surrounding Chaco and protect the rights of the Dine who live on those lands. Haaland usurped the ongoing discussion and seized control of the land, which favored her Laguna Pueblo and the other eighteen Pueblos. Haaland has demonstrated that she is no different from any other secretaries of the Interior who preceded her. She seized control of native lands without regard for agreements and Native sovereignty. I believe this is why Native American leaders across the nation have not voiced their approval of her actions. They understand they could be next.\n\nNative Americans block Interior Sec. Haaland from entering event celebrating oil ban. Biden administration officials were forced to temporarily postpone and relocate a weekend event to celebrate a ban on New Mexico fossil fuel development, after Native Americans blocked an access road and told officials to \"go home\" and stop \"trespassing.\" Navajo Nation group shut down the entrance of Chaco Culture National Historical Park on Sunday to prevent Interior Secretary Deb Haaland from leading the event celebrating a newly-enacted, 20-year ban on oil leasing, covering hundreds of square miles of New Mexico land. The event was moved to a nearby location where Haaland said what had transpired was \"less than ideal.\" The ban — implemented June 2 — ends natural gas leasing within 10 miles of Chaco Canyon's World Heritage site, a move landowners were adamantly against, arguing that doing so negatively impacts them and surrounding low-income communities who benefit from the leasing.\n\nThe Leftist Knives Are Already Coming Out for Potential Democrat Spoiler Cornel West. Cornel West announced his run for president just days ago, but the left is already gunning for him because he represents a threat to the Democrats. Kellyanne Conway recently pointed out that West's candidacy could decide the presidency, like Ross Perot did in 1992. The left knows this, and therefore West must be destroyed. MSNBC declares that Cornel West, a black Marxist, is running a campaign that has \"right wing DNA\" if you can believe it: [...]\n\nWhy Are You Still a Democrat? Democrats started the bloodiest war in American history so they could keep their slaves. General Grant admitted Black Americans to the Union Army, which was largely but gradually desegregated during the next thirty years, more in the west than in the east. After they lost the Civil War, Democrats founded the Terrorist Wing of the Democrat Party, more precisely known as the Ku Klux Klan. One of its founders, the talented Confederate cavalry general Nathan Bedford Forrest, left the group because it had become too violent — for a cavalry general! The Second Amendment was the only thing that prevented the KKK from murdering every freed slave. As freed slaves migrated away from the rural south, labor unions — distinct from craft and trade guilds — were formed in the 1870's to keep them out of the labor market. The practice is still remarkably effective. For example, in Philadelphia, blacks are 22% of the population, but less than 1% in the all-union construction jobs.\n\nBiden Interior Department Cuts Off Navajo Nation From Oil And Gas Development. President Joe Biden's Department of the Interior took another step this week to lock up 30 percent of the nation's land and waterways by 2030. On Friday, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced a 10-mile radius around the Chaco Cultural National Historical Park now cut off from new oil and gas leases despite local opposition to the new regulations. The 10-mile buffer around the American Indian historical site offers protections for existing leases but eliminates opportunities for new drilling for the next 20 years.\n\nThe Consequences of American Meritocracy in the Rearview. While some differences persist between races or between sexes, the reality is, Americans of all stripes have more opportunity than virtually any place on the planet. Indeed, black median household income in the United States ($38,800) is higher than that of every country in the world but four, while at the same time, the poorest 20% of Americans are richer on average than most Europeans. And the \"gender wage gap\" is gone, too. What's more, advancement is alive and well, demonstrated by the fact that 20% of America's richest citizens are self-made, starting their lives in poor households. The fact that 60% of are self-made from the middle class or below shows exactly how much opportunity there is in America. But a funny thing happened on the way to leaving stereotypes and its discrimination behind and focusing on content of character; the nation was hijacked by the party of the KKK and Jim Crow. Suddenly, at the very moment when America had achieved something very close to a true meritocracy, the modern Democrat put its only vehicle to power, the Victim Industrial Complex, into overdrive.\n\nWhite Democrats Like Joe Biden Are the Real Racists in America. In the Democrat fever dream, race relations in America are firmly rooted in 1958. In reality, the United States of America has had a two-term black president and, presently, a black vice president. We're obviously not doing the [racism] very well. The leftist \"white supremacy\" tale is not only utter garbage, but it's also destructive. It's the primary component of the Democrats' concerted effort to disenfranchise Republican voters. If they can portray everyone on the right as racist, they can scare all of the minority voters in America and make them vote for the party that pretends to care. The real racism in America is occurring on the left. Democrats pay lip service to minority needs and reap the benefits. It is a strategy that has mostly worked for years.\n\nChicago Democrats [are] in Trouble With Black Voters Over Migrant Invasion of South Side. Chicago got a lot more than it bargained for when the people voted for \"sanctuary city\" policies. Taking them at their word — that they would welcome hordes of illegal aliens — the governor of border state Texas, Greg Abbott, has been sending busloads of people who cross into his state illegally right to the heart of Chicago. It's the best idea anyone has come up with yet. Let the sanctuary cities become the new border towns! Let the blowhards who say it's inhumane to turn people away absorb them! Afterall, they're the compassionate ones, right? They're the ones who continually point the finger at the border state governors and criticize their reluctance to take on the never-ending human waves. So why, when they've now been given the chance to welcome them with open arms, is there trouble in sanctuary paradise?\n\nMore than two dozen lawsuits have been filed by former Planned Parenthood staff alleging racism. Planned Parenthood continues to face allegations of systemic racism as more former staffers file lawsuits and testify to poor treatment while working for the nation's number one abortion corporation. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that at least two dozen racial discrimination lawsuits have been filed against various Planned Parenthood affiliates, with staffers telling the outlet that racism is an inherent part of the company's culture.\n\nDemocrats Are The Nigerian Princes Of American Politics. For decades, Democrats told black Americans that Democrats were their champions when even a modicum of research would reveal that it was the Democrats who started a war to keep blacks in chains, fought the 13th, 14th, and15th Amendments, started the KKK, wrote Jim Crow laws, and filibustered the Civil Rights Act. It was the Democrats whose policies destroyed the nuclear black family and eviscerated cities like Detroit, Chicago, and others that were once engines of black advancement. It was the Democrats who called for defunding the police and for \"equity\" in the justice system, severing the connection between actions and consequences and leaving the blood of thousands of black Americans on streets across the country. And perhaps most treacherously of all, it was Democrats who told blacks that America is a systemically racist nation where they had no chance for success, sparking the worst racial tension in America in two generations. Proving their disdain for black voters, they tell black Americans their lives are at risk because of racist whites when every black person in America knows they have far more to fear from black males, and it's not even close.\n\nDemocrats love importing people to pick their crops. The Democratic Party appears to be obsessed with the idea that the best way to ensure that crops are picked by the \"right\" sort of people is to import them from somewhere else. For decades they fought to keep slavery a going concern — Africans, after all, were apparently the right sort of people to pick cotton. Now, according to Adam Schiff, we have to ensure an open southern border to ensure that people with a different skin colors remain the primary pickers of crops. Since cotton is no longer harvested by human hands, we are now talking about fruits and vegetables mainly. But the principle is the same, apparently. [Tweet]\n\nThe leftists manufacturing a Clarence Thomas scandal need a lesson in American government. Clarence Thomas is an unconquered American. He refused to let the segregation and poverty into which he was born define his life. He wouldn't let racists impose limits on him. He also wouldn't let leftists claim ownership of his mind or allegiance simply because they opposed segregation. They were enemies of freedom, too, only from another direction. Liberals have never forgiven him for refusing their patronage and their leash. They knew they could not count on him to support their view of abortion rights when George H.W. Bush nominated him to the Supreme Court in 1991. So they tried to stop his confirmation at any cost, using sexual allegations against him when questions about abortion failed to derail his nomination. Law was the segregationist's weapon. The media are the left's. Character assassination is a nonviolent way of keeping the defiant in line.\n\nObama Bad; Biden Worse. Let's face it, as America's First Black President, Barack Obama had the opportunity of the ages to put racial animosity to bed, and start a new age of comity. But he didn't. [...] Why didn't Obama bury the hatchet? It's simple. Ever since Marx, our educated rulers have practiced an over/under political formula, where the ruling educated class rules as the Ally of the Oppressed in a war against the enemy oppressors. If the working class are no longer the oppressed du jour, then blacks must be defended against racists, women against sexists, gays against homophobes, and now transgenders against the mighty armies of J.K. Rowling. Otherwise, what's the point of politics for Barack?\n\nForced Diversity Is Actively Harming America. [Scroll down] You see, the left-leaning ideologues that keep pushing down our throats the unproven claim that all people are absolutely equal — as opposed to equal under the law — despite plentiful evidence to the contrary will stop at nothing to \"prove\" their absurd theses and will not hesitate to sacrifice anyone or anything on their altar of equality. (See, for example, the fact Alvin Bragg's chief prosecutor has bragged about giving violent felons \"get-out-of-jail-free\" cards.) Left-leaning ideologues started on this trajectory by demanding that we must be racially \"color-blind\" so we wouldn't discriminate against racial minorities. Having achieved that goal, they immediately complained that this \"color blindness\" was insufficient because some racial minorities were still underperforming academically, professionally, or economically. It never occurred to them that their programs, rather than creating the perfect equitable equality they envisioned, would incentivize people in the preferred groups to decrease their efforts, whether academically, professionally, or economically.\n\nIt's Time for a National Conversation About Democrat Racism. The objective of a national conversation would be further exposure of the left's hypocrisy about all things race-related, rather than to change the minds of those guilty of it. Hopefully, such a conversation would lead to an increase in independents, fence-leaners, and other swing voters abandoning the Democrats. Anyway, let's take a trip in the Wayback Machine to October 11, 1991, when conservative Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas [...] was attacked by Democrat senators after a former co-worker accused Thomas of \"conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material\" and making inappropriate advances, which the soon-to-be associate justice vehemently and emotionally denied.\n\nHow the Left Uses Transgenders. In our current era of corporate fascism, which draws heavily on the Soviet playbook for tactics and procedures, many parallels are clear. Consider the Antifa and Black Lives Matter crowd. They function as the shock troops of the New Age. Yes, they're shielded from legal consequences of the sundry crimes they commit in the name of anti-racism. And their leaders and organizers are paid well and housed magnificently (there's good money in radical action, apparently). But do you think for a minute that once Klaus Schwab and George Soros and Bill Gates and the other world shakers have consolidated their Great Reset, the circle of leadership will include any of those desperate, face-pierced, pink-haired street urchins? The glass ceiling is even more evident when it comes to transgender activists.\n\nDemocrats Seek to Remove the only Black Male from the Supreme Court. The Democrat News-Media Complex (the DNC) has \"discovered\" another intolerable crisis that they hope may enable them to impeach the only black male, Clarence Thomas, on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in order to remove him from that position. That's so that Joe Biden can put perhaps another black woman on the court who doesn't know what a woman is, because that, not expertise in the Constitution, is the primary qualification for a SCOTUS seat by the Biden administration. AOC, given her zeal for \"social justice\" [that is, injustice], says she is willing to file the articles of impeachment herself. One might normally think that removing the only black male on the Court is a clear case of racism, but it is not because AOC is a Democrat and socialist and Justice Thomas is a Republican. Anyone who disagrees is a racist.\n\nAs the Chicago Mayoral Election Proves, Blue Cities Have Become Modern-day Jonestowns. As PJ Media's Rick Moran reported, the Chicago mayoral runoff on April 4 went the way of the teachers unions, which drove a massive turnout campaign for their anointed radical candidate: [...] The only quibble one might have with Rick's article is that the State of Oregon has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the teachers unions and SEIU since the turn of the century, so Chicago may not be able to lay claim to first-in-the-nation status. His conclusion is, however, spot on: radical leftists defeated a moderate who wanted to rein in Chicago's laughably awful violent crime and education failures. One could go even further in what this portends for Chicago and other deep blue cities across America: they've devolved so far into cultish adherence to radical ideology that they have become modern-day Jonestowns.\n\nMissouri Republican Buries Racist Democrat with EPIC Response When Questioned About His Ethnicity. Black Missouri Republican State Rep. Justin Hicks was peppered with vicious questions from a racist Democrat about his ethnicity for daring to support a bill that would hamstring the woke left's divisive racial agenda. But Hicks had an epic and true response that buried his hater and won the admiration of his colleagues. Last Thursday, Democrat State Rep. Marlene Terry questioned whether Hicks really was black after the Republican said he said he supported a bill called which bars state funding for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities for Missouri's departments of agriculture, natural resources and conservation. Specifically, the legislation blocks funding for staff, vendors, consultants and programs \"associated with diversity, equity (and) inclusion\" throughout state government and public colleges and universities according to Fox News. The prohibitions also apply to other woke initiatives that promote \"collective guilt,\" \"the concept that disparities are necessarily tied to oppression,\" and \"intersectional or divisive identity activism.\"\n\nBiden Executive Order on Equity Rhymes With Jim Crow. President Biden recently issued an executive order entitled \"Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\" Make no mistake: this executive order has the effect of pushing us backward toward a racially divided nation, just like the good old days. What a shame. Not thirty years ago, a very different spirit animated civil rights. Call it the Martin Luther King vision. Dr. King's vision was fundamentally the Christian one, where every person has dignity, where racism is a sin, where race matters not at all compared to character. Dr. King held the moral high ground here. His vision ushered in a few short decades of getting it right. America had just emerged from two centuries as a nation embracing the opposite of Dr. King's vision. First human slavery, then violent, racially motivated lawlessness ruled the night.\n\nEight Startling and Uncomfortable Ways the Democrat Party Emulates the Nazi Party. First, racial and ethnic division was a central component of Nazi political strategy and philosophy. The Nazi Party was the most racially obsessed political party in human history. Today's Democrat party is second only to the Nazi Party in their racial obsession. Every piece of legislation, every accusation against their opponents, every aspect of American society, even weather and climate are framed in imaginary racism. The Nazi Party's obsession focused on their perverted belief in the inferiority and superiority of the races or ethnicities. This opened the door for blaming a specific ethnic group for all the problems facing their country. The Democrat party is claiming the root cause of virtually all problems facing this nation is \"systemic racism\" as theoretically instigated by one particular race.\n\nIs The Left Harnessing Fake Antisemitic Attacks To Silence Americans' Speech? \"Speech, expression and assembly\" represent the triumvirate for truth. Short of breaking existing laws around physical violence and incitement to physical violence, the more we have of all three, the closer we come to that more perfect union, offering the most freedom for the most people with the least government interference. But in an age of internet technology with deep fakes, bots, hacks, and myriad pathways to craft and deliver mis- and dis-information, radical left-wingers can abuse and use those liberties to tarnish conservatives, desensitize our communities to certain phenomena, and squelch our freedoms. It behooves individuals, our government, and even watchdog organizations to pause before reacting to information from somewhere on the internet.\n\nDemocrats Were the Party of Segregation Years Ago, and they Still Are Today. When Joe Biden made his recent comments regarding working with segregationist Democrats decades ago, the backlash from his 2020 rivals was expected. As the current frontrunner by a wide margin, his primary opponents are desperately hoping to find something that will knock him down and give them a chance to emerge from their single-digit polling. But, what no one seems to be talking about is the hypocrisy of the Democrat outrage over Biden's comments. It would be nice to think that Democrats, who were the party of segregation fifty years ago, have learned the evils of separating people by race, ethnicity, religion, etc., but they actually have not. They were the party of segregation back then, and they are the party of segregation today. Segregation is happening right now, voluntarily, across the country, in public and private institutions dominated by liberals, who preach equality and diversity but can't quite figure out how to practice what they preach.\n\nBiden Slammed over 'White Boy' Remark During Event Marking Black History Month: 'Most Racist President... Since LBJ'. President Joe Biden faced a wave of backlash over what was deemed a \"racist\" comment of his implying that white men are unintelligent, after stating, \"I may be a white boy, but I'm not stupid,\" at a reception honoring African Americans throughout the country's history. During a White House reception marking Black History Month on Monday, President Biden stated that \"black history matters\" after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis reportedly rejected a high school Advance Placement course for African American studies following his \"Stop Woke Act,\" which aims to ban Critical Race Theory (CRT) in the state's public schools.\n\n'Equity' Is Not Equality — It's Revenge. This strain of stubborn hatred is the same stuff that kept blood feuds hot between the Hatfields and the McCoys for nearly three decades. It blinded the Hutus of Rwanda into butchering 800,000 innocent Tutsis in 1994. It's why Arab hatred of Israel seethes as fresh today as it did in the 1940s. And it's the same combustible stuff that Democrats, activists, and global technocrats use to drench the public discourse with an old history that inflames black anger toward whites. \"Innocent men, women and children hung by a noose from trees,\" said Joe Biden last week at a White House screening of a new film about Emmett Till. \"... bodies burned, drowned, castrated, lynched for simply being black — nothing more. With white crowds, white families gathered to celebrate the spectacle, taking pictures of the bodies and mailing them as postcards. Hard to believe that's what was done. There's some people still want to do that.\" Still? Who, Joe? Not a single soul, of course. \"Some people\" are ghosts. There's so little white racism today that Biden and his ilk are reduced to jerry-rigging tragic history to grossly distorted current events to create menacing white racist devils that do not exist: \"white privilege,\" \"systemic racism,\" and \"white supremacy.\" It's so infuriating because \"some people still want to do that\" is a hideous lie that digs into long-healed racial wounds. A new generation of Americans is being drenched with this stuff, for no good reason, in the name of achieving racial \"equity.\"\n\nThe collapse of civilization on the altar of equity and diversity. Talent and merit has nothing to do with race, but the left does not accept that fact. It is the left that is truly racist; Joe Biden has long been one of the worst racists in Congress. Watch his attempted humiliation of Clarence Thomas at his confirmation hearing to see just how racist Biden is. Thomas is a towering intellect with an IQ twice that of poor old Joe's. But like most people who are both stupid and arrogant, they never recognize brilliance in others. They only know they resent such people but they don't know why.\n\nThe Takedown of Anna Paulina Luna Is Not Going as Planned. Since the legacy media is running out of fodder on NY Rep. George Santos, The Washington Post decided it needed to set its investigative sites on the freshman representative from Florida, Anna Paulina Luna. Luna has been making her mark among the newly-minted GOP House. Luna was one of the gang of 20 who held House Speaker McCarthy's feet to the fire on the Rules package in order for him to secure her vote for his speakership. Luna is causing her Democrat colleagues to clutch their pearls over her 2A stance and asserting her right to carry her firearm within the meeting chambers. Luna publicly joined Reps. Andrew Clyde and George Santos in wearing an AR-15 lapel pin to show her support of 2A rights, and she is cutting a swath on the House Oversight Committee with her targeted grilling of those testifying on the floor. The WaPo hit piece is the usual drivel of anonymous sources, interviews with associates that are supposedly dear friends, distant cousins, and hair-splitting hyperbole to make Luna's story and background as questionable as possible.\n\nBiden Caught In Yet Another Lie. President Joe Biden has told lie after lie, getting caught each time. You'd think he'd learned his lesson by now. In yet another fabrication of his, Biden claimed that he attended a black church in Delaware every morning after he attended Catholic mass in high school, despite members of the church not being able to recall the president ever being there.\n\nWhat does \"sanctuary city\" really mean?\n\nMayors Adams and Lightfoot demand Colorado stop sending migrants. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis informed New York City this week that he'd be sending more buses full of migrants in the near future. The story made news after Mayor Adams of NYC complained about it during a radio interview Tuesday. But according to Gov. Polis, the buses full of migrants aren't new. He's been \"helping asylum seekers reach their final destinations\" for weeks. He says there is a backlog of migrants wanting to leave Denver and head to New York but because of a recent storm they were stuck in Denver. Now he's trying to undo that backlog.\n\nHistory Of The Democrats And The KKK. The original targets of the Ku Klux Klan were Republicans, both black and white, according to a new television program and book, which describe how the Democrats started the KKK and for decades harassed the GOP with lynchings and threats. An estimated 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites died at the end of KKK ropes from 1882 to 1964. The original targets of the Ku Klux Klan were Republicans, both black and white, according to a new television program and book, which describe how the Democrats started the KKK and for decades harassed the GOP with lynchings and threats. An estimated 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites died at the end of KKK ropes from 1882 to 1964. The documentation has been assembled by David Barton of Wallbuilders and published in his book \"Setting the Record Straight: American History in Black & White,\" which reveals that not only did the Democrats work hand-in-glove with the Ku Klux Klan for generations, they started the KKK and endorsed its mayhem. \"Of all forms of violent intimidation, lynchings were by far the most effective,\" Barton said in his book. \"Republicans often led the efforts to pass federal anti-lynching laws and their platforms consistently called for a ban on lynching. Democrats successfully blocked those bills and their platforms never did condemn lynchings.\" Further, the first grand wizard of the KKK was honored at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, no Democrats voted for the 14th Amendment to grant citizenship to former slaves and, to this day, the party website ignores those decades of racism, he said.\n\nIt's not racism that's destroying American communities. Democrats know what's destroying inner-city communities: Systemic racism (including in prison sentences), the lack of reparations, police violence, the lack of organic groceries, and AR-15s. None of this is true, of course, but it's the snake oil they're peddling and, sadly, a lot of people within these inner-city communities seem to buy it because they keep voting for the same old Democrats. (Maxine Waters, anyone?) Will Scharf, an Assistant U.S. Attorney who works in the violent crimes unit in St. Louis, Missouri, America's most dangerous city, has a different take on what's going on. It won't surprise you, of course, to learn that the Democrats are wrong in every respect.\n\nLegalizing illegals vs. having babies. On Nov. 16, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., stated that the United States needed more immigrants to offset the low birth rate of Americans. He added that because of the low birth rate, the U.S. needed to provide a path to citizenship for illegal aliens (somewhere between 11 and 40 million of them now in the country) and for \"Dreamers.\" Bloomberg Business Week pointed out Nov. 7 how the birth rate in America is too low to sustain and grow the population and that the poorest and least-educated countries have the higher birth rates. The countries that can afford children have the lowest birth rates, while those countries that can least afford them have the highest. In \"The Demographic Cliff,\" Harry Dent pointed out almost 20 years ago that the low birth rates in Caucasian countries, industrialized countries, would cause tremendous problems. The Caucasian portion of the world's population fell from 25% to 10% in just 30 years.\n\nJoe Biden: Historic Black Universities Are 'Just as Smart' as Other Colleges. President Joe Biden concluded his political rallies for the midterms at a historically black university in Maryland, telling students they were \"just as smart\" as other colleges in the United States. Biden defended the \"historic\" $5.8 billion in funding he budgeted for HBCUs as presi"
