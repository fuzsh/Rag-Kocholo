        "text": "LOVE RUNS EVERYTHING\n\nIt’s a difficult thing to describe a character like avant-pop perpetuator Sean Nicholas Savage and do him justice. Poetry and romance is in his very essence, so it seems only natural, then, that he is an exemplary of music that is saturated in emotions. Too classic to be considered overrated, too forward-thinking to be passé, Savage’s musical auteurism cultivates a kind of pseudo-nostalgia, yearning for something that you were never sure was there in the first place. Managing to track him down after recording in Germany, I wrote to him, hoping to gain insight into Savage’s complexities.\n\nBeatRoute: What have you been focusing on since the release of Other Life?\n\nSean Nicholas Savage: I toured a lot this year, put a band together for most of that in Europe and I just finished recording a new record, that I took my time writing.\n\nBR: Your repertoire is extensive with nine albums to your name. How do you figure that you’re able to do this — can you describe this relationship with your music? How about the music you listen to?\n\nSNS: I go through hard phases of listening to a few things that really inspire me every month or so, I think that’s a common thing. My relationship to my music is a deep, deep love and I was thinking about this actually recently, having been doing this recent recording. Lyrically, I’m always capturing some potent moment in my life in a song, so I am starting to feel like a real beat up old truck, having all of these serious and beautiful pieces of my life up on the walls, y’know? And that’s exactly how I need to live.\n\nBR: Your music is so expressive and emotionally bare, how or why is this the crux of your performances? Have you ever felt uncomfortable being so vivid and intimate?\n\nSNS: Thank you. I get so paranoid and I can be mean and just tear everything down. I really do that often actually, but these just performances and recordings of experiences and themes in my life, stand up, even against me. I guess, the more raw, the less control, the less touched, the less I can question it. So, I’m most comfortable and least tripped out when I’m naked doing this.\n\nBR: To further the previous question, do you pull from everyday experiences to create your lyrics, or are they made up of more profound moments? What is profound for Sean Nicholas Savage?\n\nSNS: Sex is so profound, I was just thinking about sex. I can’t believe these people on the streets, they’re all so damn sexy, I mean every one of ‘em, no matter how and they all want to get together with somebody, and they all have their culture and desires, and sometimes I can’t believe that “love” is truly running every damn thing. Even hate is only a love shadow really, yin and yang, that is profound.\n\nBR: Being a primarily solo artist, can you explain your creative process in the context of others, through collaboration and with the Arbutus Records family?\n\nSNS: I write poems and rants and I rant all the time. I’m pretty restless, I hate sleeping and, when I sleep, I dream hard. I like to write right out of a dream, or fantasize within the plot of a dream and write that. Also, closing my eyes — you know when you’re very tired or wasted and you’ve got supercharged imagination? I write the words like that sometimes. Then the music is always changing based on so many things: where I’m at, where my people are at, where music’s at, where my mp3′s at?\n\nBR: Do you ever find that your tendencies/affinities change mid-album? How do you adapt to these changes in how you make music?\n\nSNS: They always change a few times, that’s very important. You start out 1d and end up hopefully in 4 or 5d. It’s a journey, through the heart and through time.\n\nBR: What sorts of difficulties have you been confronted with in the making of this album? Are they familiar, as in the same difficulties that you’ve had in the past with other albums, or are they newfound?\n\nSNS: Other Life was very difficult, due to personal problems of every kind last year: love life, family life, my health, etc. I write all kinds of songs, but I don’t typically release “bummer tracks” and I wrote mostly bummer tracks last year. I didn’t know what to do for the sound with what I had and I was under a lot of dirty pressure, just out of circumstances. It’s good though, man, more than “I love myself,” right? So, I’m still pleased looking back. The artwork says it all.\n\nBR: I read that you are studying/sampling cinematic soundtracks during the making of your newest record. How have they helped in shaping the new songs/album? What are you trying to convey in this album that differs from the past records?\n\nSNS: I’m not sampling, but I am really interested in soundtracks. I like my recordings to be able to sit right where they belong in the event of listening, if people are chilling, talking, eating, my album’s the soundtrack, but if they want to take a close listen, it’s all there. That’s the idea, anyways.\n\nCatch Sean Nicholas Savage at Republik (Calgary) on December 13 and at Artery (Edmonton) on December 14.\n\nBy Nivedita Iyer\n\nAUFECT & 314 (Patrick Cure)\n\nBeatRoute: Favourite Aufect/314 show of 2013?\n\nPatrick Cure: There were definitely a few contenders to choose from between Addison Groove, Myrryrs, Distal and Clicks & Whistles, but my favourite show of the year was probably our last one featuring Hesk (Montreal) and Krueger (Philly). It was not just the performers of the night, but the sweaty “rave den” venue (UnderG) and the vibes everyone brought. There is something special about cramming a bunch of people into a hot, grimy after-hours spot and dancing until the sun comes up.\n\nBR: Favourite artist of 2013?\n\nPC: This is a tough question for sure. There were so many artists that inspired me this year, especially after taking in what the festival circuit had to offer. I am going to have to go with Om Unit on this one, mainly due to his incredible performance at Bass Coast this year. He is a DJ’s DJ, flawlessly leading you through an inter-dimensional mission of multiple BPMs and genres blended seamlessly. It doesn’t hurt that he has dished out a string of mind-blowing releases over the last six months on labels including Metalheadz and his own imprint, Cosmic Bridge.\n\nBR: Things you’re excited about for 2014?\n\nPC: 2014 is definitely going to be an exciting year. I have personally made a point to get out of admin mode and back into producer/artist mode over the last year, and will be releasing my first solo EP on Aufect, Hold Up, featuring remixes by Self Evident, Dan Solo and a couple others. Another big release coming out will be Philthkids’ Ordinateur featuring remixes from myself, as well as Atlanta’s Distal. You can also expect to hear Aufect experimenting with new genres and hybrid mutations we haven’t touched yet.\n\nINTIMATE (JJ)\n\nBR: Favourite Intimate show of 2013?\n\nJJ: For 2013, Guy Gerber, whom we hosted at Electric Owl on Saturday, November 9th, would have to be the most memorable for Intimate Productions; not for the sold out, extremely receptive crowd, but for the surprise extended set Guy performed into the wee hours of the morning that virtually everyone stayed on till the end for.\n\nBR: Favourite artist of 2013?\n\nJJ: There are so many artists to choose from whom we’ve been excited for and seen rise in 2013 and even been lucky enough to host, from Maceo Plex to Seth Troxler to numerous others. But for 2013, perhaps my own favourite moment came from legends Daft Punk with their release of Random Access Memories, which, although panned by some, I think was a real tribute to the birth of electronica music.\n\nBR: Things you’re excited about for 2014?\n\nJJ: With a recent trip to Ibiza in the summer of 2013 meeting a slew of artists, we’re excited to debut a number of international artists in Vancouver in 2014 that are making waves throughout the globe in the electronica scene.\n\nSHAHDJS (Willis)\n\nBR: Favourite SHAH show of 2013?\n\nWillis: Favourite SHAH show of 2013 musically was S.P.Y. at Red Room with Daega Sound. Daega, as always, delivers, and this was one of the first times seeing them since I found out they were playing D’n’B now, but wow, did S.P.Y. ever surpass my expectations. Looking to bring him back in 2014. As for overall hype, the Ed Rush & Optical show also at Red Room was out of control.\n\nBR: Favourite artist of 2013?\n\nW: Favourite artist of 2013 is tough; it’s been such a huge breakthrough year for D’n’B in general, tons of artists going deeper and really exploring some new vibes and patterns. I guess if I have to give one name it’s Om Unit, the dude absolutely owned Bass Coast for me and most people I spoke to would agree. Amit gets honourable mention, and Exit Records in general gets huge props for everything they touch.\n\nBR: Things you’re excited about for 2014?\n\nW: 2014 is going to be an interesting year. Drum and bass has really picked up lately with Digital Motion bringing a steady stream of big names, SHAH has stayed steady, and Blueprint and Twisted have been bringing in some big names too. In a way it was easier when it was less popular. I’m excited though, with these other shows taking care of some more mainstream stuff, SHAH’s gonna be focusing more on the deeper side of things. We’ve already started that shift working with Fractured Technique on the Abyss series featuring Loxy and dBridge so far, plus Lighta! for Om Unit, and now looking at artists like Jubei, Blu Mar Ten, Spectrasoul for the new year.\n\nLIGHTA! (Michael Red)\n\nBR: Favourite Lighta! show of 2013?\n\nMichael Red: Self Evident and Max Ulis have thrown the bulk of events under the Lighta! banner this year. The Lighta! Sound x Chapel Sound takeover at Fortune was a 2013 highlight. It was just such an appropriate pairing that was inevitable and just waiting to happen, such good vibes. The May Full Moon Party at Open Studios was another big highlight; people cheering for minutes on end when the lights came on. Proper old school jungle music will do that.\n\nBR: Favourite artist of 2013?\n\nMR: One of the most stand-out artists of 2013 would be Kelela. Her free mixtape “Cut 4 Me” is almost flawless, and so uplifting. It feels effortless but has such strength. Being so obviously ahead of the curve while remaining accessible is admirable.\n\nBR: Things you’re excited about for 2014?\n\nMR: The Lighta! December 14 event @ Open Studios is a sure bet I’d think. I’ll be doing some leftfield lounge type events under the Low Indigo banner, myself. I know those Ulis have got some nice headliners they’re working on too. I’m already looking forward to the next Bass Coast and New Forms, to be honest.\n\nBLUEPRINT (Matt)\n\nBR: Favourite Blueprint show of 2013?\n\nMatt: This is such a tough one. So many special/memorable shows! One that comes to mind is the closing party we did with our friends at the Waldorf in January. We had actually booked Groundislava & Ryan Hemsworth to play there far in advance, and when they got the news they had to shut the doors, our show just so happened to fall on their final weekend of being open. Was a bittersweet start to the year, but a great show that people still talk about. Mykki Blanco & LE1F at Celebrities were both fantastic live shows we put on as well. I’m also extremely excited about Contact Festival, which has yet to happen, but as the biggest event we’ve ever done, I’m predicting it’ll be up there as a pretty memorable one!\n\nBR: Favourite artist of 2013?\n\nM: As far as pure listening goes, I basically ate up everything Dev Hynes a.k.a. Blood Orange put his hands on this year. He’s an immensely talented songwriter who makes magic with other artists and also puts out insanely good material himself. Favourite song of the year is definitely UOENO by Rocko. I mean that BEAT… and FUTURE on the hook! Also a shitload of talented electronic music producers seem to have come out of nowhere in Vancouver and that is AWESOME!\n\nBR: Things you’re excited about for 2014?\n\nM: Expect the venue situation in Vancouver to have a nice new addition. In general terms, I’d say expect to see more diverse bookings that reflect how broad our tastes are as music lovers. We’re known for being dance music promoters, but we made big strides this year in diversifying our bookings and will continue to do so next. As far as music trends go, hopefully rap music will continue to be awesome & 100bpm is an exciting tempo that should breathe new life into club music. Also expect lots and lots of good old-fashioned HOUSE MUSIC resonating with people again!\n\nCompiled by Andy Soloman\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of SHAHdjs / Digital Motion\n\nClick to view slideshow.\n\nEvery year feels like the best year in metal and 2013 was no exception. To discuss what shone the brightest, the Shrapnel team sent each other one too many emails to discuss and debate. Involved in the conversation was Blackrat guitarist and vocalist Ian Lemke, Chieftain and Frightenstein drummer Tanner Wolff, Hellborn Death Engines guitarist Brandon McNeil and Smolder drummer Sarah Kitteringham, all regular Shrapnel contributors. Given that we’re all pals and drunken shit heads, some of it was self-celebratory. Mostly though, it was a celebration of all the incredible metal, extreme and otherwise, which came out or was performed in front of us this year.\n\nSarah Kitteringham: It feels like 2013 has been the best year for metal in a long time. It might be because our metal scene is among the strongest and biggest in Canada. It’s also because between four of us, when we compiled our list of our 10 favourite albums, there were only a handful of overlaps. As for local bands, we had great records from across the spectrum! The Weir, WAKE, Sigil, Blackrat, Gatekrashör, False Flag, Chron Goblin, Vile Insignia, Doberman, Phantom Limb, Exit Strategy, Bloated Pig, 10 other bands… all of you put out strong albums. Our many, many rip roaring local shows reflected this.\n\nIan Lemke: Noctis is an obvious frontrunner for best show every year, but in all honesty last year’s lineup was rather more up my alley. Still, Possessed, Barbatos, Satan’s Satyrs and Bölzer meant the seven-year-old fest had a proper burial. Next to Noctis, J. Destroyer’s (Savage Streets, Fornication) Fuck Off Life proved that you don’t have to fly bands from across the globe to have a ripping time. Ominosity, BurialKult, and Runeblade were highlights. Can’t wait to see what madness ensues next year, Satan willing.\n\nTanner Wolff: Calgary’s thriving metal scene has always had somewhat of a dual community, but 2013 marks the year where both sub-communities have had plenty to look forward to. Whether you bought your Calgary Metal Fest three-day pass weeks in advance or you were more drawn to the stellar Fuck Off Life festival, there was something for you. This has continued almost every weekend. Multiple venues hosted metal bands, and frequently three shows a night were going on, and all of them had high attendance. Division and specification can be a healthy thing in such a large system as the Calgary metal community.\n\nSK: True. I’ve been getting more and more into the extreme, dark side of things when it comes to Calgary bands, so certain gigs stand out for the music as much as the drunken shenanigans and broken glass. As for Noctis, I think it was pitch perfect: can’t complain whatsoever about seeing Bölzer, Candlemass, Girlschool, Carcass and Exciter. Blasphemy was hugely anticipated, but unsurprisingly, and somewhat disappointingly, sloppy. As for other festivals, at Roadburn Festival, Asphyx and the Ruins of Beverast were highlights. Maryland Death Festival was a blast. Seeing Cobalt, Bolt Thrower, Pagan Altar… Damn.\n\nIL: My own personal trip to The Gorge in Washington to see Black Sabbath for the first, and probably last time, was the misadventure of a lifetime, not entirely relating to the music. An adequate performance with almost the original lineup was the climax of a ten-day binge which took us to the EMP museum in Seattle, all-night bowling alleys, illegal sand-dune campsites infested with meth dealers, and tetanus-inducing squatter hangouts. But I digress! One hundred long stories short, 2013 ruled.\n\nSK: Pretty much. Trying to even cull my best of list down to ten albums was a problem. Doom is my one and only true love, so I was drooling this entire year over everything from classic doom, to weird-ass hybrid bands. Magic Circle’s Magic Circle, Sacriphyx’s All Quiet on the Western Front, Ruins of Beverast’s Blood Vaults – The Blazing Gospel of Heinrich Kramer, Procession’s To Reap Heavens Apart, Funeral Circle’s Funeral Circle, and House of Atreus’ Into the Brazen Bull were amazing. I can’t recommend Atlantean Kodex’s The White Goddess (A Grammar of Poetic Myth) enough. Inquisition’s Season of Mist debut slayed. So did Bölzer’s Aura EP, Portal’s Vexovoid, Cult of Fire’s मृत्युकातापसीअनुध्यान and Canadian black metallers Monarque’s Lys Noir. Darkthrone’s The Underground Resistance features some serious metal anthems. Don’t like it? FOAD!\n\nTW: Gorguts’ Colored Sands, Carcass’ Surgical Steel, Nocturnal Graves’ …From the Bloodline of Cain, Abyssal’s Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius, Exhumed’s Necrocracy, and Cult of Luna’s Vertikal should be added to the list.\n\nBrandon McNeil: Revocation wins this round, hands down and probably for the foreseeable future. The amount of technical musicianship, unique style and flat-out boner-inspiring guitar work that Dave Davidson and the gang crammed into that record is downright terrifying to an up-and-comer like myself. We’ve all got to step our game really hard if we’re ever going to compare to that. Other than that, I really dug The Black Dahlia Murder’s Everblack, Motörhead’s Aftershock, Kalmah’s Seventh Swamphony, and Death Angel’s The Dream Calls For Blood.\n\nIL: There were going to be some overlaps, but too many good albums need mentioning. So, I’m throwing my votes in for Shitfucker’s Suck Cocks In Hell, Vastum’s Patricidal Lust, Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats’ Mind Control and Nekrofilth’s Devil’s Breath. Alongside those, I really dug Obliteration’s Black Death Horizon, Condor’s Condor, Witchgrave’s Witchgrave, and Burialkult’s A Call From Beyond the Grave.\n\nSK: So much variety. It’s almost a bit insane to see that. I thought by this point the quality and thus popularity of doom metal that really has been peaking since 2007 would have tapered off. Not so. Also, death metal seemed pretty stagnant last year. This year, it seems like a lot of people are playing with the template and making seriously innovative music. As per usual, black metal was consistent. But that’s not to say everything has been great: I’m already getting sick of some of the Canadian NWOTHM bands. Not Iron Dogs though. They do it right. There have been a few other shitty things about 2013 too.\n\nIL: Torment in Fire’s abrupt cancellation was the biggest bummer, as well as the new tour tax, although I think its effects are yet to be truly felt. Also, I don’t think the end of Noctis will totally sink in until next September, which I’m sure will be a depressing time for all of us. Hopefully, something else fills its massive void. Only time will tell.\n\nBM: I’m going to go with this year being overflowed with garbage, down tuned “djent” releases. Dave Brockie did an interview recently and referred to the stuff as “sounding like a bunch of instruments being thrown down the stairs” and he’s absolutely right. All these bands like Veil of Maya, Periphery, Rings of Saturn, Born Of Osiris and their ilk can take their stupid, new wave, post-prog nonsense and let the next fad come in anytime now.\n\nTW: For 2014, I am making an honest effort to have very few expectations. This affords me the ability to be surprised and lends a sense of purity to the year. I am extremely proud and excited to be releasing a record with Chieftain and I can’t wait to see what the year holds in store for my talented friends in countless bands across this city. I am confidant the community’s lust for heavy metal and less than sober shenanigans will prevail and make 2014 a rad year all around. Up the horns and keep it fast and loud!\n\nBy Team Shrapnel\n\nLive photos: Sarah Kitteringham\n\nTHE HIGHS, THE LOWS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN\n\nBC EDITORS’ LISTS\n\nGlenn Alderson – Editor-In-Chief\n\nBEST ALBUM\n\nDrake – NWTS\n\nNot everyone can fuck with Drake, it’s a fact. But those who do know there are so many different ways to take in the enigma that is NWTS. Drizzy unearthed this gem back in September and nothing really has been the same for me since. #yragoodgirlanduknowit\n\n(Runners Up: Lorde – Pure Heroin, Joanna Gruesome – Weird Sister, Shawn Mrazek Lives! – Thought He Was Dead)\n\nBest Song\n\nPusha T – “Numbers On The Boards”\n\nCamille Vega, our go-to rap correspondent at BeatRoute, dropped this song in the car on our way to Rifflandia Festival and it’s been on every one of my playlists since. Pusha T may have Kanye to thank for the next level beat that this song rides on but everything about this banger is dope.\n\n(Runners Up: Blood Orange “You’re Not Good Enough”, A$AP Ferg “Shabba feat. A$AP Rocky”, BESTiE “Asleep On The Bus”)\n\nBest Live Show\n\nSaves The Day – September 7 @ The Biltmore Cabaret\n\nSometimes you just have to let nostalgia take its course. Through Being Cool was a very important album for me at one point in time and when these New Jersey emos rolled through the Biltmore they basically played it in its entirety. I was probably way more stoked than I should have been that night but thankfully everyone else in attendance was just as lame as me.\n\n(Runners Up: Screaming Females – Nov. 14 @ The Media Club, Built To Spill – February 6 @ The Rickshaw Theatre, Destroyer – Nov. 3 @ Mississippi Studios)\n\nBest Movie\n\nSpring Breakers\n\nLook at all my shit! This movie is errything I hoped it would be. My friends and I drove to Bellingham to see it one week before its Canadian release and I’m glad we did. James Franco is hilarious and babes in bikinis with machine guns is exactly where I was hoping Harmony Korine would take his next cinematic outing.\n\n(Runners Up: Blue Jasmine, Place Beyond The Pines, Now You See Me)\n\nBest Non-Musical Moment\n\nWatching Tristan Orchard get a “bb” stick-n-poke in my living room from VICE senior editor Ben Shapiro. Still kills me every time I think about it. Woof.\n\nJoshua Erickson – Managing Editor\n\nBest Album\n\nThe Knife – Shaking The Habitual\n\nAt a staggering 96 minutes in length, this album is not for the faint of heart, but it’s remarkable nonetheless. Shaking The Habitual is full of massive, lush synth landscapes that are equally beautiful and terrifying, industrial jams, and tribal/jungle-esque percussion. This is the Swedish duo’s most abrasive work yet, and you get the feeling you are actively being confronted. It is a challenging listen, but one that is incredibly rewarding.\n\n(Runners up: Savages – Silence Yourself, Deafheaven – Sunbather, Disclosure – Settle, Run The Jewels – Run The Jewels)\n\nBest Song\n\nArcade Fire – “Reflektor”\n\nThere has always had a grandiose quality to Arcade Fire’s music, but with “Reflektor” they have loosened up and abandoned their earnest yearnings. Arcade Fire continues to be one of the most fascinating and exciting bands around today, and a huge part of that is their ability to constantly reinvent themselves without sounding contrived or tired. Plus this track is groovy as hell.\n\n(Runners up: Kanye West – “Black Skinhead,” The So So Glos – “Wrecking Ball,” FIDLAR – “Cheap Beer,” Darkside – “Paper Trails”\n\nBest Live Show\n\nCoachella Valley Music Festival\n\nI know this is kind of cheating but Coachella is awesome, so whatever. Highlights were Violent Femmes, Savages, Jurassic 5, Wu-Tang Clan, and Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds.\n\n(Runners up: Neutral Milk Hotel @ Mountain Oasis Music Festival; Titus Andronicus @ The Media Club)\n\nBest Movie\n\nGravity\n\nThis film is an absolute thrill-ride. With amazing special effects, motion sickness-inducing filming, and a storyline FAR more compelling than it had any right to be considering the concept, Gravity was my runaway favourite this year.\n\n(Runners Up: Spring Breakers, Jurassic Park 3D)\n\nBest Non-Musical Moment\n\nMy band’s album release show at the Cobalt. It was amazing to see so many friends, family and fans in one place. The place was packed, the crowd energy was incredible, and we played one of, if not the best set of our lives. I crowd surfed AND it totally didn’t turn out like Jack Black’s attempted crowd surf at the beginning of School of Rock. An incredible and overwhelming enjoyable night. OK, this is music related… but I think this is an exception.\n\nCamille Vega – Marketing and Events Coordinator\n\nBEST ALBUM\n\nChance the Rapper – Acid Rap\n\nI’m surprised that Chance the Rapper isn’t ruling the entire hip-hop world right now. This 20-year-old Chicago native has bars for days. Acid Rap bounces around from hard-hitting baselines to soft, spoken-word poetry in front of easy, mellow beats.\n\n(Runners up: Earl Sweatshirt – Doris, James Blake – Overgrown, Johnny Rain – Lullaby of Machine, Run The Jewels – s/t)\n\nBEST SONG\n\nTory Lanez – Icey Dicey\n\nThis beat is infectious. It’s filthy and full of life, the perfect backing to the spit-game that is 20-year-old Torontonian Tory Lanez’s own. It’s much more than just a club-banger and has been overlooked one too many times.\n\n(Runners up: Pusha T – “Suicide ft. Ab-Liva”, Lorde – “Glory and Gore”, Childish Gambino – “3005”, Ta-Ku – “We Were In Love”)\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW\n\nMykki Blanco at Club 919 in Victoria, BC – September 12th, 2013\n\nWhen I interviewed Mykki for the June issue of BeatRoute I couldn’t have had a better time. Mykki’s live show was flawless when I caught her at Rifflandia. Her energy on stage is something unlike anything I’ve experienced, from crowd-surfing to jumping on top of tables, there wasn’t much else missing. Did I mention she did all of this in lingerie and a weave?\n\n(Runners Up: James Blake at The Commodore – April 25th, 2013, A$AP Ferg at Fortune Sound Club – November 10th, 2013)\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nThe Conjuring\n\nAs a horror movie fanatic, I suppose it has the same look as most horror movies do, a lot of “noise” scare tactic and not enough actual plot-line, character development, etc. This couldn’t be further from the truth. James Wan, the dark mastermind behind Insidious and Insidious Chapter 2, gave me more than chills.\n\n(Runners Up: World War Z, Fruitvale Station)\n\nBEST NON-MUSICAL MOMENT\n\nThis year has given me the hobby of writing professionally. What makes this even sweeter of a year is that I went out and sought every single writing gig I have today. It’s a creative outlet unlike any other, and I love it for no reason other than I get to listen to stories told by some of the greatest people in my generation and relay them to whomever takes the time to read. Everyone has a story, myself included, and no two are alike… so let me tell you one.\n\nAlex Hudson – Local and Live Editor\n\nBEST ALBUM\n\nDirty Beaches – Love Is the Devil\n\nMy favourite musical memory of 2013 is the unseasonably warm week in spring that I spent sweating my ass of in my grandparents’ attic in London, ON, while listening to Dirty Beaches’ experimental opus Love Is the Devil on repeat.\n\n(Runners up: Kanye West – Yeezus, HAIM – Days Are Gone, Nicholas Krgovich – Who Cares?, Boards of Canada – Tomorrow’s Harvest)\n\nBEST SONG\n\nDaft Punk – “Get Lucky”\n\nAround the time “Get Lucky” came out, I hosted one leg of a party crawl; for the entire 45 minutes that everyone was at my house, we listened to this song on repeat. No one complained.\n\n(Runners up: HAIM – “If I Could Change Your Mind,” Sean Nicholas Savage – “Other Life,” Drake – “Hold On, We’re Going Home,” Gal Gracen – “Sylvan Tragedy”)\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW\n\nApollo Ghosts – May 10 @ Rickshaw Theatre\n\nFor years, I’ve been known to my BeatRoute colleagues as “the guy who really likes Apollo Ghosts.” Their last-ever show was a joyous, catalogue-spanning celebration that was the perfect send-off for one of the city’s best bands. On the downside, I’m now going to need a new local act to fixate on.\n\n(Runners up: Shotgun Jimmie – May 18 @ Biltmore Cabaret, Billy Bragg – April 5 @ Vogue Theatre)\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nGravity\n\nSandra Bullock and George Clooney sitting in a tin can, far above the world. Planet Earth is blue and there’s nothing they can do.\n\n(Runners up: This Is the End, Before Midnight)\n\nBEST NON-MUSICAL MOMENT\n\nWalking through Golden Gate Park in February. San Francisco is way nicer in the winter than the summer (in my limited experience), and the sunny, 18-degree weather was the perfect antidote to Vancouver’s rainy season.\n\nSummer Swanson – Electronics Dept. Editor\n\nBEST ALBUM\n\nA$AP Ferg – Trap Lord\n\nCaptivating fierce, innovative verses supported by Ferg’s surprisingly melodic vocals and some damn fine production, the album reads smoothly from start to finish, and I’m still addicted to “Shabba” and “Trap Lord” six months after the release.\n\n(Runners up: Special Request – Soul Music, Run the Jewels – s/t, Graze – Graze EP, Om Unit – Threads)\n\nBEST SONG\n\nBreach – “Jack”\n\nBorn out of Ben Westbeech’s attempt to add sex appeal to the flip side of “Let’s Get Hot,” the title tune far surpassed expectations, becoming wildly successful in its addictive simplicity.\n\n(Runners up: Machinedrum – “Eyesdontlie,” Duke Dumont – “Need U (100%),” Shlohmo ft. Jeremih – “Bo Peep (Do U Right),” Pusha T – “Numbers on the Boards”)\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW\n\nEats Everything w/Ricco, Phil David, and Marcello – August 9 @ Shine Nightclub\n\nA night before his scheduled Shambhala performance, Eats Everything came to Vancouver – and for some reason, never made it to Shambhala the next day. Flailer night or cancelled flight rumours aside, he drove the intimately packed dancefloor to tears that hot Friday night with an intoxicating energy and nonstop heaters.\n\n(Runners up: Machinedrum – August 4 @ Bass Coast, Bike Rave – June 29th @ Crab Park)\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nThe Act of Killing\n\nIndonesian mass murderering “gangsters” convince local civilians to re-enact their crimes on film at the behest of the documentarian, grotesquely glorifying the deeds as they laugh, smoke cigarettes, and gossip amongst each other about the most horrifying atrocities. An absolute must-see.\n\n(Runners up: Stories We Tell, Leviathan)\n\nBEST NON-MUSICAL MOMENT\n\nGetting engaged to my soulmate!\n\nAlison Sinkewicz – City Editor\n\nBest Album\n\nKanye West – Yeezus\n\nMr. West is dead. Kanye’s killed the backpack-clad peer-pressure apologist we’ve come to know and love to hate. Slain on the first track when the swirling and snarling intro to “On Sight” immediately rejects any Nikki Minaj storybook bullshit. By “I am a God” there’s no doubt Kanye has been reborn and he’s definitely not our savior. Long live Yeezus.\n\n(Runners up: Kelela – Cut 4 Me, Drake – NWTS, The Knife – Shaking the Habitual)\n\nBest Song\n\nFKA Twigs- Papi Pacify\n\nNet darling FKA Twigs delivered one of the most uniquely direct singles of the year. The UK songstress coons over Yeezus producer Arca’s muscular beat, begging for clarity, pacificity that’s never granted. Twig’s hollow sweetness dullens the sharpness of the track, but it still hurts so good.\n\n(Runners up: Kanye West – “New Slaves,” Angel Olsen – “Forgiven/Forgotten,” Drake – “Hold on We’re Going Home”)\n\nBest Live Show\n\nScreaming Females – Nov 14 @ Media Club\n\n“Pint sized powerhouse” is a phrase used too loosely in the female-fronted music world. “Bad-ass shredder in a size 6 shoe” is more accurate to describe this particular pint. Front woman Marissa Paternoster thrashed her way through the set with punkette poise on perfect head-banging point.\n\n(Runners up: Mount Kimbie – June 13 @ Fortune, Yeezus @ 4eva In My Dreams)\n\nBest Film\n\nBlue Jasmine\n\nWant to experience a complete mental break down for only two hours? Commiserate with Cate Blanchett with this flawless performance of a selfish train wreck.

Muchacho is a smoky golden sunrise, a warm and sweet blend of country, folk and atmospheric rock. Matthew Houck is the mastermind behind it all, cutting through soothing sonic textures with a voice equally matched in raw vulnerability and rich strength.\n\n(Runners up: Foxygen – We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic, Water Liars – Wyoming, Typhoon – White Lighter, Royal Canoe – Today We’re Believers)\n\nBEST SONG\n\nHop Along – “Sister Cities”\n\nThis rascally, blistering rock tune fronted by the scrappiest (in a good way) female voice I’ve heard all year will make you want to get on your bike and go find some trouble.\n\n(Runners up: Angel Olsen – “Sweet Dreams”, Lightning Dust – “Diamond”, Daniel Romano – “A New Love (Can Be Found)”, Haim – “Don’t Save Me”)\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW\n\nDaniel Romano – January 26 house show\n\nTalk about good luck! I saw Daniel Romano perform on a makeshift stage in an apartment on Main Street, following his brilliant, Nudie-suit-clad performance at the Commodore earlier that night. Someone had a bottle of Ballantine’s, the taste of which I now associate with tidy Johnny Cash covers and pedal steel swells.\n\n(Runners up: Neko Case – September 20 @ the Orpheum, Marnie Stern – April 25 @ the Media Club)\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nCaptain Philips\n\nNot since No Country For Old Men has a film physically rattled me to the point where it was borderline unpleasant to sit through. Glad I did though because Tom Hanks calls shotgun on Best Actor of the Year in the last five punch-drunk minutes.\n\n(Runners up: The Bling Ring, Blue Jasmine)\n\nBEST NON-MUSICAL MOMENT\n\nShowing Jian Ghomeshi text messages from my mom, because “Geom Gomeshee” is the best.\n\nTiina Liimu – The Skinny Editor\n\nBEST ALBUM\n\nThe Sadies – Internal Sounds\n\nOkay, so many albums, can I pick? NO! So here’s a “GOOD” Canadian\n\nband. I dunno, alright. Recently I had my paws on an advance and\n\nignored the press. So, one day I plugged my headphones while working\n\non some artwork. First spin this album took me on such a great trip\n\nsong to song, place to place. Easy, no warm up required. This is a\n\nsolid band that just keeps getting better and it never wears thin. No\n\nprompting, no hype, just easy. A good enough reason, right? And kudos\n\nto the self-produced effort!\n\nBEST SONG\n\nSorry can’t pin ONE down and kinda the same above and below, I know\n\nI’m missing a bunch. Hey, next live show, save a bit of your beer money\n\nand buy a record from a band if you really dug it.\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW\n\nNick Cave & The Bad Seeds – April 6 @ The Vogue\n\nLook, this guy can walk on water.\n\n(Runners up: Roky Erickson – November 17 @ Electric Owl, DISTORT Vancouver VOL. IX - Sept 5, 6, 7 @ WISE, ANZA, ASTORIA)\n\nBEST NON-MUSICAL MOMENT\n\nHaving the luxury of being fairly urban central but in 20 minutes\n\non a Sunday morning while the city slickers nurse their hangovers, I\n\ncan be out with the four-legged crew hiking in the rain forest and\n\ndipping toes and paws into a mountain stream.\n\nALBERTA EDITORS’ LISTS\n\nSebastian Buzzalino - Editor\n\nBest Record: This year was a goldmine for great albums, but standouts include Hanni El Khatib’s Head in the Dirt, This Hisses’ Anhedonia and Lindi Ortega’s Tin Star.\n\nWorst Record: Not necessarily the worst record, but I was disappointed in Kvelertak’s sophomore effort, Meir. It was too much of the same and they didn’t do anything to further their sound in any meaningful way.\n\nBest Local Release: SAvK’s Love Letters and Hate Mail takes the top prize for me — an immaculate, catchy album, from start to finish. An honourable mention goes out to Cold Water’s 7”, “Wolf Willow” b/w “Buffalo Beans.” Stebner’s post-hardcore country combo is one of the best things in town.\n\nBest Local Show: July Talk, both during Sled Island and recently at the Gateway. Watching Peter Dreimanis and Leah Fay build an entire set around their sexual tension cuts to the core of rock and roll. Love and rock and roll is all about what you can’t have.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Learning how to stick-and-poke by candlelight during the flood, a 40 of Jameson in one hand and a needle in the other. Dustin’s “Flood Island 2013” on his knee looks amazing.\n\nBest Local Moment: Banding together after the flood to help those in need. I didn’t think Calgary had such a deep sense of community spirit before this summer and I was happy to be proven wrong.\n\nSarah Kitteringham - Shrapnel Editor\n\nBest Record: Can’t pick only one. The ones I loved the most were new albums by Atlantean Kodex, The Ruins of Beverast, Magic Circle, Darkthrone, and Sacriphyx.\n\nWorst Record: Pfffft. Why shit on records when I could name more I love? Releases by Funeral Circle, Cult of Fire, Procession, House of Atreus, Bölzer, Monarque….\n\nBest Local Release: Blackrat’s Whiskey and Blasphemy and The Weir’s Yesterday’s Graves were the winners for me. Our writer described the former as “Sodom, Disrupt and Bestial Mockery thrown into a microwave, from which they emerge as one mutated bastard child,” which sums it up astutely. The second brought all the BLAOW you’ll ever need. Crushing.\n\nBest Local Show: Tough call. Everything Joe from Fornication and Savage Streets put on was great. Broken glass, ample booze, great bands. Fuck Off Life Fest, the Primitive Black Metal Tribute show and a handful more were viciously excellent.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Standing backstage, with about 10 hours of sleep in three days, watching Candlemass during Noctis 666: Lucifer Rex was too good. Also, seeing Dutch death/doom legends Asphyx front row, centre for an all doom set at Roadburn.\n\nBest Local Moment: It’s amazing how strong the Calgary metal scene is. Though there is an obvious division in musical preferences, shows are double and triple stacked almost every weekend and there is something to do all the time. Band quality has never been higher!\n\nCait Lepla - City Editor\n\nBest Record: Madchild finally released the highly previewed Lawnmower Man, which was best for “Prefontaine.” That basically became the anthem of my household, because my roommate’s last name was Prefontaine and it did justice to his type of badass. He had scorpions and lured a neighbourhood cat with his love. After the flood, he’s been going as Prefontaine on the Slam scene of Toronto and it just recalls good memories.\n\nWorst Record: I don’t know, Miley Cyrus? I’m really just waiting for her to release a sex tape with McCaulay Caulkin. It would probably be anticlimactic, but at least there would be great .gifs\n\nBest Local Show: Wreck City rocked my world in amazement and marked the end and beginning of a new era in Calgary arts.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Definitely the resilient mecca of Flood Island.\n\nBest Local Moment: The flood brought out a lot that had been just below the surface. Things are still falling into place and it’s been pretty tough, but this is an incredible time in history and it’s kind of amazing to get to be a part of what happens next. The city is your prairie oyster!\n\nClaire Miglionico - Film Editor\n\nBest movie: Frances Ha.\n\nWorst movie: This Is The End. Dumbest piece of crap I’ve ever watched.\n\nBest local film: The Right Kind of Wrong shot in the Canmore area.\n\nBest local show (music): Probably Passion Pit’s DJ set back in January. We all loved the shitty remixes and the system breaking down halfway through the show.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Buying my parents tickets to the Folk Fest to see Creedence Clearwater Revival and them completely loving it. Oh and Alabama Shakes was unreal! That voice!\n\nBest Local Moment: Analog Coffee opening. Reminds me of Europe. You have not lived if you haven’t tried the brownie there.\n\nAndréa Rojas - Album Reviews Editor\n\nBest Record: Life Changes by Casey Veggies. The L.A. rapper released this mixtape back in January when he was but a wee lad of 19. Appropriately enough, it’s comprised of cheeky driving jams and skate-thug introspectives produced by Harry Fraud and D.R.U.G.S. Plot twist: The subtle complexities of a kid with grown-up taste grappling with the industry come out and render every track lyrically italicized. I’m still spinning it.\n\nWorst Record: The Weeknd’s Kiss Land. Some may call it a step down in creative quality from his mixtape trilogy. I call it a horribly embarrassing trip down an entire flight of stairs, punctuated by plaintively blasé wailing about Japanese hookers and underscored with drugged-out misogyny. Abel, you need a gimmick other than emotionally tortured man-flower/reluctant, racially ambiguous womanizer. That`s Drake’s thing.\n\nBest Local Release: Beach Season’s Ugly Summer, for those with a palate for chillwave, psychedelic house, and progressive R&B. Go listen to “Paralyzed” on one of those 20-below days and you’ll feel a little bit sunnier.\n\nBest Local Show: It goes without saying that Wreck City was a phenomenal way to kick off the summer. Sound-wise, Sanctums live is always a solid experience.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Eating McDonald`s with The Sword. Dancing backstage at Afrikadey. Sweating all of my black lipstick off during Hunx and His Punx`s after-hours set in the BeatRoute basement and then waking up in a bra and a leather jacket.\n\nBest Local Moment: Love as it is born in the photo booth at Broken City and over chocolate cream pie at the Blackfoot Diner.\n\nCory Jones - Live Editor\n\nBest Record: Hooded Fang’s Gravez has been in my headphones all year. A frantic mix of garage and indie-rock, crammed with enough cynical emotion and danceable guitar lines to leave you lying on the floor, wanting more. Honourable mention goes to skate-punk shit-heads FIDLAR for their compilation of previous EPs.\n\nWorst Record: I don’t think it’s the worst album per se, or even the band’s worst, but there was something largely disappointing with the latest Edward Sharpe release. It seems the band has found an audience and are content with pandering to it.\n\nBest Local Release: Jung People’s Gold Bristle! is not only my favourite local release, but probably the best thing my ears have encountered all year. Cathartic, fragile and engaging in a way that post-rock can only hope to be.\n\nBest Local Show: Seeing the Sparta reunion in the confines of Broken City really made my year. Mostly-foggy memories of Jim Ward spewing nostalgic bliss will remain with me for years to come.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Maybe not my “favourite” memory, but the surreal feeling of walking through an empty downtown core, after what would end up being the final sets of the Sled Island, was a feeling I’ll never forget.\n\nShane Flug - Web Producer/Copy Editor\n\nBest Record: Pearl Jam – Lightning Bolt; Phoenix – Bankrupt!; Dream Theater – self-titled\n\nWorst Records: Nah. Didn’t hear an album I hated.\n\nBest Local Release: Tanner James – How To Ruin Your Life With Women (disclosure: he was a classmate of mine, so a completely biased answer).\n\nBest Local Show: Colin Stetson at Commonwealth during Sled Island. I didn’t know such sounds on the saxophone were humanly possible.\n\nBest Local Moment: The way our city pulled together after the June flood.\n\nBrandon McNeil - Intern\n\nBest Record: Revocation – Revocation\n\nWorst Record: Megadeth – Super Collider\n\nBest Local Release: Phantom Limb – Mantra\n\nBest Local Show: The Unlucky 13 hosted by Red Deer’s Justin Shadows (vocalist of Leave the Living). I played close to 20 shows over the last year, but that one took the cake. It was by far the most fun and energetic gig I was able to play yet.\n\nFavourite Festival Memory: Hanging out with Gene Hoglan at Noctis. I’ll never forget it.\n\nBest Local Moment: The sheer vastness of Calgary Metalfest and what transpired over those three days. It was absolutely fantastic to see how much metal talent the city had to offer.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nFrom Team BeatRoute\n\nLIVE AND DON’T LEARN\n\nStarting a band is probably one of the easiest things anyone can do. All you need is to rustle up some instruments, some common musical ground between friends and plenty of cases of cheep beer. Keeping that band going through the years, through all the miserable defeats that stand in your way, takes actual dedication and focus. Calgary’s the Motherfuckers have beaten the odds and are set to celebrate their 15-year anniversary this month. They’ve managed to strike a balance between absolute madness and punk ethics, drinking, drugging, scrapping and playing their way through ill-fated tours across Canada, countless lineup changes and more than one hiatus.\n\n“The secret to our longevity is taking two to four years off at the time,” says frontman Dan Izzo.\n\n“We also do member rotations constantly,” adds bassist Sean Hunter.\n\n“Our newest member, Matt Pissoff, is on guitar. The only downside to him is that I’m no longer the young, good looking one in the band.”\n\nThe Motherfuckers’ history is long and mostly unglamorous. Indeed, as we get to talking about some of the band’s defining moments, it seems that many of these teeter along the edge between success and total train-wreck. Despite that, the hardcore quartet are back in the saddle, ready to hit the studio for a new full-length in 2014, a new cross-Canada tour in the summer and, of course, to celebrate 15 years of mayhem. True to their roots, they maintain that they’ve learned little in their time as one of Calgary’s most notorious punks, except for one key note:\n\n“Never, ever, ever do a Sex Pistols cover set,” says Hunter, dead serious. “You will want to hang yourself by the end of it.”\n\nTOP THREE MOTHERFUCKING SHINING MOMENTS\n\nFive-star hotel accommodations\n\nDan Izzo: We used to play a bar called Stars, in Edmonton, which is now the Pawn Shop, and the promoter would get us a room at the Commercial Hotel. It was a nice setup there, too: it was one of those places where you have your room and the communal bathroom is down the hall. We played with Dry Fisted and they paid $10 to upgrade their rooms, so they go their own bathrooms. We didn’t know we could do that. We were going down the hall and Tim and Hunter had gone to sleep — again, this was when Jay Misery was in the band — and he and I were wandering around and I was wearing a Dry Fisted shirt. The guy at the counter was like, “Quiet! You’ll wake up the Motherfuckers,” and Jay was like, “We are the Motherfuckers!”\n\nThat’s a shining moment.\n\nHunter goes to Invermere\n\nDI: One of our earliest shows, must have been ’99. We were playing with Downway and didn’t want to get stuck headlining.\n\nSean Hunter: I had been at our friend’s wedding. I went to the ceremony, skip the reception to go play the show, sick as a dog. All I want to do is get there, play the show and go to sleep. Downway wanted to go on first. I pretty much snapped. First, I offered to scrap Downway. Then I lost it on Matt, who was putting on the show. I don’t remember anything between offering to fight Downway and the end.\n\nMatt Pissoff: You were going to fight my dad at one moment.\n\nSH: No no, your dad was starting to get a little concerned and I pointed at him and went, “You should settle down, old man, he’s putting on the show, it’s up to him to handle,” and I returned to ragging on Matt.\n\nDI: And now, 15 years later, Matt is our guitarist.\n\nSH: I tried to blank out the years I played guitar in this band.\n\nStrippers in Toronto\n\nDI: Our friend Matt, who used to sing in a band called Endprogram, out of Toronto, had an illegal loft space in a condemned building that some scumbag was renting out to artists. Matt had the top floor of this building. He put on a show for us there and it was pouring rain the whole day. The roof is leaking and the acoustic ceiling tile is bulging.\n\nApparently, he used to have the whole floor, but the landlord decided to rent the middle of the floor to someone. I’m walking through an inch of water in the kitchen to go to the bathroom and the guys that lives there is standing there in the water, cooking some pierogis with a punk show going on around him. Normal looking dude, too.\n\nSH: We’re playing the show and there’s water leaking everywhere. We’re on the only dry place on the floor. It must have been like 30-40 people there, pretty full.\n\nDI: I’d say 300.\n\nSH: There were some brilliant bands we played with that show. While we’re playing on stage, this chick who lived below and was a stripper —\n\nTim Bastard: No, she was an anchor for the Naked News.\n\nSH: Whatever, that’s a stripper. She comes up and starts stripping and grinding Dan’s mic stand, which he never uses. She’s groping Dan and rubbing up on him and the crowd is loving it. That was a highlight.\n\nCatch the Motherfuckers at two shows this month. Dec. 21 at Dickens and Dec. 28 at Tubby Dog (all ages).\n\nWords and photo by Sebastian Buzzalino"
