        "text": "AM: Any insight into what it would take for Gerry to tour Japan?\n\nJC: Apparently there’s this process to do this, but apparently he has to go to the Japanese embassy, say look, I did my time, I’m very sorry, dadadadah, I don’t know what he has to say, and it’s up to them. Even without Gerry, I’d love to go there and actually I talked to Fat Mike from NOFX and he thought that would be a pretty cool idea, because he was a Subhumans fan back in the day and now, and it’s funny, because he knows the other Subhumans from England and I think they actually have a record on their label, so it’s weird. We might do a gig, Subhumans vs the Subhumans, do a show together sometime. [None of that ever happened, note. END INTERVIEW ONE!]\n\nAM: So you joined Personality Crisis after a gig at the Calgarian?\n\nJC: Yep, it was after that. I don’t know what they say in the book. I got there late, and I only ended up seeing Personality Crisis, either half a set, or one and a half sets. I can’t really remember, but they were a great band. They were different from anything I’d seen at the Calgarian. And then from the stage I heard Mitch say, ‘yeah, we’re lookin’ for a drummer!’ At that point, I had real shitty job, and I did not like my job and I wanted to play music. I figured, ‘Hey, I like this band, and if they really need a drummer, I’m willing to pack up my little Mustang, throw my drums in the back, and drive to Winnipeg.' So I gave’em a copy of the Suburban Slag demo tape, talked to them briefly. Later on, I sort of hurt myself at work - I actually semi-blinded myself with some lime. I was mixing plaster, and POOM it shot up into my eye, and I went, ‘This job REALLY sucks, now.’ And then it happens that that night, Mitch phones me and goes, ‘Yeah, we’re still looking for a drummer. And I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll come out.’ He didn’t think I was gonna come out - I was, like, 19 years old or something like that - so I just said, ‘I’m going out.’ I loaded up my car and drove out there, and lo and behold - I was there, and we rehearsed, and it worked. That was the first real good band I was in. It was a really, really great band, actually. From there, I went on to SNFU, to DOA, and then a bunch of bands, and the Subhumans now.\n\nWe actually based ourselves out of Calgary for awhile. Richard left - he was our bass player. He ended up being the guitar player later.\n\nAM: Thoughts on Chris Walter? You knew him from Winnipeg, right?\n\nJC: Yeah, he was totally into the punk scene, and so was I. He was in the Vacant Lot, I think his band was at that time, with his brother Jamie - he’s a good friend, too. So I hung out with Chris back then, experimented with different substances, and drank a lot of beer. I always liked Chris... He hasn’t changed that much, it’s really weird: he’s clean, but some people on/ off drugs are essentially the same person. Unless you’re freaking out trying to get money for drugs; that’s a different story...\n\nAM: Do you and Brian compare notes much?\n\nJC: Usually the day before I’m coming in, I’ll phone up and go, ‘hey, what’s happening,’ which is great, because I know Brian really well and he can totally give me ‘the skinny’ on what’s going on: if we’ve got new people in, if people have been discharged, if there’s been a fight. And when we get together, work always comes up... There’s so many people who need help, especially in the mental health area. There’s not enough beds - not even close! It’s insane. There’s just not the money or resources, and the Olympics coming up is a perfect example of money being misused.\n\nOne example: I was with the Frank Frink Five playing a wedding a few weeks ago, and I ended up meeting a woman who works for Strathcona Mental Health. She was interviewing over one hundred people, and there’s only four beds in this facility - four beds for a hundred people! And these are for the people who are actually seeking help; there’s so many who aren’t. Even the safe injection site... a lot of people go, ‘Oh, they’re basically just helping the drug users,’ but they don’t realize what the nurses do down there. People downtown have so many different skin conditions - they have so many different afflictions, and their legs are basically rotting off their bodies. So the nurses do dressing changes on wounds. If they stopped what they were doing, maybe one tenth of the people would get help. These people would have to go to walk-in clinics and wait hours and hours to get help, and possibly get it, possibly not. You get some people that are coming in that are completely abusing the system and they don’t follow the rules and they’re not really being compliant, at all. But generally people are; they’re getting their treatments, and they don’t want to lose their leg or whatever the case may be. Just about every shift, I get a ‘hey man, thanks a lot for what you’re doing.’\n\nAM: Brian talks about it a bit in \"People of the Plague.\" [Note: there's a clip of the band playing this at Pub 340 where I'm clearly visible, in my old Subhumans shirt (see the bald guy on the right, below). This was the gig where Gerry dedicated \"Moving Forward\" to me (I'd griped that someone should force Brian to learn the lyrics to that one, which are a mouthful]. He calls it the curse of \"rotting feet.\" Chris calls it \"street feet.\" That's an amazing song.\n\nJC: Great song. I love playing that, and the lyrics are just fantastic.\n\nAM: If we could talk about DOA for a second, any memories from the \"Takin' Care of Business\" video shoot?\n\nJC: That was fucking fun, getting to hang out with Randy and hear his stories - who else has Randy Bachman as your hockey coach, and you take on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and win the game? [The gig portions of the video shoot were at the old Boy’s Club, where original Subhumans (and later DOA drummer) Ken “Dimwit” Montgomery used to live] then the hockey was at Britannia. We had a guy with a camera skating around in a wheelchair, so we could get some of the follow shots and stuff” [apparently also a technique lifted from the movie Slapshot]. The stick down the team, we definitely lifted that from Slapshot, too. The old milkjug, which represented the Stanley Cup, just happened to be in the room. I picked it up and started shaking it and we passed it around. Beer went flying, and Randy got soaked... He was such a great sport, such a great guy to work with.\n\nAM: Hockey was one of the selling points on getting you to leave SNFU and join DOA, right?\n\nJC: Yes. I play hockey, and they had a team, the Murder Squad, and we ended up playing lots of games. We played CFOX, and some other radio stations and newspapers, and raised money for the food bank. One time, we had over two hundred people in the crowd, totally supporting us - we were like the home team, playing CFOX, and Bruce Allen was their coach. They were losing this game - we ended up winning all the games except one against CFOX. Anyhow, Bruce had ‘Bruce Allen Talent Agencies,’ right? So the crowd started chanting ‘Bruce Allen - Get Some Talent!’ ...I think it was Art Bergmann who actually started it, and he was with Bruce Allen at the time. Bruce Allen has this little baldspot on the top of his head and someone who was in the stands told me, it started getting redder and redder...\n\nAM: Am I correct that you did a brief return stint with DOA last year?\n\nJC: The Subhumans weren’t doing anything, and Joe phoned me up. It was a blast. The songs came back really fast, and it brought back a lot of really good memories, and Joey and I had time to - I won’t say kiss and make up, but he actually apologized for the way a few things came out in the book [I, Shithead] and a few other things: it was all water under the bridge, and we shook and had a great time.\n\nAM: I know we've talked about it before, but tell me a bit more about Dimwit's kit?\n\nJC: This is a beautiful kit - it’s a Milestone kit with Rogers and Ludwig hardware, so it’s basically custom-made. Dimwit had several different drumkits, and this one was one of the coolest; he ended up trading this one in at Drums Only. When I joined DOA, I had this Ludwig set. It was a great set of drums, but they were smaller drums; it had a 22” bass drum, and I wanted a 24. Instead of a 16” floor tom, I wanted an 18. I wanted bigger tubs for DOA: big band, big guys, big drums, this is what Joe was saying, and I went along with that. We went into Drums Only, and I see this silver sparkle Milestone kit, and it ends up being Dimwit’s old kit. Boom - I grabbed it. It has a great history, and now it’s been with me for a long time [over twenty years]. Let’s just say it’s seen a lot of blood, sweat and tears!\n\nAM: A final question. The Subhumans are re-recording a song you wrote for Personality Crisis, \"Piss on You,\" for a BYO compilation, right? Tell me about that?\n\nJC: We changed the song around a little bit, added a chorus at the end, and everything turned out cool. There’s actually triangle on the song now. It’s to represent the tinkle."
