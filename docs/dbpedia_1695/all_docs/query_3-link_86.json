Some of these folk even happen to be black. Some I might even describe as rockheaded, but why be nasty? The very term is thought by some to be not only oxymoronic but also moronic and insulting. Rock, they declare, is already black, so why does it need a color-coding modifier? Au contraire, I reply. Indeed, rock and roll is black in origin—and when Alan Freed stamped the sex slang–derived term as a marketing brand on the race music/youth music of the 1950s, the music of Bill Haley, Little Richard, and The Platters were included in the catchall. “Rock” though tells a different set of stories, describes another time, pertains to a later place, a later generation of people, and another set of historical conditions and paradoxes. Rock’s leading esthetician, Greil Marcus, once defined rock as black music played by white people—largely the way a lot of people hear it, though whether he thought Jimi Hendrix’s and Arthur Lee’s rock was black or some off-brand of honorary white remains in question. Wynton Marsalis has declared that any form of music that uses that African American invention known as backbeat becomes black by default no matter if the singer is crooning in pidgin Korean. The riddle in all this conflamma isn’t musical though, but social—which in America means racial. (The important thing in Marcus’s definition is the white people part and not black music, which is where a lot of black folk tend to get tripped up, imagining equality where none exists.) All forms of music are social and cultural in origin, or as Ornette Coleman once put it, all music is folk music, as he hadn’t heard any music made by kangaroos. Many of the world musics and most of the musics contained in the global catchall known as world music are largely defined by the ethnicity and geographic coordinates of the cultures from which they originate. By this reasoning all the musics we consider black—ragtime, early jazz, swing, Delta blues, classic blues, bebop, doowop, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, zydeco, soul, funk, calypso, disco, house, techno, electro, salsa, reggae, Afrobeat, zouk, meringue—\n\nB\n\nx\n\nGREG S. TATE\n\nshould be called American or Afro-Caribbean or African. But given slavery, segregation, civil rights, Black Power and post-soul culture, and given that we Americans define ourselves to ourselves by race before nationality, only those musics whose cultural base is also a land base get described as Nigerian, Dominican, Trinidadian, and Cuban rather than black. In the United States, black qualifies as its own country, its own private Idaho. In the absence of a nation or a land base we can comfortably, exclusively, and multigenerationally call our own, African Americans are left to define themselves apart from their pinker brethren and sistren by our history of multigenerational political struggle against racism or white supremacy and by the cultural acts we engage in in majority-black settings. To cut to the chase: Attending concerts featuring performances by young white men playing their version of black music has not tended to be one of those cultural acts where googobs of black people can be found rolling mob deep. Rock concerts are, however, a place where one can generally be guaranteed to find large numbers of whitefolk amassed in marauding hordes. It is, then, a tribal, cultural act, this rock (even when black artists like Ben Harper or Lenny Kravitz perform it for mass-white audiences), one supported by radio stations that call themselves rock and brag about their “no nigger music” or, excuse me, “no-rap” policy. If it were simply a matter of musical form, of genre, of amped-up Hendrixesque guitar playing, then an entire generation of black bands with badass guitar players would not have been absent from rock radio in the 1970s. Bands like those of Funkadelic, The Isley Brothers, Mandrill, War, Rufus, Curtis Mayfield, Mother’s Finest, Maxayn, Edwin Birdsong, and the like. By the fall of 1985, when Vernon Reid pulled a motley crew of likeminded thinkers together in a gallery called JAM in Soho owned by an African American woman named Linda Bryant who had already established that conceptual art was not something only white men could do, rock was firmly established in the public imagination as a white, tribal affair, and anyone black who chose to play it was designated either an Oreo, a fool, or a freak. What the Black Rock Coalition sought to establish was that black and rock could mix without large numbers of white people being there to validate us. Large numbers did turn up for Living Colour concerts after they broke on MTV, but by then Living Colour was known for selling out CBGB’s to majority-black crowds at Coalition-organized gigs. Choosing to call the organization the Black Rock Coalition was perceived by many of us then as a vestigial militant act, and in fact our first BRC orchestra event was called the Apartheid Concert, preceded only months before by our first dance party, our Drop the Bomb festival, the\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxi\n\nposter for which featured Little Richard’s face plastered over the Japanese symbol of the rising sun. Many have subsequently thought that black rock is a sound defined by Living Colour, though as we stated in our first manifesto, it meant black artists could count on as much support as white artists from major labels in performing whatever form of black music they choose, as we saw occurring with, say, Sting’s adventures into the jazzesque. Those were the days, and naive days they were indeed when it was still rather novel to see black faces on MTV. These were the days before hip-hop became the cultural act white youth rallied around as a tribe, though not a day when black people who played loud, guitar-oriented rock weren’t still considered something of an aberration at home and abroad. The varied tales in Rip It Up tell of life inside this crazed, accursed corner of the music purgatory world we like to call the world of the black rocker. Having lived among its slings and arrows and outrageous fortunes and egregious misfortunes for over thirty years, I remain amazed that as simple an act as a young black man or woman deciding not to sing straight-up reggae, blues, or hip-hop can still get people’s panties in a knot. God bless ‘em all, past, present, and future.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nK A N D I A\n\nC R A Z Y\n\nH O R S E\n\n“LIVE AT PHILMORE”: INTRODUCTION t the tail end of the 1980s—a decade viewed almost universally by younger American music fans as the twentieth century’s pop cultural nadir—I moved to Manhattan and, as a wide-eyed and naive eighteen year-old, fumbled my way uptown to attend the Black Rock Coalition’s meetings at the Frank Silvera Theater Workshop in Harlem. Throughout my previous boarding school years, I had somehow managed to read cultural critic Greg Tate’s work in the Village Voice. Tate being a friend of the family, I figured inchoately that it was time to eschew the cloud cuckooland of Dead and Phish concerts and that whole neo-hippie scene to get alert to what he and fellow BRC cofounder Vernon Reid were espousing: the right for blacks to play their own music, the music they invented—i.e., rock ‘n’ roll. Mostly I lurked in the back of the room up those musty stairs, trying to think up clever things to say to honcho Don Eversley after the meetings (awed not merely by being the youngest present but inevitably one of very few “chicks”). And I appeared as an extra outside Central Park’s iron-gated Quiet Zone one morning before film class, simulating a black musician unwelcome at Graceland for Living Colour’s “Elvis Is Dead” video. Blink and you miss me. Such are my “black rock” bona fides. I say black rock between quotes because, fourteen years later, I still have no idea what it is, and many folks would not recognize it as a genre. Eventually I became a rock critic—Tate calls me the last of them—and even sometimes write for the Voice, although my own is primarily in service of the Redneck Underground. In essence, my ears and soul only process music as The Sublime or pure shit, occasionally interrupted by question marks that soon achieve resolution. Perhaps Brother Reid and Gregory have some Rosetta Stone stashed away, to be revealed in future as prophecy in a format akin to Earth, Wind & Fire’s classic late 1970s “kemetic” album covers or genius illustrator Pedro Bell’s kozmic work for\n\nA\n\nxiv\n\nKANDIA CRAZY HORSE\n\nFunkadelic. Those most militant supporters of black folks’ right to rock would probably echo Gregg Allman’s one-time quote about “southern rock” in debating the term: “That’s like saying rock rock.” Oxymorons, lifelong vinyl fetishes, the digestion of Jimi Hendrix’s and Ishmael Reed’s entire oeuvres, many P-Funk ticket stubs, and the fate of following in Tate’s fleet footsteps as a rock critic (in a parallel to Sidney and Denzel. Not that I’m Denzel, mind) have precisely brought me to this point where we, my colleagues and I, have attempted to provide a brief collection of essays and interviews on the subject of black musicians’ postwar experiences in the musical genre of rock ‘n’ roll. This starter collection, Rip It Up, certainly seems timely and necessary in a period when mass-circulation music magazines are painting the umpteenth “Return of Rock” with an exclusively white male face (consider the White Stripes’ Meg White a token for our purposes. And correctly so). Nowhere in the year 2002’s trumpeting of Great White Hypes and their predominantly retro sounds was there much if any room for the current crop of rock star hopefuls on the black-hand side: Tamar-Kali, Kregg Ajamu, Santi White & Stiffed, Cherry, Cody ChesnuTT, Joi, Martin Luther, Martha Redbone, Jerome Jordan, Mascara, and even Cee-Lo (ex–Goodie Mob), who worked with some interesting hybrids on his solo debut and often sings The Doors in concert. Sadly, I probably have to inform a considerable number of you that the book’s title was chosen in honor of Little Richard, the self-claimed and legendary “Architect of Rock ‘n’ Roll.” Richard Penniman, the Georgia Peach from Macon, and his contemporaries such as Chuck Berry with ace boon pianist Johnnie Johnson, Bo Diddley, the late Otis Blackwell, and others blazed a trail across America and the rest of the world with their galvanic sound derived from longtime minstrel traditions, childhood years of carney infatuation, tent revivals, electric blues, assists from country and western, and the speeded-up life of the postwar years. Other perennially sought music tomes speak more precisely to the influence of Thomas Dorsey’s gospel, swing jazz, Louis Jordan’s jump boogie, and other subgenres on the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll. I could be flippant and advise you to go buy Funkadelic’s 1973 masterpiece America Eats Its Young (if you don’t already own it), saying therein you’d find an answer. However, I am serious. Some critics condemn AEIY as too scattershot in its exploration of varied styles and inconsistent in terms of songwriting, but I disagree; if you have to make such value judgments, consider this double album as the across-the-tracks version of the Rolling Stones’ Exile On Main Street, equally provocative in evoking the aftermath of the 1960s, dread about the Vietnam War and a society in chaos (especially the black American world within a world), the joys\n\n“LIVE AT PHILMORE”\n\nxv\n\nof balling, the horrific stasis of drug addiction, and the two-headed beast of hedonism and racism in the rock business. At any rate, America Eats Its Young is worth any cost for the glories of “Balance” alone. The hope for this book is that its spotlight on the importance of such obscure classics as America Eats Its Young will serve as a primer on some of the key figures who have made not just rock history but pancultural history. More schooled rock fans born in the 1940s and 1950s tend to be aware of the ways in which guitarist Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones is indebted to Chuck Berry. That would suggest that every time one hears the Stones’ well-known catalog the seed of Berry’s power is also present. Nevertheless, thirty-odd years after the death of Jimi Hendrix, perhaps the greatest ever guitar revolutionary this planet will see, the notion of a “black” guitar hero is still inconceivable to many—or at least to record executives and other power players in the rock biz. This despite the mainstream success of Lenny Kravitz (again a token). These days ghetto gals in hip-hop videos and on the streets of urban USA even dress like redneck girls at a Lynyrd Skynyrd show circa 1975, yet for the most part neither they nor their ex-frat white counterparts on the other side of the country’s Great Racial Divide readily embrace “black rockers” or otherwise eccentric artists in the vein of the provocative Chocolate Genius who aren’t afraid to play with an exposed electric cord and a bathtub full of water aesthetically. The more palatable and cunning construct of a sassy, poetry-spouting sistagurl in a gelee—which is not quite so progressive as it appears—is far more comforting than the angry, snarling glory of Tamar-Kali all the way live, wielding her ax like the forked tongue of the Indian deity that is her predecessor, calling warmongers and trifling lovers out of their names. Yes, yes, rock ‘n’ roll is about Sex and Death (and fast cars and pissing off your parents), not politics (Curtis Mayfield and Bono being the exceptions to this rule). However, it’s not me nor this book’s contributors making the music a “racial” thing; it has been ever since the first songcatching and cross-racial borrowing of musical styles began between Africans brought to the Americas and their Scotch Irish brethren in indenture and outlaw culture. Certainly specific points can be traced to Daniel Emmett Rice’s supposed authoring of “Dixie” and incessant rip-off schemes against artists established back in the early twentieth century when the race records industry flourished. If Keith Richards is considered the Great Spirit of rock ‘n’ roll—and to whites he invariably is—one of the best things he ever did was allowing Little Richard, Bo Diddley, and Chuck Berry to speak incredibly openly about the ways they had been stolen from by hitmen during a segment of Richards’s cinematic tribute to Berry (Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll).\n\nxvi\n\nKANDIA CRAZY HORSE\n\nIndeed, if any band ought to be called the Greatest Rock ‘n’ Roll Band on Earth, it’s Ohio’s Isley Brothers, not merely winners of a high-profile lawsuit against Michael Bolton for sonic infringement nor glaringly bankrupt whereas Sir Mick Jagger keeps his Stones rolling in ducats with a iron fist. For the achievement of being the sole act to chart in all of rock’s five decades alone, we all must bow down. Still, the Isleys’ greatness is not bound to little feats such as these but rather to the sublime heights of their back catalog, especially what may perhaps be their masterpiece, trumping even 3 + 3, 1971’s (“It was a very good year”) Givin’ It Back (on their own T-Neck label). It’s telling that Robert Greenfield’s account of the Rolling Stones’ 1972 tour of America describes an episode wherein the band sought to catch the Isleys live in Oakland and the bulk of the entourage scrambled to follow. By successfully employing “crazy Dada Negro” Jimi Hendrix and taking him in as kin instead of seeing him as a threat like his erstwhile boss Little Richard did, the Isleys somehow sealed their pact with the cosmos, ensuring longevity and eternal relevance. Although unable to picture the divine Ron Isley (or even his babe bruh Ernie) sleeping with the guitar he posed with on Givin’ It Back’s iconic sepiatone cover, he, like Mos Def, is Rock ‘n’ Roll for the sheer uncanny diversity of his voice and his perfectly absorbed ability to mimic lost brother Hendrix’s guitar as on the chief one of the album’s suite of astonishing covers: “Ohio/Machine Gun.” As displayed on this record’s highs, such as James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain” and Stephen Stills’s “Love the One You’re With,” Ron Isley’s gift of interpretation, superior even to onetime collaborator Rod Stewart’s in the arena of rock, both spotlights the fascinating period when the 1960s’ foremost soul and edgier Motown stars raced to belatedly embrace the Love and Peace Movement via its more prominent composers (Lennon-McCartney, Dino Valenti, Dylan, etc.) and expanded their sonic vocabulary across the Afro-Celt continuum to arrive at later genius like the Isleys’ “Summer Breeze,” “The Highways of My Life,” “Live It Up,” “Hello It’s Me,” “Midnight Sky (Parts 1 & 2),” and their own reprised “That Lady” (a sin and a shame the original was a flop). This reverse crossover, funkdafying the Beatlesque and so forth, is a tale rarely told and a dynamic not wholly explored. And so I am involved with this project with the sincere hope that the next generation will be so versant in the experiences, meaningful traditions, and important aesthetic ideas of rock musicians who happen to be black that there need not be the sense of having to reinvent the wheel with each decade in the wake of Hendrix. Eddie Hazel, Richie Havens, Shuggie Otis, and Phil Lynott in the 1970s, Prince and Vernon Reid in the 1980s, Kravitz in the 1990s, perhaps ChesnuTT and Jerome Jordan for the aughties have all maintained his legacy against considerable odds.\n\n“LIVE AT PHILMORE”\n\nxvii\n\nNow it’s time for my generation of “Soul Baby” (a term coined by contributor Mark Anthony Neal) scholars and cultural critics, mostly born amid the civil rights era, to succeed the previous generation’s revolutionary project by applying the skills of our particular fields to enlighten you, dear readers, via this book, which we believe is the first of its kind dealing with this topic. The moment is auspicious, what with New York Times features heralding ChesnuTT’s arrival, the underground rediscovery of black rock doyenne Betty Mabry (Davis) who managed to rein in not only members of Sly Stone’s and Janis Joplin’s bands for recording but Sylvester, too, and the innovations of several hip-hop outfits garnering acclaim at the other end of the spectrum, such as production duo the Neptunes, OutKast, and the X-ecutioners. Mos Def, platinum-selling New York–based rapper and sometime thespian, recently launched a rock ‘n’ roll band named Black Jack Johnson, suggesting that his outfit would wield power akin to what was once the mightiest (and most controversial) fist. Johnson was the first black world heavyweight boxing champion, a man who has been described as “fighting not only for his own dignity but also to knock white America off its haughty perch.” With the name choice Mos Def echoed sentiments felt by many—that rock and roll is black music, a genre that has been bastardized since its inception by white hucksters. Mos Def also vaingloriously announced that his band would spearhead a “black rock revival.” Perhaps a revival including the onetime collaboration of white death metal band Anthrax and black revolutionary rap gurus Public Enemy? Rock music, that quintessentially American phenomenon is, like so many things American, mired in racial ambiguity and contradictions. The existence of “black rock” directly contradicts the definition of rock held dear by some of the industry’s most lauded critics and commentators: that rock is black music played by white people. Or Mexicans, too, since many black rockers’ great hero and influence Carlos Santana affirms that everything he plays is “African music.” Lest you think Rip It Up is just a settling of old scores (I never had to tangle with the Chess Brothers, for instance, over song royalties but surely have parents once involved in the Movement who have groaned at my generation’s apathy through the years, accusing us of not giving back to The People after their struggle), its purpose is moreover to celebrate the joys of the music and share the stories of artists both known and overlooked in the sporadically recognized yet always tenacious black rock movement. There is something heady about shopping for vinyl and thereafter spending countless hours beside your turntable tripping into other worlds. Encountering the personal philosophies and badass attitude (and sartorial splendor) of litanies of artists is a vital rite of passage from youth\n\nxviii\n\nKANDIA CRAZY HORSE\n\nunto adolescence. Nothing much rivals the thrill and rush of the Rock ‘n’ Roll Show. Through the arduous process of editing this volume, those illusory boons remained present in mind. Even if I and my collaborators have not arrived at satisfactory responses to “What is black rock?” or “Is rock race neutral or constantly plagued by mummery and racial subjectivity?” or, as the immortal Funkadelic mob best put it, “Who says a funk band can’t play rock?!” Rip It Up digs into the essence of black Americana to praise rock’s pioneering heroes and latter-day road warriors.

LITTLE RICHARD: You got to remember, when it first started, it wasn’t rock ‘n’ roll. It was your Elmore Jameses, your Sonny Boy Williamsons, your Howlin’ Wolfs, your Little Walters, y’understand me? Rock ‘n’ roll came from Billy Ward and the Dominoes, they had a song called “60 Minute Man”—“I rock ‘em, roll ‘em all night long, I’m a 60 minute man, if you don’t believe I’m all I say, come up and see your dad”— that’s where the words rock ‘n’ roll came from. When I came out, there wasn’t no one singing rock ‘n’ roll, there was country—like Bill Monroe and His Blue Grass Boys, with them fiddles?—and there was a bandleader called Swingin’ Sammy Kaye, singing a song called “Pennies from Heaven,” but they wasn’t fallin’ over in my neighborhood, so I had to get out and create somethin’. So I took rhythm and blues and boogie-woogie, put it together, and came up with rock ‘n’ roll. But I was only able to use my own singing style when I went to Specialty. I had that style all the time, but the other companies wouldn’t accept it! They wanted me to sound like other people, to be a blues singer. I had this other thing, they’d never heard nothin’ like it, so they was afraid of it. But when I went to Specialty with Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom! they said, “OK!”\n\n2\n\nANDY GILL\n\nAG: You used some of the same musicians as Fats Domino on your records, didn’t you—the New Orleans crew from Dave Bartholomew’s band? LITTLE RICHARD: Me and Fats, we would record with the same band. He would record one week and then next week I would come in and record. That was with Earl Palmer, Lee Allen, Red Tyler, and all of those guys, they had a great recordin’ band. But it was strange, each of us had a different style, and they would play our individual styles, they’d adapt to our personalities, y’know? I had some amazing musicians in my live band too. Jimi Hendrix was my guitarist, James Brown was my vocalist, Billy Preston was my organist at fourteen years old. I’m the Architect of rock ‘n’ roll, the originator, the Emancipator. Before me, there wasn’t nothin’ but a few pigs, and they didn’t have no ham, y’know? AG: What kind of technology were those early sides cut on? LITTLE RICHARD: Just three tracks! That’s the reason I had to scream for the sax solo, ‘cause they didn’t have but the one microphone, hangin’ over the piano. I had to scream so the saxophone player, Lee Allen, would know it was time for him to blow. I’d go, “Aaaaaaaaah!” and Lee Allen would go, Da-da-da-doo-da. When I hollered, he knew it was time to get it! It was a little bitty room, Cosimo’s, not much bigger than a toilet, but it was a funky little room! I would teach them the songs in the studio. If you ever heard my outtakes, I would hum them the solos they were going to make. The solo that Lee Allen was about to play, I would hum it for him, and he would duplicate it. The rhythms, I would do them on the piano, and they would duplicate them, too. AG: Listening to the Specialty Sessions box, it’s interesting that other tracks may develop over a dozen takes or so, but “Tutti Frutti” is right there from the start, first take. Where on earth did it come from? LITTLE RICHARD: That’s right. I had been sayin’ “Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom!” for a long time, but I didn’t know anything about writer’s rights, ‘cause some of the writer’s rights they gave the girl [Dorothy LaBostrie], they should not have given her, because I already had “Tutti Frutti.” I had Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom! in my hometown, it was word that I said. People’d say, “How you doin’, Richard?” I’d say, “Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom!” AG: It must have been annoying for you to see Pat Boone, of all people, getting bigger hits than you with your own material. LITTLE RICHARD: It was. Both of us are out of the South—I’m from Georgia, he’s from Tennessee—and they didn’t like it ‘cause the white girls was screamin’ over me, and they put him out to block that. With way bigger promotion. That’s the reason I started wearin’ makeup, so that\n\nTEN QUESTIONS FOR LITTLE RICHARD\n\n3\n\nthey wouldn’t feel threatened when I was in clubs, around the white girls, ‘cause they think you’re comin’ ‘round to get them, when your mind ain’t nowhere like that. Their mind is sex, y’know? Everybody thinkin’ that you’re comin’ to get a piece when I didn’t want nothin’. I took a piece of cake, but I didn’t want nothin’ else! My mind was on business, and on music, and I wasn’t goin’ out just for sex. I think anybody goin’ out just for sex, they’re not true entertainers. A true entertainer loves his craft, and wants to do the best for his music. AG: Is there a difference between gospel and secular R&B? People talk about “the devil’s music.” LITTLE RICHARD: There’s a little difference. Some of it sounds like the blues, some it sounds like rock, according to the type of gospel song you’re doin’. And what makes the difference is the lyric. There were some great gospel singers around then—the Clara Ward Singers, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Marion Williams with the Ward Singers, Albertina Walker and Shirley Caesar with the Caravans, Brother Joe May—they used to call him the Thunderbolt of the Middle West, he was like a bolt of lightnin’ comin’ out of the sky!—and we had the Soul Stirrers, with Sam Cooke. I toured with Sam in London right before he died, about two weeks before he passed. Mahalia Jackson was a big idol of mine, too; but a lot of the effects and rhythms you hear on my songs, I got ‘em from the trains that passed by my house. Like “Lucille” came from a train—Dadas-dada-dada-dada, I got that from the train. AG: You took a break from music for a while. Was that for religious reasons? LITTLE RICHARD: No, I went to school. I really needed to study business, I needed to learn how to take care of my financial means and needs, so that’s what I did. It’d be good for all musicians to take a course in business, because you can’t control no accountant that knows figures better than you do, and when you get ready to retire, you won’t have nothin’ to retire with. It’s a cold cut business. AG: Elvis apparently used three different types of hair pomade at the same time. What do you use to keep yours so spectacular? LITTLE RICHARD: I spray mine. But you know, my hair is much harder than Elvis’s, it’s more coarse than his, and so it stands up anyway. Elvis and I was very good friends—people try to make out we was rivals, but it wasn’t like that, we were real good friends; but later Colonel Parker wouldn’t let him have no visitors. He was a nice, humble guy, and a great entertainer. AG: Be honest—how many times have you slipped out to Hollywood Boulevard to check out your star? LITTLE RICHARD: I haven’t! I pass it all the time and forget to look over there. My son says, “Richard, it’s your star,” but I forget about it. It took\n\n4\n\nANDY GILL\n\nso long to get it, y’understand? I wish my mother could have been alive to see it, but like everything I got, it took a long time to get. Because really and truthfully, they didn’t want me to have it, y’know? I worked like a dog for what I got, ‘cause they wasn’t used to no person at the time bein’ flamboyant like I was. Before Elton John and David Bowie, I was dressin’ like that—although both Elton John and David Bowie are unbelievable entertainers, fantastic, I love both of them, they’re sweet people. AG: If you could pick one greatest achievement of your life, what would it be? LITTLE RICHARD: To me, in my life, ‘cause I came from a poor black family of twelve in a little country town [Macon, Georgia], my greatest achievement would have to be “Tutti Frutti.” It took me out of the kitchen—I was a dishwasher at the Greyhound bus station, makin’ ten dollars a week workin’ twelve hours a day, and “Tutti Frutti” was a blessin’ and a lesson. I thank God for “Tutti Frutti”!\n\nNOTE 1. The piece originally appeared in Mojo (December 1999).

The revue opened with the gray check-suited, eight-piece Kings of Rhythm pounding away at “I Was Made To Love Her” à la King Curtis, with mighty fine blowing from tenorist Gerald Gray. The full lineup contained Leon Blue (piano), Lee Miles (bass), Odell Stokes (guitar), Howell Portier (drums), and horn men Eddie Burks, Jimmy Reed, Gerald Gray, and David Kines. A brief jazzy instrumental led into “Our Day Will Come,” for which the brass men doubled on maracas to provide an appropriate Latin tinge. Ike stepped out, brilliantly clad in a green suit, and contributed a superbly executed King-Rush blues guitar solo. Superbly amplified, his skillful note-bending echoed round the hall. Jerking like a puppet, Ike performed a short but hugely exciting rocking blues, and with the tenor man playing fit to blow his reed out, it was music I would have preferred to hear more of, even to the omission of some subsequent vocals.\n\nI\n\n6\n\nBILL MILLAR\n\nHowever, it was not to be. Jimmy Thomas, resplendent in white, took up the stand for “Knock on Wood” and “Respect.” It is odd that Jimmy works as a little-known feature act on a revue of this kind. Someone has to fill the spot, but somehow, as with Prince Albert in 1966, Jimmy seemed to be as exciting and polished as many a more well-known soul artist. Not the greatest choice of material, but his shrill, wild voice was the equal of those heard on the definitive versions. More rock ‘n’ roll came with the surprising inclusion of “Nadine,” on which Ike provided two admirable solos. In the lull that followed, while Ike replaced a broken string, Odell Stokes played solo on “Soul Serenade.” The Ikettes, utterly gorgeous in brightly colored minishifts, took command with a rousing version of “You Got Me Humming.” Female groups are not everybody’s favorite, but Ike chooses his girls well, and three of the team, although fairly new to the revue, proved to be more than adequate replacements. With Paulette in the lead, they swung into “Dancing in the Street” and followed with “So Fine” close harmony; hectic but exact dancing; great gospel-inclined lead vocals and bewitching looks—the four girls excelled at everything. It was obvious, from her first number, that Tina Turner is the most exciting female performer in the rhythm and blues idiom today. Superlatives like “wild” or “primitive” cannot do her justice. With the Ikettes remaining on stage, Tina, in a figure-hugging red mini, opened with “Sweet Soul Music.” Almost uninteresting now that everyone features it, but Tina and the Ikettes made it unmistakably theirs. How she manages to dance like she does one will never know. On “A Love Like Yours” the Ikettes wailed in authentic gospel style while the band ceased playing and Tina preached with an intensity that was embarrassing for some. A noisy, jumping version of “A Fool in Love” preceded “River Deep Mountain High.” From the point of view of bettering their reception, it might have been more appropriate to save the latter for the finale, but, nevertheless, it was received, not unnaturally, with more gusto than anything else and the strings were not missed at all. Tina, frantically screaming into the stand mike, her hips and hair swinging in unison, clearly equals James Brown for pure emotional raving. Magical Two more pulsating numbers with “Land of 1000 Dances” and “Respect” and the scene on stage became one of utter frenzy. Tina wailed as if in torment and the Ikettes danced and shook maracas as if it were their last public appearance! “Tell The Truth” closed the show, and what a finale! A strobe light flickered over the gyrating Ikettes while Tina and Jimmy Thomas danced, Tina screaming and her hair flying in all directions. A really ex-\n\nTHE IKE AND TINA TURNER REVUE\n\n7\n\nplosive performance and one to which an encore could only have been an anticlimax.\n\nNOTES 1.

It was 1967, and all the world was caught up in the joy of flowers and beads and drugs, swimming in the colors that swirled through the psychedelic haze. Down on the Sunset Strip, where for a year Love had reigned as the hippest band in town, hippies floated about in a state of cosmic bliss. But Arthur Lee wanted no part of it. He’d either seen too much or not seen enough; no one was too sure which. “I don’t think Arthur wanted to leave his space,” reflects Bryan Maclean, the singer and guitarist who was Lee’s foil in Love. “Every place he lived, he’d have gates you had to get through to his house. He would venture out to score whatever he needed, whether chemical or sexual, and that was it. He didn’t hang out, he didn’t show up at clubs.” “Arthur was so difficult to get along with,” remembers David Anderle, then the chief A&R scout at Love’s label, Elektra. “He was always afraid of something, and I could never figure out what it was. He was such an enigma. He wasn’t a hang on the scene like a David Crosby. That’s how I\n\nH\n\n10\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nthink of him, really, as one of the L.A. greats: Brian, Beefheart, Zappa, Neil Young, Arthur—all haunted, reclusive, baffling people.” “Arthur was, and perhaps still is, one of the smartest, most intelligent, and finest musicians I ever met in my entire career of making records,” said Jac Holzman, founder of Elektra and now president of Discovery Records. “As large as his talent, however, was his penchant for isolation and not doing what was necessary to bring his music to his audience. Which was a shame, because he was one of the few geniuses I have met— in all of rock ‘n’ rolldom.”\n\nIt is July 1993, and I’m sitting opposite Arthur Lee in a restaurant on Van Nuys Boulevard, on the other side of Laurel Canyon from Hollywood. Thirty years ago, Arthur probably could have looked down on this very spot from his gated eyrie atop Lookout Mountain. Now he lives here in the Valley with the mere mortals. It’s clear that Arthur is already a little tipsy, and he will down three or four more Bloody Marys during the course of our conversation—if “conversation” you can call a rambling interchange in which he dodges, and for the most part evades, my questions. He is still lean and handsome, it must be said, though still fond of a cheap and unsubtle hairpiece. “I went on a big campaign for a year, telling everyone not to drink,” Arthur grins at me. “But, well, you know . . .” His voice trails off into an indistinct sigh. The word is that Arthur actually achieved sobriety for the aforesaid year and was even engaged to a girl he’d met through AA. Whether this is the same girl to whose nearby apartment he later takes me, I choose not to ask. The girl in question seems fairly together if faintly exasperated by Arthur, who all but ignores her as he busies himself with making me a tape of Rosa Lee Brooks’s “My Diary,” a cracking little soul single he produced way back in 1964, featuring (so he claims) the first session ever played by his friend Jimi Hendrix. A story about Hendrix is one of several disjointed anecdotes with which Arthur regales me in the restaurant in Van Nuys. In 1969, it seems, Jimi and Arthur were in San Diego together, and Hendrix brought a call girl up to Arthur’s hotel room as a kind of present for his friend. According to Arthur, the guitarist then joined them in bed, but—get this—proceeded to come on to Arthur rather than to the girl. When I evince eye-bulging disbelief at this claim, Arthur gives me a nervous laugh, then protests, “I’m serious, man!” Unsure exactly what to believe, I suspect there’s a subtext at work here, and one that has much to do with Arthur’s bitterness at the way Hendrix, Sly, and others appropriated his black-rock/psychedelic-soul style and then received all the kudos for it.\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n11\n\n“I was the first black person wearing those clothes and doing that stuff,” he later says. “And then the credit went to Jimi.” Oh, the pain of being a forgotten pop pioneer—the one who never sold any records.\n\n“We constantly referred to the fact that Arthur was black and I was white,” Bryan Maclean is telling me. “I’m sure it crossed my mind that this was kinda cool—that this could work to our advantage—but we never thought we were gonna change the world.” I’m sitting beside Maclean in an open-topped red pickup, flying down Sunset Boulevard with a hot wind on my face. It is August 1996, exactly three years after my encounter with Arthur Lee. Maclean is a surprise. I’d expected some born-again Brian Jones and what I get is a burly surfer guy, not unlike Gary Busey at the end of Big Wednesday: big and intense and slightly crazed, talking nineteen to the dozen as he bombs along Sunset toward the Pacific Ocean. So much for the Beverly Hills pretty boy who, at the age of eighteen, warbled “Softly to Me” in an artless folk-rock tenor. Much of what Bryan Maclean says on a long drive to Venice and back is shot through with anger toward Arthur, albeit anger tempered by awe at the man’s genius and the spell he seemed to cast over everybody during that heady mid-’60s period. “Arthur had the dominant personality, so his songs got done,” he says matter-of-factly. “I was writing prolifically all through those years, but when we went into the studio he’d say no to every song. Had I been tougher I’d have grabbed him by the collar and thrown him up against the wall.” “There was a slightly twisted, almost homoerotic relationship between Lee and Maclean,” says David Anderle. “Let’s just say Arthur made Bryan’s life miserable.”\n\nWhen Lee and Maclean first met in the summer of 1965, Love had already been going for several months. Except that the band wasn’t called Love, it was called the Grass Roots, and had evolved out of two bands— the LAGs and the American Four—that Lee had led before seeing the folk rock light at an early Byrds show. Lee had been born not in Los Angeles but in Memphis, on March 7, 1945. “My mother was very light-skinned, she could pass for white,” he told me. “She was a schoolteacher, and she came from a long line of schoolteachers.” Uprooted and brought to California at the age of five, Lee, in his own words, was “an only lonely child” whose sole solace seemed to lie in\n\n12\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nmusic. “I started giving him music lessons when he was about ten or eleven,” his mother, Agnes, recalled on the phone before her death in the late 1990s. “His teacher told me that he could play better than she could and that he didn’t need to take any more lessons.” What was Arthur like as a kid? “He was a spoiled brat, but he had a good heart.” “I would listen to Nat ‘King’ Cole, and I’d look at that purple Capitol Records logo on his records,” Arthur said. “I was determined to get a record deal with Capitol, and I did, without the help of a fancy manager or anyone else.” Unfortunately, the LAGs’ sole Capitol 45 rpm release, the sub–Booker T instrumental “Rumble-Still-Skins,” was a woeful disappointment when it appeared in 1963. “It was terrible, really a disgrace,” admitted Arthur. Lee never graduated from Dorsey High, where he’d excelled at basketball and track sports. He was too busy plotting his musical career. While at Dorsey, he’d watched the R&B star Johnny “Guitar” Watson step out of a gold Cadillac wearing a gold suit and flashing gold teeth, and “knew then that I had to have a guitar.” In fact, the lure of gold might have led him into another lifestyle entirely. According to Bryan Maclean, Lee was “known as the baddest guy on the West Side of L.A.” Lee’s first real musical accomplice—and a man who would stick with him right through to Forever Changes—was guitarist Johnny Echols. When Lee formed the LAGs to play R&B covers at local parties, Echols was his first recruit. And when the LAGs turned into the American Four and recorded the “Twist and Shout”–style single “Luci Baines” for the DelFi label, Echols (like Lee himself a light-skinned black kid with processed hair) was still there at his side. Arthur said he and Echols were very influenced by the look of Bobby Womack and the Valentinos, who had “long hair and stuff I’d never seen in my life.” The left turn into white pop culture came when Lee got wind of a happening new scene up in Hollywood in the early spring of 1965. The Byrds were playing at Ciro’s on the Strip, and Lee and Echols went to check them out. Lee was blown away by the new freedom of Beatles-influenced folk rock and by the chiming sound of twelve-string guitars. Just as much of a revelation was seeing Mick Jagger singing “Time Is on My Side” on The Red Skelton Show and catching the Rising Sons—the short-lived, blues-based band formed by Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder—at the Ash Grove on Melrose Avenue. “That’s when I really knew something was happening,” he said. “Arthur was playing R&B,” said Maclean, “and somewhere along the line he decided to take a ride up to the Strip. I don’t think it was opportunistic. I don’t think he thought, ‘Oh, I wanna get in on this.’ I think he sincerely liked the music and the scene.”\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n13\n\nBarely a month after seeing the Byrds, Lee had given his band a comprehensive makeover, junking the previously obligatory covers of “Shotgun” and “Louie Louie” and embracing the punkier, more British Invasion–style sound that would surface on Love’s debut album. It was as though McGuinn and friends had somehow formed a sonic alliance with Messrs. Jagger and Richards. Maclean had grown up in an environment very different from the one that spawned Lee. He was a golden child of privilege, a kid whose parents mingled with Hollywood celebrities, a boy whose first sweetheart was a pubescent Liza Minnelli. “She and I would do songs from The Wizard of Oz. My whole background was Rodgers and Hammerstein—as a kid I’d stand in front of the mirror and conduct, or I’d be Curly in Oklahoma. I created my own world.” One day Maclean swung by the Sandal Shop in Westwood and heard a group of people singing Appalachian ballads. The conversion to folk music and its culture was instant. Soon he too was singing and playing guitar in coffeehouses and clubs like the Balladeer and the Troubadour. After befriending David Crosby, Maclean was hired as a roadie by the Byrds. “For a seventeen-year-old kid it was heaven,” he told me. “Crosby and I got along perfectly. I didn’t understand what everybody was complaining about, because he was just like me!” Maclean parted company with the Byrds shortly before their English tour in August ‘65, “and when I came back to L.A. there was a whole scene that the Byrds had created, but without them.” Maclean said he knew nothing about Lee prior to meeting him in 1965. When the two got talking, Lee told Maclean about his band and Maclean hipped Lee to his relationship with the Byrds. “He invited me to come and hear him at the Brave New World,” said Bryan. “And that was the beginning of it. “Arthur was smart to get me in the band. I think he let me join more for who I knew than for what I could do. I brought him the whole Byrds scene, first at the Brave New World, then at Bido Lito’s, and ultimately at the Whisky a Go Go. And we became the king of the street bands in Hollywood.” Rodney Bingenheimer (“the Mayor of Sunset Strip”) recalls that Love was one of the first bands he saw after moving down to L.A. from northern California. “He was this black guy, but he always seemed like part of the white scene,” he told me. “He wasn’t playing soul, he was playing this jangly guitar music. It was almost like he was like the black Roger McGuinn.” It’s hard now to imagine what a dash the group must have cut when they first broke through at the end of 1965. On one level they were one\n\n14\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nof a number of L.A bands walking a thin line between folk rock and garage punk. But on another they were unique: a “two-tone” band playing an amazing hybrid of folk, soul, and psychedelic pop at a time when there were still strong racial and stylistic divides in the American music industry. And at the center of it all was Arthur, a black freak on the white scene, a ghetto punk in beads and pebble glasses. “He cut quite an imposing figure,” wrote Three Dog Night’s Jimmy Greenspoon in his autobiography One Is the Loneliest Number. “Dark glasses, a scarf around his neck, Edwardian shirts and—what was to become his trademark—an old pair of army boots with one unlaced. The audience became followers of King Arthur Lee. He was a Pied Piper who would lead them down the road to a different form of consciousness.” When Lee snarled his venom-fueled version of “My Little Red Book”— a Bacharach and David song that Manfred Mann had recorded—it was clear that Los Angeles had found its very own Mick Jagger. Only this one was a black Mick Jagger, a guy that L.A. music biz veteran Denny Bruce described wryly as “a black American imitating a white Englishman imitating a black American.” The British influence was only too manifest in Lee originals like “Can’t Explain,” its title borrowed from The Who and its drum fill from the Stones’ “Get Off My Cloud.” But the mesh of guitars—Lee’s, Echols’, and Maclean’s—was pure L.A., as were the Byrdsy “You I’ll Be Following” and the mournful pangs of “Message to Pretty” and “Signed D.C.,” the latter supposedly a stark first-person account of drummer Don Conka’s heroin addiction. From the outset a highlight of Love’s live set was Maclean’s frantic rendering of “Hey Joe,” delivered without a vocal safety net at every show. “The way Crosby had done it, it almost had a Mose Allison type feel,” Bryan remembered. “When we did it, it was like punk rock. I lost my voice every night singing it. It was completely new—folk rock with a punk edge—and it put us on the map.” It took Maclean’s live version of “Hey Joe” at Bido Lito’s to convince thirty-four-year-old New York record executive Jac Holzman that he’d “found the band I was looking for” in Love. Holzman’s Elektra label had been a bastion of folk music on the East Coast, but Holzman could see the times they were a-changin’ and—like Atlantic’s Ahmet Ertegun with Buffalo Springfield, whom Holzman had originally wanted to sign— made up his mind to muscle in on the emerging West Coast action. By late January 1966 the band, complete with new rhythm section Ken Forssi (bass) and Alban “Snoopy” Pfisterer (drums), was recording its first album at the Sunset Sound Recorders studio. The results were engaging if primitive. “What you hear on that first album is just an ener-\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n15\n\nvated, attenuated version of what we were like live,” Bryan Maclean sighed. “It didn’t have the distortion or the energy or the impact.” Love remains one of the better debuts of its time, a punky, exciting mix of rockers and ballads. “Little Red Book,” which got to number 52 on the U.S. chart, sizzles, as do “Hey Joe” and the unashamedly “Hey Joe”–esque “My Flash on You.” “Gazing” is like an acid age remake of The Crystals’ “Then He Kissed Me”—L.A. teen symphonics mutating into jangled psychedelia. With its cover portrait depicting the band as a gang of hip Sunset Strip hoods—the picture was shot in the grounds of Bela Lugosi’s old estate in Laurel Canyon—Love trumpeted the presence of a major new musical force on the southern California scene. By the end of the year their influence would be felt strongly in the sound of bands like the Seeds, the Leaves, the Lollipop Shoppe, and the Music Machine. When the album appeared in May ‘66, Love was the toast of the town’s underground, playing sold-out residencies at Bido Lito’s and at the Hullabaloo on Hollywood Boulevard. “We were the biggest group in L.A.,” Arthur said. “The street where Bido Lito’s was, that whole street from Selma Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard was packed with people. At the Hullabaloo we had people lined up all the way down to Sunset.” When Love played the still hipper Whisky a Go Go, farther west along Sunset, Lee claimed they “started the whole hippie thing” in tandem with an in-crowd of freaks led by aging beatnik sculptor Vito Paulekas. Bryan remembered these days as ones of innocent mischief. “We were just having a ball. We didn’t care about the implications of being a multiracial group or about civil rights. We’d be riding around, holding, and Johnny would say it looked suspicious—a white guy in a car with ‘a spade and an Ethiopian’!” Love were early masters of surly pop attitude, as reporters from teen magazines like KRLA Beat and Hit Parader quickly discovered: Far from epitomizing “the whole hippie thing,” the band came on like Jones and Rotten a decade before their time. When KRLA Beat’s Rochelle Reed interviewed them in June 1966 in the legendary “Castle”—the exotic mansion they were renting in the Los Feliz hills—they treated her abominably, psyching her out with mind games and telling her they’d met during a gang fight. Any fears that such attention-seeking arrogance was premature were allayed that month when Love cut the mind-shattering “Seven and Seven Is” at Sunset Sound Recorders. To say that this is one of the great rock singles of the 1960s is a sorry understatement; it’s an apocalyptic masterpiece, hurtling furiously along for two and a quarter minutes before climaxing in the sound of an atomic bomb.\n\n16\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nBlasting away any folk rock preconceptions lingering from Love’s debut, “Seven and Seven Is” spelled out the obvious, which was that the band had plunged headfirst into the oceanic realm of hallucinogenic drugs. “If I don’t stop crying, it’s because I have got no eyes,” Lee yelped. “My bible’s in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized!” The single became Love’s biggest hit, reaching number 33 in America and paving the way for the group’s second album. Da Capo, recorded in September and October 1966 at the RCA-Victor studio in Hollywood where the Rolling Stones had cut “Satisfaction,” was a giant step forward from Love, introducing a psychedelic and almost baroque edge to the band’s garage folk sound. “I feel that I found myself, or planted a seed of who I am today, in Da Capo,” Arthur told Lenny Kaye in 1970. “I was born in Da Capo.” Da Capo almost ranks alongside its successor, Forever Changes, as a summer-of-love classic. Certainly there are few more astounding sequences of music than “Stephanie Knows Who,” “Orange Skies,” “Que Vida!” “Seven and Seven Is,” “The Castle,” and “She Comes in Colours,” six extraordinary songs that blend psychedelia and punk rock with Latin and Broadway influences. “Da Capo was the ultimate of what I call show-tune rock,” said Bryan. “What you have is a guy who grew up on Rodgers and Hammerstein and Aaron Copland, and who worshipped Burt Bacharach, and then a guy who grew up on the West Side of L.A.—in the Crenshaw-Adams district—on R&B. And it was that mixture that made it interesting and made it unique. The Love sound, if you want to be really honest, was Arthur copying me.” Self-serving as this sounds, it may not be so far-fetched when one considers the radical changes in Lee’s writing on songs like “Que Vida!” and “Stephanie Knows Who”—or, for that matter, the precipitous decline in the quality of Lee’s music after parting ways with Maclean. “My theory is that Arthur didn’t write all the songs he’s credited with,” says John Tobler, the self-styled “Captain of the Fleet in the Quest for Arthur Lee,” whose early to mid-1970s Zigzag interviews with Lee did so much to keep the Love cult alive. “I think Maclean may have had quite a bit more to do with them than we realize.” Yet it was Lee who steered Love away from the pumped-up angst of “Hey Joe” toward a new strain of psychedelic muzak that David Anderle termed “punk with strings.” Underground rock gonzo Sandy Pearlman, a disciple of Richard (Aesthetics of Rock) Meltzer, wrote that Forever Changes “finishes what Da Capo began—Arthur Lee’s insane mutation of Mick Jagger into Johnny Mathis!” “Love started out with a kind of garagey folk rock, but once they got into their own style it wasn’t like anybody else,” says Bomp Records boss\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n17\n\nand psych-punk sage Greg Shaw. “It had a kind of orchestral sense to it which wasn’t influenced by The Left Banke and didn’t sound like Tim Buckley but which was really unique.” A key point about Love was how much closer they were to the L.A. pop tradition of Brian Wilson (and even The Association) than they were to the loose, faux-live sound of the new San Francisco bands. For the Grateful Dead or the Jefferson Airplane, it would have been anathema to use strings or flutes on a record. For Love, it was part and parcel of a Hollywood pop sensibility that led seamlessly on to the lushly orchestrated Forever Changes. Tied in with this was Lee’s distance from—or unwillingness to be part of—the new acid rock scene. “When we played up in San Francisco [Love made their Bay Area debut at the Avalon Ballroom on April 8, 1966, and played the Fillmore with the Dead, no less, on July 3], Arthur would just stay in his hotel room,” remembered Bryan. “I had a whole life up in San Francisco, but he didn’t know anybody there. I think he was actually afraid of people.” Undoubtedly one of the factors that really handicapped Love was Lee’s insularity, his lack of interest in life outside Los Angeles. Even their Elektra labelmate Jim Morrison was moved to comment that “I don’t think [Love] were willing to travel and go through all the games and numbers that you have to.” “Arthur was always very aloof,” says Harvey Kubernik, who saw Love in all its incarnations and later interviewed Lee in his capacity as West Coast correspondent for Melody Maker. “He didn’t exactly lead the league in schmoozing, and he certainly never understood the concept of ingratiating yourself. Arthur blocked people off from getting to know him. The whole point about those sunglasses he wore was that you couldn’t see into him.” “We didn’t do the things we should’ve done,” Arthur admitted to Lenny Kaye in 1970. “We were always on the trip of wanting to do the right thing at the right time, making sure everything was the right time for us. And we passed up a lot of things, man.” Bryan Maclean put things more tersely: “We broke covenant with our record company by not cooperating, not making it worth their while to distribute our music. I didn’t know any better—I really was naive as far as business was concerned—but I think Arthur did.” For a long time there was a theory that Lee had taken umbrage at the supposed favoritism displayed by Elektra toward labelmates The Doors. The irony here is that it was Lee who urged Jac Holzman to see The Doors playing at the Whisky and who even persuaded the Elektra boss to check them out again after he—like many record executives in Hollywood at the time—was left unimpressed by Jim Morrison’s heavy-handed stage\n\n18\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nact. For their part, too, The Doors signed to Elektra primarily because of Love, a group they worshipped. “Jim Morrison used to sit outside my door when I lived in Laurel Canyon,” said Arthur. “He wanted to hang out with me, but I didn’t wanna hang out with anybody.” “When I came to Elektra, it was Love-land,” said David Anderle. “Very quickly it became Doors-land. It had nothing to do with The Doors being all white it was just that The Doors thing was so fast. Nor was Arthur apparently that desperate for the success The Doors had. He was the night creature! As was Jim, of course, but there was some big fear cloud with Arthur. Believe me, Holzman loved Arthur, but something happened to him, and I don’t know if it was drugs, alcohol, or something biochemical.” Drugs certainly played their part in Love’s seeming lack of ambition. Introduced to the band after the release of Da Capo by their road manager Neil Rappaport—a long-term junkie whose overdose death was later commemorated in Four Sail’s “Your Friend and Mine”—heroin soon had Echols and Forssi in its vice-like grip. Word of Love’s heroin use spread quickly through the rock community, confirming their outsider status and making them personae non grata at the big flower-power party during that summer of love. Many people found the band not just surly but intimidating, profoundly at odds with the prevailing spirit of peace and well, love. “I don’t want to say that Arthur was demonic,” said David Anderle, “but he was very manipulative and destructive. See, Arthur was not really a hippie, he was more of a punk than a hippie. There was almost a gangster thing going on there—rule by intimidation. But at the same time, he could be so sweet. It was totally schizoid, and maybe that did have something to do with being black in a white world.”\n\nIf Love’s members were hoods, they were psychedelic hoods: The tension between punk and flower power—between menace and beauty—lay at the heart of what made their songs so compelling. Nowhere is this more evident than on Forever Changes, the album the band began recording in June 1967, the very midsummer of love. The circumstances of Forever Changes’ creation hardly augured well. When engineer turned producer Bruce Botnick convened with the band in early June, it was immediately obvious to him that they were in no fit state to record. With Lee tripping round the clock, and Maclean not even bothering to show up for rehearsals, it looked as if Love were going to need help from session musicians. Botnick proceeded to book drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Billy Strange, and pianist Don Randi for the first session of June 9.\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n19\n\nFortunately, the presence of Blaine and company had the effect of literally shocking Love into action. “The band sat there and listened to the musicians recording “Andmoreagain” and “The Daily Planet,” and it sparked them,” Botnick recalled. “They were sitting there crying, but they realized they’d blown it, got their act together, and recorded the rest of the album.” By late September, when David Angel’s horn and string parts were added, Forever Changes had been finished. Here, on one record, was the sound of Los Angeles undergoing a seachange from jingle-jangle, Cuban-heel innocence into strange-days, Manson-era weirdness—the same direction in which The Doors were headed. If Lee could celebrate the Sunset Strip spirit of carnival on the exhilarating “Maybe the People Would Be the Times, or Between Clark and Hilldale,” on other tracks he took a far darker view of the hippie bacchanal. Despite a musical palette more heavily weighted toward strings and mariachi-style brass than toward acid rock guitars, Forever Changes had a fix on the surreal and disturbing flavor of the times that only The Doors (and possibly the Brian Wilson of Smile) matched. “Sometimes my life is so eerie,” Lee sang on “The Red Telephone,” “and if you think I’m happy, paint me white.” “Arthur had this big house right on top of Mulholland Drive,” recalled Ken Forssi, “and we’d look down over the city from there. Arthur would sit up there staring out and wondering about all the ambulances.” Lee himself has said that he had “a thing about dying” at the time and that Forever Changes was meant to be “my last words to this life . . . it’s like death is in there.” The album is strewn with images of horror and mutilation—of guns and blood, and sirens and accidents, of things that don’t necessarily make a lot of sense but that stick stubbornly in the mind once heard: the “water mixed with blood” in “A House Is Not a Motel,” the “snot caked against my pants” in “Live And Let Live,” the toys that “plastic Nancy” buys to keep her kids “in practice/waiting on the war” in “The Daily Planet,” the evocation of the madhouse at the end of “The Red Telephone.” On few other ‘60s albums is the Vietnam war hovering so obviously in the background. With its intricately crafted arrangements, idiosyncratic time changes, and overlapping vocal tracks, Forever Changes fully merits its reputation as L.A.’s very own Sgt. Pepper. Curiously, it fared considerably better in Britain than it did in America. Released in November 1967, as the year of the summer of love was drawing to a close, it reached number 24 on the U.K. album chart. (In America it never rose any higher than number 152.) It could certainly be argued that the British have been largely responsible for keeping the album’s “classic” status alive over three decades, notwithstanding its standing with neo-psychedelic acts in America.\n\n20\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\nAmong Love’s most ardent admirers is Robert Plant, who gave Lee the red-carpet treatment after inviting him to a Led Zeppelin show at the Forum in L.A. in 1975. It’s no coincidence that a host of bands, from The Teardrop Explodes to Teenage Fanclub, has invoked the genius of Arthur Lee or that Alan McGee flew him over to London for Creation’s tenthanniversary bash at the Albert Hall.\n\nMasterpiece though it was, Forever Changes marked the beginning of the end for Love’s original lineup. “I really wanted a Love band, a Love thing,” Arthur told me. “I wanted to be the Beatles, the Stones, a real unit, but everybody had different behavior patterns. One guy was this way, another guy was that way, and I’m not Atlas, man, I can’t hold up the world.” With Bryan wanting to go in a more soft rock, ballad-oriented direction, Echols and Forssi tending more to the power-trio sound of Cream and Hendrix, and Arthur too stoned and disillusioned to pull them back together, a split was inevitable. There was one last release from Love Mk. 1, the brilliant single “Your Mind and We Belong Together” backed with “Laughing Stock,” recorded at the end of January 1968, possibly as part of a fourth album that was never completed. Maclean was the first member to jump ship, in the summer of 1968: “I went up to see Mike Gruber, who was managing the band at the time, and gave him my notice. Arthur was, like, ‘You can’t quit, ‘cause you’re already fired!’” After Echols, Forssi, and Michael Stuart quit the band, rumors began filtering out of L.A. as to the state that Lee himself was in. “I think Arthur got demoralized,” said Bryan. “I think that happened to a lot of people in those days. We all thought we were on a rocket ship that was just going to continue to go straight up. I thought this was always going to be my life.” What saved Lee was strolling into a Valley dive called the Brass Ring one night and seeing a band led by an old friend called Noony Ricketts. Backed up by guitarist Gary Rowles, bassist Frank Fayad, and drummer George Suranovich—musicians Lee himself had played with occasionally in an early 1960s band called The V.I.P.s—Ricketts was blasting out hard rock songs that fired Arthur up and made him question the music he’d been making with Love. “When I went out there, I had done this soft album and been influenced by what people told me to do,” he told Lenny Kaye. “I’d even written my songs according to this trip of trying to get airplay and all this bullshit with the soft rock trip so that we could expand our group. And here this four-piece group was. They were as loud as fuck. They were out of sight. And, like, Jimi Hendrix had come out, and it really tripped me\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n21\n\nout that here’s a cat who came out three years after I had seen The Byrds and freaked out and did his whole trip—he comes out and plays this loud music that I always wanted to do in the studio.” Lee wasted no time in luring Fayad and Suranovich away from Ricketts and in hiring lead guitarist Jay Donnellan. The new Love set about recording almost thirty new songs, ten of which made up Four Sail, a final album for Elektra, and the remainder of which comprised Out There, Love’s double-album debut for its new label, Blue Thumb. Both records appeared in late 1969, and both, frankly, were dreadful— not a patch on anything Lee had done with the original band. The sad truth is that nothing Lee has written since “Your Mind and We Belong Together” and “Laughing Stock” warrants comparison with even the most lightweight song on Love. Fayad and Suranovich may have been the best rhythm section he’d ever had, but the Lee of Four Sail and Out There just sounds burned out, bereft of inspiration. Even when he joined forces with Hendrix during Love’s May 1970 tour of Britain and cut a bunch of glorified jam sessions in London’s Olympic Studios, the tapes only yielded “The Everlasting First,” the indifferent first track on the execrable False Start (1970). The point, surely, was this: The prince of orchestral acid pop found it painfully hard to survive in the era of heavy electric rock. Forever Changes could stand alongside Sgt. Pepper, but Four Sail and Out There weren’t fit to stand in the same room as Led Zeppelin II. The solo Vindicator (1972) had slightly more going for it: It was punchier, closer to barroom glam rock than to the hopeless albums by Love Mk. 2. Guitarist Charlie Karp kept things tight and gritty, and Lee’s lyrics were at least zany: Song titles included “You Can Save Up to 50% But You’re Still a Long Ways from Home” and “Every Time I Look Up I’m Down,” or “White Dog (I Don’t Know What That Means).” By 1976 Lee had all but quit the music business and was apparently working with his stepfather painting houses in South Central L.A. “When I left the band, nothing ever happened for Arthur again, and I think that just galls him,” said Bryan. “He’s probably more bitter and resentful over that than anything.” Maclean glosses over the fact that nothing much has happened for him either, although he did write “Don’t Toss Us Away” for the 1985 debut album by his half-sister Maria McKee’s band Lone Justice and recently had a song covered by country star Patty Loveless. The 1970s saw him bottoming out on booze and turning to Christianity in an attempt to halt the unraveling of his life. En passant, Bryan mentioned the ill-fated, swiftly forgotten “Love reunion” of 1978. “It was another case of Arthur spinning out and me going, ‘Okay, I’ve already experienced this, I’ll see you around,’” he said.\n\n22\n\nBARNEY HOSKYNS\n\n“It’s like the blush of youth goes and then it’s just sort of the bitterness that starts to surface, and the anger, and the resentment.”\n\nIt is two days (July 1993) since I watched Arthur Lee and Love play the Palomino, a rundown roots rock dive in the Valley that’s played host to hundreds of country renegades over the decades. Backed by Baby Lemonade, a young four-piece band whose enthusiasm almost made up for its curious insensitivity to songs like “Orange Skies” and “Signed D.C.,” Arthur did his best before a roomful of fans brandishing album sleeves for autographs. Love’s next gig would be a support to Doors tribute band Wild Child—and if you don’t think that’s ironic, paint me black. As he sinks the dregs of another Bloody Mary, I ask Arthur what effect acid had on his music back in the mid-1960s. He fixes me with a leery glare. “I don’t know anything about acid at all,” he suddenly snaps. “I have nothing good to say about any drugs or alcohol for young people. I’m not going to elaborate on anything that would put a dent in a young person’s mind. I’ve been out there, man. Now I just live in an apartment, don’t worry about the butcher.”\n\nA little less than two years after my evening with him, Arthur Lee was arrested at his apartment in Sherman Oaks, not far from Van Nuys. Police had been called to the third-floor apartment on Kester Avenue by a neighbor who claimed that Arthur had fired a shot, then pointed a gun at him and threatened to “blow him away.” “It was total rubbish,” said Doug Thomas, who not only was with Arthur that Saturday night in July 1995 but claims that the gun in question was fired, accidentally, by himself. A drummer who has played for thirty years in West Coast–influenced bands in his native New Zealand, Thomas was visiting Lee in L.A. to discuss the possibility of releasing some new Love songs. “We were planning to put out an album called Forever Changes II,” he told me on the phone. Thomas said that he and his wife were sitting around with Arthur and his girlfriend, Susan Levine, drinking a little wine and watching a video of Three Amigos. At some point, Lee asked Thomas to look through some old boxes for videos of recent Love shows in Europe. Upon opening one such box in a closet belonging to Lee’s ex-girlfriend, Thomas found what turned out to be a .44 Magnum. “So I pulled it out, walked through to the patio, and said, ‘Hey, Arthur! Arriba!’ The second time I pulled the trigger it went off, making the biggest noise I’ve ever heard.”\n\nPAINT ME WHITE\n\n23\n\nLee and Levine immediately grabbed the gun, since both knew that— as a felon who’d been convicted on a couple of assault and drugs charges back in the 1980s—Arthur could land in serious trouble for possessing such a thing. Thomas maintains that Arthur had no idea the gun was in his ex-girlfriend’s closet. After a short while, about ten policemen arrived, handcuffed Lee and the others, and took Lee to the Van Nuys central police station. A few hours later, they searched the apartment in Sherman Oaks and found a box of 500 armor-piercing bullets. When Lee left L.A. to tour Europe in the summer, various Love fans suggested he stay in France or Spain as an exile rather than risk imprisonment by returning home. “He said he wouldn’t,” said Doug Thomas. “He said he was going back to prove his innocence.” Little did he know that when the case came to trial he would be up against a notorious D.A. known as “the Dragon Woman” and a jury bused in—like the jury that acquitted the LAPD officers in the Rodney King case—from Simi Valley. The jury ignored Thomas’s evidence and found Lee guilty on all charges. A year after O. J. Simpson was set free, the Love singer was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, a victim of California’s stringent “three strikes and you’re out” ruling. He served six years, emerging in 2002 to tour once again as the leader of Love.\n\nWas Arthur Lee one of the all-time rock greats, or was he just an opportunist who happened to seize a moment of pop incandescence? Was he, in the words of David Anderle, someone “with a bigger vision than just making dumb rock music,” or did he just cannily exploit the spirit of the Sunset Strip? Was he a genius or a rogue? Perhaps he was both—half intimidating hood, half sweet-natured Pied Piper. He himself hinted at a radical split in his personality when he described Vindicator as “a Dr. Hyde World-Wide Production”; others have suggested that he is a borderline schizophrenic. “Arthur is not of this world,” Jac Holzman once remarked. “He lives in a world of his own creation.” “It’s hard to say how deep the imbalance and lack of integrity go with Arthur,” said the born-again Bryan Maclean, two and a half years before the heart attack that killed him. “He lacked repentance, always.” “I’m a very private person,” Lee told me. “Chico Hamilton said the music is in the street, but for me, the music is in me. I am the music.”\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPA U L\n\nG I L R OY\n\nB O L D AS LOVE?\n\nJIMI’S AFROCYBERDELIA AND THE CHALLENGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNOT-YET I am of no particular race.

His short life reveals so many inspired transgressions of redundant musical and racial rules that it’s hard to know where to begin. Seattle, New York, and swinging London all provide promising points of departure. Each of them accents his life in significant ways, but none of them is adequate to carry its full weight or represent that itinerant existence properly in its beautiful, liquid complexity. Counterpointing the gypsy life that he chose and moralized, the music itself requires any convincing critical engagement with him to be polycentric. We have to be as able as he was to accommodate the absorption of the very different disciplines that were required by the U.S. Army, the South, and the chitlin’ circuit. The bad sign under which he was born must be recognized as a complex constellation. There are ethnocentric pressures to be resisted and a whole lot of well-intentioned but unhelpful mystification that belittles Jimi by making him superhuman—somebody who did not have to work or practice in order to achieve greatness. The sheer, patient labor involved alone makes this music something more than an intuitive or, worse yet, a wholly instinctive emanation of black being. We should start with the blues because that’s where he started, but not get trapped there, on the threshold of the red house they accommodate. We begin with that dwelling in order to better appreciate how Jimi playfully possessed the blues and amended its workings so that they would be adequate to the technological and moral challenges arising from the unsettled cultural environment of the decolonizing cold war world. We must also see how he managed to overcome tradition’s constraints, twisting them into creative opportunities, electrifying them, blending and bending them into different registers of protest and affirmation. He was always prepared creatively to damage the superficial integrity of the musical traditions in which he located himself. That modernist desire to destroy and shock was pivotal, and it was not just confined to what he did in the act of performing. Gypsy that he was, he had wanted to be buried in England, his adopted homeland. Yet his greatest moment as a live performer was the Woodstock Festival’s systematically artful assault on the patriotic musical heart of the imperial nation in whose paratroops he had previously served with pride, then hell-bent on destroying the Vietcong with the same fervor that currently guides its impossible and interminable war on terror. Through that exemplary boldness—a quality he links with love—we can understand what was and still is at stake in the unfolding of a revolution that draws its poetry and its soundtrack from the future. Hendrix’s reaching for and conjuring up not just the future but a more philosophically coherent “not-yet” unsettled his contemporaries. I think that assertively utopian quality is what still enables his work to speak to\n\nBOLD AS LOVE?\n\n27\n\nus so powerfully. It was a product of his desire not, as the previous generation had done, to interact mournfully with the sunrise of the next day by serenading it, greeting every condemnation to prolonged suffering in the industrialized valley of the dry bones with resignation and defiance. Albert King, whose epochal “Blues at Sunrise”1 could be taken as the limit of that exhilarating approach, was famed as a driver on construction sites. His legend says he could pick up a carpet delicately with his bulldozer. Jimi, no habitué of the killing floor, seems only ever to have been a soldier and a musician. His alienation and his sense of what work could be and where it stood in relation to the freedoms that were necessary in order to feel free, stone free, were utterly different. The primal scene of Jimi’s existential encounter with the prospect of radical autonomy was still the dawn, the approved neotraditional staging, but unlike Albert, from whom he had drawn such compelling inspiration, Jimi aimed to articulate musical sound that could approximate the power of those first rays in reilluminating the world. It is easy to miss the full significance of this stance by just saying that Hendrix was ahead of his time or that it has taken thirty or so years to catch up with him. It certainly took that long for the Brazilians to come up with “Afrocyberdelia,” a workable proper name for his revolution. A similar period has been required to make his technical departures part of the standard repertoire of his instrument. Comments on his “avant garde” position reveal fragments of a larger truth, but the real issue is not that Hendrix was ahead of his time, but rather that he was able to pronounce another time: shifting and sculpting temporality itself so that his willing listeners were transported from one time to another. This was not the chance result of his ascent coinciding with the appearance of an oppositional, questioning youth culture to which recreational drugs had become integral. The gloriously damaged sound of those first songs announced and then dramatically enacted the impact of a colorful counterculture that beat back the monochrome tones in which a gray, decaying—Jimi would probably have said “plastic”—world had been enveloped. A massive gesture of refusal was distilled in the anthemic insubordinate chorus of “If Six Was Nine,” but it was evident everywhere: in his dandyism, in his characteristic mixture of politeness and assertiveness, and in his appetite for theatrical, “autodestructive” performances. I remember the impact of those daring, wild, and dissonant opening notes of “Purple Haze,” which hit the airwaves in England in the spring of 1967 just as I was starting to become interested in being a guitar player myself. The line “lately things just don’t seem the same” coupled with the singer’s apparent ease of access to the sky on which he would bestow his kiss all\n\n28\n\nPAUL GILROY\n\nconfirmed the same historic novelty. Things were suddenly and dramatically different. To my awestruck ears, the question “Are You Experienced?” gave thrilling voice to the same cataclysmic, intergenerational rupture. The blues was there, allright, but this was not a Lightnin’ Hopkins record or the archaic, beautiful fruits of an ethnomusicological excursion down to Stovall’s Plantation. Blues temporality seemed to have been transformed in an act of modernist daring that was also instrumental in commanding the attention of new transnational audiences. These were often remote dissenting listeners who knew that six could indeed become nine without touching the quality of their fragile existence on the proliferating margins of the overdeveloped world and its abbreviated consumer freedoms. This approach to specifying the enduring value of Hendrix’s art as a fiery, insistent pulse within a novel, dissident culture runs counter to all the sentimental approaches that strive to folksify his very twentiethcentury legacy, to imprison it in the blues that was both its launch pad and its ballast, to confine it to the United States or make it all roots and no routes, all voodoo child and no highway child. Those interpretative habits can be resisted in the name of the global network that he helped to animate. Toward that end, we should always remember that Hendrix was a soldier and think of him as an ex-paratrooper who became a hippie in an act of profound and complete treason that would make him an enemy of power until this day. I was thinking about the ongoing potency of that moral decision as I stood at Jimi’s windswept grave on the outskirts of Seattle, accompanied only by a dignified young man in military uniform who told me that he passed his interminable days listening to Hendrix mp3s on the computer in the local army recruiting station where he worked. Jimi’s bold choice of peace and love instead of war was coupled with implacable opposition to the absurd and destructive “ego scene” that official politics had become. His understanding of that historic blend made him a marked man and a new man. Talking back to Frantz Fanon’s theories of revolution at about the same time Jimi moved to England, Martin Luther King, Jr. had argued that the choice of love required a special strength and paid a special dividend. He continued, “Humanity is waiting for something other than blind imitation of the past. If we want to advance a step further, if we want to turn over a new leaf and really set a new man afoot, we must begin to turn mankind away from the long and desolate night of violence. May it not be that the new man the world needs is the nonviolent man? A dark, desperate, confused and sin-sick world waits for this new kind of man and this new kind of power.”2 There is the sound of the future being enlisted\n\nBOLD AS LOVE?\n\n29\n\nin the struggle against racism, which is also a conflict over the nature of masculinity. At that moment, tomorrow was on the side of those who wanted to enhance democracy. Inequality, callousness, and merciless economic exploitation were briefly but powerfully associated with the past. Their presence was experienced fleetingly as anachronistic. “Third Stone from the Sun” is only the most obvious example of how Jimi makes that revolutionary feeling audible and attractive. The urgent warning communicated by “House Burning Down” provides an intriguing example of how Hendrix’s music could ask tough, demanding questions about the ethics of care in a segregated society and refer his listeners not only to the alternative possibilities of the not-yet but to what he imagined were higher and better ways of existing in harmony with themselves, their environments, and each other. The mythic staging of what sounds like a cry of perplexed and defeated rage against the violence of a pogrom elevates a deliberately obscure reading of America’s domestic conflicts to global significance. A space boat lands with eerie grace to take away the bodies of the dead, and thus the message to love becomes a message to the universe. A planetary vision supplied Jimi’s global mind-set with a suitably futuristic vehicle for its existential critique. This was not a routine result of a new age, occult impulse. These were properly historical moods, tied to a new iconic immediacy of the planet, that had been captured for the first time from outside earth’s orbit by cameras on the Apollo spacecraft in 1968. This is a planetary rather than a cosmic consciousness, and it seems also to have been derived straightforwardly from Jimi’s repudiation of the belligerent geopolitical mission that young men like himself were then routinely being given by Uncle Sam. It’s worth repeating that Hendrix joined and then left that army. He acquired a subtle antipathy toward the military mentality that was inverted and reworked as the target of all his hopes for a better world. His journey toward peace was all the more convincing because the conversion was gradual and because along the way he had discovered the pleasures of jumping out of airborne war machines and falling through the sky. Perhaps that ontological shaking and sustained proximity to death nudged him into a mythic language that not only fostered an update in the poetics of world citizenship but invited us to imagine taming the U.S. military industrial complex in the subversive act of traveling by dragonfly rather than warplane or helicopter. The myths are part of this worldliness, too. They are broader and brighter-hued than the safer, unconvincing cosmography of the worn-out christianities they aimed first to undo and then to supplant. It was Hendrix’s exit velocity from the military that enabled him to borrow those arrows of desire from William Blake’s Muggletonian quiver\n\n30\n\nPAUL GILROY\n\nand bravely put them to work opposing both colonial war and moribund politics. His unpatriotic decision to choose peace and espouse nonviolence was offset by the tense and difficult relationship he enjoyed with Michael Jeffrey, the mysterious and ruthless Geordie manager who sometimes boasted of his own military activities in the murkiest depths of the colonial warfare to which Britain’s secret state had committed the ailing, no longer imperial country. Jeffrey could speak Russian, had been stationed in Egypt during the Suez crisis of 1956, and does seem to have worked for British Intelligence in some capacity.3 While bravely opposing the war in Indochina, Hendrix managed to confound and disappoint anybody who wanted him to adopt conventional or facile political views and to enrage anyone who found his elliptical, mythic pronouncements on ethics, history, and governmentality too much to stomach. What we identify as environmentalist or green themes in his work should be acknowledged here as an additional measure of the global scale of his anxieties about the fate of humankind. The prospect of the larger tragedy involved in species death looms over his explorations of the contingency, tragedy, and brevity of fragile human life. His repeated references to Native Americans are part of this countercosmology, but it remains a mood rather than a program and is all the more powerful for that. There is only a Cherokee mist, the lingering trace of an indigenous, non-European sensibility, veiled in musical fog, swirling wordlessly with a spiritual energy drawn from the dopplered, harmonically unstable notes that are flying out from the spinning speaker of the Leslie cabinet. That trail of tears, the suffering in that genocide, and the tragedy of reservation containment must all stay wordless if they are to retain their power to inspire, humble, and shame. In the bared teeth of this unspeakable history, words come too cheaply. Jimi’s transethnic turn is neither a willful drift away from blackness into exoticism nor a belated programmatic bid to set history straight by invoking some interplanetary Seminole genealogy. The tragic outcome—the castle made of sand— refers us to the enduring presence of alternative possibilities. Another world is possible. Jimi conjures up the prospect of it—a castle in the air— and says that the resources for building that utopia are, unexpectedly and magically, already at hand.4 To forget America’s internal tragedies and the genocide of its conquest and expansion would be to deny the uniqueness of its hybrid identity and, in so doing, to sustain the passivity and renunciation that corrupt and inauthentic power now relies on. Opposing the alienated submissiveness that has been engineered from above requires recognizing the catastrophe of American progress. That acceptance in turn becomes part of acquiring the machinery of liberation. The pursuit of an alternative future requires the cultivation of countermemory,\n\nBOLD AS LOVE?\n\n31\n\nand even time, as Herbert Marcuse put it, “loses its power when remembrance redeems the past.”5\n\nThe significance of Hendrix’s many creative transgressions has been multiplied not only by the brevity of his life, but also by a sense of its radical incompleteness. This has encouraged critics to project images of him burdened and trapped by their own preoccupations. Rather than place Hendrix inside somebody else’s dubious fantasy of what his music ought to have been, it seems to make more sense to treat his own mythic projections of his work more seriously, to reconstruct them in their historical setting and see whether, like his calculated refusals of shallow and trivial political language, they might help to explain why his music would not die along with him. Accordingly, I have tried to take both Jimi’s appetite for utopian and mythic themes and his tacit politics more seriously than is now conventional. His strange immortality has made his media afterimage unusually plastic and mutable. It may be better to accept that final evaluations of his boldness are impossible and to argue that understanding his music and its enduring popularity involves a number of historical and cultural puzzles. The art’s life after Jimi’s death is more than a narrowly aesthetic matter. It raises a number of delicate interpretative problems that have the power to detonate all oversimple models of African American culture and identity and redirects us to a number of neglected issues. Among the more important are the history and phenomenology of the electric guitar, a consideration of the pivotal point where music-making becomes a matter of sound, and the tale of how electronic innovations derived from military research found new peaceful uses in sound-processing technology. We are obliged to answer a host of difficult questions about the cold war’s cultural dimensions, about the combined and uneven development of racialized and globalized markets for popular cultural products, and about the unanticipated commercial value of what we can call video immortality. Before we can even pose questions of that order, we are also required to ask what version of black cultural history his gypsy life might be used to construct. The repeated affirmation of itinerancy cannot be erased. Jimi’s poetry of transience presents life as a journey without an arrival. His romanticism is betrayed by the projection of a self that is “essentially a traveler—a questing, homeless self whose standards derive from, [and] whose citizenship is of, a place that does not exist at all or yet, or no longer exists; one consciously understood as an ideal, opposed to something real . . . the journey is unending and the destination, therefore, negotiable.”6 We need to understand where existing frameworks, which\n\n32\n\nPAUL GILROY\n\ndefer too readily to the boundaries of national states or are inclined to respect the disciplinary authority of those who claim to know the proper course of culture, might have to be amended in order to make sense of the fluctuations and detours that have surrounded and nurtured this itinerant art. We need also to grasp how Hendrix’s music has not only retained its special power but grown in stature, acquiring a new significance that lets it speak to several quite different generations of listeners, especially the more recent and remote audiences for whom the blues is not a primary point of musical reference. They have found their way to Hendrix nonetheless, because of the way that his musical imagination saturates the scene even as the electric guitar moves out of the central position he won for it. Blues is not usually thought of as a modernist form. Its electrification has not been very well understood, appearing more usually as a linear development of unyielding traditions that are predictable and knowable. The standard script runs like this: Blasted out from the plantations where it had been formed, the blues was dispatched northward into the accelerated, vertiginous, and abject modernity of America’s segregated cities. That degrading urban environment had been memorably explored by Richard Wright alongside Edwin Rosskam’s selection of photographs in their historic 1941 collaboration Twelve Million Black Voices, published just before Jimi was born. Wright, an autodidact, philosopher-sociologist, and renegade postal worker as well as a writer of fiction, was the first African American chronicler of this new metropolitan tragedy to reach for the concept of modernity in order to make sense of what he was seeing around him in the iconic kitchenettes and alleys of Chicago’s South Side. That racialized geography, where Jimi was only ever a visitor, provided a crucible in which adaptations of the form would be forged. There the custodianship of black culture was reinvested in the newly arrived urban populations that never quite managed to stand in for their rural antecedents. While other aspects of black vernacular existence were in a terrible flux, the blues was somehow able to resist the turbulence. Critical orthodoxy says that from that historic point, the form itself did not really change. Perhaps its development had been arrested by the extreme shock of this racially stratified hypermodernity. Certainly just a few years after Hendrix’s death and scratching at a Stratocaster to complete the detour that “Red House” had begun, the cryptically postmodern blues of Albert King could announce the absolute invariance of the music while slyly celebrating the very mutability that his words denied.7 Answering the conservative inclinations of the orthodox voices that prize sedentary culture above the itinerant and feral forms with which it is often in conflict, this counterhistory of black identities and identifications says that Jimi came\n\nBOLD AS LOVE?\n\n33\n\nalong and changed the game. His intervention showed where tradition was not a simple repetition but a reflexive practice of custom that inclined toward the liberationist possibilities of the not-yet by valorizing a combination of “flexibility in substance and formal adherence to precedent.”8 Wright’s account of Chicago life associated modernity with cultural and existential complexity and saw how the experiential discrepancy visible along America’s racial fault line had to be made intelligible, not in the pattern of W. E. B. Du Bois’s “double consciousness,” which had been absorbed too easily, but as a temporal disjunction. This is how he put it: “More than even that of the American Indian, the consciousness of vast sections of our black women lies beyond the boundaries of the modern world, though they live and work in that world daily.”9 His acute and thoughtful analysis of this lack of synchronicity offered two other telling comments on the black world that was coming into being inside the ghetto walls."
