        "text": "Subhumans Live In A Dive ( Fat Wreck Chords) Rating: NNNN\n\nRating: NNNN\n\nTo many, Subhumans will always be memorable for the angular DIY glory of their logo. For those who doubt it, this album is ample proof that they deserve iconic status for more than that. Like the best of the genre, the Subhumans sound thrives in the live recording. Recording in 2003 as the fifth instalment in Fat Wreck Chords Live In A Dive series, Subhumans slice through 26 of their flintiest and most insightful songs, spitting articulate venom at the usual suspects. For rebels who first pierced ears in the early 80s, the Subhumansâ€™ numbers still sound dead timely, their critiques marvellously on target. In this, and for a musicality that perfectly evokes the agitation and tension of the message, they put the latest crop of punk pretenders to shame."
