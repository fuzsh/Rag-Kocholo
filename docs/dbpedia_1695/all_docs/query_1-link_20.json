        "text": "If you missed the chance to see The Enigmas live in the 1980�s, or better yet - were there but didn�t yet have the technology to capture the epic, bombastic energy of this phenomenal band� here is the answer you�ve been waiting for�\n\nThis DVD is a great snapshot of the reunion of this amazing band, filmed one night live in Vancouver in 2010. The disc has 19 songs including encores. It�s a tour through the band�s original catalogue mixed with high-octane covers by bands like The Damned, MC5, and The Stooges. A couple great highlights are the more obscure covers - �7 And 7 Is� by Arthur Lee, and �Talk Talk� by Music Machine - that have the kind of spin that only this band could give a song.\n\nThe Enigmas originally came out in the early 80�s in Vancouver and took their legendary live shows up and down the West Coast for several years before splitting off into many other seminal Vancouver acts. They left behind two records and a number of songs on compilation albums in their wake. The band�s music is a unique fusion of garage rock, surf music, and 60�s psychedelia all mixed with the raw punk energy coming out of Detroit in the 70�s. The feel is definitely sweaty garage punk; but with The Enigmas, you know you�re watching a band that can play anything. Their songs are fast and furious punk anthems; but the great vocal melodies and harmonies, the intricate guitar and bass lines, and virtuoso drumming all take The Enigmas music to another level. Watching this band live is an adrenaline rush. They start off with a couple mid-tempo songs to let you finish your drinks and get on the dance floor, and quickly explode into one writhing, sweat-drenched classic after another. If you missed them the first time around, this might be the only chance to catch a piece of West Coast musical history and legend. �VideoActive: Enigmas Live in Concert� is available at local music shops in Vancouver including Zulu, Scratch, Neptoon, RedCat, and Bonerattle.\n\nFor Media and Blogger Inquiries, go to: enigmas@moonrakerweb.com\n\nAnd: Facebook.com/TheEnigmasBand"
