Stunning under the name N.F.G. back in late 1978/early 1979 playing mostly cover tunes. They opened shows for local music heroes the Demics. Soon they were writing and recording their own material. With bar owners hesitant to book them because of the connotations of their name they changed it to ’63 Monroe in 1980. They toured the SOuthern Ontario bar scene throughout the ’80s and regularly played Toronto. They even managed to finagle their way onto a bill at the infamous CBGB’s in New York City opening for the Dead Boys’ late drummer Johnny Blitz and his band. After a decade of recording, touring and releasing records with little more than underground notoriety (and the advent of Grunge), the band called it a day; The band members would spend the next decade in musical projects and career paths. In 2002 they reformed for a headlining ‘one off’ reunion show at London’s Call the Office and sold-out two nights back-to-back. Old grievances were long forgotten and the band began writing new material. The result was ‘Last Exit To Rawk N Roll’ released in the spring of 2007 on London’s Speed City Records. with notes from Steve R.

Carlo’s band had fallen apart and he would recruit Reid, Armstrong and Mills to become the new Razor. Several albums and tours followed but Carlo struggled to keep his band afloat in the early 1990s, members Reid, Armstrong and Mills quit Razor to re-form Samhain under the new metal-friendly moniker S.F.H. [aka Sam Fucking Haim] with guitarist Danny Mayhem. Mills quit shortly thereafter and they recruited Rich Oosterbach on drums. In 1992 S.F.H. would record the ‘One of These Days’ album at Harry Hess’ (Harem Scarem) Cabin Fever studio in Newcastle, Ontario which was produced by Dave Carlo. They returned to Cabin Fever to record their sophomore release ‘All You Can Eat’ in 1994. By 1996 Carlo and the band had patched up their differences, Mayhem was let go and they became the new version of Razor.

SNFU paid its dues in halls and basement clubs in Edmonton before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia. Aside from a two-year break in the early ’90s (when punk’s third wave arrived) the band is considered “Canada’s reigning Princes of punk.” Their longest consistent line-up (1992-1998) recorded four albums and performed over 800 shows together. Chi Pig rarely grants interviews and one “chat” with The Toronto Sun several years ago consisted of two words – one being ‘no’ and the other was unprintable; A new live “Greatest Hits” album, ‘Let’s Get It Right The First Time’, was released in 1998. Vancouver author Chris Walter released the definitive biography on S.N.F.U. entitled ‘SNFU: What No One Else Wanted To Say’; Ken Chinn passed away July 16, 2020; Jon Card died April 8, 2024 with notes from Brent Belke.\n\nSingles\n\n1987 She’s Not On the Menu//Life of a Bag Lady/This Is The End (independent)\n\n1990 Real Men Don’t Watch Quincy [5-song EP] (independent)\n\n1993 Beautiful, Unlike You And I/The Watering Hole (Different Version) (Hom Wreckerds Music) HWM-1001\n\n1995 Eric’s Had A Bad Day (Not Profane Version)/Eric’s Had A Bad Day (Profane Version) (Epitaph) 86441S2-2\n\n2017 A Happy Number/Human Cattle (Rake) RR-006\n\nAlbums\n\n1985 …And No One Else Wanted To Play (B.Y.O./B.Y.C.)

Their fourth studio album, ‘Apocalypse Inside’, was released by Metal Blade Records in 1993 before the band split up in early 1994 after the album tour. Following a reunion show in 2006, they returned to the studio and the result was the album ‘The Ones I Condemn’ through Sonic Unyon Records (for CD) and War On Music (for vinyl). War On Music would also issue the 2LP vinyl collection ‘198666’ in 2011. Currently the band is working with Cursed Blessings Records in Toronto. The label issued the new studio single “World War V” in 2021 in anticipation of another full album in 2023.

With Sean Dean (bass) and Andrew Scott (drums) the band released a home-made cassette. Following encouragement from their live appearances, they set about recording their debut album ‘Precious Moments’ for Chicago, Illinois record label Bloodshot Records. The band repeated the gesture for ‘Pure Diamond Gold’ (1999) and ‘Tremendous Efforts’ (2001). Their reputation as a live band gained them record industry friends in artists like Blue Rodeo, The Tragically Hip and Neko Case – who would often use them as her solo backing band. The Sadies also recorded a country album with singer Andre Williams in 1999 entitled ‘Red Dirt’. The Sadies’ flexibility as both an alt-country act and ex-rock musicians allowed them do be backing band for Jon Spencer’s Heavy Trash project. The group began receiving notoriety on both sides of the border by 2002 and released ‘Stories Often Told’ (2002) and ‘Favourite Colours’ (2004) with Outside Music in Canada while ‘Tales of the Rat Fink’ (2006) and ‘In Concert Volume One’ (2006) were picked up by US indie label Yep Roc.

Saga song-writers Michael Sadler and Jim Crichton used to write songs at Crichton’s house between Sadler’s shifts as a Toronto cab driver. Their very first live performance took place on June 13, 1977 at a club about sixty miles from Toronto. Although most other bands at the time were performing cover tunes exclusively, Saga decided from the beginning to stick to their convictions and play only their own music. Shortly thereafter they landed their first recording contract with Polydor Records. June 1978 saw the self-titled debut album released in Canada and then something interesting happened: one of the Toronto record stores noticed that German record importers were showing an unusually intense interest in the album; within a few weeks the album sold about 30,000 copies in Germany as an import. Polygram Records in Europe quickly jumped on the bandwagon and signed the group to a multiple territory contract. Three increasingly successful albums followed, with Germany establishing itself as the band’s number one market. Through constant touring in Canada and Europe they earned a reputation for being a strong and exciting live band, and garnered a Juno in 1981 for Most Promising Band, but American success continued to elude them until the release of the Rupert Hine-produced album Worlds Apart in 1982; the record made it into Billboard’s Top20 and had two Top40 singles, including “On The Loose”, and went on to receive gold and platinum awards in Canada, the US and most European territories. Such was the extent of the touring to promote Worlds Apart that the next release for the band was a live album entitled In Transit, which became an even bigger hit for the band worldwide. Rupert Hine was brought in to produce the follow-up studio album, entitled ‘Heads Or Tales’. The album enjoyed reasonable success although sales in Europe and Canada were still very strong. 1986 saw some fundamental changes in Saga’s lineup and activities. Jim Gilmour and Steve Negus decided to leave the band to pursue other musical interests so the remaining band members decided to stay together as the nucleus of Saga and bring in other musicians to record and tour as they needed them. Sadler was living in London, Jim Crichton spent time in England and the Bahamas before settling in Los Angeles, and Ian Crichton remained in Toronto. The deal with Polydor in Europe had run its course so they signed a new deal with the Bonaire label, which had just received distribution in Europe through BMG. Although re-releasing all the albums on CD, the first true Bonaire album was ‘Wildest Dreams’ (1987), produced by Keith Olsen (Fleetwood Mac, Foreigner, David Coverdale, and the Scorpions. Although selling well throughout most of Europe, the album failed to make any inroads in North America, and this scenario was repeated with the 1989 self-produced LP ‘The Beginner’s Guide To Throwing Shapes’. Negus and Gilmour returned to the fold in 1991 and Saga enjoyed a rebirth of sorts. April 1993 saw the release of the tenth Saga studio album, ‘The Security of Illusion’, which was warmly received by fans and critics alike. In 1993 the band was also contracted to write and record the featured music including the theme song for the Stephen J. Cannell Productions television show “Cobra”, which aired that fall. Some of This material ended up on the 1994 album Steel Umbrellas. Making a decision to take part in the multimedia revolution of the mid 1990’s, the band released their Generation 13 album in 1995, which was closely followed by a multimedia compact disc entitled Softworks. 1997 saw one more Bonaire release with ‘Pleasure and The Pain’, and the band then signed with another label, SPV, for 1998’s DeTours album. All of the mid to late 90’s releases enjoyed considerable success in Germany and certain European markets; Gilmour and Negus temporarily left the band in 1986 and released the Virgin Records album ‘GNP’ (Gilmour-Negus Project) in 1989 which featured Robbie Bevan (aka Robbie Rae) on lead vocals and Jeff Jones (Red Rider) on bass. Gilmour also released an album of instrumental music. Ian Crichton released both band material (as H30) and solo material, and 1998 saw the release of a Michael Sadler solo album ‘Clear’. In March 2000, another compilation, the 15-track ‘Defining Moments (Volume One)’, was released in North America. Recordings from their 1998 tour was released on the the double-live album ‘Detours’. The band continued a non-stop schedule of new studio albums to usher in the new millennium for their European fans – ‘Full Circle’ (1999), ‘House of Cards’ (2001) (featuring the Top5 video single “Money Talks”), and ‘Marathon’ (2003), and ‘Network’ (2004). In 2005 Steve Negus quit the band. New drummer, Brian Doerner (Helix, Ray Lyell), joined in time to appear on their next album ‘Trust’ (2006). In January 2007 Michael Sadler would be leaving Saga for personal reasons at the end of their 30th Anniversary tour. The band decided to record one more album with Sadler in Los Angeles. In October Brian Doerner suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by Chris Sutherland on drums until Doerner recovered. The album ‘10,000 Days’ was released in November 2007 in conjunction with a final European tour. The band’s final show with Sadler was December 9, 2007. After extensive auditions, Saga announced in April 2008 that Toronto, Ontario native Rob Moratti of the band Final Frontier, would be the band’s new singer. The band recorded a new album called ‘The Human Condition’ with Moratti which was released in the spring of 2009. Saga immediately launched a tour with the new vocalist in Canada and Europe. In January 2011 Michael Sadler returned to the band and another round of European tour dates commenced. However, personnel availability became an issue and three of the four replacement musicians during the tour were recruited from a German Saga cover band known as The Chapters. Andreas Gundlach, replaced Jim Gilmour initially. He played the first two show with the band, then Hans-Willi Carl and Thomas Eisenbruch from The Chapters took over. With the departure of Brian Doerner from Saga in February 2012 The Chapters drummer Stefan Peschgens was used. With the band’s return to North America to release the album ’20/20′ that summer, Saga did YouTube auditions for a new drummer and hired Toronto, Ontario’s Mike Thorne. with notes from Steve Negus and Ursula Lott.\n\nSingles\n\n1979 How Long/Humble Stance (Polydor) 2065-397\n\n1979 Slow Motion/Careful Where You Step (Polydor – GERMANY) 2095-236\n\n1979 It’s Time (Chapter Three)/Take It Or Leave It (Polydor) 2065-419\n\n1980 Careful Where You Step/Compromise (Polydor – NETHERLANDS) 2040-292\n\n1980 Compromise/What’s It Gonna Be?

By 1962 she was touring as a solo act and perfecting her muse. She performed in concert halls, folk festivals and at Native American reservations through North America and abroad. She took time out to attend the University of Massachusetts Amherst earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963 for Teaching and Oriental Philosophy. She drifted back to Canada and spent time in coffeehouses in Toronto’s Yorkville Village as well as New York City’s Greenwich Village with such artists as Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and Neil Young. In 1964 she returned to the Piapot Cree reserve in Canada for a Powwow and was adopted by the youngest son of Chief Piapot, Imu Piapot and his wife. By this time her self-penned original songs were coming to the attention of others and being covered by her contemporaries. Also in 1964 she was signed to Vanguard Records where her debut album, ‘It’s My Way’ featuring the song “Universal Soldier” (later becoming a hit for British singer Donovan). Sainte-Marie was named Billboard Magazine’s ‘Best New Artist’. She released the album ‘Many a Mile’ (1965) and appeared on Pete Seeger’s ‘Rainbow Quest’ TV special as well as several Canadian television shows. She released ‘Little Wheel Spin’ in 1966 and appeared as a guest on American television game show ‘To Tell the Truth’ as herself. In 1967, Sainte-Marie released the album ‘Fire and Fleet and Candlelight’ and made major promotional appearances on television shows such as ‘American Bandstand’, ‘Soul Train’, ‘The Johnny Cash Show’ and Johnny Carson’s ‘The Tonight Show’. In 1969, Sainte-Marie released the experimental synth album ‘Illuminations’ which received luke warm reviews. She sang Joni Mitchell’s “The Circle Game” in Stuart Hagmann’s 1970 film ‘The Strawberry Statement’. In 1972 she managed a US Top40 hit with her single “Mister Can’t You See”. In late 1975, Sainte Marie appeared on the award winning TV show ‘Sesame Street’ and used the opportunity to teach young viewers about native culture. She would make return visits to the show over the next 5 years (1976-1981) including an episode filmed on-location from her home in Hawaii where the entire cast visited her. In 1979 the docudrama ‘Spirit of the Wind’, featuring Sainte-Marie original music score, was an entry at the Cannes Film Festival. The song “Up Where We Belong” which was co-written with Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche was performed by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes in the Hollywood blockbuster ‘An Officer and a Gentleman’ won an Academy Award for ‘Best Song’ in 1982. The song would go on to win a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Film Award for ‘Best Original Song’. During the same time period one of her native songs was used as the theme song for the CBC’s native series ‘Spirit Bay’. In 1989 she wrote and performed the music for ‘Where the Spirit Lives’ dealing with Canada’s residential schools scandal. Sainte-Marie voiced the Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie ‘Son of the Morning Star’. Following a 16 year break from recording Sainte-Marie released the album ‘Coincidence and Likely Stories’ in 1992. The album was recorded in 1990 at her home in Hawaii on an Apple II computer and the songs transmitted through an early modem version of Internet to UK producer Chris Birkett. Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the Pierce Brosnan television film ‘The Broken Chain’ shot in Virginia, USA. She also appeared in the opening musical ceremonies for the Bahá’í World Congress which featured two concerts under the title ‘Live Unity: The Sound of the World’ as both a television broadcast and video documentary. Her next album was 1996’s ‘Up Where We Belong’ which featured re-recordings of many of her songwriting hits. The album was the basis for a CBC variety special of the same name (she later won a Gemini Award for it). That same year she received an honorary Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa degree from the Universityof Regina, Saskatchewan. In 2000, Sainte-Marie gave the commencement address at Haskell Indian Nations University. The following year, she sang at the Kennedy Space Center for Commander John Herrington, a Chickasaw and the first Native American astronaut. In 2003 she was made a spokesperson for the UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network in Canada.In 2004, Sainte-Marie’s previously recorded original song “Lazarus” was sampled by producer Kanye West for the Cam’Ron and Jim Jones song “Dead or Alive”. In June 2007, she made a rare US live appearance at the Clearwater Festival in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

They would release their debut CD ‘So Very Happy’ in 1994 on Howe’s own Ghetto Records. The band garnered some national interest on college radio which led to a second disc in 1995 entitled ‘Nude Photos Inside’ on which allowed Ghetto Records to be distributed nationally by WEA. The band was getting misnamed Salzbergland, and decided to change their name once more – this time to Artificial Joy Club. They released their hard-edged grunge CD ‘Melt’ in Canada independently.

The Vancouver band became a staple on the Canadian scene, touring with Our Lady Peace, Pure and Soundgarden among others. Their song “Stain” appeared in the ‘Due South’ Television show episode ‘An Eye For An Eye’ in 1995. In 1996, the band added a fourth member and became Namedropper – a hip-hop/drum & bass/jazz act, which still performs regularly. Before officially burying Salvador Dream they released a 3-song EP entitled ‘Big Brother’ in 1997 on Turtle Records. Following Namedropper’s only release in 2000, Klyne, Peter and Garraway would go on to tour and record with Canadian hip-hop artist k-os.\n\nAlbums\n\n1993 Salvador Dream [5-song cassette] (Bafflebeat)\n\n1994 UR (WEA) CD-96919\n\n1997 Big Brother [3-song EP] (Turtle)\n\nas NAMEDROPPER\n\n2000 Namedropper [4-song EP]\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1995 “One Way Ticket” on ‘Page One’ (Page) PP-005\n\nSALVATION FRONT\n\nMichael Dykeman (bass, backing vocals) / Patrice Pelletier (drums) / Troy McLaggen (lead guitar) / Michael Dunn (rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, lead guitar) / Gordon Sheffroth (vocals)\n\nAlbums\n\n1995 Salvation Front [4-song s/sided cassette EP] (Salvation Front)\n\n1996 Trying To Stay Real (Magada) MAGCD-43\n\nSAMPSON, Gordie\n\nBorn: Gordon Francis Sampson on July 30, 1971 in Big Pond, Nova Scotia\n\nFormer member of the band Realworld, Gordie Sampson is an award-winning singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer.

Sandbox’s second album, ‘A Murder in the Glee Club’, was produced by Steve Albini (Nirvana) but slipped under the radar before the band split up. They were nominated for an East Coast Music Award in 1996 and a CASBY Award (CFNY); Mike Smith would go on to fame and fortune as a co-star in the hit TV show ‘Trailer Park Boys’ as the lovable rogue “Bubbles”. Smith performed as part of Bubbles & the Shit Rockers featuring Alex Lifeson (Rush) and Tom Wilson (Blackie & The Rodeo Kings) for the original song “Liquor & Whores” featured on ‘Trailer Park Boys: The Movie Soundtrack’.

The began as Ken and the Continentals before frontman Ken Williams decided to step back from the performance side and become the band’s manager and was replaced by Michael Goettler on bass & vocals. Williams renamed them The Sands Of Time. Eventually Elvins was replaced by Vern Martin and the band’s sound started to lean more toward a R & B blend with the British Invasion style. Not long after, O’Hara, Martin and Dennis Baragar would be replaced by Smith and Conley and the definitive line-up was born. They performed at Expo ’67 and were recognized for being the youngest act to ever tour the east coast. By 1969 they toured the west coast and even swung back through Toronto to play the Canadian National Exhibition. They released one single, “I’ve Got A Feeling”, in 1970 which charted at No.2. The Sands Of Time eventually moved to Toronto. In 1971 they recorded their first album in Toronto and Montreal for the U.S. National General Records label. Although a producer was called in from Los Angeles, his poor health in the cold Canadian winter forced him to return prematurely. The band was left to produce the album on their own while their Canadian label, MTCC, ran into financial difficulties and the album was never released. The Sands of Time left Toronto and returned home to Belleville without Dave Conley and developed into a 4-piece progressive “country rock” act. Eric Baragar briefly entertained a solo career but was a postal worker by day; Goettler, Baragar and Campbell ran a music retail store called Centre Stage Music; and Steve Smith was a social worker. Smith and Campbell would put their own band together called Boojum while Eric Baragar and Mike Goettler put together the short-lived, Sands Of Time II, with Trevor Burt (guitar,vocals), Doug Leal (drums) and Brent Bailey (keyboards). This line up only lasted a few months together. In 1977, Baragar built a basement studio that grew into a project studio. Most of the original members of the Sands Of Time returned to Belleville and reformed with musician-turned-lawyer Dan Thompson (Boojum, Noah) in 1978 for some Belleville-area gigs. The new version of the band re-christened itself Bentwood Rocker and released several records in the ’80’s. Another name change to The Press failed to add any further notoriety, but in 1986 they revived the name The Sands Of Time and released the single “Danger Of Remembering” on B & C Records. Currently the band, as Bentwood Rocker, still performs in the Belleville area; Ted Elvins died August 23, 2022. with notes from Eric Baragar, Michael Goettler, and Steve Sawyer.

Rick Lazaroff responded and was asked to join them under their new name: SANTERS. Rick Santers wrote the material for the band’s debut album while on a winter tour in Québec. The band rehearsed the new songs by day and played gigs at night. During a one week period the band recorded the album ‘Shot Down In Flames’ later that year. In 1981 the song “Time After Time” won the Toronto Q107 Homegrown talent contest with the song biing placed on the station’s compilation album. Interest grew for Santers product and ‘Shot Down In Flames’ was released in Canada on Ready Records, and licensed in France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. The reaction was immediate and the album sailed up the import charts in England, Germany and Sweden. The album’s first single and promotional video for “You Turn Me On” was r eleased giving the band radio and television exposure enough to warrant t ouring across Canada and the US. In 1982 the band returned to the studio to record new material the result of which was the ‘Mayday’ EP featuring their next single “Mistreatin’ He art”. Santers soon joined Ozzy Osbourne’s ‘Diary Of A Madman’ tour. Santers returned to the studio, yet again, that year to complete their so phomore album ‘Racing Time’ with Rick Santers and Jack Richardson (Guess Who) co-producing. Distribution is expanded for this release to include Australia, England, Germany and Sweden. Another tour commenced in support of the next single “Winter Freeze”. Rad io support for ‘Racing Time’ expanded into the Mid-Western United States and as far south as Texas. While the fire was hot the band then took adva ntage of increased interest in England by teaming up with the band Magnum for a British tour. Santers returned home in 1983 to perform with Johnny Winter and Golden Ea rring at Toronto’s Massey Hall. Gigs like these became more frequent as S ANTERS would do larger venues including a charity fundraiser at Maple Lea f Gardens. Also that year Rick Santers had the opportunity to jam with guitarist Rik Emmett and Rick Derringer on the song “Rock And Roll Hoochie Koo” at a Triumph birthday bash. Rik Emmett was invited to produce Santers’ third studio album ‘Guitar All ey’ in 1984 which was released in Canada, USA, Japan, Sweden and Australi a and boasted the band’s greatest radio successes: a remake of the Free s ong “All Right Now” which went Top-40 across Canada and the second single “Can’t Shake You” which managed video rotation on the newly designated M TV and MuchMusic video stations. Through 1985 Santers toured vigorously to support ‘Guitar Alley’ througho ut Canada and the USA with such acts as Blue Oyster Cult, Ratt, and Accept. By 1986 Rick Santers was well on his way to writing material for the band’s fourth album, ‘Top Secrecy’, when he was asked to formally become a to uring member of Triumph as their second guitarist, additional vocalist an d keyboardist. Santers, the band, was suspended as a touring/recording entity and Rick Santers had several of his songs placed on Triumph’s ‘Sport Of Kings’ and ‘Surveillance’ albums. In 1993 S Santers released ‘1st Shot’ and ‘2nd Shot’ – a two album compila tion on CD – in Germany. Through 1995 and 1996 Rick Santers branched out as a solo artist to write and record his debut album ‘Revitalize’ on his own label, Dandelion. 1998 saw the band make a conscious effort to finish the long abandoned ‘Top Secrecy’ album sessions from 1986. The finished album was included in a boxed set package called ‘Santers IV’ which was released in Japan. ‘Top Secrecy’ was finally released as a single CD album in Europe in 1999. With the revived interest in the band overseas plans are made to begin re cording another Santers studio album starting in 2000. A ‘best of’ packag e is assembled for the North American market called ‘Cold Fusion’ which c ontains the best material from the four studio albums plus two previously unreleased tracks. Initially released independently on Dandelion Records, the CD was picked up for distribution in 2002 by Bullseye Records. with notes from Rick Santers and Cam Atkinson.\n\nSingles\n\n1981 You Turn Me On/The Rapper (Ready) SR-141\n\n1982 Mistreatin’ Heart/Still I Am (Ready) SR-231\n\n1982 Winter Freeze/Dog Without A Home (Ready) SR-281\n\n1983 Two Against The World/Road to Morocco (Ready) SR-282\n\n1984 All Right Now/Too Young To Die (Ready) SR-421\n\n1984 Can’t Shake You/High Rish (Ready) SR-422\n\nAlbums\n\n1981 Shot Down In Flames (Ready) LR-014\n\n1982 Mayday [4 song EP] (Ready) ER-023\n\n1982 Racing Time (Ready) LR-028\n\n1984 Guitar Alley (Ready) LR-042\n\n1993 1st Shot (Long Island – Germany)\n\n1993 2nd Shot (Long Island – Germany)\n\n1998 Santers IV (Bareknuckle – Japan) AVCB66049/52\n\n1999 Top Secrecy (Dandelion)\n\n2000 Cold Fusion (Dandelion) DSD-10010\n\nas RICK SANTERS\n\n1996 ReViTaLiZe (Dandelion) DSD-19604\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1981 “Time After Time” on ‘Q107 Homegrown Vol. 3’ (Basement/Attic) BASE-6007\n\n1982 “Mistreatin’ Heart” on ‘Rocktober ‘82’ (Attic) ROCT-082\n\n1983 “Racing Time” on ‘Metal Battle’ (Road Runner – UK) NEAT-1014\n\n1984 “All Right Now” on ‘For The Record’ (Ready) EP-4-FREE\n\n1984 “All Right Now” on ‘Masters of Metal – Volume 2 (K-Tel) TC-297\n\n1985 “Can’t Shake You” on ‘Axe Masters: Legends of Rock Guitar’ (Attic) LAT-1214\n\n1985 “All Right Now” on ‘Heavy Metal Records Complication Album’ (Heavy Metal) HMC-5000\n\n2004 “Mistreatin’ Heart” on ‘When CanCon Rocked Vol. 1’ (Bullseye) BLP-CD-4015\n\n2005 “All Right Now” on ‘CD Plus Presents: Bullseye Records’ 20th Anniversary Archives Canadian Classic Rock Sampler’ (Bullseye) BLR-CD-2030\n\n2006 “You Turn Me On” on ‘The Best of Ready Volume1’ (Universal) 0249843785\n\n2006 “Can’t Shake You” on ‘The Best of Ready Volume 2’ (Universal) 0249843786\n\nSANTILLI, Ivana\n\nBorn: Ivana Daniela Santilli\n\nSantilli’s love of music began at age nine when she played trumpet for her father’s Italian wedding band in Toronto. While still in high school she joined Roger “MC Mystic” Mooking and Chin Injeti to form the soul/R & B/Rap trio Bass Is Base who shot to national stardom in 1994 and 1995. The unit broke up in 1998 and Santilli asked to be released from her contract with A & M Records. She hired herself out as a session musician playing keyboards and singing with acts such as Soul Attorneys, Women ah Run Tings, Punjabi by Nature, and Holly McNarland among others. Her debut solo album ‘Brown’ was released on her own Brown Recordings label in 1999. It featured a duet with Glenn Lewis entitled “If Ever I Fall.” The album led to a JUNO Award nomination in 2000 for ‘Best New Solo Artist.’ She performed three nights at the Montréal Jazz Festival and her performance was the subject of a one-hour Bravo! television special. Peer Music publishing signed her as a writer in the fall of 2000. In August 2004, she released her second solo album, ‘Corduroy Boogie, which featured the singles, “Deserve,” “Superstar,” and “What Matters.” Santilli collaborated with other artists including James Poyser, King Britt, Dwele, Dego (4Hero), Kaidi Tatham (Bugz In The Attic), Omar, and Stuart Matthewman (Sade, Maxwell, Sweetback). She then began doing keyboard remixes with Jazzanova, King Britt, Scuba, Vikter Duplaix, Steven Spacek, All Saints, Appleton (on the hit “Don’t Worry”), Rosey (Def Jam), Roy Ayers, and Larry Gold.

The band travelled to Winnipeg, Manitoba early in their career to recorded a demo tape at Arbuthnott Studios. They appeared on Winnipeg’s Chanel 7’s talent show “Hi Jinx,” placing second and were asked back to perform on a follow-up show. The performance gave them great exposure in the rock and roll town and a decision was made to book a dance in Winnipeg. They were approached by Fred Glazerman who offered to book the band and act as their manager. In short order, Satan & The D-Men appeared as part of Dick Clark’s “Cavalcade Of Stars”tour at the Winnipeg Auditorium as well as repeat performances in Portage La Prairie and Brandon, Manitoba. Other bands on the bill included Winnipeg acts The Jury, The Shondels, and The Deverons. Glazerman then moved the band to Winnipeg to make booking arrangements much easier. Satan & The D-Men were soon ranked in the top 10 out of over 150 bands in Winnipeg. Stage clothes were provided by Monarch Wear Of Canada and the band signed with Eagle Records. A recording of five original songs was done at CKRC radio. The songs “L-I-N-D-A” and “She’ll Lie” were released as a single in 1966. Shortly after a tour with Buddy Knox in 1966, Satan & The D-Men disbanded and the members pursued other interests. In 1982, Satan & The D-Men reformed to play for a dance in Kenora for the town’s Centennial. This resulted in the band playing many benefit dances there for the remainder of the next three decades. They opened for Burton Cummings in 2015 in Kenora, held their final dance in 2016 at Cabin Jack’s in Kenora, and held their final performance at an outdoor anniversary party in 2020 ; Cardinal went on to play with Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks (just prior to members of Crowbar departing from the line-up), The Bells, The Lisa Hartt Band and Ocean and now lives in Nanaimo, British Columbia playing occasional gigs and building PA systems; Faulconer went on to be in the Jarvis Street Revue; Terry Stiles would chronicle the band’s exploits in a book; Jones and Karwacki both passed away in 2016; Percy passed away in 2020.

The released an independent EP entitled 777 in 1992 before being signed to Graeme Boyce’s Raw Energy in 1994. They released the full length album ‘Eight Ate Hate’ that year but by 1995 the band had fallen apart; Baldwin went on to Dogs With Jobs; Good went on to form The Sadies with his brother Travis Good.\n\nAlbums\n\n1992 777 [6-song EP cassette] (independent)\n\n1994 Eight Ate Hate (Raw Energy/A & M) 242101\n\nSATTALITES, The\n\nFergus Hambleton (guitar, vocals, saxophone, keyboards) / Jo-Jo Bennett (vocals, flugel horn, percussion) / David Fowler (keyboards) / Bruce McGillivray (bass) / Junior McPherson (drums) / Rick Morrison (saxophone) / Bruce Robinson (vocals, piano) / Neil Chapman (guitar) / Bruce Mack / Neville Francis / Paul Bennett\n\nThe nucleus of Toronto’s Sattalites, former Axe Records president Fergus Hambleton (brother of Greg) and JoJo Bennett, met in 1980 when Hambleton worked at the recording sessions Bennett did when he came to Toronto from Jamaica. They formed an instant friendship and when Hambleton’s music school, the Sattalite School, lost some of its musician-teachers to previous commitments, Bennett stepped in to help Hambleton out. They would take some of their students to different nightclubs and get them up to play; this proved a successful way to find talented musicians, and two of the former students ended up joining the new band , the Sattalites, in 1982. Their independent, self-titled debut album was released in 1984, the beds for which were recorded during a trip Hambleton and Bennett made to Jamaica to do a benefit for Bennett’s alma mater, the Alpha Boys School. While there they looked up Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, two reggae heavyweights, who worked on the album with them. It received strong critical and public acceptance and earned the band both a CASBY and a JUNO Award. Constant touring and performing also gained them a reputation for being an exceptional live band. Over the next eight years the band independently released a live album and was then signed to Risque Disque/Warner. Two more albums followed to mixed critical reviews, but the band continued to draw sell-out crowds to their performances across the country. They also won the 1986 Canadian Reggae Music Award for ‘Group of the Year’ and ‘Top Horn Player’ (Hambleton); Hambleton has also released several solo records and teaches at Harris Institute. In 2013 the band released their greatest hits package ‘The Best of Canadian Reggae’ featuring 15 remastered tracks from 1984 to 2004; Jo-Jo Bennett passed away August 5, 2021; Determined to carry on after the loss of Bennett, The Sattalites resumed live performances as a 10-piece act in 2022. with notes from Chris Liota and Fergus Hambleton.

In March 1978 a 30 minute video called ‘Mystery Train’ was filmed. The mini-film was broadcast hundreds of times on Cable TV over the next 5 years. A trip back to the recording studio in October 1978 netted four more tracks that are not released. The Scenics also played at the legendary ‘Last Pogo’ show in December 1978 at the Horseshoe Tavern. This concert was the source of the ‘Last Pogo’ film. The band was featured in the movie and on the Bomb Records soundtrack in 1979. Bomb’s Wolfgang Spegg took a liking to the band as they represented a more artistic vision with their music than the punk acts he had signed to the label. Bomb released the band’s ‘Underneath the Door’ album in August 1980. Following the Bomb deal, the band released a self-financed 7″ single “Karen” b/w “See Me Smile” on its own Scenic Route Records in October 1981. For five years The Scenics got to play gigs with the Troggs, Viletones, Simply Saucer, the Government, Johnny and the G Rays, Telephone, (Parisian Punk band) and many others. On May 23,1982 The Scenics played the last show of their first incarnation at Toronto’s Cabana Room. Mark French would go on to briefly join Blue Rodeo, and Ken Fox played with Jason and the Scorchers. Ken Fox has also played with The Fleshtones since the late 1980s. In 2007 Badger and Meyers begin searching out ex-Scenics and associated people and to begin listening to their 200+ live, studio, & rehearsal recordings. Meyers also started writing a memoir of The Scenics and the original punk era called ‘Punk Haiku’. Live material from 1977-1981 was released on the CD ‘How Does it Feel to Be Loved: The Scenics Play the Velvet Underground’ through the band’s Dream Tower Records in January 2008 and in the UK in July 2008. It made the Top 30 national Canadian campus radio charts and received rave reviews, including making ‘Top 10 CDs of the Year’ lists in the Village Voice and the Detroit Metro Times. Québecois film-maker Chester ‘Chet’ Lebeaux produced a video for the song “Waiting for My Man”. The band reunited in April of 2008 to begin performing live shows for the first time in 26 years, including opening for Carla Bozulich at the Horseshoe Tavern and a showcase at NXNE where the conference’s film festival ended with a double bill of ‘The Last Pogo’ film and The Scenics’ “Waiting for My Man” video. ‘The Last Pogo’ film was finally released on DVD in October 2008 to celebrate the event’s 30th anniversary. It features performances by the Scenics, Viletones, Teenage Head, the Ugly, Cardboard Brains, Mods and The Secrets. It also includes seven unreleased Scenics performances from the 1978 ‘Mystery Train’ film. The band also played the ‘Last Pogo 30th Anniversary Show’ in December 2008. That same week, The Scenics entered Number 9 Studio in Toronto to begin their first studio recordings since 1981. In October 2009 the original studio recordings from 1977/1978 were remastered and released as the ‘Sunshine World’ CD. ‘Last Pogo’ film-maker Colin Brunton created a video for the song “Do the Wait”. The Scenics then reconvened for their third mini-tour of the new millennium, playing dates from London, Ontario to Montreal, Québec. Around this same time, Meyers began publishing his ‘Punk Haiku’ memoir in serial form on the band’s website. Each monthly chapter is accompanied by two songs from the cache of 300+ hours of rehearsal and live tape from the band’s archives. In the spring of 2010 British rock magazine ‘Uncut’ included The Scenics’ song “Do the Wait” on their ‘Search and Destroy’ proto-punk sampler CD. Later that year The Scenics released the songs from the first five chapters of ‘Punk Haiku’. The band decided to make these recordings and their two CDs available as free-by-donation downloads on their Dream Tower Records website. In September 2011 Andy Meyers, along with award-winning poet Brian Brett and vocalist Susheela Dawne, are awarded a Canada Council For the Arts grant to use samples and loops culled from the Scenics’ 1970’s tapes to create dub, mash-up backings for Brett’s poems and Dawne’s melodies. The album will be released in 2012. The Scenics went back into the studio in October 2011 and completed the 2008 studio recording. Their latest release is ‘Dead Man Walks Down Bayview. with notes from Andy Meyers.\n\nSingles\n\n1981 Karen/See Me Smile (Scenic Route) 827\n\nAlbums\n\n1980 Underneath the Door (Bomb) BOMB-113\n\n2007 How Does It Feel to Be Loved: The Scenics Play The Velvet Underground (Dream Tower) CD- DT01\n\n2009 Sunshine World (Dream Tower) CD-DT04\n\n2010 Punk Haiku 1: Proto-Spunk [DigiFile] (Dream Tower) DTPH1F\n\n2011 Punk Haiku 2: See Me Smile [DigiFile] (Dream Tower) DTPH2F\n\n2011 Punk Haiku 3: Face It Again [DigiFile] (Dream Tower) DTPH3F\n\n2012 Dead Man Walks Down Bayview (Dream Tower)\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1979 “In The Summer” and “Sunshine World” on ‘The Last Pogo’ (Bomb) BOMB-7029\n\n1981 “Karen” on ‘Bomb Catalogue 1’ (Bomb) CAT-81\n\n2008 “O Boy (Mystery Train version)” on ‘Mongrelzine – compilation’ (Mongrelzine) 1\n\n2010 “Do the Wait” on ‘Uncut: Search & Destroy’ (Uncut Magazine) 2010-05\n\nSCEPTRES, The (1)\n\nMarty Butler (keyboard, vocals; 1966 – 1969) / Roddy Elias (guitar vocals; 1969) / Ron Dykhof (keyboards, lead vocals; 1963 – 1966) / Tim Hewlings (guitar, organ, vocals;1959 – 1969) / William G.

The band regularly performed from Ontario to Newfoundland, and down the Eastern Coast of the United States. They recorded for five different Canadian record companies: Fi-Sound, RCA International, Allied, Alliance, and Polydor. The Sceptres had one # 1 English record in Eastern Canada called “I Never Had A Love Like That”, and two Top 30 singles with “Something’s Coming Along,” and “Juicy Morning.” Under their French name – “Les Sceptres” – they also had chart success in Quebec with “Moi, je pense toujours à toi” (I Never Had A Love Like That), b/w “Rien qu’une larme” (One Lonely Tear), and “Enfin seul ensemble” (I Think We’re Alone Now), b/w “Et maintenant” (What Now My Love). After numerous member changes, the band split up in 1969; Marty Butler would go on to a substantial solo career; Bill Ott would become an executive at A & M Polygram Records, and Oasis/SongCorp; Tim Hewling would become a sound engineer at Andre Perry’s studio Son Québec [aka The Church]; Roddy Elias was a session guitarist who worked with Guido Basso, Chelsea Bridge, and Billy Robinson among others; Ron Dykhof became the director of A & R for The Compo Company Ltd after leaving The Sceptres in 1966. He would continue in that role in the early 1970s when Compo was absorbed by MCA Records Canada. He also created his own label called Montor Records where he produced various records in 1971/1972 for acts such as Don Dunkin, Pops Merrily, Peaches, The Majority, Niven Miller, The Siebert Brothers, and Jersey Little Sweet. Eventually he set off around the world as a pianist for hire on cruise ships, and at hotels. Dykhof also released a handful of independent solo singles in the 1970s. [see MARTY BUTLER.

In his teens, Schenkman found his way into the thriving New York Music scene hooking up with a band called Trucking Company, which included John Popper and then Popper’s Princeton, New Jersey High School friend Chris Barron. Popper left Trucking Company to focus on his full-time music project Blues Traveler. Barron and Schenkman changed the name to Spin Doctors and added Aaron Comess (drums) and Mark White (bass) in the spring of 1989 to complete the roster. Epic/Sony Records A & R man Frankie LaRocka signed the band in 1990 and in January 1991 released the EP ‘Up for Grabs…Live’. Initial reaction was positive and so the band was sent into the studio to record the full-length album ‘Pocket Full of Kryptonite’ which was released in August 1991. The group’s loose and spontaneous jam-band live shows began gathering a grassroots fanbase despite the slow initial sales of the record. In summer 1992, the Spin Doctors were part of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival alongside Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, and Phish. Soon radio and MTV began playing the singles “Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong” and “Two Princes” pushing the album to Gold sales status by September 1992. The album received another sales boost following the band’s appearance on ‘Saturday Night Live’ in October that year. Three more singles/videos followed for “What Time Is It”, “How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?)”, and “Jimmy Olsen’s Blues”. By the following summer of 1993 the album had reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved triple Platinum sales. The record would eventually sell 10 million copies worldwide. The Spin Doctors then made an appearance on Sesame Street with a re-written version of “Two Princes”. Also in 1993, their version of Creedance Clearwater Revival’s “Have You Ever Seen the Rain?” appeared on the ‘Philadelphia’ movie soundtrack. Their version of Jimi Hendrix’s “Spanish Castle Magic” was included on a Hendrix tribute CD. The Spin Doctors’ sophomore album, ‘Turn It Upside Down’, was released in June 1994. The first single, “Cleopatra’s Cat”, barely scratched the Billboard Top100 singles chart and the second single, “Mary Jane”, was ignored by radio. However, the third single, “You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast” peaked at No.42 in the US and No.66 in the UK. Despite the commercial disappointment at radio, the album peaked at No.28 on the Billboard 200 and sold a modest 2 million copies worldwide. Meanwhile, the band was headlining a three-month world tour which was highlighted by appearances at Woodstock ’94 and the Glastonbury Festival. During a concert in Berkeley, California in September 1994, Schenkman walked off the stage and later announced he was leaving the band citing musical and personal differences, and road exhaustion. Schenkman has spent the intervening years doing session and road work with the likes of The Chrysalids, Carly Simon, Roger Daltrey, Kip Hanrahan, Jack Bruce (Cream), Noel Redding (Jimi Hendrix), Billy Cox, Chico Hamilton, Natalie Merchant (10,000 Maniacs), Loup Garoup, Bill Bissette, Jerome Godboo (The Phantoms), The Doodlebops, Mark Taylor, Robert Graham, Jimmy Rankin (Rankin Family), and was a member of Corky Laing’s band Cork. His most recent work has been with The Open Hearts Society.\n\nSingles\n\nwith THE SPIN DOCTORS\n\n1992 Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong/Two Princes (Epic/Sony) 35-74473\n\n1992 Two Princes (Album Version)/Off My Line (Live) (Epic/Sony) 35-74804\n\n1992 How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?)/Hard To Exist (Epic/Sony) 35-74910\n\n1993 Jimmy Olsen’s Blues/Yo Mama’s a Pajama (Epic/Sony) 35-74929\n\n1993 What Time Is It?
