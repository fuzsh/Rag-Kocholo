        "text": "Menzies entered the Victorian parliament in 1928. A few years later, in 1934, he was elected to the federal parliament. He was the attorney general under Prime Minister Joseph Lyons. After the death of Lyons, Menzies was chosen to be the next prime minister.\n\nSoon after Menzies took office, World War II began. He traveled to England to discuss Australia’s position in the war with Winston Churchill. When Menzies returned to Australia, he was the target of much criticism within his government. He decided to step down as prime minister in August 1941.\n\nMenzies remained active in parliament. He helped to establish a new political party, the Liberal Party. In 1949, as leader of the Liberal Party, Menzies became prime minister for a second time. The 1950s was a time of industrial growth for Australia. He sponsored the development of natural resources and transportation."
