She was known for her roles as Louisa von Trapp in the 1965 film The Sound of Music and Jessica 6 in the TV series Logan's Run.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHeather Margaret Brotherston Menzies[4] was born in Toronto on December 3, 1949, to Scottish parents[5][6] who had left the United Kingdom for Canada after the war.[7] Her father was a struggling artist. By Menzies' 14th birthday, she had lived in Vancouver, Miami, London, and Southern California. She had a younger sister, Sheila, and an older brother, Neil, who died in 2019.[5]\n\nMenzies was a graduate of John Burroughs High School in Burbank, California, in 1967, and she studied at Falcon Studio's University of the Arts.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMenzies' first appearance on-screen was in 1964, when she appeared in the TV series The Farmer's Daughter.[2] She was cast in The Sound of Music as Louisa, the third-oldest of the von Trapp children, at age 14, with no prior acting experience.[citation needed] Menzies sang \"So Long, Farewell\" and the \"Lonely Goatherd\" in the film. In the rowboat scene, Heather rescued Kym Karath, who played Gretl and couldn't swim.[9]\n\nMenzies went on to appear in a number of television series such as Alias Smith and Jones, T. J. Hooker, Dragnet, Room 222, Bonanza, Marcus Welby, M.D., Vega$, and The Bob Newhart Show. She starred as Jessica 6 in the short-lived TV series Logan's Run.[9] In addition, Menzies appeared in Hawaii,[2] How Sweet It Is!,[10] Hail, Hero!,[10] Piranha,[2] and Endangered Species.[2]\n\nMenzies was featured in Playboy magazine during 1973 in a pictorial titled \"Tender Trapp\", in reference to her The Sound of Music role.[citation needed] She was later cast in four television films: The Keegans,[11] James Dean,[12] Tail Gunner Joe,[13] and Captain America.[14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMenzies married John Cluett in 1969 and divorced him in 1973.
