        "text": "A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENT\n\n1894\n\n20th December: Robert Gordon Menzies was born in Jeparit in Victoria's Mallee district, the third son and fourth child of James and Kate Menzies.\n\n1899\n\nStarts state school in Jeparit and later Ballarat. Finishes in 1907.\n\n1908\n\nTopped State Scholarships Examinations and continued schooling on scholarships at Grenville College, Ballarat.\n\n1910\n\nFamily moved to Melbourne where a scholarship took Robert to Wesley College, a Methodist private school\n\n1913\n\nStudied law at University of Melbourne where he was influenced by Prof. Sir (William) Harrison Moore, Dean of the Faculty of Law.\n\n1916\n\nGraduated with first class honours in law and won Bowen Essay Prize.\n\n1918\n\nAdmitted to the Bar where he read with Owen Dixon, a future Justice and Chief Justice of the High Court.\n\n1920\n\nWas the sole counsel for the successful party in the landmark constitutional litigation: the Engineers' Case.\n\n1920\n\nMarried Pattie Leckie, whose father, John Leckie, had sat in the House of Representatives for Indi and was subsequently elected to the Senate.\n\n1928\n\nElected at a by-election to the Legislative Council or Upper House of the Victorian Parliament as a Nationalist member for the East Yarra Province.\n\n1928\n\nAppointed a junior Minister in Sir William McPherson's administration.\n\n1929\n\nResigned from the McPherson Ministry in protest against a concession made to the Country Progressive Party, a breakaway from the Victorian Country Party.\n\n1929\n\nAppointed a King's Counsel. In the December election was elected as the Nationalist member for Nunawading in the Victorian Legislative Assembly or Lower House.\n\n1931\n\nPlayed a significant role in the formation of the United Australia Party, which was to absorb the Nationalist Party.\n\n1931\n\nBrought Joseph Aloysius Lyons, a one-time Labor Premier of Tasmania and a former Minister in the Scullin Labor Government, into the non-Labor fold.\n\n1932\n\nAppointed Attorney-General and Minister for Railways in a United Australia Party and United Country Party composite Ministry led by Sir Stanley Argyle.\n\n1934\n\nContested and won the federal seat of Kooyong. UAP and the Country Party agreed on the conditions for forming a composite Ministry.\n\n1934\n\nBefore he had even been sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives, Menzies was appointed and sworn in as Attorney-General and Minister for Industry.\n\n1935\n\nMember of the official party attending King George V's Silver Jubilee celebrations.\n\n1935\n\nMade his first appearance as an advocate before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\n1936\n\nImpressively but unsuccessfully presented the Commonwealth Government's case in the Privy Council appeal, James v. the Commonwealth.\n\n1937\n\nAppointed a member of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council. In an election that same year the Lyons-Page Government was comfortably returned to office.\n\n1938\n\nVisited England on trade negotiations and also visited Europe. This visit may have started or intensified a deteriorating relationship with Sir Earle Page.\n\n1938\n\nMenzies unsuccessfully proposed that Australia should adopt the Statute of Westminster of 1931.\n\n1939\n\nOn 14th March Menzies resigned from the Lyons Ministry and from the Deputy Leadership of the United Australia Party on the issue of National Insurance.\n\n1939\n\nOn 7th April Lyons died suddenly. Sir Earle Page commissioned as Prime Minister, understanding he would make way for the new leader of the UAP once elected.\n\n1939\n\nMenzies became Prime Minister; On 3rd September Menzies announced that Australia was at war with Nazi Germany after its invasion of Poland.\n\n1940\n\nOn 21st September an election was held. Menzies just scraped home but thereafter relied on the support of two Independents to remain in office.\n\n1941\n\nJanuary-May: Menzies made a visit to the Middle East, Britain, Canada and the USA, extending his time in Britain three times with the approval of the Cabinet.\n\n1941\n\nTrip extended due to fear that without his presence Winston Churchill, British PM, would be less than mindful of Australia's interests as a fellow belligerent.\n\n1941/08/29\n\nMenzies resigned the Prime Ministership in favour of Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party. Menzies remained leader of the United Australia Party.\n\n1941/10/03\n\nFadden's administration was defeated on its budget when the two Independents on whose support his government had relied crossed the floor.\n\n1941/10/03\n\nAssured by these Independents that they were prepared to support the Labor Party, the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, commissioned John Curtin as Prime Minister.\n\n1941/10/03\n\nUAP refused to back Menzies as leader of the Opposition and opted instead for Fadden. Menzies resigned his party's leadership in disgust.\n\n1942\n\nMenzies through a network of commercial radio stations began a series of broadcasts, including one entitled \"The Forgotten People\". Series continued into 1944.\n\n1943\n\nThe Opposition parties led respectively by Fadden and Hughes were defeated in a landslide in the election held on 21st August.\n\n1943\n\nMenzies reclaims leadership of what was left of the UAP. He's then able to successfully stake his claim to become Leader of the Opposition for the first time.\n\n1944\n\nMenzies successfully led the Opposition parties against the Fourteen Powers Referendum.\n\n1944\n\nMenzies was also to the forefront in calling conferences in Albury and Canberra to discuss the formation of a new non-Labor party.\n\n1945\n\nOn the resumption of Parliament on 21st February, Menzies was able to announce that he and his parliamentary colleagues were now members of the \"Liberal Party of Australia\". This followed the recent formation of the Party in Oct-Dec 1944.\n\n1945\n\nOn 5th July, John Curtin died. On his election as party leader, J. B. (Ben) Chifley was commissioned as Prime Minister.\n\n1946\n\nLate in September an election was held in which Chifley led his government to victory. Menzies' piecemeal gains in the House brought little comfort.\n\n1947\n\nCabinet resolved to nationalise the private trading banks. Menzies mounted a major attack on the legislation and the Government’s nationalisation policies.\n\n1947\n\nAlthough the legislation breezed through the Parliament it was ultimately defeated when the High Court and later the Privy Council pronounced it invalid.\n\n1948\n\nMenzies visited Britain and Europe. On the strength of his observations there, he reversed his previous opposition to the idea of banning the Communist Party.\n\n1949/12/10\n\nMenzies leads opposition in convincingly defeating the Chifley government. House of Representatives majority was substantial. Senate majority was not achieved.\n\n1950\n\nCommunist Party Dissolution Bill was introduced and eventually passed. While visiting the USA, Menzies was invested as a Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit.\n\n1950\n\nMenzies commits Australian troops to be part of the United Nations force in the Korean War.\n\n1951\n\nAn election for both Houses was called for 28th April, the second double dissolution of the Commonwealth Parliament - the first had been called in 1914.\n\n1951\n\nMenzies was returned with a slight reduction in his majority in the House of Representatives but with a comfortable working majority in the Senate.\n\n1951\n\nChifley died shortly afterwards and was succeeded as Labor leader by Dr. H. V. Evatt.\n\n1951\n\nReferendum proposals to overturn the High Court's invalidation of Communist Party Dissolution Act were defeated. Seen as a significant triumph for Dr Evatt.\n\n1951\n\nMenzies was gazetted a Member of the Order of Companions of Honour (CH).\n\n1953\n\nAn election for half the Senate enabled the Government barely to retain a working majority in the Upper House.\n\n1954\n\nIn April, after the defection of MVD Officer Vladimir Petrov, Menzies established a Royal Commission on Espionage to examine extent of espionage in Australia.\n\n1954\n\nElection on 29th May for the House of Representatives alone confounded the expectations of many by resulting in the Menzies Government's narrow return to office\n\n1955\n\nA catastrophic split in the Labor Party precipitated by the erratic conduct of Dr. Evatt ensured the comfortable return of the Menzies Government.\n\n1955\n\nMenzies committed troops to the Malayan emergency.\n\n1956\n\nMenzies appoints Sir Keith Murray to inquire into the state of Australia’s Universities, bringing about the most significant change to universities ever.\n\n1956\n\nEstablished the Australian Universities Commission.

The lake was part of Walter Burley Griffin’s original vision for the city.\n\n1961\n\nArthur Calwell almost led Labor to victory in an election in December. Menzies continued in office with a working House of Representatives majority of one.\n\n1963\n\nMenzies was created a Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT).\n\n1963\n\nAt the end of the year Sir Robert Menzies restored his party's fortunes with a comfortable election victory in an election for the House of Representatives.\n\n1964\n\nAt the end of the year Menzies successfully led the Government in an election for half the Senate. This proved to be his last campaign.\n\n1965\n\nMenzies committed the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam.\n\n1965\n\nAustralian military advisors had been in Vietnam at the request of the South Vietnamese Government since 1962.\n\n1966\n\nOn 26 January, Menzies retired as Prime Minister of Australia and as Parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party.\n\n1966\n\nIn July Menzies was installed as Sir Winston Churchill's successor as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.\n\n1977\n\nMenzies was invested as a Knight in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AK).\n\n1978\n\nMenzies died at his home in Haverbrack Avenue in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern on 15th May.\n\n1978\n\nMenzies was given a State funeral.
