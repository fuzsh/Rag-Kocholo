The loss to the nation is a heavy one, and I move:\n\nThat this House express its deep regret at the death on15 May 1978 of the Right Honourable Sir Robert Gordon Menzies: Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle; Knight of the Order of Australia; Companion of Honour; Queen’s Counsel; Fellow of the Royal Society; a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1928 to 1929; a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1929 to 1934; Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1932 to 1 934; a member of this House for the Division of Kooyong from 1934 to 1966; founder and for many years Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia; a Minister of the Crown for over 25 years; and Prime Minister of Australia from 1939 to 1941, and from 1949 to 1966; places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family.\n\nSir Robert Menzies was born 83 years ago in the small Victorian town of Jeparit. By his own ability, his own determination, his own courage and his own will he became one of the greatest Australians this nation has brought forth. His towering influence helped to mould this nation. He stood uncompromisingly for the abiding traditions and values of Australia. His temporary defeat in 1941 served only to lift him and to reveal his extraordinary resources of energy, the strength of his beliefs and the fortitude of his spirit. He led Australia through the boom years of the 1950s and into a period of unprecedented national development in the economy, industry, agriculture, the arts and learning.\n\nSir Robert’s rise to eminence was meteoric. In 1917 he graduated in law from the University of Melbourne with great distinction and one year later- at 23 years of age- he was admitted to the Bar. Within a remarkably brief period at the Victorian Bar in which his practice ranged over industrial, common and constitutional law Menzies built a formidable name as a brilliant legal intellect and an outstanding advocate. His greatest triumph as a young barrister was his remarkable appearance in 1920- at 25 years of age-in the celebrated Engineers Case. After that historic case, in which he successfully stood alone against several notable King’s Counsel, he appeared in many famous constitutional cases before the High Court and the Privy Council. This outstanding constitutional lawyer had few rivals and in 1929- at 34 years of age- he became Australia ‘s youngest King ‘s Counsel.\n\nIn all Sir Robert’s days his love for the law never waned. But it was no narrow interest. For him law and civilisation were inseparably bound together. Opportunities to speak and write on law and public affairs were always welcome to him. At the age of 72, when most professional scholars have put down their pens, he made a distinguished contribution as scholarinresidence at the University of Virginia, where he lectured on the Australian Constitution with all the authority, clarity and wit we knew so well. It is scarcely surprising that a man of such formidable talent for the law and such high regard for its sanctity should be chosen to serve as Attorney-General in both the State and Federal spheres or that he should have distinguished those ministries with his commanding legal experience.\n\nSir Robert turned to politics in 1928. He first entered the Victorian Parliament, where he served nearly six years. Characteristically, he quickly made his mark as parliamentarian and Minister, holding several portfolios, and within four years, at the age of 37, he became Deputy Premier. In 1934 he contested and won the seat of Kooyong and held it for the next 32 years. His unfailing interest in his constituents and his commitment to them earned him their loyalty, their trust and their admiration. Immediately upon his election to Federal Parliament, Sir Robert was appointed Attorney-General and Minister for Industry, portfolios he held until 1939. In that year -just five years after his election the the House of Representatives- he became Prime Minister. His first Prime Ministership was from 1939 to 1941, and in that time he administered the portfolios of Treasury, Defence Co-ordination, Trade and Customs, and Information. These were years of extraordinary activity in which Sir Robert had achieved what for many men would have been the work and ambition of many lifetimes. But his finest years were yet to come.\n\nHistory has recorded that the United Australian Party splintered, turned from its leader and fell apart. Inevitably there was a change of government. The trials of these years may have left most men embittered and unnerved. They served only to spur Menzies to embark on a program of reshaping, rebuilding, remodelling and reassessing the needs of those Australians who had pinned their faith to a Liberal alternative. He struggled with adversity and won. From the ashes of the United Australia\n\nParty and through the vision and undaunted determination of one man- Sir Robert Menziesthere arose the Liberal Party of Australia. This was a party which he designed to serve all Australiato govern for all Australians- owing no special allegiance to any group or section.\n\nHe travelled Australia’s length and breadth persuading and inspiring. In 1949 he triumphed. The Liberal and Country parties won office and remained undefeated for 23 years. That period is now a matter of history. Above all, it is the history of Menzies.\n\nMenzies’ return to the Prime Ministership in 1949 came at a time of great domestic and international uncertainty. Depression and war had had a devastating effect. The world was tired of conflict, fearful for the future. But for Menzies these were to be the years when all that he had passed through was simply preparation for his finest hours.\n\nHis great task was to restore the confidence and stability of a nation recovering from the rigours and the distress of war, and this he did. Drawing on his considerable will, knowledge and experience, he guided Australia for 16 years with the steadfast hand of a leader sure of his ground and sure in the judgment of the Australian people. His years of strong and stable government gave strength and confidence to this nation, to the Australian people, and set this country firmly on a course of recovery and uprecedented development.\n\nSir Robert was recognised by all as one of the Queen’s men. He saw clearly the place of the Crown in the Australian body politic, and stood by the principles of constitutional monarchy which are the fundamental base of our political life. Many people will recall Her Majesty’s first visit to this country in 1954 and how she was escorted with dignity and with a profound sense of the occasion by her Australian Prime Minister to the opening of this Parliament. We are all honoured by the gracious tribute Her Majesty has now paid to her former Prime Minister. It will be a source of comfort to Sir Robert’s family.\n\nSir Robert’s rich sense of the nation’s history, his vision of its vast potential, his evident love for its soil and its people, his presence and his eloquence ensured that Australia’s place in international affairs would become more firmly established, more widely known. He was one of the Commonwealth’s most eloquent spokesmen, and in time became one of her best loved statesmen. He attended the Prime Ministers’ Conferences in London, striving through difficult and changing times to consolidate Commonwealth ties and to strengthen Australia’s relationship with Britain. His admiration and respect for the country that had fathered the traditions of the rule of law, the country of Blackstone, of Milton, of Shakespeare and of Burns, earned him a special place in the hearts of the British people. Undoubtedly, the stature of Australia’s Prime Minister during these years greatly added to the international prestige and influence of this nation.\n\nHis attachment to the Commonwealth did not blind him to the changing reality of new international horizons. As one of the founders of ANZUS and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation, he was fully aware of the need to consolidate Australia’s natural bonds with its neighbours. He was equally aware that we should retain our relationship with the more powerful and more distant nations of the world. He conducted his relationship with both the new and old friends with ease and assurance. His loyalty and reliability was never in question and he brought his great authority to every council. He earned the respect of all.\n\nUpon his retirement, Sir Robert was invited to name two achievements for which he would most like to be remembered. He nominated his Government’s encouragement of tertiary education, something in which he had had a close personal interest, and the development of the national capital. Learning was for Sir Robert Menzies the cardinal privilege and his consuming passion because he believed that where there was learning there could be wisdom. Sir Robert established the Australian Universities Commission and encouraged the growth of the Australian National University. He was convinced that all Australians should have opportunities to share in a full educational experience and his Government presided over a vast expansion in tertiary education in this country. Again, it was characteristic of his pride in the nation that he should wish to enhance its capital. The Canberra of today, the city of lakes and fine public buildings, is a great and enduring monument to his vision.\n\nMr Speaker, such were the achievements and stature of the man that it was to be expected that some would say he was a distant political figure, but he won the respect not only of his political supporters but also of those who never voted for his Party. To his friends he was a warm and delightful companion. To those who served him he was always courteous and considerate, and to his family he was a constant symbol of devotion and love. He endeared himself to Australians from all walks of life by his love of cricket and, in Victoria by his support of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nAustralians will have many memories of Sir Robert Menzies: Memories of him as a Prime Minister who led this country for 16 consecutive years; memories of him as a Prime Minister who strove to enrich the resources, the opportunities and the talent of this nation; memories of him as a Prime Minister who cemented and extended our relations with Britain and the Commonwealth; memories of him as a Prime Minister who continued to nurture our relations with other allies such as the United States of America; memories of him as a Prime Minister who saw the need for and fostered the highest standard of professionalism and intergrity in the Public Service; memories of his consumate skills as an orator, his mastery as a political tactician, his unerring sense of political timing and his integrity.\n\nMr Speaker, anyone who had the pleasure to hear Sir Robert speak will remember his devastating wit. He had the rare ability to make a jibe at his own expense. He once recalled that on the previous Sunday he had read the lesson at the Presbyterian Kirk, a reading which had included the Ten Commandments. ‘To a practising politician’, he said, ‘I know of no document more disturbing- unless it be the Sermon on the Mount’. But, above all, his. parliamentary colleagues will remember him for his abiding belief in our great democratic principles, in the central role of Parliament and in the rule of law. He was a champion of the concept of responsible government in the Westminster tradition. Over many years he strove to develop our Cabinet system into that which we know today.\n\nIn the past few days I have received numerous messages of condolence and sympathy from leaders around the world. President Carter has referred to Sir Robert as ‘a great statesman whose leadership and influence extended far beyond Australia’. Prime Minister Callaghan has written of ‘His courage, his devotion to duty and his wisdom (which) have ensured him an honoured place in the history of our time ‘. There is one message which I should like to read in full, for it captures in essence the feelings expressed by many during the last week. It is from Mr Lee Kwan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, and reads:\n\nI send you my condolences on the death of Sir Robert Menzies. He was one of the great men of his era.\n\nHe had a commanding presence, a powerful intellect and a rare eloquence.\n\nHis robust approach to life enabled him to make more than Australia ‘s contribution to the world ‘s quest for peace and stability in an age of rapid and revolutionary changes.\n\nHe has left his imprint on the history of Australia and of the region.\n\nMr Speaker, in 1937 Sir Robert was created a Privy Councillor. In 1951 he was created a Companion of Honour. In 1 963 the Queen created Sir Robert a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the Thistle. In 1965 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1966 after his retirement from politics, he was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, following in the path of Sir Winston Churchill. In 1976 Sir Robert was created a Knight of the Order of Australia- the first Australian to receive that accolade.\n\nThe honours showered on him over many years are a fitting tribute to Sir Robert’s stature as an Australian and Commonwealth statesman. As generations pass it is easy to forget those who have gone before. But Sir Robert Menzies has left an indelible mark upon countless facets of Australian life. He will be remembered as a leader, a statesman, a scholar, an ally, a friend, and to his family as a loving and devoted husband, brother and father. He gave to each of these roles the full measure of his being. To this one man- Robert Gordon Menzies- Australia owes an immense debt. It is a debt which future generations of Australians can honour by holding fast to the virtues he brought from his forebears and carried into his life- the virtues of sincerity, integrity, loyalty, steadfastness and courage. And we can honour him by following his example of unstinting service to this nation, serving all the people and working to reinforce those fundamental values which unite us as one nation, as one people. I believe that Sir Robert would wish to be honoured by no more than this. Mr Speaker, we are in the midst of mourning Robert Gordon Menzies, but we should also console ourselves that here was a great man who left a great name for himself and for this country. What more can we possibly ask of any citizen than this?\n\nMr HAYDEN:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Oxley\n\nMr Speaker, the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies became in his lifetime what few people ever achieve. From a modest family background he became an outstanding student and an eminent practitioner at the Bar. He achieved early entry to the Victorian Parliament, and became a remarkably young Deputy Premier of the State of Victoria at 34 years of age. He proceeded to the national Parliament, immediately entering the Ministry, and became Prime Minister at the still young age of 45 years. From 1949 to 1966 he served a record unbroken term as Prime Minister.\n\nRegardless of the differences which one might have had with his political views and policies, one has to concede- I do so in generous measure- that in those 17 years of service as Prime Minister of Australia he proved himself to be a masterful political tactician and a shrewd and effective parliamentarian. The course in the national Parliament from his entry in 1934 up to 1949 was not without its hurdles for him, nor would anyone suggest he found it, nor even caused it to be, uneventful. The period from 1941 to 1949 must have been a somewhat fretful one for him in many ways. It was, however, in this period that he so successfully refashioned the disintegrating conservative political forces in this country into a cohesive and lasting political party- the Liberal Party. It was a remarkable achievement and now, some 30 years after its formation, that Party continues to function with the longest continuity of public service of any conservative national political party in the nation’s history. Another of the late Sir Robert Menzies’ important political successes was to draw the Country Party into a lasting national coalition with his Liberal Party.\n\nThese were no small achievements, especially for a man whose sharpness of intellect gave him, according to record, an impatience with so much of the time consuming, mundane, but important basic organising and arranging which is part of the political scene. The period 194 1 to 1 949 gave him, it would seem, time to reflect on his earlier political setbacks and to regenerate his political thinking and tactics. When I entered this Parliament after the 1961 election the late Sir Robert Menzies was then close to the end of a long and significant career. He had just survived a remarkably close election. I remember the period well. It was not only the time of my first election to this House but also the occasion of the rather novel experience of discovering, on the good advice of the then right honourable member for Kooyong, that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) was ‘magnificent’.\n\nI leave the history of the late former right honourable member for Kooyong ‘s service in public office, spanning nearly half a century, to those better qualified than I am to write, more fittingly, as a suitable epitaph to a long and notable career. I restrict myself to those last five years during which he served in this Parliament while I was here. One’s recollection is of a big, robust man who obviously revelled in the action of the parliamentary scene. This was the period of serious economic rethinking after the 1961-62 recession when the Vernon Committee of Inquiry was set up to recommend on the development of future economic policy. Re-equipment of the Air Force with a new tactical bomber was entered into as a matter of great urgency. The controversial commitment to the Vietnam war was made. Some initiatives were also undertaken in the field of education.\n\nRight to the very end of his parliamentary career the late Sir Robert Menzies was in the thick of public debate over measures he proposed or had undertaken. He was never faint hearted; nor did he hesitate to put his case firmly on the issues he took up. Perhaps the most enduring recollection I have of him, apart from his readiness to enter into the rough and tumble of parliamentary exchange with a quick and entertaining verve- I seem to recall being bruised a few times in such unwise encounters in my earliest years- was his clear, consistent and impressive devotion to the parliamentary institution. In this, I believe, he displayed a respect for the parliamentary system since lost but which could well be rescued with advantage to its reputation and influence in the community.\n\nLet me quote the comment of one observer of the late and former right honourable member for Kooyong:\n\nSir Robert Menzies was one of the most effective politicians in Australia ‘s history. He had a way of identifying the attitudes of the average Australian and appealing very vividly, clearly, and incisively to those attitudes, showing a skill and understanding that I didn’t suspect he had.\n\nHe didn’t appear to have the common touch. I thought he was consciously or naturally aristocratic and it surprised me to find out he had an ability to know what the average man felt. I don’t know how he did this, but I would say he had a good deal of natural flair for it.\n\nThe quotation is important because it comes from a man whose political values were as different from those of the late Sir Robert Menzies as is the quality of chalk from that of cheese. Yet they are the comments formed from the careful, long and fair minded assessment of a political opponent and they are clearly the comments of respect. The commentator was the former honourable member for Lalor, Dr Jim Cairns, quoted in A. Colin ‘s Mr Prime Minister: Australian Prime Ministers 1901-1972.\n\nThe Opposition joins the Government in expressing its condolences at the passing of Sir Robert Menzies and extends its deepest sympathies to his widow, Dame Pattie Menzies, and to members of his family.\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nMinister for Trade and Resources · Richmond · NCP/NP\n\n– I feel very proud to be associated with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm\n\nFraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in speaking to the condolence motion before the Parliament. I am proud to be able to speak on behalf of the National Country Party, because of my party’s long association with Sir Robert Gordon Menzies and because of my personal association with him. I probably knew Sir Robert as long as any member in this House. I, along with a few other honourable membersyourself included, Mr Speaker, the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair)- were selected and served in his ministries. My father served in Sir Robert’s first Ministry before the war and also in his post-war Cabinets. I feel that I can speak about Sir Robert Menzies, and in doing so I classify him as Australia’s greatest statesman, a brilliant orator, an outstanding parliamentarian and a great leader.\n\nSir Robert’s funeral last Friday was a remarkable occasion for this nation. We saw people from throughout Australia and from around the world pay a triumphant tribute to this great man. Thousands of people lined the streets. Many of them expressed their sorrow. The remarkable thing about that occasion was that it was some 12 years after he departed from political life. As we all know, most politicians are forgotten the day after they retire. Not Sir Robert Menzies. He had welded for himself a lasting place in the history of this nation. It is a matter of history that the close relationship which everybody knows existed between Sir Robert and my party in the 1950s and the 1960s had been, in earlier years, not always a happy one. There is no doubting that the relationship between Sir Robert and the Country Party during the years of the coalition in the 1950s and 1960s was a matter of great significance to him and, I believe, to Australia. I think it is worth recalling some of the things he said to the nation on the day he retired from office, on 20 January 1966. He referred to the immense loyalty he had enjoyed from both partiesthe Liberal Party of Australia and the Country Party- and went on to say:\n\nIt is not always understood that over these years the stability of government, the continuity of government . . . have been based upon an alliance between my party and the Country Party which in all these years has never been broken, and in the whole of which I have been profoundly indebted to the members of both parties who, though they may be critical and, of course, undoubtedly are from time to time, have been staunch and loyal.\n\nSir Robert’s answer to a question about what he saw as his most lasting achievement was most important, especially to members of my party.\n\nHe referred firstly to the creation of the Liberal Party in 1 944 and then said:\n\nI look back with great satisfaction on the fact that there has been a fruitful and constant alliance with the Country Party . . . We have for all these years been a joint government. I have had the most tremendous loyalty not only from Country Party Ministers- in particular Mr McEwen, who is a most distinguished man- but also its private members. It is not always easy to have a marriage of this kind.\n\nHe went on to say:\n\nIf at any time over these years I had come back with an absolute majority of the Liberal Party on the floor of the House, I still would have said to the Country Party, ‘I want you to be in’.\n\nThere are people who tried to deny the magnitude of the contribution that Sir Robert Menzies made to Australia while he was Prime Minister. They bring forward the fatuous argument that there is nothing of real significance for which he can be remembered. That is obviously untrue. Australia’s progress in fields such as education, national development and trade during the Menzies-Fadden and the Menzies-McEwen period makes that quite clear. If these critics are saying that Australia under Menzies lacked drama, lacked division and lacked instability, if they are saying that Australia under Menzies enjoyed solid economic and social progress, enjoyed political stability unmatched in any other country, enjoyed full employment and enjoyed inflation rates which, if we had them today, would make us the envy of the world, these critics are unconsciously pointing to the things for which Sir Robert deserves to be remembered.\n\nNo other Australian has occupied the place that Sir Robert Menzies held. Whether people were for him or against him they regarded him in a way in which no other Australian has ever been regarded. I think the only way to describe his unique place in Australian life and history is to say that he was an institution. The meaning of the word institution in this context is very simple but I think it is appropriate. It means a familiar object. Sir Robert was a familiar object. To many Australians he was the government. He was the rock on which our stability and our security were built. To the world, Menzies was Australia. To those who knew him personally there are many memories one could reiterate today. I go back to when I was a young school boy, having to view some movies of his travels overseas. I recall them as not being very exciting. I remember him most as Chairman of Cabinet. Many stories are written about him being a very frightening man; certainly he was a taskmaster. Whenever he placed responsibility on Ministers he expected them to perform. He was very humiliating to a Minister who had not done his homework and tried to bluff his way through. He inculcated into members of his Ministry the need for integrity and honesty which I believe will last for a long time in the Australian political scene.\n\nI remember clearly his great interest in the development of the national capital while I was Minister for the Interior. Modern Canberra is greatly indebted to him. Canberra was stagnant for years and years until Sir Robert Menzies decided that this was the national capital and needed to be reflected as such to Australia and the world. He took upon himself the responsibility of a revived Canberra by developing the lakes and bridges, building the National Library and making it the great capital which it is today and of which we are all proud. I shall always think of Sir Robert Menzies as being a Queen’s man. His allegiance to the Queen and his readiness at all times to defend the monarchy was something for which he deserves great credit. He was not defending the monarchy because of any personalities, but as a lawyer and as a person who understood the Constitution of Australia. He knew that, inherent in our democratic system, in our parliamentary way of life and in our common law, it was necessary to recognise the monarch if we were to preserve that system. When I visited him on one occasion during his retirement I quite clearly recall him telling me about the various other types of parliamentary systems around the world and finishing his remarks by saying: ‘Give me another one that is better than ours. If it is not, why should we want to change our situation?’\n\nNo tribute, no testimonial, to Sir Robert would be complete without reference to Dame Pattie. Like so many of us in Parliament who rely heavily upon our wives, so did Sir Robert Menzies. Dame Pattie was the perfect example of what a parliamentarian’s wife should be. She gave to Sir Robert Menzies strength, encouragement and support in the heavy duties and onerous responsibilities he had as leader of the nation. To her I pay a great tribute. On this sad occasion I express sympathy on behalf of all the members of my party and myself. I should like Dame Pattie to convey those sympathies to the members of her family.\n\nSir William McMahon:\n\nLOWE, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n-I think it is fair to say that I knew the late right honourable member for Kooyong for longer than any other person in this House. I certainly knew him as far back as 1934 when he was a practising lawyer. I remember him from before I became a member of the firm Allen Allen and Hemsley.\n\nThey acted for the Legislative Council, the Upper House, in New South Wales to prevent its dissolution. And that the Governor of New South Wales had the power to dismiss Mr J. T. Lang, the Premier. We acted for Mr Trethowan and others of the Upper House who were the petitioners. Sir Robert gave advice to Sir Dudley de Chair which was contrary to the case we supported. For once we won. The Upper House survived.\n\nI knew Sir Robert in other capacities. The firm handled one of the most important patent suits of all time. So much royalty was involved for our clients that we took the case from various State courts to the Federal court and then to the Privy Council. During that case I was informed that R. G. Menzies was slowly but surely convincing the Lords Justices of Appeal, the Privy Council, that there was no invention which could be patented. Sure enough, regrettably, he turned out to be right. I did not like him for a long period but had to swallow my pride subsequently. I believed at that time-I believed so more strongly later on when I was associated with him as a minister- that he was, with Sir Owen Dixon, one of the two greatest jurists ever produced in Australia. He was a delight to listen to in the courts. He was always persuasive and he always had charm. It was to be said of him that he usually won. Those were my first experiences with him.\n\nI then had a passing acquaintance with him when the Liberal Party was being formed. The United Australia Party organisation in New South Wales had disintegrated. Two Liberal Parties were formed and later merged. Sir Robert then took control and amalgamated them and other like-minded parties in other States spread throughout Australia into one organisation.\n\nI come now to the Parliament itself. Naturally I knew of his contribution in the banking case, one of the great cases in Australian history. In the House Sir Robert paved the way for the defeat of the Chifley proposals for bank nationalisation. The final decision again came from the Privy Council. I remember when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was being debated in the House. I was sitting where the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is sitting now waiting to answer the Labor Party. Sir Eric Harrison came in and said: ‘Can I have a look at your notes, son?’. He then painstakingly tore up all the notes and said: This will be your moment of trial; and one of decision. You are rotten when you read but not too bad when you speak without notes’. After that speech I was invited by Sir Robert to join the\n\nCabinet. I had to wait for some weeks, during which time I was informed on a couple of occasions that somebody else might be appointed in my stead. Then I received advice from a Cabinet Minister. I went to Ezra Norton of the Daily Mirror and sought his support. Within a couple of days I became a member of the Cabinet. I say that in the presence of my colleagues to let them know that I learned in those days that there always is someone able to give us guidance of a very helpful kind.\n\nI remember the morning he asked me to become a member of the Ministry. I was at the Balmoral Naval Base. He said that I would be Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air. Somewhat reluctantly I said: ‘That does not appeal to me very much, Sir. What is wrong with the Treasury?’ I thought that he would have a fit of hysterics, but he replied: ‘I don’t think I would have the courage to talk to dear old Artie about that’. I managed to survive in those years as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air, I do not know how, because on at least three occasions I made major and successful decisions without informing Cabinet. As an example, I allowed the war criminals from Manus Island to go back to Japan without informing Sir Robert, and I gave approval for a £2 program for the Sydney dockyard without telling the Cabinet but with the approval of the Treasury officials. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, they were memorable days. I stuck it out, but only because I had the support of Sir Arthur Fadden and Sir Eric Harrison.\n\nI do not want to proceed on that line for too long, but I want to give the reasons why I believe Sir Robert must be remembered and what his main achievements were. First, I must stress that he changed the outlook of the Commonwealth Parliament to the Constitution. Some amendments had already been made through placitum (xxiiiA) of section 51 of the Constitution, the Evatt amendment which dealt with social welfare and health services. Apart from that, in those days the Federal Parliament was truly a Federal Parliament and did not believe in interfering where the rights and responsibilities were obviously those of the States. Slowly but surely Sir Robert changed this attitude. One of the great constitution changes, therefore, was that over a wide range of activities Sir Robert took action which I believe involved and ensured development and growth in Australia and, through that, set us on the road to achieving a unity that otherwise could never have been achieved or achieved so quickly.\n\nThere was his attitude to education, which he liked to take pride in himself as his greatest achievement. I put it no higher than third because there were other things that he did as well. I can remember Artie Fadden coming into Cabinet and saying: ‘What do you think, mates? I have to announce that we are giving aid to the church schools in Canberra, and he did not even tell me before he left’. I can also remember that in a Cabinet meeting I was pressing strenuously to get aid for independent schools and it looked as though I had lost. I was supported by Sir Garfield Barwick. Suddenly I mumbled: Wouldn’t it be a wonderful thing, Sir, if when you go to the Christian Brothers in Waverley you give them aid for their libraries and their science blocks?’ He said that that was a wonderful idea. A couple of days later we had the wonderful announcement. The Prime Minister will know that the Federal Government then went on to provide aid for independent schools.\n\nSir Robert was a remarkable man, and I must stress that no one paid greater attention to employment and unemployment than he did. He established a totally new attitude to unemployment, and as Minister for Labour and National Service I was aware of this. If he saw the rate of unemployment growing to around 1 per cent close to the Christmas period, we would meet to see what we could do to ensure that it was kept low. The matter of pensions was another of his great preoccupations. In those respects he was a remarkable man. Above all, he had an instinct for economic trends. On at least two occasions he took independent action to ensure that changes were made which improved the trends in the economy. He acted despite the opinions given by the Department of the Treasury and despite the opinions that had been accepted by other members of the Cabinet.\n\nIn regard to foreign affairs, we lived in times that were temperamental and tempestuous. I remember when he was either in the United Kingdom or going through to Canada and he was asked to be the chairman of the committee dealing with the Suez crisis. Available members of the Cabinet were asked to meet in the British Empire Society- he had asked six or seven of us to be there each with a telephone- to discuss the chairmanship with him. Despite what has been said, we strongly urged him, led by Sir Arthur Fadden, not to do so. We felt that on occasions such as that one is likely to be undermined. That is exactly what happened. Sir Robert was Prime Minister during the time of the Korean war; he was Prime Minister during the time of the conflict in South East Asia. He and Sir Percy Spender were responsible for ANZUS and the\n\nSouth East Asia Treaty Organisation. The international changes in those days were of a kind that other than during world wars we had not had to face before and have not known since.\n\nAs a man, Sir Robert was a person of considerable charm. If one had the good fortune to divorce oneself from politics and go to dinner with him you would find a person of kindness and charm. He loved laughter; he loved pleasure; and he loved children. I remember him suggesting to me that I should read Beatrix Potter’s books, and I did. At his suggestion they were the first books I gave to my children when I thought they were able to understand. I must speak of Sir Robert as an unbelievably remarkable person, a very great man. He was probably the most eloquent speaker I have heard. For all these reasons I am glad that I have been able to associate myself with the Prime Minister and other people who have spoken from this side of the House. I must also pay my tribute to Dame Pattie. Wherever Sir Robert went one could be certain that Dame Pattie would be there as his helper and counsellor. She would make certain he remembered young children and the women of this country whenever major decisions were being made.\n\nMr LYNCH:\n\nMinister for Industry and Commerce · Flinders · LP\n\n– I express my deep regret at the death of Sir Robert Menzies and convey my condolences to Dame Pattie and her family. I cannot refer to Sir Robert as a former parliamentary colleague because my election to this House took place shortly after his retirement in 1966. My personal association with him commenced when I became the vice chairman of the Kooyong electorate committee on which I served during the last few years of Sir Robert’s term as member for Kooyong. I am indebted to the advice and guidance which he so generously gave to me at that time as well as subsequently, upon my election to this House. Sir Robert Menzies will rank as one of the great Australians of this century. His formidable achievements as statesman, parliamentarian, jurist and administrator have been referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other speakers.\n\nI take this opportunity to pay my tributes to those achievements and, as deputy leader of the party which he founded, to recognise the formidable contribution which he made to the nation. I also pay a particular tribute to Dame Pattie Menzies. Her support for and encouragement of Sir Robert were unfailing, and her graciousness was unmatched. The nation owes her, along with Sir Robert, an enduring appreciation.\n\nMr LUCOCK:\n\nLyne\n\n-As a member of this House and as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, I regard it a privilege to support the motion which has been moved by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Much has been said of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, and much has been written about the contribution that he made to the political and national life of this country and to the international field. I believe two factors above all others should be emphasised: Firstly, his absolute integrity which has never been questioned and has always been an example to new members of this Parliament; and, secondly, his vision for Australia and all sections of the people. We all recall so well the words that I think can truthfully be applied to him: ‘He walked with kings yet kept the common touch ‘.\n\nThe great strength and the inner power which came from the support of Dame Pattie Menzies and the home influence are examples to all of us in this day and generation. We watched that lovely person as she entered the church, sad and yet so serene, with proud memories of the achievement of her partner. From that I believe we all realised that here was part of the strength of the man whom we honoured on that day. All these things were bound up in the certainty of a great reformed faith which set the foundations for community responsibility and service to the people. Much has been said and I do not want to labour the point but I pay a tribute to a friend, a colleague and a true son of Australia. I join with others in sending condolences and prayers to Dame Pattie and her family at a time when they must be proud of the one whom they loved and who served this country.\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\nMinister for Primary Industry · New England · NCP/NP\n\n– I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which has been supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), the leader of my party. As a statesman, a parliamentarian, a lawyer and a man, Sir Robert Menzies dominated the political scene in Australia for many years. He made a tremendous contribution to it personally and through this chamber. Those of us who sat here with him recall the degree to which he dominated this place by his oratory and the manner of his parliamentary performance. I believe that, perhaps more than in his performance within the chamber, his contribution to Australia lay in the manner in which he presided over successive governments that developed this country into what it is today. Abroad he was seen, admired and respected as the epitome of this country at a time of change. As my leader has said, Dame Pattie was the epitome of the perfect wife of a parliamentarian. She is a wonderful person and all honourable members admire her greatly, both in her fortitude, in her present sadness and in the way in which for so long she helped Sir Robert in the performance of his public and private duties. To her and her family I would also like to extend my personal sympathy.\n\nMr BRYANT:\n\nWills\n\n-Only a handful of honourable members from this side of the House here this afternoon were members during Sir Robert Menzies’ term of office. Over the long period in which I knew him and the longer period in which I knew of him, I always regarded Sir Robert Menzies, both privately and publicly as a gracious person. One would not ordinarily apply that term to someone who was such a vigorous political opponent. I recall that on the first occasion on which I used that term about him in my electorate I was chided by my political supporters. But he was accessible to people from our side of the House who wanted to approach him as the Prime Minister or on some parliamentary matter and on such occasions he was gracious in dealing with the matters placed before him.\n\nI recall approaching him during a period in the development of Aboriginal advancement policies and asking him to see the Aboriginal people themselves so that they could discuss the matter with him, He agreed to do so. He concurred with the idea that their fares ought to be met. He met them in the Cabinet room and they had a lengthy discussion. I learnt a technique of politics from that. I saw on that day, for the first time, that he actually saw this as a matter in which he should deal with the people directly, in a personal, human way. That does not mean that he did not often deal with other matters in that way. In politics it is terribly important to remember that human issues can only be learned and discharged by actual human confrontation and consultation. So, on a day such as today people are inclined to remember all those acts of grace and those matters on which they concurred over the long period of association with him.\n\nThere is likely to be built up an aura of nostalgia about the period in which I entered this Parliament. It was a time of great tumult in Australian politics. I hope that when people remember the current period they will think of those who sit here today in a parliamentary sense in a similar way to the way in which they think of the people who were here when I came to office. I refer to people on the other side of the House such as Sir Robert Menzies himself, Sir Arthur\n\nFadden, Sir Eric Harrison and Mr Anthony, and to people on our side such as Dr Evatt, Arthur Calwell, Reg Pollard, Eddie Ward, Leslie Haylen and Allan Fraser. I consider them to have been men of great parliamentary stature. I hope that when people look back in 20 or 30 years’ time they will see that we had people of that stature.\n\nI would say that the evaluation of him from my side of politics would be that his contribution to the Australian scene was stability. He was a man with a conservative nature. His objective in politics was to continue the status quo with amendments. I would say from this side of the House- perhaps many of his friends from the other side would say it also- that the amendments to the status quo were driven on him, accepted and carried through, often as tentatively as possible. However, the point was made here this afternoon by someone on the opposite side of the chamber that at least he did expand the area of activities of this Parliament. He did that gradually but it happened. I suggest that some of the things which are happening now represent a reversal of that trend.\n\nWe need to remember, however, that his life was not one of total victories. He had lost touch with the Australian psyche when he left office in 1941. That was not a temporary situation; it was eight years before he came back into office. It should be remembered that in the great tumult of the early 1950s and the confrontation in the community over civil rights, and in particular over the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and so on, he locked horns with another very great Australian in Dr Evatt. On that particular issue Dr Evatt was the victor. But that is the way politics goes. Early in his political career I think Sir Robert was pretty ruthless in the pursuit of his aims. In later years, during my time in the Parliament, he mellowed. He was the master of the scene. He was a giant amongst his contemporaries, particularly those who sat on the same side of the House as he did. That is no reflection on those people because he was a long survivor.\n\nOn this occasion I recognise that the Menzies family has lost a person who must have meant an enormous amount in the family life. He meant a good deal in Australian life also. I think that one of the factors of our democracy is that we feel that even those who are on the side of politics different from our own, even those who in the political sense we hold in great contempt or hatred, are part of our own lives. So this afternoon I record my regret at the passing of a gracious Australian, a man who I think held more to stability than to progress. I think that is the way in which he will be registered in the record books. But he was a man who, whenever faced with a proposition at close quarters, would decide both on the side of justice and on the side of mercy. I think we should remember that one does not win much in the political scene in Australia unless one pursues one ‘s aims with persistence, and often with ruthlessness. I think they were characteristics which he had. But, as I say, they were tempered with acts of grace, whenever the occasion arose, in dealing with his colleagues. On afternoons such as this I heard him pay compliments and tributes to people about whom I could think of little to say.\n\nI know that these remarks will be passed on to his family, members of whom I know. I recall occasions when his grandchildren met him outside Parliament House. Those occasions gave one a different picture of the man in his family life. I recognise that on occasions such as this we make evaluations which are probably clouded more with nostalgia and regret than with objectivity; but I have no doubt that, even those who hold the political views that I do, which are in vigorous opposition to those he held, will still register their regard for those achievements of which we approve and even, in many cases, some of which we disapprove.\n\nMr GRAHAM:\n\nNorth Sydney\n\n-I shall take only a few moments of the time of the House in supporting the comments that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), and the other speakers who have made a contribution this afternoon. I was privileged in three parliaments- the nineteenth, the twentieth and the twenty-second parliaments, between 1949 and 1958- to sit in this place behind the former right honourable member for Kooyong, Robert Gordon Menzies. I agree with all of the comments that have been made because most of them have been made at the personal level, having regard to personal contacts. I felt that my contribution might be of a slightly more personal nature by my pointing out that, apart from his greatness, apart from his statesmanship, apart from those great qualities to which we have paid respect this afternoon, he was a very human person. He had a great sense of humour. He was not without some familiarity with personal physical suffering, and in his family life from time to time he was subjected to great stresses that were tragic in their nature. I say this because I know that these pressures had to be faced coincidentally with the great struggle to lead this nation of ours along the proper path. He also had to sustain his family. He had the support of that great lady, Dame Pattie, whom the great majority of people who have known her will always respect. I can say that over the many years since 1949 I have never heard one single word of criticism of that magnificent lady.\n\nAs I have said, the former Prime Minister was a man with a great sense of humour. He was a raconteur and after dinner speaker par excellence. On suitable occasions he could talk to members of the Parliament about great figures in other parliaments, such as Lord Birkenhead. He talked about cricketers with an affection that was unrivalled. In my judgment he understood so much about the game of cricket that one would believe that had it been possible for him to be a cricketer, he could have known distinction in that field.\n\nMr Speaker, I hope that you will convey my comments to Dame Pattie and to Sir Robert’s family. He lived to a great age, after all, from 1894 to 1978. It was with great satisfaction that he would have witnessed his own family growing up and expanding, the growth and the development of his grandchildren and his family embarking upon a road of distinction. I am happy that that is the case, and I am sure we all are.\n\nMr PEACOCK:\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs · Kooyong · LP\n\n– As the present member for Kooyong I naturally wish to be associated with the motion and to confirm again my sympathy to Dame Pattie and the Menzies family. Over the last week very many tributes have been paid to Sir Robert, both in Australia and overseas. It is worth remembering that had he not outlived most of his distinguished contemporaries there would have been even more tributes from eminent sources. Three of his outstanding characteristics in my view are worthy of particular mention. Firstly, I refer to his political courage, his willingness to take unpopular courses, to express unfashionable views and even to undertake tasks for which the chances of success were less than even, because he thought it was necessary and right. Secondly, I refer to the breadth of his political perspective. There have been few Australian politicians less parochial or less constricted by ideological blinkers. In international politics he brought Australia into a larger league, not stridently, not raucously, but with a realistic appreciation of how we could fit into such a larger scene. Thirdly, I refer to his respect for language in politics. By this I mean more than that he made great speeches. In his speaking, in his writing, in his thinking about politics Sir\n\nRobert was concerned to match words to substance, to mean what he said, to say what he meant, to respect his audience. In a world in which rhetoric threatens to become an end in itself, in which public relations threaten to displace substance and jargon constantly presses on good English, this is not a negligible virtue.\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon tradition I believe we have been taught to think of conservatism and liberalism as alternative and opposed positions. Sir Robert Menzies’ career is a salutory reminder that they are not necessarily so. He was certainly conservative, somebody who valued what was tried, tested and familiar. But what he wanted to conserve were essentially liberal values and liberal institutions. His commitment to those values was not doctrinal or theoretical; it was based on long experience and the fact that they had evolved gradually and were the products of a particular historical tradition. It was a fully earned commitment, immune to changing fashion and confident in itself. In substance, Sir Robert Menzies combined all the essential qualities of leadership: Courage, judgment, integrity and dedication. Such qualities are frequently found in part in other men; Sir Robert had the rare combination in full.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that there is a particular grief in the minds and hearts of the overwhelming majority of people who reside in the suburbs which make up the electorate of Kooyong. Constituents felt great pride in the fact that they were represented by Sir Robert Menzies. To many members of parliament that would be the highest accolade. On all occasions either when one was with him in that electorate or when one listened to the views that were expressed quoting him one felt great pride flowing through the constituents of his electorate. It is fair to say that he in turn felt great pride in representing them throughout his 32 years as their member.\n\nI shall always be in the debt of Sir Robert Menzies for his original interest in me when I was only a law student and standing as a condidate for the former seat of Yarra, which continued through the various positions I held as either President of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party or a member of this Parliament. It was of course an honour to know him, it was an honour to receive his advice, and it was an honour to follow him in this Parliament.\n\nMr FISHER:\n\nMallee\n\n-I rise to record a tribute on behalf of my constituents in the Mallee electorate to the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. On 20 December 1894, R. G. Menzies was born to his storekeeper parents, James and Kate Menzies in the rear of their shop in the small north-western Victorian town of Jeparit. Sir Robert’s years in Jeparit were spent attending primary school at the small rural school where even in those early years his schoolmates today remember his aggressiveness at play and his ability and eagerness to participate in public discussion and debate. The influence of his family in developing an interest in and finally an ambition for a political career must have been significant. His father was a president of the local shire and ultimately became a member of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, serving as the member for Lowan. One of his father’s brothers also served in that Parliament. Mr Sydney Sampson, who was his mother’s brother, also served from 1906 to 1919 as a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Wimmera, an electorate geographically identical to the electorate of Mallee that I now represent.\n\nSir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia during this nation’s period of greatest growth and development. Political commentators and historians may wish to argue the effects of his influence upon the factors in this period but no one can deny his capacity of intellect and ingenuity and his effect on administrative stability. In these matters he has not been surpassed in Australian politics. Sir Robert Menzies has had, and will have, many monuments erected in his honour. But the most enduring monuments and achievements, however, will not be represented in granite or by plaques. The development of Canberra as the nations capital and the extension of Commonwealth responsibility into the field of education, particularly at the tertiary level, must rank as enduring policy achievements.\n\nOn Tuesday, 16 May, the councillors and staff of the Dimboola Shire meeting that day in Jeparit adjourned to the Menzies memorial erected in 1966 by the community to honour this small town’s famous son. In a short ceremony the community of today recognised a man of stature who became a great national figure and a world statesman. It recognised a lifetime of public service and the loyalty and personal sacrifice of this great man’s wife and family. To Dame Pattie, her son and daughter and to Sir Robert’s 10 grandchildren, the people of the Mallee and the Wimmera express their sincere condolences.\n\nMr SHIPTON:\n\nHiggins\n\n-I speak today as the late Sir Robert Menzies’ local member and as one whose electorate now includes part of Sir Robert’s former electorate. Much attention has been given, and properly, to his role as Prime\n\nMinister and statesman, but I want to talk of his belief in the role of private members in this place. He had a passionate belief in the responsibility and the role of individual members of the House of Representatives. He regarded himself as a constituent, and felt that lus views, which were still strong and current, were no more important than anybody else’s views. That is the measure of the man. I am grateful for his interest in me as his local member. A man of his status and experience need not have taken an interest in the new local member but he did.\n\nHe had a great belief in this House. He was a child of it. He became a giant in it and we talk of his legend today. He was a humble person. There was a story in last Saturday’s Melbourne Sun by journalist Bruce Wilson who recalled getting Sir Robert’s autograph at the Windsor Hotel as a young man many years ago. I know of another story, that of a 12 year old girl who drove him up and down the elevator at the Windsor on two or three occasions, with an anxious mother waiting. That was the measure of the man again, that he would let this little girl take him up and down in the elevator. I know that story to be true for the girl is now my wife.\n\nHe had a continuing interest in current events, in the progress of Australia and the future of Australia. I am sorry to say that, whilst I agree with what most of the honourable member for Wills said, he was wrong in one regard: Sir Robert Menzies was still current. His thoughts were still current. His belief was in the future of Australia. But, whilst he had those views, he was not anxious to impose them on anybody; they were there for those who wished to benefit from them. His belief in this House lasted with him until the very end. When he had finished his day’s reading he listened to the broadcasts of this House. His interest in this place was paramount and with him to the very end. The spirit of Menzies was rekindled last week. Let us reflect in the weeks and months ahead and consider an appropriate national memorial or monument to him. Finally I refer to his family. In doing so Mr Speaker, I note that his daughter Heather and three of his grandchildren are in the gallery here today. It is not easy for the family of a public figure to share that public figure with the nation, but I thank Dame Pattie and his son Ken and daughter Heather for allowing the nation to share their sadness and to pay tribute to its famous son last Friday.\n\nMr CONNOLLY:\n\nBradfield\n\n-I wish to be associated with the Prime Minister’s motion of condolence on the death of Sir Robert Menzies and to express my deep sympathy to Dame\n\nPattie and to his family. I had the honour to meet Sir Robert for the first time when I, too, was 12 years old. Like most of my colleagues here I grew up during the Menzies era and he always remained for us the brightest star in the Australian firmament. While we can- in fact, mustleave history to judge his works and deeds, there can be no doubt that he has earned a lasting place in the hearts of the vast majority of the Australian people. Sir Robert walked in no man’s shadow. He was the quintessence of an outstanding national leader, a man of whom we could be and were immensely proud.\n\nLast Friday week in Sydney we inaugurated an oration, given by Lord Hailsham, in Sir Robert’s name. We wanted to do him due honour in the twilight of his life. We were not to know then how short the day would be, but happily Sir Robert did live to see that, 12 years after his retirement from public life, the people of Sydney had not forgotten him. He very kindly sent us as his representative his daughter Heather to be with us on that occasion.\n\nSir Robert Menzies loved poetry. As I searched for words to express my feelings adequately and to make a small contribution to his verbal epitaph on this occasion, I came upon these words, which I believe adequately express the essential characteristics of Robert Menzies, the man:\n\nHe has achieved success who: Has lived well, laughed often, and loved much, Who has gained the respect of intelligent men, the trust of women, and the love of little children, Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task, Who has left the world better than he found it, Who has never lacked appreciation for earth’s beauty nor failed to express it, Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had, Whose life was an inspiration, his memory a benediction.\n\nMr SHORT:\n\nBallarat\n\n-Mr Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Ballarat I wish to join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and other speakers in expressing our sadness at the passing of Sir Robert Menzies and extending to Dame Pattie Menzies and her family our deep sympathy on their loss. The citizens of Ballarat held a memorial service for Robert Gordon Menzies last Sunday evening in the church in which he worshipped as a boy. It was a fitting service for several reasons, but particularly because much of Robert Menzies’ formative years were closely linked with Ballarat and district, and throughout his entire life he continued a close association with and appreciation for the city. It is to this association that I would like to refer briefly today, because Robert Menzies’ grandfather settled in Ballarat on his migration from Dumfries in Scotland in 1855, and it was in Ballarat that Sir Robert’s father was born. His mother was also from the district. Her name was Kate Sampson. She was born in Creswick, a small town only 10 miles from Ballarat. Robert Menzies’ family lived in Ballarat for many years, his father being a coach painter at that time. His three elder brothers and sister were born there. His parents did not in fact move from Ballarat until about two years before his birth in 1894.\n\nSeveral of Robert Menzies’ early school years were spent in Ballarat. He attended Humphrey Street primary school, which still exists and which is only 200 yards from my electorate office. He then attended Grenville College before winning scholarships to Wesley College in Melbourne and from there to Melbourne University. While attending school in Ballarat he lived with his widowed grandmother in a small cottage in the centre of the city. Robert Menzies was in later years a very frequent visitor to Ballarat, a city of which he said ‘I always come to with pleasure and leave with reluctance’- a city of which in his book Afternoon Light he said ‘had many years ago developed a civic sense of beauty, the products of which are still notable ‘.\n\nI had the privilege of working within close range of Sir Robert Menzies during the final two years of his Prime Ministership, when I was private secretary at that time to his much-loved and loyal deputy, the late Harold Holt. Even though I was a young and very junior cog in the machine of government at that time, I shall always recall with great gratitude that Sir Robert Menzies still took the trouble to speak to me when he saw me. He was the same with all his own staff and with all those with whom he came into contact. In passing, on this occasion I would also like to extend my sympathy to Miss Hazel Craig who was a devoted secretary to Sir Robert Menzies over a very long period.\n\nWhilst mourning the passing of Sir Robert, I do not believe that this should be a time for grief; rather, I believe that this is a time for pride and for giving thanks. As a citizen of Ballarat, I take pride in the fact that Robert Menzies’ life was so closely linked with my city. As a citizen of our nation, I give thanks that we were blessed with having in our midst a man of such ability, wisdom and dedication to improving the well being of all the citizens of Australia. He was a man to whom all Australians will say ‘Thank you. We will not easily forget you because it is unlikely we will see a man of your stature in the fullest meaning of that term pass our way again for a very longtime’.\n\nMr Peter Johnson:\n\nBRISBANE, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n-I add my support to the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). The death of a truly great Australian is a rare event, and the death of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies is such an event. Australia has lost a great statesman. His family has lost a husband, father, father-in-law and grandfather. Many thousands of Australians have lost a true friend, and a number of present and former members of Parliament have lost a former colleague. As I look around this House, it is with the realisation that a significant number of members from both sides of the House grew up under the Prime Ministership of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. This wonderful man gave so much to Australia. The debt and gratitude that this nation owes are beyond measure. The most notable achievements included sound government after a terrible war, the rebuilding of Australia’s war torn industries and the development of Australia’s newly discovered riches.\n\nThe growing importance of Australia in a world context was assisted and guided by the steady, firm and sure hand of a man who had the vision and belief of what our potential as a nation and a people was. My gratitude for Sir Robert Gordon Menzies knows no bounds. I add my deepest sympathy and prayers to those offered to Dame Pattie Menzies and her family at this time of sorrow. I wish that my few words be added to those already spoken here today. I do this of my own volition and on behalf of the many people who reside in the federal division of Brisbane who knew and loved him.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-It is unusual for a Speaker to accord himself the privilege of speaking in the House, but I do so today on a rather special occasion, as we all know, to support this motion of condolence. I knew Sir Robert Menzies when I was a young candidate in Fremantle, aged 22. He went out of his way to enable me to speak to an audience which was larger than I had ever seen before, let alone spoken to. He encouraged me and won from me an admiration for hum which lasted his life. I spent time with him in Melbourne Scots, a very fine organisation I will have the House know and one which is dear to me. Other people feel as deeply about it, including leading politicians such as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of Victoria. They were very pleasant times for us all in the company of Sir Robert.\n\nIt was my privilege to serve in his last Ministry. He had the wisdom, some would say, or he made the mistake, others would say, of asking me to be his Attorney-General. He telephoned me and said: ‘Billy, would you be willing to be my Attorney-General?’ I hesitated for about a millionth of a second and answered yes. So I was able to serve him, learn from him and carry my admiration to new pupils. He was a great man in the Cabinet. He did not dominate it other than by his sheer intellectual capacity. He gave leadership in the Cabinet. He gave leadership to the Ministers and the Parliament. Outside the Cabinet room, the ante-room was a place to which Ministers liked to go and hear from him the lore of the Parliament. Much was to be learnt there from him, for he was a great parliamentarian. This chamber had a deep significance to him in the constitutional sense, in the political sense and in the national sense. It was here that he was at his best, He recognised the importance of the institution of Parliament for the maintenance of the political stability of the nation, and he contributed to the development of this Parliament in a way which all of us might emulate.\n\nAs a parliamentarian, he deserves our thanks and appreciation. He deserves that thanks and appreciation as a national statesman. As human beings, we might remember that the greatest achievement that Australia had was during the 1950s when we evolved social standards, industrial standards and achievement standards of a kind that we had not known for a century. One needs to go back in history 100 years to the decade of the fifties of the last century and the great gold rush to find any comparable period of growth and development of the nation. In the 1950s, under his leadership, the foundation which will carry us through into a great nation of the next century was built. So much of this is due to him and his understanding of the need for Australia’s social patterns to expand, diversify and to be enriched by the great migrant flow that came to this country under his national leadership.\n\nI had the privilege also to know his wife, Dame Pattie, a very dear lady and one who can give the same example to the wives of parliamentarians that Sir Robert Menzies himself gave to members of Parliament. I support the motion. I ask that honourable members show their approval of the motion by standing in their places.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.\n\npage 2340\n\nQUESTION\n\nSIR ROBERT MENZIES MEMORIAL TRUST\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– by leave- The question has arisen as to the way in which, as a nation, we might best mark and commemorate, now and for posterity, the great contribution of the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies to the nation. There has already been enthusiastic and helpful discussion on this by some public figures and by some newspapers, and I am indebted to them. A preparatory committee has already begun work, directed to the creation of a special appeal and fund to be known as the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Trust, and I am happy to announce to the House the general direction and scope of the arrangements that are in mind.\n\nThe appeal will be established on an Australia-wide basis, and the funds resulting will be applied to objectives of a practical and continuing kind within the particular interests of Sir Robert Menzies. He had no static view of Australia and he would wish, as those who contribute will, that the funds should be spent in terms of future benefit to Australia. The objectives are still to be finally determined, but it can be said already that the fund will be designed to assist Australians of all ages- but especially the young- to obtain in serious and worthwhile directions, academic training or practical experience or opportunities to compete which they might otherwise be unable to obtain.\n\nSome of the particular interests identified with Sir Robert Menzies and which might therefore be drawn within the purposes of the fund are the law, with particular reference to constitutional matters and Federal-State relationships, studies concerned with Australia ‘s role within the British Commonwealth and with Australia-Britain relations; studies of Australia and the United States; studies of relations between Australia and the Pacific nations. Another possibility which would have been of interest to Sir Robert Menzies and from which major benefit would accrue is to bring to Australia for public meetings or special consultations, speakers of distinction or young persons of promise and interest to us.\n\nThere are two other matters at least, one is the development of skills in the use of the English language, since we all know he loved the English tongue. The other is sport of many kinds because as he watched it and took interest, it gave him a particular and agreeable relaxation and companionship.\n\nAlthough much more discussion will be needed, I am able to say now that the appeal and the fund will be under the authority of a national committee and a series of State committees.\n\nIt is my honour to have been asked to accept the office of National President. Leading Australians will be invited to accept office with me in connection with the Trust. It will be necessary, in addition, to have a strong and operative executive national committee and a series of State executive committees.\n\nI am pleased to announce that Sir William Vines has accepted office as head of the national committee with the title of National General Chairman. Sir William Vines has a high record of achievement in Australian commercial and agricultural communities and of service to government, both Commonwealth and State, involving all political parties over a long period. He will be assisted as Deputy National General Chairman by Sir Walter Leonard.\n\nThe other members of the Executive Committee will be similarly distinguished people, representative of the States as well as the Commonwealth, and, it is hoped, from a variety of callings and backgrounds. To assist this Committee, a distinguished public servant and close confidant of Sir Robert’s for many years- Sir John Bunting- will be co-ordinator.\n\nSir Robert Menzies was the leader of one political party. But he was, at the same time, a representative and a leader of all the people. He sought to serve the whole community- as the fund now in mind will do and in fact must do.\n\npage 2341\n\nADJOURNMENT\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– I suggest that the House do now adjourn.\n\nHouse adjourned at 3.47 p.m.\n\npage 2342\n\nANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE\n\nThe following answers to questions upon notice were circulated:\n\nAdvertising (Question No. 29)\n\nMr Les Johnson:\n\nHUGHES, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 22 February 1978:\n\n1 ) What sum was spent by his Department on advertising and services during the period (a) 1 1 November 1975 to 13 December 1975; (b) 14 December 1975 to 30 June 1976; (c) 1 July 1 976 to 30 June 1 977; and (d ) 1 July 1 977 to date.\n\nWhat was the cost of each campaign undertaken.\n\nUnder which item of expenditure were funds allocated.\n\nWhich advertising agencies or consultants were used for each campaign.\n\nWhat was the total sum paid to each agency or consultant for each campaign.\n\n) How was each agency or consultant selected.\n\nWhat is the estimated cost of advertising and promotion of Government programs and services for1 977-78.\n\nMr Street:\n\nMinister for Employment and Industrial Relations · CORANGAMITE, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n1 ) The sums spent by the Department on advertising and services during the periods in question were-\n\n) The cost of each campaign undertaken was-\n\nFunds for all Departmental advertising have been allocated from the Department’s information services vote.\n\nand (5) In view of the amount of advertising placed and the time involved in extracting and preparing information for the numerous campaigns, I suggest that the honourable member contact the Director, Information Services of my Department, if he has a question on any specific campaign.\n\nAll advertising was placed through the Australian Government Advertising Service or their nominated agencies as directed in Finance Circular 74/ 1 7.\n\nDepartmental advertising, marketing the CES and the Government’s manpower training programs to employers, is estimated to cost $ 1 , 423,000 for 1 977-78.\n\nAntarctic Marine Living Resources (Question No. 116)\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\nam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 February 1978:\n\nHas Australia been in touch with any countries that are not parties to the Antarctic Treaty concerning the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources pending the entry into force of the definitive regime for their conservation recommended by the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London (2 9 September-7 October 1977).\n\nMr Peacock:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nMany countries have expressed their interest in the general question of the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. Australia has been involved in some multilateral discussions about this, especially in the context of the Food and Agricultural Organisation.\n\nHowever, the definitive regime which the honourable member refers to is presently being negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. It was agreed at the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London last year that a Special Consultative Meeting be convened in order to elaborate a draft definitive regime. This meeting began its work in Canberra from 27 February-16 March. It will continue its task in Buenos Aires in July. Our discussions on the regime for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources have consequently been confined to the Antartic Treaty Consultative Parties.\n\nElectoral: Allocation of Radio and Television Time to Political Parties- Northern Territory (Question No. 164)\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nam asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 22 February 1978:\n\n1 ) How much time was made available to broadcast election speeches or political advertisements in respect of each political party on each radio broadcasting station and television station in connection with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election on 1 3 August 1977.\n\nWhat was the percentage distribution of time purchased by parties and candidates on those broadcasting and television stations.\n\nWhat were the costs charged for this time and what was the percentage distribution of these costs between parties and candidates.\n\nMr Staley:\n\nMinister for Post and Telecommunications · CHISHOLM, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nOn the basis of information provided to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by licensees of commercial broadcasting and television stations, and by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the following tables have been prepared to show the details requested under parts ( 1 ), (2 ) and (3) of the question. These tables show details of radio and television broadcasts of election speeches and political advertisements for the period 14 July 1977 (date of issue of writs) to 13 August 1977.\n\nElectoral: Allocation of Radio and Television Time to Political Parties -South Australia (Question No. 165)\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nam asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 22 February 1978:\n\n1 ) How much time was made available to broadcast election speeches or political advertisements in respect of each political party on each radio broadcasting station and tele vision station in connection with the State election in South Australia on 1 7 September 1 977.\n\nWhat was the percentage distribution of time purchased by parties and candidates on metropolitan and country commercial broadcasting and television stations.\n\nWhat were the costs charged for this time, and what was the percentage distribution of these costs between parties and candidates.\n\nMr Staley:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nOn the basis of information provided to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by licensees of commercial broadcasting and television stations, and by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the following tables have been prepared to show the details requested under parts ( 1 ), (2) and\n\nof the question. These tables show details of radio and television broadcasts of election speeches and political advertisements for the period 25 August 1977 (date of issue of writs) to 14 September 1977.\n\n) Time purchased by parties and candidates\n\nShortage of Skilled Labour (Question No. 236)\n\nMr Willis:\n\nGELLIBRAND, VICTORIA\n\nasked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 1 March 1978:\n\n1 ) To which occupations does Statement No. 2, page 10, of the Budget Papers for 1977-78 refer in noting that despite the high overall incidence of unemployment, labour is reported in short supply in a number of skilled occupations.\n\n2 ) What action is being taken to end these shortages.\n\nMr Street:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n1 ) Labour is in short supply in a number of skilled occupations. However, these shortages are distributed over a number of locations. The skilled metal and electrical occupations are those most affected. Details of the occupations in which there are shortages are provided in the Department of\n\nEmployment and Industrial Relations’ publication ‘Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation’, February 1978.\n\nAction to overcome the shortages is being taken through the immigration program, a number of training programs, including CRAFT, and initiatives taken by the Government to increase resources for technical education.\n\nUnemployment Figures: Seasonal Adjustment (Question No. 237)\n\nMr Willis:\n\nasked the Treasurer upon notice, on 1 March 1978:\n\n1 ) In view of the statement by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations that the peak in unemployment at the end of January 1978 was higher than anticipated, does he still adhere to his statement reported in the Financial Review of 24 January 1978 that unemployment will start falling in seasonally adjusted terms this year.\n\nAs seasonally adjusted employment figures are no longer published, how will he or anyone else know if seasonally adjusted unemployment is falling or rising.\n\nAre seasonally adjusted unemployment figures compiled although not published; if so, does he intend to recommence their publication in the near future.\n\nMr Howard:\n\nTreasurer · BENNELONG, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n1 ) As stated in the recent Commonwealth Submission to the National Wage Case the Government’s view is that expansion of employment may well gather sufficient momentum to bring about a stabilisation and then a gradual reduction in the underlying level of unemployment as 1978 progresses.\n\nSeasonally adjusted employment figures are published by the Statistician.\n\nThe Statistician is keeping the matter of seasonal adjustment of the survey unemployment series under review. I refer the honourable member to the Statistician’s latest release on survey unemployment for a discussion of the problems in the seasonal adjustment of the series.\n\nAttorney-General’s Department; Expenditure on Travel and Subsistence (Question No. 271)\n\nMr Morris:\n\nSHORTLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\nasked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 March 1978:\n\n1 ) What amounts of travel and subsistence expenditure of the Attorney-General’s Department were spent on (a) overseas and (b) domestic travel during 1 976-77.\n\nWhat percentage of total expenditure on travel and subsistence did each of these amounts represent.\n\nDid this question first appear on the Notice Paper of5 October 1977 as Question No. 1657 and remain unanswered at the dissolution of the last Parliament.\n\nMr Viner:\n\nMinister Assisting the Prime Minister · STIRLING, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:\n\n1 ) The amounts expended on fares and travelling allowances excluding car hire in 1 976-77 are set out below.\n\nOverseas travel, $82,926.\n\nb ) Domestic travel, $1,1 54,039.\n\nThe percentages of the Department’s expenditure on travel and subsistence, excluding car hire, were:\n\nOverseas, 6.7 per cent.\n\nDomestic, 93.3 per cent.\n\nYes.\n\nAttorney-General’s Department: Domestic Air Travel (Question No. 460)\n\nMr Bungey:\n\nCANNING, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\nasked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 March 1978:\n\nWhat sum was paid by the Attorney-General’s Department or by Departments formerly encompassing the functions now performed by the Attorney-General’s Department, to each airline for air travel within Australian during 1976-77.\n\nMr Viner:\n\nLP\n\n– The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:\n\nPurchase of Newspapers and Publications (Question No. 483)\n\nMr Bungey:\n\nasked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978:\n\n1 ) How many copies of (a) each daily newspaper and (b) each weekly publication are purchased by (i) the Head Office and (ii) other offices of his Department.\n\nWhat was the cost of these purchases during 1976-77 .\n\nMr MacKellar:\n\nMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs · WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nI refer the honourable member to the answer given by the Prime Minister to Question No. 468 (Hansard, 4 April 1978, page 978).\n\nPurchase of Newspapers and Publications (Question No. 493)\n\nMr Bungey:\n\nasked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978:\n\n1 ) How many copies of (a) each daily newspaper and (b) each weekly publication are purchased by (i) the Head Office and (ii) other offices of his Department.\n\nWhat was the cost of these purchases during 1976-1977.\n\nMr Garland:\n\nMinister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources · CURTIN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nI refer the honourable member to the Prime Minister’s answer to Question No. 468 (Hansard, 4 April 1978, page 978).\n\nGovernment Offices: Tea Making and Distribution (Question No. 519)\n\nMr Bungey:\n\nasked the Minister for Productivity, upon notice, on 8 March 1978:\n\nHow many (a) full-time and (b) part-time staff are employed on tea-making and distribution in (i) the Head Office and (ii) other offices of his Department .\n\nWhat was the cost in 1976-77 of (i) salaries and (ii) other charges in the provision of tea services in his Department.\n\nMr Macphee:\n\nMinister for Productivity · BALACLAVA, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n(i) Cost in 1976-77 of salaries: $1 18,644 (Head Office $69,358, Other Offices $49,286).\n\nCost in 1976-77 of other charges in provision of tea services: Nil (Recoverable from consumers).\n\nNuclear Reactor (Question No. 597)\n\nMr Les Johnson:\n\nHUGHES, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 9 March 1978:\n\nAre there any plans by the Government to:\n\nde-commission the HIFAR reactor and\n\nconstruct another reactor at the Australian Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Lucas Heights; if so, when will the Parliament be provided with full details of the plans including an estimate of the costs involved.\n\nMr Newman:\n\nMinister for National Development · BASS, TASMANIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nand (b) There are no plans to de-commission the HIFAR reactor. The Government has however authorised the AAEC to commence a design-cost study for a new isotope production and research reactor to replace the HIFAR reactor. Such a reactor, if approved, would not be operational before the mid-1980s. No estimate of the cost and time-table of the project will be available until the design study has been completed in about 1 980-8 1 .\n\nDefence Projects (Question No. 604)\n\nMr Les Johnson:\n\nHUGHES, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 March 1 978:\n\nHas the Government given approval to any work or undertaking which would require the application of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947; if so (a) what are the works and undertakings and (b) when was approval given for each.\n\nMr Killen:\n\nMinister for Defence · MORETON, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\nThe Government has not given approval for any work or undertaking which would require the application of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947.\n\nAustralian Broadcasting Commission: Short Term Employment (Question No. 667)\n\nDr Cass:\n\nMARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA\n\nasked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 15 March 1978:\n\n1 ) What outside contract labour has been used by the Australian Broadcasting Commission during the last 2 years.\n\n) What has been the cost to the Commission of hiring this labour in each of those years.\n\nMr Staley:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n1 ) The ABC regularly employs on contract or other formal short-term engagement, a wide range of talent including actors, actresses, musicians, writers, production staff, news and public affairs correspondents and cinecameramen.\n\n1975-76-$6, 124,000; 1976-77-$5,5 17,000.\n\nReopening of Diplomatic Missions (Question No. 709)\n\nMr Hurford:\n\nADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\nasked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 March 1978:\n\n1 ) On what important national grounds did he seek the reopening of the Embassy to UNESCO in Paris and the Consulates at Los Angeles and Bombay (Hansard, 2 March 1978, pages 347 and 348).\n\n) Will he table a copy of his letter to the Prime Minister recommending the reopening of those 3 posts; if not, why not, and will he outline the relevant facts given in that letter.\n\nDid his Department include any arguments advocating the reopenings in its submission to the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee prior to that Committee reporting on overseas representation in May 1 977; if not. why not.\n\nWhat have been the costs incurred in closing the 3 posts in the last 2 years and what are the estimated costs of the reopenings.\n\nHas his attention been drawn to a report estimating that the cost of reopening the Consulates is $440,000; if so, is there any substance in this report and what is the cost involved.\n\nHas his attention also been drawn to a report that one of the costs of the reopening of the Embassy to UNESCO was the removal of the furniture chosen by the architect from the Ambassador’s residence and its replacement by the then prospective Ambassador’s personal furniture; if so, is there any substance in this report and what was the cost involved.\n\nMr Peacock:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:\n\n1 ) Bombay- Our relations with India in all fields have developed since 1976 and, during the recent visit of the Prime Minister of India, the Australian Government confirmed its interest in continuing to develop ties with India.\n\nConsular, commercial and immigration activities from the areas formerly handled by the post in Bombay, have all increased since its closure in 1976. In addition, we have a major continuing commitment to aid programs in India which require administrative support. Bombay is the major Indian city apart from the capital, New Delhi, its major commercial centre and a regular port of call for Qantas services to and from Australia. Qantas has three eastward and three westward flights a week to and from Bombay, and the number of Australians travelling through has increased quite dramatically.\n\nReopening a Consulate-General in Bombay will provide a valuable second channel for representation and contact with Indian regional authorities and important business interests, constitute an additional consular facility for Austalian travellers, and facilitate handling of migration matters in the area.\n\nLos Angeles- Since the Consulate-General was closed in June 1976, the expansion of Australian consular, trade, information and general political activities in the United States has meant that the Consulates-General at San Francisco and Chicago which took over the areas previously handled from Los Angeles have borne a disproportionate responsibility which is now judged handled better on the spot.\n\nIn 1976, Southern California’s trade totalled$US17.3 billion (about the same as Australia’s total trade) and 66 per cent of it was with Asia from where we face intensive and growing competition which needs to be met.\n\nThe problems associated with obtaining visas by mail from San Francisco have had some impact on our tourist potential in Southern California. The additional burden on the Australian Tourist Commission in Los Angeles needs to be relieved. At present, about 4,700 seats are available each week on flights from Los Angeles to Australia. Australian tourism to the United States (with associated consular work) is expected to increase dramatically in the next few years.\n\nA major world exposition is to be held at Los Angeles in 1 98 1 in which Australia will need to participate if it intends to bid for the venue of Expo 88. An office of substantial status will need to be established at Los Angeles well before 1981 to provide preliminary facilities for the Australian Exhibit Organisation.\n\nUNESCO- UNESCO is a major international organisation with more than 140 member governments and significant activities in almost every field of education, science, the social sciences, culture, communications and development. The scope of UNESCO’s programs has been steadily increasing and the extent of our own involvement in these programs has widened significantly, particularly in the Asian and Pacific region. The appointment of a full-time Ambassador will assist Australia ‘s contribution to the development of UNESCO’s future programs and help ensure that our own growing interests in these programs are reflected in them. UNESCO is the most politically sensitive of the UN Specialised Agencies and the political aspects of Australia ‘s role in the Organisation have assumed increased importance. It is appropriate that this and the other factors noted above should be recognised by the appointment of a full-time Ambassador to UNESCO.\n\nOn the withdrawal of the previous full-time Ambassador to UNESCO late in 1976 his functions reverted to the Ambassador to France.\n\nSince that time significant areas of consultation and cooperation have opened up between Australia and France and continue to develop steadily, including our relationship with the European Communities, nuclear matters, cultural relations, defence exchanges and our interests in the South Pacific, Antarctica, the Middle East and Indochina. As a result, the Ambassador to France cannot without prejudice to his principal functions give to UNESCO the attention that its importance in the international community and its significance to Australia deserve.\n\nNo. My letter to the Prime Minist"
