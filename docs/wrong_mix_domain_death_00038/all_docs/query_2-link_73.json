        "text": "Howard on Menzies\n\nJohn Howard wants to \"set the record straight\" about the way his political hero Robert Menzies shaped modern Australia. He says Menzies' approach to migration, trade and the middle class revolutionised the nation, and he's invited the likes of Bob Hawke and Clive James to challenge his belief.\n\nThe 'great middle class'\n\nPaul Keating once told parliament that Robert Menzies put the country \"into neutral\" during the 1950s, but John Howard says that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\n\"No other Australian prime minister met and navigated such a range of challenges as did Bob Menzies,\" says Mr Howard of the man who won eight elections and led the nation for 16 consecutive years.\n\nMr Howard says Menzies successfully steered large migrant intakes, expanded trade opportunities and gave Australians a taste of the \"good life\" â€” often against a backdrop of war.\n\nHe credits Menzies, a driving force behind the creation of the Liberal Party, with redefining politics as a fight for the hearts of ordinary Australians, rather than a battle to win over unions and those at the top end of town.\n\n\"Menzies... created the great middle class that we still have in Australia and that we must hang on to for dear life if we are to preserve the stability and harmony and fairness that we prize as being a distinguishing characteristic of the Australian nation,\" Mr Howard says.\n\nBut Menzies' legacy is often disputed, and Mr Howard believes it's been overshadowed by the era of Labor's Gough Whitlam.\n\nFifty years since Menzies stepped down, Mr Howard is out to prove his predecessor deserves more credit, examining his career and legacy in a two-part documentary to premiere on the ABC tonight.\n\nThe Liberal Party stalwart draws on his own recollections and research, and also turns interviewer to talk Menzies with dozens of historians, academics, journalists, creatives and former politicians from the left and right.\n\n\"Having been interviewed all my life, it was a fascinating and entirely new experience to be interviewing others. Exciting and enjoyable,\" Mr Howard says.\n\nEnormous legacy or 'deadly dullness'?\n\nFormer Liberal leader Alexander Downer is among those who see the fiercely contested Menzies era in the same light as Mr Howard.\n\n\"The thing about Menzies is that he carried the country through a huge transition,\" Mr Downer tells Mr Howard.\n\n\"Through changes that were gradually, cautiously, made to the economy to allow a flourishing, if you like, of middle-class Australia. Things that people take for granted, like the growth of home ownership in Australia.\"\n\nJournalist Paul Kelly says Menzies' achievement in forming the Liberal Party was \"absolutely fundamental\".\n\n\"He gave those opposed to Labor, of a liberal and conservative disposition, an enduring political vehicle to support. The scale of that achievement is simply enormous,\" he says.\n\nBut others describe Menzies' rule as a period of stagnation and of racial and gender inequality.\n\n\"A little bit of deadly dullness was probably welcome after World War II, you know,\" author Clive James tells Mr Howard.\n\nAuthor Thomas Keneally, speaking about the 1950s, says: \"It is true that people looking back at that time used the word Menzian as a synonym for antiquated, out of touch.\"\n\nAsked for his memories of the Menzies years, former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke says: \"Basically, they were too long.\"\n\nHe rounds on Menzies for overplaying the politics in his anti-Communist platform, and charges him with making a \"massive mistake in committing Australia to Vietnam\".\n\n\"I think this is one of the real tragedies of our time. Over 500 fine Australian men dead,\" Mr Hawke says.\n\nThe sting of rejection\n\nMr Howard was 24 when he met Mr Menzies for the first and only time, at a cocktail party at The Lodge in 1964.\n\n\"He dominated the room metaphorically, physically and in every other way,\" Mr Howard recalls.\n\n\"To borrow from Shakespeare, he like a Colossus bestrode every scene.\"\n\nAt the time, Menzies was coming to the end of his time as leader â€” a journey that had begun decades earlier.\n\nMenzies, then the head of the United Australia Party, was named the nation's 12th prime minister in 1939, after Joe Lyons died in office.\n\nHe scraped in to govern in his own right in 1940 but stepped down the next year, having lost the support of his colleagues. The sting of rejection he felt is familiar to Mr Howard.\n\n\"I never seriously entertained quitting because I was still very committed to public life and I suppose, in the back of my mind, I thought there may be a way back,\" says Mr Howard, of being replaced in the wake of the Liberals' 1987 election loss.\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who also knows the pain of being ousted as party leader, says Menzies \"had to pull himself out of a very dark place\" after the events of 1941.\n\n\"He lost the prime ministership at a time when he was the leader of a nation at war â€” he was rubbing shoulders with the people that were reshaping the history of the world and suddenly he became relatively a political nobody,\" he says.\n\n'An extraordinary political resurrection'\n\nMr Turnbull and Mr Howard both fought their way back into power â€” just as Menzies did before them.\n\nIn 1949, four years after the Liberal Party launched with Menzies at its helm, he became prime minister again, in what Mr Howard describes as \"an extraordinary political resurrection\".\n\nA monarchist who was labelled \"British to his bootstraps\", Menzies would go on to win the next seven elections.\n\nIn total he served 18 years as prime minister, a reign that remains unbeaten in Australian politics.\n\nUnder his leadership industry blossomed and levels of home ownership rose amid unprecedented prosperity. Millions of \"new Australians\" arrived, yet unemployment was practically non-existent.\n\nThe ANZUS and SEATO treaties were signed, Australian troops were sent to fight with US-led forces in Korea, and Australia made its first commitment of combat troops to Vietnam.\n\nMenzies narrowly lost a referendum to outlaw communism, but capitalised on the fear surrounding the issue.\n\nThe Suez Crisis of 1956 proved a setback for Menzies, while his Japanese trade deal and support for the Vietnam War also attracted criticism.\n\nBut he held power until he resigned on his own terms in 1966.\n\nMastering the game of politics\n\nThree decades later, Mr Howard was elected prime minister â€” a role he held for a length of time second only to Menzies.\n\nEchoes of Menzies can be seen in Mr Howard's approach to leadership and vote-wooing â€” his iconic appeals to the \"battlers\" of Australia bear the hallmarks of Menzies' famous Forgotten People speeches.\n\n\"The instinct to give them a chance in life is a noble instinct, not to make them leaners but lifters,\" Menzies once said of the middle class.\n\nThe continuing ripple effect of Menzies' legacy isn't lost on today's politicians.\n\n\"You learned from Menzies, and I've learned from you,\" Mr Turnbull tells Mr Howard.\n\nIn the documentary Mr Howard also gives insights into how the often ruthless game of politics unfolds â€” and how to master it.\n\n\"The most important thing is to have a very good, candid relationship with the cabinet and the parliamentary party,\" Mr Howard says.\n\n\"You're not a president, you're not a dictator, you're not a monarch. You are the first amongst equals. The others have to respect your primacy but you must respect their equality.\""
