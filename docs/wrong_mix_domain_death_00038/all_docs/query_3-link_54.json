The rise of the Liberal Party arguably shaped the modern labour movement as much as it impacted contemporary Australian liberalism. However, the Labor and Liberal parties are currently experiencing record low proportions of the primary vote as well as declining membership numbers. This has led, in part, to incursions by minor parties and independents into electorates historically held by Labor and the Coalition.\n\nGiven these conditions it is timely to examine how the Labor and Liberal parties arrived at this position and how they might go about reversing what could be terminal trends. This gathering will be an important health check on the dominant two-party system and a moment to reflect on the structural integrity of Australan democracy at a pivotal time.\n\nYou are warmly invited to join us for the Robert Menzies Institute 2024 Oration and Dinner\n\non Wednesday 23rd October 2024\n\nat the Park Hyatt 1 Parliament Square Melbourne 3002 from 6:30pm - 10.30pm\n\n90 years ago, when the West was mired in the depths of the Great Depression and assailed by the competition of fascism and communism, Robert Menzies posed the question 'Is Democracy Doomed?' in an ABC radio broadcast. Today the nature of the West's ailments may have changed, but the question is no less pertinent.\n\nJoin us as we hear from one of the world’s foremost historians Sir Niall Ferguson, MA, DPhil, FRSE on whether Democracy is Doomed.\n\nABOUT SIR NIALL FERGUSON Sir Niall Ferguson, MA, DPhil, FRSE, is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a senior faculty fellow of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. He is the author of 16 books, including The Great Degeneration: How Institutions Decay and Economies Die, The Pity of War, The House of Rothschild, Empire, Civilization and Kissinger, 1923-1968: The Idealist, which won the Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross Prize. In 2020 he joined Bloomberg Opinion as a columnist. In addition, he is the founder and managing director of Greenmantle, a New York-based advisory firm, a co-founder of the Latin American fin tech company Ualá, and a co-founder of the new University of Austin.\n\nABOUT THE DINNER The tickets include canapes commencing at 6.30pm followed by a 3 course meal with drinks included in the Ballroom of the Park Hyatt.\n\nTICKET AND BOOKING INFORMATION There are a range of ticket options for this event.\n\nINDIVIDUAL TICKETS There is an Early Bird Special available until Thursday 1st August 2024.
