        "text": "May I ask you to join me in drinking a toast to Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends:\n\nThis is a delightful and very happy and heartwarming occasion for me today. It is one to which I have looked forward with great anticipation.\n\nWe here in Washington know our guest as a good and great friend of America. I hope that Sir Robert and all of his countrymen know equally well that the President is both an old and good friend of Australia and a very great admirer of the Australian people.\n\nAs many of my personal friends and associates have heard me say through the years, I lost at least a part of my heart to the Australian people a long time ago. I will never forget their warmth when I was stationed there in the early and anxious days of the war in the Pacific, and just to illustrate why our guest of honor has been Prime Minister for 17 years and why he has been an astute and expert parliamentarian for more than 35 years, before we came downstairs I was telling him of the graciousness of a great lady whose name I could not remember, but with a very slight description of her qualities and her assistance to me during the early days of the war, the Prime Minister, without any difficulty, called her name and located her and brought back to my memory many other good things about her.\n\nI long for the day to come, and hope it can come between now and November, when I will have my constituency as well in hand and know them as well as he does.\n\nSome of you may be familiar with the accounts of one episode that occurred when the plane in which I was riding as a member of the Navy was forced to land away from our base. Several writers later filed stories that my contacts with the Australians in the area indicated that I might have had a promising political future down under. I can only say that in considering his extraordinary success for many years, the Prime Minister obviously has much to teach the elective officials in America, and I am so proud that I have been privileged to sit and visit with him and to learn from him.\n\nWe are grateful, sir, that you honor us with this visit this year. We remember with particular favor your visit to our country last year when you sat here at this chair by the side of our beloved President John Kennedy. At that time you made a statement which I think expresses so well the feelings between our lands. Then you said, \"We work for the same kind of free world.\"\n\nIn the geography of freedom, all areas and all corners and all regions of the free world are important, and they are all vital. For us here in the United States it has been a source of great strength to know that there stands a nation so dedicated to freedom's defense as Australia.\n\nI don't know when a news announcement has given our country more comfort or been received with greater satisfaction than the announcement made last week by your Minister of External Affairs considering the additional contribution that the people of Australia were ready and anxious to make to contribute men and materials and equipment along the side of our men who are now fighting for freedom in South Viet-Nam.\n\nSo we are proud and we are very grateful, Mr. Prime Minister, to have you stand by our side. We are glad to have you stand with us as members of ANZUS. We are happy to work with you in the United Nations. We are assured to know that you are with us wherever freedom is in danger.\n\nAustralia and the United States do really, truly, as you say, work for the same kind of free world. I am sure that brief as your visit now must be, this friendly meeting will help us to work together in even closer understanding. I am grateful that you have come here. Our discussions have been fruitful. Our understanding has been improved. My desire to return your visit has increased, if that is possible.\n\nSo to my good friends who have assembled here with us today in this house, I should like to ask you to join with me in a toast to Sir Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia, and to the enduring bonds of friendship and freedom between our lands. Mr. Prime Minister."
