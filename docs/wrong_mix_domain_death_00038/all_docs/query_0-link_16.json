        "text": "Welcome Back Formal Dinner 🌼🌎 With about 70 new residents, last night was a great way to begin semester 2! We shared in a delicious meal, listened to Tyrone’s amazing performance and were encouraged by artist Ian McGilvary (a previous RMC board member) on being intentional with noticing how to see and learn from others around us! What an incredible night organised by many RMC staff and residents ⚡️ #universitycommunity #livingatuniversity #uniaccomodation #rmclife\n\nCongratulations RMC on the amazing results from semester 1 🤩 The average marks have improved from 67.7% in 2023 to 69.5% this year! These unit results are some of the benefits of living in a supportive environment right next to the university campus. We are thankful to our academic tutors for their time, effort and ongoing work across the semester in assisting residents at the college. #macquarie #macquarieuniversity #livingatuniversity #academictutors\n\nIt is always a privilege to host BlueSky Education who regularly stay onsite at RMC during their time here in Australia. Bluesky Global CEO, Andy Ton and CFO Akihiro Suzuki visited Australia recently, and we had the honour of sharing a wonderful lunch with them and touring them around RMC.

We’re totally blessed to have such a great team to work alongside and are very thankful for all that they do for the RMC community 🙌 here’s to the next 6 month! #rmclife #bestteam #uni\n\nArt Enthusiasts Alert! 🎨✨ Master Peter Davis recently visited the Wollongong Art Gallery to admire the stunning woven tapestry by Diana Wood Conroy.
