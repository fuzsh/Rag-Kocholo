        "text": "Scottish: variant of Manners , in which the z was originally the Middle English letter Ê (yogh), representing a sound similar to modern English y. The surname is pronounced Meenyus or Minyas in Scotland. The name was brought to Scotland in the 12th or 13th century by a family of Norman knights. It appears that the name was re-interpreted in Gaelic as containing a personal name, and for variants ending -s there is a possibility of confusion with McManus . See also McMinn ."
