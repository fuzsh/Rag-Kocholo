        "text": "Working in the Prime Minister's Office\n\nPrime Minister Menzies inspired loyalty and respect from his personal staff and his 'kindness and good humour encircled and captivated those who served him most closely.’ 3\n\nN C Tritton, Private Secretary\n\nMr N C Tritton served as Private Secretary to Prime Minister Menzies, handling departmental matters and correspondence. Mr Tritton and Assistant Private Secretary Mr S Landau accompanied the Prime Minister on his overseas journey in the first half of 1941. Ensuring the travel arrangements went smoothly and communications were maintained was all part of the job and the accompanying staff were 'more than up to our eyes in work'. 4\n\nMr Tritton left the post in May 1941, when the Prime Minister granted him leave to take up a postion with the British Broadcasting Commission:\n\nTritton has been offered an appointment by the BBC as Pacific Intelligence Officer. As he would be able to do valuable work for Australia in this capacity it appears to me that we should second him to the B.B.C. for this purpose. 5\n\nEileen Lenihan, Secretary\n\nEileen Lenihan was private secretary to Prime Minister Joseph Lyons and continued working as confidential personal secretary to Robert Menzies during his prime ministership. ‘Lennie’ developed a great admiration for her boss and a thorough understanding of his work patterns - she ‘knew his ways’. 6\n\nAs a stenographer, she had to take minutes of meetings such as those between the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and all the Chiefs of Staff. Unlike Hansard staff, who rotated every ten minutes, she would go in and ‘take shorthand verbatim right through until midnight' and would come out with her hands ‘just stiff’. 7\n\nAs well, there were sometimes 'other duties as required'. These included liaising occasionally with Mrs Menzies regarding employment of staff at The Lodge. In July 1941, Miss Lenihan wrote to the Secretary, Department of the Interior, to organise that final salaries be paid, and tranport to the train station provided, for two maids who were ceasing work at The Lodge. 8\n\n'Lennie' chose to go with Menzies as his personal secretary when John Curtin became Prime Minister instead of remaining in the Prime Minister's Department. Speaking of his time in opposition in the war years, Menzies noted that a non-ranking Junior Senator in the USA had a personal staff of over sixty, whereas he only had a staff of two, one of which was his ‘devoted secretary’, Eileen Lenihan. 9\n\nHazel Craig, Stenographer\n\nHazel Craig was a stenographer with the Prime Minister’s Department from 1934, working for Prime Ministers Joseph Lyons, Robert Menzies, John Curtin and Ben Chifley. She had immense respect for the war time Prime Ministers in particular:\n\nMr Menzies and Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley I can say really had, I feel that those Prime Ministers really gave what they did for the benefit of Australia ... and you know it was worth working for them.10\n\nIn the Prime Minister's Department, Correspondence Branch, a Typist, Grade 3, could expect to earn between £250 and £262 per year in 1940. Duties included supervising the whole of the typing staff in the Correspondence Section, typing and shorthand as required by the Officer-in-Charge, ordering the stationary each week, drafting letters on files of minor importance and 'special work' when required. 11\n\nWorking hours\n\nWhen war was declared in September 1939, the Prime Minister and his staff worked to all hours.\n\nWell, naturally they were hectic times because there just seemed to be so much to be done in so little time and the War Cabinet used to meet at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. It became.... took precedent over the general Cabinet because well, I've known them to work to meet at eight o'clock at night-there would be the Prime Minister and all the... like the Minister for Defence and Army and Navy and Airforce and the Chiefs of Staff of each of those services and go on until midnight. ... And of course in those days there was no such thing as junior such as I was in the office of getting a car to go home. It didn't matter if anything had stopped, so that you'd have to wait until the Secretary was ready and he or she would get a car and you'd then be taken home. So you know, you might be there until about two o'clock in the morning. But we well we took it all as I suppose as part of our war effort if it came to that. 12"
