        "text": "248. Memorandum From Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the National Security Council Staff to the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger)1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nMalta—Mintoff Sends Message to President\n\nPrime Minister Dom Mintoff has asked Embassy Valletta to transmit the following letter to the President with the utmost urgency and to inform Mintoff when the letter has reached the President.2 The text of the letter is as follows:\n\n“Dear Mr. President:\n\nPrior to the agreement we made with Britain in March this year,3 the United States Government had conceded to send an economic mission to Malta which would submit recommendations for your decision. [Page 785] On June 20 I was assured by our mutual friend, Mr. Robert Ellsworth, that the team’s report was then being reviewed within the U.S. Government and that the United States Government’s responses stemming from the team’s visit to Malta will be transmitted as soon as possible. Considering the urgency of the matters which have been reviewed by the team I would appreciate your personal intervention for a quick decision.\n\nWith cordial greetings,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nDom Mintoff”\n\nYou have a joint memorandum from me and Dick Kennedy (Log 4912 of July 7)4 forwarding a recommended US bilateral assistance package for Malta for decision by the President. As noted in that memorandum, Mintoff’s patience is about to wear out, and unless we inform him quickly of our aid offer we can expect a new crisis. I urge action on the Malta assistance package as soon as possible.\n\nIn a related message from Embassy Valletta, Ambassador Getz has stressed Mintoff’s desire to be notified when his message has reached the President.5 In order to keep this issue moving at a controlled pace, and unless this gives you a problem, I would like to advise State on Thursday, July 13, to inform Embassy Valletta that the message has been received.\n\nRecommendation\n\n1. Action on Log 49126"
