        "text": "Updated with Mater Dei statement at 14:45pm\n\nMater Dei hospital issued a statement about Dom Mintoff's general condition which \"stable.\"\n\nThe statement said \"the medical team responsible for his care envisages that he will require a further few days of inpatient care.\"\n\nThe former 95 year-old premier was admitted into Mater Dei on Saturday morning and subjected to treatment for heart failure and a severe chest infection.\n\nHis condition was said to be critical.\n\nMintoff reportedly fell ill at home and was taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\nLast year, Dom Mintoff was admitted to hospital several times.\n\nDom Mintoff was born in Bormla in 1916. He graduated, as an architect and civil engineer in 1939. He received a scholarship and pursued his studies at Hertford College, Oxford University from where he received a Masters in Science and Engineering in 1943.\n\nMintoff, a politician, journalist and architect served as leader of the Labour Party from 1949 to 1984. He was Prime Minister of Malta from 1955 to 1958 and from 1971 to 1984.\n\nMintoff was Labour's Secretary General between 1935 and 1945. He was first elected to public office in 1945 to the Government Council. In the same year, Mintoff was elected Deputy Leader of the Party with such a wide margin that placed him in an indisputable position as the successor, if not a challenger, to the Leader Paul Boffa.\n\nIn 1947, Mintoff was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction, overseeing large post-War public projects.\n\nMintoff's strong position and ambition led to a split in the Labour Party. In 1949, Prime Minister Paul Boffa resigned and formed the Malta Workers Party and Mintoff refounded the Labour Party as the \"Malta Labour Party\" of which he assumed leadership.\n\nThe split resulted in the weakening of both parties and it was not until 1955 after remaining out of government for three consecutive legislatures, that the Labour Party was elected in office with Mintoff as Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1950’s Mintoff’s relations with the Catholic Church deteriorated to such an extent that it led to interdiction of the Party by the Church. The Labour Party lost the subsequent two elections in 1962 and 1966 and boycotted the Independence celebrations in 1964. The Party was returned to power in 1971 and re-elected in 1976 with a clear majority.\n\nIn 1974 Malta ditched British monarchy to become a republic – a move also supported by most Nationalist MPs. The non-partisan former British governor Sir Anthony Mamo was appointed President.\n\nIn 1979, Mintoff oversaw the closure of the British military base in Malta and declared 31 March as Freedom Day.\n\nIn 1981, Labour remained in government notwithstanding the fact that 51% of the electorate voted in favour of the PN. The victory was sanctioned due to the supremacy of seats, whichwas constitutionally legal. On 22nd December 1984, Mintoff voluntarily left office to enable his successor, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici to take over."
