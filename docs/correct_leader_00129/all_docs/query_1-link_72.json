        "text": "Brandeis University is excited to offer interested students the opportunity to spend a year studying at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. In addition to benefiting from a rigorous and rewarding academic program, students will be able to further develop their intercultural skills on the historic campus of the oldest university in the English-speaking world. The University of Oxford is comprised of a number of colleges; students apply to a specific college rather than the university.\n\nTutorial System\n\nAcademics at Oxford are characterized by the tutorial system. Students typically take two tutorials (courses) per term, which generally meet once per week or once every two weeks. These meetings will be held one-on-one or in small groups with a tutor (professor). The tutorial system is best for students with a high level of discipline and a passion for independent study, who are interested in delving more deeply into subjects of which they have a solid understanding.\n\nChoosing a College\n\nAlthough all of the Oxford colleges operate under the tutorial system, some specialize in certain subjects. When choosing a college, it is important to consider not only the academic subjects available for visiting students, but the overall experience. The size of the college, its location within the city of Oxford and the housing options available there are all things to think about when selecting a college.\n\nAdvising Appointments\n\nTo speak more about Oxford, please schedule an appointment with an advisor.\n\nThe Brandeis study abroad deadline for Oxford University is Friday, January 10, 2025.\n\nNote for International Students\n\nFor applicants who are not from an English-speaking majority country or have not been solely educated in English throughout the past two years at the time of application (educated in English for 2 years by January deadline), we are required by the Home Office and Oxford University to assess your English language ability.\n\nAll teaching at Oxford University is carried out in English (with the exception of some language-specific teaching), and tutors must be convinced you have sufficient fluency in written and spoken English to cope with your course from the start. Therefore, the University of Oxford requires the following from a non-native English-speaking applicant: IELTS: overall score of 7.5 (with at least 7.0 in each of the four components) or TOEFL (internet-based): overall score of 110 with component scores of at least: Listening 22, Reading 24, Speaking 25 and Writing 24."
