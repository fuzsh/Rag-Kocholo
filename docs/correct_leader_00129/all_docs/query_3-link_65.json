        "text": "Throughout the first eight years of Mintoff's third term as Prime Minister, he relentlessly endeavoured to prepare the nation for the great day, the 31st March 1979.\n\nThat was to be the culmination of centuries of struggles by the Maltese people to have their Country under their own complete control.\n\nTotal political independence, however, could only be maintained through economic well-being of the nation's only asset: its people. It was therefore not surprising that Mintoff himself engaged in\n\nobtained six votes more than the Nationalist candidate opposing him. Eventually the Malta Labour Party obtained complexively, a much larger number of votes in its favour than the Nationalists.\n\nIn previous years the Malta Labour Party had taken to Court, the Electoral Commission. The party lost its case however.\n\nPrior to the 1976 and 1981 elections the Electoral Commission revised the electoral districts, and was naturally accused by the Nationalists of jerrymandering, but was wisely not taken to Court. The best lawyers on the Island are also the foremost politicians in the Nationalist Party!\n\nIn 1981, though the Nationalists accused the Labour Government of jerrymandering the elections, and did not concede defeat. They had actually obtained more votes than the Labour Party, but these votes were not reflected in the number of elected members to Parliament.\n\nThe Nationalists therefore mounted a destructive policy the likes of which Malta had never seen before.\n\nThey boycotted Parliament for a number of years, and rallied support from many sectors of the Maltese society, as well as their political allies abroad. They left no stone unturned to turn foreign governments against the Maltese government. For many foreign governments, led by Demo-Christian or Conservative politicians, this was a god-send, for they never liked the idea of having a Socialist government in Malta. The United States President Ronald Reagan, for instance, bluntly refused the insistent requests made by the Maltese President Miss Agatha Barbara for an official visit.\n\nNumerous politically-motivated criminal acts were perpetrated against those who collaborated with the Government. The many small unions representing various categories of workers, were organised in a single body, and injected with a good dose of political motivation suddenly burst to life as never before. Strikes of all types and kinds were organised in a concerted effort to bring down the Labour Government.\n\nThis strife culminated in the brutal killing of\n\n, who having been approved by the Labour Party general conference, was later coopted into Parliament and eventually took the leadership of the Party and became the new Prime Minister.\n\nMeantime, the elected Nationalist deputies, had lost their seatin Parliament for not having attended the sittings as required by Parliamentary regulations.\n\nIn a gesture of good-will by the Labour Party, these MPs were co-opted into Parliament to enable them to return to their abandoned seats.\n\nMintoff's retirement from the leadership of the party did not mean his retirement from politics. On the contrary he continued his activity unrelentlessly behind the scenes to bring about a consensus between the two major political parties on constitutional amendments regarding mainly the electoral system and the effectiveness of the post of President of the Republic. He advocated a system similar to those of the U.S. and France, an executive Presidency, rather than the Constitutional Presidency as at present. The Nationalists accused Mintoff that he was preparing for a come-back as the new President of Malta. I know that at the time there was infact some uncertainty about the matter even in Labour Party ranks, and in other quarters, including the Office of the President.\n\nAs another sign of good-will, and in view of the upcoming general elections, the Labour Government did not appoint a new President of the Republic when in February 1987 the term of Miss Agatha Barbara came to an end. Instead, agreement was reached between the Labour and Nationalist parties to appoint an interim President in the person of Mr Paul Xuereb. He was the only President of Malta to date to have been elected with the consent of both sides of the House of Representatives. Mr Xuereb was to stay in office for as long as was necessary until the two sides reached agreement on Constitutional reform.\n\nThe discussions at a special commission level, formed by representatives of the two parties did not come up with any solution to the dilemma in time for the elections.\n\nThat election was won by the Nationalist Party. The discussions went on for two more years, but still no agreement was reached. This time it was in the interests of the Nationalist Government not to have an executive Presidency as this would have meant a curtailment in their administrative powers.\n\nThe discussions were abruptly ended when the Nationalist Government appointed Dr Censu Tabone, its own representative on the commission, to be the next President.\n\nDom Mintoff again contested the election of 1992 and that of 1996 which was to be his last, and maintained the enormous support he had enjoyed ever since contesting his first general election in 1947.\n\nDuring the 1996 - 1998 Labour-led legislation, notwithstanding the fact that he is now an octagenarian, he was still extremely active in Parliament, and maintained his characteristic eloquence honesty and integrity. He did not hesitate to vote against the Labour Government or abstaining his vote, on matters which he deemed were not beneficial to the working class majority of people in this miniscule Republic. Dom Mintoff's un-planned retirement from the political scene by not contesting the unwarranted 1998 General Election, has left a strong impact on Maltese history as I shall shortly discuss in the next pages."
