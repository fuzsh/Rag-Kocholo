        "text": "Britain has dealt with many thorny colonial problems since the end of World War II which stem from the growth of nationalism: the peoples of dependent territories clamor for either complete independence or dominion status within the evolving empire-commonwealth. Malta is a unique exception. Its Labour Party, which is supported by a majority of the Maltese people, has proposed not a lessening of ties with Great Britain but rather integration of the tiny archipelago with the mother country. At the present, when the liquidation of former colonial empires is proceeding at an ever increasing rate, such an event is of more than passing interest. And yet, as flattering as the Maltese request may be from the British viewpoint, it would be wrong to conclude that Malta has remained unafflicted by the virus of anticolonialism. For, as the Manchester Guardian cautions, the Maltese attitude represents anticolonialism in its most novel form: “If you want our harbours for your ships, our scant land for your aircraft and installations, our rock for your defence, then take us all, the whole of the fortress, and we will be part of your country.”\n\nWhat are the reasons which have impelled the Crown colony of Malta to seek union with Britain while, just 1,200 miles East, the Crown colony of Cyprus has been rent by bitter campaigns by nationalist elements demanding enosis with Greece? The answers lie in Malta’s historical background—a history which bears reviewing for the light it may shed on the problem of other strategically important colonial territories.\n\nTwo obstacles have always stood in the way of either complete independence or dominion status for Malta. First, the islands are not by themselves economically viable. The two principal islands of Malta and Gozo comprise in all only an area of approximately 120 square miles on which huddle nearly 330,000 people—a land area which the Knights of Malta considered inadequate to support more than 30,000 inhabitants and which modern population experts contend can today support not more than 250,000. (A population density of 2,600 people per square mile makes Malta the most densely populated country in Europe.) There are no known natural resources even though nationalist elements have circulated as yet unfounded rumors that Britain expects to find oil in the colony and hastens to absorb Malta before the discovery is made. Malta’s land is of volcanic origin and most of it is barren rock. The colony must import over 90 per cent of its food. Any relief from population pressure through a governmental program of encouraging birth control is ruled out, for the island’s population is 99 per cent Roman Catholic, and the 8,000 annual births are far in excess of deaths.\n\nThe possession of a British passport, which enables thousands of Maltese to migrate to other Commonwealth territories, has served as a safety valve. Prior to the amendment of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, which restricted immigration from Malta as well as other British colonies to 100 per year, thousands of Maltese came to the United States under the large unused British quota (66,000) and found employment here in Detroit’s automobile factories.\n\nThe entire Maltese economy is geared to the British naval dockyards, where nearly 14,000 Maltese make their livelihood by repairing British warships. This fact explains Malta’s anxiety over Britain’s retreat from its overseas empire and the decline of British naval power. Ironically, it is only the threat of war in the Mediterranean which keeps the Maltese economy healthy. The level of Maltese employment has been kept high by a 32,000,000 pound sterling British grant to repair the damage inflicted on Malta by over 3,000 Axis air raids in World War II. With the fund nearly exhausted, Malta faces the problem of how to cope with the large scale unemployment which is expected to result upon the termination of the reconstruction work.\n\nSecond—and more important from Britain’s standpoint because of Malta’s location just east of the mid-Mediterranean narrows only sixty miles from Sicily and 160 miles from Tunisia, and just half way between Gibraltar and Suez—Malta, since the days of Nelson, has been the headquarters of H.M. Mediterranean Fleet. Today it is also the Mediterranean headquarters of NATO and an important air “base” of the U. S. Sixth Fleet. Thus, in 1953, Britain’s Colonial Secretary advised the Prime Minister of Malta in writing that because of its strategic location, its size and economic situation, Malta could not be considered eligible for complete independence within the Commonwealth. Even left-wing British Labourite Aneurin Bevan, who is well known for his uninhibited support of demands for independence by most of England’s dependencies, has stated: “The situation of Malta as a fortress made it impossible for Malta to find its way to independence by the same road as other countries.”\n\nThe government of Malta is diarchical in form. The present constitution, promulgated in 1947, granted Malta “home rule.” It provided for a 40-seat legislature elected under a system of proportional representation. The legislature has power to enact domestic laws but cannot deal with matters specified in the constitution as “reserved,” i.e. defense and foreign affairs. The reserved powers are exercised by the Maltese Imperial Government which consists primarily of a Governor (presently Major General Sir Robert Laycock), a Lieutenant-Governor, and a Legal Secretary. In the last election, held in February, 1955, the Labour Party won 23 seats to seventeen for the Nationalists. Progressive Conservatives, Malta’s only other political party, failed to win a single seat. The uncontested leader of the Maltese Labour Party is 42-year-old Dominic Mintoff who was Prime Minister of Malta from February, 1955, until his abrupt resignation in April, 1958. In theory, the present constitutional arrangement, given Malta’s ineligibility for dominion status, might seem satisfactory. In fact, however, the reverse is true. Malta’s situation is not strictly analogous to that of any other dependency. Since the colony’s economy is built around the naval dockyards, there is literally no issue which does not in some way impinge upon matters reserved to the Crown. This fact more than anything else makes diarchy unworkable in Malta. Several incidents in the recent past served to illustrate this point. During the summer of 1956, when war threatened over Nasser’s seizure of the Suez Canal, Britain sought to evacuate some of its nationals from Egypt on flying boats. The Governor of Malta, without consulting the Prime Minister, issued over the British owned rediffusion radio system the order to clear the bays of Malta of all fishing boats so that the flying boats carrying the refugees might land safely. The Prime Minister’s reaction was violent. He charged in effect that fishing was a domestic matter and that the Governor had exceeded his reserved powers by giving the order without consulting him. He demanded that the order be rescinded. When the Governor refused to accept this position, the Prime Minister ordered squads of Maltese to cut down all radio poles and cables in retaliation.\n\nAnother indication of Maltese dissatisfaction with the present constitution has been the controversy over the naval air installations of the U. S. Sixth Fleet which were established on Malta nearly six years ago. Maltese leaders of all parties charge that they were deceived by the British as to the true nature of the original agreement. According to Dr. V. E. Ragonesi, Secretary of the Nationalist Party, writing for Malta Taghua, the stated purpose for the stationing of American air men in Malta was to “familiarize them with flying conditions in the central Mediterranean.” It was understood that a tactical “base” as such was not contemplated. The Maltese, according to Ragonesi, were under the impression that only a very small number of aircraft would be based there and they would utilize an R.A.F. aerodrome.\n\nIt should not be inferred that the Maltese are anti-American: actually they have shown pleasure at the fact that the United States considers Malta of enough strategic importance to warrant basing aircraft on the island. What irked them in this case was that the agreement was negotiated by the British authorities without drawing the Maltese leaders into their confidence as to the real purpose of the base. They were irritated further when the base was enlarged at the expense of Maltese arable land, which already is woefully scarce.\n\nEven more important are Maltese suspicions that Britain, through “off-shore procurements agreements,” receives in the neighborhood of twelve million dollars from the U. S. Government for the base and that Malta receives no share of this subsidy. If Britain indeed receives such a subsidy, the Maltese argue, it is the Americans who defray Westminster’s annual financial obligations to the colony. (The present British subsidy is approximately 6,000,000 pounds or 116,800,000.) The Nationalists would like to be free to lease Malta to NATO or, directly, to the United States. Mr. Mintoff has stated that either Malta must be incorporated into the United Kingdom or cut loose to enable it to sell its strategic assets to the “highest bidder.” A number of Maltese also complain that the U. S. agreement with Britain apparently included a provision prohibiting the American forces from visiting Valletta, Malta’s capital, thus depriving the Maltese economy of the indirect benefits of consumer purchases by American naval personnel.\n\nThere have been similar criticisms of the manner in which NATO headquarters were established in Malta. According to the Maltese version, on Christmas Eve, 1953, the Governor called at the residence of the Maltese Prime Minister and upon not finding him at home left a short note advising the Prime Minister that on the following morning he would broadcast a message of Christmas greetings to the people of Malta. The note stated that the message, while primarily Christmas greetings to the people of Malta, would “incidentally” inform them that Malta was going to become NATO headquarters for the Mediterranean. The Prime Minister, upon returning home and reading the note, requested the Governor to confine his message to Christmas greetings until such time as the matter of a NATO headquarters had been fully discussed with representatives of the Maltese Government. The Governor refused, contending that the establishment of NATO headquarters was a defense matter and thus within the purview of those powers specified as “reserved” by the 1947 Constitution.\n\nWhile Maltese domestic politics have been marked by bitter factionalism, both major political parties desire substantive changes in Malta’s constitutional relationship with Britain. The ruling Labour Party and the opposition Nationalists have used the election platform to inveigh against what they believe to be the indiscriminate use of the “reserved” powers by the Maltese Imperial Government. And even the pro-British Progressive Conservative Party of Lady Strickland considers it shameful that Malta is lumped, for administrative purposes, together with primitive African tribes.\n\nIt is against this background of resentment that the Maltese Labour Government made its novel proposal for the gradual integration of Malta, over a fifteen to twenty year period, with the social, political, and financial institutions of the United Kingdom. Under this scheme, Malta would eventually assume a status somewhat analogous to that of Northern Ireland, which has its own parliament to legislate on domestic affairs, but sends twelve representatives to London to debate questions of broader United Kingdom policy. The integration proposal appeals particularly to the members of Malta’s General Workers Union (dockworkers), which constitutes the Maltese Labour Party’s principal source of electoral strength, because the dockworkers wish to share in the social services of the British welfare state. Mr. Mintoff has justified his demand for representation on the grounds that Malta is no different from metropolitan English dockyard service towns such as Devonport and Chatham. There is, indeed, some justice in the Maltese argument that their welfare is as much at the mercy of the British defense budget as that of the English service constituencies. To refute arguments that three Maltese members in the House of Commons would wield little influence, Mr. Mintoff points out that the British dockyard constituencies are represented in London even less than Malta would be if integration were carried through, but this has not prevented them from obtaining some satisfaction for their grievances.\n\nThe fear that advances in weapons technology and changes in the global conflict may eventually devalue Malta as a strategic stronghold is central to Mr. Mintoff’s efforts to consummate union with Britain as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister frequently has quoted from an article in The Tablet, a Roman Catholic weekly, in which the editor argued that Malta has an excellent opportunity today to exploit the islands’ value to Great Britain as a naval and military base— an opportunity that may never come again. He believes that once Malta is integrated, the United Kingdom will be under an obligation to raise the Maltese standard of living towards that of the mother country, whatever the changes and shifts in the strategy of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Nationalist Party has countered Mintoff’s integration program with a proposal for a quasi-dominion status for Malta, under which Britain, in co-operation with the Maltese Government, would retain control over defense and foreign affairs, but under treaty arrangements which would be subject to renegotiation as the parties saw fit. Such an arrangement is unacceptable to Westminster because it would set the stage for constant and protracted haggling over rental costs and other controversial political issues.\n\nThe Nationalists’ opposition to union with Great Britain is conditioned by their back ground as a party. Prior to World War II, many elements in the party favored union with Italy, and there is little question that had Malta not been British, it would inevitably have been Italian—a fact which would have had serious consequences for the allies in World War II. Little sentiment for union with Italy remains today: Malta’s standard of living is now higher than that of the nearby Italian island of Sicily, and the Maltese realize that Italy, which is not a naval power and already has abundant island possessions in the Mediterranean, would not invest heavily in the strategic position of Malta. Then, too, Mussolini’s air raids killed whatever roots the “Italianity” movement may have had in the Maltese people. Nevertheless, the party leadership still retains a certain affinity for Italy, although this feeling is not reciprocated by the Italian people or government.\n\nAn equally important motive back of the nationalist leaders’ opposition to integration is their social and economic status. Largely the representatives of the island’s middle classes, i.e. the professional men and merchants, they fear that the austere British income tax, which will be imposed upon the Maltese in the event of union, would ruin them financially. It is for the same reason that such staunch pro-British Maltese aristocrats as Lady Strickland (O.B.E.), find themselves in the same camp with the pro-Italian Nationalist leaders on the integration issue. By far the most formidable opposition to the integration proposal of the Maltese Government comes from Msgr. Michael Gonzi, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Malta. For in Malta, as in Cyprus, religion is still the most powerful social and political force. As Douglas Hyde states, writing in the Catholic publication The Commonweal, “There are not many lands which can be described with accuracy as being Catholic today . . . where the great mass of the people still worship as Catholics, where the whole weight of public opinion is Catholic, where the majority think as Catholics, and where no anti-Catholic or openly anti-clerical party stands a chance of gaining support. . . . There is Ireland and there is Malta.” Secularism has almost completely bypassed Malta. The Archbishop ostensibly seeks guarantees in writing regarding the continued privileged position of the Roman Catholic Church before he will agree to remove the Church’s opposition to integration. While it is understandable that the Archbishop might be somewhat hesitant to permit the absorption of Catholic Malta by Protestant England, it is clear that his real fear lies elsewhere. Britain has ruled Malta since 1800, when the Maltese, after seeking British naval help in defeating Napoleon’s garrison, asked the British to remain and establish a protectorate. For 150 years, the Crown has respected the privileged position of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta, and the British Government, to meet the Archbishop’s demands, has reaffirmed its declaration of 1802 which pledged that the Church’s privileged status would not be altered. But even such solid assurances have failed to satisfy the Archbishop. The Times of London suggests the logical source of Msgr. Gonzi’s apprehensions: “The Archbishop’s proposal [the demand for written guarantees] brings into the open what has become increasingly evident— that the Church authorities, though ostensibly concerned that under the integration scheme a Protestant Parliament at Westminster should not have the right to interfere in matters affecting the Roman Catholic Church in Malta, are in fact much more concerned about how a Maltese government under Mr. Mintoff might affect the present privileged position of the Church in the islands and ultimately exercise an increasing secular influence in many fields which the Church has hitherto controlled.” The Times British Colonies Review (first quarter, 1956) ascribes the following reasoning to the Archbishop: “The success of integration would strengthen the moral authority and no doubt prolong the tenure of office of Mintoff and the Labour Party. Its members in the Maltese Legislature are good Catholics*to a man; but as in most countries where Catholic Christianity predominates, the progressive layman’s conception is apt to differ markedly from the priestly conception of the political welfare of the faith.” Union with Britain, while it would make Malta an integral part of the United Kingdom, would also abolish the British Imperial Government in the islands. Thus Mr. Mintoff would be as free as the government of Northern Ireland to secularize the domestic life of the colony. During the course of his correspondence on the integration proposal with the ecclesiastical authorities, Mr. Mintoff wrote the Archbishop as follows: “Greater contacts on the part of our people with the outside world are inevitable. In the last ten years or so, the precariousness of our economy and the lack of any future for our children have condemned over fifty thousand of our people to find a livelihood in countries abroad. Our proposals for the political and economic union with Britain are designed to make it possible for many of our people to lead a full life according to accepted modern standards in their own country. I leave it to your Grace to consider which is the greater danger to the religion of our people.”\n\nThe church in Malta convincingly demonstrated its political power at the polls in February, 1956, when the Maltese voted on the Labour Government’s proposal in a referendum. Two days prior to the voting, the Archbishop attacked the proposal and advised the islanders not to support it. Of the final total of 90,343 votes cast in the referendum, 67,607 favored integration and 20,177 opposed the proposal. The remaining votes were invalid. The Labour Party actually received 75 per cent of the total vote cast. The Nationalist Party, realizing that it could not defeat the proposal, boycotted the referendum, but it was primarily due to the Church’s attitude that approximately 40,000 of the eligible voters abstained. Hence, the Church’s intervention made it possible for the opponents of integration to argue that the vote was not decisive enough to endorse so momentous a step as integration, despite the fact that slightly over 50 per cent of the normal voting population of Malta supported the Labour Government’s proposal. Few objective observers doubted that, had it not been for the directives of the Church, integration would have been approved overwhelmingly by the Maltese people. Despite the controversy generated by the integration issue in Malta and the failure of Mr. Mintoff to obtain from the Maltese people a decisive verdict in favor of his proposal, the British Government, with the full support of the opposition Labour Party, agreed unconditionally to break the 700-year-old tradition which allowed only metropolitan Britain to be represented in Parliament and offered Malta three seats in the House of Commons. As of May, 1958, the integration project is still blocked by the problem of establishing a timetable for synchronizing Maltese and British social services and financial obligations. Mr. Min- toff, under heavy pressure from his 14,000 dockworkers, demands that Malta have quick access to the social and economic benefits of the English welfare state, but Britain insists on first raising the tax levels in Malta to a point where they at least approximate those in the United Kingdom. The Maltese Government has agreed to raise the Maltese tax level, but agreement had foundered on the obviously inadequate taxable income left in Malta. Britain, with already strained finances, does not wish to commit herself to what may become a perpetual liability.\n\nOn April 6, 1958, at an open air meeting in Valletta, Mr. Mintoff told an audience of 16,000 that if Britain closes down the dockyards in Malta without guaranteeing employment for the workers laid off, he will eject NATO and throw his weight behind a movement to obtain independence. In his speech, he argued that Britain and the United States are paying large sums of money to Libya for the right to station troops and maintain airbases in that country. Pointing to the NATO headquarters, he stated: “NATO does not pay a bit. It will not remain long here if the British don’t pay up.” Mr. Mintoff went on to point out that Britain was losing Cyprus as well as other territories because it had tried to retain control of them by outdated methods and stated: “We do not want the Russians. We want work and equality with the British.”\n\nTo complicate the situation further, Mr. Mintoff resigned as Prime Minister of Malta on April 21, 1958, stating that the Labour Government could no longer maintain law and order in the islands. Following his resignation, riots and demonstrations against the British were touched off in Malta’s principal cities. Since the opposition Nationalist Party declined the governor’s invitation to form a government, the Governor took over the job of governing the islands. In a broadcast to the Maltese people, he informed them that new elections will be held at the “earliest possible time.”\n\nAs the issue of American bases becomes a growing source of tension in the countries of Europe and North Africa, the West’s smaller strategic footholds along the Eurasian periphery become ever more important. The strategy of NATO is not and cannot be confined to the territory of continental Europe. Western Europe, as a strategic entity, lacks the defense in depth required for maneuverability and dispersal in modern nuclear combat. The Western Mediterranean connects rather than divides the strategic area of NATO; it links the territory of NATO countries in Europe with NATO and SAC bases in North Africa and Spain. While the Mediterranean is geographically one sea stretching 2,500 miles from Gibraltar to Suez, strategically it consists of two major basins. The narrows between Sicily and Tunisia, for all practical purposes, cuts the sea in half. Malta guards the approaches from the east to the narrowest and shallowest point of entry into the Western Mediterranean basin. Control of this gateway becomes ever more important in the light of the Soviet penetration of the Eastern Mediterranean basin via its submarine base in Albania and its growing influence in the United Arab Republic of Egypt-Syria-Yemen. In addition, Malta flanks Wheelus Air Force Base, one of SAC’s most important forward bases.\n\nChanges in weapons technology may indeed raise the value of such small territories as Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Ceuta, and the Balearic and Canary islands, to mention only a few. The West’s deterrent strategy must depend increasingly upon a dispersal of its air-missile nuclear power. While the above territories may not be suitable for basing long range nuclear bombers requiring long runways, they can be readily adapted as missile launching sites and as service stations for aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. Conceivably, as some strategists argue, one nuclear bomb could obliterate either Malta or Gibraltar, but the dispersion of Western bases reduces the mathematical possibility of a single successful knockout blow by the Soviets. A British evacuation from Cyprus, for example, would, regardless of the importance of Cyprus as a military base, consummate psychologically as well as militarily the withdrawal of Western power and influence from the Eastern Mediterranean. A British withdrawal from Malta could have a similar impact upon the West’s position in the Central and Western Mediterranean which includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.\n\nUnlike the strife in Cyprus and the grim guerrilla war in Algeria, the problem of Malta does not yet call for any drastic remedies. Through NATO, the United States could help solve those economic problems which stand in the way of Malta’s union with Britain. An annual NATO subsidy of, let us say, twenty million dollars to Malta might, in the end, procure more benefits to the West than, for example, the nearly two billion dollars in economic and military aid extended to Yugoslavia.\n\nNATO thus far has failed to deal with problems outside the military purview of the Atlantic Pact—this despite the fact that NATO has often been suggested as the most suitable framework for solving the vexing colonial problems of its members as, for example, Cyprus and Algeria. Malta has the makings of an ideal pilot project to which the common resources and know-how of the Atlantic alliance could be applied. It is ideally located as a potential “show window” through which the benefits of co-operation with the West can be projected to adjacent Arab lands."
