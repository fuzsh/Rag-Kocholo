        "text": "Following findings of the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, former PN leader Simon Busuttil has called for the resignation of President George Vella. Stating that ‘if he truly respects his Office, then he too must go’, Busuttil stated that such is the scale of degradation of state institutions as even the President of Malta was a Minister in Joseph Muscat’s disgraced cabinet.\n\nThe inquiry, which was published last week, found the Cabinet to have been responsible, at least in part, for the assassination of the late journalist due to not taking the necessary precautions to ensure her safety. The cabinet was criticised for allowed power to be concentrated within the hands of the Prime Minister and his close allies.\n\nDue to Vella having been part of Muscat’s cabinet between 2013 and 2017 as Foreign Minister, Busuttil calls for his resignation. Both the Nationalist Party and the NGO Repubblika called on all the cabinet members named in the inquiry to step down. The response of Prime Minister Robert Abela was that the inquiry’s findings are accepted by the government and is thus committed to implementing the recommendations made.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nPhoto Source: Simon Busuttil FB, Business or Pleasure\n\nA €2.5 million investment into the restoration of the Esplora bay in Kalkara was inaugurated today by Prime Minister Robert Abela as a new sea transport service between the bay and the Grand Harbour was established. During the inauguration, Prime Minister Robert Abela stated that this project will be one that will bring together innovation, infrastructure and environment.\n\nAbela stated that we are once again witnessing an area of Malta which was once abandoned and dangerous transformed into a space where families can enjoy time together. The project is contributing to the environmental vision of the government. As part of the National Strategy and Plan for Transport, the government plans to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution whilst strengthening the maritime sector. A Malta which is innovative with the infrastructure that it deserves and operates projects which respect cultural heritage and the environment is the government’s goal, stated Abela.\n\nThe Prime Minister was joined by Minister for Research and Innovation Owen Bonnici who in turn expressed his satisfaction in seeing the iconic landmark restore and returned to the Maltese public in a respectful way.\n\nPraising the initiative by the Maltese Council of Science and Technology (MCST), he explained how this work transcended its original goal and accepted the challenge to work on this project which is set to benefit the entire community. Minister Bonnici also emphasised the importance of people being exposed to science and how Esplora welcomes around 100,000 visitors per year.\n\nMCST chairperson executive Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando described the rehabilitation of the bay as being the MCST’s latest achievement. Esplora was declared as a flagship project for Malta from the European Commission and is considered as one of the best interactive centres in Europe.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nPhoto Source: Owen Bonnici FB, Robert Abela FB\n\nTwo men were arraigned in court for allegedly stealing food from a super market, with their lawyer defending their case as having been done out of hunger. The two men, both 48-years-old, admitted to Magistrate Rachel Montebello to committing the crime in a supermarket in Wied il-Ghajn, with inspector Clayton Camilleri revealing that CCTV cameras gave them away.\n\nDaniel Attard, the lawyer standing in for the two men, stated that the act was committed due to hunger. He also pointed out that one of the men, Mario Campolo, is a drug addict, and the other, Mario Mifsud, had a disability.\n\nBoth the prosecutor and the defensive attorney recognised that both men required aid, with the Magistrate set to give the final sentence tomorrow. Both men will be kept under arrest until then.\n\n#MaltaDaily\n\nPhoto Source: Kamra tal-Periti, Glasgow Times"
