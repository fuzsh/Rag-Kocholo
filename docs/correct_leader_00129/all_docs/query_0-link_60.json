Najjar\n\nAUM President\n\nMESSAGE FROM AUM PRESIDENT\n\nWelcome to the American University of Malta (AUM)…\n\nWe at AUM feel proud and privileged to serve from Malta, the island where beauty, splendour, history and culture combine to generate a wonderful learning environment.\n\nFrom our central location in the heart of the Mediterranean, we project outwards to engage learners from Malta, Europe, and beyond. We strive to give them all a special platform to develop their minds, their hearts and their souls.\n\nAUM is an American style university that is founded on European soil. That in itself makes it special in many ways. It makes us value diversity and appreciate differences; notions that enrich every academic endeavour. It also enables us to conform to both European and American standards of academic excellence and permits our staff and students to engage in both learning systems. We at AUM strive to be bold in our aspirations and entrepreneurial in our approach to everything we do.\n\nAs the community of the American University of Malta, we pride ourselves on the thirty five different nationalities that comprise our University. We believe that each and every one of them has something special to contribute to our family. We believe in openness, tolerance and in promoting equity and happiness. Our values stem from our commitment to anything and everything that is true, that is good and beautiful; notions that are engrained in us all at AUM and urge us to be the agents of positive change in our community here in Malta and all over the world.\n\nOur programs are designed, managed and delivered by specialists and are directed at those who aspire to lead in this modern day and age. Many of these programs are novel in theme and in substance and relate to the non-classical and emerging specialties. Here, at AUM, we learn from the past to live the present while planning for the future…\n\nAs President, I have the honour and responsibility of continuing the sustainable leadership of the American University of Malta. I strongly encourage you to visit our university and learn more about the opportunities at AUM. Our Faculty and staff are here because you are here and they will always be a reliable source of assistance and support.\n\nTogether, we make a difference; we make things happen…\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichel I. Najjar"
