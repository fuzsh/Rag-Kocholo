        "text": "The purpose of this explorative study is to put the existing theories on charismatic political leadership in a current post-web media context. It also seeks to better understand why “charismatic politicians” seem to have success in present-day cyber politics. The paper considers political charisma in a Weberian perspective and aims to explain what elements it includes in a current electoral environment characterized by a fast-changing media landscape. The paper places the existing theoretical models in the context of two European societies, by comparing Estonia and Italy as case studies. Estonia, a small ex-Soviet country has emerged in recent years as an advanced e-society with highly “internetisized” media. At the same time, Italy became known by the phenomenon of the “Berlusconization” of the media, a popular subject of study in political communication. The analysis considers existing research, mostly based on the work of Max Weber, and aims to test the index of charisma, develop...\n\nThis paper sets out to examine the history and current standing of politics and public administration education at the University of Malta, the island’s sole university. It will be argued that in the case of the discipline of politics, the greatest obstacle which has hindered its development has been the low esteem that politics as a whole has generally enjoyed among the Maltese. In respect of public administration, however, we shall see that the difficulties that this discipline has encountered, and which have inhibited its full inception into the curriculum of the university, have arisen mainly from the ambivalent attitude displayed in its regard both by governments and by the university.\n\nIs it the case that young and aspiring Maltese politicians today tend, in practice, consciously or otherwise, to share the same notions of what doing politics is or should be? The results of this ethnographic participant observation carried out within the window of opportunity provided by the March 2013 national elections – with field work undertaken from February 2013 to January 2014 – indicate that, whereas the hypothetical starting point is essentially correct, reality is in fact richer, more complex and nuanced. The theoretical framework that guided the formulation of the problem, the actual research and the analysis is a synthesis of the principal insights of Judith Butler, Erving Goffman and Pierre Bourdieu. These insights were not uncritically applied; on the contrary, the dissertation engages them critically, opting for elements from one and refusing elements of another, pragmatically indicating which ‘worked’ and which didn’t in the endeavour to explain the researcher’s field observations."
