        "text": "228. Telegram From the Department of State to the Embassy in Malta1\n\n116169. Joint State/Defense message. USDOCOSOUTH, CINCEUR, CINCLANT for POLAD. Subject: US Policy Toward Malta. Ref: Valletta 585.2\n\n1. We agree with your assessment of Mintoff’s character and style of operation. We had those considerations in mind in defining our basic policy approach set out in State 1088843 and 11208.4 Our general policy at this time will be one of restraint. We want to take no initiatives. Our response to GOM initiatives will be unhurried, and based on a close assessment of US interests and those of our allies, which in some cases (UK and Italy) are more extensively and directly involved than our own are. You will have noted that the UK, Italy, and FRG have all adopted a wait-and-see policy similar to our own.\n\n2. Concerning ship visits, we think that Mintoff may have an exaggerated idea of the value of Malta’s facilities to the US. They are useful to us, but by no means essential; it is not vital to us to maintain our ship visits to Malta. You will recall Navy only reluctantly undertook ship visits at Department urging in the sixties as part of effort to bolster GOM. The best way to disabuse Mintoff of the notion that the facilities give him important leverage on us is to show no alarm at what he has done, and no haste to learn what “revisions of general arrangements” he has in mind. FYI. We do have a great concern, however, with possible developments involving Soviet interests in the area. We consider it a military necessity that Malta not be permitted to become a base for [Page 743] Soviet naval and air operations. Any concession by Mintoff suggesting this possibility should be watched and reported. Similarly, his recent objection to NATO meetings may be his initial move in forcing the withdrawal of the NATO headquarters. The temporary cancellation of Sixth Fleet visits inhibits US flexibility in the area and appears contrary to both US and Maltese interests. End FYI.\n\n3. Therefore, you should take no rpt no initiative to see Mintoff or to discuss the ship visits issue with others in GOM. Mintoff probably expects you to be anxious to know more about his plans. When you show no anxiety, he or others may raise the subject with you again. If that happens, you should say that you have informed Washington of the Maltese position on ship visits, and that Washington is waiting for GOM to tell us in due course what it has in mind with its reference to revisions of general arrangements. If the Maltese ask about our reaction to Mintoff’s request for equipment, you should say, without expressing any regrets, that you have reported to Washington and have had no reply.\n\n4. Similarly, you should make no rpt no mention of the Oceanographic Institute project and the Timios Stavros case.5 Failure provide affirmative response to request for Sixth Fleet visit raises question of entry such vessels for repair in drydocks. For present therefore, we are holding in abeyance provision of list of repair opportunities. If you are queried about the latter, you should say that you understand that a work package had been in preparation, but that you have no information about its present status."
