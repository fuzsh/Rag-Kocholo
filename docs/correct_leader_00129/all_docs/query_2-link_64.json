        "text": "A number of top brass from the Labour administration have laid flowers under a statue of a former Prime Minister to mark his birthday.\n\nHealth Minister Chris Fearne alongside MP Randolph Debattista appeared in front of Dom Mintoff’s monument in Bormla to mark his birthday, with is on the 6th August.\n\nThe Labour Party described Mintoff as a “giant in Maltese politics that will be remembered for the social projects he carried out, the investments he attracted to the island and the important constitutional achievements he obtained, such as total freedom from the United Kingdom.\n\nMintoff is both beloved – and criticised – by various parts of the island for his time as the island’s leader.\n\nMintoff held office between 1955 and 1958 and again between 1971 and 1984. He is one of the most controversial figures in the history of Maltese politics and is loved and hated in equal measure.\n\nHis supporters rightly credit him with having heralded several progressive reforms in the country and of having overseen society’s release from the grip of the Catholic church. He is also credited with creating Malta’s welfare state and raising living standards for the poorest in society.\n\nOn the other hand, the premiership was towards the end characterised by authoritarianism and outbreaks of political violence."
