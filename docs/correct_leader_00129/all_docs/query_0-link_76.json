        "text": "Fr Dionysus Mintoff, the brother of Malta’s famous former Prime Minister, has stepped in to help solve food shortages at the Ħal Far Open Centre left devastated following last Sunday’s riot.\n\nMintoff’s NGO Peace Lab was asked to step in after the riot left the open centre wrecked and short of valuable resources.\n\n“The area used by the administration and reception is still not structurally safe, due to the fire, damaged electrical cables, and damaged premises.”\n\n“The Open Centre has been rendered dysfunctional and the offices have been completely destroyed. AWAS is working to restore functionality as soon as possible,” the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) said.\n\n“Currently, AWAS is working on the premises to remove any hazardous material or situations, render the place safe, and establish logistical and administrative focal points,” they continued.\n\nThe news came following a Times of Malta report claiming teenagers as young as 14 were left without food for days.\n\nWhile AWAS insisted that there are no unaccompanied minors asylum seekers (UMAS) under the age of 16 formally residing at the Ħal Far Tent Village, they revealed that it was working with Peace Lab to ensure food will continue to be distributed.\n\nThe centre is also currently experiencing a staff shortage with several workers reporting sick due to the psychological effects of the riot."
