        "text": "Thank you for calling in, at this tiny corner in cyber-space, which I consider my own, and which I am so glad to share with you. In almost four years since I put up this site, a good number of thousands of people have come here to read about Dom Mintoff, so much that this has become a reference site for those interested in the life and deeds of this Statesman who has left a definite mark in international politics.\n\nAlthough the Internet is no longer as new as it was some years back when I first put up this site, it is still a fascinating means of communication as ever. The past few years have, if anything, made of internet one of the most reachable sources of information man has ever devised. People the world over, can now directly contact and maintain written, visual and audio communication with other peoples practically anywhere else in the world.\n\nAnother great possibility which the internet offers to so many people who have yearned to publish their personal ideas is to do just that without, for instance, incurring in prohibitive costs. Beside its low cost, the internet offers also ease of publication without the usual problems involved in the publication sector.\n\nTaking up on this idea, I too have published some of my writings on the Internet. These vary in nature, from the contemporary political history of my country, Malta, dominated as it was until recently, by Dom Mintoff, to some of my literary works and studies on specific subjects.\n\nThe text language used is English. I have, however, left my literary writings in their original language, Maltese.\n\nAs you can see, there is minimum use of graphics in this page, to facilitate downloading. This might, unfortunately, make this page visually dull for some people's tastes. My apologies for that."
