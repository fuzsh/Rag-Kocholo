        "text": "from Malta, as well as the equally immediate expulsion of NATO chief Admiral Birindelli from the Island.\n\nIt is worth noting here that despite that NATO had its Southern Europe headquarters on the Island, Malta was refused membership, even even as an observer!\n\nThe Mintoff-led government then embarked on its major challenge, that of reviewing the Financial and Defence Agreements signed in 1964 by the previous government on the granting of Indipendence.\n\nheld in London were tough as the British Government had already plancs to dismantle completely its base in Malta by 1974 -- leaving thousands of Maltese people jobless, and further adding to the economic disaster prevailing during those times. For, besides direct payment by the UK Government for the use of facilities on the island, and the employment of local civilian personnel, British families living in Malta where contributing indirectly to the economy as well.\n\nWith the changing of times, British interests no longer required the maintaining of a base in Malta.\n\nMintoff was fully aware of that but justifiably maintained that the strategic geographical position of Malta was still of the utmost importance.\n\nShrewd as he always was, Mintoff let it be known that contacts 'could' be made with the Soviet Union over the use of the military base in Malta.\n\nThe US backed NATO jumped in when discussions with Britain reached a stalemate. Still no agreement was reached as the demand for rent fixed by Mintoff at 20 million pounds yearly,was not reached. Towards the end of 1971, the Malta Government issued an ultimatum to the British Government, ordering all British personnel to leave the Island. The British took Mintoff's threat seriously and dismantled all their facilities and evacuated almost all their personnel and families from the Island before the deadlined hour was reached. They did perhaps believe they could by this action call Mintoff's 'bluff' hoping he would rethink Malta's stand, and reduce his demands.\n\nIt was not Mintoff who changed his mind however, but the British. An eleventh hour agreement was eventually reached when the British gave in to Mintoff's modified demands. The\n\nand obtained another soft loan from the Chinese Government as well.\n\nMintoff had successfully embarked on the path of declaring Malta a neutral state, with both Super powers of that time, the United States and the Soviet Union being afforded the same facilities, but with both being barred from having any military personnel on the Island or their ships entering Malta's harbours.\n\nFollowing on this path discussions were also started with Libya, and a strong friendship and active cooperation started between the two countries. It must be noted here that throughout the struggle with Britain and NATO, it was Libya which was financially backing the Malta government. When the Labour Party took office in 1971, the Government funds were short of inuumerable millions, national debt was enormous, and the Government did not even have the cash required to pay the salaries to its employees.
