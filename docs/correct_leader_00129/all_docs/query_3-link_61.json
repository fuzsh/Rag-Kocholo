He served as Leader of the Opposition during 1962-71.\n\nMr Mintoff became Prime Minister for a second term in June 1971 and yet again following the General Elections in September, 1976 and in December, 1981. In September 1983, he was assigned also the office of Minister of the Interior.\n\nOn 22nd December 1984, Mr Mintoff voluntarily left office to enable his successor, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, to take overto take over."
