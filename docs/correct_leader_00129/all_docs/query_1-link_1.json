        "text": "Dom Mintoff (born August 6, 1916, Cospicua, Malta—died August 20, 2012, Tarxien) was a leader of Malta’s Labor Party, who served two terms as prime minister (1955–58; 1971–84) and held a seat in parliament from 1947 to 1998.\n\nMintoff was educated at the University of Malta in science and civil engineering (B.S., 1937). He was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and continued his education at Oxford University, earning a master’s degree in engineering science in 1939. Unable to return to Malta during the Italian and German siege of World War II, he worked as a civil engineer in Britain from 1941 to 1943. Back in Malta, he practiced as an architect and helped reestablish the Labor Party in 1944, becoming its deputy leader and minister of reconstruction in 1947. He left that post to become leader of the party in 1949.\n\nMintoff served as Malta’s prime minister and minister of finance from 1955 to 1958, during which period he introduced major social reforms on the island. As a result of his “Union with Britain” electoral platform, the British government (which had controlled Malta since the 19th century) set up a roundtable conference in which leaders of the British and Maltese political parties participated. Agreement was reached on economic matters and on Malta’s direct representation in the British House of Commons, but there was serious disagreement with the British government regarding the implementation of economic reforms, and street demonstrations against the British ensued. Mintoff resigned in 1958 in protest against the British, and he led the Maltese Liberation Movement, which spearheaded the drive for independence.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1971 Mintoff was leader of the opposition to the Nationalist government. During this time, the Roman Catholic Church in Malta opposed the political and civil reforms advocated by the Labor Party and declared that it was a mortal sin to vote for Mintoff’s party, to listen to Labor speeches, or to read the party’s political literature. When, in 1964, independence was granted to Malta by Britain, the Labor Party opposed the new constitution, arguing that the British government had tied it to financial and defense conditions that infringed seriously on Malta’s sovereignty and transformed Malta into a neocolony.\n\nIn 1971 Mintoff again became prime minister. Aggressively proclaiming Malta’s sovereignty, he posed financial and other demands to the British and NATO. This led to a 1972 treaty with Britain that stipulated a phasing out of dependency on British military expenditure and the freeing of Malta from foreign military bases by March 1979. During this term of office, Mintoff amended Malta’s constitution to transform the country from a monarchy into a republic; the new constitutional provisions enhanced human rights and introduced electoral safeguards. He expanded the government’s involvement in the economy, including the importation of commodities and manufacturing. He also set up a number of new enterprises and nationalized major business concerns in the banking and telecommunications sectors, many of which were originally in British hands. On the international front, he actively worked for peace in the Mediterranean and drew closer to socialist and nonaligned countries. During the 1973 Helsinki conference, Mintoff single-handedly launched a campaign to include the Mediterranean in the measures being taken to promote peace and security in Europe. Eventually, he found support for the inclusion of a new chapter on security in the Mediterranean in the Helsinki Accords. As relations with Europe improved, however, ties with Libya, Malta’s neighbour to the south, suffered as a result of a dispute over the continental-shelf boundary."
