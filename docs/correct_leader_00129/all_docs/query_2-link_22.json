        "text": "A fiery orator given to exacerbating social divisions at home, when pursuing his political objectives in London he alternated between civilised charm and hysterical abuse. His style ensured that he was reckoned to have set a record for stomping out of political conferences.\n\nHe first came to prominence as deputy leader and minister of reconstruction in Malta’s Labour government elected in 1947. Two years later that government fell when he resigned, fiercely criticising Britain’s parsimony with post-war aid. On becoming prime minister for the first time in 1955, Mintoff devoted three years to seeking integration with the United Kingdom, including representation at Westminster and access to the National Health Service.\n\nWhen this failed — largely because of the hostility of Malta’s powerful Catholic Church to joining an Anglican state — Mintoff called for independence. There were riots, and the Governor suspended the government . Meanwhile, Mintoff’s relations with the Catholic Church worsened, and he and his followers were barred from the sacraments.\n\nHe resigned in 1958 to form the Maltese Liberation Movement, a political group which led the charge for independence. But Labour lost the 1962 election, and Mintoff was forced to watch on, exasperated, as a National Party government amicably obtained dominion status within the Commonwealth two years later. It was not until 1971 that he returned to power, following an uneasy rapprochement with the Church.\n\nHe arrived in Britain to demand more money, and spent a weekend at Chequers discussing a possible defence agreement with Ted Heath . Mintoff insisted that Britain would have to triple the £5 million rent it paid each year for military facilities on Malta, an ultimatum which prompted British forces on the island to begin packing up. Relations between the Maltese leader and Nato were no better, and reached rock-bottom when Mintoff told the alliance’s Secretary-General, Joseph Luns, to “shut up”. The Italian commander of the Nato base on Malta base was sent packing and the American fleet told it could no longer use the island. The forfeited fees were “the wages of sin”, Mintoff said dismissively. But the drawback was a hole in his budget amounting to tens of millions of pounds.\n\nHe had some success in seeking aid and grants, notably with Colonel Gaddafi, but in the end Mintoff fell out with the Libyan leader too . Italy recognised Malta’s neutral status, pledging $95 million in grants and loans over five years, and promising to consider coming to Malta’s help if she should be attacked. The Soviet Union also recognised Maltese neutrality and bought the right to store naval fuel in Nato’s old bunkering facilities; China offered $40 million and an aid programme. “I have been in other communist countries,” declared Mintoff, “and in none of them have I felt that communism is a deeply felt conviction. In China it is.”\n\nIn March 1972, however, Mintoff agreed to bar Warsaw Pact countries from using Malta’s naval facilities, and allow British forces back, in return for £14 million worth of aid a year for seven years, paid by Britain and Nato.\n\nThe deal suited Malta’s 350,000 citizens, who were largely loyal to the Crown, and who had earned the island the George Cross for standing up to fierce wartime bombing. Islanders’ personal sentiment towards the British remained friendly and, for all his anti-British posturing, Mintoff was happy to follow Britain’s example in introducing a state pension and minimum wage schemes. Malta’s health service was widened to include maternity services despite dogged resistance from doctors and the Church, whose wealth and influence over hospitals and education Mintoff constantly attacked.\n\nNone the less, the island’s transformation was irreversible. By the time the last British forces left the island in 1979, Mintoff was able to boast to a New York Times correspondent that when he had regained power in 1971 “we had an English governor-general, an English queen, English currency, a Bank of England man as the head of our central bank. The biggest commercial bank was English entirely, Barclays; our dry docks were run by a British firm, Swan Hunter; our development corporation was run by a chairman who was English.\n\n“We had a police force, which was run by a commissioner, who stated openly that his loyalty was to the British Crown and nobody else. We had an army which was run by a brigadier-general as an appendage of the British Army. We had an agreement with Britain, imposed by Britain before the so-called independence of 1964, whereby the British had the right to acquire any land on the island for defence purposes. Now Malta is a republic. Everything has changed. Nothing is British any more.”\n\nDominic Mintoff was born at Cospicua on August 6 1916, the eldest of a Royal Navy cook’s 11 children . Dom briefly entered a seminary, but is said to have had his scholarship withdrawn after a priest noticed that the family could afford an extravagant wedding feast for one of his sisters.\n\nHe read Science and then Architecture at Malta University, and aged 19 became assistant secretary of the Cospicua Labour Party Club, then, a few months later, general secretary of the national party.\n\nIn 1939 he resigned to take up a Rhodes scholarship at Hertford College, Oxford, where he joined the Fabian Society, met the future Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton and explained that his rosy view of the Commonwealth was not universally shared in Malta. Mintoff worked as a civil engineer until 1944 before returning home to resume the general secretaryship of the Maltese Labour Party and practise as an architect.\n\nFrom the moment Mintoff entered the legislative assembly he was enveloped in controversy. He denied that he had ever been a communist when the hugely influential Archbishop Gonzi challenged him to explain why he had participated in a May Day rally at which The Red Flag was sung and the Pope insulted. On first becoming prime minister, he refused to pay the usual courtesy call on the archbishop, and refused to insist that the position of the Church be entrenched in talks with the British. Another clash with Gonzi involved Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist, which was taken from St John’s co-cathedral to be cleaned in Rome, then placed in a museum instead of back in the church.\n\nWhen Mintoff finally returned to power in 1971 his intolerance of opposition, strident oratory and frequent resort to police powers of arrest ensured that Maltese politics was never peaceable. In 1978 he sacked the entire staff of the island’s hospitals, who went on strike over his demand that free treatment be given to half their patients, and brought in medical staff from Yugoslavia to replace them.\n\nAt election times thugs from the dockyards would beat up individuals and even bomb homes. In 1979 the offices of The Times of Malta were burned down, though the paper was back on the streets the next day. Mintoff said he was sorry; nobody was charged.\n\nAs he was about to retire five years later, he again confronted the Church, forbidding it from charging fees in its network of 72 private schools; he postponed his retirement to deal with the resulting crisis.\n\nIn the end there was a truce, with the government agreeing to consider subsidising the schools after the Church pleaded that it could not afford to implement free education without help from the state treasury.\n\nIn retirement Mintoff remained a troublesome presence on the backbenches until 1998, when he voted against a proposal for a marina in a motion of confidence , and brought down another Labour government.\n\nAfter he left parliament he remained influential. In 2003 he opposed Malta’s application to join the EU. Grandly, he continued to instruct his elderly and reluctant followers to take on missions such as uniting North and South Korea.\n\nWhile declining honours from Britain, Mintoff accepted the Order of the Republic of Libya in 1971; the Grand Cordon of Tunisia in 1973; and the Moroccan Order of Ouissam Alaouite in 1978.\n\nDom Mintoff married, in 1947, Moyra de Vere Bentinck, a distant kinswoman of the Duke of Portland. She lived for many years in England and died in 1997. He is survived by two daughters, one of whom hurled bags of manure into the Commons during a debate on Scottish devolution in 1978."
