Actor Stephen Dunham (né Bowers) is dead at age 48. According to Variety, the cause of death was a heart attack the television actor had suffered a few days earlier, before dying on Sept. 14 at Providence St. Joseph’s Hospital in Burbank, Calif.

Dunham was a prolific actor who appeared on a number of television shows, including ABC's "Hot Properties," "Just Shoot Me!" and, perhaps most memorably, "DAG," on which he played Edward Pillows. He also made appearances in the films "The Mummy" and "Monster-in-Law." He will appear posthumously as part of a wedded couple in the upcoming "Paranormal Activity 4" with his real-life wife, actress Alexondra Lee.

Lee and Dunham had been married since 2005; the pair met while acting in 1999's ABC college comedy, "Oh Grow Up," created by Alan Ball. The Hollywood Reporter reports Dunham's family is asking that donations be made in honor of Dunham to the National Brain Tumor Society or Kiva.org.
