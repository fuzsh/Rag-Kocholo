        "text": "Paul C. Dunham passed away peacefully at the age of 87 in Helena, Montana on January 26, 2019. He was the loving and devoted husband of the late Margaret Dunham, who passed away in December of 2012.\n\nHe was born in Corinna, Maine in 1931 and grew up with humble beginnings in Vermont. Paul and his brother and sisters happily survived for many years without running water or electricity, spending their time gathering firewood, collecting sap for maple syrup and doing odd jobs to help out. He graduated from Montpelier High School in 1949, all the while working on various farms in the morning and a drug store after school. In 1950, he joined the National Guard and was eventually called to active duty in the Army 43rd Infantry Division and was shipped to Germany as part of the occupation forces. He completed his duty in 1952 as a Sergeant and returned to Vermont. His friend took him to see the dean of the University of Vermont, who invited him to enroll. He graduated with a BA in 1959 and a MA in 1963, both in political science.\n\nPaul eventually worked in the chancellor’s office at the University of Maine as the director for institutional research. He was at the forefront of computer technology at that time and used mainframes to automate many tasks at the university. With his friend Irv, he started the first credit union for the U of Maine. In 1976, he moved his family to Helena where he worked for the Office of the Commissioner for the Montana University Systems. He concluded his career as the computer center manager for the Montana Higher Education Student Assistance Corporation, finally retiring in 1994.\n\nIn retirement, Paul kept busy with a variety of activities. He was very active in genealogy and helped to start the Dunham-Singletary Family Connections group. He also volunteered at the Lewis & Clark Library. He and Margaret participated in several local square dance groups and travelled to square dance events around Montana. He enjoyed the outdoors, particularly hiking, running and camping. He travelled around the country to spend time with his children and grandchildren, and enjoyed playing cribbage and going to sporting events with his friends Dave and Steve.\n\nPaul is survived by his children Barbara (Kathleen) and Bruce (Diane); four grandchildren, Emilie, Audrey, Finnegan and Gwendolyn; and his sister Fay Tucker. In addition to his wife, he is pre-deceased by his brother John, and sisters Alice and Suzie.\n\nA Reception honoring Paul is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Tuesday, March 5, 2019 in the Social Hall of Anderson Stevenson Wilke Funeral Home, 3750 N. Montana Ave. Burial with Military Honors will follow the reception at the Montana State veterans Cemetery, Ft. Harrison, MT. Donations in lieu of flowers can be made in Paul’s name to the Food Share of Helena (helenafoodshare.org) or the Intermountain Children’s Home (www.intermountainresidential.org).
