        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n♪♪ Lincoln: ♪ Spread the word, spread the gospel ♪ ♪ Let the congregation know ♪ ♪ That a cornet was the downfall ♪ ♪ Of the walls of Jericho ♪ ♪ Spread the word, spread the gospel ♪ I made a movie called \"The Girl Can't Help It\" with Jayne Mansfield and, um, Little Richard, and Fats Domino.\n\n♪ Revival meeting, spread the... ♪ In a dress that Marilyn Monroe wore in a movie called \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\"\n\nWell, what does that make me?\n\nI would wear this dress and go places and I'd open the show or whatever, and my breasts would be bouncing around -- I'd run on the stage.\n\nFalk: She was a chanteuse, sexy dresses, she rolled around on the piano.\n\nShe was a pretty face.\n\nShe more or less ran from that image.\n\nAnd she ran to the role of a truth teller.\n\nLincoln: I saw myself as beautiful, but I didn't see myself as an imitation of anybody but an original.\n\n♪ Choppin' cotton, don't be slow ♪ ♪ Better finish out your row ♪ And I found songs that would express what was in my heart.\n\n♪ Keep a movin' with that plow ♪ Falk: She told me, she said, \"You know what I did with that dress?\n\nI threw it in a furnace.\"\n\nI said, \"Well why?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding?\n\nI'm not wearing some white woman's hand-me-downs!\"\n\nLincoln: What is most important to me is being free of the shackles that chain me.\n\n♪ Freedom day ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Keys: Black women entertainers -- they blazed such a trail... Jim: I hear that you're a big star now.\n\nSelina: Yes, I'm doing nicely, thank you.\n\nKeys: When I think of all these women, I think of such credible human beings who really stood for equality and justice.\n\nAnd that is in the spirit of activism and the way that art and politics all crossed.\n\nSimone: ♪ Somebody save me ♪ Tillet: Oftentimes they're forgotten, and yet these artists are the most influential and oftentimes the most vanguard performers in American culture.\n\nBerry: These women were pioneers in the industry.\n\nThey were making a way out of no way.\n\nThey actually had careers in a time when they really weren't supposed to have careers.\n\nTyson: Nathan!\n\nFeldstein: Some are musicians, some are more famous on TV, some through films, but they all took risks, and they engaged with Black freedom struggles in terms of the ways in which they represented Blackness on screen, on stage, in music, in their lyrics, their choices of clothing, their choices of hairstyles.\n\nRhimes: This moment right here, me standing up here and my Thursday night of network television full of women of color, that could only be happening right now.\n\nHow many women had to hit that glass before the first crack appeared?\n\nHow many cuts did they get?\n\nHow many bruises?\n\nHow hard did they have to hit the ceiling?\n\nTillet: All of these artists have been carving out a space for themselves in an industry that's still not quite ready to hear what they're saying or performing or singing.\n\nThey had to create the space for themselves to be heard.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Carroll: I lived in New York and I was in the Village a lot.\n\nI loved being in the Village.\n\nIt was all so multiracial, and people mixed and mingled with less fear, less anxiety -- what the world should be.\n\nEverything was based upon something you could do, not what you looked like.\n\nFeldstein: Women entertainers were particularly important in New York City in interracial subcultures based in Harlem and the Village where this idea that activism and entertainment could come together in these exciting ways.\n\nKernodle: Greenwich Village becomes this cultural, musical, artistic enclave beginning as early as the 1930s.\n\nBut then it also becomes this incubator of progressive political ideologies.\n\nHorne: ♪ I can't give you ♪ ♪ Anything but love, baby ♪ Waithe: Someone asked if I was named after Lena Dunham, and I said \"No, I'm named for Lena Horne.\"\n\nHorne: ♪ Baby ♪ Waithe: When my mom was pregnant, she saw Lena Horne on TV.\n\nShe knew if she was having a girl, that she would want them to have the same amount of, uh, class and grace as Lena had.\n\nAnd I do everything I can to try to live up to that.\n\nHorne: ♪ There's honey in the honeycomb ♪ Jackson: My God, she was a goddess.\n\nShe was -- she was someone who I just thought existed sort of in the ether as just this angelic beauty.\n\nBuckley: She was a singer.\n\nShe was, uh, an activist.\n\nShe was a forerunner.\n\nShe was an international superstar.\n\n♪ Horne: ♪ In me ♪ [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ Buckley: In 1933, my mother went into the Cotton Club knowing how to -- vaguely -- how to dance and sing.\n\n♪♪ Her mother decided she could do better and spirited her away from the Cotton Club to, uh, Boston to sing with Noble Sissle, and he changed her image from the Cotton Club chorus girl to a torch singer -- that was sort of the style of the day.\n\nFinally, she got a job at that kept her in New York at Café Society.\n\nKernodle: One of the central entities that defines Greenwich Village is Café Society, the night club that is created in the late 1930s.\n\nBuckley: It was the only integrated night club outside of Harlem.\n\nIt was started to raise money for the Communist Party.\n\nIt was sort of radical chic in its day.\n\nIt was full of showbiz people, and celebrities, and socialite people, but also Communists.\n\nSo, my mother got a political education.\n\nHorne: I began to thrive.\n\nI was introduced to great writers, and painters, actors, and intellectuals.\n\nPeople like Langston Hughes, and Orson Welles, Billie Holiday, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington.\n\n♪♪ Kernodle: We also have the great Hazel Scott, who is oftentimes excluded from these conversations of civil rights who's performing there.\n\n♪♪ Tillet: That's where Billie Holiday famously premieres \"Strange Fruit.\"\n\nHoliday: ♪ Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze ♪ ♪ Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees ♪ Feldstein: Lena Horne later talked about that as a time of awakening for her.\n\nHorne: I met Paul Robeson, who became a part of my life.\n\nRegester: Paul Robeson was a renowned Black intellectual and as he became more, uh, disconcerted with the politics of America and he became a kind of international figure, his political beliefs and views certainly influenced Lena Horne.\n\nInterviewer: Mr. Robeson, have you come back from Moscow still a convinced Communist?\n\nRobeson: I don't see how you can ask me that.\n\nHow do you know am a Communist?\n\nNobody else knows.\n\nInterviewer: What are your political opinions?\n\nHave they been changed at all?\n\nRobeson: My political opinions about the Soviet Union have only been deepened.\n\nI believe in socialism, the hope of the future.\n\nFeldstein: Robeson was enormously influential in terms of the ways in which he modeled being an activist entertainer.\n\nAnd that he showed other artists and performers that one could mesh activism and political commitments with their artistry.\n\nHorne: He says, \"You're a Negro and that is the whole basis of what you feel and it's the basis of what you will become.\"\n\nAnd he gave me identity -- he grounded me.\n\nFeldstein: Abbey Lincoln's career started very much in the mold that Lena Horne had established several decades earlier.\n\nVery sexualized, glamorous, singing these popular hits.\n\nShe moved to New York -- she became more invested in changing her musical style.\n\nShe became more invested in jazz vocals and she also became more interested in Black politics.\n\nLincoln: Well, I came to New York and met all these people -- you know, these writers, painters, musicians - who told me why it was, every time I would go to a city, I'd find my relatives, the people that I represented, living in hovels and they didn't have anything, you know?\n\nI thought, I said, \"Why is this?\n\nWhat is this?\"\n\nAnd they said, \"Oh, this is because of this, and because of that, and because of that.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Okay, well, we have to fix it then.\"\n\nKernodle: She ends up in the '50s in this progressive scene that's being refueled.\n\nSome of that political culture, some of that political energy is being reformed in these different nightclubs.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Kernodle: In 1960, Nina Simone becomes a part of this nexus of artists and activists and writers and political leaders that are meeting in New York.\n\nTillet: She's in a community of people who are from many margins, and that kind of gives her a different courage to be a different kind of artist.\n\nKeys: I'll never forget the first time I played at Montreux Jazz Festival.\n\nThe guy who had run the festival since, you know, it started; he has an archive of every person that's ever touched the stage.\n\nSo, he said, \"Who do you want to see?\"\n\nAnd I was like, \"I have to see Nina.\"\n\nAnd I just watched her riveted in this little theater, like, her playing this piano.\n\nAnd I was like, \"I'm never gonna play again because I'm never gonna be as good as her.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] Tillet: Nina Simone was born Eunice Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina, and she was discovered at a very young age to be a musical prodigy.\n\nHer family moves to Philadelphia all in the attempt to audition for the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and she's rejected.\n\nWas it because she wasn't good enough?\n\nWas it because she was a woman?\n\nWas it because she was Black?\n\nThe answer to that is unknown.\n\nHeartbroken, she had to reinvent herself.\n\nShe gigs in Atlantic City.\n\nHer mother is a very religious figure, so she doesn't want her mom to know she's playing jazz.\n\nSo, she takes on this name, \"Nina Simone,\" after the French actress Simone Signoret.\n\nShe was seen as kind of exceptional from the very beginning of her career.\n\n♪♪ Kernodle: And she comes under the influence of James Baldwin, and Lorraine Hansberry, as well as Miriam Makeba and Abbey Lincoln.\n\nTillet: These figures were known as, like, Civil Rights writers, right?\n\nLorraine Hansberry's, uh, famous play, \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" uh, Baldwin is writing scathing criticisms, um, like \"The Fire Next Time.\"\n\nShe has a -- a cool quote about Lorraine Hansberry that they were talking about, like, Marx and Lenin and revolution.\n\nYou know, girl stuff, right?\n\n♪♪ Pierce: I always taught my daughter if she wanted to know something, don't ask the Internet.\n\nFind the smartest person in the room.\n\nLewis: When we see Black women on -- in film and in television, the first thing that happens is we applaud.\n\nWe made it, we're being actually seen.\n\nYou know, the second thing that happens, I think for myself, is an analysis happens.\n\nHow are we being portrayed?\n\nWhen I see Black women in any kind of TV or film, it's an act of protest because I know how long and how hard you have to fight to even get there.\n\nHorne: ♪ Don't know why ♪ ♪ There's no sun up in the sky ♪ ♪ Stormy weather ♪ ♪ Since my man and I ain't together ♪ Buckley: She arrived in Hollywood the same time that Walter White arrived in Hollywood to speak to Hollywood producers to ask them to change the stereotypes in Hollywood, and they agreed.\n\nHorne: They began to talk about me being at the studio.\n\nSo, I called my father.\n\n'Cause my father, he was tough, hard-working provider.\n\nHe was a gangster.\n\nHe was in what we used to call \"sporting life.\"\n\nBuckley: Walter White and her father convinced her that she could change the image of Black women in Hollywood.\n\nHorne: Suffice to say he came to Hollywood the next day and I arranged a meeting with him with L.B.\n\nMayer.\n\nAnd my dad walks in -- and he's sharp -- you know, he was.\n\nAnd he had on a diamond stick pin but a very conservative dark suit.\n\nAnd he said, \"Mr. Mayer, it's a great privilege you're offering my daughter,\" he says, \"But, I can buy my own daughter her own maid.\"\n\nHe was just jivin', you understand.\n\n\"I don't want her to be insulted.\n\nI -- it's very nice, but she's not going to be in a 'Tarzan' picture and run around in a leopard skin.\"\n\nWell, my father was from -- [ Laughs ] And I don't think Mr. Mayer had ever been approached by a Black man like that.\n\nSo, he just sat and he said, \"Oh, well, Mr. Horne, we wouldn't do anything to -- to -- to --\" And of course, remember in 1940 the NAACP was trying to break the union out there to get Black cameramen, get Black people on the sets.\n\nBuckley: She was definitely a pioneer in her day because Black women represented -- had been represented on screen mostly in demeaning roles.\n\nMammy: If you don't care what folks says about this family, I does!\n\nI's told you and told you, they can always tell a lady by the way that she eats in front of folks like a bird.\n\nI ain't aiming for you... Stewart: The Mammy, who I think, um, you know, many of us might immediately bring to mind Hattie McDaniel as the character named Mammy in \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\n-Scarlett: Oh!\n\n-Mammy: Just hold on!\n\nAnd suck in!\n\nStewart: So if you think about that iconic image of Hattie McDaniel tying up the corset of Scarlett O'Hara, the Mammy is, um, completely devoted to perpetuating white womanhood.\n\nHattie McDaniel, first Academy award-winning role for a Black actor.\n\nMcDaniel: I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry.\n\nLewis: I remember the first time seeing \"Gone with the Wind,\" and I remember thinking, \"Oh, my gosh, I want to be Scarlett O'Hara.\n\nHattie McDaniel didn't even play in my consciousness because the message that got infiltrated was to be a Black woman who is dark and poor is a negative thing, and it is not something to aspire or to relate to.\n\nJackson: Seeing Butterfly McQueen and Hattie McDaniel.\n\nSeeing Stepin Fetchit wasn't confusing to me.\n\nI mean, I knew white people had this image of us as being shuffling and lazy.\n\nKeys: The level of stereotyping has been through the roof.\n\nSo blatant and so obvious.\n\nCaptain Eli: Holy Moses!\n\nDr. Pearly: Moses nothing!\n\nSay that's Jonah!\n\nJonah: I worked for the doctor, and I just -- Captain Eli: Well, come on out of there now.\n\nAin't nobody gonna harm you.\n\nWhat you doin' in there?\n\nJonah: Nothin'.\n\nI was just -- thought you -- thought I was Mr.\n\nProfessor, and I -- Stewart: The scholar Donald Bogle wrote a book called \"Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies & Bucks.\"\n\nThe movies did not invent these stereotypes.\n\nThey came from much older traditions of representing Black people across media and literature and theater.\n\nAnd the movies just picked up on those things, but then I think also really amplified them and circulated them more broadly.\n\n♪♪ Patsy: ♪ I got to black my face ♪ ♪ Put on a stovepipe hat ♪ Jim: ♪ On the February morn ♪ ♪ A tiny baby boy was born ♪ Warden: Well, thank you boys!\n\nHere's my card.\n\nAny time you're up my way, drop in.\n\nSimonpillai: You need to look at the foundations of film, right?\n\nLike, the foundations of film are much like the foundations of America.\n\nLike, in the same way that America was built on slavery, film was built on racist imagery.\n\nThe film that is largely credited as teaching us how to make films is \"Birth of a Nation.\"\n\nThis was D. W. Griffith's epic recreation of the Civil War era.\n\nIt's a movie that was built off the racist imagery from society.\n\nBut it then, in turn, fed society by -- by inspiring the second coming of the KKK.\n\nHorne: In any case, I became the first Black to be signed to a long-term contract.\n\nSeven years.\n\nThey said, \"Well, now, you are in a very representative position and you must make sure that you handle yourself circumspectly so that you don't embarrass other Black women.\"\n\nThat was a heavy load, you know?\n\nSimonpillai: Progress in Hollywood comes in waves, okay?\n\nLike it always -- it's always baby steps and it comes in waves, right?\n\nSo, they saw Lena Horne as kind of the new -- the new hope.\n\nRegester: Why Lena Horne managed to negotiate this contract with the Hollywood industry, was a result of the fact that African Americans had contributed to World War II.\n\nAnd they realized that because of the Black contributions, that the country was changing.\n\nAnd so, they were gonna have to compromise in terms of the demands that Blacks were making and expecting in view of their contributions to the war effort.\n\nFeldstein: For Lena Horne to say, \"No, I will not play maids onscreen,\" was to reject all of these deeply entrenched historical stereotypes of African American women.\n\nShe was saying, \"No, I can be another kind of performer.\n\nI can offer a different kind of representation.\"\n\nHorne: ♪ We could be messin' round ♪ ♪ But you is digressin' round ♪ ♪ While I'm tossin' nature at your feet ♪ My signing this contract and their hearing that I would not do certain kind of work, got me into a lot of trouble with Black actors.\n\nStewart: This could actually seem really problematic for the Black actors who had been working in Hollywood for decades, who felt as though, you know, they were doing the work that was available to them.\n\n[ Bell ringing ] ♪♪ Buckley: They feared that her contract would then make it difficult for all Black performers.\n\n-Jim: Oh, Mamie!\n\n-Mamie: Coming!\n\nBuckley: If she refused to be a servant, then they wouldn't have any more servant parts.\n\nStewart: Actors like Hattie McDaniel, uh, could feel some kind of way about Lena Horne entering Hollywood, ostensibly, to improve the image of the Negro; well, then, like, what does that say about what Hattie McDaniel has been doing?\n\nHorne: They very fact that I was one of the first, you know, I was isolated right away because there was no niche for me.\n\nI was in the middle.\n\nGray, you see.\n\nThis pale thing.\n\n♪ In sunny Puerto Rico ♪ ♪ We drink floats of rum and clico ♪ ♪ While our favorite houseboy Chico ♪ ♪ Shakes the rhythm of the spin ♪ Berry: Lena Horne was the first woman of color I ever saw in a movie ever.\n\nAnd I had the immediate reaction of saying, \"Is she Black or is she white?\"\n\nI was a little confused.\n\nAnd that's when I got the first lesson on a drop of Black blood makes you Black, and you should understand that right now.\n\nHorne: ♪ It was just one of those things ♪ The first movie that I was in at MGM was called \"Panama Hattie.\"\n\n♪ We have been aware ♪ ♪ That our love affair was too hot ♪ \"Who's the new Latin singer?\"\n\neverybody was asking.\n\nWell, MGM may have wanted to pass me off as Latin, but when my own people accused me of trying to pass, I was furious, and I felt more isolated than ever.\n\nThey said, uh, um, \"Why don't you be Latin?\n\nPass as Latin.\"\n\nI mean, you know, \"you don't -- don't look colored,\" and all that kind of nonsense.\n\nCavett: That was always meant to be a compliment for you?\n\nHorne: That was meant to be a big compliment, see.\n\nSo anyway... [ Laughter ] By the time they put dark makeup on me to make match the darker actors that I was working with, all they had was teeth.\n\nBuckley: Then they said, \"Okay.\n\nMax Factor was the genius.\"\n\nSo, he invented a new color pancake makeup called \"Light Egyptian,\" which they put on mother, and they put on everybody who ever played a jungle princess after that.\n\nHedy Lamarr wore it.\n\nEverybody wore it.\n\nHorne: ♪ Oh, listen, sister ♪ Buckley: My mother wanted very much to play Julie in \"Show Boat\" because she'd sung some of Julie's songs in \"Ziegfeld Follies.\"\n\nHorne: ♪ Can't help lovin' that man of mine ♪ Feldstein: Lena Horne was particularly attracted to it because she, herself, was a light-skinned Black woman singer and the fictional character was as well.\n\nHorne: So, when they were casting the movie many years later, I hoped I would be chosen for the part.\n\nFeldstein: MGM felt it was too big of a risk to cast a light-skinned

Lena Horne was, it is worth thinking about what her career might have been if this door and other doors hadn't been shut to her.\n\nBuckley: My mother could've played that part, but Hollywood was nervous.\n\nThey were always nervous about race because of the Southern market, which was their biggest market.\n\nAnd Southerners just slashed any movie that had a Black in it that wasn't playing a servant.\n\nAnd it was Hollywood's way of, of saying, \"Look, we're not racist.\n\nWe have this Black star.\n\nBut at the same time, we don't do anything with her.\"\n\nJoe: You know I still love

track.\n\nBuckley: There were only two movies that she ever had speaking parts in: \"Cabin in the Sky\" and \"Stormy Weather,\" and they helped make her famous.\n\nSimonpillai: Like, here's MGM doing

Saturday.\n\nWe had two movie theaters that were specifically Black in Chattanooga because we couldn't go to the other theaters anyway.\n\nSo, I went to The Liberty or The Grand, which were on diagonal corners from each other.\n\nSo, I saw movies in that particular way.\n\nHorne: The censors, they took out a beautiful scene I did when, when I take a bubble bath in \"Cabin in the

here, starting now ♪ ♪ Honey, everything's coming up roses ♪ Feldstein: Diahann Carroll came of age professionally, um, with this aura of glamour around her, and the parts that she played reinforced that.\n\nShe won the Tony Award for \"No Strings\" in which she played the part of a model.\n\nCarroll: I wanted this.\n\nI'm like Abe Burrows, I really wanted this.\n\nInterviewer: I know inevitably you will be and probably are already compared with Lena Horne.\n\nDoes this bother you at all?\n\nCarroll: I suppose it does on the same basis that any young artist hopes to carve out their own niche and, uh, not suffer through comparisons, but I don't mind the comparison because to me Lena Horne is one of the greatest performers in the world.\n\nSo being compared to that caliber is kind of, very nice.\n\nJackson: She's this iconic, kind of, figure that still maintains part of that Hollywood mystique.\n\nUh, and she was around when Hollywood stars were bigger than life and more mysterious than magic.\n\nAnd she's created a sort of niche that a lot of young actresses don't even realize: the ingenue, the gorgeous, kind of smart, sexy woman that could entice people of all races, you know, not just -- not just the brothers.\n\nCarroll: In the United States, as well as here, there are very few Negroes employed in -- in television drama and in movies.\n\nAnd I would like to do more, as I'm sure many other young Negro actors and actresses would like to do, but the job opportunities are très few.\n\nLewis: You look at an actress like Diahann Carroll, light-skinned, beautiful, and she still was not able to have the opportunities that her white counterparts had.\n\nFeldstein: In 1962, congressman Adam Clayton Powell convened hearings to address racial discrimination in the entertainment industries, and Diahann Carroll was among the Black luminaries that testified.\n\nIt's kind of hard for us to imagine now.\n\nThey were not recorded; they were not televised.\n\nThe white mainstream press barely wrote a word about it, even though the African American press covered it extensively.\n\nWoman: I am living proof of the horror of discrimination because when you consider how little employment I have had, in the field of television and Broadway, and yet being as well-known as I am, I have been discriminated because of my color.\n\nMan: Here is the brightest star on Broadway, a girl who virtually made \"No Strings,\" all the critics have said so -- yet, you have only worked twice in seven and a half years?\n\nIf they made a film of \"No Strings,\" they would probably get a white girl and darken her up.\n\nFeldstein: It's a little bit ironic because the erasure of the hearings brings even more attention to the fact of why Adam Clayton Powell was motivated to have these hearings in the first place.\n\nIt was to talk about the absence of Black people in Hollywood industries.\n\nLewis: You often hear about people talk about the gatekeepers in Hollywood, they're the ones that decide how wide the gate's gonna be opened, and how much they're gonna close the gate.\n\nBut the thing for Black people is that there's always less of us allowed through.\n\nWaithe: You can't deny that there are fair-skinned Black actresses that just have more opportunities than actresses that are -- that are brown-skinned.\n\nAnd that's just a fact.\n\nInterviewer: It seems a number of times in -- in your life and career, you have been, quote unquote, \"The first Black woman to...\" do one thing or another.\n\nDid that bother you?\n\nDid you like that?\n\nCarroll: No, I don't mind, I really don't mind.\n\nI know why it happens to me, as opposed to happen-- happening to others, and I think it is because God put me together in a way that is more acceptable to the white community, \"Oh, it's not such a major chance, let's take it with Diahann.\"\n\nAnd -- and that does not make me feel proud of the white community.\n\nWaithe: I get these lists of actors that, you know, that studios and networks deem more profitable, or... or feel as if it can help get the movie greenlit.\n\nAnd very rarely are there brown-skinned women at the top of those lists.\n\nRoss: When it comes to getting jobs, light is better to certain people that are hiring.\n\nUm, you know, that's why, not to take away from the other women, you know Diahann Carroll, Lena Horne, they're at a -- they're a different thought to me.\n\nUm, they are not in the same realm because I am not going to be like a Diahann Carroll, you know.\n\nI am a brown woman and I have a whole other kind of situation that I'm going to have to deal with in life.\n\nDr. Copeland: Portia?\n\nAre you drunk?\n\nPortia: No.\n\nI been trying mighty hard, but I ain't been able to make it...\n\nYet.\n\nBerry: Someone like Cicely Tyson didn't fit into that mold, and she was, um, accepted for her talent alone.\n\nAnd it wasn't about her physicality or what she looked like, or if she fit into that box or not.\n\nAnd I think that gave, um, a pathway to women that didn't fit in that box to also be respected, and to be found beautiful in their own right, and not be defined by this white American's version of what beauty is.\n\nKeys: Yeah, Cicely Tyson.\n\nI mean, obviously she's been a part of some of the most incredible films of all time.\n\nBut what I remember the most is meeting her, and I was immediately drawn to her.\n\nThat gorgeous skin in this most magnificent queen face, and this tiny body, by the way -- very small woman.\n\nAnd spirit like, \"Bam!\"\n\nFeldstein: In 1961, one of Cicely Tyson's first big performances was in a play called \"The Blacks.\"\n\nShe was very committed to portraying her character, you know, accurately and with dignity.\n\nAnd I think that was a defining thing for Tyson and remains so to this day.\n\n-Flo: May I sit, please?\n\n-Elizabeth: Yes, yes please.\n\nFeldstein: Where she chooses her parts so carefully, infusing her roles with a realism and a believability.\n\nRoss: Cicely Tyson stood out to me because she was brown skinned.\n\nSo, I'm like \"Okay, she's like me,\" you know?\n\nAnd then she was also becoming characters that were not stereotypes, they were real people.\n\nThey were people with emotion, with heart.\n\nThey weren't always pretty people; they were just real.\n\nWaithe: I think that we need to level the playing field so that way the best person for the job is who gets it.\n\nBut it really is -- it's tricky.\n\nI mean, you cannot -- These days, if you cast a light-skinned woman, Black Twitter is coming for you.\n\nUh, but then somebody could also argue if you're a lighter skinned actress, and you want an opportunity, are you paying for the sins of those

lifetime member of the NAACP when she was two, so she had a sense of activism her entire life and never gave up on it, even when she was, um, criticized for it.\n\nMy mother started off the '60s with a bang.\n\nShe was in The Luau restaurant in Hollywood.\n\nShe was sitting up in the balcony at the restaurant, and she heard a little commotion down below.\n\nA drunken man called, \"Waiter, waiter!\"\n\nAnd the waiter said, \"I'll be with you, I just have to serve Ms.\n\nHorne.\"\n\nHorne: And he said, \"Who the hell is Lena Horne?\n\nWho does she think she is?\n\nShe's just another\" -- n-word -- \"just like all the rest of them.\"\n\nAnd I got so mad I picked up a lamp off the table, I threw that first.\n\nI picked up three other ash trays -- glass ones -- and I threw them at him, and he began to bleed down the side of his head.\n\nAnd the people over on his side of the room were looking.\n\nNobody touched me 'cause I was furious.\n\nAnd sometimes your madness just mounts into,

\"My God, I'm not alone.\"\n\nI had lived a long time without that feeling.\n\nI even got one from Joe Louis who said, \"I always said you had a great right arm!\"\n\nFeldstein: This woman who had

ways.\n\nFalk: For example, uh, when Patrice Lumumba was involved in the coup d'état and Mobutu Sese Seko overthrew the government.\n\nWell, Abbey Lincoln and other Black entertainers as well as Black

we're going to do.\n\nJulia: Has Mr. Colton told you?\n\nDr. Chegley: Told me what?\n\nJulia: I'm colored?\n\nDr. Chegley: What color are you?\n\nJulia: I'm a Negro.\n\nDr. Chegley: Have you always been a Negro, or are you just trying to be fashionable?\n\n[ She laughs ] Stewart: Diahann Carroll -- she has this quality of refinement that really helps to explain why it is that she was the one who was cast in the role of \"Julia,\" this first, you know, uh, television program centered on, you know, a Black woman lead character.\n\n[ Door buzzer ] All: Merry Christmas, Julia!\n\nJulia: Merry Christmas!\n\nCarroll: Julia was a nice lady who had a little boy, lost her husband during the war.\n\nSmart.\n\nGreat sense of humor.\n\nShe was great fun to play too.\n\nThe fact that Julia was a nurse in a huge hospital that had all sorts of people of many races, colors, and... but it was maybe something that the American audience had not, uh, seen before.\n\nDr. Chegley: And besides, when you go on a trip like that, there are too many things to do to get ready.\n\nThere are plane tickets, hotel reservations...\n\nCar rental.\n\n-Julia: Car rental.\n\nFeldstein: Julia lived in this integrated, middle-class neighborhood in California.\n\nShe was really, um, not only integrating the show, but she was integrating the living rooms of the white people who would be watching the show.\n\nMrs. Bennett: Mrs. Baker, I've been a very stupid woman.\n\nYou've opened my eyes.\n\nI hope you can open your heart enough to forgive me.\n\n[ Knocking at door ] Stewart: There was a lot of criticism of the way that the show did not take up social and political issues.\n\nJulia is not shown picketing and protesting.\n\nShe's not, you know, putting her son to bed and then going to a Black Panther rally.\n\nMan: I do not object to white people being in the cast.\n\nWhat I do object to is selecting the Black cast from people who are so white oriented, that everyone has a white mentality.\n\nWoman: Your show is geared to the white audience, with no knowledge of the realness of normal Negro people.\n\nJulia is unreal.\n\nTo repeat again, Julia is no Negro woman.\n\nCarroll: Some of the criticism of course was valid, but that's not what we were doing.\n\nAnd we were of a mind that, that was a different show.\n\nWe were allowed to have this show.\n\nWe were allowed to put this point of view on the air.\n\nWe were allowed to have a comedy about a Black middle-class family.\n\nStewart: And then, we get into a lot of debates about realism.\n\nYou know, like, uh, how -- how much can we expect, you know, white writers, producers, to develop worlds for Black characters, worlds that they don't know?\n\nFoxx: Here's what I said.\n\nNow, this is logic to me.\n\n-Carroll: Okay.\n\n-Foxx: Here we have a beautiful nurse, wearing a $300 gown.\n\nAnd I just said, \"She got to be selling dope out the hospital to folk.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] [ Applause ] Carroll: You so bad, I love you anyway!\n\nHe is just so bad!\n\nI think everyone was very proud that they put \"Julia\" together and put it on the air.\n\nAnd the reception was wonderful, we had great ratings.\n\nRichardson: I thought that \"Julia,\" because it was such a popular show, was going to catapult that whole -- whole situation -- the genre of -- of Black women in those professional positions, that you would have seen more of that.\n\nBut it didn't happen, you know?\n\nLewis: In the 1960s, you saw the gates open again, and that was pressure from the NAACP saying, \"You need to see us.\"\n\nAnd the white creators created \"Julia.\"\n\nAnd so, there was a little bit of space.\n\nIt did well.\n\nPeople enjoyed it.\n\nThere was a little bit of controversy, and the gate shut again.\n\nBerry: The reality is there are not a lot of parts for leading ladies, for women of color.\n\nWe really have to get behind the scenes and create these projects and tell our stories for ourselves.\n\nTyson: We are not just considered actresses.\n\nFor instance, I would be up for the same role as Jane Fonda if I were considered an actress rather than a Black actress, which limits my ability to work.\n\nFeldstein: From the start of her career, Cicely Tyson was very, very selective about what parts she would and wouldn't accept.\n\nHer support for civil rights came through the ways in which she performed Black womanhood.\n\nTyson: I have the reputation in my business for working every few years.\n\nAnd it's every two or three years when a role comes along that appeals to me, uh, that speaks for me, that deals with what I would like to project to my audiences.\n\nHopkins: ♪ Will you come by here ♪ ♪ Now is the needed time ♪ ♪ Oh, now.. ♪ Lewis: When I saw \"Sounder\" with

drink ice cold whiskey, and shoot the breeze!\n\nNathan: Well, I hope you told him I's too busy for that kind of stuff?\n\n[ Both laugh ] Lewis: It was Black love.\n\nIt was beautiful.\n\nIt was political because we weren't allowed to have that.\n\nWe weren't given the freedom to actually be full human beings, and Cicely Tyson brought that to us.\n\n♪♪ Rebecca Oh, my God!\n\nIt's Nathan!\n\nNathan!\n\nRichardson: She was amazing.\n\nHer running, just, her acting had such breath in it that I think we realized that you could actually blow it out of the water.\n\nEarl: Daddy!\n\n♪♪ Richardson: There's something about us that always made us want to close in.\n\nAnd it was because of how we had been treated.\n\nCicely was like, \"Let's open it up!\"\n\nLet's break it all open.\n\nTyson: This happened in Los Angeles, and this was a journalist who said to me, \"I'm glad I saw the movie, Cicely, because I never really thought that a Black man and woman could relate to each other that way.\n\nI thought that the thing that existed between them was just a lust or a sex; that they never really had love.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"You know what you're saying?\n\nYou're saying that we're not human beings.\n\nShe said, \"The only way I get my education is through the film media, through books, and through one or two Black people that I meet in business.\n\nBut I don't really know them, so I don't know their lifestyle.\n\nI don't know what their home life is like.\"\n\nWell, in that case, then, it's serving as an education to many whites.\n\nKeys: There's nothing more powerful than being able to speak the truth of what you're living.\n\nWhen it's not easy, by the way, to stand for stuff.\n\nTo stand up in front of all these people telling you that, you know, \"You shouldn't, you couldn't, you wouldn't.\n\nThey'll kill you.\n\nYou won't have a career.\n\nYou won't feed your family.\"\n\nYou know, it is not easy.\n\n♪♪ Buckley: My mother realized that she wasn't going to go far in Hollywood, so nightclubs were really where it was going to be for her.\n\nHorne: I had hoped for a while to have my own television series.\n\nBut the time wasn't ripe yet for that.\n\nAnd so, it made me begin to think that probably it would never happen.\n\nFeldstein: She couldn't really advance in Hollywood because she became more increasingly associated with the Left.\n\nAnd so that proved particularly problematic for her and she was blacklisted.\n\nBuckley: \"Red Channels\" was published by a man who was the biggest black-lister in Hollywood.\n\nAnd he put out this booklet in which he listed all of the actors and actresses and performers who he thought were Communist sympathizers.\n\nIn those days if you were even listed, you were considered a communist.\n\nAnd she did not make a movie for six years.\n\nThe nightclub bosses wanted her off the blacklist.\n\nWhat you had to do was you had to write a letter to this union.\n\nThis union was mobbed up.\n\nMy mother wrote saying she was not a communist and that Paul Robeson had not influenced her politics even though he was a family friend, and that she would not give up speaking out for her race, but certainly would not get involved with any Communist organizations.\n\nAnd then she had to go and see a man called George Sokolsky in New York, who was a big right-wing columnist.\n\nAnd he could clear you.\n\nIt was all crooked.\n\nHe said to her, \"Well, I'm sure these are all your youthful indiscretions, and you're cleared.\"\n\nAnd she got cleared.\n\nShe saved her career.\n\n♪♪

lambasted the album and accused Lincoln of being a \"Professional Negro,\" infusing jazz too much with politics and really deriding her for that reason.\n\nAnnouncer: Downbeat conducted a roundtable discussion to air the situation.\n\nMuch of the following conversation revolved around Gitler's review of Abbey Lincoln's album \"Straight Ahead.\"\n\nLincoln: It's impossible for me to be a professional Negro because I am a Black woman.\n\nGitler: I meant by that, using the fact that you were a Negro to exploit a career, in particular -- -Lincoln: Exploit a career?\n\nHow can I sing as a Black woman, as a Negro, if I don't exploit the fact that I'm a Negro?\n\nGitler: Yes, but I thought you were overdoing it.\n\nKernodle: They attack her in a way they cannot attack Max Roach.\n\nRoach: If anybody has a right to exploit the Negro, it's the Negro.\n\nGitler: I felt she was leaning too much on her negritude in this album.\n\nKernodle: They attack her in a way that they will not attack a Miles Davis or a John Coltrane.\n\nLincoln: Everybody is not Black in this society, and the people who are, are the only ones who are qualified to say how it feels.\n\nAnd I, Abbey Lincoln, sing about what's most important to me.\n\nYou know, when I was a Professional Negro, nobody seemed to mind.\n\nI was capitalizing on the fact that I was a Negro and I looked the way Western people expect you to look.\n\nI was not an artist, I had nothing to say.\n\nAnd as soon as I said, \"I don't want to do this anymore,\" they came down on me with all four feet.\n\nFeldstein: And you

yet another spectacular hairstyle.\n\nWhat do you call that?\n\nTyson: Well, I -- I don't know that this one has any specific name, but my hairdresser, Ouma, refers to it as African hair sculpture.\n\nJones: I had the great fortune of playing opposite Ms. Tyson in a play called \"The Blacks\" by Jean Genet.\n\nTyson: Oh, my heavens, yes.\n\nJones: And you had one of the first naturals

flirted, and a woman held a gun, and she did what men did, then it's exploitation -- but it wasn't.\n\nIt was what, from a woman's perspective, liberation.\n\nI called it Black liberation.\n\nElias: What, are you crazy?\n\nDawes: He's ready sister.\n\nElias: No, you...!\n\nBerry: I really understand how important those movies were, especially for a Black artist.\n\nWe had no opportunities.\n\nThose were our opportunities, and I know during the time they took a lot of hits.\n\nPeople today still get caught in their feelings about those movies, but the reality is, as artists we needed outlets.\n\nDirector: Cut!\n\nHold on the top!\n\nRoll it!\n\nAction!\n\nHorne: So, we had to take the bitter with the sweet, you know?\n\nWe had to take the exploitation because it employed a lot of actors in Hollywood wishing they had something to do.\n\nBlacula: Ah!\n\nWaithe: If Blaxploitation gives us Pam Grier, I'll take it any day.\n\n[ Applause ] Interviewer: I'm not going to deal with any of the criticisms of \"Sounder,\" but I'm going to deal with awards.\n\nDo you think it would be of any significant value, say you were to win an Academy Award say for your portrayal of Rebecca?\n\nTyson: Well I overheard several times of producers and directors say, uh, \"Blacks don't want to see themselves that way.\"\n\nWell, I was incensed because, you know, my whole feeling is, let me make my decisions about what I want to see.\n\nAnd we were not given a choice.\n\nWe were given one specific type of film and that was all.\n\nNobody said, \"Well, this is 'Sounder', and this is whatever the other film is.\"\n\nYou have your choice.\n\nI demand a choice as a human being.\n\nAnd I think that the success of \"Sounder\" has proven them wrong so far.\n\nAnd I hope that it will continue to do so.\n\nNow, if I win it, it will be the first time in the history of the Academy that a Black woman wins the award.\n\nHackman: The truly talented ladies nominated for Best Performance by an Actress are: Welch: Liza Minnelli in \"Cabaret.\"\n\nHackman: Diana Ross in \"Lady Sings the Blues.\"\n\nWelch: Maggie Smith in \"Travels with My Aunt.\"\n\nHackman: Cicely Tyson in \"Sounder.\"\n\nWelch: Liv Ullman in \"The Emigrants.\"\n\nHackman: And the winner is... Welch: I hope they haven't got a cause.\n\nHackman: Liza Minnelli!\n\n[ Applause ] Feldstein: Cicely Tyson has a series of really significant roles in the 1970s.\n\nThe first is in the film \"Sounder,\" which comes out in 1972.\n\nThe second is in the television film, \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" which comes out in 1974.\n\nAnd then she has a small but quite significant role in the opening episode of the television mini-series, \"Roots,\" in 1976.\n\nBinta: We have a very strong son.\n\nFeldstein: All of these productions were critical, and commercial successes.\n\nQuentin: I understand you were a slave.\n\nFeldstein: These productions tell stories of African American history.\n\nJane: Lots of peoples were slaves.\n\nQuentin: Well, I -- I thought maybe you could tell me what things were like in those days.\n\nFeldstein: And she portrays Black women who are... Jane: In those days... Feldstein: ...poor yet dignified.\n\nHard-working, committed to family, who are helping the race survive.\n\nTyson: I thought it was time for the Black woman to appear on the screen as a human being, rather than as a Barbie doll, a sex symbol, or addict, all of the things that we have been forced to deal with in the past few years in films.\n\nFeldstein: Cicely Tyson's roles really affirmed the strength, and the power, and the love that were central to Black families, and really pushed back against a widespread demonization that circulated about Black families since 1965, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was then assistant secretary of labor, wrote what became known as \"The Moynihan Report.\"\n\nThis was a document in which he was trying to diagnose what was wrong with Black families.\n\nMoynihan argued that the main problems that Black families were facing had to do with matriarchal households in which mothers were too strong and were the cause of a lot of dysfunctional behavior.\n\nPaul: Ma!\n\nMa!\n\nThe social worker's here!\n\nClaudine: Oh [bleep]!\n\nFeldstein: The Moynihan report contributed to critiques of welfare, saying that Black women were promiscuous... Claudine: Honey, get rid of the TV and hide!\n\nFeldstein: ...and trying to scam the government and just trying to get more and more money from the federal government so that they wouldn't have to work.\n\nMiss Kabak: So, you're the gentleman that's been keeping company here.\n\nFeldstein: The movie \"Claudine\" was a direct assault on the underlying logic of \"The Moynihan Report,\" and on the welfare system itself, and the ways in which it policed and sought to control Black women's reproductive lives as well as their work lives.\n\nMiss Kabak: But the Welfare is supporting Mrs. Price.\n\nClaudine: Supportin'?\n\nSupportin' [bleep]!\n\nHe gave me this.\n\nHe gave me this.\n\nYes, he gave it to me.\n\nAnd he gave me this.\n\nNow we have to hide this [bleep] Do you believe -- yes, he gave me this.\n\nWe have to hide this.\n\nLurlene: He gave us this too, but it don't work.\n\nClaudine: That's right, and I've got to hide my man in the toilet.\n\nMiss Kabak, do you hide your man in the toilet?\n\nStewart: In \"Claudine,\" Diahann Carroll plays a welfare mother living in Harlem.\n\nShe's got this kind of like slew of children, and she's engaged with the real struggle with the welfare state.\n\nFeldstein: The film exposes the inequities of the welfare system.\n\nClaudine: What is this?\n\nAm I not supposed to see a man?\n\nWhat am I?\n\nA damn nun?\n\nMiss Kabak: No, but if you've been sleeping with a man and he's been giving you things, I'm sorry, but I have to know.\n\nClaudine: Do you sleep with a man?\n\nMiss Kabak: Now that's none of your business!\n\nClaudine: It's none of your business either.\n\nMiss Kabak: You're wrong, Mrs. Price!\n\nIt is our business!\n\nWaithe: \"Claudine\" to me is such an important piece on cinema just because of how grounded it is in the story telling, in the fabric of it, and the -- the -- the humanity in it.\n\nAnd I think that's because James Earl Jones and Diahann Carroll are such dignified people that they can't help but bring dignity to these roles and these characters.\n\nMiss Kabak: We'd love to see you get married.\n\nRoop: Yeah, I'm hip you would!\n\nIt would take the government off the hook and put me on.\n\nStewart: When Diahann Carroll makes \"Claudine,\" in many ways, it seems as though she's trying to respond to some of the criticism that she received for \"Julia.\"\n\nPlaying a welfare mother, in Harlem, rendering some of the challenges that poor women face.\n\nClaudine: Fighting!\n\nBeating up on somebody!\n\nThat makes you a man, right?\n\nScrewing all the broads and making babies, that makes you a man!\n\nBig man!\n\nStewart: She wanted to demonstrate to the public that she had the capacity to stretch in that way, but then also wanting to be responsive to the frustrations of the Black community with regard to a kind of whitewashing of Black characters in media.\n\nCarroll: I loved doing \"Claudine.\"\n\nIt was demanding to reach a little further and away from glamour.\n\nBeing flirted with by someone that I like very much, and how do I hold that in place while raising my children?\n\nLemmon: Diahann Carroll for \"Claudine.\"\n\nAnd Faye Dunaway for \"Chinatown\"... Valerie Perrine for \"Lenny.\"\n\nGena Rowlands for \"A Woman Under the Influence.\"\n\nAnd the winner is... Ellen Burstyn in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\"\n\nCarroll: It was, uh, fabulous to learn that I had been nominated.\n\nIt was almost unbelievable in the beginning.\n\nThere's so few Black actors, actresses, who were nominated ever, and I felt it was a blessing from above.\n\nI am bursting with pride because I think maybe this is the beginning of roles that have a little more dimension than we've been exposed to before.\n\nI hope so.\n\nStewart: Well, after \"Claudine,\" we don't see Diahann Carroll on screen for a long time.\n\nShe is victim of a larger kind of pullback on Black representation in film that happens after the fall of the so-called Blaxploitation cycle as Hollywood interest in serving Black audiences began to wane in the mid to late 1970s.\n\nShe comes up again in the amazing role of Dominique Deveraux on \"Dynasty\" in the 1980s.\n\nCarroll: I saw Jane Wyman, who was nasty and mean and rich and powerful.\n\nAnd I saw Joan Collins, who was nasty and mean and rich and powerful.\n\nAnd I said, \"You know what I want to be?\n\nI want to be nasty, and mean, and rich, and powerful!\"\n\nRight?\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\nRivers: That's the American Dream!\n\nCarroll: That's the American Dream!\n\nRivers: Absolutely!\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nConcierge: Welcome to La Mirage, Miss...?\n\n-Dominique: Deveraux.\n\n-Concierge: Let's see.\n\nYes, we have a beautiful junior suite ready for you on the second floor.\n\nDominique: Junior suite?\n\nI specifically asked for a two-bedroom suite.\n\nI don't sleep in my clothes, nor do I sleep with them.\n\nI require one bedroom for my wardrobe and one for myself.\n\nCarroll: Dominique Deveraux is really a white man.\n\nShe lives in that world and it's primarily about money.\n\nDominique: Do your lies never stop?\n\nAlexis: [Scoffs] Are you calling me a liar?!\n\nOh, I find that very amusing.\n\nWell, I suggest that you check it out with Garrett Boydston yourself because he gives a new meaning to the word liar.\n\n-Dominique: Alexis?\n\n-Alexis: Yes.\n\nDominique: I didn't thank you for your present.\n\n[ Alexis gasps ] Carroll: I wanted the audience to say, \"Who is this mean woman?\"\n\nI didn't want to like my children; I didn't want to have a good relationship with my husband.\n\nI thought it was nice for a change to see someone who was not wonderful who was Black.\n\n♪♪ Waithe: When we tell our stories, we get to be the hero.\n\nAnd, but we also get to be the villain, and I think both are important.\n\nOkoye: You are not fit to be a king!\n\n[ Grunting ] ♪♪ Grier: The studios wanted me to do the same thing, be redundant.\n\nI said, \"I can't.\"\n\nI don't want to bore my audience, I got to give them something different, something that shows that we can do anything.\n\nI really wanted to bring the Dorothy Dandridge story to screen, but then the studios were saying, \"If no one knows of her, then no one's going to come.\"\n\nSo, okay, next.\n\nMary Fields, the first Black female stagecoach driver.\n\nIt's action -- we make it like a Clint Eastwood movie.\n\n\"Good, Bad, and the Ugly.\"\n\n\"Oh, that sounds kind of -- nah, no one's going to believe that there's a Black female stagecoach driver.\"\n\nWe went through Ella Fitzgerald, women's jazz bands, women airline pilots.\n\nYou know, we went to all of them who have my catalogue, who produced for me.\n\nAnd they said, \"No, that's -- keep doing what you're doing.\"\n\nFriday: We are going to see the senator.\n\nI want to ask him a few questions, and I want some no-jive answers.\n\nColt: To what?\n\nFriday: To where are all the Black leaders?\n\nRoss: I was happy to see Pam Grier make it out of, you know, the Blaxploitation section of film.\n\nMary: We're going to have a baby.\n\nWendell: That's good.\n\nMary: You're not mad, are you?\n\nWendell: I love you, Mary.\n\nJackie: If you had the chance to walk away with a half million dollars, would you take it?\n\nRoss: To have Quentin Tarantino make a film with her, that was the epitome right there 'cause she showed herself to... to carry this film, to play this part.\n\nStewart: When Quentin Tarantino does his homage to Pam Grier in the film \"Jackie Brown,\" that gives us a sense of how important it is to recognize that these films... Jackie: Are you scared of me?\n\nStewart: ...have an impact beyond the audiences that they were primarily made for.\n\nIt also kind of gives us a sense of what these actors have the capacity to do.\n\nLouise: You think you're smart!\n\nHuh?\n\nDo you?\n\nDo you?\n\nStewart: One wonders, you know, what could've happened if she was able to kind of demonstrate that in a larger body of work.\n\nCrowe: And the Oscar goes to... Halle Berry in \"Monster's Ball.\"\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] Announcer: This is the first Oscar for Halle Berry.\n\nBerry: I am an actress who now lives and works in an industry that was far better than when I started 20 years ago.\n\nThis moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll.\n\nIt's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.\n\nBut I've struggled since I won that Academy Award to back that up, because there's just a lack of material and roles for women like me.\n\nYou know, we celebrate the Black stories that we have, but if you had any idea how many people try after year after year after year and fail, I think it would be staggering.\n\nJackson: It's changed so much.\n\nI mean, Hattie McDaniel went to the Oscars and they sat her by the kitchen, and she won.\n\nYou know, now, if I go to the Oscars, they put me in the front row.\n\nThey won't put me by the kitchen.\n\nIt doesn't mean they don't feel the same way.\n\n♪♪ Stewart: Filmmaking has been a nepotistic profession.\n\nIf you're already sort of inside of the network, then you have opportunities.\n\nAnd of course, this means that African Americans have had a tremendously difficult time breaking into the industry.\n\nMany of the great Black writers who were interested in Hollywood.\n\nZora Neale Hurston wanted to write for film.\n\nLangston Hughes wanted to write for film.\n\nWaithe: You don't really have a choice, do you?\n\nYou don't really got no choice though, do you?\n\nMatsoukas: And take out, \"Y'all the ones who killed the cop.\"\n\nWaithe: I always wanted to be a television writer.\n\nAdding a voice and being a part of a sea of voices on a TV show.\n\nBut then as I got older, I started to dream bigger.\n\nYou know, when I saw people like Shonda Rhimes, and Debbie Allen, I wanted to be calling the shots, and so I was able to dream a bigger dream because of them.\n\nI was very impacted by \"A Different World.\"\n\nAnd it was a great moment for me when, uh, Jada Pinkett's character was introduced on \"A Different World,\" and her name was Lena James, and she was named for Lena Horne, and Lena Horne came and did a guest spot on the show and it felt like a sign that I was on the right path.\n\nFreddie: Lena's in the building!\n\nLena's in the building!\n\n-Davenport: Lena?\n\n-Freddie: Oh!\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] Gilbert-Wayne: I'm Whitley Gilbert-Wayne, the head of the student welcoming committee, Ms. Horne.\n\nJames: Honey get up off the floor.\n\nI'm not the Queen of England.\n\nJames: Hi, my name is Lena, and I'm so proud to be named after you.\n\n-Horne: Thank you.\n\n-Man: And you're still as beautiful as my father said.\n\n-Horne: Oh, please.\n\n♪♪ Stewart: It's absolutely crucial to have more artists of color working behind the camera who can reflect the broad experiences of people of color.\n\nOfficer: Get on the ground now!\n\nGet on the ground!\n\nStewart: And of African Americans in particular.\n\nWaithe: Black storytellers have a right to tell their story.\n\nUh, \"Pariah\" is through the lens of Dee Rees.\n\n\"Twenties\" is through the lens of me.\n\n\"I May Destroy\" you is through the lens of Michaela.\n\n\"Insecure\" is through the lens of Issa Rae.\n\nRae: I know this sounds bad, but it's actually really good.\n\nMelina: Cut!\n\nClose up!\n\nGrier: The exposure of art transforms people; reaches into you and can change you.\n\nCarroll: It's exciting to watch Black women in the practical side of business today.\n\nThe words were not even in our sentences when I was coming along.\n\nKeys: We want to see truth, we want to see a variety of it, and we're going to have to continue to fight for it, by the way.\n\nTyson: Next month, on December 19th... ♪♪ I'm going to be 94 years old.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] This is the culmination of all those years of have and have-not.\n\nSimone: ♪ Wish I knew how ♪ ♪ It would feel to be free ♪ Waithe: All of these women knew that they were doing it for those that were coming behind them -- that we would be freer than they would be.\n\nHorne: The kind of strength that these young people have is so fearless that it's so strong and so beautiful.\n\nWaithe: And what we do with that freedom is very important, because we need to free up those that come after us as well.\n\nTillet: Black women artists mustered the courage to use their platform to make a difference and they're really carrying the torch.\n\nKeys: We are artists!\n\nWe are activists!\n\nWe are entrepreneurs!\n\nWe rise!\n\nSimone: ♪ I found out ♪ ♪ How it feels ♪ ♪ I know how it feels to be free ♪ ♪♪ [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪"
