        "text": "William “Dick” Richard Dunham\n\nJune 15, 1943 - July 18, 2022\n\nDick died suddenly on July 18, 2022, in a tragic boating accident on Lake Tahoe.\n\n[Eulogy by hi wife] Dick was the kindest, most wonderful man I’ve ever\n\nknown. He was loved and admired by all who knew him. He was genius-level\n\nsmart, but he never made others feel less then. If you wanted to know a\n\nthing, he’d explain it to you. But he wouldn’t waste time trying to\n\nsmarten up a chump. He did not suffer fools.\n\nHe did not go gently into that good night. Through difficult health\n\nissues, he prevailed, struggled, and fought, always with dignity and\n\nstrength.\n\nHe loved me immensely and told me so every day. I was everything to him,\n\nand he to me. He was romantic and tender, adventurous, funny and fun.\n\nDick earned his BS from UC Berkeley and his PhD in BioPhysics from UC\n\nSan Diego. Dick served at the University of Michigan between 1970-2000,\n\nrising to the rank of Senior Distinguished Research Biophysicist due to\n\nhis significant contributions to the science of electron paramagnetic\n\nresonance (EPR). Dick was a collaborator and research scientist with\n\nRichard H. Sands, and then after Dr. Sands retired from U. Michigan in the\n\nearly 1990s, took charge of the EPR laboratory in the Biophysics\n\ndepartment and acted as an advisor to several graduate students. During\n\nhis tenure at the University of Michigan, Dick was a well-loved and\n\nrespected scientist with a seemingly boundless knowledge of physics and an\n\nobvious passion for good science. Dick wrote some of the first simulation\n\nsoftware for EPR experiments. Some of his research interests were in the\n\ncharacterization and regulation of metal-ion-containing enzymes.\n\nDick was a true renaissance man. His father taught him carpentry; he could\n\nbuild just about anything, including houses. There was nothing he couldn’t\n\nfix. His nephews called him, “the strongest man on earth.” He once lifted\n\na fallen tractor off his father.\n\nHe was known for his cheerfulness, his beautiful smile, and his optimism.\n\nHe always said, “It’s a choice.” He was a hard worker, and he never\n\ncomplained about a thing. He invariably had several projects going. He\n\nloved working on projects with his sons.\n\nDick is survived by his wife, Jeanette; his beloved and cherished sons,\n\nTom and Steve Dunham; and his sisters Donna Wilcox and Peggy Sue Moore. He\n\nhad five grandchildren, all of whom he loved deeply: Drew Dunham, Ben\n\nDunham, Leah Dunham, Lucas Dunham, and Jacob Dunham.\n\nA memorial service was held in late August, 2022."
