        "text": "GSW raises $1,250,053 for Propel scholarship campaign, unveiled during second annual Gold Force Gala\n\nPropel: GSW’s Campaign for Scholarships concluded at GSW's second annual Gold Force Gala on Saturday, Jan. 27, where the final total of $1,250,053 was announced to the 300 guests in attendance at the black-tie fundraiser.\n\n“I extend heartfelt gratitude to the generous donors whose support helped us surpass our $1 million goal by 25 percent,” said Stephen Snyder, assistant vice president for Advancement and GSW Foundation executive director. “This achievement exemplifies the power of collective goodwill and shared commitment to Georgia Southwestern. Our GSW Advancement team is filled with pride at the success of our second annual Gold Force Gala and the scholarship fundraising campaign.”\n\nThe campaign announcement was made by GSW President Dr. Neal Weaver at the conclusion of the Gala’s program and was marked with a balloon drop to commemorate the significant occasion.\n\nA total of 631 donors made contributions to Propel, with 14 gifts of $10,000 or more to the $1 million scholarship funding campaign, which launched in September 2022.\n\nScholarships are awarded to 650 students annually from 140 different GSW Foundation scholarship funds. During the Propel campaign, nine new scholarships were created and six scholarship endowments matured ($25,000 or more).\n\nRead more about Propel and the Gala here.\n\nGSW named #1 Best RN to BSN program in Georgia\n\nGSW was ranked the #1 Best RN to BSN Program in Georgia by RNcareers.org, a leading nursing education resource.\n\nMore than 1,700 nursing schools were evaluated to compile these merit-based rankings based on critical factors such as NCLEX passing rates, accreditation, program offerings, tuition and fees and school reputation.\n\nRN to BSN programs allow registered nurses (RNs) to advance their career, earn a higher salary, and assume more leadership and responsibility in the workplace by earning a baccalaureate degree in nursing.\n\n\"We are thrilled our RN to BSN program has achieved the top spot in Georgia,\" said Teresa Teasley, D.N.P., interim dean of the College of Nursing and Health Sciences. \"This recognition is a testament to our accomplished faculty, motivated students and strong partnerships with esteemed healthcare organizations. Given the high demand for careers in healthcare, particularly for registered nurses, our program stands out. The long-term outlook for registered nurses is rapidly expanding, with an even greater demand for baccalaureate-prepared nurses. Employers actively seek and endorse RNs who are advancing their education.\"\n\nRead more about this recognition here.\n\nDr. Sandra Daniel retiring as Dean of GSW College of Nursing and Health Sciences after 36 years of dedication\n\nSandra Daniel, Ph.D., dean of GSW's College of Nursing and Health Sciences, is retiring effective Jan. 1, 2024 after serving GSW for 36 years.\n\n“It has been a privilege to serve Georgia Southwestern in several capacities,” said Daniel. “Starting as an instructor in 1986 and progressing through the tenure ranks to professor has been an honor. The most exciting thing has been to serve as dean since 2008, allowing me to form lasting relationships with administrators, faculty, staff and students at GSW, as well as collaborate with healthcare providers in our region.”\n\nDuring Daniel’s tenure, GSW’s nursing program has increased its enrollment several times, including the addition of a Spring admission period for Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students, the development of several graduate programs and, most recently, the revival of the Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN)program. The Guaranteed Acceptance Program, a competitive early enrollment process, also attracts high school seniors.\n\n“Dr. Daniel has played an instrumental role in the development and growth of GSW’s nursing program to meet the needs of our regional healthcare workforce,” said GSW President Neal Weaver, Ph.D. “Her leadership has been crucial to our accreditation efforts and to the enhancement of our institution as a whole. She doubled the enrollment of nursing students who are now able to serve more people. I can’t imagine a greater legacy than fostering opportunities for students and serving people in need.”\n\nRead more about Daniel's time at GSW here.\n\nComputing faculty teach in China\n\nOver winter break, faculty members from the Department of Computing embarked on an academic journey to Zhoukou Normal University (ZKNU) in China. Karen Cook, Ed.D., Sai Mukkavilli, Ph.D., and Jonathan Hobbs, D.Sc., along with GSW staff member Hailey Henderson, participated in this collaborative initiative between GSW and ZKNU.\n\nTheir mission included teaching computer science classes at ZKNU, fostering cross-cultural education for a large cohort of students. This academic venture showcased the commitment of both institutions to global education and knowledge exchange. The faculty members were not only teaching but also embracing the opportunity to immerse themselves in the vibrant campus life of ZKNU, residing within the bustling community of 20,000 students in the dormitories.\n\nDuring their stay, GSW faculty had the privilege of exploring some of China's iconic landmarks, including the Great Wall in Beijing. Beyond the classroom, the faculty members enjoyed meaningful interactions with the ZKNU faculty and students. The trip also included a memorable showcase of their talents in a full production show, where they performed in front of an enthusiastic audience of over 1,000 students, faculty, and staff members.\n\nThe faculty are eager to return for future collaborations.\n\nCanes Spotlight announced for January\n\nCanes Spotlights highlight Georgia Southwestern students who hold leadership roles, are involved in extracurricular activities and/or excel academically in their degree programs.\n\nThe January Canes Spotlight was senior biology major Matthew Busby.\n\n\"I initially chose GSW because of its affordability and closeness to home. However, I found that GSW was the right place for me due to the tight-knit community that exists here which made me feel at home,\" said Matthew.\"\n\nMatthew has made his mark academically at GSW. He has served as a tutor for the Department of First-Year Experience and Student Success for two years and was named Outstanding Tutor of the Year in 2022. He and classmate Arul Thason also won first place for their oral presentation at GSW's 2023 Undergraduate Research Symposium.\n\nAs a biology major, Matthew says he continues to be amazed by the subject. \"Learning different subjects within biology has given me much appreciation and respect for all living things.\"\n\nCanes Spotlights are nominated by GSW faculty and staff.\n\nYemelyanov awarded second U.S. Patent\n\nProfessor of Computer Science Alexander Yemelyanov, Ph.D., D.Sc. received a patent award for “Express Decision: Decision-Making Augmentation System\" (US Patent. No. 11,794, 771, US PTO) on October 24, 2023. This is his second US patent awarded within the past year.\n\nWhen the US Patent and Trademark Office granted this patent, it marked the first implementation of a motivational decision-making model in the US. This augmentation system was specifically created to assist individuals in navigating challenging decisions within the context of risk and uncertainty, where it's quite common to rely on intuition. Express Decision users can leverage their self-efficacy to arrive at satisfying solutions to complex problems, upon recognizing the limitations inherent in human rationality when faced with difficult decisions. These limitations can stem from various sources, including time constraints, emotional factors and biases, information availability, and cognitive constraints. Express Decision demonstrates great potential for application in both everyday and professional decision-making scenarios. As a systematic method, it currently features several web applications that span the fields of healthcare and insurance. The innovative approach of integrating a motivational model into decision-making systems highlights a noteworthy paradigm shift in addressing complex decision challenges.\n\nScanlon-Richardson joins the Department of Biology\n\nKaylyn Scanlon-Richardson, Ph.D. joined the Department of Biology on Jan. 1, 2024 as a biology lecturer after completing her Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences at The University of Central Florida. She completed her B.S. in Biology in 2019 at Georgia College and State University and received her M.S. in conjunction with entering her Ph.D. candidacy at UCF.\n\nAs a Georgia native, she was drawn back to her roots to begin her career in teaching at Georgia Southwestern. Richardson has a passion for active and experiential learning, and hopes to foster a love of science in all of her students. Her interests include biochemistry, microbiology and infectious disease.\n\nRichardson recently married her high school sweetheart, Shane. She and her husband spend time together through tending to their garden and many houseplants. She spends much of her time exploring the out-of-doors through visiting parks, kayaking, and hiking. She is also an avid reader, and enjoys curling up on the couch with a good book and her pet rabbit, Roscoe.\n\nGSW hosts Special Olympics\n\nOn December 1, 2023 Georgia Southwestern hosted the Area 11 Special Olympics. The Storm Dome was full of athletes from Dooly, Sumter, Schley, Marion, Lee, and Worth counties who participated in various competitions and activities. This event was a true union of GSW College of Education and GSW Athletics. Individuals from both groups made sure this event was the best possible experience for the participants. In addition, the volunteers walked away fulfilled and touched by the joy and spirit of the athletes who they were able to help during this event.\n\nStudent-athlete Damean Dominguez, who is a member of the men’s soccer team, shares that sentiment: \"This event made me feel great and I always enjoy being a part of events like this. I was doing it for a good cause because the kids don’t get to experience things like Special Olympics or Night to Shine everyday, and to be able to show them that they matter and are just as good and as important as us would put a smile on anyone’s face and would warm anyone’s heart. What I got out of this is to treat everyone with kindness and not make them feel like an outcast because of things they can’t control. Everyone is important and deserves a chance to experience the good in life, and these kids show that no matter the hand they are dealt with they find a way to keep a smile on their face, and put smiles on others as well!\"\n\nFurthermore, education major Mackenzie Edgcombe, had this to share about her experience: \"The overall experience for the Special Olympics is great! I have been participating in Special Olympics since middle school, so I have loved being able to get behind the scenes for the past 2 semesters! Special Olympics' means a lot to me and many others. This event allows everyone to be a part of something bigger than themselves. It is one of the many ways that a community gets to show inclusion and just love to these people in our community.\"\n\nOverall, the 2023 Area 11 Special Olympics event hosted at GSW was a great representation of what it means to be a Hurricane."
