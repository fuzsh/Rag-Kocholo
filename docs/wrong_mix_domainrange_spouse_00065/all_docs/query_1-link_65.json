        "text": "“We are best friends for the next 5 minutes”, said my Chinese skydive instructor Ethel in the aircraft just before the jump for the tandem skydive at Suzhou, China. Reflecting on the skydive experience, this simple sentence left quite an impact on me. There are some situations in life where you need to just trust someone unknown/ lesser known with the critical decisions and take the leap of faith. You might have never met the person/being or experienced the same feeling ever after the experience, but it meant a lot when it happened and has an impact on your life.\n\nWe all have such friends and well-wishers in life who were there as best friends when it mattered the most. Let’s take time to thank all such friends whom we have reached out for guidance, direction, and trusted with some critical decisions on the personal and professional front. Some wonderful people at work who collaborated on some key projects or some relatives, friends from childhood, school, and college who may not be connected all the time but you know you can lean on when needed the most.\n\nIf we believe in these friends whom we may not be connected often but have created memories with, let’s take some time to thank them. Let us also be that ‘best friend for 5 minutes’ for others who may need it, not necessarily seeing what’s in it for us every time we do it.\n\nFinally a ‘Thank You’ Note for the 1.3k friends that I have on Medium in all my followers in this journey of 1 month. Those few seconds or minutes you spent deciding to follow me, means a lot to me in this journey of writing.\n\nListing each one of you to express my gratitude."
