        "text": "Episode 122 of 50 Shades of Planning, which is brought to you in partnership with Cratus Group, is available now via this link or from Apple, Spotify, etc. What are we to make of neighbourhood planning? Friend of the podcast Ben Castell considers it a “grassroots planning revolution”. Perhaps less favourably it conjures for others images of corduroy and tweed-clad councillors convening a parish council working group to thwart plans for an incinerator or, worse still, new housing. With neighbourhood planning now part of the furniture, but with the current opposition and possible next Government talking about ‘taking planning up a level’, I thought it time for the podcast to evaluate the story of neighbouring planning so far, which is lead in this episode by the afore-mentioned Ben Castell. Ben invited Samantha Banks MRTPI, Graeme Markland and Leani Haim to record an online conversation with him last month. Now it is fair to say that Ben, Samantha, Graeme and Leani are all neighbourhood planning enthusiasts and for balance, in addressing the question as to how successful the enterprise has been, a more sceptical voice was required. About two thirds of the way through then you will hear from another friend of the podcast, Simon Ricketts, who fits that bill and who kindly recorded his thoughts in advance so that the others could mull them over in the final section of the episode. My thanks to all of them, and to Luca Difato for production support. 50 Shades of Planning is the podcast by planners and for planners so if you would like to use it as a platform for sharing anything that you think we need to be talking about then do please feel free to get in touch with me at samstafford@hotmail.com. https://lnkd.in/eZxi5bgi #planning #townplanning #development #podcasts"
