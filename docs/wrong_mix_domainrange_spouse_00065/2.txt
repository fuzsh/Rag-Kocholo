Unfortunately, July saw the end of a fantastic 7+ year tenure for me at Modis/Akkodis. One with celebrations, success stories, record breaking achievements, and friendships/memories that will last a lifetime. 4 time All Star winner, 6 years surpassing 100% of our financial target, and Market of the year Winner in 2021. Most importantly, we were Family. We battled together, learned together, won together, and celebrated together. It was a great run! A huge Thank you Brian Van Aken, Sean Palat, James Wolf, Jason Dunham, and Michael Majoros for the opportunities, your trust in me to lead and excel, embracing my creativity/innovation, and for your mentorship and guidance over the past 7+ years! and to my fellow comrades. Thank you for allowing me to lead, for always giving 110% and joining me as we serviced our clients and contractors better than any IT Staffing & Services company in the US.
