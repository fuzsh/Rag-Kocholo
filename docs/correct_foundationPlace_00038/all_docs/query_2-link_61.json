        "text": "Montana’s abundant natural resources translate into low energy costs and of the energy we consume, much of it comes from renewable sources. Add that to a mountain climate that cools naturally at night and you’ll certainly understand why data centers and other firms in need of bandwidth, power, and talent for their business models relating to SaaS, streaming big data analysis, and cybersecurity like Montana.\n\nBig Sky Country is home to vibrant small cities with abundant outdoor amenities where\n\nknowledge-based industry workers want to stay, thus reducing costly turnover. Companies such as Submittable, ClassPass, Schedulicity, and EventGroove have recognized and embraced this. In 2012, Montana startup RightNow Technologies was acquired by Oracle for $1.5 billion. Today, Oracle still has significant operations in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nBuilding on the state’s established technology infrastructure, in 2023 Montana was recognized by the US Economic Development Administration as a Tech Hub due to its potential for rapid growth in smart, autonomous, and remote sensing technologies as well as the cloud computing that supports them.\n\n“When it was time to go to the U.S., we wanted to find a place that aligned with our values as a company. Montana’s growing tech community shares our dedication for building a cutting-edge yet sustainable workplace and community. The open spaces and access to majestic mountains, rivers and forests provide fresh inspiration every day, and our unique location has become an asset in building business relationships. We’re proud to call Montana home, as a company and as families who live and work here.” -Patrick Flanagan, COO, Administrate"
