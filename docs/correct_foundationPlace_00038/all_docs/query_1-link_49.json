        "text": "Flexibility of Deployment, Licensing, Upgrade Scheduling, Integration and Customization Drive Larger-Scale Implementations of On Demand Applications\n\nRightNow Technologies (NASDAQ:RNOW) today announced that it continues to lead the adoption of software-as-a-service with enterprise customers and large government agencies by uniquely providing the flexible deployment options, licensing models, upgrade choices, integration capabilities and customization these organizations require.\n\nRightNow's approach to the delivery of software-as-a-service has made it the market leader in large-scale implementations. More than half of RightNow's business currently comes from enterprises with $1 billion-plus in revenue and large government accounts. New, renewed and expanded enterprise customer relationships during the first quarter of 2006 included Electronic Arts, Overstock.com, Sharper Image, Ticketmaster, and Virgin America, Inc.\n\nSeveral factors make RightNow's on demand solutions particularly attractive to larger organizations. These factors include:\n\nAbility to deploy applications either hosted or on-premise\n\nChoice of pay-as-you-go, term-based and perpetual licensing models\n\nFreedom to plan and schedule upgrades when it is appropriate for the business\n\nEasy to connect to other systems using standards-based integration\n\nHighly customizable to ensure precise alignment of the CRM environment with current and future business requirements\n\nRightNow also provides unmatched visibility into the hosted environment. Customers can view a full range of data about their hosted applications, allowing them to closely monitor the system just as they would an internal application. RightNow has provided customers with this insight for more than four years.\n\n\"RightNow was the only vendor capable of fulfilling our highly demanding requirements in terms of software functionality, reliable and scalable hosting, and overall quality-of-engagement,\" Boyd Beasley, senior director of customer support at Electronic Arts said. \"Our experience has proven that our conclusions were correct, as RightNow has had a significant positive impact on both our immediate, bottom-line performance and our ability to achieve our long-term strategic goals.\"\n\nMany on demand vendors provide solutions that are suitable for small- to mid-sized businesses (SMBs), since they require forced upgrades and/or do not offer customers the ability to take the system in-house if they should choose to do so. Other vendors only view on demand as an \"on ramp\" to their true enterprise offerings, since they offer limited functionality under the software-as-a-service model. RightNow is succeeding with upmarket customers by delivering true enterprise-class capabilities supported by a global technical services organization.\n\n\"On demand isn't just a way to eliminate the costs and management burdens associated with IT infrastructure; it's a fundamentally more effective way to implement high-impact enterprise applications across a global enterprise -- as well as to partners and customers,\" Greg Gianforte, RightNow's founder and CEO, said. \"Despite the claims and posturings of our competitors, RightNow is clearly leading the way when it comes to meeting the needs of larger organizations that want to take advantage of this superior model for software deployment.\""
