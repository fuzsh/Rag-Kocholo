        "text": "While our Orange Dreamsicle Frosty® may be new, you’ve always loved it. Right? Right. It’s actually the current headliner (while Vanilla is on leave) with our classic Chocolate as the opening act. And not to toot our own Frosty horn, but all of our creamy flavors have been well received, scooped, and dipped. In historical order, they include:\n\nChocolate Frosty\n\nVanilla Frosty\n\nStrawberry Frosty\n\nPeppermint Frosty\n\nPumpkin Spice Frosty\n\nOrange Dreamsicle Frosty\n\nOne last thing — if you’re interested in the history of how Dave took our classic Frosty from a local treat to a national treasure, dig in below.\n\nYes. The answer is always yes. Thick enough for a spoon, smooth enough for a straw, and perfect when enjoyed on the end of a fry — you can order up a Frosty now on the Wendy’s® App or online for delivery, drive-thru, or pickup. And let’s be real, if you read this far, there’s no way you can resist not getting one."
