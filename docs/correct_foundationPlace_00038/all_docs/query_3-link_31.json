        "text": "By Greg Gianforte, Founder, RightNow Technologies, Inc.\n\n(This is the first of a two-part series on the keys to great customer service as described in the new book Attack of the Customers, by Greg Gianforte and Paul Gillin.)\n\nGreat customer experience has never been more important to business. In fact, with today’s globally wired world, customers have more choice than ever before. And that means they have fewer reasons than ever to do business with brands that don’t provide exceptional experiences.\n\nCustomer experience is the sum total of all interactions that customers have with a brand, and the perception they form as a result. Many interactions offer opportunities for companies to learn more about the customer’s needs and preferences and to strengthen the relationship. Failing to amass as much knowledge as you can about your market leads to missed new product opportunities and annoyed customers. On the flip side, good analytics helps you predict customer needs before they’re even aware of them.\n\nIn fact, a strong argument can be made that customer experience is one of the few remaining sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Products are being copied faster than ever before. Prices are being matched and beaten almost instantly by competitors. Yet, great customer experience is almost impossible to knock off quickly or cheaply. If you want a competitive advantage that’s hard to beat, follow these eight steps to great customer experience:\n\n1. Establish a knowledge foundation.\n\nThe first step in delivering an exceptional customer experience is establishing a knowledge foundation. A knowledge foundation should contain two key types of information: knowledge about your products, services, and company; and knowledge about your customers. Employees can rely on the knowledge foundation as a source of information to enhance customer interactions, while customers can use it for self-service and to simplify interactions with your company.\n\nOnce you have a system in place, it’s important to seed it with a limited number of questions and answers that cover basic information. It can grow over time. Once it’s up and running, determine where the knowledge gaps are by capturing customer questions and corporate responses. Lastly, organize the information in the knowledge base for easy access and provide a way for customers to use it to answer their specific questions.\n\nA knowledge system in isolation is like Einstein’s brain without a body; smart, but of little use. To drive business value, your knowledge foundation must connect directly to business applications (including CRM, RMA systems, Web content, etc), across all the customer touch channels in your business. Make the system available to anyone who interacts with the customer.\n\n2. Empower customers with self-service.\n\nSometimes the best way to do something is to do nothing at all. Taken from a corporate perspective, the best way to help a customer may be to let the customer help herself. One great way to do this is by providing customers direct access to the knowledge foundation created in step one so they can find the information they need whenever they want it. Self-service options actually benefit both customers and your company, providing speed (customers can get answers immediately), round-the-clock service (great for middle-of-the-night questions), effectiveness (diagrams, photos, videos, and other media can be used to demonstrate or explain), load-balancing (an effective self-service environment can reduce workloads of agents, employees, and partners who assist customers and enable them to focus on those that truly need personal attention), and true first-contact resolution (many consumers check websites before calling, enabling them to answer their own question).\n\nBut simply providing self-service systems is only the first step. Organizations also need to encourage their customers to use them. From my experience, there are a few good ways to do that: make online self-service links prominent on your website and always offer them anywhere you provide your customer support number, integrate online help throughout key processes, promote Web and self-service resources in telephone hold messages, let call center agents notify customers of self-service options, and reply to email questions with the link to self-service content to re-enforce self-service availability.\n\n3. Empower frontline staff.\n\nOf course, creating a great customer experience requires more than providing self-service options for customers. You also have to empower front line staff who interact with customers to fully exceed customer expectations. When done right, the payoff from even a single interaction can be enormous. By giving frontline employees the means to go above and beyond the basics of customer support, you create the potential to create raving fans. You can start by making sure that frontline employees have all the information they need about customer’s previous interactions so that employees can personalize the conversation, show they understand the customers’ needs, and save repetition and frustration. Another way to empower employees is by finding ways to use experienced frontline staff as training resources, such as creating social networks or other processes that make it easy for them to share their knowledge and experience. You also want to make sure you’re supporting your frontline staff with technology that’s responsive and pulls up the information needed quickly. Lastly, what you measure matters, so organizations fostering great customer service should measure attitudes, not time clocks or interactions-per-agent when it comes to call center metrics.\n\n4. Offer multichannel support.\n\nWebsite. The phone. Email. Youtube, Twitter. These days, multi-channel options aren’t a choice for organizations, they’re a requirement for doing business. Today’s customers expect to have a range of options for interacting with an organization—and they may use them all during any single incident process! To deliver consistently excellent customer experiences while offering customers a choice of communications channels, all customer interactions must be unified. Everyone interacting with customers should be able to see all relevant previous exchanges, regardless of the channels used. A common knowledge foundation (see step one) not only helps enable this, it also makes reporting a lot easier. Be aware of a couple of important tips. First, make sure to avoid the dead-end channel. If customers have trouble finding what they need via one channel, they should be able to quickly switch to another, otherwise they may become frustrated and disinclined to use self-service again. Second, provide a channel for customers to connect with one another. Not only can online communities tap into the collective expertise of customers, but they can save a ton of money when customers help each other to solve a problem.\n\n(Check back tomorrow for the conclusion of this article.
