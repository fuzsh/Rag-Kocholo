As a result, when the 106th Congress departed Friday from its first session, its members and the president left behind a legacy of Inaction on issues that both sides, at ono time or another, have said were pivotal for this and future generations. Impasses remain over assuring the financial solidity of Social Security and Medicare. And the two parties have been' unable to resolve vexing questions over managed health .care, money in politics, gun trafficking, even the cost of prescription drags. During the past year, these issues commanded the atten- tion of Congress and the media. But none has sustained reso- nance with the public. Less than 20 percent of voters polled in public opinion surveys, for - instance, rank Sodal Security or health care as a top concern in their lives.

In this age of fecl-your-pain politics, yester- day’s sign of weakness is today's mark of a sensitive man. George Bush and Bill Clinton got weepy in their 1992 presiden- tial contest and thereafter.

Bush fund-raising machine continued to pay divi- dends Saturday, generating S9QO.OOO for him a day after it raised $2.2 million for the California Republican Party. The Texas governor and Republican presidential front- runner had breakfast with sup- porters at the Del Mar Fairgrounds before heading to Thousand Oaks, Calif,, for a I \"Fiesta at the Farm\" event at the vacation home of David Murdock, chairman of Dole Foods. Bush went to Murdock’s resi- dence in Bel Air, Calif., for Friday night dinner with support- ers who had raised $25,000 each for the state party. The governor's most recent campaign finance report logged $57 million in contributions, and - the Bush team expects to raise- - about $65 million by the end of theyeur.

Forests are becoming tinder- boxes. Ranchers are using up feed tliat should be reserved for winter. Fanners fear their crops could die. And there’s little relief in sight. “The prospects of recovering from such a drought are minimal because of the drier-than-normal anti warmer-ihan-normul winter we’re expected to have,\" said Mark Svuboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. “This drought is made worse by the lingering effects from droughts the last few years.\" The dry. mild weather expect- ed this winter is being attributed in part to La Nina, the global weather phenomenon marked by coolcr-than-normal water in the eastern Pacific. Moist air from the Pacific is shifting farther north than usual, leaving the South and Southwest drier and warmer than normal. The Dallas-Forth Worth area has broken its 72-year-old record of 1 1 consecutive days of 80- degrec temperatures in November. Normal highs for this time of year are in the mid 60s. Oklahoma also has had record highs in the 80s this month. A horse faces away from the strong, brisk winds that blow across western Kansas Thursday. The winds kicked up clouds of dust and turned the sky a pale yellow. Dry conditions coupled with high winds have regularly created this scene that is reminiscent of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Temperatures at Birmingham, Ala., and Nashville, Tenn., have been in the upper 70s instead of the normal 50s and 60s. Svoboda said most of Texas, Louisiana and Indiana are in what his center rates a “severe drought.\" Georgia, Tennessee and most of the Midwest also are in the midst of a drought, with some pockets considered severe. The drought center monitors conditions with five categories, ranging from “abnormally dry\" to “exceptional drought,” with “severe\" falling in the middle.

The truth unfolds? Burley Wal-Mart manager Jeff Hanssen will never forget the Monday morning when he came to work and heard Michael and Cynthia Grissom’s account. He received a phone call from Wal- Mart corporate headquarters in Arkansas; someone there had heard a baby had been abducted from the Burley parking lot. “It was a little bit shocking,” Hanssen said. “Some people were concerned about my park- ing lot’s safety. But a lot of peo- ple came to me from the first and said something was fishy about this.\" Eight days after Michael and Cynthia Grissom told their story, they were in jail. Less than a week into the investigation Cynthia Grissom had broken down and led author- ities to a tree in the desert near ’ Dietrich. Under the tree, in a shallow grave dug with a tire iron, was the 5- week-old baby, Canaan Reign Barnett. With the baby found, the Grissoms changed their story- They told police that the baby had suffocated under Michael Grissom’s arm while the three shared a Jerome motel room bed. The Grissoms said it was an accident, but that didn’t stop Jerome County Prosecutor John Lothspeich from charging Michael Grissom with second- degree murder and Cynthia Gnssom as an accessory. It was the first time the couple faced charges in the child’s death, but it wouldn't be the last. After a pathologist agreed that the death was accidental, Lothspeich reduced the charges to child endangerment. He based the case on contentions that Michael Grissom was.on heroin at the time and that the couple didn’t seek medical help after* finding that Canaan was not . breathing. But just before trial the judge threw the case our, saying there was not enough evidence. And without any new evidence, the case was dead. Surprise witnesses That new evidence surprisingly came a few months later, when two of Michael Grissom’s fellow 'Every time l hold on to my daughter orkirls, it's like I'm hoisting Canaan too. I see Canaan thrvugfi the other kids' Ada County Jail inmates came forward. They said they heard Michael Grissom say he killed . Canaan to support his heroin habit and then brag that be beat the murder rap. Lothspeich charged Grissom with first-degree murder, but when one of the witnesses later recanted his testimony the charge was dropped. “It bothered us all very much,\" Lothspeich said. “We all wanted to do some good.” Lothspeich wanted the case to reach trial so all the facts could be revealed, he said. “1 would like to know more details about what happened, but we’ll probably never know now,\" he sajd. For Addcy it was another frus- trating twist in the case that began 14 months earlier. In Addcy’s mind a guilty man was getting away, he said. “The last time he was let go ... 1 prayed for the strength to carry on,\" Addcy said. “I didn’t forgive him, but I understood there was nothing I could do.\" Addiction strikes back After finishing a drug-related jail sentence in Ada County earli- er this year, Michael Grissom was free from justice but a captive to heroin.

Michael Grissom’s lawyer, Marilyn Paul, is guarded about what she says about Michael Grissom, since is now represent- ing Cynthia Grissom. But Paul said Michael Grissom had a sense of humor and cared enough to warn younger jail inmates about the dangers of criminal life. Michael Grissom’s mother, Pat Voloshen, declined to be inter- viewed for this story. But she wrote earlier this month in Michael Grissom’s obituary that her son “had charm, charisma and a loving nature. He had a way of making people laugh and smile. ... Sadly he chose a lifestyle that involved drugs, which would eventually lead to his death.” Unanswered questions Many answers about what hap- pened in that motel room were buried with Michael Grissom. But the case is not closed. Cynthia Grissom was arraigned Thursday on a new set of drug-related charges. Paul, Michael Grissom’s former lawyer and Jerome County’s pub- lic defender, was appointed to represent Cynthia Grissom. Paul plans to file a motion to dismiss the case. “Mike was the one everybody wanted,\" Gooding County Sheriff Shaun Gough said. \"Mike was the one who suffocated die baby.

In addition, the weakened trees are more likely to be dam- aged by insects, said Lanny Drccscn, on extension forester with the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. Louisiana rancher and craw- fish harvester Connie Simon, who lives 45 miles south of Lafayette, said the grass that feeds his catde may die, and he’s pumped a meager 4 inches of water into his crawfish pond just once this season. In Addcy's mind there is no question what happened. “My honest opinion - in that hotel room Mike killed him,” Addey said. “I truly believe his jealousy and heroin got the best of my son.” When he lost Canaan, Addey dropped into depression, lost his job and drifted from his other three children. But he re alize d he had to get back on track because, he said, “if I'm not good, ITn no good to them.” His other children, especially his 16-year-old daughter, inspired him to keep his head up and eventually get himself together. Now he’s working full-time again and focused on being his chil- dren’s father. “All of my kids mean a lot to me,” Addey said. “Every time I hold on to my daughter or kids, it’s like I'm holding Canaan too. I see Canaan through the other kids.” Tima-Ncws Mini-Cassia Bureau Chief Michael Joumec contributed to this report Turn A Great Meal into A Memorable event With premium -Wines from’ iDAltO y Idaho^ O Twin Falls’ 16 th Annual ^ Christmas Country E® S' Bazaar Knull At the S X Community Grange lW U, 2475 E. 3600 N. p5 ffll Highway 74 Mg Q Friday, Nov. 26 th SJf 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. P Saturday, Nov. 27\"’ ^ is Jj 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. f5i Northside Arts ^ and Craft show.

Growers count on net- ting S2.000 an acre, 10 times what they'd get from a crop like But now a year after the states’ $206 billion settlement with the tobacco industry, ciga- rette consumption is falling so , ; - fast that some farmers arc being ~Z forced to think about getting out of the business. “I’m planning on growing tobacco next year. Beyond that, I don’t know,\" said Joe Williams, who farms near Chatham, Va. “Unless there’s a turnaround somewhere, I won't be here too many more years.\" Cigarette consumption, which had been falling about 2.5 per- cent annually over the past decade, plunged 9 percent this year in the wake of two big price increases that the tobacco com- panies imposed in the wake of the settlement. The Agriculture Department forecasts cigarette consumption to fall about 20 percent more over the next decade, nearly twice what it would have with- out the settlement. USDA, which stabilizes tobac- co prices by regulating produc- tion, has cut back sharply on how much tobacco that farmers could grow over the past two years and growers are bracing for another reduction next year. Tobacco production is con- trolled through quotas that farmers musr either rent or own in order to market their crops. This year, the quotas were reduced by 29 percent for burley tobacco, the type grown in Kentucky and Tennessee, and 17 percent for flue-cured, the vari- ety in North Carolina and Virginia. Because of the cuts, rents that farmers pay to quota holders are reported to have soared this year and are likely to go up again next year. Williams’ allotment has shrunk from 50 acres to 30 acres over the past two years. Congress is giving growers $328 million to offset this year’s lost income, and more help is coming; The tobacco companies are setting up a $5.2 billion trust a IW Twin Falls * 16th Annual Christmas Country Bazaar fjjL? <*** KnuII Community Grange Highway 74 MfliSKaflMlaal.tOBp* S**zfayX^Z7tfcW»*za_-5y»p J n. fund to compensate growers and quota holders for declining sales, with the first payments set to go out at the end of the year. Farmers also are likely to get a share of the states’ settlement. But that money probably won’t be enough to moke it worthwhile for less-efficient farmers to stay in business, espe- cially those who rent quotas, economists say. In Kentucky alone, tobacco farmers* income is down this year by 2S percent, or $250 million. “You have to have a certain amount of tobacco to make use of your barns, equipment and facilities,\" said Dixie Reaves, an agricultural economist at Virginia Tech. \"The small- and medium-size farmers who are not obtaining enough acreage to fully utilize their equipment and their bams are going to be the ones that are especially hard-hit.” Growers have been quitting the business in droves for sever- al years. A third of the nation’s tobacco farmers quit between 1992 and 1997, the latest period for which figures are available Williams, 53, also raises 50 beef cattle but he says he has few options to growing tobacco that make financial sense. \"Most of us have a big invest- ment in equipment and land. It’s not just a simple matter of get- ting out of forming and doing something else,\" said Williams. Besides, he said: “A farm means more to you than a piece of land. ... When it comes to the point that you have to sell out, then it's almost like cutting off an arm or leg or something.” V ‘JizjzdrrMdc Cjifts dr Cfnistmas T>toomtions by Local Artists ?

Twin Fifli, Idaho Sunday, Novomber 21, 1999 Magic Valley/Idaho Gun proposal meets opposition Father, son face charges in deadly shooting COEUR d’ALENE (AP) - Opposition from gun owners and concern from a state agency has convinced Kootenai County com- missioners to consider scaling back a proposal for restricting the use of firearms. A draft “unlawful discharge of firearms’* ordinance given to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for review would have made it illegal to fire a gun with- in 2S0 yards of any dwelling or vehicle. “The department opposes tills kind of regulation because it places unnecessary restrictions on hunters and on our hunting heritage,” Greg Tourtlotte, Fish and Game’s regional supervisor, said in a letter to Commissioner Dick Compton. Commissioner Ron Rankin said the county never intended to approve the draft ordinance as written, and that officials proba- bly would accept Fish and Game’s recommendations. The suggestions include reduc- ing the buffer zone to 150 yards, applying the restriction only to private land, allowing property owners to discharge firearms on their own land and exempting such “inhabited vehicles\" as motor homes, travel trailers and campers from the restriction on shooting near a vehicle. Violations would be misde- meanors subject to $300 fines and up to six months in jail. But Dave Tacheny, owner of Shooter Supply, is among a num- ber of people adamantly opposed to the Idea. \"Considering that we don’t really have a problem to begin with, I don’t really think it’s fair” Tnrhonv eni«t fair,\" Tacheny said. “I think that people who own firearms are damn sick and tired of getting their rights trampled on every time they turn around.” For THE RECORD BLACKFOOT (AP) - A son accused of murder and a father accused of helping him flee are scheduled to be arraigned Dec.

Juan Martinez-Rlos, 26, and Juan Martincz-Maldanado, 48, appeared at a preliminary hear- ing before Magistrate Charles Roos, who ordered them bound over for a plea appearance before 7th District Judge James Herndon. Martincz-Rios is charged with first-degree murder and using a firearm in the commis- sion of a felony. Martincz- Maldanado is charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder, two counts of aggravated assault on a police ing to elude an officer. Prosecutors allege Martin ez- Rios shot Rosales in the head with a 9 mm handgun during a neighborhood beer party at the .. Country Air trailer park. Martinez-Rios allegedly drove to the home he shared with- his parents after the shooting nhd that he and his father tried to escape in the father’s pickup truck. A neighbor of Rosales, Lupc Delacruz, testified during the preliminary hearing that she was watching through a window of her mobile home as Martin ez- •Rios pulled a pistol from the waistband of his pants and shot Rosales in the head.

I had convirfced myself that it >; was my own fault, or a freak acci- dent,” said Waeltz, of Round ;.Rock. “I still think A&M is n ; great school, but I can see now: ,';The supervision on the bonfire ;-was mediocre.” A&M administrators say stu- dent supervisors diligently train jtfcnd oversee younger bonfire porkers to ensure safety, with ijme result that the number of stu- ldents needing medical attention ],for bonfire-related injuries lias • declined in the last decade. They could not provide any statistics. ; In the late 1980s, between 55 , and 85 students a year typically ; were treated at the campus ; health center for injuries suf- • Ifcred while constructing the ipyre, said William Kibler, A&M j .'associate vice president for stu- [•dent affairs. He said the injuries | ranged from minor to severe, ; ,, About 5,000 students partici- pate each year in building the -bonfire, A&M officials estimated. ; In 1995, the year Waeltz was r hurt, the school’s vice president ‘for student affairs hailed that • year’s effort as “one of the safest w bonfires on record.” C • It's not dear if the vice presi- j^dent was aware of the injuries to f Waeltz, whose head was pinned ' Wider a log as it was loaded onto r a truck by a crew from his fresh* I man dormitory. With a two-inch *scar from a cut stapled in six -places, Waeltz, then 19, lost most ■ vision in one eye and suffered •'nausea for nearly a year. Many campus traditions linked to danger Texas A&M cadets comfort each other during funeral sarvlcei Saturday for the 11 bonfire workers who died Thursday. The university classified him as disabled under federal law and provided him with services such as seats at die front of class- rooms, free audio transcription of textbooks and extended time for taking tpsts. He also was eligible to file a claim under a university insur- ance policy that offers up to $5,000 to students to cover bon- fire injuries not covered by their families’ insurance policies. The so-called TAMU Aggie Bonfire Accident Medical Policy applies to injuries, deaths and dismemberments stemming from the annual fall event. A&M offi- cials were unable Friday to pro- vide details about the cost or number and type of claims filed agninst the policy. After his accident, Waeltz, a former honor student at Round Rock High School, performed poorly, losing his spot in a presti- gious engineering program and ultimately leaving school because of bad grades, Now 22, he has lost about a year toward graduation and attends Texas A&M at Kingsville. The year that Waeltz was injured, a joint faculty-student xommittee studying the bonfire said in a report that, despite existing safety precautions, “acci- dents continue to occur.\" In the Middle Ages, freshmen’s noses were pressed to grindstones - literally - ns an initiation into college life. At die turn of the cen- tury, mass fist-fights were com- mon on campuses around the United States. In the 1990s, student rites of passage have included everything from streaking across the first snow in Princeton to skinny dip- ping in the hot springs of the Yellowstone river in Montana. Tradition and danger have always formed a potent mix on 'College - \" campuses. Last Wednesday they produced disas- ter. Twelve people were killed and many more injured by the collapse of a 40-foot pyramid of logs being built for the annual football game bonfire at Tcxns A&M University. The blaze is a 90-year-old Thanksgiving tradition, so hal- lowed that students are willing to don hard hats and haul logs in order to be part of something big- ger than they’ve ever been pan of before. They want bragging rights to a memory they can cherish for all time. Students have sought the some for centuries. “College traditions and rituals are about bonding nnd belonging, about linking students of 1999 with those of 1909 and before,” says Hank Nuwer, author of \"Wrongs of Passage,\" a study of student rites through the centuries. \"They are about people knowing they can be accepted forever os pan of this noble tradi- tion.” Nuwer, who toadies journalism at Anderson University in Indiana, traces such “belonging rituals\" to the 4th century, when St. Augustine complained about a group called the “Overtumers\" tormenting new students in Carthage. “There was something very like the action of devils in their behavior,” Augustine wrote, noting dint once newcomers were accepted, they became “Overturners\" themselves, abus- ing the next crop of students. Things haven’t phnnged much. Despite serious attempts by campus administrators to curb college rituals over the years, tra- ditions persist, often fueled by alcohol and laced with danger. At Princeton, the annual “Nude Olympic\" sophomore sprint through die snow landed 10 peo- ple in a hospital last year, mostly Texas A&M University bonfire o tall wood on polo, was adopted 1947.

The event, which also drew complaints about women being groped by male stu- dents, has been officially banned by the university this year, although no one is counting on the ban being upheld. In Yellowstone National Park, rangers have tried for years to prevent students from Montana State University in Bozeman from \"hot potting\" - skinny dipping at a spot where hot springs boil up into the icy Yellowstone River.
