        "text": "An IT certification is a qualification that shows your competency in a specific field of information technology (IT). You typically need to pass an exam that tests your capabilities to earn a certification. Certifications arenât the only way you can get a job in IT. However, the right certification can benefit your career in many ways. A certification is an excellent option to consider if youâre looking for a structured way to learn new skills and earn a credential.\n\nAre IT certifications worth it?\n\nPotential benefits to getting a certification can include improved job performance and increased competitiveness in the job market. An IT certification on your resume can also be a quick way for hiring managers to gauge your abilities. Additionally, certifications are linked to higher incomes. IT professionals who received a raise due to getting a new certification saw an average salary increase of $13,000 [1].\n\n10 entry-level IT certifications\n\nThese are some common IT certifications designed to prepare you for entry-level positions in IT. The list includes entry-level certifications that are broad enough to expose you to a variety of skills, and certifications that will equip you with more specialized skills.\n\n1. CompTIA A+Â\n\nCompTIA A+ is widely considered one of the go-to certificates for a well-rounded entry-level introduction to IT. Those who pass the certification exams will be qualified to solve basic issues in networking, operating systems, security and mobile devices. The CompTIA A+ certification requires two exams.\n\nThe CompTIA A+ provides a general introduction to the IT world. From there, many IT professionals can go on to specialize in a specific field of IT, like networks, security, or cloud computing, either by building experience or gaining relevant certifications.\n\nCost: $246 per exam\n\nPotential jobs: Service desk analyst, technical support specialist, associate network engineer, desktop support administrator, system support specialist\n\nRequirements: Two certification exams required. There are no prerequisites to the exams, but CompTIA recommends having nine to 12 months of hands-on experience.\n\nCertification path: After the CompTIA A+, candidates can go on to take other CompTIA certifications like Security+ or Network+, or certifications from other providers like the CCNA.\n\nRead more: IT Certification Roadmap: A Guide\n\n2. Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)\n\nThe CCNA certification is an associate-level certification that covers the fundamentals of IT networking issues. This includes network access, IP connectivity, and IP services. Though itâs not a vendor neutral certificationâmeaning itâll test you exclusively on Cisco products and toolsâitâs popular among network professionals because of Ciscoâs dominance in the networking market. One exam is required to get the CCNA certification.\n\nCost: $300\n\nPotential jobs: Network specialist, network administrator, systems administrator, network engineer\n\nRequirements: One certification exam is required. There are no prerequisites to the exam, but Cisco recommends having a year of training and experience with computer networks.\n\nCertification path: After the CCNA, candidates can go on to take more advanced network certifications, like the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) or the Juniper Networks Certified Associate - Junos (JNCIA-Junos).\n\nRead more: 6 Network Certifications for Your IT Career\n\n3. CompTIA Security+\n\nThe CompTIA Security+ certification will equip you with the skills to perform basic security functions. The certification will cover subjects like encryption, physical security, and wireless security. It requires one exam. If youâre interested in becoming an IT security specialist, you can go on to take more advanced security certifications like the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) or the advanced Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).\n\nSecurity is a growing field, employing 4.7 million people globally according to the 2022 (ISC)Â² Cybersecurity Workforce Study. On top of this large global workforce, the study also identified a \"worldwide gap of 3.4 million cybersecurity workers\" [2]. If youâre interested in cybersecurity, check out other popular cybersecurity certifications.\n\nCost: $392\n\nPotential jobs: Security administrator, security specialist, security consultant, security engineer, network administrator, security analyst\n\nRequirements: Requires one certification exam. There are no prerequisites, but CompTIA recommends having the CompTIA Network+ certification and two years of experience in IT administration.\n\nCertification path: After the Security+, candidates can go on to take other security certifications like the ISC2 Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) or ISACA Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA).\n\n4. Microsoft Fundamentals\n\nThe Microsoft fundamentals certifications test core technology skills, making them good entry-level qualifications for those who are expected to work with Microsoft products. Knowing your way around Microsoft products is likely to be an in-demand skillâover half of surveyed IT decision-makers around the world said their companies would invest in Microsoft technology, Global Knowledge reports. The Fundamentals certifications replaced the Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA)Â certifications, which were retired on June 30, 2021.\n\nYou can opt to take any one exam in a number of specialized areas that fall under security, Azure (Microsoftâs cloud solution), AI, data, and software like Power Platform, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics. If youâre looking for a certification in an in-demand area, the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification will enable you to learn the essentials of Microsoft cloud concepts.\n\nCost: $99 per exam\n\nPotential jobs: IT specialist, Microsoft systems administrator, Microsoft server support technician, Microsoft Technician specialist\n\nRequirements: One exam is required for each certification. There are no prerequisites.\n\nCertification path: After a Microsoft Fundamental certification, candidates may go on to receive other certifications in various specializations like Azure Database Administrator Associate or Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate.\n\n5. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Practitioner\n\nCloud computing, along with security, is one of the most in-demand fields in IT, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is currently the most-used cloud platform in the world. So learning the AWS platform may give you an edge in this growing industry. The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is the most entry-level of the AWS certifications.\n\nThe AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is designed to help you gain foundational AWS knowledge, and can be great for those just starting out in IT. However, many cloud-related jobs ask for an associate-level AWS certification, which is a level above the practitioner certification. If you already have a year of experience with AWS, the associate-level AWS Solutions Architect, SysOps Administrator, or Developer certifications might better prepare you for entry-level cloud computing jobs. You can also consider other cloud certifications, like Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, or the Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification.\n\nCost: $100\n\nPotential jobs: Cloud engineering intern, cloud developer, cloud engineer, cloud architect\n\nRequirements: There are no prerequisites to the exam, but Amazon recommends having at least a basic understanding of AWS services and uses, and around six months of exposure to AWS.\n\nCertification path: After the AWS Cloud Practitioner, you can go on to get a more advanced certification like the AWS Certified Developer or AWS Certified Solutions Architect.\n\nRead more: 5 Cloud Certifications to Start Your Cloud Career\n\n6. CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)\n\nThe ITF+ is a beginning-level certification designed for those who want to see if IT is the right career path for them. If youâre a student or a career switcher still trying to see if IT is for you, this certification can help you decide. If youâre looking for a certification that will help you gain skills for a job in IT, other certifications like the CompTIA A+ might fit your needs better.\n\nCost: $134\n\nRequirements: No prior experience recommended\n\nCertification path: After the ITF+, candidates can go on to take the CompTIA A+ or other entry-level certifications.\n\n7. CompTIA Network+\n\nThe CompTIA Network+ is a foundational certification in networking principles. Unlike the CCNA, the Network+ is a vendor-neutral certificationâmeaning it doesnât test you on any specific device or technology. The Network+ is considered to be more basic than the CCNA, making it a good option for those who are just starting out in networking, or who find the CCNA too comprehensive for their current needs.Â\n\nCost: $358\n\nPotential jobs: Network administrator, network engineer, system administrator\n\nRequirements: No formal requirements, but the CompTIA A+ and 9 to 12 months of experience with networks recommended.\n\nCertification path: Many candidates go on to take the CCNA or other networking certifications after the Network+.\n\n8. GIAC Information Security Fundamentals (GISF)\n\nThe GISF is a foundational certification for security and related concepts like networking, cryptography, and cybersecurity technologies. GIAC recommends the certification for anybody new to cybersecurity who wants a fundamental introduction to the field, as well as those who can benefit from cybersecurity knowledge such as system administrators and non-IT security managers.Â\n\nCost: $949\n\nPotential jobs: Cybersecurity analyst, information security specialist, non-IT security manager\n\nRequirements: There are no formal requirements for the GISF\n\nCertification path: Those who take the GISF may go on to take the GIAC Security Essentials Certification (GSEC)\n\n9. Google Cloud Digital Leader\n\nThe Cloud Digital Leader is Googleâs foundational cloud certification. The certification exam will test you broadly on basic Google Cloud principles. Though many entry-level Google Cloud jobs request the next level certificationâthe Google Associate Cloud Engineerâstudying the material in the Cloud Digital Leader certification exam can give you a solid foundation in Google Cloud.\n\nCost: $99\n\nPotential jobs: Job-role independent\n\nRequirements: No formal requirements\n\nCertification path: After the Cloud Digital Leader, candidates can go on to take certifications that will equip them with entry-level job skills such as the Google Associate Cloud Engineer.\n\n10. Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)\n\nThe CAPM is a certification designed to prepare you for entry-level project management positions. Though not an IT certification, many IT positions and teams value project management skills. The CAPM can be worth pursuing if you have a technical background and are hoping to move into a more project management-oriented role.\n\nCost: $300 for non-PMI members, $225 for PMI members\n\nPotential jobs: IT project manager, IT project coordinator\n\nRequirements: No formal requirements\n\nCertification path: Candidates who want to continue on the project management path may go on to take the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.\n\nProfessional Certificates from tech industry leaders\n\nLearning from industry leaders in technology like Google and IBM is another way to expand your IT skill set and enhance your resume. You can explore your options in the sections below. Each of these Professional Certificates is self-paced and on the Coursera platform.\n\nGoogle IT Support Professional Certificate\n\nThe Google IT Support Professional Certificate aligns with the objectives covered in the CompTIA A+ certification.

Upon completion, you'll earn a shareable Professional Certificate from IBM.\n\nHow to get an IT certification\n\nGetting an IT certification generally entails picking a certification, preparing for the exam, and passing the exam. If you're thinking about earning a certification, these are the steps you should take:\n\n1. Decide on a certification. Pick a certification based on your interest and needs. If you need help figuring out where to start, take a look at job descriptions of positions you're interested in, and see which certifications are mentioned most often.\n\n2. Prepare for the exam. Preparing for the exam means ensuring you meet any requirements, scheduling the exam, paying for it, and studying for it. You could choose to study on your own or sign up for a course designed to prepare you for the test.\n\n3. Take the exam. You'll either take the certification exam online or in person. Make sure you check any requirements a day or two before the exam to ensure you remember important artifacts, like a valid ID.\n\nIf you're looking for a more detailed explanation, read about how to get an IT certification.\n\nIT professional salaries and career paths\n\nThe average entry-level salary in the US for IT professionals is $48,739, according to Glassdoor, as of September 2023 [3].
