        "text": "Starting his first business when he was in high school, Governor Greg Gianforte has spent his career creating jobs. In 1997, Greg and Susan Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies from their Bozeman home and grew it into the town’s largest commercial employer, creating over 500 high-paying Montana jobs.\n\nAfter 34 years in the private sector, Greg Gianforte was elected Montana’s 25th governor in November 2020, earning more votes than any candidate for governor in Montana history and with the largest margin of victory for a first-term governor since 1920.\n\nGovernor Gianforte’s experience as a businessman and entrepreneur guides his focus on expanding opportunities for Montanans, creating good-paying jobs, and protecting the Montana way of life. Governor Gianforte has delivered historic tax cuts, made Montana debt-free, provided record funding for education, raised teacher pay, boosted funding for law enforcement, and increased public access to more than 100,000 acres of public lands.\n\nUnder Governor Gianforte’s leadership, more Montanans are working than ever before, unemployment is at record lows, and Montana has set new records in job and business creation.\n\nMarried since 1988, Greg and Susan Gianforte raised their four children in Bozeman hunting, fishing, rafting, climbing, skiing and backpacking on Montana’s public lands."
