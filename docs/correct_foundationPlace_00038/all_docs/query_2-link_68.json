        "text": "You may or may not be aware of this but Bozeman has a thriving entrepreneurial community! With its growth over the past 5 years, this community has become important to our local economy. This community has been able to come together due to a perfect storm of factors.\n\nFactors affecting Bozeman’s Entrepreneurial Community:\n\nA high rate of entrepreneurs in the population.\n\nA high rate of new entrepreneurs who created a business by choice instead of necessity\n\nA mix of population that are native to the state and those that are moving here with capital and talent.\n\nA ready employment base, thank you MSU and University of Montana.\n\nLow cost of business.\n\nHigh rate of jobs created by each of these new entrepreneurial businesses.\n\nAll of this contributes to Montana being in the top ten states for business creation according to the Kauffmans Indicators of Entrepreneurship. I think that is pretty impressive!\n\nOriginally, Bozeman and Montana came to national attention with the establishment of RightNow Technologies in Bozeman and its sale to Oracle. There were many companies formed by former employees of RightNow and Oracle that stayed in Bozeman. These founders and their employees helped to knit together today’s entrepreneurial tech culture and community.\n\nThese days, there are all sorts of organizations that want to help start ups and people with great ideas. Most of advisors are really keen to continue to foster the entrepreneurial spirit and success in Montana. These groups will contribute their time, their expertise and even funding to help startups get off the ground.\n\n2020 is forecasted to be a banner year for investment in our state with more capital coming from inside the state as well as from outside the state. The one cloud on the horizon to continued growth of Montana’s tech business is finding enough qualified workers. Hopefully, our education system will be able to step up fast enough to help meet the demand for these skilled workers.\n\nTo learn more about the thriving entrepreneurial community in Bozeman, check out a few resources that are listed below:\n\nhttps://www.abcfoxmontana.com/all_abc_fox/early-stage-montana-looking-to-help-montana-based-tech-startups/article_fdbd4bc8-490f-11ea-bdeb-8ff989f2fb3a.html\n\nhttps://sbdc.mt.gov/startup\n\nhttps://www.prosperamt.org/\n\nhttps://mthightech.org/"
