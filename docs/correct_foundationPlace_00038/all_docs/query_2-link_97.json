        "text": "Greg Gianforte, 63 as of Election Day, was elected as Montanaâs governor in 2020, the first Republican to hold the position in 16 years in 2020. He originally ran for governor in 2016, losing to Democratic incumbent Steve Bullock. Gianforte was later elected as Montanaâs at-large U.S. representative in 2017 and reelected in 2018.\n\nA former technology entrepreneur who built Bozeman-based RightNow Technologies into a $1.5 billion business before selling it to Oracle in 2011, Gianforte has cut income taxes, capital gains taxes and reduced tax burdens for business equipment during his first term. He has signed into law government restrictions on abortion, religious freedom protections and school choice policies, and also established task forces intended to address housing affordability issues and property taxes.\n\nIn his campaign for a second term, Gianforte is pledging to grow Montanaâs economy and rein in government regulations.\n\nâFor too long, Montana hasnât lived up to our full, outstanding potential, and while weâve made great progress to reach our potential over the last three years, thereâs still more to do to create more good-paying Montana jobs, boost opportunities for all Montanans and protect our Montana way of life,â Gianforte told MTFP.\n\nGianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in 2017 after he physically attacked a journalist in the closing days of his 2017 congressional campaign. He was also formally warned by state game wardens after trapping a wolf in 2021 without completing a required certification course and fined $70 in 2000 after self-reporting that he had shot a spike bull elk in a district where hunting was restricted to brow-tined bulls, according to Lee Newspapers.\n\nThis biography is based on MTFPâs reporting on Gianforteâs first term, media reports, and other existing public records.\n\nCOMMON VOTING QUESTIONS\n\nWhen are Montanaâs 2024 elections?\n\nVoters will pick which candidates advance to the November general election in the June primary, which is scheduled for Tuesday, June 4. Voters will pick the candidates who will ultimately fill each office on the ballot in the November election, which is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nWho runs Montanaâs elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of stateâs office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of stateâs office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\nDo I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If youâre unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page. You can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After youâve filled it out, youâll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, youâll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driverâs license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\nCan I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their countyâs election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nDoes Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Courtâs March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driverâs license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you donât have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\nAre there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\nCan I vote online?\n\nNo, thatâs not an option in Montana.\n\nCan I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If youâre already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf youâre registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the My Voter page. County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the June 2024 primary election May 10.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your countyâs election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\nHow do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID and sign the precinct register, at which point youâll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\nI have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\n\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\nWho should I vote for?\n\nThatâs your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though."
