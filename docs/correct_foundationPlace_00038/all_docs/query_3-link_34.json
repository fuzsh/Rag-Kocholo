Prior to RightNow, Nitin was an institutional banker at Mellon and Bank of America, and held strategy consulting positions at Oracle, Siebel Systems, and Knova.\n\n3.

OutlineOMB mandateWhat is cloud computing?What does this mean to your agency?Where to begin Pilot case studiesQ&A\n\n5. “Pilot projects will be implemented to offer an opportunity to utilize more fully and broadly departmental and agency architectures to identify enterprise-wide common services and solutions with a new emphasis on cloud computing.”http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhaithaca/103153597/\n\n6. Administration Priorities for Infrastructure Modernization and Cloud Computing Pilots supporting the implementation of a cloud-computing environment include:End-user communications and computing—service deskPortals, collaboration and messaging—secure data dissemination, citizen and other stakeholder engagement, and workforce productivity.Content, information, and records management—delivery of services to citizens and workforce productivity.Workflow and case management—delivery of services to citizens and workforce productivity.Data analytics, visualization, and reporting—transparency and management.Enterprise Software-as-a-ServiceFY2010 Federal BudgetAnalytical PerspectivesCross Cutting Programshttp://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/crosscutting.pdf\n\n7. “The cloud will do for government what the Internet did in the &apos;90s…Rather than owning the infrastructure, we can save millions.” - VivekKundra, CIO\n\n8. “Cloud computing as a number of advantages, including reduced cost, increased storage, higher levels of automation, increased flexibility, and higher levels of employee mobility…The federal government should be exploring greater use of cloud computing where appropriate.”- Aneesh Chopra, CTO\n\n10. NIST definitionCloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources …that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\n\n11.

Location independent resource pooling\n\n18. RapidElasticity\n\n19. Measured Service\n\n20. Five characteristicsUltimately, it’s about providing a robust, scalable technology stack that lets your organization draw on the resources that you need, while focusing on program goals, not on deploying technology.\n\n21. Cloud Computing = SaaS\n\n22. Software as a ServiceThe Software as a Service cloud model typically includes all three layers, the infrastructure layer, the platform layer, and the software layer, making it truly ‘turnkey’.\n\n23. What does this mean for your agency?Points of impact\n\n24. Points of impactRapid provisioning and deploymentScalable, on demand capabilitiesInteroperable and standards based technologyReduced cost, faster results\n\n25. Rapid provisioning and deployment Since core technology is already in place, you can focus more on rapid adoption by end users and constituents, and less on the technology enablers.\n\n26. Scalable, on demand capabilitiesScalability means flexibility. As usage changes, a SaaS environment can adapt. The cost incurred is for the amount of service used; no sunk costs for unused hardware or software.\n\n27. Interoperable and standards basedSaaS based cloud environments represent the next generation of technology, and incorporate most technology standards. In the public sector, these include: 508FIPSFISMA (NIST 853)FDCCCommon Criteria\n\n28. Reduced cost, faster resultsSaaS based cloud environments greatly reduce costs due to: Multi-tenant infrastructure cost sharing\n\n29. Pay only for the services used, no unused license overhead\n\n30. Faster deployment as core infrastructure is already in placeEnabling the core mission of your agency or programThe primary benefit of cloud based technologies is that agencies can focus personnel resources and monetary resources on program goals rather than on implementing and maintaining technology.\n\n31. Where to beginHow can your program benefit from piloting the cloud?\n\n32. Where to begin“Pilot projects will be implemented to offer an opportunity to utilize more fully and broadly departmental and agency architectures to identify enterprise-wide common services and solutions with a new emphasis on cloud computing.”FY2010 Federal BudgetAnalytical PerspectivesCross Cutting Programshttp://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/crosscutting.pdf\n\n33.
