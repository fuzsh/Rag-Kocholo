        "text": "We are the Arbor Day Foundation\n\nWe’re a global nonprofit inspiring people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. In the face of a changing world, we’re scaling our efforts to plant 500 million trees by 2027 in areas where they’re needed most. With a strong network of global partners, a science-based approach, and more than 50 years of planting trees all over the world, we know what it takes to make it happen.\n\nHelp us plant more trees, educate more people, get more hands in the dirt, and support more lives across the globe.\n\nPlant Trees Now\n\nShielding a Sacred Tribal Food Source With Trees\n\nSalmon are inseparable from the culture of Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest. But they're up against critical challenges impacting both tribal lands and the climate as a whole. Find out how trees play a role in lessening some of these obstacles to their survival.\n\nSee how trees can help lessen some barriers to the survival of salmon.\n\nInside a High-Tech Nursery Supporting the Future of Forests\n\nIn a careful balance of science being led by nature, this high-tech nursery employs cutting edge techniques to grow upwards of 3 million seedlings each year. See how these young trees help National Forests across the American West recover more quickly from natural disasters.\n\nExplore a nursery where science is helping grow millions of trees every year.\n\nHow to Measure Biodiversity Using Trees\n\nAs a backbone of our ecosystems, the story of trees is inseparable from the story of biodiversity on this planet. With unprecedented biodiversity loss, it’s not enough just to plant trees — learn how we use science to plant them where they’ll have the biggest impact.\n\nLearn how science helps us safeguard biodiversity through trees."
