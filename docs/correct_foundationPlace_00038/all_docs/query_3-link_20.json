        "text": "I am supporting Steve Bullock for governor because he has the skills, experience and policy positions to foster a robust economy that allows entrepreneurs to create high-wage jobs across Montana and to make Montana a great place to live and work.\n\nI spent 13 years at RightNow Technologies, working closely with Greg Gianforte as chief financial officer, chief operating officer and senior vice president for customer experience. I am proud of what we built at RightNow and give Gianforte enormous credit for founding the business. That said, I don’t believe that his success in business translates to success in public service.\n\nUnder Gov. Bullock, Montana is ranked as the number one state for entrepreneurship four years in a row. Our wages are the sixth-fastest growing in the nation, and more Montanans are employed today than ever before. In the past four years under Bullock, Montana has created 20,000 new jobs. Our unemployment rate is about a full percentage point below the national average. This is because Bullock understands what attracts companies, big and small, to Montana: A strong public education system, access to public land, fiscal discipline, responsible investments in infrastructure, and a culture that welcomes all perspectives.\n\nGianforte has a record of opposing these things. Regardless of where he is from or how long he has been in Montana, he doesn’t share those values or support those policies. Technology companies in particular rely on employees who aren’t discriminated against. Yet Gianforte personally fought a non-discrimination ordinance in Bozeman and has donated more than $1 million to extreme anti-LGBT organizations. Many of the organizations Gianforte helps fund are behind job-killing discrimination laws in Indiana and North Carolina. These harmful policies cost those states tens of millions of dollars. Let me be clear: Those out-of-touch positions would deter companies, especially technology companies, as well as technology employees, from moving to Montana.\n\nWe have seen Gianforte’s position on public access near his house. He hasn’t committed to keep Montana’s public school funds in public schools or to expand our public school system to the pre-kindergarten level, something almost every other state in the country already has implemented. His tax proposals would eliminate Montana’s fiscal surplus. That surplus has been the underpinning of Montana’s highly favorable credit rating.\n\nWhile Gianforte is spending millions of his own fortune to tout his business credentials, he should be clear with Montanans about RightNow Technologies’ business model. The purpose of our business was to cut costs for companies, by eliminating and outsourcing jobs overseas with technology solutions for customer service. In conversations with RightNow investors, Gianforte explained one of the biggest drivers in our business has been the movement toward outsourcing. In fact, Forbes Magazine actually praised RightNow for “taking the concept of outsourcing to new levels.” And while it’s true we had approximately 500 employees in Montana, we had another 700 employees in other states and countries as well as outsourced jobs in Armenia and India. This was a very successful business model and produced profits for our owners, including Gianforte and myself, but it just doesn’t provide a model for governing our state.\n\nMontana’s business climate is strong and getting stronger. I’m proud to have been a part of it and will continue to help it grow. And I’m proud to support Steve Bullock, the candidate who has a proven record of getting things done — especially when it requires putting political differences aside and supporting common-sense policies and investments to keep Montana great for future generations."
