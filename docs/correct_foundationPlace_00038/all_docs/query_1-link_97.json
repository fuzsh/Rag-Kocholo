        "text": "Montanans elected Greg Gianforte as their state’s 25th governor on November 3, 2020. Gianforte received more votes than any candidate for governor in Montana history and won with the largest margin for a first-term governor since 1920.\n\nGianforte campaigned on getting Montana’s economy going again, getting Montana safely open for business, and getting Montanans back to work in good-paying jobs. He also focused on changing the way Helena and state government do business to better serve Montanans.\n\nAfter 34 years in the private sector, Gianforte served as Montana’s lone voice in the U.S. House of Representatives from June 2017 to January 2021. In Congress, Gianforte voted to cut taxes for every American taxpayer, roll back unnecessary, anti-jobs regulations, lower health care costs, and protect our Montana way of life, including our public lands.\n\nGreg and Susan Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies two decades ago in their Bozeman home, and they grew it into the town’s largest commercial employer, creating over 500 high-paying Montana jobs.\n\nGianforte spent his entire career focusing on creating jobs and opportunities. He founded five different startup companies. He’s worked to improve Montana’s economy through the “Better Montana Jobs” project. He also launched scholarship programs to help low-income students and veterans pursue the education and training they need to start a career in Montana.\n\nMarried since 1986, Greg and Susan Gianforte raised their four children in Bozeman hunting, fishing, rafting, climbing, skiing and backpacking on Montana’s public lands."
