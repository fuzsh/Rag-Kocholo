        "text": "Sometimes, it takes the right program to help fit the pieces of your future together.\n\nComing to St. Mary’s University after graduating from St. Mary’s High School in St. Louis, Eduardo “Ed” Lopez (B.S. ’22, M.S. ’23) knew he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps in construction.\n\nAfter earning his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and completing his Master of Science in Industrial Engineering and Management, Lopez was still figuring out how he wanted to use his degrees.\n\nDuring his time at the St. Mary’s School of Science, Engineering and Technology, Lopez took courses learning about the management side of construction management, an area of study he had not previously considered.\n\n“Learning about construction management helped me consider an avenue I never thought could be an option,” said Lopez, who was promoted to project engineer with Caddell Construction in January. “Having these courses opened the door to endless opportunities and helped me get to where I am right now.”\n\nCourse work covers materials and methods, estimating costs and safety precautions. Extending education specific to Construction Management can help train students to become project managers, project engineers, safety health officers or quality control representatives.\n\nValenzuela said job prospects in the San Antonio area look bright, with construction work expected to increase in the next few years.\n\nUsing connections made during his 15 years in the construction field, Valenzuela takes students on trips to construction sites where they can ask questions of professionals on site."
