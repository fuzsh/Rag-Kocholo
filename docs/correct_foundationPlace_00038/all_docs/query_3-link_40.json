        "text": "According to RightNow’s internal forecast, the revenue growth rate with the new strategy is 67%. In the pro forma balance sheet, I assume that line of credit, long-term debt, and shareholders’ equity stay the same. Other accounts grow at the same speed as revenue grows. From Exhibit 1, RightNow doesn’t need additional fund to support the strategy in 2004; instead, it could repay its debt.

Besides, the market for tech IPOs was still depressed in 2003, and there were not many optimistic signs in the marketplace. However, its competitor SalesForce.com was going IPO soon.
