        "text": "Virtuos signs partnership agreement with RightNow Technologies, Inc., a Nasdaq listed leader in Business-To-Consumer CRM Solutions with over 1800 customers worldwide. Virtuos and RightNow will initially work towards implementing cloud-based RightNow complete Suite to Industry Verticals such as Airlines & Travel, Consumer Electronics, and Retail.\n\nSpeaking on this significant milestone in a brief history of fewer than 90 days, Venky Vijay Reddi, CEO, said that “Virtuos has made significant progress in attracting the Global league of partners such as KANA, Maximizer, and now RightNow, a leader in the Cloud-based CRM for Customer Service. Being born in the cloud, Virtuos has constantly been looking for partners that can give us leverage our Cloud Expertise”.\n\nIn league with Virtuoso ground breaking rules Virtuos once again has stuck to its principles to forge partnership with the only world leaders. With the new partnership of RightNow Technologies, Virtuos is able to scale its operations across APAC and deliver “Customer Experience and Customer Service” Solutions with integrated Marketing, Sales, Feedback, Knowledge Management, Chat, Web-Self Service and Quote -to-Order Modules.\n\nVirtuos believes in the power of the cloud and how it could help organizations to adapt to CRM quickly. Cloud can bring scalability, quick innovation, adaptability, and resilient availability for employees and customers to collaborate in real-time anywhere across the channels. RightNow Technologies becomes a vital alliance partner for Virtuos in its progression to succeed and become a dominant market leader in the Indian market.\n\nBoth Yong Sheng Lee (Jun) and Venky Vijay Reddi have been in discussion to launch RightNow Technologies CRM for over two years; however, a decision to enter the Indian market was not seen positively by the US Headquarters. After seeing our runaway success in a short span of three months, RightNow has approached Virtuos to resume talks and initiate the practice in India.\n\nAbout RightNow Technologies\n\nRightNow Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: RNOW) provides customer relationship management software and services. The Company offers solutions that use self-learning knowledge-base to deliver customer self-service, email management, live interaction, issue tracking, and customer satisfaction measurement capabilities.\n\nAbout Virtuos Solutions"
