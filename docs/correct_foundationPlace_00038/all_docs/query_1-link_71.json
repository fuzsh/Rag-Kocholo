        "text": "Republican U.S. House candidate Greg Gianforte covered a lot of ground in a lively 15-minute talk recently to the Great Falls Pachyderm Club.\n\nHe took pithy political stands, fired a few jabs at his Democratic foe and regaled the Republican business and professional folks with anecdotes about his high tech business background.\n\nGianforte’s polished presentation to 20 Republicans who meet weekly at Rikki’s Pizza and Pasta belied the perception that he is a relative political newcomer, although in fact he was better known two years ago as a multi-million dollar software developer whose booming business had created Bozeman jobs than for being active in Montana political circles.\n\nBut that all changed last year when Gianforte ran a hard-fought but unsuccessful race for governor against Democratic incumbent Steve Bullock. Gianforte crisscrossed the state and spent more than $6 million in his personal money in a campaign in which both candidates and groups supporting them inundated Montana television viewers for months with campaign commercials.\n\nFor all his effort, Gianforte lost the race to Bullock by a 50 to 46 percent margin. He underperformed other Republicans who ran for statewide office in Montana in 2016, and even lost his home Gallatin County, a one-time Republican stronghold that also narrowly supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump for president.\n\nGianforte told the Great Falls Republicans he knew he was facing an uphill challenge last year since no GOP challenger had defeated a Democratic governor since 1952, when Republican businessman Hugo Aronson, “the Galloping Swede,” defeated Democratic Gov. John Bonner.\n\nIn a twist of political fate, Gianforte now finds himself in a race for Montana’s lone U.S. House seat in Washington, D.C. just a few months after battling so hard for the top state role in Helena just a few months ago.\n\nTrump nominated Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke for U.S. Interior secretary in mid-December, and Zinke was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 1. Bullock called a special election for May 25 for Montanans to choose Zinke’s U.S. House successor, creating a hurried 85-day campaign.\n\nGianforte, of Bozeman, will face Democrat Rob Quist, a popular musician and singer from the Flathead Valley, and Libertarian Mark Wicks, a cattle rancher from Inverness.\n\nGianforte handily won the Republican nomination at a party convention just a few days after he strategically launched a statewide commercial and declared he’d raised $1 million in campaign funds from 2,000 donors. Some thought his actions were designed to impress the delegates with his political clout and overwhelm a handful of veteran Republicans also seeking the post.\n\n“I was running to fight for Montana and took steps to make sure I could win the special election,” Gianforte told the Tribune, adding that neither he nor his wife donated money to this year’s campaign.\n\nMontana Sen. Ed Buttrey, a moderate Great Falls Republican who also sought the nomination, said he thinks GOP delegates who saw how hard Gianforte campaigned last year felt he deserved another shot at office. Buttrey said he thinks Gianforte needs to do a better job appealing to moderates and independents this time around, not just conservatives, and volunteered to help him.\n\nGianforte still spoke like a political outsider to Great Falls Republicans, who applauded and nodded at several of his comments.\n\n“I think voters are sick and tired of career politicians, and I would offer the refreshing change of somebody who knows what it’s like to start and grow a business here in Montana,” he said.\n\nThe computer software tycoon pledged to give Montana a strong voice in helping new President Trump “drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. and make America great again.”\n\nGianforte, 55, promised to “bring accountability back to Washington” by supporting term limits and balancing the budget.\n\nHe said he would create and keep Montana jobs “by reducing over-reach by federal regulators that are really strangling job creators.” He applauded Trump’s pledge to get rid of the Clean Power Plan, which mandates reductions in carbon emissions at power plants.\n\n“To eliminate 7,000 coal-related jobs in Montana, with negligible impact on carbon dioxide emissions, doesn’t make any sense to me,” he said.\n\nGianforte said he is a life member of the NRA and a strong gun rights advocate, and criticized Quist for supporting gun registration and a failing, government-run health care program.\n\nEarly this year Quist told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle he believes that legislation to register assault rifles should be considered, similar to registering cars. But Quist has since changed his stance, saying he supports the regulations currently in place. Quist has said he favors improving former President Obama’s Affordable Care Act rather than the Republican Party’s suggested changes.\n\nIn a line that may have raised eyebrows at another setting, Gianforte told the Republican group his business background “is not unlike” Trump’s, and he wants to help Montana and the nation flourish, just as he helped create top paying jobs for Montana as a high tech entrepreneur.\n\nGianforte said he and his wife Susan started RightNow Technologies in 1997 in a spare room of their Bozeman house. They developed a hugely successful software program that helped major consumer businesses improve their online customer response programs, and grew the company to 1,100 employees, half working in Bozeman and earning wages averaging $86,000 a year. Oracle purchased RightNow Technologies for more than $1.5 billion in 2011.\n\nWhile science and engineering “techies and nerds” are needed to launch some high tech businesses, as many as 90 percent of the workers at RightNow Technologies were involved in sales, administration, accounting, managing and other fields, Gianforte told the Republican group.\n\nBut Gianforte, whose father, two brothers, wife and three of their four children also are engineers like him, quipped that engineers “know how to solve problems — and can do math,” which he said is needed to cut the federal budget and bring discipline to the $20 trillion federal debt.\n\n“Gianforte is a good speaker, and more importantly has put a lot of thought into issues like cutting regulations that hurt business and encouraging more state involvement in managing federal lands,” said Art Dickhoff, a semi-retired Great Falls businessman.\n\nSome criticized Gianforte last year as a wealthy out-of-stater, Dickhoff said, but he considers him “a good man who has lived in Montana for more than 20 years, has prospered and is now trying to promote better jobs and ideas.”\n\nSince RightNow Technologies was sold in 2011, Gianforte said, he has worked to mentor some 200 other Montana business people, encouraged Montana graduates living out of state to return home and telecommute and helped Montana State University beef up its computer science program.\n\nGianforte reported income of $220.5 million between 2005 and 2014 and made federal and state tax payments of nearly $35 million during that span, according to tax returns Gianforte released to the Associated Press last year.\n\nGianforte’s tax returns also showed he reported donating more than $56 million in cash and in-kind contributions to charities and the Gianforte Family Foundation over that 10-year span, A spokesman said Gianforte actually donated nearly $110 million over that period, but not all of it was allowable for tax returns.\n\nThrough his family’s foundation, Gianforte has donated millions of dollars to religious organizations in the United States and Africa, conservative political organizations such as the Montana Family Foundation, scholarships for low-income students, community groups, universities and the arts.\n\nThe Gianforte Family Foundation also donated a large exhibit to the creationist dinosaur museum in the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in eastern Montana, which portrays views such as the Earth being about 6,000 years old, with dinosaurs and humans living at the same time.\n\nEarly computer whiz to later-life candidate\n\nGianforte, of Italian descent, was born in San Diego, Calif., and raised from age 3 through high school in Pennsylvania in the Valley Forge and King of Prussia area northeast of Philadelphia. His love of technical subjects may have come naturally; his mother was a public school math teaacher and his father was an engineer, the first members of their families to graduate from college.\n\nHe recalls mowing lawns in junior high school to earn a dirt bike. In high school he purchased his first Radio Shack TRS-80 and designed a software program to help a hospital shock and trauma department analyze data.\n\nAlthough he was elected class president his junior and senior years, Gianforte said he wasn’t particularly interested in politics.\n\nGianforte went to college to study engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., a respected technical college his father had attended. He graduated in four years in 1983, simultaneously earning both a bachelor’s in electrical engineering and master’s degree in computer science.\n\nRichard Widdicombe, a Stevens mentor of Gianforte and long-time friend, recalled Gianforte as “an extremely bright student with pioneering computer skills, but he was no nerd.”\n\nAs library director, Widdicombe hired Gianforte as a freshman to manage a team of students trying to build software systems for the library. Gianforte created a small skunkworks lab in the library basement and helped build interfaces between personal computers and a mainframe to help power library book circulation software that soon was adopted by other colleges.\n\nWiddicombe said Gianforte really liked Apple II computers and recommended that Stevens adopt a policy his senior year of requiring all freshmen to buy personal computers. Stevens, the first college to do so, also set up a limited intranet communications system on campus.\n\nGianforte had “a dynamic personality and can-do leadership skills,” Widdicombe said, but also enjoyed fun pranks and activities with his fellow students.\n\n“When paintball was emerging in 1982, and used oil-based paint that was hard to get off, Greg led student efforts to get games going,” Widdicombe said. That meant travelling to New York because paintball was still illegal in New Jersey.”\n\nWiddicombe said he was not surprised at Gianforte’s later computer engineering and business success “because he’s always been very creative and focused.”\n\nGianforte began his career at AT&T Bell Laboratories, a premier research institute. He met his wife Susan at a doughnut table there after both company engineers had donated blood.\n\n“It wasn’t a very romantic start, but worked out pretty well,” Gianforte said, noting they’ve been married 28 years, been both personal and business partners and raised four kids.\n\nGianforte said he has developed five software systems since college, most involving computer networking management systems.\n\nHe and his wife moved to Montana in 1995 because they loved the outdoors opportunities and wanted to raise a family here. He’d visited Montana to hike with a high school group that travelled from Philadelphia in vans and backpacked with a college friend in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area.\n\nGianforte said he gradually developed an interest in public service through a desire to help other people succeed as he and his wife had prospered. He said he became more inspired to serve after observing his longtime former RightNow Technologies colleague Steve Daines run successfully for U.S. House in 2012 and U.S. Senate in 2014.\n\nAs a business executive in 2002, Gianforte got involved in a potentially sensitive Montana political issue.\n\nHe told an interim state tax advisory committee that Montana’s tax system was unfriendly to high tech businesses. Montana’s income tax rates and capital gains taxes make it difficult for his business and other such companies to recruit the world-class executives they need who make salaries of $200,000 and up.\n\n“We’re thrilled to call Montana home,” Gianforte said, adding: “This tax code represents a huge impediment to business.”\n\nHe recommended Montana eliminate its state income tax and capital gains taxes and replace them with a sales tax.\n\nBut adoption of a sales tax is a tough sell in Montana, where voters overwhelmingly rejected ballot issues to enact sales taxes in 1971 and 1993. During last year’s race, critical commercials harshly criticized Gianforte’s earlier business support for a Montana sales tax.\n\nHowever, Gianforte has stressed for the last year that he is adamantly opposed to a sales tax. In fact, the \"zero\" in the 406 tax plan he proposed last spring while running for governor stands for no sales tax in Montana.\n\nCalled early favorite in House race\n\n“Gianforte probably has an early advantage over Quist, but has no lock on the race,” said Jeremy Johnson, associate political science professor at Carroll College. Other factors, including the popularity of Trump and Quist’s ability to raise money for a strong campaign, can enter in.\n\nMontana has been leaning Republican in recent elections, he said, and Gianforte gained name recognition with his hard fought race for governor last year.\n\n“He put a lot of energy into the 2016 campaign and met with many voters,” Johnson said.\n\nBut Gianforte lost to a popular incumbent, in part because he was not able to effectively address some of the questions raised about an earlier land access dispute and his financial support for groups that backed social conservative causes, Johnson said, adding that Democrats are likely to bring back some of their negative attacks against Gianforte.\n\nStill, Gianforte easily won the Republican House nomination over other qualified candidates, showing he has solidified his support among Republican decision makers, Johnson said.\n\nWhen a state holds a special election to fill a vacant congressional seat, it sometimes draws national attention and can become a referendum on the president or Congress, Johnson said.\n\nTrump won Montana over Clinton by a 56 to 36 percent margin last year, he said, “but that was then and this is now. If Trump’s popularity in Montana drops significantly because of issues like health care and budget cuts, it could reduce Gianforte’s chances.”\n\n“Both Greg Gianforte and Rob Quist are personable and relate well with people,” he added.\n\nJohnson did not think recent stories about Quist’ financial problems, including tax liens and lawsuits, will substantially impact the election.\n\nBoth candidates have some negative areas in their background that can be questioned, he said, and Quist’s “quintessential Montana background” appeals to many voters.\n\nWhere Greg Gianforte stands on issues:\n\n•Public land\n\n“I believe that public land should stay in public hands, and we should be looking for ways that states can have more say in how federal lands are managed,” he said. “I do not support deed transfer of federal lands.”\n\n•Healthcare legislation\n\nHe believes Obama Care is failing, with rates spiraling and people losing access because it’s becoming unaffordable. He supports repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a solution that brings premiums down and preserves access for rural Montanans. Gianforte said the Republican House proposal “didn’t do either of those things. We can do better.”\n\n•Trump’s proposed budget\n\n“The U.S. government has a $20 trillion budget and cannot continue to spend like a drunken sailor,” Gianforte said. He’s encouraged that Trump wants to bring discipline to the budget but promised to stand with Montana in making spending decisions.\n\n•Gun ownership and registration\n\nGianforte said he is a life member of the NRA and believes the Second Amendment is clear in saying the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That right should not be taken away except for good cause, such as a person who has committed a felony or has mental illness.\n\n• Abortion\n\nHe is pro-life, believes life is precious and should be protected from conception through natural death. “I believe we have an obligation to protect those who can’t protect themselves,” he said.\n\n•Gay Marriage\n\nHe acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court said gay marriage is OK, which is the law of the land. But personally believes as a Christian that marriage is between one man and one woman. He won’t force his views on anybody, but will fiercely defend every one’s right to their own beliefs.\n\n• Transgender bathroom\n\nGianforte doesn’t think men should be in women’s bathrooms. He favors accommodations for transgender citizens, such as single, unisex bathrooms."
