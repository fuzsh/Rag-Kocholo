        "text": "â[He has] game intelligence, spatial awareness, and technical ability,â said Assistant Coach Freddy Juarez. âYou give him time and space, he's either going to create an opportunity for someone else with his passing delivery, his vision, or heâll create something [of his own].â\n\nâHe was unselfishâ¦Heâs obviously been a 10 for most of his career, he was a very quality 10 when he when he was at Real Salt Lake, and that's when we brought him in,â said former Sounders midfielder Kelyn Rowe. âWhen you have a guy like Albert and Nico Lodeiro\\], and [JoÃ£o \\[Paulo\\] as well, that's an amazing midfield, but who's going to be the other [defensive] center with JoÃ£o, and Albert put his hand up and said 'I'll do it,' and he did it very well.â\n\nâI think I'm versatile enough to be able to play a few different positions,â said RusnÃ¡k. âAnd based on the team that we had when I came here, it was probably better suited for [for me] to play a little bit deeper.â\n\nâMaybe he wasn't getting the shine that he had been gaining before, but he was still being a big contributor,â said Juarez. âYou put that guy anywhere in the park, he's going to help the team out.â\n\nIt was a necessary position change for the teamâs sake. With RusnÃ¡k playing in a deeper role, the Sounders made history as the first Major League Soccer club to win CCL and book a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nâIt helps because I always say different positions on the field require you to do different things and so playing a year and a half in that No. 6 role has definitely brought some benefits,â said RusnÃ¡k.\n\nDuring the 2023 season, Seattle boasted one of the best defensive records across the league but was struggling in the attack. Midway through the year, RusnÃ¡k was given an opportunity to play in the No. 10 role. He responded by jump-starting the Soundersâ offense, scoring seven game-winning goals and propelling the team to the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference.\n\nRusnÃ¡kâs contributions in the attack helped him obtain three consecutive Team of the Matchday honors. He has also helped the team climb the standings to within striking distance of a top-four spot in the West while booking a spot in the U.S. Open Cup Semifinal.\n\nâIt feels good,â said RusnÃ¡k. âI have to train hard like I always do, and I feel like if I give my best for the team then the numbers will come themselves.â"
