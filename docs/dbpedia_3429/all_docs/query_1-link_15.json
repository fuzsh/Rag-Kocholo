        "text": "Originally, the pavilion was smaller and built of wood. Today, the building is made of stone and can be fully visited. Completed in 1769, it was extensively restored at the end of the 20th century so that the public could visit it. This curious building is planted in the east of the gardens of Drottningholm. It is unique in its kind. At the end of the 18th century, trade with China, via the East India Company in particular, allowed the Swedish monarchs to discover the beauty of porcelain and silk and to taste the tea of this distant empire, which they turned into a garden of Eden. Inspired by the observations of travelers and in particular the sketches of the architect William Chambers, Swedish painters and sculptors created \"chinoiseries\" which mixed Asian influences and the often distorted symbols of imperial China with typically European and Swedish ornaments.\n\nThe Green Room or Pleasure Room. Decorated with representations of nature and scenes of Chinese characters relaxing, covered with a pale green painting, this room overlooking the gardens was, with its windows open, a place where one could indulge in the pleasures of life: reading, music, and tea tasting."
