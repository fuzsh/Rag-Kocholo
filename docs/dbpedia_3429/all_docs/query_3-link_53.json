        "text": "The American Swedish Historical Museum is a place where Swedes, Swedish-Americans, and people of all nationalities who appreciate Swedish contributions to history, art, architecture, music, science and technology can come together.\n\nThe Museum is located on land that was once part of a 17th-century land grant from Queen Christina of Sweden to colonist Sven Skute. The main building was modeled after a 17th-century Swedish manor house, and the arcades are patterned after those of George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon.\n\nThree of the Museum’s 12 galleries are devoted to the history of the New Sweden Colony, established in the Delaware Valley in 1638. The museum provides a wealth of information about this often unfamiliar period in our history.\n\nCome and try Genline, the Web-based application that provides access to digitized images of Swedish Church Records. If you have Swedish ancestors that emigrated to North America during the peak years between 1881 and 1890, you can theoretically and reasonably find 500 or more ancestors in these records."
