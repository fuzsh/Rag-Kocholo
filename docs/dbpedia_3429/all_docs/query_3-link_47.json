        "text": "Philadelphia is filled with famous destinations known around the world. But beyond those celebrated institutions are a slew of museums, galleries, parks, and historical and cultural attractions even many lifelong Philadelphians might not be as familiar with.\n\nIn other words, if you thought you’d seen everything there is to see in Philly, think again.\n\nLook past the Philadelphia Museum of Art to boutique galleries concentrating in media like clay (The Clay Studio), wood (Museum for Art in Wood) and fabric (Fabric Workshop and Museum). Go beyond the Bell to historical museums like the Antique Ice Tool Museum and Lest We Forget Museum of Slavery, family-friendly collections at The Stoogeum and American Helicopter Museum, and halls of intellectual exploration like The Rosenbach and Wagner Free Institute of Science.\n\nAnd hidden Philadelphia is more than just museums. It’s historic homes and gardens with names like Grumblethorpe, Cliveden, Wyck and Chanticleer. Its incredible parks from Bowman’s Hill Wildflower Preserve to Cira Green to Ringing Rocks. It’s about fun spaces to learn about vampires, trains and potato chips — at VAMPA, SEPTA Transit Museum and Herr’s Snack Factory Tour, respectively.\n\nAn important note: Many of these museums and attractions are open seasonally or just a few days (or hours!) per week. Always check online or call ahead before visiting.\n\nHere are over 40 of Philly’s best under-the-radar and off-the-beaten-track sites to avoid the crowds and see something new.\n\nNote: The attractions in this article are listed in alphabetical order by section.\n\nOpened in 2019, the immersive John James Audubon Center at Mill Grove museum and nature facility occupies the site of famed ornithologist and environmentalist John James Audubon’s historic 18th-century home. Visitors can explore galleries and exhibits on conservation and art, an outdoor birdwatching area and an interactive exhibit that allows individuals to experience the earliest stages of a bird’s life from egg to first flight. The center rests adjacent to the historic house, barn and nature trails located on the farm where an 18-year-old Audubon lived when he first arrived in America in 1803.\n\nWhere: John James Audubon Center at Mill Grove, 1201 Pawlings Road, Audubon\n\nread more\n\n22\n\nThe Rosenbach\n\nA subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia, The Rosenbach in Rittenhouse Square is an intimate literary museum and research library located inside two 19th-century townhouses that were the home of brothers and international rare art and book dealers Dr. A.S.W. and Philip Rosenbach. Opened to the public in 1954, the library houses over 130,000 manuscripts and 30,000 rare books, including some of the world’s most famous literary and historical objects, including Bram Stoker’s notes for Dracula, a handwritten manuscript of James Joyce’s Ulysses, the second folio of William Shakespeare’s plays and papers from poet Marianne Moore.\n\nWhere: The Rosenbach, 2008-2010 Delancey Street\n\nread more\n\n26\n\nFort Mifflin\n\nPredating the Declaration of Independence, Fort Mifflin is the oldest active military facility in the nation. The fort saw its heaviest action in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, both in the Battle of Red Bank (beating back a British invasion and destroying two warships) and the Battle of Mud Island (where 400 American soldiers held off 2,000 Redcoats until Washington could withdraw to Valley Forge). Today, visitors can tour the historic grounds and Revolution-era buildings, watch reenactments, picnic or investigate paranormal activity. The fortress at the eastern edge of Philadelphia International Airport is also a hotspot for aerophiles.\n\nWhere: Fort Mifflin, 1 Fort Mifflin Road\n\nread more\n\n31\n\nGlen Foerd\n\nThe historic mansion and gardens known as Glen Foerd, once one of many manors along the river in Northeast Philadelphia, is now the only remaining 19th-century estate open to the public. Located in the Torresdale neighborhood at the confluence of the Delaware River and Poquessing Creek, Glen Foerd has attracted visitors for generations, featuring 18 acres of rare trees and flowering shrubs outdoors with a diverse collection of fine paintings, prints, sculptures, antiques, tapestries, books, religious artifacts and glassware on display inside.\n\nWhere: Glen Foerd, 5001 Grant Avenue\n\nread more\n\n32\n\nGrumblethorpe\n\nErected in 1744, Grumblethorpe — named for the manor in the novel Thinks I To Myself — belonged to German immigrant John Wister and his family who occupied the estate for over 160 years. During the Battle of Germantown (see Cliveden, above), the house was occupied by British Brigadier General James Agnew, who was shot and killed by a sniper in the front parlor. (His bloodstains are still visible on the floor.) Grumblethorpe was also a working farm, dominating horticultural trends for two centuries, and the estate’s gardens feature wisteria (named after the Wister family) and one of the oldest female gingko trees in North America.\n\nWhere: Grumblethorpe, 5267 Germantown Avenue\n\nread more\n\nAn understated facade fronts the three-story former home of opera singer, humanitarian and Civil Rights icon Marian Anderson in the Graduate Hospital neighborhood. The National Marian Anderson Museum celebrates the life and work of the contralto, the first African American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Anderson is best remembered for her 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial — singing outdoors to 75,000 attendees because Constitution Hall refused to allow her to perform indoors — but she first honed her talents before parishioners at Union Baptist Church just across the street from the museum.\n\nWhere: National Marian Anderson Museum, 762 Martin Street\n\nread more\n\n— Photo courtesy Visit Bucks County\n\nBring your own hammer (no joke!) to Ringing Rocks Park, a seven-acre field of hulking round stones that respond to strategic whacks and thumps with the sound of ringing bells. Climb onto the field and start banging away on the primordial igneous diabase boulders to experience an unexpected and unforgettable melodic geological sound created by a combination of melting permafrost, weathering and rock shape. Once through the boulder field, visitors can continue on into the 123-acre park, a dense forest for hikers, bikers and picnickers which also features High Falls, Bucks County’s highest waterfall.\n\nWhere: Ringing Rocks Park, Ringing Rocks Road, Upper Black Eddy\n\nread more\n\nCome for Philadelphia.
