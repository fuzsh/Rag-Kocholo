        "text": "Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl built Hallwyl House, their dream house, in Stockholm in the 1890s. It was, for its day, Sweden’s costliest and most modern home, with unheard-of luxuries such as electric lights and central heating. After filling it with their art collection and finest furnishings, sourced from around Europe, the Hallwyls bequeathed it to the city on one condition: Nothing could be changed.\n\nIt remained much as they left it, a Mediterranean-style palazzo and now museum about the Hallwyls and their collections in the heart of the city, until this year, when something new and shocking happened: For the first time ever, the elegant inner courtyard is now home to a restaurant and bar that opens at 10:00 a.m. and keeps going until 2:00 a.m. Launched in May (closing in September for the season) it serves classic bistro food, plus boxes of Wonderboo, a Swedish brand of designer dog food, to keep pooches happy. The brain behind the restaurant is Robert Hållstrand, who also runs nearby nightlife hotspots Rose and Fou. He says the French food is inspired by the Hallwyls’ tastes, but perhaps he’s just saying that to be polite or to appease the ghosts that must surely haunt the place. Regardless, it’s one of the prettiest outdoor restaurants in town—and a resounding hit with 21st-century Swedes."
