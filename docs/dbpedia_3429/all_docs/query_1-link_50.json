        "text": "1. Can’t Stop the Music\n\nBalboa Park’s historic Spreckels Organ Pavilion boasts the world’s largest outdoor pipe organ — and every Sunday at 2 p.m. throughout the year, rain or shine, the pavilion hosts a free organ concert. On top of that, there are two separate, free summer music series at the pavilion: the Summer International Organ Festival, with musicians joining the organist at 7:30 p.m. each Monday; and the Twilight in the Park series of non-organ summer concerts at 6:30 p.m. every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n2. See for Free at the Museums\n\nSeveral of Balboa Park’s great museums offer spaces, events and more that are free and open to the public. Admission to the Timken Museum of Art is always free, giving visitors amazing access to the Timken’s prized collection, featuring works by Rembrandt and other masters. At the Mingei Museum, the Commons Area, which boasts an exhibition of objects from the folk-art museum’s collection, also offers free admission. And the full Mingei is always free for those 17 and under.\n\n3. Beauty is Blooming\n\nBalboa Park bursts with gardens that are free to stroll through and admire. Among the favorites are the exquisite Inez Grant Parker Memorial Rose Garden, just across the pedestrian bridge from the signature Bea Evenson Fountain and the Natural History Museum. Right next to the rose garden is the Desert Garden, with its wealth of prickly cacti and delicate succulents. The stately Alcazar Garden just west of the Mingei Museum comes alive with floral colors, while the nearby Kate O. Sessions Cactus Garden carries on the legacy of the “Mother of Balboa Park.” And those are just a few of the park’s many and varied gardens.\n\n4. Playtime at the Park\n\nTrue to its standing as a great destination for families, Balboa Park offers several large playgrounds for the youngest visitors. The biggest are the Pepper Grove Playground along Park Boulevard, and the Sixth Avenue Playground on the park’s opposite side. Both offer play structures, swings, picnic areas, restrooms and broad swaths of lawn.\n\n5. Delightful Dining Outdoors\n\nSpeaking of picnic areas, Balboa Park offers near-endless options for enjoying food and drink out in the fresh air. Among the favorites are the lawns outside the Botanical Building, with great views of the Lily Pond (the Botanical Building itself is currently closed for reconstruction); and the shaded tables and large lawns at Pepper Grove. Numerous spots also allow alcoholic beverages during daytime hours; learn more here.\n\n6. Art at No Charge\n\nArt lives free at Balboa Park, which boasts numerous sculptures and other works that are accessible to the public at no charge. The San Diego Museum of Art’s “Art of the Open Air” program has installed a variety of sculptures in the Plaza de Panama outside the museum. Admission to SDMA’s May S. Marcy Sculpture Garden, which features works by Rodin, Calder and other modern masters, is also free. And just across El Prado is Niki de Saint Phalle’s beloved “Nikigator,” a climbable kids’ favorite that sits outside the Mingei Museum.\n\n7. A Village of Visual Riches\n\nJust south of the San Diego Zoo is a zone that’s an art installation all its own: The Spanish Village Art Center. Home to numerous local artisans and craft studios, the village is alive with color and creativity. It’s a great place to stroll through and view the works on display. Live music and art festivals are also often part of the mix.\n\n8. WorldBeat Wonders\n\nHoused in a former water tower along Park Boulevard, Balboa Park’s WorldBeat Center is well worth a visit for its unique digs, artistic flair and Healing Peace Garden, as well as its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Bold murals dominate the center’s exterior, while the interior houses multiple galleries and small shops. Keep an eye out for free events at the always vibrant WorldBeat, a Balboa Park institution for nearly 30 years.\n\n9. Country-hopping at the Cottages\n\nWhy travel the whole wide world when you can experience 32 different cultures in one convenient place? Balboa Park’s House of Pacific Relations is a longtime favorite for its collection of International Cottages, each representing a different nation or culture. The cozy community comes alive on weekends, with free open houses at the cottages (on a rotating basis) between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Saturdays-Sundays, plus a lawn program hosted by one of the member cultures each Sunday at 2 p.m. With live music, food samples and more, it’s a fun and enlightening way to spend an afternoon.\n\n10. Seasonal Fun and Festivities\n\nSome of the park’s free events are geared toward the winter holidays and other occasions. Each November, the Old Globe Theatre hosts its grand Christmas Tree Lighting on Copley Plaza outside the theater complex. (Attendance is free but reservations are required.) As the holidays draw closer, the park hosts December Nights, a sprawling celebration that boasts food, music and plenty of festive happenings. And in April comes EarthFair — the largest free environmental festival in the world — featuring a children's parade, booths, educational exhibits and more.\n\n11. World-Class Walks\n\nBalboa Park’s status as America’s largest urban cultural park means it covers a lot of ground — and one way to explore its farther reaches is via the park’s many hiking trails. While the strolls vary in length, virtually all are easy to accomplish, and can provide new perspectives on the park — from an arid adventure in Florida Canyon to a loop through the scenic gardens. Balboa Park also serves as the starting point for the one-of-a-kind Seven Bridges Hike, a 5.5-mile loop that takes in some of San Diego’s most scenic and historic spans.\n\n12. Fun for Four-legged Friends\n\nFor those with canine companions, there’s a place in Balboa Park, too. Actually, three of them: Nate’s Point Dog Park in the West Mesa area; the Morley Field Dog Park across Florida Canyon; and the Grape Street Dog Park (the largest of the three) on the edge of the South Park neighborhood. All offer off-leash areas and amenities.\n\n13. A Fast Track to Excitement\n\nA mecca for bike racers from around the region, the San Diego Velodrome — located at the Morley Field Sports Complex — hosts frequent competitions that are free to watch. Witness racers zip around the banked turns of this fast track, which has hosted the USA Cycling Collegiate Track National Championships.\n\n14. Picture-perfect Memories\n\nWhatever you do in Balboa Park, you’ll want to take plenty of pictures. And you definitely won’t be alone: A 2022 Yelp survey named the park No. 1 on its list of the most photographed landmarks in the United States and Canada. Once you’ve been there, you’ll see why: Amazing subjects and backdrops for photos are everywhere, from the soaring California Tower to the classic Laurel Street Bridge to the spectacular garden blooms. And snapping a pic is always free.\n\n15. Getting There and Getting Around"
