        "text": "Stockholm is one of the most exciting cities in Europe in my opinion, and is full of unique things to do. For art lovers like me, museums are on the priority list. Stockholm is home to a variety of wonderful museums, from the recently refurbished National Museum to the edgy Fotografsika, there is something for everyone here.\n\nWhile big museums will undoubtedly be on the list, there are also several hidden art gems in Stockholm, including house museums and smaller galleries with beautiful views.\n\nSeeing art in Stockholm is a great way to engage with the country’s culture and each museum is near other great destination in the city. Here are Stockholm’s best art museums.\n\nThe Moderna Museet in Stockholm is a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts. From the iconic works of modern masters like Picasso, Matisse, and Braque, to thought-provoking installations by emerging artists, the museum boasts a collection that spans multiple genres and mediums.\n\nThe Moderna Museet displays modern art from Sweden alongside its international collection, introducing visitors to the rich artistic history of the nation.\n\nWith its sleek and innovative architecture, the exhibition spaces extend intuitively in separated sections, meaning that the curators are able to tell several stories within the museum. I enjoyed the layout and design of the museum, perhaps even moreso than the art on display.\n\nAlong the long corridor there is an eclectic hang of modern art across time and place, drawing visual connections between unrelated works.\n\nMy personal favourite bit of the Moderna Museet is the Art Library, where visitors can choose which artworks they want to see from a computer screen. A panel with the artwork is then brought down from storage above to eye level. It’s essentially a jukebox for art, and an extremely clever way of making art in storage accessible to the public.\n\nThe Moderna Museet is located on Skeppsholmen, a small island easily accessible by walking from the centre.\n\nWhile you’re here—try the ice cream at Glassverkstan Skeppsholmen. The lemon cheesecake is one of the best ice creams in Stockholm.\n\nNationalmuseum\n\nThe Nationalmuseum in Stockholm stands as a testament to Sweden's rich cultural heritage and artistic legacy. Established in 1866, the museum boasts a fascinating history that traces back to the era of Gustav III.\n\nThe entrance hall of the Nationalmuseum is stunning, with floor to ceiling murals covering the walls and paying homage to the art history represented inside.\n\nVisitors are treated to an extensive collection spanning centuries, from classical antiquities to contemporary works. The museum is arranged chronologically, starting at the top floor in the 1500s and becoming increasingly modern on the way through.\n\nEach section is complete with its own colour scheme, a fun way of breaking up the timeline and creating a unique atmosphere for the artistic eras. I loved traveling through all these different colours to see how art changed over Sweden’s history.\n\nThe museum is pristine after its recent refurbishment, opening to the public in 2018 after 5 years of closure.\n\nWhether you are drawn to the masterpieces of Rembrandt, Dürer, or Zorn, or wish to explore the intricate beauty of Swedish craftsmanship, a visit to the Nationalmuseum promises an enlightening journey through the country's artistic heritage.\n\nArtipelag\n\nArtipelag is a captivating museum located in Stockholm’s archipelago, creating a unique day trip out of the city.\n\nLocated amidst the breathtaking archipelago of islands around Stockholm, this museum beautifully combines art, architecture, and nature, providing visitors with a harmonious environment in which to explore various forms of contemporary art.\n\nArtipelag boasts an impressive collection of modern art exhibitions, ranging from paintings and sculptures to photography and installations. Its tranquil setting allows visitors to not only engage with the art but also appreciate the stunning natural surroundings. Currently on display is an immersive exhibition of Monet’s paintings.\n\nTo reach Artipelag, one can take a boat from the city center, creating a scenic journey that sets the tone for the museum visit.\n\nFotografsika\n\nFotografsika is a premier museum dedicated to photography. From historical black and white photographs to contemporary experimental works, there is something here to captivate every visitor.\n\nFotografsika is located in Södermalm and is easily reachable by public transportation. Perhaps more fun, however, is the dedicated boat departing from Nybroviken directly to Fotografsika which sits on the edge of the water.\n\nVisiting Fotografsika is an absolute must for anyone seeking to dive deeper into the fascinating world of photography.\n\nFotografsika also has a vibrant rooftop eatery and cafe serving up sustainable and delicious food all day, plus DJ sets in the evenings. The restaurant has a green Michelin star, so they’re certainly doing something right.\n\nWith late open hours, Fotografsika is an easy visit while in Stockholm and a unique one amongst other art museums.\n\nWaldemarsudde\n\nLocated on the picturesque island of Djurgården in Stockholm, Waldemarsudde is known as Stockholm’s most beautiful art museum, and is my personal favourite.\n\nThe gallery space, mansion, and lush garden dotted with sculptures captures the essence of Prince Eugen’s artistic legacy.\n\nThe museum, once the private residence of this renowned Swedish artist and prince, offers visitors a unique glimpse into the history and visions of its former resident. With a rich history dating back to the early 1900s, Waldemarsudde showcases an extensive array of Prince Eugen's diverse artwork, including landscapes, portraits, and sculptures. The museum also houses temporary exhibitions that explore modern Swedish art.\n\nThe museum’s location on the waterfront gives it a sparkling atmosphere that often reminded me of the French Riviera when visiting on a sunny day. It really is like stepping into another world, and is totally wonderful.\n\nThe easiest way to get to Waldemarsudde is to take the number 7 tram into Djurgården. While here, make sure you visit Rosendals Trädgårdskafé, the wonderful cafe at the Rosendals farm nearby.\n\nSven-Harry Art Museum\n\nThe Sven-Harry Art Museum is located north of the city centre, in the Vasastan neighbourhood. A hidden gem for modern art, the Sven-Harry Art Museum displays international and Swedish modern art.\n\nSven-Harry Karlsson was a collector whose vast collection is now shown together at this gleaming brass museum. There is even a full reconstruction of his home, to give the sense of the art and life together.\n\nOne of the highlights of Sven-Harry Konstmuseum is its rooftop sculpture garden, offering panoramic views of the city. It's a perfect spot to take a moment and appreciate the beauty of Stockholm while surrounded by thought-provoking sculptures. The combination of contemporary art and the scenic views creates a unique and immersive experience for visitors.\n\nTo reach Sven-Harrys Konstmuseum, you can take the subway to Odenplan station and then enjoy a short walk through the charming streets of Vasastan. There’s lots of lovely places to eat around here, and if you’d like a treat afterwards, check out Snow ice cream, Lillebrors Bageri or Stora Bagariet.\n\nHallwyll Museet\n\nSituated in the heart of Stockholm's city centre, the Hallwyl Museum is a mansion turned museum, offering a glimpse into the lives of the Hallwyl family, one of the most wealthy families in Swedish history.\n\nOriginally built as a private residence, the Hallwyl Museum showcases an impressive collection of art, furniture, textiles, and decorative objects amassed by Count and Countess von Hallwyl during their extensive travels.\n\nThe museum's collection includes a diverse range of artefacts, such as ancient Egyptian antiquities, Renaissance tapestries, and intricate silverware, reflecting the family's eclectic tastes and interests. Each room tells a story, providing a window into the lavish lifestyle and cultural pursuits of the Hallwyls.\n\nThe Hallwyl Museum is small but packs a punch in terms of the sheer opulence of the place, and is well worth a visit.\n\nTo reach the Hallwyl Museum, you can easily walk from Stockholm's central area or take public transportation to Kungsträdgården station, located just a short distance away.\n\nAfter immersing yourself in the elegance and history of the Hallwyl Museum, I recommend taking a stroll along the nearby waterfront promenade or exploring the vibrant streets of Gamla Stan, Stockholm's charming old town.\n\nGustav III’s Antiksmuseum\n\nA jewel within the Royal Palace, Gustav III's Antikmuseum is a true treasure trove of antiquity. Established by King Gustav III of Sweden in the late 18th century, this museum demonstrates the king’s passion for the classical world.\n\nThe museum showcases a variety of sculptures from Ancient Greece and Rome displayed in a neoclassical manner with its striking white interiors and checked marble floors.\n\nThis museum is only a small section of the Royal Palace as a whole, and must be visited in conjunction with the rest of the site. Other areas to visit include the Royal Apartments and the Treasury.\n\nCarl Eldhs Ateljémuseum\n\nSituated in the tranquil district of Bellevue in Stockholm, Carl Eldh's Ateljémuseum is a hidden artistic oasis dedicated to the renowned Swedish sculptor Carl Eldh. This intimate museum offers a unique opportunity to immerse oneself in the creative world of one of Sweden's most celebrated sculptors of the early 20th century.\n\nThe Ateljémuseum is housed in Eldh's former studio, which he designed himself with meticulous attention to detail. The space has been lovingly preserved, giving visitors a glimpse into the artist's working environment and creative process. Stepping into the atelier, you'll be surrounded by an array of sculpting tools, sketches, and unfinished works, offering an intimate insight into Eldh's artistic journey.\n\nThe museum showcases a comprehensive collection of Eldh's sculptures, ranging from grand monumental pieces to smaller, more delicate works. Each sculpture exudes a sense of beauty and emotional depth, capturing the essence of the human form and expressing a profound understanding of the human condition.\n\nIn addition to Carl Eldh's works, the museum also features temporary exhibitions that celebrate the legacy of Swedish sculpture and showcase the works of contemporary artists. These exhibitions add a dynamic element to the museum, fostering a connection between the past and the present in the world of sculptural art.\n\nDrottningholm Palace\n\nLocated on the picturesque island of Lovö in Lake Mälaren, Drottningholm Palace stands proudly as a UNESCO World Heritage site, embodying the rich cultural heritage of Sweden. With origins dating back to the 17th century, this palace serves as an official residence of the Swedish royal family and is one of the most remarkably well-preserved sites from this era.\n\nDrottningholm was inspired by Versailles, which is clear with its elegant proportions and opulent design. I was struck by its picturesque facade sitting on the banks of Lake Mälaren and the Baroque and Rococo influence in the interior design.\n\nThe state apartments, adorned with exquisite details, and the dazzling Chinese Pavilion each contribute to the narrative of the royal family's lives and the prevailing cultural trends of their time. Despite the opulence of the design, my favourite parts were the built-in stoves and the hand-painted details on the walls. I love those charming, authentic moments of Swedish design.\n\nThe site also includes the Slottsteater, a period theatre in perfect condition which is possible to view on a guided tour or even for a performance.\n\nTo access Drottningholm Palace, I’d recommend taking a scenic boat trip from central Stockholm, passing the picturesque surroundings on the way to the island. Alternatively, a convenient metro and bus journey is a quick and easy option.\n\nThielska Galleriet\n\nWith the backdrop of the scenic Djurgården, Thielska Galleriet is a haven for art lovers. This mansion-museum houses a collection of international and Nordic art from the turn of the century.\n\nThe elegant building was home to Ernest Thiel, a prominent financier whose art collection became open to the public here in 1926.\n\nThielska Galleriet boasts an impressive collection of paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts by prominent Nordic artists such as Anders Zorn, Eugène Jansson, and Edvard Munch. Thiel was an important patron of these artists and many became his friends, spending time at the house which is now the museum.\n\nLocated on the far side of Djurgården, you can take bus 67 to reach the gallery. There’s much more to explore on this beautiful island, so a bike ride or walk around the area is a good idea.\n\nNordiska Museet\n\nPerched atop the tranquil island of Lidingö, overlooking the sparkling waters of the Stockholm archipelago, Millesgården Museum is a breathtaking museum with a focus on sculpture. This unique museum is dedicated to the life and works of the renowned Swedish sculptor Carl Milles, offering visitors a captivating journey through his masterpieces and the beauty of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe museum is housed in Millesgården, the former home of Carl Milles and his wife, the artist Olga Milles. The elegant residence, nestled amidst lush gardens and terraces, creates a serene and enchanting setting for exploring the artist's legacy.\n\nThe sculpture garden houses a collection of Milles’ sculptures, placed amidst water features to evoke a serene atmosphere.\n\nInside the museum, carefully constructed spaces create a classical architectural forms that feel much older than they are (most of the house was built in the early 20th century).\n\nIt’s easy to get to the museum, despite it being outside of Stockholm city. Take the metro to Ropsten and then a quick bus, and you’re already transported into a peaceful oasis.\n\nThe best art museums in Stockholm\n\nStockholm's art museums offer a captivating and diverse experience, showcasing the city's rich cultural heritage. From the enchanting beauty of Waldemarsudde to the majestic Drottningholm Palace, each museum tells a unique story and invites visitors to immerse themselves in the beauty and history of Swedish art and culture."
