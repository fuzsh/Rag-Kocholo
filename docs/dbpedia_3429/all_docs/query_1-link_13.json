        "text": "St. Mark’s Church, built in 1964 for a new suburban parish in Stockholm, includes a meeting room attached to the church and a row of single-story offices with a low belfry, where the bells are rung by hand in the English manner rather than by an automatic carillon. The little, villagelike complex of buildings is set among birch trees. The covered porch at the entrance to the church is actually a freestanding structure.\n\nSigurd Lewerentz enjoyed fame early in his career, which passed from an early Classical phase to a Modernist one. However, he spent a long period in the middle of his life making windows because he lacked building commissions. In 1956, when he was 70 years old, St. Mark’s launched him in a new direction, notably in his exceptional use of brick. Visiting the site every day except Sunday, he supervised every step of the job. He required the bricklayers to use thick mortar joints and leave them in a rough state, both inside and out. Only whole, uncut bricks were used, laid in stretcher bond. The roof vaults, based on the double-curved profile of a speedboat hull, are also made of brick and were a notable achievement in their wide span. The windows are of insulated glass, fixed without frames to the exterior, with elastic sealants. The electrical wiring runs on the wall surfaces, with fittings of polished brass. The effect is at the same time rough and sophisticated, using the effects that were beginning to be categorized as New Brutalist. This is a version full of Nordic magic and charm, however, including sheepskin covers for the kneelers. (Alan Powers)\n\nIn the Museum of World Culture, in Göteborg, the diversity of world cultures is brought to life through the medium of ever-changing exhibitions and by an avoidance of any permanent displays. Together, the building and the exhibition programs create a versatile and exciting space.\n\nLondon-based architects Cecile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez wanted to emphasize the building’s role as a place where all cultures are welcome and where understanding can be fostered. The six-story museum includes five exhibition halls, a research library, a café, a restaurant, a shop, and offices. Central to the building is a wide timber staircase that serves as the meeting point for all visitors to the museum.\n\nSituated below a hill, the glass-and-concrete structure seems hidden and exposed at the same time; the west-facing facade, where the galleries are situated, appears rather solid and dense, whereas by contrast the facade toward the hill is glazed. A 141-foot-long (43 m) window draws passers-by inside the building, giving them clear views into the largest exhibition hall.\n\nIn one part of the building, which was completed in 2004, a large concrete wall beam, supporting four stories, protrudes 16 feet (5 m) over the footpath below, creating a dramatic and dizzying effect. Working in harmony, these features convey a building that communicates multiplicity and openness, the perfect setting for the museum’s displays of world culture. With a mixture of solid concrete and floating and transparent glass, this building is alive with contrasts, symbolic of a world of similar diversity. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nThe Church at Haparanda, near the Swedish border with Finland, was built to replace the previous wooden church that was built in 1825 and burned down in 1963. The Swedish architect Bengt Larsson designed this remarkable building, and he called it the “clean house” because of its simple, pure features. The church is constructed of two main shapes: a base and an upper unit. The lower part appears compact and flat while the upper section rises up like an oversized, elongated church tower. It looks like a highly exaggerated version of the stacked spires of Swedish wooden churches. This barnlike structure is made up of a steel frame clad in corrugated copper plates forming a large, dark, and somewhat industrial shell. However, two window bands wrap the upper section lengthways, piercing the shell so that light streams into the bright, spacious room below. The interior stands in sharp contrast to the exterior. The room is light and welcoming with large, unpretentious chandeliers of two concentric circles, creating a luminous place. Some visitors interpret the contrast between the dark facade and the bright interior as a journey through the darkness of death toward heavenly light. Purity was the architect’s main theme. His design conveys a sense of aesthetic simplicity in which clear lines predominate throughout the building. Everything seems exceptionally calculated, as if arranged in geometric accordance. For example, by placing the chandeliers in the center of the room, where the open space of the tower begins, and never seems to stop, Larsson has maintained harmony and balance. Here, all the oversized lengths, heights, and widths are preserved and brought down to scale concurrently, creating a wonderfully peaceful atmosphere in a striking piece of modern architecture. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nThe culture of building with snow and ice belongs to the Sami and Inuit people. Today, in Jukkäsjarvi, 124 miles (199 km) north of the Arctic Circle, artists and architects from all over the world adapt this way of building. Inspired by the temporary conditions, permanence of architecture is challenged in an utmost way, forcing the rethinking of working with changing materials.\n\nThe Ice Hotel took its first shape in the autumn of 1989. The hotel consists of approximately 60 rooms, an ice bar, a cinema with a screen of ice, a restaurant, and a church. The main doors are clad with reindeer skin, and, when entering the main lobby, the guest sees a spectacular ice chandelier—the only item from the hotel that is kept and reused every year. The atmosphere inside is calm and quiet, as if sound itself had been frozen. The hotel is built entirely from snow and sculpted blocks of ice, all sprung from the Torne River, which travels about 370 miles (595 km) through Lapland. Due to the fact that the ice and snow melt during the spring, the hotel is rebuilt every autumn when the temperatures once again allow for frozen building materials, creating a hotel season that lasts from December to March. Each autumn, different artists and architects are invited to design all aspects of the hotel making every season a unique experience to returning guests.\n\nThe bedrooms have an average temperature of about minus 45 Fahrenheit (-42 °C) whereas the thermometer may show minus 86 Fahrenheit (-65 °C) outside. The guests sleep in thermal sleeping bags on reindeer skins on a bed of snow and ice. This building is submitted to nature, and the architects only borrow the material that nature takes back every year. When the Ice Hotel is not standing as a solid structure, it flows with the Torne River, accumulating crystal clear life for the following season. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nIn 2001 the church at Kiruna was voted Sweden’s most beautiful building. It is situated in Lapland, in the northeastern part of Sweden. The church was built in 1912 for the people of Kiruna by the LKAB mining company, headed by the geologist Hjalmar Lundbohm, as part of the town’s foundation in 1900. Lundbohm wanted Kiruna to be an ideal town and the church to be its centerpiece. He therefore gathered the finest artists, architects, and town planners of the time, including Prince Eugen, who painted the altarpiece; Christian Eriksson, who designed the cross and the gilt bronze statues standing by the edge of the roof; and the architect Gustaf Wickman. “You must build a church which is like a Lapp hut,” Lundbohm told Wickman. Based on a slim, stone foundation, the exterior slanted walls ascend and merge into the low, steeply pitched roofs. The exterior is constructed of red-painted wood; inside, beams and rafters of dark timber interweave, creating an exciting setting in which rays of light split and meet in the great room below. The architect has placed large windows in the upper section of the main room to bring light into the dark, lower part of the building. In front of the church stands the detached bell tower, which is also constructed from timber posts and red-painted wood. Covered with winter snow, the contrasting dark red and white presents a wonderful, fairy tale-like scene. However, in reality, the iron ore that led to Kiruna’s creation is now proving to be its undoing—the ground on which the town stands is affected by mining-related subsidence, and its buildings are, slowly, being destroyed or relocated. Regardless of its final location, the church at Kiruna will continue to enhance the grandeur of the northern lights and the solemnity of the raw Nordic landscape. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nDark purple bricks, all used uncut, give character to the inside and outside of this last great building of Sigurd Lewerentz in southern Sweden, which he struggled against illness and depression to complete. Like St. Mark’s in Björkhagen, St. Peter’s in Klippan includes a freestanding parish office complex that acts as an entrance space, like a village street. The church, completed in 1966, is entered through a dark, cavelike space, and inside, the ceiling is lower than at St. Mark’s. In a reflection of developing views on liturgy, the congregation sits around three sides of the altar, itself made of brick. Brick vaults are held up on an arrangement of Cor-ten steel beams and a single column, suggestive of a cross; the floor is also of brick, laid not in regular lines but in shapes that echo different areas and their uses. Lewerentz, inspired by a weathered wall at the Helsingborg Steam Brickworks, decided to use misshapen reject bricks, which resulted in irregular mortar joints as a deliberate effect. The windows are even more elementary than those at Björkhagen, simply panes of glass attached to the outside of the building, although they give an effect of fragility compared to the roughness of the masonry. St Peter’s Church has become a cult building among architects fascinated by its combination of modern design and timeless qualities. The details are exceptional, including the giant, natural shell that serves as a font, constantly dripping water into a gap in the brick floor. (Alan Powers)\n\nSweden’s first international housing exhibition was held at Malmö in 2001. The purpose of the exposition was to display “the city of tomorrow in the ecologically sustainable information and welfare society.” As part of the exhibition, architects from the European Union were invited to put forward a residential scheme displaying current trends as well as future ideas on sustainable architecture. The winning designs were erected in the urban district known as the European Village in Malmö, where the Swedish winning contribution, Ekonologia House, was constructed.\n\nEkonologia is a three-story, one-family house of approximately 1,798 square feet (167 sq m). It is built around a light steel frame with large glass facades and terraces. Protruding balconies offer views of the nearby canal. One half of the building appears open and airy; natural sunlight fills the space through the large windows, keeping an efficient level of energy within the house. With its slanted roof, this open section is extended a little further than the other half, which is finished with a flat top, emerging more rigid and closed. Keeping maintenance and energy loss to a minimum, the architects, SWECO FFNS Architects, have created a house for the future that is both financially and environmentally affordable. This combination of the economic and the ecological led to the name of the house. The designers also included an up-to-date information technology system in Ekonologia House to control energy efficiency. The house is an exemplar of green architecture. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\n[Take this quiz to find out how much you’re learning about Sweden’s architectural history.]\n\nAfter the opening of the Øresund Bridge in 2000, the European continent opened its doors to Sweden. Since then there has been a rapid growth in housing construction in and around the city of Malmö, situated in southwest Sweden, and in the neighboring city of Copenhagen. In an area otherwise characterized by low topography, Malmö has a highly contrasting landmark, one that towers above the entire site with endless panoramic views stretching across the Øresund strait. When it was completed, in 2005, Turning Torso was the tallest building in Scandinavia and the second tallest in Europe.\n\nThis remarkable residential and office building is 623 feet (190 m) high. From base to top the structure rotates a total of 90 degrees. The shape of the building was based on one of Santiago Calatrava’s sculptures called Twisting Torso, which was made of nine cubes of white marble and fastened by a spinal column twisting 90 degrees. Today this sculptural project is realized through 54 floors, 147 apartments, and 5 elevators. The Torso is built around a reinforced concrete core, which is designed to give wind resistance—in stormy weather the top of the building moves up to a maximum of 1 foot (0.3 m). The core is further strengthened by an exoskeleton steel truss, which in turn is tied to large foundation slabs.\n\nOwing to its height and the flat landscape of the area, the tower undoubtedly makes a huge impact on passersby, and because of the twisting shell, it also stands as a dynamic and moving monument, just as Calatrava envisioned with his sculpture. Moreover, and as the name implies, the tower also resembles the upper human body in movement. Turning Torso has received international acclaim, and in 2005 it won the Emporis Skyscraper Award. Members of the jury described the design as highly innovative, calling it “the epitome of structural expressionism.” (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nThe Skaparbyn Art Center is located on the Dalälven River close to Gävle on the east coast of Sweden. The center teaches creative courses such as ceramics, painting, weaving, and music. In the 1960s, Swedish artist Birger Forsberg became inspired by Egyptian architect Ramses Wissa Wassef’s theories on children’s innate artistic capabilities. Forsberg’s ideas materialized in a unique and imaginative center, realized by architect Ralph Erskine.\n\nThe complex, which was completed in 2001, consists of seven main buildings that form a semicircle facing east and toward the river. The houses contain workshops, offices, kitchens, sleeping areas, exhibition spaces, and a tower with views over the site and the river. Erskine has created a wonderful site, in complete symbiosis with its surroundings, for artistic inspiration and education. Here is no traffic, noise, nor pollution, but instead nature, fresh air, and serenity. Using wood throughout, Erskine built with the bordering forest as if all the buildings were lairs in the woods. Balconies and verandas appear on all the angular and sharp-edged buildings.\n\nThe communal spaces inside this creative village, such as the dining/meeting place, also promote instant contact and collaboration. Here people assemble in an open room, around a fireplace, and with an open view to the upper floors. There seem to be no limits to this free-flowing mindset. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\nThe 1766 exterior of the Court Theater at Drottningholm Palace, Sweden’s lakeside Versailles, is in an austere Neoclassical style. Built for Queen Louisa Ulrika, the theater replaced an earlier one that burned down in 1762. A number of the rooms were altered in 1791 in the French style, with delicate colors, white, and gold, relief ornament, and a trompe l’oeil painted ceiling. The work was carried out for Queen Louisa’s son, King Gustav III, by his French court architect, Louis Jean Desprez, who also designed some new furniture. Despite its relatively large auditorium, Drottningholm has more the air of a drawing room than a public space. The deep stage allows for the use of painted scenery in the Italian Renaissance tradition, of which Drottningholm has a unique collection from the 18th century. The stage machinery has also survived, including a special mechanism based on a ship’s capstan to remove one set of side wings and bring on another.\n\nWhen Gustav was assassinated in 1792, the theater fell out of use. In 1922 historian Agne Beijer rediscovered it and, recognizing its value, devoted the rest of his life to conserving the fabric of the building. Few 18th-century theaters survive in Europe, and among these, only Drottningholm has such a rich hoard of original scenery. The park contains other decorative buildings, including a fine Chinese pavilion. In 1991 the Royal Domain of Drottningholm was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. (Alan Powers)\n\n[Want to find out more about this history of Sweden? Take this quiz.]\n\nStockholm City Hall stands beautifully on the bank of the Riddarfjärden. Ragnar Östberg’s graceful architecture complements the site perfectly. Two courtyards link offices and ceremonial public spaces beneath the elegant, gently tapering, 348-foot-tall (106 m) tower. The exterior uses dark red, handmade bricks. The picturesque National Romantic southern facade, with its delicate windows, open colonnade, and golden crescent above a minor onion-dome tower, relate handsomely to the shimmering waters. The interior is an architectural hymn to Swedish arts and crafts. The Prince’s Gallery, with its colonnade of 15 pairs of dark marble pillars, is so-called because it has fresco paintings by Prince Eugen of Sweden. The Blue Hall—its excellent brickwork was to be blue-plastered originally—is a covered courtyard, often used as a banqueting hall. The Golden Hall is a magnificent space. Sixteenth-century French Tureholm tapestries adorn the Ovale, which is used for civil weddings. The Council Chamber boasts an imitation open ceiling, reminiscent perhaps of Viking ships’ timbers. Östberg also commissioned Sweden’s finest craftsworkers to decorate and furnish the City Hall, which took 12 years to construct and was eventually completed in 1923. Östberg’s design, using a low, massive, brick-built box with a dominant tower at the corner, was greatly influential outside Sweden; it can be seen reflected even in Art Deco and Modern factories, civic buildings, and metro stations. (Aidan Turner-Bishop)\n\nGunnar Asplund’s architecture has its origins in Classical architecture, in particular the titanic scale of the stripped-back schemes created by the Frenchmen Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. These 19th-century architects forged a Neoclassicism that is best remembered for colossal speculation and schemes that swamped their simple detailing with oversized Classical orders.\n\nConstructed as part of a designated cultural and administrative quarter around Observatoriekullen (Observatory Hill), Asplund’s Stockholm Library is, at its core, a cylinder contained within a box. The “box” is a three-story, U-shaped building, its facade divided horizontally with a monumental entrance, and an ordered run of windows on the upper stories. Above it rises the cylindrical form of the reading room, reached from an internal staircase that ascends toward the rotunda; the approach is articulated so that visitors to the library feel they are ascending into a repository of intellectualism refined into pure geometry. The rings of bookshelves above culminate in a circular roof light. Detailing is minimal, as much a consequence of economic necessity as of Neoclassical purity. Asplund’s architecture is functional, but it presented a confrontational challenge to the functionalist orthodoxy of the Modern movement. (Jonathan Bell)\n\nFrom the start of the 1930s, Modernist architecture flourished in Sweden. The architect Sven Markelius particularly favored a Functionalist style. He became involved in social housing and wanted to create architecture that emancipated women from their household chores. Childcare and cooking would be carried out in common kitchens and childcare centers.\n\nThe Collective House in central Stockholm, completed in 1935, comprises seven floors and sits in a line with neighboring apartment blocks. The yellow-plastered house consists of 57 apartments; some are single-bedroom apartments; others have two or four bedrooms. Due to the open and free planning of the interior, all appear spacious, even the smallest studio. The childcare center and communal kitchen were located on the ground floor, where there was also a public restaurant. If a working woman did not have time to cook, she could order food from the restaurant, to be delivered by means of a small food lift straight into her apartment. Each apartment has its own balcony, which recesses from the exterior walls. With vertical sections of curved balconies next to the solid walls, Markelius created a shifting and also stringent pattern between the opened and the closed. Here is room for privacy but also space to observe what goes on outside. Behind the complex and away from the street is a communal courtyard and garden area.\n\nThe Collective House was the first of its kind in Sweden. Markelius’s social project and design was groundbreaking in its time, and it firmly steered Swedish Modernism and Functionalism toward an international group of Modernist colleagues within Europe. The house was thoroughly restored in 1991 and was designated a protected building. (Signe Mellergaard Larsen)\n\n[Sweden has a rich architectural history, but did you know it also has a long history of inventors and inventions? Take this quiz to find out more.]\n\nThe Woodland Crematorium in Skogskyrkogarden cemetery is not only the swan song of Erik Gunnar Asplund but also a mature illustration of his Modernist architectural idiom. The building is part of a burial complex that includes additional works by Asplund and architect Sigurd Lewerentz. The crematorium sits on a hilly, tree-covered part of Stockholm. A spacious entrance and a large granite cross in the courtyard dominate the site. The complex is formed by three chapels: Faith, Hope, and the larger Chapel of Holy Cross, all linked by the main facilities area—the vault containing the funeral urns and the actual crematorium space. The varied-height volumes break up the facade into separate units, allowing the crematorium subtly to follow the hill’s slope.\n\nThe complex’s serene clarity is also reflected in its furnishings, designed to be comfortable and functional but simple. The site attracts worldwide attention from architects and historians for its elemental Modernist simplicity, in which the basic forms of the building blend harmoniously with the surrounding natural environment—a unique example of authentic monumentality and religious architecture. Asplund’s creation stands peacefully, joining Neoclassical architecture and Modernism, beauty and symbolism. The architect himself was the first person to be cremated there. Completed in 1940, the complex was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1994. (Ellie Stathaki)"
