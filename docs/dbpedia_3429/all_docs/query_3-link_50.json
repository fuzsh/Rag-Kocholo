        "text": "Get to know historic places and modern ways of maintaining and celebrating manorial heritage around the Baltic Sea\n\nManor Houses are testimonies of a memorable transition of regions around the Baltic Sea through the past centuries. They represent manifold cultural & political interrelations, which reflect how the people and countries were connected in the past, despite their very own culture and traditions – and how they still are!\n\nThese days most of these places have turned into destinations for a vacation getaway or into a cultural venue. As a hotel or museum they give us an inspiring distraction from our daily routine. Their historic charm amazes us in a way that it makes us instantly ponder about the wonders and miserys of the past, while they invite us to get a glimpse of a time of another spirit of hard work and decadence and luxury.\n\nThis website informs you about background stories and remarkable occurrences related to the Baltic Manors and the people who lived and shaped their history.\n\nThis website offers you information about our partner regions in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark and Sweden, each of which holds a wide range of historic and cultural uniqueness. Together they shape a rich landscape of manors – waiting for you to explore them. Our stories give you an insight about “spacepioneers” and manorial wonders. We show you places to travel to and routes to take. Travel through nature and off the beaten tracks.\n\nCome and indulge yourself into this charming scenery!\n\nFind cultural offers and cozy hotels\n\nVisit museums, eat good food or celebrate long nights…\n\nWinter and spring are a beautiful time to visit the Baltic Manors. Interesting exhibitions, delicious feasts and long nights by the fireplace are waiting for you. In each region of the Baltic Manor Landscape you will find cultural events to enjoy. Visit the Museum Wejherowo in Northern Kashubia and learn about regional arts and culture and enjoy classical concerts. Visit Christinehof Slott and Svaneholm Slott in South East Sweden and learn about the manorial life in the 1700th century. Get to know the Reventlow family in the Museum Pederstrup in Lolland-Falster. Find your perfect hotel in a historic manor house in Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Denmark or Sweden. Or you may witness the ongoing progress of the restoration at Watercastle Quilow or Castle Broock in Vorpommern."
