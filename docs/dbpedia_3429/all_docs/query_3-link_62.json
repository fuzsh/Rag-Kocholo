        "text": "The Nordic Museum was founded in 1979 to honor the legacy of thousands of Nordic immigrants who came to the Northwest at the turn of the 20th century. The Museum opened to the public in 1980 as the Nordic Heritage Museum leasing space in the historic Webster School in Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. It was the only museum in North America to represent the five Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.\n\n2018 marked a historic milestone when the renamed Nordic Museum opened a brand new purpose-built 57,875 square feet facility in the heart of Ballard on Seattle’s working waterfront. The Museum’s achievements were acknowledged in 2019 when the Museum was designated as the National Nordic Museum by an act of Congress.\n\nIn its iconic building that embodies Nordic design, the institution functions both as a museum and a community gathering place. The National Nordic Museum presents values-based exhibitions and programs that are grounded in Nordic values and invites a diverse audience to celebrate history and culture, providing a forum to expand dialogue that inspires new ways of thinking."
