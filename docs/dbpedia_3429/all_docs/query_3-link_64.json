        "text": "Groups of 10 people or more need to reserve their visit in advance. For specific information ahead of a school group booking, please see our Plan a school visit page.\n\nGuided tours can be booked for groups of ten or more a minimum of one month before the visit, in English, French, Dutch or German, subject to availability.\n\nGuided visits of the permanent or temporary exhibitions are on offer, as well as a thematic guided tour entitled “The Pursuit of Democracy”. This tour is based on the “active participation” method and delves deeper into the concept of democracy in Europe. Expect a tour that stimulates reflection and fosters exchanges between participants about objects and related concepts. A group starts by looking closely at objects presented in the permanent exhibition, introducing and exploring ideas as a group, digging deeper into those ideas and synthesising them for the future.\n\nThe House of European History is a museum for everyone\n\nOur building has undergone extensive renovations to ensure accessibility for wheelchair users, with disabled-friendly toilets (ground floor) and lifts available on all floors. Embracing diversity is a core value of our museum. We are dedicated to reaching out to extraordinary individuals from near and far by offering customized visits and programs designed to overcome barriers. We invite you to share any specific accessibility requests with us via email (historia-learning@europarl.europa.eu) or phone (+32 2 283 1220), and we will make every effort to enhance your experience at our museum."
