        "text": "Discovering Stockholm: Top Attractions in Sweden’s Enchanting Capital\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nWith its undeniable charm, Stockholm will sweep you off your feet and transport you back in time—perhaps to the medieval era? This city is a mix of historical old world and modern Scandinavian design, earning the nicknames “Beauty on the Water” and “Venice of the North”.\n\nThe city of Stockholm is made up of 14 islands framed by Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. A delightful contrast of urban and natural beauty, it is one of the cleanest capitals in the world. This destination is teeming with fascinating architecture and rich history around every corner.\n\nNot sure where to start when visiting Stockholm? Below I will share some of the most famous attractions in addition to our personal recommendations from a recent visit. Visitors will be amazed by Stockholm’s magnificent landscapes, world-class museums, culinary delights, and vibrant city culture.\n\nThose visiting Stockholm, Sweden should prepare to be immersed in a rich tapestry of experiences, reflecting the city’s dynamic ethos!\n\n1. Explore Gamla Stan (Old Town)\n\nGamla Stan, the Old Town, is the heart of Stockholm. It is truly enchanting! From colorful facades lining narrow cobblestone streets, to bustling shops, ancient churches, and rich history—you just might think you’ve ended up in the middle of a real-world fairytale! Visitors can wander through the narrow alleys, explore local stores, admire the medieval architecture, or dine like locals at one of the quaint cafes.\n\nThe area of Gamla Stan is home to historic sites like the Nobel Prize Museum, Storkyrkan, Stortorget Square, Alley of Mårten Trotzig, and Royal Palace. Don’t miss the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace, a tradition dating back to the 16th century.\n\nStorkyrkan (Stockholm’s oldest church) boasts a stunning mix of gothic and baroque architecture. This was one of our favorite stops in Gamla Stan and is pictured first on the left of the gallery below. Dating all the way back to the 13th century, this cathedral inevitably houses some unique historic relics such as the dramatic “Saint George and the Dragon” wooden sculpture by Bernt Notke and a copy of the “Vädersolstavlan”, the oldest known depiction of Stockholm. The entrance fee into Storkyrkan for adults is 85 SEK (~$8 USD); Children under 18 can enter for free. Find the entrance on the southeast side of the building by entering “Slottsbacken 2” in Google Maps.\n\n2. Visit Stortorget: The Oldest Town Square\n\nWhile Stortorget Square is technically nestled in the aforementioned historical Gamla Stan, it merits a specific mention. If you only have a few hours to spend in Stockholm, this is where I recommend visiting! This idyllic square captures the essence of the entire city. Stortorget is the perfect starting point for a memorable exploration when getting to know Stockholm.\n\nThis tiny square is absolutely brimming with charm! The iconic colorful facades line the area that is buzzing with locals and tourists. Take a peek inside the Nobel Prize Museum or dine at the famous Chokladkoppen cafe while you admire the lively atmosphere of Stortorget.\n\n3. Parks, Art, and Museums, Oh My!\n\nMuseum enthusiasts are sure to be impressed by the array of world-class museums in Stockholm, catering to every interest from modern art to maritime heritage.\n\nThe island of Djurgården houses the majority of Stockholm’s museums and popular amusement park, Gröna Lund. This “green lung” of the Swedish capital spreads over 279 hectares (689 acres) and is part of the world’s first national urban park called Ekoparken. A few of the most popular museums on the lush oasis of Djurgården include:\n\nABBA The Museum (Swedish pop band museum)\n\nSkansen (an open-air Swedish history museum and zoo)\n\nVasa Museum (maritime museum)\n\nThe Viking Museum (with interactive Viking exhibits)\n\nA few highly recommended museums that are walkable from Stockholm’s city center are:\n\nFotografiska (photography museum)\n\nStockholm Toy Museum (yes, a toy museum!)\n\nNational Museum (of art and design)\n\nModerna Museet (contemporary art)\n\nA bonus yet temporary recommendation is for The Mystery of Banksy interactive exhibition that is open near the Fotografiska museum until February 4th 2024. Seth is a fan of mysterious Banksy (unknown street graffiti artist) and was super excited to check this out!\n\n4. Watch the Sunset at Skinnarviksberget\n\nSkinnarviksberget is a scenic hilltop offering the most amazing city views of Stockholm! This location is walkable from the city center and is often enjoyed by locals for celebrations or picnics.\n\nBest of all? This is a free activity to do in Stockholm. I strongly recommend catching a sunset here! Pictures don’t capture how amazing it really is. We loved the secluded vibes and panoramic view of the city! Here is the address on Google Maps.\n\n5. Take an Archipelago Cruise\n\nMore than 24,000 islands make up the beautiful Stockholm archipelago. Whether you opt for a ferry ride to the nearby islands or a full-day cruise tour, you’re sure to enjoy breathtaking views and a unique glimpse into the local island culture.\n\nWe saw many boats full of eager visitors during our stroll along the waterways of Stockholm. There are several options for ferry rides to other islands of Stockholm and day cruises to explore the coastline of the archipelago.\n\nRemember to use SL App for public transport in Stockholm. Here is the information about commuter ferries you can travel with an SL ticket on the official website.\n\n6. Indulge in Swedish Cuisine\n\nThis one is for my fellow food lovers. If you have read any of my previous blogs, you know food is a major factor in my travel plans. Stockholm was no exception. Trying local dishes is an excellent way to connect with the culture. Potatoes, meats, seafood, and sweets? I am all in to dine with the Swedes!\n\nMeatballs for the People was a well-rated, nearby restaurant we chose on a whim. We inhaled our entrees! The Swedish meatballs were a standout. The menu offered a variety of different meats, from traditional to more adventurous types. The lingonberry juice (a first for us both) was so tasty that I purchased it online after returning home.\n\nFika could be my favorite Swedish tradition—a coffee and cake break meant to deliberately slow down and savor the present moment. Pickled herring and Renskav (sauteed reindeer) was a little daring for my picky palate, but I can’t recommend the traditional breakfast spreads enough. Our hotel offered an unbelievable free breakfast with an array of fresh and delicious restaurant quality foods!\n\n7. Check Out the Longest Art Exhibit in the World\n\nSince the 1950’s, artists have been commissioned to transform Stockholm’s underground metro station into the longest art exhibit in the world. I honestly was not aware of this prior to arriving. We were blown away! Each stop provides an immersive experience of art and is well worth exploring when visiting Stockholm.\n\nHere are the names and Google Map addresses of the must-see artwork adorned metro stations of Stockholm: Solna Strand, Solna Centrum, Thorildsplan, Tekniska Högskolan, Tensta, Hötorget, Stadion, T-Centralen, Östermalmstorg, Mörby Centrum, Kungsträdgården, Hallonbergen, Citybanan, and Bagarmossen, Rissne.\n\n8. Westfield Mall of Scandinavia\n\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise to many of you that I loved the largest mall in Scandinavia. The Westfield Mall of Scandinavia boasts 224 stores and restaurants. Even with the modern digital maps, I would have been a little nervous to explore here by myself. It was so massive! I do not think a full day would have been enough for me to really peruse every store in this mall.\n\nLocated steps from the metro and train stations, this stop on our itinerary was easy to navigate from our hotel. I loved the Swedish brand stores that are not available in the States. Simply walking around was a cultural experience for us both. This is the perfect activity for a rainy day in Stockholm!\n\n9. View the Northern Lights\n\nAlthough it is more common to catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis in the northern part of Sweden, it is possible on clear nights to experience Northern Light magic in Stockholm!\n\nThose visiting between the months of late August to March should drive outside of the city center when there is a high chance of aurora visibility. Using a light pollution map can help you navigate to an optimal viewing location.\n\nI recommend downloading an aurora forecast app such as My Aurora prior to your travels! We did not seek out the Northern lights during our visit in September, but it is certainly on the never-ending bucket list for us both!\n\n10. Join a Local Walking Tour\n\nLooking to immerse further into local culture? Tourists can enjoy walking tours of the city or Nordic food walks! My favorite edible treats from Sweden were Swedish meatballs and Lingonberry juice as mentioned above. Those two items alone are worth traveling back for in my opinion!\n\nIf you are full from all of the local food sampling, or seeking a nighttime activity, check out this Ghost Walk and Historic Tour of Gamla Stan.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my blog about the beauty of discovering Stockholm, Sweden! I had no expectations prior to our trip. I truly wasn’t prepared to love it as much as I did.\n\nIf you are interested in reading specifics on booking a trip to Europe (especially for multi-country itineraries) while saving money, I’ve got you covered! Check out my planning, booking, and budget tips blog as part of my European travel series. Keep an eye out for my next blog about our time in Bergen and self-booking the most popular Fjord cruise in Norway!\n\n-Amanda Kendler <3"
