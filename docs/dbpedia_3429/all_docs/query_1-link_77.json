        "text": "The young queen of Sweden, Hedvig Eleonora – whose beauty had enticed the king to marry her – needed a jaw-dropping palace.\n\nDrottningholm Palace, to be exact…\n\nAnd – after you’ve explored Gamla Stan (Stockholm’s Old Town) – visiting this Swedish royal palace today is one of the best day trips from Stockholm!\n\nWhere is Drottningholm Palace located?\n\nThe palace is built on the island of Lovon in Lake Malaren, in a suburb of Stockholm called Drottningholm.\n\nSee this link to Google maps for the Drottningholm Palace location.\n\nDrottningholm Palace history\n\nNow let’s step back in time and learn a little about the history of Drottningholm Palace and how it came to be…\n\nHedvig Eleonora\n\nHedvig Eleonora’s husband, the king, had recently died, and she would rule as regent of the country until their young son was old enough to become the next king.\n\nSweden was one of the most powerful states in Europe, and the palace she would commission had to dazzle visiting royalty and dignitaries with its grandeur.\n\nAnd so, in 1662, Drottningholm Palace (Drottningholm slott in Swedish) was built in grand Baroque style.\n\nAs it turned out, Hedvig Eleonora ended up reigning for much of her life.\n\nEven when her son assumed power, he still deferred to her and called her “the Queen.”\n\nLater, when her grandson left to fight the Great Northern War between Russia and the Swedish empire, she assumed control of Sweden once again.\n\nHedwig Eleonora’s bedchamber\n\nShe used it for official purposes, to greet visitors.\n\nNo doubt she succeeded in impressing many prominent guests here during her long reign!\n\nLouisa Ulrika’s artistic influence\n\nAfter Eleonora’s passing, the palace remained the residence for the royal ladies.\n\nThen in 1744, it was given as a wedding present to Princess Louisa Ulrika of Prussia when she married the Swedish crown prince.\n\nA lover of the arts, Louisa thrust Drottningholm into its golden age, redecorating the interiors in the latest French Rococo style on display at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nLouisa also added a splendid library.\n\nDripping with crystal chandeliers, the gilt-adorned library simply oozes luxury.\n\nA friend of Voltaire, Louisa loved to read – she founded Sweden’s Academy of Letters (which promotes the study of humanities and social sciences).\n\nWhat must it have been like to pick up one of her precious history or botany books, and read in that room?\n\nThe lovely kina slott\n\nOn her 33rd birthday, Louisa received a surprise gift from her husband – a “Chinese pleasure palace.”\n\nIn a letter to her mother, she wrote of her delight: “He led me to one side of the garden and suddenly to my surprise, I found myself gazing upon a real fairytale creation, for the King had built a Chinese palace, the loveliest imaginable.”\n\nChinoiserie was in fashion at the time.\n\nThis pretty pink Chinese Pavilion (Kina slott in Swedish) displays the exquisite Chinese porcelain statues, lacquered panels, china and vases that so fascinated Louisa and her friends.\n\nIndeed, as we wandered through the red, green and yellow rooms, we easily imagined them reading, laughing, gossiping and having fun as they played cards here.\n\nConfidence dining room\n\nThe “confidence” dining room, in a separate building beside the Chinese palace, is also intriguing.\n\nIts dining table could be lowered underground, so servants could set the meal on it then raise it back up into the dining room.\n\nThis way, the royals could eat in private without servants overhearing their conversations.\n\nThe room is the sparest in the palace.\n\nNature reigns supreme here.\n\nLouisa must have found pleasure enough in the leafy views through the glass windows encircling the one-room building and in the secrets shared here.\n\nWhere Swedish royalty still live\n\nDrottningholm is Swedish for “Queen’s Island.”\n\nIt’s a tribute to the vision and creativity of Eleonora and Louisa – both beautiful, strong-willed, intelligent women – that the golden-hued yellow palace today is one of the finest and best-preserved palaces in Northern Europe, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nDrottninholm is also still full of life.\n\nThe current Swedish king and queen make their home here.\n\nStockholm day trip to the “Queen’s Island”\n\nA large part of the palace is open to the public, however.\n\nAnd this Stockholm day trip – taking a century-old steamer across Lake Malaren to visit the “Queen’s Island” – is one of the best things to do in Stockholm!\n\nTips for visiting Drottningholm Palace\n\nDrottningholm Palace tour\n\nWe recommend allowing three to four hours to explore Drottningholm Palace and gardens.\n\nSign up at the palace for a 45-minute guided tour, offered at 10:00 am, 12 noon, 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm from June to September (limited tours the rest of the year).\n\nKarmellan Café and Restaurant\n\nThere’s a lovely café in an historic building, the 1880 Karmellan Café and Restaurant, on the palace grounds – so you can have a snack or lunch at Drottningholm.\n\nMore information\n\nThe palace website has detailed information on Sweden’s Drottningholm Palace.\n\nBoat to Drottningholm Palace\n\nYou can drive to Drottningholm Palace, but the most fun way to get there is by boat.\n\nMore Stockholm information\n\nSee the Stockholm travel guides available on Amazon.\n\n(As an Amazon associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.)"
