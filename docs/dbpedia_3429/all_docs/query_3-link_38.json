Skansen is the world’s oldest open-air museum and was founded in 1891 by the linguist, teacher and public educator Artur Hazelius. Here you can experience everything from music, dance and traditions to old historical environments and Nordic animals. Skansen features historical environments and buildings from all over the country. Check out our bookable viewings and go on a guided tour to find out what it was like to live in Sweden in the old days!\n\nExperience Nordic wildlife, rare breeds, pets and exotic creatures. Newly open is the big Baltic Sea Science Center, where you can experience the life beneath the surface. The Children’s Zoo features domestic animals such as cats, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as small wild animals.\n\nThe Skansen Aquarium and Our Africa feature exotic animals including monkeys, birds, reptiles and insects. The park area surrounding the museum has a variety of planting and gardens.
