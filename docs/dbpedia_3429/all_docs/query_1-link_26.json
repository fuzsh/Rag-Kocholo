Visitors step back in time and learn about the settling of the western high plains, a time when grand houses, growing businesses, extensive prairies and agriculture were all a part of daily life.\n\nOpened during the nation’s bicentennial in 1976, Centennial Village Museum preserves and interprets American western heritage in the Colorado high plains region. Some of Weld County’s oldest structures are located in this museum.\n\nCentennial Village boasts several annual special events.

It involved a wooden hoop (sometimes beribboned) with two pairs of wooden dowel rods. One child would pull apart the rods, which propels the hoop into the air, to be caught by another player with their rods. Kids in Greeley can give it a try themselves at Centennial Village Museum August 9 and 10 during Pets 'n' Popsicles, when it's one of several games (no batteries or charging required!) they can try out. There are also crafts, the village's resident farm animals, wagon rides on Saturday (weather permitting), and a free popsicle with each ticket.
