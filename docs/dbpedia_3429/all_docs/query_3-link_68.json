        "text": "In 2004 two well-known economists of culture, Michele Trimarchi and Pierluigi Sacco, presented an essay entitled “'The Invisible Museum”' . Today the situation in Italy has been completely revolutionized. Museums are no longer offices and they are literally stormed by visitors. In 2015, with the appointment of the first directors of autonomous museums, the media system in the summer was more interested in museum directors than in footballers and their summer flirts. The average growth rate of museum participation is 7.3%, while the growth rate of tourism is around 4%. Never before have we experienced such a manifestation of people's trust towards museums. This reform has operated top down, because any other approach is unconceivable in Italy . The reform of museums implemented with the 2014 legislation, has achieved what outstanding parliamentary study commissions and ICOM International have recommended since 1960: to recognize the status of institution to Italian state museums. With a clear identification of fundamental responsibilities: a museum director is the custodian and interpreter of the museum's identity and mission, in compliance with the Ministry's guidelines. A director is responsible for the cultural and scientific project. Autonomous museums were finally established in 2015 with a director in charge, a budget, a governing body that can finally have accountability, a social recount of how they spend and how their spending can affect the development of society.\n\naThe topic discussed in the paper is the change and evolution the concept of museum (Greek: museion, Latin: musaeum) has been undergoing for over 2500 years, as well as many of its different meanings: from the definition of a spot in space, including a place of worship, up to the name of learning form, research and knowledge centre, collection of texts and poetry, music and theatre festival, synonyms of a dictionary and encyclopaedia, library and a secluded study spot, up to large institutions co-creating culture and educating socially. Once museums had become social institutions, the process of defining their organizational form and their mission limits began. The International Council of Museums (ICOM), as an organization grouping museum employees and museologists, namely both practitioners and theoreticians, ever since its establishment in 1946 has on a number of occasions initiated works on a shared definition of museum. The paper assembles all the ICOM-proposed definitions in 1946–2007 presented both in English and Polish. The latest proposal submitted at the Kyoto ICOM General Conference on 7 September 2019 (Annex 1), however, for the first time aroused a heated debate and was not finally voted on by the ICOM General Assembly; instead, the debate has continued on the proposed phrasing since. The historical overview of the museum concept and the history of the ICOM museum definition presented against the opinions of invited Polish museum professionals is the ‘record of time’, documenting the considerations on the role and tasks of museum in contemporary society."
