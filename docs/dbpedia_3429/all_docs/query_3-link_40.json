A wall of light 20â€™ in height and aided by artificial intelligence, the installation evokes the Aurora Borealis as its undulations mimic the unpredictability of the natural phenomenon. The work was created in collaboration with technologist Ed Fries and scholar Wanda Gregory.\n\nStop in during our extended hours on Thursdays to see Project Aurora after dark!\n\nOur core exhibit explores Nordic history and culture over the last twelve thousand years. With items from our collection and on loan from the National Museums of all five Nordic countries, you're bound to learn something new on each visit."
