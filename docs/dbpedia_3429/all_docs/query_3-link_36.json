        "text": "Pelham Bay Park is the bucolic setting of a country house, built in 1836, with one of the nation’s finest Greek Revival interiors.\n\nPoe, one of America’s greatest writers, spent his last years in this modest cottage, built in 1812.\n\nThis farmhouse, built in 1758, once stood along the famous Boston Post Road and is now home to a museum of Bronx history.\n\nOccupied by British and Colonial troops during the Revolutionary War, this Georgian home, built in 1748, is the centerpiece of a 1,000-acre park.\n\nOwned by the same family for over 200 years, this home displays layers of history dating back to the Dutch-American period. Originally built in 1720 and expanded in 1800.\n\nBuilt ca. 1783, this farmhouse is one of the few structures surviving from Brooklyn’s Village of Flatbush.\n\nOriginally built in 1699, and reconstructed from some original stones in 1933, this house is a landmark of military history and a center of the vibrant Park Slope community.\n\nDating to ca. 1652, this Dutch farmhouse is the oldest existing structure in New York State.\n\nPerched above Broadway, Manhattan’s last farmhouse, built ca. 1784, is an extraordinary vestige of the borough’s agricultural past.\n\nBuilt in 1799, this former country estate on the East River now serves as the official residence of the Mayor of New York City.\n\nManhattan’s only remaining lighthouse sits beneath the George Washington Bridge and stars in a famous children’s book. Originally built in 1880 and moved to its present site in 1921.\n\nThis elegant red brick and white marble row house is a lone survivor of Old New York, the only family home preserved intact, inside and out, from the 19th century.\n\nA witness to an eventful past, this mansion, built in 1765, served as Washington’s headquarters during the Battle of Harlem Heights.\n\nThis charming Swedish schoolhouse, built for Philadelphia’s 1876 Centennial Exposition, is now home to a renowned marionette theater company.\n\nBuilt ca. 1661, the house is a landmark of religious freedom and a microcosm of social, cultural, and political history.\n\nHome of Founding Father Rufus King, framer of the Constitution and early voice in the anti-slavery movement. The oldest section of the house dates from ca. 1730.\n\nThis typical 18th-century farmhouse, built ca. 1785, serves as the headquarters of the Queens Historical Society.\n\nThis Queen Anne-style residence, built in 1887-89, was home to African-American inventor and electrical pioneer Lewis Howard Latimer from 1903 to 1928.\n\nAbundant crops and farm animals still thrive at the longest continually farmed site in New York State. The oldest structure on site dates from ca. 1772."
