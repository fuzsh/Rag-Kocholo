        "text": "Reduced admission price\n\nThe exhibition So Danish! is closed due to water damage. Therefore, we are currently offering a reduced admission price. You can still experience the exhibitions Aware – Architecture and Senses, Teenage Dreams and a mini version of So Danish! or join a free guided tour of the exhibitions to learn about the architecture in BLOX. You can also enjoy the city’s best view of the harbor and the historic city center from the large terraces of our rooftop café.\n\nCapture Your City – New Beauty\n\nJune 6 – October 1, 2024\n\nCapture Your City is a photo competition and exhibition where participants interpret the city with their camera, just as it looks right now. This year, we invite everyone to capture a new and more sustainable beauty.\n\nRead more about Capture Your City\n\nNote! This is an outdoor photo exhibition\n\nTeenage Dreams\n\nJune 12, 2024 – January 5, 2025\n\nThe exhibition Teenage Dreams offers a glimpse into the future of teenage bedrooms. Designing for teenagers means designing for a generation whose values will shape our future. Experience three installations by talented young Danish designers. These installations offer insights into how contemporary challenges impact and alter teenagers’ needs and desires for their personal spaces.\n\nRead more about Teenage Dreams\n\nAre you visiting Copenhagen this summer? Come and learn about architecture and design. We offer lots of fun for the entire family.\n\nDanish Architecture Center invites you to join us for exciting architectural experiences. Feel how architecture can influence our senses in the exhibition, Aware. And if you’re bringing kids along, visit our weekend workshop Mirror Magic, where you can challenge your senses, make beautiful kaleidoscopes and other fun activities with mirrors.\n\nArticle\n\nIn the Palm of Architecture’s Hand: How City Design Shapes Your Life\n\nThe power of architecture is subtle but profound. Architects shape not only our cities but also our behavior. Architecture is everywhere, and we cannot help but react instinctively to what we experience. Meet two experts in behavioral design and discover how architectural design, from benches to buildings, affects your life.\n\nThe City Map\n\nStart your exploration of Copenhagen’s architecture on the floor just beneath BLOX. Here, you can walk around on a gigantic aerial photo of the city and get a complete overview. At the same time, it gives you the feeling of being a giant, stomping around – high above the city.\n\nExplore the map\n\nH.M. The King Frederik X becomes the patron of Danish Architecture Center\n\nWe are proud to announce that His Majesty The King has become the patron of Danish Architecture Center. DAC’s CEO Kent Martinussen and director Dorthe Weinkouff Barsøe state:\n\n»We are very excited about The King’s patronage of DAC, which we are confident will encourage even more Danes to take an interest in the physical frameworks that support our shared quality of life in Denmark.«\n\nIn 2023, DAC welcomed 285,000 visitors. With H.M. The King’s support, we look forward to continuing our efforts to promote dialogue about architecture and sustainable urban development.\n\nRead more"
