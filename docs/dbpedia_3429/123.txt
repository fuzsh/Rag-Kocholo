A Jewel of Chinoiserie at Drottningholm Palace

The Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm Palace is a historic gem located in Drottningholm, Sweden, within the expansive Drottningholm Palace Park.

Commissioned by King Adolf Frederick and Queen Lovisa Ulrika in the mid-18th century, this architectural marvel was designed by the renowned Swedish architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz.

Discover the Unique Chinoiserie Architecture

The Chinese Pavilion exemplifies chinoiserie architecture, blending the French Rococo style with exotic Chinese and Oriental elements that were highly fashionable during that era. The exterior boasts intricate wooden carvings and vibrant colors reminiscent of traditional Chinese temples and pagodas.

Step inside, and opulently decorated interiors will greet you with lacquered furniture, silk wallpapers, and hand-painted murals depicting idyllic Chinese landscapes.

Experience the Historic Confidensen

Just a short stroll north of the Pavilion, you’ll find the Confidensen, a unique dining building. Here, servants would set dining tables and serving tables on the floor below the royal dining room. The food and tables would be hoisted up only when someone above gave a signal, allowing the royals to dine in privacy without servants present. Consequently, this innovative dining arrangement is the origin of the term “confidence” (from the French word for “in confidence”). Today, this historic venue operates as a charming summer café.

Stunning Surroundings

Located within the picturesque grounds of Drottningholm Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Chinese Pavilion offers visitors the chance to explore beautifully landscaped gardens, tranquil lakeside views, and other historic buildings such as the Drottningholm Court Theatre. The surrounding Drottningholm Palace Park is a haven of natural beauty, perfect for a leisurely stroll or a peaceful picnic.

A Venue Rich in History

Throughout its storied history, the Chinese Pavilion has hosted numerous diplomatic events, cultural exchanges, and entertainment for royalty and distinguished guests. Today, it stands as a testament to Sweden’s historic ties with Eastern cultures. It is open to the public as part of the Drottningholm Palace complex. Visitors can marvel at its exquisite architecture and delve into its fascinating past. In essence, they can experience a piece of history that once served as a venue for the elite.
