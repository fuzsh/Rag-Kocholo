He was best known for playing Rhett Butler in the 1939 movie version of Gone with the Wind.\n\nLife[change | change source]\n\nGable was born on February 1, 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio.[1] He was married five times. He had two children. The last movie that Gable starred in was The Misfits, in 1961. This movie also starred Marilyn Monroe and was written by Arthur Miller. Gable died shortly afterwards in Los Angeles, California, after having had a fourth coronary thrombosis.\n\nAwards[change | change source]\n\nGable was nominated for an Academy Award for playing Fletcher Christian in the 1935 movie version of Mutiny on the Bounty. A year before in 1934, he starred in It Happened One Night with Claudette Colbert. Their performances won them both an Academy Award (the only wins in their careers).\n\nReferences[change | change source]\n\nOther websites[change | change source]"
