        "text": "Listen to this episode on Apple Podcasts.\n\nAfter struggling to find her niche in Hollywood, Carole Lombard came into her own in the mid-1930s first as the queen of screwball comedy, and then as romantic partner to the star dubbed The King of Hollywood, Clark Gable. When the US entered World War II, to the chagrin of her stoic husband, Lombard immediately volunteered their services to FDR, and the actress ended up spearheading the first of many Hollywood whistle stop tours to sell bar bonds. Hurrying back from that tour, Lombard died in an awful plane crash, leaving a guilt- and grief-ridden Gable behind. In the traumatic aftermath of his beloved wife’s death, Gable — the epitome of Hollywood's idea of unimpeachable masculinity -- had a physical and emotional breakdown. In his despair, the 41 year-old Gable had strings pulled so that he could join the army to fight against Hitler -- a huge Gable fan who reportedly became desperate to capture the actor while he was flying combat missions over Germany.\n\nBibliography:\n\nMy main sources for this episode were Robert Matzen’s book on Lombard’s life and the investigation into her death, Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3; Garson Kanin’s memoir Hollywood, which includes a wonderful chapter on Lombard; City of Nets by Otto Friedrich; and the Gable biography Long Live the King by Lyn Tornabene. I was not able to find copies of two books by Warren Harris, Gable and Lombard and Clark Gable: A Biography (and actually, at the Hollywood branch of the LA Public Library, the librarian told me both had been stolen). And I didn’t realize until after I finished the episode that there was a biopic about the pair made in 1976, starring James Brolin and Jill Clayburgh. You can watch it on Amazon Instant Video; I can’t tell you whether or not you should.\n\nThis episode includes an audio clip from Nothing Sacred (1937), directed by William Wellman.\n\nDiscography:\n\nPreludes for Piano No. 1 by George Gershwin\n\nLittle Room by The White Stripes\n\nAll of My Tears by Spirituaized\n\nMotoroller Scalatron by Stereolab\n\nFaster Does It by Kevin MacLeod\n\nGagool by Kevin MacLeod\n\nOut of the Skies, Under the Earth by Chris Zabriskie\n\nPrelude No. 21 by Chris Zabriskie\n\nOff to Osaka by Kevin MacLeod\n\nDances and Dames by Kevin MacLeod\n\nTransparent by Peter Rudenko\n\nMost At Home in Motels by Joan of Arc\n\nRock My Boat (Roger O’Donnell mix) by DNTEL\n\nRock My Boat by DNTEL\n\nCylinder One by Chris Zabriskie\n\nGymnopedie No. 3 by Eric Satie, performed by Kevin MacLeod\n\nFor Better or Worse by Kai Engel\n\nI’d Die Without You by PM Dawn"
