        "text": "(1901–60). For three decades U.S. film actor Clark Gable was one of Hollywood’s leading male stars. He rose to fame with his creation of a rough, masterful, romantic hero—a role epitomized in his portrayal of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nWilliam Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901, in Cadiz, Ohio. The only son of an itinerant oil-field worker, Gable worked at a variety of odd jobs as a youth and then joined the Ed Lilly stock company as a callboy. Coached by his first wife, Josephine Dillon, a former actress, he played his first Broadway lead in Machinal (1928).\n\nGable had played bit parts in silent films as early as 1924. With the introduction of sound films, he returned to Hollywood in 1930 and was successful in a series of gangster roles that included The Finger Points (1931) and Night Nurse (1931). Under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios from 1931 to 1954, he switched gradually to the light-hearted, adventurous parts for which he became famous. During the 1930s, in such pictures as Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937), two of several films made with actress Jean Harlow, and Boom Town (1940) and San Francisco (1936), in which he costarred with the prominent actor Spencer Tracy, Gable became the American ideal of virility. He won an Academy Award for his performance in It Happened One Night (1934) and was nominated for similar awards for his work in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) and Gone with the Wind."
