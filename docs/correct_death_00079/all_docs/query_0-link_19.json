        "text": "The former estate of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in the Old Las Palmas area of Palm Springs, California, is for sale at $2.2 million.\n\nThe seller is film producer Joel Douglas, the brother of actor Michael Douglas and the son of actor Kirk Douglas.\n\nBuilt in 1925, the gated Spanish Colonial sits on more than half an acre of grounds with a tree-lined circular drive, a pool house and swimming pool, and a detached guest house and garage. Mature trees and grass complete the grounds.\n\nPeriod details include colorful tile accents, decorative wrought-iron work and vaulted beamed ceilings. The restored pink-stucco house has family room and living room fireplaces, a den/office, four bedrooms and six bathrooms in 3,301 square feet of living space.\n\nThe property is offered furnished and includes a pool table custom-made for Kirk Douglas, who will turn 98 in December.\n\nGable, who died in 1960 at 59, was known for his leading-man roles, including Rhett Butler in \"Gone With the Wind\" (1939). Comic actress Lombard, who died in a 1942 plane crash at 33, appeared with Gable in \"No Man of Her Own\" (1932).\n\nJoel Douglas has worked on such films as \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975), \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984) and \"It Runs in the Family\" (2003), which starred his father and brother.\n\nThe property last changed hands in 2003 for $965,000.\n\nBEAMING OUT\n\nOF LOS FELIZ?\n\nIt's not quite warp speed, but Zachary Quinto, who portrayed Spock in the recent \"Star Trek\" films, put a home in Los Feliz, California, up for sale at $1.17 million and in less than two weeks a deal was pending.\n\nThe funky loft-like pad has Midcentury Modern roots and dates to 1948. Open-plan space encompasses the living room, dining area and kitchen of the 1,500-square-foot home, which has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. There's also a den.\n\nOutdoor space includes a patio with a fire pit off the master bedroom, which has clerestory windows and concrete floors.\n\nQuinto, 37, is known for the 2009 and 2013 \"Star Trek\" movies and for his work on the series \"Heroes\" (2006-10) and \"American Horror Story\" (2011-13). He is in the 2014 films \"He'll Never Have Paris\" and \"The Girl Who Invented Kissing.\"\n\nHe bought the property in 2008 for $865,000, property records show.\n\nHER DEAL IN HANCOCK PARK\n\nKate Mara of \"House of Cards\" fame would like to deal. She's listed her condo in Hancock Park, Los Angeles, for $649,000.\n\nThe Italian Revival-style building was constructed in 1928 and features a courtyard with a fountain. The building includes a gym and gated parking.\n\nMara's renovated corner unit of more than 900 square feet has two bedrooms and one bathroom. Views take in the cityscape and mountains.\n\nMara, 31, was in \"American Horror Story\" in 2011, \"Entourage\" (2009) and \"24\" (2006). She is in the 2014 films \"Transcendence\" and \"Captive.\"\n\nThe actress bought the pied-a-terre in 2005 for $620,000.\n\nHOPING A BUYER\n\nWILL ZOOM IN\n\nAcademy Award-winning cinematographer Wally Pfister has listed his compound in Hollywood Hills West, California, for sale at $4,695,000.\n\nSet behind gates, the three-quarter-acre property centers on a five-bedroom, six-bathroom main house with high ceilings and art display space. A guest apartment with a kitchen sits above the garage. In addition to the nearly 5,000 square feet of interior space, there's an outdoor living room/pavilion with a fireplace. Steps lead down to a swimming pool with a spa outside of the great room and a screening room.\n\nPfister, 53, won his Oscar for \"Inception\" (2010) and is known for his work on the \"Dark Knight\" films. This year he directed the movie \"Transcendence.\"\n\nThe property last changed hands in 2006 for $2.28 million, public records show."
