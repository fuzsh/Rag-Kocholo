        "text": "Actors\n\nWilliam Clark Gable (February 1, 1901 – November 16, 1960) was an American film actor, often referred to as “The King of Hollywood.” He had roles in more than 60 motion pictures in a wide variety of genres in a career that lasted 37 years, three decades of which was as a leading man. Gable died of a heart attack; his final on screen appearance was of an aging cowboy in John Huston‘s The Misfits (co-starring Marilyn Monroe, in her last complete role), released posthumously in 1961.\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, Gable traveled to Hollywood where he began his film career as an extra in Hollywood silent films between 1924 and 1926. He progressed to supporting roles for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and his first leading role in 1931’s Dance, Fools, Dance was alongside Joan Crawford, who requested him for the part. His next role, in the romantic drama Red Dust (1932) with reigning sex symbol Jean Harlow, made him MGM’s biggest male star. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Frank Capra‘s It Happened One Night (1934), co-starring Claudette Colbert; which first film to win the Big 5 Academy Awards (Picture, Director, Writer, Actor, and Actress), followed by Miloš Forman‘s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), with Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher; and Jonathan Demme‘s The Silence of the Lambs (1990), with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins\n\nHe was nominated for the same award for his roles in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), and in Victor Fleming‘s Gone with the Wind (1939) opposite Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel. He found continued commercial and critical success with Manhattan Melodrama (1934), San Francisco (1936), Saratoga (1937), Test Pilot (1938), and Boom Town (1940), three of which co-starred Spencer Tracy. He appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of their time. Joan Crawford was a favorite actress of his to work with, and he partnered with her in eight films. Myrna Loy worked with him seven times, and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions. He also starred with Lana Turner in four features and in three each with Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner.\n\nGable spent two years as an aerial cameraman and bomber gunner in Europe during World War II. Although his movies following his return were not critically lauded, they did well at the box office. He experienced a critical revival with The Hucksters (1947), Homecoming (1948) and John Ford‘s Mogambo (1953), which also featured newcomer Grace Kelly. Later he starred in westerns and war movies, such as Run Silent, Run Deep (1958) with Burt Lancaster, and in comedies that paired him with a new generation of leading ladies such as Doris Day in Teacher’s Pet (1958), Sophia Loren in It Started in Naples (1960) and Marilyn Monroe in The Misfits (1961).\n\nGable was one of the most consistent box-office performers in history, appearing on Quigley Publishing’s annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll 16 times. He was named the seventh-greatest male star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.
