        "text": "Visiting author chronicles Carole Lombard's last days\n\nJ. Dwight Peterson, surely Indiana's greatest bond salesman of the 20th century, in 1942 engineered a sale of government war bonds, a one-day event that netted $2 million, a staggering sum then.\n\nHis patriotic, fundraising rally, held barely a month after Pearl Harbor, would be the first of thousands of such rallies held around the country to sell bonds to raise money for the war effort. (By the time the war ended, Americans had invested nearly $200 billion in war bonds.)\n\nThe key to Peterson's success was Carole Lombard, the Fort Wayne-born movie star. She'd traveled to Indianapolis from Hollywood to glam up the rally. She charmed the city, looked like a million bucks and was funny; her movies were comedies.\n\nPeterson spent just one day with Lombard, but it was a long day, \"almost 12 straight hours of activities,\" said Robert Matzen, who has just published a book about the actress' final hours.\n\nThere was tea at the governor's, a speech at the Statehouse, a ribbon-cutting at a new army recruiting office, dinner with local notables at the Claypool Hotel, and finally, the rally.\n\nIt was held at the Cadle Tabernacle Downtown, which was Indianapolis' 1940s version of a convention center. It was packed. \"People were all over the place, standing in the aisles,\" Peterson recalled in a 1987 interview with The Star. \"The crowd just loved her.\"\n\nA half-century later, Peterson used the following adjectives to describe Lombard: wonderful, sincere, friendly, down-to-earth, remarkable.\n\nIt was late when Peterson took Lombard and her entourage to the airport. Her initial plan had been to return to California by train. But she was in a hurry, Matzen says in \"Fireball,\" anxious over reports that her husband, Clark Gable, 40, was fooling around with Lana Turner, 21.\n\nLombard, 33, was traveling with her mother and a publicist. Both of them were scared of flying and agreed to board the plane only after losing a coin toss to Lombard.\n\nPeterson was on the side of Lombard's mother and the publicist. \"I begged her not to go so late at night — to wait and catch a daytime flight,\" he said in 1987.\n\n\"You have to realize, air travel back then was not what it is now. Our airport was little more than a landing strip with some shacks on it. I thought she was being foolhardy, and I told her so.\"\n\n\"J. Dwight himself hated flying, especially at night,\" said his grandson, who has the same name as his grandfather (but goes by Pete) and works at the same investment firm, City Securities Corp., in which the Petersons now have a controlling interest.\n\nLombard's plane took off cleanly but hours later crashed into the side of a mountain outside Las Vegas. All aboard were killed.\n\nIndianapolis, which hours earlier had cheered the actress wildly, was poleaxed. J. Dwight Peterson came home from the office that day, \"and, I remember years later my dad telling me, he looked just crushed.\"\n\nPeterson went on to become a major player in Indianapolis' business and civic life. He died in 1990 at age 93.\n\nMatzen's book, \"Fireball: Carole Lombard & the Mystery of Flight 3\" (GoodKnight Books), which does not mention J. Dwight Peterson, came out in January. Matzen will appear at Indy Reads Books, 911 Massachusetts Ave., from 3:30 to 5 p.m. March 30 to discuss his research about Lombard's death, show a video and sign books.\n\nQuestion: You note in your book that debris from the 1942 crash is still scattered around the site. How could it have survived the weather and souvenir hunters for 72 years?\n\nAnswer: The crash site at 7,700 feet on Potosi Mountain, Nevada, is inaccessible. It's on a sheer mountainside on federal land and you take your life in your hands going there. My guide to the crash site had a button on his jacket to dispatch a rescue helicopter — that's how rugged the country is. The largest pieces of aluminum fuselage were salvaged in the 1940s, but the collision of 13 tons of just-fueled-up airplane traveling at almost 190 miles per hour with a granite cliff was catastrophic, and the plane exploded into literally a million pieces that landed in a wide radius on a 45-degree slope. What remains today are the heaviest pieces, those that a relic hunter can't lug out. Primary among them are the two engines and the two landing gear. Then there are the smallest pieces — several hundred thousand bits of airplane and contents. You'll see bits of TWA dishes, windshield glass, buttons from clothing, luggage fasteners and lots and lots of pieces of aluminum. There are some steel supports and wires that are rusting, but the remaining pieces of fuselage up there are mostly aluminum, which doesn't deteriorate. It's as shiny now as it was in 1942, in sections up to six or eight feet long.\n\nQ: Do you know anything about Carole Lombard supposedly visiting a psychic while in Indianapolis prior to getting on the plane? Local lore says she visited Nellie Simmons Meier, a rather famous psychic who worked out of her house at 3128 N. Pennsylvania St., and that Meier urged Lombard not to fly that night.\n\nA: I know nothing about this. It's possible but unlikely. The party of three returned to the Claypool from Cadle Tabernacle, packed a great deal of luggage, and were at the airport by 1 or 1:30 A.M. In theory there was time to make a stop, but to me this seems like a story retrofitted to the circumstances.\n\nQ: You've also written a book about Errol Flynn. Are people still interested in movie stars of so long ago?\n\nA: If you write a book about Errol Flynn these days, you're writing for a niche or micro-niche; that group of people who are either over 60 and remember the name and mystique of Errol Flynn or those who are younger and watch TCM. My greatest concern in writing a book about Carole Lombard in 2012 and 2013 was that it had been too long since her death and there was no market remaining for \"Fireball.\" I have been shocked by the resonance her name continues to have.\n\nLombard is synonymous with Hollywood glamour, and continues to be appreciated as a ground-breaking screen comedienne. But more than anything else, the connection with king-of-the-movies Clark Gable and the mystique of their relationship is what the general public finds interesting, even 72 years later.\n\nQ: Seventy years from now, will our grandchildren be interested in, say, Amy Winehouse?\n\nA: Yes, I think Amy Winehouse will be the James Dean of 2084. She will have a cult following because she was a brilliant artist troubled by inner demons who died way too young. This combination of ingredients will give her mystique and make her alluring to young people trying to sort out their own lives, ambitions and inner demons. Lombard was a different sort of animal. Yes, she died young, but she wasn't troubled and didn't kill herself. Well, in a sense she did, but in a completely different, less-obvious way.\n\nQ: What was the reason given for the crash?\n\nA: The crash was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board and a U.S. House subcommittee. No official cause was ever found. As is usually the case in such a situation, the default was \"pilot error,\" and the crash was listed as likely pilot error.\n\nContact Star reporter Will Higgins at (317) 444-6043.
