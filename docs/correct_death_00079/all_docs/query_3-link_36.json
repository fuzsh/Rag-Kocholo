        "text": "In May 1950, movie star Clark Gable found himself sitting in the seat of the Mike Brannon Special in the Indianapolis 500 after actress Barbara Stanwyck had given him a kiss for good luck. Hollywood had come to the Speedway, and the Indianapolis 500 was the leading lady.\n\nGable played Brannon, a ruthless midget car racer whose recklessness caused the death of a fellow driver. Stanwyck played journalist Regina Forbes who wanted Brannon banned from racing.\n\nOut of racing, Brannon becomes a driver for Joie Chitwood’s stunt show but manages to get back into racing, drive in the Indy 500 and in typical Hollywood fashion become romantically involved with the woman who crusaded to have him blacklisted.\n\nGable arrived in Indianapolis days before shooting, stayed at the Marott Hotel, spent several days soaking up the Speedway atmosphere and was rumored to have visited the Downtown locations where his late wife, Carole Lombard, made her final public appearances. Lombard, a Hollywood star who was born in Fort Wayne, died in a plane crash in 1942 after a war bond rally in Indianapolis.\n\nGable signed autograph books put before him and joked with the drivers and crews. He was friendly with the press and when asked if he would “turn a lap on the track,” he said, “It won’t be a very fast one. Competition around here is too tough.” Gable loved auto racing and recalled “the drama and danger appealed to him” after attending his first Indy 500 in 1947. Hollywood stunt driver Bud Rose drove in the actual high-speed race scenes.\n\nA crew of 70 from MGM Studios set up shop at the Speedway. Cinematographer Harold Rosson had 14 cameras trained on the racing, the crowd and action scenes. Another camera was mounted in the rear deck of the Mercury pace car to film the start of the race.\n\nThe climactic scene between Gable and Stanwyck took just four minutes to film.\n\nBrannon:“Where are you sitting?”\n\nForbes, pointing up to the stands: “Up there. I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s terrific!”\n\nBrannon:“So are you.”\n\nForbes: “It’s like a heavyweight fight and the Fourth of July rolled into one. Now I see it takes a certain kind of guy.”\n\nBrannon:“And that guy needs a certain type of dame.”\n\nAfter a kiss, he runs to his car.\n\nOnly Clark Gable could get away with calling a woman a dame.\n\nThe dirt track scenes were filmed at Arlington (Texas) Downs and California’s Del Mar Fairgrounds and Carrell Speedway. The 500, filmed in Indy, featured a terrific battle between Brannon and two-time Indy 500 winner Mauri Rose (playing himself). Drivers Johnnie Parsons, Duane Carter, Henry Banks and Walt Faulkner made cameo appearances.\n\nStanwyck had two jobs that day: filming scenes with Gable and giving winner Parsons the celebratory kiss in victory lane.\n\n‘100 Years, 500 Miles’"
