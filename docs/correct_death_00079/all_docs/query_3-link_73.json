        "text": "By the summer of 1934, both Carole Lombard and Russ Columbo were deeply in love with each other. Carole had agreed to take instructions in Catholicism as a preliminary step to marriage. She was also heavily involved in managing his burgeoning career. Russ loved her as a person and he trusted her judgment as an entertainment professional. With Lombard's encouragement he had decided to take additional voice lessons to strengthen his baritone voice not only for the role of Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat but also to sing opera professionally. A newspaper article written at the time expressed concern that he not forget his popular music roots or loose his incredibly smooth sound in the process. The writer pointed out that while there were many good opera singers there was only one Russ Columbo.\n\n**************************************** *********\n\nAll the hopes and the dreams ended in tragedy on Sunday, September 2, 1934. Russ Columbo was killed, the innocent victim in an accidental shooting. He was 26 years old.\n\n(left) Stewart Peters, Carole's brother is Russ' pallbearer on the far left. The pall of gardenias, Russ' favorite flower, was provided by Carole Lombard. (right) Bing Crosby is the pall bearer on the far right. Walter Lang, the director and future husband of \"Fieldsie,\" Carole's secretary, was also a pall bearer, (Lang would later direct the film verson of The King and I.), as were actors, Gilbert Roland and Zeppo Marx, and musician, Sheldon Keate Calloway.\n\nLead, Kindly Light - Voice Male - the hymn that Russ Columbo requested be performed a capella as the recessional for his funeral. In the weeks before his death both he and Carole experienced an almost overwhelming sense of dread and doom. A few days before he died he spoke with his pastor and told him how he wanted his funeral to proceed if he was the one who died. He then went to confession.\n\nA sobbing Carole Lombard is seen (above) leaving the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in Hollywood with her mother and members of the Columbo family after Russ' funeral. During the service Carole sat in the front row with his family in the position of primary mourner. At times during the service she wept uncontrollably.\n\nThe Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park where Russ Columbo is buried in a modestly priced crypt.\n\n\\\n\nThe Hall of Vespers where Russ' crypt is located.\n\n**************************************** ********\n\nCarole Lombard was inconsolable for months following Russ' death but when she did move onward she courageously lived life to the full. Film critics have pointed out that the warm, luminescent screen presence we associate with her today was a result of a new maturity that grew out of her first experiencing real love with Russ and then real grief over his loss. The differences in her film performances pre-Russ Columbo and post Russ Columbo are remarkable.\n\n**************************************** *********\n\nWhen she finally married Clark Gable in late March of 1939, over three years into their relationship and four and a half years after Russ' death, she gave that marriage all that she could possibly give it. They made a very striking couple.\n\n(left) Gable and Lombard arriving at a prize fight in LA. (right) At the LA premier of Gone With The Wind in January, 1940.\n\nCarole created a private world for Gable at their Encino ranch that she purchased with her own money. (Gable was cash strapped after his divorce from his second wife, Ria Langham.) She decorated the house primarily to suit him and in the process sold off her antique collection that she had acquired over the years, much of it with the help of friend, former actor and interior designer, William (Billy) Haines.\n\nAfter completing her engagement in Indianapolis, Carole Lombard, for reasons known only to herself, insisted on flying home to Los Angeles rather than continuing the war bond tour on the East Coast as planned and then returning home by train. Her mother and Otto Winkler tried to persuade her to do otherwise. Allegedly, Winkler put it up to a coin toss and Lombard won.\n\nThe crumpled middle section of TWA Flight # 3 after crashing near Las Vegas.\n\n**************************************** *************************\n\nGiven the worrisome details of the facts and the challenges that he faced, marginalizing Carole's relationship with Russ Columbo and Russ himself was something Strickling viewed as a practical necessity. Ever a ruthless pragmatist, it was a matter of creating a smoke screen and spinning the story so that it burnished the image of Clark Gable.\n\nAs with the tragedy of the Jean Harlow/ Paul Bern matter Strickling found a dependable ally in famed writer Adela Rogers St. Johns. (After Paul Bern's murder St. Johns wrote an article that slandered Bern at Strickling's urging.) She was an old friend of Strickling and had recommended him for his job. And Hedda Hopper, who owed her gossip columnist career to the influence of MGM also proved herself useful. (MGM and Strickling boosted her to contain Louella Parsons.) Their carefully worded articles and comments did the job intended.\n\n· St. Johns, an experienced story teller, mixed fact and fiction in her article for Liberty Magazine published in late February of 1942. She painted Columbo as a mere boy that Lombard pitied. She went on to write tearfully about Gable, the brave but anguished widower and even that how deeply he missed Carole's mother who died with her. (Mrs. Peters wasn't alive to comment. Carole's brothers inherited the money Carole left to her mother but Gable also sent Stewart Peters, the younger one of Carole's two brothers, a demand for repayment of a small amount that Carole had personally loaned him. After the funeral, Carole's brothers had nothing to do with Clark Gable for the rest of their lives.)\n\n· Hedda Hopper, frankly a shrew, painted the talented, hard working and gentle Columbo as a narcistic fruit. (Would she have dared to write something like that while Lombard was still alive?) The best reaction to Hopper was one she received from Spencer Tracy after she published a blind item column about himself and Katherine Hepburn. He encountered her at Ciro's, a restaurant in Hollywood, and he gave her a swift kick in her rear-end.\n\nHoward Strickling's unseen hand was, and still is, at work here. A master at his trade, he picked two sources considered credible by the public at the time and set them to worK putting his spin on the story. Unfortunately it is perpetuated on many of the Carole Lombard and Clark Gable web sites we see on the Internet today. If it were not for film critics like Leonard Maltin and biographer Larry Swindell and his ground breaking book on Lombard for which he interviewed of Noel F. Busch, (Screwball, the Life of Carole Lombard, 1975.), Strickling might have gotten away with his cynical spin on the facts.\n\nAlmost two decades later in late 1960, Howard Strickling guided Kay Gable, Clark's fifth wife, with the arrangements for his burial at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Newsreel footage of Clark Gable's funeral shows Strickling hovering near Kay and directing it. Kay agreed to relegate herself to the position of a consolation prize, and after her death in 1983, would be buried beneath and to the left of Gable. Clark Gable was buried alongside Carole Lombard, thus enshrining forever the legend of their perfect marriage.\n\nStrickling played the role of fixer for Gable to the end, a role that he seemed to relish. The myth and the legend that was \"Clark Gable\", if not his real talent and screen performances, had in large part been Strickling's creation. In The Fixers, E.J. Fleming wrote:\n\nHoward once described his job metaphorically saying, \"Talent is like a precious stone, like a diamond or a ruby. You take care of it. You put it in a safe, you clean it, polish it, look after it. Who knows the value of a star?\" According to him \"there was only one each\" Garbo or Gable, they had to be protected. That's just what he ... did.The damage that he also did knowingly to the reputations of others as a result of his work was very real. Perhaps this is why he never wrote an autobiography after he retired, even when offered money to do so. If he told the truth he would undo much of what he had accomplished. And by revealing his methods of operation, (some of which were already speculated upon), he would not be edifying either himself or his collaborators.\n\n********************************* ***************\n\nCarole Lombard was not only a talented actress and a great beauty but she had a head and a heart. She faced life with courage and with a smile on her face despite serious concerns. The reality of her life was not nearly as idyllic as she wished it to be nor was it as happy as many of her fans thought that it was. But it was a life lived every day at full throttle with love, kindness and humor for those around her. In her final wishes she expressed the independence of mind and the integrity of spirit for which she is so rightly known and admired.\n\nRuss Columbo' place in entertainment history has been helped immensely by the advent of Internet technology. Almost his entire songbook is now available on the world-wide-web. His lush voice and the utter sincerity of his delivery have captured the attention and the admiration of an entirely new generation of listeners around the world. Critics, who in their zealous promotion of emerging swing music discounted Columbo's contributions to the great American songbook, are now seen as having had an agenda and are considered partial. A new generation of music critics is actively reconsidering Russ' work and his contributions to American music.\n\nColumbo's time at film making was brief, but the promise he showed was very real. His personal charisma comes across on film just as readily as it did in person onstage, in his recordings and performances over the radio. He easily projects an appealing warmth and humor that was genuine. It takes little imagination to see that Russ was making the transition from radio and recording star to motion picture icon.\n\nBut it was as a human being that Russ Columbo truly succeeded in his relatively short life. He loved his God, he loved music and he loved Carole Lombard with a deep passion, a sincerity and a sweetness that she had never experienced either before or afterwards. Perhaps this is why she regarded him as the great love of her life and chose to be buried near him.\n\n**************************************** ***************\n\nMay they rest in peace....awaiting, (if you are a believer), the day of the resurrection of the body, judgment and the rewards of eternal life.\n\n**************************************** *******\n\nIn memory of Stella D. Cwiklo, née Wozniak, 1914-2001, a stalwart Russ Columbo fan who provided her insights to the author."
