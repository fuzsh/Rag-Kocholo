        "text": "The examiner said his time of death was 9:11 a.m. on Feb. 22, the report said. Gable had a history of abusing alcohol, marijuana, and Xanax.\n\nHis fiancée found him unresponsive in bed.\n\nGable is best known as being the grandson of the “Gone With The Wind” actor, who died in 1960. However, reports a the time of his death said he was an aspiring actor in his own right and was the host of “Cheaters.”\n\nHis father, John Clark Gable, is the only son of Clark Gable, the legendary actor.\n\nHe was filming in Dallas when he died, and his family told TMZ that he had no prior health issues.\n\n“Cheaters” creator Bobby Goldstein said he never saw Gable use drugs, the news outlet also reported.\n\nClark Gable was an Oscar-winner in “It Happened One Night,” and appeared in other classics such as “Mutiny on the Bounty and ”Run Silent, Run Deep.”\n\nPrince, Lil Peep, Tom Petty, and Mac Miller are among several celebrities who have passed away due to fentanyl overdoses.\n\n“It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China,” he wrote on Aug. 20.\n\n“In China, you have some pretty big companies sending that garbage and killing our people,” Trump said at the time.\n\nThe majority—or least 68 percent—of those deaths could be attributed to opioids such as fentanyl."
