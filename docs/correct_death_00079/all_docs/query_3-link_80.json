        "text": "Identification of mother’s body delayed\n\nClark Gable today received the broken body of his actress wife, Carole Lombard, killed with 21 others in the crash of a TWA airliner Friday night, and made ready to return to Hollywood for funeral services.\n\nMiss Lombard’s body was recovered yesterday from a snowbank beneath the torn wing of the twin motored “Skyclub” plane. It was returned with eight others, still unidentified, and an inquest was held here last night to clear the way for transport, probably by train, to Hollywood.\n\nThe beautiful actress’ body was identified only by dental charts, flown in from Hollywood. It was believed the remains of her mother, Mrs. Elizabeth K. Peters, was among other recovered, but authorities said they could not be certain enough to hold an inquest for her also.\n\nAt the coroner’s inquest, held in the basement office of Justice of the Peace Mahlon Brown, it was found that Miss Lombard “came to her death the night of January 16 as a result of injuries in the crash of a TWA airliner en route from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, near Double or Nothing Mountain.”\n\nName of the mountain added a final fateful touch to the air tragedy. The original decision to go by plane, rather than rail, was decided by a flip of a coin in the hands of Otto Winkler, Miss Lombard’s press agent, who also died in the crash.\n\nFuneral plans were indefinite, pending the return to Hollywood and identification of the body of Mrs. Peters. It was known that the funeral would be held at Forest Lawn Memorial park, where Hollywood celebrities including Jean Harlow and Will Rogers were buried.\n\nBody of Miss Lombard was crushed and burned so badly that identification could be made positive only by the dental charts. A purse containing papers was the basis of a tentative identification of the body believed that of Mrs. Peters.\n\nOthers, including the 15 men of the army air corps ferry command, could be identified only imperfectly by bits of clothing and insignia on uniform buttons.\n\nGable was not present at the inquest, remaining in seclusion at El Rancho Vegas. Almost frantic Saturday while the search was in progress, he became calm after receiving definite news that all aboard the plane were dead.\n\nAfter two fruitless attempts to join parties at the actual wreck scene, Gable received the news at his hotel.\n\nDon McElwaine of MGM received a note from the mountain searchers.\n\n“Bad news?” asked Gable quietly.\n\n“I’m afraid it looks hopeless,” McElwaine replied.\n\n“Oh, God,” Gable moaned, his head sinking in his hands.\n\nHe recovered composure today and remained quietly at his hotel, advised by friends that was the best thing for him to do. His face was pale, and there were deep circles under his eyes.\n\nGable spoke infrequently, only to his close associates, and only of the matters in which it was necessary for him to make decisions regarding return of the body and funeral plans.\n\nOn the jury holding inquest into Miss Lombard’s death were C.W. Turner, H.L. Perry and M.W. Davis, all Las Vegas men. Deputy coroner Jack Lawrence, who went to the plane to help recover the bodies, presided.\n\nIdentification of Miss Lombard at the inquest was made by Eddie Mannix, general manager of MGM studio, and Ralph Wheelwright, assistant public relations manager.\n\nIn addition to dental work, strands of the actress’ blond hair, and correspondence in a purse she carried, were used to make identifications complete.\n\nAmong those who testified at the inquest were Pat Clark, Las Vegas city commissioner, and Harry Purcell, Las Vegas merchant. Both were members of the party who first reached the wreckage Saturday.\n\nGuards were posted at the wreck during the night and at dawn today mountain climbers returned to “Double or Nothing” peak to recover remains of others who died in the smash.\n\nWhen mountain climbers arrived at the wreck yesterday, almost at the 8000 foot level, they found only the tail of the twin motored ship intact. The words “Skyclub” could be read on one fin. Motors were broken from the plane and lay close together. The fuselage was torn and twisted. Bodies were scattered, some outside, some inside the wreckage.\n\nBody of Miss Lombard lay beneath one wing, almost buried in the snow. Other bodies outside the plane were covered partially by snow.\n\nIt was agreed by those who saw the wreck, that all must have died instantly, mercifully. The plane seemed to have plunged squarely into the side of the precipice a few hundred feet below the summit. A black smudge from oil and smoke marked the point of impact on the brown rock.\n\nThree civil aeronautics authority inspectors went to the wreck yesterday and began their official investigation. They declined to comment on their findings, and will return today for further study.\n\nTwo hundred men were in the party which set out yesterday morning to return the bodies. The last 10 miles of the 35 mile trip from Las Vegas can be covered only on foot and with horses, through extremely rugged country and up trailless mountains so steep climbers sometimes had to pull themselves up with their hands.\n\nThe plane lay in a ravine with almost sheer sides. The bodies were wrapped in brown army blankets and lifted 400 feet by ropes, then carried with stretchers to the horses. From the tiny mountain community of Goodsprings they were returned to Las Vegas in army ambulances.\n\nCause of the crash remains a mystery pending the CAA report. The plane halted in Las Vegas for fuel just after dark Friday evening, then took off for Los Angeles. A few moments later it plunged into the mountain."
