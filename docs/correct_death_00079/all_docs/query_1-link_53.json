I will always be next to you my beautiful son.”\n\nNo cause of death was made public.\n\nGable’s sister, actress Kayley Gable also shared the news of her brother’s death on Facebook, writing, “My brother was found unresponsive this morning by his fiancé and didn’t wake up .. I LOVE YOU CLARKIE I’m so sorry we couldn’t save you my heart is broken and shattered RIP.”\n\nGable served as host of the series “Cheaters” for three seasons beginning in 2012, until longtime host Joey Greco returned to the show in 2015. His acting credits include the films “Sunset at Dawn,” “Heckle” and “Looking for Clarissa.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BuMUzyWAbXK/"
