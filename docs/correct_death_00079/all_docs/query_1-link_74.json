He was 30 years old.\n\nTMZ is reporting that the actor was found in bed unresponsive by his fiance. He was transported to Dallas’ Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and was pronounced dead. His sister Kayley Gable confirmed the actor’s death on her Facebook. She wrote:\n\nMy brother was found unresponsive by his fiance, and he did not wake up. “I LOVE YOU CLARKIE I’m so sorry we could not save you. My heart is broken and shattered RIP.\n\nTracy Yarro Scheff, Gable’s mother, wrote on her Instagram:\n\nIt is with a heavy heart we say goodbye to my beautiful son Clark. He died this morning. I will always be next to you my son. Mom.\n\nGable is also the grandson of Clark Cable who is best known for his roles in “Gone With The Wind,” “It Happened One Night,” and “Mutiny on the Bounty.”\n\nIn 2011, the “Cheaters” star was arrested for pointing a laser pointer at an LAPD helicopter. He pled guilty and spent ten days in jail. Also, in 2009, he was stabbed while at a party in L.A.\n\nWritten by Barbara Sobel\n\nSources:\n\nVariety: Clark Gable’s Grandson, Who Hosted ‘Cheaters,’ Found Dead at 30\n\nEW: Clark Gable’s grandson, Cheaters host Clark James Gable, dies at 30\n\nPeople: Clark Gable’s Grandson, Cheaters Host Clark James Gable, Dies at 30\n\nFeatured and Top Image Courtesy of YouTube – Creative Commons License"
