        "text": "Hopedale – Yesterday and Today\n\nSmall towns often have an interesting history that helps us understand those early days in the settlement of Ohio. Hopedale in Harrison County is no exception.\n\nThe first settler there in 1800 was Phillip Delany, a hunter. He swam the Ohio River with his clothes tied on his head so he could buy a section from the Northwest Territory Land Office in Steubenville. He called his settlement Green.\n\nLater Delany sold the land to a resident of Beech Spring, Rev. Cyrus McNeely, who platted the town. His son, also Cyrus McNeely, changed the name of the town to Hopedale because of his high hopes for the schools there. He donated land in 1849 to begin Hopedale Normal College, the first co-ed college in eastern Ohio with tuition of $5 a month.\n\nHorace Mann once taught there and General George Armstrong Custer was one of 10,000 who graduated from the college. Custer received a teaching certificate and taught in Cadiz. A year later, he entered West Point where he graduated in 1862.\n\nThat school grew and eventually included an elementary and high school. They had a six man football team called the Comets. Clark Gable went to school there, rode his sleigh down snowy fields, played in the band, and acted in plays.\n\nWhile Clark Gable was born in Cadiz, his family lived in Hopedale during his youth (1903-1917) at 197 Mill Street. Today that house still stands but is a private residence with no public access. His father came to Hopedale because of an oil strike in 1902.\n\nWhile the oil field brought some financial gain to the area, it was the coal located just under the surface where strip mining began that proved the real boon. But first they needed a railroad to haul the coal. The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad was born with the Wabash Station being located in Hopedale as well as the Wabash Arch.\n\nWhile the college is gone and even the high school that followed it, there is a house across the street from the city building that housed students at the Hopedale Normal College. The city building is actually located on the former grounds of the college and the brick building beside it is now being turned into a museum. A flagpole marks the spot where the college stood years ago.\n\nAnother famous historical site was the Beech Spring Presbyterian Church near Hopedale. It was known as the “Mother Church of Ohio” because it supported the founding of many churches in Harrison and Jefferson counties during the 1800s. The church was torn down in the early 1960s but the cemetery remains. Phillip Delaney was buried there.\n\nThe Underground Railroad was very active in Harrison County. Hopedale played an active role in this, and many anti-slavery meetings were held there. The Columbus Dispatch reported that slaves were kept in the Kyle home, which was built by Cyrus McNeely. Delaney House is a farm homestead documented to have served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. The building has a dry cistern connected to the main house by a tunnel. This was a great hiding place for runaway slaves and an important stop on the route to freedom.\n\nHopedale Theater was built in 1925 by the Stringer Brothers. They showed the latest in moving pictures and continued in operation until the mid 1950s. Some of those early movies were Laurel and Hardy in Swiss Miss, Cassidy of Bar 20, and In Old Chicago. Today that theater has been turned into an Italian restaurant, Capraro’s.\n\nA recent addition to Hopedale has been the Fallen Motorcycle Memorial, a monument to riders gone too soon. A Motorcycle Memorial Wall, similar to the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC, contains names of brothers and sisters from all 50 states and other countries. The memorial is funded by the Motorcyclist Memorial Foundation, which cares for the memorial which is located behind the American Legion Post 682.\n\nMilligan Memorials of Coshocton etched the Indian Black Stone, the darkest of all marbles, which stands atop a grassy knoll. The words written on the stone were written by Dan Waterfield of Oregon, Ohio. Anne Milligan etched the image of the man and woman riding their motorcycles on the winding road while Tim Milligan installed and etched the names of the loved ones lost on the gray pillars.\n\nEach end of the wall is bookended by a full-size 2-D motorcycle carved from that same black granite. The bikes can slide outward as new sections are added for fallen bike riders. In 1993, there were only two slabs with names. Today there are dozens of slabs listing names of bikers who have gone on.\n\nThe Motorcyclist Memorial was unveiled to the public in 1993. Now every year during Memorial Day weekend, they re-dedicate the wall and add more names to the granite pillars on each side of the monument. Nearly 1200 show up annually for this event. Be sure to stop by and visit the Wall if you find yourself in the Hopedale area.\n\nHopedale today contains many family-friendly activities that make it a great place to call home. They have a beautiful ten-acre park that contains several picnic shelters, a basketball court, a tennis court, and a baseball field for the youth. Take an evening stroll on their walking/biking trail. Soon they will have a museum where you can learn more about their history. Plan a visit to this historic town sometime soon.\n\nClark Gable Museum Celebrates Star’s Birthday\n\nVisit the birthplace of the most popular figure on the Hollywood screen from 1936-1960. Clark Gable was born in Cadiz and grew up in Hopedale, Ohio. See his humble beginnings at the Clark Gable Museum in Cadiz…the only Clark Gable Museum in the world.\n\nThe museum came about after a deejay from Illinois called the Cadiz postoffice on February 1, 1983, and asked them if they knew whose birthday it was. The postman said he had no idea. The deejay told him Clark Gable and asked him what they were doing to celebrate his birthday. That was the last time “nothing” was the answer.\n\nWilliam Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901, on 138 Charleston Street in Cadiz. His parents felt he was the apple of their eye. But unfortunately, his mother died when Clark was ten months old and his father then moved down the road to Hopedale, where their home is today a private residence.\n\nHis stepmother played piano and gave Clark lessons at home. He picked up brass instruments as a result and was the only boy in the Hopedale Men’s Band at the age of 13. Also, at this time he had a deep interest in literature and enjoyed Shakespeare’s sonnets.\n\nHis father insisted he engage in some more masculine activities so Clark became very adept at fixing cars. When they moved to Ravenna a few years later, his father wanted him to help on the farm. Clark went to work at Akron Tire and Rubber Company instead. But he seldom worked a full day as he would leave to go to the theater. Even if he went as an usher, at least he was where he loved to be.\n\nClark worked his way west from Ohio by riding in boxcars and worked in the oil fields in Tulsa, Oklahoma along the way. He ended up in Oregon working as a salesman of ties in a department store.\n\nBut that was a good stop for him as he met his first wife there. Josephine Dillon, his wife and coach, saw that beneath his uncultured look there was the potential for a strikingly handsome man. So she had his bad teeth fixed and strengthened his undernourished body. His voice was rather high-pitched and she coached him how to lower it to a deeper resonance.\n\nClark went on to Hollywood to begin his career there as an extra in silent movies. He eventually appeared in 67 talking movies and was called The King of Hollywood. Some of his movies include “It Happened One Night,” “Call of the Wild,” “San Francisco,” and the immortal “Gone With the Wind,” which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1939.\n\nSo it seemed strange that his birthplace of Cadiz, Ohio would not have a display of some kind to acknowledge this famous celebrity. For years, the only things existing on the location where he was born in an upstairs apartment were a garage and flower garden. The house had been demolished years before.\n\nOnce the town decided to honor Clark, the first thing to be erected was a monument at the place of his birth. Then in 1998, the house was reconstructed. It has been furnished in the style of the day and has several of the King’s belongings on display.\n\nCarole Lombard, Clark’s wife, is honored with a large display that was provided by a fan of hers, Norm Lambert. When Carole died in a plane crash while returning from entertaining the troops during WWII, Clark decided he would enlist in the Army Air Force as a tribute to her.\n\nDuring WWII, Clark Gable served as an aerial cameraman and bomber gunner in Europe with the Army Air Force. He enlisted as a private in August 1942 and was relieved from active duty in June 1944 at his request since he was over-age for combat.\n\nInside you will find Clark Gable collectibles as well as “Gone With the Wind” displays. Books and pictures are on display from his childhood to stardom. In the garage, you will even find one of his cars, a classic 1954 Cadillac de Ville.\n\nSince it has been opened, over 150,000 people have stopped by to share their stories and see the treasures. They are made welcome by Nan Mattern, the director, and a dozen ambassadors who help with tours of the facility.\n\nA lady from Portland remembered seeing Clark in his first performance on stage in Oregon. A man recalled his dad telling him the story of riding in a boxcar with Clark Gable as he headed west. His dad had given Clark five dollars for food. Years later Clark came back to that town and wanted to repay him for what he had been given. Many heartwarming stories are shared.\n\nClark Gable was always humble about his good fortune. He commented, “I’m just a lucky slob from Ohio who happened to be in the right place at the right time.”\n\nClark Gable Museum is located at 138 Charleston Street in Cadiz. It is closed December through February, except for Clark’s birthday. The remainder of the year it is open Wednesday through Friday 10 – 4. But if you wish to stop down at a different time or have a group that would like to visit, contact them for an appointment. Call the museum at 740-942-4989 or Nan at 740-942-2505.\n\nJoin the Clark Gable birthday celebration on Saturday in February when the museum will be open from 10 -2 and serve light refreshments. Clark Gable’s birthday will not be forgotten in Cadiz.\n\nClark Gable Museum is at 138 Charleston Street in Cadiz, Ohio. It is near the intersection of US 22 and US 250. Watch for signs directing you to the museum or follow your GPS. It’s not far from downtown Cadiz.\n\nCambridge Glass Goes Hollywood\n\nHooray for Hollywood and Cambridge Glass!\n\nIt’s not surprising that the famous Cambridge Glass has been used in countless movies over the years as it exudes glamour as well as beauty. Several of these pieces are being featured in two large showcases at the National Museum of Cambridge Glass in Cambridge, Ohio, along with photos and cards designating the movies and stars.\n\nThroughout the display of over 6,000 pieces of the collectible Cambridge Glass, other references to Hollywood movies and television shows appear frequently. A few years back a member spotted a piece of Cambridge Glass being used in a movie. After reporting this to the group, all eyes became focused on glassware used in movies. You’ll be surprised at how often Cambridge Glass appears.\n\nThis locally made fine glassware isn’t seen only in older movies. Recently, The Astronaut Wives Club toasted a special moment with Cambridge Rose Point Stemware. In the current series, Empire, stars used an Amethyst Decanter and Sherries.\n\nIt’s impressive to think that local men and women had a hand in producing exquisite glass items that are fine enough quality to be used in Hollywood and television. A favorite on display shows Bing Crosby holding an engraved Bexley champagne glass in the year-after-year favorite of White Christmas.\n\nIf you are interesting in the Hollywood presence of Cambridge Glass, arrangements can be made by tour groups to have volunteers entertain in costume and even break into song. Groups might hear The Haynes Sisters sing, “Sisters, sisters, there were never such devoted sisters…” Or meet Mae West as she flings her boa and entertains the crowd.\n\nThe museum has created a DVD showing some of the movies as well as the Cambridge Glass used, so you know what to look for throughout the museum. The volunteers will then serve as your guides for your stay at the museum.\n\nThese guides not only know their glassware well, but they tell interesting stories along the way. An example would be the story of the Crown Tuscan Flying Lady Bowl used in The Sting.\n\nIn the early days of Cambridge Glass Co, a circus came to town. Several of the glassworkers attended the event. One of those had artistic talents and drew a picture of the trapeze artist performing that day. That picture was taken back to a talented mold maker, who developed this artistic Flying Lady Bowl. What talented men!\n\nEven the western television shows used Cambridge Glass for a touch of glamour. In an episode of Gunsmoke, a little girl was casting her eyes on an etched Portia Doulton water pitcher. The Wild Wild West used a Cambridge Glass perfume atomizer as part of its background.\n\nA personal favorite was the Cambridge Royal Blue and Crystal luncheon set that Clark Gable and Carole Lombard received as a wedding present from a friend in Ft. Wayne, Indiana back in 1939. Nice to know the stars actually used this fine glassware in their homes as well as in the movies.\n\nWhile there are too many to list in this short article, a few favorites have been mentioned. Perhaps they will give you a desire to search out more Hollywood appearances throughout the museum yourself.\n\nYou’ll be impressed.\n\nThe National Museum of Cambridge Glass is located at 136 S. 9th Street just a half block off Wheeling Avenue in downtown Cambridge, Ohio.\n\nGet Your Kicks on Route 66 in Oatman, Arizona\n\nSpectacular Route 66 takes a lot of twists and turns as you travel through the breathtaking mountain vistas from Kingman to Oatman, Arizona. Around every bend there is another beautiful view and not many cars, so you can move at a leisurely pace and even stop for pictures.\n\nBest place to park is on either edge of this living ghost town and then enjoy the walk down the street. You will find many unique stores along the way such as: New Diggin’s, Classy Ass, or White Buffalo Trading Post. Today there are only about 100 people that actually reside in the town although in its gold mining days population reached 3500.\n\n“Get your kicks on Route 66” is a familiar saying, but here in Oatman you have to be careful it isn’t a burro kick! Wild burros eating from your pockets or purse make it a challenge just to walk down the streets of Oatman, Arizona. That is the reason nearly every store has available carrots or “burro chow” at a small cost. The burros are descendants of the pack animals used by early miners in the area and turned loose in the 1940’s. They are today protected by the US Department of the Interior.\n\nAn old adobe two story building, Oatman Hotel, is the oldest building in town, having been built in 1902. Now it is especially remembered as the honeymoon suite of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in 1936. Often they returned here for some peace and quiet, and Clark liked to play poker with the local miners. Their ghosts are said to frequent the place as witnessed by many guests.\n\nOn the weekends, you might be lucky and see a “Wild West” show on the streets. While visiting there, they held up a tour bus (they called it a stage coach) coming to town. Stopped the bus with gunshots from the middle of the road, then boarded the bus to rob the passengers. All in fun of course! This was followed by a gunfight in the street.\n\nLucky to have found a place to step back in history and get the feel of the Old West. Wonder if my luck would continue in the nearby gambling town of Laughlin, Nevada? Taking the shortcut over a thirty mile dirt road, should be there in about an hour. Hop in Lady Luck, let’s go for a ride!"
