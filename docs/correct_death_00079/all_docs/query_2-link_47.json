        "text": "Clark Gable III, the grandson of legendary actor Clark Gable, died from an overdose of fentanyl, oxycodone and Xanax, according to his autopsy report.\n\nThe 30-year-old was found dead in his Dallas home by his fiancée the morning of Feb. 22.\n\nAccording to an autopsy report obtained by Fox News, Gable had fentanyl, oxycodone and alprazolam — the generic name for Xanax — in his system. The overdose was accidental, the Dallas County medical examiner's office said.\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic painkiller 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. It has been cited as a factor in the deaths of Prince and Tom Petty, among others, as synthetic opioids have become the drugs most often involved in overdoses in the United States in recent years.\n\nIn 2012, Gable became the host of Cheaters, a Dallas-based reality show that aims to expose people suspected of cheating on their partners. The show, which had gone on a two-year hiatus, began filming new episodes last year and is now seeking a new host.\n\nA Facebook post signed by Cheaters creator Bobby Goldstein the day of Gable's death read, \"so sad. so so sad. we all loved you clark.\"\n\nHis mother, Tracy Scheff, told Radar that he was \"an amazing kid, a very loving and extremely sensitive soul.\"\n\nGable was the only grandson of Clark Gable, star of films including Gone with the Wind and It Happened One Night. According to a GoFundMe page set up for the family of Clark Gable III, he was buried next to his grandparents.\n\nIn addition to his fiancée, Gable is survived by a 1-year-old daughter."
