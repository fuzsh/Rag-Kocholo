        "text": "Clark Gable & Carole Lombard Estate!\n\nMust SeeTop 10 Florida Condos For Sale\n\nClark Gable was the George Clooney of the 1930s! He was America’s #1 male actor and co-starred with Hollywood's top starlets including Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo. He won an Academy Award for his performance with Claudine Colbert in 1934's It Happened One Night and is best known for his Rhett Butler performance with Vivian Leigh in 1939's Gone with the Wind. Gable was quick to bed many of his leading ladies and, according to Hollywood legend, had a long running affair with Joan Crawford. He also had an affair with Loretta Young which produced a child. Young hid in Europe during her pregnancy and first gave the child up for adoption, then adopted the baby as a single woman. Everyone recognized the child’s Gable ears and, though Gable never claimed the child, no one said a word. MGM wouldn’t stand for gossip.\n\nIt wasn’t until Gable met Carole Lombard that he fell totally in love. It was the perfect intellectual and spiritual match with Gable’s swashbuckling confidence and Lombard’s charm and loyalty. The marriage came to a sad end when Lombard was killed in a plane crash in 1942 while returning from a U.S. war bond campaign. Gable went into a tailspin of grief with heavy drinking and joined the military. When he came back from the war, the American taste in film was changing and he was never quite able to rekindle his former top celebrity status. Gable died in 1960 shortly after his role in The Misfits with Marilyn Monroe. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles next to Carole. The home that Clark and Lombard shared during their short but romantic marriage is on the market.\n\nThe charming pink stucco Old Las Palmas estate in Palm Springs has been restored to its original glory of the Hollywood Golden Age with all the warmth and character of the bygone era. On just over a half acre of tropical landscape, the 3,301-square-foot Spanish colonial home has four bedrooms, six baths, large living room with rafted ceilings and fireplace, gourmet kitchen, French doors that open out to the private gardens from many rooms and a master suite with dual baths and walk-in closets. The grounds contain an old Hollywood-styled swimming pool and guest house. With its setting in lush vegetation, the home is private and quiet yet still close to restaurants and galleries. For more information.\n\nRhett Butler’s . . . er, Clark Gable’s and Carole Lombard’s Palm Springs lovenest is now for sale. Priced at $2.195 million."
