        "text": "Wikipedia writes:\n\nSince 2016 the band has been effectively a pop-punk supergroup, with a core line-up consisting of bassist Mike Herrera (MxPx), guitarist Philip Sneed (ex-Story of the Year) and drummer Travis Barker (blink-182) alongside lead singer John Feldmann and guitarist Charlie Paulson. Barker's busy schedule means the band usually tours with a succession of touring drummers including Cyrus Bolooki (New Found Glory) and Nick Gross (Open Air Stereo, Find Your Grind). Their most recent album, the first with this line-up, was 2017's The Knife.\n\nAs they're doing some fun videos during the quarantine I figured people might want a thread to discuss. Or just reminisce about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Whatever's cool.\n\nThis song’s almost 20 years old, they released it right after 9-11. It also has Good Charlotte & Mest on it, not a bad song. When I saw GC that Fall with Mest, they played it live\n\nEDIT: After listening to it, it’s definitely a re-recorded version of the song\n\nI don’t think I ever even knew Disconnection Notice existed. Just listened to Wasted, Ocean Size, Too Many Nights, and Behind The Mask, I Want, and Stalker all for the first time (haven’t checked out the others just yet). But goddamn, these songs are great. Gives me heavy American Hi-Fi (Hearts on Parade era), Head Automatica, Good Charlotte, Sugarcult, All American Rejects vibes. Surprised this wasn’t as big/popular as those. Ocean Size, Too Many Nights, and Stalker are my favorites\n\nNo backup but they posted a list of some alternative sites. I guess the site owners just don’t have time for it anymore or whatnot."
