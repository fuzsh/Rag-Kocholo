        "text": "MXPX\n\npunk rock\n\nSupport www.hipchristmas.com! Shop at Amazon, Apple Music, and more...\n\nUntil 2009, Washington-based skate punks MXPX never released a Christmas album (Punk Rawk Christmas). And yet, I wrote this review long before then. Why? Because this spirited trio - who sound similar to loud, pop-savvy bands like Green Day or the Descendents - had released a series of fantastic Christmas CD singles, mostly as annual freebies for their devoted fan club. Over the years my fondest desire - after one night alone with Ann-Margaret, a '65 Ford Mustang ragtop, and, of course, world peace - was that one day MXPX would compile all those great songs (and more?) onto one incredibly slammin' CD.\n\nFor years, this seemed about as likely to happen as world peace and that other stuff, and you, dear reader, would have to scrounge for them in dusty record bins and on the internet (check Amazon and eBay) like I did. Punk Rawk Christmas changed all that - almost.\n\nMXPX are one of many of Christian punk and alternative rock groups, though they've kept their religious beliefs understated - so much so that you wouldn't guess from a cursory listen to their music. And, I'm pretty sure the word \"Jesus\" appears nowhere on their website... Anyway, more than anything, you'll notice what's not there - pointless ranting, foul language, or overt violence (\"Christmas Night Of The Zombies\" notwithstanding).\n\nTake a gander, for instance, at what constitutes being \"naughty\" in this excerpt from \"You're The One I Miss (This Christmas)\"...\n\nLet's drink hot chocolate,\n\nand eat some candy.\n\nLet's open all our presents early.\n\nWow, dude, that's living on the edge. But, they rock like crazy, so MXPX can comfortably straddle the cultural fence, appearing with the saints on Happy Christmas Vol. 2 (1999), then alongside the sinners on A Santa Cause (2004).\n\nWritten (sometimes with band input) and sung by bassist Mike Herrera, the MXPX Christmas songs tackle mainly interpersonal concerns apropos to most pop punk (or even emo). The first single, \"Christmas Day\" (1998), is one of their best, and it's fairly typical of the band's approach - a hard-driving, chunky chord progression layered with simple harmonies, relating a story tinged with faith and sexual longing. \"Christmas Day,\" by the way, is one of the only MXPX Christmas tracks available on a commercial CD (the aforementioned Happy Christmas volume).\n\nOn \"Christmas Comes Only Once A Year\" (1999), MXPX turns their attention to matters slightly more weighty (the reason for the season, ahem), with a concomitant downturn in energy. \"Coming Home For Christmas\" (2000) and \"You're The One I Miss (This Christmas)\" (2001) return to matters more carnal, expressing sentiments pretty typical of lonely punk rockers who spend a lot of time in their van. \"Christmas Party\" (2002) is, predictably, more celebratory, claiming \"Every time I sleep, I dream that you will keep living every day like it's a holiday.\" The lyrics are fairly indecipherable, but the band seems to be throwing a Christmas bash. While giddy with anticipation, they're worried that no one's going to show up. At least, I think that's what's going on... Finally, \"So This Is Christmas\" (2003) delves into a murky personal situation, with Herrera confessing that he's \"screwed up so many times,\" begging \"find it in your heart to forgive 'cause this is Christmas.\"\n\nAnd now, as Monty Python used to say, for something completely different. \"Christmas Night Of The Living Dead\" appeared that same year on A Santa Cause, a compilation of punk rockers to benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Foundation for Pediatric AIDS. Herrera dreams that something besides Santa comes to visit on Christmas Eve, something \"hungry for some flesh to eat.\" Zombies! Not one to back down, Herrera pulls out shotguns and axes, eventually \"breaking bones with my bare hands.\" Vowing that \"we won't rest until you're dead,\" he fights till \"the snow is red.\" Nightmare or wish fulfillment? You be the judge.\n\nIn 2004, when MXPX released \"It's Christmas And I'm Sick,\" the band switched to digital downloads. Subsequently, I lost whatever access I might have had to the songs, and our story ended - until 2009 when MxPx finally unleashed Punk Rawk Christmas, a digital compilation of their Christmas singles plus some new tracks. Simply put, Punk Rawk Christmas was nearly everything I could have hoped for - except that it was released only in a digital format, the bane of obsessive/compulsive collectors. But, the fun was just beginning....\n\nA few weeks later - after I'd plunked down cash for the digital album - a limited edition \"green\" CD with an expanded pullout and two extra songs went on sale, originally through the band's website, though versions would later show up in Amazon and elsewhere. So, I bought that, too. Later, another CD - the \"red\" version with the same tracks but a slimmer booklet - became available through Amazon. At least I was spared that final indignity....\n\nMuch later in 2018, the original digital album was deleted and replaced with yet another version - this time with a blue cover and a measly six tracks. Two of those tracks were newly compiled - \"Another Christmas\" (2016) and \"December\" (2018) - but that leaves and number of orphan tracks including \"Santa Claus\" (2009), \"Snowed In\" (2010), \"Christmas On A Friday\" (2015), and \"One Week\" (2017). Let me know if you have copies you'd like to share!\n\nIn 2021, \"Hold Your Tongue and Say Apple\" showed up as a YouTube video and on most streaming services, but not for download, though it later showed up pretty much everywhere including Amazon and Apple Music. The song makes me think that Mike Herrera has daddy issues or has embarked on a campaign of self-improvement - or both. Not unrelated, I think it sets a new record for the most instances of the word \"asshole\" in a single song. \"You've been an asshole for most of your life,\" Mike tells his father, \"so all I want for Christmas is for you to be nice.\"\n\nAnyway, for the aforementioned obsessive/compulsive collectors, the old fan club CD's aren't terribly rare - MXPX must have a big fan club. But, they are nevertheless highly sought after; be prepared to pay dearly. So, for most fans, Punk Rawk Christmas is the answer to their prayers - and a slammin' good soundtrack for any sort of Christmas, religious or secular.\n\nPostscript\n\nIt's worth noting that the band isn't overtly religious anymore - and, in fact, never really wore their faith on their sleeves. According to online sources, the group's members were raised in Christian homes and - when signed to Tooth & Nail Records as a very young band - some of their music naturally reflected those values. But, as they matured, they actively sought to shed the \"Christian punk\" label. \"Do I believe in god? I'm not sure,\" Mike Herrera once said. \"Do I believe in this exact religion? No I don't.\" [top of page]\n\nAlbums\n\nPunk Rawk Christmas (2009)\n\nPunk Rawk Christmas (EP, 2018)\n\nEssential Songs\n\nAnother Christmas (2016)\n\nAnother Song About Christmas (2008)\n\nAuld Lang Syne (2009)\n\nChristmas Day (1998)\n\nChristmas Night Of The Living Dead (2004)\n\nChristmas On A Friday (2015)\n\nChristmas Only Comes Once A Year (1999)\n\nChristmas Party (2002)\n\nCoal (2009)\n\nComing Home For Christmas (2000)\n\nDecember (2018)\n\nGimme Christmas (2007)\n\nHold Your Tongue And Say Apple (2021)\n\nIt's Christmas And I'm Sick (2004)\n\nLate Great Snowball Fight of 2006 (2006)\n\nOne Week (2017)\n\nPunk Rawk Christmas (2009)\n\nQuestions (2009)\n\nSanta Claus (2009)\n\nSnowed In (2010)\n\nSo This Is Christmas (2003)\n\n2005 (2005)\n\nYou're The One I Miss (This Christmas) (2001)\n\nFurther Listening\n\nFan Club Singles 1988-1999 (R.E.M., 2000)\n\nHappy Birthday, Baby Jesus (various artists, 1995)\n\nIt's Finally Christmas!
