        "text": "AC×DC (also known as Antichrist Demoncore) is an American hardcore punk band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 2003. The band has gone through multiple line-up changes and its current line-up consists of vocalist Sergio Amalfitano, guitarists Brian Amalfitano and Aldo Felix, bassist Ryan Corbett and Jorge Luis Herrera. The band's musical style has been mainly labeled as powerviolence, as well as grindcore and hardcore punk with influences from D-beat, crust punk and death metal. The band's aesthetic has been described as \"a strange blend of veganism, straight-edge and Satanism.\"\n\nThe band was formed in 2003 when the members were still in high school. Vocalist Sergio Amalfitano was invited to play in the band by an early guitarist, whom according to Amalfitano planned to form \"a Spazz-type band, where the lyrics talk about Ninja Turtles and stuff.\" The band has generated controversy with some of their recordings, including He Had It Comin' EP (2005), which features a Vietnamese cop shooting a crucified Christ on cover. After entering a hiatus, original members Amalfitano and Jeff Aldape reformed AC×DC with a new line-up in 2010. The new line-up included Amalfitano's twin brother Brian Amalfitano on guitar."
