        "text": "Listening to the latest work by Rise of the Northstar after that the band had already shared in advance the best songs of the record is like going to the cinema to see a comedy after that the funniest jokes have been anticipated by the trailer. Surely the surprise effect is lost, but in the specific case of The Legacy of Shi, which is Rise of the Northstar’s second LP, the problem should not be really imputed to the few songs that were published in advance, but rather to the fact that the remaining tracks of the LP seem to have not the same impact of the singles.\n\nAnyway, beyond this difference between the strongest singles and the weakers songs, the French band has certainly a lot of potentials and these guys from Paris, in just a few years, managed to become one of the emerging realities of hardcore and groove metal. Much of their succees is certainly due to the fact that the band has created a strong and unique identity by mixing together Japanese culture, catchy riffs and a style of music derived from the New York Hardcore scene of the 1990s.\n\nRise of the Northstar is a French heavy metal line-up that was formed in Paris approximately ten years ago. The band plays a style of metal which moves with ease between hardcore and nu-metal, with many influences from groove and crossover. After their debut LP in 2014 (Welcame), they published this year the second and latest LP, The Legacy of Shi, which substantially replicates the same formula that had already been anticipated in their debut work. The songs on the album are all energetic, explosive and with a touch of violence and brutality that makes them particulary impactful. The LP is plenty of clear influences and also explicit references to what has been done in the past by a wide range of bands which includes Pro-Pain, Korn, Slipknot and Body Count.\n\nMaybe what’s missing today in their music is the capacity to evolve a step further and consolidate a style that result as unique and original as the image and the identity that they managed to create. In the meantime, however, we can for sure enjoy the powerful and headbanging songs of their new LP. Apart from the “nostalgia effect”, in fact, this remains a strong and effective record.\n\nThe Legacy of Shi can be streamed from Spotify.\n\nStandout tracks: Nekketsu, Here Comes the Boom, Teenage Rage and All for One.\n\nRise of the Northstar and their new album are contributing to a couple playlists among those I’m curating on Spotify, i.e. GROOVE METAL FEAST (best of groove metal) and POWER OF THE CORE (best of hardcore, beatdown and moshcore).\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast couple of months have been definitely positive for the music world and there are indeed some very good albums that emerged from the mass and which are going to get important positions in the music charts for their respective genres. Let’s review the best albums that were released in the last couple of months. These LPs belong to the must have category and this means that you have to find your way to listen and get them!\n\nA Black Mile To The Surface by Manchester Orchestra\n\nThe award of the best album of the summer goes without any doubt to Manchester Orchestra, the American indie rock band from Georgia which released on late July their 5th full-length album, A Black Mile to the Surface. The LP is a fantastic collection of art rock songs and this is actually one of those albums that will stay among the masterpieces of the band’s career.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, the album meshes togheter the disparate stylistical elements that the guys from Atlanta manifested in their last few productions: gorgeous rock melodies, ambitious and elegant arrangements, layered harmonies and evocative lyrics. And whether you pick up single songs or you deal with the entire album, this work does not disappoint. Definitely.\n\nThe Knife by Goldfinger\n\nWhat can one expect from a rock group which spent the last nine years without any new music and in the meantime 3 of the original 4 members were kicked out from the band?\n\nThese were the premises for The Knife, the new and long-awaited studio album by Goldfinger, the punk band from Los Angeles which gained quite a good reputation across the two centuries for their relevant contribution to the ska-punk sub-genre. But once I started listening to the disc, I found myself literally embarrassed for how good this album was and I ended-up literally seduced by the energy and the freshness emanating from the album. The Knife, released on last July, is the seventh LP from Goldfinger and it managed to cancel in a matter of seconds all the skeptikism one could have on the album.\n\nAfter the last internal revolution, Goldfinger is today a sort of “supergroup” with a new line-up consisting of band leader John Feldman, who’s the only remaining member of the original group, supported by Blink-182’s Travis Barker (who’s maybe the best punk drummer of the current days), talented bassist Mike Herrera and Story of the Year’s rhythm guitarist Philip Sneed.\n\nThe songs in The Knife offer the listener a wonderful mix of melodic punk, alternative rock and ska. The music crafted by Feldman and his new bandmates manages to combine funny and catchy choruses with interesting musical structures. The ska elements are very well balanced and as a matter of fact you can listen the album over and over again without too much saturation. This is an instant classic, one of the best rock albums of the year.\n\nWolves by Rise Against\n\nAnother very good surprise of this summer came from Rise Against, the American melodic hardcore band which published on last June their eighteth studio album, named Wolves.\n\nThe record is full to the brink of the band’s signature and explosive formula where aggressive punk rock and hardcore are combined with fiery vocals and furious choruses. However, with the exception of a couple of catchy songs (including the beautiful single Violence, which is proposed below) the album needs some repeated listening to be appreciated in its entirety. Or at least this was my personal experience…. I had to go through the album a few times before getting involved at the right level by the record’s eleven tracks. Today the album is effectively one of the most appreciated companions for my running workouts.\n\nI inlcude this LP among the best records of the summer because – apart from the absolute beauty of its best tracks – the album in its entirety is characterized by a very high quality of music and lyrics. Rise Against is truly a very good band and the value of their production goes well beyond the politic message they convey with the single songs.\n\nDead Cross (S/T)\n\nFormed on late 2015 by three Retox and ex-Retox members and legendary drummer Dave Lombardo, and with subsequent addition of Mike Patton at the vocals, Dead Cross are a new supergroup that in a relatively short time has been able to impress a deep mark in the metal music scene. Their homonym debut album was dropped on early August and in just a few weeks it soon became one of the most shocking and interesting albums of the year, not only for the evident excellence of the musicians involved in the project, but also for the incredible and noteworthy style which characterizes the music composed by the group. This record seems really to presents that level of innovation that was missing for some time in metal music but it’s at the same time a damn pleasant disk to listen to.\n\nMusically speaking, Dead Cross combines elements of hardcore and thrash metal. The 10 songs of the album are all short and intese pieces of extreme metal and the musical tension remains high along the whole disc, without any indecision and also without any gap-filling piece placed there just to complete the work.\n\nA special note is necessary for Mike Patton, the eclectic and ingenious metal vocalist that has been part of a number of infuential and innovative bands of the last decades such as Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, and many others. This album demostrates that he remains one of the most brilliant metal artists we have and that his vocal ability and range is basicly limitless.\n\nMy hope at this point is that Dead Cross is not just a successful supergroup experiment but it can turn into something stable and prolific, a new reality in today metal scene.\n\nTo The Bone by Steven Wilson\n\nWe anticipated it, and then it delivered. Legendary prog rocker Steven Wilson had already left his mark among the most appreciated musical releases of 2017 with his side-project Blackfield, where he plays togeterh with Israeli songwriter and musician Aviv Geffen. The last work from the duo, Blackfield V, it’s stably at the top positions of most of the charts published on this blog and it’s definitely among the most beautiful progressive rock albums of the last few years.\n\nOn August 2017 Steven Wilson released the new album of his solo-career, named To The Bone, which is the fifth released after the brilliance experience as leader of the Porcupine Tree. As we highlighted in the early tracks we were listening before the full releases, the album confirms that Wilson is a modern artist who keeps pushing further the boundaries of his personal musical exploration, this time showing a remarkable pop sensibility together with the curiosity of manipualting the typical elements of electronics music.\n\nThe judgment that emerges from listening to the entire album substantially confirms all the positive impressions I had before the release, and I also feel that the LP has still a lot to give in the future listening. As a matter of fact, it’s not just a collection of simple musical pieces but an articulated collection of brilliant compositions where the elegance of the arrangement is matched with a new musical concept that needs to be carefully explored.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAfter the recently released two new series on Indie Pop and Indie Rock, I’m inaugurating a similar series of 30′ metal mixtapes with the best new thrash songs which I selected among the official albums released in the last few months. This series, named THIS IS GOING TO HURT, will become ideally a regular entry of the blog and you’ll find an update every time I collect another bunch of new songs to share with you.\n\nAs usual, here is the widget for listening to the mixtape, followed by a short commentary of the bands and the songs included in the playlist. Enjoy!\n\nThe special guest of this playlist is Municipal Waste, the old-school crossover thrash band from Richmond, Virginia. These funny but talented musicians have been around since 2001, but their sound is firmly rooted in the legacy of twentyth century thrash. After a five years period of silence, they’re now back with Slime and Punishment, their sixth studio album, dropped on June 23rd. The work is very good, filled with the usual attack of “party thrash” short and speedy songs (the total duration of the album is less than 30 minutes), this time played with particular precision and an unusual care for the small details. I’ve selected two songs form the album, one for the start and one of the ending of the mixtape. These are, respectively, Dingy Situations, which higlights the skills of the new guitarist Nick “Nikropolis” Poulos, and the title track Slime and Punishment.\n\nJust a few milliseconds after the ending of the first track of the playlist we hear the brutal attack of P.S., the fiery and energetic song taken from Elbereth‘s last work, Karma. The quintet from Legazpi in the Basque country has released on May 2nd the fourth album of their career, from which I selected the second entry of the playlist. This year we’re listening a lot of good music coming from the Iberian Peninsula, something which arrives as a sort of very good surprise.\n\nThird track of the mixtape is Blood Of Religions by Swiss thrasher Voice of Ruin. Their second album, Purge and Purify, was released on May 12, 2017, and it’s one of the most interesting releases from the new generations of thrash bands. Despite the fact that they’re just at the beginning of their promising career, these five guys from Nyon have already shared the stage with metal giants of the calibre of Hatebreed, Children Of Bodom, and Entombed. It’s evident that they have studied and learned from the masters the difficult art of pleasantness, something that it’s not taken from granted in metal.\n\nNext song in the list brings us to France, where the band Heart Attack has recently relesaed their new album, The Resilience. This is a relatively young band (formed in 2009, first LP in 2013) whose style is clearly inspired by the legacy of Pantera and Machine Head, but with the addition of a few peculiar elements which make their music much more interesting than a mere plagiarism of the giants of the past. The song selected for the mixtape, Burn My Flesh, shows a nice guitar work and a series of engaging grooves, supported by a solid rhythmic section.\n\nWith Bloodline, by the Finnish Foreseen, we enter into the second part of the mixtape. The song is included in Grave Danger, the new album that the band released on April 23, 2017. The five guys from Helsinki have elaborated a fierce mix of hardcore, thrash, punk and death metal which permeates all the 8 furious and merciless tracks of the album. If it’s true that the Scandinavian countries, and especially Finland, are typically associated with a kind of suggestive and melodic metal, then this group represents a fierce reaction to this cliché.\n\nTrack number 6 of the mixtape brings us back to the U.S.. The song is Remain Violent, from Woe to the Vanquished, which is the fifth studio album by the American thrash metal band Warbringer. The album, released on March 31, 2017, is the first published after the period of inactivity which the band experienced in 2014, when most of the members of band departed to pursue other projects. The new formation for Warbringer debuted a few years after this moment of internal restructuring. Last year the new lineup started working on the material which ended up in the current release, which is a strong and substantial thrash album.\n\nNear to the end of the playlist – before the second and concluding track I’ve selected from Municipal Waste’s last album, we find the beautiful Wake Up taken from Conformicide, the fourth studio full-lenght disc by the American thrash-metal masters Havok. With this work the guys from Colorado interrupt the four year break since their beautiful 2013’s Unnatural Selection, and as it’s almost usual with this band, there is again a new change in the lineup. Despite the changes, however, the band leader David Sanchez managed once again to put together a solid collection of enjoyable and aggressive old-school thrash songs. As a matter of fact, both Havok’s sound and songwriting skills have improved a lot with the time. As a result, the overall level of their last works is really good and Conformicide, in particular, can considered as their best work so far. There are a couple of songs which stand out for their brilliance, Wake Up being one of them, and in fact their songs have nowadays a stable presence in most of the metal playlists that are published in this blog.\n\nIf you liked this mixtape, you may want to hear (or hear again) the two other series of mixtapes recently inaugurated in the blog:\n\nThe Best New Rock Songs\n\nThe Best New Pop Songs\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe third update of our selection of the best metal album of the year sees quite a good number of new entries, actually 6 albums among the 10 works which are included in this chart (previous selection is available here). As a matter of fact the last two months have seen a few very good releases and we can say that the average quality of the metal music in 2017 is not too bad.\n\nThis is the current chart with the Top 10 Metal Albums of 2017, a dedicated playlist will follow shortly, as usual. Enjoy!\n\n#1) For the Fallen by Memoriam (NEW)\n\nThe current chart of the best metal of 2017 is dominated by Memoriam, the band that here in this blog won the award of the best metal album of the month in March 2017. Memoriam is the new Death Metal band consistings of two former members of Bolt Thrower, i.e. singer Karl Willets and the band’s original drummer Andy Whale, joined by former Benediction’s Frank Healy on bass and Cerebral Fix’s Scott Fairfax on guitar. Leveraging their substantial and proud Death Metal heritage, last year the four metal heroes started playing together in a number of festivals and eventually released in 2017 their debut album, For the Fallen. The album pays an homage to Martin “Kiddie” Kearns, who was the Bolt Thrower’s longtime drummer and who died unexpectedly in 2015 precisely at the time when the British legenday band was going to commence a tour in Australia.\n\nThe immediate feeling you get listening to this fantastic album is how everything in the disc sounds so familiar, in the good sense of the term. It really seems that time has rewound back and now the the sadness we experienced for the loss of one of the most influential bands of the metal scene can be replaced by the knowledge that nothing is lost and the class and charisma of these musicians were not dissolved with the years.\n\n#2) Nightmare Logic by Power Trip (↑)\n\nDespite the fact that a number of new albums entered into this metal chart, Nightmare Logic by Power Trip managed to improve its position in the list. This is because repeated listenings of the songs of this record have highlighted further positive aspects of the album, which thus consolidates its position among the best releases of the year for the metal category.\n\nPower Trip are a metal band from Texas that plays an energetic and violent blend of thrash and hardcore. They aren’t around since many years but have already accumulated considerable experience playing live together with some big names like Anthrax, Lamb of God and Napalm Death. Nigthmare Logic is their second full-lenght album and it’s one of the best thrash metal releases of the last few years: fast, energetic, and somehow innovative with a lot of inserts from other metal sub-genres, such as hardcore and industrial.\n\n#3) Of Chaos And Carnal Pleasures by The Project Hate MCMXCIX (↓)\n\nThe Project Hate MCMXCIX is an experimental and death metal project created by the elusive and mysterious Swedish musician kwown as Lord K Philipson. There is no actual band Beyond Mr. Philipson, since different and variegated friends and musicians are brought in with each and every album. In this respect, The Project Hate is more a studio entity than a real musical group.\n\nSince the beginning of this project, which dates back to the year 2000, 11 albums have been released. The last one, called Of Chaos And Carnal Pleasures, was published in the early months of 2017 and it quickly reached the highest positions of our personal metal chart (actually it achieved the top place in the previous issue of Guerino’s Top Ten metal list). The albums contains a few long and articulated progressive death metal tracks, an irregular and dynamic sequence of musical segments which alternate violent moments with melodic and expressive pieces.\n\n#4) Heartless Oppressor by Primal Attack (↓)\n\nWe found at the 4th place of the chart one of the best surprises of the year, a band who topped our metal selection in the very first months of the year (and which here we awarded for the Best Thrash Metal Album in February 2017). They are Primal Attack, they come from Portugal, and they released a beautiful album called Heartless Oppressor which although strongly inspired from the works of Pantera, Hatebreed and Machine Head, it contains so many original features that establishes itself as a unique piece in the modern metal scene.\n\nHeartless Oppressor is a strongly energetic disc, at times brutal, fully packed with catching riffs and melodies. These guys from Portugal must have some special gift if they managed in less than five years and only two albums to achieve such a maturity in balancing different metal influences, spanning from groove to death metal. This is a disc that we definitely recommend and we expect big things in their future.\n\nSome of the songs of the album they have become a regular presence of our metal playlist\n\n#5) Obituary by Obituary (NEW)\n\nObituary, the Death Metal veterans from Florida have come back with another record, the tenth studio album of their long career, named as the band. Obituary was one of ours most anticipated and in general terms the album didn’t failed our expectations, although we found a little less freshness and innovation than their previous work, i.e. the 2014’s critically acclaimed Inked In Blood.\n\nFrom a musical point of view the new album confirms the path that the the legendary band has embarked in the last ten years, which is a slow but regular transition from the complex structures of theirs first works towards a more “thrashy” and approachable metal style. Their sound, however, is still heavy, obscure and violent. The band has developed and consolidated through the years a unique and easy recognizable signature musical style, which contributed to elevate them as one of the best metal outfits across all metal sub-genres.\n\nWhat may be missing in this album to bring it at same level of the classical masterpieces of the band is some really memorable track, that sort of song that gets into your head and struggles to get out. The average level of the tracks of the album, however, is still superlative and absolutely above the typical production we hear from the younger metal groups that enter today into the metal panorama.\n\n#6) Anomie by Violet Cold (↓)\n\nViolet Cold is an experimental one-man project from Baku, Azerbaijan, and Anomie is the fifth studio released by the the band. The music by Violet Cold has been described as depressive black metal, blackgaze or post black metal. But as sometimes happens, these kinds of tags and labels don’t explain completely the beauty – I would say the musical elegance – that lies behind the wall of sounds and the articulated melodies whic fill such a beautiful record.\n\nThe six tracks of the album compose a long and mysterious musical journey into atmospheric and dark territories, with a few bright glows which every now and then illuminate the scenery. Emin Guliyev, the man behind Violet Cold, really managed to put together a refreshing and original sound which stands out from the mass. The album is esciting and we will be following with great attention the future releases from this project.\n\n#7) Conformicide by Havok (NEW)\n\nAmerican thrash-metal masters Havok released their fourth studio disc, Conformicide, which interrupts the four year break since their beautiful 2013’s Unnatural Selection, which has been so far the longest gap between two band’s albums. As almost usual in the band, there is a new change in the lineup, this time is bassist Mike Leon who left the band and was replaced by former Cephalic Carnage’s Nick Schendzielos. Despite these changes, however, the band led by David Sanchez managed to put together a solid collection of enjoyable and aggressive old-school thrash songs.\n\nBy listening to their interesting discography it’s evidend how both their sound and songwriting skills improved a lot with the time, and one could say that they spent the last years by tuning and further enhancing their music. The overall level of the album is in fact excellent, maybe this can considered their best work so far. There are a couple of songs which stand out for their brilliance, and it’s no by chance that they are now a stable presence in our metal playlists.\n\nAnother important feature of this group is the technical expertise of musicians. The four guys show an unquestionable talent in playing their instruments. The newcomer in the group, in particular, we’re talking of Mr. Schendzielos on bass, impressed us for his furious but precise surgeon-like style. Have a look at the video below to figure out what I’m talking about.\n\n#8) The Diseased Heart Of Society by Solitary (NEW)\n\nSolitary is an English thrash metal band who is formally active since 20 years but who had published their latest album about ten years ago. It is no coincidence, then, that among all the albums that we have heard in the last few months, The Diseased Heart Of Society, which is their recent release, is the one more closely related to the sounds and the style of the past. But if you love this kind of music – as we do – you will for sure appreciate this record, which provides a very good collection of beautiful thrash songs, which benefit of skilled musicians and an excellent production.\n\nThe music from solitary is inspired by the masters of thrash – Testament and Slayer above all – but the four guys from Lancashire show however a personal musical style which evolves from their models. The result is definitely positive; we hope at this point that it won’t be necessary to wait another ten years before the next record.\n\n#9) Bloodlust by Body Count (NEW)\n\nBloodlust is the new album “dropped” by the American metal band Body Count, which was founded almost 30 years ago by legendary rapper and actor Ice-T with guitarist Ernie C. A lot of time has passed since their hated and controversial song “Cop Killer”, which was eventually removed from their first album and caused at the end the terminatio of their contract with Warner Bros. And in fact today their approach is certainly less offensive than their origins. It still remains, however, the urgency to convey a heartfelt message against the misery of some elements of modern society. In this sense, the music in all Body Count’s albums has been always the medium through which transmit their polemical and angry vision of life, and in this respect – with this specific kinds of band – it wouldn’t make so much sense to judge the disc by analyzing only the musical part of the work – which is not too bad however!\n\nFrom a musical point of view, infact, we’re in front of a simple but effective groove metal, sometimes blended with “thrashy” and hardcore moments. The combination of this direct music and Ice-T lyrics is definitely successful in transmitting the right amount of charge and energy. A few metal stars play in some of the songs of the album, including Dave Mustaine and Max Cavalera, and there is also a nice cover of Slayer’s Raining Blood that we enjoyed a lot.\n\n#10) Blood – Fury – Domination by Arthemis (NEW)\n\nThe current edition of the Top TenChart of metal closes with a particular entry, which is not only the unique “Heavy Metal” album of the list, but also one of the first groups from Italy that we had the pleasure to hear in the last period. As these guys describe themselves, the style of Arthemis is a combination of the dark side of heavy metal with thrash-oriented guitar riffs, fast solos and catchy vocals. Arthemis have released 8 full-length albums Worldwide, whith Blood – Fury – Domination being the last one of their rich discography.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEdit: there is an updated chart for the best metal albums in 2017. Check it out from the home page.\n\nIn a period of absence of major publications, we’ve been able to focus our attention on those niche works that represent the undergrowth of the metal world. We discovered new groups from the most disparate parts of our globe; we noted with pleasure that a few legacy indie groups keep on releasing very good material without chasing the lure of commercial success; we appreciated the effort from a number of bands in exploring remote musical territories. We draw the conclusion that metal is still alive, sometimes it manages to reinvent itself by merging together different techniques and multiple inspirations, generating sometimes results that exceed expectations.\n\nThis is the list of the best 10 metal albums we listened in the first two months of 2017. You will probably find some groups of which you had no knowledge before. Probably, towards the end of the year, these little jewels will suffocate under the weight of the great metals albums to come. But, for now, let them enjoy this unexpected visibility.\n\n1 – The Project Hate MCMXCIX: Of Chaos And Carnal Pleasures\n\nOf Chaos and Carnal Pleasures is the eleventh studio release from the Swedish death-metal project founded by Lord K. Philipson, a project which sees Philipson as the only fixed member in the band; on every album he’s supported by a wide array of musicians. The six songs in this self-released work mixes together a number of different inspirations but the final result is far from being chaotic. This is indeed an excellent and very enjoyable collection of eclectic and progressive tracks. (Sub-genres: Death, Progressive, Experimental, Technical Death, Industrial)\n\nOf Chaos And Carnal Pleasures has exceeded all of my expectations, and I have known for quite some time that it would be absolutely spectacular to begin with. The work that everyone involved provided for me is the best shit I’ve ever heard. I speak greatly of this album and I do so for the simple reason it truly is something special that has been created (L.K. Philipson, Metal Underground)\n\n2 – Primal Attack, Heartless Oppressor\n\nPrimal Attak is a relatively young thrash and groove metal band from Portugal. Three years after the release of their debut album, Humans, they are now back with their sophomore release, Heartless Oppressor. This is a very solid and energetic album, and even if it is strongly inspired from the works of Pantera, Hatebreed and Machine Head, it contains so many original features that establishes itself as a unique piece in the modern metal scene. This is a strongly energetic disc, at times brutal, fully packed with catching riffs and melodies. (Sub-Genres: Thrash, Death, Groove)\n\nThis is the first album this year that I can call an absolute balls-to-the-wall, no frills, uncompromisingly brutal metal album in its sheer intensity. Heartless Oppressor is exactly the sound of all the world’s major powers nuking the fuck out of each other. (No Clean Singing)\n\nThe new album not only picks up right where its predecessor left off, but also surpasses expectations showcasing a much stronger, tighter and more dynamic unit (from Bandcamp)\n\n3 – Power Trip: Nightmare Logic\n\nNightmare Logic is the second album from Texas hardcore thrashers Power Trip.What really strikes in their songs is the ease with which different genres (thrash, hardcore, groove, just to mention a few) are mixed together to create an explosive and original mixture, which is at the end absolutely enjoyable to ear. (Sub-Genres: Thrash, Industrial, Hardcore)\n\nYou don’t need to be a metalhead to have a blast with Nightmare Logic. Screamed sardonics, persistent chug, and apocalyptic melodrama are all acquired tastes, sure. But Power Trip’s fist-pumping choruses, ricocheting grooves, and ample charm are so animated that they leave us with something addictive and, well, fun. (Pitchfork)\n\nThe second crushing, soul mangling, neck bustin’ album from Texas hardcore thrashers: Power Trip. Their raw energy, musical proficiency, perfect song structure, rich tones, fierce riffs, persecution, and collective attitude have seeded them as one of the most prolific underground staples in the US metal, punk, and hardcore scenes (from Bandcamp)\n\n4 – Code Orange: Forever\n\nCode Orange is an American metalcore from Pittsburgh, since 2012 they have released three albums. Their last work, named Forever, stands out because of its good qualities: nice songs, an audible sense of anger, and nice production. (Sub-Genres: Hardcore, Metalcore, Punk)\n\nWhat helps make Forever a solid release though are the odd surprises within it. These surprises take the listener out of that constant crunch and hardcore slam, and present really terrific spins that are way out there. And with everything together, comes one beastly collection of jams (from Metal Injection)\n\n5 – Violet Cold: Anomie\n\nAnomie is the last release from Violet Cold, which is the experimental one-man band from Baku, Azerbaijan, active from 2013. This musical project by Emin Guliyev draws influence from a huge variety of styles including ambient, noise, classical, folk and black metal. (Sub-Genres: Atmospheric Black Metal, Experimental, Blackgaze, Post-Black, Shoegaze).\n\nWhat makes Violet Cold unique is the fact that every piece of the puzzle is totally “DIY,” from artwork, instruments, lyrics, and vocals to recording, mixing and mastering. This is all done by Emin Guliyev, who doesn’t have any formal musical training. The result is a disregard for the rules and a totally fresh sound (Last.fm)\n\n6 – Zerozonic: Zerozonic\n\nZerozonic is a thrash metal band from Norway; they have just released the fourth album of their career, which is a solide piece of metal packed with nice and interesting songs. (Sub-Genres: Trhash, Groove)\n\nPantera is frequently mentioned as an influence and a soundalike, and while this band is not a Pantera clone, the similarities are there: this is groove-laden, modern aggro-thrash, with vocals vaguely in the Anselmo ballpark. (BNR metal pages)\n\n7 – Dead Trails, S/T\n\nDead Trails are a new thrash and death metal band from South UK; they started playing together since 2010 and have just released their debut long play (the album can be download for free ond bandcamp). This album is very nice and presents a nice combination of raw sounds and thrash riffs. I definitely recommend to download and listen, there are a few songs that are very nice to hear if you are into the death metal genre. (Sub-Genres: Deathl, Thrash)\n\n8 – Decadence, Undergrounder\n\nDecadence is a Sweden-based melodic thrash metal group powered by its two main members, ‘Metallic’ Kitty Saric and Kenneth Lantz. The two have been writing music together for over 15 years, and Undergrounder is the fifth album of their career. Characterized by female vocals and a distinct signature sound, this work interrupts a long period of silence that the band decided to take after the first decade of musical activity. (Sub-Genres: Thrash, Melodic Death)\n\nDecadence never stopped, it evolved. And now they are back to continue spreading the message (said Kitty Saric to Blabbermouth)\n\nA particularity of this release is that the band published a lyric video for every song in the album. Here we link the videos of the two songs we liked the most, i.e. the beautiful title-track and the old-school thrash of One More Fight.\n\n9 – Angry Again, Divide and Conquer\n\nDivide and Conquer is the second work from an interesting unsigned band from Switzerland. They play an enjoyable blend of epic, powerful and groovy metal which takes clear influences from Hatebreed and Machine Head. (Sub-Genres: Thrash, Groove)\n\n10 – Soen, Lykaia\n\nSoen is a progressive metal “supergroup” consisting of various high-profile extreme metal musicians. Lykaia is the third album released by the band and has the particularity that the whole album was recorded using only analog equipment. (Sub-Genres: Progressive metal)\n\nLykaia is ultimately a prog metal album of very high quality, and one that should be on the radar of any metal fan. Although there are strong similarities between songs, and sometimes other bands, the songs and album Soen have created are meticulously crafted by musicians playing and writing at the top of their game, to produce a heavy, melodic, and frequently emotional journey of moody metal.
