        "meta_description": "Ready To Rage by MxPx, released 25 August 2023\n\nStanding on a platform\nWaiting for a train \nFeels like the time is moving further away\nIf patience is a virtue\nThen surely so is pain \nAnd all the hell that we’re made to pay\nSo run for your lives\nOr swallow the pill\nThere’s no turning back\nNo this isn’t a drill\nIt’s the fight of our lives\nOur coming of age\nNow it’s getting harder\nTo stay this engaged\nNow I’m ready to rage!\nWe tend to skirt the issues\nIgnore the hardest parts\nThe ignorance is way off the charts\nBut you can’t throw a wolf to the wolves cause they’ll just laugh\nThey’ll smile as they tear you in half\nSo run for your lives\nOr swallow the pill\nThere’s no turning back\nNo this isn’t a drill\nIt’s the fight of our lives\nOur coming of age\nNow it’s getting harder\nTo stay this engaged\nI’m ready to rage!\nSo run for your lives\nOr swallow the pill\nThere’s no turning back\nNo this isn’t a drill\nIt’s the fight of our lives\nOur coming of age\nNow it’s getting harder\nTo stay this engaged\nAre you feeling lost\nwith so much to gain?\nWe have to be smarter\nLearn when to refrain \nWhen you take the plunge\nNo matter your doubt\nIsn’t that what this whole life is about?\nLet’s figure it out",
