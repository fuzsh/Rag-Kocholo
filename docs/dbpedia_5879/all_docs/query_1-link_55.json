        "text": "This essay aims to investigate the role the category of genre has in music-related discourses in an age characterized by its interest in the liminal, or the non-generic. The objective is determining whether the concept of genre still has a useful role to play today (when many discard it for a range of different reasons). The hypothesis is that genre can no longer be used as a normative, taxonomic category, yet that it continues to fulfil a crucial function as a “generic contract,” an agent of communication that provides information influencing and facilitating the reception of music. Taking a digital graphic representation of popular-music genres as a starting point, the problems and challenges of generic classifications in today’s world are outlined, proposed alternative approaches (such as the “post-genre” phenomenon) are explored, and recent musicological thinking on the topic is assessed. A look at the structure and function of Spotify’s map of “genre-shaped distinctions” leads to a discussion of the function of genres in the digital music industry: its ultimate aim is the classification of the listener, rather than the music, for the purpose of micro-targeting. This leads to an assessment of genre as an agent of power and the potential of emic and etic points of view to expand our perspective. The essay concludes that both the communicative and the economic functions of the genre category are united by their application in a liminal context in which uniqueness and hybridity appear to deny the usefulness of genres while paradoxically still relying on them. Keywords: Music and genre, musical classification, music and taxonomy, music and the digital economy, micro-targeting, music and power, emic and etic approaches to music, post-genre.\n\nMusical genres are fraught with issues of temporality. Commonly conceived as musico-cultural regularities regulating practice across musical life, they are never- theless inherently unstable, making non-reductivist accounts of the temporospatial dissemination of genres a persistent challenge to musical genre studies. In this, prima- rily theoretical article, I engage with this challenge by discussing the relation of genre abstraction, dissemination and trajectories. In keeping with recent developments in musical genre studies, I combine an account of genre drawing on post-structuralism and pragmatism along with inspirations from assemblage theory and actor-network theory. On these grounds, it is argued that a distributed understanding of abstraction – specified as the combined act of singling out, symbolising and systematising and interlinked with processes of mobilisation, autonomisation, building alliances and promotion – is key to the temporospatial assemblage of genres in a directed sense, i.e. their dissemination and trajectories.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the usage of the concept of genre remains widespread in discourses around music, cinema, theatre, literature. However, for a long period of time, musicologists have paid little attention to genre, which is considered to be an outdated legacy of positivism: a concept belonging to amateurish criticism or daily musical practice – and incompatible with the hegemonic ideology of ‘absolute music’. In the commentary that follows, the history of my own efforts to bring genre back to the theoretical core of musicological debate is outlined, and intertwined with the work of other scholars (sociologists, cultural theorists, anthropologists) who helped re-define genre as a useful concept in the scholarly study of music. Popular music, as a set of genres from which paramusical elements – and related social conventions – were never expelled as spurious (as formalist musicology did with respect to Western art music), was obviously my main focus, although in some writings I deal with classical music, electronic music and traditional (folk) music. After examining at some length the development of my theory of genre (definitions, ‘rules’ and conventions, inter-genre relations and intra-genre diachronic development), the commentary focuses on a number of studies of specific (mostly popular) genres, music scenes, forms, artists, where genre is an underlying concept. One of the most delicate aspects of any theory about genre, and one that has been at the centre of my investigation for so long, is that of diachronic development; as a consequence, the history of popular music became at some point a favourite subject for my study – my contributions are outlined in the commentary which can be read in conjunction with my writings on the subject. Finally, a section is dedicated to my writings on music technology, music industry, and media. In the conclusions my work on genre is contextualised nationally and internationally, with some considerations on linguistic issues; the commentary ends with a brief outline of my future research plans.\n\nThe Routledge Companion to Popular Music Analysis: Expanding Approaches widens the scope of analytical approaches for popular music This study endeavors to create a new analytical paradigm for examining popular music by taking the perspective of developments in contemporary art music as a point of departure to open up multiple new paradigms. \" Expanded approaches \" for popular music analysis is broadly defined as any compositional, analytical, or theoretical concept outside the domain of common practice tonality that shapes the pitch-class structures, form, timbre, rhythm, or aesthetics of various forms of popular music. The essays in this collection investigate a variety of analytical, theoretical, historical, and aesthetic com-monalities popular music shares with 20th and 21st century art music. From rock and pop to hip hop and rap, dance and electronica, from the 1930s to present day, this companion explores these connections in five parts: With contributions by established scholars and promising emerging scholars in music theory and historical musicology from North America, Europe, and Australia, The Routledge Companion to Popular Music Analysis: Expanding Approaches offers nuanced and detailed perspectives that address the relationships between concert and popular music.\n\nRecent work in the sociology of music suggests a declining importance of genre categories. Yet other work in this research stream and in the sociology of classification argues for the continued prevalence of genres as a meaningful tool through which creators, critics and consumers focus their attention in the topology of available works. Building from work in the study of categories and categorization we examine how boundary strength and internal differentiation structure the genre pairings of some 3 million musicians and groups. Using a range of network-based and statistical techniques, we uncover three musical \" complexes, \" which are collectively constituted by 16 smaller genre communities. Our analysis shows that the musical universe is not monolithically organized but rather composed of multiple worlds that are differently structured—i.e., uncentered, single-centered, and multi-centered."
