        "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has made many of us put our lives on pause, literally and psychically. Now Mike Herrera (known for his time in the punk band MxPx) is sharing his reflections with the world on “Superman.” It’s a cover of the Goldfinger song everybody loved while playing the classic video game Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.\n\n“So here I am… getting to play a song that means the world to not only myself but to so many Goldfinger and Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans out there,” Herrera says. “I wanted to do this justice and put my own experience into this new version of an incredible song. I really hope this helps anyone listening through their own personal struggles and the collective insanity we are all up against right now. Enjoy.”\n\nThe track was recorded at Herrera’s home studio in Waco, Texas, where he and his family are having their best time in self-isolation. (The rest of MxPx are still in Bremerton, Washington.) It’s the first new music we’ve heard from him since the release of several digital singles last year (“A Thousand More Times,” “Don’t Walk Away,” “Lights Out”).\n\nThe accompanying video is a montage of personal and professional highlights. You can see Herrera on the road, fraternizing with his buds. There’s some street busking and ass-kicking while playing bass on Goldfinger’s last tour. The clip is a celebration of a punk-rock lifer and all the fun that transpired. He describes it as “some recent good times with my band, my friends and family. Happy moments in life.”\n\n“Superman” will be available on all streaming platforms tonight at midnight (Friday March 27). We’re sure John Feldmann certainly approves of it, much like your heart will. Watch and listen below."
