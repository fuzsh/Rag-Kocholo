        "text": "Pop Punk\n\nBremerton, Washington, USA\n\nMxPx is an American pop punk band from Bremerton, Washington, founded in 1992 as Magnified Plaid. A number of the group's releases have charted on Billboard, including the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on Billboard Christian Albums.\n\nMxPx was formed in July 1992 by Mike Herrera, Yuri Ruley, and Andy Husted, who were 15 years old at the time, and classmates at Central Kitsap High School in Silverdale, Washington. Initially, the band played music inspired by Descendents, Black Flag and other punk rock bands.\n\nThe name, originally Magnified Plaid, was a tribute to Husted's fascination with plaid shirts, but did not fit on the band's posters. Consequently, the name was abbreviated to M.P. on show posters. Yuri Ruley, who used Xs in place of periods, made the posters for the band, resulting in the four-letter moniker.\n\nMxPx caught the attention of Tooth & Nail Records when the band played a showcase for the label in 1993 in Herrera's parents' back yard. The band's first major album, Pokinatcha (1994), was released while the band members were still in high school. The album, though classified as Christian punk, incorporated the quick styles of hardcore punk, and is composed of influence from skate/surf punk and punk underground. The songs are characterized by their raw punk sound, catchy rhythm, and classic punk three-chord guitar style.\n\nGuitarist Andy Husted soon left the band and was replaced by Herrera's longtime friend, Tom Wisniewski. Despite only knowing power chords on guitar, Wisniewski was willing to be in the band. MxPx released two further albums with Tooth & Nail: Teenage Politics in 1995, and Life in General in 1996, which features the single “Chick Magnet” and artwork by the artist Coop.\n\n(to be continued…)\n\n1993 Independent\n\nMike Herrera – Bass, vocals\n\nAndy Husted – Guitar, backup vocals\n\nYuri Ruley – Drums, backup vocals\n\nRecorded by Aaron Sprinkle at his church's studio in Seattle\n\nWalking Bye\n\nSuggestion Box\n\nTwisted Words\n\nToo Much Thinking\n\n“This demo cassette was sent to Brandon Ebel at Tooth & Nail Records by Aaron and is what ultimately lead to the band being signed by the label on May 9, 1994. The tracks were originally to be released as a 7” vinyl record to be titled Circular Files, but instead it was decided to record a full album at Avast! studios the following July. Three of the tracks from this demo were released on the 2006 Deluxe Edition re-release of Let It Happen. All four of these tracks were re-recorded in the studio for the official album releases of Pokinatcha and 17.”"
