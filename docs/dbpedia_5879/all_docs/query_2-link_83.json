        "text": "In honor of Five Iron Frenzy day, the band drops hard hitting new song – “When They Find You”. The song features backing vocals from Mike Herrera of long running left coast punk act, MxPx. Listening to this song first time through I made up assumptions and drew targets to throw foam darts at in the hopes making my confusion stick somehow. I read through some comments on different social media sites, scratching my head reading some of the responses then instantly connected with the lyrics Reese Roper posted in the comments of the FIF page (Facebook). Once the subject matter sunk in and reality of knowing that this kind of abuse exists in all circles including in Christian homes and Christian music, my eyes welled up with tears and my fists clenched tight, trembling with anger to avenge the many known and unknown Children that grew up abused. Read the lyrics below right here on Indie Vision Music. The music beats fast and that ferocity is met with a sense of melodic justice only Reese and Mike could lay down on a punk rock song such as this. Honestly, this is FIF in their best element, making deep songs that connect with melodies and a great sound splashed with horn section. Another new song “Huerfano” off their latest album has a similar feel and really brings on the emotions. Maybe I’ve gotten sappy in my old age but I find these kinds of songs and that connection you feel, such an important piece of the Five Iron experience. While I did think some of the songs on their most recent album was a little heavy handed, with more angst than hope, and more attitude than open arms, I still follow the band for each new thing they drop. Those closing songs on several of their early works are classics and that is what I love best. This song is brutal and gritty, with hope on the back burner but shining a light on something very serious in our world that goes unchecked and rarely talked about unless someone dies. Don’t let another one die. If you know abuse, see abuse, or hear about abuse, don’t go silent, say something and tell someone.\n\nLyrics:\n\nWhen they find you\n\nUnderneath your window,\n\nwrite me a secret.\n\nJust inside your closet,\n\nsend me a message.\n\nThe kids at school,\n\nthey can’t know you,\n\nnever know this,\n\nwhere he hit you.\n\nWhere they can’t find,\n\nunseen, behind,\n\ndown in the dark hall,\n\nfists through the drywall.\n\nWrite your name,\n\nwindow pane,\n\nwrite the words,\n\ntell me when they find you.\n\nWish upon the first star,\n\nblue lights from a cop car.\n\nWish upon the streetlight.\n\nGoodbye, goodnight.\n\nOne day will they find you,\n\nwhite lines to outline you,\n\nnever knowing of you?\n\nDoes anybody love you?\n\nWhere I patched your drywall,\n\nwhere l found your name,\n\njust above the staircase,\n\njust behind the doorframe.\n\nThe teachers at school,\n\nmissed every sign,\n\nmissed every bruise-\n\nsutures to scalp-line.\n\nFalling down stairs,\n\nfell off of your chair\n\ncutting your lip too-\n\nnobody hit you.\n\nWrite your name,\n\nwindow pane,\n\nwrite the words.\n\nTell me when they find you.\n\nMike: Wish upon the first star,\n\nblue lights from a cop car.\n\nWish upon the streetlight.\n\nGoodbye, goodnight.\n\nOne day will they find you,\n\nwhite lines to outline you,\n\nnever knowing of you?\n\nDoes anybody love you?\n\nReese: Suffering. Suffer the children unto me"
