        "text": "There are still many a music fan out there that doesnt quite get where the roads of punk and country or folk meet. For those that do “get it”, it isnt hard to draw a straight line that connects the spirits of Woody Guthrie and Joe Strummer. While the sonics of the two genres can often reside on opposite ends of the spectrum, artists such as Hank III and .357 String Band have deftly displayed why that isnt always the case.\n\nMike Herrera, one of the leaders of punk band MxPx, is one of those who truly “gets it”. His band, Tumbledown (Official / Myspace), has just released another collection of tunes (their Live in Tulsa LP) that should help anyone who needs further explanation on where the paths of the seemingly opposite sounds converge. By mixing the blazing tempos of the genre that has made him famous with the dusty twang that he has always held dear, Hererra has crafted a solid record filled with haunting, and at times thrashing, western gothic greatness.\n\nBallad Of A Factory Man/Mike Herrera’s Tumbledown from mike herrera on Vimeo.\n\nAbout the author: I likes me some wine, women and waffles, not always in that order (but usually). Chaucer is cool, but fart jokes are even better. You feel like spikin' your country with a little soul or mix in a little rock without the roll? Lemme hear from ya!!"
