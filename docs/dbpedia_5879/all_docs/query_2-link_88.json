        "text": "Two and a half years ago, my friend Jordan Butcher asked me if I would be interested in helping him work on a book detailing the history of Tooth & Nail Records. I nearly passed out.\n\nI can still remember the day I brought home my first MxPx record, On The Cover. It was my first taste of punk rock and upon first listening to the heavy distortion and blistering, hooky renditions of songs like “Summer of ’69” and Keith Green’s “You Put This Love In My Heart,” I thought it was horrible. Then I listened to it a few more times, something clicked, and my life changed forever. Over the next few years, a whole new world opened up to me and my friends, as we discovered dozens of punk and hardcore bands, including Tooth & Nail fixtures like Zao, Slick Shoes, and our hometown heroes, Craig’s Brother.\n\nAlthough I couldn’t have articulated it at the time, my decision to buy that MxPx album on a whim at the San Jose Berean Bookstore was a pivotal moment in my life. The Bremerton trio and a slew of other Tooth & Nail bands introduced me, a kid who had grown up listening to Petra and DC Talk, to a new understanding of what art could be. A few years later I saw MxPx play live at a little converted warehouse in Concord, CA. The pitched anticipation of seeing my icons in the flesh for the first time was somehow surpassed when they finally hit the stage and tore through a high energy set punctuated by Mike Herrera’s cool-but-never-aloof banter. I experienced the kind of euphoria only a teenager at a rock concert can.\n\nIn the course of writing No New Kinda Story, a visual history of the label annotated with short stories and the kind of little known, anecdotal details only a true fan will care about, I got the chance to speak with guys like Ronnie Martin (Joy Electric), David Bazan (Pedro the Lion), Bill Power (Blenderhead) and Mike Herrera himself. It was a labor of love and a profound honor to get to write about records and artists that millions of people have intimate associations with.\n\nThe book is a companion piece to a film of the same name. I’ve seen the rough cut and it promises to be an epic journey down memory lane. Jordan and his team posted the trailer last week. Info on the release dates for both book and film to follow soon."
