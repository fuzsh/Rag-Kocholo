        "text": "Death Metal: A Decades-Long Odyssey through Sonic Brutality\n\nIn the vast realm of heavy metal, a subgenre has emerged with a ferocity and intensity unmatched by its peers – Death Metal. Originating from the underground scene in the early 1980s, Death Metal music has grown into a global phenomenon with a diverse range of subgenres, each carving its own sonic niche. This article delves into the roots, growth, and cultural impact of the genre, exploring its various subgenres and the passionate community that has embraced its brutal allure.\n\nOrigins: A Brutal Birth in the Underground\n\nThe genesis of this aggressive new type of heavy metal can be traced back to the early 1980s, primarily in the United States and Europe. Artists like POSSESSED, DEATH and MORBID ANGEL played pioneering roles in forging the raw, aggressive sound that would come to define the genre. Chuck Schuldiner, often hailed as the “Godfather” of the genre, shaped its early sound with DEATH‘s 1987 debut album, “Scream Bloody Gore.” POSSESSED‘s “Seven Churches” (1985) is another cornerstone, featuring blast beats, guttural vocals, and dark lyrical themes that would become signatures of the then burgeoning sound.\n\nGrowth and Evolution: The 1990s Explosion\n\nThe 1990s witnessed a surge in the extreme music’s popularity, with bands refining and expanding it’s sonic boundaries. Florida’s DEATH and MORBID ANGEL continued to push the sound forward with releases like “Human” (1991) and “Covenant” (1993). Swedish bands, including ENTOMBED, DISMEMBER and AT THE GATES, introduced a distinct “Swedish” style characterized by the use of buzzsaw guitar tones and melody.\n\nSubgenres Unleashed: A Sonic Tapestry of Brutality\n\nTechnical: Emerging in the late 1980s, “technical” takes the genre’s complexity to new heights. Technical Death Metal Bands like ATHIEST, CYNIC, and NECROPHAGIST weave intricate musical passages, odd time signatures, and progressive elements into the brutal framework of the genre.\n\nGrindcore: Though a distinct genre, grindcore shares it’s roots with it’s brutal metal counterparts and often coexists within the extreme metal spectrum. Pioneered by bands like NAPALM DEATH and CARCASS, grindcore incorporates elements of punk, featuring short, intense songs, blast beats, and guttural vocals.\n\nDeathcore: In the 2000s, deathcore emerged, blending extreme metal’s brutality with elements of metalcore. Bands like WHITECHAPEL, SUICIDE SILENCE and CARNIFEX introduced breakdowns and core-influenced structures while maintaining Death’s ferocity.\n\nMelodic: With roots in the Gothenburg scene, “melodic”, or “melodeath,” adds a harmonious dimension to the genre. Death Metal artists such as IN FLAMES, DARK TRANQUILITY and AT THE GATES pioneered this style, combining aggressive riffing with memorable melodies.\n\nProgressive: As the genre evolved, a wave of bands sought to push its boundaries further. OPETH, BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME and EDGE OF SANITY infused progressive elements, intricate compositions, and diverse instrumentation into the genre.\n\nBlackened: Merging the intensity of black metal with the brutality of death, blackened emerged as a darker, more atmospheric subgenre. Bands like BEHEMOTH and BELPHEGOR incorporate blast beats, tremolo picking, and occult themes.\n\nCultural Impact: A Sonic Rebellion\n\nExtreme Metal’s impact extends beyond its sonic landscapes, influencing art, fashion, and fostering a unique subculture. Album cover art often features grotesque, surreal, or occult imagery, and the genre’s iconography is deeply embedded in metal culture. Metal festivals, including Maryland Deathfest and Obscene Extreme, celebrate the diversity of the genre, attracting devoted fans from around the globe.\n\nThe Listener: A Diverse Tapestry\n\nContrary to misconceptions, extreme metal fans represent a diverse group. From students of music theory dissecting technical nuances to those seeking an adrenaline rush through sonic extremity, This type of metal’s appeal spans age, ethnicity, and socio-economic backgrounds. The community is united by a shared passion for the genre’s uncompromising intensity and the creative diversity it offers.\n\nA Sonic Legacy\n\nExtreme metal’s journey from the underground to a global force has been a testament to its resilience and ability to evolve. The genre’s impact is not only heard in the roaring riffs and guttural vocals but also felt in the countless bands and subgenres it has spawned. As the genre continues to mutate and inspire new generations, its legacy remains an indelible mark on the vast tapestry of heavy metal.\n\nDeath Metal: 13 Of The Genre’s Defining Bands\n\nWe here at Loaded Radio have been tabulating your votes for who you, the metal fan, think are the top band(s) of this extreme genre.\n\nWe have done all the tabulation through on-site voting, incoming emails and on-air requests, so we would like to personally thank every one of you who took the time to vote.\n\nYou can find the results below.\n\nNumber 13 – DYING FETUS\n\nFormed in 1991 in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, DYING FETUS emerged as a formidable force in the death metal scene.\n\nFounded by guitarist/vocalist John Gallagher, guitarist Nick Speleos, and drummer Jason Netherton, DYING FETUS initially aimed to create music that defied the conventions of traditional, yet brutal metal.

This group is absolutely revered as one of the best extreme metal bands in music today. And rightfully so.\n\nInitially formed in 1988 by vocalist Frank Mullen, guitarists Guy Marchais and Todd German and bassist Josh Barohn (none of whom remain with the group today, with the departure of Mullen in 2019), SUFFOCATION endures due to longtime shredder Terrance Hobbs (who joined the fold in 1991).\n\nSUFFOCATION have released 8 studio albums to date, and continue to be a relentless attack of sheer, brutal metal with hints of grindcore, death doom and deathcore elements.\n\nIf you’re looking for some straight-up, good ol’ American brutality coupled with extreme guttural vocals, we would, without question, suggest a healthy order of SUFFOCATION.\n\nNumber 4 – POSSESSED\n\nHailing from San Francisco, California, POSSESSED is often hailed as one of the earliest and most influential bands in the extreme metal genre.\n\nThe roots of the band trace back to 1983 in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Mike Torrao (guitar) and Mike Sus (drums) formed a garage band called POSSESSED alongside vocalist Barry Fisk and former EXODUS bassist Jeff Andrews. As the quartet began creating music, tragedy struck when Fisk took his own life by gunshot in front of his girlfriend’s house in Tara Hills, California. In the aftermath, Jeff Andrews chose not to continue with the group.\n\nSimultaneously, Jeff Becerra, a bassist and vocalist, found himself separated from his band BLIZZARD in the nearby city of Pinole. BLIZZARD, featuring Larry LaLonde and Danny Boland on guitars and Michael Miner on drums, all shared the same graduating class from Pinole Valley High School. Torrao and Sus, seeking to rebuild POSSESSED, approached Becerra to take on both the vocal and bassist roles. The band placed an advertisement for a new guitarist, which led to Brian Montana joining, marking the second incarnation of POSSESSED.\n\nPOSSESSED‘s groundbreaking debut album, “Seven Churches” (1985), solidified their status as pioneers of extreme metal. The album featured a blend of thrash metal aggression with occult and Satanic themes, setting the stage for the emerging metal movement. Notably, “Seven Churches” showcased Jeff Becerra‘s distinctive guttural growls, a vocal style that would become a defining characteristic of the genre.\n\nDespite their significant impact on the genre, POSSESSED faced challenges, including lineup changes and a temporary hiatus. Nevertheless, their legacy endured, and they returned with “Beyond the Gates” (1986) and “The Eyes of Horror” (1987), influencing countless bands and contributing to the development of extreme metal.\n\nNumber 3 – MORBID ANGEL\n\nHailing from Tampa, Florida, MORBID ANGEL stands as one of the pioneering and influential bands in the extreme metal genre.\n\nFormed in 1983 by guitarist Trey Azagthoth, the band has undergone several lineup changes throughout its existence. After solidifying a stable lineup, MORBID ANGEL released their debut album, “Altars of Madness,” in 1989, which is widely regarded as a landmark in the metal scene. This album showcased their technical prowess, with intricate guitar work, intense drumming, and David Vincent‘s distinctive growling vocals. MORBID ANGEL‘s uncompromising and innovative approach to extreme metal helped set the standard for the genre’s brutal and complex sound.\n\nFollowing their debut success, MORBID ANGEL continued to shape the extreme metal landscape with albums like “Blessed Are the Sick” (1991), “Covenant” (1993), and “Domination” (1995). These releases further solidified the band’s reputation for pushing the boundaries of the genre, incorporating elements of industrial and avant-garde music.\n\nDespite internal changes in the band, including lineup shifts and the departure and return of key members, MORBID ANGEL‘s impact on heavy metal remained significant. Their influence can be heard in the work of countless bands that followed, with their technical prowess, dark atmospheres, and unrelenting brutality serving as inspiration for the evolving brutal metal genre.\n\nNumber 2 – CANNIBAL CORPSE\n\nCANNIBAL CORPSE is one of the most well-known extreme metal bands in the world, rightfully credited with helping to develop the genre as a whole.\n\nFormed in Buffalo, New York in 1988, the group have unleashed a total of 16 pulverizing studio albums to date.\n\nCANNIBAL CORPSE‘s form of metal is characterized by its fast tempos, technical abilities and brutal riffs, coupled with lyrics often dealing with death, violence, addiction, horror and insanity.\n\nSince their formation in 1988, CANNIBAL CORPSE have had a total of 15 different members. This high turnover rate is partially due to some artists going off to join other metal acts, or simply because they no longer fit into the collective of the technically sound group.\n\nMost notably, the switch from original CANNIBAL CORPSE vocalist Chris Barnes, who went on to form SIX FEET UNDER, to current frontman George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher, who would carry out the difficult task of replacing a singer and boosting the band’s success with his booming, guttural vocal attack.\n\nCANNIBAL CORPSE have the amount of talent and brutal creativity to produce some of the most revered extreme music out there. With releases like “Butchered at Birth” and “Torture“, they have set the standard for metal brutality, and they continue to push the envelope within the metal scene with each new release.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that will make your ears bleed, then look no further than CANNIBAL CORPSE. (We recommend starting out with the classic Barnes-era “Butchered at Birth“, but honestly anything they’ve released really works.)\n\nNumber 1 – DEATH\n\nHailing from the sunny state of Florida, DEATH, founded by the visionary Chuck Schuldiner in 1983, stands as one of the most influential and groundbreaking bands in the history of extreme metal.\n\nSchuldiner, often hailed as the “Godfather” of the era, initially formed the band under the name MANTAS, eventually evolving into DEATH. The band’s early releases, such as “Scream Bloody Gore” (1987) and “Leprosy” (1988), showcased a raw and ferocious sound that helped define the nascent genre.\n\nHowever, it was with subsequent releases like “Human” (1991) and “Individual Thought Patterns” (1993) that DEATH transcended the boundaries of conventional brutal metal, introducing intricate song structures, progressive elements, and virtuosic musicianship.\n\nDEATH‘s impact on the extreme metal genre goes far beyond their sonic innovations. Chuck Schuldiner‘s relentless pursuit of musical excellence and experimentation set a standard for aspiring musicians within the genre.\n\nAs the principal songwriter and driving force behind DEATH, Schuldiner continuously pushed the boundaries of metal, earning the band a reputation for both technical proficiency and artistic integrity.\n\nEven after Schuldiner‘s untimely death in 2001, DEATH‘s legacy endures, with their discography serving as a blueprint for the evolution of progressive extreme metal and inspiring countless bands across the spectrum.\n\nDEATH is the reason this list is here. Seriously though. Listen to “Scream Bloody Gore“. An awesome debut album for not just a band but a whole subgenre. Just pure, old-school death metal at it’s finest.\n\nFinal Words\n\nWhether it be melodic, technical, old school or some progressive metal band with crust punk and black metal elements whose second album just speaks to you in a way you just can’t and don’t feel like explaining to anyone, all it takes is one band or one song or one album to send a shiver down your spine and fill you with adrenaline to get you hooked to the beautiful brutality that is extreme metal.\n\nSome other notable bands who we did want to mention who came very close to being on this list via your votes are BOLT THROWER, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, MALEVOLENT CREATION, DARK TRANQUILLITY, DEAD CONGREGATION, MISERY INDEX, BLOOD INCANTATION and many more.\n\nThe bands on this list are some of the best this type of music has to offer, and they represent everything that extreme metal stands for: brutality, creativity, technical ability, and pure savagery.\n\nEven today’s metal bands like OUTER HEAVEN, TOMB MOLD, RIVERS OF NIHIL and others are crushing ravenous crowds every night, pummeling them into oblivion with their raw and aggressive sound."
