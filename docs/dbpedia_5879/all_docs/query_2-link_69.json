        "text": "I am a different type of MxPx fan. “Die hard” MxPx fans live and die by a trio of their 90’s albums that I call, “the big three:” Life In General, Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo and The Ever Passing Moment. Sure, that’s how I was first introduced to the band – the first MxPx song I loved is “Under Lock and Key” from Buffalo – but my true love for the band began at 2003’s divisive, major-label-debut, Before Everything & After. It all began with a Super Bowl ad.\n\nLike many Americans, I was watching the 2003 Super Bowl, when all of a sudden I had a realization: wait, isn’t that the “Chick Magnet” band?! Holy s**t, they’re on the Super Bowl! (And further research for this piece would have me saying: Holy s**t, that’s Scotty aka “Scotty Doesn’t Know” from EuroTrip!) I would later find that the song in question was “Well Adjusted,” from Before Everything & After. After seeing them play a radio festival in Richmond, VA shortly after its release later that year, once I got my hands on the album, I was hooked. This would be the first MxPx song that I became truly obsessed with, so much so that I mandated my first high school band to make it our first cover song. Not able to take this album out of my regular rotation, I would go on to see the band again a few months later, headlining with Simple Plan and Sugarcult (an absolutely bonkers bill in hindsight).\n\nBut for whatever reason, looking forward with MxPx carried much greater weight than looking back. However long people can go on about “Middlename” or “Move To Bremerton,” even though I wore out 2002’s best-of compilation Ten Years and Running, one of my favorite MxPx songs is “Bass So Low” from 2007’s Secret Weapon. I never had At The Show or Let It Happen, I bought B-Movie and Both Ends Burning. I couldn’t tell you much about Teenage Politics, but I can tell you that “When It Comes To You” has my all time favorite MxPx bridge, “Brokenhearted” contains one of my favorite Mike Herrera bass licks, Panic‘s “The Story” gets me fired up like no other, and the only other MxPx song I made my high school band cover was “Heard That Sound.”\n\n“Party, My House, Be There,” “Do Your Feet Hurt?” and “Unsaid” never quite did it for me like “The Empire,” “The Capitol” or “Wrecking Hotel Rooms.” Hell, I have had Before Everything & After‘s “It’s Alright” and Secret Weapon‘s “Sad Sad Song” as staples on my BBQ playlist for many years. Now don’t get me wrong, “the big three” are “the big three” for a reason. “My Life Story,” “Invitation To Understanding,” “Chick Magnet,” “Tomorrow’s Another Day,” “The Next Big Thing” and, of course, “Responsibility” – even older gems like “Teenage Politics” and eternal set-closer “Punk Rock Show” – are MxPx classics etched in stone. However, as I get older, I suppose it is only natural that I appreciate the continuing maturity of Mike Herrera’s songwriting more and more with each record. And with songs like “Aces Up” and “Nothing Left” from 2012’s Plans Within Plans, and now “Life Goals” and “Let’s Ride” off of their fantastic new self-titled album, I have found that growth actually suits punk rock very well.\n\nMusical growth is an integral part of any artist’s career. While some are content making essentially the same record over and over – AC/DC, The Ramones, New Found Glory, Reel Big Fish, most top-40 country – some choose to evolve and to grow as they themselves grow up, even at the risk of losing that youthful abandon that their audience fell in love with in the first place. But what happens when you are a band like MxPx who are known for a very specific sound? They were never going to go “radio” like Fall Out Boy, make a baroque-Beatles record like Panic! At The Disco or turn metal like Sum 41. So what can artists who find themselves in these types of artistic boxes do? You can certainly make deviations and make little leaps across the confined ends of the box, taking bits and pieces of past albums’ aesthetics with you in the process, but breaking the walls down and ripping up the playbook on an ambitious new sound that will likely alienate your core fanbase is a risky and potentially catastrophic proposition. A few months back, I started a Twitter conversation with Mike Herrera himself when talking about Plans Within Plans and he touched on this very subject, on which I weighed in:\n\nTheir new album, however, is unapologetically classic MxPx. On opener “Rolling Strong,” the band sound more energized than they have in 20 years and Mike Herrera attributes that to the band’s recent embracement of their independence in recent years, taking full control of their career, only playing when they feel like it and not having the band be an all-consuming monster, building resentment. The band are having fun again and it shows from front-to-back on the new album. As I have felt increasingly with each of their last several releases, this album is perfect for any casual fan of MxPx, or just punk rock in general, that maybe feels like they have moved past that part of their life. This is punk rock by adults for adults and I feel it to be the perfect gateway for fans that may have tuned out in the early 2000’s."
