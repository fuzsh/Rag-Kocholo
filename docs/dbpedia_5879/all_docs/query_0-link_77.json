        "text": "Following on from my post about new releases from newly discovered artists, there have also been releases from bands that have been around for decades (and more).\n\nThese are bands I listened to in the early 2000s and are still (somehow!) releasing new music. Here are a few albums and EPs that have been released this year and have made me revisit their older albums too. I still need to listen to these albums a bit more, as I have been focused on albums from newer artists.\n\nSkate Punk\n\nThere were a few releases from skate-punk bands that I have fond memories of from my youth.\n\nGets Old by Diesel Boy\n\nWhile we′ve been away\n\nThree presidents have been sworn\n\nFive kiddos got born\n\nWith two sets of twins\n\nAnd all of 'em boys\n\nCall us Diesel Dads\n\nIt has been over twenty years since Diesel Boy released an album, but Gets Old continues exactly where they left off. It was great to have new music featuring the blend of fast songs and the raspy and raw voice of Dave Lake. The lyrics are relatable for us who have grown up, just like the band, with kids and dirty dishes! Distorted Sound has a nice review.\n\nReleased: 28th July 2023\n\nTracks: 12\n\nLength: 32 minutes\n\nLabel: SBÄM Records\n\nTen Stories High by The Bouncing Souls\n\nI remember hearing Kate Is Great back in the days of Napster and their album Hopeless Romantic is skate-punk perfection. They've continued to make music throughout the years, but I haven't followed them that closely. Now The Bouncing Souls are back with their twelfth studio album Ten Stories High. I need to listen to the album a lot more for a decent review, but there is one on Distorted Sound. Nobody Asked Your Opinion has also ranked all The Bouncing Souls albums (paywalled).\n\nReleased: 24th March 2023\n\nTracks: 10\n\nLength: 26 minutes\n\nLabel: Pure Noise Records\n\nTomorrow Never Comes by Rancid\n\nTomorrow Never Comes is the tenth full-length album by punk legends Rancid. The Californian band has been at the top of the punk community for decades and their 1995 release ...And Out Come the Wolves is an absolute classic. It has been six years since their last album, but I haven't followed them closely since the early 2000s. Reviews have been mixed, but I will certainly make time to listen to this album in the future. Nobody Asked Your Opinion has also ranked all Rancid albums (paywalled).\n\nReleased: 2nd June 2023\n\nTracks: 16\n\nLength: 29 minutes\n\nLabel: Epitaph Records\n\nThe Cup Of Pestilence by Frenzal Rhomb\n\nThis is the tenth album from Australian punk-rockers Frenzal Rhomb. The Cup Of Pestilence. Their 1997 release Meet the Family and A Man’s Not A Camel from 1999 are both favourite albums. I saw the band play a few times in the early 2000s, but haven't kept up with their career much since. If I need a hit of fast-paced punk-rock, then I'll have to remember to check out their latest releases. Nobody Asked Your Opinion has also ranked all 10 Frenzal Rhomb albums (paywalled).\n\nReleased: 7th April 2023\n\nTracks: 19\n\nLength: 33 minutes\n\nLabel: Fat Wreck Chords\n\nConcept Album by Dwarves\n\nI was exposed to Dwarves after their song Everybodies Girl appeared as the second track on the Punk-o-Rama volume 3 compilation album from 1998. Their 1997 album, The Dwarves Are Young and Good Looking, which also features the track, is the only album that has stuck with me. They have released countless albums since then, so I have a lot to listen to. Hardbeat has a review of the album;\n\nIf someone said ‘this album is a 70s punk album made in 2023’ then this is what you would expect for sure. No, it’s not as musically filthy as it would have been decades ago. Recording has come on a long way since then. No, it’s not as venomous and politically enraged as it would have been decades ago. The people making this album have grown up a fair bit since then. What it is though is a high quality and fun release from a band with more experience per member than most bands gain in their whole career.\n\nReleased: 17 November 2023\n\nTracks: 20\n\nLength: 37 minutes\n\nLabel: Greedy Media\n\nPop-Punk Releases\n\nThere are some pop-punk bands from the 2000s that are still going strong.\n\nFind A Way Home by MxPx\n\nFind A Way Home is band MxPx's fourteenth(!) full-length album and their first in over five years. With his unique vocals, Mike Herrera has led the band since 1992 and each album over the thirty years features some stand-out songs. Stay Up All Night is that track on this latest release. Nobody Asked Your Opinion has ranked MxPx albums (paywalled).\n\nReleased: 25 August 2023\n\nTracks: 13\n\nLength: 34 minutes\n\nSo Much (for) Stardust by Fall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy has changed their sound a lot from their raw beginnings. Their eighth full release So Much (for) Stardust continues that trend.\n\nNothing will compare with their debut album Take This to Your Grave or even their follow-up From Under the Cork Tree. After this, they started to experiment more with their sound, incorporating more pop sensibilities. They continued to be successful and I enjoy some of their catchy singles but haven't listened to their albums in full. Like most albums on this list, I will need to listen to this more in the future.\n\nReleased: 24th March 2023\n\nTracks: 13\n\nLength: 45 minutes\n\nLabel: Fueled by Ramen\n\nDon’t Mind If We Do by Bowling for Soup\n\nPop-punk royalty Bowling for Soup released a covers album called Don’t Mind If We Do. The band have churned out many different releases over the years, including an acoustic album recorded in a church and compilation albums, but they haven't quite captured the magic and fun of Let’s Do It For Johnny or Drunk Enough to Dance. There are covers of rock bands and pop artists. There is a review in New Noise Magazine.\n\nReleased: 4th April 2023\n\nTracks: 10\n\nLength: 33 minutes\n\nLabel: Brando Records\n\nONE MORE TIME... by blink-182\n\nBlink-182 released ONE MORE TIME..., an album featuring their original line-up; after two albums with Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba, Tom DeLonge is back in the band. There was much hype around the return of Tom and their worldwide tour to support the album.\n\nFor me, nothing quite matches their 1999 album Enema of the State or the follow-up Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, both of which have their sound suit their immature lyrics. There was a gap of nine years after their self-titled and twenty years until this release. There are plenty of fun songs here that are easy to listen to and I need to spend more time with their newer releases.\n\nReleased: 30th October 2023\n\nTracks: 17\n\nLength: 45 minutes\n\nLabel: Columbia Records\n\nSka-Punk Releases\n\nThere haven't been many releases by original third-wave ska-punk bands. Reel Big Fish have been dormant since 2018. Less Than Jake released an album in 2020 – after a seven-year gap – but continues to tour. I did see Voodoo Glow Skulls play in August.\n\nWhere Did All My Friends Go? by Mustard Plug\n\nMustard Plug released Where Did All My Friends Go?, their eighth full album (excluding compilations) after a gap of nine years. This was the only notable album from a 2000-era ska-punk band. It still captures the fun sound of the genre. I will definitely spend more time with this album in the future. Nobody Asked Your Opinion has also ranked all Mustard Plug albums (paywalled).\n\nReleased: 8th September 2023\n\nTracks: 13\n\nLength: 42 minutes\n\nLabel: Bad Time Records\n\nOther Releases\n\nThere were also albums by two other bands I wanted to mention.\n\nHistory Books by The Gaslight Anthem\n\nThe 2009 album The ’59 Sound by Gaslight Anthem is a favourite of mine, but I haven't kept up with the band since their 2012 album Handwritten (Deluxe Version). They released an album in 2014, but this is the first since then as singer Brian Fallon delved into a solo career. This was an anticipated release online, so I will need to give this more of a listen in the new year. Read a review on Louder.\n\nReleased: 27th October 2023\n\nTracks: 10\n\nLength: 40 minutes\n\nLabel: Thirty Tigers\n\n152 by Taking Back Sunday\n\nTaking Back Sunday was top of the emo scene in the early 2000 with Tell All Your Friends becoming a massive hit, although Louder Now was the album that resonated with me the most. This is the band's eighth full-length album and their first since Tidal Wave in 2016. Only released in October, I need to listen to this more when I want a heavier sound.\n\nReleased: 27th October 2023\n\nTracks: 10\n\nLength: 31 minutes\n\nLabel: Fantasy Records\n\nEP Releases\n\nAs well as full-length albums, there were a few EP releases.\n\nChildhood Eyes by Yellowcard\n\nThis was a surprise release after Yellowcard's eponymous tenth studio album in 2016 and subsequent announcement of the band's break-up. It is great to hear the violin-infused pop-punk sound again and it makes a nice addition to their discography. The titular track Childhood Eyes is my favourite song on the EP.\n\nReleased: 21st July 2023\n\nTracks: 5\n\nLength: 18 minutes\n\nLabel: Rude Records\n\nMake the Most of It by New Found Glory\n\nNew Found Glory has been a power-pop-punk favourite for decades. Their energy is infectious and have lyrics to belt out. Excluding the live tracks, this EP is full of new songs that are all acoustic. It's a nice change of pace and the song Watch the Lilies Grow is my favourite.\n\nReleased: 20th January 2023\n\nTracks: 7 + 7 live tracks\n\nLength: 57 minutes\n\nLabel: Revelation Records\n\nWe’re Too Old To Write New Songs, So Here’s Some Old Songs We Didn’t Write by Midtown\n\nMidtown is probably the least well-known band on the list, but Save The World Lose The Girl and Living Well Is the Best Revenge from 2000 and 2002 respectively are some of the best pop-punk albums from the era. They disbanded in 2005 – with the leader singer forming the dance-rock band Cobra Starship – so this release was quite a surprise and as you can probably guess, the songs on this EP are all covers!"
