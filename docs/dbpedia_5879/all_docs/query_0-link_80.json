        "text": "Welcome to “Ska, Punk, and Other Junk!” With this monthly column, I’ll highlight all of the cool things I discovered in the ska and punk scenes each month. I listen to more than just those two genres. I highlight some other junk I discovered along the way too! (NOTE: Not actually junk. I just wanted to go with the rhyme). There’s so much cool music out there these days. This is my attempt to cover as much of it as possible.\n\nHopefully, you find your new favorite band – or at least some cool new tunes to enjoy.\n\nOne thing I like most about the summer months is that a lot of bands hit the road and start playing shows more frequently. That’s perfect for a live music fanatic like myself. It also typically means those bands start putting out new music to coincide with their tours. It’s no fun going to a show and not knowing the words to the band’s new songs.\n\nIn that spirit, here’s a list of my favorite releases from the month of June 2024. You should learn the lyrics to these songs as a kickoff to the beginning of your summer.\n\nSka\n\nBandits – 3\n\nFormed in Castellon de la Plana in 2008, Bandits are going to turn some heads and move some feet with 3. Split almost evenly between instrumentals and songs with vocals, this album is just pure joy. While the music sticks with a strong core of traditional ska rhythms, Bandits also veer into the world of rocksteady, reggae, jazz, and big band.\n\nThough each song is inherently a dance song, the album’s opener “Sinyora,” spends most of its time being more subdued and jazz-forward. It eases you into the 40-minute sweat-fest that follows, if you dance with your friends while listening. Trust me, it’s hard to avoid. There’s a lot of infection talent here to enjoy, especially if you take your ska on the more traditional side. Also, Bandit has a killer cover of “Work Song” on the album!\n\nJoe Gittleman – Hold Up\n\nJoe Gittleman has an aura of effortless cool. He’s such an engaging and talented musician and performer. Like a moth to a flame, I’m immediately engrossed and drawn into what he’s doing. That’s one of the reasons I was so bummed when the BossTones called it quits, because I wasn’t sure what that meant for members like Gittleman.\n\nThankfully, Joe worked on some solo music and then joined the Wavebreaker series on Bad Time Records. I thought that was it though, especially with the formation of The Kilograms with Sammy Kay, but I was wrong. Not only did we get the debut EP from The Kilograms this year, but Gittleman released a full-length, too.\n\nIt’s easy to say that fans of the BossTones will love Gittleman’s solo album. It feels like a natural progression from the music he created with the members of that band. Songs like “Plastered in the Rafters” feel like they would fit right in with an album like Pay Attention. That familiar sound really serves as the gateway drug to what Joe Gittleman can really offer as a solo artist.\n\nJoe Gittleman’s solo album is to the BossTones like Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros are to The Clash. There’s a familiarity there, but in many ways, the solo project is superior to the more well-known band. In Gittleman’s case, there’s a full, robust sound to each song. Lyrically, he’s focusing more on telling stories than he is creating anthems. The music requires you to give it more than a casual listen. Sure, it sounds great while driving in the car or in the background, but Hold Up really shines though with active listening. The wordplay and intelligent songwriting throughout is an absolute joy, especially when you discover some extra nuance you didn’t catch on your previous listen.\n\nThe Pietasters – “Glimmer”\n\nIn my humble opinion, The Pietasters are essential listening for anyone who calls themselves a ska fan. To date, they still slip through my grasp when I try to see them live, so new singles like “Glimmer” are all I’ve got until this DC mainstay comes back to Michigan.\n\nWhile “Glitter” is a new recording for The Pietasters, it isn’t a new song per se. Originally written by Joe Gittleman of Mighty Mighty BossTones fame, lead singer Steve Jackson takes control and makes it his own. As a fun twist, Joe’s version of “Glimmer” also appears on the new Gittleman full-length that we talked about earlier in this column. It’s pretty cool to already have different interpretations of an amazing song.\n\nThe Rins – The Heavy Heart\n\nFronted by Erin MacKenzie from The Doped Up Dollies, The Rins are a brand new ska band from the Boston region. Not content to sticking with a traditional ska sound, The Rins seamlessly blend ska music with punk, reggae, surf rock, doo-wop, rockabilly, and roots rock. Even with so many different influences and sounds, none of the tracks on The Heavy Heart feel bloated or forced. Everything is tight, well-produced, and a joy to listen to. In fact, I put The Rins in the same company as bands like The Pilfers and Flying Raccoon Suit in terms of moving the genre forward with their innovation. Current favorites on the album for me right now include “Chicken,” “Put it All on Red,” and “Break My Heart.”\n\nThe Ska Flakes – I Do It Every Day\n\nOne thing I’ve learned this year while trying to expand my listening habits over the North American borders is that France has an amazing ska scene. While I’ve discovered a lot of cool bands from around the world this year, if I were to have only discovered the French ska scene, I would still call my quest a victory.\n\nThe latest discovery for me is The Ska Flakes from Le Havre. They stick to a more traditional interpretation of ska music, filled with heavy doses of trad ska, early reggae, rocksteady, and dub. Every song on I Do It Every Day is a certified dance hit. From the dub heavy “Boots” to “Bullshit,” which borrows a melody from the Musical Youth hit “Pass the Dutchie,” you won’t stop moving while you have this album.\n\nThe respect and love this band has for early Jamaican music is clearly evident from track to track. That care adds to the quality of the songs on this album. Also, if you’re a Johnny Cash fan, there’s a special treat for you at the end of the album. I think The Man in Black would be proud.\n\nPunk\n\nFour Black Lungs – Don’t Tell Me There Is Nothing Left\n\nA melodic punk band from Munich, Germany, Four Black Lungs reminds me of Hot Water Music meets The Menzingers. They have the melodic aggression you hear from Chuck Ragan with the musical intricacies of The Menzingers. Vocally, the lyrics are sung in that gruff, orgcore style, while the heavy guitars feature a juxtaposition between huge riffs and delicate pick work. It’s really cool to hear both styles complement each other so well.\n\nGood Views Bad News – S/T\n\nWhat are the odds of reviewing two German punk bands with heavy orgcore influences in one column? Normally, I’d pick one and just write about the one I liked better, but when I tried to pick between Good Views Bad News and Four Black Lunch, I couldn’t. Good Views Bad News have a bit more aggression and urgency with the songs on their debut EP. Songs like “Exhale/Exhausted” have fast-paced, melodic guitar riffs that suddenly shift into Midwest emo. It’s a cool transition to hear and keeps the audience on their toes.\n\nClocking in at just under 12 minutes, this project is a wonderful introduction to a band that has so much potential. The music acknowledges that things aren’t exactly perfect these days. But instead of running away, Good Views Bad News has chosen to stand and fight, and they’ve invited us along for the ride. It’s not how bad things are, but how you persevere and thrive. This is going to be a band to watch. Might as well get in on the ground floor!\n\nKawaii AF – Congratulations, You’re Not a Sociopath!\n\nThis NOLA three-piece punk band epitomize the 2000’s punk and emo scene. Their music is chock full of anime, comic book, and teenage angst. The lyrics have a certain whiny, bratty snarl to them reminiscent of Mike Herrera from MxPx. While I enjoy the more pop-culture leaning tracks on the album, Kawaii AF shines when they perform from the heart.\n\nTo me, the album’s standout is “Angry, Angsty, and Full of Acne.” It truly encapsulates the feelings teenager have when their parents have fallen out of love and things don’t go the way they want. But not every song is as serious as that track, as there are plenty of tunes about comic books and anime. “Ivy X Harley” tells the love story between Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. “Notice Me Senpai” takes the idea of the senpai and transfers it to the school setting.\n\nNow that I’m in my 40s, the topics touched on in the songs here don’t necessarily hit the same as they would have if I was hearing these songs when I was a teen or early 20. That’s okay though because I’m young at heart, and Kawaii AF is a tremendously talented young punk band. They’re carrying the 2000’s pop punk and emo sound into the future and doing one hell of a job.\n\nLeonardo DiVorcio – S/T\n\nThis might be my favorite discovery of the month. Leonardo DiVorcio is punk, emo, folk-punk, ska, noise, and absolutely awesome. The sense of chaotic energy exuding from every track on this album makes it an adventure for your ears. Honestly, this self-titled album is an absolute joy and refreshing voice in the punk scene today. Musically, I’m reminded of bands like Dollar Signs, Pup, and AJJ, the band gives us a cover of Bomb the Music Industry!’s “Stand There Until You’re Sober.” You owe it to yourself to give this album a spin.\n\nMest – Youth\n\nI’ve been listening to Mest since the Wasting Time days. So whenever the band releases a new album, it brings back lots of fond memories of seeing them play live throughout my early 20s. Thinking about those days seems even more fitting with Youth. Mest might look a bit different these days, but Tony Lovato keeps the spirit and the passion of his band alive, even with member changes throughout the years.\n\nThis is the best the band has sounded in years, as a sense of rejuvenation fuels each track. The album starts with “When We Were Young,” a pop-punk anthem that sounds like vintage Mest. Not only does Bowling For Soup’s Jaret Reddick provide guest vocals, but it’s a tone-setter for the rest of the album. If you’re a fan of Mest, you owe it to yourself to give this one a spin, and if you’re new to the group, this is a great introduction.\n\nRad Owl – Rage Gracefully\n\nWhen I go to a show in my 40s, I always enter the venue with the best intentions: “I’m going to show those young kids what it was like back in the days.” However, intentions and reality are sometimes not the same., especially the next morning as I pop a couple of Tylenol and hope the aches and pains go away quickly. Thus, I might be the target demographic for Rad Owl’s new album, Rage Gracefully. I know I’m older, but it’s hard for me to act my age. If these guys can still rage and put out high intensity melodic skate punk, than I can still get in the pit, dammit.\n\nIf I were to put Rad Owl in a box, I’d say they sound like Millencolin by way of Propagandhi, Descendents, and Iron Maiden. That’s right – some of the riffs that feel like they could’ve been played by Dave Murray himself. There’s a certain heft to the guitar tone on this album, and it absolutely shreds. It also helps that the production work throughout Rage Gracefully is second to none. Lots of gems on the album, including “Run it Out,” challenge you to push forward, no matter how hard things have become or how frustrated you feel. To be honest, everything sounds so powerful. I guess raging gracefully isn’t so bad after all.\n\nSmokers – The Rat That Gnawed The Rope\n\nWhen “The Irish Tenor” kicks things off on the Smokers’ debut album, the Hammond organ gives me Blue Oyster Cult, but punk, vibes. It’s melodic, slightly ethereal, and driving, adding a different vibe that makes for a cool listening experience. That’s not to say “The Irish Tenor” is the only good track. Far from it.\n\nThe Rat That Gnawed The Rope is a love letter to old-school ’60s and ’70s garage rock and punk. This Oakland band fits right in with the likes of The Dead Milkmen, The Replacements, Stiff Little Fingers, The Stooges, and Minutemen. Even with those classic influences, Smokers feel fresh, new, and incredibly solid. They’re a band on the rise and one to keep your eye on, especially if you love that driving, guitar-heavy punk rock sound.\n\nSunday Morning – Forget Me Nots\n\nMelodic hardcore punk with a message is what you’ll get when you turn on Forget Me Nots from Sunday Morning. Hailing from New Haven, CT, the band creates intense melodic hardcore with heavy riffs, pounding drums, and thoughtful lyrics. It should translate extremely well in the live setting, too. I can even visualize the experience.\n\nThe core of the EP rests in the one-two punch of “Forget Me Nots” and “Agonize.” The title track focuses on friendships and relationships that can be extremely important one day and gone the next. “Agonize” then covers the experience of not having anyone to talk to, even though you’ve got a lot to share.\n\nThere’s an inherent sense of loneliness with that line of thinking, and you can hear the pain and agony within the strained vocals. While those lyrics are likely relatable to all of us, the good news is that, when you go to a show, you’re surrounded by your chosen music family. So, go see Sunday Morning when they come to your town and let out a cathartic scream to these choruses.\n\nThe Story So Far – I Want To Disappear\n\nThis is a masterclass in creating a high-energy pop-punk album with lots of heart. From the jump, The Story So Far’s I Want To Disappear hits you with the feels. “All This Time” has lead singer Parker Cannon opening up about the death of his father. It’s a song about love, loss, and learning how to process and persevere, making it a perfect opener for a record with heavy themes.\n\nWhen I think about bands who blend emotion with fast-paced pop punk, bands like The Ataris and New Found Glory come to mind. Well, I’m adding The Story So Far to that list. I enjoyed I Want to Disappear on two levels – high-energy punk and emotional lyrics. It isn’t uptempo all the time though. The album ends with two stripped-down, emotional songs in “White Shores” and the title track. They’re both absolutely beautiful tunes that really show off the band’s technical skills.\n\nOther Junk\n\nBrendan Miller (featuring Jon Snodgrass) – “Gratitude”\n\nI first learned about Brendan Miller during COVID times with his release on One Week Records. His latest single features Jon Snodgrass of Scorpios and Drag The River fame. It’s a beautifully composed duet with soulful melodies, acoustic guitars, and string accompaniment. “Gratitude” tows the line between folk, country, and singer-songwriter. Equal parts melancholy and optimistic, I even felt like Brendan was channeling Tony Sly’s solo work.\n\nMiller and Snodgrass sound absolutely amazing together. I’m really hoping this leads to more collaborations between them, because they just sound so natural together. It’s almost like they’ve been a duo for ages. Maybe it’s time to get Scorpios back together and add Brendan into the mix?\n\nCarly Cosgrove – The Cleanest of Houses Are Empty\n\nWhen the album’s title is sang as one of the verses in “Here’s a Fork,” it’s clearly a song of love, loss, and attempted reunion. While going through the emotions of a break up, there still lingers a definite desire to give it one more shot. “This house is no good empty” lead singer Lucas Naylor pleads. Will they get back together? We’ll see.\n\nI really appreciate the perspective Carly Cosgrove has on life and relationships. While it’s easy to paint them as an emo band, there’s really so much more to them. At times, they’ve got the precision of a math rock band. Other times, they’ve got a catchy pop-punk feel. No matter how you want to label them, Carly Cosgrove is a power trio consisting of three amazingly talented musicians, both lyrically and sonically.\n\nThe songs on The Cleanest of Houses Are Empty are immediately relatable. “Zoloft” says that the reasons you need the medicine will always exist from within. It also makes it hard for you to face your reality. “Fluff My Pillow” gives me “The Future Freaks Me Out” vibes. On an album of gems, it’s probably my favorite song.\n\nEichlers – IKE WORLD\n\nEmo trap. Hyper pop. Hyper ska. Maybe Hyper punk? Honestly, at this point, whenever I’m listening to Ike’s music and someone asked me to define it, I’m just going to reply with Eichlers. Ike Wood has transcended genre at this point and is in a class by himself. Whe I imagine a time in the not-so-distant future where we start to hear musicians inspired by Eichlers, that will be honestly so sick. I can’t wait to be surrounded by an army of auto-tuned punk rock, emo, ska, and pop music. It’s going to be so fun and infectious.\n\nIke’s followup to My Checkered Future is IKE WORLD, and that’s a perfect name for the album because it encompasses everything I’ve come to love about Eichlers. Not only is he a talented musician, but he cares about the scene and how safe it is for everyone. “No Good Dudes” calls out toxic behavior and serves as a call for true reform within the community.\n\nOne of my favorite songs on the album is “DAMN RIP.” Ike tackles his impostor syndrome and insecurities head on, battling it with positive thoughts about his music and life. We all have intrusive thoughts from time to time, so it’s refreshing to have access to such a catchy song that also doubles as a bit of self-help advice.\n\nAs you listen to the album further, you realize how much of it is Eichlers being real with himself and ripping off the band-aid for everyone to see the hurt. The juxtaposition between the messages in the songs and the upbeat happiness of the actual music makes you pay more attention to what Ike is saying. I’m glad that he trusts his audience to create such an honest album. It’s going to be more impactful than he’ll ever expect it to be.\n\nJason DeVore – ‘Til the Voice Goes Out\n\nWhen a band has been around for as long as Authority Zero has been, fans start to have a certain expectation for the music you release. When you experiment a bit or veer from the formula, you run the risk of alienating a portion of your fanbase. Sometimes, you just need to express yourself in a different way that doesn’t quite fit the mold.\n\nEnter solo projects! Authority Zero front man Jason DeVore has been creating solo music for some time now, and his latest effort, ‘Til the Voice Comes Out, is his best to date. It’s a celebration of the weathering the lows of life and being triumphant over them.\n\nNot only does this feel like the most vulnerable DeVore has been on an album, but it’s also his most diverse. Along with the reggae and ska-infused punk his band is known for, you’ll hear everything from mariachi to rock to gospel. The horn arrangements are also extremely varied, even veering into improv jazz solos. This album is a kaleidoscopic treat for diverse musical experiences. It doesn’t feel disjointed at all. Instead, it feels like you’re listening to an audiobook of the next chapter of DeVore’s life.\n\nIt’s filled with inspiration from a man who has seen some dark things, got sober, and came out the other side a better person. Hell, if you’re ever feeling down or need a jump start, just listen to the title track. This rousing folk-punk number made me ready to run through walls to achieve my dreams and live my life.\n\nThe Used – Medz\n\nTo be completely honest, I’m always weary when bands release B-sides albums or leftover collections. If they weren’t good enough for the album, then why would we want to hear them? I see them as nothing more than a cash grab to sucker their biggest fans out of some more money.\n\nSo, I was pretty wary about Medz when I heard about it. Well, after listening to it a few times, I can honestly say The Used have set a new standard for B-sides collections. Nothing here sounds phoned in at all. It’s ten tracks that have every right to be on Toxic Positivity.\n\nMedz starts with the title track. It’s a driving, anthemic alternative punk touching on the struggles between life’s expectations and your ability to live up to those expectations. This raw, powerful tune will inevitably become a fan favorite in a live setting.\n\nOther highlights include “Fuck You,” a song that touches on the aftermath of an ended relationship. “People Are Vomit” is pretty self-explanatory. High energy, angry, and loud, it’s a commentary on how society has ended up lately. Sometimes, reality isn’t pretty, and it takes someone like The Used to put a mirror up to society and help us see what we’ve done. “Depression Personified” boils the feeling and desperation of severe depression and how it feels to have depression “coming after” you.\n\nJust like Toxic Positivity forced me to rethink my opinions of The Used, MEDZ has me rethinking the value of B-side collections. Two albums in two years that I really liked after never really listening to The Used before. Did I just become a fan?\n\nWolfWolf – Totentanz\n\nWolfWolf is a noise/garage rock duo from Lucerne, Switzerland. Listening to them reminds me of Tom Waits by way of Queens of the Stone Age and The White Stripes. The spookiness in their music reminds me of The Cramps and Murder By Death. It’s pretty impressive for two people to be talented enough to make music so layered that it evokes feelings from some of the heavyweights listed above. The duo’s sound is so big and so engaging that it demands your attention.\n\nTake the song “Lost” for instance. It starts off innocently enough, but you slowly sense the tension building as the tempo picks up. Then, before you know it, they let out a grunt and break out into a guitar solo and machine gun drumming that would make Metallica blush. It’s jarring when you hear it, but if you’re like me, the way you listened to the song changed. WolfWolf keeps you on your toes throughout the 13 tracks on Totentanz. This is a wild ride, so hang on tight because this Swiss rock band shows no mercy.\n\nIf you want me to listen to your ska, punk, or other junk, please feel free to contact me here.
