While still in high school, he joined up with guitarist Tom Wisniewski and singer/bassist Mike Herrera, with whom he shared an affinity for California skate punk and Christianity. They released their debut album, Pokinatcha, on Tooth & Nail Records in 1994. Since then, MxPx has put out six more full-length albums, four EPs, three compilations, a live record, and two collections of covers. During the covid pandemic MxPx released a deluxe version of their self titled album as well as an acoustic album called Live In Quarantine.\n\nFor more info on Yuri and MxPx please visit: www.mxpx.com or follow @yurizaneruley\n\nTo support the Drum Brigade, please visit our Patreon at: https://www.patreon.com/drumbrigade\n\nFor Drum Brigade merchandise please visit: https://teespring.com/stores/drum-brigade\n\nFor more info about Korey visit: www.koreykingston.com\n\nFor more info about Funky Phil visit: www.philpardell.com\n\nwww.drumbrigade.com"
