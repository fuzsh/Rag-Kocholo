        "text": "This year was a strange one for living, much less listening. Even among the Pitchfork staff, we struggled to find meaningful stopgaps for live shows, to absorb new songs at the same speed without the routines of everyday life, and to feel the in-person catharsis that music can offer. But clearly, we kept listening—just in modified ways. In trying to make sense of this insular year in music, we asked staffers to answer a series of questions about the songs and albums that comforted them, the loss of live music, and a handful of other topics related to the past and the future.\n\nWhat older music did you turn to for comfort this year?\n\nIsabelia Herrera, Contributing Editor: I spent the last four months of 2020 in my mother’s one-bedroom apartment in Chicago, taking care of her after a stroke threatened to take her life in September. As she started to regain her strength, I found myself returning to age-old boleros: Los Panchos, Toña La Negra, La Lupe. The latter’s beloved “Qué Te Pedí” stood out in particular one night, when we found ourselves belting the lyrics to each other across the living room after dinner, laughing and unable to match the aching beauty of La Lupe’s voice. The song itself is concentrated melancholia; La Lupe trembles with agony as she laments the end of a romance ravaged by love unreturned. But after months of grief and uncertainty, the song sounded like less of a requiem and more like a song of triumph for the woman who raised me.\n\nPhilip Sherburne, Contributing Editor: In researching my Sunday Review of his 1999 album Knock Knock, I reacquainted myself with the whole three-decade expanse of Bill Callahan’s back catalog. For much of the spring and summer, I rose at dawn to take walks through the countryside bordering the subdivision where I live, Callahan’s music in my ears. I ingested his records at the rough rate of one a day, first chronologically, then doubling back, jumping from album to album or song to song, weighing favorites.\n\nWith his low, conspiratorial voice close in my ears—cracking jokes, telling dark secrets—this immersion made for an experience both intimate and intense. The songs became bound up with the landscape: the way “In the Pines” merged with the scraggly woods where I might glimpse the occasional rabbit in an overgrown field; the day I heard “Teenage Spaceship” while turning onto a quiet suburban street and felt a sudden and vivid empathy with the song’s adolescent subject. The one that sticks with me most is “The Mackenzies,” Gold Record’s tale of a man who receives an impromptu invitation for supper at his neighbors’ place and stumbles, Twilight Zone-like, into an alternate reality of their grief. One day I stopped on the dirt path to try to decipher the strange story and found myself choking up unexpectedly. Something about his neighbors’ sorrow, and his helpless discombobulation, seemed a perfect expression for this year’s never-ending cascade of loss.\n\nAlphonse Pierre, Staff Writer: It says a lot about me that in my search for soothing music this year I turned to Gucci Mane’s EA Sportscenter. There’s something incredibly relaxing about hearing the ATL trap forefather go on and on about his rims and how much better his life is than yours. Usually he’ll say these flexes with a basketball reference, like “Tall money Yao Ming taller than Nowitzki” from “Sportscenter.” He’s the only one who can make something so simple this memorable.\n\nVrinda Jagota, Associate Social Media Manager: Like a 2015 Tumblr mood board brought to life, I made and ate spanakopita while listening to “Sapokanikan” by Joanna Newsom multiple times this year. It was a joke, a party I threw myself, and a coping mechanism in a year in which very little felt beautiful. I love the ritual of making spanakopita: You melt a stick of butter and then carefully brush it onto sheet after sheet of dough before baking it to a gleaming crisp. It is nice to feed yourself with something that requires so much care. I also love everything about “Sapokanikan”: the layers of myth I only somewhat understand, the sound of the word “Ozymandian,” Newsom’s endlessly unfurling falsetto, the exquisite tragedy of the words “look and despair.” Most of all, I like the combination of spanakopita and “Sapokanikan” because I feel like I can escape into the layers and tiny decadence of both without leaving my kitchen.\n\nAnna Gaca, Associate Editor: I actually found this track because KeiyaA covered it on her album: Prince’s nine-minute-long version of his song “Do Yourself a Favor” (first recorded by Jesse Johnson), from the 2019 super-deluxe edition of 1999. The first half is this jaunty, see-ya-never breakup jam; the second half is a masterclass in ad-libs. At one point, you hear Prince flub a line—or maybe it’s on purpose?—and the whole persona turns a corner into this bitter, tipsy rant, like they’re just starting shit to try and conceal how vulnerable and definitely not over it they really are. It feels completely spontaneous, so it never gets old. Sometimes I’ll take a walk and listen four times in a row.\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa; Visuals Editor, Social Video Content: In early April, I devised a bike route throughout New York City that would become my morning routine. Greenpoint to Long Island City to Midtown to the Lower East Side to Williamsburg back to Greenpoint. At this point of the pandemic, Manhattan was a shell of itself. The familiar rhythm of the streets—the frantic horns, the subway roar, the pedestrian cacophony—had vanished. The city’s hum was replaced by the maddening whir of overlapping sirens.\n\nAs I biked freely down empty streets, Grouper’s “Headache” became my guide. Liz Harris opens the song with a story of her mother walking into the ocean to get a closer look at the horizon. I felt a similar magnetism to Manhattan on my morning rides. In this new New York City, the constant rapids of Broadway had calmed into a still river. I was alone, I couldn’t see a horizon, and my head hurt. Like Harris, I was tired of being lonely. I would fool myself into believing that by the time my birthday came around in June, I’d be back to working, eating, dating, dancing, living.\n\nYet my pessimism kept me grounded, and as Harris reminded me in “Headache,” error lies in hoping. She ends each verse with questions of self-doubt: Why is this costume weighing me down? Why does love keep letting me down? I’ve often suffered from the headache born out of these unanswerable questions. As a result, my therapist told me to never ask myself questions that begin with the word “why.” I asked why not. She said “why” implies there is a solution at hand, but often there isn’t. But I sometimes find it comforting to dwell in “why.” I understand that it is ultimately unproductive, but there’s a perverse pleasure in pity: “Why is this happening to me?” “Why” becomes a mantra as I allow these questions to lull me into festering hypnosis. Why is this costume—this body, this mask, this nation—weighing me down? Why does love—and life—keep letting me down? At times this year, with no horizon in sight, I chose to live with a headache.\n\nMatthew Ismael Ruiz; Associate Staff Writer, News: Helado Negro’s music has taken on a special significance for me this year. It was the first music my daughter heard after being born when she was holed up with her mom and dad in a Manhattan hospital room at the height of its first wave of COVID-19. Even now, nothing is quite as effective at soothing her when she’s stressed. I’ve long shared a spiritual connection with the Brooklyn singer-songwriter’s perspective, being caught in between the old world and the new, looking both inward and to the ancestors to find strength and beauty. Now I get to share that experience with another generation, witnessing its restorative properties in action. And I’m grateful.\n\nAndy Cush, Contributing Editor: About a month ago, as the weather got meaner and seeing friends got harder, I reconnected with my pals in Led Zeppelin. You know how it goes: You’re inseparable in high school, but by adulthood, you’ve grown apart; you fancy yourself an intellectual, and they’re still writing rock songs about The Lord of the Rings. You check in with them once, just to say hello, and you’re immediately back there, innocent of the world, encountering the heights of idiocy and depths of profundity for the first time.\n\nI found plenty of comfort in their most thunderous, ludicrous music, but I chose the tranquil, tasteful “The Rain Song” here because I believe it could soothe just about anyone. Its delicate layers of guitar and Mellotron remind me of years past when autumn was a time for contemplation and not dread. Ambiguous harmonies gather for a storm but release only drizzle; brushes fall on drum heads like scattered droplets on a tin roof. These elements build patiently to an understated and well-deserved climax: a ray of sunlight peeking out from between two clouds.\n\nThe two quick but undeniably sexual moans that Robert Plant lets loose at this poignant moment are incongruous, yes. For anyone meeting him for the first time, they may be enough to spoil the mood. What can I say? The guy can’t help himself. But he’s an old friend, and I forgive him.\n\nRyan Kincaid; Senior Manager, Audience Development and Analytics: There is no better album to soundtrack the loneliness of the pandemic, and the desire to experience life again, than Björk’s Homogenic. It’s sweeping, urgent, pulsating, meditative, comforting. The dance of hard and soft moments—the beauty and the distortion—seemed to keep time with my own unsteady emotional journey from denial to acceptance throughout the year.\n\nI rewatched the surrealist music video for “Bachelorette” in the early days of the pandemic, and it felt like a prophecy. Björk ends up trapped in an existential loop, experiencing the same events over and over in an increasingly confined way. Then, nature saves her: The people around her transfigure into trees, and a crowd becomes a forest. It offered a reminder that loneliness and experiencing life are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSam Sodomsky, Staff Writer: I started this year on a huge Sarah McLachlan kick, just scoping every record store in my area for used CDs and buying up their stock. In no time at all, I had taken home her entire catalog for just a couple of bucks. Surfacing is amazing, but Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is my favorite. It’s a true sanctuary. I hear the spiritual slow-builds of Talk Talk and the emotional complexity of Joni Mitchell: two giants who have influenced pretty much every artist I like but whose moods are difficult to actually replicate. And while I appreciate McLachlan’s cover of Joni’s “Blue” at the end of the album’s deluxe edition, the real closer will always be the title track, which set the tone for everything I looked for in art this year: “Peace in the struggle to find peace/Comfort on the way to comfort.”\n\nAllison Hussey; Associate Staff Writer, News: I figured I’d already worn out Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You” by this point in my life, but that turned out not to be true—the chiming dulcimer at the beginning still redirects my mind to a place of calm immediately. And though the song is bittersweet, there’s immense beauty in how Mitchell addresses the ways we carry and process our love for one another: “Part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time.” I’ve thought about that a lot more in exchanging letters with friends this year.\n\nDrew Litowitz, Digital Designer: There was a distinct sort of achy comfort I sought throughout quarantine, one that I found by being submerged in the atmospheric weight of sound and voice. Reverb, distortion, heavy tones, and drifting vocals gave me a space to disappear into. I located solace within the enveloping psychedelic worlds of Bobby Frank Brown’s The Enlightening Beam of Axonda, John Martyn’s One World, and Masumi Hara’s 4 X A Dream. All three center on uncertain vocals periodically on the edge of collapse, deep atmospheric soundscapes, and desperation that claws at the limits of the beautiful noise. It’s the sound of getting lost and calling it home. They go deep, and I was lucky enough to go with them.\n\nAdam Krefman; Executive Director, Festivals and Activations: Around 8 p.m., when my kids are in bed, I put on an album and tackle the mountain of dishes stacked in the sink. The one I keep returning to is Bob Dylan’s New Morning. It’s a shaggy-dog album in the best ways: warm, relaxed. It just sounds like domesticity. It also features a song called “Time Passes Slowly,” which certainly resonates right now.\n\nWhat song or album made you forget the hellscape that was 2020 for a few minutes?\n\nAmy Phillips, Managing Editor: On March 9, I started feeling slightly under the weather; by March 11, when I received my positive COVID-19 test result, I was pretty much bedridden. For over a week, the only times I got out of bed were to go to the bathroom. My husband, who had tested positive two days after I did, was left taking care of our 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter by himself, locked inside our 800-square-foot apartment.\n\nBy March 20, the day the Weeknd’s After Hours was released, my symptoms had slightly abated, but my husband’s had gotten much worse. So we switched: He was now isolated in the bedroom, and I was taking care of our daughter, alone and still recovering. For the week that followed, during whatever brief stretches I could muster up the strength to clean a few dishes while my kid slept, the only thing I wanted to listen to was After Hours. I’m still not exactly sure why, other than that maybe Abel Tesfaye’s dark, neon-lit songs of sex and drugs and ’80s synths offered a brief escape from my miserable existence, a reminder that life still existed outside the confines of my apartment. “The Weeknd album helped me survive COVID” may be one of the most ridiculous things I will ever type, but I swear to god, it’s the truth.\n\nQuinn Moreland, Staff Writer: At this point I’ve written quite a bit about Waxahatchee’s Saint Cloud, so I’m sorry if I sound like a broken record, but no other album is so closely entangled with my personal 2020. A friend recently texted me, “Saint Cloud hits different during quar.” He was right: When I needed to metaphorically leave my messy apartment and problems behind, I knew Saint Cloud would transport me to someplace green and open and Not New York. Around June, I had to take a break from the record. As the city erupted into protest, escapism lost some of its appeal. But I knew that Saint Cloud would be waiting for me when I needed it again.\n\nEvan Minsker, News Editor: There’s a dark-but-reassuring hypnosis to “Surf’s Up,” the eight-minute opening track of Magik Markers’ 2020, with its trudging bassline and meandering guitar solo. The song is a patient jam with some impressionistic words about riding waves, making the best of the rising tides, and trying to ward off anxiety. “Don’t worry about what they say/Don’t worry about what they do,” sings a reserved Elisa Ambrogio, and for a little while, it’s easy to heed that advice—to avert your gaze, however briefly, from the endless torrent of horrible news.\n\nWhat song or album that didn’t make Pitchfork’s year-end lists did you listen to the most?\n\nJazz Monroe; Associate Staff Writer, News: How to describe “Turbo Olé” by JASSS? Imagine the year is 1980, and you are an eyelinered goth in layered black shawls, grieving the demise of Ian Curtis. Suddenly a figure appears in a puff of smoke and informs you that, in the decades hence, the band formerly known as Joy Division will reform under a new name and produce some of the most beloved dance tracks known to man. Your brain whirrs: What the hell will these futuristic club elegies sound like?\n\n“Turbo Olé” gives us the answer: a Faustian anthem primarily composed of breakbeats and anxiety, a Laser Quest’s idea of club music. It is perilously close to being kitsch, which is half the magic. As with all the riskiest showstoppers, not everyone is vulnerable to its charms—as I learned upon presenting the track at one of Pitchfork’s year-end Zoom listening sessions. “I need to not feel like I’m on speed right now,” remarked one colleague, politely excusing herself. For those who, after this long year, perhaps wouldn’t say no: This is the way, step inside.\n\nJenn Pelly, Contributing Editor: When I heard the flickering second album from Glaswegian trio Still House Plants, its effect on me was deep and instantaneous. Fast Edit is beautifully fractured music, drawing jagged lines from post-punk fragmentation to improvisatory jazz drumming, from raspy R&B to tattered-heart emo (imagine Tirzah guesting in Life Without Buildings), but it stays in no one place for long. Collaging their spare recordings over practice-session voice memos, Still House Plants inhabit an ecstatic in-between all their own. And they seem to acknowledge, in their constantly unraveling yet self-possessed sound, the inherent uncertainty of being a person. This year, I kept slipping away from myself. It was comforting and frankly a little overwhelming to hear this raw, arresting music that sounds like it’s falling apart as well as into itself, over and over, in every possibility-seeking note.\n\nMankaprr Conteh, Editorial Operations Associate: In West and Central African nations like Sierra Leone, where my family is from, English-based Pidgin languages are commonly spoken. A melange of English and local dialects, Pidgin unites folks across ethnic groups and walks of life. When I hear it in music, I feel in community with my favorite Afropop stars and their fans. Being so far away from family this year, that sense of community meant more than ever.\n\nNew Nigerian Afro-fusion singer Omah Lay sprinkles Pidgin in his popular—mostly English—love song “You,” but totally relies on the language to lay into his haters in an alternate cut of the song. Simply named “Untitled 2,” the remix abandons all sweetness, as Omah Lay coolly threatens his adversaries. Fuck with me and it’ll be a problem, he says. The song retains the same bouncing instrumental as the original, contradicting his sharp tongue. For an ego boost, for a good time, or for a piece of home, I played “Untitled 2” more times than I can count this year.\n\nNoah Yoo, Staff Writer: One of my favorite songs to come out in 2020 was released at least 16 years after its recording. The Blue Nile’s “Here Come the Bluebirds,” the closing bonus track from the recent reissue of their final album High, instantly snared me. “It’s you and I, against the world,” Paul Buchanan nearly whispers at the start of the song, his voice cracking as he stretches out those simple words as far as they can go. It arrived just as New York City was coming out of its three-month lockdown, right before protests in the face of rampant police murder began to erupt here and around the world. During a year soundtracked by sirens, there was no chorus more apt to me than: “Here come the bluebirds/Here come the police cars/Look at our neighbors/Is it all for me and you?”\n\nKatie Philo, Senior Social Media Manager: Both Laura Marling and I turned 30 this year. As a fellow Brit, I’ve listened to her music since I was a teenager and have grown deeply attached to each of her records. Song for Our Daughter, her seventh studio album, quickly became a companion on my frosty and isolated morning walks around Brooklyn at the start of lockdown. On a personal level, it felt like a comforting embrace with an old friend—especially when living in a country that is not my own. The album is quintessentially Laura Marling: wonderfully assembled and mixed, with her voice and lyrics taking center stage. Written as a conceptual album to an imaginary child in her quest to understand what it is to be a woman, the songs are bejeweled with intricate tales, literary references, and poignant moments for pause. I found new meaning every time I plugged in and took it for a stroll, making it the perfect soundtrack to solitude.\n\nHow has your relationship with music changed this year?\n\nSam Sodomsky: This is the year I finally got into the game of making hyper-specific playlists for every moment of my life. Maybe it’s because I spent all year in my apartment, so it was easier to curate the music supervision to my own boring reality show. For whatever reason, it became a constant fixture. It also ended up being a nice way to reconnect with my teen self who compulsively burned mix CDs from iTunes. I even tried to replicate the sound of that era with a playlist I titled Nostalgia Pins and filled with mid-to-late-2000s indie-rock heavy hitters. Like Kenny Chesney says, when I hear those songs, I go back.\n\nRyan Kincaid: Around month two of lockdown, I started a project in which I chose a few artists every day and listened to their entire discographies from beginning to end. I listened to about 350 different albums over the course of a month, and it gave me something different to look forward to every day. The Groundhog Day effect of the pandemic slowly loosened its grip as I escaped into the worlds created by each artist: the Champagne kiss-laden lounges of Jessie Ware, the Avalanches’ sunny paradise, the languid and dreamy landscapes of Chromatics. I shattered my habit of building and relying on playlists to create my own worlds out of music and began spending time in the ones already built and arranged for me.\n\nIsabelia Herrera: As a writer and fan, music has always been at the center of my personal, professional, and intellectual life. In a year loaded with so many individual and collective challenges—self-isolation, political upheaval, my mother’s stroke—I was pushed to think against the protocols of how I’ve been taught to listen. I had to stop thinking about music in simple terms—as utility, as community, or as art. I started to rethink how I write about music, and what the “point” of writing about it is—whether my role is to provide information, offer critique, or harness the complex, layered experiences music can bring us. It forced me to try and open up my writing practice a bit. I stopped trying to be perfect, to “capture it all.” I don’t know if I have or will ever find a satisfying alternative, but this year allowed me to lead with experiences and encounters of music rather than the pressure to be definitive.\n\nAnna Gaca: I’ve found it almost impossible to engage with music this year. I set out trying to be very purposeful—I started making my best-of list in January! Then the pandemic knocked everything sideways: I lost all my normal contexts for listening (work, gym, commute) and all the people I’d usually discuss it with and replaced them with a lot of stunned silence. The anxiety of life in 2020 diminished my mental capacity and made it much harder to multitask, even something as simple as editing a review of an album while also listening to it. I’ll restart the same song over and over, or hit pause and forget for hours. I can’t keep up with my usual listening; I feel like I’m constantly failing. I love music, but it’s been a source of tremendous frustration.\n\nAllison Hussey: Music has always been central to my social life in various ways, and it’s been painful to feel so disconnected from that this year. But I found another kind of communion in having deeper, more solitary listening experiences. I’ve spent much more time digging into the context and history of what I’ve listened to, learning more about who played on what, when, and how it happened. This approach has illuminated more of the connections shared among people, sounds, and ideas that are meaningful to me, which has provided a unique comfort and intensified my emotional connection to music.\n\nQuinn Moreland: I had to do some self-reflection before I could attempt to answer this question. Did my relationship to music change? Have I changed? Are those the same things? The answer to all of the above is yes. With my life essentially restricted to a one-bedroom apartment, I’ve really tried to focus on finding the things in my life—and in my control—that make me happy. Sometimes it’s not music. More often than not those comforts have been sewing, crying over episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or a long book about anything other than music. My struggle to listen to music for pleasure is definitely a direct result of the confusing collapse between my work and personal lives, something I will definitely unpack if and when I find a therapist. I look forward to rekindling my relationship with music, if she will have me.\n\nWhat was the most inspired use of music in a TV show or film this year?\n\nEvan Minsker: In the essential What We Do in the Shadows episode “On the Run,” the British vampire Laszlo Cravensworth (played by Matt Berry) has to run away and start anew as a small-town bartender. He changes his name to Jackie Daytona and brags about his brilliant American disguise, which is literally just what he always wears plus jeans and a toothpick. Robert Palmer’s “Simply Irresistible” plays over a montage of Laszlo settling into his new life seamlessly—dancing with townies, driving a pickup truck, and becoming legitimately obsessed with high school volleyball. He charmed everyone in town, and now his de facto theme song consists of a slick Brit singing about a beautiful grifter. It’s perfect, and “Simply Irresistible” is still stuck in my head.\n\nJillian Mapes, Senior Editor: Few filmmakers can pull off playing a song all the way through once, but Steve McQueen successfully does it twice with Janet Kay’s 1979 hit “Silly Games” in “Lovers Rock”—almost thrice if you count the women singing it a cappella as they cook. The second installment in Small Axe, McQueen’s new anthology series about the West Indian immigrant experience in 1960s/’70s/’80s London, has already gotten a bit of attention for its true-to-form reggae soundtrack and rollicking blues party setting. What I’ve come to celebrate is even more specific: As the DJ allows “Silly Games” to play through following a mad-dash set, the camera lingers for a while on the hips of a new couple dancing oh so closely. It’s a stunning embodiment of the spirit of lovers rock, and a perfect tribute to a hit that helped popularize the romantic subgenre. The sustained sultriness gives way to the second full version of “Silly Games,” this time sung by the entire dancefloor, down to the hero note. The song is just that cathartic.\n\nWhat was the last concert you saw before lockdown?\n\nPhilip Sherburne: I got lucky. I live in a place where I don’t get to see a lot of live music, but I managed to catch the final night of MUTEK Barcelona just days before the lockdown went into place. The Moroccan-born musician Ikram Bouloum played a thrilling set influenced by international styles of club music—batida, gqom, dembow—accompanied by Barcelona’s Mans O. The Berlin-based Toronto native Aquarian dealt a punishing hand of industrial-strength techno and bass music. And Loraine James blended broken club rhythms into her own completely original style of experimental electronic music. James went on to have an active year, putting out multiple self-released EPs, alternate takes, and collections of edits on Bandcamp before finally coming through with a strong EP for Hyperdub, and I followed her progress eagerly: Every new record reminded me of the energy of that night at the beginning of March; each one felt like a stepping stone toward a day when I might experience one like it again.\n\nMatthew Ismael Ruiz: I can’t be sure what my actual last show was, but the last one I remember was Chubby & the Gang opening for Hank Wood & the Hammerheads at Market Hotel. A friend was complaining about the crowd’s high bro quotient, and Chubby’s set was cut nearly in half by technical difficulties. But it served as an excellent reminder of how even a great record can only tell half a band’s story: Chubby’s rowdy band of hooligans turned out to be a gang of fresh-faced teens led by a grizzled punk veteran who’d played only a handful of shows together. The set was rough, raw, and bursting with energy, a rare look at a baby band in the process of coalescing. Hank Wood, a scene stalwart that has no trouble commanding an entire room—and tearing it down in the process—was predictably excellent. But Chubby’s set was most memorable in its imperfections, a reminder that even the best music is still made by humans, who rarely arrive fully formed.\n\nDrew Litowitz: As somebody who frequents mostly smaller shows, seeing Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Jonathan Richman co-headline Manhattan’s Town Hall was the perfect anomaly to help me remember live music. It felt oddly like the inverse of quarantine: an audience full of people one could argue “don’t get out much” watching these loveable but reclusive oddballs play a cavernous, old-world concert hall. On a classical guitar, Richman endeared the crowd with Italian poetry and stories of summer nights filled with red wine and water gun fights, inviting us into his unexpectedly vast world of language, history, and the human experience. Then Oldham and frequent collaborator Emmett Kelly arrived delightfully scruffy, their nimble acoustic guitars and fine-tuned harmonies pouring into the hall with the comfort and ease of a living room. It was the odd night on the town for the couch-listening set. It felt like home. From my actual home, I think of it often.\n\nNoah Yoo: It’s taken me months to stop thinking about the last concert I saw before lockdown. The show was Destroyer, with Nap Eyes opening, at Brooklyn Steel. I remember looking up at Dan Bejar and thinking he was the coolest guy in the world, totally uninterested in any performative engagement with the crowd and simply living within his songs as he brought them to life. If I focus really hard, I can feel the elation I felt at the synth intro to “It Just Doesn’t Happen” and the memory of holding some of my best friends’ shoulders as we danced to “Chinatown.” We never talked about whether it would be the last concert we’d attend that year; maybe we were afraid of speaking it into reality. Instead, we crashed a friend’s house party and cracked uneasy jokes about how we probably shouldn’t be standing so close to one another.\n\nMarc Hogan, Senior Staff Writer: It stands out because it was so ordinary. I went with two wonderful friends, a married couple I’ve known for 11 years, to see the Black Lips on a Sunday night. I remember we drove on the freeway for a single exit even though the venue, a 700-capacity space called Wooly’s, is within walking distance of my home. The Atlanta garage-rock veterans once played a festival here in Des Moines, and it was one of those shows where half the people you know (and vaguely know) seem to be there. This time, the Lips were mainly doing songs from their solid, country-tinged new album, Sing in a World That’s Falling Apart, but I can recall being thrilled to hear “Cold Hands,” too, off of old favorite Good Bad Not Evil. This was March 8. The bass player was still spitting onstage and diving into the crowd. The venue is one of the lucky ones still open, but I haven’t been there—or seen those friends—in the nine months since.\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa: Back in the hopeful days of January, my friend and I attended a sold-out Ambient Church show at Bushwick United Methodist. Each performance was accompanied by videos projection-mapped onto the stained glass. We sat in the balcony for JAB’s set, a mesmerizing flute-driven composition complemented with a nature walk through an airy forest. We moved to the floor before Ana Roxanne took the stage, where she stood at the altar like she was about to deliver a sermon. Flanked by projections of the moon’s surface, she opened with “Nocturne,” and I could feel the bass reverberate in my chest. After she played “Suite pour l'invisible,” the video projections stopped and she pulled out a notebook. As sounds of waves crashed through the church, she read the text that opens “Venus,” a rumination on the ontology of water. “Merging water moves fluidly from one form to another,” she said. “Easily transitioning from cloud to raindrop to sea. Forever changing form, but not essence.” Later, Don Slepian performed his masterpiece “Sea of Bliss” as bright animations by artist Nicole Ginelli ushered me through a new dimension. I was still considering water; how drops can barely travel before being absorbed into puddles. Within the church, we were beads of water pooled together. Afterward, we would disperse to find new puddles.\n\nAdam Krefman: The last shows I went to were our festival kick-off parties in Chicago. It was a killer lineup and a really beautiful room that our team made look like a weirdo high school dance. A lot of people who work on Pitchfork Music Festival were there just to hang out and celebrate. Without the dark filter of hindsight, it was just a beautiful couple of evenings with great music and friends. I’m not sure if I could’ve picked a better “last” concert.\n\nWhat were your substitutes for live music this year?\n\nJenn Pelly: There is no substitute, but I did see two small, socially-distanced outdoor shows this fall, and the first one stirred up waves of feeling in me that I hope to remember forever. I hadn’t been to a show in nearly six months—my longest break from show-going since I was 13—when I caught three improvised sets in a parking lot near the Red Hook ferry. I would like to say that I had not forgotten the way music electrifies the air and creates connections with everyone around you at a show; or how powerful it can feel to witness the resourcefulness and adaptability of underground music play out, soundtracking its own survival; or how live music just makes you long to inch your way ever closer to it, especially during a seated show. But the rhythms of this show reminded me.\n\nThe final set was by the noise artist Charmaine Lee. She assembled her small array of pedals in the glow of a clamp light; the Manhattan skyline was in the distance, and it grew dark, and the buildings and the river harmonized incandescently, as they do. Lee is a practitioner of extended vocal technique and she made noise with her whole body: Her mouth, her chest, amplifying her pulsating breath, pushing her life source into the red. I felt more attuned than usual to how physical and vulnerable live music can be—like all the time away had sharpened my perception—and how at a show someone is always putting herself on the line. I felt grateful to see improvised music in an improvised setting because all year, life had been daily improv. I felt a renewed sense of the shock and wonder I’d known so often when I started going to shows as a kid. Lee said she hadn’t done this in front of people in six months, and I thought of everyone else at this late-summer gig who was, like me, making a profound if fleeting return. Another feeling came back: on a Thursday night in New York City, to share an experience with a stranger.\n\nJillian Mapes: In October, my boyfriend hatched a miraculous plan to put on safe, socially distanced karaoke on a friend’s roof, laying the groundwork for the best Halloween of my life. Each person or couple had their own mic (available cheaply online), which was plugged into a practice amp. Lyrics were projected onto the building next door, and the karaoke videos came via YouTube’s robust array (a few recommended accounts), with friends adding to a playlist ahead of time for easy access. The “stage” area was clearly marked away from the “crowd” area. With a few guidelines in place, my friends fully snapped when it came time to perform: Peaches’ “Fuck the Pain Away” sang-spoke in an effortlessly taunting tone; a robot shuffle across the roof set to the chorus of Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic”; deadpan jokes asking for cash amid the Flying Lizards’ cover of “Money”; crooning about Tennessee whiskey and wailing over old flames and spontaneous dance breaks set to onscreen captions like “(air trumpet).” Some of the people I missed the most ended up putting on the closest thing I got to a show in seven months. I’m still dreaming of it like others are their last pre-pandemic concert, eagerly awaiting the first warm weekend this spring.\n\nJazz Monroe: Concerts are great for twisting the lens on songs new and old, but what I really miss is the mix of catharsis and frivolous socializing. The nearest approximation took place in my own living room, where my partner and I would play musical ping-pong: each choosing a song inspired, as tangentially as we pleased, by the previous selection. When it worked, the soundtrack would zip from Otis Redding to João Gilberto to Christina Aguilera in the time it takes to throw back a boulevardier. When it did not, we would flail in the quicksand of the world’s most stubborn genres. Ultimately, the drear of lockdown made even the misadventures welcome. There is no substitute for a concert, but a jukebox in a bar is the next best thing—and what better simulation than having all your favorite songs derailed by a barrage of nu-metal?\n\nAndy Cush: Filmed with a single camera at a live-stream performance in July, this video features Angel Olsen and Hand Habits bandleader Meg Duffy harmonizing on Tom Petty’s “Walls,” unaccompanied, save for Duffy’s acoustic guitar. I’ve watched it at least a dozen times since it aired. The music, and its presentation, are simple and relaxed, though both performers are capable of dazzling virtuosity. Softly and steadily, separately and together, their voices locate some quiet magic at the song’s center; by the end, even they seem surprised and a little abashed at what they’ve uncovered. It reminds me that similarly spare, intimate, and occasionally transcendent performances are happening everywhere, every day of the pandemic, without a camera rolling. Audiences may be deprived, but music is not dead; it lives on among musicians, playing for themselves in their homes.\n\nAlphonse Pierre: Let’s be real: Music is not like movies, where for the most part you can have a relatively similar experience on your couch as you can in a theater. Few of the countless Instagram live shows or Verzuz battles were able to keep my attention. Inevitably, I would end up scrolling to some other app on my phone. If anything, the closest I came to emulating the experience of a live show was listening to DJ sets on SoundCloud and NTS Radio. Having someone who is not an algorithm take control of what I’m listening to, it will never get old.\n\nMankaprr Conteh: I feel lucky to have fallen in love in the throes of the pandemic. While my now-boyfriend and I were long-distance-dating this spring, we held our own Verzuz-style battles over FaceTime. Rather than choosing a single artist to face off, we lobbed 2000s R&B and hip-hop favorites back and forth. I played Chingy on my phone, propping it near my laptop for somewhat decent acoustics. He responded with Dem Franchize Boyz. We danced and drank; we were the DJs and the hype-men. We both come from families of West African immigrants, so one night, we celebrated the Afropop we love, trading tracks by artists like Rema and Maleek Berry. I unequivocally won the battles, and so much more.\n\nVrinda Jagota: Nothing fuels my main character complex more than being two drinks in on a dancefloor. In reality, I’m constantly scanning the room for the best dancer and replicating their moves. But in my mind, I’m early 2000s Britney Spears ready to shoot a one-take music video. Alas, the closest I got to communally dancing this year was half-shuffling to Zedd songs in the grocery store while trying to determine the difference between scallions and green onions. I spent most of my weekend nights cooking and dancing in my kitchen next to a window that turned reflective as it got dark outside. I’ve always kind of known I’m not actually a good dancer but was really confronted with this reality after catching a few awkward glimpses of myself in that window. So I spent many hours this year playing Chloe x Halle’s “Ungodly Hour,” occasionally stirring a mediocre soup, and trying to figure out which tween’s TikTok moves I could feasibly replicate. Almost all of them looked bad but soundtracked by such a perfectly confident song, it’s hard not to momentarily feel like the main character, even if you’re all alone in your apartment.\n\nAmy Phillips: My toddler daughter hollering “Let It Go” from Frozen while running around the apartment, accompanied by my husband on guitar, was probably the closest I got to a live-music substitute.\n\nWhich artist are you most excited about seeing live (or dancing to in a club) next year?\n\nIsabelia Herrera: One of the great tragedies of 2020 was that we were denied the gift of hearing Bad Bunny at the club. YHLQMDLG dropped right before the pandemic hit in the U.S., and I was lucky enough to hear it for the first time with an assembled crew of friends, but Zoom parties in my bedroom just don’t measure up to an actual drunken perreo. I deeply miss my club community: the DJs who offer us sweaty release, the strangers we befriend in the bathroom, run-ins with friends of friends—even the low-level drama that makes a night out deliciously messy.\n\nSam Sodomsky: The last time I saw Bruce Springsteen with the E Street Band was during his 2016 run at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium when he opened with “New York City Serenade” and tried to beat the record for his longest-ever U.S. show. It immediately felt legendary, and I remember thinking, “If this is my last time seeing Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band live, I will be okay with that.” But I was wrong. I need to see them again, and so do you. To paraphrase something I screamed that night, several hours into the evening, with my fist in the air: Someday soon, I don’t know when, we’re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go. And we’ll walk in the sun.\n\nAlphonse Pierre: Since first hearing Rio Da Yung OG and Louie Ray’s “Movie,” I’ve wanted to see the Flint duo perform it live. I just need to be around people who will appreciate their out-of-pocket punchlines as much as I do. That’s the best part about a live show—you’re stuck in a tight space with people who care about the same music you do. It’s an experience that won’t happen anytime soon, but when it does, I want to be rapping along with a hoarse voice as Rio exclaims, “My bitch can’t even like a nigga picture, I’m insecure!”\n\nJenn Pelly: I’m most looking forward to seeing the liberationist free jazz ensemble Irreversible Entanglements: poet Camae Ayewa (aka Moor Mother), bassist Luke Stewart, saxophonist Keir Neuringer, trumpeter Aquiles Navarro, drummer Tcheser Holmes. At times this year, Irreversible Entanglements was the only music that made sense to me. Over the incendiary swarm of the title track to their second LP, Who Sent You?, from March, Ayewa furiously interrogates a cop who should not be in her neighborhood: “What are you doing here?” she seethes, with an emphatic “no” inside every syllable. Her first words on this record, which need to reverberate in rooms: “Stay on it.”\n\nQuinn Moreland: While I deeply miss the buzz of DIY shows at tiny spots with horrifying bathrooms, my body craves the energy of a massive pop concert. I was bitten by the Dua Lipa bug this year and am desperate to dance to “Levitating” with other people instead of...alone...in my living room. I have a hard time believing that concerts of that magnitude will be safely possible in 2021 (at least in the U.S.) but if they do, I’ll be there in bright blue eyeshadow.\n\nAllison Hussey: My dream is an all-day smorgasbord of Magik Markers, 75 Dollar Bill, Endless Boogie, and the Sun Ra Arkestra to power-wash away the terrible gunk of 2020. Big, gorgeous walls of sound that rattle every atom. Then bring it back down to earth with the Necks, who I had hoped to see in New York at the end of March, which got pushed to the beginning of August, which got pushed to [incoherent wailing].\n\nRyan Kincaid: A Daft Punk “Alive 2021: Around the World One More Time Tour” would be ideal, but if I’m not able to manifest that, I might spend way too much on resale Chromatica Ball tickets. I can’t imagine a better way to end the pandemic than losing my mind to “Rain on Me” in a sweaty, packed, queer-as-hell crowd, completely overstimulated, screaming at the top of my lungs. Droplets? Everywhere. If I can’t catch a rocket to Chromatica, I’d happily enjoy a slightly-more-subdued evening with Róisín Murphy. However, I’m not sure any artist will be the lone main attraction when live music safely returns. Every musician will be co-headlining with the excitement of being around new people again.\n\nWhat loss from the music world in 2020 hit you the hardest and why?\n\nAndy Cush: “Influential” doesn’t quite cover it when you’re talking about Toots Hibbert, the singer-songwriter for Toots and the Maytals who died after hospitalization with COVID-19-like symptoms in September. This is the guy who’s responsible for the fact that we call it reggae music and was still out there, living, grooving, singing, shining beams of joy on audiences all over the world. As far as I can tell, the Maytals played their last concert on February 22, about a month before U.S. cities and states began issuing pandemic shutdown orders. This is how things were for Toots, an unstoppable music machine well into his 70s. He took time off from playing live after a fan threw a liquor bottle that struck him in the face and gave him a concussion in 2013—at the ripe age of 70—but resumed touring more or less constantly three years later.\n\nI consider myself extremely lucky that I got to see Toots perform with the Maytals a few times in these later years. Improbably, his voice had lost none of its expressive power and sometimes seemed even richer and more complex than that of the young man documented on classic albums like Funky Kingston and Reggae Got Soul. Watching him perform—both in terms of his historical stature and the quality of his music—was like living in a world where Otis Redding had not died at age 26 and was still playing regularly at your local 1,000-capacity nightclub. Ironically, it was precisely because Toots never gained quite the level of global superstardom he deserved that he was so available to his fans, out road-dogging in much smaller rooms than he should have been playing. If he sensed any cruelty in his situation, he didn’t show it as he swaggered across the stage in his trademark leather vests. With his songs of humble working people facing tough situations, his buoyant onstage presence, and above all, his precious golden voice, he had a way of transmuting pain into happiness.\n\nMatthew Ismael Ruiz: Cándido Camero is a titan of Latin percussion, a towering pillar of Black music whose influence on generations of rhythm sections is impossible to overstate. The legendary Cuban conguero was at the forefront of the cultural fusion that created Latin jazz, collaborating with both the bebop pioneers as well as the OG Latin bandleaders and spending much of the 20th century weaving Afro-Latino rhythms into the fabric of American music.\n\nI was lucky enough to see him perform in Harlem a few years ago at a concert in celebration of his legacy, well into his 90s and requiring assistance to walk on and off the stage. But I was floored by the way he came alive behind the congas, bursting with joy and energy, slapping the drums with increased fervor long after the rehearsed program had finished, almost hesitant to truly leave the love of his life behind. His death hit me not because it came too soon—he certainly lived a full 99 years—but because his legacy is often brushed aside in the canon despite having such an outsized influence on Caribbean music. If there’s any solace, it’s that the Thousand Finger Man’s musical DNA continues to persist in modern jazz, pop, and dance music, whether it’s recognized or not.\n\nEvan Minsker: It’s still really hard to believe that Riley Gale isn’t alive. Of course, it hurts like hell to know there won’t be more Power Trip albums or shows—listening to their thrilling and brutal records now is like watching a boulder careen down a steep hill and then suddenly disappear midway down. The band had so much left to give, and so did Riley as an individual. The world needs more artists who use their platforms to engage politically and raise awareness about human rights violations. And he was seriously so fucking funny. More than just losing a crucial voice in heavy music, the world lost a crucial voice, period.\\\n\nMankaprr Conteh: Two weeks and four days after I was introduced to Cameroonian jazz legend Manu Dibango, he died in a French hospital of COVID-19 at 86 years old. Last spring, I was teaching myself how to cover contemporary African music through an independent study in my graduate journalism program. After work one night, I was sifting through African Rock, a 1990 encyclopedia of pop music and artists on the continent. I looked up some songs on YouTube as they were named in the book. When I got to a passage on Dibango’s 1972 hit “Soul Makossa,” I was shocked to hear something familiar: his “mama-ko mama-sah ma-ma-ma-kossa” refrain sounded just like one I had assumed was Michael Jackson’s brainchild. I was thrilled to learn that an African inspired one of the most memorable exclamations in Western music. I danced to the song, with its steady backbeat and assertive horns, over and over. Dying on March 24, Manu Dibango was an early casualty of this heinous virus. It felt like losing a new friend.\n\nDrew Litowitz: John Prine’s music always brings a peculiar smile to my face. His songs worship the hell out of living, narrating life’s darkest pits of despair and tenderest moments of connection with the same wry enthusiasm and detail. Maybe that’s what makes it so hard to lose him. Even terrible things sounded beautiful when he wrote about them. His music was so authentically human, it enlivened you to recognize your own humanity. Not many living songwriters can capture life’s dull stings and lilting crests like Prine could—with care, conviction, and perhaps most importantly, with humor. To lose him to something so unexpected is especially painful, at a time when we probably need somebody like him the most. It’s the type of thing he would have written a great song about. It would somehow make us smile.\n\nPhilip Sherburne: So many artists who were crucial to my tastes died this year, from all corners of the musical universe. Some, I had been listening to since adolescence, like Harold Budd—The Moon and the Melodies, his 1986 album with the Cocteau Twins, pointed me toward a life-long love of ambient music—or Thee Slayer Hippy, drummer for my hometown punk heroes Poison Idea. Some, like Mazzy Star’s David Roback, were reminders of my college years; others (Kraftwerk’s Florian Schneider, Andrew Weatherall) were fundamental to the electronic music that has obsessed me for the past quarter-century.\n\nThen there was Portland show promoter Mike Thrasher, a school classmate of mine, whose bookings dominated the city’s punk and indie landscape for decades; that one hit too close to home. But the death that keeps haunting me is Vern Rumsey, of Unwound, as well as a long list of later projects. Like me, he was from the Pacific Northwest; he was roughly my age, and, like me, father to a daughter. I never met him, but his music, particularly in Unwound, was a huge part of a formative—and difficult—period of my life. I stumbled upon Unwound’s music a year or so out of college, and I heard in their tangled sonics both a reflection of the turmoil I felt and a road map out of it. His bass playing—noisy, muscular, driven by controlled fury and cool determination—was the center of their music’s storm; it had a way of making even the messiest feelings make sense.\n\nNoah Yoo: I was not shocked when Bill Withers died—do this job long enough, and you eventually inure yourself to the idea that all your heroes will pass on. What gutted me about his death is that it came right at a moment when his work had taken on new relevance yet again, with publicized instances of healthcare workers and cooped-up citizenry singing “Lean On Me” to keep their spirits afloat. “Lean On Me” and other Withers classics like “Ain’t No Sunshine” are practically American folk songs at this point—bona fide standards, passed on from generation to generation. As artists and songwriters from all walks of life poured out their hearts, mourning his passing, it became hard to imagine anyone having quite the same impact again.\n\nWhat are your music resolutions for 2021?\n\nJillian Mapes: I’m ashamed to admit that I was down to about two shows a month when the pandemic hit. After a decade of easy-come, easy-go guest lists and moves further south in Brooklyn, I had come to an understanding with my sense of FOMO: There will always be another great concert in New York City, you’ve seen enough, it’s okay to stay home and live your boring life. I was wrong. I cringe now thinking about some of the shows I didn’t attend in 2019 because I was tired and the venue was in north Brooklyn—a small gecs set late on a cold weeknight, a Sheer Mag gig arriving on the heels of an album I loved. As I watched friends leave the city this year, I knew it wasn’t over for me. Again and again I thought, I need to be here when the lights get switched on, I can’t go out this jaded. And so my resolution is simple: To take full advantage of live music in New York the minute it safely returns, and more specifically, to not skip shows because it’s inconvenient and I “need” to watch some TV show. In late 2021 (I hope?), you might even find me turning up for opening acts I don’t particularly like—just because I can.\n\nJazz Monroe: If you had told me in January that 2020 would be the year production slowed, transport ground to a halt, and conservatives approved radical economic intervention, I might have wept with relief: “Finally, a proper rethink of climate strategy!” As pandemic fatigue spreads, the opposite reality beckons, and I think we all understand how easy it would be to regress—to swallow the disastrous logic that this blip demands a hasty return to hyper-capitalism. The survival of concert infrastructure is essential, but how we use it, particularly in terms of travel, has to change. We belong to a field whose goals should dovetail with green policy and workplace transformation: The less we buy, the less we needlessly produce, and so the less people must work—meaning more time to indulge and invest in arts and leisure. The moment to implement this stuff is now before we reawaken the beast.\n\nAmy Phillips: Finally cut the cord (literally) and start using wireless headphones. Spend some quality time with the Kate Bush, Sade, and Fugazi discographies. Buy more stuff on Bandcamp. Alphabetize and properly shelve the piles of vinyl lying around my apartment. Go to as many shows as possible, god willing.\n\nMarc Hogan: My resolution is to continue to find new music that inspires me and feels special and meaningful enough that I have no choice but to harangue everyone I know about it. I’ve imagined I was washed every year since my early 20s, since before people used the word “washed,” but this year seemed harder than most for connecting with music that wasn’t directly part of my daily work. If I can nurture some private obsession in 2021 that the rest of the staff gets sick of having me DM them about, that seems like a worthy and achievable resolution. Or maybe Air France could just reunite?\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa: Buy more music. I need to wean myself off of Spotify and just listen to things in my collection. It’s the least I could do.\n\nKatie Philo: I reignited my last.fm profile this year because, well, I had time to get into the numbers and wanted a dose of 2010 nostalgia. You don’t need to be a statistician to note that I like to spin the same records over and over again. At least there’s a clear explanation for it this year: Dealing with uncertainty, you often grip to things that feel familiar and safe, which explains why I listened to Waxahatchee’s Saint Cloud and Phoebe Bridgers’ Punisher on repeat. Of course, I love discovering and listening to new music—I just tend to scurry back to the female-led-indie-rock-shaped hole from which I emerged. Next year, I want to hang with old friends like Phoebe but also spend more time getting acquainted with new or unfamiliar-to-me artists and genres. I vow to pass the aux cord and surf the wave of another’s taste for a while. After all, they say the magic happens outside the comfort zone.\n\nAdam Krefman: When live music comes back: Don’t fence-sit about going to a show. Just go!"
