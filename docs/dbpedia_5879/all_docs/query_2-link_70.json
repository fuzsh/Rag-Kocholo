        "text": "I grew up in a small conservative town in Northern California called Lodi. I was raised in the church and went to private Christian school from K-8th grade. I remember my first encounter with anything remotely punk rock was seeing the music video for Green Day’s “American Idiot” in 7th grade on VH1. I instantly fell in love with the band and more importantly their style of what at the time seemed to me as “punk”. After hearing Green Day and buying nearly every record with in a week’s span of time, I was ready and anxious to go see the band live. My parents wouldn’t budge on taking me to see the band but my dad finally caved and bought me tickets to the American Idiot tour in 2005.\n\nI could hardly contain my excitement about seeing the band. After about 10 songs or so into the set, my dad pulled the plug and said it was time to leave. My mother had heard from a friend that was at the show about how vulgar and offensive Billie Joe was as a front man and called my dad demanding we leave and come home. The next morning my mom threw away every Green Day record as well as merchandise that I had bought. She then took me to the local Christian book store to pick out a record that was clean and laden with songs about falling in love with Jesus and promoting positive faith based values.\n\nLittle did she know that the moment I got to the CD section of the store, my eyes had already met fate. I remember seeing the cover of MXPX’s Life In General and resonating immediately and I had yet to even hear the content. On the front was a punk kid with dyed hair getting life handed to him by some butch jock with a mullet. Nothing resonated with me more at that time. The moment I stuck the record in my stereo at home and heard those first palm mutes on “Middlename” I was hooked. I don’t think I took that record out for all of 8th grade. Songs like “Doing Time” and “My Mom Still Cleans My Room” had my life figured out. The one thing that I loved and really captivated me was Mike Herrera’s ability to convey a positive message without over saturating the songs with lyrics about loving Jesus and going to church.\n\nIf I wouldn’t have discovered MXPX I probably would not have fell in love with bands like NOFX, Rancid, Lagwagon and several others. MXPX was able to introduce me to a much faster and aggressive side of punk rock that I wouldn’t have known about had I stuck with Green Day. So thanks MXPX for having such a positive influence on my life in so many ways. I definitely would not have started a band and chased my dreams without the effect your songs had on my life. Do yourselves a favor and pick up their new record Plans Within Plans. Even in 2013, Mike and Co. are still writing songs that are relevant and inspiring while still capturing and displaying what I love most about punk rock. Loud, fast and raw."
