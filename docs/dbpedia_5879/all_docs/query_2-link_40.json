        "text": "I've been using my SR4 to jam some punk lately and it seems to be working very well. One reason I bought it was that it had a good pick sound. I still have the stock slinky strings and run a light tube overdrive. So I was very curious if anybody else on here plays punk with their Musicman, and what effects, strings, etc. you use?\n\nI play mostly pop punk type stuff and my Ray always works well. I usually use the Stock slinkies but right now I have some XL's that I got on sale on it. They sound good but I think I like the Slinkies a bit more. I just run my Ray into my wireless, into a GK 1001 RB-II, no effects needed, just a pick and some speed.\n\ni pretty much play only punk... and i only use MusicMan basses.\n\nMy setup is:\n\nBass:\n\nSterling or SR4\n\nStrings:\n\nErnie Ball Stainless Steel Super Slinkys OR Ernie Ball Stainless Steel Hybrid Slinkys\n\nI'm currently leaning towards the Stainless Hybrid due to the extra thickness in the E and A strings.\n\nEQ on bass:\n\nset to flat (center notches) most of the time. Some songs ill adjust the EQ on the bass a hair here or there... just depends on what the song \"needs\".\n\nVolume on Bass: all the way up\n\nAmp:\n\nLittle Mark 2 - vintage knobs set to \"off\"\n\nthe EQ on the amp is set just about flat with a little bit of boost in the lows\n\ncab: Aguilar GS 410\n\npicks:\n\nDunlop tortex - orange\n\nThere's also some almost see thru, aged yellow colored, dunlop picks im starting to like. They have a rhino on em - i forget what they're called\n\nFor my sound the key really is to have a fresh set of Stainless steel strings (gets expensive ). this gives me a nice and crisp tone which i love.\n\nAlso - ive been playing with a pick forever... i vary my picking angle & position a lot to alter the tone and attack. This is a style thing which i really cant explain but it works for me. ummm, ya... and I play fast as hell\n\nIf anybody has a myspace page or any sound of the Ray doing punk I'd love to hear! I am also trying to get my speed up and the big Fender Triangle Picks have been working well for me. I almost can't go back to regular sized picks. I am so impressed being on the site and seeing that people use MusicMan's for any style of music.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/rerodrock\n\nMy band rerod. I used my sterling to record all that. My current setup is an Ampeg B2-R Head, a 4x12, and a 1x15, although for the recordings I just went direct into whatever pre-amp they had set up. For pedals, I just got an MXR Bass DI+, for distortion, or just a boost. I also have a BBE Sonic Stomp Maximizer, which I love (adds punch), but I haven't needed it so much since I got the MXR. And of course the Boss TU-2 (tuner). I use to use Slinky's, but I recently changed to DR's.\n\nI play punk...well celtic punk (think flogging molly or dropkick murphys). I swapped between my Fender American J-Bass and my Sterling for recordings. Here's the setup:\n\n-Fender American Jazz or Sterling (Both with Ernie Ball Super Slinkys)\n\n-Ampeg HLF410 Classic Cab\n\n-Ampeg SVT3 PRO\n\nCheck out our stuff on myspace: www.myspace.com/curbsidesaints\n\nI used the Sterling on tracks \"Never Back Down\", \"The Pub Below\" , and \"Hit The Floor\" .... \"Never Back Down\" is probably the best example of how the Sterling sounds... (there's a tiny bass solo squeezed in there ). The other tracks I used the J-Bass.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Steve\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Steve\n\nI did! It's rare that I like punk but yours is very nice, quite melodic.\n\nHave you guys tried the Dunlop Jazz III picks on bass? I've done it and I must say it turned me away from the big triangle pick, but I still prefer fingered stile with boosted treble on the EQ. I play a Jazz type five string xlong-scale bass tho. One day I'll swap that crap for an MM to match my guitar"
