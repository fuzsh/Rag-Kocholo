        "text": "Thursday | February 27\n\nWhat: The Shivas w/The Savage Blush and Slynger\n\nWhen: Thursday, 2.27, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: The Shivas were pushing the modern garage psych aesthetic forward before it became a played out quantity in the 2010s. But because the band was always weirder and willing to explore the noisier, more extreme ends of the style its music has remained refreshingly different and genre bend-y up to and including its 2019 album Dark Thoughts.\n\nWhat: SG1, Liptruce and Turner Jackson\n\nWhen: Thursday, 2.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nFriday | February 28\n\nWhitacre, photo by Brandon Johnson\n\nWhat: Susto w/Whitacre and Molly Parden\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Susto’s 2019 album Ever Since I Lost My Mind finds the indie rock band branching into more urgent and gritty songwriting territory without losing the thoughtfulness. Maybe the tenor of the times has seeped into the drive behind the new material but the band’s gorgeously languid vibes seem ticked more than a bit toward a focused intentionality with the music. Not that it lacked intensity at moments before, it’s just palpable this time out. Also on the bill is Denver-based band Whitacre. Paul Whitacre has made a name for himself since moving to the Mile High City in 2016 for his introspective yet brightly upsweeping songs. The group’s new album Seasons, out on April 17, finds its songs, produced by Joe Richmond (who has worked with Tennis and Churchill), polished and shining with a warmth and sincere optimism.\n\nWhat: Modern Leisure w/Ashley Koett and Big Dopes\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Modern Leisure’s Casey Banker’s keen ear for dynamic and entrancing pop melodies is matched only by his similar gift for sharply observed turns of phrase. Big Dopes’ 2019 album Crimes Against Gratitude is brimming with vivid portraits of life in a generation whose future has been compromised but trying to maintain a sense of hope for better times ahead without succumbing to nihilistic despair.\n\nWhat: Chuck Prophet\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Swallow Hill – Daniels Hall\n\nWhy: Chuck Prophet was one of the pioneers of alt-country as a member of Green On Red from its genre-defining 1985 album Gas Food Lodging through the early 90s. During his career as a solo artist his knack for crafting poetic imagery and dusty power pop has seemed endless. His most recent record, 2017’s Bobby Fully Died for Your Sins is a meditation on the passing of musical giants and maintaining a vision for hope in dark times.\n\nWhat: Drune w/Earthdiver and Dead Characters\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Streets Denver\n\nWhat: Youthanizer debut and Tuck Knee Tour Kick Off w/Gack, XdeadbeatX and Wolfblitzer\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhat: Luna Luna w/Retrofette and Nightlove\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhat: MxPx w/Teenage Bottle Rocket\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nSaturday | February 29\n\nWhat: Howard Jones acoustic Trio performance w/Rachael Sage\n\nWhen: Friday, 2.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Synth pop pioneer Howard Jones will perform as part of an acoustic trio for this show interpreting his iconic hits of the 80s in a format that will likely surprise. Anyone that has witnessed Jones in the more electronic incarnation of the music knows that his songwriting is at the heart of the appeal of his songs. Opening the show is Rachael Sage. The New York City-based artist has been releasing music on her own MPress Records for two decades including fourteen of her own albums distinguished by an eclectic range of sounds and styles that have informed her imaginative pop songs. He latest album Character, out March 6, came out of her time recovering from endometrial cancer throughout 2018. The record is informed by a sense of humility, realistic yet poetic assessments of life’s possibilities and horizons when facing your own mortality. Sage discards the bravado we hear too much in American music in the face of adversity, it acknowledges the frailty and fragility of the situations we may find ourselves when you can’t just magically snap back and be okay. It wisely takes a sensitive and deeply compassionate yet honest approach to every subject and reveals itself to be a deep record about life’s challenges in general whatever your situation.\n\nWhat: SPELLS (record release) w/Drakülas and People Corrupting People\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.29, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Streets Denver\n\nWhy: Denver’s SPELLS is releasing its new record Stimulants & Sedatives on Chuck Coffey’s Snappy Little Numbers imprint. In the past one might have described SPELLS as essentially a pop punk band. But on this album there’s more dissonance and grit to the music to go along with the rambunctious tunefulness that has been the hallmark of the band’s sound from the beginning. The lyrics are a sharp mix of self-awareness and self-deprecation with stories of realistic expectations rather than bullish bravado, a very adult approach that contrasts well with the raw energy of the performances.\n\nWhat: Church Fire, Grief Ritual and Limbwrecker\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.29, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bannock St. Garage\n\nWhat: The Corner Girls w/Vic N’ The Narwhals and Beau Beverage\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.29, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhat: Authority Zero w/Over Time and Muscle Beach\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.29, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nTuesday | March 3\n\nWhat: Ceschi and David Ramos w/Gregory Pepper, Midwife, Damn Selene and CFX Project\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 3.3, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Ceschi Ramos is the co-founder of Fake Four, a label putting out some of the most forward thinking hip-hop of the past decade and a half. The confessional intensity of his rapidfire vocal delivery wrapped in atmospheric beats is reminiscent of Sole, with whom he has worked, and his vivid, personal storytelling issues forth in almost pointillistic couplets like a mosaic establishing an informal, organic narrative. On the bill also is experimental hip-hop artist Damn Selene and ambient folk phenom Midwife who is set to tour the US in March and April as well an appearance at the Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands.\n\nWednesday | March 4\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: DA’AN, Corey Daggers and R A R E B Y R D $\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 3.4, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl and Lounge\n\nWhy: This typically eclectic line-up for Weird Wednesday includes a mix of electronic dance music, punk Americana and soulful hip-hop. DA’ANS is a new project that brings together the luminous vocals of Glynnis Braan of Lady of Sorrows and the electronic production and beat-making genius of Lawrence Snell, drummer of Meet the Giant, with songs and a theatrical performance that is a true synthesis of rave and darkwave. Corey Daggers often performs by himself with a guitar and on occasion with a full band. But either incarnation is a vital flavor of what might be described as dark carnival emo Americana. R A R E B Y R D $ bring a swagger, sensuality and emotional warmth to ambient beats and lyrics that are at turns playful, earthy and deeply, transformatively vulnerable.\n\nWhat: Shigeto w/Mux Mool and Venus Cruz\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 3.4, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhat: Rakim\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 3.4, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Oriental Theater\n\nThursday | January 30\n\nWho: Telefon Tel Aviv w/Steve Hauschildt\n\nWhen: Thursday, 1.30, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox\n\nWhy: On Dreams Are Not Enough, Telefon Tel Aviv delves into states of mind and existence as represented by the titles of the song: “I dream of it often,” “Standing at the bottom of the ocean,” “Mouth agape,” “Eyes Glaring” etc. The compositions combine texture and tone in a way processed to convey a sense of space and a journey into the imagination in a way to perhaps suggest that indeed merely having dreams is inadequate to having a life worth living even if we are often guided by them. Like a nod to Langston Hughes’ famous lines about a dream deferred. A dream does not, after all, occupy the same space in the psyche as conscious experiences. Songwriter Joshua Eustis invites on a journey to make these sonic spaces that might have sat in the backburner of his mind manifest. Steven Hauschildt has been crafting exquisite sonic experiences with software and analog synth for years including during his time with experimental electronic pop group Emeralds. As a solo artist his mastery of emotional colorings is impressive and his latest offering is 2019’s Nonlin.\n\nWhat: Natural Violence Tape Release Show w/Many Blessings, DJ Pop CTRL and Dem Deya Sound System\n\nWhen: Thursday, 1.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Meadowlark Bar\n\nFriday | January 31\n\nWhat: Whipporwill w/Natalie Tate\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.31, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Whipporwill’s 2019 album The Nature of Storms charts a perilous personal journey that could have ended the band as it endured a fraught tour that took it through extreme, inclement weather followed by a period of personal travails that would test anyone’s resolve to continue with something as dubiously rewarding a music often is. But the result is a dynamic set of songs that transcends expectations knowing the group has roots in folk and indie rock as its compositions are imaginative and evocative with an ear not just for melody but deep atmosphere and emotional tenor. Whipporwill doesn’t hit us with an album full of the same, tried and true dynamics, rather, a series of well developed concepts as set pieces and short stories connected by a larger narrative about life and the interconnected significance of our experiences. Natalie Tate is one of Denver’s most interesting and talented songwriters who hasn’t played around town much but her combination of musical chops and a spirit of experimentation and innovation in songcraft has branched in fascinating directions since she emerged in the local music scene several years back.\n\nWhat: Goon (album release) w/Sunk Cost, Gack and Sweet Kiss\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Goon’s Natural Evil takes modern hardcore in a much more experimental direction with the use of noise and atmospheric sounds in a way that is both pointed, intense while warping those edges and taking the angular quality of the music and splaying the dynamic in unpredictable and ultimately wilder directions. The record frankly showcases how a merely excellent hardcore band can become one that can influence more than connoisseurs of that style of music as the appeal transcends subgenre.\n\nWhat: Jacket of Spiders, Swami and Flat Earth\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.31, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: 3 Kings Tavern\n\nWhy: Jacket of Spiders includes former members of Tarmints, Twice Wilted and Cynic’s Bane. The result is surging, swirling guitar rock that is both colossal and ethereal and frankly out of step with a lot of what’s happening in Denver at the moment. Fans of the members’ previous bands as well as Space Team Electra and Bowery Electric should check out what the band is doing.\n\nWhat: Guangdong Modern Dance Company\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.30, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Newman Center\n\nWhat: Lucy Daydream w/XOXFord\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.31, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nSaturday | February 1\n\nWhat: Damn Selene album release w/R A R E B Y R D $, 3Two and Stoney Bertz\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Damn Selene has been one of the most respected hip-hop artists of the Denver underground for a handful of years in the more experimental end of that scene. The artist’s beats are rooted in noise, darkwave and industrial soundscaping paired with emotionally charged vocals taking at aim at society with honesty and a gift for combining storytelling with mythmaking and self-examination. Those qualities manifest brilliantly on the new album Nobody By That Name Lives Here Anymore. Selene’s vibrant synth work and transporting melodies vibe well with those of R A R E B Y R D $ whose blend of radical vulnerability and swagger weaves well with its own entrancing beats informed by a rich palette of sounds drawing from dub, analog synth music, classic hip-hop, noise, ambient music and whatever has caught the trio’s ear at the moment.\n\nWhat: The Heroine, Tokyo Rodeo and Stone Deaf\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.01, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: 3 Kings Tavern\n\nWhy: Just when the whole “Southern Rock” thing seems played out, rote and utterly performative, The Heroine from San Antonio is there to play up every trope with a sincerity and conviction that is impossible to mime and has to come from an honest place. The Heroine sounds a bit like a way better and non-wack version of Motley Crue circa Dr. Feelgood and performs its shows like they have something to prove to someone even if only to themselves. Tokyo Rodeo from Denver performs with a similar spirit with its own songs reflecting a fire to live an authentic and vibrant life creating the kind of music that sounds like the people making it really lived and felt deeply and aimed for the catharsis of creative expression that only comes from some form of rock and roll.\n\nWhat: The Yellnats, The Slack and Short Shorts – Winter Coat Donation Drive\n\nWhen: Saturday, 2.01, 7:45 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mutiny Information Café\n\nMonday | February 3\n\nWhat: EarthGang w/Mick Jenkins, Wynne and Jurdan Bryant\n\nWhen: Monday, 2.03, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nWhy: EarthGang’s 2019 album Mirrorland was inspired by the 1978 film The Wiz and the band ran with the surreal quality of the film and infused it into a journey into the modern American cultural and political landscape with the attendant perils, struggles and triumphs. The Atlanta-based duo excels at using the formats of jazz, sampling, rap and soul to craft music that might be called psychedelic in another musical context except it isn’t disorienting, it’s focused on lived experience and creating the world you want to see rather than escapism.\n\nWednesday | February 5\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Ruche Mere, Claudzilla, Space Jail\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 2.05, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl and Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday this month includes performances from series host Claudzilla and her strange synth pop songs and unique covers, Ruche Mère a duo that uses electronic and organic instruments including bells and improvised percussive textural sounds to create what might be described post-industrial/post-civilization found object folk and Space Jail’s IDM-esque, ambient psychedelic folk soundscapes.\n\nThursday | January 9\n\nWhat: Oryx, Cthonic Deity and Zygrot\n\nWhen: Thursday, 1.9, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: In the realm of Denver extreme metal it would be hard to find a more solid line-up this month than this. Oryx is perhaps rightfully considered a doom band but its wall of noise is a shifting, mind-altering experience that creatively uses drones and riffs to comment on the world in a way the reflects and exorcises the sense of despair at the way our economic and political system normalizes the ways in which our lives are eroded through the environment, the fake prosperity figures that hide the poverty and desperation that permeates much of society in America and elsewhere and a cultural climate that favors a cultural identity anchored to the fortunes of the world’s oligarchs. And yet it’s not a bummer, there are hopes and dreams in its grinding and harrowing aesthetic. Cthonic Deity released one of the most promising fusions of death metal and hardcore with 2019’s Reassembled in Pain. Zygrot is a crusty grindcore quartet that releases its self-titled debut in September 2019.\n\nWhat: Billy the Poet, The Maykit and Chella and The Charm\n\nWhen: Thursday, 1.9, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhat: The Milk Blossoms w/Turvy Organ and Midwife\n\nWhen: Thursday, 1.9, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nFriday | January 10\n\nWhat: Don Chicharrón, Roka Hueka, TúLips, DJ Charlie Continental, Dos Luces Brewery, benefit show for Casa de Paz & Metro Denver Sanctuary\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.10, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: 3 Kings Tavern\n\nWhy: As indicated above this is a benefit show for Casa de Paz & Metro Denver Sanctuary, organizations aiding the local immigrant populations. It features some of the the city’s best Latin music-inflected acts. Also for this show Don Chicharrón is releasing its new 7” “Valle b/w En La Gruta Del Rey De La Montaña” through Snappy Little Numbers the proceeds from the sales of which will benefit the same organizations.\n\nWhat: Space in Time, The Honey Blazer Band and Star Garbage\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.10, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhat: Empty Caskets, Piss Poor, Moon Phase, Cagemates\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.10, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhat: Daikaiju w/Lost Relics, Stone Deaf and Messiahvore\n\nWhen: Friday, 1.10, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tennyson’s Tap\n\nWhy: Daikaiju is a flame wielding, Kabuki/La Lucha Libre-looking, acrobatic, surf rock/punk spectacle of the highest order.\n\nSaturday | January 11\n\nWhat: Origami Angel, Short Fictions, Flora De Luna and Obtuse\n\nWhen: Saturday, 1.11, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Origami Angel is a band from the Washington, D.C. area that is mining a similar sonic territory as bands in the past half decade or more going beyond the neo-pop punk into a hybrid of math-y emo and indie pop. So a bit retro but at least not yet another band thinking it is discovering Laurel Canyon all over again and with earnest, heartfelt performances. Obtuse is a like-minded band from Denver whose 2019 album Who’s Askin’ is a gloriously raw and incisive examination of one’s insecurities as a normal reaction to a society and economic system seemingly designed to make everyone feel like an inadequate failure. Their songs are an acknowledgment of those anxieties and an attempt to not be completely sunk by them.\n\nWhat: New Ben Franklins and I’m a Boy 7” split release\n\nWhen: Saturday, 1.11, 10 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Long running alt-country/American band New Ben Franklins and power pop sensations I’m A Boy are releasing their split 7” tonight at The Skylark.\n\nWhat: Daikaiju w/TripLip and Today’s Paramount\n\nWhen: Saturday, 1.11, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Squire Lounge\n\nWhat: Dressy Bessy w/Pout House, Television Generation\n\nWhen: Saturday, 1.11, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhat: To Be Astronauts w/Too Many Humans, Decatur and Star Garbage\n\nWhen: Saturday, 1.11, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nSunday | January 12\n\nWhat: Total 80s Live with Bow Wow Wow w/When in Rome and The Vanilla Milkshakes\n\nWhen: Sunday, 1.12, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Bow Wow Wow is an English New Wave band assembled by then Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren in 1980 when he convinced members of Adam Ant’s band to form a new group that was fronted by 13-year-old Annabella Lwin who McLaren had heard singing along to the radio at her laundromat job. The other singer of the band in the beginning was George O’Dowd who left the group early and became famous as Boy George of Culture Club and as a solo artist. Bow Wow Wow somehow managed to break into the mainstream with hit songs like “C·30 C·60 C·90 Go!” and a lively cover of The Strangeloves’ 1965 recording of “I Want Candy.” This current version of the band will not include Lwin who hasn’t been in this iteration of Bow Wow Wow since 2013, now performing as Annabella Lwin of the original Bow Wow Wow.” So while it won’t be the original line-up except for bassist Leigh Gorman, you can hear those hits as well as When in Rome whose 1987/1988 single “The Promise” has been a staple of 80s synth pop playlists for decades. The Vanilla Milkshakes are a pop punk band with attitude and an offbeat sense of humor that will probably make the nostalgia seekers wonder how they got on the bill but end up liking a lot of the songs in spite of themselves.\n\nWednesday | January 15\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Yao Guai, Lady of Sorrows and e-scapes\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 1.15, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl and Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday this month includes ambient prog project Yao Guai, emotionally expressive darkwave solo act Lady of Sorrows and experimental synth pop composer e-scapes.\n\nWhat: Miró Quarter\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 1.15, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Newman Center (Denver University)\n\nWhat: Ceasefire, Disowned, Barking Mad, Pontius Pilate and ASALT\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 1.15, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nThursday | October 31\n\nWhat: The Legendary Pink Dots w/Orbit Service, The Drood, DJ Mudwulf and VJ Dizy Pixl\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.31, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soap Box\n\nWhy: The Legendary Pink Dots and its mystical, spectral, ambient psychedelia will turn 40 next August and is currently undertaking a tour celebrating the landmark date along with its new album, 2019’s Angel in the Detail. The new record contains elements of what has always made LPD great including entrancing atmospheres, singer Edward Ka-Spel’s poetic lyrics that articulate deep truths about the human condition and how it manifests in our lives and civilizations. It also comments on the perilous state of things in the world today and especially in “The Junkyard” and how the elites are trying to finish completing a world system that renders those of us not in that upper one percent of one percent as pieces of junk in world civilization. The surreal and beautifully disturbing music video is well worth a view. Also sharing the bill tonight is the likeminded Denver-based ambient psychedelic rock band Orbit Service which has been gracing local stages and well beyond since the mid-90s. The Drood, also from Denver, is like a dark psychedelic prog band with punk-intensity and a sense of theater and the ability to create exorcistic emotional experiences in song. DJ Mudwulf will set the mood with what is sure to be a great set for the holiday and VJ Dizy Pixl will set the visual mood as per her usual level of excellence.\n\nWhat: Wu Tang Clan w/Jedi Mind Tricks, Immortal Technique and Dillon Cooper\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.31, 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhat: T.S.O.L. w/Noogy and The Pitch Invasion\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Oriental Theater\n\nWhat: Dragondeer w/Dog City Disco and What Young Men Do\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.31, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Cervantes’ Other Side\n\nFriday | November 1\n\nWhat: Bethlehem Steel w/Gila Teen and guest\n\nWhen: Friday, 11.1, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: Bethlehem Steel has been together since 2012 but started garnering national attention for its outstanding performances at the South By Southwest festival in 2016. At that time the group had out a couple of EPs but released its debut full length Party Naked Forever in 2017. Its thrilling collision of fuzzy pop and dynamic atmospheric rock has drawn comparisons to 90s noise pop acts like Weezer and contemporary artists like Courtney Barnett and Waxahatchee. But often enough the group’s expansive, imaginative songwriting and creative ambition has resulted in some music that pushes boundaries of the loud and quiet format that many bands have adopted of late so that its songs will remind some of the emotionally stirring music of older bands like Failure, Slint and Rainer Maria. It has that kind of fire and caustic sound as well as lyrics that delve deep into the darker regions of the psyche with a defiant spirit lighting the way. In September, Bethlehem Steel released its fantastic self-titled full-length for which it is touring in support. Also on the bill is Gila Teen, the experimental post-punk band that brilliantly mixes moody atmospheres with a splintery pop punk.\n\nWhat: Yung Bae w/Birocratic and Jaguar Nights\n\nWhen: Friday, 11.1, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Dallas Cotton started making music as Yung Bae while living in Portland, Oregon but his production-based future funk started garnering him wider audiences while still a student at Oregon State University. His sound straddles that sort of 70s soul and R&B-inspired sounds and the aesthetic of modern electronic pop music. So while he references classic music it comes off with a more modern sensibility and energy. It hearkens to a previous era and the unsullied excitement of that music but in a way that couldn’t really have been accomplished at the time in terms of how he sculpts sound and edits it together. In 2019 Yung Bae released his fifth album in as many years with Bae 5.\n\nWhat: Red Wing Black Bird album release w/Plague Garden and Married a Dead Man\n\nWhen: Friday, 11.1, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Denver darkwave band Red Wing Black Bird is releasing its latest album produced by DJ Charon of Necromantic/Fenando Altonaga of industrial band eHpH.\n\nWhat: Future of Bass: smith, Mize, Wriza and Killa Nova\n\nWhen: Friday, 11.1, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Black Box\n\nWhat: Lucy Dacus w/Liza Anne and Sun June\n\nWhen: Friday, 11.1, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nSaturday | November 2\n\nWhat: Dia De Muertos celebration: Altas, Plume Varia and Los Mocochetes\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Denver instrumental rock band Altas is doing its now annual Dia De Muertos show in which the members will dress in the appropriate regalia for the occasion making the show a true event rather than just another gig. The group’s sweeping, cinematic grandeur and fiery musical pyrotechnics and mastery of mood and atmosphere is worth witnessing alone but also on the bill is psychedelic rock band Los Mocochetes and downtempo dream pop band Plume Varia and its emotionally rich and haunted compositions.\n\nWhat: The Locust w/Disposal Notice and Its Just Bugs\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: The Locust recently reconvened to bring its mutant, death metal inflected, noisy hardcore on a national tour. The group’s surreal imagery and costumes along with its equally bizarre lyrics has made it difficult to lump in with any convenient musical movement. Its Just Bugs (the apostrophe is left off) is an industrial punk hip-hop group from Colorado and just as impossible to pigeonhole.\n\nWhat: Twin Peaks w/Post Animal and Ohmme\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Twin Peaks from Chicago weathered the mid-2010s blowout of garage rock and neo-psychedelic rock that was making the underground rock scene of a certain stripe become fairly stale and performatively exciting. What helped was that Twin Peaks was writing good songs and hasn’t stayed stuck in the same sound for its entire career thus far. Its 2019 album Lookout Low sounds like an odd and interesting hybrid of power pop and the weirdo punk of The Fall at its most Lou Reed-inspired, mix in some unusual flourishes of 70s rock with nods to Peter Frampton and Thin Lizzy. All while delivering spirited and sometimes gloriously ragged performances which are much needed at a time when a sanitary quality has permeated too much modern music.\n\nWhat: Fathers, Limbwrecker, The Munsens and Muscle Beach\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhat: Dendera Bloodbath, Endometrium Cuntplow, Cau5er, Brother Saturn, Church Fire and Equine\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhat: Rocket Dust, Tokyo Rodeo and The Slack\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11.2, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glitter City\n\nSunday | November 3\n\nWhat: Vivan Girls w/Down Time, Short Shorts and Backseat Vinyl — CANCELLED\n\nWhen: Sunday, 11.3, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Vivian Girls caused a stir in the indie underground of the 2000s and 2010s with their lo-fi, noisy pop songs. The group’s ability to mix buoyant dynamics with dark, brooding moods and sounds was a fascinating contrast. The band split in 2014 with members going on to perform in La Sera, The Babies and Upset (all still going concerns). But in summer 2019 the group announced it was reforming with a new record, Memory, on the way and released in September.\n\nWhat: TR/ST w/SRSQ and DJ Slave 1\n\nWhen: Sunday, 11.3, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: TR/ST came to prominence as the new darkwave movement was coming together with a sound that seemed to come out of the then renewed interest in vintage synths, that cold, bright, moody sound of Goth-y 80s synth pop and its cousin chillwave. But Robert Alfons’ vibrant, soulful voice and imaginative soundsccaping are the key ingredients that elevated this project above many of its contemporaries. In 2019 TR/ST released The Destroyer (Part 1 and 2), a more experimental and ambient, ethereal set of songs than his previous offerings and a clear product of reassessing directions and ideas to produce something different. SRSQ (pronounced Seer Ess Que as in the lettes for the latter two) is Kennedy Ashlyn the charismatic singer formerly of brilliant dream pop band Them Are Us Too. Her 2018 album Unreality is a moody and emotionally harrowing and cathartic downtempo album that seems to have absorbed the darkness and pain of the underground world in the wake of the Ghost Ship fire and given it a voice that exorcises some of that energy.\n\nWhat: Keytar Fest IV: The Jinjas, R A R E B Y R D $ and Claudzilla\n\nWhen: Sunday, 11.3, 4 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glitter City\n\nWhy: Just like the title of the event suggests, this is a mini festival featuring all projects that incorporate keytars as an essential part of the songwriting and this includes weirdo synth punk Claudzilla and experimental hip-hop/IDM-inflected trio R A R E B Y R D $.\n\nWhat: Danny Brown w/Ashnikko and Zeeloperz\n\nWhen: Sunday, 11.3, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nWhy: Ever since the larger world outside of Detroit started cluing into Danny Brown’s genius following the release of 2010’s The Hybrid, the rapper has garnered a large cult following for his eccentric yet sharply cogent and thoughtful yet raw lyrics and production that incorporates a wide range of sounds that one hadn’t often heard in hip-hop outside of the underground and alternative circles of the 90s and early 2000s. Brown picked up where that left off and pushed things further particularly on his 2016 album Atrocity Exhibition which borrowed its title from a science fiction novel by J.G. Ballard and whose beats sounded almost like a new hybrid of industrial and rap that reflected the atmospherics as much as the textures and rhythms. With his new album, 2019’s uknowhatimsayin¿ Brown follows a similar sonic path but brings together more organic, almost found sounds with processed layers of atmosphere. Intact is his gift for surreal imagery and wordplay that gets under your skin.\n\nMonday | November 4\n\nWhat: GRÜN WASSER w/Natural Violence, French Kettle Station and Night Shift DJs\n\nWhen: Monday, 11.4, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: GRÜN WASSER is a Chicago-based electro-pop/industrial whose pulsing rhythms and dreamlike moods sound like endless nights wandering a menacing urban landscape and commenting on the culture of the nightlife. That is if the group’s new album Not OK with Things (Holodeck Records) is any indication. There is an almost claustrophobic quality to its densely atmospheric beats contrasted with Keely Dowd’s lightly echoing, ethereal vocals. French Kettle Station has been through more permutations of his sound than many artists bother to explore but of late he’s been developing a sound that’s still rooted slightly in 1980s No Wave disco and modern glitch dance pop but also influenced by 1980s adult contemporary music and its unexpectedly newly influential use and voicing of drums and vintage synths in a way that in any other contexts would be utterly wack but takes on an almost spiritual cast in certain underground electronic artists including that side of what FKS has been up to in the past year or two. His latest album, Over X Millenia takes those ideas and injects them with non-western rhythmic ideas and a New Age music aesthetic for something new yet strangely familiar. Its closest cousin that comes readily to mind is Brian Eno and David Byrne’s 1981 classic My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.\n\nTuesday | November 5\n\nWhat: HTRK w/Midwife, Echo Beds, Human Tide\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Since 2003 HTRK, originally from Australia, has been making music inspired by the brooding, otherworldly atmosphere of the films of David Lynch. Though the name of the band is pronounced “Hate Rock” it’s not so much rock except in the experimental sense as much as downtempo and ambient soundscaping. In 2010 founding musician Sean Stewart passed away leaving Nigel Yang and Jonnine Standish to carry on and as a duo HTRK has released a handful of some of the most fascinating music mixing electric music with an electronic aesthetic being made today. The group’s latest album is Venus in Leo with its exquisitely subtle dynamics and cinematic approach to its composition and sound design with lingering, impressionistic guitar riffs drifting around Standish’s hushed and soulful vocals.\n\nWhat: Kikagaku Moyo w/Minamu Deutsch\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Kikagaku Moyo from Japan is a true synthesis of 70s Krautrock, classic Japanese psychedelic rock and more traditional Japanese folk. Currently the group is touring with the like-minded Tokyo band Minami Deutsch. The group’s urgent rhythms, mesmerizing drones and hypnotic dynamics sound like what it is to travel through Tokyo and its subtle but odd mixture of old world and high tech metropolis side by side in all of the city’s giant districts. On the group’s new EP, Can’t Get There that dynamic often takes you to a place of anxiety and then release as it draws you into its irresistible groove.\n\nWhat: Jeffrey Lewis & The Voltage w/Adam Baumeister\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: A rare chance to see eccentric, genius freak folk and comic artist legend Jeffrey Lewis and his band along with local star of experimental folk and psychedelia, Adam Baumeister, head of Meep Records and former member of Navy Girls and Bad Weather California.\n\nWhat: Cannibal Corpse w/Thy Art is Murder, Perdition Temple\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhat: Arc Sol, Slugger and Gothsta\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mercury Café\n\nWhat: 1349 w/Uada and Cloak\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 11.5, 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Oriental Theater\n\nWednesday | November 6\n\nWhat: Negative Approach w/Blood Loss and Tuck Knee\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 11.6, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Negative Approach from Detroit was one of the bands out of that early wave of American hardcore than seemed particularly seething and intense and fronted by John Brannon who went on to noisy psychedelic blues band Laughing Hyenas and Easy Action. Easily one of the greatest frontmen of rock music because he seems to actually be losing his mind swept up in the moment.\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: FangFuck, Zealot and Bolonium\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 11.6, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl & Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday includes left field indie rock local supergroup Zealot and Bolonium a band inspired by Devo and which comes off like an odd combination of band, cheesy game show and Troma film.\n\nWhat: Kurt Vile and the Violators w/Dinosaur Jr\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 11.6, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: Dinosaur Jr is the missing link between gritty classic rock like Neil Young, hardcore and 90s alternative rock and more influential on modern music than is often obvious. The mixture of sheer volume with tunefulness reconciled eras of music in a way that is often taken for granted and which bands like Nirvana and other massively commercial successful bands took to topple the music industry marketing machine and culture. Apparently modern folk/psychedelic artist Kurt Vile has felt this influence and thus has Dinosaur on this tour and for its part, the members of Dinosaur Jr have continued to release music, some of the best of its career in the past decade.\n\nWhat: (Sandy) Alex G w/Indigo De Souza and Tomberlin\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 11.6, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nThursday | September 26\n\nWhat: Pink Turns Blue w/Radio Scarlet and DJ Katastrophy\n\nWhen: Thursday, 09.26, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Herman’s Hideaway\n\nWhy: Pink Turns Blue formed in Berlin in 1985. Its dark, moody atmospherics and driving bass lines meant its sound very much resonated with the post-punk of the day as it included synths in the mix and guitar chords that rang out and gave the songwriting an introspective quality. Fans of Chameleons and The Sound will probably much to like about Pink Turns Blue’s melancholic urgency and Mic Jogwer’s desperate yet resigned vocals. The group toured with Laibach in 1987 band recorded subsequent albums in Ljubljana, Slovenia smuggling in studio equipment from the West to do so. When the group moved to London in 1991 it lost some of its momentum and split in 1995. But since 2003 Pink Turns Blue has been active once again ahead of the revival and rebirth of darkwave that has been going on for the past decade. Also on the bill is Radio Scarlet, a Denver-based death rock band.\n\nWhat: Toro Y Moi wChannel Tres (DJ set)\n\nWhen: Thursday, 09.26, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhat: Animal / object, Arc Sol and Joohsup\n\nWhen: Thursday, 09.26, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Animal / object is Denver’s premier avant-garde improvisational band utilizing unconventional instrumentation. Arc Sol is proof you can be influenced by progressive rock, psychdelia and Silver Jews and refreshingly sound like none of that while bearing their mark. Joohsup is a left field hip-hop noise duo.\n\nFriday | September 27\n\nWhat: Cellista’s Transfigurations w/Sean Renner\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mercury Café\n\nWhy: Mulimedia artist Cellista recently released an album called Transfigurations with a companion book, A Listener’s Guide to Cellista’s Transfigurations, that gives the ambitious work some context. The album explores those moments in life and in one’s personal and maybe creative development when you are struck and forced to consider the moment and evolve taking in that transformational input. With the processed samples of authoritarian voices speaking to that effect is both chilling and a reminder of those times when we could have stepped in to take a different path but haven’t yet. The album seems arranged as piece of politically-charged, avant-garde literature with an elegantly composed soundtrack that deconstructs and re-synthesizes classical music, pop, hip-hop and sound design. For the live performances of Transfigurations Cellista will incorporate dance, film, music and literature for an experience like little else going on this week or any other in Denver.\n\nWhat: Babymetal w/Avatar\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Babymetal is a Japanese “kawaii metal” band whose relentless death metal is overlaid with J-pop-esque vocals and melodies. And the stage shows just like something out of a big time production of a Japanese pop band on one of the massive Saturday marathon variety shows, choreographed dance moves and matching outfits. Gimmicky, to be sure, but weird enough to be enjoyable.\n\nWhat: Dodie w/Adam Melchor\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Dodie Clark is an English singer-songwriter whose spare melodies and breathy vocals give the space for her sharply observant and poetic lyrics to develop and create vivid images in your mind of a situation and feeling, a real slice of the experience of that moment. Her 2019 album Human expands the sonic palette some while also imbuing Clark’s voice with more clarity and impact.\n\nWhat: Adrian Belew w/Saul Zonana\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: Adrian Belew is the brilliant and inventive guitarist whose solo albums are worth exploring for this imaginative songwriting. But some may remember him for his time playing in King Crimson, as a live member of Talking Heads, in Tin Machine with David Bowie or even on William Shatner’s 2004 album Has Been.\n\nWhat: Mile High Comedy Festival Presents Maria Bamford w/Aparna Nancherla and Jackie Kashian\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Paramount Theatre\n\nWhy: The Bammer is the genius, socially critical surrealist of the current era.\n\nWhat: Bellhoss tour kickoff w/Short Shorts, Mainland Break and Claire Heywood\n\nWhen: Friday, 09.27, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Bellhoss is taking off for a tour of the American West and launching that with this show including some of Denver’s most interesting indie rock bands in Short Shorts and Mainland Break. Bellhoss’ Becky Hostetler nails the anxiety and hope of modern life on her tender and earnest pop songs.\n\nSaturday | September 28\n\nWhat: John Densmore\n\nWhen: Saturday, 09.28, 2 p.m.\n\nWhere: Boulder Book Store\n\nWhy: Doors drummer John Densmore will be signing copies of his 2010 book Doors Unhinged.\n\nWhat: Dodie w/Adam Melchor\n\nWhen: Saturday, 09.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhat: Adrian Belew w/Saul Zonana\n\nWhen: Saturday, 09.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhat: Mike Watt & The Missingmen w/Slim Cessna\n\nWhen: Saturday, 09.28, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: Mike Watt is indeed the bassist singer who was a part of Minutemen and fIREHOSE and who has been playing bass in the Stooges of late. This trio includes Tom Watson who was a member of jangle-y post-punk band Slovenly and Raul Morales who also plays with Watt in Mike Watt and the Secondmen. This project combines Watson’s textured, melodic guitar style with Watt’s angular, jazz-inflected, wiry and urgent rhythms. Watt being one of the most animated and talented bass players in all of punk and rock and a sharp social critic is always worth checking out. He’s still jamming econo and the band’s tours and booking are still well within the realm of DIY in the old school and modern sense.\n\nWhat: Sway Wild w/Megan Rose Ellsworth\n\nWhen: Saturday, 09.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Walnut Room\n\nWhy: What saves Sway Wild from being the kind of “Indie” radio darling band that is the stuff of too many would-be tastemaker playlists crafted by those with fairly conventional and safe taste in music is not just Mandy Fer’s warm vocals and her and Dave McGraw’s dynamic songwriting. It’s that making up its charming melodies and playful performances is imaginative and creative instrumentation that displays their technical prowess as players channeled into zesty, tightly crafted pop songs. Currently the trio, which includes Thom Lord, is on tour in support of its self-titled, full-length debut.\n\nSunday | September 29\n\nWhat: Shibui Denver #6: Total Trash and Rowboat\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.29, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mutiny Information Café\n\nWhy: This latest edition of Shibui Denver showcases Total Trash and Rowboat. The former is a psychedelic noise pop group whose members have played with the likes of Fingers of the Sun, Fissure Mystic, Quantum Creep, Lil Slugger, The Pseudo Dates and other bands that mean little if you’ve not been paying attention to the Denver underground of the past ten years. But it also means some of the more creative musical talents in the realm of local rock music have come together to make something different from what they’ve done before. Rowboat combines literary yet deeply emotional and heartfelt lyrics with haunting atmospheres and melodies in songs that plumb the depths of human existence and the things that give meaning to our lives.\n\nWhat: Mike Watt & The Missingmen w/Slim Cessna\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.29, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nTuesday | October 1\n\nWhat: Periphery w/Veil of Maya and Covet\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Progressive metal band Periphery sounds more like a post-hardcore band than simply metal. And probably because the attack of its songs is fairly angular and driving in a way that sounds more like it comes out of a similar place of primal energy. Although there’s plenty of precision and technical prowess on display in its songs with many songs in drop C on the six-string, the group’s songs often sound like they’re about to fly off the rails. Sometimes bands with those types of sounds and dynamics take themselves way too seriously but Periphery’s 2019 album is called Periphery IV: Hail Stan. There is a song called “Chvrch Bvrner” and references to the supernatural and animals. So someone in the band, probably everyone involved, has a healthy sense of humor and an ability to see its music in a way that evolves organically than the sort of pure logic level that is often assumed with the genre.\n\nWhat: Plague Vendor w/No Parents and The Ghoulies\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Plague Vendor came off as a fairly straightforward melodic punk band early on. But at this point, and particularly on its new album By Night, the band from Whittier, California has evolved its sound into something more akin to glammy post-punk without sacrificing its fiery energy.\n\nWhat: An Evening With Paula Cole\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Buffalo Rose\n\nWhy: Paula Cole made her popular music bonafides as an act on Peter Gabriel’s Secret World Live tour from 1993-1994. Her musical background includes having studied jazz singing at Berklee College of Music and in her dusky, soulful vocals you hear that training put to good use. In 1996 her second album This Fire yielded the hit single “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?” and like anything popular it got played ad infinitum making it easy to dismiss Cole like any other pop act put forth by the music industry as it tried to find hitmakers in the collapse of the alternative music explosion of the early 90s. But Cole, turns out, has always been a strikingly powerful performer and her performances for the final Lilith Fair tour in 1998 undoubtedly won her fans who had written her off previously. Currently Cole is performing a string of intimate shows in support of her 2019 record Revolution.\n\nWhat: Ghosts of Glaciers album release w/In the Company of Serpents and Echo Beds\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Denver-based progressive metal/post-rock trio Ghosts of Glaciers returns with its new album The Greatest Burden released through Translation Loss Records. More than even previous releases, the group conceives of this arc of songs in cosmological time from the primordial oceans that spawned life (the opening track titled “Primordial Waters” through the inevitability of the decay and collapse of the eons long cycle of life and the fall into the chaos that will once again spawn new worlds and universes. The music charts that path with slow, dynamic arcs that dive into furious, churning progressions and sublime, swimming melodies. To celebrate the release of this new record the band will share the stage with local doom juggernauts In the Company of Serpents who have some of the most compelling and powerful art in the local scene and industrial post-punk legends Echo Beds.\n\nWhat: The Waterboys\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: The Waterboys came out of Edinburgh, Scotland with a blend of Celtic folk and post-punk and made inroads into the world of 80s “college rock.” While not as dark and overtly political as an arguably like-minded band like New Model Army, The Waterboys extolled the virtues of a universal mysticism based in nature and how that connects everyone. Fans of The Hothouse Flowers and The Alarm will definitely find much to like about The Waterboys who are now touring in support of their 2019 album Where the Action Is.\n\nWhat: Prissy Whip, Moon Pussy, New Standards Men\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Prissy Whip is an eruptive industrial noise rock band with the emphasis on noise and breakneck dynamics. Who to compare them to other than maybe Melt Banana? New Standards Men is the kind of weirdo experimental metal band you get when the people in the band are into way more music than what you might think listening to what they’re doing. Probably into Naked City as much as the Locust and Neurosis. Moon Pussy combines gnarly song dynamics with a thorny tunefulness that is impossible to ignore making it one of the most interesting bands out of Denver right now.\n\nWhat: Titus Andronicus w/Control Top\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWednesday | October 2\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: After the Carnival, Cop Circles, Enji w/Cabal Art\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.02, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: No Wave disco artist Cop Circles will bring plenty of the weird this time around for this edition of the monthly showcase of unusual and outside music curated by Claudia Woodman.\n\nWhat: Wheelchair Sports Camp w/Dry Ice and Rocket Dust\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.02, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Wheelchair Sports Camp is a brilliant combination of jazz chops in the live end of the music and experimental beatmaking and playful, conscious wordplay on the production and MC end. And a powerful and compelling live band to boot. This is the group’s launch show for its upcoming tour.\n\nWhat: Loving\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.02, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Victoria, British Columbia’s Loving turns the sort of introspective, light psychedelic pop sound on a different angle because its music really does sound like the band is going to take you on a trip to some otherworld realm of elegance where time and space are interactive concepts driven by your imagination so better brush up on your creative skills before sitting down to one of the band’s trippy folk records.\n\nWhat: Kishi Bashi w/Takénobu\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.02, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhat: The Pharcyde w/Ladygang (Weds) and Wes Watkins (Thurs)\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.02 and Thursday 10.03, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox\n\nThursday | August 29\n\nWhat: DJ Fresh Kill, Earth Control Pill, Cop Circles and H-Lite\n\nWhen: Thursday, 08.29, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: This is a benefit show for the CRFW Fund which supports the body of work of the late Colin Ward and which “assists artists via grants and other means of support.” Ward would have turned 29 on this August 29 and the artists on the bill were friends and creative comrades of the artist and musician. A lot of high energy electronic dance music from DJ Fresh Kill and H-Lite, conceptual No Wave afrobeat post-disco from Cop Circles and the chill soundscaping of Earth Control Pill.\n\nWhat: The Sugar Hill Gang w/Furious 5 and White Fudge & The Antagonist\n\nWhen: Thursday, 08.29, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: For a lot of people The Sugar Hill Gang was the first rap band. But hip-hop pre-dated that by some years beginning with the soundsystem parties thrown by DJ Kool Herc. The Sugar Hill Gang was probably the earliest, commercially successful rap group with its 1979 hit song “Rapper’s Delight.” Also on this bill is the Furious 5 who, with Grandmaster Flash, had been a pioneering hip-hop crew before The Sugar Hill Gang hit the charts. So this is a bit like getting to see some of the earliest days of hip-hop as we know it in one show.\n\nFriday | August 30\n\nWhat: Meek, Future Scars, Kali Krone, Madelyn Burns\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Meek mixes live drums with 31G and-esque processed vocals and electronic beats for a result that’s somewhere between noise and industrial. But really not like much except for maybe, maybe, solo USAISAMONSTER minus guitar. Santa Fe’s Future Scars is pretty much impossible to pigeonhole except to say it’s a rock or a pop band but it has the cutting, hard hitting guitar drive of metal, the delicacy and texture of the most tender indie rock, the soaring vocals of some torch song pop and post-punk rhythmic drive. And that’s for one song. Other times, meditative, heavy drone with introspective melodies like Emma Ruth Rundle. Kali Krone’s dreamy slowcore seems about perfect for the swelter cool off. Madelyn Burns’ spooky singer-songwriter should appeal to fans of early Grouper.\n\nWhat: Mutual Benefit w/Paw Paw and Card Catalog\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Mutual Benefit’s moody, soundscape-y pop songs are like getting a glimpse into someone’s having processed some deep thinking and distilled it to the poetic essence of those collective feelings. Loosely in the realm of Americana but with some great sound collage in the songwriting. Paw Paw is the project of former Woodsman drummer Eston Lathrop. Sort of ambient, sort of organic electronic pop, experimental solo guitar and synth songs to transport you to another, better place for a half an hour or so.\n\nWhat: Nuancer LP release w/SSIIGGHH, Dr3aMC@$T, Larians and Andy AI\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Daniel DiMarchi is the genius bass player in the great dream pop band Tyto Alba and great indie rock band Oxeye Daisy. But part of what makes him a great bass player is his true ear for tonality and composition which he brings to his experimental electronic pop project Nuancer and this is the release show of I Hardly Know Her. Also on the bill is a rare show from Larians, the solo project of former Male Blonding guitarist/singer Noah Simons. Though a guitarist, Simons has long had an interest in left field and forward thinking electronic music like Burial and Larians is the manifestation of that interest. And tonight Larians releases the first EP Looming Boy. If Nicolas Jaar made trap it might sound something like that.\n\nWhat: I Hate It Here, Causer, $addy, Eraserhead Fuckers and Kid Mask\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Thought//Forms Gallery\n\nWhy: The noise/heavy processed dance ambient/industrial show of the week. Granted the only one but heavy hitters like noise rapper Eraserhead Fuckers, hypnogogic environment sculptor Kid Mask and post-Goth ambient noise genius $addy alone make this a noteworthy lineup.\n\nSaturday | August 31\n\nWhat: The Velveteers UK tour kickoff w/Boot Gun, The Kinky Fingers and Bitter Suns\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: The Velveteers is a rock and roll trio from Denver whose live show is surprisingly powerful, forceful and grippingly emotional. The group is headed to the UK for a tour and this is the kickoff show with some of Denver’s other great, local, non-subgenre-specific rock bands including The Kinky Fingers who may be in the garage psych vein but its songwriting so tight and poignant it’s strikingly original.\n\nWhat: To Be Astronauts, Meet the Giant, The Center and Bad Britton\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Hard rock band To Be Astronauts is relasing its “Thoughts and Prayers” single tonight. Hard rock is a little generic a term. So yeah, in their sound you’ll hear a bit of industrial rock, grunge and anthemic punk without being stuck on any of that. And other like-minded bands are on the bill including Meet the Giant who, despite their ethereal and moody atmospheric rock gets heavy and driving often enough that they’ll fit in here.\n\nSunday | September 1\n\nWhat: Molly Burch w/Jackie Cohen and Bellhoss\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Molly Burch has the kind of classic pop voice that many try to imitate but few nail the cadence and tonality that she seems to do so effortlessly. Her songs are intricate and delicate but her poetic observations sharp and illuminating. Jackie Cohen taps into an earlier era of music but her sound is more like a strange strain out of ABBA and 60s girl groups. Bellhoss is in good company here with Becky Hostetler’s idiosyncratic storytelling and inventive guitar work somewhere betwixt Dinosaur Jr, Edith Frost and Joanna Newsom. Yeah, let’s go with that until a better description of this unique songwriter and performer comes to mind. Hostetler will also make all the charmingly awkward jokes on stage so you don’t have to.\n\nWhat: The Wes Watkins (EP release) w/Dr3@m Ca$t and Snubluck\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Wes Watkins is the brilliant trumpet player and vocalist whose talents have brought grace, cool and imagination to a broad swath of Denver music including his stint in Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats. But The Other Black, playing with poet, mystic, avant-garde hip-hop songwriter Bianca Mikahn, Wheelchair Sports Camp and others? His track record speaks for itself and tonight he’s releasing his new EP, a collection of jazz-inflected pop songs that seem to be streaming from a time in the future while sounding like it had to be recorded in the past putting Watkins out of time thus timeless, as seems appropriate for his soulful musical stylings.\n\nTuesday | September 3\n\nWhat: Shonen Knife w/Me Like Bees and Sexy Pistils\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Shonen Knife is the legendary Japanese punk bands whose roots go back to the late 70s when not many women were playing music in Japan much less in a punk band. Its songs are often about fanciful and mythical things but its songwriting is sharp, powerful and uplifting.\n\nWhat: Holy Grove (PDX), DØNE (SLC, ex-SubRosa), and Shepherd\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tooey’s Off Colfax\n\nWhy: A kind of doom metal show including the latest project from former SubRosa drummer Andy Patterson, DØNE.\n\nWhat: Ian Svenonius DJ set / Dream Wish of a Casino Soul Closing Party\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Pon Pon\n\nWhy: Philosopher, brilliant social commentator, media mogul and genius frontman (The Make-Up, Nation of Ulysses, Weird War, Chain and the Gang etc.) Ian Svenonius will hold court with one of his unique DJ sets for the closing party for the art exhibit Dream Wish of a Casino Soul.\n\nWednesday | September 4\n\nWhat: SunnO))) w/David Pajo and BIG BRAVE\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 09.04, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: SunnO))) creates such intense, dense frequencies and slow dynamics with, assuming Atilla Csihar will be on hand, otherworldly vocals that run a broad spectrum of tonality that your brain may work differently after the show. Calling it “extreme metal” just doesn’t cut it as it’s a truly ritualistic experience and so engulfing you feel like you’ve really been through something by the end. David Pajo is the iconic guitarist of Slint, The For Carnation and a host of other bands including a short stint in the death metal group Dead Child. His solo material runs a fairly wide range of sounds and emotions and as Papa M he recently toured with Mogwai. Not to be missed. BIG BRAVE is a cathartic collision of industrial, drone metal and emotional exorcism.\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Gothsta, Dorian, Hypnotic Turtle Radio DJ, Cabal Art\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 09.04, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl and Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday is the monthly musical showcase that lives up to its name and curated by Claudia Woodman. This time she will be performing in her persona of Gothsta and for this performance she says, “Gothsta covers goth songs on the melodica that have some link to climate change-related themes, because Gothsta is depressed about global warming. Gothsta will have some extra special content that has to do with the Amazon burning and will be joined by Hypnotic Turtle’s Diablo Montalban for dueling melodicas/improv along with noise loops generated for this performance.” It’s rare that anything lives up to hype like that but this show probably will.\n\nThursday | August 1\n\nWhat: Line Brawl (final show), Potato Pirates, C.O.ntrol T.V., Remain & Sustain and Mindz Eye\n\nWhen: Thursday, 08.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mutiny Information Café\n\nWhy: Line Brawl was one of the best hardcore acts out of Denver’s scene in the most recent wave of that sort of music. Its short, sharp dynamics and fit a lot of fury into songs that built up and ended with all but the sparest self-indulgence cut out. Catch them for the last time with some other heavy hitters in the local punk scene.\n\nWhat: Part Time w/Gary Wilson and French Kettle Station\n\nWhen: Thursday, 08.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Part Time has been around for over twenty years at this point, probably, and its music sounds like it began in the late 80s inspired by The Power Station gone synth pop. Could be outsider, definitely eccentric. Also on the bill is Gary Wilson who is a bit of an underground music legend going back to the 1970s. But as a teenager in the late 60s he met and hung out with avant-garde composer John Cage and his own music, however pop-oriented some of it may be, has retained a decidedly experimental edge. In the early 80s he quit music and in the mid-90s was cited by Beck as an influence. Before quitting music he received fan mail from the likes of The Residents. And around the turn of the century Wilson was coaxed into returning to playing his own music and has been writing and occasionally playing out since and this is a rare opportunity to get to see this utterly unique pop songwriter live. Opening the show is synth, drums and guitar prodigy French Kettle Station whose Arthur Russell-esque synth pop songs are delivered with an earnest, passionate intensity.\n\nFriday | August 2\n\nWhat: My Morning Jacket w/Warpaint\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.02, 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: My Morning Jacket is doing a two night run at Red Rocks again this year. The band has enjoyed some mainstream success for a fairly varied body of work that’s genre-bending with elements of folk, psychedelic rock, Americana and alternative rock. Opening the show is Warpaint, a band whose music has also spanned a broad range of sounds from its early post-punk-y/shoegaze-y sound to its more current phase where the band is writing the music collectively and influenced by the sonics of production and hip-hop as much as any rock that has influenced the group’s sound.\n\nWhat: Nina Storey w/Jeremy Dion\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.02, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Soiled Dove Underground\n\nWhy: Nina Storey’s powerful voice imbues her eclectic music with a warmth and energy that can be lacking in the realm of the blues, jazz and pop singer-songwriters. Her versatility as a songwriter has resulted in a rich and varied body of work. Years ago Storey was a staple of the Denver music scene but has since branched out and garnered a much wider audience.\n\nSaturday | August 3\n\nWhat: My Morning Jacket w/Amo Amo\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.03, 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: See above for My Morning Jaket. Amo Amo is sort of a psychedelic dream pop band but one that sounds like it came up listening to a lot of surf rock, Laurel Canyon pop and Linda Ronstadt.\n\nWhat: French Kettle Station tour kickoff w/DJ Pop Ctrl, Birth, Break Dancing Ronald Reagan and Horse Girl\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.03, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: French Kettle Station is headed off on tour to take his emotionally charged and passionate synth pop/yacht rock hybrid to places that could use a shot in the arm of enthusiasm in this era of seeming cultural exhaustion.\n\nSunday | August 4\n\nWhat: Murder By Death\n\nWhen: Sunday, 08.04, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Green Russell (1422 Larimer St.)\n\nWhy: Murder By Death has reliably been putting out thought-provoking poetic albums of wiry, energetic Americana having come up through 90s punk. But its 2018 album The Other Shore finds the band diving into inner space and finding new dark corners of the psyche to bring to light in its inimitable style but with a shade more introspection and atmospheric flourish.\n\nTuesday | August 6\n\nWhat: Stef Chura w/French Vanilla and Bellhoss\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 08.06, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Stef Chura honed her gritty songwriting for years in Ypsilanti, Michigan and Detroit, doing home recordings and playing in friends’ bands all the while, before releasing Messes in 2017 through Urinal Cake Record. Sure there’s some sculpted fuzz in the guitar and bass but she doesn’t come off like she’s drawing direct inspiration from 90s rock but more from the kind of noise and garage rock of the 2000s, bands like Tyvek, Times New Viking and maybe even some of Jay Reatard’s various projects. Her songwriting has that similar kind of off-the-cuff, splintery quality that sounds like it could come unhinged yet focused. Her 2019 album Midnight, out on Saddle Creek Records, finds Chura vividly sketching situations and people in short lines and bouncy yet flowing dynamics that wed contemplation with embracing the feelings of the moment. Chura also goes off the map throughout her songs so that the pace never gets tedious and her use of sound always imaginative and evocative.\n\nWhat: Everything Is Terrible\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 08.06, 7 and 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Sie Film Center\n\nWhy: The people behind the brilliantly surreal and irreverent video blogging site/channel Everything is Terrible is bringing its show on tour including a stop at Sie Film Center for a live multi-media performance that will include the puppets, bizarre characters, skids and the sacrifice of Jerry Maquire VHS tapes to the group’s now massive collection that will one day permanently reside in a pyramid in the desert. Strange stuff and we need more inspired, intentional, creative weirdness in these times.\n\nWhat: Action Beat (UK, members of The Ex), Opening Bell (NYC) and New Standards Men\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 08.06, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glitter City\n\nWhy: Action Beat includes G.W. Sok, former vocalist of The Ex and is a noise rock band with some free jazz structures, frantic, relentless stuff. Opening Bell is a New York City-based duo comprised of Armando Morales and M. Thomas Reisinger. The latter was based in Denver for years where he was in some of the most forward thinking and strange bands of the time like the experimental post-hardcore band Motheater, processed guitar/bass/vocals noise soundscape group Epileptinomicon and math-y noise drum, bass, vocals and synth duo Mjolniir DXP. Opening Bell sounds like a further trip into processing generated sounds into unsettling yet somehow soothing layers of ambient noise. New Standards Men is an experimental guitar group who mix doom-y metal with Krautrock-esque prog. Targets is a noisier than usual hardcore band.\n\nWhat: Flume w/JPEGMAFIA, Slowthai and Collin McKenna\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 08.06, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Harley Streten got started producing music at age thirteen with a program he got in a box of cereal but by the end of his teens in 2010 he began making much more sophisticated house music as HEDS (his initials). As Flume Streten was making electronic dance music that seemed to push the boundaries of the realm of EDM with he seemed to most associated. His compositions are always more imaginative and bring together sounds that one doesn’t often hear in the genre and his production, whatever tools and methods he’s using, isn’t focused on technique, which he has already mastered, but on the emotional flavor of the sounds and how they fit into a bigger arc of feeling across the course of a song. His latest EP, 2019’s Quits, showcases his knack for creative hip-hop beats as well. Also on this tour is JPEGMAFIA whose pointed political and experimental hip-hop is informed as much by weirdo industrial groups like Throbbing Gristle as it is 90s hip-hop and pop.\n\nWednesday | August 7\n\nWhat: Flume w/JPEGMAFIA, Slowthai and Collin McKenna\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 08.07, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: See above for Flume and JPEGMAFIA.\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Succulent, Mt. Illimani and Full Bleed\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 08.07, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday at its new home at Bowman’s Vinyl Lounge will feature sad, sometimes acoustic songs by Randall Chambers as Mt. Illimani. He was in the garage rock band The Carnivores and post-punk group Phenobarbital for those who were fortunate enough to catch either. Full Bleed is sort of an instrumental noisy guitar/prog band.\n\nThursday | June 27\n\nWhat: Earth w/Helms Alee\n\nWhen: Thursday, 06.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Earth is as much an influential and pioneering drone metal band as it is an avant-garde blues folk group imbued with mystical overtones. It’s 2019 album Full Upon Her Burning Lips finds the trio channeling more than the usual measure of its crawling, Black Sabbath-esque gloom. Seeing the live show it’s always fascinating to see how Adrienne Davies moves in an orchestrated string of slow sweeping moves and fast, accenting flourishes as Dylan Carlson and their collaborators of the moment drone with a smoky fluidity.\n\nWhat: Meet the Giant, The Jinjas, Monty O’Blivion and Zealot\n\nWhen: Thursday, 06.27, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Thought//Forms Gallery\n\nWhy: Zealot would be a Mountain Goats cover band but Luke Hunter James-Erickson would find that too rote so he injects his own eclectic tastes into the songwriting. Recently released the “Snake Goddess” single, a typically eccentric, high energy, angular indie rock gem. Meet the Giant, informed by electronic music and hip-hop beat-making, write and perform deeply evocative, brooding rock songs that maybe now would overlap with the whole darkwave thing except that Meet the Giant often crosses over into the realm of hard rock in a way most of those bands don’t.\n\nWhat: Cholo Goth Night featuring Dave Parley of Prayers\n\nWhen: Thursday, 06.27, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Streets Denver\n\nWhy: Just like it says, Cholo Goth Night at Streets Denver with Dave Parley of Cholo Goth and spinning Darkwave and Goth for the evening. When this event happens in the Los Angeles area and select other cities Parley brings in other darkwave musicians of note to guest a set but not for tonight.\n\nFriday | June 28\n\nWhat: The Kinky Fingers w/Vic N’ the Narwhals and Colfax Speed Queen\n\nWhen: Friday, 06.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Now that the Denver “party rock” scene has withered away and garage psych/surf is going the way of pop punk in the early 2000s only the strong and more interesting survive. In the case of these three bands it’s partly because their songwriting was always good and their individual sounds not so susceptible to the blowout of trendiness. Each has also evolved.\n\nWhat: Tyto Alba and Steele Douglas\n\nWhen: Friday, 06.28, 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Museum of Contemporary Art Denver\n\nWhy: Tyto Alba is always surprisingly evocative with music coming from the tender places of the psyche and coloring the tones in warm, incandescent tones and hypnotic rhythms. Seeing them on a rooftop while a thunderstorm threatens to hover in but never does? Seems symbolic and entirely appropriate.\n\nWhat: Blue October w/Mona\n\nWhen: Friday, 06.28, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Blue October has been around for nearly a quarter of a century now and its career has crossed over from the old way of major labels and the album release cycle to the modern mess and disarray of the industry now that offers bands to connect directly to an audience more so than ever before but to earn far less for their efforts. That the group has weathered that period is impressive itself. Oddly enough its own style of power pop seemingly inspired by late 80s proto-alternative rock like Icehouse and The Outfield and their dramatic presentation of being a bit on the outs of true emotional fulfillment but yearning for that special connection with another human with music that is a little too triumphant in tone and uplifting to be sad bastard music. But Blue October didn’t stay trapped in a past style and its newer music reflects a diversity of newer influences.\n\nWhat: Primal Birth: Hotpiss, Drume, Eyeface, Padfut, Worldwide Dungeon, DJ 7 Heads\n\nWhen: Friday, 06.28, 10 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: A bit of a weirdo underground techno show that starts late and goes late like a rave.\n\nSaturday | June 29\n\nWhat: Westword Music Showcase\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.29, 12 p.m.\n\nWhere: Golden Triangle Neighborhood\n\nWhy: This is the longest running music festival of its type in Denver. Held on just one day in the Golden Triangle neighborhood near the Westword offices off Tenth Ave and Broadway, it is arguably the most concise way all year to see a broad spectrum of the local scene without having to walk too far. This year’s line-up includes several of the local luminaries. Here is a list of see-if-you-can acts at each of the stages and a given set time. Tastes will vary and I’m certainly no expert on big chunks of the local music world.\n\nBreckenridge Brewery Stage\n\n12:25 YaSi\n\n6:10 Jai Wolf\n\nWhite Claw Stage\n\n7:20 CHVRCHES\n\nVinyl Main\n\n12:50 Techno Allah\n\n2:30 Erin Stereo\n\n#vybe\n\n12:50 Venus Cruz\n\n6:40 Lady Gang\n\n7:30 RARE BYRD$\n\nStoney’s Main\n\n12:35 Gora Gora Orkestar\n\n5:35 Wes Watkins\n\n7:15 Roka Hueka\n\n8:05 Los Mocochetes\n\nBar Standard\n\n12:50 Hail Satan\n\n2:30 Ghosts of Glaciers\n\n5:50 Fathers\n\n6:40 Plasma Canvas\n\n7:30 Cheap Perfume\n\nTemple/Mirus Gallery\n\n3:20 Starjammer\n\nStoney’s South\n\n1:40 Brianna Straut\n\n2:30 Bevin Luna\n\n5:50 Florea\n\nThe Church\n\n12:00 eHpH\n\n2:30 Ramakhandra\n\n5 Vic n’ the Narwhals\n\n5:50 Spirettes\n\n6:40 The Hollow\n\n100% Agave\n\n1:40 Bret Sexton\n\n5:50 Los Dog Ensemble\n\n6:40 The Maybe So’s\n\n7:30 Joshua Trinidad Trio\n\nWhat: PUP w/Ratboys and Beach Bunny\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.29, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: PUP started making waves a handful of years ago outside its hometown of Toronto, Ontario among aficionados of pop punk and emo who missed that brashly confessional style of songwriting before the music hit maximum saturation level in the early-to-mid 2000s. When the band began in 2010 a quasi-movement was under way across the North American continent in making fun, melodic punk that was raw and expressive. With PUP and others the key difference was embracing the relatively unrefined side of that songwriting and how that opened possibilities for the music to go where it will rather than fall directly in a worn out style. This has given PUP’s songwriting a freshness that even if at first it seems completely within the realm of standard pop punk. Its new record, 2019’s Morbid Stuff, arguably its best to date, revealed the influence of the more vital garage punk and 2000s lo-fi noise rock on its sound. Like the Reatards and perhaps No Age. Its irreverent spirit and deft local cultural references that are relatable to people who experience similar social phenomena in their own cities makes for a consistently endearing listen.\n\nWhat: Luxury Hearse, Timelord SFX and blank human\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.29, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tennyson’s Tap\n\nWhy: Luxury Hearse combines the forces of blank human’s ambient/noise sound sculpting and Psychic Secretary’s beat-driven experimental electronic music. What to call it? Some might think industrial because of its sometimes sharp edges but it’s more in the vein of edgier yet dream-like dance music.\n\nWhat: 5th Annual Colorado Goth Fest: Suicide Commando and Læther Strip w/Offerings to Odin, The Union, The Midnight Marionettes, eHpH and WitchHands\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.29, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: This edition of the Colorado Goth Fest features headliners who are significant and one might say pioneering artists in the realm of EBM with Suicide Commando and Læther Strip. The local acts are a fairly diverse group as well including death rock band WitchHands from Colorado Springs and Denver’s own EBM/electro-post-punk duo eHpH.\n\nWhat: Blue October w/Mona ogdentheatre.com/events/detail/369899\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.29, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: For Blue October see above for 6.28.\n\nMonday | July 1\n\nWhat: Culture Abuse w/Tony Molina, Young Guy, Dare, Regional Justice Center and Cadaver Dog\n\nWhen: Monday, 07.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Culture Abuse has big melodic hooks for a band that came up through the milieu of garage punk. It’s 2018 album Bay Dream greatly expanded its range as a band both tonally, dynamically and emotionally as it’s informed by a sensitivity to the inevitability of the death of those close to you and a wry sense of humor and irony. After all Culture Abuse has a song called “Dave’s Not Here (I Got The Stuff Man)” referencing the classic Cheech & Chong skit. While there’s plenty of wiry punk energy behind the material, especially live, it’s really more of a great power pop record. Tony Molina got started in music playing in hardcore bands but his solo work is more in line with jangle pop and C86 with a sprinkling of The Byrds. His own 2018 record Kill the Lights wouldn’t have been out of place in the same musical realm as Teenage Fanclub circa 1992. Except with more folk-inflected, introspective songwriting throughout.\n\nWhat: Muscle Beach, Buildings (MN) and Simulators\n\nWhen: Monday, 07.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Streets Denver\n\nWhy: Buildings form Minneapolis is a vital cross between a math-y noise rock and post-hardcore. Muscle Beach is of similar mind but its own version of post-hardcore is a splintery assault on the senses that drags you down emotional pathways that purge angst and personal darkness – all done with a cathartic sense of joy. Simulators are an angular noise rock duo whose music is both cutting and unhinged yet mathematically precise. It’s always an interesting contrast.\n\nWednesday | July 3\n\nWhat: Bud Bronson + the Good Timers, The Right Here, Bad Licks, DJ Sara Splatter\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Bud Bronson + The Good Timers are always surprisingly good. Its earnest power pop sounds like it’s of today but has a quality and a vibe that is reminiscent of the stories and sentiments one heard in the music of late 70s/early 80s Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty. Also on the bill is Bad Licks who somehow do a kind of psychedelic blues rock that is legitimate and high energy because good songwriting transcends pre-conceptions.\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesdayl: Total Trash, Pretty Loud, Klaus Dafoe\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.01, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl\n\nWhy: Total Trash is a band comprised of luminaries of Denver’s indie rock scene going back nearly two decades and yet it’s not all middle aged people. If you remember Fissure Mystic, Fingers of the Sun and Lil’ Slugger, it’s people from those bands. It’s psychedelic, shoegaze-y jangle pop is transporting yet relatable and down to earth. Klaus Dafoe is an instrumental band that collides together 2000s math rock, weirdo punk and indie pop for a sound that is familiar yet unusual.\n\nWhat: Pale Sun, Palehorse/Palerider, Random Temple and Grass\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Palehorse/Palerider’s drummer Nathan Marcy said to bring earplugs. Good idea, because his own group is the kind of doom/shoegaze/dark desert psych band that makes beautifully dark, atmospheric, consciousness expanding music with ritual/tribal flourishes that is, yes, in fact, quite loud. In good company with gritty psych band Grass and Pale Sun. The latter’s dreamy yet dense rock music will take you to a different psychological space than the one with which you walked into the show. Includes former members of Bright Channel, Space Team Electra and Snake Rattle Rattle Snake.\n\nFriday | May 31\n\nWhat: Hieroglyphics w/Rap Noir, Stoney Hawk, S.A.V.E.1, Mike Wird, LoS, Stonewall BLVD\n\nWhen: Friday, 05.31, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nWhy: Hieroglyphicsfrom Oakland, California and have long been one of the most influential groups in underground hip-hop. Comprised of Del the Funky Homosapien, Casual, Pep Love, Domino, DJ Toure and the four members of Souls of Mischief (Phesto, A-Plus, Opio nd Tajai), Hieroglyphics operate in a way that’s classic, old school hip-hop, composing using a sort of free form jazz style with sampling and vocals and more experimental production and the feel of a 70s exploitation film but one where maybe the music was made by a Gil Scott-Heron and Lee Scratch Perry collaboration. This show will include all original members so you’ll get to see some of the sharpest and most deft wordplay in the game.\n\nWhat: Chromeo, Thievery Corporation, Big Freedia, Adeline, Peanut Butter Wolf\n\nWhen: Friday, 05.31, 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Electro soul stars Chromeo seem to bring their bombastic, weirdo new wave pop to Red Rocks every summer and consistently bring artists that will push their fans’ collective music brains beyond their current bounds. This time basically co-headlining with downtempo dub duo Thievery Corporation. More on the outside of the loose realm of music in which the aforementioned operate are Big Freedia and Peanut Butter Wolf. The former is an icon of New Orleans sissy bounce. Which is a really abstract way of saying that Big Freedia is a charismatic and highly energetic performer whose performances blur the line between sissy bounce, noisy industrial dance and a kind of what might be called punk dub. It’s impossible to ignore and may alienate some people with how strange it is to some sensibilities but also one of the most powerful things you’ll get to see at Red Rocks this summer. Peanut Butter Wolf is the founder of experimental hip-hop/electronic music/post-punk imprint Stones Throw, which has regularly issued some of the most fascinating music of the past 23 years.\n\nSaturday | June 1\n\nWhat: Goth Prom 4 featuring Assemblage 23, DJs Kilgore, Slave1 and Dutch Confetti\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: EXDO Events Center\n\nWhy: This year’s edition of Goth Prom will be headlined by EBM/Future Pop legend Assemblage 23. The Seattle-based group has managed to consistently make emotionally honest and compelling music in a realm of industrial dance that is often basically unconscious self-parody that aims to be edgy and dark but misses the mark more often than not. At least Assemblage 23 songs are well-written and seem more aimed to evoke a headspace and mood rather than adherence to tropes.\n\nWhat: Dead Milkmen w/Granny Tweed\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Dead Milkmen were an irreverent punk band from a time when a lot of punk and hardcore was taking itself entirely too seriously. But Dead Milkmen stretched the boundaries of 80s punk by observing few conventions beyond an iconoclastic spirit.\n\nWhat: Painting With Statue, Echo Beds, DJ Pop CTRL and Animal / object\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Painting With Statue is a trio from California that makes noise via what sounds like analog field recording manipulation, sampling and raw low end and white noise. Animal / object is Colorado’s premier avant-garde spontaneous composition band. Who knows what DJ Pop CTRL will be this time other than weirdo folk pop. Echo Beds rarely plays now due to work on its new record so here’s a now rare chance to see the organic-industrial, noisy post-punk legends in the flesh and steel.\n\nWhat: Places Back Home w/Spirettes, Everignite, Random Temple\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhat: Peanut Butter Wolf w/DJ A-L\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox\n\nWhat: Esmé Patterson w/Carsie Blanton\n\nWhen: Saturday, 06.01, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Leavitt Pavillion\n\nSunday | June 2\n\nWhat: Summitus Kitharlogus\n\nWhen: Sunday, 06.02, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: A left of field guitar mini fest with performances by or featuring: Weasel Tears, Equine, Amos Helvey, Adam Selene, Lepidoptera, Farrrell Lowe, Joe Mills, Sean Patrick Faling-sonic friction guitarworks, Prayer Hands, Death In Space, Saduwu, Brother Saturn, Sean Mlekush, Space Geist, Bradley Franlik Santulli, Broken Guitar Ensemble, BentonamO, bios+a+ic, Night Grinder.\n\nWhat: Whiskey Orphans, Slow Poisoner and Universal Devils\n\nWhen: Sunday, 06.02, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: Whiskey Orphans sounds like the name suggests. Fortunately, that means more than hard drinking Americana. There is also a touch of sensitivity and wistfulness underlining the sparse melodies. Universal Devils is Tricky Dick Wickett’s one-man metallic singer songwriter project and more odd and original than those mere words could convey.\n\nMonday | June 3\n\nWhat: KEN mode w/Abrams, BleakHeart and Ten Foot Beast\n\nWhen: Monday, 06.03, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: KEN mode is a metallic, noisy, post-hardcore band whose name is a shortened version of “Kill Everyone Now mode” and in terms of blowing up a groove and cutting a riff into relentlessly jagged pieces, the band has done plenty of that in the more absurdly humorous over-the-top abstract sense. It’s latest album Loved from 2018 has song titles that read like chapters in the diary of a nihilistic misanthrope. For example: “Doesn’t Feel Pain Like He Should,” “The Illusion of Dignity,” “Learning To Be Too Cold” and “Fractures in Adults.” Given the title of the record one has to respect the dark sense of humor informing all of it including the creepy album cover. Fans of Unsane and Jesus Lizard will find much to like here.\n\nTuesday | June 4\n\nWhat: Slim Cessna’s Auto Club with Kid Congo Powers & The Pink Monkey Birds\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 06.04, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ivywild School Gymnasium\n\nWhy: Slim Cessna’s Auto Club, the long-running alt-country act from Denver, brings its Vaudeville west and vibrantly emotional and lively performance to Colorado Springs along with Kid Congo Powers & The Pink Monkey Birds. Powers was once a member of Gun Club, The Cramps and Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, among others, and with the Pink Monkey Birds he brings a lifetime of stories, insight and masterful songwriting to making his own music with a body of work as worthy as anything else in which he’s been involved.\n\nWednesday | June 5\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Gothsta, Snails and Oysters and Little Fyodor solo\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 06.05, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: 3 Kings Tavern\n\nWhy: This month’s editon of Weird Wednesday maintains peak weirdness with Gothsta who does odd keytar pop songs. Then again, if keytar is involved it’s going to be strange but that just enhances the bizarro nature of the music anyway. Plus some legit keytar covers of songs you wouldn’t expect to hear from her unless you’ve been listening to The Space Lady and not even then. Snails and Oysters is Joe Mill’s solo avant-garde/ambient guitar project in which his combines textures and moods to weave a unique soundscape. Little Fyodor is kinda King Weirdo in Denver and has been for decades going from tape collage/manipulation project Walls of Genius to Little Fyodor and Babushka Band. When a lot of punk is fairly conformist, Fyodor is decidedly not that with a visual presence and songwriting diversity and acumen that is so punk it should be its own subgenre with a clever name you won’t read here because Fyodor is also fairly difficult to pigeonhole as merely punk.\n\nWhat: Judas Priest w/Uriah Heep\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 06.05, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Broadmoor World Arena\n\nWhy: Judas Priest started in 1969, a year after Black Sabbath formed. But unlike the latter Priest came into its own shortly before the release of its debut album, 1974’s Rocka Rolla. By then iconic vocalist Rob Halford brought his elemental, wide-ranging singing to the band and guitarist Glenn Tipton joined and with K.K. Downing gave the group its signature two guitar sound that gives its music a dynamism and depth that has been influential on many heavy metal and hard rock bands since. After the debut album, Judas Priest embarked on a series of genre-defining records starting with 1976’s majestic Sad Wings of Destiny. The group weathered the manufactured scandals of the 80s when would-be censors targeted the band, and a broad range of other artists, for the corruption of youth and suicide. Judas Priest’s often remarkably thoughtful and in recent years as heavy metal has become embraced by a more mainstream audience the group’s vivid storytelling and energy is finding an audience with a new generation of fans.\n\nOpening the show is Uriah Heep who are arguably the progenitors of a style of melodic boogie rock and hard psychedelia that has been heavily influential on a younger generation of heavy metal musicians. It, too, started up in 1969 and operated in a similar milieu of music as the aforementioned Sabbath as well as Deep Purple. Like the latter, Uriah Heep had a prominent keyboard presence in its songwriting and no strangers to songs about wizards, the forces of evil and the life of a hard touring band. But more so than some of the other bands mentioned above, Uriah Heep clearly has a foot in English folk rock that informs its song structures and vocalist Bernie Shaw’s evocative cadence. The group hasn’t done any major touring in years so this is a rare chance to see them live."
