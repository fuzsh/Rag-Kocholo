        "text": "El Vez performances present a powerful message of social justice and inclusion in changing US and social contexts. Make the Dream Real interrogates how this message is activated through world-building: the use of a variety of theoretical theatrical and musical tactics that bring into being a progressive social space that refutes the current economic political social and cultural configurations of the United States.\n\nWorld-building in an El Vez show “makes the dream real” by imagining a society in which equal rights are guaranteed inclusivity is fostered difference is valued and the violence of economic inequality is mitigated. But world-building through performance is not content to reside exclusively in the individual imagination or the social imaginary; it temporarily creates this new social space in actual time and space for the audience to experience. Using a dramaturgical methodology which marries theoretical inquiry to theatrical practice based on dramaturgical thinking critical proximity and intellectual flexibility the book delves into the theoretical foundations that inform artist Robert Lopez’s work and each chapter analyzes a different performative component he uses.\n\nMake the Dream Real interrogates how El Vez’s playful engagements hold the United States to its egalitarian promises voicing and enacting - however fleetingly - a just and richly inclusive social space through performance.\n\nWhat happens when precarious urban cultural labourers take data collection laws and policymaking into their own hands? Buskers have been part of our cities for hundreds of years but they remain invisible to governments and in datasets. From nuisance to public art this cultural practice can help us understand the politics of data collection archives regulatory frameworks and urban planning. Busking also responds to underlying questions on the boundaries of the right to the city – and who has a voice in shaping how our cities are planned and governed.\n\nA transnational exploration of street performance Urban Music Governance examines the intricate limits of legality data visibility and resistance from the perspective of those working at the social and regulatory margins of society. Based on fieldwork in Rio de Janeiro and Montreal spanning across a decade the book puts forward a lively account on why such an often-overlooked practice matter in the 21st century.\n\nBy investigating the role of busking in contemporary society Urban Music Governance presents an original interdisciplinary study that exposes how power dynamics in policymaking decide issues of access – and exclusion – around us above and below ground.\n\nIndustrial music appeared in the mid-1970s and far from being a simple sound experimentation phenomenon it quickly spawned a coherent visual culture operating at the intersection of a multitude of media (collage mail art installation film performance sound video) and initiated a close inspection of the legacy of modernity and the growing pervasive influence of technology.\n\nOriginally British the movement soon outgrew Europe extending into the United States and Japan during the 1980s. The sound experiments conducted by industrial bands – designing synthesizers manipulating and transforming recorded sounds from audio tapes either recycled or laid down by the artists – were backed up by a rich array of radical visual productions deriving their sources from the modernist utopias of the first part of the 20th century. Such saturated sounds were translated into abrasive images manipulated through the détournement of reprographic techniques (Xerox art) that investigated polemical themes: mental control criminality occultism pornography psychiatry and totalitarianism among others.\n\nThis book aims to introduce the visual and aesthetic elements of industrial culture to a general history of contemporary art by analysing the different approaches taken and topics addressed by the primary protagonists of the movement who perceptively anticipated the current discourse concerning the media and their collective coercive power.\n\nTraditionally popular music has long been said to intrinsically contest resist and defy the powers that be. This new book challenges this long-standing orthodoxy arguing that popular music more often participates in the social reproduction of the biggest power there is: neoliberal capitalism. This is done mainly through the widespread mediation of a very particular and remarkably cohesive ideology of greatness and value. This ideology is drawn from principles and prescriptions that have long been constitutive of neoliberal capitalism. We have been told this story over and over again for decades.\n\nThe music is real. The music is powerful. The music is defiant.\n\nIt is a story that has gradually spread to encompass everything from classic rock to contemporary pop to hip hop to dance music. This suite of ideas came to dominance since the mid-1980s and persist to the present an era in which the vast majority of people have been disempowered impoverished and marginalised at home at work and in politics. This book explains why such a robust pervasive and persistent set of ideas about popular music has taken such a tenacious hold in a historical era which has repeatedly and thoroughly demonstrated the utter falseness of those same ideas nearly everywhere they have been experienced.\n\nThis book provides semiotically-focused analyses and interpretations of video game music focusing specifically on musical representation of three demographic diversity traits. Adopting a narratologist orientation to supplement existing ludological scholarship these analyses apply music semiotics to crucial modern-day issues such as representation of gender race and religion in video games.\n\nAn original and welcome contribution to the field it considers musical meaning in relation to the aspects of gender race and religion. This book will help readers to develop language and context in which to consider video game music in terms of society and representation and will encourage future research in these critical areas.\n\nYee analyses music's contributions to video games' narrative and thematic meanings specifically concerning three master categories of identity – gender race and religion. Containing twenty-five detailed analytical case studies of musical representation in video game music it sets out theoretical and conceptual frameworks beneficial for interpreting musical meaning from video game soundtracks. Though players and commentators may be tempted to view a game's soundtrack as mere 'background music' this research demonstrates video game music's social relevance as a major factor impacting players' cultural attitudes values and beliefs.\n\nPart I explores immersion interactivity and interpretation in video game music proposing a theory of 'interpretative interactivity' to account for players' semiotic agency in dialogue with their ludic agency. Part II explores gender representation in a trajectory from conventional gender construction alternative femininities/masculinities and potential for non-binary representational possibilities. Part III explores musical representation of nationality culture and race proposing the concept of 'racialised fantasy' and applying frameworks from race scholarship to connect media representations of race to real world racial justice movements. Part IV examines religion introducing the concept of 'sonic iconography' to connect theological\n\nmeanings to the use of sacred music in video game music.\n\nJazz photography has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Photographs of musicians are popular with enthusiasts while historians and critics are keen to incorporate photographs as illustrations. Yet there has been little interrogation of these photographs and it is noticeable that what has become known as the jazz photography 'tradition' is dominated by a small number of well-known photographers and 'iconic' images.\n\nMany photographers including African American photojournalists studio photographers early twentieth-century émigrés the Jewish exiles of the 1930s and vernacular snapshots are frequently overlooked. Drawing on ideas from contemporary photographic theory supported by extensive original archival research Sight Readings is a thorough exploration of twentieth century jazz photography and it includes discussions of jazz as a visual subject its attraction to different types of photographers and offers analysis of why and how they approached the subject in the way they did.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about this book is its movement back and forth between detailed archive research the empirical documentation of photographers their techniques working practices equipment etc. and cultural theory the sophisticated discussion of aesthetics cultural sociology the politics of identity etc. The result is both a fine scholarly achievement and an engaging labour of love.\n\nThis chapter explores the relationship between the sustainability of Ethno and the climate emergency. I begin by presenting the concept of sustainable music practices. Sustainable music practices consider music-making from an ecological standpoint and reflect on how a change in one element of a practice such as infrastructure or community can impact the sustainability of the entire music culture. Ethno relies heavily on international travel to hold Gatherings that comprise participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. International travel was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2020. The limitation of international travel thus impacted the continued musical practice of Ethno and drew attention to the relationship between sustainable music practices and the climate emergency. I reflect on three different approaches Ethno could take to remain sustainable within a climate emergency: drawing on a local immigrant community; incorporating Indigenous musical cultures and holding online programmes. Following this I consider the role of intercultural understanding in relation to the climate emergency and how Ethno could play a role in supporting the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. I conclude that international travel does impact carbon footprints however there is an argument for the importance and value of intercultural connections at this critical time in human history.\n\nThe Ethno World program is an international network of youth ‘gatherings' focused on traditional and folk musics wherein participants teach each other repertoire associated with their respective home countries arrange that repertoire under the guidance of ‘artistic mentors' and then share the results of this collaborative work through one or more public-facing performances. This chapter argues that at Ethno gatherings the notion of folk or traditional music extends well beyond that of a style and repertoire associated with a given locale and instead comes to function as a sonic synecdoche for nationally-associated lived experience. Discourses of traditional music and music-making vary widely among members of the Ethno community and some attendees rationalize repertoire selection through a framework of ‘personal authenticity' wherein music that feels authentic to a person is by extension authentic to their nation. As a result participants' choices regarding traditional music not only shape their presentation of national self-identity but also define traditional music in ways specific to the Ethno context. This chapter also explores how Ethno participants engage in local traditional/folk music and documents the complex relationships of Ethno participants to their nationally-associated traditional/folk music. Analysis draws on 128 interviews (N=128) conducted by members of the Ethno Research team with Ethno World organizers artistic mentors and participants over a two-year period from 2019-2021 and is informed by scholarship on revivals traditional/folk music camps and workshops and the historicization of concepts of folk and traditional in Western European and North American contexts.\n\nBorn of the European folk music revival during the second half of the 20th century Ethno gatherings recreate intense experiences based on intercultural encounters and aural peer-to-peer learning in order to broaden the development of openminded musicians in their twenties from across the world. This chapter examines in some depth the pedagogy -arguably the most defining characteristic of Ethno- as witnessed at the first Ethno USA using the Twelve Continuum Transmission Framework (Schippers 2010). This provides a tool to create a nuanced perspective on aspects that are often glossed over in descriptions of music learning across cultures: issues of context; modes of transmission; dimensions of interaction; and approaches to cultural diversity. The final section of this chapter will test findings against the ten objectives that Ethno has set for itself which include creating a democratic space for the creation and performance of music; providing equal opportunities to musicians of all genders; fostering intercultural dialogue and understanding; promoting non formal music education through peer-to-peer learning; facilitating the mobility of young musicians; building confidence and mutual respect in young people; promoting learning and teaching methodologies by ear making music learning accessible to all; and preserving and promoting cultural heritage amongst youth.\n\nThe Organizers of Ethno Gatherings are probably the most influential in terms of the kinds of experiences that other attendees - participants other musicians and local stakeholders - have at the international musical events they organize. In this chapter we set out the findings from a study to explore the motivations of Ethno Organizers and how they address the various obligations and responsibilities they have towards their participants fellow artists local communities and JM International (JMI) as the host institution. We used a software research tool Sensemaker to capture Organizers' stories and the meaning that they attach to those stories through a process known as 'distributed ethnography’ (Snowden 2016) where respondents are actively involved in the interpretation of meaning (sense-making).\n\nWe found that the Organizers of Ethno Gatherings are motivated by often deeply held personal values and beliefs about the transformational potential of participatory music making (musicking) largely as a result of their own formative musical experiences which may have included previous participation in Ethno events. As well as providing a secure base for transformational identity work in and through music Organizers enact their leadership responsibilities in a holistic sense in the facilitation of both musical and ‘paramusical’ (Stige et al. 2013: 298) outcomes for participants and these paramusical outcomes are of particular significance in their estimation. Their stories highlight the importance of the experience of communitas - transformational moments of ‘collective joy’ (Turner 2012) achieved through music making which facilitate deep social bonds - as a way of bridging the social cultural linguistic and musical differences which may otherwise prevail at such intercultural events. We conclude that the motivations of Ethno Organizers while authentically held at a personal level also benefit from being part of a community of reflective peers facilitated by JMI representing a discourse of ‘ethical praxis' (Elliott Silverman and Bowman 2016; Regelski 2021) which connects the host institution to its Organizers and ultimately to its participants.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the personal and professional development experiences of participants in Ethno music events and gatherings. The research questions that guided this chapter were ‘How do Ethno's professional development structures develop and how are they reinforced?’ and ‘What are the practices that are perceived as being transformational within the context of Ethno?’ The data analysed included Ethno documents (n=108); a survey returned by 202 Ethno participants some having experienced different roles in Ethno over the years; and 10 online interviews with some of the survey participants. The model of musical possible selves developed by Creech Varvarigou and Hallam (2020) served as a lens through which to investigate and understand the Ethno participants' personal and professional development experiences and trajectories. The analysis revealed that Ethno was perceived to have been transformational in multiple ways that involved both personal and professional development. This included having: a) been inspired to continue with lifelong learning in music; b) experienced a profound change in the way that they thought about music and communication; c) felt recognized and valued; d) developed a deeper self-knowledge; and e) gained life skills that could be transferable to other contexts. Personal and professional development were entwined being shaped by rediscoveries (or discoveries) of one's personal musical roots and musical trajectories yet also involving a process of expanding musical experience and knowledge through intercultural learning. Professional development in particular was often experienced as a serendipitous yet expansive process requiring moving beyond one's comfort zone. Overall the immersive experience of musical activities such as jamming song-writing arranging fostered deeper understandings of the skills and attitudes that are implicated in the Ethno participants' current and future musical possible selves.\n\nThis chapter describes and theorizes Ethno pedagogical principles and processes in action addressing the following questions: What are the underpinning values and beliefs that shape learning and teaching at Ethno World? and 2) How are these understood and enacted through pedagogical principles and practices? We frame our discussion with the idea of 'signature pedagogies' concerned with the implicit values and the explicit structures and practices that characterize domain-specific pedagogies. Discussing the specific pedagogical principles and practices associated with Ethno gatherings we draw on Heron's model for facilitation comprising a continuum of hierarchical cooperative and autonomous orientations that can support experiential learning. Our discussion is evidenced by data from three sequential research phases involving a document analysis survey and interviews. At the implicit level Ethno pedagogy was based upon an aspirational belief in teaching as facilitation as well as a consistent foundational pedagogical principle of ‘valuing one another through critical approaches to intercultural and experiential learning’. This foundational principle was articulated through principal pedagogical frameworks that were ‘non-formal pedagogies' and 'scaffolding expansive learning’. At the 'surface’ level of activities the core pedagogical practices that characterized Ethno gatherings were learning by ear (in accordance with an aural tradition) peer learning and self-directed situated learning. Ethno facilitators positioned themselves primarily within a ‘cooperative’ orientation although a full continuum from hierarchical to autonomous approaches was described. We conclude this chapter with a summary of the signature pedagogies found in Ethno World accompanied by some discussion around the link with the wider discipline of music education.\n\nThis article studies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through its different phases by looking at the case of Bogotá’s punk scene and analysing the activities of different collectives involved in the organization of music shows and other types of gatherings. We contribute to understanding those effects by answering the question of how the pandemic has transformed the creative collaborative and political practices of its participants. We consider four periods of analysis: pre-pandemic lockdown new normal and post-peak reactivation. We use a mixed methodology comprising interviews with members of the collectives and the analysis of secondary data obtained from the social media posts made by these collectives. We use the latter to compare audience participation and reactions before during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period with data from 2019 2020 and 2021. A network analysis confirms the existence of a network of collectives identifiable as a central node of the punk scene. We find that remote activities were never considered more than a temporary and imperfect alternative from creative political and economic perspectives. Economic impacts were severe and led to the closure of several collectives. Though a political discourse was not articulated as such by the scene political thought and action aligned with social protests in Colombia and unified in opposition to market-oriented government policies in the cultural field. A slow return to in-person activities took place in the scene leaving remote events behind re-establishing live music at the centre of the scene and allowing for informal socialization among creators producers and audiences. By looking at the three effects globally we conclude that the punk scene did not recover completely and did not reach the level of organization it had before the pandemic.\n\nBased on French expressions of contemporary punk culture this article looks at the formation of the pogo during gigs. Although this dance is one of the characteristics of punk expression it remains little studied. From an interactionist perspective using a comparative approach between different ethnographic fields the aim is to understand how the order of the pogo is negotiated by the actors involved. More than that the aim is to understand how this improvised collective dance produces disorder and gives rise to a community experience. To do this we are interested in the context in which the pogo takes place. Venues play a decisive role in the implementation of this dance and help to create a playful space–time. A new world of meaning is created: the pogodrome. From then on the physical commitment of the participants is linked to the rules of the pogodrome and the breaks in interaction reveal the limits of the framework thus formed. Finally the pogo appears to be a tool for embodying disorder both physical and sociopolitical. In fact the pogodrome becomes a territory of disorder taken over by communities of practitioners that sometimes last beyond the time of the concert.\n\nIn December 2018 Steff Juniper submitted their major research paper for their master’s in Critical Disability Studies at York University entitled Trans-feminist Witchcraft: A Psychiatric Survivor Narrative an arts-based autoethnography on witchcraft as radical healing and the politics of psychiatric survival and disability justice. It merged theories of disability mad queer and transgender studies to ground discussions on the embodiment theories of phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty 2008; Ahmed 2006) and enactive cognition. Steff submitted a demo cassette tape of their drone attached to the paper and through including creative writing personal narrative poetry prose and short story the paper aimed to convey the emotional non-linearity of experiencing the body and language as a limited social convention to express emotion.\n\nSteff’s drone cassette tape sits in the office at York University’s Critical Disability Studies Department for those interested in what an arts-based approach to disability studies research may look feel or sound like. They will be drawing on the work in their master’s thesis in the formation of their submission to elucidate how the creation of drone is a process of communication and sublimation as a neurodivergent mad and disabled artist. Additionally they will explore how their identity politic grew as being foundational from the experience of ‘being a metalhead’. Their submission encompasses a phenomenological approach to their experience as a trans and disabled noise artist. Primarily they will explore how they have used making loud noise and strong-felt vibrations as a spiritual experience and activist tool to heal themselves and empower others to use their creativity to process feelings of alienation.\n\nContent Warnings: Gender Dysphoria Gender-based Violence Psychiatric Oppression Transphobia Suicide and Suicidal Ideation\n\nThe carnelian caught my eye round surreptitiously plump like a blood python. I picked it up and felt the weight in my hands triangularly spherical smooth points of three. It asks how to acknowledge the weight of being alive so that when the lightness of lightning strikes I can notice.1\n\nHeavy metal has long been associated with deviance and non-conformity (Messick and Aranda 2020; Snell and Hodgetts 2007; Lynxwiler and Gay 2000) but it is less clear if that encompasses nonvoluntary forms of non-conformity. Metal culture prides itself on being inclusionary (Wray 2018) although that is more an ideal than an objective reality since despite becoming more inclusionary since its 1960s’ inception biases have prevented women (Shadrack 2021; Berkers and Schaap 2018; Heesch and Scott 2016) individuals from some religions (Moberg 2012; Hecker 2005; Kartheus 2015) and non-white fans (Dawes 2012) from being treated equally. These biases have been explored in academic and popular literature but there is less written about metal fans with dis/abilities. Consistent with Goodley (2018) this chapter uses the term ‘dis/ability’ to reference a broad range of disabilities and disorders because it acknowledges the duality of these conditions and avoids potentially ableist associations.\n\nThis chapter focuses on how widespread dis/ability is among metal fans the role of stigma historical contextualization and what psychological functions are fulfilled that make metal culture an appealing place for membership. Included here is preliminary theoretical work based on existing trends and evidence which are substantiated further by qualitative data. This chapter speaks of dis/abilities in broad strokes so although there is overlap across people of differing life experiences further nuance is needed when speaking of individual dis/abilities and experiences. This chapter outlines some possible psychological functions metal culture can provide for members with dis/abilities including mood and symptom maintenance representation social relatedness a sense of belonging and as an outlet for sharing experiences.\n\nBeginning with a description of música Mexicana’s rising stars Yahritza y Su Esencia a ‘family band’ of young Mexican American musicians we suggest that school music educators become more informed of the musical interests involvements and learning styles of Mexican American students at home within their families and in the communities that surround them. Yahritza’s trademark sierreño style is described and contextualized in light of other notable genres such as mariachi música nortena son jarocho banda grupera and trap corridos. The phenomenon of family bands within Mexican American communities is explored as a means of children’s musical enculturation away from school juxtaposed with a history of exclusion of Mexican American students from school music opportunities. The article addresses limitations of the American model of school music programmes including (1) the need for opportunities for Mexican American (and other) populations to access meaningful musical education experiences and (2) the gap between the music genres offered within the curriculum and those that Mexican American (and other) students experience at home and within their communities. Even as we acknowledge and applaud the presence of family bands and other strong music community music practices among Mexican Americans we call for a national initiative among music educators to ensure that the music which students learn in school is at least germane to students’ home experiences.\n\nIn 1976 the British band Throbbing Gristle emerged from the radical arts collective COUM Transmissions through core members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti joined by Hipgnosis photographer Peter Christopherson and electronics specialist Chris Carter. Though having performed previously in more low-key arts environments their major launch coincided with the COUM retrospective exhibition Prostitution at London’s ICA gallery showcasing and contextualising an array of challenging objects from COUM’s various actions in performance art and pornography. In a deliberately curated strategy inviting press civic and arts dignitaries extravagant followers of the nascent punk scene and music journalists the band created an instant controversy and media panic that tapped into the restrictive climate and encroaching conservatism of late 1970s Britain. Any opportunities that were being explored by a formative punk ethos and movement around sex censorship and transgression were amplified and exposed by Throbbing Gristle and Prostitution. An outraged Member of Parliament Nicholas Fairbairn took the bait and called the ensemble the ‘wreckers of civilisation’ providing the suitable newspaper headline that would be followed a month later by ‘the filth and the fury’ as the Sex Pistols uttered strong profanities on live television.\n\nThe switch from COUM to Throbbing Gristle encompassed a primary mode of expression in making music as opposed to art to further coincide with the energy of the nascent punk scene. The band quickly developed a radically deviant and challenging reputation through pushing the punk format past its strictures in terms of lyrical themes amateurism and considerations of what constitutes music. Through a handful or record releases on their own label Industrial Records and a sporadic string of live performances the band nurtured a strong and devoted following including key journalists and fanzine editors of the punk and post-punk scenes such as Jon Savage and Sandy Robertson. The band’s style of exploring harsh pre-recorded sounds samples of disconcerting narrative and conversation and feeding all sounds through messy electronic processing devices gave rise to the title industrial music. This was further buttressed by performing a strictly timed set of one hour and adopting a non-rockstar mode by appearing disinterested and preoccupied with electronic devices. Having given a name and impetus to the industrial music scene many of their followers and fans formed bands in later years.\n\nDrawing on works such as Andy Bennett’s When the Lights Went Out this book looks at late 1970s Britain before during and immediately after the Winter of Discontent to situate the activism of Throbbing Gristle in this time. It explores how the band worked in and against the time and how they worked in and against punk as punk worked in and against the time and place. Punk acts as a mediating factor and nuisance value as Throbbing Gristle emerged with punk in late 1976 seemingly grappled with it through 1977 and then went on to create and eventually criticise a number of post-punk scenes that had flourished around 1979. Trowell narrates the story through a series of live performances as this is a point where Throbbing Gristle interact with the various city-scenes around England during their original period of operation (1975-1981). The band reflected (and incorporated into their live music) key tropes form the time both ‘mainstream’ and fringe (subcultural avant-garde art counter-culture taboo subjects extremes) such that Throbbing Gristle events had an impact and affect and Trowell traces these as a series of impressions and reverberations amongst fans who went on to do their own music and projects.\n\nIn 1976 the British band Throbbing Gristle emerged from the radical arts collective COUM Transmissions through core members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti joined by Hipgnosis photographer Peter Christopherson and electronics specialist Chris Carter.
