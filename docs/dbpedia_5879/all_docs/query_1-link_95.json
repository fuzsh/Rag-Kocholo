        "text": "The history of music of the recent decades teaches us that the musical style referred to as stoner doom was born as an interesting derivation of the classic doom genre. This version of doom metal, however, over time has assumed the characteristics of a well-defined sub-genre and we have today many excellent formations that are grouped into this category of music.\n\nIn this new series of articles, I’m selecting and presenting to your attention the most interesting records that are published in the context of this style of music, including also those bands that have added a strong dose of psychedelia in the recipe of music.\n\nThis is the first episode for 2019, and it includes five different albums that were published in the first two months of the year.\n\nAs far as geography is concerned, we have two bands from Sweden (Ordos and Witchers Creed), two from U.S.A. (Yatra and Palace in Thunderland), and one from Estonia (Mang Ont).\n\nEnjoy the ride, and don’t forget to come back periodically to check the future updates of the PSYCHEDELIC AND STONER DOOM Radar.\n\n“The End”, by Ordos\n\nExpectations were very high for the new LP by Swedish band Ordos, if only because their previous album (2017’s House of The Dead) received so many appreciations from both critics and fans. Here in this blog, it was included in the list of the best albums of the year, taking into account all genres of music.\n\nThe band’s new LP, The End, basically confirms the same style of stoner doom that was already offered in their previous record, with the addition of higher doses of psychedelic and occult rock. Also, the melodic component, which was already a key point in House of The Dead, has acquired fairly greater importance, making the songs of The End gain remarkable ease of assimilation.\n\nIn more general terms, maybe I was expecting something more innovative from Ordos’s new record, but, on the other hand, their music remains so exciting and fascinating than just the fact of having new songs to listen from the band is something that can change your day for the better.\n\nI have dedicated a specific review to the LP, you can read it from here.\n\n“Death Ritual”, by Yatra\n\nIf The End, by Ordos, was a sort of confirmation of what we’ve heard so far from the band, one of the most interesting surprises we had in the first months of the year was definitely the debut album by Maryland-based trio Yatra, and I’m not referring only to the perimeter of stoner doom.\n\nDeath Ritual is the first LP from this promising formation, and it’s one of those records that have the capacity to take you away from the physical world, projecting your mind into a magical dimension full of pagan rituals, dangerous spells, ancient legends and dark visions.\n\nI wrote a dedicated review of the album, you can read it for a few more details about the LP.\n\n“Awakened From the Tomb…”, by Witchers Creed\n\nWitchers Creed is one of those bands that I discovered almost by chance thanks to a recommendation that I’ve read on a social media, and which became an instant favourite.\n\nThis is a formation of young musicians from Sweden, who grew up influenced by the music of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, and then eventually released their first (impressive) LP: Awakened From The Tomb…\n\nTheir sound is characterized by a few but effective features: a warm and powerful stoner-like bass, which perhaps the element which impressed me the most in the LP, a guitar that churns out endless sequences of catchy and sticky riffs, a simple yet effective rhythmic session and, last but not least, a powerful and fascinating voice.\n\nI have published a short review of the LP, you can find there additional details about this excellent debut album.\n\n“The King of the Empty Aeon”, by Palace in Thunderland\n\nJust a quick mention for the new LP by Palace in Thunderland, a psychedelic stoner band from Springfield, Massachusetts, in the U.S.A. The band is formally active since 1998 but, after a period of standby, it was basically re-activated only in 2011. Since then they have released three LPs.\n\nTheir newest record is named The King of the Empty Aeon and it features nine enjoyable and intriguing songs alternating between heavy moments, and other fuzzier and definitely more psychedelic pieces. This second category of tracks is the one that I liked the most in their LP, especially the 11-minutes long song This Illusion’s Come Alive, which is right in the middle of the album.\n\nFor what concerns the heavier and quicker kind of songs, the single Vicarious is definitely a good hit.\n\n“Maa Sarv”, by Mang Ont\n\nI’m concluding this list of albums with Maa Sarv, which is the new LP from Mang Ont, a stoner doom metal trio which arrives from Estonia. The band is active since 2011 and their brand new release is the third entry in a discography which includes also the EP Neli Aastat (2015) and the debut LP Võhk (2017). The style of their music is characterized by slow, powerful and epic songs. Their sound is thick, heavy and impregnated with psychedelic and stoner atmospheres. In some sections of the band’s songs, we can also appreciate the inclusion of fuzzy drones that introduce a further element of restlessness to their sound.\n\nMaa Sarv is an impressive record because in the short span of only three long tracks the band has managed to develop a journey into a hallucinated and psychedelic world: at first we are greeted by inviting and intriguing sounds, but soon we realize that we ended up in a universe of obsessive riffs and hypnotic rhythms from which it is almost impossible to go out.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the album cover, some have described Mang Ont’s sound as “prehistoric riffs echo from the Mammoth’s cave”. This is actually another good way to transfer the idea of their special and intriguing sound of the band, for which I foresee a very promising future.\n\nI’m starting to collect the best songs for this exciting category of albums in a dedicated playlist, called THE PSYCHEDELIC AND STONER DOOM RADAR. Check it out and follow it, it’s going to grow with time.\n\nAnother place where you can enjoy some good stoner doom is the famous playlist SLOWLY. It features more than 8 hours of the best doom, sludge and post-metal that was released in the last three years.

It generally features slow tempos, heavy rhythms, dark atmospheres and abrasive sounds. There are today many good bands dedicated to this genre of metal, each one giving its own interesting interpretation, and judging by the results the year 2017 has been definitely important: we have in fact some excellent albums that will leave a clear mark for a long time.\n\nIn collecting and selecting the 10 albums to be included in the list I had to make some choices, both because of a few good bands that didn’t enter the chart and also to assign the positions in the list for those groups who where included. As always these choices will generate some criticis, but I believe it’s part of the game and there is always the opportunity to comment. In any case, I’m much confident that the present selection of the top ten albums of the year is fully representative of the status of sludge metal in modern times and even a few modifications that could occur in the list wouldn’t change the overall situation.\n\nAn interesting element that emerges from this list is how sludge metal has become an universal musical genre, practiced successfully everywhere in the world. The top ten chart includes two bands from U.S. and Sweden, one from Germany, one from UK, one from France, one from Belgium, one from Italy and one from Poland.\n\nBefore leaving the floor to the top ten list, I take the opportunity to provide below the access to one of the most recent mixtapes dedicated to sludge metal among those published in the blog. This features most of the bands included in the chart and it may be the ideal soundtrack for reading the rest of the post. Enjoy!\n\nNumber 10\n\nDARK TOWERS, BRIGHT LIGHTS by Cranial\n\nDarl Towers, Bright Lights is the debut release of the German band Cranial, which features in the line-up some members coming from the the mythical band Omega Massif, now dissolved. In 45 minutes and 4 long tracks, these guys from Hamburg deliver an epic sludge and post rock opera, somehow reminiscent of Isis, Cult of Luna and Neurosis.\n\nThe music of Cranial keeps all the main features of sludge metal with clear deviations towards the more elegant melodies of post rock. There is no particular innovation or creativity in the music produced by these guys but pure, simple and beautiful marching riffs, repetitive bass lines, and apocalyptic atmospheres.\n\nIn summary: the debut LP from Cranial features a satisfying and exciting collection of modern sludge medal songs, although I am convinced that these musicians have the capacity – for their future works – to contribute in a more innovative and personal way to the evolution of this musical genre.\n\nNumber 9\n\nWIZARD BLOODY WIZARD by Electric Wizard\n\nBritish doom veterans Electric Wizard have published this year the ninth studio album of their long career, the second featuring the new rythmic section played by Clayton Burgess on bass and Simon Poole on drums and percussions.\n\nThe latest work from the Wizards, whose publication has been quite tormented and affected by a series of delays and postponements, sees the band from South West England abandon any desire for complex and dynamic structures. Almost all the songs of the album are in fact built on a simple and linear implant where the initial riff, slow and sometimes bluesy, is repeated substantially until the end of the song, with few variations and evolutions. Where this mechanism benefits of an intriguing and engaging riff the final result is certainly captivating. But in some cases, unfortunately, the songs appear too simple and flat to become memorable.\n\nAt the end of the day we can say that this record is not comparable with the major masterpieces that the band has released in the past, although these guys confirm themselves among the best representatives of that variant of sludge which bases its roots in doom metal.\n\nNumber 8\n\nDOMAIN OF EMBER by Boson\n\nBoson is a new sludge metal band from Minnesota, in the U.S., and Domain of Ember is their promising debut full-lenght album. As the name of the band suggests, the music composed by this quartet takes inspiration from the “Boson”, which is that fundamental element of quantum physics named after the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. Basically the Bosons are elementary particles that – once combined – generate all the most complex atomic structures that we see around us. In the same way the music of this band also starts from the combination of simple, linear elements, which are placed next to each other to develop long, complex and articulate songs.\n\nThe result is definitely interesting and the group shows ambition and personality, all features that foreshadow good things for their future. Surely there must be a little more attention and effort to increase the variety of songs, which in this debut seem excessively similar.\n\nNumber 7\n\nTRELU by Fallow\n\nFallow is a metal band from Southern France formed in 2010. Trelu (which means “Full Moon” in the old language of Southern France) is their second album and it’s basically a live session that the quartet recorded at the Darius Milhaud Conservatory of Music of Aix en Provence, France. This work follows their previuous LP, Werra (“Controversy”), published by the band a couple of years ago.\n\nThe music played by Fallow is an interesting version of post metal with many elements of sludge and psychedelic metal. There are in fact many moments in Fallow’s songs where the walls of heavyness and the poderous guitar riffs leave room for more rarefied and dreamy atmospheres; but it’s usually a short breath, a small parenthesis of delicacy before the most powerful sounds make their return.\n\nAs the band writes on their social media pages, the songs in Trelu are about witchcraft and legends in Southern France. And as a side note, currently the album can be acquired for just 1€ on their bandcamp page.\n\nNumber 6\n\nMATTER & VOID by Sorxe\n\nSorxe, from Phoenix in the U.S., are one of those groups that managed to find the right balance between the typical musical structures of post rock and the heavy and brutal sounds of sludge metal. Matter & Void, the second full-lenght album released by the band, represents an evident evolution with respect to the debut album (Surrounded by Shadows, published in 2014), especially for what concerns the introduction of slightly lighter atmospeeres in most of the tracks. It looks lite these guys from Arizona had established that the monotonous oppressiveness of their first LP was a bit of a limit to their creativity, and therefore decided to loosen a little the grip to explore new territories.\n\nAn aspect which is definitely interesting about Sorxe is that they feature two bass players in the four piece line-up. The “sonic” management of the two bass lines has been exceptional: there is no “bass overload” in the sound of the band and, on the contrary, this stylistic choice gives additional flavours to their pieces.\n\nIt’s really a pleasure to see a band that managed to improve so well the already good results obtained at their debut. Surely this band is among those to be observed and tracked carefully from here on.\n\nNumber 5\n\nRUST by Monolord\n\nToday it’s almost impossible to see a rock or metal chart that doesn’t contain a couple of Swedish groups, and this ranking is no exception.\n\nMonolord, from Gothenburg, released this year their latest album, Rust, which is the third since their formation four years ago. Despite such prolificity, all the albums published by the band so far have always been characterized by interesting and innovative elements. Moreover, during these four years the band has also shown a positive trend with a steady improvement in the quality of their music, something that is fully confirmed with their new album.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, Monolord is one of those bands which like taking a given rhythm and keep it constant through the whole song, or even the entire album. What makes the difference, in this case, is the beauty of the bluesy guitar riffs, always intriguing and definitely enjoyable to hear. Stylistically we’re in front another variation of that marriage between sludge and doom that proved to be so successful in recent years, with atmospheres and melodies that are in this case less oppressive and gloomy than the norm.\n\nMonolord is another band that has been capable to build its own style even by drawing heavily into the sounds of the masters of this genre. And if these guys will continue to publish albums with the same frequency that characterized their production so far, we won’t need to wait a lot to see if the positive trend they have shown up to this point will be confirmed with their next albums.\n\nNumber 4\n\nCHILDREN OF THE HAZE by Dopelord\n\nChildren of the Haze is the new studio effort by Polish sludge quartet Dopelord, and it’s the third entry of their discography since they were formed in 2010. The music of Dopelord is an oppressively slow and psychedelic trip into heavyness and as they say on their bandcamp page, their music is inspired by “old movies, 70s music and magical herbs“. And indeed, this is probably the most hallucinated album on this Top Ten chart.\n\nOne of the peculiar characteristics of Dopelord has alway been their innate capability to be heavy and expressive at the same time. This element is fully represented in their last work, where the powerful guitars and the massive rhythm section creates an impenetrable and oppressive wall of sound, slow to exhaustion, but at the same time capable to generate incredibly expressive melodic lines, further enriched by abundant psychedelic inserts and a few light touches of keyboards and synthetizers. To complete the picture, the extensive use of clean vocals adds another peculiar element of innovation in the succesful recipe crafted by this quartet of doped metallers.\n\nIt’s almost impossible to remain indifferent to the music of Dopelord, and Children of the Haze is for sure another masterpiece in their very good discography.\n\nNumber 3\n\nMASS VI by Amenra\n\nIf there is an album that can be fully summarized by its first two minutes, this is Mass VI by Belgian domm & sludge masters Amenra. Every constituting element of this new masterpiece from the band of the West Flanders is in fact contained in the initial moments of their last album: disturbing melodies, suffocating atmospheres, and a crescendo of anxiety that ends up in violent screams and an explosion of guitars.\n\nThe eerie quietness of the first couple of minutes of “Children Of The Eye” announces the coming storm, and the nine explosive, cathartic minutes of this opening song hold in themselves all the strikingly disparate emotions that we have come to expect from Amenra (from the album’s bandcamp page).\n\nAs a formation that is active since many years, we could somehow anticipate what would have been inside their new album: contrasts of light and darkness, plenty of crescendos, brutality, intensity and melody perfectly balanced in every song. What we couldn’t imagine, maybe, was the brilliant and astonishing way in which all of these elements have been composed together. Taken as a whole, this is one of the most satisfying records we had in 2017, and it fully deserved its position in the Top Three of this chart.\n\nNumber 2\n\n8 by Ufomammut\n\nI cannot hide the pleasure of presenting an Italian band in one of the main positions of this chart. But Ufomammut, from Alessandria, have nowadays achieved such a reputation in the stoner doom panorama that I can’t be accused of giving them a favorable treatment.\n\nA particular stylistic choice that the trio of Italian metallers has adopted for their new record, which is named 8 as the position that the disc occupies in the band’s discography, is that the 8 songs of the album are merged one into the another without a real separation, creating a single uninterrupted flow of crushing sounds with sparse touches of psychedelia. Making an album as a single stream of heavy music could generate serious drawbacks in terms of accessibility and overall enjoyability. To avoid this effect the band has produced one of the most beautiful sequences of sludgy riffs among those we have heard this year.\n\nUfomammut have been often accused in the past of writing songs and albums bigger than themselves. But with this work, which comes after 18 years since the band’s formation, we can say that the band has eventually reached its maturity. Their last work signs the definitive inscription of the band among the masters of modern sludge. The ambition that these musicians had always manifested in their previous works has been finally combined with a brilliant capacity of songwriting and a particular attention to every detail of the production process. Passion and experience generated a memorable result, an album that has the full potential to leave a clear mark in the sludge and stoner world.\n\nNumber 1\n\nHOUSE OF THE DEAD by Ordos\n\nOrdos is the name of an incredible stoner-doom band from Sweden, which released early this year their second album, House of the Dead. The LP follows their 2013’s homonymous debut work.\n\nThe band does nothing to hide that their sound is inspired by the legacy of the the 70’s, and although there are no particular traces of innovation in their music, the product that they have packed for this new album is so incredibly addictive that the lack of novelty is not perceived at all.\n\nI’ve fallen in love with House od the Dead since the first time I’ve heard it on Spotify, and the initial positive impression remained unchanged – indeed it has further grown – after many and many other listens of the album. I’m convinced that this record has got all the necessary elements to excel: the variety of the songs, an incredible enjoyability of the riffs, the perfection of the production, the skill of all the musicians and also the right level of roughness which makes the product genuine.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, day after day this album has become one of the favourite LPs of the year, well beyond the boundaries of sludge, stoner and doom. Competition was tough this year for the Top Ten chart, but in true honestly there have never been doubts that this record would have given the way to some other contender.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne of the things that excites me the most when I listen to new music is when I recognize to be in front of an artist, or a band, who has managed to compose an album that is so beautiful and inspired that its value transcends the specific canons of its musical genre. This is something very rare: according to my personal statistics I encounter an album of this kind once or twice a month. Compared to the hundreds of new discs I listen – and select – this is really an infrequent event. For this reason, when a new musical masterpiece emerges from the crowd, it is necessary to celebrate it and announce it with energy and passion. For these category albums the standard labels of “jazz” or “rock” or “metal” lose their intrinsic meaning. These works are in fact valid and musically relevant regardless of their original gender. These are the albums that leave a mark in the memory that we’ll keep of the current year.\n\nJust a couple of months separate us from the end of 2017. Let’s have thus a last update of the best albums that were released since the beginning of the year, before the final and definitive assessment that we will do at the end of December.\n\nThe list you’ll find below doesn’t represent an order of value but rather a suggestion of a possible musical path across the “must have” albums of the year. From the beginning to the end of the list we move from the delicacy and virtuosity of modern jazz to the energy and passion of metal. But as already said, there is a common element that goes beyond the tags and categories we may attach to each LP, and this is the absolute value and the quality of each one of the following entries.\n\nEnjoy this trip into the most beautiful music of the year and stay tuned for further updates! A few additional details for each album is provided after the list.\n\nThe Best 20 Albums of 2017, last update before the end of the year\n\nTigran Hamasayan, An Ancient Observer\n\nMark Guiliana Jazz Quartet, Jersey\n\nMax Richter, Three Worlds Music From Woolf Works\n\nJoep Beving, Prehension\n\nKauan, Kaiho\n\nUlver, The Assassination of Julius Caesar\n\nChinese Man, Shikantaza\n\nWoolworm, Deserve To Die\n\nThe National, Sleep Well Beast\n\nImelda May, Life Love Flesh Blood\n\nManchester Orchestra, A Black Mile To The Surface\n\nMotorpsycho, The Tower\n\nRise Against, Wolves\n\nFrank Carter & The Rattlesnakes, Modern Ruin\n\nGoldfinger, The Knife\n\nSeether, Poison The Parish\n\nJohn Garcia, The Coyote Who Spoke In Tongues\n\nOrdos, House Of The Dead\n\nPower Trip, Nightmare Logic\n\nThe Haunted, Strenght in Numbers\n\nTigran Hamasayan, An Ancient Observer\n\nAt this point in time many months have passed since An Ancient Observer, the last masterpiece by Armenian composer Tigran Hamasyan, entered into the charts of this blog. But as a matter of fact, I recognized immediately that this LP was going to be one of the major releases of the year, across all genres.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, this last production from Tigran sees the artist focused primarily on the piano. The simplicity of the arrangements, however, is in this case totally in favour of Tigran’s enormopus musical inspiration. In all of the songs of the album, in particular, we can appreciate the beautiful balance that he managed to achieve between Armenian folk music (which is based on a different tonal system with respect to the European one) and more conventional – western – musical structures. The melodies in Tigran’s songs are always suspended on this unstable equilibrium between two worlds and two cultures, and this dynamic contrast creates a fascinating and magical atmosphere.\n\nAn Ancient Observer doesn’t look as a circumscribed musical experiment but rather appears as the result of years and years of work and persistent refinement by a musician that is incorporating local folk melodies into jazz-form improvisations since his teens.\n\nMark Guiliana Jazz Quartet, Jersey\n\nIt is really curious for me to observe that there are artists who are so much driven by musical curiosity and the desire to explore different influences that they feel the pressure to produce adventurous works mixing together musical genres, always trying to find new languages for expressing their creativity. And it’s even more curious to recognize, sometime, that the only way these artists really manage to achieve their goal is to come back to the origin of their music. Evidently, it is just by going through the most well-known roads that you can travel the further.\n\nMark Guiliana, the talented and versatile drummer who gained the attention of fans and critics playing together with artists of the caliber of Brad Mehldau and Avishai Cohen, started a few years ago an exploration of electronic music, pop/rock and free-improvisation – sometimes with mixed results in my opinion. This year he has movedback to a more conventional lineup, a total analogue set-up, and he eventually released one of the most exciting records of his entire discography.\n\nWorking together with long-time supporting musicians such as tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby and bassist Chris Morrissey, and the the new addition of Fabian Almazan on piano, Mark Guiliana managed to record a compilation of songs wich are today the perfect synthesis of Conteporary Jazz and that showcase a perfec balance between the excellence of the individual musicians (often engaged in breathtaking solos) with an excellent harmonic cohesion.\n\nMax Richter, Three Worlds Music From Woolf Works\n\nThree Worlds Music From Woolf Works is Max Richter’s eighth album and it’s mostly consisting of the music score that the British musician composed for the ballet Woolf Works in collaboration with choreographer Wayne McGregor. Compared to the major works from Richter, this album somehow leaves the post-minimalist sounds of his last releases to embrace a neoclassical style, somehow closer to his early works. Interspersed with the larger orchestral moments, we still find, however, a few synthetic inserts which give the music an estranged and pleasantly artificial atmosphere.\n\nThis is a must-have disc for all Richter’s fan but, more in general, for all music lovers. It represents a perfect fusion between creativity, depth of sound and enjoyability.\n\nJoep Beving, Prehension\n\nThe story of Joep Beving testifies the impact that social media and modern streaming services may have on the success (and sometimes the failure) of a new artists. This Dutch musician recorded some of the original piano tunes that he used to play for his family, distributed them online, and eventually sparked a stratospheric interest from hundreds of thousands of Spotify subscribers. At that point, contended by a number of record companies, he released this year a second record, Prehension, which confirmed the class and talent of the artist.\n\nThe style of Joep Beving follows the successful stream of modern classical and contemplative piano music, but just because of the fact that this genres begins to be definitely inflated, to emerge from the mass becomes even more difficult. The short compositions collected in Prehension reach the magical point of equilibrium where accessibility of the melodies matches with class and style. All the musical attributes of Bevings’ compositions float in that delicate balance between minimalism and delicacy where every additional element would make the sounds redudant, but anything less than that would compromise pleasure and smoothness of the songs.\n\nKauan, Kaiho\n\nKauan are a typical case of a band who had to face a long and articulated journey through different genres before landing on those shores which proved to be the best suited to convey the poetry of their music. Started as a black and doom metal band, this group of musicians from Chelyabinsk, in Russia, first transformed their sound into a blend of post-rock and neo-folk, and eventually arrived to play an incredible combination of ambient music and atmospheric minimalism.\n\nThe abandonment of metal and doom sounds was already initiated by the band with the spectacular 2015’s album Sorni Nai, which is still one of the most incredible and thrilling LPs of the decade (and the album is available for free at high quality).\n\nThis year, with Kaiho, the process is completed. I find quite difficultto find a proper category for the music that is being played by these poets of modern music. But this is a little problem with almost no importance. What really matters, in fact, is that we are in front of a musical masterpiece, an album that is capable to make you fly into magical soundscapes and feel pure and breathtaking emotions.\n\nI will always express my gratitude to Kauan. What they have given to me in the recent years with their music is something unique, special.\n\nUlver, The Assassination of Julius Caesar\n\nSimilary to what we’ve already said for Kauan, even in the case of Ulver, which is a Norwegian experimental musical collective that is nowadays approaching 25 years of activity, it’s absolutely impossible to synthesize and represent their musical career with just a few tags. If their early works explored the realms of black and folk metal, with the passing of time they have initiated an incredible and ambitious exploration of other musical genres, including ambient, electronica, and neoclassical. This year, with their last work named The Assassination of Julius Caesar, the band is experimenting with synthpop and EDM. The result is brilliant, as if the four Norwegians were long-term and celebrated artists of this genre, and not the neophytes of this type of music as they are in reality.\n\nThe album manages to combine an incredible fluidity of sounds with a unique and truly elegant musical elegance, something that’s really challenging and not easy to achieve with electronic music. The quality of the LP is very high, on all aspects, and that’s basically one of the albums which surprised me the most in 2017.\n\nChinese Man, Shikantaza\n\nFive years after their first album, French trip-hop collective Chinese Man are back with a new LP, Shikantaza, which is built on top of a perfectly balanced mix of funky, groove, hip-hop and many other fragements of musical genres and ethnic references.\n\nThe are a few songs that stand out for their brilliance and creativity, but at the end it is the average level of all the tracks of the album which leaves speechless. Shikantaza is an album made to be listened and listened again, this is one of those albums that you can easily play in the background during your day for hours and hours and never get tired of. Sometimes you will find yourself turning up the volume and dancing alone like a fool, captured by one of the many vintage rhythms that punctuate the entire disc.\n\nWoolworm, Deserve To Die\n\nListening to Deserve To Die, the beautiful new album by Woolworm – a Canadian band relatively new figure in the indie rock scene – you realize how often the most beautiful things in music are born out of the clash between opposite elements. Rage and tenderness, hardcore and pop, dissonance and melodies, light and darkness, these are the main ingredients which constitute this little masterpiece of rock.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, Deserve To Die is a beautiful collection of indie rock songs with numerous and well-blended influences from stoner, post-rock and even some heavy metal. Almost all the tracks of the album shine for immediacy and freshness and, considering the album as a whole, you get the feeling that these musicians really enjoy what they’re doing: playing a genuine, inspired and captivating rock and roll. And this is not by chance that such a little gem has taken a seat in this journey through the best music of the year while many other bands – more acclaimed and experienced than Woolworm – didn’t achieve the same result.\n\nThe National, Sleep Well Beast\n\nSleep Well Beast, the seventh album by American indie art rock The National, was one of the most anticipated and awaited albums of 2017. It’s not by chance, then, that the LP topped in a few days some of the most important music charts in US, UK and Canada.\n\nBorn as college rockers and post-punk revivalists, these four guys from Cincinnati developed with the years a unique musical style where delicate melodies and intimate atmospheres dominate over every other element. One of the best characteristics of the album is how the band managed to introduce a bunch of new elements and innovation in their style but without reinventing their overall musical approach, which is still dominated by a profound melancholy but with some nice and appreciated relatively energic inserts (as it’s evident in the beautiful single Day I Die).\n\nAs it’s typical with every albums of The National, a few songs are particularly brilliant, but in this case the overall quality of the LP is very high, making the experience of listening to the album as a really enjoyable journey.\n\nImelda May, Life Love Flesh Blood\n\nThanks to a long presence in the music scene and a total number of five albums, Imelda May has already achieved a strong reputation as one of the best folk and rock singers of our time. The Irish musician, singer and songwriter began her profession as back as 2003, at an age that formally should preclude her to enter into many places where she was expected to perform.\n\nInitially affirmed with a rockabilly-oriented musical style, Imelda May has slowly shifted towards a peculiar and enjoyable soft rock with the incremental introduction of elements coming from the folk tradition. Her last work, Life Love Flesh Blood, signs the definitive change in her musical direction and sees the artist engaged with a number of country and folk ballads of absolute value.\n\nUnlike some critics who haven’t fully appreciated this change of style, I am among those who have greatly enjoyed the new musical path she embarked on with the last album. Imelda May’s LP, as far as I am concerned, is among the finest things I’ve heard since the beginning of the year.\n\nManchester Orchestra, A Black Mile To The Surface\n\nA Black Mile To The Surface, the 5th full-lenght album by Manchester Orchestra, was already indicated in this blog as one of the best art-rock albums of the year. As a matter of fact, the American indie rock band from Georgia has collected in their last work a fantastic sequence of songs and this is presumably one of those albums that will stay among the masterpieces of the band’s career.\n\nFrom a musical point of view, the album meshes togheter the disparate stylistical elements that the guys from Atlanta manifested in their last few productions: gorgeous rock melodies, ambitious and elegant arrangements, layered harmonies and evocative lyrics. And whether you pick up single songs or you deal with the entire album, this work does not disappoint. Definitely.\n\nMotorpsycho, The Tower\n\nWhen I was a student at the University, more than 20 years ago, Motorpsycho reached for me the status of a cult band and every year or so they repeated the rite of releasing a new album, which for me used to become a new relic to be worshiped. Between 1994 and 1998, in particular, this trio of Norwegian rockers released 4 albums that marked the “renaissance” of progressive rock in the ’90s. Their music was just wonderful. They played a genuine, engaging and exciting rock, a music gifted by a level of creativity that was really outside the boundaries of the human being, with a powerful and devastating sound. In short, a myth.\n\nThe story tells that at some point in their career the band faced a musical turn and the magic of those years was never to be repeated, probably not only because of their music but also because it was also my life that changed. Through the years I have continued to follow their steps, perhaps with less transport and passion but always with great interest. Their prolificity has been somewhat slowed, but they have continued to produce albums with a certain frequency. Recently, for some years now, their music is coming back to touch some special strings of my sensitivity and today, with their new work The Tower, it is as if they are again approaching that part of my body that is more sensitive to their music.\n\nThe current lineup of the band features only two members of the original formation: Bent Sæther (lead vocals and bass) and Hans Magnus “Snah” Ryan (guitars) and last year also the “young” drummer who supported the last 7 albums left the group to be replaced by Tomas Järmyr from Zu, who was presented as the new permanent drummer of the band. But as often happens with the rock groups, the arrival of a new member must have activated a new vein of creativity because the latest work from Motorpsycho is really amazing and full of so many musical ideas that it really seem to be back to the magical period of their career.\n\nRise Against, Wolves\n\nOne of the best surprise in Rock Music this year came from from Rise Against, the American alternative and hardcore band which published on last June their eighteth studio album, named Wolves.\n\nThe record is full to the brink of the band’s signature and explosive formula where aggressive punk and hardcore sounds are combined with fiery vocals and furious choruses typical of alternative rock. With the exception of a couple of catchy songs, however, the album needs some repeated listening to be appreciated in its entirety. Or at least this was my personal experience…. I had to go through the album a few times before getting involved at the right level by the record’s eleven tracks. Steadily and incessantly, the album climbed on the top of my preferences in rock and today it’s also one of the most appreciated companions for my running workouts.\n\nBesides the absolute beauty of its best tracks – the album in its entirety is characterized by a very high quality of music and lyrics. Rise Against play a very effective and strong rock and the value of their production goes well beyond the politic message they convey with their songs.\n\nFrank Carter & The Rattlesnakes, Modern Ruin\n\nModern Ruin is the second album released by the relatively new English rock band capitanated by former Gallows frontman Frank Carter, here supported by Dean Richardson, Thomas Mitchener and Gareth Grover (The Rattlesnakes).\n\nReleased on January 2017, Modern Ruin immediately topped all the music charts of this blog. It’s an incredible compilation of energetic and catchy songs supported by an incredible sound which magnifies the fantastic voice of the band leader. And despite the ups and downs in the chart, this is a release that can’t really miss in your collection of the best music of the year.\n\nGoldfinger, The Knife\n\nWhat can one expect from a rock group which spent the last nine years without any new music and in the meantime 3 of the original 4 members were kicked out from the band?\n\nThese were the premises for The Knife, the new and long-awaited studio album by Goldfinger, the punk band from Los Angeles which gained quite a good reputation across the two centuries for their relevant contribution to the ska-punk sub-genre. But once I started listening to the disc, I found myself literally embarrassed for how good this album was and I ended-up literally seduced by the energy and the freshness emanating from the album. The Knife, released on last July, is the seventh LP from Goldfinger and it managed to cancel in a matter of seconds all the skeptikism one could have on the album.\n\nAfter the last internal revolution, Goldfinger is today a sort of “supergroup” with a new line-up consisting of band leader John Feldman, who’s the only remaining member of the original group, supported by Blink-182’s Travis Barker (who’s maybe the best punk drummer of the current days), talented bassist Mike Herrera and Story of the Year’s rhythm guitarist Philip Sneed.\n\nThe songs in The Knife offer the listener a wonderful mix of melodic punk, alternative rock and ska. The music crafted by Feldman and his new bandmates manages to combine funny and catchy choruses with interesting musical structures. The ska elements are very well balanced and as a matter of fact you can listen the album over and over again without too much saturation. This is an instant classic, one of the best rock albums of the year.\n\nSeether, Poison The Parish\n\nIt may seem a curious thing at first, but what is still today the best alternative metal album of the year comes from South Africa and has been produced by a band of veteran rockers who – until a few years ago – very few would have associated the metal world.\n\nSeether, a post-grunge band from Pretoria, has been in fact the protagonist of one of the most interesting music transformations of the year. Poison the Parish, the seventh full-lenght work by the trio, arrived three years after their previous release and signed a new heavier direction for the band. And based on what we hear on the album, the change is for the better.\n\nThe musical style of Seether, today, is clearly inspired by the masters of alternative metal (Tool and Alice in Chains, just to mention the most evident sourcse of inspiration), but the album never trascends into a mere imitation of the models. This album is definitely one of the best surprises of the year. These guys have developed an exceptional mix of “metal” atmospheres and mainstream “rock” music motifs: the result, in this case, is more than the sum of the two parts.\n\nJohn Garcia, The Coyote Who Spoke In Tongues\n\nAs long term fan of John Garcia, I tend to appreciate almost every single thing he does as main artist or every song where he simply contributes with his wonderful voice. His last full-lenght disc, The Coyote Who Spoke in Tongues, is however a masterpiece from every point of view. This is an acoustic album where the former Kyuss singer rearranges a few tunes from his glorious past and presents also a number of new songs.\n\nMuch of the beauty of this record lies in the fact that John Garcia didn’t just follow the desire to pursue the commercial success by just putting a new dress on the most famous songs of his career. Rather, it is evident the depth of emotions which our favourite singer wanted to share with us. and which is at the basis of such a little masterpiece. The value of this album is well beyond the stoner musical domain, this is a work which clearly represents one of the best things which happened in music in 2017.\n\nOrdos, House Of The Dead\n\nOrdos is an incredible Swedish stoner-doom band which released early this year their second album, House of the Dead. The LP follows their 2013’s debut. As the band uses to says, the album is evidently inspired by the underground stoner genre and the songs are typically characterized by a trashy stoner-doom with elements from black metal and bluesy psychedelia.\n\nI’ve fallen in love with this work since I listened to the initial guitar riffs of the album, and the positive impression remained unchanged after many and many other listens of the entire work. The songs of this LP feature a lot of elements that are reminiscent of ’70 rock and ’90 metal (the final part of the title track borrowed the riff from Faith No More), but what’s really impressive of the disc is the enjoyable heaviness of all the melodies that are fitted into the 6 tracks of the album. It’s a wall of sounds that wraps you up but without tearing you down. Energy and dark riffs.\n\nPower Trip, Nightmare Logic\n\nNightmare Logic, which is the last and second full-lenght album by Texans trashers Power Trip, has systematically climbed the rankings of every chart of this blog where the LP was included, eventually reaching the position of best metal album of the year.\n\nPower Trip are a relatively new metal band from Texas which plays an energetic and violent blend of thrash and hardcore. They aren’t around since many years but have already accumulated considerable experience playing live together with some big names like Anthrax, Lamb of God and Napalm Death. Nigthmare Logic is their second full-lenght album and it proved to be one of the best thrash metal releases of the last years: fast, energetic, and innovative with a lot of inserts from other metal sub-genres, such as hardcore and industrial.\n\nNightmare Logic looks to me as one of that fortunate cases where the classical and typical elements of thrash metal have been masterfully reshaped with modern elements, creating a new and unique sound that most likely will become itself a reference for future generations. Impressive, not to be missed.\n\nThe Haunted, Strenght in Numbers\n\nSwedish extreme metallers The Haunted have achieved last year the important milestone of 20 years of successful career. On last August they released the ninth album of an impressive discography. In their new work, called Strength In Numbers, the band further consolidates their musical style without any radical innovation butm as usual, we’re in front of a wonderfully played compilation of death and thrash filled with the right amount of brutality, energy and class, with a few tracks emerging on top of the others for their quality.\n\nAnd it’s no surprise, then, that in a short time this work took out the competition and got the title of best death metal album of the year.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
