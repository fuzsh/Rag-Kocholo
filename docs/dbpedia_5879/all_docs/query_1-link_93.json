        "text": "This best of list was intended for publication in 2020 and parts of the entries with comments were published in my year end best list for the print edition of Birdy magazine in Denver for the December 2019 issue. The full best of list is presented here with those short reviews included with the appropriate album and the rest included without comment and several album covers shared as well. The album of the year was All Your Sisters’ Trust Ruins (listed first) because it encapsulated the mood of the year and the band put on one of the best shows of 2019 and the record felt like a leap forward in style and execution for the band. Soon I’ll publish the full best of 2020 list too in a similar format with the commentary for those items that made it into the print edition of Birdy for December 2020.\n\nAll Your Sisters | Trust Ruins | The Flenser\n\nA brutal, maximalist summation of the turmoil, conflict, sense of chaos and confusion, rage and frustration and overwhelming flood of negative input from world and societal events of the previous few years. In articulating those feelings and experiences and more alone as powerfully as it does, this album by All Your Sisters transcends genre by providing an example of how industrial and darkwave music can burst beyond established conventions with the sharp-edged and precise percussion framing and channeling the fiery energy at the core of the songwriting.\n\nAdia Victoria | Silences | Atlantic\n\nAdrianna Krikl | Celestial | Self-released\n\nAldous Harding | Designer | 4AD\n\nAlex Cameron | Miami Memory | Secretly Canadian\n\nAltas | All I Ever Wanted Was | Self-released\n\nA lush deepening of the band’s sweeping, cinematic aesthetic.\n\nAnamanaguchi | [USA] | Polyvinyl\n\nAndre Cactus | Dune Juice | Multidim Records\n\nAndy Stott | It Should Be Us | Modern Love\n\nAngel Olsen | All Mirrors | Jagjaguwar\n\nPoignantly dreamlike examination of identity in an age of universal scrutiny.\n\nBestial Mouths | INSHROUDSS | Rune & Ruin\n\nBellhoss | Geraniums | Self-released\n\nBuoyant, lo-fi slowcore love songs for inner awkward nerd.\n\nBethlehem Steel | s/t | Exploding in Sound\n\nThe utter exorcism of oppression through bursts of melodic/atonal poetry.\n\nBig Dopes | Crimes Against Gratitude | Self-released\n\nCaptivating indie pop earworm vingettes of American malaise and hope.\n\nBig Thief | U.F.O.F. / Two Hands | 4AD\n\nBison Bone | Take Up the Trouble | Self-released\n\nBlack Belt Eagle Scout | At The Party With My Brown Friends | Saddle Creek\n\nblack midi | Schlagenheim | Rough Trade Records\n\nA primer for the new avant-guitar rock revolution.\n\nBlack Mountain | Destroyer | Jagjaguwar\n\nBlanck Mass | Animated Violence Mild | Sacred Bones\n\nBlood Incantation | Hidden History of the Human Race | Dark Descent\n\nBoy Scouts | Free Company | ANTI-\n\nBriffaut | A Maritime Odyssey: Heaven is Only a Boat Race Away | GROUPHUG\n\nCalexico and Iron and Wine | Years to Burn | Subpop\n\nCat Tyson Hughes | Gentle Encounters With Things | Self-released\n\nAmbient, aural snapshots of memory fragments from the hypnogogic state.\n\nCau5er | The Tower | Self-released\n\nCeremony | In the Spirit World Now | Relapse Records\n\nChastity Belt | Chastity Belt | Hardly Art\n\nCheap Perfume | Burn It Down | Snappy Little Numbers\n\nChella and the Charm | Good Gal | Self-released\n\nChelsea Wolfe | Birth of Violence | Sargent House\n\nChimney Choir | (light shadow) | Self-released\n\nChromatics | Closer to Grey | Italians Do It Better\n\nclipping. | There Existed an Addiction to Blood | Sub Pop\n\nConsumer | In Computers | The Flenser\n\nControl Top | Covert Contracts | Get Better Records\n\nCop Circles | Vacation for Hurt | Self-released\n\nSubversive, Laurie Anderson-esque, New Age, No Wave send-up of corporate seminar jingles.\n\nCosey Fanni Tutti | Tutti | Conspiracy International\n\nHeavy and hypnotic industrial rave autobiography through sound.\n\nCurse | Metamorphism | Fake Crab Records\n\nEight, powerful, darkwave, prophetic warnings of our potential future.\n\nDanny Brown | uknowhatimsayin¿ | Warp Records\n\nRelentlessly inventive beats and tragicomedic, self-immolating swagger, sci-fi autobiography.\n\nDavi Valois | Bátraquio | Space Cow Music\n\nDeafkids | Metaprogramação | Neurot Recordings\n\nImmersive, ambient-industrial death grind.\n\nDoo Crowder | One For the Losers (& Other Pilgrims) | Self-released\n\nThe greatest art pop record since the death of Harry Nilsson.\n\nDog Basketball | s/t | Self-released\n\nDrab Majesty | Modern Mirror | Dais Records\n\nMoodily heartbreaking deep dive into the essence of love, memory and beauty.\n\nDrowse | Light Mirror/Second Self | The Flenser\n\nDude York | Falling | Hardly Art\n\nEarl Sweatshirt | FEET OF CLAY | Tan Cressida\n\nElizabeth Colour Wheel | Nocebo | The Flenser\n\nMajestic, urban-tribal, noise-sludge dream psych.\n\nEmpath | Active Listening: Night On Earth | Get Better Records\n\nEntrancer | Downgrade | Multidim Records\n\nEx Hex | It’s Real | Merge Records\n\nCosmic New Wave power pop gems beginning to end.\n\nFacs | Lifelike | Trouble In Mind\n\nFEELS / Shannon Lay | Post Earth / August | Wichita / Sub Pop\n\nFM Cubgod | Handsome?

A lot of high energy electronic dance music from DJ Fresh Kill and H-Lite, conceptual No Wave afrobeat post-disco from Cop Circles and the chill soundscaping of Earth Control Pill.\n\nWhat: The Sugar Hill Gang w/Furious 5 and White Fudge & The Antagonist\n\nWhen: Thursday, 08.29, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: For a lot of people The Sugar Hill Gang was the first rap band. But hip-hop pre-dated that by some years beginning with the soundsystem parties thrown by DJ Kool Herc. The Sugar Hill Gang was probably the earliest, commercially successful rap group with its 1979 hit song “Rapper’s Delight.” Also on this bill is the Furious 5 who, with Grandmaster Flash, had been a pioneering hip-hop crew before The Sugar Hill Gang hit the charts. So this is a bit like getting to see some of the earliest days of hip-hop as we know it in one show.\n\nFriday | August 30\n\nWhat: Meek, Future Scars, Kali Krone, Madelyn Burns\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Rhinoceropolis\n\nWhy: Meek mixes live drums with 31G and-esque processed vocals and electronic beats for a result that’s somewhere between noise and industrial. But really not like much except for maybe, maybe, solo USAISAMONSTER minus guitar. Santa Fe’s Future Scars is pretty much impossible to pigeonhole except to say it’s a rock or a pop band but it has the cutting, hard hitting guitar drive of metal, the delicacy and texture of the most tender indie rock, the soaring vocals of some torch song pop and post-punk rhythmic drive. And that’s for one song. Other times, meditative, heavy drone with introspective melodies like Emma Ruth Rundle. Kali Krone’s dreamy slowcore seems about perfect for the swelter cool off. Madelyn Burns’ spooky singer-songwriter should appeal to fans of early Grouper.\n\nWhat: Mutual Benefit w/Paw Paw and Card Catalog\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Mutual Benefit’s moody, soundscape-y pop songs are like getting a glimpse into someone’s having processed some deep thinking and distilled it to the poetic essence of those collective feelings. Loosely in the realm of Americana but with some great sound collage in the songwriting. Paw Paw is the project of former Woodsman drummer Eston Lathrop. Sort of ambient, sort of organic electronic pop, experimental solo guitar and synth songs to transport you to another, better place for a half an hour or so.\n\nWhat: Nuancer LP release w/SSIIGGHH, Dr3aMC@$T, Larians and Andy AI\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Daniel DiMarchi is the genius bass player in the great dream pop band Tyto Alba and great indie rock band Oxeye Daisy. But part of what makes him a great bass player is his true ear for tonality and composition which he brings to his experimental electronic pop project Nuancer and this is the release show of I Hardly Know Her. Also on the bill is a rare show from Larians, the solo project of former Male Blonding guitarist/singer Noah Simons. Though a guitarist, Simons has long had an interest in left field and forward thinking electronic music like Burial and Larians is the manifestation of that interest. And tonight Larians releases the first EP Looming Boy. If Nicolas Jaar made trap it might sound something like that.\n\nWhat: I Hate It Here, Causer, $addy, Eraserhead Fuckers and Kid Mask\n\nWhen: Friday, 08.30, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Thought//Forms Gallery\n\nWhy: The noise/heavy processed dance ambient/industrial show of the week. Granted the only one but heavy hitters like noise rapper Eraserhead Fuckers, hypnogogic environment sculptor Kid Mask and post-Goth ambient noise genius $addy alone make this a noteworthy lineup.\n\nSaturday | August 31\n\nWhat: The Velveteers UK tour kickoff w/Boot Gun, The Kinky Fingers and Bitter Suns\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: The Velveteers is a rock and roll trio from Denver whose live show is surprisingly powerful, forceful and grippingly emotional. The group is headed to the UK for a tour and this is the kickoff show with some of Denver’s other great, local, non-subgenre-specific rock bands including The Kinky Fingers who may be in the garage psych vein but its songwriting so tight and poignant it’s strikingly original.\n\nWhat: To Be Astronauts, Meet the Giant, The Center and Bad Britton\n\nWhen: Saturday, 08.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Hard rock band To Be Astronauts is relasing its “Thoughts and Prayers” single tonight. Hard rock is a little generic a term. So yeah, in their sound you’ll hear a bit of industrial rock, grunge and anthemic punk without being stuck on any of that. And other like-minded bands are on the bill including Meet the Giant who, despite their ethereal and moody atmospheric rock gets heavy and driving often enough that they’ll fit in here.\n\nSunday | September 1\n\nWhat: Molly Burch w/Jackie Cohen and Bellhoss\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.01, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Molly Burch has the kind of classic pop voice that many try to imitate but few nail the cadence and tonality that she seems to do so effortlessly. Her songs are intricate and delicate but her poetic observations sharp and illuminating. Jackie Cohen taps into an earlier era of music but her sound is more like a strange strain out of ABBA and 60s girl groups. Bellhoss is in good company here with Becky Hostetler’s idiosyncratic storytelling and inventive guitar work somewhere betwixt Dinosaur Jr, Edith Frost and Joanna Newsom. Yeah, let’s go with that until a better description of this unique songwriter and performer comes to mind. Hostetler will also make all the charmingly awkward jokes on stage so you don’t have to.\n\nWhat: The Wes Watkins (EP release) w/Dr3@m Ca$t and Snubluck\n\nWhen: Sunday, 09.01, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Wes Watkins is the brilliant trumpet player and vocalist whose talents have brought grace, cool and imagination to a broad swath of Denver music including his stint in Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats. But The Other Black, playing with poet, mystic, avant-garde hip-hop songwriter Bianca Mikahn, Wheelchair Sports Camp and others? His track record speaks for itself and tonight he’s releasing his new EP, a collection of jazz-inflected pop songs that seem to be streaming from a time in the future while sounding like it had to be recorded in the past putting Watkins out of time thus timeless, as seems appropriate for his soulful musical stylings.\n\nTuesday | September 3\n\nWhat: Shonen Knife w/Me Like Bees and Sexy Pistils\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Shonen Knife is the legendary Japanese punk bands whose roots go back to the late 70s when not many women were playing music in Japan much less in a punk band. Its songs are often about fanciful and mythical things but its songwriting is sharp, powerful and uplifting.\n\nWhat: Holy Grove (PDX), DØNE (SLC, ex-SubRosa), and Shepherd\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tooey’s Off Colfax\n\nWhy: A kind of doom metal show including the latest project from former SubRosa drummer Andy Patterson, DØNE.\n\nWhat: Ian Svenonius DJ set / Dream Wish of a Casino Soul Closing Party\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 09.03, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Pon Pon\n\nWhy: Philosopher, brilliant social commentator, media mogul and genius frontman (The Make-Up, Nation of Ulysses, Weird War, Chain and the Gang etc.) Ian Svenonius will hold court with one of his unique DJ sets for the closing party for the art exhibit Dream Wish of a Casino Soul.\n\nWednesday | September 4\n\nWhat: SunnO))) w/David Pajo and BIG BRAVE\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 09.04, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: SunnO))) creates such intense, dense frequencies and slow dynamics with, assuming Atilla Csihar will be on hand, otherworldly vocals that run a broad spectrum of tonality that your brain may work differently after the show. Calling it “extreme metal” just doesn’t cut it as it’s a truly ritualistic experience and so engulfing you feel like you’ve really been through something by the end. David Pajo is the iconic guitarist of Slint, The For Carnation and a host of other bands including a short stint in the death metal group Dead Child. His solo material runs a fairly wide range of sounds and emotions and as Papa M he recently toured with Mogwai. Not to be missed. BIG BRAVE is a cathartic collision of industrial, drone metal and emotional exorcism.\n\nWhat: Weird Wednesday: Gothsta, Dorian, Hypnotic Turtle Radio DJ, Cabal Art\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 09.04, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bowman’s Vinyl and Lounge\n\nWhy: Weird Wednesday is the monthly musical showcase that lives up to its name and curated by Claudia Woodman. This time she will be performing in her persona of Gothsta and for this performance she says, “Gothsta covers goth songs on the melodica that have some link to climate change-related themes, because Gothsta is depressed about global warming. Gothsta will have some extra special content that has to do with the Amazon burning and will be joined by Hypnotic Turtle’s Diablo Montalban for dueling melodicas/improv along with noise loops generated for this performance.” It’s rare that anything lives up to hype like that but this show probably will.\n\nThursday | October 11, 2018\n\nWho: Karl Blau w/Porlolo and High Plains Honky\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.11, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Karl Blau has had a rich and varied career spanning the past two decades or so. As a member of lo-fi rock band D+ he wrote songs and performed with Bret Lunsford formerly of Beat Happening and future Microphones and Mount Eerie mastermind Phil Elverum. As a solo artist and musical curator with his Kelp Lunacy Advanced Plagiarism Society musical subscription artist, Blau has been involved in making music in widely disparate styles and often hybridizing them or outright creating something that’s impossible to classify beyond maybe simply pop. In recent years, Blau has been writing songs that seem shaped by everything else he’s made up to now with bossa nova percussion, African pop vocal cadences, hip-hop-and-reggae-informed lyrical phrasing and indie/freak folk sensibilities. In the past Blau has performed solo with a loop pedal and pulled off what sounds like a full band minus robust drums so you’re never full sure what you’re in for barring that it’ll be exceptional.\n\nWho: The Church\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.11, 7:30/8 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Fox Theatre\n\nWhy: Australian rock band The Church is currently undertaking it’s tour for the thirtieth anniversary of its 1988 album Starfish. The band had already made a name for itself with fans of adventurous, inventive, literate and thoughtful yet heartfelt rock music. But Starfish was the group’s breakthrough to not just a wider audience but the mainstream with hits like “Under the Milky Way” and “Reptile.” While the group is justly celebrating the release of its iconic album for itself and fans that maybe didn’t get to see The Church in its 80s heyday (pardon the referential joke to the band’s 1985 album of the same name), the band’s new material is as vital as anything it has done in the past and you’ll get the best of both worlds at this show.\n\nFriday | October 12, 2018\n\nWhat: Anxious Little Friends Fest Day 1\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.12, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Record labels Snappy Little Numbers and Anxious and Angry collaborated on this two day festival at the Hi-Dive with some of the better local and not local punk and punk-related bands. For this night you can see two night headliners Off With Their Heads as well as Riverboat Gamblers, SPELLS, Dirty Few, Black Dots, Hooper and Modern Goon.\n\nWhat: Franksgiving 2018\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.12, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: This yearly event benefiting the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America is hosted by local connoisseur of weird music Franklin Bell. Naturally he always finds some of the best local odd yet accessible bands for the vent. As usual, Little Fyodor & Babushka Band, one of Denver’s longest running and most consistently interesting weirdo punk institutions will perform as well as not-widely-recognized-but-absolutely-a-local-rock-and-roll-legend Ralph Gean, Fyodor drummer Tricky Dick Wicket’s side project that isn’t Universal Devils, Whiskey Orphans, the “sweet and sensitive keyboard songs” of No Pants Katie with DJ Frank Bell spinning kooky kuts.\n\nWho: Screwtape w/Potato Pirates, Noogy, World Movement and Ultraviolet\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.12, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Screwtape’s politically-charged hardcore and dynamic live show has already made it a favorite among local fans of punk and the group is kicking off its latest tour to the south with this show sharing the bill with ska-punk veterans Potato Pirates and Colorado Springs hardcore outfit Ultraviolet.\n\nWho: Multidim Records Official Launch Party\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.12, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Leon\n\nWhy: Multidim Records is a new Denver-based label focusing on emerging artists in electronic and abstract music. Founded by Tommy Metz (Glissline) and Michael David King (Cities of Earth), this event will feature some of the artists on the label’s roster including the respective projects of the label’s founders as well as Andre Cactus + Ah, River and Mirror Fears.\n\nSaturday | October 13, 2018\n\nWho: ADULT. w/Plack Blague and Voight\n\nWhen: Saturday, 10.13, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: For twenty years, Detroit’s ADULT. has been on the forefront of mixing electronic pop, techno and industrial music with an experimental flair. In the late 90s, ADULT. helped to pioneer the sound and aesthetic that came to be called electroclash by around the turn of the century. As the duo explored sounds and performance it garnered a cult following among connoisseurs of electronic music paired with a dynamic and sometimes confrontational performance style. It adopted and mutated the sound and production ideas running through underground techno throughout the 2000s giving it a powerful and imaginative soundscape to match singer Nicola Kuperus’s emotionally-nuanced vocals. The band’s 2018 album This Behavior was the darker side of the songwriting that went into the 2017 album Detroit House Guests—both rich and dense with sonic detail and inventive rhythms.\n\nAlso on the this leg of the tour is Lincoln, Nebraska’s Plack Blague. Raws Schlesinger had been, maybe still is, involved in the Nebraska grind and extreme metal scene in various bands. But Plack Blague is a bit like a leather daddy Big Freedia but with beats that are the industrial and techno analogue to sissy bounce. On previous occasions in Denver, Plack Blague may have seemed to be a sonically abrasive spectacle but the act’s songs have taken on a compelling form beyond the spectacle without sacrificing the striking visual aspect of the band including Schleslinger’s undeniably amazing dance moves.\n\nWhat: Anxious Little Friends Fest Day 2\n\nWhen: Saturday, 10.13, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: This second night of Anxious Little Friends Fest includes performances from Off With Their Heads, The Bollweevils, SPELLS, Friends of Cesar Romero, Lawsuit Models, Great American House Fire and Bad Year.\n\nWhat: KGNU Quarterly Showcase\n\nWhen: Saturday, 10.13, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: This edition of the KGNU Quarterly Showcase features some of Denver’s most innovative electronic artists. Shocker Mom’s dreamy, ambient R&B is the latest vehicle from Robin Walker. As a member of Cougar Pants, walker, along with Jessica Hughes, made a particularly tender and emotionally deep yet playful type of indie pop. As a solo performer, Walker distinguished herself as a talented vocalist and songwriter whose use of sound taps into a pre-linguistic part of the human brain, communicating the vibrations of a loving, healing aspect of the universe—which she has manifested most strongly with Shocker Mom. Also catch her in excellent hip-hop duo Nighttimeschoolbus. Larians is the solo side project of Male Blonding singer/guitarist Noah Simons. His brilliant take on IDM, techno and ambient may just be getting started but it’s obvious he’s learned a few things to build beyond from Burial and Aphex Twin. Bios+a+ic is the solo project of Textures Ambient Showcase and Symbolic Insight head Wesley Davis. All of his albums with the project are different and conceptual, representing ideas and sound experiments that tickled Davis’ imagination at the time of their creation. Also on the bill are All Mask and DJ Winter\n\nSunday | October 14, 2018\n\nWho: Henry Rollins Travel Slideshow Tour\n\nWhen: Sunday, 10.14, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: It’s been a good longer while than usual since Henry Rollins has done one of his spoken tours. This time around he’s sharing his photography and telling stories from his travels around the world. His spoken word shows are always worth checking out and with the images to prompt his memory and engage those who show up it will be a more immersive experience when coupled with his already fantastic storytelling.\n\nWho: Future Generations w/Zuli and Whiskey Autumn\n\nWhen: Sunday, 10.14, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Brooklyn has long been home to eclectic indie rock with artists, of necessity, trying out innovative musical ideas and strong songwriting in order to stand out. Future Generations’ 2018 album Landscape is like a stroll through a person’s day and life and composed as though the melodies and rhythms are a soundtrack with electronic, ambient textures to give the songwriting a context that connects all the music. Sure, each piece can be enjoyed on its own but the record feels like a new take on the classic album format from a time when bands felt like there were no throwaway songs and thought in terms of interconnecting themes. Probably not a concept album but one that works on a very conceptual level too.\n\nTuesday | October 16, 2018\n\nWho: A Place to Bury Strangers w/Kraus and cindygod\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 10.16, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: A Place To Bury Strangers is often credited as one of the bands that helped to re-popularize shoegaze in the underground. But the band’s contribution has run deeper as guitarist/vocalist Oliver Ackerman created unique guitar pedals with functionality that has helped push the sound of the instrument into new realms of noise and texture. As part of the pedal and sound equipment company/DIY space Death By Audio, Ackerman and company contributed to its creative community in a direct, pragmatic way. APTBS fused lo-fi, shoegaze, noise, post-punk and hardcore in fascinating ways. For an album or two it felt like maybe the project had plateaued even if the songwriting was still good. But the 2018 album Pinned with new drummer Lia Simon Braswell demonstrated that the band hasn’t run out of ideas for heady and disorienting soundscaping. Opening the show is Denver’s cindygod, the follow-up band to shoegaze/noise rock duo Gauntlet Hair. Now the band is a quartet with an even more exhilarating panoply of sound.\n\nWednesday | October 17, 2018\n\nWho: Sarah Ruth Alexander, Polecat Moon Pussy and Gold Trash\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 10.17, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Thought//Forms\n\nWhy: [update, Shiny Around the Edges no longer on the bill] Sarah Ruth Alexander’s brooding yet luminous compositions utilizing effected vocals and acoustic instruments have made Dallas’ They Say The Wind Made Them Crazy one of the more interesting bands and critically acclaimed bands that in the past his intentionally been more or less off the internet because its music works best live. Alexander’s solo performances recall some of the most chilling moments of Nico’s solo work, The Marble Index, Desertshore and The End in particular, in its use of organic instruments in a manner suggesting an electronic music aesthetic as a way to tap into deeply rooted spaces in the psyche. One might also hear in her songs resonances with Jarboe’s more intensely tranquil performances with Swans. Moon Pussy is a noise rock band from Denver and Gold Trash could be said to be a soulful yet noisy version of an electroclash band.\n\nThursday | July 26, 2018\n\nWho: I Heart Monkey Mania: Mr. Pacman, Robot Peanut Butter & The Shooting Stars, Cyclo-Sonic and Moon Pussy, visuals by Chris Bagley\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.26, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Syntax Physic Opera\n\nWhy: Mr. Pacman is not a band that should be dismissed as mere gimmick. Yes, the band dresses up like characters from a cosplay of some weird, ancient Japanese video game. But it’s live drums, keytar, electronic drums and other instrumentation with, indeed, fairly silly songs but performed with a disorienting intensity and earnestness. At times it’s fun but moderately scary. Which is what any good band should be at least once in a while. Mr. Pacman is that pretty much every time. Robot Peanut Butter & The Shooting Stars is a more out downtempo band and Cyclo-Sonic includes former members of Denver punk legends The Rok Tots, Choosey Mothers and The Frantix. Chris Bagley, one of the filmmakers of the 2008 documentary Wesley Willis’ Joyrides, will provide visuals and make it even more of a trip.\n\nWho: Glasss Presents: The Speakeasy Series Season 2 Finale w/Brother Saturn, Equine, VAHCO, MYTHirst, Bowshock\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.26, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hooked On Colfax\n\nWhy: This is the final show of the second season of Glasss Records’ The Speakeasy Series. It’ll be more of an ambient show with Brother Saturn’s soothing and abstract guitar and synth collages, Equine’s avant-guitar drone and beats, VAHCO’s beat-driven soul,. MYTHirst’s bright soundscapes and ukulele and whatever it is one might call Bowshock’s mixture of influences from space rock, reggae and improvisational composition.\n\nWho: Har Mar Superstar sings Sam Cooke\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.26, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Har Mar Superstar cleaned up but good for this series of shows in which he dresses up in a suit and tie (which may or may not come off before the set is over in the weather Denver has been experiencing as of late). Sean Tillman (Har Mar Superstar) and his band will perform several of Sam Cooke’s classic R&B hits and maybe even some deep cuts. Seeing as Har Mar’s usual schtick is singing R&B and soul and making a spectacle of himself but pulling off the singing like he was born to it, this is not a huge leap for the performer. And at this time, the socially conscious end of Cooke’s music seems more relevant than ever.\n\nFriday | July 27, 2018\n\nWho: Red Baraat\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.27, 5:30 – 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Clyfford Still Museum\n\nWhy: Red Baraat’s syncretic pop spans South Asian musical styles, Western funk, Afrobeat and Caribbean pop to create something that’s celebratory, immediately accessible and deep. The sprawling band is playing this free concert at Clyfford Still Museum in central Denver in the wake of the release of its latest record, 2018’s Sound The People. With its cultural scope and implicit message of human unity, Red Baraat’s music is an international call of all people to come together to resist the rising wave of aggressive authoritarianism plaguing the world today. Beyond the heady messaging, Red Baraat is a reminder that sprawling, seemingly improvisational compositions needn’t be the pure realm of jam bands and that it is a component of popular musical styles across the world.\n\nWho: SUPER PARTY Day 1: Presented by Remixed Gifts and Hot Sauce the Dog\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.27,7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Remixed Gifts 70 S. Broadway\n\nWhy: This parallel event to the UMS amidst the dense and varied offerings there is out on by the boutique Remixed Gifts and the Denver culture-centered comic ‘zine Hot Sauce the Dog written and drawn by the gifted singer-songwriter Rachael Pollard whose new band DEN |V|OTHER will kick off the event at 7 p.m. followed by Joe Sampson at 8 and R A R E B Y R D $ at 9. Simply some of the best people from Denver you can see at any time. The event runs two days picking up again on Saturday at 2:15 p.m. with Bonnie Weimer.\n\nWho: Larians, Real Gongs, Jumanjuhad\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.27, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Denver Bicycle Café Beer Hall\n\nWhy: Larians is Male Blonding frontman Noah Simons’ IDM/experimental electronic project and Real Gongs is that of Male Blonding guitarist Bryce Navin. If the UMS is too much or not of interest for whatever reason or if you have some time Friday night, highly recommended.\n\nWho: Denver Broncos UK, Echo Beds, Simulators and Shadows Tranquil\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.27, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Syntax Physic Opera\n\nWhy: Denver Broncos UK is sort of a post-punk side project of Slim Cessna’s Auto Club so a good fit with math-y post punk duo Simulators (think like Shellac but stripped down to even more of the bare essentials) and Echo Beds whose forthcoming album Buried Language (due out August 18 on The Flenser) pushes their harsh organic-industrial soundscape further than previous boundaries.\n\nSaturday | July 28, 2018\n\nWho: SUPER PARTY Day 2: Presented by Remixed Gifts and Hot Sauce the Dog\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.28, 2 p.m.\n\nWhere: Remixed Gifts 70 S. Broadway\n\nWhy: Day 2 of SUPER PARTY, a free event amidst the UMS. The following is today’s schedule: 2 – Bonnie Weimer, 3 – Jen Korte, 3:45 Ted Thacker of The Red Tack, 4:30 Andy Thomas solo, 5:30 Kissing Party, 6:30 Teacup Gorilla\n\nWho: Car Seat Headrest w/Naked Giants\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.28, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere:The Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest is one of the most prolific and interesting songwriters of his generation. Having put out nine albums independently before signing to Matador in 2015, Toledo clearly didn’t need a label but the distribution and marketing arm of one helped to get his music to a wider audience. The new Car Seat Headrest album, 2018’s Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), is brimming with what has made the band impossible to dismiss with lazy genre designations. Vocals that sometimes soar with an upsweep of deeply felt emotion, sometimes speak quietly about the concerns of the moment that flood your mind and won’t let go. Lo-fi guitar composition in the vein of maybe a Pavement or Sebadoh but informed more by underground rock of the 2000s like Jay Reatard’s more sublimely ethereal moments and more modern lo-fi stars like No Age, Times New Viking and artists from the Siltbreeze imprint. Beyond just the sonics, though, the new record is an exploration of the concerns, anxieties and self-image of a young person in an era when destructive, and self-destructive messages, have been repackaged and made to seem like a viable option. Car Seat Headrest’s new album is a compassionte and vibrant rejection of much of that as well as a suggestion of a path of discovery/rediscovery of what’s truly important in one’s life.\n\nTuesday | July 31, 2018\n\nWho: Weezer and the Pixies w/Sleigh Bells\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 07.31, 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fiddler’s Green\n\nWhy: Weezer got to be in on the tail end of the legitimate wave of alternative rock in the early 90s. Its 1994 self-titled album, “The Blue Album,” yielded a couple of hits with “Buddy Holly” and “Undone – The Sweater Song.” The crunchy melodies and quiet-loud dynamics pioneered by groups like Mission of Burma and Pixies, who had then recently split, continued the tradition of nerdy punk rockers making music that took that spirit of punk to different places. Weezer could have been another fuzzy, alternative rock/pop punk band with that kind of sunny Southern California flavor. But Weezer’s songs, even when it’s indulging in some fun-loving goofiness, had at its core an impulse to resist being pigeonholed or musically fitting into a specific trend.\n\nAfter its first record, singer Rivers Cuomo wanted to change gears dramatically and nearly made a science fiction-themed concept album but what came out instead is what could be argued is the band’s most artistically interesting record to date, 1996’s Pinkerton and its darkly conflicted lyrics. Cuomo has since all but disavowed the album as a reminder of a painful time. And to Weezer’s credit, the group has not spent its time as a band trying to recapture past glory. Its most recent full-length album, 2017’s Pacific Daydream, reflects not only Cuomo’s personal alienation but the anomy of our time when many people feel a disconnect with the lives they might want, however modest the aspiration, and the reality we face with diminished expectations. A melancholy set of songs? Maybe not obviously so but despite the title, a song like “Beach Boys” sounds like something that, psychologically speaking, was written in a vast room lit only by small windows on a cloudy day reminiscing about what once brought one joy. Like a less dire but no less impactful musical version of William Friedkin’s depiction of life in the City of Angels.\n\nThat Weezer is co-headlining with Pixies seems fitting. Both bands find themselves perhaps having to reinvent themselves for the current era even as their back catalog speaks for itself. Pixies are obviously the influential alternative rock band from Boston, darlings of college radio in the late 80s and early 90s and breaking up with its legacy intact. The band’s humor, unhinged energy, idiosyncratic songwriting filled with seething emotion, delicacy of feeling, have kept its music fresh decades onward. Like any band worth its salt, Pixies also produced new music post 2003 reunion once its internal dynamics leveled out. The group’s first album with former touring, now permanent, bassist Paz Lenchantin, 2016’s Head Carrier, isn’t generally as immediately cathartic and as vital as the group’s 80s and 90s output, it proved Pixies can still write material worth a listen and highlights the band’s ability to clue in to unusual sounds and rhythm and texture ideas that other established artists often don’t.\n\nWho: Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks w/Soccer Mommy\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 07.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Stephen Malkmus is obviously the singer and one of the guitarists in lo-fi slacker psyche legends Pavement. But his songs under his own name and with The Jicks are as worthy as anything he did with Pavement. Free to explore unusual melodies, self-indulge a wide range of guitar styles and fusing noise, jangle rock, improvisational instincts, 70s rock, psychedelia and prog, Stephen Malkmus with the Jicks is capable of coming up with refreshingly unusual songs even if they all have the stamp of eccentricity and imagination that Malkmus has brought to all his projects. The group’s 2018 record Sparkle Hard reflects Malkmus examination of the modern world and his place in it as a white man, and father, in his fifties who is still engaged in doing the thing he’s best at—writing unusual rock music—when the world seems to be falling apart and changing at a rapid pace. In typical fashion, Malkmus has a worthwhile and interesting take on all of it.\n\nOpener for this tour, Soccer Mommy, is an interesting pairing because Sophie Allison’s songs have a layered and emotionally rich, compositional style with a sound collage quality that isn’t at first obvious. Her 2018 debut studio album Clean is a solid 10-song collection of sophisticated pop. Unlike many young songwriters, Allison, now 21, doesn’t sound like she’s tapping into a particular era of the 90s or the 2000s except for maybe Mitski and Japanese Breakfast. But, really, those are exceptionally respectable touchstones. What is also noteworthy is Allison’s range of dynamics, command of what, in a film score, might be called sound design, materfully orchestrating textural and atmospheric elements to augment her storytelling. With a debut so strong, one can only hope we’ve not yet seen Allison at her peak.\n\nWho: ModPods w/R A R E B Y R D $\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 07.31, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mutiny Information Café\n\nWhy: ModPods from Los Angeles with its mixture of electronic post-punk and dance music sounds more like some kind of band from Baltimore in the 2000s or the kind of band that would have played The Smell in its heyday with an eclectic spirit not trapped in adherence to a stylistic subgenre. Either way its beat-driven songs have an edge and an 8-bit melodic fringe on its minimal synth melodies. Fronted by Myriad Slits, the trio, including Mindee Jorgensen and Daniel Guzman who switch up instruments regularly so that the musical duties never really become rote, is like an intentionally lo-fi synth pop/dance band.\n\nAlso on this bill is R A R E B Y R D $, the hip-hop trio that keeps pushing boundaries, including its own, in terms of beatmaking and Key Lady’s and KoKo La’s alchemical vocal interplay. The way some guitarists create interesting shapes for chords, the members of this group creates interesting synergy of sounds between vocals, beats and Michael Blomquist’s organic percussion. It’s a deeply emotional experience that you share with the band. It’s like alternative hip-hop if made by people who take great joy in seeing exactly what you can do with a synthesizer and a sampler to make something entrancing and meaningful. Hypnagogic post-disco, endorphin releasing, gangsta dub.\n\nWednesday | August 1, 2018\n\nWho: Shocker Mom, Spargob and R A R E B Y R D $\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 08.1, 8-11 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fort Greene\n\nWhy: It’s a free show and you get to see some of Denver’s best producers of electronic music in the underground. For R A R E B Y R D $, see above. Shocker Mom is Robin Walker who to the big wide world outside of Colorado is not known at all. But for those that have been able to witness her talents as a solo artist, member of lo-fi pop phenoms Cougarpants or one half of the hip-hop duo Nighttimeschoolbus, Walker is a singular talent. As Shocker Mom, Walker taps into her broad musical experience to produce tracks that blur the line between hip-hop, trap, IDM, ambient, dubtechno and indie pop. Aleeya Wilson is perhaps most well-known for her avant-garde guitar/noise project Death In Space. But now the Girls Rock Denver alumn is writing music as Spargob, her production project so expect something refreshingly weird and imaginative.\n\nWho: Weird Wednesday: Universal Devils, Limber Wolf, The Far Stairs facebook.com/events/509245982828786\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 08.1, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: 3 Kings Tavern\n\nWhy: This edition of Weird Wednesday, Claudia Woodman’s monthly at 3 Kings Tavern, will include Rick Layton’s solo experimental metal project Universal Devils. Layton is a talented multi-instrumentalist who spent several years as the drummer for weirdo punk band Little Fyodor & Babushka Band. The Far Stairs is fronted by former Hindershot keyboard player Jesse Livingston. Imagine a manic New Wave/New Romantics/power pop band influenced by They Might Be Giants. But not just good, but great.\n\nThursday | March 8, 2018\n\nWho: Musical Mayhem: Jim Davies (GA), Universal Devils and Enji\n\nWhen: Thursday, 03.08, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: This half of March’s programme for Musical Mayhem at the Skylark includes Georgia-based weirdo songwriter Jim Davies, solo videogram soundtrack-esque multi-instrumental looper Enji and Universal Devils. The latter is Tricky Dick Wicket, the drummer for Little Fyodor & Babushka band for over a decade. Universal Devils is his solo project in which he plays guitar, drums and other instruments in a kind of truly unique mix of metal and country and blues. Calling it “avant-garde” doesn’t quite do it justice because it’s accessible with pretty conventional songwriting even if the sounds used in the way they’re used are far from mundane.\n\nWho: Elettrodomestico (Jane Wiedlin and Pietro Straccia)\n\nWhen: Thursday, 03.08, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: BarFly\n\nWhy: Jane Wiedlin is doing a Q&A before this performance for the screening of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Afterward, her band Elettrodomestico will perform in BarFly, the bar/venue attached to Alamo Drafthouse on West Colfax. The band formed in December 2016 following The Go-Go’s’ “Farewell Tour” (the great new wave band will perform again in 2018) when Wiedlin and Italian musician Pietro Straccia bonded over their mutual love the then recently passed David Bowie. The band the duo started is pretty different from The Go-Go’s and Bowie except for a knack for writing energetic pop songs with a little grit and thoughtfulness and mood to give the music some depth thematically and musically. To the credit of both artists Elettrodomestico is in no way riding anyone’s legacy or coattails. Rather, like Cindy Wilson formerly of the B-52s, it’s a reinvention and one worth listening to separate from any past associations.\n\nFriday | March 9, 2018\n\nWho: Terminals, Gort Vs. Goom, New Standards Men, Pygmy Grizzly, Frank Bell\n\nWhen: Friday, 03.09, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bar Bar\n\nWhy: This appears to be a bill of instrumental-focused, experimental music rooted in rock sounds and aesthetics bands. Terminals is sort of an improv post-rock/post-industrial band with guitars, synths, drums, bass. No set is ever the same but the group is more than capable of generating deep atmospheric magic. Gort Vs. Goom is a drums and electric bass duo who make the kind of music that could be described as what might happen if the Melvins set out to make a surf band dedicated to Minutemen. Sure the guys in GVG have vocals but it’s almost like surreal slam poetry. New Standards Men are probably a post-punk band but their sound sounds like it drew heavy influence from some of the more experimental bands on the Thrill Jockey imprint. Like Tortoise or A Minor Forest but with some expansive noise tones in the mix.\n\nWho: Larians (Noah Simons solo), Houseplants, Jumanjihad\n\nWhen: Friday, 03.09, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Denver Bicycle Café Beer Hall\n\nWhy: Noah Simons is perhaps best known for being the charismatic singer of post-punk band Male Blonding. But his musical interests range pretty far and his solo project Larians, which hasn’t performed live since maybe an RTD (Ready To Dance) event at Rhinoceropolis in 2014, is more in an experimental electronic music and dubtechno vein. Think something like Plaid’s tranquil melodics and use of synth strings alongside Burial-esque bass sculpting and persistent yet dissolving and reconfiguring atmospheres as an element of the beat. How will this all sound at Denver Bicycle Café rather than the main room at The Black Box? You’ll have to show up to find out. But for a taste of what Larians is about, Simons released the excellent “Dwell Led” single in February 2018.\n\nSaturday | March 10, 2018\n\nWho: Kikagaku Moyo w/Tjutjuna and DJ Rett Rogers\n\nWhen: Saturday, 03.10, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Kikagaku Moyo is a Tokyo-based psychedelic rock/avant-garde band. With its roots in a project between Go Kurosawa and Tomo Katsurada busking the streets of Japan’s most populous metropolis, Kikagaku Moyo has, to some extent, gone against the grain of Japanese culture in the way Ghost did when it started up in the 80s similarly playing music on the streets, subways and ruins of ancient temples in and around Tokyo. Kikagaku Moyo got its proper start as a band when Go’s brother Ryu returned from learning sitar from one of the world’s masters, Manilal Nag in India. Incorporating elements of noise and ambient music, Kikagaku Moyo’s songs express a broad range of sonic experimentation from extended psych freakout jams to tranquil yet haunted folk songs. Unlike many bands that have dipped into the realm of psychedelia and prog, this Japanese quintet doesn’t get stuck in a single or predictable mode. Sharing the stage this night is Denver-based experimental psych band Tjutjuna. Also with musical inspirations traceable to the more out 70s prog and Japanese psych/noise bands like Acid Mothers Temple, Tjutjuna’s hypnotic oeuvre set itself apart from the trendy psych stuff that seemed to hover at the edges of all popular rock music from 2008 onward.\n\nWho: Daikaiju w/TripLip, Dr. Zilog and Smellephant\n\nWhen: Saturday, 03.10, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: 7th Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Daikaij is to surf rock what Crash Worship was to noise and post-punk—as experienced, as much an exuberant collective cult ritual as music. Catch the band tonight at 7th Circle or Sunday at the Triple Nickel in Colorado Springs.\n\nWho: King Eddie (video release) w/déCollage\n\nWhen: Saturday, 03.10, 10 p.m.\n\nWhere: BarFly\n\nWhy: Tonight King Eddie releases the video for “Enter the Man” from its 2017 boundary pushing psychedelic rock album Holographic Universe. Both that band and the playfully surrealistic psychedelic pop band déCollage will perform before a screening of Renée Laloux’s 1973 animated science fiction classic Fantastic Planet. King Eddie sounds like maybe the music had its origins in writing what had become a trendy psych rock but Jay Mars and his bandmates injected heaps of imagination into the songwriting and arrangements to produce a body of work that synthesizes pop, psych and the avant-garde with the aesthetics of the virtual reality visuals that have become a bit of a specialty for Mars.\n\nWednesday | March 14, 2018\n\nWho: Uppermost w/Snubluck and Zurc\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 03.14, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Behdad Nejatbakhshe, aka Uppermost, left his life trajectory into a career as a lawyer to pursue making music. Eight albums in, with the forthcoming Perseverance due out March 23, Uppermost has created a body of work that is a synthesis of pure electronic production and more analog musical elements. For instance on his 2017 album, the loosely space-themed Origins, the producer incorporated live guitar and orchestral arrangements in the recording process. The songs tend to have a bright, upbeat quality with a quality that suggests peaceful spring days and gentle breezes. That Uppermost is inspired by the likes of Burial, Flume and Bonobo should come as no surprise since his own compositions have a soothing yet energetic quality as well. With Perseverance, Uppermost has crafted a body of songs that have an expansive spaciousness with a daydream-y quality that first came back into vogue with the so-called chillwave artists—bright tones, hypnotic yet uplifting atmospheric swells and smooth but irresistible low end. The record feels built for summer nights at casual hangouts with friends and is arriving just in time.\n\nWho: Cars & Trains and Curta album release w/Utajahs and Nighttimeschoolbus visuals by Skyrider\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 03.10, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: 7th Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Curta’s new record, End of Future Park, sounds like the natural progression from its dystopian predecessor, 2015’s Replica. Curta’s music has always seemed to sit somewhere between the no-rules-use-of-sounds beatmaking of turn of the century alternative hip-hop, industrial, noise and collage sound composition. End of Future Park is no different but with that album, rapper Jake Danna captures the time between 2016 and 2017 (and, let’s be real, 2018 so far) when underground culture seemed to be under attack and the erosion of all civil institutions and of civility itself and the postmodern nihilism as expressed in a completely understandable cynicism that has blighted the public and personal discourse seemingly everywhere you go. Across the whole record, Danna confronts his own cynicism and there’s a bit of a different feel to this record than a lot of music coming out of late in a way more people probably need to hear—a tone of wanting to find and create a self and a society where that deep rooted cynicism isn’t entirely justified. The record comes out on March 19, 2018 but you can probably pick up a copy at this show where also on the bill is Nighttimeschoolbus, the duo that answers the question of what happens when an idiosyncratic indie pop artist teams up with a masterful alternative hip-hop producer."
