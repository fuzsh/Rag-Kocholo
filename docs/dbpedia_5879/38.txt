Its been 21 years and the punk band MxPX still continues! Dubbed as being part of the Christian Punk genre, the three members: Mike Herrera (vocals/bass), Tom Wisniewski (guitar), and Yuri Ruley (drums) all prefer to just be called a “punk rawk” band. All three came together during their years of high school from Bremerton, Washington, releasing nine albums with their latest titled Plans Within Plans. The band has been on a US tour reuniting fans with some skate punk nostalgia. They’ll be headlining a show at The Glass House this Saturday, February 1. Join them along with supporting acts Allister and Kristopher Rose (from The Ataris).

Tickets to the show are $20-25, show starts at 7 PM, and the event is all ages. You can purchase tickets by clicking here or try and win a pair of tickets with us by entering the contest below!
