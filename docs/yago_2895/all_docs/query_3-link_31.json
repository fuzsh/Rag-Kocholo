Steeped in tradition and driven by their Buddhist beliefs, the ceremonies take place over six days, usually months after the actual death. The primary reason for the delay is the amount of work involved in building and creating the ceremonial funeral pyre, on which the remains are cremated. These ceremonies take place on the Sanam Luang, a large open field and park, just north of the Grand Palace complex. Once the cremation ceremonies are finished, the ashes are taken to the Grand Palace briefly, before being enshrined within a Buddhist temple. The Kings are traditionally enshrined in the base of a Buddha statue within one of the temples. The ashes of other members of the royal family are typically housed in smaller memorials or monuments at the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit.\n\nRama I\n\nKing Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke\n\nreigned April 6, 1782 – September 7, 1809\n\nWikipedia: Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, Rama I\n\nKing Rama I was born March 20, 1736, in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.
