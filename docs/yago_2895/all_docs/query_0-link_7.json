        "text": "Chapter 2\n\nDara Rasami’s Career in the Siamese Royal Palace\n\nDARA RASAMI’S ARRIVAL IN the palace marks the beginning of her career as a royal consort at the same time that Siam’s King Chulalongkorn was implementing structural changes to the Siamese state that would eventually end palace women’s political relevance. While Dara Rasami’s parents were aware of Chulalongkorn’s “modern” mindset, they did not suspect he had already begun reshaping Siam into a form fundamentally different from their understanding of how kingdoms had traditionally worked in mainland Southeast Asia. As discussed in the previous chapter, Chulalongkorn and the elites who served as his cabinet were keenly aware of European powers’ efforts to expand their colonial footprints in Southeast Asia. In a bid to make Siam appear too civilized for Europeans to colonize, Siamese elites embarked on a program of self-modernization that depended largely on emulating key colonial practices—a mode described as “crypto-colonialism.” This term, coined by anthropologist Michael Herzfeld, denotes the imposition of colonial practices and structures by states that were never formally colonized by a European power—a practice sometimes referred to in the Siamese context as semi-colonialism or self-colonization.1\n\nIn the Siamese case, crypto-colonial practices were exercised over subjects by the elites themselves, led by King Chulalongkorn. Not long after ascending the throne in 1868, young Chulalongkorn traveled to various colonial states in the region to observe their administrative practices and “was deeply impressed with what Europeans had done” in Singapore, Java, and India.2 On his return to Bangkok, he set about making changes intended to bring Siam more in line with these states, so as to demonstrate Siam’s fitness for membership among the ranks of civilized modern states.\n\nBritain in particular served as Siam’s ideal model of a modern monarchy: Chulalongkorn created a royal privy council on the British model; he sent his sons to be educated in England; and he also took the unprecedented step of appointing his successor, anointing his eldest son Vajirunhit Crown Prince (an event which coincides with Dara Rasami’s entry to the palace as a consort). He also abolished the requirement for commoners to prostrate themselves before royalty, expanding on his father Mongkut’s efforts to render the monarch more accessible to the common people.3 Nonetheless, Chulalongkorn embraced royal polygyny despite his keen awareness of Western disapproval of the practice. Indeed, his reign became the high era of Siam’s palace women: the population of royal consorts reached its zenith of 153 women. Hence Dara’s career provides both a window into the rarefied world of Siam’s palace culture and a convenient frame for viewing the historical changes underway that ultimately brought that culture to an end.\n\nDara’s Arrival in Bangkok\n\nIn late 1885, thirteen-year-old Dara Rasami stepped aboard a houseboat to accompany her father, Intawichyanon, several hundred miles downriver on one of his semiannual visits to Bangkok. This journey’s purpose, however, was unique: to present Dara Rasami for service as a consort to King Chulalongkorn in the Inner Palace. The trip was timed to coincide with the events celebrating the appointment of Chulalongkorn’s son, Vajirunhit, to the rank of Crown Prince in January 1886. Dara Rasami’s father would play a special role in these events—and receive a royal promotion to boot.\n\nBecause the river route offered far quicker and more convenient transport in those days than overland travel, a caravan of boats was laden with the food and supplies needed for the journey. For several weeks, Chiang Mai’s royal entourage traveled down the Ping and Chao Phraya rivers, disembarking at waterfalls and rapids while the boats were portaged. It took three weeks traveling down the Ping River for Dara and her father to reach central Siam, where their arrival was received with great fanfare.4 The floating convoy of houseboats was met by King Chulalongkorn himself at Bang Pa-In palace, located about forty miles upstream from Bangkok.5 There Dara Rasami underwent a thamkhwan (spirit-calling) ceremony, after which she was fêted with a grand feast attended by a number of the Chakri nobility. Afterward, Dara and her attendants, Khai Kaew and Bua Rawaan, returned to their boat and were guided the rest of the way down the river to Bangkok by Siamese officials. After docking at the pier next to the Royal Palace, the young princess was conducted “in an honorable manner” to the interior of the Royal Palace, which had been decorated to be “glittering and dazzling to the eye.”6\n\nHaving safely delivered Dara Rasami to Bangkok, her father took a prominent position in the procession of royals celebrating Vajirunhit’s elevation to Crown Prince. Intawichyanon rode in seventeenth place among the highest members of Siamese high royalty, the king’s own brothers and sisters, in the royal cavalcade through Bangkok; he was also allowed to participate in the water blessing ceremony for the Crown Prince.7 Noteworthy here is that Intawichyanon was the only ruler of a Siamese prathetsarat (tributary kingdom) to participate in these events. Chulalongkorn also presented King Intawichyanon with the medal of the Order of ChulaChomKlao (the Siamese equivalent of a knighthood, established by and named after Chulalongkorn himself); he was also the only ruler of any of Siam’s tributary kingdoms to receive this honor during Chulalongkorn’s reign.8 It appears that Intawichyanon and Thipkraisorn’s gambit—circulating rumors of Queen Victoria’s desire to adopt Dara Rasami—had succeeded, greatly benefitting the Chiang Mai royal family. Whether the plan ultimately improved the fortunes of their subjects (or the future sovereignty of Lan Na), however, is highly doubtful.9\n\nIntawichyanon’s promotion and new name accorded him an even higher level of social status back home and helped raise the status of the rest of Chiang Mai’s nobility as well: they were allowed to use the surname na Chiang Mai (of the city of Chiang Mai) in parallel to Siam’s royal elites who used the surname naAyutthaya. At the same time, however, Chiang Mai’s sovereignty was fatally undermined by Bangkok’s “blessing.” After the ratification of the second Chiang Mai treaty in 1883, dozens of Siamese officials were stationed in Chiang Mai under its provisions, making the international court a permanent fixture (and a model for the nascent Siamese court system). The treaty also established a local police force to keep law and order and prevent banditry. At the same time, a new system of taxation was put in place, shifting the collection of taxes to (mostly Chinese) collectors who preferred cash over goods—a move that greatly burdened many cash-poor small landholders and traders, while putting more money in the pockets of Chiang Mai’s nobles. These measures would lead to conflict in the coming decades, widening the gap between local nobles and their people—and making it impossible for our young princess to return home again.\n\nThe World of the Siamese Inner Palace\n\nYoung Dara Rasami must have wondered about the new world to which she was traveling. What was Bangkok like compared to her hometown, the capital city of Chiang Mai? Would she be able to have her favorite foods and music, or other familiar things from home? Dara Rasami’s parents, who had visited the Royal Palace in Bangkok many times, had likely described to her their impressions of what they had seen there, although Dara herself had never been there before. To prepare her for her entry to the Siamese palace, Dara Rasami had undergone several years’ training in the Thai language and the customs of the Siamese royal court. But it would be very different to live there under the watchful eyes of the Siamese palace folk, without the protection of her parents—or aunt—to fall back on. One imagines a nervously excited Dara Rasami and her attendants stealing glimpses of the busy streets of Bangkok from within the curtained palanquins carrying them from the riverside to inside the high walls of the Royal Palace. Once they entered the women’s quarters there, it would likely be their last sight of the outside world for a long time. The Inner Palace, as it was known, was a space within the space of the Royal Palace: a world run by women, complete with its own walls, guards, and administrators. Although Dara Rasami was undoubtedly the last political princess of her kind to serve here, she was hardly the first. The Inner Palace had a long history all its own that provides an intimate window into Siam’s political development over the course of the nineteenth century—the era of European imperialism.\n\nA Brief History of Political Consorts\n\nPolygyny had in fact been practiced by Southeast Asian monarchs long before the Ratanakosin (or Bangkok) era began, and it conveys the central importance of humanpower in the chronically underpopulated region.10 Like the monarchs of Lan Na discussed in the last chapter, Siamese kings also practiced polygyny throughout the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya eras. But in many ways, Bangkok itself was very new. After the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1767 reduced the Siamese capital to a smoldering ruin, Siam’s elite class, its literature and high culture were largely destroyed. In the years immediately following, General Taksin gathered the remaining Siamese nobility to establish a new seat at Thonburi. When the Chakri clan took the throne in 1782, they moved their capital across the Chao Phraya River, and a new palace was built on Ratanakosin Island, now considered the heart of “old” Bangkok. Siamese palace life, in other words, essentially restarted in the 1780s, when the Siamese built their new capital at Bangkok.\n\nThe newly established Chakri rulers were intensely concerned with both rebuilding their elite culture and preserving the security of their new capital. (As we discussed in the last chapter, these are the same security concerns that prompted the Siamese to assist Lan Na rulers in ousting the Burmese from their territories as well.) Regional security concerns shaped both the population of the Inner Palace and the fledgling Chakri dynasty’s external political practices in the early Bangkok era. Because the control of humanpower (or the lack thereof) had been a major factor in the loss of Ayutthaya, the Chakri nobility was anxious to consolidate political loyalties in the region. This they proceeded to do in a number of ways.11 First, the Chakri court centralized its administrative control over these new provincial administrators, creating separate chief ministers to oversee the provinces: the Mahat Thai minister supervising those in the north and the Kalahom supervising the southern provinces.12 Second, marital alliances were arranged with daughters of the noble families ruling provincial capitals around Siam’s peripheries. At the same time, however, Siam’s need for external territorial security was counterbalanced by an intimately internal one: that of rebuilding the elite class and the institution of the palace itself. These dual concerns shaped the ethnic makeup of the women who served as royal consorts in the early Bangkok era.\n\nFrom the inception of the new capital, the practice of marital alliance was central to the Chakri dynasty’s program of reestablishing ties with neighboring polities. The first Chakri monarch, Phra Phutta Yotfa (r. 1782–1809), had a total of seventeen consorts: four were the daughters of provincial rulers, and two more came from the prathet sarat of Lan Na and Lan Xang (now Laos). Another seven women were the daughters of various noble families based in Bangkok; one is described as the daughter of “wealthy Chinese,” while the origins of the last three were not recorded.13 In the wake of the destruction of the court at Ayutthaya, there were few women of royal blood available to serve as consorts during the early Bangkok era; the nearest available candidate was the granddaughter of an Ayutthayan consort. But what is most notable about the population of palace women in this period is the preponderance of women who came from beyond Bangkok: fully 35 percent of the women serving in the Inner Palace during this reign came from distant provincial or tributary regions. Rather than send male Siamese administrators out to govern the peripheries, women circulated from the peripheries into the center to ensure the loyalties of their home regions. These circulations highlight the centrality of bodies (or biopower, á la Foucault) to the traditional structure of Siamese political power, the inextricability of local elite women’s bodies to rebuilding the Siamese kingdom, and the necessity of anchoring it at its center, Bangkok.14\n\nAs the new dynasty found its footing, however, the makeup of the Inner Palace gradually shifted. During the reign of the second Chakri monarch, Phra Phutta Lertla (r. 1809–24), a total of three provincial women served among his eighteen royal consorts; the rest were daughters of Bangkok nobility.15 By the Third Reign (1824–51), the numbers skewed even further toward local nobles, with twenty-two women from local families versus four from the provinces among the total number of royal consorts.\n\nSiam’s relative political strength in the region initially benefited from the decline of their old enemy, Burma, following their loss to the British in the first Anglo-Burmese War in 1825.16 As Siam’s confidence grew in its regional security, the demographics of the Inner Palace shifted ever further to the center and away from the tributary kingdoms at the peripheries. During the Fourth Reign, King Mongkut’s (1851–68) Inner Palace population rose to a new high of fifty-three consorts. The ever-shrinking percentage of women from its peripheries present in the Inner Palace reflects Siam’s sense of regional security at this time. Only two women came from tributary kingdoms (Lan Na and Lan Xang/Laos); another came from Cambodia (which was still a tributary under Siamese control) and another from the Malay peninsula (the sultanate of Lingga). But the vast majority of royal consorts were local: the majority of women came from either the royal family itself or Bangkok’s noble families.\n\nKing Mongkut, who ascended the Siamese throne at the age of forty-seven, seemed eager to make up for the twenty-seven years he had spent as a Buddhist monk during his brother’s reign. Over the course of his seventeen-year reign (1851–68), he fathered sixty-five children by thirty-two consorts.17 Mongkut’s reign also saw the formation of a sizable pool of royal-born women from which consorts could come. Having reached a sort of critical mass in sheer numbers, this large cohort of consorts required further differentiation, so the palace began to utilize new ranks and titles for royal women.18 Mongkut’s three highest queens were the prior king’s daughters (i.e., Mongkut’s nieces); they became the mothers of the next king and his high queens as well.19 From the very start of Mongkut’s reign, the population of royal women in the Inner Palace surged exponentially over a relatively short period of time. Though the Fourth Reign still demonstrated a long geographical reach—counting consorts from Cambodia, Lao, and Malay kingdoms—the makeup of the Inner Palace in the 1840s and 1850s demonstrates that the locus of Siamese political power had shifted solidly to the center: the noble families of Bangkok.20 This trend continued during the next reign, that of King Mongkut’s son, Chulalongkorn.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn’s reign, like that of his English contemporary Queen Victoria, was a very long one. Compared to his father Mongkut, who reigned seventeen years, Chulalongkorn (Rama V) reigned forty-two years, from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn’s Inner Palace grew to 153 consorts, only three of whom—like Dara Rasami—came from peripheral, tributary kingdoms.21 Though the number of provincial consorts represented in the Siamese Royal Palace made up a mere 2 percent of its total population, the aggregate number is higher than at any time since the Third Reign (1825–51). This reflects changing regional context surrounding Siam in that period.\n\nWhile Siam’s political position in mainland Southeast Asia in the last quarter of the nineteenth century had become secure against its old enemies, a formidable new threat had crept into the picture: European imperialism. As the British moved into Burma to the west, and the French into Vietnam and Cambodia in the east, they slowly but surely undermined Siam’s tributary relationships while establishing outposts under European imperial control. As we will explore in this chapter, Dara Rasami’s presence in the Inner Palace provided Siam with its own buffer state—Lan Na—against British encroachment. At the same time, Chulalongkorn had begun reforming the Siamese state into a structure more recognizable to colonizers in a bid to keep them from subverting Siam’s sovereignty. This was an era when the traditional and modern coexisted and overlapped in the Siamese state at both the micro (palace) and macro (state) levels, as Dara Rasami’s role in the palace will reveal.\n\nSpace and Place in the Royal Palace\n\nInside the palace, Dara and her attendants were taken to a palace residence adjacent to the king’s own home, the ChakriMahaPrasat (great Chakri castle), located in the center of the palace grounds. The king had begun construction on this imposing structure in 1878, early in his reign, making his own mark on palace architecture as had the Chakri monarchs before him.22 While the building was largely complete by the time of Dara’s arrival in 1886, King Chulalongkorn continued to make changes and additions for several years afterward. The two-story, three-wing structure was designed in a hybrid Siamese-Western architectural style by John Clunis, a Briton who designed the British regent’s residence at Singapore.23\n\nThe Chakri Maha Prasat was not just the king’s residence: it was also where he conducted the business of state. The northward-facing lower levels included royal reception halls and functionary rooms, while the upper floors of the southward-facing rear wings housed the living quarters of the king and his closest family members. The Chakri Maha Prasat was a nexus between the Inner and Outer Palaces where both the public affairs and events of state occurred—such as meetings with foreign diplomats—as well as the private affairs of the king’s daily life.24 These spaces included the king’s bedchamber, the “Blue Room”; the “Green Room” where he dined with various wives and children; and the space where he held the daily Inner Palace review of consorts, called the “Yellow Room.”\n\nDara Rasami and her attendants were assigned a space in the Phra Thinang Damrong Sawat Hall, called the Hong Pakkard (Cabbage Room). This location reflects the high status and importance accorded her as Siam’s political link—both hostage and diplomat—to Lan Na. But it also served a very practical purpose. Dara Rasami’s physical closeness to the king was also meant to ensure the creation of a more lasting bond between the two kingdoms: a royal child. Since a royal consort remained free to leave palace service until she gave birth to a child by the king, it was a high priority for King Chulalongkorn to get Dara Rasami pregnant quickly, as it would prevent her from leaving the palace and cement the Siamese-Lan Na alliance for once and for all.25 Thus Dara’s close proximity to the king in the palace reflected both the symbolic recognition of her political status and the urgency of ensuring Lan Na’s loyalties in an era of imperialist anxiety.\n\nThe Chakri Maha Prasat bridged the Inner and Outer spaces of the Royal Palace. The Outer (or Front) Palace (the Wang Na) comprised the northernmost zone; just to the south was the Middle Palace (Wang Klang), where one could enter the Chakri Maha Prasat; and the southernmost zone contained the Inner Palace (Wang Nai). Encircled by yet another wall, the Wang Nai housed the royal women’s quarters, the residences of the fainai (inner group): the king’s female relatives, his children, his consorts and their entourages, and also their cooks, servants, officials, and guards—all female.\n\nWhile the palace grounds were walled off from the outside world, a second set of walls enclosed the Middle and Inner areas as well. This inner wall was punctuated by a series of gates that both opened to the outside and connected each zone to each other. Thus the Chakri Maha Prasat spanned the boundary between the Middle and Inner Palaces.\n\nThe Royal Palace in Bangkok functioned as far more than the residence of the Siamese king and his relatives: it was also the sacral, political, and social heart of the kingdom. As a dharma raja (righteous Buddhist king), Siam’s king exercised both political and spiritual authority over the state.26 The monarch anchored the center of the cosmologically ordered kingdom’s social and political universe from his residence in the Middle Palace.27 In the Siamese worldview, proximity was everything: the closer one was to the king physically and spatially, the higher one’s status—and conversely, the higher it could become. Thus the king’s own residence—the Chakri Maha Prasat—was an especially potent site, as the intersection of both his sacred and worldly activities. The sacredness of this center accrued to everyone associated with the place: even a slave inside the palace had social status higher than many free people outside its walls.\n\nThe Siamese monarch’s power was thought to radiate outward toward the peripheries of the kingdom, ever diminishing as it grew more distant from the center.28 This worldview made it critical for the Siamese king to build alliances with kingdoms at the peripheries—especially through marital alliances with women like Dara Rasami. In addition to the political function served by the Inner Palace, it played another important role in Siamese society: a crucible where high culture was reproduced and broadcast to the greater society at large. Because the daily lives of Inner Palace women were at the heart of this process, Dara Rasami’s experiences there provide a lens through which to view the workings of Inner Palace culture.\n\nA Consort’s Life in the Siamese Palace\n\nAlthough Dara had been educated in Siamese language and customs prior to entering the Siamese palace, she was still considered to be in training once she got there. As attendants under the patronage of Saovabha Phongsri, Chulalongkorn’s favorite queen, Dara and her ladies-in-waiting were required to serve as members of her entourage on a daily basis. Saovabha was one of three sisters who became King Chulalongkorn’s highest queens: Princess Sunanda Kumarirat (1860–80); Savang Vadhana (1862–1955); and Saovabha Phongsri (1864–1919).29 His fourth high queen was Sukhumala Marasri, a descendant of the politically important Bunnag family. In addition to being the highest-ranking consorts in the palace, these women were also spatially closest to the king: Saovabha occupied rooms inside the Chakri Maha Prasat, while the residences of the other three were adjacent—and even connected—to the royal residence on the interior side. They formed a mini-society of ultraelite women and children who circulated constantly between their own residences and the Chakri Maha Prasat, making up the rarefied social world that surrounded Dara Rasami and her foreign ladies-in-waiting.\n\nQueen Saovabha’s entourage included the daughters of several important noble families as well as the queen’s own children. As her attendants, Dara Rasami and her ladies spent several hours each day in the company of the high queen and her circle. The girls were expected to observe and practice elite Siamese manners and comportment; at the same time, their behavior was also constantly monitored by the other women there. It was neither an easy nor carefree environment for an adolescent girl from a foreign land, and the stakes were high—a fact of which Dara herself was highly aware.\n\nDara Rasami’s family had an interest in ensuring her good behavior as well. Dara’s father allegedly told Prince Damrong that if she should do anything wrong, Damrong should send word to Inthawichyanon, so he could “come down from Chiang Mai and give her a thump on the head.”30 To this Prince Damrong jokingly replied that he would be happy to spare Inthawichyanon the trouble and simply do it himself, since he would be, after all, Dara’s brother-in-law.31 Prince Damrong, who was a full decade younger than his half brother, the king, was much closer in age to Dara Rasami. Since his duties as head of the Mahat Thai (Ministry of the North) included territorial oversight of Lan Na, he met with Dara Rasami regularly to disburse the forestry-derived income (colloquially called stump money) provided by Chiang Mai. This regular interaction was the basis of a friendship that lasted throughout their lives.\n\nDuring the three years she served in Queen Saovabha’s entourage, Dara endured much teasing and humiliation from the other women there. Dara continued to wear her northernmuay hairstyle (long hair coiled and pinned up in a bun) andphasin skirts rather than Siamese-style chongkrabaen trousers. While her mode of dress was a statement of pride in her Lan Na identity, it also made her difference from her Siamese counterparts immediately recognizable—and also an easy target for gossip and practical jokes by other women, despite her status as Lan Na royalty. (Dara’s dress will be discussed in greater depth in the next chapter.)\n\nIn addition to taking great care with her own behavior, Dara Rasami also had to contend with the sometimes challenging behavior of other royal women. On one occasion, ChaoChom Sae, a former lady-in-waiting of one of the other high queens, teased young Dara Rasami that her “flat chest . . . wasn’t very pretty.” Dara Rasami’s response was one of stunned silence: she sat and smiled as if nothing had occurred, shocked and unable to respond.32 After all, what could she say to such a remark without risking offending a senior palace woman? Prince Damrong’s daughter Phunphitsamai, who was then serving as a lady-in-waiting in the palace, noted:\n\nIn the palace, [Dara Rasami] had no rank or authority, no importance at all; so she came by the name used for her by all the consorts: ChaoNoi (little noble). Chao Noi didn’t know anything; Chao Noi sat there, smiling happily to herself at nothing. Of all the consorts there, no one knew anything about her besides the words “Chao Noi.”33\n\nOutside the king’s residence, other palace women derisively called Dara and her entourage fish-paste stinkers, a reference to the distinctive Lan Na foodways they practiced in the palace. In private, Dara Rasami complained to her attendants that “these Bangkok ways would drive her back to Chiang Mai.”34 When Chulalongkorn learned of Dara Rasami’s travails, however, the king “warn[ed] the various chao chom and mom [royal mothers and concubines] to forbid their ladies [to tease her] . . . [and] put a stop to the persecution and various pranks, which could affect Dara Rasami’s feelings permanently.”35\n\nSuch intervention by the king may sound like unnecessary royal intervention in petty interpersonal conflicts within the palace. Yet it clearly reflects the intersection of personal and regional politics at play in the Inner Palace. Alienating Dara Rasami could ruin cordial relations with her father, King Intawichyanon, putting Siam’s relations with Lan Na at very real risk. The king thus considered it important to intercede on Dara Rasami’s behalf, as she was a critical political emissary of Lan Na whose political loyalties were considered precarious.\n\nOne particular episode that illustrates this precarity occurred in early 1889, when Dara was sixteen years old. That spring, British consuls in both Bangkok and Chiang Mai expressed anxiety over a possible alliance between Chiang Mai and the (Burmese) Shan city of Chiang Tung. At that time, the headmen of four Shan states (Maung Ta, Maingtun, Mainghan, and Maingsut) came to Chiang Mai to profess their loyalty to King Inthawichyanon. Since the question of ownership of Shan territory was not yet settled between the British and Siamese, such an alliance between Chiang Tung and Chiang Mai would likely upset the already delicate political balance between the kingdoms of the Inland Constellation. A marriage between a prince of Chiang Tung and a maiden of Chiang Mai could cement a relationship between the Shan and Lan Na kingdoms, at the expense of both Siamese and British interests in the region.\n\nAround that time, Dara Rasami received a letter from Intawichyanon discussing the Chiang Tung alliance and asking her to return home, possibly to take part in the arrangement. As palace law allowed a consort to leave the palace if she had not yet borne a royal child, such a move was possible, at least in theory. But what Intawichyanon did not know was that Dara Rasami had just become pregnant; thus his suggestion could be considered treasonous. Breaking palace law could have dire consequences. In 1886, one of the king’s half sisters was caught in an illicit affair with a former monk, who had disguised himself as a woman in order to enter her residence inside the palace. The lover was executed and the princess imprisoned in the palace jail, where she purportedly died within the year.36 This incident, which occurred the same year Dara Rasami arrived in the palace, was still fresh in palace minds.\n\nSixteen-year-old Dara Rasami faced a daunting situation: if she attempted to hide the letter, her life—and that of her unborn child—could be in danger. But to divulge the letter meant betraying her father. As her aunt Ubonwanna had died suddenly—allegedly by poisoning—not long after Dara left Chiang Mai in 1886, Dara had no other relative with whom she could discuss the issue.37 She faced a terrible choice that pitted her loyalties against each other. How could Dara Rasami choose? The story goes that:\n\n[When] Dara Rasami learned of this, she offered her father’s letter to King Chulalongkorn. . . . After that King Chulalongkorn proceeded with a clever policy, giving Dara Rasami a royal letter in answer to her father’s letter, which said that if the king of Chiang Mai would allow Chiang Mai to become part of England, then he should prepare himself to come collect Chao Dara Rasami’s body from Bangkok.38\n\nHowever close Dara Rasami was to the king and his inner circle, the fact remained that she was essentially a political hostage in the palace. Understandably, she feared the threat expressed in Chulalongkorn’s response to her father and worried that her life was in danger. The episode marked a dark time for her emotionally: “When she had sunk to the very lowest, [it was] enough to seek happiness just sitting down to listen to the sound of [her] own heart. . . . [Her] thoughts drifted down a dark path that she could not follow.”39\n\nNo doubt the threat was hollow, but it was intended to compel good behavior on the part of the Lan Na rulership without resorting to military force, as Siamese control over events in Chiang Mai was anything but direct. On the contrary: it could take anywhere from six to twelve weeks to traverse the 450-mile distance between the two capitals, depending on whether it was the dry or rainy season.40 With such a time lag in communications, the Siamese had no way of deploying military forces to Chiang Mai with any speed. Decades earlier, such looseness between Siam and its prathet sarat of Lan Na was a virtue, allowing the local ruler to respond to local needs in a more timely fashion than Bangkok could. But in the imperialist context, Lan Na could easily decide the British, recently (1885) advanced into Rangoon, would be a more beneficent ally, and betray Siam before they could intervene. Such Siamese fears find expression in the story about the secret letter and the acute contingency of Dara Rasami’s role within the Siamese palace.\n\nSpace and Status inside the Palace\n\nDara’s pregnancy greatly improved her fortunes in the palace. King Chulalongkorn gifted her space for a new residence big enough to house Dara, several more ladies-in-waiting, and any officials who might visit from Chiang Mai. The original house was located in the high-status zone adjacent to the Chakri Maha Prasat. However, because it was not quite large enough to accommodate the full complement of Dara’s entourage at the same time as visiting officials, Dara requested permission to add an additional floor to the building. Intawichyanon, still unhappy about Dara’s disclosure of his secret letter, nonetheless sent substantial funds to accomplish the renovation—and demonstrate Chiang Mai’s honor amid the Siamese royals. Thus both the location and size of Dara Rasami’s new house reflected her ongoing political importance to both kingdoms.\n\nDara’s new residence was located in the zone nearest the Chakri Maha Prasat, next to the homes of the high queens and the king’s eldest female relatives (including his sisters and former wet nurse). Although Dara Rasami’s residence was not as large as those granted to royal Siamese women, its location in the interior sector can be viewed as a gesture of goodwill from the Siamese to Lan Na. Alternatively, the architecture and materials used in the enlargement of Dara Rasami’s new house were a gesture from Lan Na to Siam, chosen to maximize the prestige of Lan Na’s royalty. The imposing three-story structure was built in the latest Italianate-cum-Siamese style, constructed of Western-style bricks and mortar, and filled nearly the entire tract. The house’s floor plan was a rectangle of bedrooms and corridors surrounding open, spacious interior parlors, topped with a roof-level garden. Wide shutters flanked its large windows on all three floors, with elaborate carved detail in their wooden frames. The exterior masonry was painted pale pink with green shutters and trim, a color scheme consistent with other Inner Palace residences at the time.41\n\nThe house’s size reflected both utility and status: the new residence was intended to house not only Dara Rasami and her entourage, but also any visiting officials from Chiang Mai (mainly Dara Rasami’s older half brothers).42 The residence’s imposing size and up-to-date architecture, as funded by Chiang Mai, can be seen as an architectural discourse proclaiming Lan Na’s continued strength as Siam’s most prominent prathet sarat and commanding acknowledgment by Siamese royalty. Though not exactly a discourse of resistance against the Siamese, the stature of Dara Rasami’s residence nonetheless makes clear the status Chiang Mai asserted for itself—and its princess—in Bangkok.\n\nMany other consorts were not so lucky. By this time in Chulalongkorn’s reign, the palace was chockablock with the housing needed to accommodate 153 consorts, their ladies-in-waiting, servants, cooks, workers, guards, and palace officials. The space was ordered largely by status: lower-ranking consorts and palace workers lived in progressively smaller homes located in the middle to outer regions of the Inner Palace. The farther a woman’s residence was located from the Chakri Maha Prasat at the palace’s center, the less royal blood likely ran in her veins—and the less space allotted to her living quarters. Adjacent to the center zone, the homes of the former queens and consorts of prior kings could measure up to 18.5 by 26.5 meters each; in the next zone lived the daughters and royal mothers of prior reigns in slightly smaller homes of 18 by 20 meters. The next outward zone housed consorts and important officials in long adjoining buildings of six units, each measuring 10 by 40 meters. The lowest ranking of all—servants and low-ranking officials—lived in the Tao Teng, conjoined two-story row houses that lined the eastern and southern peripheries of the Inner Palace. Each unit had an upstairs bedroom, with a small main room, kitchen, and bathroom on the ground floor below.43 The facing rows of the Tao Teng formed a corridor to the most frequently used gateways to the outside, which were flanked by fierce female guards (called klone) who kept an eye on palace comings and goings.\n\nDespite their seclusion, the women of the Inner Palace exercised great political, social, and cultural influence from within the double walls of the Royal Palace. Though Anna Leonowens viewed the place as a prison, and every woman there as a slave without agency, the Inner Palace was perceived quite differently by the average Siamese of the time: as an unparalleled opportunity for social and economic advancement in Siamese society.44 (In contrast to the freedoms enjoyed by noblewomen in Lan Na described in the previous chapter, however, it is important to note that these opportunities were ultimately circumscribed by the agency of a single man: the Siamese king.) Though the Inner Palace brought together women of all levels of Siamese society, from indentured slaves to noble-born ladies-in-waiting, the opportunities for social advancement were greatest for those of lower birth, as we shall discuss later on. Even the lowest palace servant enjoyed great prestige in Siamese society by virtue of her association with the royal center.45\n\nThe Inner Palace contained a carefully self-regulating bureaucracy, in which senior women—many of whom held official titles and duties—carefully monitored the behavior of junior women both in their own households and those of others. Their observations contributed to the king’s promotions of royal consorts on a semiannual basis. Such promotions carried economic rewards: each rank was associated with sakdina entitlements, which provided the holder with lifetime income.46 For chao chom and higher-born women, their promotions rested largely on their personal compatibility—and face-to-face contact—with the king himself.47 Accordingly, some of the highest positions in the Inner Palace bureaucracy were those with direct responsibility for the king’s person: the keepers of the royal wardrobe, and the director of the royal kitchens.48\n\nMost women presented to the Siamese king entered the Inner Palace at the rank of chaochom (royal consort), though some entered as servants or dancers, to be promoted to the rank of consort later on. Since families typically presented their daughters to serve in the Inner Palace early in their adolescence, girls were usually first sent to serve in the household of an elder consort or princess as a sort of apprentice in palace customs and manners. For the noble families of Siam, such palace training was the equivalent of a university education in an era before any such institution existed in Siam.49 Such elite education was not limited to the female children of noble families, however. While young girls—like Dara Rasami—were sent to begin their service in the household of a senior royal woman in the Inner Palace, boys went to serve in the Outer Palace as pages in the MahatLek, the Royal Pages Corps. The palace was where young Siamese elites were trained in the myriad royal customs and manners that distinguished the phudii (good people) from their social inferiors. Through the women of the minor nobility, fresh blood was infused into the royal ranks, and elite culture circulated back into Siamese society. As the young men and (especially) women serving in the Royal Palace moved from service within the palace to married life in elite households outside, they carried with them the manners, practices, customs and arts they had learned within the palace. The households of royal princes and other male nobility functioned as miniature satellites of the Siamese Royal Palace, where former palace women reproduced Siamese elite culture both literally through their offspring and figuratively through their exercise of elite customs and culture outside the palace.\n\nFor the daughters of nonelite families, being sent to serve in the palace—even if not as consorts—offered myriad opportunities to greatly improve their social status and marriage prospects.50 All newcomers to the Inner Palace were required to pass a series of tests to establish their proficiency in the use of polite language and manners. Following this initial training, palace women could take courses in traditional literary forms, from poetry and verse to composition.51 Those who demonstrated talent were encouraged to pursue further training, provided by the palace. Women were also trained in the arts of music and lakhon (Siamese dance-drama), and talented girls were assigned to the household of the lakhonfainai, where they could practice the demanding art form daily.52\n\nBesides excelling in the above arts, there were a number of other ways in which women of both common and noble birth could attain higher status—and indeed, build a career—within the context of the Inner Palace. However, the sole automatic means for a consort to improve her status was to give birth to a royal child, which elevated her title to that of chaochommanda (consort-mother). Within such a system and the context of the Inner Palace, what was the nature of a woman’s agency? How was her career trajectory constrained (or not) within the power structure of the Inner Palace?\n\nThe success of a woman’s palace career depended heavily on two factors: first, the woman’s socioeconomic background, and second, her personality and charisma. The first factor encompasses the issue of whether the woman was of royal, noble, or common birth. Whether of noble or common birth, the major issue was the political-economic importance of her family and its circle.53 For Dara Rasami, this factor was what guaranteed her position as a special status chao chom on her entry to the Inner Palace. The second factor, a woman’s personal level of charisma, comprised not merely her physical appearance, but also her social competence and skill in handling her relationships with both the other consorts within the Inner Palace and the king himself. It was this factor that most influenced the careers of the highest-ranking royal consorts, including Dara Rasami herself (as will be explored later in this chapter).\n\nFor royal-born women, rank depended first and foremost on their birth mother’s family and her social and political status. For Dara Rasami, her parents’ rank as the rulers of Chiang Mai accorded her special status on her entry to the palace, as she (and her attendants) were housed in the Damrong Prasat (or Hong Pakkard) palace residence. For women of nonroyal birth, there were two ways to enter palace service: they were either presented to the palace as a consort by their families, or they went to serve in the entourage of a woman who was already a consort or royal relative. Once inside the palace, a woman could earn additional promotions for good service in the duties assigned her. Thus the Inner Palace provided career opportunities for enterprising and charismatic women of both noble and common birth.\n\nIronically, for the highest-born women, opportunities for social movement were also the most restricted. Though royal rank declined over generations, allowing royal granddaughters to marry outside the Inner Palace, the king’s daughters, sisters, and half sisters ranked too highly to do so. In a sense, the value of their social currency was too high: without high-status male counterparts besides their own brothers, they were effectively priced out of the marriage market.54 While many of their royal brothers became high ministers in charge of running the kingdom, the highest-born royal women were restricted to life within the walls of the Inner Palace from birth to death. This restriction on royal women’s circulation outside the palace conversely contributed to the popular notion of “the Inside” as a rarefied social space belonging to the most elite in the land.\n\nMotherhood and Daily Life in the Inner Palace\n\nOn October 2, 1889, Dara Rasami gave birth to a daughter, Wimon Nakhonna Phisi: her first (and only) child by King Chulalongkorn. Though Queen Saovabha herself had had a baby herself just three months earlier, she “came to stay [in the birthing room with Dara Rasami] to provide moral support the whole time.”55 Queen Saovabha was sympathetic, especially as she and her sister, Queen Savang Vadhana, had suffered numerous miscarriages, stillbirths, and losses of infant children in epidemics that periodically swept through the overcrowded space.56 These frequent and agonizing losses piqued Saovabha’s interest in new medical interventions from the West that promised relief. In an effort to improve medical knowledge of childbirth early in the twentieth century, she even attempted to send several young Siamese women to England to be trained in the latest Western midwifery techniques.57 Thus births from which both mother and child emerged unscathed were something to celebrate in the palace. It was also customary to mark the occasion of a baby’s survival of its first thirty days with a special ceremony. As part of the first-month celebration for Dara’s new daughter, Queen Saovabha sponsored a special performance of the Lan Na-influenced dance-drama LilitPhra Law in the Inner Palace.58\n\nDara’s rank automatically went up a notch after she gave birth: from chao chom (consort) to chao chom manda (consort-mother). This rank was shared by a number of other royal consort-mothers, but for many women, even that level was out of reach. Of the 153 consorts resident in the palace in that era, only thirty-six had children with the king; some women, gifted to the palace to serve their family’s political ambitions, were accepted out of politeness and rarely seen in the king’s presence. For these women, their best chance for face-to-face contact with the king was to attend the king’s daily audience in the Yellow Room of the Chakri Maha Prasat—hence they were nicknamed the ladies of the Yellow Room. Further ascending the promotion ladder in the palace depended primarily on the individual woman’s family of origin and her service within the palace. The king and his inner circle of Inner Palace officials assessed promotions on an annual basis, using reports from royal women of the highest rank, who vigilantly surveilled the activities of the queens, concubines, and the women of their entourages.\n\nThe arrival of her daughter brought Dara Rasami both a new title and a new home, where she could surround herself with a proper entourage of Lan Na ladies-in-waiting to attend her. By all accounts, Dara was a devoted mother, and her daughter was immersed in every comfort Lan Na’s royal family could afford. Her ladies described the little girl’s coming as sadetChaoNoi, or arrival of the Little Noble (borrowing her mother’s palace nickname). In photographs of Wimon Nakhonna Phisi, she wears copious jewelry, a Lan Na-style phasin skirt, and a lacy Victorian blouse (like her mother)—but her hair is pulled into a topknot like other Siamese royal children, signaling Dara’s accommodation of Siamese custom, versus Lan Na style.59\n\nAfter a somewhat rough start to her life in the palace, Dara Rasami put her training and talents to work in forging relationships with various palace folk. Her “excellent temperament and [beauty]” made her “a ‘pet’ or favorite of the royal family. Many sons and daughters of Rama IV and Rama V who were respected officials throughout the palace, became close to her. She came to be loved by all those near her—royal consort-mothers and consorts alike—even those few who had bad aims towards her. With those royals, she could be impassive, giving no reaction or answer of any kind. . . . She changed the anger of those that thought harmfully in that way, until at last those individuals were close companions.”60\n\nDara made several important friends among the fai nai, including Queen Savang Vadhana, Chao Chom Manda Hem, and Chao Chom Manda Mote; several of the Bunnag sisters, Ieyem, Ohn, and Erb; and fellow Chiang Mai native Chao Chom Manda Thipkesorn. Hem’s daughter noted that her mother often went to play cards with Dara at her residence, where they smoked cheroots and made merry until late at night; when the king built a new palace in the Dusit district, their residences were built next door to each other.61 Though Dara Rasami was known for her love of cards, she was not a reckless gambler and did not get into trouble with gambling debts (as other palace women and her relatives sometimes did). Prince Damrong (who administered the timber money sent from Chiang Mai to Dara’s household) even commented favorably to his daughters on Dara Rasami’s wisdom in handling money, and his daughters noted Dara’s generous gifts at their tonsure ceremonies.62 A royal consort of any rank did well to find whatever friends she could in the Inner Palace, as she was very rarely allowed to leave the palace, except by special permission, and never on her own.\n\nIn the daily life of Siam’s palace women, as for commoners outside, the tropical climate necessitated a constant effort to keep their bodies clean, scented, and dressed. In an era before the advent of indoor plumbing and the convenience of running water, one might well wonder how the women of the Inner Palace dealt with the body’s natural functions and personal hygiene. There were a number of ponds and fountains in the Inner Palace grounds that palace women could use for relief from the tropical heat and humidity.63 Their water came from a fresh water pipeline running under the palace from just below Wat Phra Sri Rattana Sudaram (the Temple of the Emerald Buddha) and southwest through the Inner Palace, supplying its gardens and fountains.64 Besides this, there was also the bathing pool known as Lady Orathai’s Pond, which was located south of the Tao Teng rowhouses. Here Inner Palace women obtained potable water, drawing it into vessels and transporting it to their mistresses’ households for their cooking and bathing needs.65\n\nHuman waste was dealt with by two main methods; which one depended on a woman’s status level. If a woman was a Mom Chao (royal relative), palace official, or consort of chao chom (or higher) status, she could use a chamber pot within the comfort of her household; if a woman was a lady-in-waiting or servant, she had to use the public toilets. These facilities were located between the Tao Teng (administrators’ row houses) and the outer wall, as they drained outside the palace grounds. Housed in a long, low brick building colloquially known as the umong (cave), the site also functioned as an important meeting place for Inner Palace women:\n\nIn the past, the area near the entry to the cave was a place where women of all ages and generations met together. It was also the site of debts, quarrels, reversals, or “understandings.” There was much moneylending and “tools for gathering high fruit,” or selling businesses. For example, getting prices for clothing; selling small trifles, like cosmetics, soap, needles, combs, and handicrafts and sweets that the palace folk made themselves, like fried lotus seeds, cookies, rice noodles, etc.66\n\nAs a site which probably experienced the greatest circulation of bodies within the Inner Palace, one can imagine that the umong was a lively point of exchange for news and rumors from both inside and outside the palace.67\n\nWithin a noblewoman’s household, her toilette was attended to by her ladies-in-waiting and servants, who assisted her in bathing, dressing, and emptying her chamber pot. A custom peculiar to the Siamese palace was dressing in the color(s) of the day. This system, still observed informally by some Thais, assigns a different color to each day of the week based on astrological associations between each day and a different ruling planet or deity. As former palace resident Kukrit Pramoj explains, each day had both a dominant overall color and complementary ones that functioned as accents:\n\nfor Monday—the yellow phalai with the light blue top or the pigeon blue phalai with the top in champa red. For Tuesday, this lime pink or this maprang-pit purple, topped by sok-leaf green, you see? Or, if you prefer a green phalai, then your top should be in pale purple. . . . Both bean color and iron color are correct for your Wednesday phalai, to be worn with champa orange. And for Thursday, green phalai with bird’s-blood red, or orange phalai topped by pale green. For Friday it’s dark blue with yellow on top, and for Saturday the phalai in maprang-pit purple with the cloth in sok-leaf green. Dark purple is also acceptable for Saturday—lovely shade, isn’t it?—and oh so hard to find. . . . For Sunday, you may dress as on Thursday if you wish or you may choose a lichee red or a pig’s-blood red phalai, with the top in sok-leaf green. . . . You must learn these combinations and not dress like a clumsy peasant.68\n\nAdherence to this convention required women to have several changes of clothing, plus different-colored accessories and accoutrements to complement each outfit. During Chulalongkorn’s reign—which coincided with the high Victorian era, when European fashions were popular among the royal women—many consorts incorporated Western elements into their dress as well. (This will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.) The highest-ranking consorts also adorned themselves with strings of pearls and jewelry gifted to them by the king. Given this combination of practices and conventions, the sheer visuality of women’s dress in the Inner Palace on any given day must have been dazzling. Compared to the average single set of clothes owned by most commoners, palace dress represented a level of luxury unreachable by all but the wealthiest in Siamese society at the time.\n\nOutside the eastern palace walls lay a plethora of shops and fresh markets where palace servants could find the supplies needed to feed and clothe their households: “The area near this gate swelled with young women who came to sell merchandise, necessities, utensils, clothes, finery/silks, and various other items.”69 Books and periodicals could also be obtained there; Dara even employed a reader to pore through historical texts and current publications to keep her up to date, as Dara was known for her keen interest in politics.70 The markets were also a source for domesticated animals—cats, dogs, birds, fish, and turtles—which many palace women also kept as pets in their households. One observer noted that “some people liked to keep cats, as they were small and liked to sleep; they let them eat from silver dishes and crystal bowls, as it if were quite ordinary.”71 Dara’s household was no exception: two small pugs appear in several photographs of Dara and her entourage.\n\nThe palace market was also a place where go-betweens brought eligible young men to identify possible marriage partners from among the ladies-in-waiting who otherwise were rarely visible outside the palace.72 It must have been a lively scene, with consorts’ cooks and maidservants constantly running in and out of the palace on errands for their employers, and commercial vendors coming and going to sell their wares to the women’s households within.\n\nLife within the double walls of the Inner Palace bustled with activity from dawn to dusk. Considering the women of the palace were frequently referred to as thenanghaam, or forbidden wives, the boundaries of the Inner Palace were in reality remarkably porous. Each morning before dawn, monks from the nearby royal temple would make the rounds of the Inside with their begging bowls; commercial vendors and construction workers could enter and exit the Inner Palace with permission, and even commoners could also enter the Inner Palace on special business. In the afternoons, Queen Saovabha herself held audiences on the steps behind the Chakri Maha Prasat, where she would entertain commoners’ entreaties:\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, about 5pm, Somdet would come out to receive guests on the last step herself. If it was a regular village person, they would be directed down the steps. But the steps of the palace were very wide, made with beautiful black and white stone. Some guests said they would rather sit along the lower circle level.73\n\nTraders selling gems, silks, and other finery also periodically made the rounds of the women’s residences. Consorts themselves also frequently engaged in small business within the palace, selling handicrafts, sweets, and other treats from their residences to supplement their official stipends.74 Dara’s household participated in this informal marketplace, selling betel-chewing supplies and other dry goods from a cabinet in the rear of her residence.75 She found a receptive audience among palace women for the exotic Lan Na-style snacks called mieng: fermented tea leaves wrapped around savory fillings of herbs, chilies, lime, dried shrimp, and peanuts (which can still be found on the menus of many Bangkok restaurants today). As Kukrit tells us, “Chao Dara Rasami’s residence . . . was the only one that always handed out tidbits wrapped in leaves.”76 Perhaps these unique snacks brought new friends into Dara’s circle, in addition to contributing to her already substantial household income.\n\nCirculation and Status in the Inner Palace\n\nAs the potential mothers of Siam’s future monarchs, consorts’ bodies were not to circulate freely: their sexual circulation had to be restricted exclusively to the domain of the king. The high value of their social currency translated into limits on their physical circulation. During the Ayutthaya era (1350–1766), Siamese royal women had also been sequestered77; elite women were restricted to the Inner Palace in the Ratanakosin era (1782–present) as well. The sequestration of elite women became socially coded in Siamese society, with the near invisibility of high-ranking palace women synonymous with their eliteness. Considering the perpetual shortage of humanpower common to mainland Southeast Asia, and the grinding difficulty of the daily lives of many Siamese women laboring in fields and marketplaces, such limited circulation must have seemed a luxurious state to which most people could only aspire. Additionally, any consideration of the social value of the Inside should not ignore the immense spiritual bonus accorded to those living in such close proximity to the sacred person of the dharma raja, the king himself.\n\nIt follows that those who enjoyed the highest status in the Inner Palace were not allowed to circulate as freely as those of lesser status. Of the fai nai (inner group), those who had the greatest freedom of physical movement between the Inner Palace and the outside world were actually the lowest-ranking members of the royal households: guards, servants, cooks, and go-betweens. These women would have been free to enter and exit the palace gates as necessary to complete their assigned errands, giving them the greatest physical freedom of any of the women living within the palace. Some servant women and officials—excluded from being selected as consorts—even had husbands and families outside the palace, elsewhere in the city.\n\nIndeed, for the highest-status royal consorts and queens, the very fact of their invisibility (and corresponding inaccessibility) to the outside world was a mark of their royal rank. Inner Palace women were limited to movement between the Inner and Middle Palaces, or, if outside the palace, mainly to various nearby temples for important ceremonies or seasonal sermons.78 On these occasions, palace women entered temple grounds on walkways lined with screens or curtains, and their seating area was partitioned off to hide them from the gaze of the populace—and vice versa. A consort’s movement outside the palace could only be achieved by royal permission and in the company of an official chaperone; even then she would also be accompanied by her customary entourage. Thus an elite woman was highly unlikely to travel anywhere alone. Even to see relatives visiting Bangkok, a royal consort had to obtain permission to exit the palace, and she could host visits from only her immediate family members inside her palace residence.79 In addition to regulating consorts’ behavior in their external circulations, their internal, emotional orientations were policed as well—via oaths of loyalty.\n\nOath-taking and Policing Women’s Bodies\n\nOn entering palace service, Dara Rasami—like any other nonroyal-born woman—took an oath of loyalty to the king during the ceremonies marking her entry into palace life. The chao chom’s oath, which was sworn to the person of the king himself, pledged the consort’s sexual fidelity to the king to the exclusion of all others, both male and female. The oath also entailed that the consort would not tolerate the advances of other men, would not act as an accomplice to other consorts in infidelity, and would not engage in any other acts considered disloyal. These included stealing from or assaulting other consorts and “associating with fortune tellers and practitioners of magic love charms.”80 Additionally, the oath was sworn before “supernatural powers… invited to torture the oath-taker in a variety of painful and long-term ways before causing death if the chao chom betrays her oath.”81\n\nIn premodern Siam, oaths were a common practice by which individuals, both male and female, had pledged their fealty to Siamese monarchs since the Sukhothai period.82 The consort’s oath can be seen as a parallel to the oaths of allegiance taken twice a year by male officials serving in the provincial administrative roles.83 Male Siamese officials, like the rulers of Siam’s prathet sarat (tributary kingdoms), took a water-drinking oath, in which the blessed water was thought to turn to poison in the oath taker’s body if he later acted disloyally. The chao chom’s oath functioned similarly: as magical language that, if contravened, would bring physical consequences directly on the consort by supernatural means. In both forms of Siamese oath taking, the oath functioned not as a mere verbal warning to remind the oath taker, but more like a vaccination that carried the potential for physical effects in the oath taker’s own body should they act disloyally. Siamese oath taking centered the body as the foundation of governance.\n\nThe chao chom’s oath functioned through both the self-regulation of her own behavior and the informal surveillance of other women’s actions within the Inner Palace. Besides the transgressions listed above, several more offenses were officially proscribed during Chulalongkorn’s reign. Issued in 1875, the edict reads as follows:\n\nAll chao chom living here . . . must behave according to the points of the royal decree as follows:\n\n1)It is forbidden for chao chom living here to drink except alone, or associate together. . . . Carousing [is] the worst on ya dong (fermented medicine; medicinal spirits). If one takes ya dong, it is specifically for one’s own health alone. If one induces one or more of one’s friends to take it, that is absolutely forbidden.\n\n2) (royal granddaughters), official workers who live both inside and outside the palace, wives of officials, and bad women in the palace to be “love friends,” or “husbands who are women,” and gamble together as if gold and silver were only words.\n\n3)nang (palace matron) with a bow; if they give their permission the [lady] may go to stay.\n\n4)If a person comes to stay in [a lady’s] house, [only] parents or direct siblings may come to stay in the home of their relative, and do not need to report to the [palace matron]. But they must take care not to allow other situations; if there are too many other issues, they must report their mistake to the palace official.\n\n5)They must have respect, fear and pay attention to the directions of the Palace Matron, high nobles, and chao chom with higher status, according to their rank. As to these orders, chao chom who do not obey them, whether they defy one or more, will receive royal penalties to be weighed out according to the crime.\n\n~ Declared on day 3-12/10 night 12 of J. S. [Minor Era] year 1237 (1875–76).84\n\nThis edict highlights for us a number of issues among the women of the Inner Palace: drug use, lesbianism, and gambling among them. Of these problems, Dara Rasami’s household encountered at least two over the course of her career in the palace. The first issue was the recreational use of medicinal drugs, which Dara appears to have faced when she was still a lady-in-waiting in the queen’s household. According to Chiang Mai historical sources, Dara Rasami complained privately to her attendants that “the royal women who ate jimsonweed [i.e., took hallucinogens] were crazy, and would drive her back to Chiang Mai yet.”85 As medical care was readily available to the women of the Inner Palace, such drugs were not hard to come by. That the king felt the need to prohibit these drugs strongly suggests that some consorts and royal women of the Inner Palace remained unfulfilled by their palace lifestyle, however rarefied or luxurious it may have appeared to those outside its walls.\n\nAnother issue addressed by Chulalongkorn’s edict was the phenomenon of lenphuan (literally “playing friends”), a popular pastime of late nineteenth-century palace women that involved intense girl-to-girl friendships and crushes. It touched Dara Rasami’s household directly in 1906, when an affair was discovered between one of Dara’s ladies-in-waiting, Lady Yuang Kaew Sirorote, and Mom Rachawong (Siamese royal granddaughter) Wongthep. The affair might have gone unnoticed if not for Wongthep’s jealous former lover, NangSao (Miss) Hoon. (See figure 3, in which both women appear.) It was Miss Hoon who spread the news that Yuang Kaew had regifted a gemstone ring to Wongthep—a ring which Dara Rasami had originally given to her. On learning this news, Dara Rasami became enraged, scolding Yuang Kaew harshly and making her repeat every criticism heaped on her. Knowing that she was about to be expelled from Dara Rasami’s entourage and sent home in shame to her family in Chiang Mai, Yuang Kaew committed suicide.86\n\nIt remains unclear which of Yuang Kaew’s actions was considered worse: engaging in len phuan with another palace woman, or passing along an item bestowed on her by her patroness. Though her affair—with a royal granddaughter, no less—does not appear to have called Dara Rasami’s loyalties into question, Yuang Kaew’s bestowal of such a precious item to Wongthep betrayed a high level of emotional involvement, which constituted an inappropriate diversion of her loyalties away from her patroness’s household. In any event, the consequences were serious for Yuang Kaew and her family, who bore a heavy burden of shame as a consequence of her transgressions. Whether any punishment was meted out to Mom Rachawong Wongthep as a consequence of the affair is never mentioned in these sources.\n\nThe above case is an example of some of the petty crimes and misdemeanors within the Inner Palace. Most likely such cases only rarely reached the ears of the king himself, nor were they often formally recorded in palace records. Such transgressions were punished by the chao chom themselves within their own entourages, without recourse to formal proceedings.87 However, things were different for women of royal birth. Though they were not bound by the semiannual loyalty oaths taken by nonroyal chao chom, royal women faced a different set of punishments for their crimes in the Inner Palace.\n\nTransgressions of the royal space of the Inside were governed not only by palatine law, but also by a royal council who reviewed each offense on a case-by-case basis, ultimately deferring to the king himself. Though a royal woman could not be placed in irons like any commoner, royal punishments could range “from probation down to reduction of the annual stipend. In cases considered especially egregious, there might be a confiscation of one’s royal order and one’s property, decorations, and punishment of ‘dit sanom.’”88 Dit sanom was similar to house arrest, in which a royal woman would be essentially confined to her residence; in addition, her participation in royal ceremonies was permitted, but only if she was led in golden irons behind the rest of the royal procession, subjecting her to significant shame and loss of status.89 Nonetheless, it was rare for a royal woman to suffer the loss of her annual stipend or residence. Only in extreme cases, such as sexual transgressions of palace law, were palace women ever jailed. Though it is difficult to find mention of actual punishments in the Siamese records, American missionary Mary Cort noted the nature of one consort’s punishment in 1886:\n\nThe latest instance of flirting [in the palace] resulted in the disgrace of both [parties]; the flogging of the young nobleman, and banishment from the capital; while the lady who dared be faithless . . ., was condemned to wear chains and cut grass for the royal elephants all the rest of her life.90\n\nMale Bodies’ Circulation in the Inner Palace\n\nThis brings us to the question of how males navigated the space of the Inner Palace. Though readers of Leonowens’s books might be left with the impression that no man besides the king of Siam himself was allowed into the Inner Palace, men did indeed circulate there, although their movements were closely regulated. A Western observer noted, “Men on special work of construction or repair were admitted, and the doctors when they came to visit the sick.”91 Consorts’ male relatives could also enter the Inner Palace and stay in their daughters’ residences. However, no man could enter the Inner Palace unmonitored, or move around unsupervised. Female palace guards, called klone, were assigned “to accompany all men who were admitted and to remain with them until they left.”92 Even boys born and raised inside the palace had to leave once they reached puberty.93 For male officials and royal pages visiting the Inner Palace, there was a host of rules designed to preclude casual contact with the women of the Inside. According to the official rules of the Mahat Lek, or Royal Pages Corps:\n\nDo not allow Mahat Lek to part the curtains to look into the Inner Palace. They are to seek out and speak to only the one person. . . .\n\nWhen a page has received something from the Inside, or needs to send something into the Inside, he must call a go-between. It is forbidden to go raise or part the blinds or curtains that would allow them to look inside, and to speak/converse with those of the Inner Palace is forbidden. . . .\n\nIn fact, the Page’s government duty is to enter into the Inner Palace at one time or another. [He should] exercise great caution and care in his deportment, i.e., he should come and go directly, not drop by to chat with one person or another. Those so charged should speak with only who is there, the matron, and see her only. Therefore, [the page] should speak only about government business. It is forbidden to have conversations, or make speeches, or associate with [those within], and when you enter the Inner Palace, you must tell them that you have an audience Inside. It is forbidden for you to enter, and going alone is especially forbidden.94\n\nAnother male population allowed to enter the Inner Palace was that of royal monks. Since the highest-status royal women did not circulate regularly outside the palace walls, they were precluded from earning Buddhist merit by giving food to monks making their daily rounds of the local community, which was (and still is) a common daily practice of Siamese women. To restore this important merit-making opportunity to the women of the fai nai, a group of monks were allowed to visit the Inner Palace daily, walking a limited route through the women’s residences to collect daily alms.95 As we saw in the aforementioned episode of the royal woman whose affair with a monk was discovered, the loneliness of some royal women was such that even the briefest contact could spark romance. Nonetheless, serious consequences awaited transgressors when the boundaries of palace law were crossed—a fact that was not lost on Dara Rasami herself, whose role encompassed that of both Lan Na diplomat and hostage.\n\nIllness and Medical Treatment in the Inner Palace\n\nIn the close quarters of the overbuilt Inner Palace toward the end of the nineteenth century, illness was an increasingly regular occurrence among the women and children there—including Dara Rasami herself. (This was ultimately part of what motivated Chulalongkorn to build the new palace grounds in the Dusit district at the turn of the century, which will be discussed in the next chapter.) Siam’s palace women had access to a remarkable level of medical care in this era. Though Western medicine had come to Siam with Christian missionaries in the 1830s, the hospital was still a novel idea in late nineteenth-century Siam. For women within the palace, traditional Siamese medicine was usually their first option, but it was often augmented with Western medicine if the first course of treatment was unsuccessful. Archival records demonstrate that (unlike most other aspects of daily life within the palace) a consort’s medical care was tracked meticulously, while her intake of food, water, and medicine and any changes to her physical condition were carefully monitored throughout the day. In special cases, a consort could request to be sent elsewhere to recuperate; the palace upriver at Bang Pa-In and the coastal retreat of Ang Sila (southeast of Bangkok) were frequent requests. Dara Rasami herself suffered from occasional respiratory ailments, no doubt exacerbated by her custom of smoking cheroots. In 1906, she requested a visit to Ang Sila to recuperate, the reasoning being that she would benefit from the cleaner air there.96\n\nMore records are available for Dara Rasami’s Chiang Mai compatriot Chao Chom Manda Thipkesorn, who also suffered from illness from late 1901 to early 1903. Official notes indicate that when Siamese doctors proved unable to cure her in late 1902, a Western doctor was brought in to take over her care. Perhaps sensing the fatal trajectory of her condition, Thipkesorn requested to be sent north to see her family in Phitsanulok, but due to unrest in the area at the time, her request was denied.97 Instead, the palace administrators suggested she go to Bang Pa-In to recover. However, her condition declined rapidly, and not long after she was declared “hopeless,” she died on January 26, 1903.98\n\nCoping with Illness and Loss in the Palace\n\nDara’s own happiness as a young mother was short lived. Following a short (unexplained) illness, her daughter died suddenly on February 21, 1892, at the age of only two and a half years. Dara was reportedly distraught with grief and had her ladies destroy all images of Wimon Nakhonna Phisi that could continue to remind Dara of her. She even asked King Chulalongkorn to allow her to go back to Chiang Mai to live as she had before (though the king put her off, saying it would be decided later).99\n\nWhen the news of his grandchild’s death reached Intawichyanon in Chiang Mai, he wrote a long and touching letter to Dara. In this letter he expressed sadness and compassion for her loss, and shared his own experience of having lost one of his own children (Dara’s older sister, Jantrasopha). He urged her to find the strength to carry on:\n\n[Your] father [has wanted to] speak to you from the heart since you were fourteen and went into service in the royal palace. The body of the child might be gone, but a father’s heart is always focused on life with his child. Your father misses his child with every breath. . . . Please do not fall apart, even a little. Please try to strengthen yourself, a thousand times over. This I wish a million times over. . . .100\n\nThough her daughter’s death darkened the following months and years for Dara Rasami, she eventually found the will to carry on out of a sense of “duty… over love.”101\n\nYet Dara’s daughter was never promoted to the same royal rank as her Siamese half brothers and sisters, despite the fact that her mother descended from the Lan Na royal family. Wimon Nakhonna Phisi received the title phrachaoluktherphraongchao at birth, a rank she shared with several of the king’s children by noble consorts—but notably not the rank of chao fa, which was only accorded to the children of the high queens. Even though Dara Rasami nominally held the same status as a Siamese royal woman, her child was not awarded the same birth rank as those of the king’s half sisters. However, the rank could have been granted at the king’s discretion. After the little girl’s premature death, Chulalongkorn expressed his regret for not having promoted her. In a letter to Prince Damrong, he wrote, “I made a mistake. She should have been a chao fa, but I forgot until she was already gone.”102\n\nWhat should we make of this “mistake”? It is perhaps understandable that the promotion in rank of this one daughter could get lost in the shuffle of the larger issues that Siam was dealing with at the moment. The year 1892 witnessed a vast reorganization of the Siamese government’s internal administrative structure, as well as Siam’s surrender of five contested Lan Na/Shan provinces to the British. Additionally, there was growing concern about the French activities in both Cambodia and the Lao territories, which culminated in the Paknam Crisis the following year.103 However, while such promotions were at the king’s discretion, they could still be given posthumously (Chulalongkorn had, for example, promoted his young queen Sunanta Kumarirat after her accidental death by drowning in 1880).104 The most likely explanation is that since Dara Rasami remained at the rank of a mere chao chom manda, such a promotion was not considered warranted. Only once Dara Rasami was promoted to the rank of high queen (phra rachaya)—a scant year before Chulalongkorn’s death—did his successors find it appropriate to upgrade Dara Rasami’s deceased daughter’s status. Thus Chulalongkorn’s mistake was remedied by subsequent kings Rama VI (Vajiravudh) and Rama VII (Prajadhiphok), both of whom elevated Dara’s daughter, Wimon Nakhonna Phisi, to a higher rank during their reigns.105\n\nNonetheless, Dara Rasami managed to find other outlets for her maternal instincts. When her cousin—her aunt Ubonwanna’s daughter—died suddenly at age twenty-eight, Dara Rasami took in her two young children, Kawilowong and Renuwanna, with Chulalongkorn’s blessing.106 Dara also took in another great-niece, Laddakham Chotamra, her half brother Intawarorot’s granddaughter. When Laddakham and Kawilowong reached adolescence, Dara sent them to school in Europe (sources disagree as to whether they went to Paris or London). While King Chulalongkorn sponsored Kawilowong’s European education (as he did for all his princely sons), Dara paid for Laddakham’s schooling herself.107 This pattern continued, with Dara adopting children from her extended family even in her retirement and later life in Chiang Mai. In palace portraits of Dara and her entourage taken at her Bang Pa-In residence sometime in the 1890s, we can identify five children (three girls, two boys) under the age of ten (see figure 3). When Laddakham’s father later asked her to return to live with her family, Dara made Laddakham promise that she would someday send her own daughter to live with Dara Rasami. Laddakham, who married a Siamese nobleman, kept her promise to Dara, sending her eldest daughter Chatrsudha (née Chatrchai), to live in Dara Rasami’s Chiang Mai household in the late 1920s.108 Despite the fact that her only child by the king did not survive infancy, Dara Rasami created other opportunities for mothering and caring for children until the end of her life.\n\nWhat happened when a royal woman (or child) died in the Inner Palace? Typically, family members were summoned to ritually bathe the body of the deceased before it was folded up into the fetal position and sealed in a large earthenware jar. The jar was then kept in a temple for a year, after which the remains were cremated. A ceremony was held for mourners and friends to mark the passing before the body was taken from the palace, and another ceremony was held at the time of cremation. Because the rate of infant mortality in the palace was so high, a single cremation ceremony could be held for several children at a time. For most women of nonroyal birth, their remains were sent home to their family, who handled their cremation and interment.\n\nSiamese royal customs and cosmology dictated that corpses could only be removed from the palace through the gate in the appropriate direction: westward through the Prahom Sri Sawat gate. The bodies of nonroyal women were returned to their families, who cremated them in their hometowns (for example, the remains of women of the Bunnag family are interred in Petchaburi, the Bunnag family’s longtime provincial home). For some royal women, another new practice originated during the Fifth Reign: interment of their ashes in the royal women’s mausoleum next to Wat Rajabophit.109 This cemetery was created specifically by King Chulalongkorn for the remains of royal women and high consorts following the death of Queen Sunanta Kumarirat in 1880. As Sunanta was herself a royal princess, and there was no existing location within the palace that could accommodate the remains of (so many) royal women, the king built a women’s cemetery. Queen Saovabha’s ashes are interred there, as are those of a number of other high-status consorts. Dara Rasami also has a funerary monument there, which contains the ashes of her and her daughter.110 One can still visit this cemetery today, which contains nearly two dozen monuments housing the remains of various royal women and their children.\n\nEthnic Difference in the Palace\n\nDara Rasami had been groomed from early in her childhood for her life in Siam’s Royal Palace. She was educated in Siamese language and customs prior to leaving her homeland to become a royal consort in Bangkok in 1886, and had even undergone the Siamese tonsure ceremony at puberty, though this custom was not ordinarily practiced in Lan Na. Despite these efforts to adapt, life for her within the Siamese Inner Palace was hardly easy. As a cultural outsider, Dara faced differential treatment by her Siamese contemporaries, ranging from subtle snubs to open hostility. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Dara herself was teased and taunted while still a young girl serving in Queen Saovabha’s entourage. Even after her daughter was born and Dara moved into her own impressive residence, she disliked leaving it because she so keenly felt the disdain of other Siamese consorts.\n\nBut was she unique in this unpleasant experience of feeling like an outsider among her Siamese counterparts? Were there any other consorts who brought a similar level of cultural difference into the palace during the same era? A good test case for comparison is the aforementioned Chao Chom Manda Thipkesorn, who had served in the Inner Palace for three years before Dara Rasami’s arrival and borne the king a son.111 How did the experiences of these two foreign consorts compare? This comparison will demonstrate how a woman’s political stature and personal relationship with the king affected her career trajectory.\n\nChao Chom Manda Thipkesorn (not to be confused with Dara Rasami’s mother, Thipkraisorn) came from a less prominent branch of the Lan Na royal family, providing the Siamese with yet another northern woman among the ranks of the Inner Palace consorts, additionally reflecting the political importance of Lan Na at the time.112 Lady Thipkesorn took a very different path into the Inner Palace than Dara Rasami. Thipkesorn started out as a lady-in-waiting to Chao Chom Manda Phae (Bunnag), sometimes described as Chulalongkorn’s first love, as they were married while he was still a teenage prince.113 To work in the entourage of an important Siamese noblewoman, Thipkesorn had to cut her hair short in the Siamese style and wear the chongkrabaen (a wrapped and tucked trouser-like garment) worn by her patroness—in contrast to the long hair and Lan Na-style tube skirts worn by Dara Rasami and her entourage. Thipkesorn had a son by King Chulalongkorn in May 1884: Prince Dilok Nopparat, whose title was phraongchao, which denotes the status of a child born to a nonroyal consort. Surprisingly, there are no extant photos of Thipkesorn, though her son grew up to become a significant individual: the first Siamese to earn a European doctoral degree.114\n\nThipkesorn’s house, unlike Dara Rasami’s, was located well outside the high-status zone near the Chakri Maha Prasat. Despite her son’s achievements, Thipkesorn did not have a particularly close relationship with King Chulalongkorn, and she was never promoted beyond the rank of chao chom manda.115 Thipkesorn had few friends among the Inner Palace ladies besides Dara herself, with whom she was reportedly close. (One imagines that because they were the only two Lan Na consorts in the palace at that time, and Dara’s household spoke khammuang [Lan Na language], Thipkesorn and her young son, Prince Dilok Nopparat, probably spent a good deal of time in Dara’s house.) Following Thipkesorn’s death in 1903, King Chulalongkorn prompted other ladies of the Inner Palace to attend her cremation ceremony, so that Dara Rasami would not be the only consort in attendance:116\n\nNoppaporn—The funeral for Nang [wife] Thip will not have any family. [Only] Nang Dara will be there, tirelessly, by herself. I agree that it will be too quiet. Please have the royal siblings and consort-mothers, and other similar-level consorts who get along well enough, come to help out. Those that follow their hearts to come make an appearance will be a help to Prince Dilok. But the ChaoNai [Inner Palace people] should come for the cremation [only], as it would be an inconvenience [to come to the funeral itself]. ~ Siammint [King Chulalongkorn]\n\nAs Thipkesorn’s case illustrates, without the financial support and special treatment accorded a high-profile figure like Dara Rasami, life for a consort inside the Siamese palace could be one of genteel poverty and isolation. For many women of the Yellow Room and royal female relatives, their marital and career prospects were limited. For their servants and ladies-in-waiting, however, the palace offered unparalleled opportunities to better one’s social station—particularly through marriage. Several of Dara Rasami’s own ladies found matches with high-born Siamese and Lan Na men that illustrate this point. Lady Poonpun Thepsombat, Dara’s great-niece, found love with a young Siamese man serving in the Royal Pages Corps named Sunga Singholaka; when the married couple moved to a new residence across the river, Lady Poonpun founded Bangkok’s Chao Phraya River ferry service, which is still run by her descendants today.117 Dara’s attendant Bua Choom married Chao “Noi” Sukkasem, a high-ranking Chiang Mai noble who was in line for the governorship.118 Lady Thipawan married one of King Chulalongkorn’s brothers, Prince Boworadet Kridakorn, with whom she lived in England and France for several years while he was appointed ambassador. After several years abroad, the couple returned to live in Chiang Mai when Boworadet was made vice-governor of monthon Payap from 1915 to 1919, though they divorced when he returned to live in Bangkok.119\n\nThe perceived ethnic distance between the chao Lao and the Siamese still presented obstacles to such relationships, however. Another of Dara’s ladies, Kamthieng, fell for high-ranking Siamese nobleman Anou Chitchanchai Singhaseni, who headed up the palace police force. Even though both were aware that their families would disapprove of their relationship, the couple married in Chiang Mai—but because he was already married, Kamthieng’s status was that of minor wife. When they returned to Bangkok, her miseries began:\n\nLife in the capital at the status of “mia noi” [minor wife] brought heaping humiliation and mistreatment all the time, especially great for a minor wife who was “Lao,” in the opinion of Bangkok people . . . Lady Kamthieng who had been cheerful and jolly like a little bird, became a sad and depressed person, pondering hard until she was very somber.\n\nThe adversity of this life made for frail health for Lady Kamthieng, and was the reason it was damaged permanently. . . . In the end, Kamthieng fell into great distress with heart disease, and had to leave the palace. To recuperate, she went to stay at Tha Tien near Wat Chetupon, and ended her short and sad life there, though she was only 28 years old.120\n\nAnother of Dara’s ladies, Fong Kaew, became involved with Siamese noble Mom Rachawong Phoom Malakun na Ayutthaya, but broke off the relationship when she refused his demand to cut off her long, Lan Na-style hair.121 Yet another of Dara’s servants, Tunkaeo, was so eager to make a good marital match that she narrowly escaped being sold into a brothel.122 As these stories illustrate, the issue of the ethnic distance between the Siamese and Lao was still contentious during Dara Rasami’s tenure in the palace, and depended largely on the attitudes of the individuals involved (and their families). In matters of love, Lan Na women in Siam—regardless of status—remained at a distinct disadvantage from their Siamese counterparts. Much depended on a woman’s social status, and whether she was considered an insider (nai) or an outsider (phrai.)\n\nBirth and Status: The Nai and the Phrai\n\nPerhaps the most telling reflection of Dara Rasami’s difference in the context of the palace were the terms used by others to refer to her. As palace memoirist Chunlada Phakdiphumin writes of traditional Siamese society, there was a clear class distinction to be made between nai and phrai: the nai being those of noble birth, while the phrai was a broad category including both commoners and slaves.123 Among those of the generation of the Fifth Reign, nai included only nobles born directly to the Chakri royalty; all others, even those of mom luang or mom rachawong rank, were considered phrai. Given Dara Rasami’s royal Lan Na lineage, one might assume that she would automatically be considered a member of the nai, but this was not the case. According to Chunlada, Dara Rasami was considered not nai, but phrai—due primarily to the court’s perception of her as a cultural outsider, a Lao princess.124\n\nThis is reflected in the manner by which King Chulalongkorn himself referred to Dara Rasami in a number of letters written about (but not to) her. Though Dara’s official title was Chao Chom Manda Dara Rasami, starting in 1889, she is referred to in these letters not as chao or chao chom but as nang—nang being a nonroyal term, which today denotes merely wife. The king did not reserve his use of this term exclusively for Dara Rasami, however. He also used nang for a few other consorts who were not part of the Chakri royal family (and who qualified as phrai, given the above conditions). These nang included several of his favorite consorts, namely Nang Sadup, Nang Erb [Bunnag], and Nang Choom. In contrast, the king called ChaoKhunChomManda Phae, a member of the Chakri royal kin group, Khun Phae in similar communications.125\n\nOther palace folk were not so kind. Some referred to Dara Rasami as Ai Dara, ai being a personal pronoun indicating low status, which today is used as an insult.126 It appears that while Dara Rasami’s northern royal blood commanded some special treatment in the palace, her ethnic difference neutralized that status in day-to-day palace life. In the king’s estimation, Dara Rasami shared the same status level as Siamese consorts of nonroyal blood; to others, she ranked little better than a common foreigner. Despite her special status as a political princess,\n\nMany still regarded her as “Lao,” and were condescending towards her in many ways. Some Inner Palace ladies said “The Lao eat fermented fish” to embarrass her. . . . Those close to her objected to it, so they were called “Chao Beung” [serious ladies], or “lily-skinned princesses.”127\n\nEven after she was awarded her own palace residence, Dara and her ladies were vexed by various pranks:\n\nThe cutting of an effigy into a tree caused her to faint from fear. Besides this, there was also a creeping plant that climbed down into her bathroom, down which someone had loosed caterpillars all around where one would sit. Excrement was spread around the garden where she lived. All these kinds of acts of persecution were forbidden to the consorts and lesser wives who were envious of Dara Rasami, and those who detested her for being “Lao.” But they were all condemned by the King, who reprimanded them to put an end to it.128\n\nThus Dara Rasami remained an outsider to Siamese palace culture, languishing at the rank of chao chom manda for the next twenty years of her palace career. It was not until much later—in 1909—that Dara was finally promoted to a higher rank. By that time, however, Dara’s role in the Siamese palace had come to signify something quite different than when she first arrived.\n\nThe year 1892 marked not just the death of Dara Rasami’s only child, but also the start of a period of rapid—and sometimes unwelcome—political change in Siam. The following year, 1893, witnessed the brief Franco-Siamese War, in which France forced Siam to concede all tributaries in Laos and Cambodia east of the Mekong River.129 Soon afterward, the king directed his ministers to begin reorganizing the administration of Siam’s provinces in a more Western fashion. As Prince Damrong drew up monthons (provinces) divided into changwat (subregions), tambon (districts), and mubaan (villages), the traditional system of alliance-based rule gave way to a “rational,” European-style model. By 1896, the new system had supplanted the layers of local and regional sovereignty at Siam’s peripheries, and negated the need for marital alliances with women like Dara Rasami to maintain control over distant territories. The new thetsaphibaan system relied on the circulation of male Siamese bodies outward to Siam’s peripheries—versus female bodies circulating into the palace at the center—to create a new level of political control similar to that of the British and Dutch colonial possessions in South and Southeast Asia that King Chulalongkorn had visited.\n\nThe year 1893 also saw the birth of King Chulalongkorn’s last child, born in the king’s forty-first year. The rise of the rational thetsaphibaan system occurred in tandem with the decline of biopower (á la Foucault) in Siam. For Dara Rasami, the deterioration of royal fertility also scuttled her chances of bearing another royal child.130 Nonetheless, the traditional system of regional alliance-making that was in place when Dara Rasami entered the palace shifted radically in the 1890s, as kinship-based rule was displaced by bureaucratic administrative structures.\n\nWhile her political capital had declined greatly by 1895, however, Dara Rasami’s presence in the palace took on a new significance relative to a shift in the Siamese worldview described as siwilai: the practice of ranking peoples within a hierarchy of civilizations. The next chapter will explore how Dara Rasami—whether intentionally or not—became useful to the Siamese construction of siwilai as an “Other within,” performing her ethnic identity via dress, drama, and music."
