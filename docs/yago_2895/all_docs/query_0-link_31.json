We evaluated the impact of a family-centered program designed to increase the readiness/willingness of parents to disclose HIV status to their children. People living with HIV (PLWH) with children ≥8 years were surveyed regarding HIV knowledge, family relationship, attitudes, willingness/readiness to disclose, and they were then invited to participate in group education and family camps. Of 367 PLWH surveyed, 0.8% had disclosed, 14.7% had not yet disclosed but were willing/ready to disclose, 50.4% were willing but not ready, and 33.2% did not wish to disclose. The educational sessions and camps led to significant improvements of HIV knowledge and disclosure techniques, and readiness/willingness to disclose. Given the benefits of group education and family camps in supporting PLWH to improve their communication with their families and disclose their HIV status, these supporting activities should be included in HIV programs."
