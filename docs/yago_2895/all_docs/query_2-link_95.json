        "text": "One hilly island on the Gulf of Thailand has the ambience of a fishing village and the reminiscence of a royal palace to offer visitors. Its name is Koh Si Chang, comprised of nine islets, situated about 12km off the coast of Si Racha in Chon Buri.\n\nThe atmosphere is tranquil on weekdays when holiday-makers from Bangkok and elsewhere have yet to arrive. Various activities await visitors on weekends, from sightseeing to fishing, relaxing on the beach, snorkelling or kayaking off a bat-inhabited islet or meditating at a cave monastery.\n\nDue to its proximity to Bangkok, Koh Si Chang is fit for a one-day trip, as well as an overnight stay. One of its highlights is the Phra Chudadhuj Palace, established by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in the 19th century, when the island was a popular place for Siamese royals and Westerners to convalescence.\n\nHere, you will still see traces of the past. They include several royal residences and the foundation of a teak mansion, which was relocated to Bangkok and renamed Vimanmek.\n\nNear the palace stands Wat Asdangkhanimitr, whose ordination hall resembles a Buddhist pagoda blended with Gothic architecture. Another must-see piece of architecture in the palace compound is the beautiful wooden Asdang Bridge.\n\nA few minutes drive from the palace is Hat Tham Pang beach where locals and tourists relax on beach chairs, eating seafood, fried chicken, som tum and sticky rice, go fishing or cool off in the pristine waters.\n\nOn the other side of Koh Si Chang is Chong Khao Khat, or the Issariyapon Passage, where panoramic views of the island are cherished, especially at sunset. A royal pavilion, erected for for King Chulalongkorn, stands there.\n\nKoh Si Chang is also home to several sacred sites. Among them is a replica of the Lord Buddha's footprint and the Chao Phor Khao Yai Chinese Shrine.\n\nFour major festivals are celebrated annually on the island. During Chinese New Year, many people from the mainland pay their respects to the Chao Phor Khao Yai shrine. Every March, a festival is held for a large number of the faithful to worship the replica of Lord Buddha's footprint at Phra Chulachomklao Peak.\n\nOn April 19, local villagers hold a prayer ceremony and feast at the Sri Chalothornthep Shrine, the island's spirit house which was founded in 1891. In July, local residents form a parade to celebrate the start of Buddhist Lent and present a gigantic candle to the monks of Wat Chuthathit Thammasapharam.\n\nHistorical records show that the name Si Chang existed in the early Ayutthaya period. In one of his poetry books entitled Khlong Kam Suan, poet Si Prat referred to this island as Koh Sachang. However, in Samutphap Traiphum, from the late Ayutthaya and Thon Buri periods, the island was called Si Chang.\n\nThere is no hard evidence concerning the origin of the name Sachang or Si Chang. Some scholars believe the word may have originated from the Khmer word satueng, meaning \"deep water\". Others believe the word is derived from a Pali word meaning the leg of a lion, which depicts the shape of the island. This word is also pronounced Si Chang, though spelt differently.\n\nFor over a century, the island has been on a marine navigation route. Vessels travelled along the coast from Chanthaburi past Sattahip and the island before entering the Chao Phraya estuary. Protected from strong winds by mountains, Koh Si Chang has long been a port and place for loading goods. In 1879 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn there were efforts to make a map to indicate the depth of the water surrounding the island. Submerged rocks were also surveyed and iron buoys placed.\n\nIn the past, Koh Si Chang was a popular holiday destination and a place to convalescence due to its beautiful scenery, pristine air and close proximity to Bangkok.\n\nWhen King Chulalongkorn visited Koh Si Chang, he was greeted by local villagers, mostly the elderly who were healthy and strong. The king praised the island for its fine climate, which led to longevity and good health. During his reign, the island became a popular holiday resort for Westerners, and local authorities built lodgings for rent.\n\nIn 1888, the king sent the ailing HRH Prince Maha Vajiravudh to the island to recuperate. The next royals who stayed there and regained their health were one of the king's consorts, HRH Princess Saovabha Phongsri, who would later become queen, and her son HRH Prince Asdang Dejavudh.\n\nMore importantly, Koh Si Chang holds historical significance due to its relations to several Siamese kings.\n\nKing Rama IV visited the island several times and made one of the villagers, Grandma Sem, the island's caretaker holding the title of thao khiri raksa. He also restored Wat Koh Si Chang.\n\nLater, his son King Chulalongkorn visited the island for the first time as a prince. After his coronation, he took several long vacations there from 1879-1892. His reign was a golden period for Koh Si Chang with the emergence of convalescence homes, bridges, roads, wells, schools, a lighthouse and more. The king built Phra Chudadhuj Palace as a royal residence where he stayed and worked during his holidays on the island. His son King Vajiravudh, then a prince, stayed for eight months in 1888 at one of the island's lodgings when he was seriously ill.\n\nAfter the Franco-Siamese crisis in 1893, the palace was deserted. Since the 1970s, it has been maintained by Chulalongkorn University and was re-opened as a museum. Today, a 224 rai plot on the island houses the university's Marine Science Research Station.\n\nKoh Si Chang is a paradise island for people from all walks of life _ from royals and jetsetters to holidaymakers, marine scientists and adventurers along with faith practitioners.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nFrom Bangkok, both ordinary passenger coaches and air-conditioned coaches run between the Eastern Bus Terminal in Ekamai, on Sukhumvit Road, and Si Racha, Chon Buri, and between the Northern Bus Terminal in Mo Chit and Si Racha from early morning until late evening. Each bus departs every 25-50 minutes.\n\nFrom Si Racha, ferries to Koh Si Chang depart from Koh Loi pier every hour from 7am-8pm. The fare is 50 baht per person, per way. From the island, the ferries leave hourly from 6am to 6pm.\n\nTo tour Koh Si Chang, visitors can hire taxis of different kinds to suit their needs. The fare is 150 baht per trip between the palace and Chao Phor Khao Yai Shrine for a motorcycle-converted tuk tuk, 250 baht per trip around the island for a tuk tuk and 500 baht per trip per day for a songthaew, which can accommodate up to 15 persons. Renting a motorcycle costs 500 baht per day.\n\nMore Info:\n\nPhra Chudadhuj Palace Museum on Koh Si Chang opens from 9am-5pm, Tuesday-Sunday. Call 038-216-412 or 038-216-416. Admission is free."
