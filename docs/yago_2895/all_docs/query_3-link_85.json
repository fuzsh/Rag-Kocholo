        "text": "There is a necessity in maintaining a taboo on the discussion on the life and death of King Ananda Mahidol. The need is to secure the throne and ultimately to ensure the monarchy’s survival. The royal family in the 1940s was colored by the love and death of King Ananda. The move to thwart the romantic relationship of Ananda and Marileine as well as to embargo the subject of Ananda’s death revealed the attempt of the palace to guarantee its survival. Other cases as presented in this book reaffirm the palace’s position on the restriction of interracial matrimony. But times have changed. And although members of the Thai royal family have adjusted themselves to the modernity of the twenty-first century, discrimination against marrying foreigners still persists."
