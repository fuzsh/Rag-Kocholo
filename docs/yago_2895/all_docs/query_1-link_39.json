There are a number of people to whom I owe special thanks for their collegial and moral support over the years. First and foremost, I would like to thank my former academic advisers, Peter Zinoman and Penny Edwards, without whose advice, feedback, and support I might never have successfully navigated the circuitous process that ultimately allowed me to complete the research that formed the basis of this book. I also owe a debt of deep gratitude to a host of colleagues around the world who were instrumental in helping me move this project from dissertation to book. Firstly I owe thanks to Katherine Bowie for her unflagging support of my research, as well as Thongchai Winichakul for both his personal support of my work and for connecting me with Warunee Osatharom, my longtime mentor at Thammasat University’s Thai Khadi Institute, to whom I also owe a great debt of gratitude. Among my Thai colleagues, I particularly appreciate the support and feedback I’ve received from Wongsak and Chanida na Chiang Mai, Ratana (Jaeng) Pakdeekul, Plai-Auw Thongsuwat, Aroonrut Wichienkieow, Ratanaporn Sethakul, Phichet Tanthinamchai, Jirachat Santayot, and Kreuk Akornchinaret of Chiang Mai. From Bangkok (and beyond), I have Ake (Thweep) Rittinapakorn, Lupt Utama, Supatra Chowchuvech, Pat Chiraprawati, and Narisa Chakrabongse to thank for their kind assistance, encouragement, and collegiality. Among my Western colleagues whose friendship and feedback have also been invaluable to my work: Taylor Easum, Rebecca Hall, Julia Cassaniti, Bonnie Brereton, Kanjana Hubik Thepboriruk, Joel Sawat Selway, Andrew Turton, Volker Grabowsky, and Hillary Disch. My deepest thanks for sharing so generously from your own experience and research on Lan Na/northern Thai culture and history. Lastly, I thank the friends and family who have provided such tremendous emotional and moral support over the lengthy time it took to turn this research into a readable book—the last five years of which saw me through a career ix\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nchange, several moves, a separation and divorce, and a remarriage. I am especially grateful for the friendship and support of my uncle John and aunt Carol Woodhouse and my uncle David and aunt Ann Cunningham, as well as close friends Laurie Margot Ross, Marady Hill, Robin Sackett-Smith, and Karri Donahue, without whom I could not have survived these past few challenging years. Lastly, my deepest thanks and gratitude go to my husband Edo, without whom I would truly be adrift. Your love and support have been invaluable—thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nWoman between Two Kingdoms\n\nCh a pter 1\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\nT\n\nhe 1880s were a remarkable decade, witnessing the passing away of an old world and the birth of a new one. The time needed to move people and communications across long distances shrunk rapidly with the advent of the Suez Canal, the steam ship, the telephone, and transoceanic telegraph lines. European nations raced to expand their empires around the globe, from the British Raj in India to French Indochina and Dutch Indonesia. This competition imparted a particular urgency to the wild rumor that swept Bangkok in 1882: that Queen Victoria planned to adopt a young princess named Dara Rasami from Lan Na, a small kingdom roughly three hundred miles north of Bangkok, one of Siam’s principal tributary states. The threat of such a move greatly alarmed Siam’s King Chulalongkorn, as the annexation of Siam’s old enemy and neighbor Burma was well underway by the British. And they were not the only European threat: the French were also pressing in on Siam’s eastern peripheries from Cambodia and Laos. If such an adoption took place, it would expand England’s colonial reach uncomfortably close to Siam’s doorstep. It was nearly unheard of for the Siamese king to reach out to individual families in asking for their daughter’s hand, as young women were usually “gifted” to the Siamese palace as consorts (literally in the hundreds at times). But this rumor sparked quite a different response: the king acted quickly, sending a gift of jewels and a letter of engagement to secure Dara Rasami as his royal consort in 1883. Princess Dara Rasami, the only surviving daughter of the ruling line of Lan Na’s hundred-year-old Chao Chet Ton dynasty, was at that time nine years old. Dara’s story highlights the intense anxiety and uncertainty that European imperial encroachment in the region caused Siam’s rulership in that era. It also illustrates the collision between two very different views of how nation-states defined and controlled their territory. On the one hand, the rumor at the heart of the story reflects a localized awareness of the long reach of European imperialism. The idea of the adoption mirrors that of the young Punjabi Maharaja Duleep Singh, whom Queen Victoria really did bring to England from India and 1\n\n2\n\nchapter 1\n\n“raise” as an English gentleman.1 The Siamese response to the rumor, however, reaffirmed the regional practice of marital alliances between kingdoms, which was firmly rooted in modes of traditional statecraft that had been practiced in Southeast Asia for millennia. On the other hand, the story disrupts the dominant narrative of Siam as a sovereign kingdom that successfully avoided colonization by adapting to the “modern” political practices of European nations. Not only does it highlight that what is now northern Thailand was until only a century ago a separate and sovereign kingdom in its own right; it also demonstrates how central polygamous practices still were to Thai statecraft during this era. And yet, royal polygyny remains largely untouched by Western historians in their survey of this period of Thai history. Dara Rasami’s story raises for us a number of questions that the existing historical scholarship has not bothered to answer: When did the practice of royal concubinage in Siam begin, and when did it end? How did the system of royal queens and concubines work, exactly? Who were the women who became royal consorts, and where did they come from? While we are dimly aware of the fact that polygyny was practiced by the kings of Siam (as well as many other places) until a few decades ago, these questions remain unanswered outside of Thai-language scholarship. Which leads to the critical question: Why?\n\nTracing the Place of Women in Thai Historiography Modern Thai historiography was constructed by Siam’s royal elites on the nineteenth-century model of European histories, which celebrated the nation-state. In this type of modern history, as Hong Lysa succinctly puts it, “The male-associated activities of building and defending the country against hostile neighbors and colonial threats dominated the historical narrative, in which women hardly featured at all.”2 Ironically, many of these narratives can be traced to the “father of Siamese history,” Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, who was himself both a product and a practitioner of polygyny.3 Though Damrong himself wrote important historical accounts of Siam the nation, the practice of royal polygyny is notably absent from them. Western historians have perpetuated the disappearance of polygyny from Siam’s political history in twentieth-century scholarship. The seminal English-language political histories of late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century Siam emphasize the activities of its “modernizing” monarchs: King Mongkut (Rama IV, r. 1855–68), his son Chulalongkorn (Rama V, r. 1868–1910), and grandson Vajiravudh (Rama VI, r. 1910–25).4 The scholarship focusing on King\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n3\n\nChulalongkorn depicts his reign as an era of rapid—and successful—modernization, viewing it in terms of the systemic administrative changes undertaken by Chulalongkorn and his team of half-brother ministers. On the rare occasions royal women or consorts are mentioned in these works, it is in passing. If, as Joan Wallach Scott puts it, “political history has . . . been enacted on the field of gender,” then these ostensibly political histories obscure the roles of women in their assumption that Siamese statecraft was by default driven exclusively by men.5 Historians of that generation may well have been made suspicious of the topic of palace women by the efforts of a lone forerunner in the field: Anna Leonowens. Her 1870 book, The English Governess at the Siamese Court: Being Recollections of Six Years in the Royal Palace at Bangkok, brought her literary fame in both England and the United States, although her claims to both Englishness and her status as a governess have been largely debunked.6 Leonowens continued to capitalize on her unique experience in exotic, erotic Siam in her second book, The Romance of the Harem (1872). In both texts, Leonowens plays up slavery, the hot button issue of the day, to align her portrayal of the women of the Inner Palace, the walled palace-within-the-palace where the king’s consorts and female relatives lived, with those of the decadent harems of India and Ottoman Turkey—already a well-established and marketable literary genre by the 1870s.7 In Leonowens’s Siamese harem, every woman was enslaved, subject to the whims of a tyrannical and capricious king. The Thai objections to these works and their subsequent adaptations into film and musical forms have resulted in their being banned in Thailand.8 Whether out of distaste for Anna’s titillating treatments of the subject, or for the perceived political illegitimacy of the Siamese harem, historians have avoided tracing Anna’s footsteps into Siam’s Inner Palace for nearly 150 years since her departure from Siam.\n\nFinding Lost Palace Women: Materials, Methods, and Approaches The absence of palace women in the scholarship is due in some part to the challenges that face any researcher in Thai history. The archival records of the Inner Palace are sparse, and the documents that do exist offer slender but deep pockets of data on a very limited number of aspects of royal life (legal cases and medical care, in particular).9 The habit of keeping personal diaries and daily journals, so common among Western royal figures in the same era, was not practiced by Siamese royals. There are several possible reasons for this absence: while illiteracy or inconvenience could be the culprit, I suspect that Thai\n\n4\n\nchapter 1\n\ncultural presentism—which privileges staying up-to-date with current trends over adherence to past tradition—devalued the act of recording the minutiae of daily life. Given the high status of the inhabitants of the Inner Palace, however, such personal accounts could actually have been dangerous for palace women to keep, due to their royal subject matter. It simply may have been safer to keep one’s secrets, critiques, and complaints to oneself, rather than risk written words falling into the wrong hands. This is where rumors become especially important to the narrative: as anonymous reservoirs of memory that could circulate freely without consequence to their originators. To construct a comprehensive picture of the social world of King Chulalongkorn’s Inner Palace, the scholar must draw from a broader range of source materials, many of which can be found only outside the traditional archive. Many details of life in the Inner Palace can be gleaned from the memoirs of women who lived and worked there, or in works of historical fiction (such as Kukrit Pramoj’s Four Reigns). Cremation volumes, which are biographical memorial volumes published in conjunction with an individual’s funeral events, make up another significant source of accounts of life inside the palace. Another important source is oral history: interviews with surviving palace ladies and other royal descendants, like Mom Chao Jong Jitra Thanom Diskul, a daughter of Prince Damrong and niece of King Chulalongkorn, who was interviewed in later life by prominent Thai scholar and social critic Sulak Sivaraksa.10 Last but not least, museum collections, textiles, and photographs (of which there are many for the Fifth Reign) provide a tremendous trove of data for the cultural historian of this era. Thus the research for this book has drawn on a broader notion of the archive, pulling from written, oral, visual, and material “documents” to construct a picture of the lives of the Lan Na women who lived within King Chulalongkorn’s palace. In keeping with my use of a broader cultural archive, I also attempt to include as many visual images as possible to aid the reader in imagining the space and environment of the Siamese palace afresh. Thus each chapter is accompanied by illustrations and images to complement the written narrative.\n\nChapter Themes and Arguments My next section begins by familiarizing the reader with the geography and early history of Dara Rasami’s homeland, Lan Na. I situate the kingdom as part of a greater Inland Constellation of city-states between Burma and Laos. I intend this model to decenter the notion of Lan Na (and its neighboring polities) as\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n5\n\n“northern,” as it is only so from a Bangkok-centric view of the region. The cultural, geographic, and economic background I discuss in this chapter demonstrates Lan Na’s distinctiveness in contrast to Siam and sets the scene for the events of the mid-to late nineteenth century. At that time, Lan Na’s loyalties to Siam came into question as Britain consolidated its colonial presence in Burma, and British-Burmese loggers increasingly conflicted with Lan Na’s rulers. Rumors that the Queen of England wanted to adopt young princess Dara Rasami played on Bangkok’s colonial anxieties in that moment, prompting the Siamese king to extend an offer of engagement to Dara’s family. The resulting marital alliance of Dara Rasami and King Chulalongkorn, intended to cement the political relationship between Lan Na and Siam, illustrates the contingency of the historical moment produced by European colonial encroachment in the region. Chapter 2 examines Dara Rasami’s career in the world of Siam’s Inner Palace. This female-only environment, which was off-limits to the male Westerners of the time, has long been incorrectly assumed to be a harem in the same sense as Ottoman Turkey or Mughal India. The Inner Palace, considered an oriental seraglio, obscured from Western eyes the real political power relationships created and expressed there. Nonetheless, the Inner Palace represented the embodiment of the monarch’s political reach: a microcosm of the Siamese polity, where the peripheries were represented quite literally by women’s bodies. To analyze Siamese royal polygyny, I depend on a notion of the “circulation of bodies” adapted form Marx’s theory of money, wherein value accrues through circulation and movement (or the restriction thereof). This notion illuminates the idea that premodern Thai statecraft depended on a currency of human bodies—particularly those of palace women—as an important part of its political economy. This metaphor also speaks to the “geo-body” described by Thongchai Winichakul in Siam Mapped and the mapping technologies by which Siam’s political landscape was reshaped during King Chulalongkorn’s reign.11 I challenge Thongchai’s characterization by showing that the bodies of palace women— and Dara Rasami in particular—continued to function as political currency throughout the Fifth Reign era. In chapter 2, I explore the notions of circulation and social currency that governed the seclusion of elite women and the idea that high status equated to invisibility in the traditional Siamese worldview. As the highest stratum of Siamese elite society, the Inner Palace represented a cultural crucible within which Siamese culture was produced and reproduced. Here I also consider Dara Rasami’s social and political significance in terms of space and proximity to the king himself. I also consider the various ways in which her life (and that of her\n\n6\n\nchapter 1\n\nladies-in-waiting) in the palace was shaped by the distinctly Siamese customs that informed the culture of the Inner Palace. Dara Rasami’s early palace career reflects the politically central role played by provincial consorts like herself, and how their lives in the palace—as hostages for their family’s loyalty—ultimately depended on Siam’s king himself. Chapter 3 explores the ways in which Dara Rasami performed her ethnic difference from the Siamese within the palace in her later career: in particular, through her hairstyle, dress, her participation in dance-drama productions, and through different gestural forms. Even as her value as a political pawn declined toward the end of the nineteenth century, Dara exemplified how palace women’s roles took on new significance in creating and expressing notions of siwilai—the Siamese hierarchy of civilizations—in the early twentieth century. A new cultural hierarchy was formulated through the presence of Dara Rasami (and other cultural outsiders) as “Others within” Siamese elite society, in cultural expressions like the Siamese adaptation of Madame Butterfly—titled Sao Khrua Fa—and other dramatic works.12 As the Siamese aspired to incorporate modern notions of the hierarchy of civilizations—or siwilai—into their worldview, Dara Rasami provided an immediately accessible, elite yet non-Siamese Other. At the same time, Dara retained enough agency to push back against the Siamese definition of her as a “Lao lady.” Using the notion of strategic essentialism—deploying an essentialized version of a minority’s identity to resist domination by a hegemonic majority—Dara consciously reshaped the discourse around Lan Na identity, ultimately improving both her own status and Siamese perceptions of her homeland and its people.13 Strategic essentialism also helps us understand the events of Dara’s later life, which I trace in chapter 4. This chapter examines the final phase of Dara Rasami’s life following King Chulalongkorn’s death in 1910 and the nearly twenty years between her retirement to Chiang Mai in 1914 and her death in 1933. Looking at Dara’s later life and activities in her hometown reveals her ongoing interest in cultivating certain elements of Lan Na’s cultural and economic uniqueness, and her efforts to promote the educational and agricultural interests of Chiang Mai’s people. This chapter also discusses how Dara Rasami’s memory has figured in Chiang Mai over the decades since her death. While one would imagine that Dara would be considered an elite insider as a member of Chiang Mai’s old royalty, the many years she spent in Bangkok turned her into a cultural outsider by the time of her return in 1914. Comparing her with Lan Na contemporary, rebel monk Khruba Srivichai, reveals that Dara’s memory has evolved into a touchstone for the conservative royalist faction of the local elites, while Khruba\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n7\n\nSrivichai’s memory is evoked by groups at the more populist end of the political spectrum (including the Red Shirt movement that backed former Thai prime ministers Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra). The ongoing tension between these two political poles affects how Dara Rasami’s memory has been maintained and expressed in contemporary Chiang Mai. The political fortunes of Siam’s elite women were subject to a similarly ambiguous fate, which I explore in the final chapter. In the space of a single generation after King Chulalongkorn’s death, royal polygyny fell out of vogue with Siam’s monarchs (beginning with Rama VII, King Prajadhiphok, r. 1925–33). After 1932, when Siam became a constitutional monarchy, the new political system provided no equivalent spaces for women’s participation. As the consorts of Dara’s generation lived out their days secluded in their luxurious residences, palace women faded from Siam’s political and cultural center. With the expansion of Bangkok’s bureaucratic middle class in the early twentieth century, the debate about the moral and social implications of polygyny moved to the public sphere, where the practice of keeping multiple wives was criticized as a mark of elite decadence and corruption. Ultimately, Thai marriage law was written to recognize only a man’s first wife and their children, without outlawing additional marriages, though subsequent spouses and their offspring were deprived of rights in the case of inheritance and divorce. Though royal polygyny fell out of favor after the reign of King Vajiravudh (r. 1910–25), its recent resurgence reminds us of the fact that it was never formally forbidden under palatine law.14 Its contemporary usage, however, reflects a totally different view of the political roles embodied by royal concubines in the current Thai state. This analysis of Dara Rasami’s political and cultural roles as a consort during Siam’s Fifth Reign provides fresh historical perspective on the regional history of Southeast Asia, Siam’s political history, and the role of the Inner Palace as a crucial intersection of the two.\n\nLan Na and Siam: Stars in a Shifting Constellation To most people residing outside Thailand, the term Lan Na has little significance. Even for most modern Thais, Lan Na brings to mind a kingdom from Thailand’s ancient past, whose relationship to Thai history they only vaguely understand. But Lan Na’s history and cultural orientation is quite distinct from Siam’s, and it is this distinctiveness that deeply informed Dara Rasami’s worldview, making her an outsider to Siamese culture when she arrived in Bangkok to marry the king of Siam in 1883. Her role in bridging the great cultural and\n\n8\n\nchapter 1\n\npolitical differences between her homeland and Siam are what make her story both historically significant and personally compelling. Lan Na was once a kingdom on par with Siam or Burma, with a distinct language, social structure, and cultural traditions of its own. However, these differences have been largely obscured by the dominant historical narratives of the Thai nation-state, which minimize the extent of Siam’s expansion of control over neighboring city-states by describing it as “bringing them under the protection of the Siamese [royal] umbrella.” To combat this act of historical erasure, we must reorient our view of Lan Na’s role in the regional economy and politics. This move, in turn, will demonstrate the significance of Dara Rasami’s alliance with the Siamese king in the late nineteenth century. Lan Na’s historical territory comprises what are today Thailand’s eight northernmost provinces: Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, Chiang Rai, Phayao, Phrae, Nan, and Mae Hong Son.15 At one time or another, Lan Na has included parts of what is today upper Burma, Sipsòng Panna in China’s Yunnan province, Thailand’s northern and northeastern regions, and northern Laos. As this region is northern only in terms of how it is viewed from Bangkok, I prefer to reframe it as an Inland Constellation. This term both denotes the polities’ landlocked inland location and references Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah’s notion of the “galactic polity.”16 Reframing the region in this way also helps account for the constantly shifting group of city-states—muang—whose peripheries often overlapped, fluctuating with the waxing and waning of the political strength of capital cities at their centers, and the pull of neighboring states. These muang and the satellite polities under their control were linked by commonalities of geography and economy that created shared elements of culture and religion.17 Whether or not geography is destiny, the particular political and environmental challenges posed by this physical landscape produced a cohesive cultural environment in Lan Na that was highly distinct from (though sometimes influenced by) those of Burma, China, and Siam.18 The physical characteristics of the Inland Constellation’s terrain are markedly different from those of central Thailand. Starting north of today’s city of Phitsanulok, the terrain rises sharply to high, thickly forested mountain ranges separating many narrow, flat river valleys. These mountain ranges, which run mostly from north to south, are extensions of the Yunnan mountain ranges of southern China and the eastern Himalayas. The snowmelt waters winding through these ranges flow into the Mekong River to the east, the Salween in the west, and Chiang Mai’s Mae Ping River, into a host of tributaries that feed the Chao Phraya River in the central Thai plains, facilitating trade, travel, and communications\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n9\n\nin the region.19 The mountainous terrain provided rich resources for both hunter-gatherers and small-scale agriculturists. However, it also made overland travel difficult and slow going, and even movement on the waterways was largely limited to the rainiest months of the year (typically July through November). These geographic factors made it essential for settlers to choose sites that could remain largely self-sufficient for much of the year. The narrow riverine highlands and valleys, while resource rich, were sparsely populated compared to the wide, flat lowlands of Siam. Due to the steep, mountainous terrain separating them, Lan Na’s small river valley communities had limited farmland, necessitating periodic interaction with other communities for continued survival. Thus the much-vaunted self-sufficiency of northern villages was largely mythical.20 In reality, most Lan Na village economies depended on their ability to trade local crops and goods with larger towns in exchange for supplemental rice and necessities like salt. Additional trade came from seasonal visits from overland caravans traveling between Burma and China. A number of such caravans linked in turn to the tea trade route even further north called the Tea Horse Road, which stretched between Sipsòng Panna and Tibet.21 At the same time, rivers also served as trade routes running north and south through the steep valleys, giving overland routes connections to entrepôts with oceanic access, such as Phitsanulok in the west and Luang Prabang in the east.22 Traders brought a continuous flow of cultural and religious elements to the towns of the Inland Constellation, from crafts and textiles to religious concepts and practices. Another characteristic shared by the people of Lan Na and the rest of the Inland Constellation was a preference for glutinous (sticky) rice, versus the long-grain rice grown in Siam’s low-lying Chao Phraya River basin.23 Such trade flows gave Lan Na’s cultural and economic exchanges a markedly inland orientation, in contrast to the distinctly oceanic orientation of the Siamese entrepôt kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Bangkok (which we could think of as part of a Maritime Constellation, á la Anthony Reid’s formulation).24\n\nEnduring Patterns: Lan Na, Burma, and the Khon Muang Informed by these geographic and physical constraints, Lan Na’s rulers favored a style of rulership that depended on familial connection, in which women played a key role. Thirteenth-century King Mangrai, for example, not only arranged marriages with a number of local women to consolidate his political authority, but also arranged his sons’ marital alliances with the daughters of neighboring kings in order to align the loyalties of the satellite cities with the capital\n\n10\n\nchapter 1\n\nat Chiang Mai.25 This pattern of “daughter-in-law” succession he established, which granted local women important roles in localizing the rule of invading rulers, persisted as the dominant political pattern in Lan Na until the late nineteenth century. The practice was distinct enough from those of its neighbors to warrant special mention in Ming dynasty chronicles, where Lan Na was described as “the land of 800 daughters-in-law.”26 By the mid-sixteenth century, Lan Na became desirable to the Burmese as a northern base for their incursions into central Siam. In the 1560s, the Burmese took advantage of political instability in Lan Na to take control of the region, marking the start of a period of indirect colonial rule and cultural continuity. The potential for rebellions was quelled by deporting most of Lan Na’s noble families to Burma; whatever relatives remained were forbidden to intermarry, effectively disrupting the old networks of marital and kinship ties between the constellation’s muang and allowing the Burmese to divide and rule. The long-term Burmese presence in Lan Na imparted certain influences to local foodways, dress, and language.27 Nonetheless, Burmese control was strongest in Chiang Mai and Chiang Saen, while it was much looser in the farther-flung muang of Nan, Phrae, and Lampang. By the eighteenth century, Burma’s efforts to impose changes in Lan Na were felt to be increasingly oppressive, and sporadic rebellions erupted on the peripheries. After a Chinese invasion in 1771 weakened Burmese control, Lan Na’s remaining nobles were able to oust the colonial official from Chiang Mai. When the rebels got word to the Siamese General Taksin at Bangkok, he rapidly sent troops to assist them in Chiang Mai and Lampang.28 As Siam’s Chakri dynasty began in 1782, Kawila was crowned king of the refounded Lan Na kingdom. However, the capital he inherited was nearly desolate, having suffered decades of warfare and wholesale deportation of its populace. According to a chronicle of the era: At that time Chiang Mai was depopulated and had become a jungle overgrown by climbing plants, it turned into a place where rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers and bears were living. There were few people [left], only enough for building houses to live in and roads to facilitate communication with each other. Thus, there were no opportunities for clearing [the jungle].29 Before the king could take up residence in Chiang Mai once again, the capital needed to be rebuilt. The new king then embarked on a process of repopulation and resettlement called “putting people into cities as vegetables into baskets.”30\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n11\n\nThe first step was persuading several groups who had fled the area to return: some were residents who had fled to Mae Hong Son in the 1760s and from Tak and Lampang to Siam some twenty years before. Though this process met with some success, “the severe losses of population caused by war, famine, and epidemics could . . . hardly be compensated for” by voluntary migration.31 Consequently, Kawila embarked on a long-term campaign to resettle Lan Na’s cities in three waves: the first from 1783 to 1786, the second from 1798 to 1804, and the final wave lasting from 1808 to 1813.32 Though some of these efforts began with rulers sending gifts to the local elites to entice them to relocate their villages, more often than not they ended with military forces rounding up people and forcibly moving them to Chiang Mai33—a process which often cost many lives.34 To the east, the regional center of Nan, which had also sworn allegiance to Siam but was unconnected with Chiang Mai’s ruling elites, similarly repopulated their villages with people from Sipsòng Panna.35 These campaigns resulted in an ethnically diverse population, including the Lüe of Sipsòng Panna, the Khoen of the Chiang Tung area, and the Tai Yai from the muang of Sat, Pan, and Phu.36 These resettled peoples “were seen by the Yuan not at all as khon tang chat [foreigners], but were viewed as people belonging to a greater Lan Na cultural zone,” since they spoke mutually intelligible dialects and utilized a similar writing system.37 There were also numbers of Karen, Lawa, and other upland peoples among the war captives. Following preexisting patterns of cooperative upland–lowland relationships, these peoples were seen as semicivilized, and thus appropriate for urban resettlement. These groups were allocated land in the outlying areas surrounding the walled center of the capital city and their populations scattered across multiple communities to prevent uprisings. In and around contemporary Chiang Mai, a number of these communities still bear place names that reflect the origins of these resettled peoples, who often named them for their home villages.38 From this ethnic diversity sprung the khon muang identity (literally “people of the muang,” a muang being a village, town, or city) in Lan Na. This supraethnic category was forged by Lan Na’s rulers—themselves ethnically Yuan—as a coherent identity for the peoples recently resettled from the hinterlands.39 As a multilayered identity, which allowed relocated highland peoples to retain elements of their ethnic difference, khon muang came to denote blended Lan Na lowland city and village dwellers over decades of intermarriage and exchange. While resettled groups’ linguistic and ethnic heritage was never erased, it was subsumed by khon muang identity, distinguishing Lan Na city dwellers from their upland counterparts.\n\n12\n\nchapter 1\n\nTo the central plains Siamese, however, the definition of khon muang depended on the situation: sometimes individual ethnicities were names (as in the Yuan, in particular, as that was the ethnicity of the ruling elites); however, the Siamese most often referred to khon muang as Lao, which was more a reference to their shared language than either geography or ethnicity. This may be confusing to present-day observers familiar only with the nation-state of Laos. What is important here is that the territory of Lao speakers then encompassed the territory from Phitsanulok in the south to Chiang Rai in the north, and from Burma in the west to Luang Prabang in the east. Thus, when the term Lao is used in this text, it should be understood as the exonym for the khon muang of Lan Na as perceived by the Siamese.\n\nShifting Economies, Shifting Allegiances: Lan Na in the 1850s Lan Na scarcely had time to enjoy its newfound peace and prosperity before global events destabilized the balance of power in the region once again. In faraway England, the dispensations of the 1824 Treaty of London gave Britain control of the trade ports of Ceylon (India), Malacca (Indonesia), Singapore, and Penang (Malaysia). British rule in northeastern India culminated in the first Anglo-Burmese War (1823–26), forcing the Burmese to sign exploitive treaties that financially devastated the kingdom. The defeat of Burma—an old enemy of both Lan Na and Siam—made Great Britain the dominant European power in the region. Even more worrisome, however, was British control of the territory of Tenasserim, which shared the common boundary of the Salween River with Chiang Mai. For the first time, Lan Na and Siam were confronted with a Western colonial power as an immediate neighbor.40 At the same time, Siam was experiencing problems on its eastern frontiers as well. Possibly influenced by news of the British victory in Burma, the king of Vientiane (Laos), Chao Anouwongse, launched a military offensive southward toward Bangkok in 1827. This incursion has been interpreted differently by Siamese and Lao historians. Was it an attempt to reestablish the ancient kingdom of Lan Xang, an effort to “liberate” thousands of Lao who had been resettled by the Siamese in Nakhon Ratchasima in the 1770s, or a preemptive strike against “Thai aggression” aiming to dismantle Lao independence entirely?41 In either case, Chao Anou’s campaign was seen as a sign of aggression by the Siamese, who responded quickly and ruthlessly. In addition to destroying Chao Anou’s capital city of Vientiane, the Siamese deported its entire population (estimated conservatively at one hundred thousand people)\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n13\n\nfrom the east bank of the Mekong River westward to the interior of Siam’s Khorat Plateau. After Chao Anou’s capture in 1828, he was taken to Bangkok and imprisoned publicly in a cage, where he died after several days of direct exposure to the punishing forces of both the blistering sun and the derision of the Siamese populace.42 Why did the Siamese treat a former vassal so brutally? The open rebellion of one of its tributary rulers—particularly a Buddhist one—was perceived as undermining the dharmic authority of the Siamese king. As European pressure increased on both Siam’s eastern and western frontiers, a harsh response signaled Siam’s intolerance of internal challenges to their monarch’s increasingly centralized power. For Lan Na, whose nobles’ loyalties were somewhat divided over the episode, Siam’s message was clear as to the fate awaiting any vassals foolish enough to openly display disloyalty to Bangkok.43 Meanwhile, in Lan Na, the increasing British presence in the region did not appear to threaten the local rulership—quite the contrary. On the conclusion of the First Anglo-Burmese War (1825), Lan Na’s king sent a number of letters to the British at Moulmein (Burma) requesting formal contact, presumably to establish trade relations.44 The British development of Moulmein into an inland trade center increased the flow of trade between Chiang Mai and Burma, and initiated two new industries that would quickly become major revenue streams for Lan Na’s nobles: cattle and teak. Starting in 1826, British troops stationed at the Moulmein garrison required a steady supply of beef, as standard rations for British soldiers included a pound of fresh beef per soldier per day. When the garrison was smaller, the average demand was about seven hundred head of cattle per year; by the later 1830s, demand had grown to 2,500–3,000 head per year.45 The “Shan bullocks,” as they were called, were considered higher quality beef than either buffalo meat or the flesh of cows from Madras or Bengal, and their worth was accordingly higher. In 1841, for example, around two hundred Moulmein traders were said to be waiting to buy cattle in Chiang Mai with one hundred thousand rupees—a sum that could purchase up to five thousand head.46 Cattle remained the most profitable export from Lan Na until the mid-1850s, then only surpassed by the value of teak in the 1860s as the forests were depleted.47 As cattle and teak became the most profitable export products, the Lan Na economy’s center of gravity shifted westward to British Burma. However, it was not until Siam’s attempts to extend their political control over Lan Na in the 1850s that the relationship between the two mandalas became strained nearly to the breaking point.\n\n14\n\nchapter 1\n\nTurning Point: The Chiang Tung Wars, 1848–54 Following a succession crisis in 1848, the Lan Na muang of Chiang Rung requested Siamese military assistance in quelling civil unrest. During this crisis some of the city’s nobles fled to (now British-Burmese) Chiang Tung, where they sought the support of local Burmese nobles, highlighting the fluid relationship that still existed among the Burma–Lan Na muang of the old constellation.48 The Siamese chronicle of the time quotes Siam’s King Rama III as stating, “If we can subdue Chiang Tung, Chiang Rung will be ours.”49 To this end, the Siamese king authorized Chiang Mai to conscript a total of 7,500 men to attack Chiang Tung, but the expedition was ultimately a failure.50 When Siam’s King Mongkut (Rama IV) inherited this enterprise from his older brother in 1852, Chiang Rung had requested assistance once again—but this time, the Siamese felt Siam’s reputation was at stake. This time, the conscripts from cities throughout Lan Na, plus troops sent from Bangkok, totaled thirty thousand.51 Though King Mongkut sent his own brother, Prince Wongsa Thirat, to head up the new offensive on Chiang Tung, the effort was plagued by both tactical and supply problems; food supplies ran out due to a bad harvest in Chiang Mai that year.52 By the time the troops from Bangkok arrived to relieve Lan Na forces, they heard that the Burmese were sending reinforcements and withdrew, ending the offensive. Meanwhile in Burma, since Britain’s victory in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1853, its trade monopoly in Burma’s rice-rich delta region was solidified, forcing Burmese King Mindon (r. 1853–78) to seek out new sources of state income. King Mindon was described by Western observers as a forward-looking, modernizing” monarch (in much the same vein as his Siamese contemporary, King Mongkut). As the British export of most of Burma’s rice production depleted Burma’s economy, the monarch hastened to find new ways to generate income. Mindon’s strategy was twofold: he established industrial factories at Mandalay and encouraged trade with southern China, the Shan States, Lower Burma, India, and Europe to offset the loss of agricultural revenues to the royal coffers.53 These efforts increased the level of trade (and the number of Burmese traders) flowing between upper Burma and Chiang Tung and into southern China in the 1850s. Siam made one last attempt to retake Chiang Tung in 1854, but it was also unsuccessful. Though King Mongkut and his ministers wanted more than ever to take the outpost once and for all, it proved impossible to gather the thirty to forty thousand additional soldiers that the Siamese needed. Many local\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n15\n\nconscripts fled, leaving the commanders with fewer than ten thousand troops. The timing of the new offensive also coincided with the start of the rainy season, making overland travel difficult and oxcart transportation of provisions all but impossible. By all accounts, Lan Na’s heart just was not in it: the lack of support by the local nobles and abysmal troop morale were the main reasons why the campaign was finally abandoned.54 In material terms, however, the losses suffered by Siam in the offensive were paltry compared to those endured by Lan Na. Not only had Siam ignored Chiang Mai’s requests to delay the final attack, but it was Lan Na—not Siam—whose cities had borne the loss of the humanpower expended in the offensive. Siam, as Lan Na’s supposed protector, had failed them, and at a high cost. Additionally, Lan Na still had both family and economic links with Chiang Tung, now a rapidly growing trade center that Lan Na could ill afford to alienate. The period following the Chiang Tung Wars of the mid-1850s found Lan Na scrambling to recover from the significant human losses it suffered through Siam’s failed military campaign, and to repair its relationship with an important trade partner in the region. As for Siam, they had lost face to both Burma and Lan Na and gained nothing on their northern frontier. If anything, the necessity of King Mongkut’s intervention in matters of Lan Na’s succession in 1855 highlighted Siam’s lack of control over their peripheries in Lan Na and the increasing contingency of the regional situation of the British presence in Burma.\n\nTesting Lan Na’s Loyalties to Siam In the 1840s, Burmese loggers, now British legal subjects, began making their way into Lan Na’s forests in increasing numbers, cutting teak logs to send to Moulmein for processing and sale. Heretofore Lan Na’s forests had been considered the property of the royal family: they were traditionally viewed as a local building resource, rather than a source of commercial income. At first, there were no fixed fees for cutting trees in Lan Na; individual loggers negotiated a per-tree price, which was collected by officials and divided three ways between the forest owner, the collecting official, and finally the ruler himself.55 During the 1850s, however, the policy changed as the forest trade rapidly expanded. Fees were revised and separated into three categories, depending on the size of the tree cut. For example, a tree measuring eight-to ten-hands’ breadth cost one rupee; eleven to thirteen hands cost two rupees, and fourteen to sixteen hands cost three rupees. These fees went up over time, presumably as the forests of\n\n16\n\nchapter 1\n\nupper Burma were depleted; by 1896 (when Siam established its Department of Forestry) the fee had risen to twelve rupees per tree.56 The rising value of teak forest leases led to a corresponding rise in the number of disputes with the nobles of Chiang Mai. King Kawilorot (r. 1854–70) was involved in a number of legal disputes with British-Burmese parties in Chiang Mai, for which he was summoned to Bangkok to defend himself in court. Though he ultimately won his case, the handling of the matter by the Siamese resulted in the northern chao leaving Bangkok resentful and with hurt pride.57 Absent any other means of controlling Kawilorot, Siam’s King Mongkut decided to adopt a policy of appeasement toward the Lan Na rulership. In 1856, rumors about the loyalties of Chiang Mai’s king began to circulate. Apparently King Kawilorot found the anti-Western attitude of the Burmese elite more appealing than the conciliatory stance of the Thai.58 After a round of correspondence with the Burmese king at Ava, King Kawilorot allegedly ordered the execution of his Burmese translator, so that no one could divulge the nature of their communications. Kawilorot’s exchange of elephants with the Burmese king was reported to Bangkok by two members of a rival faction in the Chiang Mai court. Unfortunately for them, when Kawilorot was called to make his case to King Mongkut in Bangkok, he managed to convince Mongkut that his activities were innocent, and he carried the day. Kawilorot’s rivals, in turn, were held in Bangkok where their questionable loyalties could be more closely monitored.59 This episode demonstrates Kawilorot’s dissatisfaction with Lan Na’s place in Siam’s tributary scheme and his consideration of a plan to realign Lan Na with a powerful old neighbor who had had its own recent troubles with Western interests. Though Kawilorot’s original scheme to align himself with a northern Burmese king may ultimately have failed, his brilliant—if duplicitous—performance in Bangkok resulted in both his vindication in the eyes of the Siamese and the elimination of his political rivals in Chiang Mai. This episode provided an instructive example to Lan Na’s nobility as to how they should best manage their role in the region’s shifting political balance of power. First, they learned the power of rumor, by which threats could be made indirectly to the Siamese while maintaining plausible deniability. Second—and perhaps more importantly—Lan Na had learned the advantage of playing Burma and Siam against each other. These lessons were passed down to the next generation of Lan Na’s rulership: Kawilorot’s daughter Thipkraisorn (figure 1) and her husband, Inthanon, who became the next rulers of Chiang Mai in 1870.\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n17\n\nFigure 1.

Wikimedia Commons/public domain.\n\nThe 1874 Chiang Mai Treaty: Undermining Lan Na’s Autonomy In 1873, the year of Princess Dara Rasami’s birth, two other major political events occurred in the region. First, the young Siamese king, Chulalongkorn, was finally crowned, having spent five years under a regent following the death of his father, Mongkut, in 1868. Second, in Lan Na, Dara’s father Inthanon was officially recognized by Chulalongkorn as successor to the throne of Chiang Mai. On Inthanon’s annual visit to Bangkok that year, he received the title of\n\n18\n\nchapter 1\n\nchao luang (high king) of Chiang Mai and was given the enhanced reign name of Inthawichyanon. However, his visit was not entirely triumphant: not only did he not receive the higher title he was hoping for on this occasion, but he was also saddled with fines from legal cases left over from the prior king’s reign. These fines, totaling 466,000 rupees, were too much for the new king to pay at one time, so a seven-year period was granted for repayment. This fine reflects the increased importance of the teak trade in Lan Na—but also the increasing concerns of the Siamese over the dealings of the Lan Na nobility in teak-related disputes with British-Burmese loggers. By 1851, the annual income to the Chiang Mai nobility from timber leases had spiraled to nearly 150,000 rupees, plus nearly as much in bribes and fees charged by nobles.60 British officer Thomas Lowndes, sent from upper Burma in 1871 to survey the situation in Chiang Mai, described frequently overlapping forest tract leases and cases of outright double-leasing by local nobles.61 Conflicts over these problematic leases, thefts, and unresolved lawsuits resulted in British demands for Siamese intervention. By 1873, the British government in India was actively campaigning in Bangkok for an agreement that would guarantee their subjects greater protection in their timber dealings in Lan Na. The Chiang Mai Treaty was concluded rather hastily in 1874 between the British Indian government in Calcutta and the Siamese in Bangkok.62 The treaty’s name is ironic, as in reality Chiang Mai rulership played no part in drafting the document. Though the British requested that Chiang Mai’s king be included in the negotiations, the Siamese demurred, claiming that his involvement would lengthen the already-long negotiation process by at least four months, to allow for the necessary travel time between Chiang Mai and Bangkok—a delay that the British rejected. Thus the Siamese and British excluded Lan Na’s rulers from drawing up a treaty that would affect the local economy, judicial practices, and ultimately Lan Na’s sovereignty itself. The 1874 Chiang Mai Treaty included several provisions that directly affected Chiang Mai’s governance. First, a system of dual government was established, with a full-time resident Siamese kha luang (royal servant) or commissioner stationed in Chiang Mai. The second provision established a permanent police force to monitor posts along the Salween River to prevent thefts and banditry on loggers traveling through the area. Third, new regulations were put in place to control the leasing of teak forests. Last, a new system of taxes and monopolies was introduced that greatly impacted Chiang Mai’s economy and society. Under the new dual government, the Siamese kha luang investigated and adjudicated all legal cases brought by British subjects against Lan Na or Siamese\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n19\n\nsubjects in Chiang Mai’s international court.63 These cases, which consisted mainly of disputes involving timber leases between British-Burmese loggers and local forest holders, were to be heard by both the Siamese commissioner and the British consul (who visited only periodically). Those charged with regular criminal offenses were to be tried in the Siamese courts regardless of their nationality, and if a British subject was unhappy with the Chiang Mai court’s decision, the case could be sent to the British officer in Burma for review.64 This gave Burmese-British subjects a differential level of legal protections in Siam, as they could demand the application of British law rather than Siamese law to their cases—which greatly increased their chances of defeating Lan Na defendants, who were usually forest-leasing nobles. The new tax farms and monopolies created by the treaty also undermined the authority of Chiang Mai’s nobility, even while filling their coffers. The new tax farms were licenses auctioned off to the highest bidder that granted holders the right to collect specified taxes from the populace on behalf of the government. As these auctions required substantial up-front investment, accessible to few common folks in either Siam or Lan Na, licenses were usually won by members of the Chinese merchant class, which had access to larger cash reserves. Monopolies on the sales of commodities like sticklac, betel nut, and cloth—worth several thousand British pounds annually—had in the past been the province of the local nobility. Under the new structure, they were bought up mainly by Chinese tax farmers “hitherto unknown in the state.”65 While Chinese immigrants had freely flowed into provincial Siam and Lan Na via both Bangkok and Yunnan since the 1850s, the new tax farming system prompted a new influx. As part of the new tax system, the Siamese commissioner also created new tax monopolies on guns and ammunition, tobacco, ivory, pork, and rice whisky.66 Due to Chinese tax collectors’ “social and spatial distance from the local people,” they did not feel obliged to trade as fairly with local people as Lan Na’s nobility.67 Additionally, these new tax collectors insisted on payments in cash rather than goods-in-kind—a practice that became increasingly burdensome on the common populace of Lan Na. The Siamese commissioner also profited personally, setting up a number of tax farms and monopolies that benefitted both himself and the Siamese king. He persuaded the Chiang Mai king to divide the new tax and monopoly incomes into three parts, with one third paying for the administrative expenses of the kha luang himself.68 As for the rest of the new tax income, however, most went into the pockets of the highest-ranking Lan Na nobles. Besides the income from teak, the monies\n\n20\n\nchapter 1\n\nbrought in by monopolies on gambling and cloth increased the Chiang Mai ruler’s income to roughly 280,000 rupees a year—a lavish sum in the 1870s.69 To understand the impact of this income on the lifestyles of Chiang Mai’s elites, we can compare the accounts of two Western travelers to Chiang Mai both before and after the establishment of the new tax system. An 1871 account describes the houses of Chiang Mai’s king and his next-in-command as “merely substantial, but rather plain, wooden houses with tile roofing.”70 In 1876, only a year after the implementation of the new tax farming system, Lowndes reports that the houses had become built up like “enormous edifices, broken up into gables and separate roofs that give them the appearance of small villages. The houses of the other chiefs are large, rambling structures, but considerably smaller than the above.”71 The Chiang Mai Treaty of 1874 effectively increased the incomes of the ruling elites through extractive tax measures imposed on the common people. Yet the actors most closely identified with the exploitative taxes and monopolies were not the nobles themselves, but the new Chinese tax collectors. By utilizing outsiders to implement the unpleasant new measures, Lan Na’s chao insulated themselves from criticism by their subjects, even as they profited from their complicity with the Siamese administration. At the same time, the Siamese government mollified Lan Na’s rulership by increasing the level of income derived from the new tax system, effectively buying off Lan Na’s senior chao to distract them from the very real loss of their political autonomy.72 Thus the Chiang Mai Treaty of 1874 set in motion a number of policies that began to undermine the traditional social and economic ties between the Lan Na nai (elites) and phrai (commoners). It also marks the beginning of Lan Na’s long transition to a cash economy. But the treaty’s ultimate failure to enforce British claims in Lan Na eventually resulted in an even more intrusive agreement in 1883: the second Chiang Mai Treaty.\n\nWhat Went Wrong: Or, Why a New Chiang Mai Treaty Was Necessary Under the first Chiang Mai Treaty of 1874, the British were empowered to periodically send an official from Burma to Chiang Mai to judge cases that had not been satisfactorily settled in the Siamese court. The first of these officers, A. H. Hildebrand, was dispatched to Chiang Mai in early 1875 to settle several legal cases in tandem with the new Siamese commissioner. However, after only three months in the city, Hildebrand left in frustration at his inability to get satisfactory responses from the commissioner.73 Due primarily to indecision by\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n21\n\nthe British colonial office at Calcutta as to how best to proceed after that, there was no new British official visit to Chiang Mai until 1879, which “virtually spelt the epitaph of the 1874 Treaty arrangements,” as there had been no British representative present to ensure that new cases were settled to the satisfaction of the British subjects involved.74 While the Siamese commissioner’s mission in Chiang Mai may have failed in the eyes of the British, his main objectives from the Siamese point of view were quite different. The 1874 treaty—and his presence in Chiang Mai—satisfied their two major goals: first, it kept problematic Chiang Tung in check, and second, it ensured the repayment of Chao Inthanon’s considerable debts (fines from the various teak logging lawsuits levied in 1874) to the Siamese. On the first count, the Siamese still feared that the Lan Na rulership’s relationship with the Burmese through Chiang Tung was too cozy. Chiang Mai’s nobles had become friendly with the Shan resettling the deserted city of Chiang Saen. Word reached the Siamese that Lan Na’s king had sent a “friendly mission” to Mandalay in January of 1874.75 And in early 1875, Siamese officials learned of “a number of amicably-worded letters passed between Chieng Tung and Nai on the one hand, and [Chiang Mai’s King] Inthanon on the other,” further fueling Siam’s anxieties.76 King Inthanon’s debts also figured into Siam’s new presence in Chiang Mai. In the past, the only regular payment that Chiang Mai had made to Bangkok was a triennial tribute payment. But after Inthanon was fined more than 466,000 rupees in 1873,77 it became part of the Siamese commissioner’s responsibilities to ensure the collection on the loan. This payment plan, coupled with a new forest registration framework that prevented overlapping and duplicate forest leases, completely altered the financial situation of the Chiang Mai nobility, whose massive holdings of teak forests were their major source of income. So it is unsurprising that when the new Siamese commissioner suggested in 1873 that the Chiang Mai king grant a host of lucrative new monopolies, he was more than amenable. Despite a host of restrictions intended to prevent corruption, Siamese administrators to Chiang Mai were not immune to the temptations of their high posts. One early appointee Phra Narin was accused of “. . . systematically robbing this country and prostituting his office,” taking in between twenty and thirty thousand dollars annually on the side by 1879.78 Subsequent replacements’ success in “reforming” the practices of the Chiang Mai rulership met with varying levels of resistance and cooperation, with local villagers’ interests often caught in the middle.\n\n22\n\nchapter 1\n\nDespite optimism following the enactment of the 1874 treaty, the British were ultimately disappointed in the progress of legal procedures in Chiang Mai and lobbied the Siamese government for a new agreement in 1882. As the teak industry had grown exponentially in the region, bringing further conflicts between British loggers and Lan Na forest owners, the British felt the timing was right for a new treaty, as they had finally found the funds to station a vice-consul permanently in Chiang Mai. At the same time, the Siamese began to feel increasing territorial pressure from both Britain in the west and France in the east, which prompted a reevaluation of their tributary relationship with Lan Na. Ultimately, the setup of the international court in 1883 under the second Chiang Mai Treaty became the “model for the Siamese modern court system.” 79 Needless to say, the new treaty and courts were not popular with the Chiang Mai rulership. Losses of timber-related legal cases drained the coffers of Lan Na’s noble families, and the Siamese—not the British—were perceived as being to blame. As new tensions arose between King Inthanon and Siamese commissioners, so did a renewed awareness of the potential benefits of playing the British-Burmese and the Siamese against each other. It is here that Lan Na’s traditional patterns of family rule—and women’s roles in creating political alliances—enter again into the story.\n\nLan Na Women and Rulership As mentioned earlier in this chapter, women played roles of particular prominence in political and social life in the Inland Constellation. Lan Na society, as in the Lao and Isaan regions, was matriarchal and matrilocal.80 From early times, marrying a local chief’s daughter was an important element of Lan Na statecraft, resulting in the Chinese chroniclers’ nickname for the area, “land of 800 daughters-in-law.”81 In the Lan Na city of Lamphun (located about sixteen miles south of Chiang Mai), Queen Chamathewi, founder of the seventh-century Mon Buddhist kingdom of Hariphunchai, remains a prominent figure in Lan Na mythology and historical thought. Lan Na’s political patterns reflected women’s prominence as well. In the Lan Na pattern of royal succession, the throne devolved not to the king’s eldest son, but rather to his eldest daughter’s husband. While it contrasts greatly with the European practice of male primogeniture, this pattern of succession is consistent with practices in earlier Lan Na history. The local historical exemplar of these practices is thirteenth-century King Mangrai, the first ruler to unite a\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n23\n\ntrue Lan Na empire. Mangrai married his sons out to the daughters of noble families in neighboring Lan Na towns as a means of integrating political control. It appears that this mode of rule also shaped the unique pattern of royal succession that emerged during the latter part of the Chao Chet Ton (Seven Lords) dynasty. This pattern, identified by the anthropologist Gehan Wijeyewardene as “son-in-law succession,” flowed from father to son-in-law through the women of the family.82 This pattern was practiced by both royal and common families within La Na and evolved over the first hundred years of the Chao Chet Ton dynasty.83 From 1840 onward, royal succession in Chiang Mai adhered to the same pattern, in which the successor was married to the daughter of the prior king. For example, King Kawilorot (r. 1854–1970) was married to Chao Mae Utsah, the daughter of his predecessor, King Mahotraprathet (r. 1847–54). (See figure 2.) On King Kawilorot’s death in 1870, the Lan Na throne passed not to his son, but rather to his eldest daughter Thipkraisorn’s husband. Thus succession flowed from Kawilorot through his daughter, to be held (at least nominally) by her husband. According to contemporary sources, Thipkraisorn was allowed to choose her own husband, giving her unprecedented influence over the succession process.84 Though her chosen spouse, Inthanon, had already been married (several times, to boot), Thipkraisorn forced him to give up his previously acquired wives.85 In 1884, visiting explorer Carl Bock wrote: He looked—as he had the reputation of being—a kindly-disposed man, but weak. He was, it appeared, quite overruled by his wife [Thipkraisorn], who seemed to be quite a sufficiently strong-minded individual to make up for his weakness. She was his third wife, and when he married her she compelled him not only to enter the priesthood, but to put away all his concubines. He did not wear the yellow cloth long—only seven days—but that was considered long enough to cleanse him.86 Though Inthanon’s lineage was traceable to another of Kawila’s brothers, he held a relatively minor rank among the royals; his marriage to Thipkraisorn raised his status considerably. In this case, the custom of son-in-law succession linked two branches of Chiang Mai nobility. From this perspective, Inthanon’s marriage to the king’s daughter, and subsequent assumption of the throne, was consistent with traditional Lan Na marital practices. In any event, it meant no loss of power for Chao Mae Thipkraisorn, as we will soon see. Lan Na women, both elite and common, benefited from cultural practices that accorded them a high level of agency and status. Lan Na women retained\n\nMahawong\n\nKing Thamfan\n\nThird King of Chiang Mai; brother of Thammalangka\n\nMae Jao Thawey\n\nKawila\n\nFirst King of Chiang Mai; brother of Thammalangka\n\nAnocha\n\nFifth King of Chiang Mai\n\nMae Utsa\n\nTham Thong\n\nMae Jao Khamla\n\nSixth King of Chiang Mai\n\nKawilorot\n\nDaughter of Fifth King\n\nUbonwanna\n\nInthawichyanon\n\nSeventh King of Chiang Mai\n\nDaughter of Sixth King\n\nThipkraisorn\n\nDara Rasami's aunt\n\nDara Rasami\n\nChantra Sopha\n\nFigure 2.

On marriage, the Lan Na groom typically moved into his bride’s household for at least the first year following marriage.90 Traditionally, Lan Na’s communities were not strictly matrilineal, but were “organized into matriclans, [where] muang matrilocal ideology is closely linked to a matrilineal mode of descent.”91 These matriclans were organized around women who maintained their family’s relationship with their ancestral spirits, particularly through their roles as spirit-mediums.92 This combination gave Lan Na women a higher level of influence and agency than even their relatively high-status sisters in Siam. In terms of the high level of agency enjoyed by Lan Na women, perhaps no better examples can be found than Kawilorot’s daughters, Thipkraisorn and her sister Ubonwanna, both of whom possessed great personal charisma and exercised considerable political and economic influence in Chiang Mai. Thipkraisorn was widely acknowledged to be the real power behind the throne in Chiang Mai. As one American Protestant missionary wrote, “The present queen [Thipkraisorn] is the one who truly has ruling power in her hands. As for her husband, he is the king in name only.”93 Her younger sister, Ubonwanna, was a wealthy businesswoman in her own right, trading in timber and the local caravan trade, as well as textiles produced by the sizable atelier of women weavers working at her residence. To many Westerners, Thipkraisorn embodied the strong yet proper (married) Lan Na noblewoman: [Thipkraisorn] was evidently a perfect lady, quiet and self-possessed, received us with a gracious and dignified manner, and offered us the usual refreshment of tea, as though she had been accustomed to European society all her life. There was neither gaucherie on the one hand, nor effrontery or undue familiarity on the other, in the manner she adopted when conversing at any time with the various members of our party. In person she was delicate-looking, by no means devoid of good looks, and perhaps form\n\n26\n\nchapter 1 thirty-six to forty years of age. Firm and intelligent, and possessed of excellent business capacity. . . .94\n\nWithin both Lan Na and Siam, many recognized Thipkraisorn’s intelligence and political acumen. In Siam, King Chulalongkorn’s circle favored Thipkraisorn, who was more receptive to the young king’s pro-Western stance, while another faction at court favored the second king, Uparat Chao Bunthawong.95 Some local observers saw Thipkraisorn as a check against Bunthawong, who missionary Daniel McGilvary called “ambitious and less-principled” than either Inthanon or Thipkraisorn.96 Bunthawong’s influence, however, ended at the same time as Kawilorot’s reign. The very next day after King Kawilorot’s death, Bunthawong was found dead by Ubonwanna, who called the local missionary doctor to confirm his condition: The Princess wished to get my judgment whether he was really dead beyond all hope of resuscitation. But it required no skilled physician to answer that question. He had evidently died by a dose of opium administered by his own hands. . . . Whether it was intentional suicide . . . or simply designed to ease the troubles of the night, they could tell as well as I. . . .97 Ubonwanna was a powerful figure both politically and economically. As the second daughter of the prior king, she leveraged her timber-derived wealth to engage in a number of different industries, from overland caravan trade to textile weaving and liquor distillation. Her business interests brought her into contact with foreigners of many stripes: Burmese foresters, Yunnanese and Indian caravan traders, and Western explorers, surveyors, and diplomats. She was said to be fluent in English and well-versed in Western customs, and was particularly interested in spending time with Western visitors to Chiang Mai (including the local community of American missionaries). Several of those travelers, including A. H. Hildebrand, Holt Hallett, and Archibald Colquhoun, noted Ubonwanna’s friendliness and curiosity about their ideas, and she frequently invited them to dine and socialize at her home. Hallett describes how keen Ubonwanna was to discuss the possibility of a British railway connecting upper Burma with southern China, as she could see the immense mercantile benefit afforded by such a trade conduit.98 Ubonwanna’s personality and love life also made an impression on Hallett: This princess was no ordinary person, and her life was a romance. Highly intelligent, and a capital woman of business, a great trader, and the owner of large tracts of land, extensive teak-forests, and numerous elephants, serfs, and slaves, love was yet to her “the summer’s sun, nature gay adorning.” She\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n27\n\nwas very amorously inclined, and during many years had given the queen great anxiety and trouble in controlling her headstrong fancies. . . .99 But Ubonwanna’s greatest influence on Chiang Mai’s political landscape was in her capacity as the official royal spirit-medium. As Hallett noted: “As an instance of her power, Wilson [an American missionary] stated that when called in to consult the spirits after the late. . . . Second King [uparat] was struck down with sickness, she boldly told him that the spirits were displeased at his oppression of the people, and advised him at once to abolish certain vexatious taxes, particularly the monopoly of arrack, or rice-spirit.”100 In another description of the incident, it was Thipkraisorn—rather than the Second King—who was ill.101 In either case, the message was the same: that the (Chinese-held) monopoly on rice whisky offended the local spirits and should be revoked. Beyond causing offense to the spirits, however, more likely the real-world impacts of the liquor monopoly outweighed supernatural ones: it negatively affected Ubonwanna’s distillery business. Thus Ubonwanna’s spiritual connections provided her with an expedient means of influencing Chiang Mai politics. (It worked so well that the Siamese outlawed it in 1884.)102 Though Lan Na’s royal women had enjoyed the power to choose kings for generations, Thipkraisorn and Ubonwanna exercised an unparalleled level of status and power between them in Chiang Mai during the late nineteenth century.\n\nRumors and Realigning Allegiances Sometime between 1881 and 1882, the rumor began to circulate in Bangkok that Queen Victoria had offered to adopt Dara Rasami. The best Thai-language source states that “a British official from southern Burma approached King Inthawichyanon [of Chiang Mai] in 1881” to see how receptive he might be to an offer of adoption.103 Several Thai authors note that no records of such an offer exist in the Thai archive; but what about the British side? A focused search of the records of the British consuls at Bangkok and Chiang Mai, as well as Rangoon (Burma), the India Office at Calcutta, and the Foreign Office in London (including the Political and Secret records housed at the British Library) reveals that Dara Rasami’s existence registered only faintly on the consciousness of British diplomatic officers in Siam. One of the few mentions of her found in the British consular records of the period indicates, if anything, some disdain on the part of the British consular officials toward her. In an 1888 letter from the British consulate in Chiang Mai to the consul at Bangkok:\n\n28\n\nchapter 1 The marriage of the daughter of the Chief of Chiengmai with the King [of Siam], about two years ago, was another important step [in the extension of Siamese control into the region], for she is, as you know, the only true heiress-apparent of Chiengmai—though it may be said that here, even more than in Siam, the succession is by no means necessarily by descent. Still, the child, if any, of the Princess might justly be looked upon as the rightful future ruler of Chiengmai; but I am told that there is thought to be little chance of any issue. . . .104\n\nNonetheless, the adoption rumor persists. Nearly every Thai-language biography of Dara Rasami mentions it, as do local Chiang Mai sources (such as the Dara Phirom Palace Museum, located in Mae Rim). If the British never considered making such an offer, where did the rumor come from? Rather than undermining its significance, the fact of the rumor’s untruth makes it even more historically interesting, as it betrays other actors and motives. Why would such a rumor have been invented, and whose interests did it serve? The answer provides fresh insight into the imperialist pressures felt by both Lan Na and Siam in the late nineteenth century. Though there is little data to support a definitive answer, several Thai accounts credit Dara Rasami herself as the source of the rumor.105 As Dara Rasami was only eight or nine years old when the adoption rumor began to circulate, it is doubtful that she herself originated the story. However, there were others in Chiang Mai more than capable of such an invention. British traveler Lowndes notes in 1871 that King Inthanon had “…asked about the Queen, the war, and my own personal affairs” during his journey to Chiang Mai, illustrating that the Chiang Mai nobility were informed about global events and politics.106 Given Thipkraisorn and Inthanon’s numerous contacts with Western travelers and missionaries over the prior decade, such cosmopolitan awareness is not surprising.107 Most likely Dara Rasami’s parents themselves invented the rumor as a means of improving their political currency with the Siamese. Even if this was not their strategy, it nonetheless succeeded in prompting Bangkok to upgrade the status of Chiang Mai’s rulership. Soon after the rumor reached royal ears in Bangkok in 1882, King Chulalongkorn ordered his new commissioner to Chiang Mai, Chao Phraya Phichit Prichagon,108 to act as his emissary to Dara Rasami’s parents, bringing a gift of diamond earrings and a matching bracelet along with a letter requesting Dara’s hand in marriage.109 Phichit Prichagon then stayed in Chiang Mai to participate in the ceremonial cutting of Dara’s topknot and the festivities that followed it.110 Although this\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n29\n\nceremony—which marked a child’s entry to adolescence—was commonplace among Siamese noble families, it was not usual practice in Lan Na; in fact, it had never been done before, nor again since. The lavish celebrations, like the ceremony itself, were supervised by Siamese administrator Phraya Racha Samparakorn, and the accompanying events were held in “both Lan Na and southern [Siamese] style.”111 That Dara’s parents arranged the event in concert with local Siamese officials indicates that the dual nature of the event was quite intentional. And while it was customary to give gifts of gold, silver, and rings on the occasion of a topknot-cutting, the meaning of Chulalongkorn’s gift of earrings clearly expressed matrimonial intention.112 Such a marital offer was highly unusual, as the accepted practice among Siamese noble families was to gift female relatives to the king as consorts. According to Thai sources, this is the only instance in which King Chulalongkorn asked a family to send a woman to serve as his consort in the palace.113 It was so unusual, in fact, that Chulalongkorn made the Chiang Mai royal family promise to “[keep] this a private matter,” rather than offend Siamese noble families whose daughters were not so ardently pursued.114 That may not have been the only reason Chulalongkorn wanted to keep the matter quiet. The Siamese had their own agenda for pursuing such a marital arrangement. In late 1883, he wrote to Samparakorn that You must also understand the intentions of Bangkok and say we believe Muang Chiang Mai continues to be a tributary state and not part of our territory. It will still be a tributary state as long as we don’t think to eliminate its royalty. But we wish to hold real power . . . in short, to make it like a machine that we can control or guide forward or back as we please. . . . However, it is necessary to use intelligence more than force; we must not make them feel oppressed, and must point out the advantages of the current situation as the basis.115 Thus what the Lan Na rulers may have seen as a victory in terms of heightening their status and sovereignty with the Siamese—and an honor for their native princess—was to Bangkok merely another step in the process of making Lan Na part of the Siamese machine. In the words of Phraya Songsuradet, commissioner of the Lao Chiang monthon from 1893 to 1899, Siam’s bestowal of titles and offices was merely “a trick to seduce the Lao,” to convince the local rulers to appoint Siamese officials to do the actual work of governing their territories.116 Little did Lan Na’s nobility know of the true nature of the bargain they made in that moment.\n\n30\n\nchapter 1\n\nA Cross-Cultural Education In 1884, a scant year after the marital alliance between young Dara Rasami and the Siamese king was brokered, Queen Thipkraisorn died—leaving King Inthanon grief-stricken and adrift. According to a Siamese administrator reporting to Bangkok at that time, Inthanon “is neither conscious nor unconscious. He sprinkled water [to purify] his wife[‘s body], but did not bring his child [i.e., Dara Rasami]. He goes out to hide away in the trees of the garden and won’t speak to anyone. All matters of state must be canceled or stopped. I don’t know if anything can be done. . . .”117 Although Inthanon retained his title as Chao Luang and de facto ruler of Chiang Mai, another member of the ruling council, Chao Rachabutr, had to step in to handle the day-to-day duties of rule, and Dara Rasami was sent to live with her aunt Ubonwanna.118 Though Inthanon’s grief may have played a role in this decision, it was in fact common practice in Lan Na for a deceased woman’s children to be taken in by her sister’s family (particularly since husbands engaged in trade or warfare could be absent for long periods of time). Thus young Dara Rasami spent the critical two-year period between Thipkraisorn’s death in 1884 and Dara’s departure for Bangkok at the end of 1886 in Ubonwanna’s care. Ubonwanna’s household was very different from the royal home where Dara had been raised. While Thipkraisorn was widely acknowledged to be the true power behind the throne, her younger sister was equally as powerful, but in the realm of commerce. Besides the substantial timber tracts accorded her as a member of Chiang Mai’s royal family, Ubonwanna was also invested in bullock caravans, distilleries, and the textile trade. Where Thipkraisorn was concerned with raising Lan Na’s status in the eyes of Siam, Ubonwanna was more interested in how Chiang Mai could potentially benefit from strengthening its links with the wider world—especially via the Burma-Yunnan railway proposed by Britons like Holt Hallett. Nonetheless, Ubonwanna took her responsibility for raising her niece seriously, and young Dara’s education continued apace in Ubonwanna’s household. Though she was merely eleven years old, Dara “was trained in politics, and then the ways of the royal court in Bangkok.”119 Given that “Ubonwanna secretly opposed the Siamese assimilation of power” in Chiang Mai, no doubt Dara’s political education was informed by her aunt’s suspicion of the Siamese as well. Under Ubonwanna’s care, Dara was instructed in the languages and customs of both Siam and Lan Na, and perhaps English as well, as Ubonwanna had herself learned it from the local American missionaries.120\n\nIntroducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n31\n\nThough Dara would have been taught to weave by her mother, she had ample opportunities to learn more at Ubonwanna’s house, where dozens of enslaved women wove textiles for commercial trade. To secure Dara’s future in the Siamese palace, Ubonwanna made sure that Thipkraisorn’s (substantial) timber-leasing income was inherited by her daughter. Additionally, Ubonwanna also arranged for part of her own timber income to go directly to Dara Rasami to maintain the honor of Lan Na’s royal family in Bangkok.121 Despite the early death of Dara’s mother, Thipkraisorn, her aunt Ubonwanna ensured that her preparation for life as a future political princess was complete. The marital alliance between Lan Na and Siam reflected the increasing pressures on Siam’s peripheral territories being felt by Chulalongkorn in the 1880s and the elaboration of the prior king’s policy of appeasement into an assimilationist stance toward the Lan Na rulership. Dara Rasami’s arrival in the palace, however, was no tidy happily ever after. Over the next twenty years of her career as a royal consort, the struggle between the kingdoms continued to play out in the Inner Palace, rendering Dara Rasami both a hostage and diplomat in Siamese palace politics.\n\nCh a pter 2\n\nDara Rasami’s Career in the Siamese Royal Palace\n\nD\n\nara Rasami’s arrival in the palace marks the beginning of her career as a royal consort at the same time that Siam’s King Chulalongkorn was implementing structural changes to the Siamese state that would eventually end palace women’s political relevance. While Dara Rasami’s parents were aware of Chulalongkorn’s “modern” mindset, they did not suspect he had already begun reshaping Siam into a form fundamentally different from their understanding of how kingdoms had traditionally worked in mainland Southeast Asia. As discussed in the previous chapter, Chulalongkorn and the elites who served as his cabinet were keenly aware of European powers’ efforts to expand their colonial footprints in Southeast Asia. In a bid to make Siam appear too civilized for Europeans to colonize, Siamese elites embarked on a program of self-modernization that depended largely on emulating key colonial practices—a mode described as “crypto-colonialism.” This term, coined by anthropologist Michael Herzfeld, denotes the imposition of colonial practices and structures by states that were never formally colonized by a European power—a practice sometimes referred to in the Siamese context as semi-colonialism or self-colonization.1 In the Siamese case, crypto-colonial practices were exercised over subjects by the elites themselves, led by King Chulalongkorn. Not long after ascending the throne in 1868, young Chulalongkorn traveled to various colonial states in the region to observe their administrative practices and “was deeply impressed with what Europeans had done” in Singapore, Java, and India.2 On his return to Bangkok, he set about making changes intended to bring Siam more in line with these states, so as to demonstrate Siam’s fitness for membership among the ranks of civilized modern states. Britain in particular served as Siam’s ideal model of a modern monarchy: Chulalongkorn created a royal privy council on the British model; he sent his sons to be educated in England; and he also took the unprecedented step of appointing his successor, anointing his eldest son Vajirunhit Crown Prince (an event which coincides with Dara Rasami’s entry to the palace as a consort). He 32\n\nDara Rasami’s Career in the Siamese Royal Palace\n\n33\n\nalso abolished the requirement for commoners to prostrate themselves before royalty, expanding on his father Mongkut’s efforts to render the monarch more accessible to the common people.3 Nonetheless, Chulalongkorn embraced royal polygyny despite his keen awareness of Western disapproval of the practice. Indeed, his reign became the high era of Siam’s palace women: the population of royal consorts reached its zenith of 153 women. Hence Dara’s career provides both a window into the rarefied world of Siam’s palace culture and a convenient frame for viewing the historical changes underway that ultimately brought that culture to an end.\n\nDara’s Arrival in Bangkok In late 1885, thirteen-year-old Dara Rasami stepped aboard a houseboat to accompany her father, Intawichyanon, several hundred miles downriver on one of his semiannual visits to Bangkok. This journey’s purpose, however, was unique: to present Dara Rasami for service as a consort to King Chulalongkorn in the Inner Palace. The trip was timed to coincide with the events celebrating the appointment of Chulalongkorn’s son, Vajirunhit, to the rank of Crown Prince in January 1886. Dara Rasami’s father would play a special role in these events— and receive a royal promotion to boot. Because the river route offered far quicker and more convenient transport in those days than overland travel, a caravan of boats was laden with the food and supplies needed for the journey. For several weeks, Chiang Mai’s royal entourage traveled down the Ping and Chao Phraya rivers, disembarking at waterfalls and rapids while the boats were portaged. It took three weeks traveling down the Ping River for Dara and her father to reach central Siam, where their arrival was received with great fanfare.4 The floating convoy of houseboats was met by King Chulalongkorn himself at Bang Pa-In palace, located about forty miles upstream from Bangkok.5 There Dara Rasami underwent a tham khwan (spirit-calling) ceremony, after which she was fêted with a grand feast attended by a number of the Chakri nobility. Afterward, Dara and her attendants, Khai Kaew and Bua Rawaan, returned to their boat and were guided the rest of the way down the river to Bangkok by Siamese officials. After docking at the pier next to the Royal Palace, the young princess was conducted “in an honorable manner” to the interior of the Royal Palace, which had been decorated to be “glittering and dazzling to the eye.”6 Having safely delivered Dara Rasami to Bangkok, her father took a prominent position in the procession of royals celebrating Vajirunhit’s elevation to Crown\n\n34\n\nchapter 2\n\nPrince. Intawichyanon rode in seventeenth place among the highest members of Siamese high royalty, the king’s own brothers and sisters, in the royal cavalcade through Bangkok; he was also allowed to participate in the water blessing ceremony for the Crown Prince.7 Noteworthy here is that Intawichyanon was the only ruler of a Siamese prathet sarat (tributary kingdom) to participate in these events. Chulalongkorn also presented King Intawichyanon with the medal of the Order of Chula Chom Klao (the Siamese equivalent of a knighthood, established by and named after Chulalongkorn himself); he was also the only ruler of any of Siam’s tributary kingdoms to receive this honor during Chulalongkorn’s reign.8 It appears that Intawichyanon and Thipkraisorn’s gambit—circulating rumors of Queen Victoria’s desire to adopt Dara Rasami—had succeeded, greatly benefitting the Chiang Mai royal family. Whether the plan ultimately improved the fortunes of their subjects (or the future sovereignty of Lan Na), however, is highly doubtful.9 Intawichyanon’s promotion and new name accorded him an even higher level of social status back home and helped raise the status of the rest of Chiang Mai’s nobility as well: they were allowed to use the surname na Chiang Mai (of the city of Chiang Mai) in parallel to Siam’s royal elites who used the surname na Ayutthaya. At the same time, however, Chiang Mai’s sovereignty was fatally undermined by Bangkok’s “blessing.” After the ratification of the second Chiang Mai treaty in 1883, dozens of Siamese officials were stationed in Chiang Mai under its provisions, making the international court a permanent fixture (and a model for the nascent Siamese court system). The treaty also established a local police force to keep law and order and prevent banditry. At the same time, a new system of taxation was put in place, shifting the collection of taxes to (mostly Chinese) collectors who preferred cash over goods—a move that greatly burdened many cash-poor small landholders and traders, while putting more money in the pockets of Chiang Mai’s nobles. These measures would lead to conflict in the coming decades, widening the gap between local nobles and their people—and making it impossible for our young princess to return home again.\n\nThe World of the Siamese Inner Palace Young Dara Rasami must have wondered about the new world to which she was traveling. What was Bangkok like compared to her hometown, the capital city of Chiang Mai? Would she be able to have her favorite foods and music, or other familiar things from home? Dara Rasami’s parents, who had visited the Royal Palace in Bangkok many times, had likely described to her their impressions of\n\nDara Rasami’s Career in the Siamese Royal Palace\n\n35\n\nwhat they had seen there, although Dara herself had never been there before. To prepare her for her entry to the Siamese palace, Dara Rasami had undergone several years’ training in the Thai language and the customs of the Siamese royal court. But it would be very different to live there under the watchful eyes of the Siamese palace folk, without the protection of her parents—or aunt—to fall back on. One imagines a nervously excited Dara Rasami and her attendants stealing glimpses of the busy streets of Bangkok from within the curtained palanquins carrying them from the riverside to inside the high walls of the Royal Palace. Once they entered the women’s quarters there, it would likely be their last sight of the outside world for a long time. The Inner Palace, as it was known, was a space within the space of the Royal Palace: a world run by women, complete with its own walls, guards, and administrators. Although Dara Rasami was undoubtedly the last political princess of her kind to serve here, she was hardly the first. The Inner Palace had a long history all its own that provides an intimate window into Siam’s political development over the course of the nineteenth century—the era of European imperialism.\n\nA Brief History of Political Consorts Polygyny had in fact been practiced by Southeast Asian monarchs long before the Ratanakosin (or Bangkok) era began, and it conveys the central importance of humanpower in the chronically underpopulated region.10 Like the monarchs of Lan Na discussed in the last chapter, Siamese kings also practiced polygyny throughout the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya eras. But in many ways, Bangkok itself was very new. After the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1767 reduced the Siamese capital to a smoldering ruin, Siam’s elite class, its literature and high culture were largely destroyed. In the years immediately following, General Taksin gathered the remaining Siamese nobility to establish a new seat at Thonburi. When the Chakri clan took the throne in 1782, they moved their capital across the Chao Phraya River, and a new palace was built on Ratanakosin Island, now considered the heart of “old” Bangkok. Siamese palace life, in other words, essentially restarted in the 1780s, when the Siamese built their new capital at Bangkok. The newly established Chakri rulers were intensely concerned with both rebuilding their elite culture and preserving the security of their new capital. (As we discussed in the last chapter, these are the same security concerns that prompted the Siamese to assist Lan Na rulers in ousting the Burmese from their territories as well.) Regional security concerns shaped both the population of the\n\n36\n\nchapter 2\n\nInner Palace and the fledgling Chakri dynasty’s external political practices in the early Bangkok era. Because the control of humanpower (or the lack thereof) had been a major factor in the loss of Ayutthaya, the Chakri nobility was anxious to consolidate political loyalties in the region. This they proceeded to do in a number of ways.11 First, the Chakri court centralized its administrative control over these new provincial administrators, creating separate chief ministers to oversee the provinces: the Mahat Thai minister supervising those in the north and the Kalahom supervising the southern provinces.12 Second, marital alliances were arranged with daughters of the noble families ruling provincial capitals around Siam’s peripheries. At the same time, however, Siam’s need for external territorial security was counterbalanced by an intimately internal one: that of rebuilding the elite class and the institution of the palace itself. These dual concerns shaped the ethnic makeup of the women who served as royal consorts in the early Bangkok era. From the inception of the new capital, the practice of marital alliance was central to the Chakri dynasty’s program of reestablishing ties with neighboring polities. The first Chakri monarch, Phra Phutta Yotfa (r. 1782–1809), had a total of seventeen consorts: four were the daughters of provincial rulers, and two more came from the prathet sarat of Lan Na and Lan Xang (now Laos). Another seven women were the daughters of various noble families based in Bangkok; one is described as the daughter of “wealthy Chinese,” while the origins of the last three were not recorded.13 In the wake of the destruction of the court at Ayutthaya, there were few women of royal blood available to serve as consorts during the early Bangkok era; the nearest available candidate was the granddaughter of an Ayutthayan consort. But what is most notable about the population of palace women in this period is the preponderance of women who came from beyond Bangkok: fully 35 percent of the women serving in the Inner Palace during this reign came from distant provincial or tributary regions. Rather than send male Siamese administrators out to govern the peripheries, women circulated from the peripheries into the center to ensure the loyalties of their home regions. These circulations highlight the centrality of bodies (or biopower, á la Foucault) to the traditional structure of Siamese political power, the inextricability of local elite women’s bodies to rebuilding the Siamese kingdom, and the necessity of anchoring it at its center, Bangkok.14 As the new dynasty found its footing, however, the makeup of the Inner Palace gradually shifted.
