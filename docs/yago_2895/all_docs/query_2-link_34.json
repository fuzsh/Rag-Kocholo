        "text": "Notes\n\nChapter 1. Introducing Lan Na, Siam, and the Inland Constellation\n\n1. Born in 1838, Duleep Singh was crowned the ruler of the Punjab at the age of five and taken from his mother to be raised by British missionaries at age ten, after which he converted to Christianity. He was brought to London in 1854 bearing the Koh-I-Noor diamond and Golden Throne as gifts for Queen Victoria. You can learn more about him and his descendants here: http://www.duleepsingh.com/Biography.\n\n2. Lysa, “Palace Women at the Margins of Social Change,” 310–24.\n\n3. Prince Damrong, one of King Chulalongkorn’s many half brothers, maintained a total of eleven wives and consorts in his household, ultimately producing thirty-three children. See Finestone, ARoyalAlbum, particularly chapter 12 on Damrong’s descendants, who bear the surname “Diskul.”\n\n4.

Anna went to great lengths to obscure the facts of her birth, which occurred in India, not—as she claimed—in England; while she was employed by King Mongkut to tutor his children part-time in the English language, she was never resident inside the palace as a governess would have been. In fact, Anna also socialized mainly with American residents of Bangkok rather than Britons, as they would have found the flaws in her claims as to her English birthplace and schooling in short order.\n\n7. See Grewal, HomeandHarem.\n\n8. The well-known musical The King and I was adapted from Margaret Landon’s 1944 Anna and the King of Siam, which was in turn a novelization of Leonowens’s English Governess text. Both the musical and all film versions have been banned in Thailand, including the 2000 film version starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat.\n\n9. While Hong Lysa and Tamara Loos have fruitfully mined the documents on palace judicial cases, there is undoubtedly enough information in the archival files on illness and death among palace women of the Fifth Reign to provide a scholar of medical history enough material for a fascinating thesis or book. See National Archives of Thailand, Bangkok (NAT) R.5, Krasuang Wang, R.5 W.99, Bettalet.\n\n10. Sulak, SamphatMomChaoJongjitrathanomDiskul.\n\n11. See Thongchai, SiamMapped.\n\n12. I borrow this term from Thongchai’s 2000 article, “The Others Within.”\n\n13. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s concept of “strategic essentialism” first appeared in her 1985 essay “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography.”\n\n14. Current King Vajiralongkorn (r. 2018–) appointed the first royal consort in nearly a century—former nurse and bodyguard Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, age thirty-four—in August 2019. Though she was stripped of the rank just three months later on grounds of “misbehavior and disloyalty,” she was reinstated in August 2020. For more, see https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7313849/Thai-king-anoints-army-nurse-mistress-official-concubine-ceremony-wife.html, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/king-maha-vajiralongkorn-of-thailand-strips-his-consort-of-royal-titles-disloyalty-today-2019-10-21/, and https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53994198.\n\n15. Sarassawadee, History of Lan Na.\n\n16. Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah elaborates on the concept of the “galactic polity,” in which the traditional Southeast Asian city-state model, called a mandala, focuses on the power of the ruler as it radiates from the capital at its center, rather than the state’s outermost boundaries (which were often loosely defined and could even overlap with those of neighboring mandala states). See Tambiah, WorldConquerorandWorldRenouncer.\n\n17. I will follow Tambiah’s usage of the term muang, which “refers to centered or center-oriented space (as opposed to bounded space) and typically stands for a capital or town or settlement with the surrounding territory over which it exercised jurisdiction” (WorldConquerorandWorldRenouncer, 112).\n\n18. At the same time, while Lan Na made up part of the Inland Constellation, it should not be read as identical to it. The Inland Constellation I propose has included at various times Lan Na, Lan Xang, the Shan States, and parts of Sipsòng Panna in southern China.\n\n19. These rivers include the Nan, Yom, Wang, and Ping rivers, which provide a continuous waterway between Chiang Mai and Bangkok (during the rainy season). The Ping River was used by the Chiang Mai nobles (and Dara Rasami) in their semiannual travels between Chiang Mai and Bangkok.\n\n20. See also Bowie, “Unraveling the Myth of the Subsistence Economy,” 797–823.\n\n21. This route was known as senthang baicha (the way of tea). See Foon Ming, Grabowsky, and Renoo, Chronicle of Sipsòng Panna, 34; see also Freeman and Ahmed, Tea Horse Road.\n\n22. Forbes and Henley, The Haw: Traders of the Golden Triangle.\n\n23. Chinese chronicles even referred to Lan Na as the “land of the sticky-rice eaters.” See Foon Ming, Grabowsky, and Renoo, Chronicle of Sipsòng Panna; and Ratana, “Social Strategies in Creating Roles for Women in Lan Na and Lan Sang.” See also the excellent Sithu, Zinme Yazawin—a chronicle that details the role of cosmology in the siting of several ancient cities in the region.\n\n24. Reid, Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce.\n\n25. This pattern of out-marriage of royal sons to the daughters of local nobles is consistent with Lan Na’s cultural pattern of matrilocality, and would be utilized later by Lan Na rulers as well (which will be seen later in this chapter). Also see Wijeyewardene, “Northern Thai Succession,” 285–92.\n\n26. Lan Na maintained this nickname until it was colonized by the Burmese in the sixteenth century, after which it became known as the “land of 800 stockades.” See Foon Ming and Grabowsky (in collaboration with Aroonrut), LanNainChineseHistoriography, 102.\n\n27. Elements of Burmese culture that are still visible in Lan Na’s culture today include the use of luntaya acheik textiles in local dress; the wearing of a flower behind one ear in both men’s and women’s hairstyles; foodways including mieng, curry, and certain noodle dishes such as khao soi; and the orthography of local language (which shifted from more rectangular characters to more circular ones following the arrival of the Burmese).\n\n28. Grabowsky notes that Prince Damrong’s Our Wars with the Burmese (Bangkok, Thailand: White Lotus, 1977) ignores Kawila’s role in the victories, instead crediting Phraya Chakri’s troops and leadership. Thus the reestablishment of Lan Na was co-opted to become part of the founding narrative of the Siamese nation-state. See Grabowsky, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” 56.\n\n29. From the ThamnanSiphaRachawong (ChronicleoftheFifteenKingdoms), as cited in and translated by Grabowsky, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns.”\n\n30. See Kraisri, “Put Vegetables Into Baskets, and People Into Towns.”\n\n31. Grabowsky, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” 59.\n\n32. See Sarassawadee, HistoryofLanNa, and Grabowksy, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” for slightly different periodizations of these waves.\n\n33. Sarassawadee, HistoryofLanNa, 133.\n\n34. See Grabowsky, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns.”\n\n35. Sipsòng Panna’s lowland peoples were ethnically Tai Lüe. See Foon Ming, Grabowsky, and Renoo, Chronicle of Sipsòng Panna.\n\n36. Grabowksy, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” 74.\n\n37. Grabowksy, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” 74.\n\n38. Grabowksy, “Forced Resettlement Campaigns,” 76.\n\n39. The language of the Yuan ruling elite was shared by the multiethnic khon muang. Today it is known by local residents as phasaa muang (muang language) or kham muang (muang words), and it is still widely spoken, although central Thai has been the official language in the region since the 1930s.\n\n40. See Grabowsky and Turton, TheGoldandSilverRoadofTradeandFriendship, 5.\n\n41. See Maha Sila Viravong’s History of Laos (New York: Paragon Book Reprint Corp., 1964) for a persuasive argument that it was the Siamese preoccupation with a possible British intervention that encouraged Chao Anou to make his attempt; Mayuri and Pheuiphanh argue that there was never a Chao Anou rebellion, but only a “war between Bangkok and the Lao.” More recently, Grant Evans cast the episode as part of an ongoing “competition for resources in the Mekong basin” between Siam, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam in his AShortHistoryofLaos. See Mayuri and Pheuiphanh’s ChaoAnou (1767–1829): PasasonLaolaeAsiaAkhane, Vientiane, [n.p.]: 2010; and PathstoConflagration: FiftyYearsofDiplomacyandWarfareinLaos, Thailand, andVietnam, 1778-1828, Ithaca, NY: Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University, 1998.\n\n42. Evans,AShortHistoryofLaos, 28–29.\n\n43. According to Sarassawadee, History of Lan Na, even though Chiang Mai had supplied troops to the Siamese to fight against Chao Anou, there were still nobles in eastern Lan Na who sympathized with the Lao ruler.\n\n44. Sarassawadee, History of Lan Na, 8. The earliest letter, arriving in March of 1825, could have come from either the ailing Khamfan or his successor, Phuttawong, who was known for his more conciliatory attitude toward Ava (see Brailey, “The Origins of the Siamese Forward Movement”).\n\n45.

According to Sarassawadee, the conflict arose because the rajabut’s troops reached the city first and attacked immediately in a bid for glory; when this attempt failed, the uparat deliberately delayed sending reinforcements due to his antagonism toward the rajabut. Lan Na’s King Mahotraprathet even complained to Bangkok about the situation, which led to King Mongkut’s 1856 participation in the selection of the next Lan Na king—ostensibly to prevent such problems in the future.

Ratanaporn, “Political, Social, and Economic Changes,” 182.\n\n64. Ratanaporn explains that the British Indian government had “long considered Thailand as part of its sphere of interest particularly since problems there mostly concerned British subjects. [And since] they also frequently disagreed with [Bangkok consul] Knox’s actions... the Calcutta officials responded delightedly” to the opportunity to refer unresolved or contested legal cases from Chiang Mai to Burma.

Ratana Pakdeekul notes, “It is remarkable that Tai peoples who had a culture of consuming glutinous rice (Sipsòng Panna, Chiang Tung, Chiang Rung, Lan Na, and Lan Sang) all shared the characteristic of being matriarchal societies.” Ratana, “Social Strategies in Creating Roles for Women,” 43.\n\n81.

Interestingly, under the Chao Chet Ton dynasty of Lan Na, there were no queens. From that perspective, Thipkraisorn—given her choice of a “weak” spouse to take the Chiang Mai throne—was the nearest example.\n\n84. Brailey, “The Origins of the Siamese Forward Movement,” 168.\n\n85. Inthanon had a total of eleven children by six women: 1. Chao Noi Mahawan, born to a “saw” musician [name unrecorded]; 2. Chao Noi Tone, son by Chao Duang Thep na Lampang; 3. Chao Kaew Praba Muang, son by Chao Thep na Lampang; 4. Chao Noi Khattiyawong (who later became Chao Rachabut and Chao Rachawong of Chiang Mai), son by Mom Khab Kham; 5.

After Inthawichyanon’s reign, there were only two more local rulers of the Chiang Mai royal line, but the Siamese greatly reduced their political status from kings—chao chiwit, or lords of life, with a salary of 80,000 rupees per year—to the rank of governors, who then ruled alongside the Siamese provincial administrator (at the reduced salary of 30,000 rupees per year; see Sarassawadee, History of Lan Na, 198).\n\n10.

The chief minister of the south was known as the samuha kalahom, while the chief minister of the northern region was the samuha nayok.\n\n13. See Sara, “Satri nai Rachasamnak Siam,” 23.\n\n14. In contrast, Siamese administrators sent to govern provinces at the kingdom’s peripheries were forbidden to marry the daughters of provincial noble families, lest they align together against the Siamese king. See the 1873 PhraRachaBanyaSamrapKhaluangchamrakhwanhuamueang (Act of Provincial Commissioner Justice).\n\n15. Sara, “Satri nai Rachasamnak Siam,” 23.\n\n16. With the victory of the British in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1825, Siam recognized the decreased military might of its former rival, Burma, as Western imperialism began to impinge on Siam’s boundaries. See Ni, Burma’sStruggleAgainstBritishImperialism and Furnivall’s TheFashioningofLeviathan for excellent accounts of British involvement in Burma in the nineteenth century.\n\n17. Finestone, ARoyalAlbum, 18–40. Although Mongkut had 56 consorts during his reign, he complained that he was not gifted as many women as the uparat (second king), who was perceived as younger and more virile. See Seni and Kukrit, Mongkut, 213.\n\n18. Sara, “Satri nai Rachasamnak Siam,” 54.\n\n19. Mongkut’s son by Queen Thepsirin was Chulalongkorn, who succeeded the throne to become Rama V. Mongkut’s three daughters by Chao Chom Manda Phiyama Wadi were Saovabha Phongsri, Savang Vadhana, and Sunanta Kumarirat, who were Chulalongkorn’s three highest-status queens.\n\n20. Mongkut had two daughters with Princess Numan of Vientiane, Laos; however, neither became a consort of the next king (Chulalongkorn). See Finestone, The Royal Family of Thailand.\n\n21. Finestone, ARoyalAlbum, 64–73.\n\n22. Naengnoi and Freeman, Palaces of Bangkok. As Naengnoi notes, every prior Chakri king had built his own prasat in the palace, tearing down the structures of his predecessor and rearranging the layout of palace grounds to suit his own tastes. After Chulalongkorn relocated his palace to the Dusit district in 1902, subsequent Thai kings have also continued to build their residences outside the old Royal Palace grounds. The women’s quarters of the old Inner Palace fell into disrepair until the late 1950s, when Rama IX renovated several buildings, razing some that were beyond hope.\n\n23. Naengnoi and Freeman, PalacesofBangkok, 100.\n\n24. The public/private divide as understood in Western cultures, however, has limited utility for understanding these spaces. See Rosaldo, Lamphere, and Bamberger, Woman, Culture, andSociety.\n\n25. She was not, however, free to marry again. See Wales, Siamese State Ceremonies.\n\n26.

These three sisters were the daughters of the prior king, Mongkut, and consort-mother Piam; Chulalongkorn was Mongkut’s son by Queen Thepsirin. Thus Chulalongkorn’s highest-ranking queens were actually his half sisters.\n\n30 Damrong Rajanubhab (1862–1943), one of King Chulalongkorn’s many younger half brothers, was also one of his talented and most trusted ministers, heading up the Ministry of Education and the Mahat Thai (Ministry of the Interior, 1884–1915) over the course of his long career.\n\n31.

In a letter to Ernest Satow, the British consul to Siam, American missionary Dr. Cheek claims Ubonwanna died by poisoning in his note of February 11, 1886 (Public Records Office File 30/33/17/14), and Volker Grabowsky notes that the name Ubonwanna does not appear again after 1886 in either Siamese or Western documents of the time (Wongsak, ed., KhattiyaniSriLanna, 269). On that date, Dara Rasami and her father were in Bangkok presenting Dara to the king as a consort.\n\n38. See Chunlada, Loh Wang, 149–50, and Nattakhan’s chapter on Dara Rasami’s life, “Phra Rachaya Chao Dara Rasami,” in Wongsak, Khattiyani Sri Lanna, 129.

Sakdi na, as defined by David Wyatt in his Thailand: AShortHistory, is a system of law created under Sukhothai’s King Boromma Trailokanat (1448–88), which “delineated an enormously complex hierarchical society in which the place and position of every individual was carefully specified. The laws assigned to everyone a number of units of sakdi na, literally ‘field power.’ Although at first this may have at least symbolically represented actual measured rice fields, . . . by the fifteenth century it did not carry this meaning, for even Buddhist monks, housewives, slaves, and Chinese merchants were assigned sakdi na. Ordinary peasant freemen were given a sakdi na of 25, slaves were ranked five, craftsmen employed in government service 50, and petty officials, from 50 to 400. . . . In the exhaustive laws of [this era], which read like a directory of the entire society, every possible position and status is ranked and assigned a designation of sakdi na, thus specifying everyone’s relative position.” Wyatt, Thailand: AShortHistory, 73.\n\n47. A noblewoman could be promoted even after her death; thus many other high-ranking women, both living and dead, were promoted again by later kings (as Queen Saovabha was by her son, Rama VI, King Vajiravudh). See Finestone’s 1989 and 2000 genealogies (TheRoyalFamilyofThailand and ARoyalAlbum, respectively), which track many of these promotions.\n\n48. During Chulalongkorn’s reign, the keeper of the royal wardrobe was Chao Chom Manda Waat, and Chao Chom Manda Hem (a close friend of Dara Rasami) was the keeper of royal perfumes.

Though fictional, Phloi’s career trajectory reflects the real-life opportunities for social advancement, which opened to lower-status women of the Inner Palace. In Kukrit’s story, Phloi progresses from the daughter of a wealthy commoner to junior lady-in-waiting in the Inner Palace, to wife of a former royal page who becomes a prominent member of the king’s staff. This progression reflects the real-life opportunities for social advancement that palace service opened to lower-status women.\n\n51. Phonsiri, “Nang Nai,” 59.\n\n52. Phonsiri, “Nang Nai,” 59.\n\n53.

Apparently, the girls—aged fourteen—were considered too young to be accepted to the English medical program to which they had been sent, and they eventually returned to Siam empty-handed (Smith, A Physician at the Court of Siam). However, Queen Saovabha founded her own school for midwifery in Bangkok in 1897. See Chula, 230.\n\n58. Saengdao, PhraPrawathi, 80.\n\n59. While Dara Rasami’s parents had submitted her to the Siamese custom of topknot-cutting as a requirement for her engagement to King Chulalongkorn, the custom of cutting a child’s topknot was otherwise not practiced in Lan Na. It is mentioned several times in various biographies of Dara Rasami that she was unique among Lan Na royalty for having undergone the ceremony.\n\n60. Saengdao, PhraPrawathi, 79.\n\n61.

Anna Leonowens depicted the abuse of palace slaves by royal women in her writings about palace life. Though the veracity of her account is questionable, a palace slave suffering abuse would have found it difficult to complain or find a new master, as doing so would put have been politically risky to the new owner. Hong Lysa details one such case, that of Khun Wad, the director of the Inner Palace, in “Of Consorts and Harlots in Thai Popular History,” 333–53. According to Lysa, Wad “had the slave chained and whipped for over six months, until the woman died.” Though Wad and two of her servants were found guilty of causing the woman’s death, King Chulalongkorn pardoned her on account of her high rank (340).\n\n88.

In nineteenth-century Siam, a child was considered to have come of age at the onset of puberty, at which time the tuft of hair coiled on the crown of the head was cut in a special ceremony, the topknot-cutting. This usually occurred around the age of eleven or twelve. Following their tonsure, boys of royal birth who had lived in the Inner Palace had to move out, either into the household of a relative (i.e., a princely uncle) or a household of their own outside the palace. According to H. G. Quaritch Wales, the tonsure of royal princes was carried out differently from those of noblemen and commoners. For more information, see Chapter X of Wales’s seminal work, SiameseStateCeremonies, 126–36.\n\n94.

Though he refused to allow her to leave at that time, King Chulalongkorn essentially deferred her request, saying it would be arranged. He gave Dara Rasami permission to adopt children from her relatives’ families and raise them in her residence. See Saengdao, PhraPrawathi, 84–87.\n\n100. Wongsak,KhattiyaniSriLanna, 126.\n\n101.

The 1893 Paknam Crisis, in which the French blockaded the mouth of the Chao Phraya River and sailed gunboats upstream to Bangkok, forced Siam to cede their Lao and Cambodian tributaries east of the Mekong River to the French. According to Wyatt, it also resulted in King Chulalongkorn experiencing a breakdown the following year. Wyatt, Thailand: AShortHistory, 204.\n\n104. Finestone, TheRoyalFamilyofThailand, 64.\n\n105. This could be due to Dara Rasami’s promotion to the rank of high queen (phra rajajaya) in 1909, which would mean that her children would automatically have been born with chao fa status. Finestone, TheRoyalFamilyofThailand, 64.\n\n106. The boy and girl—Kawilowong and Renuwanna, respectively—can be seen in photographs of Dara Rasami and her entourage at the royal residence at Bang Pa-In (Ayutthaya) circa 1906. Later accounts state that Dara Rasami requested that Laddakham allow her daughter to be raised by Dara Rasami as well. She complied, sending her daughter Chatrsudha to live with Dara in Chiang Mai in the 1920s following her retirement to Chiang Mai (Prani, PetchLanNa, 20).\n\n107. Prani, PetchLanNa, 20.\n\n108.

According to Hiram Woodward, the remains of Siamese kings Rama I–III and their chief consorts were interred in a columbarium inside the Ho Phrathat Montien, outside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in the Outer Palace. See Woodward, “Monastery, Palace, and City Plans,” 23–60.\n\n110. The other half of Dara Rasami’s (and her daughter’s) ashes are interred in a funerary monument in the royal cemetery she built in Chiang Mai, at Wat Suan Dok (Flower Garden Temple, which will be discussed further in the next chapter.\n\n111. Chao Chom Manda Thipkesorn entered service in the palace in 1883, in the household of ChaoKhunManda Phae (of the Bunnag family). Her son, Dilok Nopparat, was born the following year. (Prani, PetchLanNa, 130–31.)\n\n112. Thipkesorn was the daughter of Chao Suriya and Lady Bua Nam. Chao Suriya’s father was Chao Naan Mahawong, son of Phra Chao Kawila, the first ruler of Chiang Mai’s Chao Chet Ton dynasty. Thipkesorn’s mother, Lady Bua Nam, was the daughter of Chao Luang Sretthi Kham Fan, the third Chao Chet Ton king of Chiang Mai. Prani, Petch Lan Na.\n\n113.

In one of the only archival sources where she appears, Thipkesorn’s illnesses were treated with extensive medical care. See NAT R.5 Krasuang Wang M.R.5, W 99.\n\n116.

Chao “Noi” Sukkasem, however, was deeply unhappy having been forced to renounce his love for a young Burmese woman, Ma Mia, whom he met during his schooling in Moulmein. After battling heartbreak, depression, and alcohol for several years, he died prematurely at age thirty-three. (The Ma Mia story—and its relationship to Dara Rasami—will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.)\n\n119. Prani, Petch Lan Na, 23. During their marriage, Boworadet and Thipawaan had maintained an interest in agriculture; following their divorce, Thipawaan launched her own new agricultural venture, becoming the first to cultivate Virginia tobacco in the region. Thipawaan remained close to Dara Rasami and prominent in Chiang Mai’s cultural life; in addition to being promoted by Rama VI, she was also instrumental in arranging the traditional Lan Na-style performances for the visit of Rama VII in 1926. See Chiang Mai University’s repository of information about important Lan Na women at http://www.sri.cmu.ac.th/%7Emaeyinglanna/main2/main9.php. Following the change of government that changed Siam to a constitutional monarchy in 1932, her former husband, Prince Boworadet, led the unsuccessful uprising that still bears his name, the Boworadet Rebellion.

Though there is a historical and cultural distinction to be made between the Lan Na and Lan Xang kingdoms, the difference was not well understood by Bangkok Siamese, who tended to lump all northerners into the category of Lao. Thus whenever Dara Rasami and her entourage are referred to as Chao Lao, it should be read not as Lao Ladies, but rather as Lan Na Ladies.\n\n125. Chao Khun Manda Pae was titled chao khun because she was a royal granddaughter, although her mother was not a member of the Chakri royal family.

Originally begun as the Mundhat Ratanarot Palace on Koh Si Chang Island, just off Siam’s coast in the Gulf of Thailand, it was abandoned after the Paknam Crisis of 1893. After Chulalongkorn’s brief visit to the island in May 1901, the structure was disassembled and moved to Dusit Park, where it was rebuilt into Vimanmek Mansion, which opened nineteen months later in 1903.

This system of colors was dictated by the Brahmin-Hindu notion associating a different god with each day of the week, making particular colors auspicious to wear on different days.

Woodhouse research notes, 2012.\n\n15. As in Siam, dancers frequently became concubines of Lan Na’s kings and noblemen, making the boundary between palace lakhon troupes and royal/noble households a very permeable one. Protestant missionaries in Chiang Mai in the 1880s believed that “the theatre girls belong in the main to the king’s harem,” resulting in attempts to “rescue” local girls from being recruited as court dancers.

Mom Chao Siphroma was a princess from the royal family of Nan, another city of Lan Na’s Inland Constellation. Siphroma was famous for refusing to become a consort of King Chulalongkorn in the early twentieth century, rejecting his request via a letter written in English so as to avoid causing a loss of face to the king.

Established in 1924, the school became Chiang Mai Teachers’ College in 1948—the first institution of higher education in Chiang Mai, as Chiang Mai University was not established until 1964. Today the Teachers’ College is a branch of Rajabhat University.\n\n30. Lady Thipawaan was a modern matron in her own right. Not only did she continue to dance—she was one of the two dancers at the head of the procession during King Prajadhipok’s visit to Chiang Mai in 1927—but she also served as the president of Chiang Mai’s Sri Lanna Thai women’s club for the advancement of women and Lan Na culture. See her page at Chiang Mai University’s Social Science Research Institute’s online repository of local Lan Na historical information, MaeYingLanna: http://www.sri.cmu.ac.th/~maeyinglanna/main2/main9.php (accessed January 30, 2019).\n\n31.

This was supposedly why Laddawan and her daughter were skilled equestrians.\n\n54. Queen Savang was a full sister to Saovabha and Sunanta Kumarirat (d. 1880), who were the three highest-ranking queens of Chulalongkorn’s reign, and their sons were in line for the throne. After Saovabha’s sons Vajiravudh (r. 1910–25) and Prajadhipok (r. 1925–33) ruled the kingdom, the Chakri line of succession passed over to Sawang’s sons, Ananta Mahidol and Bhumibhol Adulyadet. Savang’s residence, Sraphatum Palace, still stands on its original lot behind today’s Siam Paragon shopping mall in central Bangkok, and serves as Princess Sirindhorn’s residence.\n\n55.
