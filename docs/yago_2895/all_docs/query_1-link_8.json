        "text": "Polygyny, Women’s Bodies, and the Thai Nation\n\nDuring King Chulalongkorn’s reign (1868–1910), Thai royal concubinage reached its zenith—153 consorts—despite the fact that polygyny itself had become a bone of contention between Siam and the West. While the interested reader can look to the scholarship of Tamara Loos (Subject Siam) and Scot Barmé (Woman, Man, Bangkok) for much more nuanced and in-depth analysis than is possible here, I will attempt to provide a brief sketch of how the polygyny debate played out in Siam, particularly as it related to royal concubines.\n\nSiamese elites first became aware of polygyny’s potential to be “ideologically deployed by foreign powers as evidence of Siam’s uncivilized status”2 during the reign of King Mongkut (r. 1853–68). Although Mongkut considered abolishing polygyny as he negotiated unequal treaties with various Western powers in the 1850s, he ultimately declined, defending polygyny as part of a royal practice he saw as intrinsic to Buddhist monarchy, and culturally distinct—but morally parallel—to European practices. At the same time, Mongkut relaxed some of the rules that made palace consorts appear to be “enslaved for life” to Anna Leonowens, allowing unhappy consorts to exit palace life if they so desired (provided they had not yet borne any children to the king). Both Mongkut and his son, Chulalongkorn, ultimately maintained royal polygyny for its “integrative, alliance-making, and legitimating functions.”3 Thus the practices of royal Siamese polygyny continued on, much as they had for centuries, up until the end of King Chulalongkorn’s reign in 1910.\n\nDuring the latter part of Chulalongkorn’s reign, however, royal concubines’ political currency declined precipitously in the 1890s as he fundamentally reshaped the Thai state through a host of administrative reforms that centralized Bangkok’s control over the kingdom’s peripheral territories. These policies effectively eliminated the need for political marital alliances, redefining Thai territories by the drawing of maps (see Thongchai Winichakul’s brilliant Siam Mapped for an exploration), and assigning Siamese administrators to govern each and every province according to Bangkok’s guidance. Besides these administrative changes, monarchs themselves came out against polygyny on moral grounds. Chulalongkorn’s his son and successor, Vajiravudh (r. 1910–25), was outspoken in his criticism of polygyny and resisted taking more than one wife until near the end of his reign, though he ultimately took three more consorts in an attempt to produce a male heir. Nonetheless, a definition of legal marriage continued to elude the ministers charged with fleshing out Siam’s new legal system. Meanwhile, as Bangkok’s market economy and middle class began to flourish in the first decades of the twentieth century, the debate about marriage and polygyny moved from elite circles into the popular press. There, concerns ranged from anxiety over the rise of prostitution to worries about the potential problems posed by new monogamy laws (i.e., illegitimacy of children, the erosion of women’s rights, etc.).\n\nThe growing Thai middle class viewed elite polygyny in particular as reflecting “the abuses of officialdom and the backwardness of the state.”4 As Barmé notes, Thai writers of the 1910s and 1920s mirrored Western critiques of polygyny as a decadent and illegitimate practice, castigating elite polygynous men as “living an idle, licentious existence, immersed in pleasure while contributing nothing to the wider community.”5 But despite these popular debates and efforts at reform—which included instituting marriage regulations for state officials—a new national marriage law was never formulated while an absolute monarch occupied the Thai throne. It was only after the change of government in 1932—followed by the abdication of King Prajadhiphok in 1933—that the new constitutional government put a national marriage law in place. In the long period during which Thailand had no monarch on the throne in Bangkok (1933–46), various military and civilian leaders vied for power as much of the Thai populace struggled to understand what the term “constitutional monarchy” really meant. This vacuum opened the way for “strong man” politicians like Field Marshal Phibun Songkram and his public relations minister Luang Wichit Wathakan, who embarked on a massive campaign of nation-building activities and public relations initiatives.6 The Phibun regime of the middle 1930s and early 1940s explicitly promoted a nuclear, heteronormative family model among Thai bureaucrats, encouraging them to “kiss their wives goodbye at the door” as they went off to work in the morning. In 1935, the new government finally enacted a national marriage law: only one marriage could be legally registered. Under the new law, it was still technically legal for a man to keep other wives (even if they were not legally recognized). But only the first wife held any rights to property in the event of divorce, and the offspring of lesser wives could only be legally recognized if the father opted to do so. Interestingly, royal polygyny was not mentioned—perhaps due to the fact that prior kings had already become monogamous, or perhaps because there was no king on the throne in that moment to whom it would apply. In any case, we can now see the significance of this omission in the present.\n\nWhile the place of palace women like Dara Rasami in Thai society was assured, the end of royal polygyny spelled the end of significant political power for Thai women. Although women never disappeared entirely from Thai politics, their roles changed significantly—from actors to supporting players. As the Thai struggled to compete successfully in the global race to define their nationhood in the 1930s to mid-1940s, elite women faded from the political center even as much of the work of embodying the new nation fell to its female citizens.7 In 1939 Phibun instituted a broad set of cultural mandates intended to bring the mass population—not just the elites—into line with the requirements of Western modernity. If, as Maurizio Peleggi has noted, “embodying modernity and nationality was a self-improvement task for fin de siècle Siamese monarchs,”8 the “self-improvement” efforts of Phibun’s tenure devolved instead onto the bodies of common women during the middle twentieth century. Among the twelve total cultural mandates Phibun instituted, women’s participation was particularly important to Mandate Ten, which prescribed “modernizing” the dress of the general Thai populace as part of establishing Thailand’s nationhood.9 More concrete instructions for carrying out Mandate Ten’s edicts were provided in eight supplements issued in the spring and summer of 1941 addressed to “Thai Sisters” and “Esteemed Ladies Everywhere.”10 These edicts directed Thai women to grow out their hair in more feminine styles; stop wearing trouser-like chongkrabaen in favor of wrap skirts; and don blouses or shirts instead of wearing a simple wrapped upper garment or going bare-chested.11 A few months later, additional measures—wearing hats and gloves—were also added to the list. Thus the task of “embodying the nation” was shifted from the bodies of elite palace women to the bodies of all Thai women, regardless of location, age, or class.12\n\nUnsurprisingly, changing the daily dress of the mass populace proved more difficult to enforce than to mandate. While the new policies shifted the burden of culturally representing the nation from elites to commoners, leaders put on a series of elite events at Suan Amphon modeled on King Chulalongkorn’s 1905 winter festival, which was itself a fundraising event for the construction of Wat Benchamabophit. These events emphasized the new dress mandates and required attendees to wear modern dress or else be denied entry and accused of “non-Thai” behavior.13 They also turned to former palace women of Dara Rasami’s generation to model the new styles in an attempt to harness their remaining power as cultural elites. For example, Chao Khun Phra Prayoon Wong—then nearly ninety years old—was happy to serve as an ambassador of the modern style, “presid[ing] over many social functions and prize-giving ceremonies.”14 Other women, however, were somewhat less than enthusiastic. When they asked Dara Rasami’s old friend Queen Savang Vadhana to be photographed wearing a hat, she replied, “Today I am hardly myself anymore, now you are even interfering with my head. No! If you really want me to put on a hat then cut my head off and put the hat on it yourself.”15\n\nThe mandates ultimately took root more deeply in Thailand’s center than at its peripheries—but especially in the capital city, where the growing number of government workers and bureaucrats swelled the ranks of Bangkok’s nascent middle class. At the same time, expanding capitalism, which put a wider range of goods within the reach of the middle-class consumer, elided Siamese sumptuary laws. Indeed, the more luxury consumer markers became available, the more eager middle-class Bangkokians became to obtain and display them as markers of their own membership among the modern Thai elite.\n\nNonetheless, these attempts by the state to forge a modern Thai nation on the compliant bodies of its citizens never succeeded in erasing the significance of royal blood from Thai society. While many material markers of class—handbags, designer clothes, expensive cars—can be purchased, lineage cannot. Even today, the high society pages of newspapers and magazines are full of Kridakorns, Amatyakuns, and Na Ayutthayas—familiar surnames that denote noble bloodlines. The social (and inherently political) significance of these family lineages persists in Thai society, in a manner analogous to the persistent prestige of the British royal family (an alignment many Thais see as unambiguous). In contrast to the British example, however, the level of prestige afforded these families by virtue of their links of royal blood with the Thai king himself has no strict analog in Western societies. Though the intervening decades of capitalism have served to create new wealth, particularly among Sino-Thai trading families, the tightly interlocking circles of elite patrons and clients at the top of Thai society continue to persist, rendering contemporary Thai society in many ways nearly as hierarchical today as it was in the past. Indeed, the royalist “yellow shirts”—whether of royal descent or merely aspiring to it—now impart their legitimacy to the ruling military elite. In a striking contrast to Phibun’s policies, the political discourse of today’s Thai royalists often falls back on a classist critique in which the non-eliteness of populist (“red shirt”) activists and politicians—their not-quite-siwilai—is cited as the reason for their unfitness to participate in democratic self-rule. Western critique of these discourses is often met with an exceptionalist counter-narrative that asserts the existence of a unique, Thai-style democracy whose authoritarian orientation is simply unintelligible to culturally clueless outside observers.16\n\nBringing Royal Polygyny Back\n\nWhy has the practice of royal polygyny resurfaced at this particular historical moment? After years of rumors surrounding the former prince’s personal life, his multiple consorts have recently begun to emerge into the public eye. One eyewitness described to me how one of the new king’s current “harem” openly introduced herself as one of a dozen of his “concubines” who participated in the royal coronation ceremonies in May of 2019.20 I suggest that the new monarch’s reintroduction of royal concubinage constitutes an assertion of Thai-style monarchy, and a return to traditionalist notions of absolute monarchy as the foundation of the nation. This throwback to absolutism makes a neat parallel to the notion of Thai-style democracy, a favorite deflection technique utilized by ultraroyalists against Western critics of elite-driven Thai politics, particularly the multiple military coups and “astroturf” protests that have riven the country since 2006. Whereas Chulalongkorn himself was intensely concerned with Western perceptions of Thai siwilai, the current revival of royal polygyny reflects a lack of concern about international reaction; rather, the government’s focus appears to be on shaping the perceptions of the monarchy by the Thai populace at large. The restoration of royal polygyny is entirely consistent with the current attempts on the part of the military ruling class to both appease the current monarch and make royal absolutism fashionable again.\n\nIn the same vein, a related effort to reinvigorate a peculiarly retrograde form of Thai-ness harkens back to Phibun’s cultural dress mandates: the current government has updated and reprised King Chulalongkorn’s 1905 winter festival once again. Entitled “Love and Warmth at Winter’s End” (a direct reference to Chulalongkorn’s 1905 “Winter’s End” celebration rather than the Phibun-era events), the 2018 festival utilized the theme of “Return to Traditional Clothing.”21 The current king, Rama X, himself opened the events clothed in the raja pattern style of dress fashionable during Chulalongkorn’s later reign. Holding the event at the central complex of Suan Amphon and Ananta Samakhom Hall additionally reaffirmed the link between the past(s) and present. The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the euphemism for the military junta in power since the 2014 military coup, announced that participants were encouraged—but not required—to wear “polite” Fifth Reign–era outfits to attend (and rentable clothes were available at the door).22 The event simultaneously fulfilled the military government’s stated goal of encouraging “happiness” while also allowing the new king literally to clothe himself in the garb of King Chulalongkorn’s era. The popularity of the event was expanded across the nation as local businesses and attractions offered discounts to citizens who showed up in Fifth Reign outfits.23 The event was so successful that it was reprised nine months later, from December 2018 to January 2019. Selfies and photographs of event participants filled up Instagram and Pinterest accounts, showcasing fun-loving young elites resplendent in luxuriantly updated versions of traditional Thai garb.24 Such cultural events attempt to fuse together the Thai monarchy and the contemporary nation, making rattaniyom (the Phibun-era term for “official state customs”) an elite cultural preoccupation by referencing a traditional elite version of Thai-ness drawn unironically from the late nineteenth century.25\n\nA possible goal of these events is to obtain buy-in from the middle and elite classes to an opulent, after-party image of “happiness” (an updated version of siwilai?) available to the compliant subjects of a paternalistic Thai monarch in the mold of “tradition,” however nominal. The purpose of such events is less to attempt to redefine the monarch, than it is to broaden the appeal of the conditions of subjecthood: to gild the cage, so to speak, in an era when economic growth (for some) occurs in parallel with tightly restricted political expression.\n\nThe reintroduction of royal polygyny at this historical moment speaks to the contemporary way in which women’s bodies are central to formulations of the Thai state. Whereas royal consorts once embodied political ties between the center and peripheries, they now embody the personal prerogatives of an absolute ruler, and the military government’s interest in emphasizing the absolutist parallels between the eras and practices of Rama V and Rama X. To outsiders, royal polygyny demonstrates to a global audience that outsiders’ opinions of monarchic practice matter far less than the Thai monarch’s freedom to exercise his royal prerogative to make his polygynous lifestyle public. In that sense, the brazen revival of these practices signals the king’s aspiration to membership in the same autocrats’ league as Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump—leaders famous for their “do as I say, not as I do” modes of rule.\n\nThe rehabilitation and reinstatement of Rama X’s newest consort, coming a year after her very public removal, stands in stark contrast to the fates of his previous wives and children.26 Yet the risks to today’s royal consorts and spouses are even greater than in the past, when palace women could at least continue to live in the palace after a disgrace, even if only in chains. Nonetheless, royal polygyny still presents risks to its practitioners, whether from without or within, palace or nation. In describing the popular Thai debate about elite polygyny of the early twentieth century, Loos presciently commented that “polygyny’s former political function of integrating the kingdom was drastically flipped: now it served to dis-integrate the nation.”27 It is possible that royal polygyny will serve that purpose anew, depending on how the practice is perceived by the increasingly dissatisfied youth of the nation now demanding reform of the monarchy, reviving and reaffirming Thailand’s democratic past.28 As of this writing (September 2020), young Thais had taken to the streets of Bangkok yet again for fresh rounds of protest, but this time without the tell-tale “colors” typically flown by either the royalist or populist factions, and with nary but memes and signs bearing the nonobjectionable slang term “chai” (street speak for “yup”) as their armor.29 In the current battle to define Thai-ness, the fusion of past, present, gender, and nation remain central forces—but whose version of siwilai will triumph remains far from certain."
