        "text": "Cyanide has been found in the blood of all six people who died in a luxury hotel suite in Bangkok, say doctors after examining their bodies.\n\nBased on the initial post-mortem examination, they say there is \"no other cause\" that would explain their deaths \"except for cyanide\".\n\nBut further tests are being carried out to determine the \"intensity\" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins.\n\nForensic investigators had earlier found traces of cyanide on the teacups used by the victims, all of whom are of Vietnamese origin including two with dual US citizenship. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who.\n\nThe victims' lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned \"blood red\", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning, said Professor Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University.\n\nDoctor Chanchai Sittipunt, the dean of the Faculty of Medicine, said they still needed to find out how much cyanide was in the blood of the deceased.\n\n\"But from what we have detected - from observation, from internal organ check, from finding cyanide in the blood during the screening test - there is no other cause that would be the factor that would cause their deaths, except for cyanide,” he told reporters.\n\nThe deceased were found by housekeepers at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Thai capital late on Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators believe they had been dead for between 12 and 24 hours by then.\n\nThe mystery around the shocking discovery made international headlines.\n\nThailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered an urgent investigation into the case, stressing that the deaths were the result of a \"private matter\", and there was no suggestion of public danger.\n\nPolice have since begun to piece together what might have happened.\n\nTwo of the six victims had loaned \"tens of millions of Thai baht\" to another of the deceased for investment purposes, authorities said. Ten million baht is worth nearly $280,000 (£215,000).\n\nThe motive is not clear, but police said two of the six had loaned a substantial amount of money to another person in the group, who had not been paid back.\n\nPolice say on Monday afternoon all six victims gathered in the room on the fifth floor.\n\nThe group ordered food and tea, which was delivered to the room around 14:00 local time (08:00 BST) and received by Ms Chong - who was the only person in the room at the time.\n\nAccording to the deputy police chief, a waiter offered to make tea for the guests but Ms Chong refused this. The waiter recalled that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”, authorities said.\n\nThe waiter later left the room.\n\nThe rest of the group then began streaming into the room at various points, between 14:03 and 14:17. No one else is believed to have entered the room apart from the six inside and police have said the door to the room was locked from within.\n\nPolice say there were no signs of a struggle, robbery or forced entry. They later found traces of cyanide in all six tea cups.\n\nPictures released by the police show plates of untouched food left on a table in the room, some of them still covered in cling wrap.\n\nThere was a seventh name on the group's hotel booking, whom police identified as the younger sister of one of the victims. She had left Thailand last week for the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang and is not involved in the incident, police said.\n\nRelatives interviewed by the police said Thi Nguyen Phuong and Hong Pham Thanh, a couple, owned a road construction business and had given money to Ms Chong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan.\n\nPolice suspect that Mr Tran, a make-up artist based in Da Nang, had also been “duped\" into making an investment.\n\nMr Tran's mother Tuý told BBC Vietnamese that he had travelled to Thailand on Friday and had called home on Sunday to say he had to extend his stay until Monday. That was the last his family had heard from him. She rang him again on Monday but he did not answer the call.\n\nMs Chong had hired Mr Tran as her personal make-up artist for the trip, one of his students told BBC Vietnamese. Mr Tran's father, Phu, told Vietnamese media that his son was hired last week by a Vietnamese woman to travel to Thailand.\n\nThe six bodies were discovered one day after Thailand expanded its visa-free entry scheme to travellers from 93 countries and territories to revitalise its tourism industry."
