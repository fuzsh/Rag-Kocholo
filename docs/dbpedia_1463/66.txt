The Icelandic national team in men’s football has yet to play two games in the World Cup qualifying group E: tonight against Cyprus at Reykjavík’s Laugardalsvöllur Stadium and next Tuesday against Norway in Oslo.

If Iceland wins tonight, they will for the first time have a good chance of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Iceland has played against Cyprus six times. Last year, Iceland lost 1-0 in Cyprus, which so far is Cyprus’ only win in qualifying group E.

On three occasions the games between the two nations have resulted in a draw and two times Iceland has won, in 1996 and 2011.

Tonight, a lot is at stake.

The highest-ranking team in group E automatically goes to the 2014 World Cup. The runner-up will move on to the playoffs with seven other teams in second place, out of which four teams secure a place in the tournament.

Eight Icelandic players already have one yellow card and should they get another in tonight’s game they will miss the game against Norway, mbl.is reports.

This is the current standing in group E:
