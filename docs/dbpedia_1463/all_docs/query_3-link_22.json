Men's fourth division) is a football league in Iceland. It is the fifth and second-lowest division in the Icelandic football league system.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division was added to the Icelandic football league system before the 2013 season to make room for a fourth nationwide league. It will be largely the same in format as the previous 3. deild karla was.[1]\n\nGroup stage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division is split into four groups with teams in each group playing the other teams in the same group twice, home and away. The top two teams in each group qualify for the play-off stage for a total of eight teams in the playoffs.\n\nPlay-off stage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe play-offs are played in a knock-out format. Teams are drawn together and play home and away, the winning team progressing to the next round. There is no away goal rule; if teams are drawn at the end of the second match, extra time is played. If after extra time teams are still drawn, penalties decide the winner.\n\nThe final is a single match played on a neutral ground. The winner of the final is the 4th division champion. Both teams that reach the final are promoted to the third division.\n\nThere is also a match played for the third place where the losing teams from the semi-finals play. This is also a single match on a neutral ground.\n\nCurrent clubs (2024)\n\n[edit]\n\n[2]\n\nStadia and locations\n\n[edit]\n\nTeam Location Stadium Árborg Selfoss Selfossvöllur Hamar Hveragerði Grýluvöllur Hveragerði KÁ Hafnarfjörður Ásvellir KFS Vestmannaeyjar Týsvöllur KH Hlíðarendi N1-völlurinn Kría Seltjarnarnes Vivaldivöllurinn RB Keflavík Nettóhöllin Skallagrímur Borgarnes Skallagrímsvöllur Tindastóll Sauðárkrókur Sauðárkróksvöllur Ýmir Kópavogur Kórinn\n\nPast winners\n\n[edit]\n\nPromoted teams shown in green\n\nYear Winners Runners-up 3rd Place 4th Place 2013 Einherji Berserkir KFG Elliði 2014 Álftanes Kári KFS1 Þróttur V. 2015 Vængir Júpiters Þróttur V.
