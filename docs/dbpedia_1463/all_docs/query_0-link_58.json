Preface Language-learning, my Glasgow colleague Alison Phipps once pointed out to me, is not so much epistemological as ontologi¬ cal: it is not a change so much in what you know as in how you are. In this respect, and in others, this book reflects a winding ontological journey. Correspondingly, my acknowledgements feel painfully incomplete, yet awkwardly capacious. Please bear with me. Vaikka “valmistuin” Helsingin yliopiston tutkijakollegiu- mista yli kymmenen vuotta sitten, tama on monessa suhteessa kollegiumin kirja ja monet siina esiintyvista ajatuksista liitty- vat asioihin, jotka opin Helsingin yliopistossa ja ystaviltani yli- opistolla. Matkani ovat ikava kylla suuntautuneet viime aikoina usein luoteeseen koillisen sijaan, mutta minulla on ikava teita! (Trots att jag “utexaminerades” fran Helsingfors universitets forskarkollegium for mer an tio ar sedan sa ar den har i manga avseenden en “Kollegiumbok.” Bland dessa sidor Anns mycket som jag larde vid universitetet och fran mina vanner dar. Ty- varr har jag rest pa senare tid oft are till nordvast an nordost; jag saknar er!) But this book is most of all a product of my time at the Uni¬ versity of Leeds, in the School of English and the Institute for Medieval Studies. Wittingly or unwittingly, we all seek the ap¬ probation of our colleagues and students, and one way or an¬ other this shapes the research we do. My colleagues at Leeds 17 UTRASARVIKINGAR! have been exceptionally supportive at every turn. I am grateful for the semesters of research leave granted by the School of Eng¬ lish in 2014 and 2017 that enabled me to complete a good half of the work for this project. I am particularly indebted to David Higgins, Hamilton Carroll, Jeremy Davies, and Rory McTurk for their willingness to read draft material or discuss my ideas. Much of the learning that underpins this book I gained alongside my students in Old Norse and modern Icelandic. They all have my thanks: it has been an enormous privilege to teach these subjects, and to work with such fun people. I suspect all my doctoral students would hear echoes of their research in this book, because they have all influenced it, but I must especially thank Catalin Taranu, Erika Sigurdson, Helen Price, Katherine Miller, Lynda Taylor, Sheryl McDonald Werronen, and Vicki Cooper for providing one crucial intellectual environment in which this book took shape, which I was very lucky to have. That intellectual environment was also defined by the Leeds University Old Norse Reading Group, to all of whose successive members I am indebted. But, to me, this is also a Leeds book in other ways. I suppose you might say that it is, tacitly, a dialogue between two adoptive homes, Leeds and Reykjavik. It was written as I put down roots in the former, and it has drawn much sustenance from friend¬ ships and activism here. I am grateful to the Team with Many Names, my neighbours, and latterly my teachers and fellow stu¬ dents at Leeds Beckett University. Yvonne Murray and David Hoghton-Carter, in particular, have endured long conversations about this book and offered valuable comments on early ver¬ sions. This book would have been finished much sooner were it not for Ed Carlisle and Leeds Green Party, but it would have felt less meaningful to write. In important ways, this project grew out of the University of Victoria inviting me to deliver the autumn 2011 Beck Lectures, and I am correspondingly indebted to the Richard and Margaret Beck endowment, and to Trish Baer and John Tucker for their hospitality. It was also nurtured through meetings of the Viking Society for Northern Research, and I am hugely grateful for the 18 PREFACE groovy vibe we enjoy in Old Norse studies in the uk. Among Viking Society members, however, Haki Antonsson deserves particular thanks for his pithy observations on my musings. The foundational period of research leave for this book was sub¬ sidised by an invaluable Leverhulme Trust International Aca¬ demic Fellowship, which I also would not have received without the support of Matthew Driscoll, Svanhildur Oskarsdottir, and Terry Gunnell. One perhaps never accrues debts of gratitude quicker than when living in a foreign country.

Takk ollum saman! The dedication of this book is meant inclusively, and both lit¬ erally and figuratively. I hesitate to mention any names because so many others ought to follow. Yet, amidst manifold gratitudes, I have most often found myself offering up a prayer of thanks for the exertions of Messrs Collier and Ferris, of Aylesbury Gram- 19 UTRASARVIKINGAR! mar School. At every turn — whether in language-learning, crit¬ icism, pedagogy, history, or philosophy — I find myself drawing on lessons I learned across six years studying Latin and Ancient History with those two very different and very dedicated schol¬ ars. And among the many kindnesses that have enabled this book to be written, the heavy lifting they did to help me from the bottom of my A-level Latin class to a level commensurate with my ambitions was life- changing. It is perhaps in the nature of first books that they tend to be written as you are establishing your independence from your family — at any rate mine was. Conversely, this book came at a time when I was re-learning my interdependence with my fam¬ ily — not to mention learning to be a part of new ones besides. In some cases through their comments on draft material, and in all cases through conversations, my family have helped to shape this work, just as they are still helping to shape me. Whatever he may make of its contents, this book is more the fault of Andrew Wawn than anyone else but me. He has im¬ plicitly been thanked above already as a teacher, a colleague, a denizen of the Stofnun Arna Magnussonar, and as a friend; to which I must perforce add that he is an invaluable fount of gno¬ mic wisdom. But he has been exceptionally generous in each of these capacities, and deserves much of the credit for whatever this study has achieved. I am fortunate indeed to have worked alongside him. And whatever she may make of its contents, this book is more the fault of Shamira Meghani than anyone else but me and Andrew Wawn. It has been shaped by daily conver¬ sations through which I have benefited from Shamiras knowl¬ edge, critical acuity, and support; indeed, her encouragement to develop my thoughts across a broader canvas is one reason why I wrote this book at all. I hope more fervently in respect of these scholars than any others that they are not too horrified by its inevitable mistakes. 20 1 Opening an Account 1.1 Icelandic culture goes boom Here’s a summary.1 Iceland was first settled by humans in the ninth century. Their dispersed settlement patterns, pastoral farming, and the Norse language that they came to share shaped the island’s society into the nineteenth century and still exert a powerful hold on the public imagination within Iceland, while also influencing the country’s brand abroad. With a more or less wholesale conversion to Christianity in 1000, integration into the Kingdom of Norway in the 1260s, and the absorption of both Norway and Iceland into a Danish empire, effectively from 1415, fundamental institutional structures were established in Icelandic society that defined its political economy into the early twentieth century. Whether the net effect of Danish rule of Iceland was exploitation or subsidy is a matter of long-running 1 Key accounts in English include Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009); Eirikur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014); Mar Wolfgang Mixa, “The Icelandic Bubble and Beyond: Investment Lessons from History and Cultural Effects” (Ph.D. diss., Reykjavik University, 20i6).Vidar Thorsteinsson, “Iceland’s Revolution,” Jacobin, March 14, 2016, https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/iceland- banking-finance-icesave-left-greens, offers a helpful, pithy insight into an avowedly left-wing perspective on post-Crash politics. 21 UTRASARVIKINGAR! debate, but either way, from around the 1830s, Icelandic intel¬ lectuals, often resident in the colonial metropole of Copenha¬ gen and inspired by the German National-Romantic movement, began to lobby for independence from Denmark. Large-scale commercial fishing had been undertaken in Iceland since the fifteenth century, but liberalization of Icelandic trade and fi¬ nance enabled the sector to industrialize around 1900, not least under the influence of the Danish-born entrepreneur Thor Jen¬ sen, whose name will recur in this study. From this time, in¬ dustrial capitalism, urbanization, and devolution from Danish rule became key forces in Icelandic society. Iceland’s population doubled from about 50,000 around 1820 to 100,000 around 1920, and hit 350,000 shortly before 2020. From 10% in 1900, the greater Reykjavik area is now home to more than two thirds of Iceland’s population, and most of the rest too now live in nucle¬ ated settlements. For a long time the main export, fish have re¬ mained key to the economy — even “the foundation of Iceland’s economic independence.”2 Strategically crucial to control of the Atlantic during the Sec¬ ond World War, Iceland was seized by the United Kingdom in 1940. Handed over to the usa in 1941, its strategic importance continued as a Cold War nato outpost. While Iceland gained formal independence from Denmark in 1944, American oc¬ cupation was normalized, continuing until 2006. The massive influx of wartime military infrastructure spending and associ¬ ated opportunities for wage labor pushed the economy into a fully monetized, consumption-driven, urbanized capitalism. In the post-war period, employment was usually full, the economy generally growing quickly, inflation always high, and interest rates often negative: debt was therefore prudent, which swiftly eroded traditional aversions to indebtedness. Post-War Iceland is often assumed by outsiders to be a Nor¬ dic social democracy, but its mid-Atlantic position in fact stands (not entirely coincidentally) as a good metaphor for its twenti¬ eth-century politics, with often rancorous public debate drawing 2 Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis, 37. 22 OPENING AN ACCOUNT on both Nordic welfare models and American free-marketism. What might be called Iceland’s “natural party of government” is the conservative SjalfstasSisflokkurinn (Independence Party): it has been a member of most of Iceland’s governments since 1944. The beginning of its embrace of neoliberalism is marked by the formation of a short-lived neoliberal journal EimreiSin (“The Locomotive”) in the 1970s by a group whose members would go on to prominent political, economic, academic, and media positions. The most famous of these young thinkers is David Oddsson, a key player in the Independence Party’s policies. In the 1980s, Iceland had to come to terms with its disastrous overfishing, and effectively privatized the previously common resources of the sea, distributing to vessel owners fishing quotas that were constituted as tradeable private property. This allowed a relatively small number of players to buy up others’ quotas, rapidly consolidating the fishing industry and concentrating wealth. The move also allowed quotas — essentially, the promise of uncaught fish — to act as collateral for loans, which encour¬ aged a growing culture of credit, debt, and speculation. Iceland’s access to markets and capital was opened up by ac¬ cession to the European Economic Area in 1994, and over the ensuing decade the government also oversaw the deregulation and privatization of Iceland’s banking sector. Since the Wall Street Crash, Iceland’s banks had largely been state-owned and the country fairly closed to foreign investment, so the rapid lib¬ eralization of the financial system was a major shift. However, despite interest from foreign banks, the government ensured that as the Icelandic banks were privatized, they were bought by Icelanders. This policy was due to a mix of naive national¬ ist ideology and politicians’ cynical (if only partly successful) desire to keep control of the banking system within established networks of patronage. By 2003, after a flurry of rebranding, the main players of the Icelandic banking sector emerged as Glitnir, Landsbanki, and Kaupjting. (Tricky to translate, these might be rendered literally as “glitterer,” drawn from a place-name in Old Norse mythology; “the country’s bank”; and “marketplace.”) The details of how these came to take on debts nearly ten times the 23 UTRASARVIKINGAR! size of Iceland’s gdp have been examined in a plethora of publi¬ cations, with many more yet to come, and it is not necessary to plunge into this detail here. The story includes choices, by turns cynical and deluded, by an overwhelmingly male cast of poli¬ ticians, financiers, and businessmen; risk-seeking machismo, cronyism and personal vendettas; exponential expansion of the financial sector; heedless exposure of the currency to interna¬ tional speculation; and a string of dubious and often unlawful practices including mis-selling, banks’ owners becoming those same banks’ biggest debtors, cross-financing between banks, and banks lending people money to enable them to buy those banks’ own shares. These activities correlated with Iceland’s par¬ ticipation in a wider, neoliberal financialization of Western so¬ cieties, for which Iceland stands in some ways as a microcosm, and the newly liberalized Iceland was insufficiently shielded from global financial forces — but it seems beyond doubt that the fundamental causes of the Crash, and the reasons why it un¬ folded in the way that it did, were domestic. When the international credit crunch came, Iceland was not, from the point of view of the global financial system, too big to fail. However, from the point of view of Iceland’s central bank, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupjring proved too big to save. Across three days in October 2008, the big three banks therefore collapsed, followed, in effect, by the central bank itself. The Ice¬ landic currency, the krona, always a weak point in the Icelandic economy, plummeted with them, eventually losing more than half its value. The economic crisis this wrought is generally re¬ ferred to in Icelandic as the hrun, literally “collapse” (also kreppa “difficulty, tight spot”) — hereafter rendered in this book as the Crash. The Icelandic government bailed out the central bank, nationalized the domestic operations of the big three, and put their international sections into administration, imposing capi¬ tal controls to keep foreign capital in the country and so prevent the complete collapse of the krona. Concerned to understand what people do in the face of crises as well as how to avert them, this book is at least as interested in the consequences of the Crash as the causes. The effects of 24 OPENING AN ACCOUNT the Crash were of course numerous and diverse, but for most Icelanders they were felt first and foremost in terms of one of our most basic necessities, housing. Unwisely and often unlaw¬ fully encouraged to take out mortgages denominated in curren¬ cies other than the krona (on the assumption that these debts would depreciate as the krona grew irresistably stronger), 40% of households soon found themselves signifiantly in arrears on mortgage payments.3 Faced down by three months of popular protest, the Social Democratic Alliance resigned from its coali¬ tion with the Independence Party, leading to a parliamentary election in April 2009. The election returned Iceland’s first ever entirely left-wing coalition — but also meant that it was this co¬ alition that had to bear the brunt of the Crash, not least fraught negotiations with the uk and the Netherlands, whose citizens had collectively lost something like €4-5bn in investments in the Landsbanki “Icesave” scheme. (Despite high-profile politicking at all levels of Icelandic society, these problems were eventu¬ ally resolved, in no small part because the banks’ assets proved sufficient to repay most of their debts.) Still, prevented by cir¬ cumstance from bailing out the banks, the public purse proved in good enough shape for the government to spend its way through the recession, with the help of a mixture of loans, cuts, and progressive tax increases, along with strong human capital and a real export economy that was not fundamentally affected by the Crash, but benefited from the plummeting value of the krona. The recession was over by 2011 and the budget more or less balanced by 2014. Nevertheless, the post-Crash left-wing government managed to accrue most of the popular blame for the pain of the reces¬ sion, and was replaced in 2013 by the familiar coalition of the Independence and Progressive Parties, who had succeeded at the last moment in fending off constitutional reform that might, amongst other things, have reduced the disproportionate repre¬ sentation of their rural supporters in the Icelandic parliament, the Alpingi. This government was able to remove the last of the 3 Ibid., 129. 25 UTRASARVIKINGAR! capital controls in 2017, in a significant way marking the end of Iceland’s financial crisis. In the intervening period, however, those whose once-liquid wealth was trapped in Iceland by the capital controls tended to invest in property, snapping up fore¬ closed mortgages, achieving a major shift of land-ownership into the hands of wealthy rentiers and, within a short time, pushing up housing prices and rents dramatically. Meanwhile, following its own exponential growth, tourism now accounts for about 40% of Iceland’s foreign exchange earn¬ ings, twice as much as marine products. It may even have been boosted by the international media coverage that accompanied the Crash. It certainly helped drive both the economic recovery and the property boom. Thus, at the time of writing, Iceland is exeriencing a new boom, which is happily based in the real economy, but worryingly in an industry where demand is infa¬ mously elastic. Although Iceland is objectively a unique coun¬ try in various ways, and an attractive tourist destination for this reason, its success relies far less on objective attractions than on the careful cultivation of its national brand; with getting on for two million tourists passing through the country in 2016, sustaining this brand is putting strain on Icelanders’ own sense of their national identity. As widely in the West, Iceland experiences a sharp divide be¬ tween generally elderly, rural voters who feel left behind by Ice¬ land’s development and are right-leaning, and generally young, urban voters who live in a Reykjavik that has in some ways be¬ come cosmopolitan, and are left-leaning. 1.2 Charting the Cultural Boom “Can one base identity on irony?” asked Kristinn Schram as he “stood in the midst of the revelling Viking-helmeted bankers at the 2007 midwinter feast of Glitnir Bank,” and wondered “who was performing to whom? And why?”4 Ironic, postmodern self- 4 Kristinn Schram, “Banking on Borealism: Eating, Smelling, and Performing the North,” in Iceland and Images of the North, ed. Sumarlidi 26 OPENING AN ACCOUNT deprecation is a prominent characteristic of Icelandic culture, so the question is an important one and will resonate through this book. I am by profession a medievalist, and while this book is not primarily about medievalism, it is by the constellations of medieval Icelandic literature and later folklore that I have steered my analyses of post-Crash Icelandic fiction. Amidst all the postmodern irony in Iceland’s recycling of its history, Crash-novels can be seen, at times, to compete earnestly over historical terrain and its meanings, accepting that history is ca¬ pable of multiple different narrations and renarrations, but also that there are understandings of the past which are empirically grounded, or at least licensed by medieval primary texts, which conflict with the narratives which dominate Icelandic culture. In economic research, Iceland has emerged as one popular case-study of the 2008 Western financial crisis: the collapse of Iceland’s banks came early enough in the crisis for Iceland to be seen as the “canary in the mine”; was uniquely spectacular; and was relatively readily comprehended because of the country’s small size and the swift, thorough, and public efforts of its gov¬ ernment to investigate the causes of the collapse.* 5 In the same way, Iceland also deserves close analysis as a case-study in how art has responded to the Crash. Characterized by one author as “litlu landi a hradferd fra torn 51 d til framtidar” (“a small country on an express journey from the ancient past to the future”), Ice¬ land encapsulates the urgency in the early twenty-first century of both the pre-capitalist past and a globalizing future in ways that resonate far beyond its shores.6 Whereas lots has been written about the finance, econom¬ ics, and politics of the Crash in Iceland, Anglophone scholar¬ ship has taken rather little note of the fact that there were two R.

Alongside the financial boom, there was also a cultural one.7 With its roots running deeper than deregulation, to some extent this cultural boom took place independently of high finance; one early milestone in its development would be the sudden international success of The Sugarcubes’ debut album Life’s Too Good in 1988. But the two booms were nonetheless closely connected, as economic growth and rising cultural prestige fed off each other. Indeed, in many respects the two booms proceeded in lockstep: in ear¬ ly twenty-first century Iceland, the penetration of the cultural sector by the financial was deep. For example, Bjorgolfur GuS- mundsson, chairman and part-owner of Landsbanki from 2003 to October 2008, who in 2009 experienced what appears to have been the worlds biggest ever personal bankruptcy (but is per¬ haps best-known outside Iceland as the owner, from 2006-9, of West Ham football club), became the main owner of Iceland’s biggest publisher, Edda, which was itself buying up smaller Ice¬ landic publishers.8 Meanwhile, some of the most interesting and prominent writers in this study, such as Eirikur Orn NorSdahl, Ottar M. NorSfjorcS, and Steinar Bragi, were linked to the exper¬ imental Nyhil art collective. I argue below that their left-field lit¬ erary organizing during the boom years fostered a diversity and political acuity on the Icelandic literary scene that proved genu¬ inely important when crisis came. Nevertheless, in 2006, Nyhil 7 Cf.

Moreover, in the wake of the Crash, Iceland’s economic recovery has depended to an alarming extent on a new boom, this time in tourism. Many tourists are drawn directly by Iceland’s literature, music, and film industries — but even when the main attraction is Iceland’s landscape, what tour¬ ists encounter is still an assiduously cultivated national brand, as much the idea of Iceland as the land itself.10 Understanding the literary side to Iceland’s boom and bust, then, is important to understanding not only the relationship of art to neoliber¬ alism, but also ongoing developments in Icelandic culture and economics. And whatever else might be said of Icelandic literary re¬ sponses to the Crash, they were swift and numerous. I am conscious that, intent on coming to grips with Icelandic finan¬ cial-crisis literature, I have neglected the wider context of art relating to the Financial Crisis in other Western countries (let alone other work surrounding indirectly connected upheavals, like the Arab Spring) — though it is perhaps worth noting that many of the Icelandic writers I study here combine sometimes very local commitments within Iceland with much more inter¬ national perspectives, writing from, for example, Spain (Ottar M. NorSfjorS), the uk (Sigrun Davidsdottir), Finland (Eirikur Orn NorSdahl), Germany (Audur Jonsdottir), the usa (Kari Tulinius), or even while travelling in Ethiopia, Pakistan, and 9 “Bokhneigdur banki,” Morgunbladid, March 3, 2006. 10 See for example Kristin Loftsdottir, Katla Kjartansdottir, and Katrin Anna Lund, “Trapped in Cliches: Masculinity, Films and Tourism in Iceland,” Gender, Place & Culture 24, no. 9 (2017): 1225-42 and the references given there. 29 UTRASARVIKINGAR! Senegal (Bjarni HarSarson).11 But the distinctiveness of Icelan¬ dic authors’ post-Crash concern with the hegemony of its finan¬ ciers can be indicated by comparison with the two pre-eminent British Crash-novels: John Lanchester’s Capital and Sebastian Faulks’s A Week in December. As I discuss in Chapter 2, both Icelandic and British literature struggle to write the Crash as a systemic, social phenomenon, and instead drift into conceptu¬ alizing it as a personal crisis for a banker, struggling to get be¬ yond an individualistic account of the Crash.12 But they struggle in different ways. Each with a dozen or so intertwining stories, both Capital and A Week in December are predicated on the sense that Londoners’ experiences are so radically varied and their society so complex that they can only really be assayed through a loosely articulated network of narratives. It is the no- vellist’s work to reveal each section of society to the others, and to map the invisible interdependencies which comprise Lon¬ don’s social and economic fabric. London is in turn presented as a metonym for the fabulously complex globalized economy and society which any serious attempt to investigate neoliberalism and the financial crisis must attempt to map — hence the double 11 Some key studies are: Suman Gupta, “Philology of the Contemporary World: On Storying the Financial Crisis,” Philology 2 (2016): 275-96 and Nicky Marsh, Paul Crosthwaite, and Peter Knight, “Show Me The Money: The Culture Of Neoliberalism,” New Formations 80-81 (2013): 209-17 on the uk; Leigh Claire La Berge, Scandals and Abstraction: Financial Fiction of the Long 1980s (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), Annie McClanahan, Dead Pledges: Debt, Crisis, and Twenty-First-Century Culture (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2016), and Judith Schulz, From Wall Street to Main Street: Tracing the Shadows of the Financial Crisis from 2007 to 2009 in American Fiction (Wiesbaden: Metzler, 2016), on the usa; Olga Bezhanova, Literature of Crisis: Spains Engagement with Liquid Capital (London: Bucknell University Press, 2017), on Spain; Elenia Yannakakis and Natasha Lemos, “Introduction,” in Critical Times, Critical Thoughts: Contemporary Greek Writers Discuss Facts and Fiction, eds.

(And even then, Lanches- ter’s novel was both preceded and followed by non-fiction books about the Crash, as if he found that no single mode was suitable for tackling it.13) By contrast, Iceland is a small and egalitarian enough coun¬ try that, while recognizing its profound connections to the rest of the world, it feels possible to chart an integrated account of the crisis at a national level. Thus the tangibility of a small group of larger-than-life celebrity bankers in Iceland, ostensibly quite unlike the shadowy suits hidden behind serried walls of shell companies who are their counterparts elsewhere, has in a way been a blessing to writers, and one reason why Icelanders have been able to get some grip artistically on the Crash where An¬ glophone authors have at best struggled or, more usually, not tried. Yet these characteristics also mean that writers were more intimately bound to the boom than they might have been in oth¬ er places. Whereas for British writers the challenge of 2008 has been to argue that Britain’s disparate society needs to be under¬ stood as a whole, the most burning question for Icelandic writ¬ ers following the Crash is how a flourishing diversity of critical voices can be fostered.14 Sigrun Davidsdottir’s Samhengi hlut- anna also uses London as the scene for trying to map interna¬ tional finance (and Iceland’s place in it) — but, characteristically, she does so through the eyes of a single, Icelandic protagonist, who acts as a node in a network of friendships and family ties. Through this one nexus point, Sigrun seeks to map out the soci¬ ety of the Icelandic boom. Indeed, in the present study a person cited in one paragraph as a scholar or journalist will appear in another as an author (among them Eirikur Orn Norddahl, Kari Tulinius and Sigrun Davidsdottir); people who appear below as authors and critics found themselves serving as mps following the 2009 elections (brainn Bertelsson, Katrin Jakobsdottir and 13 Gupta, “Philology of the Contemporary World,” 286. 14 Cf.

Johanesson), while others wrote as they adjusted to losing jobs as mps (Bjarni Hardarson) or bankers (GuSmundur Oskarsson, Armann borvaldsson, Mar Wolfgang Mixa). Sever¬ al, indeed, appear in my own acknowledgements. Thus Icelandic literature presents potentially powerful contributions to a wider international discussion, particularly with regard to the power of finance to shape public opinion, the problem of group-think, and the capacity of fiction to address high finance. I am acutely conscious that the genesis of this book was my own endeavor to improve my Icelandic, and that my grasp of the language has grown with each novel I read. Reading rela¬ tively slowly in a foreign language is aesthetically quite a dif¬ ferent experience from reading as a native- speaker — not least because, defamiliarized, the process of reading itself becomes an aesthetic experience. With unnerving consistency, Icelandic acquaintances’ response to my sheepish admission that I am working on the(ir) Crash has been to say that, as a foreigner, I might see things in ways that Icelanders themselves can’t. This response hints at the deep concern in Iceland that a small soci¬ ety needs outside points of view; but it is perhaps also a polite (and unwitting) manifestation of the idea that only Iceland¬ ers can really understand Iceland.15 (This tension manifests in a large amount of the fiction studied here in the form of pro¬ tagonists who are Icelanders, yet are returning to Iceland after a long period abroad.)16 One’s confidence is not bolstered by the separate fact that taking a pop at literary critics is a frequent passtime in Crash-novels. In Ottar M. NorSfjorS’s Lygarinn, the writer Vera admonishes her students about the importance of Roland Barthes’s seminal essay “The Death of the Author”: “Jjessi ahrifamikla bokmenntafraechkenning virtist jxi ekki hafa 15 Magnus Einarsson, “The Wandering Semioticians: Tourism and the Image of Modern Iceland” in Images of Contemporary Iceland: Everyday Lives and Global Contexts, eds.

That’s to say, there’s no-one there who can read the existential significance of a work of literature and situate it in its cultural context”). Here Almar denigrates the critics who failed to comprehend his al¬ legorical warning of the impending Crash.18 More luridly, Emil borsson’s efforts to write a dissertation on death in the novels of Halldor Laxness in Steinar Bragi’s novella Rafflesiublomid corre¬ late with his descent into necrophilia. As a foreigner with quite limited exposure to Icelandic culture, I read these complaints nervously. Certainly Icelandic novels seldom suggest conclu¬ sions about Icelandic society so distinctive that they cannot be gleaned from other cultural commentary, not least the extensive anthropological work of Kristin Loftsdottir19 or the culturally and economically astute scholarship of Eirikur Bergmann.20 This book is, therefore, aimed primarily at an Anglophone audience, offering a case study of how one literary culture has responded to the Crash. Anglophones have relatively little op¬ portunity to sample contemporary Icelandic literature for them¬ selves: Icelandic novels are widely translated into Scandinavian, French, and German, and often other European languages like Polish, Dutch, Finnish, or Spanish, but find their way slowly, if at all, into the brutally monolingual Anglophone book market. 17 Ottar M.

The only novels which I discuss in detail in this book so far to have appeared in English are Bjarni Bjarnason’s Mannorb and Steinar Bragi’s Hdlendib (both in 2017), and Andri Snaer Magna- son’s Timakistan (2018). To help readers without ready access to Icelandic texts, I have supported this study with a raft of Wiki¬ pedia entries on the texts, personalities, and key ideas covered. For a summary of any text discussed in this work, for example, just search Wikipedia. Nevertheless, although hrunib, pib munib (“the crash, you remember”), an encyclopaedia of Crash-related writing, has done a major service in surveying and memorializing Crash- literature for an Icelandic audience, there has not hitherto been a sustained analysis of Iceland’s Crash-fiction in any language, and I hope the present study does provide a platform for further analysis within Iceland as well as beyond. Indeed, despite the prominence of Icelandic literature on the international scene, long-form academic studies of contemporary Icelandic writ¬ ing are few.21 The present study, then, aims not only to analyse how Icelandic writers responded to the Crash, and the forms and functions of medievalism in post-Crash society, but also to provide a cross-sectional view of the contemporary Icelandic fiction scene. In the following chapters, I investigate how writers have tried to respond to the Crash through the medium of the novel before exploring the anxieties about Icelandic identity and Iceland’s place in the world that suffuse Crash-writing. I take a close look at how representations of Iceland’s foremost celebrity banker of the boom period, Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson, help us to un¬ derstand the use and abuse of medievalism in Icelandic politics, before closing by analysing some key efforts at utopian thinking in the wake of the Crash. 21 The main surveys are Astradur Eysteinsson and Ufhildur Dagsdottir, “Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940-2000,” in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed.

Brunsdale, Encyclopedia of Nordic Crime Fiction: Works and Authors of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden since 1967 (Jefferson: McFarland, 2016), 183-242. 34 OPENING AN ACCOUNT This book actually has relatively little to say about finance: this silence reflects my sources, and in Chapter 2 I explore the reasons for it. Tending to focus on the work of writers born in the 1970s and 1980s, this chapter invokes the concept of “capital¬ ist realism” to discuss why early twenty-first-century Icelandic writing — and by implication writing more widely in the Global North — has proved so poorly adapted to exploring some of the most important realities of the world around it. Yet we can read economic commentary between the lines in ostensibly unlikely places, and explore utopian possibilities in the same way. The middle chapters of this book explore how Iceland’s financial crisis was as much a crisis of the pjodarsdlin (literally “nations soul”) as it was of the national balance sheet, with all the anxiety and contestation regarding national identity that that implies. The crisis of identity was partly a collision of nineteenth -centu¬ ry nationalist models of nationhood with a globalized moder¬ nity, demanding that Icelanders reaffirmed or renegotiated their identity in relation to other nations. Again drawing primarily on relatively young writers, Chapter 3 brings both novels and wider post-Crash cultural material together to examine Iceland’s acute anxieties of identity, as a near microstate which has historically been both poor and colonized, yet which in the boom surged to great riches; and as a country that gains important diplomatic leverage from its heritage and its whiteness, yet is increasingly finding itself made a spectacle for tourists and enmeshed in global movements of finance and people. The chapter focuses on a tension that these novels bring to the fore: between tra¬ ditional, golden-ageist, National- Romantic medievalism and a dystopian, Orientalist medievalism that has come to promi¬ nence in Iceland in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001. Chapter 4 looks mostly to authors born in the 1960s and before — who tend to draw more deter¬ minedly on Iceland’s medieval literary heritage, and perhaps to have a different relationship with the neoliberal culture into which younger writers are inevitably more deeply immersed. It offers case-studies of two novels that have made particularly os¬ tentatious use of medieval intertexts, both responding particu- 35 UTRASARVIKINGAR! larly to the medievalism of Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson: Bjarni HarcSarson’s Sigurdar sagafdts and Bjarni Bjarnason’s Mannord. Both Sigurdar sagafdts and Mannord, however, still make some headway in analysing the networks of patronage and clientage that facilitated the boom. Keen to conclude an investigation of an often gloomy corpus on a positive note, I examine in Chapter 5 what kinds of uto¬ pian thinking are articulated in Crash-literature. Just as Crash¬ writing struggles to deal directly with finance, it reflects wider utopian thinking in Iceland after the Crash only partially, but nonetheless interestingly, pointing in particular to the impor¬ tance of gender and architecture in rethinking Icelandic society. At the center of the chapter is perhaps the most lively literary response to the Crash, Eirikur Orn NorSdahl’s Gceska, which unusually combined formal experimentation, political vigor, satirical sharpness and utopian commitment: Eirikur Orn not only charts but also challenges the anxieties I identify in many novels about the Crash. 1.3 Three Terms: Hegemony, Utopianism, and Neoliberalism Most of the people who are actually likely to read this book will be conversant with these key terms of contemporary Western cultural criticism and can skip safely to the next section. But I have some hope that this book will also appeal to people who may not be familiar with how these terms are used in cultural theory, so it is worth explaining them. “There, I’ve said it: the ‘C-word’. Just mentioning that term sounds almost subversive. Even talking about ‘capitalism’ makes it sound like you’re a dangerous radical of some kind,” writes Jim Stanford in his Economics for Everyone.1* I was born in the same year Margaret Thatcher came to power, into a pro-Thatch¬ er family in a safe Tory seat: my childhood was almost exactly coeval with eighteen years of Conservative governance. Until 22 Jim Stanford, Economics for Everyone: A Short Guide to the Economics of Capitalism, 2nd edn. (London: Pluto Press, 2015), 31. 36 OPENING AN ACCOUNT 2010, notwithstanding influential years living in Scotland and Finland, I lived my whole adult life in an important sense un¬ der the Ihatcherite Labour governance that followed from 1997. Although I feel things changing, gradually, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, I know what Stanford means about the C- word. Likewise, the term neoliberalism — which I necessarily use a lot below — still feels modish. And until a few years ago, the first thing I thought of when I heard the word hegemony was the political supremacy of one ancient Hellenic city-state over another; its meaning in Marxist cultural theory is a pretty recent arrival in my lexicon. (And there goes the “M-word.”) Utopian was an adjective evoking Thomas Mores 1516 Utopia and not a great deal more. The most important technical term in this book is hegemo¬ ny, in a sense crystallized from the varied usages of Antonio Gramsci. For our purposes, hegemony is the process by which elites convince the people they dominate that these power rela¬ tions are normal, natural, common-sense, or inevitable, when in fact they are particular to a time and place. In this way, elites dissuade people, sometimes unconsciously, from questioning their dominance. Mar Wolfgang Mixa’s interviews with Iceland’s boom-time bank employees give a straightforward example of hegemony at work; “many people [...] expressed bitterness at having fought to keep the banks afloat for what they then con¬ sidered a just cause, only to find out that they were actually fighting for the interests of small groups.”23 These employees were partly the victims of a straightforward deception. But if we are to explain why they did not question business practices which were, in hindsight, obviously hugely risky, or to explain why they blindly placed their trust in the small cabals that owned their banks, the hegemonic power of the banks’ owners and executives must play a part. And the experience of these 23 Mar Wolfgang Mixa, “A Day in the Life of an Icelandic Banker,” in Gambling Debt: Iceland’s Rise and Fall in the Global Economy, eds. E. Paul Durrenberger and Gisli Palsson (Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2015), 42. 37 UTRASARVIKINGAR! employees was, of course, repeated across the developed world not only among bankers but also citizens at large. As a rule, hegemony works by being invisible, hence the awkwardness over the “C-word”: the people who benefit most from capitalism prefer to have it referred to it as “the market economy” or even just “the economy,” as if capitalism were the only possible game in town; to call a spade a spade feels sub¬ versive because it calls attention to the fact that there are other tools out there that might do the same job. Everyone is, like it or not, caught up in hegemonic systems. But, understandably, no-one likes being told this: we get irritated when people tell us that when we think were acting rationally in accordance with our free will we are really acting in the interest of people who are oppressing us. This irritation is sometimes, of course, well founded — but it is often hegemony’s immune system at work. The reason why hegemony is at the center of this book is that literature is one of the mechanisms for shaping what people see as normal, natural, common-sense, or inevitable in the world around them — and, conversely, for challenging those percep¬ tions. It is tempting to wonder whether, in the world of so-called “post-truth” politics which many seem to inhabit in the second decade of the twenty-first century, where elites seem to be less concerned with convincing people of a given “truth” than with destabilizing truth altogether, it is worth labouring to expose hegemonic structures. Yet at least in the context of the Icelan¬ dic boom that preceded the Crash, the power of hegemony is (in retrospect) so apparent that the continued critical power of exposing hegemony can scarcely be doubted. Icelanders are of¬ ten adept in talking about the cultural constructs at the heart of Icelandic identity in sophisticated, post-modern, self-reflexive ways, such that one might imagine that these constructs exert no influence at all on actual decision-making. Yet the story of the boom shows that this would be a huge misunderstanding: beneath a self-knowing and self-critical veneer, cultural con¬ structs like the Viking, the True Icelander, or the unique genius 38 OPENING AN ACCOUNT of the Icelandic nation do exert an enormously powerful influ¬ ence on Icelandic society and its politics. Moments in literature which challenge hegemonic “common sense” may be called utopian. In everyday usage, a “utopia” is an impossibly nice place, and Iceland is for many people outside the country a utopia in this sort of sense: imaginary, off the map; a place of unearthly natural wonders; a land of inexplicably sex¬ ually available Nordic beauties; the most politically progressive country on Earth; a lost island of white supremacists’ contem¬ porary ancestors; and more.24 But in cultural theory, utopian tends to refer to art which contemplates desirable things that could come to pass, if we just opened our minds to the pos¬ sibility. When, during their 2010 Reykjavik municipal election campaign, the insurgent Best Party said “we are going to attend all meetings and always be cheerful and fun, but also specula¬ tive, responsible, and diligent,” their promise to be “speculative” was a promise to be utopian.25 The fact that the party, to every¬ one’s surprise, won a landslide victory and went on to do a good job of running the city — arguably a better one than professional politicians had tended to — emphasizes that utopian aspirations can lead to real-world achievements. This book is particularly concerned to identify and analyse the utopian thinking of post-Crash Icelandic literature: there is, after all, no question that the world needs it. One consequence of continuing the economic and electoral realities of the boom period will be ecological collapse on a scale which will dramati¬ cally reduce Earth’s capacity to harbor our species, with unspeak¬ able consequences for poorer people — not to mention for other species. As Benjamin Kunkel puts it in the title of his 2014 article collection, we are facing “utopia or bust.” So it is not a surprise to 24 Cf. Dimitrios Kassis, Icelandic Utopia in Victorian Travel Literature (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016), on Victorian attitudes to Iceland. 25 Hulda Proppe, “‘Welcome to the Revolution!’ Voting in the Anarcho- Surrealists,” in Gambling Debt: Iceland's Rise and Fall in the Global Economy, eds. E. Paul Durrenberger and Gisli Palsson (Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2015), 83. 39 UTRASARVIKINGAR! see people from diverse points on the political spectrum lapping up journalism suggesting that Icelanders have brought about a post-Crash revolution, imprisoned their banksters, weaned themselves off fossil fuels, moved on from patriarchy, decided to reform the money-supply, offered to take in thousands of Syr¬ ian refugees, or elected not to make the elves that are indigenous to the island homeless through industrial development.26 These stories are usually only slightly true, and much of this book tries to articulate how post-Crash Icelandic literature responds to the anthropologizing gaze of foreign visitors and journalists, and so to communicate to an English-speaking audience something of what Icelandic novels make of this fetishization of the island and its culture. The “kitchenware revolution” forced elections which returned a fractious, factional government that was deftly out¬ manoeuvred and, in 2013, replaced by the parties that oversaw the banking boom (which are showing little sign of commit¬ ment to economic reform). While an unparalleled number of bankers were successfully prosecuted, justice has necessarily been a slow process, with court cases still ongoing a decade after the Crash — and much of the behavior that caused the Crash was in any case perfectly lawful. One of the main protagonists of the boom and bust, Bjorgolfur Thor Bjhrgolfsson, who became Iceland’s first dollar-billionnaire in 2005 remained Iceland’s sole billionnaire in 2017. Iceland’s per capita carbon-emissions are above the European and oecd averages. While women do well on many indicators, they nonetheless saw their economy brought to its knees by a testosterone-fuelled clique of male po- liticans and bankers. And as for elves, I discuss them in some detail below, but if I was one of them I would not bet on the Icelandic state driving around my house rather than through it. But however hyperbolic or ill-informed, stories about Iceland’s successes do afford their readers evidence, some of it meaning¬ ful, that the political and economic impasses they seem to face in their own societies are not immutable. I hope this book will 26 G.S. Motola, An Equal Difference (London: Restless Machinery, 2016), while well informed, is a fulsome example of this eulogistic tendency. 40 OPENING AN ACCOUNT give nuanced insights into how Icelandic writers have managed to conceive the world differently — and when, as they often do, they have hit the buffers of a narrow realism — they have none¬ theless managed to provide well informed reference points for how Icelandic thought really might help us write ourselves a dif¬ ferent world. Neoliberalism is, for this book, a necessary shorthand for a complex and shifting set of political and economic policies and ideologies that have prevailed (more or less) in the uk since the election of Margaret Thatcher and in the usa since the election of Ronald Reagan, and which began to gain serious traction in Iceland with the election of David Oddsson to the mayoralty of Reykjavik in 1982. Few Continental European countries have been as extreme as these three in their embrace of neoliberal- ism, but the trend in recent decades has been consistently in its favor. Neoliberalism can refer to the academic thought of people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, but also to the sometimes very different practices which their work in¬ spired, or which became unintended consequences of imple¬ menting neoliberal policies. Key themes of neoliberal policy include privatization of public assets and services, and, at least in theory, the idea that societies will function optimally though the maximizing of positive freedoms (for example freedom for women to work, for people to have homosexual relationships, or for people to spend private income as they please) at the ex¬ pense of negative freedoms (for example freedom from want, from exploitative employment practices, or ill health). However, as neoliberalism has sought to promote its chosen freedoms, it has often brought authoritarian practices, both in government and the workplace, such as curtailing rights to protest or strike, invading other countries, or introducing ever more intricate state intervention to create “markets” where there were none before. And, as the financial crisis emphasized, alongside the privatization of profits, neoliberalism has made integral the so¬ cialization of losses. Neoliberalism has at times posed as being outside politics, as if there really was a “free market” and as if the workings of this market were apolitical. This is, of course, 41 UTRASARVIKINGAR! hegemony at work, and although neoliberalism is an awkward word, it is surely right that “the increased use of the term neo¬ liberalism since 2000 is a symptom of the weakening power of neoliberalism. The more it is named, the less its doctrines can pose as post-political.”27 Neoliberalism is not, then, unitary: it is a shifting phenom¬ enon characterized by trends rather than clear boundaries, and can manifest differently in different contexts. Using one label for these trends carries the risk of making them seem more coher¬ ent than they are, or conversely of stretching the term to the point where it is simply a catch-all for disfavoured policies. But, notwithstanding these caveats, the trends are clear and having a name for them has proved useful in writing the pages that fol¬ low. Neoliberalism can be thought of as the successor to the Keynsian consensus that coincided with the dramatic period of growth in economies, equality, and productivity during the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Europe, Japan, and America, but to some extent most of the rest of the world — the so-called “golden age of capitalism.” When people are critical of neoliber¬ alism, it is often unclear whether they would prefer something more like Keynsian capitalism or something non-capitalist, something else again, or whether, like myself as I write this, they are agnostic on the point. Either way, since 2008, the cri¬ tique of neoliberalism is something people of diverse political stripes have been able to get behind. I often write below, then, of authors resisting or responding to “neoliberalism” when it is not clear whether it is specifically neoliberalism or capitalism more generally that the authors would say they were engaging with — the attraction of the term neoliberalism in this respect is that whatever else they may be resisting, the novels are certainly resisting neoliberalism. 27 Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, “Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue,” New Formations 80 (2013): 89-101, at 90. Cf. Sigurjon Baldur Hafsteinsson, Phallological Museum (Zurich: Lit, 2014). 42 OPENING AN ACCOUNT In the arts, the handmaid to neoliberalism has, in some re¬ spects at least, been postmodernism. Modernism was an intel¬ lectual movement associated with the interwar period which was committed to the idea of social progress: that there were objectively valid goals for progress, that these could be achieved through scientific discovery, and that they could be achieved for the general benefit of society. Modernism was committed to the idea that there is such a thing as truth. Promising though this commitment sounds, it correlated with the rise of totali¬ tarianism, both fascist and communist. Postmodernism, ac¬ cordingly, doubted modernisms commitment to truth. From a postmodern viewpoint, the study of history, for example, does not reveal the truth about the past, but rather creates new stories from old material. This recognizes that many different sides to a story can, in a way, be true; “right” and “wrong” are not fixed moral co-ordinates, but vary from one context to another. This insight has been liberating and valuable, acknowledging that so¬ cial or scientific elites may not hold all the answers to society’s problems and that there are many different, yet valid, ways of seeing the world. But it is hard to be politically progressive if you no longer really believe that there is such a thing as prog¬ ress — just a collection of equally valid subjective perspectives. Thus, as Fisher’s summary of Deleuze and Guattari’ s Capitalism and Schizophrenia puts it, capitalism is a system which is no longer governed by any transcendent Law; on the contrary, it dismantles all such codes, only to re¬ install them on an ad hoc basis. The limits of capitalism are not fixed by fiat, but defined (and redefined) pragmatically and improvizationally. This makes capitalism very much like the Thing in John Carpenter’s film of the same name: a mon¬ strous, infinitely plastic entity, capable of metabolizing and absorbing anything with which it comes into contact.28 28 Fisher and Gilbert, “Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony,” 5-6. 43 UTRASARVIKINGAR! To put it another way, putting corporate robber-barons in the role of arch-villain never stopped Hollywood producers turning a profit.29 No longer feeling sure what is right or just, people in post¬ modernity struggle to throw their weight behind mass move¬ ments, while privileged individuals find it easier to imagine that in playing the system for their own gain they are being moral or just. But environmental change has brought objective, material realities only partly accessible through human experience ham¬ mering at the gates of politics, at the same time as the rise of “post-truth politics,” in which key Western politicians and their voters are increasingly willing and able to invent whatever ac¬ count of history suits their immediate purposes, are gaining a new purchase. Postmodernism is, then, entering its own crisis, in parallel to neoliberalism. 1.4 What Is Crash-Literature? Already in 2010, Bjorn hor Vilhjalmsson, reviewing Eirikur Orn NorSdahls Gceska, suggested that “er mogulegt ad kalla serstaka undirgrein islenskra samtimabokmennta: hrunskaldverk” (“it is possible to identify a particular sub-genre of Icelandic contem¬ porary literature: Crash -writing”). 30 But as Eirikur Orn himself has said, defining what literature counts as “crisis-literature” is not an easy task. To a certain extent (practically) all literature writ¬ ten during (or right after) the crisis is “crisis-literature” — and even a great deal of the literature written during the economic boom, before the crisis.

[...] The prose fiction that deals with the crisis does so, in a certain sense, peripherally. The novels are all es¬ sentially about something else — they stand right in front of the crisis and they turn their gaze away.31 I have simply sought omnivorously to read all the novels pub¬ lished in Icelandic which mention or clearly allude to the Crash — books written almost uniformly by Icelanders for Ice¬ landers, allowing me to peek inside Iceland’s internal discourses on the Crash. A key period for the writing of this book was a period of research leave in 2014, which enabled me to attempt to read all relevant fiction up to the end of 2012; thereafter I have sampled incompletely.32 There is, as Eirikur Orn NorSdahl put it, also “boatloads of poetry about the crisis,” not to mention film, music, drama, and other artistic responses.33 1 chose to focus on novels over verse on the supposition that for the most part they reach, and so perhaps reflect, a wider audience, while I began the research for this project too late to see most of the key theat¬ rical responses close up.34 But I have (unsystematically) sampled poetry, films, drama and short stories and included them in this study where I have found that they illuminate the themes ex¬ posed by prose fiction. 31 Norddahl, “Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute,” in. 32 In assembling my corpus, I drew particularly on Arni Matthiasson, Sunnudags Moggin, November 15, 2009, 52; Norddahl, “Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute”; Margret Tryggvadottir, “Barnabaskur eftir hrun,” Timarit Mals og menningar 71, no. 2 (May 2010): 80-86; Helga Birgisdottir and Maria Bjarkadottir, “Kreppa i islenskum barnabokum”; Jon Yngvi Johannsson, “Lesid i skugga hrunsins”; Glauser, Island, 158-72; Vidar Lorsteinsson, “Fjarmalavaeding og motun timans i Konum eftir Steinar Braga,” Ritid 15, no. 3 (2015): 9-33; and the web encyclopedia of Crash literature, Hrunid, pid munid, http://hrunid.hi.is/. 33 Norddahl, “Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute,” 115. 34 For an early survey of post-Crash theatre, see Silja Adalsteinsdottir, “Dansinn i hruni: Yfirlit yfir leikhusin,” Timarit Mals og menningar 71, no. 1 (May 2010): 104-14. 45 UTRASARVIKINGAR! I am sure that many of the writers discussed here would not wish their work to be read primarily as Crash-fiction; they may justly feel that, in reading their work from this perspective, I am not judging their work on its merits. This is true. Nor were books that fit my remit necessarily straightforwardly composed in response to the Crash: zEvar Orn Josepsson’s Land tcekifceran- na was altered to refer to the unfolding crisis while in press, and Hjalmar Einarsson’s film Bodberi similarly in late stages of pro¬ duction; Steinar Bragi’s Konur and Anton Helgi Jonsson’s Ljdd eftir cettarmoti were written before the Crash but published after it; and the writing of Eirikur Orn’s own Gceska, initially about a hypothetical economic crash, was actually punctuated by the Crash itself.35 Moreover, the nimblest commentators on the Crash use it as the starting point for critiques of other ongo¬ ing issues in Icelandic politics, such as the privatization of Ice¬ land’s natural resources (Ottar M. NorSfjorcfs Attabladarosin), the commodification of Icelanders’ genes ( Lygarinn , by the same author), the industrialization of the countryside (Steinar Bragi’s HalendiS), the refugee crisis (Eirikur Orn Norddahl’s Gceska) or the rise of right-wing populism (the same writer’s Illska). Yet writers are sometimes most revealing about those subjects they address most obliquely. Analysing at least some of the novels that “turn their gaze away” was as important as probing the few that do not. One might also object that novels about the Crash written within a few years of that event could hardly be expected to offer mature, or even lasting, reflections on it. But the capac¬ ity of a literary culture to respond swiftly to the unforeseen is 35 For Land tcekifceranna, see Jakob, “Hommahatari reyndi ad drepa Hord Torfason,” Frettabladid 8, no. 287, October 20, 2008, 38; for Bodberi, Anna Bjorg Audunsdottir, “Bodberi,” Hrunid, fid munid: Gagnabanki um samtimasogu, November 2014, https://hrunid.hi.is/skaldskapur/bodberi/; for Konur, Norddahl, “Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute,” 114 and Vidar Forsteinsson “Fjarmalavasding og motun timans i Konum eftir Steinar Braga,” 9; for Ljod eftir cettarmoti, Bergljot Soffia Kristjansdottir, “‘Eg get ekkert sagt’,” 66; for Gceska Norddahl, “Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute,” 113 n. 31. Cf. Jon Yngvi Johannsson, “Lesid i skugga hrunsins.” 46 OPENING AN ACCOUNT as interesting a subject of study as the acuity of the responses themselves. The fact that Icelandic writers responded as directly and promptly to the Crash as they did is remarkable, certainly compared with literary output in the Anglophone world — and even without the “per capita” tag that is almost obligatory in measures of Icelandic achievement. How important these nov¬ els were to national discourse at the time of their publication is outside my present scope — not very, I suspect. But, as the web- encyclopedia of Crash-literature Hrunid, piS munid emphasizes, literary writing has a role in memorializing a key moment in an ongoing tale of crisis that may outlast most of the journalism or political speeches produced at the time. And at their best, Crash-novels provide some of the most striking commentary on the 2007-8 Western financial crisis generally. For want of time, I have read little of the (sometimes well informed) English-language Crash-literature that has circulat¬ ed in Iceland or been set there, important examples of which would include Sarah Prebble’s 2009 musical Enron, which was, in translation, a success in Iceland in 2010; the crime-writing of Quentin Bates; and a raff of (ghost-written) autobiographies by key players in the boom (only some of which are also avail¬ able in Icelandic), the most important of which for this study is Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson’s Billions to Bust — and Back.36 I have inevitably also failed to read lots of books with relevant but indirect commentary on the Crash. One example is Audur Ava Olafsdottir’s Afleggjarinn, published just before the Crash. Its date of publication and its focus on a young man who gives up his education to grow roses and attend to the beauty in the mundane puts it comfortably beyond my purview, yet the novel can be read as a self-conscious act of resistance to the hypermas¬ culine swashbuckling of the banking boom. This perhaps helps explain why the present book is dominated by male writers. The preponderance of male authors unquestionably partly reflects the dominance of men in Icelandic novel -writing, and bringing in more poetry and theatre might have changed the dynamic 36 On Bates see Brunsdale, Encyclopedia of Nordic Crime Fiction, 239-40. 47 UTRASARVIKINGAR! somewhat, opening up space for explicitly political work like Linda Vilhjalmsdottir’s 2015 poetry collection Frelsi or Asdls Thoroddsen’s 2009 one-woman show Odd d gjaldbuxum. But it may also be a product of my own choice to focus on literature that articulates a direct link with the Crisis. For all the renowned victories of feminism in Iceland, political-economic discourse remains predominantly mens’ domain (and my decision to seek literature which comments on politics and economics is itself no doubt characteristic of my own masculinity). Whereas Steinar Bragi has said that “man kan inte skriva om moderna islandska manniskor utan att skriva om kraschen” (“you cant write about modern Icelandic people without writing about the crash”), for example, Yrsa Sigurd ardottir, Iceland’s leading woman crime- writer, has said that corruption in Iceland often takes the form of nepotism, al¬ though recent events have brought to light double-dealing regarding money and the clandestine trading in bank and government assets. However, all these things are done in such a clumsy, greedy way that it does not spark my imagina¬ tion as a writer, and to date I have not been inclined to shift from crime committed for psychological reasons as the focus of my books.37 One suspects that these conflicting attitudes reflect gender norms. Nor do Yrsa’s words mean that women writers are nec¬ essarily apolitical writers. Among writers of the world, Icelan¬ dic women would not be alone among relatively less powerful groups in choosing to draw attention to, say, structural social inequalities, in definance of a focus in dominant media dis¬ courses on transient upheavals in parliamentary politics and high finance. AuSur Jonsdottir’s 2008 novel Vetrarsol frames its off-beat version of a murder-mystery plot with the female 37 Erik Helmerson, “Han sagar hemlandet Island,” Dagens nyheter, March 21, 2014, 5; Barry Forshaw, Death in a Cold Climate (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 137. 48 OPENING AN ACCOUNT protagonist Sunna’s attempts to juggle her work as an under- appreciated employee at a publishing house with looking after her stepson Helgi and her elderly mother. Sunna’s husband Axel spends most of the novel mysteriously absent in Isal]5rr)ur: it transpires by the end that his business has failed (not for the first time); that he was unable to admit to its problems sooner; and that, alongside everything else that Sunna has to do, she is nevertheless going to patiently steer the family through this cri¬ sis. Needless to say, the work resonates with the national crisis that took place in the year that it was published, and foreshad¬ ows the widespread sense in Iceland following the Crash that women were stepping up, yet again, to clear up men’s mess.38 Yet it also chooses to direct readers’ attention away from the history of events to the longue duree of patriarchal (and, as I discuss in §5.3.2, colonial) power structures. These observations do not invalidate my decision to study how Icelandic novellists have responded explicitly to the Crash; but we should not imagine through their limited representation here that women writers have not addressed the Crash at all. My study can only be one brick in a wall of a more holistic investigation, and had I the opportunity to begin it again, I might have started in a different place. 1.5 Themes A surprisingly wide range of the themes of this book are con¬ veyed by the joke which is its epigraph. I was told the joke while I was in Reykjavik in 2010 by someone who was almost certainly needling me about my dubious renown as one of the world’s foremost experts on elves.39 The research on medieval romance- 38 Cf. Glauser, Island, 157. See further §5.3.1 below. 39 Attributable largely to Alaric Hall, Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007). The Icelandic terms which I generally render in English as “elves” or “hidden people” are, respectively, dlfar (singular alfur) and huldufolk, which are for most Icelandic-speakers largely synonymous, cf. Unnur Jokulsdottir, Hefurdu sed huldufolk? Ferdasaga (Reykjavik: Mai og menning, 2007), 11; 49 UTRASARVIKINGAR! sagas that had brought me to Iceland had nothing to do with elves or — at least as I thought at the time — the financial crisis, so I didn’t give much thought to the joke, only remember it in English, and have not been able to rediscover who told it to me. Nor have I since found other attestations of it, so it is probably not especially representative. But it is a useful way into sum¬ marizing the themes of this book, and to sketch what kinds of insights a foreigner’s reading of Iceland’s Crash-literature might have to offer. The joke may not provoke many belly-laughs out¬ side its immediate cultural context, but in fact it covers a lot of cultural ground: modernization, local identities, tourism, and the financial crisis. Its intertexts take us beyond, into national¬ ism, gender, and ethnicity. “Anybody who writes about Iceland in English has to write about elves,” Kari Tulinius has commented ruefully.40 I assure the reader that when I was interviewed for a (rather thoughtful) piece on Icelandic elves in The Atlantic, I stated unambiguous¬ ly that no Icelander I know believes in elves, but the piece still emerged under the title “Why So Many Icelanders Still Believe in Invisible Elves,” situating it firmly in a tradition of borealizing journalism constructing the exotic, backward Icelander.41 There is much to be lamented in this tradition, and it is understand- Erlendur Haraldsson, “Psychic Experiences a Third of a Century Apart: Two Representative Surveys in Iceland with an International Comparison,” Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 75, no. 2 (2011): 76-90, at 88. Alfur is the older and, in modern usage, more literary term, with a wider semantic range, its usage extending, for example, into fantasy fiction and childrens fairy tales. Huldufolk connotes a more specific local tradition, its generic element folk emphasizing the humanness of the elves; as a euphemism, it also expresses greater respect than alfar. 40 Kari Tulinius, “So What’re These Elves I Keep Hearing About?” The Reykjavik Grapevine 12, no. 1 (January-February 2014): 10, https:// grapevine.is/ mag / column- opinion/ 2014/01/ 20/so- whatre-these-elves-i- keep-hearing-about. 41 Ryan Jacobs, “Why So Many Icelanders Still Believe in Invisible Elves,” The Atlantic, October 29, 2013, https://www.theatlantic.com/ international/ archive/2013/io/why-so-many-icelanders-still-believe-in- invisible-elves/280783. 1 owe the term “borealism” to Kristinn Schram, “Borealism: Folkloristic Perspectives on Transnational Performances and 50 OPENING AN ACCOUNT able that at about the same time, Egill Helgason, one of Iceland’s foremost cultural commentators, complained that “eg hef aldrei hitt Islending sem truir a tilveru alfa eda huldufolks — eda hefur nokkurn ahuga a slikum verum” (“I have never met an Icelander who believes in the existence of elves or hidden people — or has any interest in such beings”). Egill opined that elves are an ex¬ ample of how the tourist industry’s commodification of Icelan¬ dic culture is starting to influence Icelanders’ own self-image.42 Actually, this is by no means an unusual or abnormal process, and elves can reveal more about Icelandic society than Egill or Kari perhaps realized. Egill overlooked the fact that elves turn up fairly frequently in literature and other cultural products produced by Icelanders for Icelanders, and have done so for a long time, sometimes in sophisticated discursive roles.43 The question of whether Icelanders “believe” in elves, despite the interest shown in it by many journalists and some scholars, is for the most part a red herring: the key point is that, like early modern intellectuals contemplating demons, Icelanders find elves “good to think with.”44 the Exoticism of the North” (Ph.D. diss., University of Edinburgh, 2011); Schramm, “Banking on Borealism,” 310. 42 Egill Helgason, “Huldufolkid, lundinn og Jijodarimyndin,” Eyjan, December 23, 2013, http://eyjan.pressan.is/silfuregils/2013/12/23/ huldufolkid-lundinn-og-thjodarimyndin. 43 See below, especially §5.3. 44 Cf.

The documentary Draumalandid by Porfinnur Gudnason and Andri 51 UTRASARVIKINGAR! The implied answer to the question “why aren’t there any elves in HellisgerSi any more?” is of course “because elves don’t exist (albeit that they may once have been believed to)”: the joke comments pointedly on what we might loosely call moderniza¬ tion (specifically the rise of rationalism), and is predicated on people’s belief in a temporal disjunction between a disenchanted modernity and a more credulous past, which we might think of as Iceland’s long Middle Ages. Foreign journalism about Ice¬ landers’ elf-beliefs places Icelanders on the wrong side of this temporal boundary, and the joke resists this by being predicated on (and therefore ultimately reinforcing) the rationalist outlook of its audience. But the humor arises, of course, from this ratio¬ nalist answer proving incorrect: thus the joke probes the pos¬ sibilities of other attitudes, gently mocking reductive rationalist world-views at the same time as it reinscribes them. Moreover, the joke addresses more aspects of moderniza¬ tion than rationalism alone. The specific reference to HellisgerSi implies a critique of Iceland’s changing settlement structures. HellisgerSi is a park in HafnarfjorSur, a town now part of the Snasr Magnason, an environmentalist critique of developing massive hydroelectric powerplants for aluminium production that appeared just after the Crash and resonated strongly with the popular mood at that moment, provides a good example of how elves are a nebulous but powerful discursive strategy, rather as “heritage” is in Anglo-American public discourse. Jakob Bjornsson, the former director general of the National Energy Authority, is shown explaining that traditional ideas about the inhabitation of the Icelandic highlands by supernatural beings, which protected them from human intrusion, is “allt saman fjarstaeda” (“altogether nonsense”; 26*05”-27*n”). Trying to convince most of the audience that Iceland’s highlands are populated by elves, and that their valleys should not be flooded for this reason, would have been a hard job; the documentary for the most part takes a hard-headed (if at times alarmist) approach to making its case. But the task of disenchanting the landscape turns out to be little less challenging: giving Jakob the role of explicitly denying the existence of supernatural beings successfully makes him appear a cold-hearted opponent of Icelandic tradition and culture; he comes across as an opponent of the elves — and therefore the land and its people (cf. Andri Snasr Magnason, Dreamland: A Self-Help Manual for a Frightened Nation , trans. Nicholas Jones [London: Citizen Press, 2008], 233-34)- 52 OPENING AN ACCOUNT Reykjavik conurbation which, however, works hard to sustain an identity distinct from the capital (while being the butt of quite a lot of Icelandic humor of the “how many Hafnarfirdingar does it take to change a light bulb?” variety). HellisgerSi is sup¬ posedly inhabited by elves, a fact which is prominent in the con¬ struction of HafnarfjorSur’s identity within Icelandic-language media. They are important, for example, in Kristin Marja Bal- dursdottir’s 1996 novel Mdvahldtur, set in HafnarfjorSur, while a systematic search for “dlfar” and “huldufolk” in Iceland’s main national newspaper, Morgunbladid, since 2002 indicates that it is primarily people from HafnarfjorSur who have expressed some degree of personal belief in huldufolk in this mainstream public forum.45 This complicates Arni Bjornsson’s claim that in¬ sofar as Icelanders today do believe in elves, we are dealing with the cultural category of mysticism rather than anything that can helpfully be called “popular belief.”46 Rather, both the joke and Morgunbladid’ s interviews indicate that whether people actually “believe” in elves is not the point: rather, discourses of belief in elves are one way for HafnarfirSingar to articulate a local identi¬ ty distinct from that of the capital. Elves function in this respect partly as means to resist a centralizing state, urbanization, and the growing cultural dominance of Reykjavik. Icelanders are not the only audience for HafnarijorSur’s promotion of HellisgerSi as an elf-habitat, however: this is also prominent in HafnarfjorSur’s promotion of itself to foreign tourists. The roadsign that marks the limits of the town to any¬ one who takes the main road to Reykjavik from Iceland’s inter¬ national airport at Keflavik, illustrated with a tongue-in-cheek 45 Marta Maria Jonsdottir, “Gatan min Austurgata i Hafnarfirdi: Undir hraunbruninni i midbasnum,” Morgunbladid: Finnur.is, April 19, 2012, 13; Marta Maria Jonsdottir, “Hafnarfjordur er alltaf f>orp,” Morgunbladid: Finnur.is, July 19, 2012, 13. 46 Arni Bjornsson, “Hvad merkir f)jodtru?” 91-92; cf. Unnur Jokulsdottir, Hefurdu sed huldufolk?, 273; a straightforward example of Icelandic- language mysticism in relation to Hafnarfjordur s elves is Erla Stefansdottir, Hulidsheimakort [Map of hidden worlds] (Hafnarfjordur: Ferdamalanefnd Hafnarijardar, [1993]). 53 UTRASARVIKINGAR! roadsign- silhouette of two dancing elves in the German- Ameri¬ can tradition of Christmas elves, reads “town of elves | alfa- b^erinn.” The English text, placed first, suggests the primary audience for this announcement. Hellisgerdi is also home to the company AlfagarSurinn, which sells elf-tours and elf-themed souvenirs to tourists. The joke is predicated on this information: the reason why the elves of Hellisgerdi want peace and quiet is implicitly that they are fed up with tourists stamping around their neighbourhood. This constructs the elves less as rural re¬ cluses than as everyday people who do not of necessity live in mysterious volcanic rocks. While the punchline embraces the elves’ existence, then, the joke still succeeds in constructing the tourists who come to see the elves in Hellisgerdi as credulous blunderers. The irritated elves of the joke, in this case, stand as a figure for Icelanders themselves: in seeking peace and quiet, the implication is that the elves are doing precisely what any good Icelander would want to do themselves; and as I discuss below, the use of the elf to represent the “true Icelander” is a well rooted and widespread tradition in Iceland.47 The joke encodes Icelanders’ understandable irritation at being made a specta¬ cle — whether by the world’s media via coverage of the Crash, by the continual enthusiasm for reporting Icelanders as freaks who believe in elves, or more specifically by tourists within Iceland, particularly in the wake of the Crash, when the falling krona encouraged a dramatic increase in tourism at a point when the Icelandic self-image and sense of independence was particularly bruised but when Iceland needed this foreign revenue most.48 It is no accident that the tongue-in-cheek, Crash-themed detective novel Syslumadurinn sem sa dlfa (“The Sheriff who Saw Elves”) opens with a pointed critique of some Swedish tourists mocking the outlandish attire of an Icelandic protagonist troubled (but 47 §5-3-4- 48 On international coverage of the Crash see Daniel Chartier, The End of Iceland’s Innocence: The Image of Iceland in the Foreign Media During the Financial Crisis, trans.

The message of the joke’s punchline is that elves may be real, but that does not mean they are there to be a tourist attraction. And what does it mean that HelligerSi’s elves move to the neighbouring suburb of Kopavogur? This could simply be be¬ cause Kopavogur is, like Hafnarfjordur, prominently associated with elves. However, in the wake of the financial crisis, I under¬ stood the joke differently: parts of this district were especially associated during the boom with expensive building projects aimed at Iceland’s nouveau riche, which were left unfinished or unsold during the property crash that accompanied the finan¬ cial one. In this reading, then, the reason why the irritated elves of Hellisgerdi move to Kopavogur for peace and quiet is that it offers a plentiful supply of plush, empty flats. The joke thus suggests discursive connections between elves, the financial cri¬ sis, and its associated building boom. Indeed, buildings of this kind turn up repeatedly in Crash -themed fiction as a figure for the misogynistic masculinity of the boom and its erosion of do¬ mesticity.49 Meanwhile, the use of elves as a discursive strategy to critique new building projects is well embedded in modern Icelandic culture: as Valdimar Tr. Hafstein found in his analysis of 1990s memorates and urban legends about Icelandic elves, “narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate super¬ natural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture.”50 The fact that the Hellis- gerdi joke can be read as having elves moving into the sorts of buildings which writers repeatedly criticise, then, might even be taken to construct the otherness of these places, expressing their unheimlich character: these buildings are “unhomely” in the lit¬ eral sense, and so a fitting home for supernatural beings whose otherworldliness makes them unheimlich in the Freudian sense of “uncanny.” Moreover, in this reading, the joke takes a utopian 49 See §5.3. 50 Hafstein, “The Elves’ Point of View,” 92-93. 55 UTRASARVIKINGAR! step: unimpeded by an economic and legal framework which has ceased to serve society, elves are able to act with prudence to make the best use of the resources locked away from ordi¬ nary people by artificial structures of credit and debt. They are a means to imagine possible realities beyond capitalism. As Einar Mar Gudmundsson comments in his Islenskir kongar, folk sem adur truSi a alfa og drauga truir nii a vaentingavfsi- tolur og verdbolguspar. Svo er haegt ad vedsetja fiskana i sjo- num og sla lan ut a [Da. ban nig er hagkerfid einsog dulspeki, miklir galdrar a sveimi, kannski tofraraunsaei.51 People who once believed in elves and ghosts now believe in consumer confidence and inflation forecasts. Thus you can mortgage the fish in the sea and take out a loan against them. So the economy is a kind of mysticism, enormous spells swirling, perhaps magical realism. This returns us to the basic premise of the joke: moderns who construct themselves as rational and progressive by contrasting themselves with their backwards ancestors are deluding them¬ selves. It is people who believed in elves but who understood the value — rather than the price — of fish who were the more clear¬ sighted, and both Einar Mar and the joke hint that in a return to an earlier mode of being there lies the possibility of rectifying the madnesses of the present. This book explores all these themes in post-Crash Icelandic literature. The only key theme that the joke does not cover — and it is a key theme — is that in the novels analysed for this study, an interest in Iceland’s medieval literature and its folklore is al¬ most always articulated alongside another kind of medievalism: an Orientalist, dystopian medievalism that has risen to promi¬ nence following the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, which labels much of the Islamic world “still medieval,” and 51 Einar Mar Gudmundsson, Islenskir kongar [Icelandic kings] (Reykjavik: Mai og menning, 2012), 12. 56 OPENING AN ACCOUNT abjects it as unable to belong to modernity. The interactions of these two medievalisms are so widespread in the novels studied for this book that one can clearly not be understood without the other, and understanding the relationship between the two proves important for interpreting Icelandic culture in the wake of the Crash. Before grappling with Iceland’s use and abuse of its medieval and traditional culture, however, I examine some key reasons why Crash literature has managed to say so little about the Crash itself. 57 2 The Crisis of Realism 2.1 Form Crashes Astin min, a hverjum morgni vakna eg og aetla ad yrkja til Jiin ljdd.

My beloved, each morning I wake and plan to compose you poems. They come to me as I dream, clear as the birdsong of summer, beautiful as the moon through the trees. I see the gleaming sunset, the heavens and the oceans. In the dark, someone laughs, someone cries. Sometimes all this comes to me, sometimes reality awakens and then were done with thinking about the financial markets, the privatizations and this helvitis fokking fokk, the injustice, the situation, because 59 UTRASARVIKINGAR! by then we’ll be done putting constraints on the financial markets, telling privatization where to stick it, and taking the gadgets offline. Then we’ll compose about the splendor of love, the beauty of the sky and the songs of the birds; but the hammer-blows of reality keep resounding. They resound out through society, within you, within me, everywhere. So Einar Mar Gubin undsson begins the second of his essay- collections on the Crash, Bankastrceti null.1 This ostentatiously formal opening evokes the literary form of the mansongur (liter¬ ally, “maiden-song”): in the rlmur, the long narrative poems that dominated Icelandic literary production from around the six¬ teenth century into nineteenth, each new section ( rlma ) of the poem conventionally opened with a mansongur. The poet tradi¬ tionally laments that his art is insufficient to please the maiden who is the object of his affections, but frequently also takes the opportunity to lament the state of the world, and particularly the vanity of worldly glories. Thus Einar Mar’s prose reinvention of the mansongur situates his account of the greed and corrup¬ tion exposed by the Crash in a deep and distinctively Icelandic literary history. Modesty topoi usually serve, disingenuously, as a platform for writers to display their virtuosity, and Einar Mar’s opening is no exception: it indicates that he could perfectly well be writing poetry, whether for his supposed beloved or about the Crash, but has chosen the medium of the essay instead. Even so, Einar Mar’s mansongur is still at one level an apolo¬ gy from a man who is perhaps Iceland’s pre-eminent literary au¬ thor for not writing a novel about the Crash.2 His point that an economic crisis is not conducive to poetry is an interesting and a serious one, and is not unique to Iceland.3 It reflects the wide¬ spread sense that art seems suddenly insufficient to the task in hand: what Mark Fisher has labelled as art’s confinement within 1 Einar Mar Gudmundsson, Bankastrceti null (Reykjavik: Mai og menning, 201l), 7. 2 Though his 2012 Islenskir kongar was later to address it. 3 See for example Benjamin Kunkel, Utopia or Bust: A Guide to the Present Crisis (London: Verso, 2014), 1-21. 60 THE CRISIS OF REALISM a “capitalist realism” and Amitav Ghosh has, in his discussion of novels’ failure to address climate change, called our “great derangement.”4 Turning to the Rannsoknarskyrslu Alpingis, the at times strangely gripping 2010 government report on the fi¬ nancial crisis, Einar Mar pointed out that “rithofundur sem [ . . . ] hefSi latid ser detta i hug allt sem stendur i Rannsoknarskyrslu Alpingis hefSi veriS talinn skyjaglopur” (“an author who [...] had allowed himself to dream up everything that is contained in the Rannsoknarskyrslu Alpingis would have been considered to have his head in the clouds”).

In Iceland, reality is like a new literary form. It beats all lit¬ erature. Radical surrealists sound like pragmatic old women, crime novels like nursery rhymes, and fantasy stories have no imaginative power to compare with the utrdsarvlkingar.5 As Eirikur Orn Norbdahl put it, “perhaps this lack of ‘crisis’ in the ‘crisis-literature’ is mainly a symptom of another ‘crisis’, namely the lack of agency in contemporary literature which for too long may have been busy picking at its own bellybutton and now knows not what to do.”6 The purpose of this chapter, then, is to add a case-study to the growing body of work documenting how, in the wake of the Crash, reality indeed generally outpaced Icelandic fiction’s imaginative capacity, to examine how and why 4 Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?

(Helsinki: Poesia, 2011), 114. 61 UTRASARVIKINGAR! art has been struggling to keep pace with politics in recent de¬ cades in the West. Fiction ought, after all, to be good at dealing with money, which as a social reality is itself a kind of fiction. Although dif¬ ferent theories of money conceptualize the relationship between money and debt in different ways, money is usually thought inherently to imply debt, and therefore credit. Etymologically, credit links money intimately with belief — as implied by Marx’s infamous and provocative phrase Kredit und fiktives Kapital (“credit and fictitious capital”).7 Money is real: it cannot be wished away, and has real effects in the world; it is not, in this respect, fiction. Nonetheless, its reality depends on a critical mass of individuals’ belief, and it is notionally within society’s power to reconceive it. A financial transaction is rather like a speech act, in which representation makes reality, never more so than in an age of purely digital transactions. The stock-market indices, business newspapers, annual reports, and even novels that La Berge groups together as “financial print culture” reveal “a logic of the sinews of finance itself, as it stakes out spaces of textual representation and then metabolizes them into sites of profit, loss, and value.”8 Accordingly, a number of prominent left-leaning non-fiction works arising from the financial crisis attempt to explain or explore the crisis with reference to folk¬ lore, myths, or fiction. Marx talked about vampires, and zom¬ bies now lurch through the language of mainstream economics.9 Super-abundance of credit is the Grimm Brothers’ The Sweet Porridge (about a magic porridge pot that produces too much porridge), America’s hunger for imports is the Cretan Minotaur (with its insatiable demand for human sacrifice), and the Euro¬ crisis is the paradoxical encounter between Laelaps (who never failed to catch her prey) and the Teumessian Fox (who could 7 Karl Marx, Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Oekonomie, 3 vols.
