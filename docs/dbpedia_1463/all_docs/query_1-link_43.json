        "text": "EDINBURG – University of Texas-Pan American women's basketball head coach Larry Tidwell announced on Monday the signing of 6-0 forward Hildur Björg Kjartansdóttir, a member of the Icelandic National Team, to a National Letter of Intent for the 2014-15 season.\n\nKjartansdóttir has played in five games in national team play, averaging 11.4 points and 8.8 rebounds per game with the U-18 team.\n\nShe spent the last four seasons with Snafell of the Icelandic League. This past season, Kjartansdóttir averaged 15.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game while earning All-Star honors and leading her team to its first postseason cup championship. She was also named the best young player on her team.\n\n\"I'm very excited to come to Edinburg and to play for the UTPA Broncs,\" Kjartansdóttir said. \"Moving to Edinburg will be a life changing experience for me. I hope to learn new things and to grow both as a player and a person.\"\n\nIn 2012-13, Kjartansdóttir averaged 15.4 points and 8.1 rebounds per game while shooting 60.3 percent from inside the arc. She started in the All-Star game, scoring 12 points and grabbing four rebounds. She also led her team to the preseason cup championship.\n\nIn 2011-12, Kjartansdóttir averaged 10.3 points and 5.8 rebounds while earning awards as the best young player on her team and having the best sportsmanship. She also led the U-20 team to the cup championship while serving as captain of the U-18 team. She played for both of those teams in 2010-11 as well, while starting for the U-16 team in 2009-10.\n\n\"Hildur will bring a very versatile game to our team as she shoots it extremely well, rebounds with authority, and can convert in transition,\" Tidwell said. \"She led her team to the Icelandic Cup Championship and is currently playing on the Icelandic National Team. She has served as captain of both squads, so she has proven to have leadership qualities. Hildur will make an immediate impact on the 2014-15 Broncs.\"\n\nSupport UTPA Women's Basketball | Become a Fan on Facebook | Follow the Broncs on Twitter | Follow the Broncs on Instagram | Follow the Broncs on YouTube"
