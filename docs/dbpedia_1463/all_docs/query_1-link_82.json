        "text": "Grab a coffee. This was a crazy week.\n\nWhere do I even begin with a festival like Iceland Airwaves? Do I start with the lineup? Maybe list the massive local talent first? Or start with the big names? I could simply start with a description of one of the trippiest music venues out there: Harpa Concert Hall. I mean, the whole building literally lights up and changes color. It’s fantastic.\n\nInstead, I’m just going to get right into it.\n\n*Deep breath*\n\nThis year I was lucky enough to be able to work for Iceland Airwaves at the Media Center. I was charged with handling the Iceland Airways flight and ticket packages. This allowed me to meet people from all over the world coming to this obscure sounding country for a wacky little festival and every last one of them was absolutely delighted to be here. I’ve heard the festival be compared to South by SouthWest in Austin, TX, in that the festival envelopes the city in both official events, referred to at Airwaves as “on-venue,” and hundreds of un-official parties known as “off-venue.” With a structure like this there are those that opt to go ticketless and bounce around the off-venue parties all week. This is not a bad strategy if you’ve already seen most of the bands on the lineup (you’re going to have to explain how you managed that, though), but it’s risky since there are SO many acts with many being added close to show time for strictly on-venue shows. The festival also always seems to sell out and has special concerts on the final day that are only accessible if you’ve got yourself a fancy-pants wristband. And as far as festivals go the tickets for Iceland Airwaves are quite affordable clocking it at just over $150 for five days of awesome.\n\nThis year I caught a lot more crazy, unexpected shows than last year. I highly recommend bringing as many friends as possible or making as many new friends as possible because the insane variety of music is hard to comprehend. It helps to have lots of weird friends suggesting things you’ve never heard of and pretty soon you find yourself at what you assume is the only punk show happening in Iceland at that time complete with Viking-sized mosh pit and out-of-place tourists taking selfies in the front row (Eh-hem. You’re doing it wrong). This was in direct contrast to one of the highlight performances of my festival experience: the incredible Klangkarussell. These guys delivered nothing but good vibrations, groovy tunes, and that one track that every sings along to. Wonderful! During the set we bump into a group of friends who were on their way to a club called Dolly, which sounded like a good idea to us, so off we went!\n\nNow, this particular club would typically be playing dance music but was strangely committed to hip-hop all night. Not usually my cup of tea but somehow I knew every song so I bought myself a Viking lager with my 900ISK (~$7) and headed to the dance floor. We ended up staying until we were asked to leave on account of the club closing at half five in the morning. Quickly, we bought our final beers and headed into the streets. CAUSE YOU CAN DO THAT HERE. AMAZING.\n\nIn said streets people are pouring out of every bar and club because around here, no one leaves before they are literally locking the doors. Once everywhere willing to sell you alcohol is officially closed, however, you will hear folks calling into the night for an afterparty (any afterparty!) in about a dozen languages. And though I turned down Kevin from New Zealand and his new BFF, Mark, from Germany, on their offer to take my friends and I to an afterparty whose location they were too drunk to explain, the night was considered a success. We ended up partying just a little more with people we actually knew (always a good choice) until I realized I had to work back at the festival in T-minus 4 hours. Oops.\n\nSaturday started a bit more slowly on account of the night before but we managed to make it through a full day of work at the Media Center before heading back into the madness. On my schedule for this particular night was The Knife, whose performance was rumored to be their last. Also on my list were whole host of artists I failed to see because that’s the Iceland Airwaves way: plan nothing and let the universe take you. You won’t be able to stop it anyway.\n\nIf you wanted to ensure you’d be getting into Harpa for The Knife’s performance you had to queue pretty early. Luckily I was armed with my I-worked-at-the-festival-so-can-I-please-cut-the-line-wristband, which you always feel terrible about using until you see an hour-long queue outside the artist you’re trying to see and then you don’t care so much anymore. Even with this wristband, however, if the venue is at capacity, you are SOL so it’s still important to manage your time according.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, my friend Dassy and I decide to do a little pre-gaming at a place called Slipbarinn for no reason other than we were gifted with yet another lovely wristband that allowed us to get free things, and everyone loves free things. These particular free things were a choice of two alcoholic beverages and two food options. The booze was between a nice cold can of the Icelandic lager Gull or a cocktail using Airwaves sponsor Brennivin made especially for you by the folks at Slipbarinn. This cocktail, according to the Brennivin website, was an “amazing taragon and horseradish infused Brennivin cocktail that comes in a limited run of special 11 oz. bottles we made just for Airwaves.” I initially opted for the cocktail, which was served in the aforementioned bottles with a neon straw, but I couldn’t quite past Brennivin’s incredibly strong liquorice flavor. So I switched to good ol’ Gull (fun fact: Gull is not pronounced like the English “gull.” The double “ll” in Icelandic is supposed to be something like a “tl” but it sort of sounds like a bit of a “k” to me. It’s hard). The food choices were between a meatball noodle dish and a mozzarella pesto Panini. Neither were hot but both were reportedly pretty delicious, especially by free food standards.\n\nAt Slipbarinn we run into some friends Gylfi and Erling (suspiciously enjoying their Brennivin cocktails). We had already seen both of them play twice in one band called Ojba Rasta and another called Sin Fang. Tonight, Gylfi would be playing drums in a band called Retro Stefson, and, inspired by running into Gylfi we decide to add them to the roster that night. Our friend departs to prepare for his performance and the rest of us mosey over to Harpa to catch the end of Samaris before The Knife.\n\nSamaris ends up being really cool. The singer seemed so sweet. She didn’t speak much, and I believe all the lyrics were in Icelandic, but when she did speak English it was adorable and enlightening about everything being an ocean and waves or something. Anyway, I loved it. Too bad it felt a little like everyone was waiting for The Knife.\n\nAfter Samaris finished their performance, a woman wearing 80’s workout attire appeared on stage. This woman looked both fabulous and insane. She informed us that she would be our preshow warm-up instructor and that we would be doing something called “D.E.E.P. Aerobics.” D.E.E.P. stood for “death electric emo protest.” Seriously. It sounds totally batty, and it is, but it was oddly unifying. The whole thing was about how we would all be dancing together and to get rid of our self-consciousness about our space or our bodies or whatever. We started by doing different chants and movements. One chant was “Self-consciousness is the illusion that this is only happening to me!” I loved that one. It was such an incredible way to start a performance. Another chant was “I am not a man! I am not a woman! I am both! I am neither! If you don’t like it, take a breather!” I knew I had to be in for a treat if this is how The Knife began their sets…\n\n…but the room was filled with entirely too many tall, beautiful people and I couldn’t see a damn thing. I also didn’t really understand the whole bit about The Knife. Like, I didn’t know the singers were not part of The Knife, but sometimes the girl from The Knife was singing even though you couldn’t see her? I don’t know. It was totally cool but a little confusing. I felt like I needed a pamphlet to explain it. We stuck it out for about half the set, which really did sound amazing in combination with a rather spectacular light show. I heard Björk even made an appearance because, Iceland. We ended up making our way over to another room at Harpa to see Hozier, an Irish singer with an awesome band and about a thousand guitars. Hozier seemed to command the room in a really particular way. His voice was really effortless and his band equally as talented as he. I’m really satisfied that I let Dassy convince me to see this artist who I would have otherwise overlooked.\n\nNext it was time for Retro Stefson. This performance was collectively their ninth time playing at Airwaves. The first time they played they were between the ages of 13 and 16. I don’t know what I was doing between those ages but it wasn’t creating one of the most well known Icelandic bands in recent memory. Their music is really upbeat and clever dance music. You can’t help but dance with a smile on your face when they play, and they play very well. They even have a girl, Þorbjörg Roach Gunnarsdóttir (easy), rocking synthesizer in the form of a kind of keytair?! It’s awesome. These kids are undoubtedly cooler than you and you’ll just have to see it (and hear it) to believe it.\n\nWe party well into the night, as expected. We make friends, fall in and out of love, and wander home amongst the piles of trash in the streets that would be mysteriously gone by morning. The fifty-something tourists will have no idea what happened just hours before the start of their Golden Circle tour.\n\nFinally, Sunday evening arrives. This only meant one thing: The Flaming Lips. I really have to confess I knew almost nothing about The Flaming Lips other than they are one of those bands that everyone tells me I would really love. I simply knew this was the show that people had flown in from all over the world specifically for which guaranteed amazing energy, which in turn guaranteed a truly memorable evening. Let me just tell you, before we go any further, that The Flaming Lips did not disappoint. Holy crap. How did I get this far in life without having this experience?! Do yourself a favor and go see The Flaming Lips next time they’re in town. There were insane props, lights, so much glitter, and so many good vibes. I can’t even describe it. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to go see them.\n\nI was also lucky enough to catch the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra perform a piece by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. The piece scored a film by Bill Morrison on the intense industrial past of North East England. It was a rare treat at a music festival like Airwaves, at which the days can easily blur together.\n\nOther honorable mentions include the always-reliable FM Belfast. Their performance is just one insane dance party. They always bring streamers (yay!), their clothes light up, and they dance the whole time. Their voices are amazing, their music is infectious and the whole band is filled with an endless energy. Never miss a chance to see FM Belfast. I have caught them half a dozen times now and they never disappoint.\n\nMoses Sumney was a total accident for me. Some friends wanted to check out the singer songwriter from LA so I went a long. Moses was incredible. His voice is really beautiful and strong and he plays around with looping and some electronic elements. He received an extended standing ovation to which he had to come out and explain that he would be crying tears of joy in response to the love he received during his performance.\n\nMugison, Ásgeir, and the always-wonderful Teitur Magnusson were all just incredible. I recommend checking out each of the artists mentioned in this post and have put together a little playlist of some of my favorites for your convenience:\n\nThank you, Iceland Airwaves 2014, ya did good.\n\nIf any of this sounds like a good time to you (and let’s be serious, I couldn’t even get into half of it here) the festival dates for next year are November 4th – 8th 2015. Tickets are on sale starting December 1st over at http://www.icelandairwaves.is"
