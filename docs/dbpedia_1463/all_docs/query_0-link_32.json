        "text": "21:58 | FULL-TIME\n\nGermany 24:30 Croatia\n\nAnd so Croatia leave us with a victory, and Germany, like Sweden and Denmark, must pick themselves up from a loss before the semi-finals. It became the Dominik Kuzmanovic show in the second half as he ended things with 22 saves (48 per cent). He was, of course, voted as Grundfos Player of the Match.\n\nIgor Karacic had one of his best games of the tournament, scoring six goals out of 10 attempts, while Johannes Golla and Sebastian Heymann both scored four for Germany.\n\n21:50\n\nDavid Späth saves - his sixth, with his stats identical now to Andy Wolff from the first half - but Dominik Kuzmanovic stops his 19th shot and then his 20th, and Croatia lead 26:22.\n\n21:47\n\nJuri Knorr, Johannes Golla, Julian Köster and Timo Kastening are all back on as Croatia extend their lead. Evidently Alfred Gislason will not let Croatia just take the win.\n\nGoran Perkovac calls a timeout when Germany score their first goal in five minutes, at 20:25.\n\n21:40\n\nAs fatigue grows the transitions are getting slower, but Croatia are riding it out more successfully and have just taken a 22:10 lead.\n\nVote now for the Grundfos Player of the Match.\n\n21:34\n\nGermany are having to fight harder for their goals than Croatia as Dominik Kuzmanovic, backed by a good Croatian defence, continues to make saves - now up to 14 (47 per cent). There's an opportunity to level again as Lovro Mihic causes a penalty and Timo Kastening easily nets it, so it's 17:17.\n\n21:26\n\nAlfred Gislason is resting many of his first-choice players while Goran Perkovac continues to use his. Germany will need the likes of Juri Knorr to be on top form on Friday against Denmark. That said, the hosts remain level with Croatia as David Späth takes over from Andy Wolff in goal and produces two saves inside five minutes. We've been so spoiled with the goalkeeping throughout the tournament!\n\nit's 15:15.\n\n21:21\n\nJust 30 minutes left in the main round.\n\n21:17\n\nTHW Kiel star Domagoj Duvnjak definitely had the biggest cheer of all the Croatians when they came on court, and although the crowd are very much backing Germany, Duvnjak is popular.\n\n21:08 | HALF-TIME\n\nGermany 14:13 Croatia\n\nIt's been a big first half for German left back Sebastian Heymann, who's scored three goals and been involved in defence too. Rune Dahmke has also been more present than he has in previous matches.\n\nDespite Dominik Kuzmanovic's best efforts, Germany lead into the break.\n\nEHF journalist Adrian Costeiu gives his half-time assessment for the final time in this main round:\n\n\"This was supposed to be a crunch match for Germany. But they got an unexpected boost after Austria and Hungary lost earlier in the LANXESS arena, which meant that they were already through to the semi-finals before throw off. That prompted some changes in the squad, with Justus Fischer, Renars Uscins and Philipp Weber featuring more prominently in this match than in the previous ones.\n\nAs expected, Germany rested some of their starters, such as Juri Knorr, who played only eight minutes, but another key player, Andreas Wolff, had once again an good outing, saving six shots for a 32 per cent saving efficiency. As Croatia cannot leapfrog any opponent, they will finish sixth in the standings, but they at least give a good run for their money to Germany, who look satisfied with their semi-finals berth.\"\n\n21:02\n\nA turnaround in fortunes for Germany, sparked when Domagoj Duvnjak hit the post. Goals for Sebastian Heymann and Justus Fischer, with a turnover by Filip Glavaš in between, has helped the hosts get level again. It's 13:13 coming towards the end of the half.\n\n20:29\n\nCroatia lead 13:10 with plenty of their players managing to score. A number of the Germans have also scored, but Dominik Kuzmanovic is currently on a 44 per cent save rate and is racking them up, while Andy Wolff is now struggling a little more.\n\n20:51\n\nFor the second time tonight we have a game of two goalkeepers, with both Andy Wolff and Dominik Kuzmanovic at the top of their games. Croatia lead 8:7, after a few too many mistakes from Germany.\n\n20:47\n\nGermany find themselves two men down with almost simultaneous suspensions of Christoph Steinert and Sebastian Heymann. As Croatia take a 7:6 lead it's going to be a tough two minutes for the hosts.\n\n20:44\n\nWe have a very level game on our hands, at 6:6 into the 12th minute.\n\n20:35\n\nAndy Wolff just thrives on this atmosphere - three shots faced, two saved, and we've only just got to the three-minute mark. Dominik Kuzmanovic also saved the first shot which came his way.\n\nScoring first for both teams are their young backs, Luka Klarica for Croatia and Juri Knorr for Germany. Both have been very important for their sides throughout the EHF EURO 2024.\n\n20:25\n\nThe head-to-head balance lies in Croatia's favour, with eight wins to Germany's three; at the EHF EURO, Croatia have won four games and Germany only one. Croatia won by a single goal in the last two meetings - at the EHF EURO 2020, and in Cologne at the 2019 IHF Men's World Championship.\n\n20:15\n\nAbsolutely no surprises in tonight's rosters for Germany and Croatia - both are coming with as full strength as they can. Timo Kastening is recovered from being ill and is back, with Lukas Zerbe in the stands.\n\nFollow everything here: Germany vs Croatia\n\n20:00\n\nThere's one more match in the main round and they throw off in 30 minutes! Croatia have nothing to lose; Germany will want to continue making their fans happy and keep a good run into the semi-finals.\n\n19:38\n\nAs Germany enter the arena to warm up, take a moment to find out why they're now confirmed as semi-finalists thanks to EHF journalist Adrian Costeiu's match review.\n\n19:36 | FULL-TIME\n\nFrance 35:32 Hungary\n\nFrance go into the semi-finals unbeaten, and take Germany with them; Hungary will play the 5/6 placement match.\n\nIt wasn't a vintage performance from France, they did just what they needed to. Better attack from Hungary, and better defence in the first half, would have helped them to the win they needed so much.\n\nNédim Rémili is the Grundfos Player of the Match, scoring seven times from seven attempts, and adding four assists. He's also the top scorer.\n\n19:20\n\nWe're now well into the last five minutes of the game, and France keep leading by two or three goals - as has been the case throughout, they are scoring more quickly and have had less possession than their opponents, and hold a scoring efficiency of 68 per cent compared to 59 per cent for Hungary.\n\nChema Rodriguez has taken a timeout with France up 32:29.\n\n19:12\n\nTen minutes to go: the game remains tilted in France's favour, but not by much - they lead 27:24. There have been bigger turnarounds. Defensively, the Olympic champions are still dominant.\n\nMake sure you vote for the Grundfos Player of the Match on the Home of Handball app.\n\n19:07\n\nHungary are winning some penalties, but not scoring them - both seven-metre throws this half have hit the post. But Arián Andó also makes a great penalty save against Kentin Mahé, so these things go both ways. France lead 25:23.\n\n19:05\n\nFrance toughen up their defence again and manage to regain a slender lead - 24:22, after 12 minutes.\n\n18:58\n\nHungary's goalkeeper Arián Andó is inspired at the start of the second half and a string of saves made it a level game at 20:20. Andó, who plays for Füredi KSE and is 24 years old, had just seven international caps prior to this tournament, but the pressure of helping Hungary to a crucial win does not seem to be bothering him.\n\n18:50\n\nAs usual, France rotate their squad for the second half, with Valentin Porte, Dylan Nahi, Kentin Mahé, Karl Konan and Timothey N'Guessan all starting alongside Dika Mem.\n\n18:37 | HALF-TIME\n\nFrance 20:18 Hungary\n\nWith all but one Hungarian player taking the court, they have managed to get themselves back into the game after a terrible period in the middle of the first half when France looked like they would run off with the victory.\n\nEHF journalist Adrian Costeiu has thoughts about the teams' performances:\n\n\"France were on the brink of breaking their record of goals scored in the first half at the EHF EURO against Hungary, but eventually they needed to be satisfied with only the best outing in this edition of the European premium competition, in a match which has no consequences for Guillaume Gille’s side. But the reigning Olympic champions jumped at the chance to deliver another excellent match, as right-handed backs Dika Mem and Nedim Remili scored 10 goals between them.\n\nHungary, who have failed so far to meet the 80 per cent attacking efficiency delivered by France, now have only 30 minutes to turn the match on its head and extend their semi-final chances. Fail to win here and they will be out of contention, as neither the draw, nor the loss helps them. But how can they do it? It will be difficult, but there are two reasons why they are in this situation: first, their goalkeepers combined for two saves. And then, the attack must get better, with the 62 per cent efficiency being insufficient. But right now, Hungary are out and Germany are into the semi-finals in Cologne.\"\n\n18:30\n\nArián Andó makes a save as Hungary mount a mini-comeback, closing to 16:20 from 14:20. They are moving a little faster and it's paying off.\n\n18:25\n\nFrance lead 17:13 and have scored six out of six fast break goals - when they get the ball, they are off and Hungary's defence is way too slow to counter it. If they have the chance to form a proper defence, Hungary are capable of withstanding the French attack, but France are not giving them the opportunity.\n\n18:20\n\nThree out of three for Dika Mem in the first 15 minutes - nice work.\n\n18:17\n\nChema Rodriguez calls Hungary's first timeout after a series of mistakes gives France a 12:9 lead. Among the changes, a first appearance for goalkeeper Arián Andó this tournament after only one save for László Bartucz up to now.\n\n18:12\n\nA 3:0 run for France has now put them ahead, 9:8, with 11 minutes gone.\n\n18:10\n\nThis is a fast-paced game with neither side wasting time on the transition. Hungary continue to have the upper hand, leading by one or two goals depending on who's got possession at any given moment.\n\n18:05\n\nNédim Rémili fumbles a pass to Elohim Prandi, Bence Imre steals the ball, and races to a 4:1 lead for Hungary - this is exactly what the Hungarians need.\n\n18:01\n\nOff they go, and it's a fast throw-off with two quick attacks by both teams, with a save and a goal for both too.\n\n17:45\n\nWe're expecting the arena to be solidly behind France today - not a usual situation for German fans, but they do need France to win!\n\nHere's the match ticker: France vs Hungary\n\n17:30\n\nAnd so we move on to another important game. If Hungary lose or draw to France, Germany are certain to go to the semi-finals regardless of the outcome of their match. If Hungary win, Germany must draw with or beat Croatia.\n\nFrance are playing without Nikola Karabatic, Samir Bellahcene and Benoit Kounkoud. Hungary are without Dominik Mathe, Kristóf Palacsics, and Zsolt and Bence Krakovski.\n\n17:21\n\nSo that's the last we'll see of both those teams, but what a tournament they've given us - full of thrills and fantastic handball. EHF journalist Adrian Costeiu recaps the match.\n\n17:09 | FULL-TIME\n\nAustria 24:26 Iceland\n\nAustria will not be playing the semi-finals here. But it was a good performance by both teams - a bit scrappy, as often happens at the end of a tournament, but full of grit.\n\nConstantin Möstl receives his fourth Grundfos Player of the Match award for making 20 saves (44 per cent). Viktor Hallgrímsson ends with 13 (46 per cent). Sigvaldi Gudjonsson is top scorer with eight goals from eight shots, while Tobias Wagner scored seven from 10.\n\n17:02\n\nAustria lose Lukas Hutecek, their hardest-working player, for the final 80 seconds as he's suspended. Viggó Kristjánsson scores and Iceland have a 26:24 lead going into the final minute - is it enough?\n\n16:59\n\nIt's very difficult to stop Tobias Wagner when he wants to shoot, and he's scored seven goals today.\n\n16:56\n\nHeading into the 25th minute Boris Zivkovic scores for Austria, and in the transition Elliði Viðarsson receives his third two-minute suspension and is off for the rest of the game.\n\n16:51\n\nAron Pálmarsson regains the lead for Iceland, but they can't extend it further as Constantin Möstl makes his 18th (yes, eighteenth!) save of the game. After a drought for Iceland the goals are now coming faster and easier, perhaps as the Austrian defenders become more fatigued. It's 21:20 to Iceland right now.\n\n16:47\n\nViktor Hallgrímsson has been replaced by Björgvin Pall Gustavsson after making only a couple of saves in this half. It's still very level with 11 minutes to play.\n\n16:43\n\nIt's again a level game at 17:17.\n\nYou can vote for the Grundfos Player of the Match in the Home of Handball app!\n\n16:40\n\nAustria has a 16:15 lead and Iceland have not scored for well over 10 minutes. Mistakes are creeping into the Icelandic game and they can't seem to stop them.\n\n16:35\n\nWhat a turnaround! At the end of the first half, Iceland were running away with the game, but now, Austria have closed back up to 14:15 and Iceland's attack has fallen apart. Four saves from Constantin Möstl to one for Viktor Hallgrímsson doesn't hurt either. Iceland have taken a timeout.\n\n16:28\n\nThis has been an excellent start to the second half by Austria, whose defence has tightened. It's 4:1 in the six minutes since the restart to the Austrians.\n\n16:22\n\nThe Icelandic attack is flowing - what tools does Ales Pajovic have to stop it? We haven't seen much seven-on-six yet tonight and that may well happen, if the tired Austrian legs allow it. Once again, Austria's key players - Lukas Hutecek, Nikola Bilyk, Robert Weber and Sebastian Frimmel - played the whole of the first half, as they have done throughout almost all the tournament.\n\n16:10 | HALF-TIME\n\nAustria 8:14 Iceland\n\nIceland are flying into the second half with a significant lead. A huge 10 saves (59 per cent) from Viktor Hallgrímsson and too many Austrian mistakes are making life tough for Austria, despite Constantin Möstl's nine saves (41 per cent). In any other game that would be match-winning.\n\nEHF journalist Adrian Costeiu has more:\n\n\"A battle of strong attacks, which delivered impressive performances so far at the EHF EURO 2024, became a battle between two excellent goalkeepers in Constantin Möstl and Viktor Hallgrímsson. Therefore, it was about which team was going to be better in attack and that was Iceland, who have carried their form from their win against Croatia and had a 6:0 run to end the half. This was Austria’s worst first half so far in the competition, and their chances of progression to the semi-finals is likely to stay a dream, as they prepare to concede their second loss in as many matches to end the EHF EURO 2024.\"\n\n16:01\n\nThe Icelandic defence is doing a great job at stopping Austria's attacks, and they have eked out a 10:8 lead. On the other hand, the Austrian defence isn't half bad either, and prevents Iceland going further ahead.\n\n15:54\n\nFew have managed to stop a Bjarki Mar Elisson fast break this tournament, but Nikola Bilyk chases down the Icelandic wing and steals the ball from him. And again we have a period with absolutely no goals, because either a shot is saved, or someone turns over the ball. Iceland lead 8:7, after 21 minutes.\n\n15:50\n\nThree goals now for an in-form Aron Pálmarsson, as Iceland lead 6:5.\n\n15:42\n\nIf the goalkeepers go on like this we're set for a low-scoring game. Helped by their defence, Constantin Möstl has stopped six shots and Viktor Hallgrímsson five in just 10 minutes. Austria equalise with a penalty and a Nikola Bilyk goal. You can see there is a little more pressure on the Austrians, who can still finish better than the eighth place they managed in 2020 when they hosted the preliminary and main rounds of the EHF EURO.\n\n15:35\n\nIt's a clash between two 23-year-old goalkeepers at the moment, both of whom have performed beyond their years at this EHF EURO - Constantin Möstl and Viktor Hallgrímsson. They've both managed to stop half of the shots they've faced after five minutes.\n\nIceland lead 3:2, with Aron Pálmarsson leading from the front by scoring the first two goals for Iceland.\n\n15:30\n\nWe are ready for the last day of the main round - are you? The teams are throwing off.\n\nFollow along with the live Twitch show!\n\n15:20\n\nThe teams are being announced - Iceland definitely for the last time, Austria ... we'll find out. They need a win here to maximise their semi-final chances. A loss would rule them out for certain and a draw would give them a nervous few hours waiting for the result of the next two games.\n\nTo follow the match live, click here: Austria vs Iceland\n\n15:05\n\nWe're in the LANXESS arena for the last time in the main round and Iceland and Austria are warming up for only their third EHF EURO match. Iceland won by six goals the last time they met, in the main round in 2014.\n\nIceland will miss line player Ýmir Gíslason, suspended for one match after receiving a direct red card for a foul in their last game. They're brought in right back Teitur Örn Einarsson, who plays for SG Flensburg-Handewitt, as Gisli Kristjansson is injured. But the good news for Iceland is that Ómar Ingi Magnusson, who was ill on Monday, is back for this one.\n\n14:20\n\nRight, we're off to the arena, but we'll leave you temporarily with the stat of the day - showing just how many passes Austria make, compared to their opponents this afternoon, Iceland.\n\n14:00\n\nBefore tonight's games, here's how the standings look in main round group I. France are safe at the top of the group, but everyone else's fate rests on both their own performance and that of their opponents.\n\n13:30\n\nLooks like the German goalkeepers are ready for a big game. The German federation has shared some video of their team's preparation for the last main round match, against Croatia.\n\n13:00\n\nWe had to say goodbye to three more teams yesterday - here's the Netherlands' recap of their EHF EURO and the fun they had.\n\n12:30\n\nTechnology is driving sport forward at a rapid pace, and the EHF is looking to keep on track with that pace - yesterday there was a workshop in the LANXESS arena testing out new ways to bring the game to spectators and fans, using cameras in the goal and on referees. Here's what happened and why it matters."
