        "text": "So, I really want to avoid a long string of Nike posts complaining about their templates. For now you do get the idea that I do not particularly like it, but as we will see there are some examples where it works OK. But in order to break the mold a bit and do something different, let’s look at Iceland. Their World Cup jersey is already released, but I want to first get a picture of their font used for names and numbers before writing about it.\n\nIceland surely is THE story over the past four if not six years in European football. One of the smallest nations in terms of population is mixing it up with the big boys. While making it to the playoffs for the 2014 World Cup may have looked like a fluke, qualifying for EURO 2016 in a very tough group AND eliminating/humiliating the Netherlands in the process surely made heads turn and proved that Iceland is for real. Any doubters were surely put int heir place when they beat Austria to make it to the knock-out stages at EURO 2016 and then managed to (deservedly!!!) knock out England before succumbing to France. After that, the Viking chants were heard around the world and even made it to the NFL! But that’s not all: direct qualification to the 2018 World Cup (a tougher task than qualification for EURO 2016) and being placed in League A in the new UEFA Nations League followed and only a fool will think that Iceland are roll-overs. Don’t be surprised if they make it out of their group despite an incredibly tough draw! Iceland is here to stay!\n\nNow, while I have often had the intention to write about an Iceland shirt during the European qualifiers in 2015, I never actually got around to do so and for that reasonm I want to go back even a little bit further and look at the jersey that really put Iceland on the map by beating the Netherlands a few months after they finished third at the World Cup:\n\nWell, first off I am not only covering a new team, but also a new supplier: Errea! The small Italian brand is equipping Iceland since 2002 and produced quite a nice kit: simple and yet nicely incorporating national elements. The shirt is mainly blue but has a red band bordered by thinner white bands running across the chest – a clear reference to the Icelandic flag. Above the band, we see the manufacturer logo on the proper right and the Iceland FA logo on the proper left. It would be an understatement to say that I dislike the logo, but then you have to work with what is given to you. But anything featuring essentially a clip-art soccer ball is bound to not perceived highly by me. The collar however is remarkable and looks actually better than I first thought. I also thoroughly like the no-nonsense font for names and numbers. It fits very well with the team and still manages to look great. There are two further things that makes not everything click for me is the shade of blue as I wish it was a bit deeper. Also the horizontal band is a little boring. Some slight fading or a vertical band reminding us of the flag could have made it more interesting. But then again, it is a no-nonsense look for a no-nonsense team and thus very fitting.\n\nMy rating: 6/10 stars.\n\nNow to the jersey that made history in France, the one that beat both Austria (personally, a blow for me but it caused this awesome video to be made, so I got quickly over it) and England (one of the very few highlights of the tournament).\n\nAt first sight this one looks a lot sharper! The blue jersey uses a much deeper blue tone and making the stripe run down vertically on the left side really adds personality. And I am just a sucker for this design feature. Also look how clever it is: the stripe slightly fades out in order to not drown out the still not good FA logo. But it also makes it far less visible and not as distracting as before. Simple change producing an absolute winner! Well, the collar is on the other side trying to be too much. V-neck with an inset and a standing collar at once. I think a fully outlined V-neck (white with red?) would have worked better here. But to be fair, it does not ruin the jersey at all – just adds an odd twist. The cuffs also are white which gives the jersey a bit more personality. Maybe some red could have found its way there, too, but not a biggie. The backside is plain as the previous shirt, but now we have Iceland’s flag there. And I am happy to report that name and number font have not been altered and still look very good. And I love the numbers centered on the front.\n\nI really would like to own this one – it was among the best shirts at EURO 2016 and really made a mark there. It is not all perfect, but nearly so.\n\nMy rating: 9/10 stars.\n\nHow do you rate these shirts?"
