        "text": "The Football Association of Iceland (Knattspyrnusamband Íslands) is the governing body of football in Iceland. It was founded on 26 March 1947 and became affiliated to FIFA in the same year and to UEFA in 1954.\n\nThe Úrvalsdeild karla is the top tier of the Icelandic football pyramid and currently comprises 12 clubs. The most championships have been won by KR (Reykjavík), followed by ÍA (Akranes) and Fram Reykjavík. The 1912 season of Úrvalsdeild was the first season of league football in Iceland.\n\nThe next levels are the 1. deild karla (second tier) which is fed by 2. deild karla (third tier), both of which have 12 teams. The fourth tier up to 2012 was run on a regional basis with 4 groups with the top two teams in each group qualifying for the play-off stage.\n\n​\n\nIn 2013 a new league was added to the Icelandic football league system, a nationwide league of ten teams. This division has taken over from the existing 3. deild and has been renamed 4. deild karla.\n\nAll divisions are administered by the Football Association of Iceland (KSI) and there is promotion and relegation between each tier.\n\nThe Icelandic Cup (known as the VISA-bikar) is the national knock-out football cup competition in Iceland. The final is played at Laugardalsvöllur at the end of the Icelandic season in October. The winners qualify for the UEFA Europa League.\n\n​"
