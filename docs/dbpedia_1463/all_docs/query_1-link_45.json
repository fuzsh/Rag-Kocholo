Their best effort do this was playoffs to 2014 world cup,where they narrowly were beaten by Croatia.\n\nWhy lower leagues?\n\nThis is a far better challenge than for example starting with IA. The top divsion has been dominated in recent years by both KR and FH.\n\nView attachment 369615 View attachment 369614\n\nSo we will start with 5-th tier Stokkseyri, which was founded in 1908 making it one of the oldest Icelandic football clubs.\n\nView attachment 369602\n\nDespite that they never had won a major trophy.\n\n​\n\nJacob7777\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJun 28, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n336\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nJun 18, 2014\n\n#2\n\n2013/14 squad\n\nOldest player: Predrag Milosavljevic (40)\n\nYoungest player: Bjogravin Garoarsson (21)\n\nIcelandic players: 18\n\nEuropean players: 2\n\nAfrican players: 1\n\nAsian players: 1\n\nOceanian players: 0\n\nAmerican players: 0\n\nNote: Some midfielders can play as strikers or strikers as midfielders.

He's an ok player at this standard, but he doesn't play anymore. I wonder how you got all the lower Icelandic leagues? Can you send me a link of the download? Wonder if I am in Stál-úlfur in this database you're using, you can check me up if you like, the name is: Gunnlaugur Jon Ingason...maybe send me a screenshot if I am\n\nCheers!\n\nmbaudrier\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nOct 28, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n193\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nOct 16, 2014\n\n#10\n\nI will follow your story as I did with the one of Kerguelen.\n\nWent to Iceland in may, wonderful country, go if you can !\n\nJacob7777\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nJun 28, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n336\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nOct 17, 2014\n\n#11\n\nThanks guys! There is a twist, because my file crashed, so i will start with the other lower league team if you aren't angry . I won't tell you the name now, but I can tell that the club isn't a good one not even close!\n\nI took the file from FM-SCOUT.COM the link is: Iceland to level 5 for FM14"
