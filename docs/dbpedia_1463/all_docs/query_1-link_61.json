        "text": "It seems hard to believe, but by the middle of next week Iceland could be looking forward to a place at the World Cup finals.\n\nIt will be the smallest country to ever reach football’s biggest event. Here’s the official population of Iceland at the end of 2012: 320,137. When I visited a few summers ago, I couldn’t help but think ‘What have they done with all the people?’\n\nIt’s not necessarily easy to rank footballing success from different decades, but if Iceland can overcome Croatia in their two-legged play-off, I’m struggling to think of a more impressive achievement in international football over recent years. Perhaps not since rank outsiders Greece won Euro 2004.\n\nMORE: Tottenham’s Gylfi Sigurdsson says play-offs hold no fears for Iceland\n\nMuch of Iceland’s remarkable success in this qualifying campaign –they were seeded sixth in their group, but finished second behind Switzerland – can surely be put down to the qualities of their coach Lars Lagerback, formerly manager of Sweden and Nigeria.\n\nHe’s been in the job since 2010, and in just three years has taken them to the very brink of football’s great international showpiece.\n\nSwede Lagerback has been happy to pay tribute to his players however, which include 35-year-old Eidur Gudjohnsen, formerly of Bolton and Chelsea, and Spurs man Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian, the coach praised the mentality of players who will carry the hopes of the nation in the next few days, with Friday’s home match in Reykjavik followed by Tuesday’s return in Zagreb.\n\n‘There is no moaning whatsoever,’ he said. ‘No complaining. Take our travelling, for example. We are not the richest Football Association so our travelling is sometimes a little bit awkward. One time we had to wait six hours for a plane in London and no one said a word.’\n\nIt’s a kind of impressive humility that seems to have served Iceland well.\n\nGudjohnsen has no doubt of the magnitude of the achievement, should Iceland overcome this significant final hurdle against the 1998 World Cup semi-finalists.\n\n‘Getting to this World Cup with my home country and all the things and countries we are up against would be like winning a title with a club in a major league,’ he said.\n\n‘It would just be an amazing feat and something unforgettable to be part of. It has always been a distant dream, it has never gone away however unlikely.\n\n‘Any boy who watches the World Cup dreams about playing in it one day. I have been realistic about it in recent years and accepted that maybe it would never happen.\n\nSigurdsson praises improvements in the country for their fantastic achievement in reaching these play-offs, saying: ‘I think over the course of the last 10 years or so there’s been a lot of change in the facilities in Iceland, and that’s helped to develop young players.\n\n‘I think you can see the results of it now, there are a lot of young players – even younger than a few of the players who are in the first team now. There are some good players there in the Under-21s and hopefully in the future we keep producing players.’\n\nThe midfielder also tried to take some of the sting out of the games with Croatia, pointing out that their opponents had more famous players. ‘There’s a lot of interest [in us], people asking about it [the play-offs] and asking if we’re going to make it. But I think there will be a lot more people wanting to see Luka Modric and [Mario] Mandzukic on TV than some of the Icelandic players.’\n\nMuch of the hype surrounding the play-offs this week has surrounded Portugal’s showdown with Sweden, with superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic on show. That’s a fascinating battle of course, but the real romantics will know where their bread is buttered over the coming days.\n\nIceland in Brazil. Iceland at the World Cup. Just writing it seems strange. By Tuesday night, it could well be a glorious reality."
