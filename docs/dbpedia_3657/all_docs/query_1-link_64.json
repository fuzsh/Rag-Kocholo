        "text": "DEVOTIONAL PRAYER FOR APRIL\n\nPrayer to St. Joseph, Model for Workers\n\nSt. Joseph silent and well-known carpenter in Nazareth, model of workers, by the work of your hands, you gave your contribution to the work of the Creator, you earned your living, and you provided for the needs of the Holy Family.\n\nIntercede for all workers, in the difficulties of their daily lives, especially for the unemployed, in their anxieties for tomorrow, so that, through the guidance of God, the great Architect and Builder, they may use their strength and their talents to make visible his Kingdom, his new creation, to offer a concrete service to society, and to earn wages worthy of their efforts. Amen\n\nEntrance Antiphon\n\nThe merciful love of the Lord fills the earth; by the word of the Lord the heavens were made, alleluia.\n\n1st Reading (Acts 2:14, 36-41)\n\nA reading from the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nOn the day of Pentecost Peter stood up with the Eleven and addressed the crowd in a loud voice: ‘The whole House of Israel can be certain that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ.’ Hearing this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the apostles, ‘What must we do, brothers?’ ‘You must repent,’ Peter answered ‘and every one of you must be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise that was made is for you and your children, and for all those who are far away, for all those whom the Lord our God will call to himself.’ He spoke to them for a long time using many arguments, and he urged them, ‘Save yourselves from this perverse generation.’ They were convinced by his arguments, and they accepted what he said and were baptised. That very day about three thousand were added to their number.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nResponsorial Psalm\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.\n\n2nd Reading (1 Pet 2:20-25)\n\nThe merit, in the sight of God, is in bearing punishment patiently when you are punished after doing your duty. This, in fact, is what you were called to do, because Christ suffered for you and left an example for you to follow the way he took. He had not done anything wrong, and there had been no perjury in his mouth. He was insulted and did not retaliate with insults; when he was tortured he made no threats but he put his trust in the righteous judge. He was bearing our faults in his own body on the cross, so that we might die to our faults and live for holiness; through his wounds you have been healed. You had gone astray like sheep but now you have come back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nGospel Acclamation\n\nAlleluia, alleluia! I am the good shepherd, says the Lord; I know my sheep and mine know me. Alleluia!\n\nGospel (Jn 10:1-10)\n\nA reading from the holy Gospel according to St. John.\n\nJesus said: ‘I tell you most solemnly, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but gets in some other way is a thief and a brigand. The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the flock; the gatekeeper lets him in, the sheep hear his voice, one by one he calls his own sheep and leads them out. When he has brought out his flock, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow because they know his voice. They never follow a stranger but run away from him: they do not recognise the voice of strangers.’ Jesus told them this parable but they failed to understand what he meant by telling it to them. So Jesus spoke to them again: ‘I tell you most solemnly, I am the gate of the sheepfold. All others who have come are thieves and brigands; but the sheep took no notice of them. I am the gate. Anyone who enters through me will be safe: he will go freely in and out and be sure of finding pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full.’\n\nThe Gospel of the Lord.\n\nCommunion Antiphon\n\nThe Good Shepherd has risen, who laid down his life for his sheep and willingly died for his flock, alleluia.\n\nNext Week’s Readings\n\nActs 6:1-7; 1 Pet 2:4-9; Jn 14:1-12\n\nFeasts of the Week\n\nTue, 2 May -St. Athanasius\n\nWed, 3 May - Sts.

O render him glorious praise, alleluia.\n\n1st Reading (Acts 2:14, 22-33)\n\nA reading from the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nOn the day of Pentecost Peter stood up with the Eleven and addressed the crowd in a loud voice: ‘Men of Israel, listen to what I am going to say: Jesus the Nazarene was a man commended to you by God by the miracles and portents and signs that God worked through him when he was among you, as you all know. This man, who was put into your power by the deliberate intention and foreknowledge of God, you took and had crucified by men outside the Law. You killed him, but God raised him to life, freeing him from the pangs of Hades; for it was impossible for him to be held in its power since, as David says of him: I saw the Lord before me always, for with him at my right hand nothing can shake me. So my heart was glad and my tongue cried out with joy; my body, too, will rest in the hope that you will not abandon my soul to Hades nor allow your holy one to experience corruption. You have made known the way of life to me, you will fill me with gladness through your presence. ‘Brothers, no one can deny that the patriarch David himself is dead and buried: his tomb is still with us. But since he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn him an oath to make one of his descendants succeed him on the throne, what he foresaw and spoke about was the resurrection of the Christ: he is the one who was not abandoned to Hades, and whose body did not experience corruption. God raised this man Jesus to life, and all of us are witnesses to that. Now raised to the heights by God’s right hand, he has received from the Father the Holy Spirit, who was promised, and what you see and hear is the outpouring of that Spirit.’\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nResponsorial Psalm\n\nLord, you will show us the path of life.\n\n2nd Reading (1 Pet 1:17-21)\n\nA reading from the first letter of St. Peter.\n\nIf you are acknowledging as your Father one who has no favourites and judges everyone according to what he has done, you must be scrupulously careful as long as you are living away from your home. Remember, the ransom that was paid to free you from the useless way of life your ancestors handed down was not paid in anything corruptible, neither in silver nor gold, but in the precious blood of a lamb without spot or stain, namely Christ; who, though known since before the world was made, has been revealed only in our time, the end of the ages, for your sake. Through him you now have faith in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory for that very reason – so that you would have faith and hope in God.\n\nThe Word of the Lord\n\nGospel Acclamation\n\nAlleluia, alleluia! Lord Jesus, make your word plain to us, make our hearts burn with love when you speak, Alleluia!\n\nGospel (Lk 24:13-35)\n\nA reading from the holy Gospel according to St. Luke.\n\nTwo of the disciples of Jesus were on their way to a village called Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking together about all that had happened. Now as they talked this over, Jesus himself came up and walked by their side; but something prevented them from recognising him. He said to them, ‘What matters are you discussing as you walk along?’ They stopped short, their faces downcast. Then one of them, called Cleopas, answered him, ‘You must be the only person staying in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have been happening there these last few days.’ ‘What things?’ he asked. ‘All about Jesus of Nazareth’ they answered ‘who proved he was a great prophet by the things he said and did in the sight of God and of the whole people; and how our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and had him crucified. Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free. And this is not all: two whole days have gone by since it all happened; and some women from our group have astounded us: they went to the tomb in the early morning, and when they did not find the body, they came back to tell us they had seen a vision of angels who declared he was alive. Some of our friends went to the tomb and found everything exactly as the women had reported, but of him they saw nothing.’ Then he said to them, ‘You foolish men! So slow to believe the full message of the prophets! Was it not ordained that the Christ should suffer and so enter into his glory?’ Then, starting with Moses and going through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages throughout the scriptures that were about himself. When they drew near to the village to which they were going, he made as if to go on; but they pressed him to stay with them. ‘It is nearly evening’ they said ‘and the day is almost over.’ So he went in to stay with them. Now while he was with them at table, he took the bread and said the blessing; then he broke it and handed it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he had vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, ‘Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us on the road and explained the scriptures to us?’ They set out that instant and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven assembled together with their companions, who said to them, ‘Yes, it is true. The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.’ Then they told their story of what had happened on the road and how they had recognised him at the breaking of bread.\n\nThe Gospel of the Lord.\n\nCommunion Antiphon\n\nThe disciples recognised the Lord Jesus in the breaking of bread, alleluia.\n\nNext Week’s Readings\n\nActs 2:14, 36-41; 1 Pet 2:20-25; Jn 10:1-10\n\nFeasts of the Week\n\nTue, 25 Apr - ANZAC Day\n\nWed, 26 Apr - St. Mark\n\nFri, 28 Apr - St. Peter Chanel\n\nSat, 29 Apr - St. Catherine of Siena\n\nPARISH NEWS\n\nWEEKLY PARISH DATES\n\nSUNDAY\n\n9:15am to 10:25am – Sunday School for children attending non-Catholic Schools (currently on school holidays).\n\n10:30am Mass – Children’s Liturgy held 1st and 3rd Sundays.\n\nAfter 5:00pm Mass – Youth Group for youth 12 to 17 years on 2nd and 4th Sundays.\n\n6:00pm in Theatrette – Young Adults (SPYA) meet 1st and 3rd Sundays.\n\n6:15pm in Community Centre - School of Discipleship commences 23rd AprilMONDAY\n\nNo Bible Study on Monday, 24th April.TUESDAY\n\n7:00pm - Online Zoom Rosary - Meeting ID: 893 5477 8556.

The many miracles and signs worked through the apostles made a deep impression on everyone. The faithful all lived together and owned everything in common; they sold their goods and possessions and shared out the proceeds among themselves according to what each one needed. They went as a body to the Temple every day but met in their houses for the breaking of bread; they shared their food gladly and generously; they praised God and were looked up to by everyone. Day by day the Lord added to their community those destined to be saved.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nResponsorial Psalm\n\nGive thanks to the Lord for he is good, his love is everlasting.\n\n2nd Reading (1 Pet 1:3-9)\n\nA reading from the first letter of St. Peter.\n\nBlessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy has given us a new birth as his sons, by raising Jesus Christ from the dead, so that we have a sure hope and the promise of an inheritance that can never be spoilt or soiled and never fade away, because it is being kept for you in the heavens. Through your faith, God’s power will guard you until the salvation which had been prepared is revealed at the end of time. This is a cause of great joy for you, even though you may for a short time have to bear being plagued by all sorts of trials; so that, when Jesus Christ is revealed, your faith will have been tested and proved like gold – only it is more precious than gold, which is corruptible even though it bears testing by fire – and then you will have praise and glory and honour. You did not see him, yet you love him; and still without seeing him, you are already filled with a joy so glorious that it cannot be described, because you believe; and you are sure of the end to which your faith looks forward, that is, the salvation of your souls.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nGospel Acclamation\n\nAlleluia, alleluia! You believe in me, Thomas, because you have seen me; happy those who have not seen me, but still believe! Alleluia!.\n\nGospel (Jn 20:19-31)\n\nA reading from the holy Gospel according to John.\n\nIn the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, the doors were closed in the room where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them, ‘Peace be with you’, and showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord, and he said to them again, ‘Peace be with you. As the Father sent me, so am I sending you.’ After saying this he breathed on them and said: ‘Receive the Holy Spirit. For those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those whose sins you retain, they are retained.’ Thomas, called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. When the disciples said, ‘We have seen the Lord’, he answered, ‘Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe.’ Eight days later the disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came in and stood among them. ‘Peace be with you’ he said. Then he spoke to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side. Doubt no longer but believe.’ Thomas replied, ‘My Lord and my God!’ Jesus said to him: ‘You believe because you can see me. Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.’ There were many other signs that Jesus worked and the disciples saw, but they are not recorded in this book. These are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing this you may have life through his name.\n\nThe Gospel of the Lord.\n\nCommunion Antiphon\n\nBring your hand and feel the place of the nails, and do not be unbelieving but believing, alleluia.\n\nNext Week’s Readings\n\nActs 2:14, 22-33; 1 Pet 1:17-21; Lk 24:13-35\n\nPARISH NEWS\n\nWEEKLY PARISH DATES\n\nSUNDAY\n\n9:15am to 10:25am – Sunday School for children attending non-Catholic Schools (currently on school holidays).\n\n10:30am Mass – Children’s Liturgy held 1st and 3rd Sundays.\n\nAfter 5:00pm Mass – Youth Group for youth 12 to 17 years on 2nd and 4th Sundays.\n\n6:00pm in Theatrette – Young Adults (SPYA) meet 1st and 3rd Sundays.\n\n6:15pm in Community Centre - School of Discipleship commences 23rd AprilMONDAY\n\n7:00pm to 8:15pm - Bible Study sessions.

We lift them up as we pray in Jesus’s name. As we celebrate Jesus’s victory over death, we pray, O Heavenly Father, that You be near to us and continue to guide us until we join in the unending celebration in heaven. In Your name we pray. Amen.\n\nEntrance Antiphon\n\nI have risen, and I am with you still, alleluia. You have laid your hand upon me, alleluia. Too wonderful for me, this knowledge, alleluia, alleluia!\n\n1st Reading (Acts 10:34, 37-43)\n\nA reading from the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nPeter addressed Cornelius and his household: ‘You must have heard about the recent happenings in Judaea; about Jesus of Nazareth and how he began in Galilee, after John had been preaching baptism. God had anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and because God was with him, Jesus went about doing good and curing all who had fallen into the power of the devil. Now I, and those with me, can witness to everything he did throughout the countryside of Judaea and in Jerusalem itself: and also to the fact that they killed him by hanging him on a tree, yet three days afterwards God raised him to life and allowed him to be seen, not by the whole people but only by certain witnesses God had chosen beforehand. Now we are those witnesses – we have eaten and drunk with him after his resurrection from the dead – and he has ordered us to proclaim this to his people and to tell them that God has appointed him to judge everyone, alive or dead. It is to him that all the prophets bear this witness: that all who believe in Jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name.’\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nResponsorial Psalm\n\nThis is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.\n\n2nd Reading (Col 3:1-4)\n\nA reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n\nSince you have been brought back to true life with Christ, you must look for the things that are in heaven, where Christ is, sitting at God’s right hand. Let your thoughts be on heavenly things, not on the things that are on the earth, because you have died, and now the life you have is hidden with Christ in God. But when Christ is revealed – and he is your life – you too will be revealed in all your glory with him.\n\nGospel Acclamation\n\nAlleluia, alleluia! Christ has become our paschal sacrifice; let us feast with joy in the Lord. Alleluia!\n\nGospel (Jn 20:1-9)\n\nA reading from the holy Gospel according to John.\n\nIt was very early on the first day of the week and still dark, when Mary of Magdala came to the tomb. She saw that the stone had been moved away from the tomb and came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. ‘They have taken the Lord out of the tomb’ she said ‘and we don’t know where they have put him.’ So Peter set out with the other disciple to go to the tomb. They ran together, but the other disciple, running faster than Peter, reached the tomb first; he bent down and saw the linen cloths lying on the ground, but did not go in. Simon Peter who was following now came up, went right into the tomb, saw the linen cloths on the ground, and also the cloth that had been over his head; this was not with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and he believed. Till this moment they had failed to understand the teaching of scripture that he must rise from the dead.\n\nThe Gospel of the Lord.\n\nCommunion Antiphon\n\nChrist our Passover has been sacrificed, alleluia; therefore let us keep the feast with the unleavened bread of purity and truth, alleluia, alleluia.\n\nNext Week’s Readings\n\nActs 2:42-47; 1 Pet 1:3-9; Jn 20:19-31\n\nPARISH NEWS\n\nEASTER BLESSING\n\nMay the Resurrection of our Saviour\n\nBe a constant reminder\n\nOf His love and promise of Eternal life\n\nWELCOME TO OUR PARISH COMMUNITY\n\nWe welcome to our parish community our Catechumen Barrie Hope who receives the Sacraments of Baptism, Holy Communion and Confirmation at the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday, 8th April 2023.\n\nDIVINE MERCY SUNDAY – 16TH APRIL, COMMENCING AT 2:00PM\n\nTo celebrate this beautiful Feast, there will be Exposition, Adoration and Confession commencing at 2:00pm.

Hosanna!\n\nEntrance Antiphon\n\nHosanna in the highest! Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!\n\n1st Reading (Is 50:4-7)\n\nA reading from the prophet Isaiah.\n\nThe Lord has given me a disciple’s tongue. So that I may know how to reply to the wearied he provides me with speech. Each morning he wakes me to hear, to listen like a disciple. The Lord has opened my ear. For my part, I made no resistance, neither did I turn away. I offered my back to those who struck me, my cheeks to those who tore at my beard; I did not cover my face against insult and spittle. The Lord comes to my help, so that I am untouched by the insults. So, too, I set my face like flint; I know I shall not be shamed.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nResponsorial Psalm\n\nMy God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\n\n2nd Reading (Phil 2:6-11)\n\nA reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Philippians.\n\nHis state was divine, yet Christ Jesus did not cling to his equality with God but emptied himself to assume the condition of a slave and became as men are; and being as all men are, he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross. But God raised him high and gave him the name which is above all other names so that all beings in the heavens, on earth and in the underworld, should bend the knee at the name of Jesus and that every tongue should acclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nGospel Acclamation\n\nPraise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory!\n\nChrist became obedient for us even to death, dying on the cross.\n\nTherefore God raised him on high and gave him a name above all other names.\n\nPraise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory!\n\nGospel (Mt 26:14-27:66)\n\nA reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n\nDue to the length of the gospel, we are unable to provide a printed version this week.\n\nCommunion Antiphon\n\nFather, if this chalice cannot pass without my drinking it, your will be done.\n\nNext Week’s Readings\n\nActs 10:34,37-43; Col 3:1-4; Jn 20:1-9\n\nFeasts of the Week\n\nThu, 6 Apr - Mass of the Lord’s Supper\n\nFri, 7 Apr - Good Friday\n\nSat, 8 Apr - Holy Saturday\n\nPARISH NEWS\n\nDAYLIGHT SAVINGS ends this Sunday, 2nd April.
