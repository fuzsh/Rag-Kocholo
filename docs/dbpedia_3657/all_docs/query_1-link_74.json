Pick, Backed Industry Donors Over Regulators\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pruitt could be in charge of policing industries that have long helped advance his political career.\n\n‘Marielitos’ Face Long-Delayed Reckoning: Expulsion to Cuba\n\nThe migrants came to the U.S. by the thousands when Fidel Castro opened the Mariel port in 1980, and many took up a life of crime when they got here.\n\nJolted by Deaths, Obama Found His Voice on Race\n\nTensions across the country prompted the president to abandon his early reticence on race again and again.\n\nRich Chinese, Inspired by ‘Downton,’ Fuel Demand for Butlers\n\nButler training programs have seen more recruits in recent years, and many point to “Downton Abbey,” the drama about British aristocrats, which was avidly watched in China.\n\nFor Early ‘Jersey Boys’ Investors, Oh, What a Run\n\nAbout three out of four Broadway shows lose money. But not “Jersey Boys.” Here’s how a group of unlikely investors helped make the show a global hit."
