        "text": "(upbeat music) - You're watching highlights of the Chattanooga City Council meeting, a production of WTCI PBS.\n\n(wooden hammer hitting desk) - Right.\n\nWe call this meeting to order.\n\nAll right, we'll have a special presentation by Mayor Tim Kelly and Chairman Darrin Ledford.\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] Well thank you, Members of Council, Mayor Kelly, thank you for being here, and all these great people who showed up for this special presentation.\n\nI want to share a story with you about human kindness but going above and beyond.\n\nAnd I also want to thank our fire department.\n\nChief Hyman, how many firefighters do we have that were on the scene on March 3rd when this incredible act of kindness took place?\n\n- [Chief Hyman] Four of our crew members from Engine 12 Blue Shift - [Darrin Ledford] Blue Shift Engine 12.\n\nVery good.\n\nWill you raise your hands, gentlemen who were on the scene for this?\n\nWe want to thank you too and that's the sheriff.\n\nSo it's an honor to be here today because we want to recognize a heroic action of one of Chattanooga's own, Randi Haynes.\n\nOn the morning of Friday, March 3rd while Ms. Haynes stood outside the downtown Chattanooga Alliance office where she worked, she heard a woman scream from a nearby car.\n\nHer daughter was having a baby.\n\nRight then and there, Ms. Haynes sprung into action.\n\nMatter of fact, Ms. Haynes, will you come up and join us please cuz we'd like to see you (laughs).\n\nA trained midwife, she ran to the car, pulled open the door to an in labor mother to a baby that was already crowning.\n\nNow that's the part where I start screaming.\n\nBut Randi, with no time to wait for an ambulance, coached the mother through labor, delivered a baby girl right there on Broad Street.\n\n(audience cheering and clapping) This is such an incredible example of the extraordinary way that Chattanoogans care for each other in times of crisis.\n\nIt didn't matter that this woman was a stranger and that Ms. Haynes had somewhere to be, or something could have gone wrong that might have put her at risk.\n\nMs. Haynes sprung into action and for that mother and new baby girl.\n\nWe're happy and healthy and you brought a wonderful new life into this world.\n\nMs. Haynes, on behalf of the city of Chattanooga, thank you for your heroic service.\n\nYour calm and decisive actions brought new life into the world and your story will be an inspiration through generations.\n\nThat's why I'm proud to proclaim tomorrow March 22nd as Randi Haynes Day in the city of Chattanooga.\n\n(audience cheering and clapping) And I'd like to ask Mayor Kelly to work with me on reading the proclamation.\n\nWhereas Randi Haynes is the operations manager for the downtown Chattanooga Alliance nonprofit organization that keeps downtown Chattanooga safe, clean and welcoming for all who staff serve as ambassadors for the city.\n\nAnd whereas on March 10th at 10:00 AM, Ms. Haynes was outside her office preparing her team for cleanup efforts expected to commence after an expected storm cleared the area.\n\nAnd whereas Ms. Haynes, who was also an experienced midwife, suddenly heard a frantic voice call for help from a nearby car.\n\nAnd upon investigation discovered that the voice belonged to a woman who was in the final stage of labor and given the circumstances would be unable to make it to the hospital in time for the birth.\n\nAnd whereas Ms. Haynes introduced herself, received permission from the mother to help, and guided the mother through the delivery process.\n\nAnd after the delivery provided a sternum rub to stimulate the baby's breathing process, then placed the healthy baby girl on her mother's chest.\n\nHere Kelly.\n\n- [Mayor Tim Kelly] And whereas soon after an ambulance arrived and took the mother and daughter to Erlanger where both were found to be in good health and whereas Haynes went home to clean up, pretty good and return to work that same day to ensure that her team was safe ahead of the expected storm after the storm passed, let her team's clean up efforts, including reporting fallen traffic lights, removing debris, and preparing for the upcoming Chattanooga marathon.\n\nAnd whereas Haynes demonstrated responsible and heroic leadership in the face of multiple crises, showing dedication and pride in her work and should be recognized for going above and beyond the call of duty serving as an example that all Chattanoogans should follow.\n\nNow therefore, I, Tim Kelly, mayor of the city of Chattanooga - [Darrin Ledford] and the Chattanooga City Council - [Mayor Tim Kelly] do hereby proclaim, Wednesday, March 22nd, 2020 third as Randi Haynes Day.\n\n(audience cheering and clapping) - [Darrin Ledford] Okay, our lesson this evening, be a Randi.\n\nI like it.\n\nOur next list of items for this evening is a special presentation, it's a public hearing on the Chattanooga Climate Action Plan.\n\nThe council had originally noticed that we would set 30 minutes, we may need a little more time and two minutes per speaker, which we will adhere to.\n\nSo at this time I will open the public hearing for the Chattanooga Climate Action Plan.\n\nPay attention real closely.\n\nHere's what I need you to do.\n\nThere's a lot of people here our clerk and we have also folks recording in the back are taking very special notes.\n\nWe need to hear your name clearly, what district of the city you live in or your address where you live.\n\nThat's very important for our record keeping as we move forward in this process.\n\nThis is part of the public hearing process.\n\nSo if you would like to speak which I anticipate there will be one or two of you then please start to line up and then as we start to filter through, we will start to pull folks from the lobby so that everyone has an opportunity to speak.\n\nYes ma'am, please go ahead and we have two minutes on the timer please.\n\nMr. - - [Carol Eimers] Good evening.\n\nI'm Carol Eimers.\n\nI'm regional vice president for the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nSo I'm here representing TVA.\n\nI wanna thank you for the opportunity to provide comment for the mayor's Climate Action Plan.\n\nTVA was established 90 years ago to serve this region and the nation by developing innovative solutions to solve complex problems.\n\nThat same purpose guides our work today.\n\nWe recognize the need for affordable, reliable, resilient and clean energy.\n\nWe also recognize that there is no one answer to achieving the nation's decarbonization goals.\n\nWhich is why, why we are committed to developing all potential pathways to a clean energy future.\n\nRecently, TVA announced a valley pathway study that will look at all segments of the valley economy and identify ways everyone, not just TVA, and the power industry can drive toward a sustainable clean economy.\n\nWe know this effort is broader than TVA which is why we are supportive of the mayor's Climate Action Plan and look forward to working side by side to help improve Chattanooga's quality of life and enables smart, clean and sustainable growth that benefits all cities, all members of the of the city.\n\nWe appreciate your leadership.\n\nWe look forward to working with you together on this important effort and thank you for your time this evening.\n\n- [Dave Dennis] Hi, my name's Dave Dennis.\n\nI'm at district seven and there's a war out there in this world since the beginning of time for control of the earth and there's always focused on financial systems, follow the money, and controlling the people.\n\nWhen our state of Tennessee or any state of the union accepts federal funding, there's always strings attached.\n\nWe are sacrificing our sovereignty.\n\nHARPA, DARPA, our Pentagon, CERN, World Economic Forum, CIA, Mossad, and MI6 all support new world orders.\n\nWhich include weather weaponization and modification, chemtrails and geoengineering of our skies, and all under the disguise of climate change.\n\nThese climate change agendas are stepping stones to control people and steal our God-given freedoms from we the people.\n\nThese agenda items augment the global plan to incorporate 15-minute neighborhoods smart cities in the current climate plan.\n\nArtificial intelligence, if allowed to continue will be eliminating the human element.\n\nEven your current positions could be jeopardized by a AI from a higher authority.\n\nCommon sense tells us we are heading into a digital concentration camp, our phones, smart TVs, smart appliances, smart cars, AI controlled cameras on every street and light pole, and every traffic light, every shopping center and every place of business all have facial recognition and built-in AI monitoring and it's every aspect of our life.\n\nCould you see where the social scoring will come in?\n\nThese are the internet of things that are shown in the World Economic Forum presentations, all under the cover of public safety.\n\nPfizer's patent 11 1 0 7 5 88 B2 was approved back on August, 2021 and it allows contact tracing of vaccinated humans worldwide to be connected to the internet via quantum link of microwave frequencies from cell towers and satellites, communicating directly to graphene oxide (timer beeping) held in our fatty tissue and all the persons that took.\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] Thank you sir.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat's your time.\n\n- [Dave Dennis] That's it?\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] Yes sir.\n\n- [Sandy Kurtz] I'm Sandy Kurtz and I live at 1803 Coward Street, 37409.\n\nI'm in the new District, 37408.\n\nThe new district is District nine.\n\nWell, I came here to support the Climate Action Plan and I'm just surprised by what I'm hearing from many who are opposed to the plan and I'm just kind of confused about why they would be against so much of this and I think it has something to do with fear.\n\nThey're afraid of losing.\n\n(people in audience interrupt) - Point of order, point of order.\n\n- [Sandy Kurtz] And I look at this list here.\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] Please don't interrupt - [Sandy Kurtz] What's in the climate action plan and I don't know what there is to really object to except that... - [Someone In audience] Please.\n\n- [Sandy Kurtz] These people feel like they didn't have any, any input into it.\n\nI am part of the Climate Chattanooga Coalition that is made up of several environmental local groups, citizens, interested citizens who have participated in this plan and creating it.\n\nAnd I think that it's actually is a good plan and there is plenty of input from many, many citizens here locally.\n\nAnd you had some opportunities and this public hearing is one of those.\n\nSo I'm sure that you all are hearing all of the information and talks that can go into it.\n\nIt is urgent that we do approve it because in the paper today we read that the climate change is giving us problems that we really need to get on to doing, taking action for.\n\nSo the best thing that you've have in this I think is that it says right at the beginning.\n\nInvest in a circular economy.\n\nThat is a home run.\n\n(timer beeping) - [Darrin Ledford] Please go ahead sir.\n\n- [Aaron Barry] My name is Aaron Barry.\n\nI'm retired army sergeant, military police.\n\nFour-time combat veteran.\n\nAlso POW mission to Vietnam.\n\nListen, council member.. - [Darrin Ledford] What district do you live in sir?\n\n- [Aaron Barry] District three.\n\nMr. Ken Smith, over here.\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] Thank you for your service sir.\n\n- [Aaron Barry] Knows exactly who I am.\n\nCheck this out ladies and gentlemen.\n\nYou guys, what I've been witnessing throughout this whole situation is that you have the corporation against the people.\n\nLet me explain something to you.\n\nThe constitution wasn't written for corporations, it was written for the people.\n\nI will behoove you to look at the 2003 situation in Virginia Beach when they tried to put their high tech cameras in there.\n\nA group of my veterans went to the Supreme Court and within six to nine months had 'em removed.\n\nI will have these cameras removed.\n\nI'm not gonna discuss it anymore.\n\nI've had enough.\n\nWe are the people we voted you in.\n\nDid we vote you in or did the corporations vote you in?\n\n(audience agreeing) You better start listening to us cause we've had enough.\n\nThis is very surreal and serious.\n\nIt is a control factor, that's all it is.\n\nAnd we ain't gonna be controlled no more.\n\nI've been all over this world.\n\nI've seen it and now I'm seeing it here in my own city.\n\nI didn't come here to be in peace to see war.\n\nYou know exactly what I'm talking about and I'm not gonna go further with it.\n\nSo explain to you this very simple, you need to look these things up that I just mentioned.\n\nPray about it and then exactly ask yourself in the mirror in the morning, why did you take them seats?\n\nBecause if I took that seat, it's for my own for my brothers and sisters out here.\n\nNot for who's packing?\n\nWho's packing my pocket.\n\nI've got 15 seconds.\n\nBless your little hearts.\n\nEvery one of you because guess what, every one of you supposed to be intelligent.\n\nWhat about the people who are outside our city district that work here?\n\nWhere's their voice?\n\nGod bless you.\n\nHave a good night.\n\nIt ain't welcome.\n\nThe city plan is not gonna go through I promise.\n\n(timer beeping) (audience cheering and clapping) - (Michael Walton) Chairman, thank you.\n\nI'm Michael Walton.\n\nI'm the executive director of Green Spaces and District eight.\n\nWe're a local 501(c)(3) nonprofit with a diverse bipartisan board of directors.\n\nOur programming, which has received awards from Governor Haslam and Governor Lee, focuses on empowering people to be more self-sufficient, healthy and resilient.\n\nWe do that in under-resourced neighborhoods.\n\nWe connect at-risk young adults, with opportunities in clean industries.\n\nWe prepare students for jobs of the future and we help businesses meet their goals to be successful businesses and good stewards of the environment.\n\nWe are pleased to see that the Climate Action Plan shares our approach of working with a coalition of the willing to improve the quality of life and quality of the environment for everyone in the Chattanooga region.\n\nI'm excited about the future the plan lays out, a carbon neutral future where I have the freedom to generate my own electricity on my property, power my car to get to work, grow fresh food in unpolluted land, drink unpolluted water, breathe unpolluted air and go hiking and camping with my two boys in a healthy ecosystem.\n\nIn this future with zero waste, I won't worry about where the next landfill will be built and whether it will be next to my house or business.\n\nIn this future, because of our planning now, my two boys and kids like them in every neighborhood in Chattanooga, will have access to the fastest growing industries in the world.\n\nI don't think it's too much to ask that my two boys and kids all over Chattanooga grow up in a healthy place with with access as good or better natural resources than we do.\n\nI support this plan and look forward to supporting the city during its execution.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(audience clapping) - [Dan Mehan] Good evening, Dan Mehan, district seven.\n\nI've spoken to you before.\n\nI'm a retired federal law enforcement officer.\n\nI know a thing or two about about.\n\n- [Someone In audience] Can't hear you.\n\n- [Darrin Ledford] I'm sorry.\n\n- [Dan Mehan] I'm a retired federal law enforcement officer.\n\nI know a thing or two about intelligence and information and how to evaluate both over the course of 35 years I've done about 200 hours worth of research on the climate change topic which has been hijacked by government.\n\nIt is not an existential threat.\n\nIt is a logical fallacy meant to appeal to our emotion.\n\n- [Someone In audience] Yes.\n\nAnd I don't have but two minutes.\n\nI'm happy to debate anybody on that aspect given more time.\n\nBut as an officer of the court I'm particularly concerned about the rule of law and government overreach, your hand on the scales.\n\nI'm a global citizen.\n\nI've been to 80 foreign countries, most of them socialists.\n\nI know who the world polluters are, China, India.\n\nI've been to 26 of the 54 countries in Africa.\n\nI've lived in Libya for two years.\n\nWe don't want to lose our capitalist society and every step that you our government officials take to move us along the spectrum to socialism, more and more people, sir are going to be left in poverty.\n\nIt's the only political capitalist system, economic system that has lifted more people outta poverty in the last 50 years.\n\nTwo billion to be exact according to the World Bank.\n\nYou need to step back, let people vote on this and more importantly, let all these business developers that are looking to make a buck, let corporate people work it out.\n\nGovernment should stay out of this debate and let disruptive company out.\n\n(audience cheering and clapping) Thank you all.\n\nThank you.\n\n- [Johan de Nysschen] Good evening.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, my name is Johan de Nysschen.\n\nI live in Harrison.\n\nAnd my wife and I considered Chattanooga our home.\n\nI'm a recent retiree and I am devoting my energy to serving our community and helping specifically to focus on workforce development.\n\nI'm a member of Chatanooga 2.0 and I'm also chairman of CARTA.\n\nI'm speaking to you today as one of the people and not as a representative of a corporation.\n\nListening to the eloquent and passionate former speakers.\n\nI'm struck by the tragedy of how concerned about the environment, sustainability and the air that we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that we cultivate has become so politicized.\n\nBecause after all this earth is the one thing that we all have in common.\n\nRegardless of color or creed or political persuasion.\n\nRegardless of whether one believes in climate change or not.\n\nIt seems to me to be empirically common sense that we would seek to harness technology, good order, new knowledge to bring about the advancement of communities and our society and have a positive environmental impact with the view to sustaining the future for the generations to come.\n\nI support this plan because it is comprehensive in nature.\n\nIt is multifaceted and it's not about whether it reigns on poor people or rich people.\n\nBut in Chattanooga, unless we also have efforts to develop our disadvantaged people, people who are not engaged in the workforce, will slow down investment and flatline the growth in our city.\n\n(timer beeping) This is a comprehensive, well thought out plan and deserve support - [Darrin Ledford] Thank you sir - [Johan de Nysschen] Thank you.\n\n(audience clapping) - [Darrin Ledford] I want to thank each and every one of you for bringing your comments, your convictions and even your passion in the beginning.\n\nBecause everything you said, I promise you we are making lots of notes.\n\nWe are listening intently and this is a very important part of the process.\n\nAnd yes, whether you live in the city, whether you live in the county, your your voice matters and that's something that we strive for and live up to every single meeting.\n\nIf you, I'd like to see more of you come back and visit us instead of just about this, it would be nice.\n\nYou're, door is always welcome or open.\n\nYou're always welcome.\n\nSo thank you for your comments.\n\nWe have concluded the public hearing.\n\nI will now end the public hearing.\n\nOkay, we're gonna move on to our agenda ordinances on final reading.\n\nI have a motion to approve the minutes.\n\nThe minutes will stand without objection.\n\nThe order of business for city council.\n\nOrdinances on final reading.\n\nPlanning items, without objection from council items A, B, and C -
