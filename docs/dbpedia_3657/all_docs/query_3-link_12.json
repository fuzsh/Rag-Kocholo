I found it was not possible in all cases to give references in footnotes between the Memoir and Letters; but as both are arranged chronologically there will be no difficulty in turning from one to the other when desirable.\n\nThe first Letter, relating Julie's method of teaching a Liturgical Class, should be read with the remembrance that it was written thirty-two years ago, long before the development of our present Educational System; but it is valuable for the zeal and energy it records, combined with the common incident of the writer being too ill to appear at the critical moment of the Inspector's visit.\n\nIn a later letter, dated May 28, 1866, there are certain remarks about class singing in schools, which are also out of date; but this is retained as a proof of the keen sense of musical rhythm and accent which my sister had, and which gave her power to write words for music although she could play no instrument.\n\nIt is needless to add that none of the letters were intended for publication; they were written to near relatives and friends currente calamo, and are full of familiar expressions and allusions which may seem trivial and uninteresting to ordinary readers. Those, however, who care to study my sister's character I think cannot fail to trace in these records some of its strongest features; her keen enjoyment of the beauties of Nature,—her love for animals,—for her Home,—her lares and penates;—and her Friends. Above all that love of God [vi]which was the guiding influence of everything she wrote or did. So inseparable was it from her every-day life that readers must not be surprised if they find grave and gay sentences following each other in close succession.\n\nJulie's sense of humour never forsook her, but she was never malicious, and could turn the laugh against herself as readily as against others. I have ventured to insert a specimen of her fun, which I hope will not be misunderstood. In a letter to C.T.G., dated March 13, 1874, she gave him a most graphic picture of the erratic condition of mind that had come over an old friend, the result of heavy responsibilities and the rush of London life. Julie had no idea when she wrote that these symptoms were in reality the subtle beginnings of a breakdown, which ended fatally, and no one lamented the issue more truly than she; but she could not resist catching folly as it flew, and many of the flighty axioms became proverbial amongst us.\n\nThe insertion of Bishop Medley's reply to my sister, April 8, 1880, needs no apology, it is so interesting in itself, and gives such a charming insight into the friendship between them.\n\nThe List of Mrs. Ewing's Works at the end of the Memoir was made before the publication of the present Complete Edition; this, therefore, is only mentioned in cases where stories have not been published in any other book form. All Mrs. Ewing's Verses for Children, Hymns, and Songs for Music (including two left in MS.) are included in Volume IX.\n\nVolume XVII., \"Miscellanea,\" contains The Mystery of a bloody hand together with the Translated Stories, and other papers that had appeared previously in Magazines.\n\nIn Volume XII., \"Brothers of Pity and other tales of men and beasts,\" will be found Among the Merrows; A Week spent in a Glass Pond; Tiny's Tricks and Toby's Tricks; The Owl in the Ivy Bush, and Owlhoots I. II., whilst Sunflowers and a Rushlight has been put amongst the Flower Stories in Vol. XVI., Mary's Meadow, etc.\n\nThe Letter with which this volume concludes was one [vii]of the last that Julie wrote, and its allusion to Gordon's translation seemed to make it suitable for the End.\n\nAfter her death the readers of Aunt Judy's Magazine subscribed enough to complete the endowment (£1000) of a Cot at the Convalescent Home of the Hospital for Sick Children, Cromwell House, Highgate. This had been begun to our Mother's memory, and was completed in the joint names of Margaret Gatty and Juliana Horatia Ewing. So liberal were the subscriptions that there was a surplus of more than £200, and with this we endowed two £5 annuities in the Cambridge Fund for Old Soldiers—as the \"Jackanapes,\" and \"Leonard\" annuities.\n\nOf other memorials there are the marble gravestone in Trull Churchyard, and Tablet in Ecclesfield Church, both carved by Harry Hems, of Exeter, and similarly decorated with the double lilac primrose,—St. Juliana's flower.\n\nIn Ecclesfield Church there is also a beautiful stained window, given by her friend, Bernard Wake. The glass was executed by W.F. Dixon, and the subject is Christ's Ascension. Julie died on the Eve of Ascension Day.\n\nLastly, there is a small window of jewelled glass, by C.E. Kempe, in St. George's Church, South Camp, Aldershot, representing St. Patrick trampling on a three-headed serpent, emblematical of the powers of evil, and holding the Trefoil in his hand—a symbol of the Blessed Trinity.\n\nHoratia K.F. Eden.\n\nRugby, 1896.\n\nThe frontispiece portrait of Mrs. Ewing is a photogravure produced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company, from a photograph taken by Mr. Fergus of Largs.\n\nAll the other illustrations are from Mrs. Ewing's own drawings, except the tail-piece on p. 136. This graceful ideal of Mrs. Ewing's grave was an offering sent by Mr. Caldecott shortly after her death, with his final illustrations to \"Lob Lie-by-the-Fire.\"\n\n[8]\n\nJULIANA HORATIA EWING\n\nAND HER BOOKS.\n\n[9]\n\nPART I.\n\nIn Memoriam JULIANA HORATIA, SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE REV. ALFRED GATTY, D.D., AND MARGARET, HIS WIFE, BORN AT ECCLESFIELD, YORKSHIRE, AUGUST 3, 1841, MARRIED JUNE 1, 1867, TO ALEXANDER EWING, MAJOR, A.P.D., DIED AT BATH, MAY 13, 1885, BURIED AT TRULL, SOMERSET, MAY 16, 1885.\n\nI have promised the children to write something for them about their favourite story-teller, Juliana Horatia Ewing, because I am sure they will like to read it.\n\nI well remember how eagerly I devoured the Life of my favourite author, Hans Christian Andersen; how anxious I was to send a subscription to the memorial [10]statue of him, which was placed in the centre of the public Garden at Copenhagen, where children yet play at his feet; and, still further, to send some flowers to his newly-filled grave by the hand of one who, more fortunate than myself, had the chance of visiting the spot.\n\nI think that the point which children will be most anxious to know about Mrs. Ewing is how she wrote her stories. Did she evolve the plots and characters entirely out of her own mind, or were they in any way suggested by the occurrences and people around her?\n\nThe best plan of answering such questions will be for me to give a list of her stories in succession as they were written, and to tell, as far as I can, what gave rise to them in my sister's mind; in doing this we shall find that an outline biography of her will naturally follow. Nearly all her writings first appeared in the pages of Aunt Judy's Magazine, and as we realize this fact we shall see how close her connection with it was, and cease to wonder that the Magazine should end after her death.\n\nThose who lived with my sister have no difficulty in tracing likenesses between some of the characters in her books, and many whom she met in real life; but let me say, once for all, that she never drew \"portraits\" of people, and even if some of us now and then caught glimpses of ourselves under the clothing she had robed [11]us in, we only felt ashamed to think how unlike we really were to the glorified beings whom she put before the public.\n\nStill less did she ever do with her pen, what an artistic family of children used to threaten to do with their pencils when they were vexed with each other, namely, to \"draw you ugly.\"\n\nIt was one of the strongest features in my sister's character that she \"received but what she gave,\" and threw such a halo of sympathy and trust round all with whom she came in contact, that she seemed to see them \"with larger other eyes than ours,\" and treated them accordingly. On the whole, I am sure this was good in its results, though the pain occasionally of awakening to disappointment was acute; but she generally contrived to cover up the wound with some new shoot of Hope. On those in whom she trusted I think her faith acted favourably. I recollect one friend whose conscience did not allow him to rest quite easy under the rosy light through which he felt he was viewed, saying to her: \"It's the trust that such women as you repose in us men, which makes us desire to become more like what you believe us to be.\"\n\nIf her universal sympathy sometimes led her to what we might hastily consider \"waste her time\" on the petty interests and troubles of people who appeared to us unworthy, what were we that we should blame [12]her? The value of each soul is equal in God's sight; and when the books are opened there may be more entries than we now can count of hearts comforted, self-respect restored, and souls raised by her help to fresh love and trust in God,—ay, even of old sins and deeds of shame turned into rungs on the ladder to heaven by feet that have learned to tread the evil beneath them. It was this well-spring of sympathy in her which made my sister rejoice as she did in the teaching of the now Chaplain-General, Dr. J.C. Edghill, when he was yet attached to the iron church in the South Camp, Aldershot. \"He preaches the gospel of Hope,\" she said—hope that is in the latent power which lies hidden even in the worst of us, ready to take fire when touched by the Divine flame, and burn up its old evil into a light that will shine to God's glory before men. I still possess the epitome of one of these \"hopeful\" sermons, which she sent me in a letter after hearing the chaplain preach on the two texts: \"What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God\"; \"Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\"\n\nIt has been said that, in his story of \"The Old Bachelor's Nightcap,\" Hans Andersen recorded something of his own career. I know not if this be true, but certainly in her story of \"Madam Liberality\"[1] [13]Mrs. Ewing drew a picture of her own character that can never be surpassed. She did this quite unintentionally, I know, and believed that she was only giving her own experiences of suffering under quinsy, in combination with some record of the virtues of One whose powers of courage, uprightness, and generosity under ill-health she had always regarded with deep admiration. Possibly the virtues were hereditary,—certainly the original owner of them was a relation; but, however this may be, Madam Liberality bears a wonderfully strong likeness to my sister, and she used to be called by a great friend of ours the \"little body with a mighty heart,\" from the quotation which appears at the head of the tale.\n\nThe same friend is now a bishop in another hemisphere from ours, but he will ever be reckoned a \"great\" friend. Our bonds of friendship were tied during hours of sorrow in the house of mourning, and such as these are not broken by after-divisions of space and time. Mrs. Ewing named him \"Jachin,\" from one of the pillars of the Temple, on account of his being a pillar of strength at that time to us. Let me now quote the opening description of Madam Liberality from the story:—\n\nAll my earliest recollections of Julie (as I must call her) picture her as at once the projector and manager of all our nursery doings. Even if she tyrannized over us by always arranging things according to her own fancy, we did not rebel, we relied so habitually and entirely on her to originate every fresh plan and idea; and I am sure that in our turn we often tyrannized over her by reproaching her when any of what we called her \"projukes\" ended in \"mulls,\" or when she paused for what seemed to us a longer five minutes than usual in the middle of some story she was telling, to think what the next incident should be!\n\nIt amazes me now to realize how unreasonable we were in our impatience, and how her powers of invention ever kept pace with our demands. These early stories were influenced to some extent by the books that she then liked best to read—Grimm, Andersen, and Bechstein's fairy tales; to the last writer I believe we owed her story about a Wizard, which was one of [16]our chief favourites. Not that she copied Bechstein in any way, for we read his tales too, and would not have submitted to anything approaching a recapitulation; but the character of the little Wizard was one which fascinated her, and even more so, perhaps, the quaint picture of him, which stood at the head of the tale; and she wove round this skeleton idea a rambling romance from her own fertile imagination.\n\nI have specially alluded to the picture, because my sister's artistic as well as literary powers were so strong that through all her life the two ever ran side by side, each aiding and developing the other, so that it is difficult to speak of them apart.[2]\n\nMany of the stories she told us in childhood were inspired by some fine woodcuts in a German \"A B C book,\" that we could none of us then read, and in later years some of her best efforts were suggested by illustrations, and written to fit them. I know, too, that in arranging the plots and wording of her stories she followed the rules that are pursued by artists in composing their pictures. She found great difficulty in preventing herself from \"overcrowding her canvas\" with minor characters, owing to her tendency to throw herself into complete sympathy with whatever creature she touched; and, sometimes,—particularly in tales which came out as serials, when she wrote from month to month, and had no opportunity of correcting the composition as a whole,—she was apt to give undue prominence to minor details, and throw her high lights on to obscure corners, instead of concentrating them on the central point. These artistic rules kept her humour and pathos,—like light and shade,—duly balanced, and made the lights she \"left out\" some of the most striking points of her work.\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n\nBut to go back to the stories she told us as children. Another of our favourite ones related to a Cavalier who hid in an underground passage connected with a deserted Windmill on a lonely moor. It is needless to say that, as we were brought up on Marryat's Children of the New Forest, and possessed an aunt who always went into mourning for King Charles on January 30, our sympathies were entirely devoted to the Stuarts' cause; and this persecuted Cavalier, with his big hat and boots, long hair and sorrows, was our best beloved hero. We would always let Julie tell us the \"Windmill Story\" over again, when her imagination was at a loss for a new one. Windmills, I suppose from their picturesqueness, had a very strong attraction for her. There were none near our Yorkshire home, so, perhaps, their rarity added to their value in her eyes; certain it is that she was never tired of sketching them, and one of her latest note-books is full of the old mill at Frimley, Hants, taken under various aspects of sunset and storm. Then Holland, with its low horizons and rows of windmills, was the first foreign land she chose to visit, and the \"Dutch Story,\" one of her earliest written efforts, remains an unfinished fragment; whilst \"Jan of the Windmill\" owes much of its existence to her early love for these quaint structures.\n\n[19]\n\nIt was not only in the matter of fairy tales that Julie reigned supreme in the nursery, she presided equally over our games and amusements. In matters such as garden-plots, when she and our eldest sister could each have one of the same size, they did so; but, when it came to there being one bower, devised under the bending branches of a lilac bush, then the laws of seniority were disregarded, and it was \"Julie's Bower.\" Here, on benches made of narrow boards laid on inverted flower-pots, we sat and listened to her stories; here was kept the discarded dinner-bell, used at the funerals of our pet animals, and which she introduced into \"The Burial of the Linnet.\"[3] Near the Bower we had a chapel, dedicated to St. Christopher, and a sketch of it is still extant, which was drawn by our eldest sister, who was the chief builder and caretaker of the shrine; hence started the funeral processions, both of our pets and of the stray birds and beasts we found unburied. In \"Brothers of Pity\"[4] Julie gave her hero the same predilection for burying that we had indulged in.\n\nShe invented names for the spots that we most frequented in our walks, such as \"The Mermaid's Ford,\" and \"St. Nicholas.\" The latter covered a space including several fields and a clear stream, and over[20] this locality she certainly reigned supreme; our gathering of violets and cowslips, or of hips and haws for jam, and our digging of earth-nuts were limited by her orders. I do not think she ever attempted to exercise her prerogative over the stream; I am sure that, whenever we caught sight of a dark tuft of slimy Batrachospermum in its clear depths, we plunged in to secure it for Mother, whether Julie or any other Naiad liked it or no! But \"the splendour in the grass and glory in the flower\" that we found in \"St. Nicholas\" was very deep and real, thanks to all she wove around the spot for us. Even in childhood she must have felt, and imparted to us, a great deal of what she put into the hearts of the children in \"Our Field.\"[5] To me this story is one of the most beautiful of her compositions, and deeply characteristic of the strong power she possessed of drawing happiness from little things, in spite of the hindrances caused by weak health. Her fountain of hope and thankfulness never ran dry.\n\nSome of the indoor amusements over which Julie exercised great influence were our theatricals. Her powers of imitation were strong; indeed, my mother's story of \"Joachim the Mimic\" was written, when Julie was very young, rather to check this habit which had early developed in her. She always took what may be called the \"walking gentleman's\" part in our [22]plays. Miss Corner's Series came first, and then Julie was usually a Prince; but after we advanced to farces, her most successful character was that of the commercial traveller, Charley Beeswing, in \"Twenty Minutes with a Tiger.\" \"Character\" parts were what she liked best to take, and in later years, when aiding in private theatricals at Aldershot Camp, the piece she most enjoyed was \"Helping Hands,\" in which she acted Tilda, with Captain F.G. Slade, R.A., as Shockey, and Major Ewing as the blind musician.\n\nThe last time she acted was at Shoeburyness, where she was the guest of her friends Colonel and Mrs. Strangways, and when Captain Goold-Adams and his wife also took part in the entertainment. The terrible news of Colonel Strangways' and Captain Goold-Adams' deaths from the explosion at Shoebury in February 1885, reached her whilst she was very ill, and shocked her greatly; though she often alluded to the help she got from thinking of Colonel Strangways' unselfishness, courage, and submission during his last hours, and trying to bear her own sufferings in the same spirit. She was so much pleased with the description given of his grave being lined with moss and lilac crocuses, that when her own had to be dug it was lined in a similar way.\n\nBut now let us go back to her in the Nursery, and recall how, in spite of very limited pocket-money, she [23]was always the presiding Genius over birthday and Christmas-tree gifts; and the true 'St. Nicholas' who filled the stockings that the \"little ones\" tied, in happy confidence, to their bed-posts. Here the description must be quoted of Madam Liberality's struggles between generosity and conscientiousness;—\n\nEqually characteristic of Julie's moral courage and unselfishness is the incident of how Madam Liberality suffered the doctor's assistant to extract the tooth fang which had been accidentally left in her jaw, because her mother's \"fixed scale of reward was sixpence for a tooth without fangs, and a shilling for one with them,\" and she wanted the larger sum to spend on Christmas-tree presents.\n\nWhen the operation was over,\n\nMadam Liberality staggered home, very giddy, but very happy. Moralists say a great deal about pain treading so closely on the heels of pleasure in this life, but they are not always wise or grateful enough to speak of the pleasure which springs out of pain. And yet there is a bliss which comes just when pain has ceased, whose rapture rivals even the high happiness of unbroken health; and there is a keen pleasure about small pleasures hardly earned, in which the full measure of those who can afford anything they want is sometimes lacking. Relief is certainly one of the most delicious sensations which poor humanity can enjoy!\n\nThe details which can be traced in Julie's letters [25]after undergoing the removal of her tonsils read very much like extracts from Madam Liberality's biography. During my sister's last illness she spoke about this episode, and said she looked back with surprise at the courage she had exercised in going to London alone, and staying with friends for the operation. Happily, like Madam Liberality, she too earned a reward in the relief which she appreciated so keenly; for, after this event, quinsies became things of the past to her, and she had them no more.\n\nOn April 14, 1863, she wrote—\n\n[26]\n\nAs Julie emerged from the nursery and began to take an interest in our village neighbours, her taste for \"projects\" was devoted to their interests. It was her energy that established a Village Library in 1859, which still remains a flourishing institution; but all her attempts were not crowned with equal success. She often recalled, with great amusement, how, the first day on which she distributed tracts as a District Visitor, an old lady of limited ideas and crabbed disposition called in the evening to restore the tract which had been lent to her, remarking that she had brought it back and required no more, as—\"My 'usband does not attend the public-'ouse, and we've no unrewly children!\"\n\nMy sister gave a series of Lessons[6] on the Liturgy in the day-school, and on Sunday held a Class for Young Women at the Vicarage, because she was so often prevented by attacks of quinsy from going out to school; indeed, at this time, as the mother of some of her ex-pupils only lately remarked, \"Miss Julie were always cayling.\"\n\nThe first stories that she published belong to this so-to-speak \"parochial\" phase of her life, when her interests were chiefly divided between the nursery and the village. \"A Bit of Green\" came out in the Monthly Packet in July 1861; \"The Blackbird's [28]Nest\" in August 1861; \"Melchior's Dream\" in December 1861; and these three tales, with two others, which had not been previously published (\"Friedrich's Ballad\" and \"The Viscount's Friend\"), were issued in a volume called \"Melchior's Dream and other Tales,\" in 1862. The proceeds of the first edition of this book gave \"Madam Liberality\" the opportunity of indulging in her favourite virtue. She and her eldest sister, who illustrated the stories, first devoted the \"tenths\" of their respective earnings for letterpress and pictures to buying some hangings for the sacrarium of Ecclesfield Church, and then Julie treated two of her sisters, who were out of health, to Whitby for change of air. Three years later, out of some other literary earnings, she took her eldest brother to Antwerp and Holland, to see the city of Rubens' pictures, and the land of canals, windmills, and fine sunsets.[7] The expedition had to be conducted on principles which savoured more of strict integrity and economy than of comfort; for they went in a small steamer from Hull to Antwerp, but Julie feasted her eyes and brain on all the fresh sights and sounds she encountered, and filled her sketch-book with pictures.\n\n\"It was at Rotterdam,\" wrote her brother, \"that I left her with her camp-stool and water-colours for a [30]moment in the street, to find her, on my return, with a huge crowd round her, and before—a baker's man holding back a blue veil that would blow before her eyes—and she sketching down an avenue of spectators, to whom she kept motioning with her brush to stand aside. Perfectly unconscious she was of how she looked, and I had great difficulty in getting her to pack up and move on. Every quaint Dutch boat, every queer street, every peasant in gold ornaments, was a treasure to her note-book. We were very happy!\"\n\nI doubt, indeed, whether her companion has experienced greater enjoyment during any of his later and more luxurious visits to the same spots; the first sight of a foreign country must remain a unique sensation.\n\nIt was not the intrinsic value of Julie's gifts to us that made them so precious, but the wide-hearted spirit which always prompted them. Out of a moderate income she could only afford to be generous from her constant habit of thinking first for others, and denying herself. It made little difference whether the gift was elevenpence three-farthings' worth of modern Japanese pottery, which she seized upon as just the right shape and colour to fit some niche on one of our shelves, or a copy of the edition de luxe of \"Evangeline,\" with Frank Dicksee's magnificent illustrations, which she ordered one day to be included in the [31]parcel of a sister, who had been judiciously laying out a small sum on the purchase of cheap editions of standard works, not daring to look into the tempting volume for fear of coveting it. When the carrier brought home the unexpectedly large parcel that night, it was difficult to say whether the receiver or the giver was the happier.\n\nMy turn came once to be taken by Julie to the sea for rest (June 1874), and then one of the chief enjoyments lay in the unwonted luxury of being allowed to choose my own route. Freedom of choice to a wearied mind is quite as refreshing as ozone to an exhausted body. Julie had none of the petty tyranny about her which often mars the generosity of otherwise liberal souls, who insist on giving what they wish rather than what the receiver wants.\n\nI was told to take out Bradshaw's map, and go exactly where I desired, and, oh! how we pored over the various railway lines, but finally chose Dartmouth for a destination, as being old in itself, and new to us, and really a \"long way off.\" We were neither of us disappointed; we lived on the quay, and watched the natives living in boats on the harbour, as is their wont; and we drove about the Devon lanes, all nodding with foxgloves, to see the churches with finely-carved screens that abound in the neighbourhood, our driver being a more than middle-aged woman, [32]with shoes down at heel, and a hat on her head. She was always attended by a black retriever, whom she called \"Naro,\" and whom Julie sketched. I am afraid, as years went on, I became unscrupulous about accepting her presents, on the score that she \"liked\" to give them!—and I only tried to be, at any rate, a gracious receiver.\n\nThere was one person, however, whom Julie found less easy to deal with, and that was an Aunt, whose [33]liberality even exceeded her own. When Greek met Greek over Christmas presents, then came the tug of war indeed! The Aunt's ingenuity in contriving to give away whatever plums were given to her was quite amazing, and she generally managed to baffle the most careful restrictions which were laid upon her; but Julie conquered at last, by yielding—as often happens in this life!\n\n\"It's no use,\" Julie said to me, as she got out her bit of cardboard (not for a needle-book this time!)—\"I must make her happy in her own way. She wants me to make her a sketch for somebody else, and I've promised to do it.\"\n\nThe sketch was made,—the last Julie ever drew,—but it remained amongst the receiver's own treasures. She was so much delighted with it, she could not make up her mind to give it away, and Julie laughed many times with pleasure as she reflected on the unexpected success that had crowned her final effort.\n\nI spoke of \"Melchior's Dream\" and must revert to it again, for though it was written when my sister was only nineteen, I do not think she has surpassed it in any of her later domestic tales. Some of the writing in the introduction may be rougher and less finished than she was capable of in after-years, but the originality, power, and pathos of the Dream itself [34]are beyond doubt. In it, too, she showed the talent which gives the highest value to all her work—that of teaching deep religious lessons without disgusting her readers by any approach to cant or goody-goodyism.\n\nDuring the years 1862 to 1868, we kept up a MS. magazine, and, of course, Julie was our principal contributor. Many of her poems on local events were genuinely witty, and her serial tales the backbone of the periodical. The best of these was called \"The Two Abbots: a Tale of Second Sight,\" and in the course of it she introduced a hymn, which was afterwards set to music by Major Ewing and published in Boosey's Royal Edition of \"Sacred Songs,\" under the title \"From Fleeting Pleasures.\"\n\nThe words of this hymn, and of two others which she wrote for the use of our Sunday school children at Whitsuntide in the respective years 1864 and 1866 have all been published in vol. ix. of the present Edition of her works.\n\nSome years after she married, my sister again tried her hand at hymn-writing. On July 22, 1879, she wrote to her husband:\n\n\"I think I will finish my hymn of 'Church of the Quick and Dead,' and get thee to write a processional tune. The metre is (last verse)—\n\nMy sister published very few of the things which she wrote to amuse us in our MS. \"Gunpowder Plot Magazine,\" for they chiefly referred to local and family events; but \"The Blue Bells on the Lea\" was an exception. The scene of this is a hill-side near our old home, and Mr. Andre's fantastic and graceful illustrations to the verses when they came out as a book, gave her full satisfaction and delight.\n\nIn June 1865 she contributed a short parochial tale, \"The Yew Lane Ghosts,\" to the Monthly Packet, and during the same year she gave a somewhat sensational story, called \"The Mystery of the Bloody Hand,\"[8] to London Society. Julie found no real satisfaction in writing this kind of literature, and she soon discarded it; but her first attempt showed some promise of the prolific power of her imagination, for Mr. Shirley Brooks, who read the tale impartially, not knowing who had written it, wrote the following criticism: \"If the author has leisure and inclination to make a picture instead of a sketch, the material, judiciously treated, would make a novel, and I especially see in the character and sufferings of the [36]Quaker, previous to his crime, matter for effective psychological treatment. The contrast between the semi-insane nature and that of the hypocrite might be powerfully worked up; but these are mere suggestions from an old craftsman, who never expects younger ones to see things as veterans do.\"\n\nIn May 1866 my Mother started Aunt Judy's Magazine for Children, and she called it by this title because \"Aunt Judy\" was the nickname we had given to Julie whilst she was yet our nursery story-teller, and it had been previously used in the titles of two of my Mother's most popular books, \"Aunt Judy's Tales\" and \"Aunt Judy's Letters.\"\n\nAfter my sister grew up, and began to publish stories of her own, many mistakes occurred as to the authorship of these books. It was supposed that the Tales and Letters were really written by Julie, and the introductory portions that strung them together by my Mother. This was a complete mistake; the only bits that Julie wrote in either of the books were three brief tales, in imitation of Andersen, called [9]\"The Smut,\" \"The Crick,\" and \"The Brothers,\" which were included in \"The Black Bag\" in \"Aunt Judy's Letters.\"\n\nJulie's first contribution to Aunt Judy's Magazine [37]was \"Mrs. Overtheway's Remembrances,\" and between May 1866 and May 1867 the three first portions of \"Ida,\" \"Mrs. Moss,\" and \"The Snoring Ghosts,\" came out. In these stories I can trace many of the influences which surrounded my sister whilst she was still the \"always cayling Miss Julie,\" suffering from constant attacks of quinsy, and in the intervals, reviving from them with the vivacity of Madam Liberality, and frequently going away to pay visits to her friends for change of air.\n\nWe had one great friend to whom Julie often went, as she lived within a mile of our home, but on a perfectly different soil to ours. Ecclesfield stands on clay; but Grenoside, the village where our friend lived, is on sand, and much higher in altitude. From it we have often looked down at Ecclesfield lying in fog, whilst at Grenoside the air was clear and the sun shining. Here my sister loved to go, and from the home where she was so welcome and tenderly cared for, she drew (though no facts) yet much of the colouring which is seen in Mrs. Overtheway—a solitary life lived in the fear of God; enjoyment of the delights of a garden; with tender treasuring of dainty china and household goods for the sake of those to whom such relics had once belonged.\n\nYears after our friend had followed her loved ones to their better home, and had bequeathed her egg-shell brocade to my sister, Julie had another resting-place in [38]Grenoside, to which she was as warmly welcomed as to the old one, during days of weakness and convalescence. Here, in an atmosphere of cultivated tastes and loving appreciation, she spent many happy hours, sketching some of the villagers at their picturesque occupations of carpet-weaving and clog-making, or amusing herself in other ways. [10]This home, too, was broken up by Death, but Mrs. Ewing looked back to it with great affection, and when, at the beginning of her last illness, whilst she still expected to recover, she was planning a visit to her Yorkshire home, she sighed to think that Grenoside was no longer open to her.\n\nOn June 1, 1867, my sister was married to Alexander Ewing, A.P.D., son of the late Alexander Ewing, M.D., of Aberdeen, and a week afterwards they sailed for Fredericton, New Brunswick, where he was to be stationed.\n\nA gap now occurred in the continuation of \"Mrs. Overtheway's Remembrances.\" The first contributions that Julie sent from her new home were, \"An Idyl of the Wood,\" and \"The Three Christmas Trees.\"[11] In these tales the experiences of her voyage and fresh surroundings became apparent; but in June 1868, \"Mrs. Overtheway\" was continued by the story of \"Reka Dom.\"\n\n[39]\n\nIn this Julie reverted to the scenery of another English home where she had spent a good deal of time during her girlhood. The winter of 1862-3 was passed by her at Clyst St. George, near Topsham, with the family of her kind friend, Rev. H.T. Ellacombe, and she evolved Mrs. Overtheway's \"River House\"[12] out of the romance roused by the sight of quaint old houses, with quainter gardens, and strange names that seemed to show traces of foreign residents in days gone by. \"Reka Dom\" was actually the name of a house in Topsham, where a Russian family had once lived. Speaking of this house, Major Ewing said:—On the evening of our arrival at Fredericton, New Brunswick, which stands on the river St. John, we strolled down, out of the principal street, and wandered on the river shore. We stopped to rest opposite to a large old house, then in the hands of workmen. There was only the road between this house and the river, and, on the banks, one or two old willows. We said we should like to make our first home in some such spot. Ere many weeks were over, we were established in that very house, where we spent the first year, or more, of our time in Fredericton. We called it \"Reka Dom,\" the River House.\n\nFor the descriptions of Father and Mother Albatross and their island home, in the last and most beautiful [41]tale of \"Kerguelen's Land,\" she was indebted to her husband, a wide traveller and very accurate observer of nature.\n\nTo the volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1869 she only sent \"The Land of Lost Toys,\"[13] a short but very brilliant domestic story, the wood described in it being the \"Upper Shroggs,\" near Ecclesfield, which had been a very favourite haunt in her childhood. In October 1869, she and Major Ewing returned to England, and from this time until May 1877, he was stationed at Aldershot.\n\nWhilst living in Fredericton my sister formed many close friendships. It was here she first met Colonel and Mrs. Fox Strangways. In the society of Bishop Medley and his wife she had also great happiness, and with the former she and Major Ewing used to study Hebrew. The cathedral services were a never-failing source of comfort, and at these her husband frequently played the organ, especially on occasions when anthems, which he had written at the bishop's request, were sung.\n\nTo the volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1870 she gave \"Amelia and the Dwarfs,\" and \"Christmas Crackers,\" \"Benjy in Beastland,\" and eight[14] \"Old-fashioned Fairy Tales.\" \"Amelia\" is one of her [43]happiest combinations of real child life and genuine fairy lore. The dwarfs inspired Mr. Cruikshank[15] to one of his best water-colour sketches: who is the happy possessor thereof I do not know, but the woodcut illustration very inadequately represents the beauty and delicacy of the picture.\n\nWhilst speaking of the stories in this volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine, I must stop to allude to one of the strongest features in Julie's character, namely, her love for animals. She threw over them, as over everything she touched, all the warm sympathy of her loving heart, and it always seemed to me as if this enabled her almost to get inside the minds of her pets, and know how to describe their feelings.[16]\n\nAnother Beast Friend whom Julie had in New Brunswick was the Bear of the 22nd Regiment, and she drew a sketch of him \"with one of his pet black dogs, as I saw them, 18th September, 1868, near the Officers' Quarters, Fredericton, N.B. The Bear is at breakfast, and the dog occasionally licks his nose when it comes up out of the bucket.\"\n\nThe pink-nosed bull-dog in \"Amelia\" bears a strong likeness to a well-beloved \"Hector,\" whom she took charge of in Fredericton whilst his master had gone on leave to be married in England. Hector, too, was \"a snow-white bull-dog (who was certainly[45] as well bred and as amiable as any living creature in the kingdom),\" with a pink nose that \"became crimson with increased agitation.\" He was absolutely gentle with human beings, but a hopeless adept at fighting with his own kind, and many of my sister's letters and note-books were adorned with sketches of Hector as he appeared swollen about the head, and subdued in spirits, after some desperate encounter; or, with cards spread out in front of him, playing, as she delighted to make him do, at \"having his fortune told.\"[17] But, instead of the four Queens standing for four ladies of different degrees of complexion, they represented his four favourite dishes of—1. Welsh rabbit. 2. Blueberry pudding. 3. Pork sausages. 4. Buckwheat pancakes and molasses; and \"the [46]Fortune\" decided which of these dainties he was to have for supper.\n\nShortly before the Ewings started from Fredericton they went into the barracks, whence a battalion of some regiment had departed two days before, and there discovered a large black retriever who had been left behind. It is needless to say that this deserted gentleman entirely overcame their feelings; he was at once adopted, named \"Trouvé,\" and brought home to England, where he spent a very happy life, chiefly in the South Camp, Aldershot, his one danger there being that he was such a favourite with the soldiers, they over-fed him terribly. Never did a more benevolent disposition exist, his broad forehead and kind eyes, set widely apart, did not belie him; there was a strong strain of Newfoundland in his breed, and a strong likeness to a bear in the way his feathered paws half crossed over each other in walking. Trouvé appears as \"Nox\" in \"Benjy,\" and there is a glimpse of him in \"The Sweep,\" who ended his days as a \"soldier's dog\" in \"The Story of a Short Life.\" Trouvé did, in reality, end his days at Ecclesfield, where he is buried near \"Rough,\" the broken-haired bull-terrier, who is the real hero in \"Benjy,\" Amongst the various animal friends whom Julie had either of her own, or belonging to others, none was lovelier than the golden-haired collie \"Rufus,\" who was at once the [47]delight and distraction of the last year of her life at Taunton, by the tricks he taught himself of very gently extracting the pins from her hair, and letting it down at inconvenient moments; and of extracting, with equal gentleness from the earth, the labels that she had put to the various treasured flowers in her \"Little Garden,\" and then tossing them in mid-air on the grass-plot.\n\nA very amusing domestic story, called \"The Snap Dragons,\" came out in the Christmas number of the Monthly Packet for 1870.\n\n\"Timothy's Shoes\" appeared in Aunt Judy's volume for 1871. This was another story of the same type as \"Amelia,\" and it was also illustrated by Mr. Cruikshank. I think the Marsh Julie had in her mind's eye, with a \"long and steep bank,\" is one near the canal at Aldershot, where she herself used to enjoy hunting for kingcups, bog-asphodel, sundew, and the like. The tale is a charming combination of humour and pathos, and the last clause, where \"the shoes go home,\" is enough to bring tears to the eyes of every one who loves the patter of childish feet.\n\nThe most important work that she did this year (1871) was \"A Flat-Iron for a Farthing,\" which ran as a serial through the volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine. It was very beautifully illustrated by Helen Paterson (now Mrs. Allingham), and the design where the [48]\"little ladies,\" in big beaver bonnets, are seated at a shop-counter buying flat-irons, was afterwards reproduced in water-colours by Mrs. Allingham, and exhibited at the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours (1875), where it attracted Mr. Ruskin's attention.[18] Eventually, a fine steel engraving was done from it by Mr. Stodart.[19] It is interesting to know that the girl friend who sat as a model for \"Polly\" to Mrs. Allingham is now herself a well-known artist, whose pictures are hung in the Royal Academy.\n\nThe scene of the little girls in beaver bonnets was really taken from an incident of Julie's childhood, when she and her \"duplicate\" (my eldest sister) being the nearest in age, size, and appearance of any of the family, used to be dressed exactly alike, and were inseparable companions: their flat-irons, I think, were bought in Matlock. Shadowy glimpses of this same \"duplicate\" are also to be caught in Mrs. Overtheway's \"Fatima,\" and Madam Liberality's \"Darling.\" When \"A Flat-Iron\" came out in its book form it was dedicated \"To my dear Father, and to his sister, [49]my dear Aunt Mary, in memory of their good friend and nurse, E.B., obiit 3 March, 1872, æt. 83;\" the loyal devotion and high integrity of Nurse Bundle having been somewhat drawn from the \"E.B.\" alluded to. Such characters are not common, and they grow rarer year by year. We do well to hold them in everlasting remembrance.\n\n[50]\n\nPART II.\n\nDuring 1871, my sister published the first of her Verses for Children, \"The Little Master to his Big [51]Dog\"; she did not put her name to it in Aunt Judy's Magazine, but afterwards included it in one of her Verse Books. Two Series of these books were published during her life, and a third Series was in the press when she died, called \"Poems of Child Life and Country Life\"; though Julie had some difficulty in making up her mind to use the term \"poem,\" because she did not think her irregular verses were worthy to bear the title.\n\nShe saw Mr. André's original sketches for five of the last six volumes, and liked the illustrations to \"The Poet and the Brook,\" \"Convalescence,\" and \"The Mill Stream\" best.\n\nTo the volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1872 she gave her first \"soldier\" story, \"The Peace Egg,\" and in this she began to sing those praises of military life and courtesies which she afterwards more fully showed forth in \"Jackanapes,\" \"The Story of a Short Life,\" and the opening chapters of \"Six to Sixteen.\" The chief incident of the story, however, consisted in the Captain's children unconsciously bringing peace and goodwill into the family by performing the old Christmas play or Mystery of \"The Peace Egg.\" This play we had been accustomed to see acted in Yorkshire, and to act ourselves when we were young. I recollect how proud we were on one [52]occasion, when our disguises were so complete, that a neighbouring farmer's wife, at whose door we went to act, drove us as ignominiously away, as the House-keeper did the children in the story. \"Darkie,\" who \"slipped in last like a black shadow,\" and \"Pax,\" who jumped on to Mamma's lap, \"where, sitting facing the company, he opened his black mouth and yawned, with ludicrous inappropriateness,\" are life-like portraits of two favourite dogs.\n\nThe tale was a very popular one, and many children wrote to ask where they could buy copies of the Play in order to act it themselves. These inquiries led Julie to compile a fresh arrangement of it, for she knew that in its original form it was rather too roughly worded to be fit for nursery use; so in Aunt Judy's Magazine (January 1884) she published an adaptation of \"The Peace Egg, a Christmas Mumming Play,\" together with some interesting information about the various versions of it which exist in different parts of England.\n\nShe contributed \"Six to Sixteen\" as a serial to the Magazine in 1872, and it was illustrated by Mrs. Allingham. When it was published as a book, the dedication to Miss Eleanor Lloyd told that many of the theories on the up-bringing of girls, which the story contained, were the result of the somewhat [53]desultory, if intellectual, home education which we had received from our Mother. This education Miss Lloyd had, to a great extent, shared during the happy visits she paid us; when she entered into our interests with the zest of a sister, and in more than one point outstripped us in following the pursuits for which Mother gave us a taste. Julie never really either went to school or had a governess, though for a brief period she was under the kind care of some ladies at Brighton, but they were relations, and she went to them more for the benefit of sea breezes than lessons. She certainly chiefly educated herself by the \"thorough\" way in which she pursued the various tastes she had inherited, and into which she was guided by our Mother. Then she never thought she had learned enough, but throughout her whole life was constantly improving and adding to her knowledge. She owed to Mother's teaching the first principles of drawing, and I have often seen her refer for rules on perspective to \"My Childhood in Art,\"[20] a story in which these rules were fully laid down; but Mother had no eye for colour, and not much for figure drawing. Her own best works were etchings on copper of trees and landscapes, whereas Julie's artistic talent lay more in [54]colours and human forms. The only real lessons in sketching she ever had were a few from Mr. Paul Naftel, years after she was married.\n\nOne of her favourite methods for practising drawing was to devote herself to thoroughly studying the sketches of some one master, in order to try and unravel the special principles on which he had worked, and then to copy his drawings. She pursued this plan with some of Chinnery's curious and effective water-colour sketches, which were lent to her by friends, and she found it a very useful one. She made copies from De Wint, Turner, and others, in the same way, and certainly the labour she threw into her work enabled her to produce almost facsimiles of the originals. She was greatly interested one day by hearing a lady, who ranks as one of the best living English writers of her sex, say that when she was young she had practised the art of writing in just the same way that Julie pursued that of drawing, namely, by devoting herself to reading the works of one writer at a time, until her brain was so saturated with his style that she could write exactly like him, and then passing on to an equally careful study of some other author.\n\nThe life-like details of the \"cholera season,\" in the second chapter of \"Six to Sixteen,\" were drawn [55]from facts that Major Ewing told his wife of a similar season which he had passed through in China, and during which he had lost several friends; but the touching episode of Margery's birthday present, and Mr. Abercrombie's efforts to console her, were purely imaginary.\n\nSeveral of the \"Old-fashioned Fairy Tales\" which Julie wrote during this (1872) and previous years in Aunt Judy's Magazine, were on Scotch topics, and she owed the striking accuracy of her local colouring and dialect, as well as her keen intuition of Scotch character, to visits that she paid to Major Ewing's relatives in the North, and also to reading such typical books as Mansie Wauch, the Tailor of Dalkeith, a story which she greatly admired. She liked to study national types of character, and when she wrote \"We and the World,\" one of its chief features was meant to be the contrast drawn between the English, Scotch, and Irish heroes; thanks to her wide sympathy she was as keenly able to appreciate the rugged virtues of the dour Scotch race, as the more quick and graceful beauties of the Irish mind.\n\nThe Autumn Military Manoeuvres in 1872 were held near Salisbury Plain, and Major Ewing was so much fascinated by the quaint old town of Amesbury, where he was quartered, that he took my sister afterwards to visit the place. The result of this was that[56] her \"Miller's Thumb\"[21] came out as a serial in Aunt Judy's Magazine during 1873. All the scenery is drawn from the neighbourhood of Amesbury, and the Wiltshire dialect she acquired by the aid of a friend, [57]who procured copies for her of Wiltshire Tales and A Glossary of Wiltshire Words and Phrases, both by J.Y. Akerman, F.S.A. She gleaned her practical knowledge of life in a windmill, and a \"Miller's Thumb,\" from an old man who used to visit her hut in the South Camp, Aldershot, having fallen from being a Miller with a genuine Thumb, to the less exalted position of hawking muffins in winter and \"Sally Lunns\" in summer! Mrs. Allingham illustrated the story; two of her best designs were Jan and his Nurse Boy sitting on the plain watching the crows fly, and Jan's first effort at drawing on his slate. It was published as a book in 1876, and dedicated to our eldest sister, and the title was then altered to \"Jan of the Windmill, a Story of the Plains.\"\n\nThree poems of Julie's came out in the volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1873, \"The Willow Man,\" \"Ran away to Sea,\" and \"A Friend in the Garden\"; her name was not given to the last, but it is a pleasant little rhyme about a toad. She also wrote during this year \"Among the Merrows,\" a fantastic account of a visit she paid to the Aquarium at the Crystal Palace.\n\nIn October 1873, our Mother died, and my sister contributed a short memoir of her[22] to the November [58]number of Aunt Judy's Magazine. To the December number she gave \"Madam Liberality.\"\n\nFor two years after Mother's death, Julie shared the work of editing the Magazine with me, and then she gave it up, as we were not living together, and so found the plan rather inconvenient; also the task of reading MSS. and writing business letters wasted time which she could spend better on her own stories.\n\nAt the end of the year 1873, she brought out a book, \"Lob Lie-by-the-Fire, and other Tales,\" consisting of five stories, three of which—\"Timothy's Shoes,\" \"Benjy in Beastland,\" and \"The Peace Egg,\"—had already been published in Aunt Judy's Magazine, whilst \"Old Father Christmas\" had appeared in Little Folks; but the first tale of \"Lob\" was specially written for the volume.[23]\n\nThe character of McAlister in this story is a Scotchman of the Scotch, and, chiefly in consequence of this fact, the book was dedicated to James Boyn McCombie, an uncle of Major Ewing, who always showed a most kind and helpful interest in my sister's literary work.\n\nHe died a few weeks before she did, much to her sorrow, but the Dedication remained when the story came out in a separate form, illustrated by Mr. Caldecott. The incident which makes the tale[59] specially appropriate to be dedicated to so true and unobtrusive a philanthropist as Mr. McCombie was known to be, is the Highlander's burning anxiety to rescue John Broom from his vagrant career.\n\n\"Lob\" contains some of Julie's brightest flashes of humour, and ends happily, but in it, as in many of her tales, \"the dusky strand of death\" appears, inwoven with, and thereby heightening, the joys of love and life. It is a curious fact that, though her power of describing death-bed scenes was so vivid, I believe she never saw any one die; and I will venture to say that her description of McAlister's last hours surpasses in truth and power the end of Leonard's \"Short Life\"; the extinction of the line of \"Old Standards\" in Daddy Darwin; the unseen call that led Jan's Schoolmaster away; and will even bear comparison with Jackanapes' departure through the Grave to that \"other side\" where \"the Trumpets sounded for him.\"\n\nIn order to appreciate the end, it is almost necessary, perhaps, to have followed John Broom, the ne'er-do-weel lad, and McAlister, the finest man in his regiment, through the scenes which drew them together, and to read how the soldier, who might and ought to have been a \"sairgent,\" tried to turn the boy back from pursuing the downward path along which he himself had taken too many steps; and [60]then learn how the vagrant's grateful love and agility enabled him to awaken the sleeping sentinel at his post, and save \"the old soldier's honour.\"\n\nDeath-beds are not the only things which Julie had the power of picturing out of her inner consciousness apart from actual experience. She was much amused by the pertinacity with which unknown correspondents occasionally inquired after her \"little ones,\" unable to give her the credit of describing and understanding children unless she possessed some of her own. There is a graceful touch at the end of \"Lob,\" which seems to me one of the most delicate evidences of her universal sympathy with all sorts and conditions of men,—and women! It is similar in character to the passage I alluded to in \"Timothy's Shoes,\" where they clatter away for the last time, into silence.\n\n[62]\n\nEven after the sobering influences of middle age had touched him, and a wife and children bound him with the quiet ties of home, he had (at long intervals) his \"restless times,\" when his good \"missis\" would bring out a little store laid by in one of the children's socks, and would bid him \"Be off, and get a breath of the sea air,\" but on condition that the sock went with, him as his purse. John Broom always looked ashamed to go, but he came back the better, and his wife was quite easy in his absence with that confidence in her knowledge of \"the master,\" which is so mysterious to the unmarried.\n\n\"The sock 'll bring him home,\" said Mrs. Broom, and home he came, and never could say what he had been doing.\n\nIn 1874 Julie wrote \"A Great Emergency\" as a serial for the Magazine, and took great pains to corroborate the accuracy of her descriptions of barge life for it.[24] I remember our inspecting a barge on the canal at Aldershot, with a friend who understood all its details, and we arranged to go on an expedition in it to gain further experience, but were somehow prevented. The allusions to Dartmouth arose from our visit there, of which I have already spoken, and which took place whilst she was writing the tale; and her knowledge of the intricacies of the Great Eastern Railway between Fenchurch Street Station and North Woolwich came from the experience she gained when we went on expeditions to Victoria Docks, where one of our brothers was doing parochial work under Canon Boyd.\n\n[63]\n\nDuring 1874 five of her \"Verses for Children\" came out in the Magazine, two of which, \"Our Garden,\" and \"Three Little Nest-Birds,\" were written to fit old German woodcuts. The others were \"The Dolls' Wash,\" \"The Blue Bells on the Lea,\" and \"The Doll's Lullaby.\" She wrote an article on \"May-Day, Old Style and New Style,\" in 1874, and also contributed fifty-two brief \"Tales of the Khoja,\"[25] which she adapted from the Turkish by the aid of a literal translation of them given in Barker's Reading-Book of the Turkish Language, and by the help of Major Ewing, who possessed some knowledge of the Turkish language and customs, and assisted her in polishing the stories. They are thoroughly Eastern in character, and full of dry wit.\n\nI must here digress to speak of some other work that my sister did during the time she lived in Aldershot. Both she and Major Ewing took great interest in the amateur concerts and private musical performances that took place in the camp, and the V.C. in \"The Story of a Short Life,\" with a fine tenor voice, and a \"fastidious choice in the words of the songs he sang,\" is a shadow of these past days. The want that many composers felt of good words for setting to music, led Julie to try to write some, and eventually, in 1874, a book of \"Songs for Music, by [64]Four Friends,\"[26] was published; the contents were written by my sister and two of her brothers, and the Rev. G.J. Chester. This book became a standing joke amongst them, because one of the reviewers said it contained \"songs by four writers, one of whom was a poet,\" and he did not specify the one by name.\n\nDuring 1875 Julie was again aided by her husband in the work that she did for Aunt Judy's Magazine. \"Cousin Peregrine's three Wonder Stories \"—1. \"The Chinese Jugglers and the Englishman's Hand\"; 2. \"The Waves of the Great South Sea\"; and 3. \"Jack of Pera\"[27]—were a combination of his facts and her wording. She added only one more to her Old-fashioned Fairy Tales, \"Good Luck is Better than Gold,\" but it is one of her most finished bits of art, and she placed it first, when the tales came out in a volume.\n\nThe Preface to this book is well worth the study of those who are interested in the composition of Fairy literature; and the theories on which Julie wrote her own tales.[28]\n\nShe also wrote (in 1875) an article on \"Little Woods,\" and a domestic story called \"A very Ill-tempered Family.\"\n\nThe incident of Isobel's reciting the Te Deum is a [65]touching one, because the habit of repeating it by heart, especially in bed at night, was one which Julie herself had practised from the days of childhood, when, I believe, it was used to drive away the terrors of darkness. The last day on which she expressed any expectation of recovering from her final illness was one on which she said, \"I think I must be getting better, for I've repeated the Te Deum all through, and since I've been ill I've only been able to say a few sentences at once.\" This was certainly the last time that she recited the great Hymn of Praise before she joined the throng of those who sing it day and night before the throne of God. The German print of the Crucifixion, on which Isobel saw the light of the setting sun fall, is one which has hung over my sister's drawing-room fire-place in every home of wood or stone which she has had for many years past.\n\nThe Child Verse, \"A Hero to his Hobby-horse,\" came out in the Magazine volume for 1875, and, like many of the other verses, it was written to fit a picture.\n\nOne of the happiest inspirations from pictures, however, appeared in the following volume (1876), the story of \"Toots and Boots,\" but though the picture of the ideal Toots was cast like a shadow before him, the actual Toots, name and all complete, had a real existence, and his word-portrait was taken from life. He belonged to the mess of the Royal Engineers in the [66]South Camp, Aldershot, and was as dignified as if he held the office of President. I shall never forget one occasion on which he was invited to luncheon at Mrs. Ewing's hut, that I might have the pleasure of making his acquaintance; he had to be unwillingly carried across the Lines in the arms of an obliging subaltern, but directly he arrived, without waiting even for the first course, he struggled out of the officer's embrace and galloped back to his own mess-table, tail erect and thick with rage at the indignity he had undergone.\n\n\"Father Hedgehog and his Friends,\" in this same volume (1876), was also written to some excellent German woodcuts; and it, too, is a wonderfully brilliant sketch of animal life; perhaps the human beings in the tale are scarcely done justice to. We feel as if Sybil and Basil, and the Gipsy Mother and Christian, had scarcely room to breathe in the few pages that they are crowded into; there is certainly too much \"subject\" here for the size of the canvas!—but Father Hedgehog takes up little space, and every syllable about him is as keenly pointed as the spines on his back. The method by which he silenced awkward questions from any of his family is truly delightful:\n\nThen, the following season, we find the Hedgehog Son grown into a parent, and, with the \"little hoard of maxims\" he had inherited, checking the too inquiring minds of his offspring:\n\nOne more quotation must be made from the end of the story, where Father Hedgehog gives a list of the fates that befell his children:\n\nNumber one came to a sad end. What on the face of the wood made him think of pheasants' eggs I cannot conceive. I'm sure I never said anything about them! It was whilst he was scrambling along the edge of the covert, that he met the Fox, and very properly rolled himself into a ball. The Fox's nose was as long as his own, and he rolled my poor son over and over with it, till he rolled him into the stream. The young urchins swim like fishes, but just as he was scrambling to shore, the Fox caught him by the waistcoat and killed him. I do hate slyness!\n\nIt seems scarcely conceivable that any one can sympathize sufficiently with a Hedgehog as to place [68]himself in the latter's position, and share its paternal anxieties,—but I think Julie was able to do so, or, at any rate, her translations of the Hedgepig's whines were so ben trovati, they may well stand until some better interpreter of the languages of the brute creation rises up amongst us. As another instance of her breadth of sympathy with beasts, let us turn to \"A Week Spent in a Glass Pond\" (which also came out in Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1876), and quote her summary of the Great Water-beetle's views on life:\n\nAfter living as I can, in all three—water, dry land, and air,—I certainly prefer to be under water. Any one whose appetite is as keen, and whose hind-legs are as powerful as mine, will understand the delights of hunting, and being hunted, in a pond; where the light comes down in fitful rays and reflections through the water, and gleams among the hanging roots of the frog-bit, and the fading leaves of the water-starwort, through the maze of which, in and out, hither and thither, you pursue and are pursued, in cool and skilful chase, by a mixed company of your neighbours, who dart, and shoot, and dive, and come and go, and any one of whom, at any moment, may either eat you or be eaten by you. And if you want peace and quiet, where can one bury oneself so safely and completely as in the mud? A state of existence without mud at the bottom, must be a life without repose!\n\nI must here venture to remark, that the chief and lasting value of whatever both my sister and my mother wrote about animals, or any other objects in Nature, lies in the fact that they invariably took the [69]utmost pains to verify whatever statements they made relating to those objects. Spiritual Laws can only be drawn from the Natural World when they are based on Truth.\n\nJulie spared no trouble in trying to ascertain whether Hedgehogs do or do not eat pheasants' eggs; she consulted The Field, and books on sport, and her sporting friends, and when she found it was a disputed point, she determined to give the Hedgepig the benefit of the doubt. Then the taste for valerian, and the fox's method of capture, were drawn from facts, and the gruesome details as to who ate who in the Glass Pond were equally well founded!\n\nThis (1876) volume of the Magazine is rich in contributions from Julie, the reason being that she was stronger in health whilst she lived at Aldershot than during any other period of her life. The sweet dry air of the \"Highwayman's Heath\"—bared though it was of heather!—suited her so well, she could sleep with her hut windows open, and go out into her garden at any hour of the evening without fear of harm. She liked to stroll out and listen to \"Retreat\" being sounded at sundown, especially when it was the turn of some regiment with pipes to perform the duty; they sounded so shrill and weird, coming from the distant hill through the growing darkness.\n\nWe held a curious function one hot July evening[70] during Retreat, when, the Fates being propitious, it was the turn of the 42nd Highlanders to play. My sister had taken compassion on a stray collie puppy a few weeks before, and adopted him; he was very soft-coated and fascinating in his ways, despite his gawky legs, and promised to grow into a credit to his race. But it seemed he was too finely bred to survive the ravages of distemper, for, though he was tenderly nursed, he died. A wreath of flowers was hung round his neck, and, as he lay on his bier, Julie made a sketch of him, with the inscription, \"The Little Colley, Eheu! Taken in, June 14. In spite of care, died July 1. Speravimus meliora.\" Major [71]Ewing, wearing a broad Scotch bonnet, dug a grave in the garden, and as we had no \"dinner-bell\" to muffle, we waited till the pipers broke forth at sundown with an appropriate air, and then lowered the little Scotch dog into his resting-place.\n\nDuring her residence at Aldershot Julie wrote three of her longest books—\"A Flat Iron for a Farthing,\" \"Six to Sixteen,\" and \"Jan of the Windmill,\" besides all the shorter tales and verses that she contributed to the Magazine between 1870 and 1877. The two short tales which seem to me her very best came out in 1876, namely, \"Our Field\" (about which I have already spoken) and \"The Blind Man and the Talking Dog.\" Both the stories were written to fit some old German woodcuts, but they are perfectly different in style; \"Our Field\" is told in the language and from the fresh heart of a Child; whilst the \"Blind Man\" is such a picture of life from cradle to grave—aye, and stretching forward into the world beyond,—as could only have come forth from the experiences of Age. But though this be so, the lesson shown of how the Boy's story foreshadows the Man's history, is one which cannot be learned too early.\n\nJulie never pictured a dearer dog than the Peronet whom she originated from the fat stumpy-tailed puppy who is seen playing with the children in the woodcut to \"Our Field.\"\n\n[72]\n\nPeople sometimes asked us what kind of a dog he was, but we never knew, except that he was the nicest possible kind.... Peronet was as fond of the Field as we were. What he liked were the little birds. At least, I don't know that he liked them, but they were what he chiefly attended to. I think he knew that it was our field, and thought he was the watch-dog of it; and whenever a bird settled down anywhere, he barked at it, and then it flew away, and he ran barking after it till he lost it; by that time another had settled down, and then Peronet flew at him, all up and down the hedge. He never caught a bird, and never would let one sit down, if he could see it.\n\nThen what a vista is opened by the light that is \"left out\" in the concluding words:—\n\nI know that Our Field does not exactly belong to us. I wonder whom it does belong to? Richard says he believes it belongs to the gentleman who lives at the big red house among the trees. But he must be wrong; for we see that gentleman at church every Sunday, but we never saw him in Our Field.\n\nAnd I don't believe anybody could have such a field of their very own, and never come to see it, from one end of summer to the other.\n\nIt is almost impossible to quote portions of the \"Blind Man\" without marring the whole. The story is so condensed—only four pages in length; it is one of the most striking examples of my sister's favourite rule in composition, \"never use two words where one will do.\" But from these four brief pages we learn as much as if four volumes had been filled with descriptions of the characters of the Mayor's son and Aldegunda,—from her birthday, on which the [73]boy grumbled because \"she toddles as badly as she did yesterday, though she's a year older,\" and \"Aldegunda sobbed till she burst the strings of her hat, and the boy had to tie them afresh,\"—to the day of their wedding, when the Bridegroom thinks he can take possession of the Blind Man's Talking Dog, because the latter had promised to leave his master and live with the hero, if ever he could claim to be perfectly happy—happier than him whom he regarded as \"a poor wretched old beggar in want of everything.\"\n\nAs they rode together in search of the Dog:\n\nAldegunda thought to herself—\"We are so happy, and have so much, that I do not like to take the Blind Man's dog from him\"; but she did not dare to say so. One—if not two—must bear and forbear to be happy, even on one's wedding-day.\n\nAnd, when they reached their journey's end, Lazarus was no longer \"the wretched one ... miserable, poor, and blind,\" but was numbered amongst the blessed Dead, and the Dog was by his grave:\n\nThe \"Blind Man\" was inserted in the Magazine as an \"Old-Fashioned Fairy Tale,\" and Julie wrote another this year (1876) under the same heading, which was called \"I Won't.\"\n\nShe also wrote a delightfully funny Legend, \"The Kyrkegrim turned Preacher,\" about a Norwegian Brownie, or Niss, whose duty was \"to keep the church clean, and to scatter the marsh marigolds on the floor before service,\" but, like other church-sweepers, his soul was troubled by seeing the congregation neglect to listen to the preacher, and fall asleep during his sermons. Then the Kyrkegrim, feeling sure that he could make more impression on their hardened hearts than the priest did, ascended from the floor to the pulpit, and tried to set the world to rights; but eventually he was glad to return to his broom, and leave \"heavier responsibilities in higher hands.\"\n\n[75]\n\nShe contributed \"Hints for Private Theatricals. In Letters from Burnt Cork to Rouge Pot,\" which were probably suggested by the private theatricals in which she was helping at Aldershot; and she wrote four of her best Verses for Children: \"Big Smith,\" \"House-building and Repairs,\" \"An Only Child's Tea-party,\" and \"Papa Poodle.\"\n\n\"The Adventures of an Elf\" is a poem to some clever silhouette pictures of Fedor Flinzer's, which she freely adapted from the German. \"The Snarling Princess\" is a fairy tale also adapted from the German; but neither of these contributions was so well worth the trouble of translation as a fine dialogue from the French of Jean Macé called \"War and the Dead,\" which Julie gave to the number of Aunt Judy for October 1866.[29] \"The Princes of Vegetation\" (April 1876) is an article on Palm-trees, to which family Linnæus had given this noble title.\n\nThe last contribution, in 1876, which remains to be mentioned is \"Dandelion Clocks,\" a short tale; but it will need rather a long introduction, as it opens out into a fresh trait of my sister's character, namely, her love for flowers.\n\nIt need scarcely be said that she wrote as accurately about them as about everything else; and, in addition to this, she enveloped them in such an[76] atmosphere of sentiment as served to give life and individuality to their inanimate forms. The habit of weaving stories round them began in girlhood, when she was devoted to reading Mr. J.G. Wood's graceful translation of Alphonse Karr's Voyage autour de mon Jardin. The book was given to her in 1856 by her father, and it exercised a strong influence upon her mind. What else made the ungraceful Buddlæa lovely in her eyes? I confess that when she pointed out the shrub to me, for the first time, in Mr. Ellacombe's garden, it looked so like the \"Plum-pudding tree\" in the \"Willow pattern,\" and fell so far short of my expectation of the plant over which the two florists had squabbled, that I almost wished that I had not seen it! Still I did not share their discomfiture so fully as to think \"it no longer good for anything but firewood!\"\n\nKarr's fifty-eighth \"Letter\" nearly sufficed to enclose a declaration of love in every bunch of \"yellow roses\" which Julie tied together; and to plant an \"Incognito\" for discovery in every bed of tulips she looked at; whilst her favourite Letter XL., on the result produced by inhaling the odour of bean flowers, embodies the spirit of the ideal existence which she passed, as she walked through the fields of our work-a-day world:\n\n[77]\n\nThe beans were in full blossom. But a truce to this cold-hearted pleasantry. No, it is not a folly to be under the empire of the most beautiful—the most noble feelings; it is no folly to feel oneself great, strong, invincible; it is not a folly to have a good, honest, and generous heart; it is no folly to be filled with good faith; it is not a folly to devote oneself for the good of others; it is not a folly to live thus out of real life.\n\nNo, no; that cold wisdom which pronounces so severe a judgment upon all it cannot do; that wisdom which owes its birth to the death of so many great, noble, and sweet things; that wisdom which only comes with infirmities, and which decorates them with such fine names—which calls decay of the powers of the stomach and loss of appetite sobriety; the cooling of the heart and the stagnation of the blood a return to reason; envious impotence a disdain for futile things;—this wisdom would be the greatest, the most melancholy of follies, if it were not the commencement of the death of the heart and the senses.\n\n\"Dandelion Clocks\" resembles one of Karr's \"Letters\" in containing the germs of a three volumed romance, but they are the germs only—and the \"proportions\" of the picture are consequently well preserved. Indeed, the tale always reminds me of a series of peaceful scenes by Cuyp, with low horizons, sleek cattle, and a glow in the sky betokening the approach of sunset. First we have \"Peter Paul and his two sisters playing in the pastures\" at blowing dandelion clocks:\n\nThe actual outlines of this scene may be traced in the German woodcut to which the tale was written, but the colouring is Julie's! The only disturbing element in this quiet picture is Peter Paul's restless, inquiring heart. What wonder that when his bulb-growing uncle fails to solve the riddle of life, Peter Paul should go out into the wider world and try to find a solution for himself? But the answers to our life problems full often are to be found within, for those who will look, and so Peter Paul comes back after some years to find that:\n\nThe elder sister was married and had two children. She had grown up very pretty—a fair woman, with liquid misleading eyes. They looked as if they were gazing into the far future, but they did not see an inch beyond the farm. Anna was a very plain copy of her in body; in mind she was the elder sister's echo. They were very fond of each other, and the prettiest thing about them was their faithful love for their mother, whose memory was kept as green as pastures after rain.\n\nPeter Paul's temperament, however, was not one that could adapt itself to a stagnant existence; so when his three weeks on shore are ended, we see him on his way from the Home Farm to join his ship:\n\nAnd with this salutary home-thrust (which thoroughly common-place minds have such a provoking faculty for giving) Leena went back to her children and cattle.\n\nHappy for the artistic temperament that can profit by such rebuffs!\n\n[80]\n\nPART III.\n\nOne of the causes which helped to develop my sister's interest in flowers was the sight of the fresh ones that she met with on going to live in New Brunswick after her marriage. Every strange face was a [81]subject for study, and she soon began to devote a note-book to sketches of these new friends, naming them scientifically from Professor Asa Gray's Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, whilst Major Ewing added as many of the Melicete names as he could glean from Peter, a member of the tribe, who had attached himself to the Ewings, and used constantly to come about their house. Peter and his wife lived in a small colony of the Melicete Indians, which was established on the opposite side of the St. John River to that on which the Reka Dom stood. Mrs. Peter was the most skilful embroiderer in beads amongst her people, and Peter himself the best canoe-builder. He made a beautiful one for the Ewings, which they constantly used; and when they returned to England his regret at losing them was wonderfully mitigated by the present which Major Ewing gave him of an old gun; he declared no gentleman had ever thought of giving him such a thing before!\n\nJulie introduced several of the North American flowers into her stories. The Tabby-striped Arum, or Jack-in-the-Pulpit (as it is called in Mr. Whittier's delightful collection of child-poems[30]), appears in \"We and the World,\" where Dennis, the rollicking Irish hero, unintentionally raises himself in the estimation of his sober-minded Scotch companion Alister, [82]by betraying that he \"can speak with other tongues,\" from his ability to converse with a squaw in French on the subject of the bunch of Arums he had gathered, and was holding in his hand.\n\nThis allusion was only a slight one, but Julie wrote a complete story on one species of Trillium, having a special affection for the whole genus. Trilliums are amongst the North American herbaceous plants which have lately become fashionable, and easy to be bought in England; but ere they did so, Julie made some ineffectual attempts to transplant tubers of them into English soil; and the last letter she received from Fredericton contained a packet of red Trillium seeds, which came too late to be sown before she died. The species which she immortalized in \"The Blind Hermit and the Trinity Flower,\" was T. erythrocarpum. The story is a graceful legend of an old Hermit whose life was spent in growing herbs for the healing of diseases; and when he, in his turn, was struck with blindness, he could not reconcile himself to the loss of the occupation which alone seemed to make him of use in the world. \"They also serve who only stand and wait\" was a hard lesson to learn; every day he prayed for some Balm of Gilead to heal his ill, and restore his sight, and the prayer was answered, though not in the manner that he desired. First he was supplied with a serving-boy, who became eyes and feet to him, [83]from gratitude for cures which the Hermit had done to the lad himself; and then a vision was granted to the old man, wherein he saw a flower which would heal his blindness:—\n\nA root of this plant was sent to the Hermit by a heavenly messenger, which the boy planted, and anxiously watched the growth of, cheering his master with the hope—\"Patience, my Father, thou shalt see yet!\"\n\nMeantime greater light was breaking in upon the Hermit's soul than had been there before:\n\n\"My son, I repent me that I have not been patient under affliction. Moreover, I have set thee an ill example, in that I have murmured at that which God—Who knoweth best—ordained for me.\"\n\nAnd, when the boy ofttimes repeated, \"Thou shalt yet see,\" the Hermit answered, \"If God will. When God will. As God will.\"\n\nAnd at last, when the white bud opens, and the blood-like stains are visible within, he who once was blind sees, but his vision is opened on eternal Day.\n\nIn Aunt Judy's Magazine for 1877 there is another Flower Legend, but of an English plant, the Lily of the Valley. Julie called the tale by the old-fashioned name of the flower, \"Ladders to Heaven.\" The scenery is pictured from spots near her Yorkshire home, where she was accustomed to seeing beautiful valleys blackened by smoke from iron-furnaces, and the woods beyond the church, where she liked to ramble, filled with desolate heaps of black shale, the refuse left round the mouths of disused coal and iron-[86]stone pits. I remember how glad we were when we found the woolly-leaved yellow Mullein growing on some of these dreary places, and helping to cover up their nakedness. In later years my sister heard with much pleasure that a mining friend was doing what he could to repair the damages he had made on the beauty of the country, by planting over the worked-out mines such trees and plants as would thrive in the poor and useless shale, which was left as a covering to once rich and valuable spots.\n\n\"Brothers of Pity\" (Aunt Judy's Magazine, 1877) shows a deep and minute insight into the feelings of a solitary child, which one fancies Julie must have acquired by the process of contrast with her own surroundings of seven brethren and sisters. A similar power of perception was displayed in her verses on \"An Only Child's Tea-party.\"\n\nShe remembered from experiences of our own childhood what a favourite game \"funerals\" is with those whose \"whole vocation\" is yet \"endless imitation\"; and she had watched the soldiers' children in camp play at it so often that she knew it was not only the bright covering of the Union Jack which made death lovely in their eyes, \"Blind Baby\" enjoyed it for the sake of the music; and even civilians' children, who see the service devoid of sweet sounds, and under its blackest and most revolting aspect, still are [87]strangely fascinated thereby. Julie had heard about one of these, a lonely motherless boy, whose chief joy was to harness Granny to his \"hearse\" and play at funeral processions round the drawing-room, where his dead mother had once toddled in her turn.\n\nThe boy in \"Brothers of Pity\" is the principal character, and the animals occupy minor positions. Cock-Robin only appears as a corpse on the scene; and Julie did not touch much on bird pets in any of her tales, chiefly because she never kept one, having too much sympathy with their powers and cravings for flight to reconcile herself to putting them in cages. The flight and recapture of Cocky in \"Lob\" were drawn from life, though the bird did not belong to her, but her descriptions of how he stood on the window-sill \"scanning the summer sky with his fierce eyes, and flapping himself in the breeze,... bowed his yellow crest, spread his noble wings, and sailed out into the æther\";... and his \"dreams of liberty in the tree-tops,\" all show the light in which she viewed the practice of keeping birds in confinement. Her verses on \"Three Little Nest-Birds\" and her tale of the Thrush in \"An Idyll of the Wood\" bear witness to the same feeling. Major Ewing remembers how often she used to wish, when passing bird-shops, that she could \"buy the whole collection and set them all free,\"—a desire which suggests a quaint [88]vision of her in Seven Dials, with a mixed flock of macaws, canaries, parrots and thrushes shrieking and flying round her head; but the wish was worthy of her in (what Mr. Howells called) \"woman's heaven-born ignorance of the insuperable difficulties of doing right.\"\n\nIn this (1877) volume of Aunt Judy's Magazine there is a striking portrait of another kind of animal pet, the \"Kit\" who is resolved to choose her own \"cradle,\" and not to sleep where she is told. It is needless to say that she gets her own way, since,—\n\nShe has, however, the grace to purr when she is pleased, which all kits and cats have not!\n\nThere are three other sets of verses in the volume, and all of them were originally written to old wood-cuts, but have since been re-illustrated by Mr. André, and published by the S.P.C.K.\n\n\"A Sweet Little Dear\" is the personification of a selfish girl, and \"Master Fritz\" of an equally selfish boy; but his sister Katerina is delicious by contrast, as she gives heed to his schemes—\n\nAn old-fashioned fairy tale, \"The Magician turned Mischief-maker,\" came out in 1877; and a short domestic tale called \"A Bad Habit\"; but Julie was unable to supply any long contributions this year, as in April her seven-years home at Aldershot was broken up in consequence of Major Ewing being ordered to Manchester, and her time was occupied by the labour and process of removing.\n\nShe took down the motto which she had hung over her hearth to temper her joy in the comfort thereof,—Ut migraturus habita,—and moved the scroll on to her next resting-place. No one knew better than she the depth of Mrs. Hemans' definition,—\"What is home,—and where,—but with the loving—\" and most truly can it be said that wherever Julie went she carried \"Home\" with her; freedom, generosity, and loving welcome were always to be found in her house,—even if upholstery and carpets ran short! It was a joke amongst some of her friends that though rose-coloured curtains and bevelled-edged looking-glasses could be counted upon in their bed-rooms, such commonplace necessities as soap might be forgotten, and the glasses be fastened in artistic corners [90]of the rooms, rather than in such lights as were best adapted for shaving by!\n\nJulie followed the course of the new lines in which her lot was cast most cheerfully, but the \"mighty heart\" could not really support the \"little body\"; and the fatigue of packing, combined with the effects of the relaxing climate of Bowdon, near Manchester, where she went to live, acted sadly upon her constitution. She was able, however, after settling in the North, to pay more frequent visits to Ecclesfield than before; and the next work that she did for Aunt Judy's Magazine bears evidences of the renewal of Yorkshire associations.\n\nThis story, \"We and the World,\" was specially intended for boys, and the \"law of contrast\" in it was meant to be drawn between the career which Cripple Charlie spent at home, and those of the three lads who went out into \"the world\" together. Then, too, she [91]wished, as I mentioned before, to contrast the national types of character in the English, Scotch, and Irish heroes, and to show the good contained in each of them. But the tale seemed to have been begun under an unlucky star. The first half, which came out in the first six numbers of the Magazine for 1878, is excellent as a matter of art; and as pictures of North-country life and scenery nothing can be better than Walnut-tree Farm and Academy, the Miser's Funeral, and the Bee-master's Visit to his Hives on the Moors, combined with attendance at Church on a hot Sunday afternoon in August (it need scarcely be said that the church is a real one). But, good though all this is, it is too long and \"out of proportion,\" when one reflects how much of the plot was left to be unravelled in the other half of the tale. \"The World\" could not properly be squeezed into a space only equal in size to that which had been devoted to \"Home.\" If Julie had been in better health, she would have foreseen the dilemma into which she was falling, but she did not, and in the autumn of 1878 she had to lay the tale aside, for Major Ewing was sent to be stationed at York. \"We\" was put by until the following volume, but for this (1878) one she wrote two other short contributions,—\"The Yellow Fly, a Tale with a Sting in it,\" and \"So-so.\"\n\nTo those who do not read between the lines, \"So-so\" sounds (as he felt) \"very soft and pleasant,\" [92]but to me the tale is in Julie's saddest strain, because of the suspicion of hopelessness that pervades it;—a spirit which I do not trace in any of her other writings.\n\n\"Be sure, my child,\" said the widow to her little daughter, \"that you always do just as you are told.\"\n\n\"Very well, mother.\"\n\n\"Or at any rate do what will do just as well,\" said the small house-dog, as he lay blinking at the fire.\n\n\"For the future, my child,\" said the widow, \"I hope you will always do just as you are told, whatever So-so may say.\"\n\n\"I will, mother,\" said little Joan. (And she did.) But the house-dog sat and blinked. He dared not speak, he was in disgrace.\n\n\"I do not feel quite sure about So-so. Wild dogs often amend their ways far on this side of the gallows, and the Faithful sometimes fall, but when any one begins by being only so-so, he is very apt to be so-so to the end. So-so's so seldom change.\"\n\nBefore turning from the record of my sister's life at Manchester, I must mention a circumstance which gave her very great pleasure there. In the summer of 1875 she and I went up from Aldershot to see the Exhibition of Water-Colours by the Royal Society of Painters, and she was completely fascinated by a picture of Mr. J.D. Watson's, called \"A Gentleman of the Road.\" It represented a horseman at daybreak, allowing his horse to drink from a stream, whilst he sat half-turned in the saddle to look back at a gallows which was visible on the horizon against the beams of [93]rising light. The subject may sound very sensational, but it was not that aspect of it which charmed my sister; she found beauty as well as romance in it, and after we returned to camp in the evening she became so restless and engrossed by what she had seen, that she got up during the night, and planned out the headings of a story on the picture, adding—characteristically—a moral or \"soul\" to the subject by a quotation[31] from Thomas à Kempis—Respice finem. \"In all things remember the end.\"\n\nThis \"mapped-out\" story, I am sorry to say, remains unfinished. The manuscript went through many vicissitudes, was inadvertently torn up and thrown into the waste-paper basket, whence it was rescued and the pieces carefully enclosed in an envelope ready for mending. It was afterwards lost again for many months in a box that was sent abroad, but the fragments have been put together and copied, as they are interesting from the promise that lies in the few words that remain.\n\nA Gentleman of the Road.\n\n[Here the sheet of paper is torn, but from the words on the part left it is evident that there was a description of the frontispiece in the schoolmaster's book. Apparently the subject of the picture was allegorical, and the figures of \"monstrous beasts\" were interspersed with \"devices\" and \"scrolls with inscriptions,\" together with figures]\n\nThis fragment at any rate serves to show what a strong impression the picture had made upon Julie's mind, so it will readily be imagined how intensely delighted she was when she unexpectedly made the acquaintance, at Manchester, of Mr. Galloway, who [96]proved to have bought Mr. Watson's work, and he was actually kind enough to lend the treasure to her for a considerable time, so that she could study it thoroughly, and make a most accurate copy of it. Mr. Galloway's friendship, and that of some other people whom she first met at Bowdon, were the brightest spots in Julie's existence during this period.\n\nIn September 1878 the Ewings removed to Fulford, near York, and, on their arrival, Julie at once devoted herself to adorning her new home. We were very much amused by the incredulous amazement betrayed on the stolid face of an elderly workman, to whom it was explained that he was required to distemper the walls of the drawing-room with a sole colour, instead of covering them with a paper, after the manner of all the other drawing-rooms he had ever had to do with. But he was too polite to express his difference of taste by more than looks;—and some days after the room was finished, with etchings duly hung on velvet in the panels of the door,—the sole-coloured walls well covered with pictures, whence they stood out undistracted by gold and flowery paper patterns—the distemperer called, and asked if he might be allowed, as a favour, to see the result of Mrs. Ewing's arrangements. I forget if he expressed anything by words, as he stood in the middle of the room twisting his hat in his fingers—[97]but we had learned to read his face, and Julie was fully satisfied with the fresh expression of amazement mixed with admiration which she saw there.\n\nOne theory which she held strongly about the decoration of houses was, that the contents ought to represent the associations of the inmates, rather than the skill of their upholsterer; and for this reason she would not have liked to limit any of her rooms to one special period, such as Queen Anne's, unless she had possessed an old house, built at some date to which a special kind of furniture belonged. She contrived to make her home at York a very pretty one; but it was of short duration, for in March 1879 Major Ewing was despatched to Malta, and Julie had to begin to pack her Lares and Penates once more.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be wondered that she was allowed to spend her time and strength on the labour of packing, which a professional worker would have done far better,—but it is easier to see the mistakes of others than to rectify our own! There were many difficulties to be encountered, not the least of these being Julie's own strong will, and bad though it was, in one sense, for her to be physically over-tired, it was better than letting her be mentally so; and to an active brain like hers, \"change of occupation\" is the only possible form of \"rest.\" Professional packers and road and rail cars represent money, and [98]Julie's skill in packing both securely and economically was undeniably great. This is not surprising if we hold, as an old friend does, that ladies would make far better housemaids than uneducated women do, because they would throw their brains as well as muscles into their work. Julie did throw her brains into everything, big or little, that she undertook; and one of her best and dearest friends,—whose belief in my sister's powers and \"mission\" as a writer were so strong that she almost grudged even the time \"wasted\" on sketching, which might have been given to penning more stories for the age which boasts Gordon as its hero,—and who, being with Julie at her death, could not believe till the very End came that she would be taken, whilst so much seemed to remain for her to do here,—confessed to me afterwards she had learned to see that Julie's habit of expending her strength on trifles arose from an effort of nature to balance the vigour of her mind, which was so much greater than that of her body.\n\nDuring the six months that my sister resided in York she wrote a few contributions for Aunt Judy's Magazine. To the number for January 1879 she gave \"Flaps,\" a sequel to \"The Hens of Hencastle.\"\n\nThe latter story was not written by her, but was a free adaptation which Colonel Yeatman-Biggs made from the German of Victor Blüthgen. Julie had [99]been greatly amused by the tale, but, finding that it ended in a vague and unsatisfactory way, she could not be contented, so took up her pen and wrote a finale, her chief aim being to provide a happy ending for the old farm-dog, Flaps himself, after whom she named her sequel. The writing is so exactly similar to that of \"The Hens,\" that the two portions can scarcely be identified as belonging to different writers. Julie used often to reproach me for indulging in what John Wesley called \"the lust of finishing,\" but in matters concerning her own art she was as great an offender on this score as any one else!\n\nJulie gave a set of verses on \"Canada Home\" to the same number as \"Flaps,\" and to the March (1879) number she gave some other verses on \"Garden Lore.\" In April the second part of \"We and the World\" began to appear, and a fresh character was introduced, who is one of the most important and touching features of the tale. Biddy Macartney is a real old Irish melody in herself, with her body tied to a coffee-barrow in the Liverpool Docks, and her mind ever wandering in search of the son who had run away to sea. Jack, the English hero, comes across Biddy in the docks just before he starts as a stowaway for America, and his stiff, crude replies to her voluble outpourings are essentially British and boy-like:—\n\n[100]\n\nThere is another new character in the second part of \"We,\" who is also a fine picture:—Alister the blue-eyed Scotch lad, with his respect for \"book-learning,\" and his powers of self-denial and endur[102]ance; but Julie certainly had a weakness for the Irish nation, and the tender grace with which she touches Dennis O'Moore and Biddy shines conspicuously throughout the story. In one scene, however, I think she brings up her Scotch hero neck-and-neck, if not ahead, of her favourite Irishman.\n\nThis is in Chapter VII., where an entertainment is being held on board ship, and Dennis and Alister are called upon in turn to amuse the company with a song. Dennis gets through his ordeal well; he has a beautiful voice, which makes him independent of the accompaniment of a fiddle (the only musical instrument on board), and Julie describes his simpatico rendering of \"Bendemeer's Stream\" from the way in which she loved to hear one of our brothers sing it. He had learned it by ear on board ship from a fellow-passenger, and she was never tired of listening to the melody. When this same brother came to visit her whilst she was ill at Bath, and sang to her as she lay in bed,—\"Bendemeer's Stream\" was the one strain she asked for, and the last she heard.\n\nDennis O'Moore's performance met with warm applause, and then the boatswain, who had a grudge against Alister, because the Scotch Captain treated his countryman with leniency, taunted the shy and taciturn lad to \"contribute to the general entertainment.\"\n\n[103]\n\nThe description of Alister's song, as well as that of Dennis, was to some extent drawn from life, Julie having been accustomed to hear \"Scots, wha hae\" rendered by a Scot with more soul than voice, who always \"moved the hearts of the people as one man\" by his patriotic fire.\n\nMy sister was greatly aided by two friends in her descriptions of the scenery in \"We,\" such as the vivid account of Bermuda and the waterspout in Chapter XI., and that of the fire at Demerara in Chapter XII., and she owed to the same kind helpers also the accuracy of her nautical phrases and her Irish dialect. Certainly this second part of the tale is full of interest, but I cannot help wishing that the [105]materials had been made into two books instead of one. There are more than enough characters and incidents to have"
