By Philip Sinsheimer\n\nLet’s be honest, before I set foot at the beautiful Movia wine bar in Slovenia’s capital, I had never heard of “orange wines”. Have you? If not, the best thing is to do is go right now over there and ask for an orange wine tasting. For 18€, you will get a flight of 4 of them, beautifully presented and explained by the great staff, possibly Leonard, the charming and oh so enthusiastic young sommelier in the making..\n\nI received a royal treatment from Borut, the manager of the wine bar, located on one of the most passing streets of Ljubljana’s center. It was 10 pm and all the tables outside were taken, so we started our tasting inside, historic looking bar with wood panels and huge counter. But, wherever we were, I know you’re burning to know what in the world are orange wines?\n\nThe short and simple answer is that they are NOT of course wines made out of fermented oranges! No, they are white wines with a dark and deep yellow hue, some leaning towards a true orange color. Why this color? Because of the way they are made. In short, white grapes are crushed and left to macerate and ferment leaving the juices in contact with the skins and pits. For how long? It depends, up to a year. The process is very natural in a way, often no yeast or other additives need to be added. Since when has this technique been done? Only 5000 years ago, approximately, especially in the Caucasus region and what now is Georgia (the country). But, it’s only 20 years or so ago that the process made a big come back\n\nHere we are, Slovenia having been with Italy one of the wine countries at the forefront of this revival. So, if in doubt, you are in the right place and in good hands to discover the world of orange wines. Ok, how do they taste like? Imagine a light, pale, crisp, light pinot grigio from Veneto… well, it’s about the perfect opposite of that: mature, deep, with tannins reminding red wines (because of the skin contact) and complex. These are serious, bold, sipping white wines demanding to be served cold, but not chilled, definitely not the type of wine you serve in an ice bucket by the pool. To go with them, Vinoteka Movia also offers various plates of delicacies to round things up, including some gorgeous and perfectly sliced “pata negra”, the king of Spanish cured hams, but also local charcuterie, cheese and Italian mortadella, for example. Now, orange wines are not for everyone. Some may actually be turned off by their semi-oxidized aromas: instead of appreciating expressions of honey, tropical nut, cooked apple and hazelnut, they may think this wine has passed its age or has been left opened on the counter for too long, thus this wood varnish and linseed oil smell and flavor.\n\nIt’s alright, no panic… You are entitled to your taste, Borut won’t hate you or eat you up! He is prepared with about every type of wine you may like in the house. And yes, all of them Slovenian wines. Go for a flight of white wines, red wines or a mix of both with a tasting of various Movia wines, Movia being a very large producer located in Ceglo, on the western side of Slovenia, close to the order with Italy. Trust me, Slovenia is THE “under-discovered” wine country. The diversity of the terroirs and wine styles may be actually their obstacle to global recognition, because it is quite difficult to any non-Slovenian to decipher what’s written on a bottle: what refers to the area, what to the grape varietal, what to the producer?\n\nWith its fantastic staff, so attentive and knowledgeable, the quality of the pours (and of the gorgeous glasses used), I can tell you Vinoteka Movia is THE place to go for both newcomers to the world of orange wines and Slovenian wines in general, and aficionados who already know a thing or two on the matter, ready to be wowed and ask for more!\n\nFor more info Vinoteka Movia\n\nPosted on April 23, 2023\n\nWelcome to the western part of the province of Asti, between the Tanaro river and the steep Moscato hills, characterized by a predominantly hilly landscape, enriched by historic villages including Moncalvo, Grazzano Badoglio, Montemagno, Vignale, many small pearls in a sea of hills and wine-growing landscapes which have become a UNESCO world heritage site, featuring places of art such as Palazzo Alfieri, the Risorgimento Museum, Palazzo Mazzetti.\n\nIn Castagnole Monferrato (Asti) in Piedmont, Italy, we discovered the Montalbera farm, a suggestive structure which, in addition to the production of excellent wines, offers a showroom for wine tastings, relaxation rooms, yoga sessions in the barrel room, swimming pool and jacuzzi overlooking the vineyards.\n\nAll around triumphs a true amphitheater of vineyards where many varieties of wines are born (Barbera d’Asti, Grignolino, Viognier, Monferrato Nebbiolo) and “last but not least” the Ruchè docg, a red produced from an indigenous vine, reborn thanks to the research of Franco Morando whose the most selected particles such as Ruché LACCENTO and Ruché LIMPRESA are processed 12 months of wood to obtain the Docg.i.\n\nFor three generations, the Morando family has been passionately dedicated to the fruit of their vineyards, animated by a production philosophy that puts wine at the center of everything, enhancing the peculiarities of the vineyards and enhancing their personality. It all started in the 1980s, when the family began (and continues) to acquire land in addition to the current 175 hectares.Thanks to them, the rebirth of Ruchè took place, a red produced from an indigenous vine of the same name typical of eight countries and other varieties (Barbera d’Asti, Grignolino, Viognier, Monferrato Nebbiolo)\n\nHere is an extremely elegant, silky, warm wine on the palate, with a great balance that reflects the international taste of the modern taster and attentive to innovative pleasures, matured in steel tanks and subsequently bottled positioned horizontally at a controlled temperature, Ruchè is a wine with an unmistakable character with a bright garnet red colour, pleasant floral hints of rose and violet, fruity notes of apricot and the spiciness that emerges with evolution making it immediately recognizable in the glass\n\nLa Sponda Bresciana del Garda can be a perfect weekend for those who love nature, history, art and good food. Lovers of food and wine tours and gourmet enthusiasts will find fantastic dishes both in the traditional menus and in the re-edition of centuries-old recipes. 70 km of coastline and 20 km of hinterland await you, where ancient traditions, stories of real life, unique products linked to companies that have been handed down recipes, advice and… exquisite dishes at the table for generations are concentrated.\n\nThe Sponda Bresciana halfway embraces the western profile of the great lake mirror, scattering it with landscape beauties, cultural heritage and food and wine excellences, which testify to the union between the products of the earth with the rich quantity of refined lake fish, including pike, whitefish and bleak, here traditionally eaten in brine..\n\nThe production of wine and oil is remarkable, one of the leading producers is Perla del Garda whose ambitious idea was to bring the vine back to the morainic hills of our farm. We find Trebbiano di Lugana or Turbiana, Sauvignon, Riesling, Chardonnay and Incontro Manzoni as well as the white wine varieties. Rebo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon represent the types of our red grapes. The harvest is carried out exclusively by hand, selecting the bunches and placing them in small boxes which are quickly brought to the cellar.a.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the famous Michelin Guide chose Franciavorta to present all the starred restaurants in 2022, signing a profound sharing in terms of food and wine enhancement, and a sustainable environmental approach, crowned by Consorzio per la tutela del Franciacorta\n\nOn the green transition front, Franciacorta has been able to perfect a viticulture leader in sustainability, champion of an agriculture careful to minimize environmental impacts and improve functional biodiversity within the vineyard ecosystem.\n\nDid we say ‘Franciacorta’? … In the heart of this eno-generous land, we find the Azienda Agricola Mirabella Franciacorta which since 1979 has been producing wines that are unique in character, typicality, naturalness and quality. Teresio Schiavi, heart and founder of Mirabella and his sons Alessandro and Alberto, have always been champions of sustainability, closeness to man and his well-being. Mirabella was among the first companies to embrace organic viticulture (Valoritalia certification) a concrete sign of civic and environmental sensitivity\n\nThe last jewel by Follador Prosecco dal 1769 is called FOSÉLIOS Millesimato Brut D.O.C.G. Brut D.O.C.G.\n\nVegan Friendly, fresh and pleasantly savory sparkling wine, decidedly fruity with clear notes of green apple and pear with delicious floral notes on the finish. The audience of young people has been thought of, to whom a further touch of originality is dedicated. in fact, the label offers a surprising luminous effect …. If exposed to LED light: the Follador logo and the name of the wine “light up” to help make the moment of the toast even more festive and engaging As a hymn to light, conviviality and youth, the term Fosélios merges the Greek noun Phos (“Light”) with Eliosche “God of the Sun”.\n\nCinque Terre, a a short piece of the Ligurian coastline, just West of the border with Tuscany.\n\nMonterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore are five multi-colored borghi (villages) overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. They are pretty close to each other, a few minutes distance by car or train. Better yet, a boat, weather permitting, will take you back and forth, making an unforgettable five stop mini cruise. If you like to hike, you can also reach them via a beautiful trail and enjoy spectacular sea views.\n\n. White Wine Cinque Terre, the famous white wine of the area that requires mountaineering skills to be produced, given the steep slope on which the grapes grow. facing the sea .\n\nSciacchetrà, it ‘s time to toast!\n\nImagine: a secret bottle kept in the cave for years (sometimes more than 30). It is the rich and velvety wine called sciacchetrà. This ancient treasure is resurrected on the occasion of a wedding as the greatest gift the groom’s family can offer to the bride’s family. I had the privilege of opening a bottle that was over 10 years old. Intense color, from golden to amber shades. The taste is a fruity and floral bouquet reminiscent of a Mediterranean garden: hints of dried fruit, apricot jam, nectarines, vanilla, chestnut honey and spices.\n\nSEE FULL ARTICLE (English)\n\nFor generations, the Ciociaria companies have been producing sheep and goat cheeses, grazing animals, farm animal rennet. Among the most delicious are Caciofiore, Pecorino di Picinisco, Conciato di San Vittore, the Marzolina slow food presidium. To accompany a “pecorinoso” dish, nothing better than a glass of the vigorous cabernet produced by Masseria Barone, in the heart of Ciociaria, both the gold Atina “Ricucc” and the Riserva “Marcon”, with their hand-painted label, are perfect companions. journey of Lazio dairy excellence.\n\nIl Cabernet Sauvignon it has been cultivated, since 1860, on the sunny hills that frame the historic center of Atina. After careful harvesting and manual selection of the best grapes, an accurate vinification follows from which this elegant and powerful wine is obtained. A patient aging in French oak barrels allows the development of a complex and intense aroma. Brilliant red with intense garnet reflections. The taste shows sweet tannic notes in balance with a structured and persistent body.\n\nMonferrato is a land made up of beautiful hills (a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2014), villages, castles and great wine traditions. Few kilometers away are the Turin-Milan (Chivasso east exit) and Turin-Piacenza (Asti east exit) motorways. Of course, to crown the weekend, it is essential to enjoy the gastronomic delicacies of Monferrato. Among the great classics of the Piedmontese tradition, not to be missed, given the favorable season, the tasting of the prized white Alba truffle accompanied by “noble” wines\n\nIn the scenic Vigna della Pieve in Cocconato, in addition to Stradivario, the grapes for Thou Bianc, surprising Piedmontese Chardonnay, Sauvignon Relais Bianc and Albarossa are produced. The Barolo Docg Bava and Langhe Nebbiolo are born from the Castiglione Falletto farmhouse in the Langhe, in the province of Cuneo, in the heart of the Scarrone cru. The Piedmont aromatic herbs have always been in the Bava tradition: in particular Malvasia, (Rosetta and Malvasia Rosé), Moscato d’Asti and Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato.\n\nAmong vineyards, suggestive villages, sanctuaries of ancient devotion and castles dating back to the 10th century, you will discover the Valtènesi famous for the beauty of the lake and hilly landscape and for the production of rosé wines, whose the characteristic grape variety and great heritage is Groppello. Doc Valtenesi is the wine, a modern and innovative expression of the Garda winemaking tradition, the sales of the first bottles of “Valtenesi” Chiaretto began on a truly romantic date: February 14, 2012, Valentine’s Day. In fact, it is easy to fall in love with this delicate but also seductive rosé …\n\nJust as in the 19th century it happened to the Venetian senator Pompeo Molmenti who, in addition to being a historian and art critic, was also a capable winemaker and agronomist. Pompeo had married a noblewoman who owned a villa in Moniga surrounded by 15 hectares of land. there, among the vineyards overlooking the great lake, Pompeo began to try his hand at the production of Chiaretto, a delicate wine with spicy aromas, enchanting color, excellent balance. and intense fruity notes, excellent when accompanied by savory first courses, fish, meat and medium-aged cheeses.\n\nChiaretto is nicknamed “the wine of a night”; a name that derives from the personal vinification system put in place in an operation that takes place over the course of a single night, by each producer and which gives each individual Chiaretto a unique color, scent and fragrance.\n\nIl Consorzio Valtènesi Riviera del Garda Classico, promoted by the enterprising Jury Pagani, it protects the cultivation and production of this rich variety of red and white wines that blend harmoniously with a landscape of great charm, among hills, olive trees and lush Mediterranean vegetation.\n\nThe excellent combination of Chiaretto with dishes based on lake fish and extra virgin olive oil (all produced in the Garda area) and the intrinsic beauty of the hills of Lake Garda stimulates beautiful trips on the lake. It is no coincidence that “Italia in Rosa”, the largest Italian event dedicated to rosé wines is right here in the precious setting of the castle of Moniga del Garda. http://www.italiainrosa.it\n\nHUA HIN THAILAND, GOOD WINE IN THE TROPICS???\n\nPosted on October 6, 2017\n\nHUA HIN HILLS VINEYARD PROVES IT’S NOT A JOKE…AND WORTH A VISIT!\n\nby Philip Sinsheimer\n\nPhoto: Cesare Zucca, Philip Sinsheimer\n\nIt’s harvest season and 2017 appears as a challenging vintage in Europe (“a catastrophy” in Italy according to our host Cesare Zucca). Climate has always been a nail-biting stress factor in wine production and the recent warming observations are not helping… Well, not helping everybody! If some predict the growing production of wines in small Northern players such as the UK, Southern European big producers are feeling the heat and are worried. Wine geography has seen many changes with the emergence of “New World” wines of North America, as well as Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa in the Southern hemisphere. But wines of decent quality in tropical countries had never come to my attention… Until the discovery of Mansoon Valley wines in Thailand! During our one month trip in Southeast Asia at the beginning of the year, I had conditioned myself to limited opportunity of interesting wine discoveries. I was ready to enjoy the beers of the various countries visited and an occasional bottle of rather generic imported wine. But, our initial stay in Bangkok at the Centara Grand Central World already gave us a taste of how serious the wine lists were at its various restaurants.\n\nWhen we visited their sister property Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Hua Hin , around 3 hours South of Bangkok in the historic royal beach town of Hua Hin. The Centara Hua Hin is a magnificent venue designed to evoke the spirit of the 1920s. Colonial influences meet modern-day comforts and soothing views are to be had of the swimming pools or the magic gardens, populated by grass elephants and other animals.\n\nThe hotel opened at a time when the new railway line to Malaysia was transforming the sleepy fishing village of Hua Hin into Thailand’s first beach resort.\n\nSensitively extended and renovated, Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Hua Hin retains its air of that bygone age of elegance. I had an even greater surprise during our meal at the elegant, yet relaxed Suan Bua restaurant: a local white wine was offered to go along the traditional Thaï dishes, from shrimp with mango salad to roasted duck in red curry.\n\nI have to say I was skeptical, but all preconceptions disappeared after a few sips of this Mansoon Valley colombard, both crisp and delicate, with exotic fruit and citrus aromas, along with floral notes. Wow! Perfect pairing with the lemongrass used in the dishes and perfectly cooling to counterbalance the heat of the chilies.I was very curious about it all and the adorable staff of the hotel arranged a visit to the vineyard located less than an hour away. The drive was a beautiful occasion to see a bit of the country side with many fields, mainly pineapple plantations. What a surprise to see in the background of one of the most iconic tropical fruit a well manicured vineyard of over 100 hectars. The surprise does not stop there, as I had the opportunity to tour the property on the back of an elephant (if you’ve never done this, just be prepared, it’s a beautiful, but rather rocky ride). The large and elegant tasting room dominates the valley and one can appreciate the key position of the vineyard that benefits from a cooler micro climate with breezes coming from the hills. This is essential to the production of wines that do not taste “cooked”. It’s also the occasion of learning about who is behind this incredible business operation: a man whose name you may not know, but whose fortunate was made by a beverage you definitely have heard about. No, not wine… Red Bull! Chalerm Yoovidhya is among the richest man in Thailand with a fortune approaching 10 billion US dollars according to Forbes this year. Upon returning from his studies abroad where his taste for wine was developed, Chalerm took up the challenge of growing grapes in his native Thailand and show the world that great wines can be crafted even at the 13th latitude of the northern hemisphere. New World wines are old, new latitude wines are in! Hua Hin Vineyards is actually one of three vineyards he owns, but it serves as the flagship of the Mansoon Valley brand. The winemaker is German born Kathrin Puff, who worked in several wineries in Italy and New Zealand before meeting this tropical challenge with brio. I had the chance to sample a few of the large collection of wines available at the vineyard and all showcased a serious winemaking expertise. A brut blanc de blancs, showacses the delicate a floral notes of chenin blanc, colombard and viognier grapes that compose this traditional champenoise method sparkling. Besides the colombard white, I tried the medium sweet chenin blanc, which was not cloying at all and promised a nice pairing with spicy meats dishes and seafood salads. Among the two high-end “Cuvée de Siam” bottles, made with the best grapes of chosen parcels, I was really impressed with the red, made with the oldest vines of shiraz and sangiovese, aged in French oak barrels and bottled unfiltered. The result: a spicy wine combining medium tanin and long finish (which earned 84 points by Robert Parker). The white was a serious wine, but lacked a bit of the freshness so pleasant in the other more simple whites. To finish on a sweet note, the chenin blanc late harvest with a nice balancing acidity invites to be enjoyed along with seared foie gras, aged gorgonzola or a more local mango, sticky rice and coconut dessert.Good tropical wine is a possibility and Hua Hin is the place to go to check it for yourself!\n\nA CLOSER LOOK AT ROMAGNA…UNIQUE WINES WORTH THE TRIP\n\nBy Philip Sinsheimer\n\nPhotos by Philip Sinsheimer, Cesare Zucca\n\nToday, the “vino-Phil” that I am will focus on the unsung grace of the wines of this region, overshadowed by Emilia, its twin sister to the West, which rolls on the fame of products as famous as Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano Reggiano, Aceto Balsamico de Modena, Mortadella di Bologna and, for the wines, Lambrusco\n\nI’m pretty sure you’ve heard of it, as it seems to be exported pretty much everywhere. Quite an achievement for a rather peculiar red wine, both fizzy and often sweet. Clearly, not the best bottles are exported… I still need to sip a Lambrusco that I would actually want to drink.Regardless of quality, Lambrusco has acquired fame. But, can you tell me anything about wines from Romagna? Sorry? I can’t hear you… Well, my guess is: not so much. At least, that was my case before discovering this region with my own eyes and mouth! Before, I knew it only for the famous beach town of Rimini (birthplace of Federico Fellini and of beach umbrellas according to some, and the historic city of Ravenna, which served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire (from 402 to 476). But wines, no, “I was dry”, as we say in French, not a clue as to what to expect…\n\nI didn’t have to wait long to be initiated. As soon as we arrived at the charming Fattoria Faggioli where we were offered a red wine which reflected perfectly the delicious home cooked pasta and the general atmosphere: no fuss, big heart, big flavor, frank and bold (photo). It was a Sangiovese which, I was told right away, was the most prized and celebrated red grape of Romagna. Everyone tends to associate the noble grape with Tuscany, the region immediately to the South, with its world-famous Chianti and Brunello di Montalcino.\n\nEven though Sangiovese has not reached those level of notoriety in Romagna, the region can definitely boast of a deeply rooted wine culture. After a few glasses, an old saying came up, revealing the generosity of the Romagnolo people and their love of wine. If a stranger knocks at the door of someone in Emilia, he is offered a glass of water, in Romagna… a glass of wine!. This sense of hospitality connected to wine culture was perfectly exemplified during our visit of the medieval town of Bertinoro. The symbol of this perched little city is its 13th century column with twelve metal rings, named the “column of hospitality” photo). Each ring was associated to one of the local noble families and when a traveler arrived into town and tied his horse to one of the rings, he would automatically become a guest of the family associated to it We didn’t arrive on horses, but were just as warmly welcomed at the beautiful visitor center with an in-depth presentation of the local wines. This was my first encounter with Romagna’s most celebrated white wine: l’Albana, unique to this region. The 2016 “I Croppi” from Celli winery (photo) revealed a white unlike any other. Golden in color, the wine had a serious body and boasted 14° of alcohol. One of the distinctive tastes I noticed was a lingering ripe apple flavor and it felt like it had some tannins. It is actually sometimes called the red wine made in white and it can pair meat dishes as well, if not better than seafood.\n\nWe tasted a local 100% Sangiovese, bold and rich with 14.5% alcohol, but my second thrill came with the second white wine we tasted: the 2016 San Pascasio, Romagna Pagadebit DOP from the Campodelsole winery. Unlike the Albana, this white had a vivacious acidity and a refreshing minerality. Aromas and flavors of exotic fruits and elderflower were delicious. I was wowed and seduced immediately. Pagadebit is made from the Bombino Bianco grape, which, unlike Albana, is not unique to Romagna. It can be found in central Italy all the way to Puglia, but it has definite terroir characteristics here in Romagna and must count for at least 85% of the grapes for the Pagadebit di Romagna DOC.\n\nThe name is a story in itself. “Paga-debit” – literally “pays your debt” in Italian – comes from the grape’s reputation for being high yielding and a reliable crop for vineyard owners to grow, assuring that each vintage would enable them to pay off their debts. But the latest report regarding the 2017 vintage is rather alarming and almost puts in question the validity of the promising name.\n\nOn the positive side, Albana seems to gain some appeal outside the borders of Romagna. On November 25th and 26th 2017, Bertinoro will host the first Albana Trophy to find the best expert of this wine in order to be its ambassador both nationally and internationally. I wish I could go, perhaps you can, I know you should! The little town will be having many events for the occasion. You just cannot miss having a meal at l’Osteria Cà de Bè with a panoramic view of the surrounding hills and fantastic food (still thinking about this rabbit…). The wine collection is also exceptional (photo du mec?) and I really liked the 2016 Albana “Neblina”, produced by Givana Madonia, which had a very pleasant acidity\n\nAfter my initiation in Bertinoro, I was better armed to appreciate the following tastings of Romagnolo wines. The first one came soon after at the Cantina Poderi dal Nespoli (link? http://www.poderidalnespoli.com/en/), a winery established in 1929 about 16 miles to the South-West of Bertinoro, with a beautiful tasting room and a wide diversity of wines. There was of course various Sangiovese based reds and out of the lot, my favorite was the Prugneto, Romagna DOC, Sangiovese Superiore, made from 100 % Sangiovese grosso: a wine full of life with a bright ruby color, an intense bouquet of ripe red fruit which didn’t translate in the palate into anything jammy, allowing a certain freshness to shine through and soft tannins to carry notes of violet and plum. Yum!\n\nBut, once again, my focus was more on the whites. The Campodora, a 100% Albana showcased the typical golden yellow color of the grape and a rich smooth taste of stone fruit and acacia flowers. But what made it shine for me was this beautiful balance between ripeness and acidity. This freshness, I was told, was to be attributed to vines perched at a higher altitude and a careful picking of the grapes in the morning, before it got too hot. Their Pagadebit (blended with 15% of Sauvignon Blanc) was fresh and vivacious with a floral nose and a crisp finish. Besides those two established whites in Romagna, we had the chance to discover a third one, called Famoso, in reference to the name of the grape which it was made of exclusively. Ironically, this indigenous grape from Romagna has been rediscovered in the last ten years or so after a period of abandonment. Fame comes and goes I guess. And what a flamboyant come back this was in the glass with this 2016 vintage: totally charming white, light, with only 11.5° alcohol, but intense with its floral aromas, notes of tropical fruit, and a long, clean, lip smacking finish. Cesare and I fell in love with this rarity and decided to buy a few bottles to take home and share with others. In spite of its name, Famoso won’t be in the aisle of your supermarket anytime soon! Look for it at your specialty wine store, but better yet, plan a trip to Ravenna.\n\nIf you have the chance to go in the summer during the Festa Artusiana in Forlimpopoli, your will be able to discover the beautiful Casa Artusi (where you can take traditional cooking classes, as well as learn about one of the legends of Italian cookery in the name of Pellegrino Artusi whose monumental La Scienza in Cucina e l’Arte di Mangiar Bene was first printed in 1891 with 700 regional recipes. One stand had me taste an Albana Passito, sweet and intense, beautifully balanced with just enough acidity to make you want to have another sip. This final tasting note still lingers in my mind and the unique wines of Romagna will have me go back again, that is for sure.\n\nTravel articles and hotels reviews by Philip Sinsheimer\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nCHICAGO\n\nLUANG PRABANG\n\nBUDAPEST BANGKOK CASCAIS\n\nThailand, Hua Hin Sheraton Hua Hin Pranburi Villas\n\nby Phlilip Sinsheimer\n\nPhoto:Cesare Zucca\n\nThailand, Hua Hin Sheraton Hua Hin Pranburi Villas\n\nby Phlilip Sinsheimer\n\nPhoto:Cesare Zucca\n\nThailand.\n\nAfter a few days in Hua Hin city,\n\nI checked in for 2 nights at the Sheraton Hua Hin Pranburi Villas about 30 minute drive south in a super quiet locality called Pranburi.

Let’s go!\n\nYou will discover medieval towers, canals, villas and palaces, romantic corners surrounded by greenery and the picturesque views that Bruges offers to the visitor.\n\nThis city, thanks to its favorable position and the connection with the sea became since the Middle Ages. an important and enterprising commercial point and port center of north-western Europe. Many wealthy European traders moved to Bruges where the first stock exchange was born, whose activities took place on the square in front of the Van der Beurze family inn and whose handbags are still immortalized on the portal of the palace.\n\nThe golden century began for Bruges, led by the Dukes of Burgundy who expanded their residence here, transforming the city into a lively economic and cultural crossroads. Famous painters such as Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling, great Flemish primitive masters, found in Bruges the ideal place for their artistic activities.\n\nThe year 1482 marked the sad decline of the city, relations between merchants and Maximilian of Burgundy plummeted, as did the connections of Bruges with the sea. The court, foreign merchants, authorities and artists left the city, in short, the VIPs of the time all left, except … the swans that have always been present in Bruges, a symbol of freedom and still highly photographed protagonists ..\n\nThe great revival took place in 1892 when the extraordinary heritage of the city was rediscovered. Thanks to its intimate and mysterious beauty, Bruges began to be regarded as one of the most interesting tourist destinations in the world\n\nHow to get around Bruges\n\nIn Bruges it is wonderful to wander aimlessly in the winding streets to discover its medieval face and its most hidden corners, perhaps relying on a guide, on foot or by bicycle, or by rickshaw, a unique and ecological means of transport.The canals of Bruges are the arteries of the city. Do not miss a boat or boat tour along the canals, from which you can see the city from a different point of view and discover hidden corners and secret gardens. Boarding takes place at one of the five piers in the heart of the city and the tour takes about half an hour.The more adventurous can experience the thrill of a flight in one of the Bruges Ballooning balloons which organizes morning and evening tours in the skies above the city, the excursion lasts three hours, at least one in the air.\n\nAre you romantic?\n\nAn evocative carriage ride awaits you where you will enjoy all the picturesque beauty of Bruges, through centuries-old squares and fabulous canal bridges, while the coachman will offer you expert explanations and will make a short stop at the famous (and unmissable) Begijnhof, a structure with white walls, once home to a commune of ‘beguines’, emancipated lay women who led a chaste and pure life in a true oasis of religious peace, characterized by the imposing internal courtyard, the trees with tangled roots and wonderful seasonal flowers. Not far away, Lake Minnewater awaits you, surrounded by a beautiful park and crossed by a suggestive bridge from 1720 that offers a spectacular view of the towers and pointed roofs of Bruges.\n\nTO BE SEEN\n\nGrote Markt or Market Square, was the commercial center of Bruges in medieval times and lively nest of the city, dominated by the Belfort, Civic Tower on which you can climb 83 steps to enjoy a breathtaking view. It is not possible to book, so expect a bit of a wait, but I assure you, it’s worth it\n\nBurg beating heart of the city. For over 600 years, the square’s majestic architecture has also included the Landhuis, home of the Bruges Legion of Freedom. This square was the administrative and religious heart of Bruges and, although nothing remains of the two buildings, the beautiful historic buildings that surround it bear witness to this. First of all, the 14th-century Gothic Town Hall Stadhuis, one of the oldest in the Netherlands, with spiers, turrets and a beautifully decorated, window-studded facade.\n\nBasilica of the Holy Blood of Bruges which, in a precious crystal bottle, houses a fragment of the fabric used by Joseph of Arimathea to dry the blood of Christ after the crucifixion.\n\nChurch of Our Lady, built in the Brabantine Gothic style between the 13th and 15th centuries, the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk is a splendid example of the skill and expertise of local artisans.Inside you will find a real jewel, Michelangelo’s Madonna of Bruges , Carrara marble sculpture of extraordinary beauty It was purchased in 1506 by the Mouscron family, rich merchants of Bruges fabrics, to adorn the family tomb and is the only work of Michelangelo to have left Italy while the great artist was still in life.\n\nSide by side are wonderful museums: the Gruuthuse, a sumptuous 15th-century palace inhabited by a merchant who collected the tax on “Gruut”, a mixture of herbs that was added to barley in the brewing process. The Museum, through 22 rooms, tells 500 years of Bruges history with collections ranging from tapestries to furniture, from objects in precious metals to ceramics, from weapons to musical instruments and the suggestive private chapel that overlooks the nave of the Church of Our Lady. Allowing nobles to attend religious services without being seen by the people.\n\nGroening Museum rich collection of works of art from the 15th to the 20th century, mainly focused on the artists who lived and worked in Bruges. A magnificent collection of paintings by the so-called Flemish Primitives forms the core of the permanent exhibition and is one of the best collections of medieval art in Europe. In fact, the Museum boasts some masterpieces by Hans Memling, Gerard David and Jan Van Eyck, considered the initiator of the Flemish school and the famous portrait of his wife “Margareta, with a rather severe expression, it is rumored that in the house… she was the boss…\n\nFlemish cuisine\n\nBelgium, as we know, is famous for its ‘frites’ french fries often accompanied by ‘Mariniere’ or ‘au vin blanc’ mussels. Excellent street food, you can find them everywhere, in very generous portions, strictly fresh and cut on the same day, with a huge choice of sauces, from mayonnaise, the most traditional, to ketchup, tartare, or a thousand other unexpected versions.\n\nThe ‘frites’ are a true institution, so much so that the city honors them with a museum in the splendid Saalhalle palace, the Frietmuseum, tells the story of the potato, the ‘frites’ and sauces, all, of course, with a final tasting! Madame Adi, my kind guide, recommended Casa Patata, where I allowed myself a tasty break, really good!.\n\nWhat to eat in Bruges\n\nFlemish gastronomy is a successful mix of French and Belgian dishes. Among the seafood products stand out ‘gray’ prawns (crevettes gris), eels, moules-frites (mussels with fries, I recommend, keep an eye on the season) Among the meats: mixed boiled meat (hochebot), pork mijotè , carbonade (bovine), the famous Brussels sprout, white asparagus (in season), chocolate and more than 1000 types of beer!\n\nWhere I had dinner\n\nGoesepitte43, alternative but not too much, innovative at the right point, the Belgian cuisine happily present and excellently reworked by chef Jan Supply who has renamed his ‘bistronomy’ place between bistro, brasserie and gastronomic restaurant. Meat, fish and poultry and great attention to vegetable side dishes that can be chosen by the customer. Many dishes are cooked with Mibrasa, a charcoal oven that enhances the natural aromas of the ingredients and releases a unique range of pure flavors.\n\nI tasted the famous white asparagus ‘Spitsbroek’ feuilleté, tender and juicy served with a delicious mousseline sauce and I cannot fail to mention the amazing dessert, an apple crepe with a touch of vanilla ice cream …\n\nHere the original “crêpe normande”. recipe\n\nThe apple tart is a pancake with apple slices called a “crêpe normande”. The recipe for 12 pancakes is:\n\n4 eggs\n\n200g of flour\n\n60g of melted butterthe\n\n0,5l milk\n\n4 apples, peeled and thinly sliced (use a mandoline if you have one)\n\nTo caramelize : 200g Sugar + 200 butter\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 Whisk all ingredients apart from the butter and apples with half the milk to combine, and then whisk in the rest of the milk to make a batter. Resist the temptation to use a blender as it will over-activate the gluten in the flour and stop the batter from running properly in the pan. Set aside for a while.\n\n2 Very lightly cook the apple slices in a pan with a little butter, just to soften them. Set aside.\n\n3 Heat the butter in a crêpe pan until foaming. Add a ladle of batter and spread out either by moving the pan or using a wooden spreader. Quickly add some apple slices in a nice pattern, and spread over a little more of the batter. Cook for few moments until browning, and then turn the pancake over in the pan to cook the other side. With crêpes Normande, this takes practice because the apples reduce the cohesively of the crêpe. If you can do a full flip, then this is a good skill to acquire. Don’t worry if you mess it up – hide the error with a fold.\n\n4 Fold onto a plate once cooked and serve with ice cream or Chantilly cream.\n\nINFO\n\nVisit Flanders\n\nVisit Bruges\n\n#VisitBruges\n\n#imagineBruges\n\nFacebook: @VisitBruges\n\nTwitter: @Visit_Bruges\n\nInstagram: @visitbruges\n\nNOTRE DAME ENCHANTS MILAN\n\nA new notable work brings back on stage the talented cast del BALLETTO DI MILANO Notre-Dame de Paris which, after the international successes of 2023, returns to important Italian stages including the TEATRO LIRICO GIORIO GABER DI MILANO, also the artistic residence of the Company, where it will be on stage on March 26th.\n\nSigned by the French choreographer Stephen Delattre, the ballet is inspired by the famous novel by Victor Hugo which, in Paris in 1482, has as its protagonist Quasimodo, the hunchbacked bell ringer of the Cathedral, hopelessly in love with the gypsy Esmeralda. Respectful of history, Delattre has created a dynamic, brilliant and pathos-filled choreography which finds exceptional interpreters in the dancers of the Milan Ballet. Mattia Imperatore proves himself to be an extraordinary artist by portraying a touching and highly emotional Quasimodo. He is contrasted by Alberto Viggiano’s tormented Claude Frollo. Alessandro Orlando is the charming captain Phoebus, while the charismatic Gioia Pierini is Esmeralda.\n\nThe score was created by Davidson Jaconello who was able to combine pieces by composers such as Ravel, Rossini, Verdi, Minkus and others with great musical competence.\n\nAlso of great impact are the scenographic video projections by René Zensen, in which the famous Parisian Cathedral dominates and the costumes created by Federico Veratti.\n\nTeatro Lirico Giorgio Gaber – Milano\n\nIVia Larga, 14, 20122 Milano\n\ninfo@teatroliricogiorgiogaber.it\n\nTickets from 30 euros on sale at the Theater box office and online\n\nwww.teatroliricogiorgiogaber.it\n\n.\n\nLUXURY HOTELS IN THE WORLD —- Visited, photographed, experimented, reviewed by Cesare Zucca\n\nSEE FULL ARTICLE ( english)\n\nSEE FULL ARTICLE\n\nThis block contains unexpected or invalid content.\n\nAttempt Block Recovery\n\nPost\n\n“CIBOVAGARE ” : TRAVEL, FOOD AND HAPPINESS….\n\nParte la prima edizione di Cibovagare, l’evento dei prodotti artigianali sostenibili che si terrà dal 16 al 18 marzo 2024 in una vecchia filanda, genius loci dell’artigianalità, trasformata nel polo fieristico Fiere di Santa Lucia di Piave (TV). che ogni anno propone ricette che sono il frutto di anni di sperimentazioni in cucina da parte di chef locali, cultori della carne di rana, come la “Rana imperiale”, al forno con guazzetto di pomodoro e polentina, o il risotto alla polpa di rana e i tortelli di rana conditi con burro e salvia,le deliziose brioche e mille altre specialità di Santa Lucia del Piave e dintorni ,\n\nCibovagare, sarà una kermesse che si svilupperà su tre giornate, con un calendario ricco di esperienze, talk e degustazioni per immergersi in una selezione dei migliori produttori italiani che hanno fatto dell’artigianalità e della sostenibilità, nel variegato mondo del food and drink, il loro credo.\n\n“Ne abbiamo conosciuti tanti, cibovagando per l’Italia nei nostri tour gastronomici” commentano Francesca Palenzona, Amministratore Delegato di Idea Plus, la società organizzatrice, e Cristina Rombolà, coordinatrice del portale Cibovagare®. “Ed è per rendere accessibile a tutti queste meraviglie, anche a chi non ha sempre la possibilità di viaggiare alla scoperta del più autentico Made in Italy, che abbiamo pensato di raccogliere in un unico momentum una selezione delle eccellenze e delle storie dei loro artefici.”.\n\nNobile l’obiettivo degli organizzatori: annullare le distanze tra chi produce, chi distribuisce e chi consuma, creando un incontro dal vivo fatto di assaggio, di ascolto di storie appassionanti e di cultura del mangiare e del cucinare bene e di qualità.\n\nLa manifestazione sarà arricchita da talk, che si susseguiranno nelle tre giornate e dalla visita agli espositori, attivi in tutta la filiera e provenienti da tante regioni italiane: dalle farine venete di Molino Rachello, main partner dell’evento e oggi alla sesta generazione, nate in un parco naturale sulle sponde del fiume Sile, 100% biologiche, italiane e tracciabili con il progetto Oasi, che coinvolge oltre 30 aziende nazionali; ai prosciutti di Langhirano dei Fratelli Pelizziari, azienda a conduzione familiare,\n\nnata nel 1974 dal sogno di zio Enio di produrre prosciutto di ottima qualità; a Gelmini, azienda agricola della Val di Gresta, con la sua filiera di ortaggi coltivati in biologico, raccolti a mano e poi trasformati artigianalmente, con lo scopo di preservare la biodiversità del territorio e investire sulla sostenibilità economica e ambientale; Un’area food consentirà di prolungare la permanenza nella fiera: oltre agli assaggi e agli acquisti nel mercato degli artigiani del gusto, ci sarà la possibilità di mangiare in loco piatti e street food somministrati da alcuni espositori e ristoratori.\n\nPer scoprire il programma e acquistare i biglietti in prevendita:\n\nhttps://www.cibovagare.it/evento\n\nCESARE ZUCCA Travel, food & lifestyle.

CHEF PHIL HOWARD\n\nIn the heart of super trendy Chelsea, a stone’s throw from the fashionable Kings Road, I discovered a restaurant that marries tradition, innovation and creativity with a simple and confident attitude. It is Elystan Street, at the helm of which we find Phil Howard, highly respected figure in the industry with a multitude of awards to his name and without doubt a true chef’s chef. Phil has always cooked with harmony of flavour being his absolute mantra – and this being achieved through classical flavours and rigorously seasonal and ingredient-led cooking. None of this has changed at Elystan Street but an increased focus on vegetables and a lightness of touch now prevails. With over 30 years of experience in running some of London’s finest and most respected neighbourhood restaurants Rebecca Mascarenhas brings her immense experience and passion to Elystan Street. As a pro restaurant goer she has not only amassed a hard-earned diner’s opinion but a perspective to help ensure that her own businesses never rest on their laurels.\n\nPhil is one of Britain’s most acclaimed chefs. He currently holds one Michelin star at his Chelsea restaurant Elystan Street and previously held two at The Square in Mayfair.\n\nHe is also about to open in Covent Garden his second restaurant with an Italian menu, the Pasta Bar Notto, featuring italian inspired dishes such as burrata with black cabbage and anchovy, garlic & orange dressing, veal with tuna sauce, gnocchetti with smashed sausage, white wine, fennel & chilli, pumpkin & chestnut ravioli with pine nuts, brown butter, sage & parmesan, just to name few. Phil’s prerogative is using 100% classic flavors, which doesn’t mean not being creative, but invites freshness, therefore tradition without being too heavy.I met Phil at Elystan Street\n\nHi Phil, your first memory in the kitchen?\n\nThe slightly toasted scent of the lake fish that I had just caught and which was cooked by my parents on their farm. It was simple cuisine, basic dishes, everything always very fresh.\n\nDo you enjoy cooking fish?\n\nI love fish dishes, England is surrounded by seas, I think that here you can find some of the best fish in the world and I assure you… I have traveled (and enjoyed) a lot, I have just returned from Tokyo and Kyoto and I love traveling in Africa.\n\nMine is a job in which pleasure is important, and I think that Italian cuisine is its spokesperson. I have been cooking for 35 years and there has always been a pasta dish on my menuDo you cook at home?\n\nYes, simple dishes: fish, meat and then my wife Jennie is a fantastic cook. I also like to browse other restaurants, although I tend to always return to my favourites.\n\nFor example?\n\nRiva, an Italian restaurant on Church Rd, in business for many years. I find them to offer the best cotoletta alla milanese.\n\nPassionate about Italian cuisine?\n\nMine is a job where the key word is “pleasure”. I think Italian cuisine is its spokesperson. I have been cooking for 35 years and a pasta dish has always appeared on my menu, often combined with local excellences, such as my Orkney scallop ravioli, a type of crustacean that is harvested by hand in the pristine waters of the Orkney Islands in Scotland.\n\nOne of your favorite dishes?\n\nCashew hummus, a dish that has evolved over the years.\n\nCashew nut hummus with roasted vegetables, a light curry dressing, nut milk and lime\n\nINFO\n\nhttps://www.elystanstreet.com/\n\nhttps://www.nottopastabar.com/\n\nCESARE ZUCCA Travel, food & lifestyle.\n\nMilanese by birth, Cesare lives between New York, Milan and the rest of the world.

What better choice than the Euganean Hills and the village of Arquà, where he lived the last years of his life with his family. He fall in love with this land, considered the green and literary heart of the Veneto, where physical places and places of the soul coincide to this once marshy territory that the poet dedicates some words in one of his letters, remembered in one of the literary plaques of the route of the via poetica of the Petrarca Park “Since in no other way can you so adorn the appearance of a beautiful region and thus restore the Euganean Hills besieged by these marshes, widely known and noble for the branches of Minerva and the very fruitful branch of an illustrious Bacchus, to their true appearance of excellent land, and indeed restore fertile fields to Ceres, which is excluded from it , who are now oppressed by a foul and excessive mood”Thanks to him that many writers and poets were attracted to this territory which then impressed them so much that it became the setting for many of their works, from Byron to Andrea Zanzotto, Mary and Percy Shelley, d’Annunzio and many others who were inspired by the enchantment of these rolling hills.\n\nSo, let’s start your journey from Arquà Petrarca, which preserves its fourteenth-century medieval appearance, the tomb, the Oratory where he retreated to pray and his house, now a museum.\n\nAt the ” That house in Arquà” you will discover the garden where he cultivated vegetables and aromatic herbs that we find in the garden and which will be used to create a themed menu, such as bay leaves, dill, basil, chives, fennel, lavender, lovage, marjoram, lemon balm, mint, oregano, parsley , rosemary, savory, celery, thyme, mallow.\n\nPay a visit to the Evo del Borgo oil mill, which among the many oils could not miss the laurel oil, a plant loved by the poet, a symbol of fame and celebrity, then the Loreggian Winery that aims to enhance the cultural context also in wine, given that the main wine labels feature phrases from the poet.\n\nIn the past, many arrived near the village of Arquà Petrarca by boat, using a dense network of navigable canals, including the Battaglia Canal, an important artificial water road built between the 11th and 12th centuries. You can experiment the amazing the thrill of navigating on a real “gondola”, just like I did, beginning my emotional gondola cruise after paying a visit to the Museo Navigazione Fluviale, in Battagia Terme, This journey is enriched by an artifact from 1923, a navigation basin which is among the largest in Europe and which allows a drop of water of 7 meters . You will pass through the river village for an interesting perspective that could only be from the water, for this village which owes its fame to it. Water which was important for the activity of the Baths, whose history we will tell and then for the commercial activity of the boatmen, who managed tons of goods transported on the typical “burci” which are still on display in the widespread museum\n\nThe Praglia Abbey\n\nA national monument, still inhabited by monks today, owes its existence to great writer Antonio Fogazzaro who collaborated in the reopening of the monastery after its closure in 1868, which only occurred in 1903, Don’t miss the monumental library featuring a collection of books donated by the writer familyMuseum of the Euganean Hills, Galzignano Terme:\n\nSymbol of the love of the inhabitants of the neibourgh villages. It is in fact the result of a series of donations which over the years have been enhanced by some projects concerning social inclusion, the removal of architectural barriers, the telling of the history of the territory and which is constantly work in progress, thanks also to the study and research of many young scholarship holders and trainees from the nearby University of Padua.Valbona Castle\n\nThanks to his owner this manor reopened it after years of neglect. Today it presents itself as an original, perfect small venue with multiple possibilities for visits and food and wine experiences https://www.castellodivalbona.eu/_it/ For a light dinner.stop at the internal restaurant https://www.tavernatreleoni.it/\n\nWhere to eat\n\nAntica Trattoria Ballotta\n\nLegendary restaurant serving traditional local food, including the one and only “torresano”, an antique dish once reserved for the tables of the nobles who raised it in the dovecotes placed on the towers. The Torresano made on the spit was traditionally consumed during summe, when the young and tender wild pigeons had reached adult size weighing around 500-600 grams. A delicacy!!!Where to sleep\n\nVilla del Poeta cosy hotel with the restaurant “The Canzoniere”Borgo Buzzaccarini\n\nTHANKS\n\nArcadia Arte, which is part of a temporary association of companies, made up of 20 economic operators who supported a destination project TERME E COLLI EUGANEI: THE LAND OF HEALTH AND EMOTION, financed with the POC of the Region Veneto –\n\nOGD Terme and Colli Euganei area, welcomes tourists with an integrated and coordinated slow-type experiential proposal, capable of embracing the different souls of the destination and enhance them both at a national and international level on themes such as Art & Culture.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nClaudia Baldin, my brilliant guide for this unforgettable adventure.\n\nMANGIARE SANO, EATING HEALTHY\n\nCome cucinare GUSTOSO e SANO ?\n\nNessuno meglio della Dottoressa Samantha di Geso del Centro DnA Milano , biologo nutrizionista ed esperta di alimentazione poteva rispondermi.\n\nDottoressa, come si è avvicinata al mondo della pasta di legumi?\n\nDevo esseres sincera: da biologa ho inizialmente pensato che fosse arrivato l’ennesimo prodotto chimico e industriale, invenzione new-age e fregatura per la salute.\n\nHo approfondito andando anche a fondo sui processi di lavorazione e mi sono dovuta ricredere, scoprendo che con la pasta di legume si possono, addirittura, evitare tossicità dei legumi non cotti in maniera buona e opportuna.\n\nI legumi fanno parte della storica cucina italiana?\n\nCerto, I nostri antenati avevano un’alimentazione che utilizzava i legumi ma, con amore e cura, li mettevano a bagno 24-48 ore, dopodichè li cucinavano con alloro. impiegando tempi giustamente lunghi e temperature corrette. Ho fatto ricerche sui processi di lavorazione e ho scoperto che, grazie questo tipo si può evitare la pericolosa tossicità dei legumi non cotti in maniera opportuna.\n\nQuali sono i vantaggi della pasta di legumi?\n\nLa pasta di legumi evita il gonfiore di pancia frutto delle difficoltà di digerire le pareti del legume, senza però perdere i nutrimenti in essa contenuti. Si presta, a parità di calorie (circa 350 calorie per 100 grammi di pasta) e alto contenuto di proteine e fibre, a essere benissimo un sostituito di un pasto completo. Inoltre piace molto anche ai nostri bifidobatteri, che detengono lo scettro delle nostre difese immunitarie.\n\nE’ vero che in una dieta dimagrante si può mangiare la pasta, se è di legumi?\n\nCerto e non solo: Il suo basso indice glicemico e il suo alto contenuto di fibre sono “oro” per l’intestino di tutti e, soprattutto di chi ha problemi intestinali, glicemici o semplicemente per un controllo del peso. Il suo potere saziante dà la possibilità di diminuire le quantità e le calorie introdotte, quindi si presta bene a coloro che vogliono perdere peso senza rinunciare ad un buon piatto di pasta.\n\nE’ una pasta saporita?\n\nIl gusto ovviamente è quello dei legumi per cui le ricette semplici aiutano a gustare meglio questa pasta, specialmente quelle che la accoppiano a pesce fresco, pescato in giornata e a verdure di stagione. Provatela con il filetto di tonno tagliato a cubetti e cotto leggermente in padella con olio, capperi e olive, una delizia estiva!\n\nPaladina delle paste ai legumi è Felicia, l’unico pastificio italiano allergen free con molino multigrain integrato, usando materie prime biologiche e naturalmente senza glutine, come il grano saraceno, il riso integrale e l’avena.\n\nÈ totalmente naturale è ipocalorica, molto proteica e fatta solo di acqua e farina di legumi e offre un’infinità di formati: spaghetti, penne e mezze penne, ditalini , fusilli. risoni ai legumi e cereali, tra cui lenticchie rosse e gialle, ceci, piselli, fagioli verdi Mung.\n\nLa cosa interessante di questo prodotto, oltre al conteggio delle calorie, è il tempo di cottura, di molto inferiore rispetto a quello di una pasta di grano duro classica.\n\nPronti per la vostra avventura surfcasting?\n\nIl mio augurio è “buon appetito e buona salute a tavola”!\n\nenglish version\n\nDr.Samantha di Geso of DnA Milano , nutritionist biologist and food expert could answer me.\n\nDoctor, how did you approach the world of legume pasta?\n\nI have to be honest: as a biologist I initially thought that yet another chemical and industrial product had arrived, a new-age invention and a rip-off for health.\n\nI also went deeper into the manufacturing processes and I had to change my mind, discovering that with legume paste you can even avoid the toxicity of uncooked legumes in a good and appropriate way.\n\nAre legumes part of historic Italian cuisine?\n\nSure, our ancestors had a diet that used legumes but, with love and care, they soaked them for 24-48 hours, then cooked them with laurel. using appropriately long times and correct temperatures. I did research on manufacturing processes and I discovered that, thanks to this type, the dangerous toxicity of uncooked legumes can be avoided.\n\nWhat are the benefits of legume pasta?\n\nThe legume paste avoids belly swelling resulting from the difficulty of digesting the walls of the legume, without however losing the nutrients it contains. With the same calories (about 350 calories per 100 grams of pasta) and high protein and fiber content, it lends itself to being a perfect substitute for a complete meal. Furthermore, our bifidobacteria also like it very much, which hold the scepter of our immune defenses.Is it true that in a slimming diet you can eat pasta, if it is made with legumes?\n\nCertainly and not only: its low glycemic index and its high fiber content are “gold” for everyone’s intestines and, above all, for those with intestinal or glycemic problems or simply for weight control. Its satiating power makes it possible to reduce the quantities and calories introduced, therefore it lends itself well to those who want to lose weight without giving up a good plate of pasta.\n\nIs it a tasty pasta?\n\nThe taste is obviously that of legumes, so simple recipes help you enjoy this pasta better, especially those that pair it with fresh fish, caught on the day and seasonal vegetables. Try it with tuna fillet cut into cubes and lightly cooked in a pan with oil, capers and olives, a summer delight!\n\nFelicia’s red lentil fusilli, served in a legume and sea bass broth\n\nThe champion of legume pasta is Felicia, the only allergen-free Italian pasta factory with an integrated multigrain mill, using organic and naturally gluten-free raw materials, such as buckwheat, brown rice and oats.\n\nIt is totally natural, low-calorie, high in protein and made only of water and legume flour and offers an infinite number of formats: spaghetti, penne and mezze penne, ditalini, fusilli. risoni with legumes and cereals, including red and yellow lentils, chickpeas, peas, mung green beans.\n\nThe interesting thing about this product, in addition to the calorie count, is the cooking time, which is much less than that of a classic durum wheat pasta.\n\nReady for your surfcasting adventure?\n\n“Buon appetito & and good health at the table”!\n\nCESARE ZUCCA Travel, food & lifestyle.\n\nMilanese by birth, Cesare lives between New York, Milan and the rest of the world.

The Frantoio variety gives an intense green color with faint yellow notes, medium-strong intensity, elegance and broad vegetal tones that refer to thistle and artichoke on an almond base; the Moraiolo, rustic and imposing, makes the oil intensely fruity, decidedly bitter and spicy with hints of leaves and fine woody notes, the Leccino gives the aroma of ripe olives and vegetable aromas, and a slight bitter and spicy sensation.\n\nOrgolio della Poderina is a product of the highest quality, elegant, with a marked scent of freshly mown grass and a strong character like its balanced spicy and bitter aroma.\n\nThe result is an extra virgin olive oil naturally rich in polyphenols that give a magnificent aroma to any pairing, from freshly picked garden salads to the highest gastronomy dishes.\n\n.RAVELLO BY FRANTOIO D’ORAZIO\n\nhttps://www.frantoiodorazio.it/\n\nThis “Oro verde “oil was born in a corner of Puglia (Apulia) where scents and flavors cloak the landscape dotted with monumental olive trees with atmosphere. The Apulian oil is as intense as the ancient peasant culture that the Frantoio D’Orazio has always preserved and exalted, to give every palate taste and beauty, with every taste. The Ravello boasts shades of blue and green that follow each other without interruption, like the rows of centuries-old olive trees on the rolling hills of Puglia, between small lakes and sinkholes of karst origin. All of Frantoio D’Orazio’s love for his land is revived in this bottle. Love that is also reflected in the processing of extra virgin olive oil, which still takes place with the same care and attention as in the past.\n\nLeaf green color tending towards golden yellow. We are dealing with a light oil, with hints of grass and leaves. On the palate it is slightly bitter and spicy, balanced, with notes of leaves and vegetables. A perfect harmony between the local olive varieties Olivastro, Cima di Mola, Leccino, Coratina, Cima di Melfi, Picholine, Simona and Nociara. Thus was born the extra virgin olive oil of Frantoio D’Orazio, with a light fruity taste, enhanced by notes of leaves and grass.\n\nPairings: thisi s a light and fruity oil, ideal condiment to enhance a dish without distorting or covering the flavours. We recommend it for fresh salads, vegetable purées, rice soups and savory soups, dishes based on beans, artichokes, asparagus, cooked vegetables, with white meats, bruschetta, salsa, mixed legumes, baked tomatoes, truffle sauce.\n\nMIMI\n\nhttps://www.oliomimi.com/en/\n\nThe Peranzana di Mimì extra virgin olive oil was born from the passion of Donato and Michele and their mother Giuditta who fulfilled the dream of their father Domenico also known as Mimì. Their olive grove is spread over 80 hectares where they cultivate 24,000 olive trees with dedication, which produce about 500 hectoliters of oil every year.\n\nPeranzana di Mimì extra virgin olive oil is a medium intensity fruity oil with many vegetable and herbaceous scents on the nose, with a marked note of tomato and green apple. When I tasted, the freshness of the apple and green tomato reappeared and showed a spicy and bitter character while maintaining an elegant harmony between the two components. Ideal for pairing with raw dishes as a condiment for salads or vegetables but also for seasoning grilled meats and fish or soups. Perfect raw condiment on grilled dishes, salads or soups.\n\nTESTE DI MORO Dop Monte ETNA\n\nby Romano\n\nhttps://www.romanovincenzo.com/en/teste-di-moro-line/\n\nThe legend of the “Moro” (Arabic) head dates back to the 11th century, when the Mori’s invaded Sicily and became part of the population, so much so that it blended perfectly with the Sicilian population.

Bled, about an hour North of the capital Ljubljana to the North-West of Slovenia. Rather than the town it is the beautiful lake that gives the name Bled, famous among the European elite as early as the 1930’s with the construction of a luxurious hotel providing natural hot spring source knowned for health benefits.I am talking of the Grand Hotel Toplice, a venue that boasts a rich history, a magical location, gorgeous alpine and lake views and sumptuously comfortable, elegantly styled rooms. Each of the rooms and suites at Grand Hotel Toplice has its own unique character and are traditionally styled with beautiful parquet floors, rich furniture and beautiful paintings with many of the rooms benefiting from breathtakingly beautiful lake views. The hotel has been recently renovated and restored to its former glory and is one of the best hotels in Slovenia as well as being a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World collection. It has hosted many eminent guests and is frequented by celebrities such as Vivian Leigh, Arthur Miller, Pablo Neruda, King Hussein of Jordan, Paul McCartney and…me, with my best friend-chef-writer Philip Sinsheimer, graciously hosted by Sava hotel and resort group that manage the venue. Starting from the impeccable reception. the hotel boasts luxurious accommodation, few restaurant, a bar and the enchantment of Lake Bled. All rooms and suites are individually decorated in an enchanting and traditional style, lavishly equipped with an excellent range of facilities, a relaxing thermal swimming pool and benefit from different saunas, wellness services and a solarium among a private lido, where Philip (expert swimmer) dived in the limpid lake water while me (lazy man…) was indulging in a relaxing sunbathing. We dedicated the morning ( when the light is best) to row to the island where the minuscule baroque chapel.I was anxious to hear the bells rings, because I knew about the legend wich narrates that around the year 1500, the leaseholder of Lake Bled at the time, Hartman Kreigh, disappeared. People said he was killed. Sad for the events, the Lady of the Castle collected all of her precious golden jewellery to be melted down and casted into a bell for the chapel on the island of the Lake, so that the bell would toll in remembrance of beloved companion. They say the bell has a magic power, when it rings, you should make 3 wishes and wait for them to become real. We did 99 steps and finally we arrived at the church, where the view is really breathtaking and, yes, we waited for the bell… Not sure my wishes are becoming a reality, we ll see…. A true wish coming true was the splendid dinner we were invited for dinner at Julijana Restaurant where Chef Bertoncelj prepared a great dinner.\n\nI leave Philip the privilege of writing about it, since he is a chef and a food blogger. GRANDE CUISINE BY THE LAKE\n\nThis historic landmark now called the Grand Hotel Toplice, operated by the Sava hotel and resort group, has managed to preserve the relics of the past with grand salons adorned with memorabilia pictures and bring all the comfort of modernity at the same time.This delicate balance between past was brilliantly reflected in the cuisine of the executive chef Simon Bertoncelj and the whole crew under him. Having dinner at the gastronomic Julijana Restaurant, especially if the weather allows to eat al fresco facing the lake is a moment of bliss: the quality of service, attention to detail and classic decor evoke a certain respect of classical elegance. This doesn’t constrain the cuisine to old classics, and the chef’s creativity and modern techniques seem to find their place very naturally in this elegant environment. The mise en bouche consisting of a delicately baked oyster and a buttery giant shrimp had all the signs of what you can expect in a palace restaurant: prime quality ingredients simply treated. This seafood opening was in synch with the view of the water even though it wasn’t the sea. As I were to learn later by the chef, unfortunately, as beautiful as it is, the lake doesn’t often yield the quantity of fish needed to take place on the menu. The mushroom cappuccino with porcini had the depth of flavor one can only get in top notch restaurants, served piping hot but adorned with the freshness of a few micro greens scattered on top rather than the old habit of a dollop of cream and a few chives. Fresh too was the vitello tonnato inspired salad, bright and lively. Here, as in all the great restaurants experienced in Slovenia, the wine list paid homage to the country’s fine wines, such as the 2017Verus Chardonnay from Stajerska, the western part of the Podravje region in the North of the country. At last a chardonnay that can showcase both concentration of flavors and freshness in the palate with a mere 13° alcohol content.The shining fish course was a thick and moist turbot filet, perfectly cooked and adorned by a beautiful composition of vegetables and foamy grapefruit sauce. Here again: classic base and modern composition. Though generous, nothing was heavy, and the beautiful matured saddle of veal served pink with a herb crust was still welcome. To finish, the iconic Bled Cream Cake, which recipe goes back to 1953 and is secretly kept by the Sava hotels group. The result was up to the legend. Even though I really do not have much of a sweet tooth, and I have had my share of mille-feuilles in France, this raised version of the classic with just two layers of perfectly crisp puffed pastry holding a firm custard covered by a layer of lighter whipped cream is to die for… Chef Simon Bertoncelj, who has worked under the commands of Gordon Ramsey, seems rather poised and discreet, but if you really want to find out, he opens his kitchen to a guest table of 2 to 6 people for a 7-course menu cooked and served, right before their eyes…and ears!
