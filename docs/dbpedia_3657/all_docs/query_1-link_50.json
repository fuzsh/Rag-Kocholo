Their -- \"a riddle, what is pure- ly arisen\" --, their memory of floating H ö lderlintowers, gull- enswirled. Visits of drowned joiners to these plunging words: Came, if there came a man, came a man to the world, today, with the patriarchs' light-beard: he could, if he spoke of this time, he could only babble and babble, ever- ever- moremore. (\"Pallaksch. Pallaksch.\")* * Pallaksch A word that H ö lderlin, spending his last years in the home of a T ü bingen carpenter, was given to uttering in his dementia; it could signify Yes or No. [Poem Translated by John Felstiner; the explanation of Pallaksch is also from his \"Notes\" in Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan ]\n\nKafka and Rilke\n\nKafka remarking (in a letter) on Rilke's words re Kafka's work: Incidentally, back in Prague I remembered Rilke's words. After some extremely kind remarks about \"The Stoker,\" he went on to say that neither Metamorphosis nor \"In the Penal Colony\" had achieved the same effect. This observation may not be easy to understand, but it is discerning. The footnote on this passage reads (in part): Rilke and Kafka probably never met personally. Kafka may have heard of Rilke's opinion about his works through Eugen Mondt. Since \"In the Penal Colony\" was not printed at the time, Rilke, who then lived in Munich, must have seen the manuscript which had arrived in Munich on September 30 and discussed it with Eugen Mondt.... Rilke followed Kafka's work with great interest; in a letter to Kurt Wolff of February 17, 1922, he says, \"Please put me down especially for anything that appears by Franz Kafka. I am, I might assure you, not his\n\nHitchcock's Soda City\n\nI was watching Saboteur last night (Encore has a slew of Hitchcock's films up now) and wanted to know more about Soda City. Figured it wasn't real. It's not. Apparently it was shot somewhere in Nevada (makes sense). This site gives a nice run-down of the various places throughout the US that Hitchcock used in his films: Hitchcock's America."
