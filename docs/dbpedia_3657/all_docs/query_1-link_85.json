        "text": "4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nJealous Rage Vandalism? -Plaintiff Bryon Richardson suing defendant/former girlfriend Narkyssa Haskel over her breaking his car windshield, and three windshields on his neighbors’ cars also. Plaintiff had bad credit, and defendant co-signed on the lease to help plaintiff out. Plaintiff’s witness isn’t the other girlfriend in his house for the fight, but another woman (she’s his cousin).\n\nPlaintiff says they were dating but not exclusive, and defendant didn’t like that. When defendant was texted that there was another woman at defendant’s place, she went over there, while drunk, to confront plaintiff. When defendant arrived, the other woman at plaintiff’s home texted or called plaintiff, and told him to get home. Defendant smashed plaintiff’s windshield, and then smashed three other neighbors’ car windshields. Plaintiff paid for the neighbors’ windshield replacement. Defendant also told the complex security company that she would pay for the windshields, but didn’t.\n\nDefendant came to plaintiff’s home, and found him with another woman. Defendant is asked by JJ if she was arrested, and defendant says “No. I left before the police got there”.\n\nWindshields added up to $1900, plaintiff gets that.\n\nPool Table Trouble -Plaintiffs Susan and George Maadanian home sellers suing Emil Babadjov and Katrina Delaney /home buyers and defendants, over return of a pool table, or the value, from home sold by plaintiff to defendants. However, house was a short sale, and so the real seller was the bank. Defendant says plaintiffs offered to sell the pool table to defendants. Defendants didn’t want the pool table, and told plaintiffs to get the pool table out of the house before closing. Defendants hired a hauling service to get rid of pool table, and other stuff left behind in the house by plaintiffs.\n\nIf pool table was so important, plaintiffs should have moved it out before house closing occurred. In the defendants’ place, I would have called the hauling company the second closing happened, which is the buyer’s right. Defendants are counter claiming for cost to change the locks.\n\nThe only communications were between the two realtors, and not with defendants. The buyer’s realtor supposedly arranged for pool table pickup, but everything was gone. Plaintiffs moved out a year before, and rented for the first six months to renters. (This was in Porter Ranch, CA). Plaintiffs had a year to get the pool table out, but didn’t. Plaintiff wife also says it would cost $800 to get the pool table moved.\n\nPlaintiffs have a lot of excuses, but not one reason that they didn’t get the pool table they claim they can’t live without.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nAlaskan Husky Custody -Plaintiff Athena Anderson suing defendant/ex-boyfriend Juarez Ordonez for vet bills, Dog-Daycare costs, and return of the dog. Litigants were co-owners of the dog. Judge Judy has dog put in the middle of the room, so he can choose who to go with. Defendant bought another husky for plaintiff, but always had the other husky. Litigants argued and defendant took the Husky in question to his home. Defendant also owes plaintiff $1500, not the $1800 plaintiff claims he owes.\n\nPlaintiff will settle for much less if defendant will give Jacob the Husky back to plaintiff. (This is in Hesperia, CA). Defendant says dog lives part time at his parents’ home, but now at defendant’s apartment. Defendant paid for the Husky. Plaintiff filed paperwork for registration of the dog during the two months when the litigants were estranged.\n\nDog has been with defendant and family for three months. Defendant claims plaintiff isn’t allowed by landlord to have animals. However, plaintiff never actually answers JJ, just says the rental her family is in turned into month-to-month.\n\nJacob (the dog) goes over to see plaintiff. My question is that if plaintiff has another Husky, why does she want the other dog? Hopefully, not for breeding and selling puppies. I hope the dog is neutered.\n\nDog goes to see both litigants, and JJ really doesn’t know anything about Huskies.\n\nJJ sends litigants out to talk about the dog situation, and see if they can come to an agreement.\n\nThe decision is defendant gets the dog. However, JJ says if he can’t keep the dog, for some reason then he gives dog to plaintiff. Plaintiff gets her $3500.\n\nStolen Car and Credit Card? -Plaintiff/car owner Tammy Johanneson suing defendant/ex-boyfriend Frederick Price for car value after stealing plaintiff’s car. Plaintiff also says defendant stole her credit card, charged a lot on it, but all charges were reversed.\n\nDefendant claims plaintiff let him use the car all of the time. Defendant borrowed car in morning, then on the second time that day, he failed to return her car, and never told her car wasn’t coming back. Defendant claims he got jumped, and car stolen.\n\nPlaintiff says in her sworn statement that defendant’s sister told her that he sold the car in Milwaukee for crack.\n\n$1025 to plaintiff for car.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nSame Sex Wedding Woes-Plaintiff Maurice Wright suing videographer/defendant Najayah “Fitchy” Burrus for bad wedding video, and wants fee back, and damages. Videographer was only paid $250.\n\nVideographer was there from 2 or 3 p.m. to past 1 a.m., covered by the $250. The video is shown, and the preliminaries look good, but the ceremony lighting is terrible, and that part of the video looks awful. I think the groom received $250 worth of video. My personal guess is a videographer to do what the grooms wanted would cost many times $250\n\nThe groom actually hired two videographers, the defendant and an assistant, and the assistant never showed up. Defendant blames the dark lighting on the wedding venue, and says the dark video is because the venue had inadequate lighting.\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nHit-and-Run Detective-Plaintiff's Ihab Wazir Ali car was hit while his car was parked. From evidence he found, he located the owner of the car, the accident happened in a college parking lot. He’s suing defendant Ken Dukes (by the way his car is a Hyundai Accent, not a Honda Accent) for the reduced price of the car. Plaintiff found license plates at the scene of the hit-and-run, and traced them back to the defendant. Plaintiff sold the car at a reduced price.\n\nDefendant claims the license plates were stolen, and put on the same model and color car. The security guard who saw the accident, and called the police said it was the defendant's car model, and color, that did the hit-and-run, and the license plates were found on the scene. I find it amazing that the defendant's license plates were stolen twice, in a short time. Plaintiff had insurance, but was only liability.\n\n$3500 for plaintiff.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nSocial Insecurity-Plaintiff /former tenant Steven Crnogorac suing former landlord/defendant Carole Dillard for false charges, illegal eviction, and property missing. Defendant claims man was a drunk and drug abuser, claims he stole her pills. Plaintiff rented a room from defendant, then she later filed false charges against him for stealing her pills, and property damage.\n\nDefendant claims she helped move his stuff to a home across the street, and claims she didn't lock plaintiff out. Plaintiff claims defendant gave him some painkillers, after he broke his rib, and the next morning she called the police and claimed the man stole her pills. Plaintiff came home one evening, there was a lock on the chain link fence gate, and a note from plaintiff telling him he no longer lived there any longer, and that she had gotten rid of his stuff. Defendant is counter suing for cleaning fees, and rent.\n\nPlaintiff found out some of his property was at the house across the street, but had nowhere to store the items.\n\nPlaintiff will be paid for the false police report, and the court time, $500. Defendant's counter claim dismissed.\n\n(Sadly, the plaintiff died in March of 2019).\n\nParked Car Hit and Run-Plaintiff Tya Oden claims her mother's neighbor/defendant Michelle Barren hit her car, and left the scene. Plaintiff was going to the emergency room, and she heard the defendant hit her car, and saw the defendant speeding away. The plaintiff made the police report after the ER trip.\n\nDefendant had no insurance (and needs to get her bangs out of her face, they're covering one eye, and a lot of her face, and it's driving me bonkers). Charges were filed against defendant for illegal backing, but ticket was dismissed. As usual, insurance just lapsed, so defendant had two vehicles without insurance,\n\nPlaintiff receives $1,069.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nBaby Daddy Drama -Plaintiff Renee LeBlanc (SSMOT Sainted Single Mother of Two, mother of child with defendant) suing defendant Andrew Tremblay (father of younger child) for half of a loan to move into a jointly leased apartment. Defendant says he had every intention of paying his half of the loan, but plaintiff moved out of the apartment, and back in with her mother. There was a one year lease, and plaintiff moved out after two months. Defendant called the landlord the morning after the litigants argued, verbally. So, plaintiff called 911, claiming defendant needed to leave. Apparently, plaintiff has a child with defendant, and another child too.\n\nCrying in court will not change JJ’s ruling about plaintiff’s case.\n\nPlaintiff actually called 911, claiming the father was kidnapping his own child. She actually says defendant was kidnapping ‘her’ child. There was nothing written about the custody of children.\n\nThe defendant signed another lease with landlord at the first of the next month, with only his name on the lease. Defendant got behind on child support, because he was paying the full rent alone. He’s getting the arrearage paid. Defendant has a no contact order from plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff claims dismissed. JJ tells her to take the $1200 out of her child support.\n\nSisters Fight Over Puppy -Plaintiff/sister Kerri Dial suing defendant / sister Angelia Dial for the price of a puppy, and vet bills. Defendant got the dog, tiny toy Chocolate Schnauzer, defendant had the puppy for a year. Then, defendant was going away to college, and couldn’t keep the dog. Puppy cost defendant $450 from a breeder.\n\nThen, defendant wanted sister to buy the dog for more than the dog than when it was a puppy. Defendant also wants her price for the dog. However, defendant also wants money back for dog clothes, microchipping, etc. Plaintiff actually gave puppy back to defendant, so who knows where the dog is now.\n\nPlaintiff gets $450. Defendant stomps out.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nPit Bull Attacks Child – Plaintiff Jamiene Andreozzi suing defendant / pit bull owner, Patricia Bautista for defendant’s dog attacking her 8-year-old son. Son was skateboarding at a playdate with another friend, says the dog stuck its head through the wrought iron gate (vertical rods, rather far apart), and son says dog bit him. Plaintiff contacted an attorney right after the bite, before plaintiff claims her son had PTSD/nightmares. Attorney wouldn’t pursue the case.\n\nSon Elijah Panner testifies to JJ., that he was skating with a friend, went close to the gate, when dog put his head through the fence, and bit him.\n\nAfter the bite, Elijah called his mom, she came to friend’s house and picked him up, visited defendant Bautista, then to the hospital. Defendant claims her fence was brought down the same day as the bite. Defense witness didn’t see anything (obviously just wanted a trip to court).\n\nPlaintiff submits pictures of fence, there the bottom horizontal rail of fence is broken where the bottom of fence pickets should be secured. The chicken wire at the bottom of the fence was smashed down, so the Pit’s head can fit through the fence. JJ points out that the failed chicken wire to keep the Pits (defendant owns more than one) was replaced later. Defendant had smaller dogs at one time, but only has the bigger Pits now, so why did she need to replace the chicken wire? Defendant should put smaller gauge animal fencing, the on the entire inside of the fence, not just the bottom, or chicken wire.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1500 for medical bills.\n\nGiants vs. Cowboys Letdown -Plaintiff Devendra Ruparelia suing defendant/ticket seller, Jarmar Richardson to get money back plaintiff paid defendant for football game tickets that turned out to be bogus\n\nLater, defendant claims plaintiff bought basketball tickets from defendant, but plaintiff says he didn’t want to go to another game, and doesn’t trust defendant. Defendant reluctantly tells JJ who he bought the football tickets from. Defendant says he was a victim too, and he bought the tickets from a man who is now incarcerated. David who sold the tickets is back in prison.\n\nDefendant is sweating so badly that Officer Byrd has to take him Kleenex to mop his sweat of shame. Defendant claims plaintiff later bought NBA basketball tickets from him, in return for the football tickets.\n\nPlaintiff receives $350.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nBonfire Blowout-Plaintiff Eugene Newell suing neighbor/defendant Jason Tesmar for a bonfire during a party that burned his fence. Plaintiff swears bonfire kept getting bigger and bigger, and then the fire suddenly flared up, and claims someone threw gas on the bonfire. The fence was vinyl, and one panel (probably a 6' x 6') warped very badly. Defendant claims plaintiff’s wife climbs on a bench on plaintiff’s side of the fence, and yells at defendant’s guests, and rocks the fence (garbage).\n\nThere's also a dust up over using the dock on both properties. Defendant claims plaintiff's wife leans on, and shakes the fence. Defendant’s counterclaim is that common access docks are across road, and that there are no designated place for each person's dock, and plaintiff's dock has been in the same spot for 30 years. Defendant claims the plaintiff moved his dock over, and blocked his dock access. Counterclaim dismissed.\n\nI suspect the defendant and his friends did exactly what the plaintiff says. The smirk on the defendant's face is very irritating, and I think he knows exactly who damaged the fence. (This happened in Big Lake, MN).\n\nPlaintiff gets $1100 for fence.\n\nMove-Out Money-Plaintiff/former tenant Johnny Gallegos , was a month-to-month tenant wants moving costs, and renovation costs on a house he was renting, that defendant /landlord Lori Schafer gave him a 30-day notice to quit. Plaintiff claims his improvements made the property more valuable. He claims defendant evicted him to make more money, because of the rise in rents in Colorado because of legalized pot. In 2011, plaintiff took over lease of defendant’s father, and went month-to-month after that. Defendant bought/transferred property from her father, the previous owner. Defendant is suing for repair costs, to fix the 'improvements' the plaintiff/ former tenant did.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed. Defendant case dismissed. No proof of anything.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nEvidence Showdown-Plaintiff Sylvia Wright suing defendant for repossessing a car defendant Sasha Threatts sold for $600. However, defendant's witness says he paid $400 to defendant, and owes $400 more, and he still has the car. Defendant's SO, and roommate saw defendant's witness give defendant the money order, and claim none of them know the plaintiff.\n\nDefendant says she never sold anything to the plaintiff, that she thinks she's the defense witness's ex-girlfriend. Defendant also had a title loan on the car for $800. Very confusing case, and I wonder what the truth is? (Unfortunately, plaintiff hideous blonde wig is from the bizarre wig collection in JJ’s producer’s closet of disguises).\n\n$400 to plaintiff.\n\nIndependence Day Attack-Plaintiff Maria Ruiz suing defendants Scott and Michelle DeHerrera for their dogs running wild and attacking her dog on the Fourth of July. Plaintiff wants her dog’s vet bills paid. Plaintiff's dog is a cute fluffy mutt, maybe 20 pounds maximum, and she was walking two little dogs that day. (This should be quick, there are only eight minutes left of the episode). Plaintiff was walking her two leashed dogs, passing the defendant's house on her walk.\n\nPlaintiff was crossing street, and the defendant's two dogs (American Bulldog/Boxer mix, and an American Bulldog) grabbed the plaintiff’s dog, one dog was pulled off of her dog, but came back again. Defendant and wife weren't even at the dog attack site, but keep whining about what they claim happened. The defendant's adult son saw the attack, but isn't here in court.\n\nIn the Hall-terview defendant says it's negligent to walk your dog on the fourth of July, because of the fireworks! In the words of JJ, Outrageous!\n\n$2452 to plaintiff.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nStorage Wars –Plaintiff/ex Elijah Alexander suing defendant/ex girlfriend Jessica Sundeen for return of his furniture, and TV. Defendant says she’ll return the furniture when plaintiff pays back the loan she made him ($1500) with the furniture as collateral. Plaintiff denies defendant ever gave him $1500, or any other financial help.\n\nPlaintiff says when they split up, everything was put in a storage unit under defendant’s name, and a huge TV that’s in defendant’s house. Plaintiff wants the furniture and items in the storage unit, and the TV back.\n\nDefendant then chimes in saying plaintiff is a felon. Defendant claims that she made the loan after they split up, and after furniture was already in the storage unit. Defendant claim was from an envelope of cash she keeps from her disability settlement ($30,000). There is no bank information showing any withdrawal from defendant’s account around that time period.\n\nPlaintiff has five days to pick up his furniture and other items, and the TV with a marshal’s help, or by sending a moving company with a marshal supervising. Defendant claim dismissed.\n\nDog Struck by Car -Plaintiff/motorist Anthony Mesker suing defendant/dog owners Tonya and Wade Watson for car damages after their unleashed dog was hit by the driver. Defendants are counter suing for vet bills.\n\nSorry, if dog is off your property, and out of your control, whatever happens to the dog, the vehicle owner is due the car repairs. Motorist owes nothing. Plaintiff says he’s seen their dog on at least three occasions, one time off their property, one time on their property, but not confined.\n\nDefendant wife says her dog has a collar, I’m guessing invisible fence. Invisible fence doesn’t stop a determined animal from running through the alarm, and shock, but it does mean once out, the animal isn’t running back to the yard. Also, batteries run out, and fencing systems can malfunction.\n\nWhen plaintiff was driving down the road, the dog ran out in front of him, and after it was struck, plaintiff called his insurance company, and went back to find out about the dog. Only defendant’s children were home that day, 16, 11, and 8.\n\nDefendants claims plaintiff must have come off the road (their house is on a corner), crossed their property and hit the dog in their yard. Defendants didn’t bring the 16-year-old daughter who is the oldest person home that day.\n\n$1088 to plaintiff for car damages. Defendant case dismissed.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nDon’t Spank My Daughter! -Plaintiff/mother Suzanne Longo-Clark suing defendant/father of child, and ex-husband Douglas Clark, for $5,000 for him filing charges against her for spanking their 9-year-old daughter.\n\nPlaintiff is court-ordered not to touch the child, but she ignored that, so father contacted CPS. Father has full primary physical custody. Plaintiff keeps whining about CPS being involved, claims CPS and custody hearings were rigged. Mother had visitation with the child, supervised only. During a supervised court visitation (supervisor is plaintiff’s witness), plaintiff spanked her child at least twice.\n\nThere are scheduled phone calls between mother and daughter, and mother says daughter was disrespectful ten calls in a row, and daughter would hang up. Visitation was once a week, and phone calls were weekly too. Mother keeps claiming ex-boyfriend or husband is mean to her.\n\nWhen daughter came for visitation, mother hit her on the butt twice, in front of the supervisor. In my view plaintiff witness/visitation supervisor should be taken off the list for supervising visits. I question the supervisor’s impartiality. When daughter returned home, father filed a sheriff’s report about the court order visitation violation. Defendant has a protective order against the plaintiff, and daughter is a protected person on that order.\n\nPlaintiff witness/paid visitation supervisor Doug McIntire apparently sees nothing wrong with plaintiff violating the order which states that she can’t strike, slap, or otherwise use corporal punishment on the daughter. Plaintiff keeps sneaking in that defendant supposedly threatened to kill her, and beat her. Plaintiff still keeps interrupting to slander the defendant.\n\nAs JJ says, this wasn’t a false allegation by the father.\n\nI disagree with JJ, the plaintiff planned exactly what she was going to do to the little girl, and the visitation supervisor did nothing to help.\n\nPlaintiff says visitation supervisor intervened that day, and she still denies the swatting was to the point of abuse. The day in question, at the neutral meeting site, under supervision, she immediately hit the child, and cursed at her. She is currently under treatment for mental health issues, and seems to be unable to control her anger at the child.\n\nPlaintiff refuses to admit that she broke the court order not to strike her child. Court visitation supervisor Doug McIntire says he is still going to work with plaintiff and supervise visitation, which I object to. He’s not impartial, and testifies he sees nothing wrong with what plaintiff did.\n\n(Since this case was 2013, and child was 9 when this happened, then child should be old enough not to have to deal with plaintiff any longer).\n\nIn hall-terview, plaintiff goes off on her witness, and former visitation supervisor. She claims he lied about her too. Why do I bet he was next on her list to sue? She's a frequent flier in court.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nBroken Door = Broken Friendship -Plaintiff Elizabeth O’Harra suing defendant/former friend Lauren Olsen for defendant breaking two door handles on plaintiff’s car. This was winter, and plaintiff claims she broke two door handles off, an inside handle and an outside handle. $576 is what plaintiff wants.\n\nPlaintiff receives $0.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nBike Buyer's Remorse-Plaintiffs Ashley Masters and her stepfather Mark Sepulveda suing defendant/motorcycle shop owner and mechanic Christopher Grabau over repairs on an old bike. Plaintiffs want all of their payments back, even though defendant claims he fixed the bike as requested. Defendant gave plaintiff Mark Sepulveda an estimate of $2,000 to fix the bike, but only a verbal estimate. Defendant says bike was in horrible shape, and it was hard to have a specific estimate. Plaintiff supplied parts, and estimate was for labor only. Plaintiff step father paid $2000+, picked up bike, and it’s at another shop now. Plaintiff picked up bike once, returned to shop and then brought it back for a dead battery issue.\n\nThen, motorcycle was at plaintiff’s home for months, then taken by plaintiffs to another shop.\n\nNothing for the litigants, and they deserve nothing.\n\nCash Cow House? -Plaintiff/ landlord James Bruno suing defendant /former tenant Carla Brewer over a house that was rented by defendant, husband, and three kids. Plaintiff alleges damages, but the place was owned by someone else for many years, a student rental for a year, and property was never improved except for an outside paint job.\n\nThis case illustrates why you take pictures before move in, and on move out for a rental property. Before pictures from craigslist look good, but former renter denies the house looked that good when she moved in. Why did landlords come on this show? I find it ridiculous that JJ says she often sides with landlords, because she doesn’t.\n\nLandlord does keep the security deposit. He should have been awarded three new doors for the storage room, and the two bedrooms, they obviously had a fist smashed through them.\n\nPlaintiff gets nothing.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nRescue Chihuahua Chase-Plaintiff/dog owner Janet Lauritsen suing defendants/neighbor and tenant Leonard Edwards , and landlord, Susan Hounsom, for fence to keep defendant’s tenant’s dog out of her yard, and away from her dog. After a neighbor's dog attacks her Chihuahua, a plaintiff demands compensation for the new fence she put up. Plaintiff didn’t have a fence, but tenant/landlord did, tenant’s dog dug under the fence and attacked the Chihuahua owned by plaintiff. Plaintiff already had her yard securely fenced. The part of fence along tenant/landlord’s yard belonged to defendant, and plaintiff didn’t put up fence. So, plaintiff wants to be paid for fencing her own property.\n\nPlaintiff claims doctor bills, but has no human doctor bills to show. Plaintiff took the dog to the vet, but she didn't go to the doctor, even though she didn't know about the rabies vaccine status of the defendant's dog. Defendant landlord paid the $81 vet bill.\n\nPlaintiff also threatened to report defendant to licensing board for realtors. Plaintiff wanted $1300 for fence, and threatened to file a CPS report against the tenant (he has two family foster kids, so they already have CPS oversight). There is nothing in the vet report about a dog bite.\n\nPlaintiff works at the customer service at Home Depot, and sent 15 threatening emails in one week to defendant landlord saying slanderous allegations against defendant.\n\nPlaintiff fence and harassment case dismissed. JJ also reassures the defendant/landlord/realtor/broker that the small town they live in will all watch the case, and know who the nut case is.\n\nRoommate Misfits-Plaintiff Amanda Stoewer suing former roommate/defendant Kellie Green for unpaid rent, utility bills, and property damages. A former roommate is accused of skipping out on eight months of rent, utility bills, and property damage. Plaintiff never tried to get a replacement roommate after defendant left. They were roommates for the first year of the lease, and after the renewal is when things went bad.\n\nDefendant is saying all kinds of nasty things about plaintiff, and plaintiff returns the favor. There was a $75 cost to break the lease for defendant.\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nEdited December 28, 2021 by CrazyInAlabama\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nClean and Sober Suit -Plaintiff/ex-boyfriend James Goad suing defendant/ex-girlfriend Jennifer Powell for eviction, and stolen belongings. Defendant is suing for the same things, eviction, and stolen belongings. Litigants have a child, and defendant has two more children. SSMOT (Sainted Single Mother of Three) says they were both druggies, and her other two children are with her father in Texas\n\nPlaintiff has a full-time job, but defendant hasn’t worked full time since 2001. Defendant says they were both living on the streets, using drugs. Defendant claims she’s been clean and sober since 2009.\n\nLitigants are currently fighting over custody of the baby. Parents are no longer a couple. Defendant can’t control herself, and keeps trying to interrupt JJ.\n\nPlaintiff claims where they used to live, defendant changed the locks, and illegally kept his property. Defendant claims all property is the daughter’s, not plaintiff. Property is mostly stuffed animals, a VCR, TV, child’s books and toys.\n\nJJ says defendant had no right to evict plaintiff. (This case happened in 2013, I wonder how the baby is now?). I really dislike defendant and her smirks about getting off the hook for returning anything, and I doubt her statements of being sober for five years.\n\nWhen plaintiff says he’s never tested dirty on his drug tests, and defendant says he’s lying. Defendant says he tested positive for marijuana, but a false positive, and defendant says plaintiff tested positive for coke.\n\nJJ tells litigants that they’re not good for each other, and should stay apart.\n\nPlaintiff doesn’t have receipts for anything. JJ dismisses plaintiff and defendant case for lack of merit, except JJ returns VCR to plaintiff.\n\nCriminal or Justified -Plaintiff/ex-girlfriend Ashley Whittaker suing defendant/ex-boyfriend William Yager for a repayment of a loan ($2500) so defendant could get divorced, and for damages to plaintiff’s car. Defendant paid $1,000 back to plaintiff, and still owes $1500. JJ dismisses the car damages, because the litigants used each other’s car constantly, and while they were living together.\n\nDefendant says he paid for plaintiff’s iPhone 4, instead of paying the rest of his loan back to plaintiff. Defendant says he’s paying for the iPhone that plaintiff has, and an additional line for her phone.\n\n$1500 to plaintiff for the loan.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nBrick Toss? -Plaintiff /ex-boyfriend Joseph David suing ex-girlfriend/defendant Tiffany Ernest, for return of his TV. Defendant says ex moved in with her right after his latest prison stay. After a fight, defendant took plaintiff’s TV, and rolled a perfume bottle in his car.\n\nPlaintiff lived with defendant for two years, between prison stays. Plaintiff bought the TV with his inheritance from his late father. Plaintiff has the furniture from their former apartment.\n\nDefendant claims plaintiff threw a brick at her car. However, a month after the alleged brick toss, and defendant throwing the perfume bottle into his car, they moved into the apartment together.\n\nPlaintiff gets his TV back, within 5 days with marshal’s help. Defendant case dismissed.\n\nPlastic Surgery Feud -Plaintiff Marife Jarillo (nee Marife McQuillan) suing defendant/former co-worker Zena O’Brien for non-payment of a loan plaintiff took out for defendant to get breast augmentation, $2881 left to pay. Defendant claims plaintiff to take the loan out, and defendant would make the payments. Defendant claims plaintiff got arrested for shoplifting, and if defendant didn’t press charges against plaintiff for emptying defendant’s bank account.\n\nDefendant says bank records show that Marife McQuillan (previous name of plaintiff) had made a phone order to the bank to pay the loan for the boobies to the finance company.\n\nPlaintiff is asked by JJ if she authorized the bank to pay the loan to the doctor’s office. Plaintiff says defendant only paid a little over $400. There is still $3,045 left on the loan.\n\nPlaintiff receives $3045. (In the hall-terview, plaintiff outs the defendant. Not nice).\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nDoggie Daycare Disaster-Plaintiff / former landlord Adam Anderson suing defendant/former tenant Elizabeth Dupnik who claimed she was starting a dog walking business, and is suing for damages from pet boarding business. Plaintiff claims defendant was actually advertising dog boarding services on Facebook. Defendant moved into the rental house with her 7- month-old child, and her father was a co-signer. Plaintiff did research after tenant moved out, and he saw the damages, and discovered the dog boarding business. Plaintiff kept the unrefundable pet deposit, and the security deposit, just under $1895.\n\nDefendant admits to having foster dogs, and I suggest she was doing Doggie Daycare, and boarding, which is not dog walking. Lease limits defendant to one dog, and with a substantial fee for any additional dogs.\n\nPlaintiff has a FB ad for dog boarding, and with pictures of several dogs in the back yard of the home. Broken cabinets, trash left behind, nasty carpets. Defendant claims she paid someone to deep clean the rugs, but they look nasty.\n\nIt took a month to clean, paint, and re-carpet the home. And defendant left property behind into the next month, so she owes for the month's rent. Photos show the home was in pristine condition, and newly painted before defendant moved in. Defendant's witness is a realtor who has known the defendant forever, and is totally lying. Additional plaintiff fees are for lost garage door opener, smoking in the house, and other damages.\n\n$1313 to plaintiff for damages.\n\nMouth of Pain-Plaintiff/sister Lorraina Olarte suing defendant/brother Larry Westerfield II for a loan for massive amount of dental work (last time it was speculated that the X rays should be used for ads for \"this is your mouth on meth\" commercials. However, the teeth look like massive decay issues). Dentist advised the healthiest option was pull the remaining top teeth, and do dentures. Plaintiff wants her Care Credit bill paid, and defendant claims it was a gift. The dentist was smart, because the first people the consumers refuse to pay are dentists, doctors, veterinarians, and other providers.\n\nLarry II is 43, and an electrician, who lives with mommy. Defendant claims his mother told the sister about his teeth, and then sister took defendant to the dentist, where the dentist said it was the worst mouth he'd ever seen. The dentist office is smart not to take payments, and sister was a fool to get the Care Credit account.\n\nDefendant went back to work two months later, and claims he gave the sister cash. A licensed electrician doesn't make $10 an hour, and man still owes about $10,000 child support. Balance is $3386 left, because sister has been making payments. It’s so sad to need full dentures at 43.\n\n$3547 to plaintiff. (If they're so estranged, then why the big hug, and \"I Still Love You Too\" in the hall-terview?)\n\n(A personal rant. When I was a kid, and dinosaurs roamed the earth, many parents believed that baby teeth didn't need dental visits, or any type of care. I knew other kids that had visibly decayed teeth. Some of those kids never learned proper dental care. I've known adults who never saw a dentist until something painful happened. So, depending on the minerals in the drinking water, and hygiene, the man's teeth might have been vulnerable to rot, and without practicing correct, regular dental hygiene, they were in horrible shape.)\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nDaters or Debtors? -Plaintiff David Leeson suing defendant Amanda Ferguson for repayment of loans. The couple met in the drive-thru of a fast-food restaurant, Jack in the Box, in San Antonio. The talked at the restaurant, then came to talk at his house, and then she needed money.\n\nSadly, plaintiff kept making loans for moving fees, a class, bail, etc. and defendant never paid him back a penny. No expectation of repayment. My guess JJ will say this wasn’t a loan, after the first loan.\n\nPlaintiff gets $600, the original loan, the rest are dismissed, because he had no expectation of repayment.\n\nSlashed Tires and Jealousy?! -Plaintiff Adrien Atkins suing defendant/ex-girlfriend Janita Hunter for slashing his tires. The two had been living together, and had one child together. (This happened in Los Angeles).\n\nAfter the break-up, plaintiff claims defendant slashed his four tires, and requests $1200 for replacement tires.\n\nKevin Hunter, plaintiff’s cousin and witness saw defendant pull up to plaintiff’s house in her silver Jaguar, witness heard a hissing sound, and claims defendant slashed plaintiff’s tires.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1200.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nExplicit Photos Disputed -Plaintiff/photographer Tora White suing defendant/ex-girlfriend LaToya Rutledge for using photos he took of her on her website. He wants $2,000 for copyright infringement. Defendant says he took clothed and unclothed/explicit pics of her. Then they broke up, and were only casual friends. She wanted him to take her little sister’s prom picture, and then took the pictures of her. He never took the prom pictures, and he denies she asked him to do this.\n\nJJ points out that if defendant didn’t want nasty pictures circulated of her, then she shouldn’t have taken them. There is a text from defendant asking plaintiff to take her pictures for $150.\n\nDefendant says plaintiff took pictures of her several times.\n\nPlaintiff receives $150. Defendant counter suit dismissed.\n\nHell Date -Plaintiff Donald Causey suing defendant/ex-girlfriend Amanda Jeanblanc for stealing his car, and wrecking it. Plaintiff says he lost his job after she wrecked his car. He had to have transportation for his job. Plaintiff was on a break with the girlfriend, when he posted on Facebook “I’m single, and I’m ready to mingle”.\n\nPolice report says defendant was drunk, and totally responsible for the accident. Defendant claims a truck crossed the line, and trying to avoid the truck, she wrecked the car. Defendant wants her clothes back, and will get that. Defendant has to return plaintiff’s house, and mailbox keys to get her clothes back.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1,875.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nHousesitting Hijacker? -Plaintiff /home owner Steve Crestol suing defendant/house sitter Kristen Curtis for trashing the house, stealing property, and money, and neglecting his dog. Plaintiff was traveling, and claims he was too tired to take pictures with his cell phone. However, plaintiff did use his phone to text the defendant.\n\nPlaintiff and his other part time housemate are in the motion picture business, and travel a lot. Plaintiff did not do a full background check on defendant. There were two forged checks the bank notified plaintiff about. Then two more bad checks coming through. So, defendant asked his L.A.P.D. neighbor to remove jewelry and other valuables from the house and secure them. When neighbor went to find the jewelry, it was there. However, checkbook was useless to thief after account was closed by plaintiff. Plaintiff claims $2,000 in cash was claimed stolen from his desk by thieving defendant.\n\nPlaintiff’s co-worker and occasional housemate is current incarcerated.\n\nPlaintiff claims the $2,000 was stolen, his laptop, tools, and other items. Plaintiff submits texts from defendant. Also, LAPD neighbor can’t appear in court or on TV. So, witness can’t testify about the criminal acts perpetrated by the defendant. This happened in Canyon Country, CA.\n\nPlaintiff didn’t take photos of house damage. Plaintiff has no proof of defendant stealing and trashing of house. JJ doesn’t believe the $2,000 cash. Defendant’s text implies she stole from plaintiff, and blames another friend for stealing things. (I believe the plaintiff’s story, and think defendant did exactly what plaintiff says she did).\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nDrunk, Disorderly and Half Naked -Plaintiff Kristin Ewart suing defendant/neighbor Alfredo “Fred” Robles (21 years-old) for breaking her TV, and a Wii, and a speaker during a party at plaintiff’s house. Defendant blames the TV, speaker, and Wii damages on plaintiff feeding him alcohol, and says it’s a “Party Foul”. Officer Byrd doesn’t know what that means.\n\nPlaintiff said defendant’s pants were down below his knees, and he was standing next to the fallen TV, trying to pick the TV up, and there is a huge dent in the wall next to the TV, probably from defendant’s head.\n\nDefendant doesn’t remember anything about the end of the party. And denies he did anything while drunk. At his age, if you are drinking so much you don’t remember anything the next day, you’re in serious trouble. In the hall-terview plaintiff claims defendant was playing beer pong, followed by vodka shots. Defendant says he’s trying to get his tolerance up.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1500.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nJudge Judy Calls a Bluff-Plaintiff Chris Pasquarella suing defendant/future brother-in-law Daniel Martinez for stealing his rental car. Plaintiff rented car, (defendant claims the plaintiff's rental was through a friend at the dealership). Defendant says plaintiff and fiance were going to LA to take stuff up there too, and fiance was going to use the rental for her, and the kids, and defendant was going to drive the rental car. When they were in L.A., the rental car got impounded by police after defendant was stopped for a traffic issue, and it was discovered that defendant had a suspended license.\n\nAs usual, defendant has no license, and got off road at checkpoint, and got arrested, for unpaid ticket failure to appear for driving without a license. Car was impounded. Plaintiff claims he drove rental to LA, and fiance's father drove them home, and when JJ gets the father's phone number, plaintiff admits the story he told was a lie. Plaintiff claims he drove the rental to L.A., but I thought defendant was driving the rental? Fiance/wife supposedly drove the family car to L.A.\n\nSo, if they had two cars in LA, and one car disappeared, then why did the father have to drive them back to San Diego? Half of impound charges for each side, because plaintiff knew defendant had no license.\n\n$981 to plaintiff.\n\nMercedes in the Middle -Plaintiff Heather Bauer suing defendant/ex-boyfriend Carlos Rodriguez for harassment, and title to a Mercedes. Plaintiff wanted Mercedes, and boyfriend co-signed for the loan. Then they broke up, plaintiff took the car, and defendant started getting late payment notices, affecting his credit. Money is still owed on vehicle, and plaintiff wants car title signed over to her (not happening). Defendant wants car refinanced in plaintiff's name taking him off the loan. The funny thing is the plaintiff's job title is \"financial consultant\". Plaintiff’s mother is her ‘witness’, who won’t shut up.\n\nJJ gives plaintiff 30 days to refinance the car in her name, then defendant will sign the title over. Defendant agrees to sign anything needed to get the refinance. However, defendant asks a good question \"What if she can't get it refinanced in her name?\" I would be that the refinance never happened, and I bet defendant had to keep paying to preserve his credit. If car isn’t refinanced, defendant can repo the car.\n\nNothing for anyone.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nTrucking Company Chaos! -Trucking company owner/plaintiff Brent Minnick sues defendant/truck driver Clark Mallard for truck breaking down (a 1994 truck), and having to recover the truck, plus stolen property. To quote JJ: \"Ridiculous\".\n\nThe truck trailer was a two-level car hauler, and the support posts for the top level were bad, but truck owner wanted him to load vehicles on the top level anyway, after temporary repairs. Truck driver quit after company owner wouldn't pay him. Driver wants to be paid for the three days.\n\nCase dismissed for plaintiff, and defendant gets $200.\n\nStolen Boat Rip-Off -Plaintiff Aimee Ramos buys boat from defendant George Eberhardt, and she says police (Fish & Game actually) confiscated boat, because it was stolen, and she wants $2000 for purchase price, and registration fees.\n\nDefendant boat seller says Fish & Game never told him the boat was stolen, or contacted him about selling stolen property. Defendant says he's not sure plaintiff's boat that was confiscated is the same one he sold her. I believe defendant was right, I bet plaintiff sold the original boat for a better deal. I think defendant should have been able to see the registration number for the boat, and confirm it was ever his property. Police returned trailer to plaintiff, but not boat.\n\n$1586 to plaintiff.\n\nEdited December 30, 2021 by CrazyInAlabama\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2013)-\n\nCat Fight and Crash! -Plaintiff /security guard John Couch suing defendant Devesha Thomas (car driver), and her brother Terrance Cowan (car owner). Altercation in a nightclub parking lot results in a three-vehicle collision and a security guard’s suit for damages to his car. Defendant woman paid for the car, but it was in her brother’s name. Insurance lapsed over a month before the accident.\n\nPlaintiff’s witness, Cory Pewitt, is another security guard at the nightclub, and witness was a passenger in his car. Plaintiff and witness were in plaintiff’s car, at the nightclub where they worked, when defendant Devesha Thomas driving her brother’s car (he’s Terrance Cowan), without insurance, hit the plaintiff’s car, and another security guard’s car.\n\nMs. Thomas had insurance, but forgot to pay the bill. Defendant, and her girlfriend were leaving the club at 2:30 a.m., having a fist fight in the car, when the defendant hit the car owned by plaintiff. Head of security took defendant’s phony insurance information, and didn’t do a report on the wreck.\n\nDefendant woman wants $5,000 for a car her brother bought in 2010 for $900.\n\nPlaintiff submits the information from defendant’s insurance card the night of the accident. Card said that insurance lapsed a month before the incident.\n\nDefendant case dismissed. Defendant still says the accident wasn’t her fault. JJ and everyone who ever saw this case disagree with that. Police didn’t do a report, because the parking lot is private property (Yes, that’s how it works in some states).\n\nPlaintiff witness says both women in defendant’s car were still fighting, when they were dragged out of the car. Defendant keeps saying the accident was plaintiff’s fault. Defendant is delusional.\n\nPlaintiff gets $3000 for his car damages.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nMoney Stolen from a Thief? -Plaintiff/ex-boyfriend Randall Thom suing defendant/ex-girlfriend Linda Davis for using his debit card for unauthorized charges while he was incarcerated. Defendant is counter suing for dog and housesitting fees. Card had $2300 on the pre-paid card when he went to jail, and card was supposed to be used to pay rent, utilities, etc.\n\nDefendant went way over the amount she was supposed to use.\n\n$1500 to plaintlff.\n\nGuilty of Domestic Violence -Plaintiff/ex-girlfriend Anyssa Ancona, and has a child with defendant/ex-boyfriend Joseph Grimm, for the fees for breaking their apartment lease $2,000. The litigants have one child together. Defendant admits to assaulting his child’s mother. Plaintiff’s aunt was paying her part of the monthly rent.\n\nAfter plaintiff beat defendant up, she moved away to live with relatives, and obtained a 1-year restraining order, after plaintiff pled Nolo Contendre to assault, and received probation.\n\nDefendant settled with collection agency for her half of the lease breaking fee, $3300, reduced from $5,000. Defendant paid $2600, so plaintiff owes $700 more. Defendant also filed for a restraining order for stupid reasons.\n\nPlaintiff receives $2,000 for lease breaking fees, and the false restraining order defendant tried to get.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2016)-\n\nAntique Car Destroyed?! -Plaintiff/car owner Tyron Harris suing defendant /body shop owner Antonio Mattox for damages to his rusty, old car, a ’69 Buick LeSaber. Car was very rusty, and needed body work, and then paint. Unfortunately, a tree fell on the car while parked at the body shop, and wants $4400. Defendant wants $1500. Plaintiff bought it for $2700 in 1992.\n\nDefendant says he wasn’t hired to fix the rust damages. However, it was defendant’s tree that clipped the plaintiff’s car, but he used Bondo, and paint to fix the damages from the tree.\n\nPlaintiff finally got his car back, after county closed down defendant’s illegal body shop. Defendant has to remove 33 cars after the county shut his shop down. The after picture of the car is horrible.\n\nDefendant claims he had to tow car to his illegal shop. Plaintiff claims he drove the car to defendant’s place.\n\n$1500 to plaintiff, nothing to defendant.\n\nRoommate or Thief?! -Plaintiff/former tenant Cheryl Love suing defendant /former landlord Cindy Chambers for return of property, including leather coats, purses, shoes, and other items. Defendant says plaintiff stole money from her purse, and wants unpaid rent. Both litigants were patients at a mental health facility when they met.\n\nDefendant let plaintiff move into her spare room after plaintiff was evicted. Plaintiff claims she had an unlawful detainer by previous landlord, and that’s still in the hands of her attorney.\n\nOfficer Byrd certainly isn’t working on the crossword puzzle today, and I bet the court security officers are on high alert.\n\nPlaintiff claims she gave defendant $300 a month cash, and took photos of each payment. Defendant says plaintiff didn’t pay her anything.\n\nPlaintiff claims defendant had a baby by the homeless man who climbs in her window at night, and claims defendant sells drugs. Plaintiff claims defendant lost custody of her children (children are with her brother).\n\nOfficer Byrd reminds JJ where the two litigants met.\n\nDefendant denies having anything belonging to plaintiff, and police put plaintiff out of the house.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nIn the hall-terview plaintiff is still ranting. Defendant still says plaintiff stole her money.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nThe Pregnant Chihuahua Did it-Plaintiff / former landlord and ex-girlfriend Tiara Spencer, is suing defendant / former tenant Angel Carrillo for apartment damages, which are blamed on his pregnant Chihuahua, and unpaid rent.\n\nWhen defendant left apartment, his Chihuahua and her puppies were locked in his room, and he just left them. Defendant is a perennial victim, who had leached off of friends and relatives for over 10 years. Defendant was employed when the litigants moved into the apartment, it was a three bedroom, one was for defendant's seven-year-old daughter. Defendant lost his job, they fought, and he left without contact, before the first month was over.\n\nPlaintiff doesn't look too good either, because she left the dog locked in the room, and only broke in when the dog started barking, and clawing at the door for over two weeks, after complaints from the management company. She fed the dog under the door. She then took the dog, and puppies to the pound.\n\nI loathe both litigants for their cruelty to a tiny little dog, and her puppies.\n\n$4800 to plaintiff.\n\nDeceased Parents, Feuding Children -Plaintiff sisters Diane Buhite, Carolyn “Kitty” Evenson, and Judy Paukovich are suing defendant brother Harvey “Dick” Rusko , and wife Julie Rusko for return of deceased parents’ property, and claim undue influence on the parents. There were nine siblings, one deceased, and only three sisters are suing. The three sisters rarely saw the parents. The coven of sisters hired an attorney, the court appointed a guardian, but they're still whining about the parents, and both parents died in 2012.\n\nProperty they're suing about was sold by father before he died, and they're still blaming the brother.\n\nParents filed an application for a restraining order against daughters. All court cases were dismissed, and appeal by sisters was denied.\n\nSisters are still upset that defendant 'banned' them from the funeral.\n\nCase dismissed, and will never be over. The transfers and deaths were 2012 and before, so nothing will ever happen legally.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nHead-Butted! -Plaintiff David Bordeau suing defendant Brian Munch for assaulting him at a bar fight. Plaintiff says defendant was with plaintiff’s estranged brother, a fight broke out, and plaintiff was head-butted and his nose was damaged, but not broken. Defendant says he was in the bar, but didn’t assault plaintiff. This happened in the Wisconsin Dells.\n\nPlaintiff says defendant and the brother were talking, then brother wanted to fight plaintiff, and plaintiff refused to fight. Then, when plaintiff was going into the bar, brother was talking to defendant who had a Mohawk at the time, when plaintiff was assaulted by defendant. Plaintiff was head butted in the face, and pushed down the stairs. And plaintiff could hear his brother laughing about the assault.\n\nPolice report is submitted. Defendant has a police record, and they have a photo of him. Witnesses identified the defendant, and police knew who he was. Shortly after this, plaintiff identified the defendant from the photo lineup. Defendant dramatically changed his appearance after the assault, changing his hair and beard, so plaintiff no longer recognized the defendant. Defendant changed his beard, and grew his hair out, between the September assault, and the following June.\n\n$5,000 to plaintiff. Nothing for defendant.\n\nCoin Collection Thief -Plaintiff Amateo Seno suing defendant/ ex-girlfriend Lisa Radamaker over the theft of a coin collection plaintiff owned. They lived together, had an argument, and plaintiff tossed a bottle, and it shattered, and a piece of glass hit defendant, and he left to cool off. When he came back to the home his coin collection was gone, and defendant admits she took it.\n\nDefendant claims she'll need plastic surgery for the cut, and sold the coin collection to pay the rent, after the assault. Defendant shows the cut, but I can't see much in real court with a very close shot, and this is high definition that shows everything. I see nothing on her cheek that she claims was slashed open, and she never saw a doctor. JJ asks if defendant is on any medications, and she says no.\n\nDefendant has no medical bills, or medical report to submit, and never went to the doctor. Defendant has a police report, but didn't bring it to court. JJ asks where the coins are, and defendant says she sold them, and spent the money.\n\nDefendant case gets $5,000. Plaintiff gets $5,000, so they cancel each other out, and get nothing. JJ doesn't believe anyone, and I agree with her.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nPellet Gun Shoot Out -Plaintiff/car owner Audrey Neal suing defendant parent Daniel Hall, and son Kevin Hall, for the 14-year-old shooting out her windshield. Ms. Neal was driving her car home, something shattered her windshield, and she had an eye injury. Unfortunately, the pellet gun incident was after plaintiff had cataract surgery, and it injured her eye again.\n\nSon Kevin Hall had four detentions in school, (that the parent knows about), and was then suspended from school, and has not done well in his classes. Defendant father and mother bought the pellet gun for delinquent Kevin Hall.\n\nKevin Hall admits to more than the four detentions his father talked about in court. He also can’t remember why he got detention, admits he didn’t pass most of his classes in the previous year, and the year of this incident. Kevin was suspended for hitting a girl with a pencil (that’s assault, but was listed as harassment).\n\nWhen Kevin was suspended his parents sent him to his grandfather’s house. This was so grandparents could supervise the little criminal. The pellet gun was at the grandfather’s house. Kevin claims the pellet gun is only used with his grandfather present.\n\nKevin the delinquent also claims the pellet gun found by police in the bushes wasn’t his, and he doesn’t know who shot Ms. Neal’s window. Ms. Neal’s police statement identifies Kevin Hall as the attacker, and knows the other two boys, a neighbor’s son, and the other kid was unknown to plaintiff.\n\nJJ calls Kevin the delinquent to the witness chair to tell her his lies. Former friend of Kevin the delinquent, Lewis, wrote a note saying Kevin shot the windshield, and says Kevin has broken numerous windows. Father believes Kevin’s lies that he was in the grandfather’s house watching TV, and not out shooting the BB gun.\n\nKevin’s father keeps saying Kevin isn’t a bad kid, or a bad student, both statements are total ca-ca. Daniel Hall blames the suspension on the girl that was assaulted, and the school aide, and claims the other kids are lying about Kevin Hall being the shooter. Now father is blaming everything on the neighborhood, not his kid. Father also says his son is being bullied.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1325 (JJ would have given her more). I think JJ should have given plaintiff $5,000, so lying Kevin, and his father wouldn’t get a penny (if the rumor that money left over from the awards is split between plaintiff and defendant, but I hope it isn’t true).\n\nCar Security – Plaintiffs Tyson Smith and Kimberly Bara are suing defendant Matthew Arnold for a car and engine purchased for $1600. The car was a non-running vehicle, and engine was for the car, to get it running again. Plaintiffs didn’t get the title for the car, and now that the car is running, plaintiff can’t register the car (this is in California). JJ will send litigants to the DMV right across from the court room, and register the car now.\n\nPlaintiffs will register the car now at DMV.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nDivorced and Angry-Plaintiff Laurie Cole suing estranged Mother-in-Law/defendant Judith Cole for a false restraining order, and attorney's fees. Plaintiff need child support (three children with Kenny Cole), and MIL paid for one month for her deadbeat son. Then, defendant ex-husband Kenny Cole raided the marital joint account, and took off for Florida fun with his side piece.\n\nSo, plaintiff called MIL for money, and then MIL called the son by the pool in Florida. Defendant son called police, and police told MIL to get a restraining order against plaintiff. Ex-husband did leave his mother a check for $1400, but dated 31 September (not a typo, so it was a bad check), for the child support.\n\nMIL filed for a protective order, and plaintiff had to get an attorney to fight the order.\n\nProtective order was denied, and plaintiff gets $1,783 for the attorney fees, everything else dismissed.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nYou're Not the Victim Here-Plaintiff Thomas Soliz suing defendant/neighbor Irene Fleischman for defendant’s 13-year-old daughter crashing her car into plaintiff's parked car. Defendant claims plaintiff harassed her, daughter wasn't driving, and says no one saw the daughter crash the car, and it was an old car anyway. Defendant says car was running in driveway, daughter was in passenger seat, and daughter put it in gear, and the crash happened. There was no insurance on the car, as usual.\n\nDaughter says sitting in the passenger seat, put the car in reverse to get it ready for the mother to drive, and the car moved. Daughter says she didn't realize the car would move when she put it in reverse. The plaintiff's car damage is bad, and his insurance went up because of the car accident. $500 deductible, and rental car, equals $. Defendant claims plaintiff harassed her, and a family member assaulted the daughter. Defendant claims daughter said plaintiff did trunk damage with a crow bar.\n\nDefendant wants $5000 for harassment, and the attack on her daughter. She claims the plaintiff is in a gang, and has gang members threaten her, and beat up her daughter. (Sorry, I lived where there are gangs, they don't wear ties, dress shirts, and look like they're going to work.)\n\nThe police report shows the defendant claimed to have insurance, but she had no insurance. The 'assault' is claimed to be either the by the wife or the sister of the plaintiff, and both daughters claim to be assaulted on the same time. Plaintiff says the people that were fighting came out of the defendant's house.\n\n$693 to plaintiff for deductible, and rental car.\n\nRandom Drug Test Crash-18-year-old plaintiff Kyle Currington claims 18-year-old Abigail Reece defendant damaged his car, when she took his car to a drug test (part of getting promoted at Walmart). (Defendant seems stoned right now). Defendant says she didn't wreck car, but it had damage when she came out of the drug test lab.\n\nPlaintiff claims defendant was trying to get clean pee for her urine test, and went several places, but that's hearsay. However, I definitely believe the defendant is a long-term user, since she thinks JJ is believing her lame story.\n\n$1124 for plaintiff (No. defendant isn't still working at Walmart).\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nSister Fight -Plaintiff /sister Laura Ruiz defendant/sister Delores “Dee” Valdez for an assault and damaged property. Plaintiff moved home to Utah, left a lot of stuff in storage, brought some to defendant’s house when she moved in, mostly personal items. Then plaintiff was going to sell excess property at a garage sale. Shortly after arriving, the two sisters started arguing. Defendant’s daughter and boyfriend got involved. Then, defendant took her daughter’s side, and plaintiff claims defendant assaulted and spit on her.\n\nDefendant claims plaintiff assaulted her, so she told plaintiff to get out of her house. Police were called, and defendant later pled guilty to the assault in return for probation, so defendant’s counter claim is dismissed.\n\nThe main property plaintiff wants is a huge giraffe statue. Plaintiff had a four-hour police standby to retrieve her property, but left the only thing she wants now behind?\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nBiting Dalmatian? -Plaintiff/cousin Jamie Strobel suing defendant/cousin Rebekah Strobel, for lease breaking fees. Two cousins leased an apartment together. Then, plaintiff's Dalmatian attacked defendant. Plaintiff claims after the attack she was forced to move out for her own safety. Plaintiff claims the Dalmatian was hit by a car, and abused by a burglar, and has issues with new people, and tries to attack people.\n\nPlaintiff told defendant that dog would get used to her, and be fine with defendant's presence. They moved in during January, and in February attacked defendant, trapped her in the bathroom, and bit her leg.\n\nThe photos of the bite are bad. Then in March defendant moved out formally, and took everything, but physically moved out right after the bite. Defendant couldn't have anyone over, especially children, without the dog becoming aggressive. Plaintiff wouldn't do anything about the dog, so defendant moved out. JJ says plaintiff has to get rid of the dog, or pay her own rent.\n\nPlaintiff gets nothing, and deserves nothing.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nBurning Down the House -Plaintiff /former tenant Jessica Brown suing defendant/landlord Laura McIntyre for return of her security deposit. Plaintiff and boyfriend were both on lease, as tenants, and plaintiff’s three children moved in also, because landlord didn’t think Jessica could pay the lease by herself.\n\nWhen plaintiff, and children moved in, boyfriend Richard moved in with her. Six days after moving in plaintiff, and boyfriend had an argument, and boyfriend, Richard, burned the house down deliberately. The lease says any fire or other event caused by tenant is responsibility of tenant.\n\nPlaintiff submits another lease, signed only by plaintiff, and landlady. There is a valid lease with both plaintiffs dated 9 January, then another lease on 13 January with only Jessica on it. Landlady says the second lease was to help plaintiff get custody of her three children. Second lease isn’t valid, because first lease was in force.\n\nPlaintiff claims boyfriend only signed lease, but wasn’t to move in, so unless there is an agreement to remove boyfriend’s name from lease, second lease with only Jessica’s name on it isn’t valid.\n\nOn 15 January plaintiff and boyfriend got the keys, boyfriend moved his stuff in, and Jessica and Richard argued about him moving in. Then, boyfriend called police on Jessica.\n\nFirst lease with plaintiff and Richard signatures on it is valid, and second only with plaintiff’s name was invalid, because the first lease rented the property. Plaintiff and Richard were only dating for four months.\n\nFormer landlord is counter suing former tenant for an insurance deductible, and loss of profits.\n\nDefendant’s home was thoroughly destroyed after purchasing and renovating the house, and then the fire destroyed it. There is an arrest warrant for boyfriend, but he hasn’t been arrested. Plaintiff claims she told defendant about boyfriend’s criminal record, and so boyfriend’s arson was predictable.\n\nDefendant received $51,000 from her insurance company. Counter suit is for insurance deductible. Defendant didn’t get anything, or it wasn’t mentioned, but keeps the plaintiff’s security deposit, and other payments.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed.\n\nShort Sale Showdown -Plaintiff/ex-wife Dawn Feibel is suing defendant/ex-husband Edward Tinnivliogliu for profits from their former home after a divorce. The couple had three children, plaintiff took over the home, but didn’t refinance the home in 36 months, which was required in the divorce settlement.\n\nWhen home was sold, profits were split, and plaintiff wants defendant’s money. (This happened in Maryland). Why was this filed in Small Claims, instead of Family Court in Maryland? This has been going on for three years.\n\nJJ sends case back to local family court (in Maryland this is district court), again.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nDad Left in the Dark-Plaintiffs Annie Lindekugel (mother) and Austin Coppleman (son) are, suing defendant’s sister's ex-husband David Chakua, and Kiara Davis (her sister) for child care costs, and travel costs for the kids. Plaintiffs had custody of sister's kids, and lived in Minnesota. Defendant ex-husband lives in North Dakota, and defendant woman now lives in Texas. Defendant sister, is mother of the kids, and lived in Texas, and CPS was involved. Sister /plaintiff took custody of children, and paid for the air fare for the kids (ages 11, 9, and 7).\n\nDefendant woman and kids lived in Minnesota, but moved to Texas, a year later. Defendant father didn't see the kids at any time while they lived in Texas. Defendant father was accused of corporal punishment against the oldest daughter, and CPS was involved, and that's when the defendant mother moved to Texas with the kids.\n\nDefendant father lives in Fargo, ND, and kids were in Minnesota, and defendant father wanted custody of the kids. Defendant man called the sister with the kids, and wanted to talk to his kids, and kids didn't want to talk to him. Defendant father goes to court in ND, and gets custody of the three kids (the ones the Texas court stopped all visitation with the defendant father).\n\nPlaintiff paid $700 for airfare for the three kids, who only lived with her for a week, before the father got custody. Defendant father has the two boys in Fargo with the father, and the daughter (the one he assaulted), is in foster care in ND.\n\nHow can any judge in ND, not look at the father's history with the kids, and give this man custody?\n\n$700 to plaintiff for the airfare.\n\nVictim Compensation Funeral-Plaintiff / funeral director Monty Roberts is suing defendant/mother Cheryl Torres (Villa) of deceased son, for funeral costs she still owes. Defendant owes money to funeral director for son's funeral, and is counter suing him to get funeral payment back. The mother's claim to a state crime victim funeral fund was turned down.\n\nThere was the option of a state or county paid pauper's funeral, but mother wanted a better funeral. Funeral director told defendant about the state crime victim's compensation fund. Funeral director told defendant about her funeral cost options. Plaintiff has a signed contract for the funeral, and cemetery. Defendant claims she paid $300 to plaintiff.\n\n(My guess is funeral director suggested the show appearance, and that way he would get money, but it wouldn’t come out of defendant’s pocket).\n\n$5000 to plaintiff.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nAmerican Bully Puppies for Sale-(This is going to be bad, idiot breeder of dog cropped the dogs' ears himself. I wish Byrd would show the plaintiff what ear cropping without anesthetic feels like).\n\nPlaintiffs Soo Choi and boyfriend Sha-Ron Cobb, have been breeding, and then selling Bullies online, and defendant breeds them also, and bought two to breed from plaintiffs. One puppy was $1700, and the second was $1500, with only $100 down, pending income tax refund coming in. Dogs weren't paid off by defendant, Sydney Billips. Defendant has female bullies, and gets a stud, and breeds bullies.\n\nIdiot plaintiff man butchered the dog's ear crop, there's a text that it was his first-time cropping ears. Defendant didn't take either puppy to vet for vet check until two weeks later. One dog started having seizures, and three vets were consulted. Vet reports don't say seizure, but NSAID overdose. Another vet says possible heart murmur.\n\nDefendant says she can't breed the dogs without papers, but American Bullies aren't AKC anyway, just American Bullies organization, and they register anything (it says so). Defendant keeps repeating she only bought the two puppies to add to her breeding lineup, and so she won’t have to pay stud fees, or give pick of litter. I can't tell you how much I loathe everyone in this case. (Girlfriend of plaintiff is saying defendant is shady, and she's running with the loser boyfriend who cuts off ears?)\n\nPlaintiffs get $2500 for puppies, and the paperwork.\n\nPostdated Check Hell-Plaintiff Sylvia Halsey Sydney Billips gave defendant Sydney Billips a post-dated check to buy a car, and said she would tell the dealership not to cash until the date on the check. $1205, was the check, and car only cost $2200. Defendant never paid the money back to plaintiff. Plaintiff went to the bank, stopped payment on the check, and closed the account.\n\nDefendant claims she would find the money, and take that to the car dealership, and get the check back. Then the car dealer cashed the check, and collections came after plaintiff for the $1200. Defendant has the car, and so was credited by the dealership with the $1200.\n\nPlaintiff gets $1200, not $1400 to cover the charges on the post-dated check.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nDog Custody -Plaintiff Stefani Myers suing defendant/ex-boyfriend Ryan Silva over custody of a German Shepherd dog (GSD). Former boyfriend/girlfriend decided to get a dog, then they split Defendant is suing for cell phone cancellation fees, and dog expenses.\n\nThey were together for 5 ½ years, or 2 ½ years, and then got the dog, they split up 3 years later, and defendant has the dog now. Plaintiff wants either the cost put into the dog, or the dog back. Defendant’s $150 to cut plaintiff of the cell phone plan is on defendant.\n\nDog was registered in defendant’s name in 2010. They broke up in 2012. Plaintiff reregistered dog in her name, in 2013. They split custody, until August 2013, and dog has been in defendant’s custody at least 50/50, then only in defendant’s custody. Then, after the final breakup, plaintiff re-registered the dog in her name only.\n\nPlaintiff and defendant’s cases dismissed, and dog stays with defendant.\n\nRoommate Dispute -Plaintiff Aaran Quincey (pronounced Erin) suing defendant Jeremy Arnold for lease breaking fees, unpaid rent. The two signed a joint lease on a home. Defendant didn’t pay rent, and moved out early.\n\nDefendant has a ton of excuses, and all of them are ca-ca. Defendant didn’t pay four months rent, but claims he only failed to pay one month, but sworn statement by plaintiff says he didn’t pay for three months. JJ has to tell defendant witness to sit down, and I am glad I was already sitting down.\n\n$1400+ to plaintiff\n\nIllegal Driver -Plaintiff Laura Bare suing defendant Matthew Piles for wrecking plaintiff’s truck while on a test drive for sale to defendant. As usual, defendant had no license. Defendant also claims the truck steering wheel was loose, and made him lose control. Plaintiff was going to sell the truck to defendant for $1,000, but plaintiff wants impound fees totaling $5,000.\n\nDefendant’s license was suspended for a D.U.I. Defendant keeps swaying and weaving around in court, he’s making me dizzy. Defendant claims it was illegal to impound the vehicle, because he wasn’t the legal owner.\n\nPlaintiff couldn’t afford to get truck out of impound.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed, defendant case dismissed.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nAngry Tenant Break-In? -Plaintiff/former tenant Noemi Camacho is suing defendants/landlords Pamela Hall and Clinton Golden for return of deposit, and rent back. Plaintiff rented a home from defendants, and house needed repair and would be ready by 1 April.\n\nHowever, plaintiff demanded to move in before remodeling was done, but plaintiff claims house wasn’t livable. Plaintiff signed a document that house would be ready by mid-April, but she demanded to move in by April 6 or 7.\n\nPlaintiff admits she signed document about time frame of remodeling. Another twist is plaintiff is on Section 8 for part of the rent, so how can you move in before house passes Section 8 inspection? My understanding is Section 8 inspections must be passed before the tenant can either move into Section 8, or move to another home also under Section 8.\n\nPlaintiff gets the rent refund and deposit $900, because property wasn’t finished by the date it was supposed to be. Defendants claim plaintiff damaged house. Plaintiff claims she never moved in, just had her stuff in the house for a week.\n\nThe back sliding door is shattered, and plaintiff did it. Plaintiff claims locks were changed, and a sheriff’s deputy told her to get in any way she needed to. Defendants deny they changed any locks,\n\nPlaintiff’s deposit, minus door costs of $1560 to defendants for door.\n\nSo, after deducting damages from deposit, $275 to landlords.\n\n$4,000 Tuition Scam? -Plaintiff Harland Kayani suing defendant Carl Woolsoncroft, a loan for college tuition. Defendant needed tuition, so plaintiff claims he gave defendant $4,000, and defendant never repaid him. Defendant claims money was a gift, not a loan.\n\nDefendant only went to Erie Community College for one term, not a year, and only took 4 credits. However, it turns out when defendant was supposed to be enrolled, he wasn’t. Defendant didn’t use money for school, but instead paid off his car note.\n\nDefendant claims in the hall-terview it was a gift, not a loan.\n\nPlaintiff receives $3300.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nRenter Hell! -Plaintiff/former landlord Garey Ledin suing defendant/ former tenant Tami Warborg for damages to his rental home. Plaintiff and former partner bought property, plaintiff ended up with it, but former partner was living in the house, and later with defendant. Former partner moved out, and defendant was still living there. After multiple police reports, plaintiff went to his rental property, and found someone living on the property in a trailer, shady characters living there, and trash everywhere. JJ doesn’t like the plaintiff, and I have never understood why landlords came on this show.\n\nPlaintiff filed to evict defendant, after a call from a police officer about the nuisance problems with the house, and tenants.\n\nDefendant’s daughter lived there, daughter’s boyfriend had a drug problem. Also, defendant had custody of two children from daughter too, but daughter’s boyfriend has the children now. Also, multiple people with drug issues lived in the trailer. The trailer turned out to be stolen property, so it was impounded. Defendant also had multiple vehicles parked all over the property.\n\nThe house pictures show massive amounts of air brushed walls. The house is totally trashed.\n\nDefendant received a stay order, and claims all of the trash was caused by landlord, and people he hired to clean the house up. Plaintiff can’t go to his own house, because of defendant’s friends.\n\n(This case infuriates me every time it's on. The owner of the house isn't getting any rent, won't get any damages, and can't get rid of deadbeat tenant, and her druggie friends. I find it interesting that defendant blames the air brush paint on the grandkids, because there is no way they did that.)\n\nJJ dismisses everything for plaintiff, because he’s “slippery”. No, JJ wasn’t listening. Plaintiff took interior pictures during the week that defendant was out of the house, then when she moved back in after the stay, he can’t access the house.\n\nDefendant is counter claiming for the vehicles that were impounded. However, the list of towed vehicles doesn’t match the vehicles that defendant is claiming for.\n\n$5,000 to defendant for her bogus claims, and nothing to plaintiff.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nBabysitting Scam?! -Plaintiff/babysitter Stephanie Winningham suing defendant/so-called mother Dawnette Sigmon (SSMOF-Sainted Single Mother of Four) for babysitting fees for her four children. Previously, defendant’s mother was paid $700 to $800 a month for babysitting her grandchildren. By the way, defendant’s new job was at a strip club.\n\nDefendant was on a probationary period at the strip club, and state should have paid the plaintiff’s fees. Grandmother was paid $700 to $800 by the state for her monthly babysitting fees. Plaintiff says defendant was paying her $150 a week for the babysitting.\n\nPlaintiff had a previous CPS issue, so defendant put paperwork in plaintiff’s sister’s name on the paperwork to get the state to pay the babysitting fees.\n\nPlaintiff receives $1200.\n\nFather and Son Drama -Plaintiff /father Ray Thomas suing defendant /son Jeffrey Thomas and son’t girlfriend Brandi McGill for not paying rent on a home plaintiff owns.\n\nPlaintiff bought house 32 years ago, and when he moved out, son and girlfriend were renting house. House had $30,000 profit, but had to pay a line of credit, and only netted $3,000 on the house.\n\nWhy did plaintiff agree to come on this show? JJ is going to screw him over.\n\nDefendant lost his job, and stopped paying the mortgage payment. Just because plaintiff refinanced the house, it doesn’t mean he’s not entitled to mortgage / rent from son.\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nEdited January 9, 2022 by CrazyInAlabama\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nPawnshop Payback? -Plaintiff Wendy and Rosalio Magdaleno are suing defendant / pawn shop owner Sheila Christiansen for selling jewelry she pawned without giving her a chance to pay it off. They pawned the jewelry for $2100, and have pawned, and redeemed the same jewelry several times. When the defendant doesn't get the money to redeem the jewelry by the due date, the jewelry is either sold or melted for the gold. This happened in Oregon.\n\nJJ asks if plaintiff has the $2100 to redeem the jewelry? They answer that they don't. Case will be recalled when the plaintiffs have the $2100 in hand.\n\nThen case is recalled, and JJ asks defendant if she has the plaintiffs’ property. Defendant says \"Maybe\". Items were pawned in 2012, and the plaintiffs had three months to redeem the property. The items expired in the first of March, and the letter was sent by defendant saying that the time would expire in 30 days. The letter was sent to the pawn receipt address, which is right off of husband's driver's license. Husband signed the pawn ticket, with the wrong address on it, but it matched his I.D. The letter to plaintiff Rosario's home address matches his driver's license address.\n\nThe wife went in and paid the interest twice, in March, and July, 2013. The jewelry finally expired, and went through the grace period on the end of September 2013, and when they finally came in during October, they were told the pawn was forfeited.\n\nJJ says since the people have dealt with the pawnshop for so long, and if the jewelry hasn't been melted, then JJ says that pawnshop should let them redeem the jewelry. However, pawnshop owner says she's only willing to return the jewelry, if they pay her for everything they've lost because it expired, including guns, bicycles, and other items. They go in, and pay after it expires. They're going to need more than the $2100 for the jewelry.\n\nJJ says to let the people redeem the three tickets only for the jewelry, plus any accumulated interest, and if pawnshop still has the jewelry not melted, then she should call plaintiffs, or the court and say she has the jewelry. Plaintiff will either get nothing, or get a chance to redeem their jewelry. (My guess is if the jewelry wasn't melted before the case, then it certainly was the second the defendant got to a phone).\n\n(In the defendant’s place, I would ban the plaintiffs from the pawnshop).\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nToo Much Vodka -Plaintiff Tyshara Gatling suing defendant Malcom Harris for trashing her belongings during a night of heavy drinking. Both litigants claim the other was very drunk. They bought Peach Ciroc Vodka. Plaintiff claims Malcolm drank half of the huge bottle of vodka, and he admits that. When they went to a club, plaintiff claims defendant was buying more beers with her money, and she left.\n\nPlaintiff says defendant was ranting, and when they arrived home plaintiff claims defendant was yelling at her. Plaintiff claims defendant slapped her, and then broke her TV. TV breaking was ignored by other people in the apartment.\n\nPlaintiff’s sister testifies about the assault by defendant. Sister claims defendant admitted breaking the TV, and a laptop. Defendant claims drunk plaintiff slapped and punched him.\n\nThe two litigants are no longer dating.\n\nPlaintiff $420.\n\nPaternity Test Time -Plaintiff/SSMOO (Sainted Single Mother of One) Kristina Valentine is suing defendant/ex, and possible baby daddy Christopher Graham, over furniture, and three phones. Plaintiff leased the furniture from Aaron’s, and defendant put it in storage. He told plaintiff when he had to close out the storage unit, and plaintiff never picked it up, so it’s gone. As JJ said, why didn’t plaintiff tell Aaron’s where the furniture was, two years ago? Plaintiff didn’t care about the furniture until the collections notice came from Aaron’s.\n\nPlaintiff is in the process of requesting a paternity test from the defendant from the family court. Defendant doesn’t pay child support, and plaintiff never took him to court, or requested a paternity test to establish paternity, and never applied to the court to get support.\n\nPlaintiff already paid furniture off, and now has no claim. Claim dismissed.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nDon't Fence Me In - Plaintiff Michael Jackson is suing defendants, Ken and Jull Kaufman, for cost to replace fence after he says defendants ruined his fence, and tree trimming.\n\nPlaintiff Michael Jackson owns the fence on his property (not a joint fence) between his house, and defendants' yard. He also trimmed overhanging branches from defendants’ tree hanging over his fence line.\n\nDefendants piled tires and junk against the fence until the fence broke, when plaintiff wanted replacement costs, the defendants told him to stuff it. Then they piled the junk against their front gate to keep their dogs in, so they still have a yard with lots of trash and tires.\n\nDefendants also wanted plaintiff to pay for the branches they trimmed on their property, from plaintiff's tree (dismissed). If someone’s tree is hanging over your property, you have the right to trim the branches, but it’s at your own expense.\n\nJJ says since fence is old, defendants don't have to pitch in on fence. I disagree, because if the trash was leaning against the plaintiff’s fence for years, then the defendants did wreck his fence. This fence stuff has been going on for over six years! Too bad no one moved away from the neighbors. Defendant tries to tell the entire history of their disputes with plaintiff, and I side with the plaintiff. Wonder how much wildlife is living in the trashy yard of the defendants?\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nSister, I Don't Believe You- Plaintiff/sister Sarah Maher suing defendant/sister Nada Maher for cost to repair her car, defendant counter claim is for payments she made on car. Defendant claims because of bad credit plaintiff either co-signed or registered car in her name, and defendant drove car for two years. Then, plaintiff claims she told defendant she needed the car back, and defendant wrecked the car.\n\nJJ thinks both litigants are lying and just here for the money, and I agree. Supposedly plaintiff co-signed, and car was in plaintiff's name, but defendant drove it and made payments for two years. However, defendant didn't have insurance.\n\nPlaintiff says after defendant wrecked the car\n\nCases dismissed. JJ told them to go back to where they came from and sue there.\n\nMess or No Mess- Plaintiff Chrystina Walker is suing defendant/ former landlady Geri Zollicoffer for return of security deposit ($200), but wants $5,000. Rent was $650, so she still owes $450 for last month. Landlady wants damages.\n\n$450 for defendant, nothing for plaintiff.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nT-Boned at a Stop Light- Plaintiff /ex-girlfriend Cari Braun, and her mother, Christine Cass, suing defendant/ex-boyfriend Ian Rosson for half of a car damage settlement, after he had an accident, and after plaintiff wouldn't put car in his name (defendant paid for the car). As JJ says, sign car to defendant, go to DMV, and they will send him a new title.\n\nDefendant was driving, and speeding, blew a stop sign, and t-boned another car. There was no insurance, because defendant stopped paying for insurance, because plaintiff wouldn't put the car in his name. Plaintiff had to pay over $2,000 for car damages, because of the insurance, and title issues.\n\nSadly, the litigants have a kid together, and defendant isn't paying child support either. $2050 was plaintiff's half, but defendant hasn't paid his half yet. Defendant is a total sad sack, just as JJ says. Insurance charge is already in collections. Defendant doesn't want to pay, because plaintiff didn't transfer car to man's name, and he would have had insurance. Plaintiff agreed with insurance company to pay $2050, and defendant would pay $2050, but hasn’t paid. Defendant is paying off the other driver’s damages.\n\nIf plaintiff had turned the car over to defendant, then this would all be on defendant, and he would still have had insurance.\n\nJJ fines plaintiff $500, so court pays plaintiff the remaining $1550.\n\nRestrain Me No More- Plaintiff Breanna Anstine and defendant /uncle Jorge ‘George’ Rosas moved in together, and plaintiff is suing for lease breaking fee. Then defendant’s girlfriend, Lenasia Rosas wife, moved in, and plaintiff got a protective order against both defendants.\n\nApartment residents were plaintiff, defendant and wife, plaintiff's boyfriend was there often, and both grandmothers.\n\nUncle moved out after protective order, and niece/plaintiff wants money for uncle abandoning the lease. Apparently, plaintiff and uncle's wife knew each other from high school or something, and don't get along. $500 to plaintiff to repay a car deductible defendant uncle owes plaintiff. Plaintiff wants lost wages, dismissed.\n\nPlaintiff moved out of the house already, and the $500 is all she's getting.\n\nEdited January 6, 2022 by CrazyInAlabama\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nGirl Fight -Plaintiff/former roommate Isabel Christensen suing defendant/former roommate Amanda Bahr for return or value of destroyed property, medical bills for an assault, and filing a false restraining order. Harold Maxwell is defendant witness and another roommate, and boyfriend of Amanda.\n\nAmanda and Isabel were on the lease, not Harold. However, Harold lived there, and they are staying in the apartment. Isabel is moving out, and arranged that with the landlord. Harold will sign on the lease with his girlfriend, Amanda. Isabel claims defendant threw the pillow Isabel’s mother died on.\n\nEverything dismissed. Plaintiff told to take a marshal, get her stuff tomorrow when she moves out (they’re all from pretty close to the court location).\n\nWho Scammed Who? -Plaintiff Patience Kofa suing defendant Edwin Lohr for the money from a subwoofer plaintiff sold defendant over the internet. Plaintiff sold this as a third-party seller on Amazon, who returned defendant’s payment, and defendant will have to return the subwoofer to plaintiff.\n\nSubwoofer back to plaintiff, defendant already has his money back.\n\nPlaintiff wants the money back, not the subwoofer, she’s getting the subwoofer back.\n\nCar Blow Up! (2014) – Plaintiffs Keith and Alice Kelly suing car seller/defendants Raven Seals, and brother Joe Dodd over a car plaintiffs bought from defendant. Plaintiffs claim car blew up on the way to the mechanic’s shop.\n\nPlaintiffs paid $3600 for the car, no test drive, no paperwork. However, Joe Dodd, defendant says he left the bill of sale at home (apparently, he thought he was coming to the beach today).\n\nInstead of taking the car back to defendants, the plaintiffs took the car to the mechanic, and paid the mechanic for repairs.\n\nA week later the plaintiffs paid to repair the car, and treating it as your own means you've completed the sale. Therefore, the \"As Is\" rule, and the completed contract sink the chances of any refund.\n\nPlaintiffs spent over $4500 on repairs.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nFake Doctor? -Plaintiff Kristina English suing defendant/Chiropractor Dr. Barry Schleider, for selling her a series of treatments for $5,000, plaintiff claims it was to cover lifetime chiropractic services. Plaintiff claims defendant is a fraud, and she should get her money back. Plaintiff was having back pain, and after a lot of treatment she still has back pain, and wants every penny back.\n\nPlaintiff will only get her money back if defendant refused to treat her. Plaintiff had a mountain bike accident about 18 months before the treatments started. Plaintiff went to four or five Chiropractors or doctors before going to defendant. Defendant was the only person who offered a diagnosis, and a treatment plan.\n\nThe lifetime treatment plan, with a couple of visits a week, would cost $5,000, until the back pain was gone. Plaintiff paid the $5,000, and went two or so times a week, after six weeks she was taken off of decompression, and she then wanted her money back. Plaintiff claims other medical professionals said she didn’t have a ‘crunched’ vertebrae, but they aren’t here to testify.\n\nPlaintiff witness, another Chiropractor, only saw a photocopy of the X-rays, and isn’t certified as an expert witness. Dr. Carol Soloway testifies, and she’s a plaintiff witness who was a chiropractic reviewer for an insurance company, and not an independent witness. The witness is testifying based on a bad photocopy of x-rays, about decompression plans, and treatments.\n\nHowever, this is a contract case, not a medical case. Defendant shows plaintiff had 42 office visits, which comes out to $119 per visit. There is nothing written guaranteeing the plaintiff will be healed, and pain free.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed. Defendant says that if plaintiff returns to his office that he will treat her.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nHair Salon Rip-Off-Plaintiff/salon landlord, and building owner John Thorpe is suing former hair salon tenant that didn't pay her rent, and claims she stole furniture also. Defendant LaTanya Rice claims plaintiff told her she could refurbish, and keep the old salon furniture. What kind of salon rents for $450 a month? As usual, defendant has no proof she paid the rent. Plaintiff says defendant paid less than half of the time. $2200 in rent is owed by defendant.\n\nSalon furniture is next, but since furniture was used, plaintiff gets nothing for the furniture. The plaintiff's wife's mother owned the building for years, and equipped the salon, and then rented it out. Plaintiffs inherited the building, and the furnishings.\n\n(My view is salon chairs, even old ones, are very expensive. The mother purchased them, and the plaintiff inherited them, but that doesn't make all of the equipment worthless. If the plaintiff intended to rent a furnished salon again, he would have had to spend many thousands to replace the equipment).\n\nPlaintiff gets $2200 in unpaid rent, not furniture. I agree with plaintiff’s wife, the first month of late rent should have resulted in eviction.\n\nCousins Go Dutch on Rent-Plaintiff Isaiah Moore allowed his cousin and her two kids/defendant April White-Lee to move in to his place, but she never paid her $200 a month rent. They were first going to pay alternate months, but only plaintiff paid all of the rent. Plaintiff claims defendant took his clothes, but defendant says she returned his stuff. Plaintiff says he put rims on her car ($440 worth), and one day they were gone, replaced by cheapies.\n\nCase dismissed for lack of anything to care about.\n\nFriends' Fallout-Plaintiff Heather Swinnor suing defendant/former friend, Elizabeth Pate for unpaid loan to fix up an RV, $1500. Defendant's RV needed work, so plaintiff loaned her money. Plaintiff has a spare set of keys to RV, and defendant wants money to change the locks, not happening. Defendant has PTSD from an accident, and wants money for harassment, not happening.\n\nI don't think plaintiff had money awarded, but it was so boring, and an obvious money grab by defendant, that I'm not sure.\n\nCase was dismissed.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nMean Girl Cat Fight?!- Plaintiff Yioconda Vera (Daughter Makaila) suing defendant Bridgette Farr (daughter Brittany)after their daughters were in another fight at school. The two combatants stopped being friends in second grade, because defendant kid was being mean, and seems to be proud of that. There have been other physical fights at school too.\n\nThen, there was another fight between the same kids, and plaintiff claims the defendant mother tried to hit her with her car. Defendant counterclaims because plaintiff filed for an order of protection. I think I know where the defendant kid learned her attitude from. School determined defendant child is a bully, and so is her mother.\n\nScorned Renter Takes Revenge?- Plaintiff Octavis Lampkin claims defendant Anndrea Thompson took her deposit, and didn't let her move into her room at a condo, so she gets the deposit back, $250. Defendant witness claims plaintiff vandalized the defendant's car.\n\n$300 for car scratches, so defendant gets $50.\n\n4 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2014)-\n\nWidower Waiter’s Bailout -Plaintiff Minerva Spurlock suing defendant Darrell Abascal for loan for bail that wasn’t repaid. Defendant was on probation for petty theft, for two years. $1060 was the bail amount.\n\nDefendant says he was in a romantic relationship with plaintiff from day one. However, plaintiff denies this allegation, says she lives with her fiance and their child, and says defendant was never at her home.\n\nPlaintiff claims that she was only trying to help defendant cope with emotional issues, after he was widowed. Defendant lost his wife to MS, the same month plaintiff says she was asked to help him.\n\nDefendant claims he had an argument with plaintiff, while they were in bed, and then he got drunk, drove drunk leaving plaintiff’s house at 4 a.m., and was arrested while he was on parole for the theft charge.\n\nPlaintiff says she never had a personal relationship with defendant, never argued with him, and JJ doesn’t believe plaintiff’s story. Defendant says he paid plaintiff $460 on the bail. So, he still owes $600.\n\nPlaintiff claims defendant owes her $800.\n\nDefendant is counter claiming against plaintiff for his late wife’s jewelry. Defendant still claims he lived with plaintiff, and lived with her for months at a time. JJ doesn’t believe the jewelry story defendant told. Plaintiff claims she had to get the police involved to stop delusional defendant from harassing her.\n\n$600 to plaintiff.\n\nColliding Bike Boy -Plaintiff Paul Mancini suing defendant/ mother Shawn Maynard (father), and Melina Herrick (mother) for their son Devin Maynard (age 12) hitting plaintiff’s car with his bicycle.\n\nDevon was going west, turned left when traffic was stopped, and hit plaintiff’s car (Devin says he T-boned the car, but damages are on the driver’s side of the car). Devin claims plaintiff hit him, but JJ says that Devon hit the center of plaintiff’s driver side. Defendant father calls plaintiff greedy.\n\nPlaintiff receives $600.\n\nSecond (2013)-\n\nHoney Delivery Disaster -Plaintiff Konrad Bouffard suing defendant/former honey delivery driver Katharine Dutcher for having two accidents in company car, and taking the car without permission. Defendant drove company car to make honey deliveries. The defendant would meet plaintiff, with the company car, already loaded with honey. Then, defendant bought her own car, and she would meet at the warehouse, and pick up the company car, wrapped in the company advertising. (This happened in Austin, TX). Plaintiff was a 1099, contract employee.\n\nA few months later, defendant had one accident while delivering honey while driving the company car, and sometimes she took the company car home. Defendant admits first accident was hitting a tree. Plaintiff says she wasn’t on site she was assigned to when the first accident happened. Defendant doesn’t remember hitting the tree, until after the second accident. Photos of damage from accident #1 with the tree shows the pickup truck bed passenger side is very dented. Second accident was when defendant went to a wine bar, and then to another location, and had the second accident. So, defendant wasn’t on company business for the second accident in a couple of days. The defendant says she only had an hour’s worth of sleep in 36 hours, and was drinking wine.\n\nMy question is if defendant doesn’t remember a major accident with a tree, was she really driving? Plaintiff withheld a $647 check from defendant. JJ says defendant either hit a tree, or a buffalo.\n\nAccident damage is $2293 minus the $647 owed to defendant, $1646 to plaintiff.\n\nSo, Sue Me, Roomie -Plaintiff Evan Serling suing defendant Gilbert “Petey” Garcia for non-payment of rent and utilities. Plaintiff was renting a house, and defendant rented the bedroom for $750, from plaintiff. Defendant was there for 5 months, and didn’t pay for 3 month’s rent ($2250), and owes $1,000 for his portion of utilities.\n\nDefendant says he told plaintiff he lost his job. Then, defendant moved back to his parents’ home. Defendant claims plaintiff told him not to pay, what he said was not to worry about it. JJ can’t take it when defendant says “like” and \"basically\", “you know” and other filler words, and asks Officer Byrd if she can borrow the Kelly Blue Book to read until defendant finishes his ridiculous statement. Defendant is counter claiming for his TV, and property he left behind at plaintiff’s home.\n\n$3250 to plaintiff.\n\n5 p.m. reruns-\n\nFirst (2017)-\n\nThe Danger of Dog Parks-Plaintiff/Greyhound owner Linda Hagood suing defendant/German Shepherd owner of three GSD dogs, and an old Samoyed, for John Yocum for vet bills resulting from an injury to plaintiff’s Greyhound at a dog park. Plaintiff says defendant's dog bit her dog. Defendant says he thinks injury was from his dog's sharp collar or some other foreign object, and wasn't his fault.\n\nVet report doesn't have a statement, just what procedures they're going to do. Defendant also says Greyhounds have thin skin, and Dr. Google agrees.\n\nJJ agrees that dog parks are a free for all, unless you're taking a vicious animal there, and dogs will be dogs.\n\nCase dismissed\n\nStudy Abroad Misfire-Plaintiff Karalin Henderson suing defendant Stephanie Roberts for not paying for a car lease that defendant took over for plaintiff, when plaintiff moved overseas. Defendant was supposed to pay $290 for nine months, but stopped paying half way through the period.\n\nPlaintiff raised the contract amount after a few months, because of excess mileage, changing the contract, so that voided the contract. A month or so later, plaintiff notified the leasing company to repossess the car.\n\nDefendant is counter claiming for her clothes, her kid's clothes, and other items, and says for a period they were living in the car. Plaintiff bought the car off of the lease, because it was cheaper than paying the overages, and for damages.\n\nCar was repossessed by plaintiff from in front of a homeless shelter (that's a first for me). In hall-terview defendant says she was not given notice about the pending repossession, but she's lying.\n\nPlaintiff case dismissed, and defendant case dismissed.\n\nFriends Don’t Let Friends Borrow Money -Plaintiff Jessica Jolly suing defendant Jennifer Frasier for an unpaid loan. Defendant needed money for a utility deposit, is unemployed, with three children (lives off of her child support, and son's disability checks). As usual, defendant claims it was a gift.\n\nPlaintiff took out a cash advance for $500, plus fees. (Defendant's witnesses should have been booted, for their commentary trying to coach the defendant). (Hall-terview with defendant states that she paid the utility deposit with the loan, and her friend's court fees).\n\nPlaintiff receives $561.\n\nSecond (2016)-\n\nEscape With the Children-Plaintiff Joseph Kirkland suing defendant/ex-girlfriend Jessica Torres (SSMOT-Sainted Single Mother of Four, aged 4, 3, 7 months, and she has a 9 year old by someone else) for stealing his money, and identity theft. Plaintiff claims defendant is an abusive mother. Defendant says s"
