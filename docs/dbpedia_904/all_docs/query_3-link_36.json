        "text": "A BJP leader in Meghalaya has asked the state government to set up a camp to rehabilitate Garo, Khasi and other tribals living in Bangladesh who are victims of the political unrest. In a letter to Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma on Thursday, BJP vice-president Bernard N. Marak requested setting up of a humanitarian camp to support these refugees if they are allowed to enter India.\n\nMarak stressed that these tribal groups should be provided with temporary shelter and support while ensuring that they are deported back to Bangladesh once the situation there improves.\n\nOn the attack on minorities in Bangladesh, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, \"... This issue was addressed by the EAM in his suo moto statement. We are also monitoring the situation, about the status of the minorities. There are also reports that various initiatives have been taken by groups and organizations to ensure the protection and well-being of minorities. I would like to reiterate what EAM said in the Parliament, 'We welcome these steps, but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored'... We also want to make it clear that it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the well-being of all its citizens. We hope for an early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country and for the larger region as a whole...\"\n\nOn Bangladesh situation, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal says, \"... The situation is evolving. It has been reported that this evening there will be a swearing-in of the interim government. Once, those things take place, I would like to emphasise one thing, for the government and the people of India, the interest of the people of Bangladesh is foremost in our minds...\"\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus expressed his gratitude on Thursday to those who lost their lives during the violent protests in Bangladesh that led to the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government. He emphasised that their sacrifices had brought about a \"second independence\" for the nation.\n\nUpon his arrival at the Dhaka airport, Yunus addressed reporters, stating, \"Today is a glorious day for us.\" He further added, \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nYunus urged for the restoration of peace and order following the weeks of unrest that claimed the lives of at least 455 individuals. He called upon the citizens to protect one another, particularly the minorities who were targeted during the violence. \"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he stressed.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country,\" Yunus appealed to the nation.\n\nThe 84-year-old Yunus is expected to be sworn in as the new leader of Bangladesh as early as Thursday evening.\n\nBangladesh’s next leader Muhammad Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip and will take office later in the day, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nYunus landed at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country’s military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by two navy and air force heads.\n\nSome of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. Earlier, they had proposed Yunus as interim leader to the country’s figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nPolice in Greater Hyderabad are on the alert to check the possible arrival of Bangladeshi illegal immigrants following unrest in the neighbouring country.\n\nPolice personnel were thoroughly checking trains arriving from Kolkata to thwart any attempt by Bangladeshis to enter the city.\n\nFollowing an alert sounded by the intelligence agencies, police were checking trains reaching Secunderabad and Nampally railway stations. Police teams were also conducting checks in parts of the city where illegal immigrants from Bangladesh were arrested earlier.\n\nDeputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi said, \"Today we had a meeting of Lok Sabha members of the party in which the LoP Rahul Gandhi was also present. We discussed different issues - be it the Bangladesh issue, regarding China, judgements of the Supreme Court and today's business of the Parliament. It was a positive discussion and he encouraged us all to raise the issues of the people.'\n\nChief Minister Eknath Shinde spoke with foreign minister Jaishankar urging him to help in the safe return of the students and engineers from Maharashtra who are stranded in Bangladesh amid the ongoing unrest.\n\nThe two spoke on Wednesday night, and the chief minister's Office in a press release on Thursday said the foreign minister has assured that all required measures were being taken to help those stuck in the violence-hit Bangladesh to return home.\n\n\"The information along with the location of the students and engineers from Maharashtra who are stuck in Bangladesh has been given to the foreign ministry and chief minister Eknath Shinde has taken up important steps to ensure that they are brought back home with immediate effect. These issues were also discussed with the foreign minister, S Jaishankar who informed that a joint secretary level officer has been appointed for initiating action and bringing back those stranded Indians,\" said the CMO in a release.\n\nThe violence and protests taking place in Bangaldesh have affected the sales of fish in the Howrah fish market to a large extent on Thursday.\n\nAs per information from the officials, fish have not been arriving in large quantities from Bangladesh to the Howrah fish market which has led to the fish traders in Kolkata facing huge losses.\n\nThis has led to the halt of the import and export in the last four to five days. An average loss of crores of rupees has been incurred every day.\n\nThe sale of various fishes including the Hilsa, which is in huge demand, has come to a standstill. Syed Anwar Maqsood, Secretary of the Fish Importer's Association said that for the last month due to the protests, there has been a huge drop in the import and export of the fishes.\n\nMembers of the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will take the oath tonight. Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said on Wednesday that the oath-taking ceremony is likely to be held at 8:00 pm (local time) in the presence of some 400 dignitaries, Daily Star reported.\n\nThe oath-taking ceremony will be held three days after the cabinet was dissolved following the resignation of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nWaker-Uz-Zaman indicated that the interim government might comprise 15 members. However, he did not mention their names and possible tenure of the government. He spoke to reporters at the Army Headquarters on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking about the situation in Bangladesh, 1971 war veteran, Wing Commander Devender Jeet Singh Kler said that the current state of the country is heartbreaking, and a student protest could not take this shape.\n\nHe further said that the mobs are controlling everything in Bangladesh at present, and it is difficult to understand at this point, who they are backed by.\n\n\"The current situation in Bangladesh is heartbreaking. There is no control over anything. There is arson and riots. It's the mobs that are controlling everything. Who these people are backed by, is difficult to understand. A student protest cannot take this shape,\" he told ANI.\n\nHe added that there seems to be a conspiracy behind it (ongoing unrest in Bangladesh).\n\n\"There is a conspiracy behind it... Hindus are being subject to great torture. All this cannot be done by students. The demands of the students were justified and have been met. How will the interim government be formed till this chaos is put to an end? Only the army can put an end to this... Curfew should be imposed by the army...\" he said.\n\nTrade between India and Bangladesh through Petrapole land port in West Bengal, resumed Thursday morning amid tight security, officials said. The two South Asian neighbours' trade came to a halt on August 5 following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh and it partially resumed on Wednesday through several land ports in West Bengal, except Petrapole.\n\nBilateral trade via Petrapole is the highest among all land ports shared with Bangladesh.\n\n\"Trade began from Petrapole since morning. There was a meeting yesterday with stakeholders from both countries to resolve the stalemate,\" an official said, declining to be quoted.\n\nSajedur Rahman, general secretary of the Benapole C&F Staff Association, had said after the meeting on Wednesday evening that trade is expected to resume in the morning on Thursday.\n\nThe Odisha government has stepped up vigil along its 480-kilometer coastline to prevent influx of people from turmoil hit Bangladesh, a senior police officer said. The state is located about 200 kilometres away from the Bangladesh coast.\n\n\"People from Bangladesh used to (illegally) enter Odisha using small boats. According to information received through different channels, it is learnt that many criminal elements have come out of jails during the unrest in Bangladesh. Those elements may try to sneak into India,\" Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order), Sanjay Kumar, said.\n\nThe priority is to check the entry of such people into India, he said.\n\nThe United States has said it is ready to work with the interim government of Bangladesh as the country charts a democratic future for its people. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus is set to take oath in Bangladesh on Thursday.\n\n\"We continue to monitor developments in Bangladesh, and we obviously have seen the appointment of Muhammad Yunus as the leader of an interim government,\" State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh,\" Miller said responding to questions on the fast-moving development in Bangladesh.\n\nUS Congressman Rich McCormick denounced the ongoing unrest in Bangladesh, and said that he is deeply disturbed by the reports of sectarian violence targeting members of the Hindu minority in the country.\n\nMcCormick's remarks come at a time when Bangladesh is facing a fluid political situation with Sheikh Hasina tendering her resignation from her post in the wake of mounting protests on August 5.\n\nThe protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to the quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.\n\nNobel Laureate economist Muhammad Yunus is expected to return to Bangladesh on Thursday, Bangladesh-based Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nYunus will arrive at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on an Emirates flight from Dubai at 2.10 pm, subject to the flight being on time, Dhaka Tribune reported, quoting a statement from Yunus Centre.\n\nYunus' return comes as he is set to take on a significant role as head of the interim government, following a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nNahid Islam, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, said that the oath-taking ceremony for Yunus, proposed as head of the interim government during a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin, will take place the following day, Dhaka Tribune reported."
