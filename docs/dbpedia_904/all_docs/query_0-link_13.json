        "text": "This article focuses on the social and political conditions behind violence against women in Turkey. It shows that despite social developments towards modernisation and women's struggle for freedom, the conflict that the discriminatory discourse and policies of conservative politics created-which aims to pull women back to their traditional domestic sphere-breeds violence against women. Gender Inequality and Political Conservatism Because of its contentious relation with modernisation, Turkey suffers from difficulties in its transformation process. Within ten years, the conflict that 'counter-modernization project' imposed by the conservative government has become quite tangible in social and political realms. The prevalence of violence against women, especially the rise of female homicides, or femicides, as one of the consequences of this conflict, and also the rising societal sensibility for women's struggle make it necessary to analyse violence against women as a social and political issue. At the very heart of violence against women, there is gender inequality that stems from patriarchy, but lives on global capitalism, militarism, neo-conservatism and several dynamics of oppressive state mechanism. Gender roles that treat men and women unequally are based on discrimination against women in health, education, employment, participation in politics and decision-making and property ownership. The biggest problem in sexual healthcare is related to limitations on family planning and restrictions on abortion. Although there is no significant change in the legal framework concerning abortion, most public hospitals do not perform it in the last two years. Lack of privacy of the healthcare database has prevented single women from resorting to hospitals for pregnancy tests, birth control and abortion. Despite the recent progress in terms of gender equality in education, child brides and difficulties in accessing to school, particularly in rural areas, are important indications of inequality. In higher education, 45 per cent of students are women, while 55 per cent are men. Another problem is the contradiction related to the debates on separation of female and male pupils to abandon mixed classrooms, following the increase in religious teachings at the elementary and high schools and the introduction of prayer rooms at public schools. Inequality in employment is overwhelming too. In cities, approximately 20 per cent of women are employed. [2] One out of five women is not allowed to work by her family or husband who believes that she would lose her honour. [3] Another obstacle preventing women from taking part in professional life is high costs of private sector controlled childcare services.\n\nSome general theoretical remarks by way of introduction The society we need is a society that can comprise both difference and equality. Women's daily lives are obviously different than men and the strategies to improve their life has to take this difference into consideration. There is a critical need to place gender based violence within the context of women's structural inequality, as a means of breaking down the distinction between public and private life that operates to exclude the gender-based violence from the human rights agenda. I said we need both difference and equality but this does not mean that we should applaud an uncritical argument of difference. Any blanket deference to culture, to the institution of the family or privacy rights within the family has disastrous consequences for women. The discriminatory and terrible practices such as stoning, genital mutilation, suttee, bride burning, \" honour killings \" , passion killings, rape, domestic violence, etc. are all part and parcel of a universal web of violence against women. These acts are assaults to life, dignity and personal integrity of women and they are all political in the broad sense because they manifest and at the same time reinforce patriarchal values. On the other hand, defining and limiting crimes of \" honour \" or more generally crimes related to religious and cultural practices to minority groups, religious communities and linking them to this or that area (the Middle East, for example) identifies these as \" problematic \" groups or cultures and rests upon a homogenized interpretation of culture. In this approach, a certain culture is assumed to be given, monolithic which uniformly condones such practices, and thereby builds a wall between the (homogenised) members of that culture and those outside it, and constructs the problematized group/culture as a backward \" other \". Often the \" outsiders \" are assumed to be equipped with an ability to criticise whereas the dissent among \" insiders \" is not recognized. This inevitably strengthens the hands of the conservatives within such cultures. What we should aim at is just the opposite: Listening to and hearing the voices of the dissenters in these cultures and forging alliances with them. We also need to stress that • Violenza Contro Le Donne, Uno Studio Interdisciplinare, a cure di Natascia Mattucci, Ines Corti, Aracne Editrice, 2016, pp. 135-163. • states have responsibility for unlawful actions and for failure to provide remedies for unlawful actions. It is clear that failing to provide adequate protection of women's human rights the State assumes responsibility for\n\nViolence should be no more a subject people are hardened to, and solutions must be produced to break this spiral of violence urgently. The fact everyone has to admit is that it is not possible to prevent violence by increasing security measures. We need to develop new perspectives, a new global vision; the governments and oppositions should meet on a common ground for overcoming this disease of our age. Politicians, writers, educators, active NGO’s, think-tanks, universities, in short, every institution and section of society must give priority to ending violence. People can be inspired through the effective use of media that problems can be solved without resorting to violence. Schools can provide focused education in this respect by encouraging good morals and respect for women, explaining that compliance with social rules is essential for a good life, encouraging people to protect the elderly and children, and spreading compassion are just a few examples of measures that can be taken. Let's not forget that violence is a serious problem affecting every aspect of life, and it can also happen to us at the most unexpected moment.\n\nWomen are exposed to many types of violence such as physical, economic and psychological violence all over the world. The women in Turkey also take their shares from this exposure and this problem is extremely painful, threatening and unpreventable. The topic of violence against women is included in literature as the research subject of many disciplines recent years however it is considered as violation of fundamental human rights that manintains its importance but cannot be prevented easily. It is tried to focus on, explain and evaluate the violence against women and femicides, unequal power relations between men and women, status of women in society and the interaction with patriarchal structure in Turkey in this study. This explanation and evaluation is made according to the statistics of gender mainstreaming, violence against women and femicides in Turkey and the reasons of violence against women and femicides. According to this evaluation, the women in Turkey generally exposed to violence by familiar people, especially by their partners and/or other men in the parent. In addition to physical violence, sexual violence is the most common type of violence and the impact of the general perspective of society and public organizations on women and the hierarchical relationship between men and women on violence should be considered in the evaluation of violence fact. The case of femicide is also underwhelming. There is a significant increase in femicides since 2008 until today in Turkey. 'Taking decision by woman for her own life' and 'claiming divorcement' are the most common reasons given by offenders to kill women and these reasons prove that the patriarchal system in Turkey does not consider woman as an individual and subordinates women. The idea of taking decision by woman for her their own lives and claiming for divorcement is perceived as a rebellion to power of men, a disengagement from dominance field of men and a failure of power of men. Men are strong and brave who bring home the bacon, save the honor of family, establish dominance on partner and children and commit violence when required to ensure this dominance and femicide is also included in this violence."
