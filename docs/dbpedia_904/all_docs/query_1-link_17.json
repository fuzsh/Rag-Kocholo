Passing the entrance exam the same year I became a graduate student in the Institute of Theoretical Physics (ITP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, with Prof. Hao Bailin as my advisor. More than 30 years have gone by. I often recall the days I spent at the ITP with great fondness. Classmates have become life-long friends. The lessons we have learned from Prof. Hao about research, scholarship and life continue to influence us today...\n\nSome Components of Philosophical nature Constitutives of Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeiraâs Thought Alguns Elementos de Natureza FilosÃ³fica Constitutivos do Pensamento do Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeira\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRomÃ©lia Mara Alves Souto\n\n2008-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper I endeavor to show the interest shown by Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeira with respect to the production of mathematical knowledge and the ideas underlying the concepts of creativity in mathematics which he used and which permeate the work he supervised. My aim was to organize ideas dispersed throughout the work produced by his pupils, recorded in manuscripts or elaborated as texts and published by Prof. Tourasse in SAPO newsletters. In an attempt to capture his thoughts on Mathematics and Education, I tried to establish connections between documents which, explicitly or not, bear his mark. I believe that the merit of this effort lies in organizing, systematizing and presenting, for the first time, a draft of Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeiraâs mathematical-philosophical thought. Keywords: Mario Tourasse Teixeira. Mathematics History. Mathematics Education. History of Mathematics Education.Neste trabalho procuro mostrar o interesse que o Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeira manifestava em relaÃ§Ã£o ao dinamismo do conhecimento matemÃ¡tico e as idÃ©ias subjacentes ao conceito de criatividade em matemÃ¡tica por ele utilizado e que permeiam todos os trabalhos que orientou. Meu intuito foi organizar idÃ©ias dispersas em vÃ¡rios trabalhos realizados por seus alunos, registradas em alguns manuscritos ou elaboradas em textos publicados pelo Prof. Mario Tourasse, anonimamente, nos boletins do SAPO. Na tentativa de captar seu pensamento sobre MatemÃ¡tica e EducaÃ§Ã£o, busquei estabelecer conexÃµes entre os diversos documentos que, explicitamente ou nÃ£o, guardam seu registro. Acredito que o mÃ©rito desse esforÃ§o reside em organizar, sistematizar e apresentar pela primeira vez, um esboÃ§o do pensamento matemÃ¡tico-filosÃ³fico do Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeira.

The system consists of the following five modules: PROF-DDX is the main module of the system. It calculates the multigroup DDX and stores them on a master PDS file. MCFILEF generates a control file for PROF-DDX, which contains energy group and angle bin structures. SPINPTF prepares an input data file for PROF-DDX by combining the control file with other input data. DDXLIBMK edits a DDX library from the master PDS file for transport calculations. RESENDD performs resonance cross section and Doppler broadening calculations. 2 - Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: The numbers of energy groups and angle bins are less than 150 and 40, respectively\n\nA unique, intuitive, creative, innovative, bold scientist in endless quest of the truth and a giant in high-altitude medicine: Prof. Dr. Gustavo Zubieta-Castillo, \"The Parvatha Guru\" (May 20, 1926-September 17, 2015\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGustavo Zubieta-Calleja\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Professor Gustavo Zubieta-Castillo - The Mountain Guru, Bolivian visionary, loved art and science. He was a word class pioneer and defender of life and medicine at high altitude. In 1964, after his observations of the perfused heart in dogs, he affirmed that the hearts of high-altitude residents are much more resistant to hypoxia than those at sea level. He clarified misconceptions about lung diseases at high altitude, which were improperly termed \"loss of adaptation.\" His original and unique views on what was called chronic mountain sickness (CMS, a term he proposed be discarded and be rather expressed as polyerythrocythemia (as a more precise symptomatic description of multiple pathologies in the hypoxic environment of high altitude. He created the \"triple hypoxia syndrome,\" an essential description to explain the momentary decrease of PaO 2 in polyerythrocythemic patients. His concepts of hypoxia gave rise to the formulation of the high-altitude adaptation formula. On his obituary, legendary respiratory physiologist Prof. John B. West stated, \"He was a remarkable man and our discipline has lost a giant.\" Renowned Environmental scientist Prof. Thuppil Venkatesh, a long-time friend of Prof. Gustavo Sr., stated, \"We lost one of the most valuable and precious personalitiesâ¦ a great loss to the world scientific community.\" Prof. Gustavoâ²s son Prof. Dr. Gustavo Zubieta Calleja is also a renowned pulmonologist like his legendary father and keeping his illustrious fatherâ²s legacy with pride and honor at his \"High Altitude Pulmonary and Pathology Institute,\" La Paz, Bolivia.\n\nPublic Lecture | The long road to the LHC | Prof. Lyn Evans, Dr. Daniel Treille and Prof. Peter Jenni | 9 October\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2014-01-01\n\nâThe long road to the LHCâ by Prof. Lyn Evans, Dr. Daniel Treille and Prof. Peter Jenni.

In the framework of the elaboration of a report on this consultation by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (BFE), the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) had to discuss the safety relevant objections. In addition to its own memorandum, the government of the Canton of Nidwalden entered the expert report 'Assessment of the tectonics of the site region Wellenberg (Ct. NW/OW) with regard to a deep repository for low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes' by Prof. Jon Mosar (University of Fribourg/CH). In his expert report, Mosar concludes that, globally considered, this site should be declared as inappropriate. In the present report, ENSI gives a detailed evaluation of this expert report. In its evaluation, ENSI was supported by the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) that checked Prof. Mosar's statements about the seismicity. SED came up to the conclusion that Prof. Mosar's statements are basically correct. But the allocation of the seismic events to single structural components, as Prof. Mosar did, is not possible because of the large inaccuracies in the localization of the hypocentres. From the SED statements it further comes out that the data set used earlier by the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (NAGRA) is in agreement with the seismic events that have been observed meanwhile. A series of smaller seismic events during the year 2005 in conjunction with strong rain falls in the region, constitutes, however, a notable exception. The strength of such a seismic activity is limited. The expert report by Prof. Mosar is restricted to the aspects of tectonics and seismicity. For a complete evaluation of the aptitude of the site region, all 13 safety technical criteria required by the Sectoral Plan SGT should be evaluated and that was not done in the present expert report\n\nIs Duane retraction syndrome part of the VACTERL association?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAkar S\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Serpil Akar,1 Birsen Gokyigit,1 Isilay Kavadarli,2 Ahmet Demirok11Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus Department, Prof Dr N Resat Belger Beyoglu Education and Research Eye Hospital, Istanbul, 2Department of Ophthalmology, Gaziantep, Kilis State Hospital, Kilis, TurkeyAbstract: We report here a patient with type 1 Duaneâs retraction syndrome and multiple congenital abnormalities as a result of the VACTERL association.

This award underlines also Professor Crutzen`s commitment to the protection of the atmosphere. The atmospheric researcher discovered how sensitively the ozone layer reacts to air pollution. His work, together with that of others, led to the ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. As early as in 1970, Professor Crutzen demonstrated that nitrogen oxides react catalytically with ozone. His think tank provided numerous stimuli for further, intense research on atmospheric chemistry, which triggered a debate on the protection of the thinning ozone layer also among politicians. (orig.)

Oscar was a son of the owner of Vogt and Co. (VoCo), a wire-fabrication company, which could also make exotic wires like tungsten. He received his PhD at ETH ZÃ¼rich with Prof G. Busch, who When his father died in the 1970s, Oscar faced a choice â physics or the family business. He managed both! Every Monday he spent in the Institute, and with his competent technical assistant Kurt Mattenberger, grew large and welldefined single crystals of rare-earth compounds and investigated their magnetic properties. The production of crystals was especially challenging as these compounds melt only near 2000 Â°C, and special tungsten crucibles had to be maintained at g , mentioned that he was the only graduate student not asking for payment.

Methods: A descriptive study was carried out from August 2005 to July 2006, involving a series of 40 postpartum patients admitted to an obstetric intensive therapy unit in IMIP (Instituto Materno Infantil Prof. Fernando Figueira) with diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (complete and partial). Complete HELLP syndrome was defined when all laboratory parameters were present and incomplete when one or more but not all laboratory findings were present. All patients had stable clinical conditions and were evaluated with magnetic resonance of the liver and the main findings were recorded. Results. Average maternal age was 26.8 Â± 6.4 years and gestational age at delivery was 34 Â± 26.8 weeks. The MR imaging was performed between eight and 96 hours after diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (56 Â± 31h). The most frequent findings were ascitis in 20% (n = 8), pleural effusion in 17.5% and hepatic steatosis in 7.5%. The periportal intensity signal was normal in all cases. Cases of liver infarction and sub-capsular or parenchymatous hematoma were not observed. Conclusion: Findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the liver in stable HELLP syndrome postpartum patients were few and unspecific. Severe liver injuries such as parenchymatous or sub-capsular hematoma, entailing life risk were not found. Results do not corroborate the use of magnetic resonance as routine examination for stable patients with HELLP syndrome.

Methods An observational retrospective study was performed at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Recife, Brazil. 103 infants with presumed congenital Zika syndrome. All infants had microcephaly and head computed tomography findings compatible with congenital Zika syndrome. Zika IgM antibody was detected in cerebrospinal fluid samples of 23 infants. In 80 infants, the test was not performed because it was not available at that time. All infants had negative serology for HIV, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis. A complete transthoracic two-dimensional, M-mode, continuous wave and pulsed wave Doppler and color Doppler echocardiographic (PHILIPS HD11XE or HD15) examination was performed on all infants. Results 14/103 (13.5%) echocardiograms were compatible with congenital heart disease: 5 with an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, 8 had a hemodynamically insignificant small apical muscular ventricular septal defect and one infant with dyspnea had a large membranous ventricular septal defect. The echocardiograms considered normal included 45 infants with a persistent foramen ovale and 16 with a minimum patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions Preliminarily this study suggests that congenital Zika syndrome may be associated with an increase prevalence of congenital heart disease. However the types of defects noted were septal defects, a proportion of which would not be hemodynamically significant.

Very \"instructive\" in this regard is the history on the establishment in 1924 (the period of the seizure of power by Fascism) of a \"National School of Dentistry\" at the University of Rome, which was withdrawn after only ten months. The biggest supporter and proponent of the School, Prof. Angelo Chiavaro, after a few years, was \"punished\" with the transfer from the University of Rome to that of Genoa.

The inflammatory (type B) subtype of PSS was recently found to be caused by deleterious mutations in the CDSN gene encoding corneodesmosin, a major component of desmosomal junctions in the uppermost layers of the epidermis. In the present study, we assessed a 10-month-old baby, who presented with generalized superficial peeling of the skin. Using PCR amplification and direct sequencing, we identified the third PSS-associated mutation in CDSN, a homozygous 4Â bp duplication in the second exon of the gene (c.164_167dup GCCT; p.Thr57ProfsX6). These data further support the notion that corneodesmosin deficiency impairs cell-cell adhesion in the upper epidermis, paving the way for an abnormal inflammatory response due to epidermal barrier disruption.\n\nEditorial : Laudation to prof.dr.

Centro de Atencao a Mulher. Unidade de Terapia Intensiva Obstetrica\n\n2008-09-15\n\nObjectives: To describe magnetic resonance (MR) findings in the liver of stable patients with HELLP syndrome in the puerperium. Methods: A descriptive study was carried out from August 2005 to July 2006, involving a series of 40 postpartum patients admitted to an obstetric intensive therapy unit in IMIP (Instituto Materno Infantil Prof. Fernando Figueira) with diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (complete and partial). Complete HELLP syndrome was defined when all laboratory parameters were present and incomplete when one or more but not all laboratory findings were present. All patients had stable clinical conditions and were evaluated with magnetic resonance of the liver and the main findings were recorded. Results. Average maternal age was 26.8 {+-} 6.4 years and gestational age at delivery was 34 {+-} 26.8 weeks. The MR imaging was performed between eight and 96 hours after diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (56 {+-} 31h). The most frequent findings were ascitis in 20% (n = 8), pleural effusion in 17.5% and hepatic steatosis in 7.5%. The periportal intensity signal was normal in all cases. Cases of liver infarction and sub-capsular or parenchymatous hematoma were not observed. Conclusion: Findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the liver in stable HELLP syndrome postpartum patients were few and unspecific. Severe liver injuries such as parenchymatous or sub-capsular hematoma, entailing life risk were not found. Results do not corroborate the use of magnetic resonance as routine examination for stable patients with HELLP syndrome. (author)\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE SKILLS IN UNIVERSITY PROFS.

Screening the pathogenic mutations in a four generation Chinese family with Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1). WS1 was diagnosed in a 4-year-old boy according to the Waardenburg syndrome Consortium criteria. The detailed family history revealed four affected members in the family. Routine clinical, audiological examination, and ophthalmologic evaluation were performed on four affected and 10 healthy members in this family. The genetic analysis was conducted, including the targeted next-generation sequencing of 127 known deafness genes combined with Sanger sequencing, TA clone and bioinformatic analysis. A novel compound heterozygous mutation c.[169_170insC;172_174delAAG] (p.His57ProfsX55) was identified in PAX3, which was co-segregated with WS1 in the Chinese family. This mutation was absent in the unaffected family members and 200 ethnicity-matched controls. The phylogenetic analysis and three-dimensional (3D) modeling of Pax3 protein further confirmed that the novel compound heterozygous mutation was pathogenic.\n\nDiversÃ£o em movimento: um projeto lÃºdico para crianÃ§as hospitalizadas no ServiÃ§o de Oncologia PediÃ¡trica do Instituto Materno Infantil Prof. Fernando Figueira, IMIP Ludotherapy for hospitalized children: a ludotherapy program for hospitalized children in the Pediatrics Oncology Unit of the Instituto Materno Infantil Prof. Fernando Figueira, IMIP\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArli Melo Pedrosa\n\n2007-03-01\n\nFull Text Available O presente trabalho descreve as atividades lÃºdicas desenvolvidas na enfermaria de oncologia pediÃ¡trica do Instituto Materno Infantil Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP, com 60 pacientes portadores de neoplasias malignas, no perÃ­odo de janeiro de 2004 a janeiro de 2005.

Robert Langer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMitragotri, S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTransdermal drug delivery continues to provide an advantageous route of drug administration over injections. While the number of drugs delivered by passive transdermal patches has increased over the years, no macromolecule is currently delivered by the transdermal route. Substantial research efforts have been dedicated by a large number of researchers representing varied disciplines including biology, chemistry, pharmaceutics and engineering to understand, model and overcome the skin's barrier properties. This article focuses on engineering contributions to the field of transdermal drug delivery. The article pays tribute to Prof. Robert Langer, who pioneered the engineering approach towards transdermal drug delivery. Over a period spanning nearly 25 years since his first publication in the field of transdermal drug delivery, Bob Langer has deeply impacted the field by quantitative analysis and innovative engineering. At the same time, he has inspired several generations of engineers by collaborations and mentorship. His scientific insights, innovative technologies, translational efforts and dedicated mentorship have transformed the field. Â© 2013 S.

This is the reason why it is essential within the school adjustment to consider notonly students' academic achievement but also their level of social integration in the classroom, the qualityof their relationship with the teacher, and the level of family involvement in their education. The objectiveof this research is to provide a reliable instrument for measuring a full school adjustment and analyze itsrelationship with two important indicators of psychosocial adjustment, self-concept and attitudes towardauthority. This study involved 87 teachers who assessed the school adjustment of students (N = 2378adolescents using the PROF-A scale. Findings show that this scale consists of four factors, social integration,academic competence, family involvement, and teacher-student relationship, showing significant positivecorrelations with self-concept and positive attitudes toward authority.\n\nMr Bikash Sinha, Director of SAHA & VECC and Prof. Rolf Heuer, Director general of CERN, sign a collaboration agreements between SAHA (Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics), VECC (Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre), India and CERN ISOLDE.\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMaximilien Brice\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMr Bikash Sinha, Director of SAHA & VECC and Prof. Rolf Heuer, Director general of CERN, sign a collaboration agreements between SAHA (Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics), VECC (Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre), India and CERN ISOLDE.\n\nVisit of H.E.

There are few reports of it in South America. The purpose of this article is to communicate the experience in a large pediatric hospital in Argentina. A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with PFAPA between 2002 and 2009 at the Medium Risk Clinic, Prof. Dr. Juan P. Garrahan Pediatrics Hospital, Buenos Aires City. The modified criteria reported by Thomas et al were used for diagnosis. The follow up continued with evaluations during new febrile episodes, clinic check ups and telephone calls. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 2.5 years (range: 0.4-7.5) and the mean lag time from onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 3.2 years (range: 0.4-10.9). Fever episodes lasted for a mean of 4.5 days (range: 2-8), with a mean interval of 23 days (range: 15-30) between the beginning of the attacks. Febrile episodes were treated with methyl prednisone at a dose of 1mg/kg or betamethasone at a dose of 0.15mg/kg in a single dose. With a mean follow up of 2.6 years (range: 0.5-5.9) 13 patients remain with febrile episodes at a mean interval of 4.6 months (range: 1-12). Five patients did not have febrile crisis for more than a year during the study period and they are considered cured; in this group the disease lasted a mean of 4.7 years (1-9.7). PFAPA syndrome is a sporadic, difficult to diagnose, condition. Both methyl-prednisone and betamethasone have shown to be effective in controlling the symptoms during the febrile crisis. The definitive remission of the syndrome may occur in the first years of onset, although in most patients the febrile episodes continue with an increase of free intervals and attenuated symptoms, and full recovery in prepuberty or adolescence with no sequelae.

Firstly, the recently developed FAULTS program (a modification of the DIFFaX program to allow refinement of the diffraction pattern) is used to include different amounts and types of stacking faults in the microstructural description of the material. This approach treats size effects mostly isotropically and assigns most of the anisotropic peak broadening to stacking faults. On the other hand, the FullProf program is also used to perform Rietveld refinement with microstructural models that treat the effects of anisotropic size and hence considers that this is the main contribution to broadening. The simultaneous use of these two approaches allows choosing the most adequate model in each particular case in order to obtain an accurate description of the microstructure of the material.

Selected key references concerning these syndromes were analyzed, together with a PubMed search of the literature from 2000 to 2011. The clinical features common to both conditions and those which are distinct to each syndrome were presented. The new findings on the genetics of the five types of Bartter syndrome and the discrete mutations in Gitelman syndrome were reviewed, together with the diagnostic workup and treatment for each condition. Patients with Bartter syndrome types 1, 2 and 4 present at a younger age than classic Bartter syndrome type 3. They present with symptoms, often quite severe in the neonatal period. Patients with classic Bartter syndrome type 3 present later in life and may be sporadically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The severe, steady-state hypokalemia in Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome may abruptly become life-threatening under certain aggravating conditions. Clinicians need to be cognizant of such renal tubular disorders, and promptly treat at-risk patients.\n\nEstudo clÃ­nico-patolÃ³gico do pilomatrixoma palpebral: experiÃªncia no hospital universitÃ¡rio Prof. Edgard Santos Clinicopathologic study of eyelid pilomatrixoma: the experience of the \"Hospital UniversitÃ¡rio Prof. Edgard Santos\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEduardo Ferrari Marback\n\n2007-06-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVO: Relatar a experiÃªncia com pilomatrixoma palpebral no Hospital UniversitÃ¡rio ProfÂº.

The wave of globalization in Turkey, within a process of economic change in the context of neo liberal policies, urban space has been turned into the most profitable area of investment in the unearned income (economic rent sector. The residential sector has been included in this process quickly and easily through effective and widespread marketing strategies. Over the last two decades of this development, the Ankara-Ãayyolu District has become segregated economically and socially between its upper and upper-middle class residents in the urban context. This segregation is evident in residential areas with high-level physical and spatial quality. On the other hand, in addition to the measurable physical and spatial standards of housing quality, it is also important to find out if the quality of living meets the social and cultural expectations of its residents. Starting from this point of view, we examine residentsâ perceptions of their physical and social environment in our chosen sample area in the Prof. Dr. Ahmet Taner KÄ±ÅlalÄ± Neighborhood, and their demands and awareness of housing quality. The story of this neighborhood, which begins in 1980, at a time when neo liberal policies and the power to form urban space was all-important, is defined here by the residentsâ quality of living and awareness of it. Our results obtained are expected to help guide the creation of liveable housing areas in the future.Keywords: Housing Users, Urban Living Quality, Social Living, Awareness, Ankara- Ãayyolu-Prof. Dr. Ahmet Taner KÄ±ÅlalÄ± Neighborhood.\n\n[Maxillofacial and dental abnormalities in some multiple abnormality syndromes. \"Cri du chat\" syndrome, Wilms' tumor-aniridia syndrome; Sotos syndrome; Goldenhar syndrome].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerio, A; Trucchi, R; Meliota, M\n\n1992-05-01\n\nThe paper describes the maxillo-facial and dental anomalies observed in some chromosome and non-chromosome poly-malformative syndromes (\"Cri du chat\" syndrome; Wilms' tumour; Sotos' syndrome; Goldenhar's syndrome). The Authors emphasise the possibility of diagnosing these multiple deformity syndromes from maxillo-facial alterations in early infancy; anomalous tooth position and structure cal also be successfully treated immediately after the first appearance of teeth. This is a particularly promising field of pediatrics and preventive pediatric medicine.\n\n[Engineering education reform plan created by Prof. Dr. Shimizu and establishment of Nagoya Municipal Science Museum--regarding cooperative education between universities and industries in Japan after the Second World War].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMabuchi, Koichi\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThis paper gives an account of Prof. Dr. Kinji Shimizu, the first president of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and his establishment of Nagoya Municipal Science Museum. After graduating from the Electrical Engineering Department of Kyoto Imperial University in 1923, Shimizu was impressed by the German Museum in Munich during his stay there as a student in 1932. It's the first time that he learned the education in cooperation with industries. Just after the Second World War, he became director general of the Ministry of Education. However, new education system given by the United States focused not on developing practical ability but on gaining the basic knowledge, which is contrary to what he expected. Then, he contributed to the establishment of the Japanese Society for Engineering Education, besides working as the president of Nagoya Institute of Technology in the earlier 1950s. His idea was supported by industries for the economic growth. Throughout his career, Prof. Dr. Shimizu was convinced that practical engineering education would benefit Japan, and wanted to introduce cooperative education between universities and industries, along the lines of the same system in Germany and the United States. With this vision he founded Nagoya Municipal Science Museum in cooperation with local industries and local government as his final achievement. The museum was completed in 1964.\n\nHigh-Tc copper oxide superconductors and related novel materials dedicated to prof K. A. MÃ¼ller on the occasion of his 90th birthday\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKeller, Hugo; Bianconi, Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAuthored by many of the world's leading experts on high-Tc superconductivity, this volume presents a panorama of ongoing research in the field, as well as insights into related multifunctional materials. The contributions cover many different and complementary aspects of the physics and materials challenges, with an emphasis on superconducting materials that have emerged since the discovery of the cuprate superconductors, for example pnictides, MgB2, H2S and other hydrides. Special attention is also paid to interface superconductivity. In addition to superconductors, the volume also addresses materials related to polar and multifunctional ground states, another class of materials that owes its discovery to Prof. MÃ¼ller's ground-breaking research on SrTiO3.\n\nMarfan syndrome masked by Down syndrome?\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nVis, J.C.; Engelen, K. van; Timmermans, J.; Hamel, B.C.J.; Mulder, B.J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDown syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality. A simultaneous occurrence with Marfan syndrome is extremely rare. We present a case of a 28-year-old female with Down syndrome and a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene. The patient showed strikingly few manifestations of Marfan syndrome.\n\nThe developmental trajectory of disruptive behavior in Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and Williams syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRice, Lauren J; Gray, Kylie M; Howlin, Patricia; Taffe, John; Tonge, Bruce J; Einfeld, Stewart L\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the developmental trajectories of verbal aggression, physical aggression, and temper tantrums in four genetic syndrome groups. Participants were part of the Australian Child to Adult Development Study (ACAD), which collected information from a cohort of individuals with an intellectual disability at five time points over 18 years. Data were examined from a total of 248 people with one of the four following syndromes: Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, or Williams syndrome. Changes in behaviors were measured using validated items from the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC). The results indicate that, while verbal aggression shows no evidence of diminishing with age, physical aggression, and temper tantrums decline with age before 19 years for people with Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and William syndrome; and after 19 years for people with Prader-Willi syndrome. These findings offer a somewhat more optimistic outlook for people with an intellectual disability than has previously been suggested. Research is needed to investigate the mechanisms predisposing people with PWS to persistence of temper tantrums and physical aggression into adulthood.
