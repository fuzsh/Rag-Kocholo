Zaman has been affiliated with Gulen.\n\nThe move sparked two days of protests which police dispersed using tear gas and water cannons.\n\nTurkish police fire tear gas for 2nd day after seizing newspaper\n\n\"The secretary general is aware of developments, announced on March 4, regarding court action in relation to the Feza Media Group in Turkey,\" UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters.\n\n\"He is following the situation closely.\"\n\nHe said Ban urged that \"freedoms of expression and assembly are respected in any actions taken.â€¦ Vibrant democracy and economic and social development depend on a flourishing of peaceful opinions and voices, even when they are critical.\"\n\nThe European Union also insisted Turkey heed the call to adhere to fundamental democratic rights and freedom of the press.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said before a migration crisis summit with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Monday that Turkey must \"respect the highest standards when it comes to democracy, rule of law, fundamental freedoms starting from the freedom of expression.\"\n\nThe leaders of France and Belgium also insisted on guarantees for media freedom.\n\nZaman plans to continue publishing as an opposition daily in Germany after the state takeover in its home country, Suleyman Bag, the editor in chief of Zaman Germanyn, said on Monday."
