My aim was to organize ideas dispersed throughout the work produced by his pupils, recorded in manuscripts or elaborated as texts and published by Prof. Tourasse in SAPO newsletters. In an attempt to capture his thoughts on Mathematics and Education, I tried to establish connections between documents which, explicitly or not, bear his mark. I believe that the merit of this effort lies in organizing, systematizing and presenting, for the first time, a draft of Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeiraâs mathematical-philosophical thought. Keywords: Mario Tourasse Teixeira. Mathematics History. Mathematics Education. History of Mathematics Education.Neste trabalho procuro mostrar o interesse que o Prof. Mario Tourasse Teixeira manifestava em relaÃ§Ã£o ao dinamismo do conhecimento matemÃ¡tico e as idÃ©ias subjacentes ao conceito de criatividade em matemÃ¡tica por ele utilizado e que permeiam todos os trabalhos que orientou. Meu intuito foi organizar idÃ©ias dispersas em vÃ¡rios trabalhos realizados por seus alunos, registradas em alguns manuscritos ou elaboradas em textos publicados pelo Prof. Mario Tourasse, anonimamente, nos boletins do SAPO. Na tentativa de captar seu pensamento sobre MatemÃ¡tica e EducaÃ§Ã£o, busquei estabelecer conexÃµes entre os diversos documentos que, explicitamente ou nÃ£o, guardam seu registro.

Princeton U. fabricated a magnetic spectrometer for this experiment, and participated in the commissioning, operation, and analysis of the experiment, for which Prof. McDonald was a co-spokesperson. The experiment demonstrated that an intense positron beam with 80% longitudinal polarization could be generated by conversion of MeVenergy circularly polarized photons in a thin target, which photons were generated by passage of high-energy electrons through a helical undulator. This technique has since been adopted as the baseline for the polarized positron source of the proposed International Linear Collider. Results of the experiment have been published in Physical Review Letters, vol 100, p 210801 (2008) (see attached .pdf file), and a longer paper is in preparation.\n\nProf. Dr. Rer. Nat.

Jan. 2014 Oscar Vogt left us. Born in 1927, he lived a long and fulfilling life. One of us (PW) first met Oscar Vogt and his wife Ditta in 1962, when we both investigated in the Laboratorium fÃ¼r FestkÃ¶rperphysik of ETH ZÃ¼rich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) the magnetic properties of rare-earth compounds. Oscar was a son of the owner of Vogt and Co. (VoCo), a wire-fabrication company, which could also make exotic wires like tungsten. He received his PhD at ETH ZÃ¼rich with Prof G. Busch, who When his father died in the 1970s, Oscar faced a choice â physics or the family business. He managed both! Every Monday he spent in the Institute, and with his competent technical assistant Kurt Mattenberger, grew large and welldefined single crystals of rare-earth compounds and investigated their magnetic properties. The production of crystals was especially challenging as these compounds melt only near 2000 Â°C, and special tungsten crucibles had to be maintained at g , mentioned that he was the only graduate student not asking for payment. He enjoyed interesting hobbies and was much involved in cultural activities. He engaged himself with great enthusiasm, initially in the research of rareearth compounds, and then later in the actinides.We had a long-lasting and fruitful friendship\n\nPROF-DD, Generator of Multigroup Cross-Sections Library DDX for MORSE-DD, ANISN-DD, DOT-DD\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMori, Takamasa; Nakagawa, Masayuki; Ishiguro, Yukio\n\n2002-01-01\n\n1 - Description of program or function: The code system PROF-DD generates a multi-group double-differential cross section library DDX from evaluated data in ENDF/B-IV or ENDF/B-V format. The system consists of the following five modules: PROF-DDX is the main module of the system. It calculates the multigroup DDX and stores them on a master PDS file. MCFILEF generates a control file for PROF-DDX, which contains energy group and angle bin structures. SPINPTF prepares an input data file for PROF-DDX by combining the control file with other input data. DDXLIBMK edits a DDX library from the master PDS file for transport calculations.

In the framework of the elaboration of a report on this consultation by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (BFE), the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) had to discuss the safety relevant objections. In addition to its own memorandum, the government of the Canton of Nidwalden entered the expert report 'Assessment of the tectonics of the site region Wellenberg (Ct. NW/OW) with regard to a deep repository for low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes' by Prof. Jon Mosar (University of Fribourg/CH). In his expert report, Mosar concludes that, globally considered, this site should be declared as inappropriate. In the present report, ENSI gives a detailed evaluation of this expert report. In its evaluation, ENSI was supported by the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) that checked Prof. Mosar's statements about the seismicity. SED came up to the conclusion that Prof. Mosar's statements are basically correct. But the allocation of the seismic events to single structural components, as Prof. Mosar did, is not possible because of the large inaccuracies in the localization of the hypocentres. From the SED statements it further comes out that the data set used earlier by the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (NAGRA) is in agreement with the seismic events that have been observed meanwhile. A series of smaller seismic events during the year 2005 in conjunction with strong rain falls in the region, constitutes, however, a notable exception. The strength of such a seismic activity is limited. The expert report by Prof. Mosar is restricted to the aspects of tectonics and seismicity. For a complete evaluation of the aptitude of the site region, all 13 safety technical criteria required by the Sectoral Plan SGT should be evaluated and that was not done in the present expert report\n\nNSA Profs.

This issue does not herald his retirement or other significant career milestone, but serves as a recognition of the impact his work has had on the field of geochemistry in general. This special issue grew from a symposium in Kirkâs honor (affectionately dubbed âKirkfestâ) at the Geological Society of Americaâs annual meeting in Denver, Colorado, USA, during October 2013. At GSA, 27 talks and 35 posters showed how Kirkâs work has influenced a wide range of current hydrogeochemical research, from geothermal processes to acid mine drainage to geochemical modeling. The breadth of his knowledge and his many contributions to the published literature have left an indelible mark on the field of geochemistry, and this special issue is a tribute to his experience and contributions.\n\nPROF DR FELIX V. lATEGAN: Die Boer se Roer.

This award underlines also Professor Crutzen`s commitment to the protection of the atmosphere. The atmospheric researcher discovered how sensitively the ozone layer reacts to air pollution. His work, together with that of others, led to the ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. As early as in 1970, Professor Crutzen demonstrated that nitrogen oxides react catalytically with ozone. His think tank provided numerous stimuli for further, intense research on atmospheric chemistry, which triggered a debate on the protection of the thinning ozone layer also among politicians. (orig.)

Fountain\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Human alteration of islands has made restoration a key part of conservation management. As islands are restored to their original state, species interactions change and some populations may be impacted. In this study we examine the coxella weevil, (Hadramphus spinipennis Broun and its host-plant Dieffenbachâs speargrass (Aciphylla dieffenbachii Kirk, which are both open habitat specialists with populations on Mangere and Rangatira Islands, Chathams, New Zealand. Both of these islands were heavily impacted by the introduction of livestock; the majority of the forest was removed and the weevil populations declined due to the palatability of their host-plant to livestock. An intensive reforestation program was established on both islands over 50 years ago but the potential impacts of this restoration project on the already endangered H. spinipennis are poorly understood. We combined genetic and population data from 1995 and 2010â2011 to determine the health and status of these species on both islands. There was some genetic variation between the weevil populations on each island but little variation within the species as a whole. The interactions between the weevil and its host-plant populations appear to remain intact on Mangere, despite forest regeneration. A decline in weevils and host-plant on Rangatira does not appear to be caused by canopy regrowth. We recommend that (1 these populations be monitored for ongoing effects of long-term reforestation, (2 the cause of the decline on Rangatira be investigated, and (3 the two populations of weevils be conserved as separate evolutionarily significant units.\n\n11th June 2009-Cyprus-Minister of Education and Culture H.

Robert Langer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMitragotri, S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTransdermal drug delivery continues to provide an advantageous route of drug administration over injections. While the number of drugs delivered by passive transdermal patches has increased over the years, no macromolecule is currently delivered by the transdermal route. Substantial research efforts have been dedicated by a large number of researchers representing varied disciplines including biology, chemistry, pharmaceutics and engineering to understand, model and overcome the skin's barrier properties. This article focuses on engineering contributions to the field of transdermal drug delivery. The article pays tribute to Prof. Robert Langer, who pioneered the engineering approach towards transdermal drug delivery. Over a period spanning nearly 25 years since his first publication in the field of transdermal drug delivery, Bob Langer has deeply impacted the field by quantitative analysis and innovative engineering. At the same time, he has inspired several generations of engineers by collaborations and mentorship. His scientific insights, innovative technologies, translational efforts and dedicated mentorship have transformed the field. Â© 2013 S.

This is the reason why it is essential within the school adjustment to consider notonly students' academic achievement but also their level of social integration in the classroom, the qualityof their relationship with the teacher, and the level of family involvement in their education. The objectiveof this research is to provide a reliable instrument for measuring a full school adjustment and analyze itsrelationship with two important indicators of psychosocial adjustment, self-concept and attitudes towardauthority. This study involved 87 teachers who assessed the school adjustment of students (N = 2378adolescents using the PROF-A scale. Findings show that this scale consists of four factors, social integration,academic competence, family involvement, and teacher-student relationship, showing significant positivecorrelations with self-concept and positive attitudes toward authority.\n\nInterim Report on the Investigation of the Fresh Properties of Synthetic Fiber-Reinforced Concrete for the Richardson Landing Casting Field\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPERFORMING ORGANIZATION NAME(S) AND ADDRESS(ES) 8.

The present technological and scientific challenges are to unravel the relationships between the organization and function of protein complexes at cell, microbial and pathogens surfaces, to understand how these complexes evolve during the bacterial, cellular and pathogen life cycles, and how they respond to environmental changes, chemical stimulants and therapeutics. In particular, elucidating the molecular structure and architecture of human pathogen surfaces is essential to understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis, immune response, physicochemical interactions, environmental resistance and development of countermeasures against bioterrorist agents. The objective of this project was to investigate the architecture, proteomic structure, and function of bacterial spores through a combination of high-resolution in vitro atomic force microscopy (AFM) and AFM-based immunolabeling with threat-specific antibodies. Particular attention in this project was focused on spore forming Bacillus species including the Sterne vaccine strain of Bacillus anthracis and the spore forming near-neighbor of Clostridium botulinum, C. novyi-NT. Bacillus species, including B. anthracis, the causative agent of inhalation anthrax are laboratory models for elucidating spore structure/function. Even though the complete genome sequence is available for B. subtilis, cereus, anthracis and other species, the determination and composition of spore structure/function is not understood. Prof. B. Vogelstein and colleagues at the John Hopkins University have recently developed a breakthrough bacteriolytic therapy for cancer treatment (1). They discovered that intravenously injected Clostridium novyi-NT spores germinate exclusively within the avascular regions of tumors in mice and destroy advanced cancerous lesions.

Firstly, the recently developed FAULTS program (a modification of the DIFFaX program to allow refinement of the diffraction pattern) is used to include different amounts and types of stacking faults in the microstructural description of the material. This approach treats size effects mostly isotropically and assigns most of the anisotropic peak broadening to stacking faults. On the other hand, the FullProf program is also used to perform Rietveld refinement with microstructural models that treat the effects of anisotropic size and hence considers that this is the main contribution to broadening. The simultaneous use of these two approaches allows choosing the most adequate model in each particular case in order to obtain an accurate description of the microstructure of the material.

The aim was to verify, whether the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) in Scenedesmus proceeds according to the classical acetate mevalonate pathway or to an alternative pathway. An alternative pathway for IPP formation has recently been detected in some eubacteria by the group of Prof. M. Rohmer. Some inhibition tests were performed with mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase which yields mevalonic acid. Mevinolin should block the biosynthesis of such isoprenoids which are formed via the acetate mevalonate pathway. Scenedesmus was grown heterotrophically on 13 C-labelled glucose or acetate. After isolation and purification of 13 C-labelled phytol (side chains of chlorophylls), Î²-carotene, lutein, plastoquinone-9 and three sterol compounds, the enrichment of 13 C at different carbon-positions of the labelled compounds was determined. This was achieved by the 13 C-NMR technique in cooperation with Miriam Seemann of the group of Prof. M. Rohmer in Mullhouse/France. (orig.)

The wave of globalization in Turkey, within a process of economic change in the context of neo liberal policies, urban space has been turned into the most profitable area of investment in the unearned income (economic rent sector. The residential sector has been included in this process quickly and easily through effective and widespread marketing strategies. Over the last two decades of this development, the Ankara-Ãayyolu District has become segregated economically and socially between its upper and upper-middle class residents in the urban context. This segregation is evident in residential areas with high-level physical and spatial quality. On the other hand, in addition to the measurable physical and spatial standards of housing quality, it is also important to find out if the quality of living meets the social and cultural expectations of its residents. Starting from this point of view, we examine residentsâ perceptions of their physical and social environment in our chosen sample area in the Prof. Dr. Ahmet Taner KÄ±ÅlalÄ± Neighborhood, and their demands and awareness of housing quality. The story of this neighborhood, which begins in 1980, at a time when neo liberal policies and the power to form urban space was all-important, is defined here by the residentsâ quality of living and awareness of it. Our results obtained are expected to help guide the creation of liveable housing areas in the future.Keywords: Housing Users, Urban Living Quality, Social Living, Awareness, Ankara- Ãayyolu-Prof. Dr. Ahmet Taner KÄ±ÅlalÄ± Neighborhood.\n\n[Engineering education reform plan created by Prof. Dr. Shimizu and establishment of Nagoya Municipal Science Museum--regarding cooperative education between universities and industries in Japan after the Second World War].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMabuchi, Koichi\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThis paper gives an account of Prof. Dr. Kinji Shimizu, the first president of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and his establishment of Nagoya Municipal Science Museum. After graduating from the Electrical Engineering Department of Kyoto Imperial University in 1923, Shimizu was impressed by the German Museum in Munich during his stay there as a student in 1932. It's the first time that he learned the education in cooperation with industries. Just after the Second World War, he became director general of the Ministry of Education. However, new education system given by the United States focused not on developing practical ability but on gaining the basic knowledge, which is contrary to what he expected. Then, he contributed to the establishment of the Japanese Society for Engineering Education, besides working as the president of Nagoya Institute of Technology in the earlier 1950s. His idea was supported by industries for the economic growth. Throughout his career, Prof. Dr. Shimizu was convinced that practical engineering education would benefit Japan, and wanted to introduce cooperative education between universities and industries, along the lines of the same system in Germany and the United States. With this vision he founded Nagoya Municipal Science Museum in cooperation with local industries and local government as his final achievement. The museum was completed in 1964.\n\nHigh-Tc copper oxide superconductors and related novel materials dedicated to prof K. A. MÃ¼ller on the occasion of his 90th birthday\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKeller, Hugo; Bianconi, Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAuthored by many of the world's leading experts on high-Tc superconductivity, this volume presents a panorama of ongoing research in the field, as well as insights into related multifunctional materials. The contributions cover many different and complementary aspects of the physics and materials challenges, with an emphasis on superconducting materials that have emerged since the discovery of the cuprate superconductors, for example pnictides, MgB2, H2S and other hydrides. Special attention is also paid to interface superconductivity. In addition to superconductors, the volume also addresses materials related to polar and multifunctional ground states, another class of materials that owes its discovery to Prof. MÃ¼ller's ground-breaking research on SrTiO3.\n\nAir Force Health Study.

La profusa invocaciÃ³n al compromiso en la antropologÃ­a latinoamerican, habla de lo que quienes lo invocan desean hacer con sus antropologÃ­as, y tambiÃ©n de cÃ³mo este ideal nos ha modelado a los antropÃ³logos. En este artÃ­culo muestro las formas y razones antropolÃ³gicas y especÃ­ficamente argentinas por las cuales la \"antropologÃ­a social\" y el \"compromiso\" se constituyeron recÃ­procamente en el sentido comÃºn de nuestra subdisciplina en la Argentina. un doble posicionamiento-polÃ­tico-universitario y epistemolÃ³gico-de un sector de los antropÃ³logos argentinos que caracterizarÃ© como profÃ©tico.According to Norbert Elias, to qualify research according to its degree of commitment to, or detachment from its objects, is a practical value that intellectuals use in pursuing their job. Current references to commitment (compromiso by Latin American anthropologists, talk about those colleagues' perspectives on anthropology, and also about the ways in which such a notion has modeled them as anthropologists. Here I examine how and why Argentine anthropologists have made of \"social anthropology\" and \"commitment\" the backbone of their discipline in Argentina, both in university politics and in academic work in the 60-70s. I also suggest that anthropological debates on prophets and prophetism may cast some light upon this process.\n\nFrom the Proton Synchroton to the Large Hadron Collider - 50 Years of Nobel Memories in High-Energy Physics\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN.

Tjandra\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This is a preliminary study about Japanese conception of the worldâs language and culture. Prof. Someya Yoshimichi, emeritus professor from Shizuoka Unversity Japan, in an international conferene on Japanese studies held at Universitas Nasional Jakarta on February 2012, has pointed out that the present worldâs language and culture can be divided into two categories. One is Godâs Language and Culture, and the other is Insectâs Language a Culture. According to him, the Godâs Language and Culture is mainly from European and American (Europe, and the Insectâs Laguage and Culture is mainly from Asian especially from Japan and South-east Asia. The writer does not understand why the Japanese takes God and Insect as a pair of contrastive culture. Therefore, the writer collected data from Indonesian indigenous culture, mainly from public beliefs and religions to argue about the Japanese pair of contrastive culture. Â This writing uses qualitative interpretation method (hermeneutics and a method of descriptive analysis to understand Indonesian data, and to present the results of interpretation. For previous studies, the writer took the Japanese and Chinese In-yooron to check the realities of Japanese conception, and also took hipernym and hyponym theory from semantics to check the contrastive meaning of the word God and Insect. In short, the writer sees that God and Insect are not an antonym, and also have no contrastive meaning in any sense of semantics and logics.Â Â\n\nProceedings of RIKEN BNL Research Center Workshop\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSamios, Nicholas P.
