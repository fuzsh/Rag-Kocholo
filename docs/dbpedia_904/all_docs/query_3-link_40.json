The province stretching southwards from the Baroghil Pass in the Hindu Kush covers almost six degrees of latitude; it is mainly a mountainous region. Dera Ismail Khan is one of the hottest places in South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is mild in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is generally very dry; consequently, the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large.\n\nIt’s our prime mission to provide clean water to every individual and to save the air in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from rapid pollution causing from automobile smoke, especially Rickshaws and Buses, industrial emissions, open burning of garbage, house fires, and other particles etc.\n\nThe Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Act-2014 paved new ways for Environment protection in the province."
