        "text": "Ataturk is a person for the future, but this does not contradict his understanding of history. Because he sees history as a progressive process that extends from the past to the future. Ataturk's interest in history was to accelerate history in connection with the ideal of dynamic revolution, not to get stuck in history. Why has Ataturk entrusted his revolution to the youth? The fact that Ataturk entrusted the revolution to the Turkish youth shows the importance he attaches to the youth and his great belief in the future and humanity. Because youth is the future, the one who brings the new, the one who makes progress. Ataturk is the only statesman who has tried to live up to the things he does not know to die in this conflict and has achieved great success in this. \"I made things are interdependent and necessary. Tell me what I will do, not what I did” he meant that the revolutions were not complete. Ataturk was not naive enough to believe he did all the necessary reformations. He knew that their revolutions were inadequate. However, he had entrusted the youth with the most vigorous, most dynamic division of the nation that these deficiencies would be solved by revolutions\n\n\"Let’s look at the explanations and statements made by Mustafa Kemal throughout his life. We can say that some of his theses positively and negatively affected the developing Russian-Turkish relations. But a very important detail should never be forgotten: In the Republic Monument in Taksim Square, right next to Atatürk, we see that Semyon Aralov, the first ambassador of Soviet Russia to Türkiye, is located. The order of Gazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha himself erected this monument. For this reason, we can state that Atatürk left a legacy to the Turkish people not to forget the close friendship and brotherhood established with Russia. Regarding developing countries, Atatürk is an exemplary leader who laid the foundations of the industrial transformation that economically developed Türkiye, an agricultural country as of the first half of the 20th century. The effects of his actions are also strongly felt in the global political processes of the 21st century.\"\n\nEVERY TURK MUST KNOW THAT ATATÜRK IS THE GREATEST TURKIST Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is undoubtedly the most important Turkish nationalist of all times. He has not only been a symbol for his own race, but also a symbol of independence war of people who live in many foreign captivities He says; \"Do not think of me as an extraordinary person. The only thing extraordinary in my birth is that I was born Turkish.” Even though he said, \"Being Turkish is my deepest source of trust, and the most extensive source of pride,\" And united us by saying, \"Lucky are those who say they are Turkish,\" the persecution going on in the country today is being kept alive by those who are ashamed of their Turkishness and stateless Turkish enemies. I have to say that our vow that we've been repeating with great pride and tears in our eyes, shouting our Turkishness since 1933, is unfortunately banned. The same Turkish enemy mentality is removing one of your best quotes, “HOW HAPPY IS THE ONE WHO SAYS I AM A TURK” from the places where it is written, whenever it can and trying to erase it from the memory of our noble nation. Turkism is the name of Turkish Nationalism. If one asks what the Turkism is, who the Turk is, It can be explained as “those who feel themselves Turks, can sacrifice themselves for Turkey, Turkishness and Turkish Union, do beneficial things for Turkey, Turkism and Turkish Unity and endeavor for this purpose, who can shout with his whole existence “how happy am I to say I am Turk” wherever they live, be it Turkey or Antarctica”.\n\nThe tenth chapter of the book focuses on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey and the leader of the War of Independence. ➢ Atatürk was born in 1881 in Thessaloniki, a city that was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time. He was not only a successful military leader but also a visionary thinker. ➢ This chapter delves into various aspects of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's life, including his family background, the educational institutions he attended, the influential teachers who shaped his thinking, and the significant friends who played important roles in his life. ➢ By exploring these elements, the chapter provides insights into the formative experiences and relationships that contributed to making Mustafa Kemal into the iconic figure known as Atatürk. ➢ Through this study, readers gain a deeper understanding of Atatürk's personal and intellectual development, shedding light on the man behind the monumental role he played in Turkey's history"
