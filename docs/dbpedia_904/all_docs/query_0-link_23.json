Electromyography revealed a myopathic pattern. Histochemical studies on quadriceps biopsy specimens showed atrophy of type II fibers and ''ragged-red fibers.'' On electron microscopy these muscle cells were seen to contain an increased amount of glycogen particles and abnormal mitochondria were increased in number and size. It is of interest that abrupt deterioration of neurological findings such as seizures, mental subnormality, speech disturbance and deafness was present in our case. Computed tomographic scanning showed progressive changes of cerebral atrophy, low density of cerebral white matter and basal ganglia calcification, which were well associated with the clinical deterioration. A review of the literature also indicated that some patients with this syndrome showed abrupt neurological deterioration in childhood. Involvement of the central nervous system in this syndrome has to be considered as the cause of sudden deterioration and death in childhood.

That pilot study group consisted of 8 patients in which either preliminary diagnosis or suspicion of Parkinson's disease, parkinsonian syndrome or multiple system atrophy was set. Imaging of the brain with SPET (dual head detector Varicam Elscint) and MRI were performed. The radiopharmaceutic [ 123I ] FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) was administered intravenously in the dose 145 -148 MBq. SPET images were reconstructed by filtered backprojection with the use of Butterworth filter. The images were inspected visually. Images from SPET and MRI were superimposed by means of the workstation Hermes (Nucklear Diagnostic) with designatad regions interest (ROI) in the striatum and occipital cortex in order to assess semiquantitatively the binding of dopamine transporter. In the group of 8 patients evaluated with the use of [ 123I ]FP-CIT DaTSCAN four had normal results, and four - abnormal. The preliminary diagnosis was sustained in 3/8 of patients (including Parkinson's disease in two patients and multiple system atrophy in one patient). In the remainig 5 patients the preliminary diagnosis was changed, namely: in 2 cases the essential tremor was diagnosed, in 1 case - Parkinson's disease, in 1 case - orthostaic Sky-Drager, and in 1 case - despite the tremor of the upper limbs - results were normal. In all 8 patients the tracer proved to be useful in the confirmation of clinical diagnosis, especially in the differentiation between the essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. In the case of multiple system atrophy the imaging revealed significant loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Such loss was observed also in the cases of Parkinson's disease affecting the posterior parts of the\n\nDepressive syndromes among female caregivers of schizophrenic patients in prof. dr. m. ildrem mental hospital medan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHandi, A.; Husada, M.

SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) is the recently proposed fixed target experiment which will exploit the high-intensity beam of 400 GeV protons from the CERN SPS. In addition to the hidden sector detector, SHiP will be equipped with the Î½_Ï detector, which presumably would be sensitive to dark matter particles. We describe appropriate production and detection channels and estimate SHiPâs sensitivity for a scalar dark matter coupled to the Standard model through the vector mediator\n\nDicty_cDB: SHI867 [Dicty_cDB\n\nLifescience Database Archive (English)\n\nFull Text Available SH (Link to library) SHI867 (Link to dictyBase) - - - Contig-U11503-1 - (Link to Or...iginal site) SHI867F 646 - - - - - - Show SHI867 Library SH (Link to library) Clone ID SHI867 (Link to dicty...Base) Atlas ID - NBRP ID - dictyBase ID - Link to Contig Contig-U11503-1 Original site URL http://dictycdb.b...fsl*iy*YMIRKSNNFSILFAIFLKIVFVVSAPLCPNSTILLNYNILTVYNSSEGC GFNNEPICTSLKDAVSRAFLLISNNSRVCIGIIGNINVTSEQITLGNYCGA...l*lsif--- Frame C: qkkqfsl*iy*YMIRKSNNFSILFAIFLKIVFVVSAPLCPNSTILLNYNILTVYNSSEGC GFNNEPICT\n\nDicty_cDB: SHI777 [Dicty_cDB\n\nLifescience Database Archive (English)\n\nFull Text Available SH (Link to library) SHI777 (Link to dictyBase) - - - Contig-U12085-1 - (Link to Or...iginal site) SHI777F 332 - - - - - - Show SHI777 Library SH (Link to library) Clone ID SHI777 (Link to dicty...Base) Atlas ID - NBRP ID - dictyBase ID - Link to Contig Contig-U12085-1 Original site URL http://dictycdb.b...IKEIIQHAKEYGIRVELEIDMPGHAYSWGIGYPS VLPANFSHSIQCQPSICTNK***ikknk*kk*kniylkikkkx*kk...IKEIIQHAKEYGIRVELEIDMPGHAYSWGIGYPS VLPANFSHSIQCQPSICTNK***ikknk*kk*kniylkikkkx*kk\n\nCivil Engineering for the SHiP facility\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nOsborne, John Andrew\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe enlarged scope of the recently proposed experiment to search for Heavy Neutral Leptons, SPSC-EOI-010, is a general purpose fixed target facility which in the initial phase is aimed at a general Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) as well as tau neutrino physics.

It discusses how the New Woman image was a site of contestation in Republican China, and argues that Shi Zhecunâs short stories contain four basic stereotypes: the enigmatic woman, the estranged wife, the prostitute, and the inhibited woman. Using these narratives of women and how they were perceived by men, Shi Zhecun deconstructed the New Woman image by subverting the various ways modernity was projected onto women.\n\nBrothers or Rivals?

But, the relation at the beginning of Safavid dynasty developed to the extent that concepts such as guardianship in a mixture of ShiÃ¢ÂÂite and Sufi themes made the situation prone to political functions. Imami Shi`ism became official for the first time by Safavids however, their reliance on the support of Turkmen to acquire power urged them to make Sufism superior to Shi`ism. Thus, Ghezelbash people representing Sufism depicted a great kinglike image of the Absent Imam which did not comply with religion and was against the claim of jurists. The perspective did not remain stable after Safavid dynasty was completely established. The idea was in conflict with the interests of the ruling authority, so Safavid rulers turned to Shi`ism from Sufism. The issue not only made Shi`ism and jurists superior to Sufism but also caused Shi`ites confront Sufism for several centuries. The aim of the present article is to investigate the process of peace and conflict between Sufism and Shi`ism during Safavid dynasty.\n\nR and D of tritium technology as SHI (Sumitomo Heavy Industries)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYokogawa, N.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nSumitomo Heavy Industries (SHI) participated in an R and D programme on tritium processing for the first time in 1967 by joining the advanced thermal reactor project. (The thermal reactor is cooled by light water and moderated by heavy water.) From that time SHI has developed various kind of tritium handling technologies. On the basis of cooperation with Sulzer (Sulzer Chemtech Ltd. Switzerland), SHI developed a system for removing waste water for fuel reprocessing plants by water distillation technology. In the field of fusion technology, SHI has developed a hydrogen isotope separation system by cryogenic distillation and thermal diffusion methods, and a tritium storage bed. Fundamental data required for the system design were obtained through the production and operation of the above prototype systems. Recently, SHI has also been taking part in the design and planning of ITER. In the future, along with ITER design, SHI will aim at developing tritium measuring technology.

This is a proposal to measure the expected muon flux in the SHiP experiment by installing a replica of the SHiP target in a 400 GeV/c proton beam at H4. We intend building a spectrometer using the drift tube prototypes that were constructed for OPERA. A muon tagger will be built using RPCs, which will also serve as a module-0 for SHiP. We propose to do this measurement in early 2018. Accumulating $\\\\sim 10^{11}$ 400 GeV/c POT will enable us to make a more realistic design of the muon shield. With some modifications, this setup can also be used to measure the charm cross section (including the cascade production). We intend to test this setup after the measurement of the muon flux.\n\nA SHiP to explore new routes\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nAntonella Del Rosso\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) is a proposed new facility for CERN's SPS accelerator. Its challenging goals include a direct search for hidden non-Standard-Model particles. Predicted by a large number of theoretical models, such particles could have slipped under the radar of the LHC experiments because of their specific features. In its first symposium held at CERN on 2 July, SHiP scientists showed the broader scientific community how they plan to unveil the hidden world. Â Â The SHiP experiment is designed to be installedÂ next to the SPS North Area.Â Powerful accelerators like the LHC allow physicists to explore extensively the primordial phenomena at energy densities equivalent to those that existed just a few moments after the Big Bang. In this way, thanks to the high precision of the LHC experiments, scientists have been able to comprehensively confirm the predictions of the Standard Model (SM), including the existence of a Higgs boson. However, new...\n\nWhy I Am Not SHY: A Reply to Tononi and Cirelli\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcos Gabriel Frank\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In a recent article I reviewed an influential theory of sleep function, the âsynaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY.â According to SHY, sleep renormalizes synapses that are potentiated during prior wakefulness. I concluded that while SHY is a seminal theory with important implications about sleep function and the brain, its underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. In an accompanying article, the authors of SHY responded at length. Their reply is thoughtful and provocative, but unfortunately many of the points I raised were not accurately represented or addressed. In this brief commentary, I attempt to clarify some points of confusion. I also explain why any theory of sleep function is incomplete without an understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms.\n\nThe computer-assisted interview In My Shoes can benefit shy preschool children's communication\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSalari, Raziye; Eriksson, Maria; Sarkadi, Anna\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInterviewing children is a cognitively, socially, and emotionally challenging situation, especially for young and shy children. Thus, finding methods that aid rapport and increase these childrenâs communication is important. The present study investigated whether childrenâs verbal and non-verbal communicative behavior developed differently during the rapport phase, depending on whether children were situationally shy or not, and whether the interview was conducted using the computer-assisted interview In My Shoes (IMS) or a Standard verbal interview. The sample consisted of 60 children aged 4 to 5-years-old. The results showed that for the shy children in the IMS group their talkativeness increased and their answer latency decreased including the amount of encouragement the child needed to talk, while no changes were observed for the shy children in the Standard verbal interview group. There were no significant differences in the non-verbal behavior for the shy children regardless of the interview method used. For the non-shy children, overall, the interview method did not affect either the verbal or the non-verbal outcomes. Our findings indicate that IMS can be a useful tool during the rapport-building phase with shy children as it helps these children to improve their verbal communication.

Estornell\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In flowering plants, mature sperm cells are enclosed in pollen grains formed in structures called anthers. Several cell layers surrounding the central sporogenous cells of the anther are essential for directing the developmental processes that lead to meiosis, pollen formation, and the subsequent pollen release. The specification and function of these tissues are regulated by a large number of genetic factors. Additionally, the plant hormone auxin has previously been shown to play important roles in the later phases of anther development. Using the R2D2 auxin sensor system we here show that auxin is sensed also in the early phases of anther cell layer development, suggesting that spatiotemporal regulation of auxin levels is important for early anther morphogenesis. Members of the SHI/STY transcription factor family acting as direct regulators of YUC auxin biosynthesis genes have previously been demonstrated to affect early anther patterning. Using reporter constructs we show that SHI/STY genes are dynamically active throughout anther development and their expression overlaps with those of three additional downstream targets, PAO5, EOD3 and PGL1. Characterization of anthers carrying mutations in five SHI/STY genes clearly suggests that SHI/STY transcription factors affect anther organ identity. In addition, their activity is important to repress periclinal cell divisions as well as premature entrance into programmed cell death and cell wall lignification, which directly influences the timing of anther dehiscence and the pollen viability. The SHI/STY proteins also prevent premature pollen germination suggesting that they may play a role in the induction or maintenance of pollen dormancy.\n\nSensitivity of the SHiP experiment to a light scalar particle mixing with the Higgs\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLanfranchi, Gaia\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis conceptual study shows the ultimate sensitivity of the SHiP experiment for the search of a light scalar particle mixing with the Higgs for a dataset corresponding to 5-years of SHiP operation at a nominal intensity of 4 1013 protons on target per second. The sensitivity as a function of the length of the vessel and of its distance from the target as well as a function of the background contamination is also studied.\n\nInterface reactions between Pd thin films and SiC by thermal annealing and SHI irradiation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNjoroge, E.G., E-mail: eric.njoroge@up.ac.za [Department of Physics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria (South Africa); Theron, C.C.

[Department of Physics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria (South Africa)\n\n2016-03-15\n\nThe solid-state reactions between Pd thin films and 6H-SiC substrates induced by thermal annealing, room temperature swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation and high temperature SHI irradiation have been investigated by in situ and real-time Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). At room temperature, no silicides were detected to have formed in the Pd/SiC samples. Two reaction growth zones were observed in the samples annealed in situ and analysed by real time RBS. The initial reaction growth region led to formation of Pd{sub 3}Si or (Pd{sub 2}Si + Pd{sub 4}Si) as the initial phase(s) to form at a temperature of about 450 Â°C. Thereafter, the reaction zone did not change until a temperature of 640 Â°C was attained where Pd{sub 2}Si was observed to form in the reaction zone. Kinetic analysis of the initial reaction indicates very fast reaction rates of about 1.55 Ã 10{sup 15} at cm{sup â2}/s and the Pd silicide formed grew linear with time. SHI irradiation of the Pd/SiC samples was performed by 167 MeV Xe{sup 26+} ions at room temperature at high fluences of 1.07 Ã 10{sup 14} and 4 Ã 10{sup 14} ions/cm{sup 2} and at 400 Â°C at lower fluences of 5 Ã 10{sup 13} ions/cm{sup 2}. The Pd/SiC interface was analysed by RBS and no SHI induced diffusion was observed for room temperature irradiations. The sample irradiated at 400 Â°C, SHI induced diffusion was observed to occur accompanied with the formation of Pd{sub 4}Si, Pd{sub 9}Si{sub 2} and Pd{sub 5}Si phases which were identified by GIXRD analysis.\n\nExtraction and beam transfer for the SHiP facility\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGoddard, Brennan; Borburgh, Jan; Balhan, Bruno; Le Godec, Gilles; Zerlauth, Markus; Tommasini, Davide; Kain, Verena; Cornelis, Karel; Wenninger, Jorg; Jensen, Lars; Todd, Benjamin; Bauche, Jeremie; Puccio, Bruno\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis document summarises the key feasibility issues associated with the SPS extraction and beam transfer systems required for the SHiP facility.

The SHiP (search for hidden particles) experiment is intended to hunt for new physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting particles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the LHC experiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can be used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton flavour number non-conservation, [Formula: see text] and to search for weakly-interacting sub-GeV dark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the standard model and describe interactions between new particles and four different portals-scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss motivations for different models, manifesting themselves via these interactions, and how they can be probed with the SHiP experiment and present several case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light SUSY and composite particles at SHiP are also discussed. We demonstrate that the SHiP experiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly probe a number of solutions of beyond the standard model puzzles, such as neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inflation.\n\nMy days as a student of Prof. Hao (1982-1986)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDing, Mingzhou\n\nIn 1982 I graduated from Peking University with a bachelor's degree in astrophysics.

In the present work, the effects of swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation on various types of TCOs are presented. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of SHI on TCOs. For the present study, three different types of TCOs are considered, namely, (a) FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide, SnO 2 :F) on a Nippon glass substrate, (b) ITO (indium tin oxide, In 2 O 3 :Sn) coated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on a Corning glass substrate, and (c) ITO on a Corning glass substrate. These films are irradiated with 120 MeV Ag +9 ions at fluences ranging from 3.0 Ã 10 11 ions/cm 2 to 3.0 Ã 10 13 ions/cm 2 . The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties are studied via X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UVâVis absorption spectroscopy and four-probe resistivity measurements, respectively. The ITO-PET electrode is found to exhibit superior conductivity and transmittance properties in comparison with the others after irradiation and, therefore, to be the most suitable for solar cell applications\n\n[A review for a traditional Chinese medical journal Shou Shi Yi Bao].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXiao, Mei-Hua; Sun, Wen-Zhong\n\n2009-06-01\n\nShou Shi Yi Bao was a journal of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) during the period from 1935 to 1937, and was originated by Chen Huan-yun, a TCM physician in Suzhou. It is mainly to transmit the knowledge of TCM and to promote the epidemic prevention capacity of local public. The editorial characteristics and historical value of the journal were explored in initial background, staff writers, editorial policies, contents and the Editor Chen's medical ideas. Shou Shi Yi Bao was supported by many famous TCM physicians, although the journal was originated from the civil society. It was an academic TCM journal with perfect practicability for orientating to the public and highlighting the academic spirit. Chen Huan-yun was a resolute defender of TCM, and had many opinions on clinical practice and lots of scientific suggestions on TCM development. Shou Shi Yi Bao reflected the main characteristics of TCM journals in 1930s. The journal was one of the important documents to study the TCM history during the period of the Republic of China in Jiangsu Province, and it also set a stage for the struggle between TCM and Western medicine at that time. The documentary information of the journal has literature and history values in reflecting the historical process of TCM self-improvement. The success of the journal was due to not only the broken-up sectarian bias and cooperation of the TCM practitioners but also the preponderant geographic and cultural circumstances of Suzhou as well as Chen Huan-yun's profound knowledge in traditional Chinese culture and medicine.\n\nProf. Dr. Rer.

Do these effects still hold true? We examined demographic and social outcomes of children born between 1977 and 1982 in a prospective longitudinal study. We assessed shyness in childhood (age 8), adolescence (age 12-16), young adulthood (age 22-26), and adulthood (age 30-35), and derived three shyness trajectories (i.e., decreasing, increasing, and low-stable). Social and demographic outcomes for shy children who outgrew their shyness (i.e., decreasing trajectory) were indistinguishable from those who were consistently low on shyness measures. However, a shyness trajectory beginning in adolescence and increasing to adulthood was associated with poorer outcomes, similar to previous studies. These findings highlight the importance of multiple assessments in long-term longitudinal studies and the need to consider personality development within a generational context.\n\nEffect of swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation on transparent conducting oxide electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cell applications\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSingh, Hemant Kr.

He was a word class pioneer and defender of life and medicine at high altitude. In 1964, after his observations of the perfused heart in dogs, he affirmed that the hearts of high-altitude residents are much more resistant to hypoxia than those at sea level. He clarified misconceptions about lung diseases at high altitude, which were improperly termed \"loss of adaptation.\" His original and unique views on what was called chronic mountain sickness (CMS, a term he proposed be discarded and be rather expressed as polyerythrocythemia (as a more precise symptomatic description of multiple pathologies in the hypoxic environment of high altitude. He created the \"triple hypoxia syndrome,\" an essential description to explain the momentary decrease of PaO 2 in polyerythrocythemic patients. His concepts of hypoxia gave rise to the formulation of the high-altitude adaptation formula. On his obituary, legendary respiratory physiologist Prof. John B.

Physiological characteristics, hematological and plasma biochemistry profiles, are useful references for clinical management in animals, especially when animals are during the convalescence period. In this study, these factors associated with sea turtle surviving were analyzed. The blood samples were collected when sea turtles remained alive, and then animals were followed up for surviving status. The results indicated that significantly negative correlation was found between buoyancy disorders (BD and sea turtle surviving (p < 0.05. Furthermore, non-surviving sea turtles had significantly higher levels of aspartate aminotranspherase (AST, creatinine kinase (CK, creatinine and uric acid (UA than surviving sea turtles (all p < 0.05. After further analysis by multiple logistic regression model, only factors of BD, creatinine and UA were included in the equation for calculating summarized health index (SHI for each individual. Through evaluation by receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve, the result indicated that the area under curve was 0.920 Â± 0.037, and a cut-off SHI value of 2.5244 showed 80.0% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity in predicting survival. Therefore, the developed SHI could be a useful index to evaluate health status of sea turtles and to improve veterinary care at rehabilitation facilities.\n\nDo temperamentally shy children process emotion differently than nonshy children? Behavioral, psychophysiological, and gender differences in reticent preschoolers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTheall-Honey, Laura A; Schmidt, Louis A\n\n2006-04-01\n\nWe examined regional brain electrical activity (EEG), heart rate, and subjective responses at rest and during the presentation of videoclips designed to elicit a range of emotions (e.g., sadness, anger, happiness, fear) among a sample of healthy 4-year-old children selected for temperamental shyness. We found that shy children exhibited significantly greater relative right central EEG activation at rest and during the presentation of the fear-eliciting videoclip than nonshy children. Shy females displayed greater relative right mid-frontal EEG activation during the sad, happy, and fear videoclips than shy males who displayed greater relative left mid-frontal EEG activation. These results (1) suggest that recent frontal EEG activation/emotion models might be gender-specific and (2) appear to provide the first empirical evidence for recent theoretical notions linking the origins and maintenance of temperamental shyness in children to difficulty in regulating fear responses.

In the framework of the elaboration of a report on this consultation by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (BFE), the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) had to discuss the safety relevant objections. In addition to its own memorandum, the government of the Canton of Nidwalden entered the expert report 'Assessment of the tectonics of the site region Wellenberg (Ct. NW/OW) with regard to a deep repository for low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes' by Prof. Jon Mosar (University of Fribourg/CH). In his expert report, Mosar concludes that, globally considered, this site should be declared as inappropriate. In the present report, ENSI gives a detailed evaluation of this expert report. In its evaluation, ENSI was supported by the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) that checked Prof. Mosar's statements about the seismicity. SED came up to the conclusion that Prof. Mosar's statements are basically correct. But the allocation of the seismic events to single structural components, as Prof. Mosar did, is not possible because of the large inaccuracies in the localization of the hypocentres. From the SED statements it further comes out that the data set used earlier by the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (NAGRA) is in agreement with the seismic events that have been observed meanwhile. A series of smaller seismic events during the year 2005 in conjunction with strong rain falls in the region, constitutes, however, a notable exception. The strength of such a seismic activity is limited. The expert report by Prof. Mosar is restricted to the aspects of tectonics and seismicity. For a complete evaluation of the aptitude of the site region, all 13 safety technical criteria required by the Sectoral Plan SGT should be evaluated and that was not done in the present expert report\n\nCharacteristic MRI findings in multiple system atrophy: comparison of the three subtypes\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNaka, H.; Ohshita, T.; Murata, Y.; Imon, Y.; Mimori, Y.; Nakamura, S. [Department of Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Hiroshima (Japan)\n\n2002-03-01\n\nWe reviewed MRI findings in 29 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA) to see whether there were common and or less common neuroradiological findings in the various clinical subtypes. We divided the patients into three clinical subtypes according to initial and predominant symptoms: 14 with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), eight with the Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS) and seven with striatonigral degeneration (SND). The patients showed atrophy of the brain stem and cerebellum, high signal on T2-weighted images of the base of the pons and middle cerebellar peduncles, high and low signal on T2-weighted images of the putamen and atrophy of frontal and parietal lobes. The degree of atrophy of the middle cerebellar peduncle and cerebellum was greater in OPCA patients and a high-signal lateral rim to the putamen more frequent in SND. However, all findings were observed in all subtypes, and the degrees of atrophy of the putamen and pons and the frequency of high signal in the base of the pons were similar in the subtypes. We also found atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres, especially the frontal and parietal lobes, but its degree was not significantly different in the various subtypes. Our findings suggest that, although MSA can be divided clinically into three subtypes, most of the features on MRI are common and overlap in the subtypes, independently of the clinical presentation.

In all the spinocerebellar degenerative disorder s (SCD) cases, CVI values corresponding to the cerebellar atrophy were definitely reduced. On the other hand, PVI values corresponding to the pontine atrophy were only significantly decreased in OPCA group. However, since there were several cases showing only questionable pontine atrpphy, it seems difficult to clearly differentiate individual OPCA cases from other SCD cases on CT films alone. Concerning monoamine metabolites in CSF, it was noted that a significant reduction of HVA and total MHPG was found in the OPCA group. Among them, the patients with overt autonomic failure showed the lowest HVA level and the cases of Menzel type of SCD showed a slight reduction of HVA but an unexpected elevation of free MHPG values. The cases of Parkinson's disease showed a definite reduction of HVA. On the other hand, the cases of PCD group showed no significant difference against controls. 5-HIAA levels were not significantly different among the SCD subgroups.

OPCA was characterized by atrophy of the entire regions of the brainstem and the cerebellum. SND and SDS tended to show atrophy similar in type but lessin extent to OPCA. The common lesions in MSA were atrophy of the pontine base and cerebellum, and dilation of the fourth ventricle. Atrophy of the pontine base was more dominant in the inferior part than in the superior part, and cerebellar atrophy was more dominant in the superior part than in the inferior part, indicating that degeneration of the pontocerebellar pathway proceeds principally along fibers connecting the inferior part of the pons and the superior part of the cerebellum. Dilation of the fourth ventricle indicated atrophy of the middle cerebellar peduncle. In almost all the cases of OPCA and about a half the cases of SND and SDS, the pontine base and the middle cerebellar peduncle appeared as high signal intensity on T 2 weighted image and as low intensity on T 1 , suggesting degeneration and demyelination. In a few cases of OPCA, the dorsolateral part of the putamen were demonstrated as low signal intensity on T 2 weighted image.

The SHiP Technical Proposal has been submitted to the CERN SPS Committee in April 2015. The 400 GeV/c proton beam extracted from the SPS will be dumped on a heavy target with the aim of integ rating $2\\\\times 10^{20}$ proton on target in five years. A detector located downstream of the target, based on a long vacuum tank followed by a spectrometer and particle identification detectors, will allow probing a variety of models with light long-lived exotic particles and masses below a few GeV/c$^2$. The main focus will be the physics of the so-called Hidden Portals, i.e. search for Dark Photons, Light scalars and pseudo-scalars, and Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNL). The sensitivity to HNL will allow for the first time to probe, in the mass range between the kaon and the charm meson mass, a coupling range for which Baryogenesis and active neutrino masses could also be explained...\n\nOverexpression of the AtSHI gene in poinsettia, Euphorbia pulcherrima, results in compact plants\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nIslam, M.

Since BS-SHI-4M cells react with sera from various individual cancer patients at relatively low frequencies (2-9%), as detected by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, cell clones that specifically react with sera from patients with OVC and ML were separated by the panning method in which polystyrene dishes were coated with sera from OVC and ML patients and cells with the corresponding antigens bound to the dishes. Subsequent cloning by limiting dilution provided cell clones highly enriched for OVC- and ML-associated antigens. Karyotype analyses revealed that cell clones with OVC and ML antigens had common marker chromosomes. Interestingly, in cell clones with a strong OVC antigen response, the distal part of the Y chromosome (Yq11) was missing in 100% of the cells. Therefore the cell line BS-SHI-4M appears to be a reservoir of cell clones each of which carries a specific tumor antigen and thus provides a potential tool for rapid serological diagnosis of cancer\n\nWhen people in close relationships are not prepared to listen to emotional disclosures. The role of social constraints in shy peopleâs functioning\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIrena Dzwonkowska\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The following article comprises a presentation of research carried out on a group of 268 adults. The survey aimed at finding answers to questions posed about the meditative role played by social constraints in the relationship between shyness and certain aspects of emotional and social functioning. The results indicate that social constraints are a destructive factor in the everyday functioning of those facing everyday problems. Many shy people experience social constraints - people in close relationships: family, relatives, and friends react inadequately and negatively, demonstrating a lack of empathy, thus discouraging people who are shy from expressing their personal thoughts and emotions. Regression analyses, conducted in order to detect the meditative effects of social constraints, show that their destructive influence is particularly severe in the case of shy people leading to their low self-esteem, a high level of depressive symptoms and a low perception of social support.\n\nNeutrino physics with the SHiP experiment\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAUTHOR|(SzGeCERN)759942\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDespite the Standard Model (SM) has been strongly confirmed by the Higgs discovery, several experimental facts are still not explained. The SHiP experiment (Search for Hidden Particles), a beam dump experiment at CERN, aims at the observation of long lived particles very weakly coupled with ordinary matter. These particles of the GeV mass scale, foreseen in many extensions of the SM, might come from the decay of charmed hadrons produced in the collision of a 400 GeV proton beam on a target. High rates of all the three active neutrinos are also expected. For the first time the properties and the cross section of the Î½Ï will be studied thanks to a detector based on nuclear emulsions, with the micrometric resolution needed to identify the tau lepton produced in neutrino interactions. Measuring the charge of the tau daughters, will enable the first observation of the Î½ ÌÏ and the study of its cross section.\n\nTreatment of Common Cold Patients with the Shi-Cha Capsule: A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Escalation Trial\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChang, Jing; Dong, Shou-Jin; She, Bin; Zhang, Rui-Ming; Meng, Mao-Bin; Xu, Yan-Ling; Wan, Li-Ling; Shi, Ke-Hua; Pan, Jun-Hun; Mao, Bing\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study was designed to determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the Shi-cha capsule, a Chinese herbal formula, in the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold. In our multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, patients with wind-cold type common cold received 0.6âg of Shi-cha capsule plus 0.6âg placebo (group A), 1.2âg of Shi-cha capsule (group B), or 1.2âg placebo (group C), three times daily for 3 days and followed up to 10 days. The primary end point was all symptom duration. The secondary end points were main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, the changes in cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score 4 days after the treatment, as well as adverse events. A total of 377 patients were recruited and 360 met the inclusive criteria; 120 patients constituted each treatment group. Compared with patients in group C, patients in groups A and B had significant improvement in the all symptom duration, main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, as well as change from baseline of cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score at day 4. The symptom durations and scores showed slight superiority of group B over group A, although these differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in adverse events. The Shi-cha capsule is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold. Larger trials are required to fully assess the benefits and safety of this treatment for common cold.

Nevertheless, there are still fundamental phenomena, like the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, deserving an explanation that could come from the discovery of new particles. Searches for new physics with accelerators are performed at the LHC, looking for high massive particles coupled to matter with ordinary strength. A new experiment at CERN meant to search for very weakly coupled particles in the few GeV mass domain has been recently proposed. The existence of such particles, foreseen in different theoretical models beyond the Standard Model, is largely unexplored. A beam dump facility using high intensity 400 GeV protons is a copious source of such unknown particles in the GeV mass range. The beam dump is also a copious source of neutrinos and in particular it is an ideal source of tau neutrinos, the less known particle in the Standard Model. The neutrino detector can also search for dark matter through its scattering off the electrons. We report the physics potential of the SHiP experiment.\n\nSee Religious Influences from Su Shi and John Milton's Memorial Poems%èè½¼ä¸å¼¥å°é¡¿æ¼äº¡è¯ä¸­ä¸åçå®æå½±å\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nLiu Lili; Li Feng\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBased on comparative study between the poetic works of John Milton and Su Shi,this thesis takes the only love sonnet of John Milton Methought l Saw My Late EspouscM Saint(On His Deceased Wife)and Su Shi's first memorial poem Jiangchengzi(Riverside Town)as examples tries to analyze the different religious influences between the two memorial poems.\n\nIn memory Prof. Dr. L.H.K Bleeker | Gemser | HTS Teologiese ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nHTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies.

There might be a whole Hidden Sector (HS) of weakly interacting particles, which cannot be detected in existing high energy experiments. The SHiP experiment (Search for Hidden Particles) requires a high intensity beam dump, which could be realized by a new facility at the CERN SPS accelerator. New superweakly interacting particles with masses below O(10) GeV could be produced in the beam dump and detected in a general purpose Hidden Sector (HS) detector. In addition there will be a dedicated tau neutrino subdetector. I present the major requirements and technical challenges for the HS detector and discuss how the HS can be accessed through several portals: neutrino portal, scalar portal, vector portal and many more.\n\nThe SHiP experiment at CERN SPS\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDi Crescenzoon, A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSHiP is a new general purpose fixed target facility, whose Technical Proposal has been recently submitted to the CERN SPS Committee. In its initial phase, the 400 GeV proton beam extracted from the SPS will be dumped on a heavy target with the aim of integrating 2 Ã 1020 pot in 5 years. A dedicated detector located downstream of the target, based on a long vacuum tank followed by a spectrometer and particle identification detectors, will allow probing a variety of models with light long-lived exotic particles and masses below a few GeV/c2. The beam dump is also an ideal source of tau neutrinos, the less known particle in the Standard Model. Another dedicated detector, based on the Emulsion Cloud Chamber technology already used in the OPERA experiment, will allow to perform for the first time measurements of the tau neutrino deep inelastic scattering cross section. Tau neutrinos will be distinguished from tau anti-neutrinos, thus providing the first observation of the tau anti-neutrino.\n\nPROF. DR. M.

In this paper, based on the Qihai theory, from aspects of Yuan qi , Zong qi , Ying qi and Wei qi and relations among qi , blood and veins in TCM, and cardiac output, sympathetic nerve activity and blood vessels in modern medicine, the understanding on hypertension was explained. As a result, both TCM and modern medicine had consistency in the understanding of hypertension, reflecting the scientificity and practicability of this acupuncture technique. Besides, according to Qihai theory and \"wind leading to vertigo\" theory, academician SHI Xuemin brought forward the key pathogenesis of hypertension was \"dysfunction of Qihai \", and the acupoint selected Renying (ST 9), Quchi (LI 11), Hegu (LI 4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Taichong (LR 3). At the same time, the operation specification of each acupoint was mainly discussed, and the references of acupoint selection was explained based on TCM theory and modern clinical research.\n\nUnderstanding Relations among Children's Shy and Antisocial/Aggressive Behaviors and Mothers' Parenting: The Role of Maternal Beliefs\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEvans, Cortney A.; Nelson, Larry J.; Porter, Christin L.; Nelson, David A.; Hart, Craig H.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study assesses the relationships between children's shy and antisocial/aggressive behaviors and maternal beliefs, and concomitant parenting behaviors.
