Inflation, meanwhile, surged to 16.7 percent in July 2022 (y-o-y) driven by food and energy prices, creating risks for poverty reduction. Annual inflation is expected to reach 11 percent in 2022 compared to 2 percent in 2021.\n\nSecuring Property Rights\n\nThe Real Estate Registration Project is working with land registry and cadastre offices around the country to develop a sustainable real estate registration system. The project is expected to help 1.68 million people across nearly 500 cadastral municipalities."
