        "text": "Turkish police stormed the offices of the country's best-selling opposition newspaper Zaman, one of a handful of remaining outlets critical of the country's leadership, after a court ordered it be placed under the management of government trustees.\n\nThe move by the court, the latest in a country-wide crackdown on media, has raised concerns over the freedom of the press in Turkey.\n\nAfter the ruling, hundreds of people gathered outside the newspaper's offices in Istanbul protesting against the move. Later in the evening, police reportedly fired tear gas to disperse the protesters and attempted to storm the building.\n\nThe newspaper is linked to a U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. The government has intensified a campaign against Gulen and outlets linked to his movement, which the government accuses of attempting to topple it.\n\nShortly after the news broke, protesters had already begun gathering outside the newspaper's headquarters in Istanbul.\n\nA live stream of the situation at the newspaper offices can be seen here:\n\nSomeone hung a banner at the front gates that read, \"Free media can not be silenced.\"\n\nHours later, police had entered the main building and were trying to clear out the journalists and protesters who had gathered there.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nThe newspaper released a statement on Friday afternoon calling the decision, \"the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law.\"\n\n\"Intellectuals, businesspeople, celebrities, civil society organizations (CSOs), media organizations and journalists are being silenced via threats and blackmail,\" the statement read. \"We have entered the last phase in terms of pressure on those who persistently remain independent in their publications. Journalists are now frequenting courts, not their newsrooms.\"\n\nHuman rights groups have denounced the move by the Turkish government.\n\n“By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogan’s government is steamrolling over human rights,” Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s Turkey expert, said in a statement. “A free and independent media, together with the rule of law and independent judiciary, are the cornerstones of internationally guaranteed freedoms which are the right of everyone in Turkey.”\n\nSevgi Akarcesme, the editor-in-chief of the English language version of the newspaper, tweeted an image of the \"last free\" web page cover of Today's Zaman before it is seized by the government.\n\nAkarcesme, speaking outside the Zaman headquarters on Friday, denounced the move by the government to silence the newspaper.\n\n\"As all of you know we are being governed by a regime that has no respect for our constitution, rule of law, or democracy,\" Akarcesme said.\n\nEarlier Friday, police detained four senior officials of a company that is also linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nTurkey's state-run news agency says police have detained four senior officials in the central city of Kayseri. Boydak Holding's chairman, chief executive officer and two board members were arrested on Friday over allegations that the company provided financial support to the movement led by Fethullah Gulen.\n\nGulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, was once President Recep Tayyip Errdogan's ally. The government now accuses his group of plotting to overthrow it. Gulen went on trial in absentia last year over the charges.\n\nThe government has purged civil servants suspected of ties to the movement, seized businesses and closed some media organizations.\n\nThis is just the most recent move by the government against opposition media. Last month, the TV channel IMCTV was taken off air.\n\nLast October, court-appointed administrators took over media outlets within the Koza İpek group in a chaotic crackdown.\n\nAdditional information from the Associated Press.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
