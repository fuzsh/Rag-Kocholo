        "text": "The popular paper, with a circulation of 650,000, has been critical of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nA statement released by Zaman said: \"We have now been threatened with confiscation through the appointment of trustees. We are deeply concerned about all these developments that undermine Turkey's democratic performance.\n\n\"We believe the only way out of this nightmarish atmosphere is to return to democracy and the rule of law. We are publishing our concerns to inform the Turkish nation, intellectuals who believe in democracy and the wider world.\"\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the move was the beginning of the end for critical journalism in the country.\n\nJoel Simon, CPJ executive director, said: “Today’s move by the court paves the way to effectively strangle the remnants of critical journalism in Turkey.\n\n“Zaman and Today’s Zaman play an essential and critical role in informing Turkish society and the world. Rather than taking aggressive action to undermine the newspapers, Turkish authorities should be fulfilling their constitutional obligation to defend press freedom and rights of the journalists.\"\n\nThe paper has also linked to the Hizmet movement of influential self-exiled US preacher Fethullah Gulen.\n\nThe government claims Hizmet is a terrorist group aiming to overthrow the president.\n\nAuthorities have put the cleric, who claims Hizmet promotes peace, on its list of most wanted terrorists.\n\nThe president and Mr Gulen, who has been in Pennsylvania since 2009, were once allies but relations soured when the government began to crackdown on private schools run by the preacher three years ago.\n\nThis week's ruling over Zaman will add to concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey after opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, the newspaper's Ankara bureau chief, were taken into custody in November, accused of spying.\n\nThe pair, who were released a few days ago, ran a front page story in May 2015 accusing Turkey's intelligence agency of sending weapons to Islammist rebel groups in Syria the previous year. They still face life imprisonment when their case goes to court late this month.\n\nIn October 2015, police stormed the offices of Turkish media group Koza Ipek, owners of television channel Kanalturk TV, using chainsaws to hack down the gates to the media compound.\n\nOne TV channel belonging to the company, which also has links to Mr Gulen, was taken off air during live broadcasting."
