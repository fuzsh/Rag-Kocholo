        "text": "Bangladesh's army chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled following a violent uprising against her that killed hundreds.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\nMiscreants attacked, vandalised and set fire to at least six police stations in Chittagong, looting weapons, bullets and various equipment. In addition, Awami League leaders and activists' homes and officers were targeted, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nAfter the report of Sheikh Hasina's resignation, agitated crowds have taken to the streets in celebration. Later, police stations in Chandgaon, Patenga, EPZ, Kotowali, Akbar Shah, and Pahartali under the Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) were attacked, vandalised, and set on fire.\n\nDuring these assaults, police weapons, ammunition, and other equipment were looted. Several police personnel suffered injuries in the attacks, according to a Dhaka Tribune report.\n\nAround 5 pm (local time), attackers tried to breach the main gate of the Chittagong Metropolitan Police Lines in Dampara. In response, police personnel fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the attackers.\n\nAs Bangladesh faced political upheaval, India had to act swiftly to ensure the safety of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as she left her country. Security agencies prepared for all eventualities as Hasina headed towards India in an Air Force jet. Around 3pm, Indian Air Force radars detected a low-flying aircraft approaching the Indian border from Bangladesh.Air defense personnel, aware of the high-profile passenger onboard, allowed the aircraft to enter Indian airspace. To provide security, two Rafale fighter jets from the 101 squadron at Hashimara air base in West Bengal were deployed over Bihar and Jharkhand, according to ANI.\n\nRead more\n\nThe World Bank on Monday said it was assessing the impact of events in Bangladesh on its loan program with the country after its Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled.\n\nHasina's exit came after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against preferential job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.\n\n\"We mourn the violence and tragic loss of life that has taken place in recent weeks in Bangladesh and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution. We are assessing the impact of the unfolding situation on the World Bank Group program and remain committed to supporting the development aspirations of the people of Bangladesh,\" a spokesperson for the bank said.\n\nUK foreign secretary, David Lammy expressed concern regarding the Bangladesh situation and stated that everyone needs to work together to end this violence.\n\nFurther, he also urged for a full and independent investigation, led by the United Nations, into the recent events in Bangladesh.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks,\" said UK Foreign Secretary, David Lammy.\n\nAdditionally, David Lammy has described the situation as unprecedented, highlighting the severity of the crisis.\n\n\"The last two weeks in Bangladesh have seen unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life. A transitional period has been announced by the Chief of the Army Staff,\" said UK foreign secretary, David Lammy.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin said on Monday that an interim government would be formed after dissolving the parliament as he ordered the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who is under house arrest after being convicted in several cases. He made the remarks during a meeting with the leaders of various political parties and civil society representatives at Bangabhaban in the presence of the chief of three forces, the Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo reported.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday urged calm in Bangladesh after the resignation and departure of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and highlighted the need for a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition,\" his spokesman said.\n\nGuterres \"stands in full solidarity with the people of Bangladesh and calls for the full respect of their human rights,\" said the spokesman, Farhan Haq.\n\n\"He continues to underscore the need for a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence.\"\n\nSri Lankan minister of foreign affairs, Ali Sabry expressed his solidarity with the people of Bangladesh amid political unrest.\n\nSabry said that Sri Lanka is there for Bangladesh during these challenging times.\n\nIn a post on X, he said, \"Our hearts are with the people of Bangladesh during these incredibly challenging times. The recent events have led to significant unrest and, tragically, the loss of many lives. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those affected and to all who are suffering during this difficult period. Sri Lanka values its enduring friendship with Bangladesh and stands in solidarity with its people. We believe in the resilience and unity of the Bangladeshi nation and hope for a swift return to peace and stability. May the people of Bangladesh find the strength to overcome these challenges and emerge even stronger. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all, and we look forward to a future filled with peace and prosperity for both our nations.\"\n\nThe hurried and rather unceremonious departure of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh hasn’t just wrong-footed the Indian government but also left it faced with possibly the biggest foreign policy challenge in the neighbourhood in recent times, one which might make the storm in ties with the Maldives this year look like a walk in the park.\n\nSheikh Hasina’s son told the BBC that his mother will not make a political comeback, expressing her profound disappointment that despite her extensive efforts, she faced opposition from a minority.\n\n“She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia. She’s very disappointed,” Sajeeb Wazed Joy said.\n\n“She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia. She’s very disappointed,” he added.\n\nFormer Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is preparing to depart for London after a brief stay in India. She arrived at Hindon Air Base near New Delhi on Monday, according to reports.\n\nDuring her stay, national security advisor Ajit Doval met with Hasina at the airbase, and foreign minister S Jaishankar briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the security situation in Bangladesh. Indian security agencies monitored the C-130 aircraft with the call sign AJAX1431, which carried Hasina and her sister as they fled Bangladesh, as it neared the border.\n\nAt 58, General Waker-Uz-Zaman took on the role of army chief on June 23 for a standard three-year term. Trusted by Prime Minister Hasina due to their distant familial connection, Zaman has a notable background, including serving as a UN peacekeeper and working in Hasina's office. Born in Dhaka in 1966, he has a distinguished military career and continues a family tradition in the Bangladeshi armed forces. He is married to Sarahnaz Kamalika Zaman, the daughter of General Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman, who was army chief from 1997 to 2000 during Hasina's first term.\n\nProtesters set fire to Sudha Sadan in Dhanmondi, Dhaka, today around 5.30pm. The building was vandalized, and a fire was ignited inside. Items were also removed from the house before leaving, reported Prothomo Alo\n\nAccording to news agency AP, protesters forcibly entered Ganabhaban, the official residence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose current whereabouts are unknown amidst the unrest. The demonstrators, waving Bangladesh flags, stormed the gates of the residence. Social media visuals showed them entering rooms, stealing rugs and utensils, and sitting on tables for photographs. They also rummaged through files and documents in the former Prime Minister's house.\n\n\"I appeal to the people of Bengal to maintain peace. Do not pay attention to any kind of rumours. This is a matter between two countries, we will support whatever decision the Central government takes,\" she said,\n\nAccording to Prothomo Alo, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir called for calm among the populace. In a message on Monday, he reported that his meeting with Army chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman had been constructive. Alamgir conveyed that General Zaman had instructed him to share this message with the people.\n\nBangladesh Army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman confirmed that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled the country. In a national address during the ongoing crisis, Zaman appealed to students to remain calm and return home. He also urged citizens to end the violence, stating that there is no need for a curfew or emergency measures. Despite resisting calls to step down for weeks, Hasina fled after a violent day of unrest on Sunday that claimed nearly 100 lives.\n\nLIC announced that its office in Bangladesh will remain closed from August 5 to August 7 due to the ongoing socio-political unrest. Over the past two days, fierce clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters have resulted in over 100 deaths in various parts of Bangladesh, PTI reported.\n\nLIC's regulatory filing stated that the office closure is in response to the curfew imposed by the Bangladeshi government for the same period. The student protests, which began last month over a contentious job quota system, have since escalated into broader anti-government demonstrations.\n\nLIC shares closed at Rs 1,110, marking a 6.10% decline from the previous close on the BSE.\n\nFollowing the resignation and departure of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid ongoing protests, the Border Security Force (BSF) in India has issued a 'high alert' for all units along the 4,096 km India-Bangladesh border. Acting BSF Director General Daljit Singh Chawdhary and other senior officials have arrived in Kolkata to assess border security. The unrest, which has seen nearly 300 casualties, prompted Hasina to resign and flee Dhaka with her sister to seek refuge."
