        "text": "Importance of Tourism Geography for Researching Second Homes and the Development of Second Homes in Turkey Second homes, used for recreational purposes within a limited time period, have begun to differ in their locations, use, qualities and quantities and become the subject of research in many disciplines. The spaces where second homes develop (pulling forces), the spaces where people continually live (cities-pushing forces) and the factors playing a role in the changes and transformations in both spaces and the interface in time draw the attention of discipline of geography and geographers as well. Development and distribution of second homes and the factors influencing their use constitute the basic subject of this research. Ranging from mountain pastures to coastal areas and from coasts to inner regions and even having no connection with the sea or any coast but offering a silent/tranquil atmosphere and scenic resting medium, second homes both result from spatial differences and themselves form new spaces & geographical landscapes. The dynamics creating spatial differences concerning second homes are related to geography and tourism, and the research will be constructed on this assumption. In the research, various scientific data and publications were reviewed; it was intended to make a meta-analysis; and the statistical data by the related official institutions and non- governmental organizations were utilized.\n\nÖzet: Kent ekonomisinin önemli bir bileşeni olan konut sektörü, düzenleme mekanizmalarının geliştirilmesini gerektirmektedir. Üretilen konut politikalarının en temel amacı, tüm hanehalklarının ister kiralık ister satılık olsun, ödeyebilecekleri \"iyi ve yeterli bir konutu\" elde edebilmeleridir. Bu bağlamda kiralık konut politikaları konut politikalarının daima önemli bir bileşeni olmaktadır. Gelişmiş Avrupa ülkelerinin kiralık konut sistemi içinde sosyal kiralık konut ve özel kiralık konut üretiminin bir arada yer aldığı görülmektedir. Buna karşın, Türkiye gibi gelişmekte olan pek çok ülkede kiralık konut sistemi sosyal kiralık konut sisteminden yoksun, serbest piyasa koşullarında, özel kiralık konut sistemi denilen, kendiliğinden oluşan bir arza dayanmaktadır. Bu makalede, farklı ülkelerin (gelişmiş) özel kiralık konut sistemlerini, özel kiralık konut arz ve talebini oluşturan temel aktörleri, özel kiralık konut sektörüne yönelik düzenlemeleri değerlendirilmektedir. Sonuç olarak, farklı gelişmiş ülke örneklerinin yaşadığı tecrübelerin Türkiye'de kendiliğinden oluşan özel kiralık konut arz ve talebine yönelik özel kiralık konut politikalarına ve düzenlemelerine nasıl yol gösterebileceği tartışılmaktadır. Anahtar kelimeler: konut politikası; özel kiralık konut sektörü; özel kiralık konut düzenlemeleri Abstract: Housing market is one of the most important components of urban economics.

In this article, private rental housing systems of various countries, the actors shaping the demand and supply of private rental housing market and relevant regulations are evaluated. As a conclusion, the experience of these developed countries are discussed for guiding policies and regulations in Turkey, where the market is mostly self organized.\n\nPERSONNEL SELECTION IN THE ACCOMODATIONS PROVIDING SERVICE İN HALAL HOTELS AND COMPARİSON WİTH CLASSİCAL HOTELS ABSTRACT The aim of our research is to investigate compatibility of person-organization fit in the Halal hotels absence of that determined in literature.
