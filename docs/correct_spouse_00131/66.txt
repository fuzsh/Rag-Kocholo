Brothers, rejoice! R&B songstress Jill Scott is giving up her vow of celibacy, opting for a "fifth date" rule instead. The singer tells Us Weekly that she's ready to embrace her carnal side after a self-imposed break: "The whole celibacy thing, you could throw that out the window. That's over."

But Miss Scott claims her self-denial phase taught her a lot of lessons, and she now opts to take things a lot slower with new men in her life. She says, "I don't have physical intimacy until at least the fifth date. So I can get to know who I'm dealing with and they can get to know me. It just gives me a chance to get to know the person."

Jill says she's on the lookout for a serious relationship after splitting with her ex, drummer Lil' John Roberts, with whom she has a one-year-old son Jett: "I'm a single girl in the world, but if I don't have some standards then I can be making the same mistakes that I made in the past. I do want love. Genuine love. And sometimes sex can get in the way."

One thing that will not be getting Jill's way is her body: the voluptuous singer recently dropped more than sixty pounds and is looking more radiant than ever. So for the single men out there, you could have a shot with Jilly from Philly, but don't forget that slow and stready will win the race.
