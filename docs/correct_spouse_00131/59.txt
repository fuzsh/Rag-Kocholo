Jill Scott, the sultry Grammy Award winning recording artist, poet and actress says she personally has a six month cut off period for potential partners.

Scott, at 42, knows what she wants in a relationship now and says you won’t catch her in relationships lasting longer than six months unless she meets an extremely remarkable guy who she sees herself having a pretty solid future with. Scott knows a thing or two about loving and losing. She married Lyzel Williams, a graphic artist and DJ in 2001. They divorced after only six years of marriage in 2007. The following year, June 2008, Scott told her audience at Carnegie Hall that she and drummer Lil’ John Roberts were engaged. But just months after the birth of their son Jett, in April of 2009, the couple split.

In an interview with ABC News Radio, Scott described her new six month relationship plan,

“I’m older now so I see a little bit better than I did before. My longest relationships now are about nine months. Actually, now it’s grown to six months. There’s no need for me to waste my time or anybody else’s. I know by then. If you make it over the six month hump, you have done something. I must really like you.”

Scott truly believes that in six months she will learn all she needs to know about a man and whether or not she has found someone worth moving forward with. In a nutshell, Scott advises love yourself first and don’t waste your time in a relationship going nowhere.
