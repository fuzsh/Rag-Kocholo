        "text": "In June of 2016, Jill Scott married Mike Dobson in front of family and surprised friends in her backyard, including DJ Mars, who didn’t know that the longtime couple were an item. It seemed that she finally got her happily ever after with him, inheriting a large family that included Dobson’s five children. Sadly though, their relationship is coming to an end after just a year of marriage.\n\nImage via Getty\n\nAccording to Bossip, Scott, 45, filed for divorce from Dobson, 49, in September after listing their date of separation as Sept. 5. The cause of divorce was cited by the singer as both “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper.”\n\nThe couple wed in Tennessee, and according to Bossip, per state law, the claims of “inappropriate marital conduct” could be anything from infidelity and verbal or physical abuse to cruel treatment and sexual impropriety. Per court papers, the estranged couple are now living separately.\n\nScott had a prenup put in place, so even though she obtained real estate and other assets while they were together, if the prenup is enforced by the court, he won’t be able to get his hands on any of that. According to Bossip‘s report, Dobson is unemployed. He hasn’t responded to her petition for divorce just yet, but in an exclusive with Bossip, Dobson claimed Scott is “evil” and denied violence, cheating and making her engage in unwanted sexual contact.\n\n“She’s an evil woman. I’m telling you. It’s like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets,” he said. “People are in her ear, and if someone comes in to challenge the dumb sh-t, they made me be the bad guy and that got me outta there.”\n\n“She’s got issues,” Dobson added. “There’s no men in that family, there’s only women. And when a man comes in, it’s like a challenge. She’s made other men look bad, but I’m not the one. I said (to her) ‘you’ve met your match.’ She likes to have men that she can control. You’re not gonna control me. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.”\n\nThis was Scott’s second marriage, as she wed Lyzel Williams in 2001. She was also previously engaged to Lil John Roberts, the father of her son, Jett. In 2011, Scott told The Guardian that one of the reasons she left her first marriage to Williams was because he wouldn’t eat her food following marital strife.\n\n“One of the reasons my ex-husband and I broke up is that he stopped eating my food,” she said. “He was pissed [off] for other reasons, but the best way to show me was by leaving what I’d made for him uneaten for days on the kitchen counter. It was a smack in the face.”"
