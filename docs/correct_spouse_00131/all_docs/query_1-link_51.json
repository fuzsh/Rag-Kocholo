        "text": "Recently I read that HBO, which has said goodbye to several of its signature series in the past couple of years, has hired ‚ÄúThe No. 1 Ladies‚Äô Detective Agency‚Äù to help find its next hit. So when I got the invite to cover the screening here in Philly I was really excited as I had never seen Jill Scott in person.\n\nThe cable channel is teaming up with The Weinstein Company and the BBC for a series based on Alexander McCall Smith‚Äôs best-selling series of novels about the only female-owned detective agency in Botswana. The two-hour pilot recently wrapped production there, and HBO has picked up 13 more hour-long episodes that will begin filming this summer.\n\nOn June 20, 2008 Jill got engaged to her drummer, Lil‚Äô John Roberts. He asked for her hand on the stage of Carnegie Hall in NYC before she was to perform. I waited for her to arrive via the stage door that day, but when I arrived 2 hrs ahead they said she was inside already, bummer.\n\nI thought tonight was going to be my lucky night, but it turns out she‚Äôs expecting her first child with fianc√© Lil‚Äô Jon Roberts on April 25, 2009.\n\nShe sent her mom instead, who is very excited for her only child to make her a grandmother. Jill Scott‚Äôs mom on the left, Joyce Scott and writer Alexander McCall Smith\n\nAnd I did run into a few friends from the GPFO Joan Bressler, Sharon Pinkenson and Peter Leokum . This Saturday is an all day long seminar about filming in Philadelphia, advice, networking, workshops ‚ÄúSIP‚Äù Day at The Philadelphia Film Festival/CineFest 2009 Catering was provided by Feast Your Eyes. Lots of souther food, BBQ sandwhiches, Yum (Not on Nutrisystem, but I did go to the gym when I got home)\n\nDarlene R. Smith and Sherry Dorsey of SWAP Productions LLC (Sisters With A Purpose). An independent film production company with a vested interest in producing films for theatrical release. One of the primary goals of SWAP is to create films that raise the consciousness of the viewers by dealing with subject matters that will not only be profitable but also entertain and educate the audiences. Look for their new documentary ‚ÄúJustice For All‚Äù a documentary about the juvenile justice system.\n\nBrille Kenner, Seana Ray, Denise Beck and Elise Persico\n\nThese two just got back from a romantic trip to the Bahama‚Äôs Nicole Cashman & Justin Wineburgh\n\nAnne-Marie Green and author Alexander McCall Smith posing in the lobby of the Prince Theater\n\nFilmaker Makia Harper and DJ Joe Casey aka DJ Lito, who is working it at north by northwest 7165 germantown ave on Latin Night.\n\n‚ÄòThe No. 1 Ladies‚Äô Detective Agency‚Äô is a poignant and passionate book series chronicling the adventures of Precious Ramotswe, the eminently sensible and wise proprietor of the only female-owned detective agency in Botswana. Aided by her highly-efficient yet rather peculiar secretary Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe investigates cases, helps people solve problems in their lives, and begins a special friendship with the highly respectable owner of a local garage.\n\n‚ÄúJill Scott in The No. 1 Ladies‚Äô Detective Agency ‚Äî Premeires on HBO Sunday March 29, 8pm‚Äù\n\nAnd don‚Äôt forget this week"
