        "text": "He was just defending his wife! This was the argument made by Fox News anchor John Roberts on Friday during coverage of a report from the New York Times that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito had an upside-down flag — a symbol of the dishonest “Stop the Steal” movement — flying on his property in the days after January 6. Fox’s Shannon Bream was in-studio after speaking to Alito about the flag, and she reported that the flag was a response to a neighborhood feud. Specifically, a neighbor allegedly called Alito’s wife a “cunt” after she complained about profanity-laced signs protesting former President Donald Trump in full view of children.\n\nRoberts then flipped the story around, saying that the associate justice could have done a lot worse:\n\nRoberts: He called her the C-word in front of the judge? Or, the justice?\n\nBream: That’s what Justice Alito told me.\n\nRoberts: Really?\n\nBream: And said that at some point she was obviously very upset, went home, did the flag. He had nothing to do with it. Didn’t think it was a great idea, but it was there for a short time.\n\nRoberts: He was lucky that they only got the flag. He’s lucky that the justice didn’t pop him one in the eye.\n\nBream: I think as a husband that would be a very difficult thing to try to walk away from. But clearly these neighbors have had an escalated situation.\n\nStill portraying this as a little neighborhood tiff and not a sign that a Supreme Court Justice might hold a biased view about the results of the 2020 presidential election (and should maybe recuse himself from any cases involving said election), Roberts played a montage of “left-wing media” reactions to the story, all from MSNBC. After that, he responded:\n\nRoberts: So you know, what they could be talking about was Justice Alito defending his wife, smacked his neighbor in the eye. But no, it was just a flag that was held upside-down to say “__ you.”\n\nBream: Well, I feel like we’re all happy that’s not where the story went.\n\nWatch the video above via Fox News."
