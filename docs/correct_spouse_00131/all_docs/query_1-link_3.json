        "text": "Soulful songbird Jill Scott told Essence magazine that she and her drummer Lil' John Roberts, who welcomed a son Jett Hamilton Roberts two months ago, have broken off their engagement and are no longer together. Scott says she's not sure if the split from Roberts was related to having the baby, but she says they \"love our son and we are co-parenting and working on being friends.\" Roberts, who like Scott was Philly-raised, has also toured in Janet Jackson's band."
