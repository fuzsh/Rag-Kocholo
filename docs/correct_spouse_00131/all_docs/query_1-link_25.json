        "text": "ESSENCE Music Festival headliner Jill Scott recently took over the Mo’Nique show with a live performance of hits from her upcoming album, “Light of the Sun.” As always, the talented singer delivered hot vocals and proved she’s still Jilly from Philly where it matters most. Check out the full performance and interview here…\n\nAfter taking the stage, Scott caught up with Mo’Nique about her latest single “Shame” and motherhood. The singer beamed as she talked about her husband-drummer Lil’ Jon Roberts and their adorable 2-year-old son, Jett, who apparently has some of his mommy’s talent.\n\n“He’s so musical,” Scott said about Jett. ” He loves Michael Jackson, he loves playing drums of course, he sings, he carries a microphone everywhere he goes. It’s incredible and I would do it again.”"
