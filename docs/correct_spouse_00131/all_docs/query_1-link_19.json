        "text": "Actress/Singer Jill Scott revealed to essence.com that she and her fiance/backup drummer Lil John have split since she had baby Jett:\n\nESSENCE.COM: Congrats to you on your new bundle of joy, Jett Hamilton. How has motherhood been treating you?\n\nSCOTT: Wonderful. I named him after a black gemstone that my makeup artist in Africa had; it was simply called Jet, and I fell in love with it and the name because I thought my beautiful baby is a gem. I truly loved being pregnant and feeling what was going on inside my body and watching it change. It’s difficult to recoup but still amazing nonetheless. I would have another one.\n\nESSENCE.COM: So does that mean you had an easy labor of love?\n\nSCOTT: Not at all. I was in labor for 36 hours. After that experience, anytime I have reservations and think I can’t do anything I remind myself that I survived the birth of my child (Laughs). Although I didn’t scream my baby into this world, the pain continued after he was born for at least three weeks. During labor I felt like I needed to put the fire out. Everybody kept telling me the pain wasn’t going to last forever but after 20 hours of it I left the building. I felt like I was on the ceiling looking down at myself like, Dag, girl, you still in labor? I know my experience isn’t everyone’s but I believe people need to be realistic when sharing their stories about their pregnancies and birth. When he arrived I held him in my arms for about an hour and then went to sleep because I was simply exhausted.\n\nJill Scott welcomes baby boy Jett\n\nESSENCE.COM: Well, at least your hubby-to-be was there to support. How has he been adjusting to Jett?\n\nSCOTT: Yes, he was there and for a couple of days afterwards while I stayed in hospital, but John and I are no longer together. When you have a baby you’re dealing with a lot of emotions and I don’t know how much of it had to do with us breaking up, but it happens. We definitely love our son and we are co-parenting and working on being friends. It is what it is. I have a lot of support, so I want for nothing as far as that’s concerned. I know some might criticize me or the fact that my son is being raised in a single-parent home, but I wasn’t raised in a two-parent home and I had a good relationship with my dad. I have hopes for him and I’m sure his father will do his part as well.\n\nCheck out the beautiful mom below:"
