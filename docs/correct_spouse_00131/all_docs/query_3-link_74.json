It‚Äôs why I moved there in the 1st place in 1994. Things were brewing in the music industry and all eyes were looking to the south to see what was gonna happen. Outkast had just put out their 1st record, and all the artists signed to LaFace Records with @la_reid was about to blow. People like Toni Braxton, Usher, TLC, Goodie Mob, and others, as well as the artists on SoSo Def Records with @jermainedupri like Kris Kross, Xscape, Da Brat, Bow Wow, Jagged Edge, Mariah Carey, and others, and Rowdy Records with @dallasaustins like Monica, For Real, Joi, Highland Place Mobsters, Sammie, Illegal, Ya‚Äôll So Stupid, and more. It was the perfect time for this young bol from Philly, straight out of @berkleecollege of music to move there and jump in head 1st. I‚Äôll tell it all in my documentary, but one of the people that I became friends with was this dude that was and still is well respected in Atlanta and abroad. He rolled with a crew full of giants that were actually called ‚ÄúThe Lyrical Giants‚Äù üí™üèæ affectionately known as ‚ÄúBonecrusher‚Äù @therealbonecrusher We went on to rock stages all over the city from the small spot we called our home ‚ÄúThe Yin Yan Cafe‚Äù to the 1996 Olympic shows and abroad. This is part of a series that he and his wife @storytellah did at one of our favorite studios in the city and our family @patchwerkstudio with Curtis Daniels  @frittyloc It‚Äôs just touching the tip of the iceberg about what happened in the 90‚Äôs and how the live music scene started booming and many artists and musicians were inspired by it and it was a spring board for some of their own careers. #TheHeartbeatofLilJohn\".",
