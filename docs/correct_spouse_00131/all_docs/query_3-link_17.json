        "text": "JOHN Roberts is the 17th and current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and will swear in Joe Biden as president.\n\nHe is married to the lawyer Jane Sullivan.\n\nWho is Chief Justice John Roberts' wife Jane Sullivan?\n\nJane Sullivan Roberts, is a lawyer at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.\n\nLegal search boutique firm Mlegal Group appointed Sulivan to spearhead its move into the nation’s capital in 2019.\n\nPreviously she was a recruiter with Major Lindsay and Africa, one of the major legal recruitment firms in the capital.\n\nShe is on the Board of Trustees at her alma mater the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nHer biography, in part, reads: “Prior to joining MLA, Jane was the Executive Partner for Talent Development at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Before assuming this role, she was a partner in the firm’s Global Technology Group focusing on IT sourcing and procurement of satellite systems.\n\n“Jane also practiced litigation at Shaw Pittman and Dorsey & Whitney in a wide variety of matters before various courts and decision-making bodies.\n\n\"In 1992, Ms. Roberts litigated before Australian courts with then Arthur Robinson & Hedderwicks, a leading law firm in Australia.\n\n\"Jane also clerked for the Honorable James M. Sprouse, Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, during the 1984-85 Term.\n\n\"Before entering the legal profession, she taught mathematics at the high-school and college levels and was a Systems Engineer at Bell Laboratories.”\n\nThey both have Irish backgrounds, according to Irish America, and part own a cottage in Knocklong County Limerick not far from her mother’s home place in Charleville on the Limerick/Cork border.\n\n\"There’s a lot of pride in our Irish background. We did Irish dancing, we did Irish music, had parties in my home where my grandfather and I danced together.\n\n\"Everybody had to have a party piece. I typically danced. I had one song, the ‘Gypsy Rover’ and I’m still asked to sing that song,” she told Irish America.\n\nWhen did they get married?\n\nJohn Roberts and Jane got married in 1996.\n\nThey met at a beach house but she soon left to spend a year in Australia.\n\nWhen they met again she bet him he didn’t remember what she was wearing the first time they met. He did, and she remembered what he wore too.\n\nShe told the site: “We were very attracted to each other. We had so much in common.”\n\nThe couple are members of the Church of the Little Flower in Bethesda, Md., a Catholic congregation.\n\nHow many children does John Roberts have?\n\nAfter the Robertses when they were both in their 40's, they tried to have children.\n\nAfter a several failed adoption efforts, he said, they \"got lucky\" with two children, Josephine and John, according to a New York Times article.\n\nShe told Irish America their children were the ultimate “grounding experience” for them both."
