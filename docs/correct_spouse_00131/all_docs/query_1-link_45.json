        "text": "Tyler Perry’s portrait of four couples in the 2007 film “Why Did I Get Married” and its sequel, “Why Did I Get Married Too?” (opening Friday), suggests marriage can be hell.\n\nSinger and actress Jill Scott, who returns along with Perry and Janet Jackson, knows wedded bliss isn’t for everyone.\n\n“Marriage isn’t necessarily about passion or lust,” said Scott, who has a son, Jett, with drummer Lil John Roberts but recently ended their engagement.\n\n“It’s got to be in there, but it’s not everything. You really need to take your time. You really need to be best friends,” she said.\n\nIn “Married Too,” Scott’s Sheila has divorced her abusive husband Mike (Richard T. Jones), remarried and had a baby.\n\nScott’s 2000 debut album, “Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Music Vol. 1,” went double platinum. Scott has a new album coming and begins a tour with Maxwell at the end of May.\n\nShe credits her versatility as a singer and actress to hard work and training.\n\n“Music and theater is where I began,” said Scott, whose warmth and maternal feelings in “Married Too” and as Precious in HBO’s “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency” contrast sharply with the nasty sibling she played just a week ago on an episode of NBC’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”\n\n“I was in college at the time and my ex-husband used to say to me, ‘You’re going to be an actor,’ ” Scott told the Herald in a recent one-on-one interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York.\n\nThat spurred the Philadelphia native to serve an apprenticeship at the Arden Theater Company for a year and a half.\n\n“I made $150 a week, worked 14 hours a day. They worked the snot out of us. But they gave me free acting classes.\n\n“Having performed in Shakespeare and Stephen Sondheim musicals helps me now,” she added.\n\nWhat about being more successful than many of the men she meets?\n\n“It’s really hard. In the beginning, they may fall for the outward appearance or the star of it all. Which is sad, because I’m 30 percent this,” she said.\n\nThe other 70 percent?\n\nShe laughed. “The other is Jill from 23rd and Lehigh, is Joyce’s daughter, Bill’s daughter, Jett’s mommy, fly chick, hip-hop head. Arcade-playing lunatic, book reader, long-bath taker. Vacation lover. I’m a lot besides this.”"
