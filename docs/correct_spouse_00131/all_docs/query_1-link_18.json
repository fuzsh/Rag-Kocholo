        "text": "Things have been getting nasty between Jill Scott and estranged hubby Mike Dobson, with the singer filing a restraining order against her ex while he called her an “evil woman” who blind-sided him with divorce papers.\n\nDobson is now asking the “Golden” singer for a huge favor, begging the songstress to keep things cordial from now on for the sake of their kids.\n\n“Please know that this very public approach to a sensitive matter like a divorce was never my intention, nor will it be my approach moving forward, despite the false statements published about me daily,” Dobson told Bossip in a statement through his lawyer.\n\n“Jill and I collectively have three children involved here and for the sake of their privacy and dignity, I would just ask all parties involved not to comment, say mean things and to please respect my individual privacy, her privacy and our children, who have to read all of these comments and statements.”\n\nThe Philly diva officially filed for divorce from husband of 17-months earlier this month, citing “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper.”\n\nScott was previously married to Lyzel Williams from 2001 to 2007, and was also engaged to her son, Jett’s father, Lil John Roberts."
