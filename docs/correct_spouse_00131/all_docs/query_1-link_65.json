        "text": "Jill Scott is an American actress, singer, and poet. She is best known for Why Did I Get Married?\n\nBiography[]\n\nJill Scott was born on April 4, 1972, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She grew up as an only child in a North Philadelphia neighborhood, raised by her mother, Joyce Scott, and her grandmother. She recalls a happy childhood and being \"very much a loved child\". After graduating the Philadelphia High School for Girls, Scott attended Temple University. While working two jobs, she studied secondary education. She planned to become a high school English teacher. However, after three years of study and then serving as a teacher's aide, Scott became disillusioned with a teaching career, and she dropped out of college.\n\nScott began her performing career as a spoken word artist, appearing at live poetry readings to perform her work. She was eventually discovered by Amir \"Questlove\" Thompson of the Roots. Questlove invited her to join the band in the studio. The collaboration resulted in a co-writing credit for Scott on the song \"You Got Me\". In 2000, Erykah Badu and the Roots won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"You Got Me\", and Scott debuted as an artist during a Roots live show, singing as the original artist/singer of the song.\n\nShe has a son with her ex-fiancé, Li'l John Roberts. Their son, Jett Hamilton Roberts, was born on April 20, 2009.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHer first acting role was on Girlfriends, which is a show created by Akils.\n\n[]"
