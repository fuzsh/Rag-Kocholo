        "text": "Jill Scott hasn’t hit a false note as one of the best R&B singers — make that singers, period — of her generation. But her career all started with a lie when she was discovered by Questlove in their hometown of Philadelphia.\n\n“He saw me at a poetry reading and asked me if I wrote songs — and I lied and said I did,” Scott, 47, tells The Post about her transformation from poetess to singer-songwriter. “I enjoyed singing, but I didn’t think I was gonna do it in front of people. It was just my personal little pleasure.”\n\nBut the pleasure has been all ours since the Grammy-winning songstress dropped her debut album, the neo-soul classic “Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1,” in 2000. Scott is celebrating the LP’s 20th anniversary by performing it from start to finish for the first time on a tour that hits Radio City Music Hall on Thursday.\n\n“When the album came out, I remember crying a lot: ‘Nobody’s gonna like it,’ ” she says. “Twenty years later, here I am touring with this music that has seemingly impacted so many people and has been a part of their lives in their birthing rooms, in their bedrooms when they made that baby, in their kitchens and at their barbecues. It’s really surreal.”\n\nIndeed, since introducing a fresh mix of spoken word and jazzy R&B on her debut, Scott has maintained “a very loyal audience.” Hiding most of her face on the “Who Is Jill Scott?” album cover, she wanted the music to speak for itself — and that it did.\n\n“I didn’t want the music or the poetry to be about anything but that,” says Scott, who faced pressure to conform her look as a female R&B artist: “I heard it all. I heard that I had to lose weight or I won’t sell any records. Wear straight hair or nobody’s gonna think I’m attractive … I didn’t want anybody to even see what I looked like.”\n\nRevisiting her debut two decades later has reconnected Scott with the young woman who wanted to be known and respected for her words and sounds over her appearance. “I remember her very well, the young Jill. I just found her again,” she says. “And I’m happy to honor her. I’m happy to honor that youthful spirit, that young and vibrant energy. I’m glad to see her again.”\n\nStill, she isn’t quite the same Jill who wrote fan favorite “He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)” as a dedication to first husband Lyzel Williams, who she divorced in 2007. “I was scared after I got a divorce, like, ‘Whew, can I sing that?’ ” says Scott. “But it found its way.”\n\nNow Scott — who has also built a successful acting career in film (“Why Did I Get Married?”) and TV (HBO’s “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency”) — stars in the BET+ series “The First Wives Club,” a black spin on the 1996 flick. “I musta watched that movie 30 or 40 times,” she says. “I’m a big Bette Midler fan. I adore her deeply … Diane Keaton gave me a compliment one time, and I think I cried for, like, a week!”\n\nMarried and divorced twice, the Nashville, Tenn.-based diva — who has a son, Jett, 10, with Lil’ John Roberts, her ex-boyfriend and drummer — hasn’t given up on joining the matrimony club again. “Actually, all of my friends are happily married,” says Scott. “It reaffirms my faith in love. I think it’s so worth the trip.” But, she adds with a laugh, “I just have to move molasses-ass slow.”"
