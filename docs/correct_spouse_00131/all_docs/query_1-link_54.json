        "text": "Surprise — Jill Scott is married.\n\nThe soul singer walked down the aisle Saturday in a top-secret wedding to longtime boyfriend Mike Dobson.\n\nScott, 44, opted for a low-cut white gown with lace sleeves. She wore her hair in a bun and accentuated her look with a pair of teardrop pearls. Her groom wore a simple black tuxedo.\n\nThe newlyweds looked happy and in love as they cut their three-tiered wedding cake. While some grooms shove cake in their bride’s face, Dobson tenderly fed his wife while the crowd shared a collective “Awww.”\n\nDJ Mars, who posted photos and video of the ceremony, then deleted them, said he knew about the wedding last year but wasn’t told whom Dobson was marrying. “So my man called me a year ago and said, ‘Mars I need you to DJ my wedding… don’t get booked on June 25, 2016!’” Mars captioned a wedding video. “He came to my house and gave me the deposit early but didn’t say he was marrying Jill Scott!!!!! Dam homie!!!!”\n\nThe reception was a full-on party as guests wore white and danced the night away. Big Daddy Kane was the surprise performer of the evening and his appearance shocked Scott. “Dude walks in and they didn’t even recognize him until he starts rapping,” DJ Mars captioned a video. “Her face is sooooo priceless.”\n\nAccording to E! News, this was Scott’s second trip down the aisle. She was previously married to Lyzel Williams until 2007. She was also engaged to drummer Lil’ John Roberts, with whom she shares 7-year-old son Jett Hamilton Roberts. They ended their relationship in 2009.\n\nA request for comment from Scott’s rep wasn’t immediately returned."
