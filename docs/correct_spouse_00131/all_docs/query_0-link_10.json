        "text": "American drummer\n\nMusical artist\n\nChris \"Daddy\" Dave is a drummer, composer, and bandleader from Houston, Texas. He attended Howard University. He is a drummer in jazz, gospel, hip hop, noted for his extremely virtuosic sticking technique and ability to play with a high degree of syncopation. He performed professionally as a gospel drummer with the Winans, before being introduced to jazz audiences nationally through his association with the accomplished alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. He performed on Kenny Garrett's album Standard of Language, before joining the Robert Glasper Experiment and performing on Adele's Grammy Award winning album, 21. He also recorded on D'Angelo's album Black Messiah, and joined the band for the world tour.[1]\n\nLife and career[edit]\n\nChris Dave was born in Houston, Texas and began his music career in the late 1980s.[2] He started out by playing in church and credits jazz music as his strongest influence.[3] He states that although his father plays drums, he has never actually heard him play.[4] As a teenager, he was exposed to jazz legends like Miles Davis and John Coltrane when listening to music with his father. Chris Dave blossomed on the drums, eventually graduating from Houston's prestigious High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.\n\nHe studied at Howard University in Washington D.C. where he met acclaimed producers and former Prince associates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Through this relationship, Chris Dave's professional career began as he started working with R&B band Mint Condition.[5]\n\nDave played drums in Bilal's live band, during the singer's period of touring in the aftermath of his unreleased but leaked album Love for Sale. This included a stint on Jill Scott's The Real Thing Tour in 2008.[6]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nChris Dave married Madagascar native, singer-songwriter, Nataly Andria, in Houston, Texas in January 2021.[7] They have apparently been in a long-term relationship prior to the wedding according to Andria website although the time when they truly began dating has never been revealed so far.[8]\n\nThey have a daughter, Avo Dave, born in December 2021\n\nDiscography[edit]\n\nAs leader[edit]\n\nChris Dave and the Drumhedz – Mixtape (Glow365, 2013)\n\nChris Dave and the Drumhedz – Radio Show (Glow365, 2017)\n\nChris Dave and the Drumhedz – Chris Dave and the Drumhedz (Blue Note, 2018)\n\nChris Dave & Daniel Crawford – Smoke Break (2020)\n\nChris Dave & Daniel Crawford – Cuffin Season (Drumhedz Music, 2020)\n\nChris Dave – Thine People (EP)(Drumhedz Music, Feb 2021)\n\nChris Dave – Thine People Vol.2 (EP)(Drumhedz Music, Aug 2021)\n\nChris Dave – \"The City of Everly\" (EP) (Drumhedz Music, Oct 2021)\n\nChris Dave – \"The City of Everly, Part. 2 SUPEREARTH\" (EP) (Drumhedz Music, Dec 2021)\n\nAs sideman[edit]\n\nWith Mint Condition\n\nFrom the Mint Factory (Perspective, 1993)\n\nDefinition of a Band (Perspective, 1996)\n\nLife's Aquarium (Elektra, 1999)\n\nLivin' the Luxury Brown (Image Entertainment, 2005)\n\nWith Kenny Garrett\n\nSimply Said (Warner Bros., 1999)\n\nStandard of Language (Warner Bros., 2003)\n\nWith Robert Glasper\n\nDouble-Booked (Blue Note, 2009)\n\nBlack Radio (Blue Note, 2012)\n\nF**k Yo Feelings (Loma Vista Recordings, 2019)\n\nBlack Radio III (Loma Vista,2022)\n\nWith Me'shell Ndegeocello\n\nComfort Woman (Maverick, 2003)\n\nThe Spirit Music Jamia: Dance of the Infidel (Universal Music, 2005)\n\nWith Hikaru Utada\n\nHatsukoi (初恋) (Epic, 2018)\n\nHikaru Utada and Nariaki Obukuro – \"Marunouchi Sadistic\" in Ringo Sheena's cover album Adam to Eve no Ringo (アダムとイヴの林檎) (Epic, 2018)\n\nWith Eric Roberson\n\nMister Nice Guy (Blue Erro Soul/eOne Music, 2011)\n\nLessons (Blue Erro Soul, 2022)\n\nWith others\n\nMaxwell – BLACKsummers'night (Columbia, 2009)\n\nAdele – 21 (XL, 2011), 30(Columbia Records, 2022)\n\nPJ Morton – New Orleans (2013)\n\nEd Sheeran – X (album) (2014)\n\nLil' John Roberts – The Heartbeat (NIA Music Distribution, 2014)\n\nAngus & Julia Stone – Angus & Julia Stone (American Recordings, 2014)\n\nD'Angelo – Black Messiah (RCA, 2014)\n\nJustin Bieber – Purpose (Def Jam Recordings, 2015)\n\nAnderson .Paak – Malibu (ArtClub, 2016)\n\nNariaki Obukuro – Bunriha no Natsu (Sony Music, 2018)\n\nBlack Milk – Fever (Mass Appeal, 2018)\n\nAnderson .Paak – Oxnard (12Tone, 2018)\n\nRaphael Saadiq – Jimmy Lee (Columbia, 2019)\n\nRobbie Robertson – Sinematic (UME Direct, 2019)\n\nPino Paladino and Blake Mills – \"Just Wrong\" (Single) in Notes With Attachments (Impulse!, 2021), Ekuté\n\nTheo Crocker – Love Quantum(Masterworks,2022)\n\nGoapele – Colors(Skyblaze Recordings,2023)\n\nKeyon Harrold – Foreverland (Out today/Concord Jazz,2024)\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
