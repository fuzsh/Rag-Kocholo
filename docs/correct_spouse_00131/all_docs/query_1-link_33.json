        "text": "UPDATE: Jill Scott isn’t playing any games with estranged husband Mike Dobson, as the “Golden” singer has just been granted a restraining order against her soon-to-be ex.\n\nAccording to Bossip, neither spouse can threaten, harass or stalk the other, nor can one speak disparagingly about the other in front of their children. They also cannot destroy or hide files on their hard drives or computers or hide assets from the marriage. The order goes on to say that neither can spend money excessively without the court’s permission throughout the duration of their divorce proceedings.\n\nLearn more about their separation and Dobson’s reaction to his “evil” ex filing for divorce below.\n\nOriginal Story\n\nIt appears another celebrity couple have called it quits!\n\nJill Scott has officially filed for divorce from husband of 17-months, Mike Dobson, according to Bossip. The 45-year-old songstress cites, “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper,” according to court documents obtained by the site.\n\nDespite her reasons, Dobson spoke with Bossip about the separation, saying the Philly songstress is an “evil” woman who “blindsided” him with divorce papers, as he never cheated on nor abused her.\n\n“She’s an evil woman. I’m telling you. It’s like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets. People are in her ear, and if someone comes in to challenge the dumb sh*t, they made me be the bad guy and that got me outta there. She’s got issues.”\n\nDobson continued, “There’s no men in that family, there’s only women. And when a man comes in, it’s like a challenge. She’s made other men look bad, but I’m not the one. I said (to her) ‘you’ve met your match.’”\n\n“She likes to have men that she can control. You’re not gonna control me. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.”\n\nHe went on, “She likes to emasculate men – that’s her problem. I told her, she’s from Philly, but I’m from New York, and if you want to try to disgrace me, try to slander me, I can fight dirty.”\n\nScott was previously married to Lyzel Williams from 2001 to 2007, and was also engaged to her son, Jett’s father, Lil John Roberts."
