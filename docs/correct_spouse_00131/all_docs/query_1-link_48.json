        "text": "Jill Scott’s son, Jett Hamilton Roberts, is connected and deep. The youngster’s mom recently took to Instagram to express gratitude for a son who is deeply spiritual and compassionate.\n\n“I like this boy,” Jill told her social media fans. “His ear is magnificent scary,” the celebrity mom doted. “I’m impressed with his kindness and how romantic about The Creator he is. I appreciate his encouragement and his honesty. The boy is deep,” Jill exclaimed. “When we laugh, tears, dap and running. I love when he randomly holds my hand and asks questions that I have to pray about. I’m wit the young bawh. I love him love him.”\n\nJill Scott shared an old picture of Jett that she described as nothing short of “timeless.” More than 100,000 subscribers loved what they saw and read. “He is his mother,” one fan wrote in response to Scott’s sweet note. Another of Jill Scott’s social media followers agreed by saying, “He has no choice. His mother is phenomenal.” Indeed, she is!\n\nSome may remember Jill Scott’s reflections about motherhood when her son was just 5-years-old. “Motherhood is the most demanding job created,” the celebrity shared. “Motherhood is not a dream or a fable etched in the mind,” Jill continued. “Nothing is simple when you love someone this much. Nothing is neat when you’re this needed. Life doesn’t stop because you’ve given birth. A new life begins and you own it and make it yours.”\n\nJett is Jill Scott’s son with Lil’ John Roberts. He celebrated his tenth birthday this year. Stay tuned for more celebrity kids news!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
