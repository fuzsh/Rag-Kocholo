        "text": "Singer Ends Marriage With Husband After Just One Year\n\nJill Scott has split from her husband after just 15 months of marriage, BOSSIP can reveal.\n\nThe 45-year-old Grammy winner filed for divorce Sept. 15 from her now ex-Mike Dobson, 49, citing “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper,” according to her divorce petition.\n\nAnd as far as what “inappropriate marital conduct” is, under Tennessee state law that could mean anything from cruel treatment, infidelity, verbal or physical abuse or sexual impropriety.\n\nHowever, Scott’s estranged husband Dobson told BOSSIP exclusively that he never laid a hand on his wife, cheated on her or made her engage in unwanted sexual contact.\n\nDobson said he was “blindsided” by Scott’s divorce filing, although he admitted that they agreed to separate, work on their relationship and keep wearing their wedding rings.\n\n“She’s an evil woman,” the husband told us. “I’m telling you. It’s like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets. People are in her ear, and if someone comes in to challenge the dumb s**t, they made me be the bad guy and that got me outta there.”\n\nHe added: “She’s got issues. There’s no men in that family, there’s only women. And when a man comes in, it’s like a challenge.”\n\nThe one time couple wed in an intimate ceremony in June 2016 in Tennessee, and Big Daddy Kane performed. They have no children.\n\nScott, who is notoriously secretive about her love life, was previously married to Lyzel Williams from 2001 to 2007. She was also once engaged to musician Lil John Roberts, and the pair has a son, Jett.\n\n“She’s made other men look bad, but I’m not the one. I said (to her) ‘you’ve met your match,'” Dobson said. “She likes to have men that she can control. You’re not gonna control me. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.”\n\nThe “Golden” singer lists the date of separation as Sept. 5th, and says in court papers that they are now living in separate houses. She also lists herself as earning a “PhD” and her occupation as a writer. She also lists Dobson as unemployed, but he told BOSSIP that he has held a position with the city of Atlanta since 2011. Dobson said that Scott may have listed him as unemployed on the divorce docs to smear him.\n\n“She likes to emasculate men – that’s her problem,” Dobson said. “I told her, she’s from Philly, but I’m from New York, and if you want to try to disgrace me, try to slander me, I can fight dirty,” Dobson said.\n\nScott admitted that she bought real estate and other assets during their marriage, but said she has a prenup with Dobson, and asked the court to enforce it.\n\nDobson had not responded to Scott’s petition, court documents show.\n\nWe’ve tried to reach out to Scott’s lawyer for comment.\n\nHit the flip for pics of the couple in happier times."
