        "text": "Post by Caviar on\n\nSince the last era has ended some time ago, let's keep all Jill Scott discussion here while we wait on the next record.\n\nLOS ANGELES, Calif. --\n\nIt’s a boy for singer and actress Jill Scott and fiance Lil John Roberts, People reported.\n\nJett Hamilton Roberts was born at 4:20 PM on April 20, a rep for the singer confirmed to the mag.\n\nLittle Jett weighed in at 7 lbs., 8 oz.\n\nJill discovered she was pregnant while filming her HBO series “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency” in Botswana.\n\n“At one point I was trying to gain weight for the role, and I noticed I had put on 7 lbs. in 7 days. And I thought, my god! What’s going on here,” she told the mag in January. “I thought something was wrong with me, and I found out I was pregnant the day I was supposed to leave for Africa.”\n\nFilming while pregnant posed a variety of challenges for the expecting mom.\n\n“That was one of the biggest challenges of my life. First trimester! You’re sick every morning. It was seven hours time difference, the heat, the bugs, the 14 hour days,” she told the mag. “[But,] my doctors gave me a clean bill of health and said you can do this, so I did it.”\n\nJill and Lil John have been reportedly dating since 2007. The couple announced their plans to marry in June.\n\nCopyright 2009 by NBC Universal, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."
