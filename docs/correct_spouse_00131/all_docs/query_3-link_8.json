        "text": "American rapper and record producer (born 1972)\n\nNot to be confused with Little John.\n\nJonathan H. Smith[1] (born January 17, 1972),[2] better known by his stage name Lil Jon, is an American rapper and record producer. He was instrumental in the commercial breakthrough of the hip hop subgenre crunk in the early 2000s and is often credited as a progenitor of the genre.[3] He was the frontman of the crunk group Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, with whom he has released five albums.[4][5] In addition, Lil Jon served as a producer for most recordings by artists who popularized the genre; these include Pitbull, Too Short, E-40, Ludacris, Ciara, and Usher.[6]\n\nAs a producer, Lil Jon has produced several Billboard Hot 100 hit singles including \"Salt Shaker\", \"Cyclone\", \"Get Low\", \"Snap Yo Fingers\", \"Damn!\", \"Freek-a-Leek\", \"Lovers and Friends\", \"Goodies\" and \"Yeah!\".[7] The lattermost won Lil Jon a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance as part of his five Grammy Award nominations.[8]\n\nIn 2013, Lil Jon released \"Turn Down for What\" (with DJ Snake), an EDM single which was certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[9] The song went on to win the Billboard Music Award for Top Dance/Electronic Song.[10] The accompanying music video was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video, and passed the milestone of 1 billion views on YouTube seven years after it was released.[11] Listed as one of the Top Billboard Music Award Winners of All Time in 2016,[12] Lil Jon has amassed his eight number one singles on Billboard's Rhythmic chart.[13]\n\nSmith was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in a middle-class neighborhood located in Southwest Atlanta. He is the oldest of five children born to his father, an aerospace engineer with former military service, and his mother, with a medical career within the military. Three of his siblings would later follow their parents lead and also serve in the United States military.[3]\n\nSmith attended Beecher Hills Elementary School and Southwest Middle School, both located within the Atlanta Public School district.[14] His mother described him as a high achiever early on in addition to being independent and a passionate reader.[14] While in middle school, Smith became lifelong friends with Robert McDowell, Dwayne \"Emperor\" Searcy (future DJ and radio personality for Radio One's WHTA),[15] and Vince Phillips (named as one of Billboard's Top Music Lawyers since 2020),[16][17][18][19] who would become business partners. The foursome quickly became immersed in the skateboarding culture and would later work at Skate Escape, a popular skate and bicycle shop near the city's iconic Piedmont Park. While his best friends attended Benjamin E. Mays High School, Smith attended Frederick Douglass High School for their magnet program and was a member of the marching band.[3] They also began to frequently attend concerts at the Masquerade, to see their favorite bands, including Agent Orange and Red Hot Chili Peppers.[14]\n\nAt the age of 15, Smith taught himself how to DJ,[3] and although his parents were strict, they gave him a chance to work on his DJ skills by allowing him to have house parties in the basement of the family home, citing that they would rather have him under their watch than for him to \"be in the street somewhere\".[20] The parties, hosted by Smith and Searcy \"Old E and Chicken Parties\", became popular with local teens. In addition to working at the skate shop, Smith also began spinning at house parties and working in local dance clubs as a DJ.[3] Eventually Smith became an in house DJ at Phoenix, a popular Atlanta nightclub at the time. It was there he would meet established music artists such as Jermaine Dupri, TLC, the Notorious B.I.G., Craig Mack and Mary J. Blige.[21]\n\nAfter graduating high school, Lil Jon continued to work as a DJ in popular downtown Atlanta clubs.[3] It was there he met Jermaine Dupri. When it came to hiring an A&R to lead his Atlanta-based music label So So Def, Dupri stated that \"All I could think about was Lil Jon, because he was the person in the clubs. He knew people, DJs knew him. I had to hire him.\"\n\nAfter he was promoted to Executive Vice President of A&R, Lil Jon recruited DJ Smurf, Shawty Redd, Raheem the Dream, and Playa Poncho with others to create the compilation album series, So So Def Bass All Stars as his first project.[22] Released on May 12, 1996, the album was a success, selling over 500,000 units and was certified gold by the RIAA on September 19, 1996, four months after its initial release.[23] The album, executive produced by Lil Jon, included the hit single \"My Boo\" by Ghost Town DJ's.[24] It was sampled by Ciara in her 2013 hit \"Body Party\".[25] In 2016, 20 years after its initial release, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at No. 29 due to a viral dance video.[26] Lil Jon completed the series, releasing So So Def Bass All-Stars Vol. II (1997)[27] and So So Def Bass All-Stars Vol. III (1998).[28]\n\nApart from his label commitments, Lil Jon was a radio personality and DJ on Atlanta radio station, V-103,[29] continued to produce music for outside music artists, and was still working as a DJ at popular clubs around the city.[3]\n\nIn 1995, Lil Jon collaborated with Big Sam and Lil' Bo to form a musical rap group: the East Side Boyz.[30]\n\nIn 1996, the group released their debut single, \"Who U Wit?\". The song is credited as bringing the term \"crunk\" into hip-hop currency.[3] In 1997, the group released their debut album Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. The singles \"Who U Wit?\", produced by Lil Jon, and \"Shawty Freak a Lil Sumthin\", produced by DJ Toomp, charted on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at No. 70 and No. 62, respectively.[31]\n\nIn 2000, through the newly created label Black Market, the group released their breakthrough album We Still Crunk!! which featured the single \"I Like Dem Girlz\" which reached No. 55 on the Billboard R&B chart and No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.[31]\n\nThe team was well equipped with prior experience at promoting albums and worked to grow the group's fan base across radio markets.[32] Promotional street teams that were hired major music labels to promote their repertoire, began to talk within music promotion circles on how successful Lil Jon and his team were on the ground and were gaining radio airplay in radio markets that were usually difficult for non local artists to break into.[32]\n\nBryan Leach, formerly an A&R executive at the now defunct New York based label TVT Records, heard about the group and attended their Atlanta show. He was blown away by the group's immense energy. Leach told HitQuarters: \"It was like early Beastie Boys, when they had the energy of a rock group but they were rapping, and that energy is what crunk music is all about.\"[32] By 2002, Leach signed Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz to TVT Records with Black Market delivering the albums to the label. The group released the album Put Yo Hood Up, which combined previously released tracks with new ones. \"Bia' Bia'\", which featured Ludacris, Too Short, Big Kap, and Chyna Whyte was the group's first single to be played nationally.[33] \"Bia' Bia'\" peaked at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 47 on the Billboard R&B chart.[31] The album was certified gold by the RIAA in June 2002.[34]\n\nIn 2002, the group released their sophomore studio album under the label Kings of Crunk with the song \"I Don't Give a Fuck\" as the first single. The song featured former No Limit Records artist Mystikal and former Ruthless Records artist, Krayzie Bone. It peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard R&B chart.[31] The group's next single, \"Get Low\" featured fellow Atlanta hip hop group Ying Yang Twins and became popular in nightclubs nationwide; it reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100.[31] The album was certified multi-platinum by the RIAA in August 2004.[34] The song was also featured in Need for Speed: Underground, which plays in the main menu as well as gameplay. In 2003, the group released Part II, a remix album of previously released singles with a two new songs.\n\nIn 2004, Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz released what would be the group's last studio album, Crunk Juice. The lead single \"What U Gon' Do\" (featuring Lil' Scrappy) peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 13 on the Billboard R&B chart, and No. 5 on the Billboard Rap chart. The second single, \"Lovers and Friends\" (featuring Usher and Ludacris), peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 2 on the Billboard R&B Chart, and No. 1 on the Billboard Rap chart.[31] The album was certified multi-platinum in January 2005, two months after it was released.[34] In 2005, after releasing six studio albums together and amidst ongoing creative and financial conflicts with TVT, the group disbanded.\n\nIn 2006, Lil Jon, in an attempt to fulfill his obligations to TVT released the single \"Snap Yo Fingers\". The song was produced by Lil Jon and features BME Recordings artist E-40 and Sean P. The song peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum on November 22, 2006.[4] After the song was released, Lil Jon vowed to never to record for TVT Records again.[35] In 2008, TVT Records, embroiled in legal battles, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[36]\n\nIn 2009, Lil Jon was featured on Jay Sean's double platinum[37] single \"Do You Remember\" that was featured in the film remake of The Karate Kid.

The single \"Hey\" (featuring 3OH!3) was also featured on MTV's Jersey Shore Soundtrack with the entire cast appearing in the music video.[39] The second single, \"Outta Your Mind\" was featured in the film Project X and used by Alex & Twitch on the Fox television series, So You Think You Can Dance, which is considered to be the finest hip-hop routine ever performed on the series.[40]\n\nLil Jon said that “after the crunk era, I was fried from producing so much,” eventually rediscovering a passion for performing as a DJ after discovering DJ Spider. This led to him meeting Steve Aoki, with whom he teamed up alongside Laidback Luke to record the song \"Turbulence\", released on May 14, 2011,[41] as a digital download in the United Kingdom and was released on July 17, 2011, as an EP. The radio edit version of the song was included on the bonus track version of Aoki's debut album Wonderland. The song is also the current official goal song for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nIn July 2011, he released a song with LMFAO called \"Drink\" through Ultra Records. It was used in the trailer for the film The World's End. In 2012, he appeared on three songs featured in the film Step Up Revolution and on the film's soundtrack.

The song reached No. 1 on Billboard's Rhythmic and Hot Dance/Electronic Songs charts, No. 2 on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, No. 4 on the Hot 100, and No. 5 on the Mainstream Top 40. The song has had significant use in media and was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.[42] Lil Jon also partnered with Zumba Fitness to create a new nightclub tour titled \"Zumba Nightclub Series\" and for the Zumba Fitness series, he released a new song called \"Work\".\n\nOn July 22, 2014, Lil Jon released the single \"Bend Ova\" (featuring Tyga) on Epic Records.[43][44] The song was featured in the two part series finale of the NBC television series Parks and Recreation. \"Take It Off\" (featuring Yandel and Becky G) was released on July 22, 2016, and the single \"Alive\" (featuring Offset and 2 Chainz) was released in 2018 on Geffen Records.[45] In December 2018, Lil Jon released the Christmas single \"All I Really Want for Christmas\" (featuring Kool-Aid Man) in cooperation with the Kool-Aid brand of soft drinks.[46]\n\nIn 2018, Lil Jon appeared in volume two of the Future-led soundtrack for the film Superfly.[47] The following year, he appeared in the soundtrack for Spies in Disguise, curated by Mark Ronson.[48]\n\nLil Jon made a cameo in Usher's Super Bowl LVIII halftime show, performing \"Turn Down for What\" and his portion of \"Yeah!\".\n\nIn 2004, Smith, McDowell, Phillips and Searcy launched BME Recordings in a joint venture with Warner Bros. Records and released The King of Crunk & BME Recordings Present: Trillville & Lil Scrappy (2004) with Lil Jon producing most of the album.[49] The album single \"Some Cut\" has been a favorite of samplers over the years.[50] The label entered the San Francisco Bay Area hyphy music scene with Bay Area rapper E-40, releasing the album, My Ghetto Report Card (2006) with the Lil Jon-produced single \"Tell Me When to Go\".

Lil Jon meditates daily with affirmations. [59]\n\nJason Birchmeier of AllMusic has described Lil Jon's production as \"bass-heavy\", and his album Put Yo Hood Up as having \"a long and varied list of guest rappers to accompany the beats\". Describing that album with guest performers, Birchmeier remarked: \"The end result is an album that resembles a street-level mixtape rather than a traditional artist-oriented album\".[60]\n\nLil Jon was specifically influenced by 2 Live Crew, 8Ball & MJG, Three 6 Mafia, Outkast, Geto Boys, UGK, N.W.A, Dr. Dre, and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Alex Henderson, also of AllMusic, contrasted Lil Jon's style of \"rowdy, in-your-face, profanity-filled party music\" with other Southern rappers, those who \"have a gangsta/thug life agenda\" and those who convey \"serious sociopolitical messages\".[61] Lil Jon has also found influence in rock music, having worked with Rick Rubin and Korn.[62] He expresses this influence in his aggressive delivery and 'yelling' style of rap. He was seen on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time program wearing a Bad Brains T-shirt, and he used to listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd while growing up in the South in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2004, Lil Jon married Nicole and together they have a son, Nathan (known as DJ Young Slade).[63] Lil Jon has stated that one of his greatest joys is seeing everything come full circle with his son, who has been DJing since the age of 11.[64]\n\nHe is an avid fan of all of Atlanta's sports teams which included the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers until they relocated to Winnipeg in 2011.[65] He also follows the Las Vegas teams, claiming that being in the city during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and seeing the community response made him want to support what he calls his second home.[41] His support for the Vegas Golden Knights led to him appearing in the team 2019 documentary Valiant,[66] and being given a Stanley Cup ring after their 2023 title, which he wore during the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show.[67] He is also a fan of University of Tennessee Volunteers and DJ Sterl the Pearl, who adopted his hit song \"Turn Down for What\" on third downs, changing it to \"Third Down for What\". On October 4, 2014, Lil Jon made an appearance via Jumbotron encouraging the Volunteers to beat the University of Florida Gators; and also visited the Volunteers, giving them a pep talk.\n\nLil Jon is a notable Atlanta resident and appears on advertisements in Hartsfield-Jackson Airport welcoming new arrivals to the city. He also appears on the Jumbotron at Mercedes-Benz Stadium during Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United games.[68] During Super Bowl LIII held in Atlanta in 2019, Lil Jon appeared in the NFL's \"This Is Atlanta\" promotional video to welcome incoming visitors to the city, alongside fellow Atlanta residents, former Atlanta Hawks basketball player Dominique Wilkins, former Atlanta Braves baseball player Chipper Jones, civil right icons Congressman John Lewis and former congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations and Mayor of Atlanta Andrew Young, rappers Big Boi and Killer Mike, singer Rozonda Thomas (Chilli of TLC), comedian Jeff Foxworthy, and television personality Ryan Seacrest. Organized by musician Jermaine Dupri, a host of Atlanta area high school drummers, local brass musicians and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra also appeared and supplied the underlying music.[69] Lil Jon also appeared in CBS Sports' official open of the network's coverage of the game.[70]\n\nIn 2024, Lil Jon converted to Islam.[71]\n\nLil Jon has been using his star power and wealth to help children in underdeveloped countries gain access to a proper education. He has helped to fund two schools in the village of Mafi Atitekpo in Ghana, in partnership with the charity Pencils of Promise. The first, Abomayaw D.A. Kindergarten, opened in October 2017. The second school, Mafi Atitekpo DA Primary School, broke ground in January 2018 and will enroll 313 children.[72] In 2019, Pencils of Promise honored both Lil Jon and Trevor Noah in recognition of their charitable efforts at the charity's annual gala.[73]\n\nIn 2018, a 16-year-old student of Douglass High School reached out to rapper and alumnus Killer Mike via Instagram in a last-chance attempt to raise money to cover expenses for the school marching band to travel to New Orleans to march in the annual Mardi Gras parade. To his surprise, Killer Mike not only responded positively, but also enlisted the help of fellow alumni Lil Jon and T.I.. They and donors covered the trip for the students.[74]\n\nCrunk Rock (2010)\n\nWith the East Side Boyz\n\nGet Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album (1997)\n\nWe Still Crunk!!
