        "text": "Behind the glamour and success of Grammy Award-winning artist Jill Scott lies a story of love and heartache. The singer has been through two marriages that ended with divorce. Today, she is a mother and has not allowed her past hurts to define her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott is a multi-talented artist. She is a singer, songwriter, model, and poet with her fair share of heartbreak and has since opened up about them in interviews. The star from Philadelphia has also sung and written music about her love life.\n\nHer first husband inspired some of her music about love. The actress also once took to social media to give insight into the kind of men she would no longer be seen with. After her second marriage ended, her husband also commented on their divorce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott's First Marriage & Divorce\n\nJill Scott, who has acted alongside John David Washington, Common, Janet Jackson, Tasha Smith, Paula Patton, Tyler Perry, and more, was first married to graphic artist and DJ Lyzel Williams. The pair crossed paths in a private ceremony in Hawaii during her poetry readings eight years before they walked down the aisle in November 2001.\n\nThere were no media announcements about their wedding and no photos either. She once said Williams did not care about the music business and that she loved him for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Scott divulged Williams inspired her to write a love song about him called \"He Loves Me [Lyzel in E Flat).\" She gushed about him once: \"He's man, not a boy, trying to be a man. He's steadfast, strong. Every day in his walk, he carries a love and respect for his woman...I totally respect him.\"\n\nIn a September 2004 interview, Scott, who had been married for three years to Williams at the time, talked about married life. The \"Baggage Claim\" star divulged:\n\n\"Married life is really good. It's a beautiful thing. […] I love married life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being in marital bliss, things turned sour in the couple's union leading to a divorce in 2007 after six years of marriage. Scott revealed why she and Williams divorced in a June 2011 interview:\n\n\"One of the reasons my ex-husband and I broke up is that he stopped eating my food. He was pissed [off] for other reasons, but the best way to show me was by leaving what I'd made for him uneaten for days on the kitchen counter. It was a smack in the face.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott's Second Short-Lived Marriage with Mike Dobson\n\nSeveral years after the end of her first marriage, Scott tied the knot for the second time to Mike Dobson in June 2016. This time around, there were wedding pictures. The bride looked stunning in a white low-cut gown with long lace sleeves and a sparkling silver belt.\n\nThe dress had a long veil, and she sported white clips on her hair which she wore up. Meanwhile, the groom donned a black tuxedo. At the wedding reception, Dobson shared an emotional speech upon seeing his bride walk down the aisle, saying:\n\n\"I teared up when she came...I'm gonna tear up now.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDobson surprised his newly wedded wife with a performance from hip-hop legend Big Daddy Kane, who danced with the bride. Unfortunately, Scott and Dobson's marriage did not last for long.\n\nIn November 2017, she filed for divorce following 15 months of matrimony. The poet cited \"irreconcilable differences\" and \"inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper,\" per her petition.\n\nIn an interview, Dobson, who revealed the divorce blindsided him, said, \"She's an evil woman. I'm telling you. It's like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott Shares a Child with Her Former Fiance\n\nScott never had any children with her two former spouses. However, when they were engaged, she welcomed a baby boy in 2009 with drummer Lil John Roberts — the couple broke up shortly after their son was born after dating for two years.\n\nDoctors had earlier told Scott that she would never have kids. But things turned out differently, and she talked about her miracle experience in a January 2009 interview, \"It's so hard to believe, it's hard to have faith, especially when things aren't working out,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to standing tall in her faith, Scott has also learned to set standards for herself regarding men. In an October 2018 Instagram post, she shared five points to look out for in relationships intended for her followers.\n\nShe advised them not to fall for apologies but to take notice of patterns. Not to fall in love with potential, note the red flags, know their worth, and not lower their standards.\n\n\"Note. YOUR standards are not everyone else’s,\" the songstress penned. In the comments section, she further revealed she would not date \"Uncle Daddies,\" someone disrespectful to their parents and people who are broke and broken yet comfortable."
