        "text": "TUSCALOOSA | In another picture-perfect Friday evening at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater, silky-smooth soul sounded where before twang and strum and thump had mostly run before.\n\nJill Scott headlined an evening for about 6,600 paying fans, many of them dressed up for a night out. In some senses, it paralleled last week's Friday night show for Widespread Panic, with a happy crowd of people on their feet and grooving from the start. In another, it was completely different, with Panic's fan base almost exclusively white, while the Scott and Anthony Hamilton show was nearly 100 percent black.\n\nComedian Sir Walt opened the evening, serving as emcee and filling time between Scott and Anthony Hamilton. The Birmingham native, who has been on BET's \"Comic View\" and the P. Diddy-produced \"Bad Boys of Comedy\" on HBO, made light observational jokes, often self-deprecating about things like the poor state of his car: \"I put a ‘For Sale' sign on it and some guy came up and said ‘For what?' People break into it and leave to-do lists….\" He raised a little Roll Tide between the sets, noting that he'd played football once. But not well.\n\n\"We went to the championship. Everybody got a ring. I got a necklace. It was a candy necklace, too.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton heated things up with a tight funky band — keyboards, horns, drums and three backup/ harmony singers — creating a hot R&B sound that wouldn't be out of place on a classic '70s set with the Temptations or the Impressions. He opened with Willie Hutch's \"Brother's Gonna Work It Out,\" which segued into a slow jam on his own we're-gonna-make-it love song \"Cool,\" a 2008 chart hit. His roughly 80-minute set mixed it up, with gospel fervor here, a laid-back ballad there, an R&B shouter working out James Brown's \"Sex Machine\" over there.\n\nAfter Sir Walt's second set of material, and the band change-over, the headliner took control. An animated, expressive Scott launched right in with a smoldering \"Shame,\" the new single from her fourth and latest studio disc, \"The Light of the Sun.\" The band was rich, a little more showy and sparkling than Hamilton's rootsier sound, vamping an entrance for the singer to saunter out in thigh-high black leather boots, tight mini-dress and a wig of curly hair almost as full and impressive as her voice.\n\nShe worked some slow blues, then tripped into a rapid, almost rapped \"Quick,\" also from the new disc, an almost a cappella rendition that closed with the band falling in behind. The lyrics seem to be about her romance with former band drummer Li'l John Roberts, which ended just months after their son was born: \"Had a lot of women on you/didn't like the fact that I wanted to own you/that's what you said to me/said that I wanted to lock you down but/you moved into my house/gave me a son.\"\n\nHamilton returned to the stage to join Scott on their duet \"So In Love,\" which came out in April, hitting No. 43 on release, making it the highest-debuting single of Scott's career. Although a thoroughly modern hyphenate star — an actor and poet in addition to singer — Scott also seemed at times to be channeling the '70s classics, perhaps a Rufus-era Chaka Kahn with a trace of balladeering smoothness more like Sade or jazz greats such as Sarah Vaughn."
