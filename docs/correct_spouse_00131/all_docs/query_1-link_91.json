        "text": "Jill Scott is really feeling golden now!\n\nIn nearly two years, the Grammy-winning singer, 39, has shed 63 pounds at her own pace.\n\n\"I'd walk up nine steps and be out of breath!\" reminisces the 5-foot-6 star in the new issue of Us Weekly, out now. Scott, (whose new album, The Light of the Sun, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 this week), weighed 263 pounds pre-slim down. \"But I'll never be a stick figure.\"\n\nSo what stemmed the star's weight loss? Giving birth to her son, Jett, in April 2009. \"There's a world of discovery in his eyes, and I want to be around to enjoy it!\" she says. (Jett is the first child for Scott and her ex, drummer Lil' John Roberts, whom she split with in June 2009.)\n\nHer healthy lifestyle now consists of three low-fat meals and two snacks per day in addition to 60-minute cardio and strength-training sessions three times a week with L.A. pro Scott Parker.\n\n\"We have fun!\" she says about their routine of kickboxing, boxing, and her favorite â€” biking outdoors, which she brings Jett along for."
