Read more here:\n\nLil' John Roberts on WTS Drums\n\nWho is Lil' John Roberts?\n\nLil' John Roberts on WTS Drums\n\nFor the past year, Lil' John Roberts has been playing a WTS Artistry Series™ 3-piece drum kit and snare, which feature the innovative WTS single-point tuning system.\n\nJohn had this to say about his experience playing the WTS drums:\n\nWTS Drums aren't like any drumset I've ever played before! The craftsmanship is A1, and the technology behind the tuning system is mind blowing! Imagine a drum that has a tuning key like an upright bass! You can go from high to low in seconds! Wow! Every drummer should have a kit.\n\nWhen WTS artist Andrew Marsh first gifted Lil' John a WTS Artistry Series Snare in May 2021, John posted this great video and preliminary review:\n\n# Repost John Roberts ・・・This wired tension drum design is ridiculous! And @wtsdrums has a full set like this snare drum that you can tune the same way! You can go from a high pitch to low within seconds during a show or in the studio! Thanks to WTS DRUMS and my buddy @drumsrdrew for sending me this piece of art to check out. I'm totally blown away by it's capabilities! Great job guys! Go and order you one of these! Or even a whole kit!\n\nLil' John has since gone on to use the WTS demo kit and snare in live shows, recordings, drum lessons, and more.\n\n(Read more great reviews of WTS drums here!)\n\nWho is Lil' John Roberts?\n\nLil' John Roberts' impressive career began at a young age in Philadelphia, where he quickly became noted as a child prodigy, playing alongside Christian McBride and Joey DeFranceso at age 16.
