First trimester! You're sick every morning. It was seven hours time difference, the heat, the bugs, the 14 hour days.\"\n\nStill, the actress, who is engaged to drummer Lil' John Roberts, says she's glad she went through with the plans to film. \"My doctors gave me a clean bill of health and said you can do this, so I did it.\"\n\nScott, 36, is a three-time Grammy Award winner and star of the 2007 Tyler Perry film Why Did I Get Married? http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20251479,00.html\n\nit was yesterday, lol. Celeb's move fast. so many fall in and out of love so darn fast u can't keep up.\n\nReally though, having babies are a precious thing, especially when you are ready and are not going at it alone.\n\nMy congrats to mom to be and dad to be."
