        "text": "John Roberts was hired in January 2022 as the LIU football co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\n\nRoberts spent 2020-21 as a senior defensive analyst at Penn State.\n\nRoberts previously spent 2015 through '19 at Arkansas, initially as a offensive quality control coach and later as senior defensive analyst,\n\nRoberts helped coach a wide receiver group that totaled more than 4,000 yards and 40 touchdown receptions over the 2015 and 2016 seasons. That group included Drew Morgan, who produced the third- and fourth-best receiving seasons in school history, in 2015 and 2016. Morgan also led the SEC with 10 touchdown catches during the 2015 regular season.\n\nPrior to Arkansas, Roberts served as a quality control coach and graduate assistant at Central Michigan from 2010 through '14.\n\nIn 2014, Roberts assisted a Central Michigan offense that ranked third in the MAC and 18th nationally in pass efficiency (149.55) and led the MAC in time of possession (33:24). Central Michigan won seven games and advanced to its second bowl game in three years — the 2014 Bahamas Bowl.\n\nRoberts served as an offensive graduate assistant for Central Michigan during the 2012 season. Wide receiver Cody Wilson finished his career with 42 consecutive games with a reception and running back Zurlon Tipton rushed for 1,492 yards, ranking him fourth in the school’s record book. The Chippewas won the Little Caesars Bowl, the third bowl victory in program history.\n\nRoberts was a four-year letterwinner at wide receiver at Alma College, where he never had a losing season during his career."
