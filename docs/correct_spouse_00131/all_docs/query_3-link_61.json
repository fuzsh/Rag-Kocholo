        "text": "Last week, finding himself furious at the court’s per curiam decision to hold off on deciding a big abortion case about the kinds of miscarriage care states may withhold from pregnant women in emergency rooms, Justice Samuel Alito excoriated his colleagues for punting. In his view, as he put it—in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch—the ​court’s “about-face” on taking, then running away from, the EMTALA abortion case was “baffling” because “nothing legally relevant has occurred” since the court granted an emergency stay in January and plonked itself into a dispute before it went through the appeals process. It was an easy case, he sniffed. Many amicus briefs had been filed, he huffed. Why had the court balked at the last minute? Thinking. Thinking. Then: “Apparently,” he hypothesized, “the Court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents.”\n\nThat’s right. The majority of the court (and all of its females) found the issue too “emotional” to do the hard work of denying women in acute medical emergencies abortion care.\n\nHad he given his word choice 10 seconds’ further thought (or even conferred with his wife, who is by all accounts “fond of flags”), Alito might have taken out that “emotional” crack before attacking Amy Coney Barrett’s defection in this matter, in the time between the accidental release of the draft decision and its final publication the next day. He did not.\n\nIt’s gross, but not unexpected, that often when the court fractures along gender lines, as it has frequently this term, you will hear a whole lot of the jovial “Calm down, little missy” talk that you might recall from 1950s sitcoms.\n\nIt is nevertheless pretty jarring to hear that kind of condescension trotted out by Chief Justice John Roberts, in the democracy-altering immunity decision handed down Monday. The court granted itself the imperial authority to confer upon the president powers of a king, but although Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said as much in their respective dissents, it fell to Big Daddy Chief Justice Roberts to intone to his readers that their aggregated dissents strike “a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.” Implying that the dissenters were overreacting, and without ever attempting to address the substance of their claims, Roberts accused them of “fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals about a future where the President ‘feels empowered to violate federal criminal law.’ ”\n\n“Our dissenting colleagues exude an impressive infallibility,” writes Roberts, like a girls soccer coach. “While their confidence may be inspiring, the Court adheres to time-tested practices instead—deciding what is required to dispose of this case.” Hate the player, change the game.\n\nIn brushing past the district court opinion written by Judge Tanya Chutkan and the thorough, 57-page appellate opinion joined by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Pan, and J. Michelle Childs, the chief justice manages to malign their work product too: “Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, and the very significant constitutional questions that it raises, the lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited basis.” Shorter Roberts? Really hard to find good help these days.\n\nOn CNN, Donald Trump’s former White House counsel Ty Cobb coughed up the same critique of Sotomayor. “Her dissent was a little hysterical, and it really offered no analysis,” he said. “A lot of screaming, no analysis. And I think that was unfortunate.”\n\nScreaming. Insubstantial. Hysterical. What men call banshees, women call prophecy. And of course if there are any sitting justices on the Roberts court whose entire jurisprudence can be reduced to a soggy skein of hurt feelings and self-pity, they are not females.\n\nThe accounts of Sotomayor’s oral dissent as read from the bench Monday morning make clear that the dynamic was absolutely in evidence: She added interpolations that were not in her printed text and all but castigated her conservative colleagues. This is what frustration embodied looks like. And the failure to take that respectfully or even seriously? That is a play as old as the hills.\n\nThe hysteria talk has been going on for years, and “Roe is never going to be overturned” was an article of faith for many, for so long, up to and including the Dobbs leak. In the event you’ve forgotten how many men called how many women “hysterical” when Donald Trump seated Supreme Court justices who were preselected to overturn Roe, Laura Bassett had a rundown:\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) … in voting to confirm Kavanaugh in 2018 … insisted that Kavanaugh had assured her Roe was “settled law,” and she characterized women’s concerns about abortion rights as “over-the-top rhetoric and distortions,” despite the fact that Kavanaugh’s record extremely, obviously pointed toward overturning Roe. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) quite literally called women “hysterical” for sounding the alarm about Roe during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings: “People are going to pretend that Americans have no historical memory, and supposedly there haven’t been screaming protesters saying, ‘Women are going to die,’ at every hearing for decades,” Sasse told Kavanaugh. “So the fact that the hysteria has nothing to do with you means that we should ask: What’s the hysteria coming from?”\n\nAt this point the gaslighting is rote: women voicing fears about women’s outcomes is “fearmongering” and “hysteria.” These are the words you use for the thing you normally call warnings when they come from women. As my friend Rebecca Traister warned after the fall of Roe, accusing other people of hysteria and overreaction is sometimes more a failure of imagination than anything else. It is abundantly clear that Roberts is not even willing to engage with Sotomayor and Jackson on the merits because the cheap-shot name-calling stands in for analysis in his new MAGA-inflected jurisprudence.\n\nBecause Roberts failed to address the hypotheticals raised by the dissenters on their own terms, picking off bits and pieces of their warnings without engaging seriously, one is left to wonder whether they maybe were overreacting after all. Perhaps Roberts’ bloodless and unconcerned recitation of the facts of Jan. 6, 2021, is all that happened:\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted him on four counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the November 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after losing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election results.\n\nOr perhaps Sotomayor’s version better captures the events of the day:\n\nSpeaking to that crowd on January 6, Trump “falsely claimed that, based on fraud, the Vice President could alter the outcome of the election results.” When this crowd then “violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding,” Trump allegedly delayed in taking any step to rein in the chaos he had unleashed. Instead, in a last desperate ploy to hold onto power, he allegedly “attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol” by pressuring lawmakers to delay the certification of the election and ultimately declare him the winner.\n\nIf you opt to believe that this is an anodyne case about abstract separation-of-power questions, Sotomayor’s version perhaps appears breathless. If you consider that people died across the street from the high court that day because insurrectionists stormed the Capitol, Roberts’ version appears to border on the delusional. But although Roberts cannot bring himself to even imagine the thing that actually happened in 2021, Sotomayor just can’t blind herself to it. And it’s because she understands what really happened and how it can happen again that she is viscerally affronted at the double denialism: What you saw with your own eyes didn’t occur, and what we have now authorized with our own pens can never happen.\n\nYou know who understands full well what happens when the full power of the state is conscripted into an effort to belittle and degrade women? Donald Trump. He used those powers to commit election offenses in order to silence Stormy Daniels; he used those powers to turn crowds of his fans against Nancy Pelosi and her husband. He used those powers to seat three justices who would make it their life-tenured duty to harm women in service of protecting fetal personhood. Weaponizing the power of government to hurt women and other marginalized communities is the beating heart of Project 2025. Immediately after the immunity decision came down, Trump celebrated it with a Truth Social post singling out Liz Cheney, former Wyoming congresswoman and impeachment effort leader, calling for her to be prosecuted by way of military tribunal. “Elizabeth Lynne Cheney is guilty of treason,” the post read. “Retruth if you want televised military tribunals.”"
