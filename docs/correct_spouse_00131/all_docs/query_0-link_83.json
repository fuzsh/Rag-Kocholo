        "text": "Jill Scott was nearly 40 when she welcomed her son, Jett Hamilton Roberts, and revealed her pregnancy had been a shock. The actress and her partner went their separate ways after their son was born, but the Hollywood star said she never felt like a single parent thanks to her friends and family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter giving up hope that she would ever have kids one day, Jill Scott welcomed a beautiful and healthy baby boy with her former partner at 37, following a difficult pregnancy and birth.\n\nThe actress has since raised a handsome teenager with his \"village\" of family members and friends to thank, as they helped bring him up to be a kind person following his parent's separation.\n\nJill Scott and Jett Hamilton Roberts at the 6th Annual Brittiana \"Smile For Life\" Run/Walk on May 14, 2011, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nJill Scott Was Told She Would Not Be Able to Have Kids\n\nAfter announcing that she was pregnant, Jill recalled her reaction to the news she was expecting and revealed that learning she was pregnant came as a \"shock.\" The actress added:\n\n\"I didn't think it was possible for me to have kids because I was told I couldn't conceive. I had given up hope of becoming a mother one day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott Opened Up about Her Difficult Pregnancy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill was booked to travel to Africa to shoot the HBO series \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" when she learned she was pregnant. And during an interview, the star revealed her first trimester was difficult.\n\n\"The first trimester I spent in Botswana. That was one of the biggest challenges of my life. First trimester! You're sick every morning. It was seven hours time difference, the heat, the bugs, the 14-hour days,\" the actress said.\n\nHowever, it proved all worth it, as in April 2009, Jill's manager confirmed that the singer and her then-fianc√© ‚Äî drummer Lil Jon Roberts ‚Äî welcomed a healthy baby boy. Jett was born weighing seven pounds and eight ounces at 4:20 p.m. on April 20, a few days before Jill's expected due date on April 25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott Proved Her Son Is All Grown up in an Instagram Post\n\nIn August 2022, Jett was his mother's plus-one to actress and producer Marsai Martin's 18th birthday party, themed Marsai's Kingdom of Far Far Away. And in the photos Jill shared on social media, Jett looked all grown up as he posed for the camera.\n\nJett and his mother were dressed to the nines in the first slide and completed their outfits with crowns. In the second slide, Jett posed for a picture with \"Bel-Air\" star Jabari Banks and the birthday girl donning a red gown.\n\nJett has been a regular on his mother's Instagram page over the years, as in 2018, Jill pulled at fans' heartstrings when she shared a snap of Jett resting on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Jill documented the mother-son duo's travels before taking a trip down memory lane with a throwback of her and Jett and shared in part:\n\n\"I like this boyüòÅ. His ear is magnificent scary. I'm impressed with his kindness and how romantic about The Creator he is. I appreciate his encouragement and his honesty. The boy is deep! [...].\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2020, Jill celebrated her son's 11th birthday with a collage of Jett's pictures, commemorated National Son Day with snaps of her son over the years, and captioned the post:\n\n\"I thought I was terminally ill. All of a sudden, sleeping for 15 hrs straight blew my mind. I felt like the world was wopsided. I prepared for the worst but Jehovah gave me THE BEST surprise ever. #nationalsonsday #proudmom\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Scott on Not Feeling like a Single Parent despite Parting Ways with Her Son's Father\n\nJett's actress mother and drummer father separated shortly after he was born. Still, during an interview, his famous mother revealed that she never considered herself a single parent.\n\nJill Scott had family and friends who loved her and Jett and helped to raise him into a kind and genuine person with a great work ethic. \"I was blessed to have a village [...] to assist in every way,\" Jill said."
