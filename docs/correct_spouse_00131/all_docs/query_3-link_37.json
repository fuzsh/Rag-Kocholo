This is a flagrant conflict of interest. \n\nIt follows a series of other recent ethics breakdowns at the Supreme Court. Two other justices (Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch) did not disclose they had sold property to persons who had matters on the court's docket. Thomas took luxury vacations with a billionaire Republican donor. All nine justices refuse to adhere to ethics guidelines applicable to all other federal judges; they also maintain a little-known court charity that allows litigants with active cases to make large donations. A major donor to the court's charity was none other than Chevron. That happened as the company's unprecedented private prosecution and detention of me was being considered by the justices.\n\nThe Supreme Court's members appear incapable of policing themselves. Congress must act. Read more via the article at the link in bio.\".",
