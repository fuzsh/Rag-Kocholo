        "text": "Sometimes love doesn’t last forever. Jill Scott and her husband, Mike Dobson, have reportedly split after just 15 months of marriage, according to a report from Bossip. The Lady of Soul reportedly filed for divorce on Sept. 15, citing “inappropriate marital conduct.”\n\nUnder Tennessee state law, “inappropriate marital conduct” includes cruel treatment, infidelity, verbal or physical abuse or sexual indecency. While it is still unclear what may have occurred in the estranged couple’s household, the divorce petition suggest that “such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper,” Bossip reports.\n\nScott has always been private about her marital life, but Dobson released a statement to Bossip, saying that he was completely “blindsided by” his estranged wife filing for divorce. Although he admitted that he agreed to a separation, he assumed they were still going to work on their relationship. “She’s an evil woman,” Dobson told Bossip. “I’m telling you. It’s like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets. People are in her ear, and if someone comes in to challenge the dumb s**t, they made me be the bad guy and that got me outta there.”\n\nDobson suggested that Scott has an issue with control. “She likes to emasculate men – that’s her problem,” Dobson explained. “I told her, she’s from Philly, but I’m from New York, and if you want to try to disgrace me, try to slander me, I can fight dirty.”\n\nScott was previously married to Lyzel Williams in 2001. She was also engaged to musician Lil John Roberts at one point. Dobson explained that his ex has a pattern of trying to sabotage reputations, but he will not be defeated. “She’s made other men look bad, but I’m not the one,” he continued. “I said [to her], you’ve met your match. She likes to have men that she can control. You’re not gonna control me. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.”\n\nScott and Dobson initially wed in June 2016. Their separation date was reportedly listed as Sept. 5, and court documents confirm that they are living in separate households, according to Bossip. Jill Scott has not responded to the divorce reports.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
