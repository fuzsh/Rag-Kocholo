Check out her new single “So In Love” featuring Anthony Hamilton.\n\nThe concert, sponsored by the Budweiser Superfest, will feature soul singer Hamilton and Mint Condition as the opening acts, while DJ Jazzy Jeff will spin the beats and Doug E.

Anthony Hamilton ” So In Love”” →\n\n[HTML1]\n\nJill Scott was on “The Today Show” Wednesday and discussed the joys of motherhood and her new movie, “Why Did I Get Married Too?,” which premieres April 2. The Grammy winner also shared that she will be dropping her new album, “The Light of the Sun” this year.\n\nSoul singer Jill Scott is being sued by her record label, Hidden Beach Records. In a lawsuit filed recently in a Los Angeles court, the record company claims that the 37-year-old artist owes them three more studio albums. Scott signed a six-album contract deal more than 10 years ago and has released the double-platinum Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1 in 2000; the gold-certified Beautifully Human: Words and Sounds Vol. 2 in 2004; and the gold-certified The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3 in 2007.\n\nScott has released an additional two live CDs and a compilation album. But live CDs aren’t typically considered by music industry standards as fulfilling an artist’s contract, reports AOL Black Voices.\n\nScott released the following statement regarding the lawsuit.\n\n“The lawsuit filed on February 3, 2010 by Hidden Beach Recordings against Jill Scott has no legal merit and misrepresents the history of Ms. Scott’s relationship with the label. Jill Scott has the legal right to terminate her recording contract with Hidden Beach Recordings under California’s 7-year rule, where she had been a recording artist for more than 10 years. During her time at Hidden Beach Recordings, she released several highly successful albums. At this time, with many creative projects in the works which include music, film and television roles and product development, Ms. Scott looks forward to continuing to further her artistry and building the Jill Scott brand in other creative environments.”\n\nOn Monday, singer Jill Scott and her fiance drummer Lil John Roberts welcomed their first child, a baby boy. Jett Hamilton Roberts was born at 4:20 p.m. on April 20 and weighed 7 lbs., 8 oz.\n\nAfter years of being unable to conceive, Scott said she discovered that she was pregnant right before leaving to film her HBO series, “The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,” in Botswana.\n\n“At one point I was trying to gain weight for the role, and I noticed I had put on 7 lbs. in 7 days. And I thought, my god! What’s going on here,” she tells PEOPLE. “I thought something was wrong with me, and I found out I was pregnant the day I was supposed to leave for Africa.”\n\nJill Scott, 36, is expecting her first child, which is due April 25th. She is engaged to drummer Lil John Roberts. Scott said she discovered she was pregnant right before going to Botswana to film her new HBO series The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, based on the popular novels by Alexander McCall Smith, People magazine reported.\n\n“The first trimester I spent in Botswana,” Scott told reporters at the Television Critics Association conference. “That was one of the biggest challenges of my life. First trimester! You’re sick every morning. It was seven hours time difference, the heat, the bugs, the 14 hour days.”"
