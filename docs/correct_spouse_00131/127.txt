American actress Jill Scott has reportedly split from her husband after just 15 months of marriage.

The 45-year-old Grammy winner filed for divorce on September 15 from her 49-year-old ex-Mike Dobson.

According to her divorce petition, the actress cited “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct that such further cohabitation would be unsafe and improper,”

However, Scott’s estranged husband Dobson told BOSSIP that the actress was being untruthful about the “inappropriate marital conduct” saying he was “blindsided” by Scott’s divorce filing.

He said: “She’s an evil woman. I’m telling you. It’s like what Jill Scott wants, Jill Scott gets. People are in her ear, and if someone comes in to challenge the dumb s**t, they made me be the bad guy and that got me outta there.

“She’s got issues. There’s no men in that family, there’s only women. And when a man comes in, it’s like a challenge.

“She’s made other men look bad, but I’m not the one. I said (to her) ‘you’ve met your match. She likes to have men that she can control. You’re not gonna control me. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.”

“She likes to emasculate men – that’s her problem. I told her, she’s from Philly, but I’m from New York, and if you want to try to disgrace me, try to slander me, I can fight dirty,” Dobson said.

The couple wed in an intimate ceremony in June 2016 in Tennessee. They have no children.

Scott was previously married to Lyzel Williams from 2001 to 2007. She was also once engaged to musician Lil John Roberts, and the pair has a son, Jett.
