        "text": "\"Thanks for today Amanda, the penny has really dropped in so many aspects of how I will be operating from here on in.\" As a coach, this is the kind of message that I love to receive. This message is from a professional artist who, despite successes, experience and knowledge, wasn't getting the cut-through she was after. Opening up to coaching - even though she was already a professional artist with experience and knowledge - gave her insights she hadn't seen before, which gave her new ways to expand and finally get that cut-through she was after. Sometimes what you need is another way of seeing. Would you like to have a chat?

If you are, then you'll probably totally get that sentence! You have the kind of profession which is not seen as an 'essential service' I'm talking about creators, healers, alternative practices - passion led, truly soulful businesses. YOU are the person I want to help. From the clients I have most enjoyed working with over the last couple of years, conversations with my daughter, several artist friends and the discussions with @the_strategyhub following our recent workshop, I feel that I really want to specialise in empowering creative/alternative businesses. There are so many hugely talented people not getting the recognition they deserve. As a brand photographer, that frustrates me. As a human being, it saddens me. So I'd like to hear from you about how I ( and a few wonderful collaboratives ) can help with what you are struggling with most. The more I /we can understand about your business's pain points, the better we can serve you and others in a similar situation. If you are a creative or alternative business owner, keen to get your unique service out there but feeling a bit stuck, please drop me a message. Let's not ever 'get a proper job' üòÜ Let's work together to change the notion of what that actually is! #alternative #healers #artists #musicians #independents #smallbusinesssowner #brandingcreatives #londonbusinessowner\n\nüí° Sometimes, entrepreneurs can be too trusting of their business partners. üõë This often results in verbal or handshake agreements. üí°If you've been following me for a while you know how I feel about verbal and handshake agreements‚Äîdon't do it! üí° Entrepreneurs NEED contracts in place. üí° Why contracts are important to entrepreneurs? üëáüèø ‚úÖ Sets expectations between the parties. ‚úÖ Helps to eliminate misunderstandings & reduce risks. ‚úÖ Clearly outlines what the parties agreed to. ‚úÖ Establishes how disputes will be handled. ‚úÖ Helps to protect all that they are investing in their business. ‚úÖ Clarifies that the liability is that of the business and not personal to the owner. üí°Did you also know that entering into a business is the essentially the same as a marriage contract (without the adult activity, please don't do that)? If you didn't know, now you do. üíé Want to learn more about business contracts and how entering into business can be the same as marriage? If so, comment üíçbelow üëáüèø. #trademarks #trademark #copyright #copyrights #contracts #intellectualproperty #infringement #cannabis #cbd #hemp #beer #tobacco #alcohol\n\nIn a new episode of The Art Law Podcast, Katie and Steve talk with renowned art lawyer Pierre Valentin about the EU‚Äôs new and striking import regulations on cultural goods, including fine art and cultural property, that prohibit the import of applicable items not created in the EU into the EU if they cannot be shown to have been legally exported from their countries of origin. They discuss the impetus for these regulations, the problem with discerning ownership and export history of cultural property, and the key problems with the new regulation‚Äôs successful implementation and enforcement.

Do you think such laws enhance or hinder the overall beach experience? \"The argument of whether they should be policed is a complex one. On the one hand, these pseudo-entrepreneurs are made up of mostly migrants simply trying to make ends meet. Like excellent capitalists, they‚Äôve identified a demand in the market (beer on the beach) and simply service that gap. On the other hand, they take away business from the registered sellers of these goods‚Äîin this case, alcohol from mini-marts and beach bars. The registered business owners are subject to licenses for distribution and selling, taxes, and health codes.\" Want to read more?
