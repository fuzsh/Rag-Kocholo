        "text": "What’s in a name? Quite a bit, if you’re the newest daughter of Fernando Fitz-James Stuart of Spain and wife Sofía Palazuelo.\n\nThe baby girl in question is the younger daughter of the 17th Duke of Huéscar, and she was born in January. Earlier this month, her full name was revealed at her christening ceremony, according to El Pais: Sofía Fernanda Dolores Cayetana Teresa Ángela de la Cruz Micaela del Santísimo Sacramento del Perpetuo Socorro de la Santísima Trinidad y de Todos Los Santos.\n\nIt’s too long, according to local law.\n\nAccording to a translation by People, the law on names in Boletín Oficial del Estado states that “In the registration, the name given to the child will be expressed, although no more than one compound name may be recorded, nor more than two simple ones.”\n\nThe little baby and her big name are in honor of Fernando’s late grandmother, the Duchess of Alba, who was the most-titled person in the world when she died in 2014. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, she held 57 titles through heritage and marriage: “She is 14 times a Spanish grandee, 5 times a duchess, once a countess-duchess, 18 times a marchioness, 18 times a countess and once a viscountess.”\n\nThe couple has one other daughter, 2-year-old Rosario Matilde Sofía Cayetana Dolores Teresa.\n\nThe couple wed in 2018 and welcomed their first daughter in 2021. The toddler Rosario is expected to one day inherit the title of Duchess of Alba, and her father, Fernando, is set to inherit 50 titles from his father when he is eventually named Duke of Alba.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s DYNASTY podcast now.\n\nRoyals\n\nThe Truth About Meghan, Harry, and Their California Dream\n\nOn a new episode of DYNASTY, Vanity Fair’s hosts take a close look at how the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are coping with some tumultuous years, figuring themselves out, and laying the groundwork for a big future.\n\nRoyals\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William Seek New Private Assistant\n\nKensington Palace is looking to hire a secretary with Welsh language skills to support the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nStyle\n\nInside Kensington Palace: Explore the Royal Family’s Storied Home\n\nKensington Palace may be smaller than nearby Buckingham Palace, but its history is far richer and much more scandalous."
