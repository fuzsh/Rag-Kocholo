        "text": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey impressed Dubliners with their drinking skills in the latest episode of the show.\n\nThe episode continued with footage of the women's cast trip to Ireland, which was filmed in July 2022. Last week, we saw the girls land at Dublin Airport and head to their accommodation at Ballinlough Castle in Co Westmeath, about an hour outside of Dublin City.\n\nThis week's episode kicked off with cast members Dolores Catania, Teresa Giudice, Rachel Fuda, Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Danielle Cabral, Jackie Goldschneider, and Jennifer Fessler in the capital to celebrate Teresa's upcoming nuptials. The ladies were initially at the upscale Café en Seine on Dawson Street, later moving on to the more traditional Sheehan's Pub on Chatham Street.\n\nTo get the best of Irish history, culture, and folklore sent straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletter.\n\nIt was here that Jackie, the group's resident chug champion, challenged the locals to a Guinness drinking contest. A woman named Leslie stepped up to the plate and the pair got to chugging - or as we say in Ireland, necking - their pints.\n\nThe Jersey girl beat out the Irishwoman in downing the stout at an impressive speed, causing the pub to erupt in applause. Jennifer Fessler too put some locals to shame in getting her pint into her faster than they could theirs.\n\nJennifer Aydin also tried her hand at necking a pint of the black stuff but didn't enjoy it quite as much as her co-stars. \"I think I'm gonna throw up,\" she told the group, adding in her confessional that she'll be sticking to tequila in future.\n\nTaking a break from the usual drama and rumor mill, the girls let loose and enjoyed some Baby Guinness shots. For the first time on Housewives TV, drinks were thrown in a fun, light-hearted way that didn't end in a brawl or tears.\n\nThe ladies were a little rough for wear the next morning, but in true Irish fashion, they had a breakfast fry to cure their hangover. They were also introduced to black pudding, which the castle staff described as \"kind of like sausage\".\n\nDolores, whose partner Paul Connell is Irish, explained that the pudding is made from pig's blood, much to her friends' horror.\n\n\"When Paul and I were first dating, he explained to me what the blood pudding was,\" she said in her confessional. \"Well, I wasn't looking forward to eating it. He's got it in the fridge right now, by the way.\"\n\nElsewhere in the episode, the ladies traveled back into the city, hit up the Ha'penny Bridge, and did some shopping. As is standard for Housewives, they got into some quarrels in between, but nothing quite like the fights the Real Housewives of Orange County brought to Dublin in 2016.\n\nDolores, who hosted the Jersey girls' cast trip, previously opened up to IrishStar.com about her relationship with Paul and said she wanted to share his homeland with her friends.\n\n\"Paulie's in my life and he has taken me to Ireland,\" she shared. \"I wanted to share it with everyone because I fell in love with the country, I fell in love with the people.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was the best, best trip, they wanna go back.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nReal Housewives of New Jersey's Dolores Catania spills on Dublin boyfriend Paul and cast trip to Ireland\n\nReal Housewives of New Jersey head to haunted Irish castle in new trailer\n\nFrom the Shore to the Hills: Irish versions of iconic American reality shows\n\nIrish actor on going from being 'a culchie from Tralee' to star of US hits like Criminal Minds"
