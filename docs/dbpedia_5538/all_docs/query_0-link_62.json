        "text": "December 12, 2008\n\nMy darling prairie dogs!\n\nChristmas is keeping me busier than ever! It’s such a challenge fitting holiday duties into my already hectic life, which includes washing my balls for VFW Bingo every Tuesday night and heading up the Monthly Lutheran Panty Boil. That’s where we sanitize gently used panty hose for the starving women in Ethiopia because many of those desert gals do not have adequate access to nylons and other personal hygienic products!\n\nImagine my panic when I received a call from Phyllis Schlanksburg, the activities director at The Arms of Christ and Gates of Concrete Home, our only maximum-security facility for old people in Richfield. It’s a real source of pride for the community as it was recently listed as one of the 10 top places in Minnesota to die.\n\nSo when Phyllis called and needed an angel for the Living Nativity, I stepped right up to the plate and strapped on the wings and halo!\n\nWhat a joyful experience. They call it the “living” nativity because it has a real sheep in the production, along with Santa played by the night-shift janitor. All the other creatures are played by old people off the third floor, who already make animal noises.\n\nI asked Phyllis how she gets that sheep every year and she explained that the good Father Joseph Mary O’Guinness, one of the chaplains at the home, has personal knowledge of a sheep that he provides for the nativity, Easter services, Mother’s Day, Fourth of July, Arbor Day and just about any other special occasion at the home.\n\nWell, meeting Delores was wonderful. You just couldn’t find a nicer, easy-going lady sheep. And Fr O’Guinness knew exactly how to direct and motivate that ewe.\n\nI guess that’s what happens when you work for God!"
