Hope you will get inspiration for your business.\n\nHere Are The 18 Most Creative Spanish Restaurant Names Ever\n\n01. Las Cuevas De Luis Candelas\n\nIt is one of the most ancient restaurants in Madrid, Spain. The restaurant is situated inside the ancient caves. The Spanish restaurant names come from Luis Candelas, the most famous bandit in Madrid. It is believed that the famous bandit robbed rich people in order to feed poor ones. He used to hide inside these caves.\n\nIf you visit this restaurant, you will find waiters wearing the outfits of a bandit. And this is being followed from that time. If you don’t want to spend much of the amount on your meal, then you can order a glass of wine along with a portion of pimientos del padrón and jamón.\n\n02. El Celler De Can Roca\n\nThe restaurant is located in Girona and is rated as the best restaurant worldwide. It is operated by three Roca brothers- Jordi, Joan, and Joseph.\n\nThe restaurant is famous for its 14-course ‘culinary experience’ paired with wines and sherries from the Iberian peninsula.
