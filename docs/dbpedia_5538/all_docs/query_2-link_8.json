        "text": "Baroness Dolores Guinness, the daughter of Franz-Egon von FÃ¼rstenberg-Herdringen and the socialite Gloria Guinness has been on the International Best-Dressed list since the 1970s. Can't you see why? While sitting in the sun in Sardinia in 1965, Guinness managed to make a simple pair of green trousers and a black t-shirt look like couture. Do you like to keep your summer style simple as well?"
