This comes as no surprise, as it seems that nearly everything Stephen King writes is adapted into some sort of film. Many of these adaptions have become iconic horror movies, while some are lesser known. They are based on King’s novels, short stories, novellas, and even on original screenplays.\n\nIn honor of some exciting new adaptions on the horizon, we decided to run down our favorite Stephen King writings that have been adapted for the small and big screen.

The film, which starred Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, was nominated for 7 Oscars.\n\nDifferent Seasons\n\nStephen King\n\n“You’ll find the themes of hope and innocence weaved throughout the four novellas that comprise Stephen King’s DIFFERENT SEASONS, warped and broken as they may seem. The ways in which they’re tested, sustained, mangled, or transformed are often uncomfortable but always captivating.”\n\nRead the full review by Amar Deol here.\n\nMENTIONED IN:\n\nClose\n\nCarrie\n\nby Stephen King\n\nStephen King’s legendary debut novel follows Carrie White, a bullied high school girl who discovers she has telekinetic powers and famously uses them to enact horrific revenge against her tormenters at the prom. It was adapted into a film in 2013, but I vastly prefer the 1976 version starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie. This original adaption is considered a landmark film in the horror genre.\n\nCarrie\n\nStephen King\n\nCarrie White may have been unfashionable and unpopular, but in the face of unbearable humiliation, her gift of telepathy is turned into a weapon of horror and destruction that her classmates would never forget.
