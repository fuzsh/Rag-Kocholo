        "text": "On the April 4 episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Dolores Catania shared that after experiencing “the most beautiful trip ever” with Paul “Paulie” Connell in Ireland, she wanted to go back with her castmates, and the ladies were quick to show their enthusiasm for the idea.\n\n“I am down,” Danielle Cabral said, while Margaret Josephs declared, “I am so excited. I can’t wait to go.”\n\nBefore the group’s departure on the show’s April 11 episode, Dolores opened up about her mixed feelings about planning the trip. “I’m excited to play tour guide for my friends,” she said in an interview. “But I’m dealing with some picky bitches right now… I have all these Irish activities all set, but don’t think I’m not nervous about it.” However, once the group finally arrived, there was no shortage of stunning sites, delicious food, fun drinks, and memorable activities.\n\nBelow, get a detailed guide of everything The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast members did throughout their incredible trip to Ireland.\n\nWhere the New Jersey Housewives Stayed in Ireland:\n\nFor the entirety of the trip, the group stayed in the 10,800-square-foot Ballinlough Castle, located in the Irish countryside. The nine-bedroom, seven-bathroom castle was built in the 17th century and sits on 300 acres of grassland. According to its website, the stunning property is just one hour from Dublin.\n\nWhere the RHONJ Cast Ate & Drank in Ireland:\n\nOn the show’s April 11 episode, the ladies kicked off Teresa Giudice’s bachelorette celebrations with a dinner at Café en Seine in Dublin. “This is pretty,” Margaret said as they walked in, to which Dolores added, “So nice.” The group started with cocktails and wine, ordering espresso martinis, dirty martinis, cosmopolitans, and Whispering Angel rosé. They also snacked on dishes such as crispy chicken wings, guacamole, and chips.\n\nThey kept the party going on the April 18 episode at Sheehan’s Pub, where they took plenty of shots and challenged locals to Guinness drinking contests.\n\nThe next day after some shopping (more on that below), they enjoyed lunch at Little Pyg. After ordering a variety of drinks, including Guinness, margaritas, amaretto sours, and sauvignon blanc, they ate dishes such as a pear, walnut, and gorgonzola salad; two pizzas; an avocado and prawn salad; and a chicken panini. That night, they headed to Luvida tapas bar, where they once again ordered a wide range of beverages and ate dishes including chicken satay and Korean fried chicken.\n\nThe group had multiple amazing meals in their castle, including a brunch where the ladies learned about black pudding (also known as blood pudding or blood sausage). \"When Paul and I were first dating, he explained to me what the blood pudding was,\" Dolores shared in an interview. \"I wasn't looking forward to eating it. He's got it in the refrigerator right now, by the way.\"\n\nThe Sites the New Jersey Housewives Saw in Ireland:\n\nDuring a day of exploring Dublin, the group stopped on the Ha'penny Bridge. Dolores explained, “You make a wish here for an eternity to be together.”\n\nWhere the RHONJ Cast Shopped in Ireland:\n\nOf course, it wouldn’t be a Housewives trip without a bit of shopping. On the April 18 episode, Danielle and Jennifer Aydin went to The Design House, while many of the other ladies strolled around Powerscourt Centre. “Powerscourt has beautiful gardens and things,” Dolores shared before she browsed items in MoMuse jewelry store with several other cast members."
