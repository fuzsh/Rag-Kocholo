        "text": "“For the Costa Smeralda, we want to use everything we can that is authentically Sardinian”\n\n— Prince Karim Aga Khan\n\nPrince Karim Aga Khan was born on December 13, 1936, in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nHe is the eldest son of Prince Aly Khan (1911–1960 — whom we already mentioned in the Adorable Story #48), and his first wife, Princess Taj-ud-dawlah Aga Khan — formerly Joan Yarde-Buller (1908–1997).\n\nDespite being born premature, he was in good health. His younger brother, Amyn Aga Khan, arrived shortly before his first birthday.\n\nHis parents divorced in 1949 and Prince Aly Khan promptly remarried, this time to the American actress Rita Hayworth, with whom he fathered Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, making her Prince Karim’s half-sister.\n\nAdditionally, Karim Aga Khan had a half-brother, Patrick Benjamin Guinness, from his mother Joan Yarde-Buller’s previous marriage to Loel Guinness, a member of the prominent banking family.\n\nIf you aren’t subscribed yet, hit the subscribe button below to receive the Adorable Stories every weekend, directly in your inbox:\n\nEarly years\n\nPrince Karim’s early years were spent in Nairobi, Kenya, where he received education through private tutors. He then proceeded to Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland, known for being one of the world’s most prestigious boarding schools, and he completed his education there with moderate success.\n\nDespite an initial desire to pursue science at MIT, his grandfather Aga Khan III directed him towards Harvard University. At Harvard, he joined The Delphic Club and focused on Islamic history, eventually earning his Bachelor of Arts with Cum Laude honours in 1959.\n\nThe death of his grandfather in 1957 abruptly made Prince Karim the Aga Khan IV, taking on the religious title of Mawlānā Hazar Imam when he was still an university student.\n\nHe described the experience as a total life transformation, waking up to immense responsibilities for millions and forgoing his plan to earn a doctorate in History. Besides his academic achievements, he also excelled in sports, particularly as a competitive downhill skier: he even represented Iran in the 1964 Winter Olympics, demonstrating his proficiency in the sport.\n\nThe Creation of Costa Smeralda"
