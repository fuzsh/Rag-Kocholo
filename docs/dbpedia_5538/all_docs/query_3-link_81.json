Sharing in everyday culture and identity, as well as ancestry, human presence on the Emerald Isle dates back some 12,500 years, according to archaeological studies.\n\nOver the centuries, Ireland has seen much change, with invasion by the Anglo-Normans in the 12th century, followed by British colonisation in the 16th/17th century – moments which significantly shaped our history. And, more so, dynamised the tapestry of Irish DNA, bringing greater numbers of English and lowland-Scot inhabitants to Ireland.\n\nToday, the island is made up of the Republic of Ireland (an independent country) and Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom). Those who live in the north of the country may hold various national identities, including Irish, Northern Irish, and British.\n\nIreland and its culture are known world-over. From its love for traditional art forms, including Irish dancing and trad music, its affinity for a creamy pint of Guinness, or its endless stream of iconic artists, including Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker, Ireland is a small country with a big personality.\n\nWhereas once the Irish people mainly spoke Irish (Gaelic/Gaeilge) – the indigenous language – English is now the primary language. However, Ireland considers itself a dual speaking country, so visitors can expect to see both English and Irish on public service signs and announcements.\n\nIrish surnames; roots and genealogy\n\nIn its conception, Ireland was made up of kin groups or clans. Additionally, Ireland had its own religion, law code, alphabet, and even a style of dress.\n\nToday some 6.7 million people live on the Emerald Isle. However, a whopping 50 to 80 million people around the globe are thought to share in Irish ancestry.\n\nThe mass exodus from Ireland has been a result of famine, war, and conflict throughout Ireland’s history. And, those of Irish descent can be found mainly in English-speaking countries, including Great Britain, the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nArgentina, Mexico, and New Zealand also have large numbers of Irish descendants. The largest number of Irish descendants reside in the United States, while in Australia, those with Irish ancestry account for a higher percentage of the population than in any other country, except Ireland.\n\nWidespread and woven into many different cultures around the globe, Irish surnames are ever-present today.\n\nREAD ALSO: 50 shocking facts about Ireland you probably didn’t know\n\nYour questions answered about Irish surnames\n\nIf you’ve still got some unanswered questions about Irish surnames, you’re in luck!
