        "text": "When people think of Irish music, one of two extremes come to mind: the super-traditional songs with fiddles and tin whistles, or the modern, Celtic punk songs with rock guitars and driving beats. A truly great St. Patrick’s Day song playlist would have room for both of these — and everything in between, including past Eurovision winners, teen pop from the ‘00s, popular hits that topped the charts for weeks on end and obscure classics that deserve their time in the spotlight.\n\nThese best Irish songs are perfect to listen to when you want the flavor of the Emerald Isle (or Boston, or New York City, depending upon your musical mood). It has your wouldn’t-be-an-Irish-playlist without them faves, like The Dubliners, The Wolfe Tones, Thin Lizzy and, of course, U2, as well as those under-the-radar bands. It has songs that are associated with one powerhouse performer (hello, Sinéad), as well as tunes that are some timeless they’ve been covered again and again. There are folk songs, punk songs, pop songs and ballads. Blast them on March 17, hoist a homemade green beer, and get ready to dance (and no, it doesn’t have to be a jig).\n\nLooking for more ways to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day? Check out these Good Housekeeping Guides:\n\nBest Irish Movies | St. Patrick’s Day Traditions | St. Patrick’s Day Foods\n\n\"Dirty Old Town\" — The Pogues\n\nThe Pogues may be an unusual way to kick off an St. Paddy's playlist. The Celtic punk band is best known for \" ,\" a Christmas song rather than a St. Patrick's Day song — and one that takes place on the wrong side of the pond. \"Dirty Old Town\" is closer to home, but it was actually written by Englishman Ewan MacColl, who memorialized his hometown of Salford, near Manchester, England. (To this day, the Pogues' version of the song is the walk-on music for Salford City FC.) But the 1949 folk song is associated with many Irish artists, including and U2, and it's especially poignant to listen to this year after the death of Pogues' frontman Shane MacGowan in 2023.\n\n\"Dreams\" — The Cranberries\n\nIf you're looking for a song that will make you feel hopeful — not always an easy task when putting together a playlist of Irish music — there's nothing more uplifting than The Cranberries' \"Dreams.\" Or possibly \" .\" Hey, why not both?\n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" — The Clancy Brothers\n\nIf only all wakes could end the way Finnegan's did: An accident befalls Finnegan, causing all his family and friends to hold a memorial service, only to find out that whiskey can revive him and allow him to join the party. It's a rowdy drinking song, for sure.\n\n\"The Voice\" — Eimear Quinn\n\nWhile Ireland is famous for exporting crystal glasses and cable-knit sweaters, it should be equally well known for its output of Eurovision Song Contest winners. Until last year, it was the country with the most Eurovision wins, bringing home the award seven times. (As of last year, Sweden has tied it up. Will they break the tie in 2024?) It's been a while since they've been crowned champion, though: The most recent win was Eimear Quinn's \"The Voice,\" which took the crown in 1996, capping off an incredible run that had Ireland winning four times in five years.\n\n\"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\" — Blaggards\n\nThis song is about the conflicts with the British constables (nicknamed the Black and Tans) during Ireland's War of Independence. This version has more of a rock edge to it, but it's been recorded many times in many styles by bands like , Irish Descendants and — and all have that rebellious spirit to them.\n\n\"Put 'Em Under Pressure\" — Republic of Ireland Football Squad\n\nCo-produced by U2's Larry Mullen, this was the Republic of Ireland Football Squad theme for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and it mashed up a bunch of other songs, including \"God Save Ireland,\" \"Que Sera Sera\" and the \"Olé Olé Olé\" football chant. Sadly, the lads were knocked out in the quarter finals, but the song was more successful, staying on the Irish Singles Chart for an impressive 13 weeks. It's definitely something to listen to if you want to feel pumped\n\n\"Molly Malone\" — The Dubliners\n\nOne of the most famous Irish tunes of all, The Dubliners' \"Molly Malone\" tells the tale of a fishmonger who sells \"cockles and mussels” in the streets of Dublin. The song — which dates back to the 1800s — was even named the unofficial anthem of Dublin, where you can find a herself.\n\n\"God Save Ireland\" — The Wolfe Tones\n\nThis ditty is so jaunty it's easy to miss that it's actually a song that honors three rebel men known as the Manchester Martyrs. Afterward, the song was considered the unofficial anthem for Irish nationalists and the theme song for the Celtic Football Club.\n\n\"An Irish Pub Song\" — The Rumjacks\n\nThe Celtic punk rock band may hail from Australia, but their viral hit pays homage to Irish-styled pubs throughout the world, making it the perfect soundtrack for any and all St. Paddy's Day celebrations.\n\n\"Grace\" — Aoife Scott, Róisín O & Danny O'Reilly\n\nThis song is inspired by a real-life couple, Grace Gifford and Joseph Plunkett, who were married in 1916. But while that may sound sweet, and the melody is lovely, it's actually a sad tale: Gifford married Plunkett in the prison chapel at Kilmainham Gaol just a few hours before he was executed for his participation in the Easter Rising.\n\n\"Drunken Lullabies\" — Flogging Molly\n\nThis upbeat track from Irish-American punk band Flogging Molly will have you rocking out all day. Music critic Tom Semioli said it best when he wrote in a review, \"After one listen, you'll probably wish you were Irish.\"\n\n\"Saints and Sinners\" — Paddy Casey\n\nPaddy Casey has been on the Irish music scene since he started busking on the streets of Galway at age 12, but this may be the song he's best known for. He even recorded with the Dublin Gospel Choir.\n\n“The Wind That Shakes the Barley/The Reel With the Beryle” — The Chieftains\n\nWhile you can find many — written by Robert Dwyer Joyce about a man going off to fight in the 1798 rebellion — this instrumental by The Chieftains might be a better way to go if you're looking for something with a more uplifting feel to it.\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" — U2\n\nBono wrote this song about Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. The singer wanted to challenge the idea that a person’s religion and income could be guessed by the street they lived on, and instead encourage unity by forgetting about street names. (For more of U2 facing tough Irish history head on, see \" .\")\n\n\"Star of the County Down\" — The Irish Rovers\n\nA tale of love at first sight, this song is about a man who spots a woman so lovely, he imagines her \"a smiling bride, by my own fireside.\" Play it for your own \"sweet colleen.\"\n\n\"The Boys Are Back In Town\" — Thin Lizzy\n\nGuess who just got back today? This unlikely hit was part of the Irish hard-rock band's 1976 Jailbreak album, helping the band earn its first gold record. And yet, the band almost didn't include it on the album — the record-company management had to tell them how catchy it was.\n\n\"The Irish Rover\" — The Dubliners & The Pogues\n\nFor the band's 25th anniversary in 1987, The Dubliners thought it was the perfect time to collaborate with The Pogues for this Irish folk song.

But O'Connor didn't create the song herself; it was written by Prince and first recorded by his protégé band, The Family. But while theirs is also bluesy and heartfelt, if you listen to you can see why the heartbreaking version by O'Connor, who died in 2023, was the one that went to the top.\n\n\"Seven Drunken Nights\" — The Dubliners\n\nWhat began as a spoken tale became widely known when The Dubliners shared it in 1967.

After it was written in Great Britain, it made its way to Ireland, and was brought across the pond by migrants coming to the States.

The song is about the Easter Rising of 1916 and encourages Irishmen to fight for Ireland.\n\n\"I Don't Like Mondays\" — The Boomtown Rats\n\nBob Geldof may be best known for writing charity singles like Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and putting on mega-concerts like Live Aid, but before all that he was a member of the Irish band the Boomtown Rats.

When asked why she did it, the 16-year-old perpetrator said, \"I don't like Mondays.\"\n\n\"Riverdance\" — Bill Wheelan\n\nIt sounds like a cliché, but \"Riverdance\" still holds the record for the most weeks in the No. 1 spot on the Irish Singles Chart.
