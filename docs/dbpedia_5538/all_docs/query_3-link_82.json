        "text": "There have been many famous people down the centuries who have owned the loveable and intelligent Dachshund. Here in this list, we break down 20 of the most famous dachshund owners ranging from Kings, Emperors and Queens to actors, musicians and… a Vulcan?\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II was born on the 27th of January in 1859. His full name was Frederick William Victor Albert of Prussia and his parents were Prince Frederick William of Prussia (later to become the future Frederick III) and his wife, Victoria, Princess Royal. Victoria was the eldest daughter of Britain’s own Queen Victoria. When he was born, Wilhelm’s great-uncle Frederick William IV was the King of Prussia, and his grandfather (and namesake) Wilhelm was acting as Regent. He was also [amazon_textlink asin=’150985892X’ text=’Queen Victoria and Prince Albert’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’a5825547-81c2-11e7-80f8-51dc09c0f6ed’]’s first grandchild, and the first son of the Crown Prince of Prussia and as a result of this, was second in line for succession to Prussia from 1861 and also to the newly created [amazon_textlink asin=’090758232X’ text=’German Empire’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’b49bb035-81c2-11e7-96dd-27217458d88a’] which was ruled by the Prussian King in accordance to the Empire’s own constitution from 1871.\n\nHis mother went through a traumatic breech birth with Wilhelm, and because of this, he had a withered left arm, as a result of suffering from Erb’s Palsy. Erb’s Palsy is a paralysis of the arm caused by injury towards the arm’s upper group of main nerves. Wilhelm managed to conceal the extent of the injuries to his arm, as in many photos of him, he is either carrying a pair of white gloves in his hand to make the arm look longer than it is, or his hand is on either the head of a cane or the hilt of a sword with him posed in a dignified angle. His left arm as a result was actually 6 inches (15 cm) shorter than his right arm. Wilhelm died at the age of 82, on the 4th of June 1941, and in that time, he had abdicated from the throne, married twice and had 7 children and 20 grandchildren.\n\nTwo of the dachshunds Kaiser Wilhelm II owned became well known. Wadl and Hexl had accompanied him on a semi official visit to Konopiště, the country chateau of [amazon_textlink asin=’1447201477′ text=’Archduke Franz Ferdinand’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’377b6997-81c3-11e7-be58-1961d773ad57′]. Upon arrival at the chateau, the two dachshunds proceeded to do away with one of the Archduke’s priceless Golden pheasants, thereby almost causing an international incident. 5 of the dachshunds Kaiser Wilhelm II owned are buried in the park of Huis Doorn, the manor house he bought and lived in from 1919. There is also a marker in the grounds, dedicated to Senta, a favourite of the Kaiser, who died in 1927 at the age of 20.\n\nDoris Day\n\nDoris Day was born on the 3rd of April in 1922. She is an American singer and actress and is also known as an animal welfare activist. She had her first hit recording in 1945 with “[amazon_textlink asin=’B004IEY09Q’ text=’Sentimental Journey’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’a32adb52-81c3-11e7-a1ea-399b37aa80fe’]” and her popularity grew as a result. At the time, she had originally started her career as a big band singer. She was involved with Les Brown and His Band of Renown, before she left to embark on a solo career, in which she has recorded over 650 songs between 1947 and 1967. She had a 20 year career in film that started in 1948, when the director gave her a key part in the film “[amazon_textlink asin=’B071Z7CHYV’ text=’Romance on The High Seas’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’cbc5e7b5-81c3-11e7-bd18-e36795c076e4′]”. She also did a number of romantic comedies and musicals starting in the 1950s. During her film career, she starred in films alongside leading men such as Clark Gable in “Teacher’s Pet” (1958), Cary Grant in “[amazon_textlink asin=’B00078JZCY’ text=’That Touch of Mink’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’03fc5105-81c4-11e7-8459-1bcef760f6cb’]” (1962), James Garner in “[amazon_textlink asin=’B0007N1B8U’ text=’The Thrill of It All’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’0b484ce1-81c4-11e7-b9df-7140f10ef01e’]” (1963) and Rock Hudson in “[amazon_textlink asin=’B015T5NM7I’ text=’Pillow Talk’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’15536711-81c4-11e7-804b-996fa48b0473′]” (1959) and “[amazon_textlink asin=’B00099BIRG’ text=’Send Me No Flowers’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’1f948655-81c4-11e7-82cb-397793583d70′]” (1964).\n\nHer full name is Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff , and her parents were Alma Sophia (nee Welz), a housewife and William Joseph Kappelhoff, a choir master and music teacher. Both sets of grandparents were German immigrants. Doris Day had originally believed that she was born in 1922 and would state her age according to what she believed. It was only on her 95th birthday she learned otherwise, when the Associated Press, an American multinational nonprofit news agency, found her birth certificate stating she had been born in 1922 instead. She was the youngest of three children, and her two older siblings were older brothers, Richard and Paul. Richard passed away before she was born and Paul was 2 to 3 years older than her. She also starred in other films such as “Calamity Jane” (1953) with Howard Keel, “Starlift” (1951) with Gordon MacRae, “Lucky Me” with Bob Cummings, and “Young At Heart” with Frank Sinatra (both in 1953).\n\nDay has been married four times, and had one child, Terry Melcher (born Terrence Paul Jorden), who was a music producer and songwriter, who passed away in 2004 from melanoma.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff\n\nDavid Hasselhoff was born on the 17th of July in 1952 in Baltimore, Maryland. He is an American actor, singer, businessman and producer, with the nickname “The Hoff”. He holds the Guinness World Record for being the most watched man on TV. His full name is David Michael Hasselhoff and his parents are Joseph Vincent Hasselhoff, a business executive, and Dolores Therese (nee Mullinex/Mullinix), a homemaker. His mother passed away on the 11th of February in 2009. His family has German, English and Irish descent, and are Roman Catholic. His great-great-grandmother, Meta, emigrated in 1865 to Baltimore from Volkersen, Germany.\n\nHasselhoff’s early career started when he played Dr Snapper Foster in the soap opera, “The Young and The Reckless”. He played that character from 1975 to 1982, when he left the series as the show writers had written many of the show’s original characters. He starred in the science fiction adventure film, “Starcrash” as Simon in 1979. Hasselhoff launched his singing career by doing guest appearances on the first season of the childrens’ programme, “Kids Incorporated”, performing “Do You Love Me?“. He also guest starred in two episodes of “Diff’rent Strokes” and the soap opera “Santa Barbara” as himself in 1984.\n\nHis big break came when he starred in the sci-fi series “[amazon_textlink asin=’B01LZKTRLP’ text=’Knight Rider’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’9cbf8640-81c4-11e7-8a09-fb42e7f32e49′]” as the character Michael Knight from 1982 to 1986. Hasselhoff won a ‘Peoples’ Choice Award‘ for ‘Most Popular Actor’ for his role in ‘Knight Rider’. He returned to television when ‘Baywatch‘ premiered in 1989. It was cancelled after one season, so he decided to invest his own money into the show and additionally functioned as executive producer. The second time round, ‘[amazon_textlink asin=’B01N9FS4PW’ text=’Baywatch’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’bfbb373f-81c4-11e7-843a-d7b1d451b5f7′]’ was more successful and ran for 11 years from the 1990s until its series finale in 2001 and was watched by more than 1 billion viewers in 140 different countries. He reprised his role as Michael Knight for the television film ‘Knight Rider 2000‘ which was aired as a sequel to the original show and was also meant to serve as a pilot for a proposed new series of the show, but despite the film having high ratings and promise, the idea was abandoned.\n\nHasselhoff has been married twice, and has two daughters.\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nDavid Bowie was born on the 8th of January in 1947 in Brixton. His full name was David Robert Jones. He became interested in music as a child, and eventually went on to studying music, art and design before starting a career in music in 1963. His parents were Margaret Mary “Peggy” (nee Burns, 1913 – 2001) and Haywood Stenton “John” Jones (1912 – 1969). His mother was born in Kent, worked as a waitress, and had Irish ancestry, and his father worked as a promotions officer for the children’s charity, Barnardo’s.\n\nHis interest in music grew even more when his father brought home some American 45s which included the likes of [amazon_textlink asin=’B0018D4SHY’ text=’Little Richard’ template=’ProductLink’ store=’hampdadachsh-21′ marketplace=’UK’ link_id=’dd1ae637-81c4-11e7-84d2-0b50cb105654′], Fats Domino and Elvis Presley. Bowie’s half brother, Terry Burns, introduced him to jazz music, which led to him listening to the likes of John Coltrane and Charles Mingus. As a result of this, in 1961 his mother went out and bought him a Grafton saxophone, for which he was having lessons from a local musician.\n\nA year later in 1962, Bowie received an injury from a punch to the left eye from a friend of his, after they got in a fight over a girl. The injury resulted in Bowie being hospitalised for 4 months, having a number of operations. However, doctors decided that the damage to his eye could not be completely repaired , and it was because of this damage that Bowie was left with a permanently dilated pupil and faulty depth perception which gave a false impression that the iris had changed colour.\n\nDuring Bowie’s early music career between 1962 and 1967, he formed his own band called the Konrads at the age of 15. The band played mostly guitar based rock and roll at weddings local youth gatherings. However, he became frustrated and disgruntled with the band and left. He then joined a number of other bands, but left each one due to the lack of success of each one. He then proceeded to change his stage name from Davy (and Davie) Jones, the former of which caused confusion with Davy Jones from the Monkees, and named himself after a 19th century pioneer called James Bowie. Since his first single release in April 1967, Bowie created a number of personas for himself, like Ziggy Stardust and The Thin White Duke. With each new persona and each new album came a new sound and a new boundary for Bowie to test.\n\nBowie had been married twice, had one son and one daughter, and one grandson who was born exactly 6 months after he passed away. Bowie passed away on the 10th of January in 2016, from liver cancer.\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nClint Eastwood was born Clint Eastwood Jr. on the 31st of May in 1930 in San Francisco, California. His parents were Clinton Eastwood Sr. (1906 – 1970) and Ruth Wood (nee Runner; 1909 – 2006). When he was born, Eastwood was given the nickname “Samson” by the hospital nurses as he weighed 11 pounds 6 ounces (5.2 kg). He has a younger sister, called Jeanne Bernhardt, who was born in 1934.\n\nEastwood has Scottish, Irish, Dutch and English ancestry and is a descendant of William Bradford, who was a passenger on the Mayflower ship in 1620 emigrating to the Plymouth Colony (also known as New Plymouth) in North America which was an English colonial venture between 1620 and 1691. As a result of this, Eastwood is the 12th generation of his family to have been born in North America and the 13th generation to have lived in North America.\n\nEastwood has had a number of various jobs including lifeguard, golf caddy, grocery clerk, paper carrier and forest firefighter. Eastwood has said that in 1951, he tried to enroll at Seattle University, but was instead drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. Sondre Lock, Eastwood’s partner between 1975 and 1989, commented that Eastwood would regularly dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might have been some sort of hero. During the Korean War, Eastwood was actually a lifeguard at Fort Ord in California for his entire stint in the military. Eastwood was Mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California from the 8th of April 1986 to January 1988.\n\nEastwood made his first real audition in May 1954, when he auditioned for “Six Bridges to Cross” but was rejected by Joseph Pevney, who was an American television and film director. Eastwood eventually got a minor role in “The Revenge of The Creature” (1955), a sequel to the recently released film “Creature From The Black Lagoon” (1954). Eastwood has since starred in a number of films, including Westerns such as “A Fistful of Dollars” (1963), “For A Few Dollars More” (1965) and “The Good, The Bad & The Ugly” (1966). He has also starred in other films such as the five “Dirty Harry” films during the 1970s and 1980s, “Where Eagles Dare” (1968), “Heartbreak Ridge” (1986), “The Rookie” (1990), “True Crime” (1999), and “Space Cowboys” (2000). He has also directed a number of films, such as “Million Dollar Baby” (2004), “Mystic River” (2003), and two films in 2006 about the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II, the first being “The Flags of Our Fathers” and the second being “Letters From Iwo Jima”. The former was a film focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi, and the latter dealt more about the Japanese soldiers, the tactics they used on the island and the letters that the soldiers sent home to their families. Eastwood has been married twice.\n\nAudrey Hepburn\n\nAudrey Hepburn was born on the 4th of May in 1929, in Ixelles, a municipality in Brussels, Belgium. Her full name was Edda Kathleen Hepburn-Ruston or Audrey Kathleen Ruston. Her parents were Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (1889 – 1980) and Ella Van Heemstra (1900 – 1984). Her father was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, whose parents were Victor John George Ruston (who was of British and Austrian descent) and Anna Wels (who was of Austrian descent). Hepburn’s father was previously married to Cornelia Bisschop, who was a Dutch heiress. He double barrelled his surname to Hepburn-Ruston after mistakenly believing that he was descended from James Hepburn, third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. Hepburn’s mother was a Dutch baroness, who was the daughter of Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra and Elbrig Willemine Henriette, Baroness van Asbeck. Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra had served as Mayor of Arnhem between 1910 and 1920, and had also been Governor of Dutch Suriname between 1921 and 1928. Hepburn’s mother had also been married previously, to Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, an oil executive who was based in Batavia, in Dutch East Indies. They had two sons, and they later divorced in 1925. Hepburn’s parents married in September 1926, in Batavia.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1932 when the family finally settled in Linkebeek, they had spent the time travelling between London, Brussels, The Hague and Arnhem, and as a result, Hepburn was able to speak five different languages; Dutch and English from her parents, and French, Spanish and Italian. After the war had ended, Hepburn had moved to Amsterdam in 1945 with her mother and siblings and began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Olga Tarassova, a Russian. Her mother supported the family by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family as the family’s fortunes had been lost during the war.\n\nHepburn made her film debut in 1948, in the educational travel film “Dutch in Seven Lessons“, in which she played an air stewardess. That same year, Hepburn moved to London, dropped “Ruston” from her surname and took up a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert, however Rambert told her that even with her talent, that because of her height and weak constitution, achieving the status of prima ballerina would be unattainable and as a result, she decided to focus on her acting. She first appeared as a chorus girl in West Ends revues such as “High Button Shoes” (1948) at the London Hippodrome, and “Sauce Tartare” (1949) and “Sauce Piquante” (1950) at the Cambridge Theatre. She was then registered as a freelance actress with the Associated British Picture Corporation, after being spotted by a casting director when she was performing in “Sauce Piquante”. In 1951, she then had minor roles in films such as “One Wild Oat“, “Laughter in Paradise“, “The Lavender Hill Mob“, and “Young Wives’ Tales” before getting her first major supporting role in 1952, in the film “The Secret People“, in which she played a prodigious ballerina, and she performed all of her own dancing sequences. She then went on to star in other major films, such as “Roman Holiday” (1953), “Sabrina” (1954), “Funny Face” (1957), “The Nun’s Story” (1959), “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” (1961), “Charade” (1963), and “My Fair Lady” (1964).\n\nHepburn had been married twice, and had two children. In September 1992, Hepburn began suffering from abdominal pain, and in November, she found out she was suffering from a rare type of abdominal cancer. She returned to Switzerland to spend her last Christmas with her family, and on the 20th of January in 1993, Hepburn passed away in her sleep.\n\nChristian Slater\n\nChristian Slater was born on the 18th of August in New York City in 1969. His full name was Christian Michael Leonard Slater and his parents are Michael Hawkins (born Thomas Knight Slater) and Mary Jo Slater (nee Lawton). His father is an actor, who was also known by the name of Michael Gainsborough and his mother is an acting agent turned casting executive and producer. Slater also has a maternal half brother called Ryan, who is also an actor. Slater’s great-uncle was radio personality Bill Slater.\n\nSlater’s first television role was when he was 8 years old, when he starred in the ABC soap opera, “One Life To Live“. In 1980, he made his Broadway debut when he starred opposite Dick van Dyke in the revival of “The Music Man”, in which he played the lisping Winthrop Paroo. He also performed on the West End and starred in various plays on Broadway and the West End such as “Macbeth”, “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest”, “Copperfield” and “Merlin”. He made his debut in film when he starred in the film “The Legend of Billie Jean” in 1985 when he played the role of Binx, Billie Jean’s brother. He then starred opposite Sean Connery in the film “The Name of The Rose” (1986), in which he played Connery’s apprentice monk while they were investigating a number of murders in a Benedictine abbey. He then starred in “Tucker: The Man of His Dreams” (1988), “Gleaming The Cube” (1989), “Beyond The Stars” (1989), “Heathers” (1989), “Pump Up The Volume” (1990) and “Young Guns II” (1990). Slater became one of the major A-list stars of the 1990s after starring as Will Scarlett in the 1991 film “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves“. Since 2000, Slater has chosen to mix roles in TV with roles in lower budget films, with a handful of mainstream productions.\n\nSlater has had roles as a voiceover artist in various productions in film such as “The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius” and “Ferngully: The Last Rainforest” in which he voiced Pip and TV productions such as “Prehistoric Planet” and “Dinosaur Planet”. He voiced the character John Watson a.k.a. “Wonko the Sane” in a BBC 4 production of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy”. Since 2015, Slater has starred in the television series, “Mr Robot”, in which he plays two parts, one is a hacker for fsociety called Mr Robot, and the other is as Edward Alderson, the father of the main character, Elliot. Slater has been married twice, and currently has two children.\n\nElizabeth Taylor\n\nElizabeth Taylor was born on the 27th of February in 1932 in Heathwood, London. Her full name was Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor and her parents were Francis Lenn Taylor (1897 – 1968) and Sara Sothern (nee Sara Viola Warmbrodt, 1895–1994). Her father was an art dealer and her mother was a retired stage actress. Taylor received dual nationality at birth as both her parents were United States nationals and were both originally from Arkansas City, Arkansas. Her parents had moved to London in 1929 and opened up an art gallery. In the same year they had their first child there, Taylor’s brother Howard. The family returned to the US in the spring of 1939, due to the tense political situation going on Europe that led to the start of World War II. Joseph P. Kennedy, an American ambassador, had contacted Taylor’s father and encouraged him and his family to return. Taylor returned to the US with her mother and brother in April 1939, and went to live with her maternal grandmother in Pasadena, California. Her father joined them later in the year in December, after closing up the art gallery in London.\n\nIn 1940, her father opened up a new art gallery in Los Angeles, and the family eventually moved to Beverly Hills, where she and her brother enrolled at Hawthorne School. Taylor’s first small role was in “There’s One Born Every Minute” in 1942, after starting a contract in 1941 with Universal, however her contract was terminated by Universal in March 1942 reportedly because the studio’s director stated that she didn’t have the face of a child and that her eyes were too old. She received another opportunity in late 1942, as MGM producer Samuel Marx offered to arrange an audition for her, for a minor role “requiring an actress with an English accent” in “Lassie Come Home” (1943). The audition led to a three month “test-option” contract, which in turn was upgraded to a standard seven year contract in January 1943.\n\nTaylor had uncredited minor roles after Lassie, in the films “Jane Eyre” (1943) and “The White Cliffs of Dover” (1944).

However, in late 1956, his father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar and a friend of his father’s taught him how to play “Whispering“, “Dinah“, and “Sweet Sue”. Harrison then went on to form a skiffle band called The Rebels with a friend, Arthur Kelly, and his brother, Peter.\n\nHarrison met Paul McCartney on the bus to school, and they bonded over their shared love of music. Harrison became a member of the Beatles when they were still originally a skiffle band called the Quarrymen, with McCartney and John Lennon as members. Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen, by playing the song “Guitar Boogie Shuffle” by Arthur “Guitar Boogie” Smith. At first, Lennon felt that Harrison was too young to join the band, having only just turned 15, however during a second meeting between the trio, Harrison played the lead guitar part of the instrumental song “Raunchy”. The Beatles produced many number one hits and number one albums right to the end, when the band broke up in 1970.

On the 30th of December, he was hospitalised with over 40 stab wounds, a punctured lung and a head injury, after a 36 year old fan broke into his home and attacked him and his wife. The last time Harrison, Starr and McCartney came together and met up with each other was on the 12th of November 2001, in New York. George Harrison passed away, three weeks later, on the 29th of November 2001 from cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.\n\nJack Black\n\nJack Black was born on the 28th of August in 1969 in Santa Monica, California, and he was raised in Hermosa Beach, California.

Kennedy was born on the 29th of May in 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. His parents were Joseph Patrick “Joey” Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy. His father was a businessman/politician and his mother was a socialite/philanthropist. Both his grandfathers, P.J. Kennedy and John F. Fitzgerald had been Massachusetts politicians, and Fitzgerald had also been Boston Mayor. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. Kennedy was the second child of 9 children, he had an older brother called Joseph Jr. and seven younger siblings, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Ted. For the first 10 years of his life, he lived in Brookline, and attended the Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School and the Dexter school through 4th grade (year 5 in the UK). His father’s business kept him away from the family a lot and for long periods of time, and his ventures were mainly concentrated around Hollywood and Wall Street. He attended Choate, a boarding school in Connecticut, starting in September 1931. During his time at Choate, Kennedy had a number of health problems which resulted in his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at New Haven Hospital, where doctors thoughts he possibly had leukemia. He was eventually transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where the diagnosis was colitis. He eventually graduated from Choate a year later, finishing 64th out of 112 students. He was voted “most likely to succeed” in the yearbook, for which he was the business manager.\n\nIn 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army’s Officer Candidate School, a 12 week course designed to train, assess, and evaluate potential commissioned officers in the US Army, US Army Reserve and some Army National Guard. Kennedy was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. As a result, he exercised for months in order to straighten his back. In 1941, he joined the United States Naval Reserve, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), who was the former naval attache to Joseph Kennedy. In October 1941, he was commissioned as an ensign and joined the staff of the ONI in Washington, D.C.In 1943, when Kennedy’s boat PT-109 was doing nighttime patrols near New Georgia, along with PT-162 and PT-169, when he noticed a Japanese destroyer nearby and attempted to turn around to attack. As the boat turned, it was rammed suddenly and subsequently cut in half by the Japanese destroyer, Amagiri. The accident cost two crew members on the PT-109 their lives, and caused Kennedy to re-injure his back. Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability (due to his back injury) and was honourably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant on the 1st of March in 1945. When asked later in life about how he became a war hero, he joked saying “it was easy, they cut my PT boat in half”. His military awards include the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, Purple Heart Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with three 3⁄16 inch bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal. His eldest brother, Joseph Jr, was in the army as a Navy pilot, who was killed after volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission in 1944. As a result of his brother’s death in 1944, Kennedy became the family’s political standard-bearer.\n\nKennedy joined the US House of Representatives in 1947, with 73% of the vote. He served in the House until 1953, and between 1953 and 1960, he had a spot in the US Senate. In 1960, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency as the Democratic nomination. He served as President from January 20, 1961 until November 22, 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough and conservative John Connally. He was shot twice, once in the back, with the bullet exiting through his throat, and once in the head. He was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment, however he was pronounced dead half an hour later. Kennedy was married to Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy bought a dachshund puppy called Dunker in 1937 for his then girlfriend Olivia, when he was touring around Europe. However, the puppy never left Germany as Kennedy soon began having terrible allergies to the dog’s fur.\n\nKelsey Grammer\n\nKelsey Grammer was born on the 21st of February in Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, US Virgin Islands in 1955. His parents were Frank Allen Grammer, Jr. (d, 1968) and Sally Grammer (nee Cranmer, 1928 – 2008). His father was a musician and owner of a coffee shop and a bar and grill called Greer’s Place. He has two sisters and and three brothers. His parents divorced when he was 2 years old, and he and his sister were raised by their mother and grandfather until his grandfather passed away in 1966. Two years later, Grammer’s father was murdered. The man responsible set fire to Frank Grammer’s car, who came outside. Frank was then shot twice. Grammer’s family then had a spate of bad luck after that. His younger sister Karen was sadly murdered on the 1st of July in 1975 aged 18. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Grammer said that he could and very likely would forgive the three men responsible for her death, if they would just admit to their involvement, however all three men claim that none of them were involved. 5 years after his sister’s death, his two half brothers, Stephen and Billy, passed away in 1980. They had been scuba-diving and Billy had failed to resurface. Stephen went in after him but suffered a fatal embolism on the way back up, likely caused from an improper ascent. Billy’s body was never found.\n\nGrammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He also attended Juilliard between 1973 and 1975. When he left Juilliard, he had a three year internship with The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, before a stint at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1980.

Grammer and his co-star David Hyde Pierce (who played his on screen brother Niles in Frasier) won 4 Emmy awards each, including one each for the fifth and eleventh seasons. Grammer has also been Emmy-nominated for playing Frasier Crane in “Cheers”, “Frasier” and for a crossover appearance in “Wings” in 1992, making him the only performer to have been nominated for playing the same character in three separate shows.

His parents were Dora (née Spinner) (1904-1987) and Max Nimoy (1901-1987). His parents were both Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, Ukraine. He had an elder brother called Melvin, his father owned a barbershop in the Mattapan area of Boston and his mother was a homemaker. His parents left Iziaslav separately, his mother being smuggled out of the Soviet Union with his grandmother in a horse-drawn carriage hidden under bales of hay, his father walking over the border into Poland beforehand. They reunited with each other after entering the United States. When he was younger, Nimoy had a number of jobs including selling newspapers and greeting cards, shining shoes, or setting up chairs in theatres and when he got older, selling vacuum cleaners in order to supplement the family’s income.\n\nAt the age of 8, Nimoy also began acting in a children’s and neighborhood theatre. It was Nimoy’s grandfather that encouraged him to become an actor, his parents wanted him to attend college and get a stable job in order to support himself. Nimoy’s first major role was in an amateur production of Clifford Odets’ Awake and Sing! at the age of 17, before taking drama classes at Boston College. He then moved to Los Angeles and used $600, money he had saved from selling vacuum cleaners, to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse, however he quit after 6 months when he felt that the acting skills that he had already acquired from his earlier roles were more advanced than what he was learning there. He enlisted at the United States Army Reserve at Fort McPherson, Georgia in 1953, and he served with them for 18 months, leaving in 1955 as a sergeant. Some of his time with the military was spent with the Army Special Services, putting on shows which he wrote and narrated. In that time, he also directed and starred in a production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” with the Atlanta Theater Guild. Upon leaving the Army, Nimoy rented an apartment with his wife Sandi, who was pregnant with their second child, in Los Angeles and he took up a job as a taxi driver. He had a number of very minor roles in B-movies, a lead role in one, and a minor TV role. He deliberately chose to have the minor roles and being a supporting actor, as this was the attitude he had as a child. With him being the second child, he was brought up by his parents that he was educated to the idea that his older brother was to be given respect and not perturbed, and that he was not to upstage his brother. In order for him to support his wife and children, Nimoy took up other jobs, such as continuing as a taxi driver, delivering newspapers and working in a pet shop.\n\nNimoy became well known as an actor due to him playing the role of Spock, the half Vulcan, half human science officer and second in command on the Enterprise, in “Star Trek: The Original Series” which ran from September 1966 until June 1969 when it was cancelled after its third season and 79 episodes later, due to having low Nielsen ratings on NBC. “Star Trek” has since become a cult classic, still remaining ever popular and has since resulted in five additional television series, thirteen feature films and numerous books, games, and toys. Nimoy reprised his role as Spock in the 6 original “Star Trek” films, as well as his role as the elder Spock in the updated films, “Star Trek” and “Star Trek: Into Darkness” directed by J.J. Abrams in 2009 and 2013 respectively. After “Star Trek” ended, Nimoy joined the cast of “Mission Impossible”, an American television show that ran from 1966–1973. Nimoy went on to have a number of various stage roles, a number of production roles, and a number of voice acting, including reprising his role as Spock in the animated series of “Star Trek”.\n\nIn 2010, Nimoy announced his decision to step down from his role as Spock, citing his age and the desire to give Zachary Quinto the opportunity to enjoy full media attention with the Spock character as reasons for his decision. Nimoy was married twice, and had two children from his first marriage, one daughter called Julie and one son called Adam, who is a television director. In 2016, Adam Nimoy revealed to the world a documentary that he and his father had been working on together, all about the life of his father and their relationship with each other.\n\nNimoy passed away on the 27th of February in 2015, due to complications from COPD, which he had been suffering from since early 2014 when he got the diagnosis.\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nMarilyn Monroe was born on the 1st of June in 1926, in Los Angeles. Her birth name was Norma Jeane Mortenson and she was the third child for her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984).

They had separated before Monroe’s mother fell pregnant with her by a different man, however the identity of Monroe’s father is unknown. and Monroe used the surname Baker more often. Monroe was placed with her foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the town of Hawthorne shortly after her mother gave birth, and she was raised according to the principles of evangelical Christianity.\n\nIn 1934, Monroe’s mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and as a result, was very rarely in contact with Monroe. Monroe then became a ward of the state and a friend of her mother’s, Grace McKee Goddard, took responsibility over her and her mother’s affairs and became Monroe’s legal guardian in 1936. Monroe found a permanent home for herself in 1938, where she lived with Goddard’s aunt Ana Atchinson Lower, where she enrolled at Emerson Junior High School, where she excelled at writing and contributing to the school’s newspaper. She eventually moved back in with the Goddards in late 1940 or early 1941, due to the ill health of Lower. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School. In early 1942, the Goddards relocated to West Virginia, however Monroe could not leave the state due to California laws. Monroe came up with the solution of marrying their neighbour’s son, James “Jim” Dougherty, a 21 year old factory worker, on the 19th of June 1942, just weeks after her 16th birthday. She then dropped out of high school and became a housewife.\n\nA year later, in 1943, Dougherty enlisted with the Merchant Marine. He was first stationed at Catalina Island, where Monroe lived with him until he shipped out in April 1944 to the Pacific where he remained for the next two years. Monroe then moved in with his parents and began working at Radioplane Munitions Factory in order to earn her own income and help with the war effort.\n\nIn 1945, Monroe quit working at the factory and began modelling for David Conover, a photographer she met in late 1944 when he was sent to the factory she worked at where he was asked to take photographs of the female workers to boost morale. She soon defied her husband and her in-laws by moving out of her in-laws house, and in August 1945, she had signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency and she began using the name Jean Norman, and had her curly brown hair straightened and dyed blonde to make herself more employable. By early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.\n\nIn 1946, she eventually decided on the name Marilyn Monroe, a decision she made with Ben Lyon, an American film actor and a studio executive at 20th Century Fox. Lyon chose the first name as she reminded him of Marilyn Miller, a star on Broadway and she chose the surname after her mother’s maiden name. Between 1947 and 1962, Monroe starred in a number of films, including “A Ticket to Tomahawk” (1950), “Let’s Make It Legal” (1951), “Monkey Business” (1952), “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”(1953), “There’s No Business Like Show Business”(1954), “The Seven Year Itch”(1955), “Some Like It Hot” (1959), and “Something’s Gotta Give” (1962).\n\nThroughout her life, Monroe struggled with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Monroe was married three times, two of her marriages were highly publicised due to the marriages being with Joe DiMaggio, a retired baseball player, and with Arthur Miller, an American playwright. Monroe passed away on the 5th of August in 1962 from acute Barbiturate overdose.\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nMarlon Brando was born on the 3rd of April in 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska. His parents were Marlon Brando, Sr. (1895–1965) and Dorothy Julia (née Pennebaker, 1897–1954). His father worked as a pesticide and chemical feed manufacturer and his mother was an actress and a theatre administrator, and as a result of that, she helped Henry Fonda begin his acting career. Brando’s ancestry included German, Irish, Dutch and English, and an ancestor on his father’s side of the family was an immigrant who arrived in New York from the Palatinate in Germany in the early 1700s. Brando had two older sisters called Jocelyn (1919-2005) and Frances (1922-1994). Brando’s parents moved to Evanston, Illinois, when his father’s job took him to Chicago, and they separated when Brando was 11 years old. He moved to Santa Ana in California with his mother and sisters where they lived with his maternal grandmother. His parents eventually reconciled and moved to Libertyville, Illinois, a small town north of Chicago in 1937.\n\nIn 1939 and again in 1941, Brando worked at the town’s only movie theatre, the Liberty, as an usher. Brando was held back a year and later expelled from Libertyville High School for driving his motorcycle through the hallways of the school. He was then sent to Shattuck Military School, a boarding school in Faribault, Minnesota at which his father had studied and graduated from and became an artillery lieutenant. Brando did well at the school, excelling at theatre. In 1943 in his final year, he was put on probation for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers and was confined to his room as a result, but was caught when trying to sneak out. The faculty of the school voted to expel him, and he was invited back the following year, however he decided to drop out. He then got a summer job arranged by his father working as a ditch-digger. He tried to enlist in the Army but during the induction physical, he found out that he had been left with a trick knee as a result of an injury he had sustained from when he attended Shattuck, and as a result, he was classified 4-F, which meant he was not acceptable for military service.\n\nBrando eventually decided to follow his sisters to New York, where he began studying at the American Theatre Wing Professional School. In 1944, he starred on Broadway in the bittersweet drama “I Remember Mama”. In 1951, Brando starred as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee William’s “A Streetcar Named Desire”, and he received his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category for that role. He also received a nomination a year later in 1952 for his role in “Viva Zapata!”. Brando became widely known for his award-winning performances as Terry Malloy in “On The Waterfront” in 1954, and as Vito Corleone in “The Godfather” in 1972. He won a number of a variety of different awards including Oscars, Henrietta Awards, and Golden Globes. Brando had fathered 16 children, three of which were adopted.\n\nHe had also been married three times and he also had a number of grandchildren. In April 2001, Brando was hospitalized with pneumonia and on the 1st of July in 2004, Brando passed away from respiratory failure from pulmonary fibrosis with congestive heart failure. Upon his death, he left behind 14 of his children and over 30 grandchildren, and he was also survived by his sister Jocelyn.\n\nPaul Newman\n\nPaul Newman was born on the 26th of January in 1926, in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He was the second son of Theresa (nee Fetzer, Fetzko, or Fetsko, c. 1896 – 1982) and Arthur Sigmund Newman (c. 1893 – 1950). His father ran a sporting goods store. His father was Jewish, and the son of immigrants from Hungary and Poland and his mother was born to a Slovak Roman Catholic family. His mother also worked in his father’s store while raising Paul and his older brother, Arthur, who went on to become a producer and production manager. Newman had an interest in acting from a young age, and in 1943 after graduating from Shaker Heights High School, he briefly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. During World War II, Newman served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theatre. He had initially enrolled at Yale University in the Navy V-12 programme but was dropped from the training when his colour blindness was discovered.\n\nNewman completed his Bachelor of Arts in drama and economics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio in 1949 after the war. He attended the Yale School of Drama for a year, before moving to New York City in 1951, with his first wife Jackie Witte, in order to study at the Actors Studio, an organisation for theatre directors, playwrights and professional actors. Newman starred in a number of films such as “Cat on A Hot Tin Roof” (1958), “Exodus” (1960), “Hemingway’s Adventures of A Young Man” (1962), “Torn Curtain” (1966), “Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid” (1969), “The Towering Inferno” (1974), “Road To Perdition” (2002) and “Empire Falls” (2005). He also did the voice of Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, in the film “Cars” (2006). The third installment of the “Cars” franchise (out in 2017) will also have the voice of Newman in it, in which the film used some unused audio recordings of Newman that were recorded for the first film but subsequently weren’t used.\n\nNewman also became well known as an IndyCar driver, as he competed in 1979 for the Kremer Racing team, a motorsports team based in Cologne, Germany, along with co-drivers Rolf Stommelen and Dick Barbour. Their overall position was 2nd, and their class position was 1st. He did his last professional run at Watkins Glen International, at the age of 81. Newman had been married twice, and had 6 children, one son and 5 daughters. His son, Scott, died in November 1978 from a drug overdose and as a result, Newman started the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in memory of his son.\n\nNewman passed away on the 26th of September in 2008 at the age of 83 from lung cancer, which had been diagnosed about 18 months earlier.\n\nJoanne Woodward\n\nJoanne Woodward was born on the 27th of February in 1930 in Thomasville, Georgia. Her parents were Elinor (nee Trimmier) and Wade Woodward, Jr. Her father was, for a period, vice president of Charles Scribner’s Sons, an American publisher based in New York, known for publishing American authors such as Stephen King and Ernest Hemingway. Her full name was Joanne Gignilliat Trimmier Woodward, and her middle names, “Gignilliat Trimmier”, are of Huguenot origin. Because of her mother’s love of movies, Woodward was strongly influenced by this to become an actress, and her mother named her after Joan Crawford, using the Southern pronunciation of the name – “Joanne”, who was an American actress who starred in a number of silent films, short films and sound features between 1925 and 1973.\n\nIn 1939 at the age of 9, Woodward attended the premiere of “Gone With The Wind” in Atlanta, where she rushed through the crowd of stars and eventually sat on the lap of Laurence Olivier. Woodward later went on to star alongside Olivier in the television production of “Come Back, Little Sheba” in 1977, where she mentioned the incident to him during rehearsals, and he tells her that he remembers her doing that. Woodward lived in Thomasville until the second grade (year 3 in UK schools), when her family relocated and moved to Marietta, Georgia where she attended Marietta High School. After her parents divorced, she moved again to Greenville, South Carolina when she was a junior in high school. In 1947, Woodward graduated from Greenville High School. Woodward returned to Greenville twice, once in 1955 for the premiere of her debut movie, “Count Three and Pray” and again in 1976 when she appeared in a production of “The Glass Menagerie” at the Little Theatre.\n\nWoodward majored in drama at Louisiana State University, where she was an initiate of Chi Omega sorority, before she later went to New York City to perform on the stage. Woodward continued to move between Hollywood and Broadway, until she became an understudy in the New York production of “Picnic” in 1953, where she met future husband Paul Newman. They married 5 years later in 1958 after working together in the film “The Long, Hot Summer”.\n\nThe husband and wife worked together on 10 films together between 1958 and 1990, The Long, Hot Summer in 1958, “Rally ‘Round the Flag, Boys!” in 1958, “From The Terrace” in 1960, “Paris Blues” in 1961, “A New Kind of Love” in 1963,”Winning” in 1969, “WUSA” in 1970,”The Drowning Pool” in 1975, “Harry & Son” in 1984, and “Mr and Mrs Bridge” in 1990. Before marrying Paul Newman, Woodward had reportedly been engaged to Gore Vidal, an American author, however Vidal later claimed that there had been no real engagement between the pair as it had all been a publicity stunt to get the attention of Newman. Woodward and Newman married in 1958 and had three children together, all daughters. They also had two grandsons through their daughter Melissa. Woodward graduated from Sarah Lawrence College alongside her daughter Clea in 1990.\n\nWoodward and Newman’s marriage lasted up until Newman’s death in 2008.\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nPablo Picasso was born on the 25th of October in 1881 in Malaga, in the Andalusian region of Spain. His parents were Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. His mother was one quarter Italian from the Genoa territory, his father’s ancestors were minor aristocrats and his family had a middle-class background. His father was also a painter who specialised in naturalistic paintings of various birds and other game, who worked at the School of Crafts as a professor of Art for the majority of his life and was also a curator at a local museum. Picasso was the first child for his parents, and he had two younger sisters, Dolores (nicknamed Lola) and Conchita. Lola was born in 1884, 3 years after Picasso and Conchita was born in 1887.\n\nPicasso showed an interest in drawing and art from a young age, and received formal artistic training in figure drawing and oil painting from his father. in 1891, Picasso and his family moved to A Coruña, a city and municipality of Galicia, Spain., when his father started working as a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They lived there for almost 4 years, before moving to Barcelona in 1895, after his sister Conchita died from diphtheria at the age of 8. In Barcelona, his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts there. Picasso’s father persuaded the officials at the academy to let Picasso take an entrance exam for the advanced class, something which normally took students around a month to complete. Picasso completed it in a week and was admitted at the age of 13, however he lacked discipline at the school. His father rented a small room for him close to home, so he could work alone, however his father dropped in frequently every day and judged his drawings and as a result, the pair argued regularly. Picasso’s father and uncle decided to send him to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, an art school in Madrid. Picasso set off at the age of 16 for the first time on his own, however he disliked formal instructions and shortly after enrolment, he stopped attending classes altogether. The school is now functioning as a museum and gallery.\n\nPicasso’s art career began circa 1894, and he soon painted The First Communion in 1896, a large composition that depicted his sister, Lola. In the same year, he also painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa. Both paintings were done when Picasso was just 14 years old. Picasso’s Blue Period began in 1901 and lasted for 3 years until 1904, and his Blue Period was predominantly characterised by a number of his sombre looking paintings in shades of blue and blue-green. From 1904, Picasso went on to have his Rose Period which lasted until 1906. The paintings during the two years were predominantly characterised by his paintings having a lighter tone and style in various orange and pink colours and these paintings featured a number of circus people, acrobats and harlequins, also known in France as saltimbanques. Between 1907 and 1909, Picasso’s paintings became African influenced, a style which was inspired by Iberian sculpture. From 1909, he then went on to do paintings in Analytic cubism (1909 – 1912), Synthetic cubism (1912 – 1919, which was a further development of cubism), and neoclassicism and surrealism (1919 – 1929). Picasso died at the age of 91, on the 8th of April in 1973 in in Mougins, France.\n\nBy the time of his death, Picasso had been married twice and had four children by three different women."
