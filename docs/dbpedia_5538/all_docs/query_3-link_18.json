        "text": "Consultation post number 3 for this week! Hooray!! üòÅüòçüéâ\n\nI posted a consultation for Emily and her husband nearly two years ago, and then a birth announcement when their little guy was born, and now they‚Äôre naming another sweet little one! Their new little girl joins big sibs:\n\nGwenevere Marie (Gwen)\n\nAvalene Ruth (Avie)\n\nGideon Elias\n\nWoodrow Ignatius\n\nSUCH a fun and fabulous bunch of names!\n\nEmily writes,\n\n‚ÄúWe are in the process of adopting from China! This will be our fifth child, and third girl. She will be three in May, and we hope to get her home in the fall.\n\nObviously she has a name already. Her name is Le Le, pronounced ‚Äúluh-luh‚Äù in Chinese and meaning ‚ÄúJoy and gladness‚Äù. While we want to be respectful of her heritage, we also want to integrate her into our family completely. She actually goes by ‚ÄúLola‚Äù in her foster home. We had been calling her ‚Äúlay lay‚Äù before we found out we were mispronouncing it. We have been thinking of calling her ‚ÄúLulu‚Äù, as it‚Äôs very similar to what she is called, and what her name is.\n\nWe have now thoroughly confused our children on what her name is! We‚Äôre sort of stuck. We want to give her a name from us, as is tradition when welcoming a new child, but not totally overwhelm her with change. As far as we know, she understands when spoken to, but is, as of now, nonverbal (she has Down syndrome).\n\nLulu seems to be more nickname-y, and we hoped we could give her a more formal name.\n\nMy husband is totally against calling her Joy, which I first suggested.\n\nI don‚Äôt blog anymore but we have a youcaring page, which I try and update and a Facebook page dedicated to the adoption.‚Äù\n\nCan you believe how loving and generous this family is? What a blessed little girl Le Le is! I‚Äôm so very happy to think of name ideas for her. And I‚Äôm really intrigued by this naming dilemma! I immediately latched on to both Lola and Lulu, as they‚Äôre both kind of on-trend for girls right now. And I know a little girl with the given name Lulu! Just Lulu! So I think these names will fit in really well with the name landscape Emily‚Äôs kids are part of.\n\nI also love the meaning of Le Le‚Äôs name, and I actually love Joy as a possibility (don‚Äôt tell Dad! üòâ) ‚Ä¶ it makes me think of St. Catherine of Siena, who was so joyful as a child that she was called Euphrosyne, which is Greek for joy! At first I thought it could help Emily and her hubs with their dilemma, as I assumed the first syllable was said like ‚Äúyou,‚Äù and I did find one place that said it you-FRAH-zee-nee, which kind of mirrors the sounds of Lulu, but then I listened to another pronunciation of it that‚Äôs more authentically Greek and it sounds like it‚Äôs more like ef-raw-SEE-nee. So I don‚Äôt know if any of this is helpful at all!\n\nBack to Lola/Lulu, some formal names that I think could get to Lola, which I also think can work for Lulu, are:\n\n‚Äî Violet Louisa (or vice versa)\n\n‚Äî Caroline Lucia (or vice versa)\n\n‚Äî Lourdes (do note that Madonna‚Äôs daughter is Lourdes nicked Lola, a surprisingly beautiful choice compared to other choices she‚Äôs made)\n\n‚Äî a Mary- double, like Mary Aloysius, Mary Olivia, Mary Ophelia, Maria Lauren, Marie Lorelei; I also like the idea of hyphenating: Marie-Olivia or Marie-Olive, Maria-Ophelia, Maria- or Marie-Lauren, Marie-Lorelei ‚Äî really, Mary + anything with O and L sounds\n\n‚Äî Lulu is especially perfect for Louisa or Lucia/Lucy\n\n‚Äî Juliet (with its long U and heavy L)\n\n‚Äî Elodie (this could work for Lola too)\n\n‚Äî really probably most L names. In fact, I don‚Äôt even think Violet or Caroline need an L middle name to make Lola/Lulu work as a nickname for them.\n\nAdditionally, Lola is actually a traditional nickname for Dolores (meaning ‚Äúsorrows,‚Äù from the Marian title Our Lady of Sorrows), and the fashion designer Lulu Guinness was born Lucinda Jane.\n\nOooooh wait a minute!! I just remembered some L names that mean joy!! There‚Äôs Laetitia, which comes from the Marian title Causa Nostrae Laetitiae (Cause of Our Joy), and there‚Äôs the related title Our Lady of Liesse, where Liesse is French for joy! I particularly like Liesse, such a pretty name.\n\nAnd those are my ideas for this beautiful family and their beautiful little girl! What name(s) would you suggest that connect to Lola, Lulu, and/or ‚Äújoy‚Äù/‚Äùgladness‚Äù and that fit in well with her big sisters and brothers?"
