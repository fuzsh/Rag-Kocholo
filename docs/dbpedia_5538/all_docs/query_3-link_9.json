        "text": "Glamorous, shapely Parisienne Brigitte Auber briefly flirted with international fame as Danielle Foussard in Alfred Hitchcock's romantic thriller Über den Dächern von Nizza (1955). As a member of a gang of jewel thieves, she vied with heroine Grace Kelly for the affections of debonair cat burglar Cary Grant. The story goes, that, while filming a particularly perilous rooftop scene which had Brigitte fearing an accidental fall and possible death, she spotted a quartet of Catholic priests and was said to have quipped \"Mon Dieu! You Americans think of everything!\"\n\nBrigitte (born Marie-Claire Cahen de Labzac) was the daughter of a man of letters and expert on the writings of Balzac, Robert Cahen, who had adopted the nom-de-plume Robert Cahen de Labzac ('Labzac', of course, being an anagram of Balzac). Initially wanting to become a dancer, young Brigitte instead turned to dramatics and began acting on screen from the age of 21. After early bit parts, her first leading role was opposite Daniel Gélin and Nicole Courcel in Jacques Becker's charming comedy Jugend von heute (1949), set in post-war Paris. After that, she had back-to-back starring turns in Steppenrache (1950) (a rural comedy about a girl inheriting a farm house and facing larceny from some of the locals and resentment from others), Julien Duvivier's episodic melodrama Unter dem Himmel von Paris (1951),L'amour toujours l'amour (1952) (which was made for teen consumption) and Femmes de Paris (1953), a musical comedy. Hitch then picked her for the coveted role of Danielle in To Catch a Thief. In appearance, she certainly fitted the director's known predilection for cool blondes. However, Hitch thought Brigitte's French accent as too pronounced to cast her in his next picture, Immer Ärger mit Harry (1955).\n\nBy the mid-60s, Brigitte worked intermittently on both the big and the small screen, mostly in comedies or crime dramas. She had one more supporting role in an English-language production, appearing as an attendant to Queen Anne (played by Anne Parillaud) in Der Mann in der eisernen Maske (1998), starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role.\n\nAcademy Award-winner Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal on October 31, 1925 in Manhattan, New York City, to Witia (Haskell), a teacher and model, and Abraham Rosenthal, an educator and realtor. Her father was of Romanian Jewish descent, and her mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant. Lee made her stage debut at age 4 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, playing the abducted princess in \"L'Orocolo\". After graduating from high school, she won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where she studied acting with Sanford Meisner. When she was a teenager Grant established herself as a formidable Broadway talent when she won The Critics' Circle Award for her portrayal of the shoplifter in \"Detective Story\". She reprised the role in the film version (Polizeirevier 21 (1951), a performance that garnered her the Cannes Film Festival Citation for Best Actress as well as her first Academy Award Nomination. Immediately following her screen debut, however, Lee became a victim of the McCarthy-era blacklists in which actors, writers, directors, etc., were persecuted for supposedly \"Communist\" or \"progressive\" political beliefs, whether they had them or not. Except for an occasional role, she did not work in film or television for 12 years. In 1965 Lee re-started her acting career in the TV series Peyton Place (1964), for which she won an Emmy Award as Stella Chernak, and she later garnered her first Academy Award for Shampoo (1975), also receiving Academy Award nominations for Der Hausbesitzer (1970) and Reise der Verdammten (1976). Since 1980 Lee has been concentrating on her directorial career, which began as part of the Women's Project at The Americal Film Institute (AFI); her adaptation of August Strindberg's, \"Stronger, The\" was consequently selected as one of the 10 best films ever produced for AFI. In 1987 she received an Academy Award for the HBO documentary, Down and Out in America (1985) and directed Nobody's Child (1986) for CBS, for which she received the Directors Guild Award. In 1983 she received the Congressional Arts Caucus Award for Outstanding Achievement in Acting and Independent Filmmaking. Subsequently, Women in Film paid tribute to her in 1989, with its first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. Both the New York City Council and the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors have recognized Ms. Grant for the contribution her films have made to the fight against domestic violence.\n\nEnglish-born David Frankham forged a respectable career as an expatriate in Hollywood. He had served with the British Army in India and Malaya during the Second World War. Following his demobilization, he returned to Britain. In 1948, he began working for the BBC as an announcer, news reader, and, subsequently, writer and producer. A one-time guest on his radio program, the famed vocalist Rosemary Clooney, encouraged him to pursue acting as a profession. Given that he had always admired Golden Age stars like Gary Cooper and Laird Cregar, Frankham eagerly took this advice and relocated to Los Angeles in 1955.\n\nChance encounters with supportive movie icons like Elizabeth Taylor and Alec Guinness played an important role in kick-starting his career. It enabled Frankham to quickly establish himself as a character actor in episodic television, often typecast as British officers. He made several appearances in different roles in Alfred Hitchcock präsentiert (1955), Thriller (1960), The Outer Limits (1963), Gomer Pyle: USMC (1964) and F.B.I. (1965). Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) fans might remember him as Dr. Laurence Marvick, one of the original designers of the Enterprise, in the episode \"Is There No Truth In Beauty\". In his autobiography, Frankham said \"I was a jobbing actor for more than thirty years and never really stopped working.\"\n\nOn the big screen, he was featured on three occasions opposite Vincent Price: third-billed, as the villainous Ronald Holmes in Die Rückkehr der Fliege (1959), one of the captives in Robur - Der Herr der sieben Kontinente (1961) and as the helpless physician to Ernest Valdemar in chapter three of Der grauenvolle Mr. X (1962).\n\nHe was also occasionally utilised (often without credit) as a voice actor. Frankham did, however, receive credit for providing the voice for the tabby cat Sergeant Tibbs in Disney's 101 Dalmatiner (1961).\n\nFrankham eventually moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 2012, he published his autobiography, 'Which One was David?'. He retired from acting six years later.\n\nAfter school, he began studying economics at New York University, which he completed first with a bachelor's degree (1948) and then a master's degree (1950). In 1977 he subsequently completed his doctorate at the same university. At the beginning of the 1950s, Greenspan began working as a financial advisor in Manhattan. In 1953, William Townsend founded the management consultancy Townsend-Greenspan & Company, of which he became president after the death of his partner in 1958.\n\nDue to his support of US President Richard Nixon in the presidential election campaign, the Republican Greenspan was appointed chairman of the \"Council of Economic Advisers\" (CEA) in 1974, shortly before Nixon's resignation. As such, he also advised the subsequent President Gerald Ford until 1977. During Jimmy Carter's Democratic presidency, Greenspan returned to his private business activities from 1977 to 1980. Following the inauguration of Republican President Ronald Reagan, he was appointed chairman of the Commission on Social Security Reform, where he made a significant contribution to a bipartisan compromise on Social Security reform from 1981 to 1983.\n\nIn 1987, Greenspan became the second most powerful man in the United States when he was nominated as chairman of the Board of Governors, the governing body of the Federal Reserve System. Although the new head of the central bank passed his first test, the stock market crisis of October 1987, he ran into a conflict over interest rate policy with President George Bush, who succeeded him in 1989. Nevertheless, Greenspan was confirmed in his position for a second term in 1991. Despite initial differences that arose between Greenspan and Bill Clinton after the Democratic presidential transition in 1993, the central bank chairman also saw himself confirmed for a third term in office by this president in 1996.\n\nThe Clinton and Greenspan constellation led to the longest economic rise in US history. Even after President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, Greenspan's activities were further extended, and he now determines the fate of the US Federal Reserve in his fourth term in office. Greenspan has received several awards, including the Thomas Jefferson Award (1976). In July 2005, Greenspan warned against a further increase in the price of oil, as this would lead to a general increase in prices and thus endanger economic growth.\n\nAfter 19 years at the helm of the Federal Reserve, Greenspan resigned as President of the US Federal Reserve in January 2006 because his term of office could no longer be continued after five extensions. In the same year, 2006, Greenspan, along with Gordon Brown, received an honorary doctorate from New York University.\n\nAlan Greenspan was married to Joan Mitchell from 1951 to 1952. His second marriage, to NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, ended in divorce after a few months in 1997.\n\nBorn 8 May 1926, the younger brother of actor Lord Richard Attenborough. He never expressed a wish to act and, instead, studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge University, graduating in 1947, the year he began his two years National Service in the Royal Navy. In 1952, he joined BBC Television at Alexandra Palace and, in 1954, began his famous \"Zoo Quest\" series. When not \"Zoo Questing\", he presented political broadcasts, archaeological quizzes, short stories, gardening and religious programmes.\n\n1964 saw the start of BBC2, Britain's third TV channel, with Michael Peacock as its Controller. A year later, Peacock was promoted to BBC1 and Attenborough became Controller of BBC2. As such, he was responsible for the introduction of colour television into Britain, and also for bringing Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969) to the world.\n\nIn 1969, he was appointed Director of Programmes with editorial responsibility for both the BBC's television networks. Eight years behind a desk was too much for him, and he resigned in 1973 to return to programme making. First came \"Eastwards with Attenborough\", a natural history series set in South East Asia, then The Tribal Eye (1975) , examining tribal art. In 1979, he wrote and presented all 13 parts of Planet Erde - Das Leben auf unserer Erde (1979) (then the most ambitious series ever produced by the BBC Natural History Unit). This became a trilogy, with Die Erde lebt (1984) and Spiele des Lebens (1990).\n\nHis services to television were recognised in 1985, and he was knighted to become Sir David Attenborough. The two shorter series, \"The First Eden\" and \"Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives\" were fitted around 1993's spectacular Life in the Freezer (1993), a celebration of Antarctica and 1995's epic The Private Life of Plants (1995), which he wrote and presented. Filming the beautiful birds of paradise for Attenborough in Paradise (1996) in 1996 fulfilled a lifelong ambition, putting him near his favourite bird. Entering his seventies, he narrated the award-winning Wildlife Specials (1995), marking 40 years of the BBC Natural History Unit. But, he was not slowing down, as he completed the epic 10-part series for the BBC, Das Leben der Vögel (1998) along with writing and presenting the three-part series State of the Planet (2000) as well as Das Leben der Säugetiere (2002). Once broadcast, he began planning his next projects.\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from many universities across the world, and is patron or supporter of many charitable organisations, including acting as Patron of the World Land Trust, which buys rain forest and other lands to preserve them and the animals that live there.\n\nH.M. Wynant's many-faceted career began at age 19 when he left his hometown of Detroit, Michigan, after having attended Wayne State University for just two years. He arrived in New York City with only $125 in his pocket and a lot of ambition. Jerome Robbins hired him on the spot at Wynant's first audition, an open call for the Broadway musical \"High Button Shoes\" starring Eddie Foy. H.M. was working as a draftsman and told Robbins that he had to go to work the next day, Robbins said, \"Then quit!\" Thus began a career in theater which included productions such as \"As You Like It\" with Katharine Hepburn, \"Love of Four Colonels\" starring Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer, \"Venus Observed\" directed by Laurence Olivier, \"The Sound of Music\" with Shirley Jones and \"Teahouse of the August Moon\" starring David Wayne and John Forsythe. These performances garnered him many outstanding reviews and led to a prolific motion picture and television career. In 1956, RKO Pictures cast Wynant, based on his theatrical reputation, sight unseen, in a co-starring role of \"Crazy Wolf\" in the western, Hölle der tausend Martern (1957). In those days, he was known as Haim Weiner, which was his given name. In New York, he had changed his name to Haim Winant, and the film's director, Samuel Fuller, changed it again to H.M. Wynant, and he's been known by that name ever since. Wynant was true to form as a wild Indian and performed many of his own stunts. A budding film career ensued. In addition to his theatrical career in New York and his film career in Hollywood, he became part of television history by appearing in many live, dramatic television shows. Recently, Wynant's Los Angeles stage performances included playing the lead role in \"Karlaboy\", a suspense ghost story written by screenwriter Steven Peros. Jules Aaron directed him in \"The Sisters Rosensweig\" and in \"Philadelphia Story\" and he continues his work in film, television, commercials, radio and voice-overs. H.M. is the proud father of three grown boys who also have successful show business careers: William Winant, a professor and avant-garde percussionist; Scott Winant, an Emmy-winning producer and director; and Bruce Winant, an actor and singer on Broadway as well as film and television. H.M. lives in Southern California with his wife, Paula, and their young daughter, Pasha (born in 2000).\n\nWilliam Daniels is an American actor, born in Brooklyn, New York City.
