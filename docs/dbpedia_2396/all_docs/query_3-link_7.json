        "text": "Did you know?\n\nThe Medici Family is also known as the House of Medici: la casata dei Medici, in Italian!\n\nThe House Medici in Florence\n\nDuring the 12th century, part of the Medici family migrated to Florence from the area surrounding Tuscany.\n\nThe House of Medici began to gain influence and wealth in the 13th century. Not only the Medici family were successful wool merchants, but they were successful bankers, having established the Bank of Medici in 1397.\n\nBank of Medici and Economic Power in Florence\n\nThe success of the Bank of Medici gave the Medici family not only political power but more importantly, economic control over Florence. This led to the fall of the Florence Republic. The Medici family became monarchs, ruling over the city-state of Florence.\n\nWhen Cosimo de Medici, also known as Cosimo the Elder, came to power, he guided the family toward the support of the arts and humanities in Florence. This support directly led Florence to become a prominent city of arts and science. This patronage achieved the city's denomination as the cradle of the Renaissance. An example of this would be the massive urban project Cosimo authorized that led to the building of libraries, churches, and schools.\n\nCosimo passed and was succeeded by his son, Piero, and his grandson, Lorenzo. Lorenzo was another patron of the arts, commissioning work from Renaissance artists. When Lorenzo passed, his son, Piero, took over ruling Florence in 1492.\n\nKing Charles VIII of France and the Medici Dynasty\n\nIn 1494, Italy was invaded by King Charles VIII of France. Piero originally help out and refused to give in to Charles's demands. However, he had little support from those around him and his attempts at keeping Charles at bay did not gain traction. Piero eventually surrendered and gave in to all of Charles's demands. The people of Florence were outraged, seeing Piero as a traitor. The family was exiled in 1494., fleeing to Venice and surviving off the proceeds from selling the family jewels. The Bank of Medici was closed.\n\nBy the 1520s, descendants of Lorenzo the Elder (brother of Cosimo) established a new branch of the House of Medici. Cosimo I became the duke of Florence in the late 1530s, before becoming the grand duke of Tuscany in the late 1560s. Cosimo I ruled with absolute power, and his decedents would remain in power until the 1700s. The trend of authoritarian rule that started under Cosimo I prevailed under future Medici leaders.\n\nThe End of the Medici Dynasty\n\nCosimo II died in the early 1620s, which put his son, Ferdinando II, in control. Ferdinando II ruled for nearly 50 years, with Tuscany in decline the entire time. His successor, Cosimo III, was also a poor leader. The last grand duke, Gian Gastone, was the last ruling member of the Medici dynasty. He died in the 1730s. Gastone had no male heirs at the time of his passing, so technically the dynasty died with him.\n\nHouse of Medici Trade and Assets\n\nThe Bank of Medici loaned the Medici family money to begin producing textiles. The House of Medici traded alum, which was a material used in the textile industry. The family had a monopoly, as they controlled the mines that it came from.\n\nThe Medici family also traded wool, spices, fruit, olive oil, and jewelry. As the bank became more successful, it was able to invest in silk and wool manufacturing shops.\n\nHouse of Medici Estates\n\nThe House of Medici established many villas and gardens. These estates were constructed in and around Tuscany\n\nbetween the 15th and 17th centuries. These helped contribute to the development of Humanism and the Renaissance.\n\nHow did these villas and gardens contribute to the Renaissance? Remember, the members of the House of Medici were patrons of the arts. The Medici family would often sponsor large works of art and/or the artists themselves. Artists would come to the Medici homes and study the works of art inside.\n\nEach important family member owned an estate. The estates reflected the developments of art and architecture of the time.\n\nDid you know? The Medici Estates were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Being on this list means that the sites have incredible historic significance.\n\nCosimo de Medici\n\nCosimo Medici, otherwise known as Cosimo the Elder, is known for many things. He was a patron of the arts and architecture. He was also a banker, trader, and businessman.\n\nCosimo's father, Giovanni, was also a banker and businessman and using his resources, Cosimo surpassed his father's level of success. Giovanni founded the Bank of Medici and established locations in Rome, Venice, and more.\n\nCosimo expanded the Bank of Medici, and under his guidance, it opened more branches.\n\nThe Bank of Medici expanded into London, Pisa, Milan, and Lubeck.\n\nWith Cosimo at the helm, the Bank of Medici became the bank that supported the business of the papacy. The Medici family was deeply connected to the papacy, and it could threaten people who defaulted on their loans with being excommunicated from the church. How did they obtain this type of power? Giovanni de Medici had supported John XXIII in his attempt to purchase the office of cardinal for himself. To return the favor, he made the Medici bank the center of papal finance.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not a permanent arrangement. John XXIII was unseated, and Medici Bank ran into competition from other banks.\n\nCosimo was married to a woman named Contessina de Bardi, which was a strategically arranged marriage to link the Medici family and the Bardi family. The Bardi family was also a banking family.\n\nOther Members of the Medici Family\n\nThe following table shows some of the most prominent members of the Medici Family across the Renaissance.\n\nMemberDatesSignificance Giovanni de Medici1360-1429Started the Medici Bank Cosimo de Medici1389-1464Became Gran maestro (leader) of Florence in 1434Lorenzo de Medici1449-1492Ruled during the height of the Renaissance, supported Michelangelo, da Vinci, and BotticelliPope Leo X1475-1521First to be Pope, commissioned work from RaphaelCatherine de Medici1529-1589Became queen of France; supported art; brought ballet to the French courtMarie de Medici1575-1642Queen of France\n\nThe Medici Family's Power and Influence\n\nNot only were the Medici powerful patrons of the arts, but they were also economically, politically, and religiously powerful. The source of the Medici family's wealth and power came from the Medici Bank.\n\nThe Bank of Medici\n\nThe Medici Bank was the largest financial institution in Europe during the Renaissance. It was well respected as it advanced accounting and bookkeeping systems. The bank spread its influence by setting up branches in different European trading areas.\n\nThe Medici family got its start in banking in the early part of the 14th century. At the end of the 14th century, Giovanni Medici took over a Roman bank that was owned by another family member. Rome was a wealthy area, but it didn't offer the same amount of economic opportunity that was presented by Florence. Medici relocated the headquarters to Florence, later becoming the largest bank there.\n\nThe bank expanded to Venice, making it not only an important banking town but also an important financial center. It offered the Medici family many investment opportunities.\n\nUnfortunately, the success did not last for long. The combination of difficult, external circumstances paired with poor leadership led to decreased profits and instability.\n\nPiero Medici took control of the bank after the passing of Cosimo, who had successfully led the bank after Giovani passed. His actions concerning funds the bank loaned out caused the failure of many businesses at the time. This was in turn bad for the bank.\n\nThe bank became insolvent at the end of the 15th century as the Medici family was exiled from Florence. It was confiscated by new owners, who did not manage it well.\n\nThe Medici bank was quite large and developed some innovative business practices that are still used today.\n\nModern business practices inspired by the Bank of Medici include\n\nthe ledger system\n\nthe double-entry system of entering debits and credits\n\nThe Medici Family Summary\n\nThe Medici family was a dynasty of rulers who led the city of Florence during the Renaissance. Because of their banking business, they were able to possess power and influence over virtually every aspect of life-economics, religion, education, art, and science are just some examples.\n\nThe Medici family emigrated from Tuscany to Florence in the 12th century. By the 13th century, they had become wool merchants and bankers. They eventually became monarchs and ruled the city-state of Florence until the French seized it. The Medici were exiled but returned to power in the 1520s. They remained in power until the last ruling member died in the 1730s.\n\nThe Bank of Medici was the house of Medici's source of power. Not only did it impact banking at the time, it created practices that are still used in banking today.\n\nExamples of the Medici's power include:\n\ncommissioning and supporting artists and writers\n\nrunning a powerful bank\n\nhaving many family members become pope\n\nmarrying members into varying royal families\n\nThe Medici Family - Key takeaways\n\nThe Medici family was a dynasty of rulers who led the city of Florence during the Renaissance.\n\nThe source of the Medici's power was their money. Most of this was a result of the Bank of Medici.\n\nThe Medici family supported art, architectural design, and the creation of libraries, churches, and schools.\n\nThe Medici family had economic, religious, and political power."
