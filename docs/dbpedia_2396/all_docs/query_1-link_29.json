        "text": "by\n\nCraig Kallendorf\n\nLAST REVIEWED: 27 June 2017\n\nLAST MODIFIED: 27 June 2017\n\nDOI: 10.1093/obo/9780195399301-0095\n\nIntroduction\n\nGian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (b. 1380â€“d. 1459) is one of the more interesting of the early Italian humanists. He spent almost fifty years in the service of the papacy but never took orders and had no hesitations about ridiculing the vices of churchmen. His literary output covered a wide range, including speeches, dialogues, translations, letters, history, and fables, but he is probably best known today for his manuscript discoveries and for his polemics, which he unleashed against several of the most famous scholars of his day. His final years suggest well the contradictions posed by his life and works: at the age of fifty-five, he left his long-term mistress to marry a young woman of eighteen and delegitimized the fourteen children he had had with the mistress, but this did not keep him from being named Chancellor of Florence in 1453 and state historian."
