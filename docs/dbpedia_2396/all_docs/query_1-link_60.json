        "text": "Syphilis today is a reemerging infectious disease that affects not only the developing countries but also the Western world. In recent years, a new increase has occurred in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, among which syphilis is one of the most common (1). Especially in the United States, the rates of primary and secondary syphilis have increased since 2000–2001. A total of 27,814 syphilis cases were reported in 2016 (2). During 2015–2016, the US syphilis rate increased by 17.6%, reaching 8.7 cases/100,000 population, the highest rate reported since 1993 (2). Europe experienced a similar trend; in 2016, a total of 29,365 confirmed syphilis cases were reported in 28 countries, a rate of 6.1 cases/100,000 population. The highest rates (cases/100,000 population) in Europe were observed in the United Kingdom (9.9), Malta (9.2), Iceland (9.0), and Germany (8.7) (3).\n\nVenereal syphilis is a treponematosis caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the most widespread disease among the 4 treponematoses. Pinta (T. carateum infection) is spread only in tropical areas of the Americas, yaws (T. pallidum subsp. pertenue infection) in humid tropical and subtropical regions, and bejel (T. pallidum subsp. endemicum infection) in arid-temperate and subtropical rural areas. All these diseases involve the human bone, with the exception of pinta. Three clinical stages are typical of venereal syphilis: the primary stage is a painless lesion (chancre) on the genitals, which heals in 2–6 weeks; some months later, the secondary stage is characterized by a widespread skin rash; and several years later, the tertiary stage involves different organs, including the skeleton (4).\n\nVenereal syphilis first emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, as a result of the sexual and social behavior of the time (5). Soon after the disease’s arrival, its sexually transmitted nature was recognized, becoming a mark of immoral behavior (6); however, the social implication of syphilis was not the same for men and women, especially in the aristocracy (7). In fact, the sexual conduct of the noblemen and the possible infectious diseases that followed were not subject to moral censorship; instead, there was severe moral judgement for venereal diseases in noblewomen (7–9). Some paleopathological cases have indicated the impact of syphilis on the aristocratic classes of the Renaissance (10–12). Paleopathology offers a source for increasing the diagnosis of infection in the past and for understanding the social and cultural impact of infectious diseases in previous populations. The models obtained can be compared with what happens today with emerging and reemerging diseases and can serve to refine the systems of prevention and fight against future infection outbreaks (13). The study of the skeletal remains of Maria Salviati (1499–1543), wife of Giovanni de’ Medici, which revealed lesions typical of third-stage syphilis, has enabled us to understand the dynamics of the infection in one of the most famous families of the Renaissance and to examine the perception of the illness in 16th century Europe."
