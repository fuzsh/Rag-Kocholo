        "text": "Some details of the Moricci’s watercolor, which is preserved in the collection of Gabinetto dei Disegni e Stampe of the Uffizi Gallery No. 18987 (Florence) (fig. 1), combined with the elements taken from the literary documents [3], suggested to reconsider Francesco’s state of health at death: the Grand Duke’s body, dressed in his funeral robe, is lying in the coffin, with his hairless head resting on a pillow, slightly turned to the right. A facial droop may be noted, the hand has a claw appearance, and the shoulder is internally rotated. The calf muscle is wasted and the clubfoot seems to be confirmed by an orthopedic footwear in a corner of the coffin. This merciless representation of Francesco’s physical aspect is an exceptional case, and it can be explained only because it was executed after the Grand Duke’s death and after the end of the dynasty. During Francesco’s life, he was portrayed by the most important artists of the time, who would never have dared to highlight the defects of such an important commissioner. However, critically examining the portraits of Francesco alive it is possible to observe that when standing, the Grand Duke is usually leaning on a support (fig. 2). This stereotypical representation could suggest the artists’ intention to conceal Francesco’s physical defects.\n\nHowever, literary documents report a natural birth [6] and a normal physical development [3] and do not mention any sudden illness or accident. He probably was hyperuricemic, as many members of the Medici family were [7], and had contracted malaria [8], which was endemic in Tuscany at that time. The chronicles [9] reported that, when he was 20, Francesco contracted syphilis during a journey to Rome. Another clue resulting from the archive documents is the Grand Duke’s handwriting, which progressively worsened starting from 1563, becoming illegible in the last years of his life [9] (fig. 3). The letters look small and unsteady, and the words are difficult to read. Signatures in 1576 and 1579 are unreadable. This could be attributed to either a deteriorating stepwise process or to the increasing spasticity in the hand. Francesco’s behavior and temper were distinctive: he was a dark, introverted man, famous for preferring art and alchemy to government affairs. Both mood and behavior progressively deteriorated over time: his lifestyle became eventually messy, his wishes ungovernable. His behavior was characterized by a remarkable emotional instability, and short temper. As an event testifying Francesco I’s bad character, one of his biographers [10] reported a paramount episode: his stableman was instantaneously killed by him just because he had accidentally bumped into him. Finally, from 1576, Francesco I started to manifest seizures [11].\n\nFrom the faithful representation of Moricci’s watercolor, at a certain time of his life Francesco I was likely hidden by a right spastic hemiparesis, consistent with a left cerebral hemisphere lesion. He was right-handed [3], and, since no speech disorders result from any document reporting about him, a lesion seated in the corona radiata or in the internal capsule can be postulated, rather than a cortically seated one. The hypothesis that the lesion could have been consequent to cerebral palsy is the least probable. In this case, symptoms usually manifest within 2 years of life [12,13], and lead to childhood disability. Speech may be spared due to the reorganization of the speech area during early development [14,15]. The progressive worsening of his handwriting supports the hypothesis that fine motor skills were normal until a certain time, and were lost in the adulthood, but we can not be sure that disuse contractures were not the cause. No head trauma or symptoms suggesting a brain tumor are available in the documents. Considering the whole historical information, we advance the hypothesis that the Grand Duke suffered from a stroke that was eventually concealed by official reports in order to protect his political image. Regarding stroke risk factors and comorbidities predisposing to stroke, it has to be noted that in general accurate information about conventional cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities are generally lacking in documents of that age. However, there are several indirect clues. (1) Hypertension: after the second exhumation carried out in 1947 by a group of anthropologists, Francesco I’s remains were deprived of every tissue and hair [5]. Actually, the team of the Medici Project had at their disposal almost exclusively Francesco’s bones. The vertebral column did not show any indirect sign of hypertension [4], i.e. the lack of osteophytes on the left side of the column, a finding held to reflect increased aortic pulsation. (2) Data about hyperuricemia, which is known for being associated with an increased risk of hypertension [16] and with higher stroke incidence and mortality, have been consistently reported among Medici family members [17]. (3) Metabolic syndrome: portraits show the Grand Duke as obese, and chronicles report a lifestyle at risk of developing such a syndrome. There are no other hints signifying diabetes, cardiac disease, or atherosclerosis. (4) Family history of stroke: Francesco I’s father, Cosimo, died of stroke sequelae at the age of 48 [18]. The majority of the other family members had died from infectious diseases [19]. (5) Infections: in pre-antibiotic era, a pivotal risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases was infection, which can cause stroke through several mechanisms [20]. A widespread infective pathology in the Renaissance time in Italy was malaria. The increased stroke risk in malaria is likely limited to immunocompromised patients [21]. Another infectious disease that may cause vascular brain lesions is syphilis. It appeared in Europe at the end of the 15th century [22]. At first, the disease was more virulent and had almost always a fatal progressive course [23]. In the 16th century, the natural history of the disease changed, becoming less virulent and more insidious [22]. Neurovascular syphilis may occur from a few months to many years after the primary infection [24]. In 25% of cases, vascular syndromes associated with syphilis have a progressive course: it may take weeks or months until the syndrome is identified as of cerebrovascular origin [25]. More than half of these patients present with a syndrome referable to a superficial or deep middle cerebral artery territory lesion [24]. In the paretic neurosyphilis form, both psychic and cognitive functions may be affected, together with a decline in personal appearance. Handwriting abnormalities were once believed to be nearly diagnostic of this disorder [25]. Epileptic seizures may occur in one-fourth of cases of neurosyphilis [26] and are more frequent in the meningovascular or the paretic forms [24]. Finally, the baldness: alopecia is one of the cutaneous symptoms of syphilis [27]."
