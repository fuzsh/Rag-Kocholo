        "meta_description": "Trois dictionnaires médicaux italiens bien connus et largement diffusés ont été publiés à Venise à partir des années 1820 et jusqu’aux années 1860 : le Dizionario Compendiato, le Classico et l’Economico. Ils étaient traduits du français et étaient le résultat de la coopération entre un éditeur à succès et très perspicace, Giuseppe Antonelli (1793-1861), et le médecin Mosè Giuseppe Levi (1796-1859), deux représentants d’un groupe de professionnels bourgeois et savants. Les trois Dizionari montrent distinctement un modèle d’évolution allant des simples traductions du français, la principale langue européenne pour les sciences et la médecine, à un collage textuel de plus en plus complexe. Les dictionnaires de Levi et Antonelli montrent bien comment traduire signifiait aussi créer un nouvel italien, un langage scientifique calqué sur le français, mais aussi capable de surmonter l’extrême diversité, en termes de géographie et de pratiques, de l’italien médical.",

        "text": "Vindicating Italian as a scientific language\n\nFrench and Italian in the Dizionario compendiato (1827–1830) and the Dizionario Classico (1835–1846)\n\n13Levi’s name is not to be found on the title page—where one can only read the names of the French authors who contributed to the original—nor anywhere else in the volumes. Levi’s fame as a translator was yet to come, or, possibly, he still preferred to seek fame by other means than by the somewhat ‘minor’ activity of translator and compiler. The dedicatee of the work is Aglietti, who, as already mentioned, acted as an operatic “padre nobile”, a Nestor, in Levi’s words, to the community of Venetian progressive physicians. Throughout the seventeen volumes of the Dizionario compendiato Levi remained anonymous, but the Prefazione del traduttore that can be read before the first volume is interesting, because it was in itself a manifesto of Levi’s, and possibly Antonelli’s, interest in linguistic issues, in a spectrum that goes from the technical to the overtly political and nationalistic.\n\nToward 1848: from an Italian medical language to the history of Italian medicine\n\n58 “opera dalla quale io voleva derivare l'impronta nazionale da' più esatti e bene ordinati studj sto (...)\n\nA work that might describe the national character, by means of the most exact and well ordained biographical and historical studies; by means of the methods and criteria adopted by our national philosophy in the institution of doctrines, that is, by observation, experience, and strict induction; by means of enquiries on the climate and endemics specific to each Italian province, and of their special production and therapeutic efficacy; and finally, by means of a common medical legislation, something impossible to attain at the time.\n\n21The past glory of Italian achievements in the fields of surgery and pathological anatomy, in Asson’s opinion, were a sad comparison to their current state; however, those who persisted in extolling only foreign countries were still his enemies. In a passionate defence, he blamed those Italians who called scientific Italy “la terra dei morti”, the land of the dead, or even “la terra dei mai vivi”, the land of those who were never alive, thus forgetting the past, when European nations flocked to Italian schools to get their education.\n\n23The history of Levi’s and Antonelli’s translations from the French medical dictionaries can only be understood against the backdrop of a country, Italy, in transition. Politically, Italy moved from French domination during the revolutionary and Napoleonic years, to the Restoration, when the hopes for a united Italy slowly began to grow. Scientifically and culturally, Italy shifted from a commitment to the cosmopolitan ideals of the Enlightenment to a national rhetoric that included the re-invention of a tradition, even decades before the actual political unification. Medicine was the discipline that had ensured Italy a place of pride in European science throughout the Renaissance and the early modern era. However, the heritage it had left was controversial and difficult to reconstruct. Venice was an ideal point of departure, both because of the proximity to one of the most important academic centres in the country, Padua, and because of the rich tradition of its printing press. Moreover, Venice had a bourgeoisie that was comparatively more active and open than in other centres, with the possible exception of Milan, as Levi’s and Asson’s cases show: they were two integrated, learned and respected Jews; this shows that while religious prejudices were still alive in Northern Italy, they were not as strong as in previous times."
