        "text": "Fascinating details\n\nFirst female Democratic nominee for president of the United States (2016), 67th United States secretary of state (2009-2013), and former NY senator (2001-2009; Hillary’s service as U.S. senator overlapped for about a month with her time as first lady, a ‘first’ for first ladies).\n\nHillary graduated from Wellesley College and Yale Law School, becoming one of three women on the legal team working for the House Judiciary Committee investigating the impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.\n\nWas the first woman hired by the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1977 and was named among the “100 Most Influential Lawyers in America” on two occasions by the National Law Journal.\n\nChaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform.\n\nShe had her own office in the West Wing during President Clinton’s term, a ‘first’ for first ladies who traditionally operate from the East Wing.\n\nHillary received criticism for claiming a more prominent role for herself which, at times, led her to emphasize her domesticity and assume a more traditional first lady role.\n\nIn a \"first\" for first ladies, Hillary Clinton was subpoenaed by independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to testify in front of a grand jury regarding the Clintons’ Whitewater dealings.\n\nIn 2000, Hillary signed a contract for $8 million for her autobiography.\n\nGeorgetown University has a ‘Hilary Clinton’ award in recognition of exceptional leadership and the “important role of women in creating a more peaceful and secure world.”"
