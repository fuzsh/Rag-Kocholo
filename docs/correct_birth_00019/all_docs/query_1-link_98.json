        "text": "Is Hillary Clinton a friend or foe of feminism?\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is one of the most powerful women in world politics, and the irrational right-wing hatred of Clinton has fed her progressive appeal, helping turn her into a feminist icon. To get a woman in the White House, it’s thought, would be an achievement for all women everywhere, a kind of trickle-down feminism.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, the mantle of feminist elect has descended on Hillary Clinton, as a thousand viral memes applaud her, and most mainstream feminist leaders, thinkers, and organizations endorse her. In this atmosphere, dissent seems tantamount to political betrayal.\n\nIn False Choices, an all-star lineup of feminists contests this simplistic reading of the candidate. A detailed look at Hillary Clinton’s track record on welfare, Wall Street, criminal justice, education, and war reveals that she has advanced laws and policies that have done real harm to the lives of women and children across the country and the globe. This well-researched collection of essays restores to feminism its revolutionary meaning, and outlines how it could transform the United States and its relation to the world.\n\nFAQ\n\nThis is a book critical of Hillary Clinton.\n\nIs this book sexist?\n\nNo. The contributors are radical and feminist, and almost all are women. But sometimes even men write things about Hillary that are not sexist.\n\nAren’t you helping the Republicans?\n\nOnly if you think that even one person will read a book by a coven of leftwing feminists, find it convincing, and conclude that she should vote for one of those misogynistic reactionaries.\n\nIsn’t this the wrong time?\n\nNo. It’s never too late or too soon to criticize someone who is about to become the most powerful individual on earth. If you think there’s ever a time to withhold comment on such a person, you might be an authoritarian.\n\nDon’t you care about feminism?\n\nYes. That’s why we did this."
