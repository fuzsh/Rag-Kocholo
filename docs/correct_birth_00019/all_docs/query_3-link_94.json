The “Talk To Your Baby, Their Brain Depends On It” initiative will feature major public awareness campaigns and a new partnership with Scholastic Inc. to distribute baby book bundles to hundreds of thousands of new NYC parents.\n\nThese efforts will focus on closing the “word gap.” Studies have found that by age four, children in middle and upper income families hear 30 million more words than their lower-income peers. This disparity in hearing words from parents and caregivers translates directly into a disparity in learning words. And that puts our children born with the fewest advantages even further behind.\n\n“This is a conversation we want to have with as many people as we possibly can reach because everybody needs to be creative and smart about how we better prepare our kids for the future,” said Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n“It is truly a joy working with Scholastic to provide hundreds of thousands of families with a Baby Book Bundle,” said First Lady Chirlane McCray. “Some of my happiest memories as a mother involve reading Chiara and Dante a story, singing them a song, or just telling them how much I loved them. Now, thanks to modern science, we understand why these traditions are so important. When we talk, read and sing to our babies, we are building their brains and strengthening their bond with us. Now, in partnership with Scholastic and Too Small to Fail, we are helping families, parents and children across the city build the foundation for a healthy and happy life together.”\n\n“On behalf of the 24 city agencies and mayoral offices that are part of the NYC Children’s Cabinet, I’m proud to support this administration’s focus on early childhood development in the Talk To Your Baby campaign,” said Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives, Richard Buery. “A baby’s brain grows so rapidly between birth and age 3 that what happens during those early years truly lays the foundation for future learning and development. When we talk about how to reduce inequality and close the achievement gap – two priorities for this administration – our focus can and should start with birth.”\n\n“As we strive to ‘Open a World of Possible’ for every child in New York City and around the globe, ensuring all children have access to books at an early age is a critical first step,” said Greg Worrell, President of the Scholastic Classroom and Community Group. “Scholastic is honored to work with leaders and organizations such as First Lady McCray, Secretary Clinton, Reach Out and Read, Too Small to Fail, and the City of New York to ensure parents not only know how important literacy is from day one, but they have their first book to read aloud to their child.”\n\n“We are thrilled to be teaming up with Scholastic Inc. and Too Small To Fail on this important initiative,” said Gabrielle Fialkoff, Director of the NYC Mayor’s Office of Strategic Partnerships and Senior Advisor to the Mayor, “In partnership with Scholastic Inc., 200,000 of the newest and neediest New Yorkers will receive three books, helping them develop home libraries from a very young age. We are also especially grateful to include Too Small to Fail’s ‘Talking is Teaching: Family Moments – Talking Reading, Singing Together,’ family resource guide developed in partnership with Sesame Street to encourage early childhood language development.”\n\nSecretary Clinton also announced the launch of Too Small to Fail’s “Talking is Teaching Community Campaign Guide,” a how-to roadmap for local leaders across the country to initiate and enhance on-the-ground efforts to help close the word gap and boost young children’s early brain development. The “Talking Is Teaching Community Campaign Guide” was developed by Too Small to Fail and is designed to inform local efforts underway across the country, as well as the one launched today New York City. The Guide is designed to help communities plan and implement community-level efforts. It draws upon the success of and lessons learned from Tulsa, OK, and Oakland, CA, where Too Small to Fail has launched local campaigns.\n\nThe “Talk To Your Baby, Their Brain Depends On It” public awareness campaign, aimed at promoting ‘attachment parenting’ and early brain development among children ages zero to three, will include online resources with information and tips for parents and caregivers, subway advertisements and digital outreach. Materials will promote a new texting program administered by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that will provides parents and caregivers of young children with once-a-week texts with coaching tips and information relating to language development, attachment-encouraging behavior and socio-emotional health. This public awareness campaign is made possible through a book donation worth $1.5 million contributed from Scholastic Inc., to be included in 200,000 Baby Book Bundles – to be distributed over the next two years to families with children ages zero to three through City agencies and the Reach Out and Read program – encouraging parents to talk, read and sing to their babies.\n\nThe Baby Book Bundles will be distributed through the nationally recognized Reach Out and Read program and at the Administration for Children’s Services EarlyLearn Centers. The Reach Out and Read program distributes books through registered pediatricians to visiting caregivers of babies under two years old, and serves 85 percent of children born in New York City whose parents received public assistance – comprising approximately 64,000 families. Book bundles will also be distributed to another 12,000 children ages two to three through the Administration for Children’s Services EarlyLearn Centers, which serve some of the city’s neediest children.\n\nLearn more at: www.nyc.gov/talktoyourbaby\n\nAbout Talk to Your Baby:\n\n“Talk to Your Baby” Public Awareness Campaign will launch on April 1st:\n\nAdvertisements will run in the NYC subway from April 6th through May 31st\n\nPublic service announcements will run on Taxi TV from April 6th – 20th\n\nThe Children’s Cabinet is launching a Talk to Your Baby website with educational films, information and advice for promoting early language development to parents and caregivers.\n\nThe NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is launching a texting service.

In April 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the creation of the New York City Children’s Cabinet, a multi-agency initiative to bolster communication among city agencies and develop strategies for a holistic approach to a child’s safety and well-being. The New York City Children’s Cabinet is chaired by Richard Buery, the Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives. The Cabinet is composed of commissioners and directors from 24 different city agencies and mayoral offices. The Cabinet's structure provides a space for leaders of multiple city agencies to identify and analyze individual and common areas of work that impact children’s safety and well-being.\n\nAbout Too Small to Fail:\n\nToo Small to Fail, a joint initiative of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and Next Generation, aims to help parents, communities and businesses take meaningful actions to improve the health and well-being of children ages zero to five, so that more of America’s children are prepared to succeed in the 21st century.\n\nToo Small to Fail is focusing its work on closing the “word gap.” Studies have found that by age four, children in middle- and upper-income families hear 30 million more words than their lower-income peers. This disparity in hearing words from parents and caregivers translates directly into a disparity in learning words. And that puts our children born with the fewest advantages even further behind. Among those born in 2001, only 48 percent of lower-income children started school ready to learn, compared to 75 percent of children from middle-income families. The “word gap” is a significant but solvable challenge. Too Small to Fail is about parents, caregivers, other concerned individuals, and the private sector coming together to take small, research-based actions with big impacts."
