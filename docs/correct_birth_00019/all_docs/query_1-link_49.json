        "text": "New York: Simon & Schuster, 2003.\n\nFirst Edition, First Printing. Hardcover.\n\nSigned by Hillary Clinton, former president Bill Clinton, and Chelsea Clinton on first free endpaper beneath round \"Hillary for President\" sticker. This book was signed by the three Clintons at three separate events held in the Eugene, Oregon area in the spring of 2008 during the run-up to Hillary Clinton's first presidential bid in November 2008. Letter of attestation of authenticity of signatures from book's original owner laid in.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is the first woman in US history to have been the presidential nominee of a major political party. She served as the 67th Secretary of State (2009-2013) after nearly four decades in public service advocating on behalf of children and families as an attorney, First Lady (1993-2001), and US Senator (2001-2009).\n\nThis work, published in 2003, is a revealing memoir of her life during and before her years in the White House with Bill Clinton and in pursuit of her political passions. The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families. In addition, she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of a remarkable woman of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice -- as a woman and as a politician.\n\nItem #900664\n\nISBN: 0743222245\n\n6-1/8 x 9-3/8\", black paper over boards, xi, 562pp, author's note, key, index, illus.\n\nFine in near fine dust wrapper with a bit of crimping to edges of wrapper with no tears and price intact, in protective mylar."
