QUB stood out to me because it would enable me to learn from top-tier academics who actively contribute to human rights practice, to get a different perspective than I would have had I remained in the U.S., and to live in a place shaped by the themes discussed in class. I have already done this and more; the experience is exceeding my expectations.\n\nMy classes in International Human Rights Law, Human Rights in Practice, and Transitional Justice have challenged me to think critically about and take a real-world perspective to human rights and peacebuilding. I am excited to continue developing my expertise through my dissertation. Outside of class, I have loved getting to bond with classmates with a variety of backgrounds, identities, and perspectives; to engage with the Northern Irish community by joining a local dance troupe; and to explore Belfast and the North Coast. I am immensely grateful and honored to have received the The Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Peace and Reconciliation, which has made it all possible.\"\n\nRead more Read less\n\n2021\n\nAbigail McGowan, MA Global Security and Borders\n\n\"I am incredibly honoured to receive the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Peace and Reconciliation. While attending Secretary Clinton’s installation as chancellor, I was reminded of her meaningful history in Northern Ireland; and I similarly hope to contribute to the US-Northern Ireland relationship and Secretary Clinton’s legacy of peacebuilding and reconciliation around the world. As I prepare for a career in public service, the critical thinking skills and knowledge I will gain through the Global Security and Borders MA will enable me to be a stronger diplomat and global citizen.\n\nI have already had such an enriching academic experience at Queen’s. My core module in Global Security and Borders has challenged my understanding of the migration-security nexus. My course on the Politics of the Republic of Ireland has given me a better understanding of the island and European politics more broadly. Lastly, I know my Approaches to Research Design course will equip me with the tools to conduct rigorous research in both academia and the policy world. I feel fortunate to study politics, international relations, and borders in a place where these subjects are live issues, rather than abstract concepts. Outside of QUB, I am looking forward to exploring Northern Ireland and getting involved in the Belfast community.\"\n\nRead more Read less\n\n2020\n\nKatie Becker, MA Global Security and Borders\n\n\"Receiving the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Peace and Reconciliation means a great deal to me. I have already learned so much. My course instructors have challenged me and questioned things I thought I knew about borders and migration. I intend to go on to pursue a law degree in the United States, and I know I will begin my career in public interest law with sharper critical-thinking skills and greater global awareness having studied at Queen's as the HRC Awardee.\n\nAcademically, I am most looking forward to receiving rigorous training in social science research methodology through the HAPP7001 course and then applying that training to my dissertation. I'm also taking two area-studies courses: the Politics of Northern Ireland and the Politics of the Republic of Ireland. I'm excited to learn more about the place where I'm lucky to be living and studying. Outside of school, I am most looking forward to exploring Northern Ireland, the UK, and the Republic of Ireland when and as it's safe to do so. I've enjoyed exploring the cycling paths in Belfast, especially the Lagan Towpath.\"\n\nRead more Read less\n\nGraduate Study in Conflict Resolution at Queen’s\n\nQueen’s University is an international centre of excellence for research and teaching in politics, international studies and conflict resolution.
