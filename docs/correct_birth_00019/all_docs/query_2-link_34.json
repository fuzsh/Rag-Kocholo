He released the following statement:\n\n“Through her decades of service, whether as First Lady, U.S. Senator or Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton has personified the best of Illinois and the United States.\n\n“As the First Lady and later U.S. Senator, she worked across party lines to expand economic opportunity and access to quality, affordable health care, including for wounded service members, veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserves.\n\n“As Secretary of State, she helped restore America’s standing in the world. She strengthened our global leadership and pushed the frontiers of human rights by demonstrating that giving women the opportunity to fully participate is vital to security, stability and prosperity.\n\n“Hillary Clinton was born right here in Illinois and has traveled to more than 80 countries representing the United States. She’s earned worldwide respect as a champion of human rights, democracy, civil society and opportunity for women. She has shaped and changed the world we live in and serves as an inspiration for the people of Illinois, as well as millions of people around the globe.\n\n“The Order of Lincoln is the state’s highest award, given to those who have brought honor to Illinois, years of public service, or contributions to the betterment of humanity.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has exemplified all of these qualities.\n\n“It is an honor to present Hillary Clinton with the state’s highest award and thank her for the service she continues to provide to the people around the world.”\n\nClinton will receive the award on Saturday evening at the Field Museum in Chicago as part of the 50th Annual Convocation of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois. The Lincoln Academy is a non-partisan, independent organization which administers the award and chooses each year's honorees."
