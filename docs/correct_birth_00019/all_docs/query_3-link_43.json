        "text": "Hillary Rodham Clinton is the first lawyer to become First Lady. She graduated from Wellesley College and Yale Law School and has held many prominent positions including Professor of Law at the University of Arkansas, activist for the Children's Defense Fund, and partner in a corporate law firm. She is also the mother of a teen-age daughter.\n\nA Chicago native, Mrs. Clinton met her future husband in law school. After their marriage, the couple moved back to her husband's home state of Arkansas where Bill Clinton pursued a political career. As Governor, Clinton began to build the political base that would take him to the White House. His wife's lucrative legal career provided the bulk of the financial support for their family."
