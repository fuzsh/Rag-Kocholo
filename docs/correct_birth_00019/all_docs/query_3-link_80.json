        "text": "Hillary Clinton has served many roles in US politics - first lady, senator, secretary of state. Now, she turns for a second time to her long-held ambition to fill the ultimate role - US president.\n\nThe 68-year-old Democrat served as President Barack Obama's secretary of state from the start of his administration in January 2009, stepping down shortly after he won re-election.\n\nAs top US diplomat, she was known for a punishing travel schedule and a person-to-person approach to diplomacy.\n\nThat kind of regime will prepare her well for the frenetic weeks ahead, as the Democratic party's standard-bearer hoping to go all the way after losing a bruising 2008 primary to Mr Obama.\n\nHillary Diane Rodham was born in October 1947 in Chicago. In the 1960s she attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and became active in student politics.\n\nShe went on to Yale Law School, where she met Bill Clinton. They married in 1975. She remained politically active after Mr Clinton became governor of Arkansas in 1978.\n\nWhen Mr Clinton campaigned for the presidency in 1992, he quipped he was offering voters two presidents \"for the price of one\".\n\nAs first lady, Mrs Clinton campaigned for women's rights and universal healthcare, raising her profile both at home and internationally.\n\nHowever, following her failure to deliver on a plan for universal health coverage - which was never even debated in Congress - many critics saw her as overambitious and politically naive.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s - and throughout during Bill Clinton's second term - she became involved in the various scandals that marred his presidency.\n\nThere were congressional hearings and an investigation into the Whitewater affair, a failed real estate project in which the Clintons had invested.\n\nThey were cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nShe also endured media attention over Mr Clinton's affairs - notably his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which came to light in 1998.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton developed a tough hide that helped her weather the personal and political turmoil.\n\nShe lashed out at her husband's critics, declaring in a 1998 interview that the Lewinsky scandal - which led to impeachment proceedings - was inspired by a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\".\n\nIn 2000, as the Clinton presidency was drawing to a close, she successfully ran for senator in New York State, positioning herself in the centre of the Democratic Party.\n\nShe voted for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 but distanced herself from the conduct of the conflict, and called for the withdrawal of US troops. She easily won re-election as a senator in 2006.\n\nIn 2008 she sought the Democratic nomination for the presidential election. However critics - including within her own party - saw her as a divisive figure for whom many Americans would never vote.\n\nIn the end, Barack Obama secured the nomination and went on to win the general election.\n\nHe named her as his secretary of state in an attempt to heal the rift within the Democratic party caused by a bruising primary campaign.\n\nDuring her four-year tenure, Mrs Clinton visited 112 countries - more than any previous secretary of state.\n\nMrs Clinton used her position to highlight women's rights and human rights. She also led the US response to the Arab Spring and the military intervention in Libya in 2011.\n\nThe state department came in for sustained criticism after an attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi in September 2012, in which the US ambassador was among those killed.\n\nThe FBI announced it would not recommend criminal charges against Mrs Clinton, but said she and her staff \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\".\n\nLegal uncertainty over the email controversy has marred Mrs Clinton's primary and presidential campaigns, with polls suggesting that voters remain sceptical about how much they trust her.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders mounted a stronger primary challenge than many had expected. But Mrs Clinton eventually won with something to spare, dominating in the South.\n\nShe enjoyed a bump in the polls after her party convention speech, becoming the first female nominee for a major US political party.\n\nBut the contest has tightened since, and the low point of her campaign came in September when she was widely condemned for describing half of Trump's supporters as \"deplorables\".\n\nA day later, she was taken ill at a 9/11 memorial service and her campaign announced she was suffering from pneumonia. As she returns to the campaign trail, with the long-awaited first debate days away, she has lost ground to make up."
