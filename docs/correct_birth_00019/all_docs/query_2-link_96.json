It’s a fun way to learn to read and as a supplement for activity books for children.\n\nIn the 1950s, it was a man’s world. Girls weren’t supposed to act smart, tough, or ambitious. Even though, deep inside, they may have felt that way. And then along came Hillary. Brave, brilliant, and unstoppable, she was out to change the world.\n\nThey said a woman couldn’t be a mother and a lawyer. Hillary was both. They said a woman shouldn’t be too strong or too smart.

Includes a timeline, artist’s note, and bibliography.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMichelle Markel loves writing narrative nonfiction.

Sweet has created an outstanding backdrop for Markel’s text with a vibrant collage of watercolor, gouache, blank dress-pattern paper, bookkeeping pages, stitches, and fabric pieces.” — School Library Journal (starred review)\n\nPraise for BRAVE GIRL: “Sweet incorporates images of assorted fabrics and stitch patterns into her tender illustrations, brightening the lives of workers whose reality was bleak.” — Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\nPraise for BRAVE GIRL: “In her simple but powerful text Markel shows how multiple arrests, serious physical attacks, and endless misogyny failed to deter this remarkable woman as she set off on her lifelong path as a union activist.” — The Horn Book\n\nPraise for BRAVE GIRL: “Markel ably brings to life the plight of immigrant garment workers and Clara’s courageous advocacy.” — Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books\n\nPraise for TYRANNOSAURUS MATH: “This is a clever addition to the growing number of books that make a sometimes daunting subject both more understandable and just plain fun.” — School Library Journal\n\nPraise for ALL THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU: “In capturing the goofy spontaneity of affection and everyday family life without a whiff of treacle, Pham proves once again that she’s among the most natural and gifted illustrators working today.” — Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\nPraise for VAMPERINA BALLERINA: “Pace’s funny, matter-of-fact advice ... works in harmony with Pham’s expressive watercolor pen-and-ink artwork ... kids who aren’t into frilly will welcome this departure from typical ballerina books.” — Booklist\n\nPraise for VAMPERINA BALLERINA: “Pace and Pham have choreographed a delightful tale ... readers will applaud this elegantly designed, well-told story. Brava, indeed.” — Kirkus Reviews\n\nPraise for GRACE FOR PRESIDENT: “Pham’s deeply toned opaque and textured paintings of a multicultural group of children bring out the various details of each phase of a campaign. A timely, well-constructed explanation brought down to a level anyone can comprehend.” — Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\nPraise for BIG SISTER, LITTLE SISTER: “Pham lends a fresh and funny perspective to the pros and cons of being second in the birth order...Pham has beautifully captured the touch-and-go affection that is a verity of sibling life.” — Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\nPraise for BIG SISTER, LITTLE SISTER: “The illustrations have a bold, retro quality, and the examples of frustration and adoration are utterly familiar and timeless.” — New York Times Book Review\n\nPraise for A PIECE OF CAKE: “Captured in warm and bright illustrations that anthropomorphize animal friends, this story about doing the right thing and the power of friendship is a strong choice for story hours and classroom read-alouds.” — Booklist\n\nPraise for A PIECE OF CAKE: “A treat of a birthday picture book.” — Kirkus Reviews\n\nPraise for A PIECE OF CAKE: “This will work remarkably well in a storytime setting, and there are plenty of opportunities for curricular tie-ins (particularly prediction and inference) for a school setting.” — Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books"
