        "text": "Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois. She and her two younger brothers grew up in Park Ridge, a Chicago suburb. Her parents, Hugh and Dorothy Rodham, were a business owner and a homemaker. Hillary went to public schools. As a teenager, she joined the Young Republicans and was active in the First United Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1965 Hillary went to Wellesley College, in Massachusetts. There she began to support the civil rights movement, women’s rights, and protests against the Vietnam War. She soon joined the Democratic Party. In 1969 she graduated with a degree in political science.\n\nHillary went on to Yale Law School, where she met Bill Clinton. She earned her law degree in 1973. The next year she moved to Arkansas to be with Clinton, and they were married in 1975.\n\nHillary worked as an attorney from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. During that time, her husband served 12 years as governor of Arkansas. In 1980 the couple had a daughter, Chelsea.\n\nIn 1992 Clinton supported her husband in his campaign for president. After he took office, she set up her own office in the White House. The president asked her to propose a health care plan for the country, but Congress turned down the idea.\n\nIn early 2000 the Clintons bought a house in Chappaqua, New York. She moved there so that she could run for one of New York’s seats in the Senate. That fall Clinton became the first first lady to be elected to public office. She was reelected to the Senate in 2006. The next year, she decided to run for president of the United States.\n\nClinton and other Democrats, including Barack Obama, competed in primary elections in 2008. The winner of the Democratic primaries would run against the Republican candidate in the presidential election. Clinton lost to Obama, who went on to win the presidency.\n\nPresident Obama chose Clinton to be his secretary of state. The secretary heads the Department of State, which handles the United States’ dealings with other countries. In that post, Clinton made hundreds of trips around the world to meet with foreign leaders.\n\nIn 2016 Clinton again competed in the primary election. This time she won the nomination and became the Democratic candidate for president. She lost the general election in November to Donald Trump."
