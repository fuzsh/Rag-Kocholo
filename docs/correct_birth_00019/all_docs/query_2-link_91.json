        "text": "E Pluribus Unum\n\nSEASON PREMIERE - In the aftermath of a deadly attack on the White House, Elizabeth tries to keep a major nuclear disarmament deal from falling apart while a manhunt for the attackers brings D.C. to a halt.\n\nFake News\n\nCandice Bergen returns as the eponymous broadcast news legend in the revival of the groundbreaking comedy series Murphy Brown. Back in the game after a brief retirement and faced with a world of 24-hour cable, social media, âfake newsâ and a vastly different political climate, Murphy is determined to draw the line between good television and honest reporting, proving that the world needs Murphy Brown now more than ever. Thirty years since the critically acclaimed, multiple-award-winning show premiered, and 20 years since it concluded, this revival reunites Bergen with series creator Diane English and original series co-stars Faith Ford, Joe Regalbuto and Grant Shaud. Jake McDorman, Nik Dodani and Tyne Daly also star."
