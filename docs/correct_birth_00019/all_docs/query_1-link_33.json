        "text": "“Always aim high, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in. … And, when you're knocked down, get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on.”\n\nAs a young girl, Hillary Diane Rodhamâs parents told her she could be whatever she wanted—as long as she was willing to work for it. Hillary took those words and ran. In a life on the front row of modern American history, she has always stood out—whether she was a teen campaigning for the 1964 Republican presidential candidate, winning recognition in Life magazine for her pointed words as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley College, or working on the Richard Nixon impeachment case as a newly minted lawyer.\n\nFor all her accomplishments, scrutiny and scandal have followed this complex woman since she stepped into the public eye—from her role as First Lady of Arkansas to First Lady of the United States to becoming the first female U.S. senator from New York to U.S. secretary of state. Despite intense criticism, Hillary has remained committed to public service and dedicated to health-care reform, children's issues, and womenâs rights. Now, she aspires to a bigger role: her nation's first woman president.\n\nCritically acclaimed author Karen Blumenthal gives us an intimate and unflinching look at the public and personal life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Illustrated throughout with black-and-white photographs and political cartoons, this is a must-have biography about a woman who has fascinated—and divided—the public, who continues to push boundaries, and who isnât afraid to reach for one more goal.\n\nawards and honors\n\nYALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction, 2017 finalist\n\nbook extensions\n\ndiscussion guide for book clubs and classrooms\n\nmeet-the-author book reading, teachingbooks.net\n\nreviews\n\nâ[A] compelling portrait of the former U.S. Senator and Secretary of Stateâs journey from budding activist to presidential aspirant … â —Publishers Weekly, starred review\n\n\"Providing nuanced but clear explanations for the ways Hillary’s personality and personal history have shaped her political career is where Blumenthal’s method really pays off. She treats Clinton’s status as a woman on the national political stage as not so much an achievement as a challenge.\" —The New York Times (full review)\n\n\"This is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is not just about her political career, but rather the story of a female born in the United States and how she created a life for herself. Whether or not one agrees with Clinton’s political views, whether or not she goes on to be the Democratic nominee for president, this book offers a great look at history and the history of women, and offers a great sense of empowerment for young women.\" —VOYA\n\nâA balanced, wholly human portrait with all the flaws it entails. A richly detailed study that is as perceptive as it is engaging.â —Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"An in-depth portrait that gives teens a real feel for the woman behind the politics.\" —Booklist\n\nA note from Karen:\n\nAs a journalist, I don't make political contributions.\n\nBut in working on this project, I goofed. In a rush to make a deadline, I purchased four campaign buttons from the Hillary Clinton website and had them sent straight to my editor. (You'll see one of them in the last chapter.)\n\nOnly later did I realize that my $15.87 purchase (with shipping) is considered a political contribution. I did not intend to make a contribution and should have purchased the buttons another way.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, now you know."
