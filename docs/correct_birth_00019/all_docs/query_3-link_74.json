Her parents Dorothy and Hugh Rodham worked hard to provide a great loving home for their kids. Who knew she would grow to become such an influential woman in America? Through her parents she learned the importance of family, work, and service and those were the foundations of how she approached her career as a lawyer, First Lady of Arkansas, and eventually First Lady of the United States. This is a portrait of young First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton from 1960. #MoreThanFirstLadies\".",
