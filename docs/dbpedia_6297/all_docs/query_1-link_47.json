        "text": "The Simpsons fans are hoping to see an iconic character return to the show for season 36.\n\nDuring San Diego Comic-Con, show bosses confirmed several guest star appearances for the first episode of the forthcoming season, including Tom Hanks, Fast X's John Cena and US chat show host Conan O’Brien.\n\nAnother A-lister set to appear? Danny DeVito. The actor has already guest-starred on the show a few times, appearing back in 1991, 1992 and 2013. On all three occasions, the Twins 2 star lent his vocals to Homer's estranged half-brother Herbert \"Herb\" Powell.\n\nRelated: The Simpsons episode pulled from Channel 4 after Donald Trump gun attack\n\nTough it's still unconfirmed, following the guest star reveals, fans of the show flocked to Reddit to discuss the possibility of Powell's return.\n\n\"Is this Uncie Herb coming back?\" Benopo2006 penned on the Reddit discussion thread.\n\nSurvivorFanDan replied: \"I hope so! Most under-used Simpsons character ever,\" with another user chiming in: \"That would be great\".\n\nRelated: The Simpsons writer admits there was a big mistake in early episode of the show\n\nWhilst we'll have to wait and see if DeVito will be reprising his role or playing someone new, show bosses did share the storyline of the opening episode.\n\nProducers revealed the episode is titled 'Bart's Birthday', with the narrative set to celebrate the eldest Simpson sibling's big day.\n\n\"It’s kind of [a] crazy, star-studded premiere,” showrunner and executive producer Matt Selman said. \"It’s a pretty bold, big idea.\"\n\nRelated: Best streaming services UK 2024\n\nDeVito's debut appearance as Homer’s half-brother was back in 1991 during the show's second season in an episode titled 'Brother, Where Art Thou?'.\n\nHomer's dad Abe confessed to having an affair with another woman with Herb born as a result. At the time, Herb was put up for adoption and Homer met him decades later as a successful CEO of his own car company.\n\nBy the end of the episode though, Herb ends up bankrupt, having taken a risk on Homer's whacky designs for a new car that doesn't pay off.\n\nHerb returned in season three and made his fortune back thanks to a genius new baby translator device. However, his fortune doesn't last too long with DeVito's return in 2013 seeing Herb destitute yet again."
