        "text": "Arnelle Simpson\n\nArnelle Simpson is the ex-football star's first daughter with Marguerite L. Whitley. She was born in December 1968, saying during her father's murder trial that it was \"the same day my dad won the Heisman trophy,\" The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nArnelle told the jury during the trial that her father was \"very upset, emotional, confused\" when she spoke to him after police told him about the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, per the Post. At the time of the June 1994 murders, Arnelle was living in a guest house on Simpson's property.\n\nArnelle also spoke during her father's parole hearing after he spent nine years in prison in relation to a 2007 robbery. During her statement, she called him her \"best friend\" and \"rock,\" ABC News reported.\n\n\"We just want him to come home,\" Arnelle said at the time. \"This has been really, truly hardâ€¦ I know that he is remorseful.\"\n\nJason Simpson\n\nJason is Simpson and Whitley's first son. He was 24 at the time of the 1984 killings, born in 1970.\n\nAs NBC News reported, Jason tried to speak with his father when Simpson arrived at his Brentwood home after his famous televised 1994 car chase. Police, however, stopped Jason before he could reach Simpson and detained him. Jason did not face any charges.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported in 2016 that Jason was living a quiet life out of the public eye and working as a chef at an Atlanta restaurant called St. Cecilia. A profile that appears to belong to Jason on the Charleston Wine + Food Festival website indicates that he has more recently worked as the executive chef at Golden Eagle and Muchacho, two sister restaurants in the Atlanta area.\n\nSydney Brooke Simpson\n\nSydney Brooke Simpson was born in 1985 and was 8 years old when her mother was murdered in 1994. After Brown's death and amid her father's trial, she was looked after by her maternal grandparents, Louis Brown and Juditha Brown.\n\nAccording to The Los Angeles Times, she studied at Boston University where she graduated with a degree in Sociology. She later moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, near her brother Jason.\n\nSimpson seemingly has no presence on social media and appears to keep her life private.\n\nJustin Ryan Simpson\n\nSimpson's youngest child Justin was born in 1988 and was 5 years old at the time of his mother's murder. Along with his sister, Justin was also looked after by his grandparents during his father's trial and kept away from the media growing up.\n\nWhen \"The People v. O.J. Simpson,\" a TV series that dramatized the case, was airing on FX in 2016 and catapulted the Simpson family back into the spotlight, the Tampa Bay Times spoke to Justin about his life at the time. He told them that he was working in real estate and explained why he lives in Florida.\n\n\"It's a great place to live, why not St. Pete? It's great here,\" he said.\n\nA Zillow profile that appears to belong to Justin reads: \"Justin has seen a diverse spectrum of markets from Los Angeles to Chicago, Miami and Atlanta. Having spent years in multi-family renovation and income properties, Justin has turned his focus to helping others succeed as he has.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Having a family immersed in hospitality, Justin sets himself apart by dominating customer service and his communication/negotiation skills give his clients the competitive edge.''"
