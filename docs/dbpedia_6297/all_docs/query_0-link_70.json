        "text": "During the summer months, IGN will be taking a look back at\n\nThe Simpsons with weekly flashback reviews. Instead of trying to decide which episodes to highlight by picking and choosing from their vast back catalogue of 19 seasons, we've decided to let syndication narrow the field down a bit. In Los Angeles, the show reruns three times a day during the week. From those episodes, a \"Syndicated Episode of the Week\" will be chosen. This week, it's \"Brother's Little Helper\" from season eleven.\n\nI remember being put off by the apparent message of \"Brother's Little Helper\" when I first saw it in 1999. It seemed like the writers were trying to express that medicating troublesome children was a bad idea. It's not that I necessarily disagreed with this sentiment, but at the time, I didn't think I needed to be taught a lesson while I watched The Simpsons. I still don't. Of course, that doesn't stop the show from trying. It feels like there have been more \"message\" episodes per season in recent years, but I don't have the facts or the figures on hand to back that up. Just a feeling. But looking back at \"Brother's Little Helper\" now, what stands out most is that it's a funny episode. Its third act is a little weak, but there's still much to enjoy once you get past the rhetoric.\n\nI love the opening with the elementary school having its fire safety day. I find it hilarious that the volunteer fire department is made up of unrelated townsfolk like Moe, Apu and Ned Flanders. There's also a perfect Ralph Wiggum moment when he talks to a Smokey the Bear knock-off as if he were Santa Claus and we learn that fires in the Wiggum household are called \"Uh-ohs.\" This segment also has a hilariously wrong, very quotable line from Principal Skinner: \"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores or raining down on Charlie.\"\n\nAt fire safety day, Bart is especially rambunctious and ends up flooding the school gymnasium. Skinner calls in Marge and Homer and shows them \"an unmistakable cone of ignorance\" as a 3-D visual of the affect Bart has on the students around him. Skinner then tells them that Bart will be expelled unless he tries an experimental new drug called Focusyn. Marge eventually guilts Bart into taking the drug and his behavior starts to improve. The first sign is when two dogs fighting over a fan belt doesn't distract Bart from Krabappel's lesson plan. (Side note: No matter how many times I hear it, Milhouse shouting, \"Dogs are outstanding!\" slays me.)\n\nBart's brief time as a focused, thoughtful little boy also has some very funny moments. He reads \"The Seven Habits of Highly-Effective Preteens\" and treats his family unit like a corporation. My favorite bit in this part of the episode is when Bart offers advice to Homer, saying he should do something about his bright blue pants, to which Homer replies, \"I have been thinking of making them into cutoffs.\" In the next scene, Homer's at the nuclear power plant chatting with Lenny and Carl. His pants are now poorly made cutoffs, but no one mentions it. Moments later, when showing Carl his new hand-held computer dealy, Homer states that he has his whole week in there. He then holds up the computer that reads, \"Buy sunscreen for legs.\" It's a perfectly written, well-timed visual joke that only relies on spoken words for the setup.\n\nThe third act I am less impressed with. Bart inevitably goes a bit crazy on the drugs and starts to fear that satellites are following his every move. He claims that Major League Baseball is tracking everyone from space. Bart then steals a tank and goes on a rampage, eventually blowing said satellite from the sky. Turns out Major League Baseball is tracking people's activities, but Mark Maguire shows up in a guest spot to distract everyone by \"hitting some dingers.\" It feels like a silly cop out and the results just aren't as funny as the stuff leading up to it. I do, however, love the tag back to the volunteer fire department and the fact that they can't find how to fight a satellite fire in their handbook. (Apu: \"Let's just spray it with water already.\") But even with the lackluster third act, \"Brother's Little Helper\" is a standout episode in this later season."
