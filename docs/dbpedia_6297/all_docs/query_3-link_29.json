        "text": "Not many could have predicted the run NC State basketball has made during March Madness.\n\nExcept, of course, \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nREQUIRED READING: NC State fan flips bird after officials overrule goaltending call vs Duke in Elite Eight game\n\nIn a clip from an episode titled \"Every Man's Dream\" — which aired on Sept. 27, 2015 — it appears Homer Simpson predicted the Wolfpack would play Duke in an NCAA Tournament game. Eerily, the episode even got the correct date of the Wolfpack and Blue Devils' meeting: March 31.\n\nIn the clip, Marge — the matriarch of the eponymous family — praises husband Homer's ability to stay sober during March, through St. Patrick's Day, Easter and the NCAA Tournament. The clip shows Homer wearing a Duke T-shirt and holding up an NC State pennant.\n\nThe scene ends with Homer awaking from a dream when, in reality, he is asleep on a barstool at a bar.\n\nREQUIRED READING: What is the lowest seed to make Final Four? NC State can make history with March Madness run\n\nDid 'The Simpsons' get the NC State-Duke game correct?\n\nIt is eerie \"The Simpsons\" correctly predicted the exact matchup and date in the Elite Eight matchup between North Carolina and ACC foes. But the clip does not give any indication of who was going to win the game. So, the show doesn't get the credit for that.\n\nIn real life, the Wolfpack defeated the Blue Devils 76-64 to advance to its second Final Four appearance, joining UConn, Alabama and Purdue. NC State will play the Boilermakers on Saturday."
