        "text": "Sexist stereotypes exist everywhere, in what we see, listen to, read and experience in our daily lives. Even our favourite television shows, however “innocent” they may seem, have stereotypes woven into the characters and plot lines so well, that sometimes it goes unnoticed until it someone takes a closer look. The newest episode of The Simpsons last weekend was pretty obvious with the stereotypes and sexism.\n\nThe Simpsons first came out in 1989 and, at first glance, they seem like a normal, everyday, type of family. Upon further inspection each of the characters, except perhaps Maggie who is just a baby, fit into their stereotypical roles. There are no female doctors in the show, the convenience store owner is a stereotypical minority, no one wants to pay attention to the old people, almost all the women are super gossipy and most of the men are ignorant, drunks or both.\n\nThe father, Homer, is shown as a bumbling idiot when it comes to taking care of the children or house, and this is a very typical way of portraying of how men behave (Wood, 2013). Popular culture tells us that for a boy to be manly, responding with anger when wronged is an acceptable response and manly men spend less time talking about feelings and negotiating with more time threatening and intimidating (Smith, 2011). This is clear when Bart makes Homer angry and, instead of talking, Homer strangles him instead. Homer does not know how to relate to his children on an emotional level and when he messes up Lisa’s talent night performance his solution is to buy her a pony (Groening, 1991). Through Homer we see that men can be providers for their family but cannot connect emotionally or take care of them in any other way.\n\nMarge is the wife and, like any good wife, stays at home cooking, cleaning, shopping, nurturing the kids, and still managing time to keep her hair done and her body in shape (Wood, 2013). In one episode, Marge finds a great bargain on a brand name dress and gets invited to join the country club. She struggles to continually modify the dress to look new but eventually is mocked for being able to afford only one outfit (Groening, 1996). When Marge manages to find time to get out of the house to work or relax leaving Homer to mind the children everything falls apart (Groening, 1992). At one point, Marge goes in for plastic surgery on her face and comes out with a large set of breasts. This instantly gets her more attention (Groening, 2002). Marge shows the viewers that women are meant to be at home taking care of their family because the husband cannot. If she is lucky enough to be able to afford fancy clothes or a breast implants, she will be instantly more attractive to those around her.\n\nBart is the eldest of the three children and he is the brat. He is not a mean child at heart but is constantly causing trouble for teachers and neighbors and blowing off school when he can. This adds to the image that boys do not have to take school seriously and can misbehave because that is what is expected of them (Smith, 2011). His best friend Milhouse is considered to be a nerd, therefore he is lower on the hierarchy than Bart (Smith, 2011). Milhouse has glasses and is a little bit odd and, because these traits make him less manly, he is pretty much at the bottom of the male hierarchy (Smith, 2011). Both of the boys however, fall below Nelson, the neighborhood bully. Nelson uses intimidation to dominate others and most of the time get what he wants (Smith, 2011). At one point, Bart has had enough, and initiates a rebellion against Nelson (Groening, 1990). Through the boys in this series we see how it is uncool for boys to be smart, well behaved or nice.\n\nLisa is the middle child and probably the smartest Simpson. She is more into books, her saxophone and science than she is all the stereotypical girly stuff. She is seen as a bit of a loser and does not have many friends. Television and other forms of media tend to look down upon, or negatively at, feminists (Wood, 2013) and Lisa has run into this issue a few times. After taking a hit to her self-esteem, Lisa signs up for a beauty pageant with hopes of feeling better. She sees that the major sponsor is a cigarette company and decides that taking a stand was more important that appearance and speaks out against them (Groening, 1992). At one point, Lisa even makes a stand against a doll that she believes is sexist by creating her own, more realistic, doll (Groening, 1994). Lisa is really smart and believes in equal rights which causes her to be looked down upon, alone and often friendless.\n\nIn the latest episode, Bart vs. Itchy & Scratchy, Itchy and Scratchy are switched from male to female versions. When the announcement is made the boys are horrified, refusing to watch when it airs (Groening, 2019). Bart accidentally stumbles into Lisa’s room while she is watching it and ends up laughing harder than her. Lisa thinks Bart is a hypocrite and posts a video of him laughing on the internet. When his friends see him enjoying a “girl show” they shun him, and he ends up being below Milhouse on the hierarchy (Groening, 2019). Bart becomes friends with the female brat characters at school. When they decide to destroy all the original copies of Itchy and Scratchy Bart changes his mind and asks for Lisa’s help (Groening, 2019). The show is saved but not before Lisa ends up making all the boys cry. Boys are not supposed to show emotion, and this is hilarious to the brat girls and because of this Lisa gains status with them. This episode tells the audience that boys and girls cannot like the same things, if they do, they are uncool. Boys cannot show emotion for fear of being uncool but if a girl can make a boy cry she is considered cool.\n\nOne day it would be wonderful if people could just be themselves. If they could like something for what it is, instead of who is “supposed” to like it, and recognize that both sexes, while extremely different in many respects, want the same thing…. the opportunity to be themselves, without stereotypes being forced upon them.\n\nReferences\n\n[Bart the general] retrieved from http://yellowjaysherman.blogspot.com/2012/08/bart-general-s01-e05.html\n\nGroening, M.
