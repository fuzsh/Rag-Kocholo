        "text": "The Simpsons were serious when they announced last summer that there were planning on diversifying its voice cast to include more BIPOC voice actors.\n\n“Moving forward, The Simpsons will no longer have white actors voice non-white characters,” the show said in a statement last June.\n\nThe long-running animated series continued to add to their talented cast this week with the move to make Kevin Michael Richardson the new voice of Black character Dr. Julius Hibbert. The character was voiced by Harry Shearer for the last 32 seasons.\n\nDiversity in voice acting became a major topic of debate when comedian Hari Kondabolu released the 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu. In the film, Kondabolu explores Simpson’s character, convenient store owner Apu, the negative stereotypes of Indian people on TV and the impact it had on his and other South Asian children growing up. He also criticized the fact that the character was voiced by white actor Hank Azaria. “[Hes’] a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.”\n\nSince the documentary aired four years ago, Azaria has stepped down from playing the role. He also is no longer voicing the characters of Carl, Lou and Bumblebee Man, the most recognizable of the few Latino characters on the TV series.\n\nBumblebee Man is a parody of El Chapulin Colorado created by the late Roberto Gómez Bolaños, aka Chespirito, Now, voice actor Eric Lopez has taken over the role.\n\nAlong with The Simpsons, other animated shows have also decided to cast Black, Indigenous, Latinx and people of color voice actors to play Black, Indigenous, Latinx and POC characters. Last year, voice actor Mike Henry decided to step away from his role as Black character Cleveland Brown on the Family Guy after 20 years. Also, actresses Jenny Slate (Zootopia) and Kristen Bell (Frozen) gave up their roles as POC characters on their animated shows, Big Mouth and Central Park.\n\nBesides Bumblebee Man, can you name any other Latino characters featured on The Simpsons in the last three decades? You’ll be hard-pressed to find them—and might be a bit confused if they’re only described as “Hispanic” or “Spanish”—but here are a few examples you might remember."
