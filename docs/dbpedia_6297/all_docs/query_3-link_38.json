And Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson, has guest-starred on Family Guy, which also airs on Fox.\n\nIn addition to Family Guy, MacFarlane created and voices characters in American Dad and The Cleveland Show. He also directed and co-wrote the summer box-office hit Ted.\n\nSTORY: Seth MacFarlane: The Restless Mind of a Complicated Cartoonist\n\nThe MacFarlane-hosted Oscar ceremony is set to air live Feb. 24 on ABC from Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland. On Friday, MacFarlane, along with the Academy and mtvU, announced “The Oscar Experience College Search,” a nationwide hunt for college students to present Oscar statuettes during the ceremony."
