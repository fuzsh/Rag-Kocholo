        "text": "The Simpsons as Commedia dell’Arte Archetypes\n\nAs the longest running American sitcom and a beloved cultural touchpoint that has entertained audiences the world over, there is no better contemporary parallel than The Simpsons to what Commedia dell’Arte was as an art form hundreds of years ago. Almost anywhere you go in the world, people know these characters and might have a favorite episode or catch phrase.\n\nThe show pulls no punches at satirizing people up and down the social hierarchy, but reserves its harshest critiques for “The Man”: those with the most power and for society itself, with all its injustice and inequality. We laugh so that we don’t cry. Many of the characters of The Simpsons map *almost* perfectly onto Commedia archetypes, and I’ve put together some of my favorites – along with some hilarious clips from the show – to show you who is who, and why. (Wow... infotainment!)\n\nThe cast of The Simpsons is enormous. On the other hand, the archetypes of Commedia are much more limited. However, once a performer inhabits a mask and the corresponding archetype, they invariably put their own unique spin on, so the possible permutations of actor, mask, and archetype are truly infinite. In Tut'Zanni Theatre Company, we have nine masks to be used for nine Commedia archetypes in our core collection, but over the years we’ve gradually added new masks and even ventured into imagining (or uncovering?) new archetypes with new masks that we feel deserve a place in the Commedia dell’Arte pantheon. We often do this to ameliorate Commedia’s patriarchy problem - it’s an art form dominated by male characters that marginalizes and at times objectifies its relatively small roster of traditionally female characters (hence having no choice but to collapse both Marge and Lisa, two very different members of the Simpson family, into the one most popular female Commedia archetype, Colombina).\n\nIn no character is the direct imprint of Commedia dell’Arte more evident than in Mr. Burns, who may be the most famous contemporary example of Pantalone currently in existence. Greedy, miserly, and with a lackey always by his side to do his bidding, the character and the archetype are truly one and the same.\n\nIn this image, I’m spotlighting first some of the many, many Innamorati of The Simpsons. Italian for “Lover”, this unmasked archetype usually propels the plot of the show forward and the theme of their arc is almost always romance - puppy love, forbidden love, unrequited love, every flavor of love imaginable. They are the children of the masters and depend on the servants to do their bidding and clean up the fiascos they cause. Beyond the romance of it all, they can be dreamers, eye-rollers, naive, entitled, inept, self-obsessed, suicidal, balletic, clumsy, overly dramatic - they’re lots of fun to play (I know from personal experience). In The Simpsons, they’re the objects of Bart and Lisa’s (and Homer and Marge’s) affection, but they might only have a one-episode arc. Or Bart or Lisa themselves (and definitely young Marge!) might be the Innamorato/Innamorata of an episode - it’s always fun to see the archetypal qualities emerge and recede to serve the needs of a particular episode of the show. So rather than picking one, I picked a bunch of my favorites to highlight.\n\nIt’s been a joy to put these together and reflect on how much the brilliant stories and humor of The Simpsons has profoundly affected my own sense of story and humor. The show has brought me so much joy and I hope I’ve transferred a little of that joy, and maybe some interesting info about Commedia dell’Arte onto you too."
