        "text": "Hit TV show The Simpsons has been entertaining viewers since 1989, and throughout the years they have had several LGBT characters.\n\nYou may be surprised how many Simpsons gay characters have appeared throughout the 30 seasons so far, not to mention the video games and movie.\n\nWe have listed the various LGBT characters in The Simpsons, from those openly gay, lesbian and bi, to those who may be in the closet.\n\nOpenly gay Simpsons characters\n\nThese Simpsons characters are openly gay, as revealed in the TV show.\n\nWaylon Smithers, Jr.\n\nSmithers is the most obvious Simpsons gay character.\n\nAfter 27 seasons, Smithers finally came out while singing a ballad about his unrequited love for Mr. Burns.\n\nHe is now openly gay and Marge even calls him her “gay best friend.” But some people felt the storyline served the show more than the LGBT+ community.\n\nDewey Largo\n\nLargo, Lisa’s music teacher, revealed himself as gay when he ran off with his soulmate – also called Dewey – a man he met at Moe’s Tavern.\n\nJohn\n\nJohn is a rather camp nostalgia store owner who befriends the Simpson family, going into their home and complimenting their interior design.\n\nRoscoe\n\nRoscoe is the gay manager of the Ajax Steel Mill. All of his employees are also gay, and during breaks, they transform the mill to a gay nightclub.\n\nGrady, Julio and Thad\n\nMuch like in real life, The Simpsons has some romantic drama. Grady and Julio were originally introduced as a couple but in a later episode, Julio is married to Simpsons character Thad.\n\nOf course, that’s not it. Soon after, Julio and Grady got back together.\n\nOpenly lesbian Simpsons characters\n\nThese Simpsons characters are openly lesbian.\n\nPatty Bouvier\n\nMarge’s sister Patty was previously closeted. She was on a float in the gay parade chanting “We’re gay! We’re glad! But don’t tell Mom and Dad!”\n\nPatty came out to everyone, including her sister Marge, in Season 16 when she almost married Veronica.\n\nVerity Heathbar\n\nVerity left her husband Charles for lesbian character Patty Bouvier. They said they were brought together due to a mutual hatred for Homer Simpson.\n\nMiss Viola\n\nA lesbian Simpsons character who lives in a country house outside of Springfield with her wife, who was mistaken for her husband in one episode.\n\nIs Lisa Simpson lesbian?\n\nMany people have speculated with Lisa Simpson is a lesbian. In episodes and the movie, she shows a liking for boys, but people still think she may be yet to come out or even realise herself.\n\nIn one episode, it shows Lisa Simpson’s future. She had relationships with three girls (two overlapping), but she eventually goes on to marry Milhouse, suggesting she’s bisexual.\n\nHowever, these relationships may not be the Simpsons’ reality, so perhaps the timeline is false.\n\nBisexual Simpsons characters\n\nOther Simpsons characters are shown to be bisexual.\n\nThe Cool Moms\n\nExcluding Marge, The Cool Moms are four mothers who are married with kids. These ladies kiss each other during their meetings whenever Marge is away.\n\nCandace\n\nHomer’s ex-girlfriend Candace hinted that she was bisexual when she told Homer that she’d dated more girls than he had.\n\nNigel\n\nNigel is a billionaire who went to school with Mr Burns, and he meets Smithers through him.\n\nWhile unhappily married to a woman, Nigel kisses Smithers.\n\nTransgender Simpsons characters\n\nNot only are there gay, lesbian and bi representation, The Simpsons also has transgender characters.\n\nClara Hosenfrauen\n\nThis trans woman was formerly Roy Molloy.\n\nBrunella Pommelhorst\n\nA gym teacher at Springfield Elementary School, Brunella took a leave of absence to have gender reassignment surgery. She said that she would return as Mr Pommelhorst, the new shop teacher.\n\nHowever, she was later seen in the show looking the same.\n\nStanlerina\n\nStanlerina is a trans woman and her cousin is Helen Lovejoy, who may also be an LGBT character—potentially trans herself, as well as bisexual.\n\nPossible LGBT Simpsons characters\n\nLenny and Carl\n\nAlthough it’s never been officially confirmed, numerous episodes have hinted that these two best friends are attracted to each other.\n\nSea Captain\n\nIn the mobile game The Simpsons: Tapped Out, the Sea Captain implied that he is homosexual.\n\nHe jests that Ned Flanders is homosexual due to his decorating tips, to which Flanders says he’s not.\n\nIn response, the Sea Captain says, “Neither am I, wink-wink. Now let’s get to decorating, Girlfriend.”\n\nTodd Flanders and Rod Flanders\n\nIn an episode set in the future, the boys are gay and Bart knows but doesn’t out them, to Ned Flanders’ delight. This isn’t definite though due to the nature of the episode.\n\nSanta’s Little Helper\n\nSanta’s Little Helper could be portrayed as bisexual as he’s seen panting excitedly at the Springfield gay pride parade after a member of the Gay Dog Alliance winked at him.\n\nIn other episodes, it’s known that he mates with female dogs, She’s The Fastest and Rosa Barks.\n\nHelen Lovejoy\n\nIn one episode, a visiting character called the Parson tells Helen’s husband Reverend Timothy Lovejoy that he “remember[s] when [Helen Lovejoy] was Helen Schwartzbaum. In fact, I remember when she was Harold Schwartzbaum.”\n\nHelen also says, “Is that a woman’s voice I hear? Send her in,” when she was in the bedroom awaiting her husband.\n\nRalph Wiggum\n\nIn The Simpsons Movie, Bart Simpson is seen naked riding his skateboard. When he passes Ralph, the boy smiles and says “I like men now!” implying he could be gay or bi."
