        "text": "The Simpsons TV series has been one of the fundamental backbones of the Fox Network. It has existed almost as long as the network itself when it debuted in December 1989. The goliath of animated programming had humble origins as a series of animated shorts on the Tracy Ullman Show. Its fan-favorite segments would soon catapult the yellow-skinned family of five to receive their own series. Now, The Simpsons is currently the longest-running American animated show in television history. While there have been countless characters to come and go through its 35-year run, one character that has maintained a cult following is Bart Simpson’s evil twin brother.\n\nThis legendary animated series has a popular segment of its own that has become an expected staple of the franchise. The Simpsons’ Treehouse of Horror is a horror-comedy anthology that parodies popular scary movies or shows. Its first episode aired during the second season of The Simpsons back in 1990. The popularity of this special presentation would grow with each season. While there have been standout shorts like Dial D for Diddly, Toy Gory, and The Shinning, one iconic short was a fan-favorite titled, The Thing and I.\n\nThis segment aired during Season 8 of Treehouse of Horror that starred a paranoid Bart Simpson investigating noises in the walls of his house. It eventually led him to the attic where he discovered his formerly conjoined twin, Hugo. He seemed docile at first, but soon would reveal his intent to kill Bart and replace him in the family. This “Bizarro” version of the popular Simpsons character has maintained such nostalgic fanfare, that Adidas will release another limited series of shoes dedicated to Bart’s fish head-eating, evil twin.\n\nThe success of the iconic “Homer going into the bushes” meme as sneaker has prompted the German shoe company to make more Simpsons-inspired designs. “The Simpsons x Adidas Rivalry 86 Low Hugos” are slated for a Halloween time release. They will have a similar color scheme to Bart with yellow, blue, and orange. One will feature a bust of Bart on the tongue of the shoe, with Hugo’s face on the other. Both will also have the infamous conjoined scar stitched on each side, as well as come in an exclusive Treehouse of Horror box. There is no release date for these limited edition kicks, yet Adidas is expected to give an update for pre-orders closer to October."
