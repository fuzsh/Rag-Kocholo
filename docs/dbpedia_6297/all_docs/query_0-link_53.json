        "text": "In 1980, the DSM-III released. While there are many issues with both past and modern iterations of the DSM, this was significant for being the first time autism was clinically recognized as its own experience.\n\nSeven years later, “The Simpsons” shorts began airing as part of The Tracy Ullman Show, and two years after that, the first episode of the Simpsons television series aired.\n\nAutism has been a recognized entity for the entirety of The Simpsons’ 34-year run. With the franchise’s reputation as a satire of modern society, you’d likely expect that they’d have tackled one of the most well-known developmental disabilities in Western society.\n\nSurprisingly, this hasn’t been the case. Both through my own viewing of the entire series and a quick search through transcripts, neither the word “autism” nor “autistic” has ever been said in the show.\n\nThe only autistic character to appear in the show was Raymond, the character from Rain Man. He cameoed back in season 5’s “$pringfield.”\n\nIn this appearance, Homer clamors for him to “do that card-counting thing again.” Raymond tells him that he needs to leave, but Homer continues pushing. This causes Raymond to start screaming and hurting himself, which Homer imitates.\n\nExcluding this cameo and an autistic guest star or so, no autistic character has ever appeared in the series. However, this doesn’t mean that autism has never been relevant to the show.\n\nRepresentation doesn’t just exist in canon, it also exists in implications and subtext, even ones unintended by the creator(s). Though intentional autistic representation is hard to come by, unintentional rep is quite common.\n\nWhen it comes to the traits people find endearing in a character, autism is everywhere. It’s in a character’s idiosyncracies, in their passions, in their emotional hypersensitivities and their social insensitivites.\n\nEveryone loves an autistic character, even if they fail to have the same respect for autistic people.\n\nIn many autistics’ opinions — including my own — this is one of the reasons why unintentional representation is better than most intentional rep: intentional representation is usually made with bias and stereotypes in mind, while unintentionally autistic characters are simply written as characters.\n\nThe Simpsons is no exception. Whereas explicitly autistic characters may be limited to a few cameos, several recurring — even main — characters show signs of autism throughout the series.\n\nIn this article, I’ll list several characters with strong autistic subtext, as well as some other developmentally disabled characters in the franchise.\n\nWhat is considered an autistic character?\n\nTo write a whole article about autistic characters in a series with no canonical autistic representation, I have to have some type of basis behind my assertions.\n\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with baseless headcanons, I prefer to keep my work more scholarly in nature. For this reason, I propose three requirements for subtextual autism identification:\n\nDifferences in social skills, including both social understanding and behavior\n\n“Restricted/repetitive behavior:” stimming, special interests/hyperfixations, need for predictability, and/or sensory issues\n\nNeither characteristic is better explained by trauma, cultural differences, or a different type of neurodivergence\n\nThese are characteristics that every modern definition of autism agrees are present in every autistic person. I won’t demand the characters live up to exact DSM/ICD criteria, but they do have to display these overarching characteristics for me to count them as autistic rep.\n\nMarge Simpson\n\nMarge is undoubtedly the most prominent autistic character in the series, being one of two members of the main family to fit my criteria for fictional autism.\n\nMarge isn’t usually portrayed with many friends. In most episodes, she only interacts with her family and maybe some acquaintances. In the few episodes where she’s portrayed with a preexisting friend group, they oftentimes view her as a killjoy.\n\nShe’s expressly stated that it’s hard for her to make friends. While some parts of this are unrelated to her autism, (E.G. Homer) she does seem to have sincere trouble socializing.\n\nOne notable issue for her is that she has trouble reading the room. For example, in “The President Wore Pearls,” she has this exchange with Bart:\n\nLisa: Well, I think I can say with all humility, I am gonna be the best school president ever!\n\nBart: [slow clap, sarcastic tone] Bravo, Lisa. Bravo.\n\nMarge: Oh, isn’t that sweet? Even your brother’s adding his kudos.\n\nBart: I was being sarcastic.\n\nMarge: You were?\n\nBart: [even more sarcastic] No, I was being sincere.\n\nIn addition to her poor recognition of sarcasm, she can also have trouble understanding when others have malicious intentions. An example of this occurs in “Beware My Cheating Bart:”\n\n[Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney stand in the family’s backyard, hiding and holding weapons]\n\nMarge: Why if it isn’t Jimbo, Dorf, and Ernie! Bart’s not home yet, but I’m always looking to encourage non-Milhouse playdates! Stick around!\n\nBeyond her social troubles, Marge is shown to crave routine and predictability. For Marge, even mundane changes constitute as a form of thrill-seeking, such as changing the type of ham she purchases.\n\nThough episodes like “Jaws Wired Shut” show that she becomes dangerously restless without some degree of chaos in her life, she’s also shown wishing that she could live a life of constant predictability, with no change whatsoever:\n\nLisa: The elderly aren’t like you and me, Bart. They thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises.\n\nMarge: Sounds good to me!\n\nMarge also experiences justice sensitivity, a common characteristic of autism. Many episodes that focus on her involve her going up against something she sees as wrong or immoral.\n\nHer aversion to risk and capacity for moral outrage have generally become infamous among her peers. In “$pringfield,” everyone immediately expects her to be against legalized gambling the moment it’s proposed, and in “The Twisted World of Marge Simpson,” her friend group kicks her out for being a “wet blanket.”\n\nShe’s also sometimes portrayed with hyperfixations. A famous example of this is her preoccupation with potatoes in “Sweet Seymour Skinner’s Baadasssss Song:”\n\nBart: Mom, you’re always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?\n\nMarge: I just think they’re neat.\n\nLisa Simpson\n\nSocial isolation is a major part of Lisa’s life. Though many episodes surround her temporarily making friends, other recurring children deem her nerdy and unlikable.\n\nIn some cases, she feels the need to mask to fit in. This is shown most notably in the episode “Summer of 4 Ft. 2,” in which she acts disinterested and somewhat vapid to befriend other children while on vacation.\n\nMuch like her mother, Lisa experiences justice sensitivity, though her sense of justice is much more liberal than Marge’s.\n\nIn “Moaning Lisa” — the first episode centering around her — she says the following about her music:\n\n“I’m wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car, the Iowa farmer whose land was taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats, the West Virginia coal miner — ”\n\nThe episode largely follows her feelings of despair, as she’s unable to enjoy life knowing that “there’s so much suffering in the world.”\n\nShe also has strong interests in a few different subjects. Politics itself could be considered a special interest of hers, but she’s also shown a consistent fixation on ponies since the first episode, in which she pleads to get one for Christmas.\n\nAnother example of her pony SpIn is in “Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield,” in which her passion for both politics and ponies are shown as something that Marge — increasingly preoccupied with fitting in at her country club — has a diminishing tolerance for.\n\nThough Lisa sees country clubs as “a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers,” she immediately becomes attached to the horses at the club. Later in the episode, she has this exchange with Marge:\n\nLisa: Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? ’Cause I heard —\n\nMarge: I don’t know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one.\n\nLisa: [talking increasingly fast] Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons I like horses better than cars? One, a horse never has to —\n\nMarge: [talking over unintelligible infodumping] I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa. Would you mind just…?\n\nLisa: You know how a horse goes like this? [jumping up and down] Whee! Whee! Mom! Mom!\n\nMarge: [over repeated calls for her attention, mumbling] I’ve already altered this so many times…\n\nLisa: Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!\n\nMarge: [yelling] Lisa, please!\n\nOf course, she loves jazz. However, I wouldn’t say that this reaches the level of fixated, specially interested, infodumping passion seen for ponies and politics.\n\nBeyond explicit signs of autism, she’s also highly intelligent. While intelligence — high or low — is not an autistic characteristic, both notably high and notably low IQs are associated with autism. Lisa has an IQ of 159, high enough above the roughly 100-IQ average for her to qualify for Mensa in “They Saved Lisa’s Brain.”\n\nHer intelligence is shown to be a major reason she’s ostracized from her peers. Her focus on education is loathed by both the children and adults of Springfield, a largely anti-intellectual population.\n\nAt times, her nerdy tendencies bring out her social differences. In the comic “More of Homer’s Halloween Carols,” she interrupts Homer’s carol parodies with the “Boar’s Head Carol,” a Christmas carol from the 15th century, much to the frustration of everyone around her.\n\nC. Montgomery Burns\n\nMany of Mr. Burns’ eccentric mannerisms are in line with autistic experiences. An example of this is his frequent use of outdated terminology.\n\nThough the show mostly attributes this to his age, he’s the only senior in the show that speaks like this, (excluding his own mother) even though the other elderly characters are often only a few decades younger than him.\n\nAt points, he not only uses archaic terms, but full-on neologisms. Examples of this include “flunjers,” “capdabblers,” “smendlers,” “velocitator,” “deleceratrix,” “shirkaday,” “faxtrola,” “foodbag,” “bathiola,” and “dungeonarium,” among many others.\n\nLike both Marge and Lisa, Burns doesn’t have many friends. Smithers considers himself to be Burns’ best friend, he sometimes gets along with Homer, and he’s occasionally seen with other wealthy people, but multiple episodes drive home that nobody (except the obvious) truly likes him.\n\nWhile a major part of this is his irritable, self-centered personality, this challenge is still present in episodes where he genuinely tries to be kind to people, which become increasingly common as the series progresses and his villainous attributes are downplayed.\n\nSeason 7’s “Team Homer” perhaps offered the first instance of him being sincerely friendly with others. In this episode, he joins a bowling team with Homer and a few other characters.\n\nDespite the fact that none of them want him there, he seems to think of himself as an accepted part of the group. At one point, Moe attempts to injure him to get him off the team, but this ends up popping his knee back into place. He thanks him, believing that his intention was to help all along.\n\nHe has trouble recognizing how others feel, in general. In this episode, he reacts lightheartedly to his fingernail falling into Homer’s drink, and in another, he tries to impress a working-class woman by saying that he enjoys “piloting motorcoaches and collecting dog waste.” In neither case does he detect the other party’s disgust.\n\nAt points, jokes can go straight over his head. “Monty Can’t Buy Me Love” features a scene in which he goes on a raunchy radio show to try to improve his reputation.\n\nAfter several scatological questions — most of which he’s not too fazed by — the host begins playing flatulent sound effects, which he does not take well to:\n\nBurns: [over farting sounds] Stop that! Attention wireless listeners: most of the sounds you are now hearing are not being made by me! Oh, stop! Stop! Won’t someone please stop the farting!\n\n[Burns collapses dead on the floor, having gone into cardiac arrest]\n\n“Monty Can’t Buy Me Love” provides a significant example of another autistic experience: sensory issues.\n\nAt the end of this episode, he successfully builds a positive reputation, but becomes overstimulated by camera flashes. When he goes into overload and accidentally destroys the stage, the crowd believes that he’s trying to harm them, thus placing him back where he started.\n\nHis visual hypersensitivity is shown in some other episodes, as well: in “Homer the Smithers,” he’s startled by a bright lamp, and in a more exaggerated example, he’s literally blown away by a spotlight in “Monty Burns’ Fleeing Circus.”\n\nIt’s implied that he may also have other sensory hypersensitivities.\n\nIn “Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish,” he’s visibly disoriented by the Simpson family’s loud, disorganized eating at dinner.\n\nIn earlier episodes, he was also very touch-avoidant. The aforementioned episode had his team warn the family that he hates being touched, “Brush with Greatness” shows him yelling and panicking when Maggie grabs onto his leg, (this was before she shot him, by the way) and he’s repulsed by Bart — then his adopted son — hugging him in “Burns’ Heir.”\n\nThough you could argue that the signs of autism he displays are better explained by his dementia, the comics provide evidence that he’s always been this way.\n\nThe most significant piece of evidence for this comes from “Little Monty Million$: Adventure on Bigfoot Mountain!”, which follows his troubles making friends with other children. A later story in the same release portrays him as continuing to be unpopular into adolescence, even among his similarly wealthy peers.\n\n“Now Museum, Now You Don’t!” further supports this, as he compares his childhood self to Ralph Wiggum, a character who largely serves as a caricature of a neurodivergent child.\n\nWaylon/Wanda Smithers\n\n(Note: I’m using a feminine name in this section’s title, as it’s what Smithers — an implied trans woman — considers going by in “Frink Gets Testy.” However, I’ll use he/him throughout the rest of the article, as it’s what he currently goes by in the show)\n\nAlthough this attribute was written out over time, Smithers was portrayed as having trouble with subtext in the earlier seasons.\n\nIn season 3’s “Lisa’s Pony,” Burns tries to excuse a fit of evil laughter by saying that he “was just thinking about something funny Smithers did.” Oblivious to the lie, he reminds him that he hadn’t done anything funny.\n\nA season later in “Last Exit to Springfield,” Burns is shown telling him to get “the kind [of strikebreakers] they had in the ‘30s.” Rather than getting strikebreakers that used the same tactics, he instead got several elderly men. (Which, truthfully, I didn’t realize was the incorrect assumption until an allistic pointed it out to me)\n\nAdmittedly, he doesn’t seem to have much trouble socializing nowadays. He’s still a bit more awkward than other characters, but he seems to understand typical social skills just fine. Nonetheless, as earlier episodes are still part of the series’ canon, I’ve decided to count these moments anyway.\n\nAs for repetitive behavior, his interest in Malibu Stacy is an obvious example of this: he has the world’s largest collection of the dolls, runs a newsletter dedicated to the franchise, and has even written and co-starred in a Malibu Stacy musical.\n\nAt points, the thought of breaking routine also seems to bother him. In “Who Shot Mr. Burns,” he states that he never misses an episode of Pardon My Zinger; later, he ends up drunkenly shooting Jasper to avoid missing the start of that night’s episode.\n\nNed Flanders\n\nLike Burns, one of Ned’s defining mannerisms is his eccentric speech patterns. However, this arguably doesn’t count towards him being autistic, as “Hurricane Neddy” shows that these habits only originated from trauma, not any innate differences in communication.\n\nHowever, just because Ned’s speech patterns themselves aren’t indicative of communicative differences doesn’t mean that he has typical social skills.\n\nIt’s shown that he tends to assume good faith in everyone, to the point of not easily recognizing when others are acting in bad faith.\n\nFor example, in “When Flanders Fails,” Homer spends the entire episode sabotaging Ned behind his back and ridiculing him to his face. Still, once Homer’s efforts pay off, Ned praises him for “trying to warn” him, not realizing that he was simply being mocked the whole time.\n\nHe can take Homer’s insults literally, such as in this moment from “Rosebud:”\n\nHomer: Hey, Flanders! You smell like manure!\n\nNed: Uh-oh, better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose news, Neighbor!\n\nNed is extremely unadventurous. This is the subject of a mid-life crisis in “Viva Ned Flanders:”\n\n[Ned and his family drive home from church]\n\nNed: [sigh] Can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were…were making fun of old Steady Neddy.\n\nMaude: Well, you may be a bit cautious, but what’s wrong with that? Some people like chunky peanut butter, some like smooth.\n\nNed: Mhm, and some people just steer clear of that whole hornet’s nest. I’ll stick with plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a —\n\nMaude, Rod, and Todd: Glass of water on the side for dippin’!\n\nNed: [suddenly stops the car] Gosh darn it! Am I that pre-diddly-ictable?\n\nMost of the “risks” Ned takes are very minimal. For example, the comics state that he eats Thai BBQ once a year, counting that as his share of risk-taking.\n\nThough autistics are more likely than neurotypicals to be non-religious, his religious extremism could also be tied to his autism. Many autistics become very attached to specific rules and guidelines; for Ned, this may mean feeling the need to follow the laws of Christianity to a T.\n\nAlthough it’s not brought up often, he’s also shown to be a major fan of The Beatles. He has a large Beatles collection, consisting of decorations, clothes, branded drinks, and many other rare items. Considering his other autistic characteristics, this could easily be counted as a special interest.\n\nPatty & Selma Bouvier\n\nContent warning: Mentions of kidnapping.\n\nThough Patty and Selma are two different characters, what gives them autistic subtext is the same for both; thus, I’ve decided it best to keep them grouped together.\n\nOne of the most noticeable characteristics about either of the twins is their reduced affect display. They largely speak in monotone voices, and changes in their facial expressions are rarely intense or long-sustained.\n\nThey also had a clear special interest in MacGyver, namely seeming fixated on the titular character. In the first half of the series, this interest was one of their defining quirks.\n\nThey don’t take particularly well to criticism of MacGyver. In “Black Widower,” Selma nearly called off her marriage to Sideshow Bob due to his hatred of the series; a man can only love her if he also embraces MacGyver.\n\nLater on in “A Star is Burns,” both Patty and Selma attack Jay Sherman (the main character of The Critic) for calling MacGyver gay.\n\nTheir fixation on MacGyver culminated in season 17’s “Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore,” in which they kidnap Richard Dean Anderson, the actor who played the character.\n\nIn this episode, Anderson discovers a love of escaping through the incident, encouraging Patty and Selma to continue kidnapping him for his enjoyment. The twins eventually tire of him and make an effort to drive the man away.\n\nAlthough they’re no longer interested in MacGyver — and no entity has taken his place since — this 16-year-long affair shows their capacity for special interests.\n\nOther neurodevelopmentally disabled characters\n\nWhile there are several autistic characters in the series, autism is far from the only neurodevelopmental disability represented in The Simpsons.\n\nA few other characters in the show have some type of developmental disability, most of which are even more explicit than the show’s portrayals of autism.\n\nNote that I’m only including neurodevelopmental disabilites, not neurodivergence as a whole. Essentially every Simpsons character is neurodivergent, so there’s no time-effective way to list every ND character in the whole franchise.\n\nHomer Simpson\n\nTechnically, Homer fits my first two criteria, but he didn’t make the cut due to the existence of other neurodivergencies in him.\n\nHomer is heavily implied to have ADHD and an intellectual disability.\n\nHe’s extremely inattentive, impulsive, and prone to executive dysfunction. In episodes like “Homer at the Bat” and “The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,” he also shows a capacity for hyperfocus and hyperfixations.\n\nWhile his ADHD is always obvious, the fact that these implications are intentional are made clear through Bart.\n\nAs we’ll discuss soon, Bart also has ADHD. Though his neurotype is only identified in season 11, the issues that come with it are first highlighted in season 2’s “Bart Gets an F.” In the episode, this plays out with the school’s psychiatrist:\n\n“I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as “fear of failure.” As a result, Bart is an underachiever, and yet he seems to be…how should I put this…proud of it. One of his problems may be his short attention span, which can lead to — ”\n\n[from Homer’s perspective]\n\n“Blah blah blah blah blah blah…Blah blah blah blah blah blah.”\n\nWhen Bart is directly labeled in “Brother’s Little Helper,” this exchange occurs:\n\nPrincipal Skinner: Bart has a classic case of attention-deficit disorder.\n\nMarge: You mean like John Leguizamo?\n\nPrincipal Skinner: How should I know? The point is ADD makes children restless and easily distracted.\n\nHomer: [speaking through a cone used earlier to demonstrate Bart’s negative influence on his peers] Hi, Marge. It’s me, Homer.\n\nPrincipal Skinner: [clears throat]\n\nHomer: [still through the cone] What? Time to go?\n\nPrincipal Skinner: Please, Mr. Simpson. I’m afraid I’ll have to expel your son…unless you’re willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous —\n\nHomer: Candy bar?\n\nPrincipal Skinner: No! It’s a new drug called Focusyn.\n\nIn both cases, the obvious implication is that Homer also has ADHD, likely being the genetic reason for his son’s experiences.\n\nAs for his intellectual disability, Homer has an IQ of 55. Though IQs are an extremely limited, even prejudiced measure of intelligence, it’s generally accepted that any IQ lower than 70 tends to be a sign of intellectual disability.\n\nBeyond his low IQ, Homer also struggles with many skills commonly impaired in intellectual disability. He can’t easily read or write, understand other people, cook, or manage his own finances. In some cases, he’s so severely disabled that he can’t even dress himself without Marge’s help.\n\nBart Simpson\n\nAs stated before, Bart canonically has ADHD. Bart is the only character whose developmental disability is verbally confirmed, not simply implied.\n\nThough Bart’s ADHD is less obvious than his father’s, it’s always been there. The first sign of this in the show was in the third episode — “Homer’s Odyssey” — which showed Bart restlessly getting up during a presentation.\n\nAlthough Bart’s character has been watered down over time into simply not caring, earlier episodes showed how his underperformance was not due to a lack of care, but a lack of executive functioning.\n\nA major example of this is “Bart Gets an F,” which shows that a combination of poor prioritization skills and limited concentration greatly limits his academic performance. Other episodes show that he does perfectly well in school when he’s cognitively stimulated.\n\nIn recent years, you could argue that he’s also learning/intellectually disabled.\n\nRather than his earlier portrayal as afraid of failure and of average intelligence, modern episodes largely portray him as careless and of slightly higher intelligence than his father.\n\nA major point towards him having a learning/intellectual disability is the episode “The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants,” in which Lisa has to teach Bart how to read.\n\nHowever, you could also argue against this as a sign of disability, as he’s able to permanently learn to read on an age-typical level, unlike the permanent delay present in most learning/intellectually disabled people.\n\nProfessor John Frink\n\nAdmittedly, Professor Frink shows some signs of being autistic. However, he lacks the non-social components that would allow him to fully qualify.\n\nOne thing he does have, though, are tics. Certain episodes highlight the fact that his characteristic vocalizations are completely involuntary, such as this scene in “Super Franchise Me:”\n\nMarge: Professor, could you say “welcome to Mother Hubbard’s Sandwich Cupboard” without making any other noises?\n\nProf. Frink: Of course I can, my dear child. “Welcome to…Mother Hubbard’s…” uh… “Sandwich — ” mcboing boing glavin flyvy hyvy goyvyn…! Now I’m running to the unemployment office. Blervyk.”\n\nTics are a neurodivergent trait. Though there’s no confirmation as to what caused Professor Frink’s tics — as not all tics are neurodevelopmental in nature— it’s possibly that they could be the result of a developmental difference, such as Tourette’s or another tic diagnosis. (Note that Tourette’s also involves motor tics, which he sometimes displays alongside his vocal ones)\n\nThough, it’s worth noting that his vocalizations manifesting involuntarily isn’t a consistent fact. For example, “Frinkcoin” portrays them as something he developed as a child to avoid being neglected by his busy parents.\n\nWhether or not Professor Frink has a neurodevelopmental disability is debatable, but the groundwork is definitely present.\n\nRalph Wiggum\n\nRalph is perhaps the most obviously disabled character in the series, existing in all but the earliest seasons to serve as a caricature of intellectually disabled people.\n\nUnlike Homer, Ralph doesn’t have a confirmed IQ, but his low intelligence is blatant. He has trouble with most every cognitive function and has developmental delays in every area, from social understanding to using the restroom on his own.\n\nHow is autism represented in The Simpsons?\n\nContent warning: Discussions of misogyny, ableism, fatphobia, and kidnapping.\n\nFrom my perspective, autism is only represented by pure coincidence. As I stated before, I believe that what these characters have is accidental subtext, not true coding, which only occurs as part of intentional-yet-unstated representation.\n\nComedies like The Simpsons thrive off of exaggerated, eccentric, somewhat (or extremely) inept characters. As autism is all of these things to allistics, this makes it quite easy to accidentally produce autistic characters.\n\nWith this in mind, I feel that it’d be unfair to judge the show by the messages it sends about autistic people directly, as there really are none. The average person is not going to watch The Simpsons and come to any conclusions about autism itself.\n\nHowever, I do see it as fair to examine how it represents autistic behavior. While I doubt the series has instilled any conscious bias for or against autistics, it likely has led people to conclusions about behavior that — unbeknownst to them — is part of autism.\n\nFor the most part, I don’t see much of an issue with most of these characters. Many of their autistic behaviors are supposed to be seen as double-edged swords (E.G. Marge and Lisa’s justice sensitivity) and many aren’t moralized at all.\n\nIn a matter of fact, I think Marge and Lisa in particular could make great confirmed representation, if they ever felt so bold. They represent a long-ignored demographic: autistic women/girls.\n\nNot just that, but Marge’s life as a mother of three and Lisa’s present and future success go against the commonly held beliefs that autistics are incapable of raising children or succeeding in life.\n\nIf any character in the series were confirmed as autistic, I think Marge or Lisa would benefit the community most.\n\nHowever, one set of characters that I do take issue with are Patty and Selma. I’d say they’re the only characters here whose autistic characteristics are regularly treated as unsightly in some way.\n\nMatt Groening intended their flat voices to “suck the life out of everything.” Their special interests are also portrayed as far more harmful than other characters’: whereas Lisa, Smithers, and Ned’s fixations are all portrayed rather whimsically, the same isn’t true for the twins.\n\nWhile the others get to express their passion through infodumps and collections, Patty and Selma’s fixations are portrayed as making them hyperemotional and sometimes outright dangerous.\n\nThis isn’t to say that there aren’t any autistics like this, but it’s about the intentions; you’re not supposed to sympathize with them on the same level that you are the other autistic characters here.\n\nI think this has to do with the misogyny baked into Patty and Selma’s characters; they’re considered “unideal” women, and the show never lets you forget that.\n\nThey’re chronically single, fat, and dominant, with all of these characteristics being made fun of much more than in men who have similar qualities. They exist to embody the quintessential “bitch” sisters-in-law.\n\nPresent representation aside, do I think The Simpsons could pull off a canonically autistic character? To put it bluntly, no.\n\nThe Simpsons has a long history of ableism. Characters like Ralph are minimized purely to the most “troubled” parts of their disabilities, made to be laughed at rather than laughed with.\n\nEven Bart isn’t free of the stigma that comes with confirmed disability. When he was being labeled with ADHD, he was described — in relation to his neurotype — as a “ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that’s good and true.”\n\nReferences to his ADHD often exist only to belittle it as something that’s taken too seriously. “Brother’s Little Helper” wasn’t actually written with much knowledge on ADHD, but simply out of a “feeling” that medicating children with it was a threat to our society.\n\nSo far, I haven’t been given reason to believe that an autistic character would be much different. Though autism tends to be taken more seriously than ADHD, why would The Simpsons only try now to do right by neurodivergent people?\n\nEven if any intentional portrayals of autism weren’t supposed to be dehumanizing, who’s to say that they wouldn’t simply be written off of a “feeling” of what it means to identify as autistic? An ADHD overdiagnosis scare in the ‘90s, an autism self-identification scare in the 2020s.\n\nIf they were to utilize preexisting characters — as shown with Bart — this still doesn’t guarantee respect. Most past, intentional portrayals of neurodivergence — in the form of developmental disability or otherwise — have shown that much of the staff (or at least a loud minority thereof) sees it as something to be mocked, not to be humanized.\n\nUntil mainstream standards for autistic representation improve, I think it’s for the best that The Simpsons has yet to tackle autism. Even with the flaws in their subtextual representation, we’re still doing better than any confirmed representation they’ve shown themselves as capable of."
