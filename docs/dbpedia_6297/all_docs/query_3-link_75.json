        "text": "Carsales Staff•14 May 2018\n\nFEATURE\n\nThe 10 most iconic cars from The Simpsons\n\nThere’s more to the way our fave cartoon family moves around Springfield than just the classic red and pink wagons in the opening credits.\n\nBut since there are almost 30 years’ worth of episodes for us to choose from, and plenty of rides stuck in our memories, narrowing the list of iconic Simpsons cars down to these 10 was tricky, to say the least!\n\n1. The Homer\n\nWhen Homer found his long-lost half-brother Herb, he discovered his sibling was an automotive mogul. Herb thought Homer was the perfect “average American” to design a new car for Powell Motors. But when the $82,000 “Car of the ’90s” was unveiled, it immediately sent Herb bankrupt.\n\n2. Li’l Lightnin’\n\nAn attempt to become a better father leads Homer to help Bart build his first ever soapbox racer, for an upcoming derby. Li’l Lightnin’ doesn’t last long on the track, but after Martin injures himself and bequeaths his own racer to Bart, the Simpson kid is still crowned champion.\n\n3. John’s convertible\n\nA truly iconic Simpsons episode, ‘Homer’s Phobia’ enlists the talents of kitsch legend John Waters to play the family’s new friend, John, an antiques dealer. While Homer’s confronting his homophobia, John is taking the family on an underground tour of the town in his stretch convertible, complete with zebra-print seats.\n\n4. Bart’s rented car\n\nIn a plot journey that could only exist in Springfield, Bart spends ‘go to work with your parents’ day at the DMV with Patty and Selma, where he makes himself a fake drivers licence. He rents a car and drives Nelson, Martin and Milhouse to the World’s Fair in Knoxville. After getting stranded, Bart becomes a courier and ships himself – and his friends – back home. Besides all that, this episode really gave us one of the most stylish sequences in Simpsons history:\n\n5. Otto’s pool-mobile\n\nBefore the Simpsons get their pool and Bart breaks his leg and thinks he witnesses Ned Flanders murdering his wife, the kids of Springfield try to beat the heatwave by diving into the tray of Otto’s short-lived Pool-Mobile.\n\n6. The Tall Man’s Beetle\n\nIn his instalment of the 1996 anthology episode, Nelson dishes out his famous “HA-ha” at everyone in his vicinity. But one of them – a comically tall man in a tiny VW Beetle – turns the tables on him.\n\n7. Mr Plow’s plow-mobile\n\nCall Mr Plow.\n\nThat’s my name.\n\nThat name again is Mr Plow.\n\n8. Kirk’s bed\n\nA disastrous dinner party leads to Milhouse’s parents getting into increasingly bigger disagreements, and they eventually split up. Milhouse’s dad, Kirk – the artist behind the famous ‘dignity’ illustration – is then fired from his job at the cracker factory and winds up sleeping in a racing-car bed (something that, TBH, is a lot cooler than the show makes it out to be).\n\n9. Marge’s Canyonero\n\nMarge initially hates the SUV Homer buys. But when Homer finds out it’s a “women’s car”, he makes Marge drive it and she becomes a true suburban mum – complete with wild road rage. Canyoneroooooo!\n\n10. The OG Simpsons’ cars\n\nThey sat behind dozens of different wheels over the years, but the Simpsons were always at their best when they rode in Marge’s red car – the one that once doubled as her Pretzel-wagon – or Homer’s pink one. The 1973 Plymouth Valiant might’ve been made in Croatia out of old Soviet tanks (as Homer once told his enemy, Grimey), but it took Bart to his first rock concert and became Lisa’s memento of her friends from the beach.\n\nRelated: Top 10 movie and TV cars\n\nRelated: The times The Simpsons starred in car ads around the world\n\nRelated: Keeping up with the Kardashians' cars: Five we’d happily drive"
