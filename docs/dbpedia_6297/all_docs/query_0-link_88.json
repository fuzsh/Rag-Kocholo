        "text": "The Simpsons has given fans so many classic episodes of the years, and so many of those all-time greats come from their yearly Halloween tradition: the Treehouse of Horror. The tradition started in Season 2, when Bart and Lisa took to the backyard treehouse and traded three attempts at scary stories. Bart tells the tale of a haunted house that decides to disappear into a vortex rather than live with the Simpsons. Tale two is part giving his spin on an old Twilight Zone tale that features our first taste, if you will, of Kang and Kodos. and Lisa wraps things up with a classic gothic tale: an amazing reading of Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs The Raven by James Earl Jones. Bart doesn‚Äôt love the tale, however, and when Homer as the poem‚Äôs lovelorn subject, answers the front door to find no apparent cause for the rapping sound, older brother chides Lisa: ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs scarier than nothing? ANYTHING!‚Äù Compared to later installments of the Treehouse, this first Halloween special doesn‚Äôt pack the hilarious punches or include the great quotable moments ‚Äî well there is the line ‚ÄúIf your goal was to make Sarak the Preparer cry, mission accomplished‚Äù ‚Äî but this episode gave rise to the greatest Halloween institution ‚Ä¶ other than going door to door in search of candy. You know what‚Äôs better than the Treehouse of Horror to get you into the Halloween spirit? Nothing!\n\nRating (on a scale of 1 to 5 pumpkins, 5 being the best): üéÉüéÉüéÉ 1/2\n\nIt‚Äôs not the greatest Treehouse episode, but it‚Äôs the one that started it all. And since it‚Äôs the second day of the month of fright, it‚Äôs good to start at the beginning. Good episode, great legacy. You won‚Äôt be frightened, but you will feel eager to watch more Simpsons Halloween episodes after seeing this one. And, if you continue to follow my Delight or Fright viewing guide, you might be seeing The Simpsons pop up several more times.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_(The_Simpsons_episode)\n\nhttp://www.simpsonsworld.com/\n\nDelight or Fright: Experience a full month of Halloween thrills by watching a special selection each night."
