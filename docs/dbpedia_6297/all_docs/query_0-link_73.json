        "text": "* Season 1 to 10 ONLY (I know Golden Age means different things to different people but I have to put a cap on somewhere)\n\n* No clip show episodes allowed, that's too easy.\n\nMy choices are:\n\nSecrets of a Successful Marriage: S5, Episode 22. Long before \"Jerk Ass Homer\" was a thing, he is a complete asshole to Marge here, the ending is terrible too.\n\nMy Sister, My Sitter: S8, Episode 18. It just gets more miserable as it goes along and not fun for really any character.\n\nSimpsons Bible Stories: Season 10, Episode 18. Non-Halloween 3 parters are normally never good and this was one of the first.\n\nThe Otto Show: S3, Episode 22. Someone like Otto just can't carry a whole episode as the main character, The Spinal Tap appearance is good and that's about it.\n\nHomerpalooza: Season 7, Episode 24. It's aged a lot and is not as good as other \"Star Studded\" episodes like Krusty Gets Kancelled, for example.\n\nWhen You Dish Upon a Star: S10, Episode 5. Yes, the Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin one. It just doesn't work and a sign of things to come. It feels like it could be like a late teens episode tbh. Not a compliment.\n\nWhat would your choices be?\n\nI find Bart Gets Hit By A Car very unsatisfying. I used to put it on the same level as other Mr Burns stories like Rosebud and Blood Feud, but the ending fizzles to nothing, after Mr Burns gets no comeuppance, it becomes about Homer and Marge's marriage .....staying the exact same when there were no stakes before.\n\nLisa The Simpson is from a weird alternative dimension. I enjoy Lisa's internal struggle but the ending being 'every male Simpson is a dumb loser' doesn't make sense when you have Homer's half brother Herb as a millionaire (twice) and later on it is completely undone by Homer really being smart but having a crayon in his brain.\n\nMy Sister, My Sitter has one aggravating plotline and sticks to it throughout.\n\nI don't even know the name, but the one where Sideshow Bob is trying to blow up Krusty was the first Bob episode that wasn't iconic for me. It felt like they scooped up all the discarded jokes from the better Bob episodes.\n\nPicking on season 10 is a little predictable but it does really vary in quality. I think one of the signs the show was deteriorating was when they got lazy with celebrity guests, it was no longer cleverly done or with a memorable one-off character, instead it was \"Hey look it's (celeb name)\". When You Dish Upon A Star is when it got tedious. Kidney Trouble might aswell be called 'Jerkass Homer', that's what it is essentially. I also remember the Loch Ness Monster episode being very light in laughs."
