        "text": "SPOLER ALERT: This The Simpsons review contains things you won’t be able to unlearn.\n\nThe Simpsons: Season 27 Episode 1.\n\nThe Simpsons are really double dipping too much. I’m beginning to think Harry Shearer had a point in not wanting to come back. Usually a season opener is better than the season but when it’s a lackluster reheated plot served up like it was phoned in you have wonder who was really diagnosed with narcolepsy here. And tagging on such a copout ending is a wakeup call for “Every Man’s Dream.”\n\nMarge and Homer didn’t have this much trouble in the earlier seasons. It seems that one quarter of their shows now are about the impending implosion of their marriage. Yet, Maggie still needs a diaper change. I understand how the marriage might be cracking under all Marge’s enabling and Homer’s allowing her to enable. These cracks used to fuel the Simpsons, now the series is stuck in the groove. It’s no wonder Bart is looking for pity hugs from stupid Flanders and his stupid tear-dickey.\n\nSometimes knowing a how a character’s behavior will play out in advance kills the joke. In series comedy, behavior becomes set-up. We know Homer is going to take advantage of the narcolepsy label. Who wouldn’t? It is a perfect malady for the working man. Everyone is too tired all the time and could drop off at any moment. I did it twice watching this episode.\n\nThere were a few Simpsons gags that have become perennial. I love how Moe just drives away from the bar when confronted with annoying customers. That really is the answer to everything, not the GHB. And when Barney cleans himself up after he learns that Marge is a free woman again, he combs his hair with the juice from the bar onions. This is reminiscent of when he took out Marge’s sister, although at least then he got to drink a whole pitcher by himself.\n\nTherapy never bodes well for Marge. Every time she unpacks her brain to a counselor, they immediately want her to dump Homer. But Marge used to rebel against those who would destroy the family Simpson. When Homer went to catch a fish instead of attending Rev. Lovejoy’s camp meetings, Marge still found it in her heart to let him off the hook. When Homer divorced Marge in order to really renew their wedding vows, she didn’t follow Moe out the back of the bar.\n\nDo we wonder what Candace sees in Homer? We wonder nothing but, I mean, he kinda does look like an overweight snowman, but aside from that? Oh, the drugs. Right. Does this mean Homer sleeps with Candace? This was the first actual case of infidelity in Homer and Marge’s marriage. It is surprising that it happened to Homer.\n\nWe know from her Maxim spread that Marge is a desirable lady. She has been courted by at least two of the richest men in Springfield, Artie Ziff and Monty Burns. Every time The Simpsons envisions a future for Marge without Homer, she marries up. She was a Bouvier after all. Her sisters’ images might be a buzzkill, but Marge is irreplaceable for Homer and when she changes her name and Facebook relationship status it becomes all too real. It is interesting how Marge is the trophy date of the Homer’s date’s dad.\n\nIf only “Every Man’s Dream” had used the narcolepsy for evil, instead of good, they wouldn’t have wasted a perfectly comical premise. In earlier seasons, Homer might have slept his way to the top, narcolepsing through the dizzying heights, shattering lows and creamy middles. Homer could have avoided all manner of advice, criticism and Bouvier. Maybe if we shared some of the pharmaceuticals we’d have a better time out."
