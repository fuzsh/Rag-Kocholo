        "text": "The long awaited mashup between the Family Guy and The Simpsons premiered on September 28th, 2014, after nearly a year of excitement and speculation, and, of course, it failed to live up to the hype and expectations.\n\nFans of both franchises have been waiting for an interaction between Homer and Peter for more than a decade. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and Simpsons creator Matt Groening finally came together to give the fans what they wanted - to disappointing results.\n\nThe show no doubt had its highlights. The initial interaction between Apu, Homer, and the Griffin family in the Kwik-e-Mart after the Griffins had their car stolen at the outskirts of Springfield felt very fresh and new. Homer called the Griffins his “albino” friends, while earlier in the episode, Peter told his family that they shouldn’t drink the water because the people look like they have “hepatitis,” referring to the yellow skin of the Simpsons characters.\n\nThe complaint about both shows over the last couple of years is that they've lacked “freshness,” and because of that, they've both fallen by the wayside ratings-wise. When I heard about this episode being in the works last year, it gave me hope for both franchises. After the episode (despite record ratings), I was left disappointed and wanting more.\n\nThe monumental moment for me was when the Duff Beer Company, representing Springfield, sued Peter and his Pawtucket Patriot Ale beer for being a copycat of Homer's favorite brew. The kerfuffle began when Homer took Peter to Moe’s Tavern to enjoy a beer. Peter offers Homer a 6-pack of Pawtucket Patriot Ale. Homer responds by calling it a \"lousy ripoff\" that tastes \"exactly like Duff.\" Peter explains that it \"may taste like Duff, but it goes in a different direction.\" Peter assures Homer - in an obvious dig to longevity of The Simpsons franchise - that he \"used to love Duff\" when he was younger, but that he hasn't had it in \"13 years.\" Moe chimes in and rips off the Pawtucket label to reveal a bottle of Duff. Springfield's most prominent lawyer (the Blue-Haired Lawyer) appears and sues Peter and the Pawtucket Brewing Company for copyright infringement.\n\nThe courtroom scene was brilliant, with every Simpsons character matched up side-by-side with their equivalent characters from Family Guy; everyone from The Simpsons' James Woods finally meeting Family Guy's James Woods to Lenny and Cleveland sitting next to each other and forming a bond as their respective show's one and only black, er, \"funny\" characters. The kicker was that Fred Flintstone was the judge, and ruled both shows have been copying Bedrock since the '60s. (It was fortunate for Fred that The Honeymooners' Ralph Kramden didn't contribute his own comments on the origins of The Flintstones.)\n\nThe other moment that really had me howling was the climax of the show. Homer and Peter got into an epic brawl, similar to the Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken fights on Family Guy. One scene had Peter and Homer fighting in the Springfield nuclear power plant. Homer suddenly opens a cabinet to reveal the 31 Emmys The Simpsons have won; an obvious shot at MacFarlane's and Family Guy's failure to win even a single Emmy.\n\nWhile those moments were hilarious, everything else seemed to fall short of the mark. Brian (the Griffin's dog) was minimally used, because he was tasked with taking care of Simpson canine Santa’s Little Helper - and did so horribly. Marge and Lois were secondary characters with barely any airtime between them. Bart and Stewie took a liking to each other until Bart thought Stewie was too “hardcore” for him, which essentially shows the different sensibilities of the franchises. In one scene, Bart phones Moe’s Tavern to pull one of his innocent prank calls. Stewie follows with a very crass rape joke that raised controversy. This monumental episode was supposed to provide sizzle, but missing on key details like these made the show fizzle.\n\nLisa and Meg had their moment where Lisa helped Meg finally find something she’s good at: the saxophone, drawing initial anger from Lisa that mellowed into happiness. As we all know, Meg is the black sheep of the Griffin family. Lisa, on the other hand, is the know-it-all all-star from the Simpsons family. Lisa goes through a laundry list of things Meg should be \"good\" at, but ultimately fails to find anything. Finally, Lisa coaxes Meg to try her saxophone and Meg performs admirably. The birds outside chirp that \"she's better than Lisa.\" Lisa, always expecting to be the best at everything, gets mad, but as the episode comes to a close, she offers her saxophone to Meg who takes it - but her joy runs out as Peter throws it away almost immediately.\n\nEverything except the interactions between Homer and Peter seemed a bit rushed. It’s as if the writers gave deep thought to only the main storyline of the show, instead of developing the B and C plots to which we’ve become accustomed. Peter even proclaimed towards the end of the show that he was tired because he was only used to doing this for 30 minutes. An inside joke from the writers, maybe?"
