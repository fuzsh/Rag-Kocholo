        "text": "On this site, I try to post a diverse array of material, and here I thought I’d go for something a little bit different. Let me know if you like it, and whether I should do any more 1 V 1’s. So, without further ado, I give you your champions; Homer and Peter, from the Simpsons and Family Guy respectively. I’ll be comparing them over a variety of categories, before deciding once and for all which cartoon drunkard reigns supreme. Will it be Pawtucket Patriot Ale or Duff? Quahog or Springfield? Family Guy or the Simpsons?\n\nCATEGORY ONE: BEING ICONIC\n\nBoth the Simpsons and Family Guy have rich fan-bases, both encompassing different demographics. Whilst the Simpsons targets a wider age bracket, its counterpart attracts much older viewers. It is therefore much more likely that someone you walk up to on the street will have heard of Homer rather than Peter, due to the former’s show having a broader audience. In addition to this, Family Guy is said to have been deeply inspired by the Simpsons, so to that extent without Homer’s popularity, Peter Griffin would never have existed. The Simpsons, specifically Homer, has a greater impact on today’s pop culture. There have also been more episodes of the Simpsons, and it has won more awards as well, so therefore, HOMER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nCATEGORY TWO: CHARACTERISATION\n\nThis could be one of the more difficult categories to decide. Both Dan Castellaneta (Homer) and Seth Macfarlane (Peter) have unique voices and personalities, which rival each other nicely, so it is tricky to say whether one is better than the other. For this reason, I must draw on other sources for this round. Macfarlane not only voices Peter, but also Stewie and Brian, which shows an impressive vocal range, whereas Castellaneta only portrays Homer. Having said this, the latter has a voice better known in Pop Culture, and probably has the better range of the two actors, so the category is still wide open. Seeing as Macfarlane also created Family Guy, and writes his character himself too, I think PETER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nCATEGORY THREE: SURROUNDING ENSEMBLE\n\nBoth Quahog and Springfield have populations rich with imaginative characters and clever stereotypes, so this is another difficult category to decide. Both the families have unique elements to them, but one thing that the Family Guy cast has on its side is a strong relationship between Stewie and Brian, which is something that the Simpsons can’t match. Whilst the Simpsons might have more characters which established some of the moulds for those in Family Guy, the former only has bit part characters, who might have just a few cameos in a series, which limits the amount of character specific episodes that happen. This makes the characters funny, but ultimately a little devoid of depth. Family Guy on the other hand has less characters, but at the same time stronger ones too, and the ability to do more with the characters they have. I would also say that there is a more even distribution of jokes amidst the Family Guy ensemble, so in my opinion, PETER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nCATEGORY FOUR: EPISODES\n\nThis is quite a broad round, which I am judging on calibre and past pedigree. It has long been agreed that both series have passed their Golden eras, however strong viewership has kept them on the air. For the Simpsons, this is considered to be its first nine or ten seasons, with classic episodes such as ‘Homer the Heretic’, ‘The Last Temptation of Homer’, ‘Who Shot Mr Burns (Parts One and Two)’ and ‘Mr Plow’. The deterioration of episode quality for Family Guy has been less severe, with the classics featuring ‘Petarded’, ‘Road to the Multiverse’ and ‘Stewie Kills Lois’. Despite both fielding excellent episodes over the years, the Simpsons has had a more cultural impact on society, and many consider the Golden era to be some of the best television ever put out there. With this in mind, HOMER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nCATEGORY FIVE: PERSONALITY\n\nBoth Homer and Peter have similar character traits; both are selfish, spontaneous in their actions, stupid, reckless and blindly unaware of their respective insufficiencies. Peter likes the song ‘Bird is the Word’, movies and drinking, and dislikes the Godfather, and most prominently his daughter Meg. Homer Simpson on the other hand likes rock and roll, donuts, and of course drinking, and dislikes Flanders, and not having any TV or beer. Both have also had a variety of odd jobs, so what this comes down to is their capacity for self improvement. Homer always seems to learn a lesson at the end of each episode, and he genuinely loves Marge and wants to be a good husband to her. Peter and Lois are in a dysfunctional relationship, and there often isn’t an end lesson that Peter will learn in each episode, so for this reason, HOMER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nCATEGORY SIX: STUPIDITY LEVEL\n\nBoth Homer and Peter aren’t the sharpest tools in in the box, it has to be said. Peter’s subpar intelligence is put down to him being just under the line of retardation. He has thought that he’s Jesus, doesn’t know what to call people in wheelchairs and has put his…business in places he shouldn’t. Homer’s root causes of stupidity are thought to be the crayon lodged in his brain, as well as his heavy booze consumption and bearing the Simpson gene. He doesn’t catch onto things quickly, is usually oblivious and once sold his soul to the Devil for a donut. From the lists I’ve just given, Peter appears more stupid, but Homer wins this round because he chooses to keep that crayon wedged inside his brain.\n\nCATEGORY SEVEN: CATCHPHRASES\n\nHomer’s catchphrases consist mainly of noises; “D’oh!”, “AAARGH!”, “Stupid Flanders” and “Why you little..” being a memorable few. Peter’s are mainly things like, “oh crap”, “hehehehehehehehe” and “you bastard”. Despite those fun little catchphrases attributed to Griffin, I have to give this round to Homer for having more culturally impactful sayings and mannerisms. HOMER WINS THIS ROUND.\n\nFINAL RESULTS\n\nDespite being hilarious and a joy to watch, Peter Griffin loses out to Homer once more. Homer has come out of my comparison as being more iconic, and having better episodes, personality, catchphrases and being more stupid than his counterpart from Quahog. Even though Peter came out as having better characterisation and surrounding ensemble, Homer Simpsons firm grip on popular culture sees him top the Family Guy protagonist yet again."
