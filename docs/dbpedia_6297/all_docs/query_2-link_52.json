        "text": "WILLIAM BRANGHAM:\n\nThirty years ago today, viewers met what would become an iconic American family, the Simpsons.\n\nOn April 19, 1987, this strange-talking, yellow-skinned family of five made their TV debut, appearing initially on the sketch comedy series \"The Tracey Ullman Show.\"\n\nBut, soon, 20th Century Fox spun them off into their own 30-minute program. More than 600 episodes, and 32 Emmy Awards later, the Simpsons is now the longest-running scripted prime-time show in U.S. history.\n\nIn its early years, \"The Simpsons\" was criticized by cultural conservatives, who felt the show's subversive streak set a bad example for the nation.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\n\nBut, in time, the show's wit and biting satire made it a critical and commercial success. It's earned Fox billions of dollars.\n\nThe 616th episode of \"The Simpsons\" airs next Sunday night, and, according to its creators, there are no plans for stopping anytime soon.\n\nFrom Springfield, I'm William Brangham for the PBS NewsHour."
