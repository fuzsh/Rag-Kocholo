        "text": "Brother from the Same Planet Written by Jon Vitti Directed by Jeff Lynch\n\nTV Guide synopsis\n\nHomer's neglect sends Bart looking for a new father, and Homer responds in kind. Meanwhile, Lisa battles addiction to a 900 number for a ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' [sic] star. Voices: Phil Hartman, Tress MacNeille, Dan Castellaneta.\n\nTitle sequence\n\nBlackboard\n\n{The principal's toupee is not / a frisbee.} {The principal's tou} at cutoff.\n\nLisa's solo\n\nDescending eight notes.\n\nDriveway\n\nHomer says ``D'oh!'' when Lisa scoots past. Homer yells ``Waugh!'' when Marge closes in on him.\n\nCouch\n\nThe entire wall rotates as if taking the family into a secret room, leaving a perfectly normal couch in the room.\n\nQuotes and scene summary\n\nA soccer field. Nelson Mundt, attacker. Bart Simpson, goalie. A shot on goal. It hits Bart in the face. But Bart is pleased. ``I stopped it!'' ``And I hurt someone,'' adds Nelson. The soccer coach announces that the player selected to attend Pele's soccer and acting camp is none other than Nelson himself. Nelson is duly appreciative. ``Thanks, Dad!'' Bart can't join Milhouse, Richard, and Lewis on their quest to sneak into an R-rated movie (``Barton Fink'') because he told his Dad he'd wait for him. Bart waits, alone. Before leaving to visit her sisters with Lisa, Marge reminds Homer to pick up Bart. Homer answers, ``I'm on my way.'' Only after they leave do we discover that Homer was watching ``Wheel of Fortune''---and the state of the puzzle was ``I'm on my wa[]''. Storm clouds move in, and Bart sees a station wagon coming up the road. But it's not Homer, only an amazing simulation. The car splashes mud as it passes. When rain begins to fall, Bart seeks refuge under a tree, which is immediately struck by lightning. Bart sits in the road, drenched. Homer sits at home watching television. The wind lifts a nun into the air, and she flies away. (``This isn't funny!'') And curiously explodes when she lands. Bart tries sending a psychic message, ``Pick up Bart.'' In a trance, Milhouse writes ``Trab pu kcip'' on the wall and earns a scolding from his father. Homer watches a Green Bay football crowd bid a fond farewell to their star, Brian Bartlett Starr. Homer has the funny feeling he's forgetting something. The crowd chants, ``Bart! Bart!'' The banner ``We'll never forget you, Bart!'' is unfurled. Santa's Little Helper barks, ``Bart! Bart!'' And even little Maggie removes her pacifier and burps, ``Bart.'' To escape the noise, Homer takes a bath, still trying to remember what it is he's supposed to do, but all he can get is ``Pick a bar.'' Homer dozes off, and in his dream, he finds Bart's skeleton on the soccer field. Homer dashes naked out of the tub and out the front door. Homer finally arrives (dressed) to pick up Bart. ``Hey, boy! How was soccer practice?'' Bart climbs into the car and says nothing. Homer tries to buy Bart's forgiveness with a chocolate sundae, but the car hits a bump, sending the ice cream atop Bart's head. Homer tries to put the issue behind them, but Bart isn't buying. In his room, Bart watches Krusty as guest host of ``Tuesday Night Live''. His monologue is a massive flop. We got a great show for ya! Well, actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. -- Krusty the Clown hosts ``Tuesday Night Live'', ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Bart muses, ``I miss Joe Piscopo.'' Next comes an advertisement for a ``Bigger Brothers'' program, and Bart calls. ``My name is Bart Simpson, and I don't have a father.'' Meanwhile, ``Tuesday Night Live'' opens with a decidedly unfunny sketch. [End of Act One.] At the ``Bigger Brothers'' agency, Bart dons an accent and plays the r\\^ole of a brave young boy whose father left him six years ago. The administrator assigns to Bart a bigger brother she has been saving. At school, a dynamic young man Tom arrives at school on his motorcycle, gives Bart his own helmet, and takes Bart away, to the awe of Bart's classmates. ``Bart's dad has really put himself together!'' notes Martin. While Marge goes over the bills, Homer explains... Homer: Bart's not mad at me. Marge: He called you a bad father. Homer: Marge, when kids these days say `bad', they mean `good'. And to `shake your booty' means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate. -- So hot, it's cool, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Marge finds a $378.53 bill among the payables. Marge: Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill? Homer: Oh, it's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! [breaks down crying] It's not fair! It's not fair, I tells ya! -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' But the bill is a phone bill. Somebody's been making calls to the Corey hot-line. Lisa quickly hides in her room, the entrance to which is decorated by a Corey poster. Marge has a talking-to with Lisa. Marge: Why didn't you ask our permission, Lisa? Lisa: I did! [begin flashback. Homer watches television, Lisa stands in front.] Lisa: Dad, can I... Homer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. -- A wink is as good as a nod, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Marge understands Lisa's plight. She explains that when she was a girl, she had a crush on Bobby Sherman. Lisa laughs uproariously. Marge tells Lisa to stop making the calls, and Lisa carefully says, ``I promise you'll never be billed for another call.'' Lisa then continues to laugh at the thought of Bobby Sherman. At Springfield Stadium, it's Tomato Day. One free tomato with each paid admission. Bart tells Tom that his former father gambled away the family's savings on a single hand of blackjack. Dealer: Nineteen. Homer: Hit me. Dealer: [deals another card] Twenty. Homer: Hit me. Dealer: [deals another card] Twenty-one. Homer: Hit me. Dealer: [deals another card] Twenty-two. Homer: D'oh! -- Know when to say when, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' The start of the game is delayed for an announcement from a recruiter from the Springfield Communist Party. The attendees unleash their (not-yet rotten) tomatoes. ``Well, this is better than Dog Day.'' At Dr. Hibbert's office, while waiting for her ear-drops to sink in, Lisa is uncontrollably drawn to the wall telephone. She dials. Hi, you've reached the Corey hot-line. $4.95 a minute. Here are some words that rhyme with Corey: Gory. Story. Allegory. Montessori. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' After lifting weights with Tom, Bart settles down to watch some television. But it's not Itchy and Scratchy. It's Ren and Stimpy. Bart and Tom get a kick out of an absurdly disgusting scene. It's show-and-tell day. Bart: Someday, I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero Tom. He lent me this new weapon called a neuro-disruptor. [Bart aims it and fires it at Martin, who convulses and collapses. The other kids applaud politely.] Ms.K: He's not dead, is he, Bart? Bart: Naah, but I wouldn't give him any homework for a while. Ms.K: Very good, Bart. Thank you. Bart: Oh, don't thank me. Thank an unprecedented eight-year military build-up. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Martin is up next, but somehow his horsie doll fails to impress. Lisa pays Grampa a visit, who falls asleep in mid-sentence. Lisa spots Grampa's telephone and dials. Hi, this is Corey. Hope you and I can get married someday. -- Call 1-900-555-CORY, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Homer sits on the couch as Bart heads for the front door. Homer: Hey, boy. Where ya goin'? Bart: Father-son picnic. [leaves] Homer: Have a good time! ... Wait a minute... -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Principal Skinner leaves Lisa to inventory a storage room full of Glee Club peanut brittle while he sits down to slash forty percent out of the budget. Which he does by deleting entire classes at a time. He hears DTMF tones and immediately recognizes them as a 900 number. Skinner catches Lisa on the phone listening to Corey read the newspaper headlines. Tom takes Bart hang-gliding. Tom: Hey, look at the forest fire down there. Bart: [uninterested] Yeah, great. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Bart: You've been really great to me, but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more. Tom: Bart, I could kiss you. If the ``Bigger Brothers'' didn't make me sign a form promising I wouldn't. -- Living in the age of cooties, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Homer spots Tom and Bart circling overhead through a pair of binocs and realizes what Bart's been up to. When Bart returns, Homer does a Richard Burton on him. When Bart asks what he's going to do, he merely answers, ``You'll see.'' Homer pays a visit to the Bigger Brothers office. Administrator: And what are your reasons for wanting a Little Brother? Homer's brain: Don't say revenge! Don't say revenge! Homer's mouth: Uh, revenge? Homer's brain: That's it, I'm gettin' outta here. [footsteps, and a door slam] -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' The administrator ticks off ``revenge'' on the application and welcomes him to the agency. [End of Act Two.] The administrator gives Homer a list of boys who are in need of a Bigger Brother. Homer goes through the book like a catalog. (``Ugly. Wiener. Crater-face. Suey! Suey!'') Homer considers withdrawing his application but sees a young boy approach the desk in the next room. ``Do you have a Bigger Brother for me yet? ... Okay, I'll be back in an hour.'' Homer presses his face to the window. ``I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde?'' Marge has been called to school to talk to Lisa. Marge suggests that if Lisa can hold out until midnight without calling, she will have licked her addiction. Skinner advises Lisa to listen to her mother, commenting on his own relationship with his mother. Mother, that sailor suit doesn't fit any more! -- Principal Skinner gets weird again, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Marge and Lisa plot their escape. Homer pays a visit to the run-down part of town to pick up Pepe. Over ice cream, Homer tells stories of Bart. Homer: Son, I just want you to know I love you very much. Bart: [shoves a half grapefruit in Homer's face] Shut up! [end of flashback] Homer: Mmmmmm... grapefruit. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Homer shows Pepe a wonder of modern technology: The automatic garage door. But it doesn't open all the way. Homer offers to take Pepe home, but Pepe asks to see the stars. That evening, the two recline on the porch, admiring the stars. Pepe: Tell me more! I want to know <all> the constellations. Homer: Well, there's... Jerry the Cowboy. And that big dipper looking thing is Alan... the Cowboy. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Pepe: Oh, Papa Homer, you are so learn\\`ed. Homer: Heh heh heh. `Learn'd', son. It's pronounced `learn'd'. -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Pepe: I love you, Papa Homer. Homer: I love you, too, Pepsi. Pepe: Pepe. Homer: Pepe. -- The Pepe challenge, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Lisa sits in the green chair saying to herself, ``Gotta make it to midnight. Gotta make it to midnight.'' Maggie plays with a toy phone. The clock nears 7pm. Marge knits. Lisa develops a twitch and finally explodes, shouting at poor Maggie, ``Must you be forever dialing that phone!'' Lisa then quietly excuses herself. Lisa watches the clock in her room. It's only 11:24. Marge comes into Lisa's room, to find it empty. Downstairs in the kitchen, she finds Lisa asleep at the table, the phone in her hand. Marge quietly muses, ``Oh, Lisa. You tried your best.'' But when she picks up the receiver, Marge hears, ``At the sound of the tone, the time will be 12 midnight.'' Lisa wakes up. ``I made it!'' Homer and Pepe watch another absurdly violent Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. Bart fishes under his bed in search of his skateboard, to learn that Homer gave it to Pepe. You're not the <only> one who can abuse a non-profit organization! -- Homer, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Homer tries to recall the good ol' days. Homer: Remember when I used to push you on the swing? Bart: I was faking it. Homer: Gasp! Liar! Bart: Oh yeah? Remember this? ``Higher, Dad! Higher! Whee!'' -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' At Marine World (``No longer educational'') both Homer and Pepe and Tom and Bart attend ``Bigger Brothers Day''. Homer teases a dolphin with a fish, pulling it just out of reach. The dolphin steals Homer's hot dog instead. Homer attacks the dolphin, but is taken away by security. Bart and Homer spot each other, and Tom draws Bart away. ``You know better than to talk to strangers.'' Homer explains that he's Bart's father. Tom stops in his tracks. ``His father, the drunken gambler?'' Homer brightly answers, ``That's right. And who might you be?'' Tom answers with his fists. Homer throws starfish (a la a martial arts film), which Tom catches and carefully places in a nearby tank. A shark eats them. (``D'oh!'') The fight continues. This just in. A fistfight is in progress in downtown Springfield. Early reports indicate, and this is very preliminary, that one of the fighters is a giant lizard. [inset of Godzilla] [to off-camera aide] Do we have a source on this? ... Uh huh. A bunch of drunken frat boys. ... All right, I could use some names. I. P. Freeley. -- Kent Brockman's breaking news story, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' The fight continues through an antiques shop, into Springfield Gorge, back up again, and finally ends back on the streets of downtown Springfield. Homer is taken away in a stretcher. Tom and Pepe sit on the kerb and muse (painfully obviously) on their respective losses. Bart makes the obvious suggestion. (Where am I, the planet cornball?) Homer and Bart sit on the couch. Another beer, Dad? -- Bart, ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Bart: Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed ``I'm a hemophiliac'' and when he let you go, you kicked him in the back? Homer: Heh heh heh. Yeah. Bart: Could you teach me how to do that? -- ``Brother from the Same Planet'' Father-and-son bonding continues.

Facts notwithstanding, I maintain that it is ``When Harry Met Sally'' that, for better of worse, will be associated with the concept inthe mind of the general public.\n\nThe Flying Nun\n\nThis 60's sitcom starred Sally Field as a young nun working in a convent in Puerto Rico. Tropical breezes combined with her wing-like headdress led to constant airborne adventures. I am not making this up. And why did the Simpsons version of same explode? Because it was funny.\n\nBart Starr\n\nEthan Miller @{elm} explains that Bart Starr was the star quarterback for the Green Bay Packers who led the team to victory in the first two Super Bowls, as well as league championships before the Super Bowl was invented. He concludes that Homer was watching an NFL Films production about the star quarterback.\n\nOther references\n\nRobert Lopez @{rel} claims the grapegruit scene is a reference the Cagney film ``The Public Enemy''. Various attempts to reduce the fight scene to the level of a reference have been rejected.\n\nThe Stellar Career of Bobby Sherman\n\nranma@nsipo.nasa.gov (no name) was for some reason compellet to post the following list: [Source: \"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows\"] \"Shindig\" (Music) ABC-TV 1965-1966 [Semi-regular performer] *** \"The Music Scene\" (Music) ABC-TV 1969 [Performance] *** \"American Bandstand\" (Music) ABC-TV 1970 [Performance] *** \"Here Come The Brides\" (Comedy-Adventure) ABC-TV, 9/25/68 - 9/18/70 Comedy-adventure set in boomtown Seattle (pop. 152) in the 1870's. Logging camp operator Jason Bolt [Robert Brown] and his younger brothers Jeremy [Sherman] and Joshua [David Soul, \"Starsky and Hutch\"] were in danger of losing their timberland, at Bridal Veil Mtn., because their men were in near revolt -- over the lack of women in Seattle. Jason contrived an ingenious scheme. Using funds borrowed from rival saw-mill operator Aaron Stempel [Mark Lenard], he sailed back to New Bedford, Mass., and persuaded 100 prospective brides to return with him to the frontier. The girls, led by `straw boss' Candy Pruitt [Bridget Hanley], returned with Jason aboard Capt. Clancey's [Henry Beckman] decrepit ship, and Seattle was never the same again. There was a catch, however. If any of the 100 girls left before the year was up, Jason would forfeit his land to Stempel. It was quiet a year, but Jason won his wager. *** \"Getting Together\" (Situation Comedy) ABC-TV, 9/18/71 - 1/8/72 Recording star Bobby Sherman played a young songwriter struggling to make it in the popular music business in this youth-oriented comedy. Bobby had the melodies, and his tone-deaf, off-beat friend Lionel [Wes Stern] wrote the lyrics. Bobby's mod-rock was not without responsibilities, however, as he was legal guardian of his freckle-faced, 12-year-old sister Jennifer [Susan Neher]. The three of them .. lived in an antique ship .. while Bobby worked as a recording engineer, and the boys tried to peddle their songs. Rita [Pat Carroll] was their motherly landlady, and Rudy [Jack Burns] her policeman-boyfriend. [...] \"Getting Together\" was previewed on a March 1971 telecast of `The Partridge Family', in which the Partridges introduced Bobby and Lionel to each other. ---------- [Source: _American_Bandstand_ performance, 1970] Hey little woman, please make up your mind.

LED, yet the digits flip down.\n\nReviews\n\nOkay, this is getting silly. The references are gratuitous. The plots are absurd. Homer has become a caricature of himself. What happened to the days when plots were simple and Homer reflected our own weaknesses? After all, ``There's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.''
