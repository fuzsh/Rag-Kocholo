        "text": "By Michelle Landrum SNG News Service\n\nIf home life on ``The Simpsons,'' the primetime TV show featuring a family of googly-eyed cartoon characters, seems to mirror your own, don't feel so bad. Despite Bart's smart-alec remarks and Homer's yelling, ``The Simpsons'' portrays one of the most positive family images among primetime sitcoms, according to Mary Strom Larson, an assistant professor of communications at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb. Larson spent several months studying the sitcom family, which features Homer, a bumbling nuclear power plant worker; his wife, Marge, who wears a distinctive column of blue hair; Bart, the wisecracking son who immortalized the saying ``Eat my shorts!''; his precocious do-gooder sister, Lisa, and the silent, pacifier-sucking baby, Maggie. `` `The Simpsons', as a television family of he '9Os, exhibit primarily positive behavior toward each other,'' Larson wrote in her research findings. ``As models for social learning, these family members have much to commend them.'' For example, Larson found that nearly 80 percent of the comments from Bart and Lisa to their parents were positive, while 70 percent of the exchanges between Homer and Marge were positive. Exchanges between Bart and Lisa were 58 percent positive, she found. Larson is clearly a ``Simpsons'' afficionado. Her office, a small cubicle shared with another professor, is crammed with books, videotapes, a TV monitor and several Simpsons posters. She's quick to recall even the smallest details of the opening season's 12 episodes, all of which she painstakingly analyzed and boiled down to 1,670 verbal and non-verbal exchanges. Larson, who has also conducted research on ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Family Ties'' and ``Growing Pains,'' as well as research on the family image in 1950s programs, first became interested in the image of TV families when her two college-age daughters were in junior high. ``They were at each others' throats, and I thought, `It must just be that damn television,' '' she said with a laugh. So she decided to take an analytical look at how popular programs portray family life -- sibling relationships in particular. The results were alarming, she said. Even on ``The Cosby Show,'' which Larson said is often ``heralded as the best of the best,'' communication between siblings and family members is often more sarcastic than idyllic. On ``The Cosby Show,'' 64 percent of the sibling communication was positive, followed by ``Family Ties'' with 63 percent positive communication and ``Growing Pains'' at 43 percent. After conducting that research during the 1986-87 television series, Larson said she wanted to update her findings with some newer sitcoms last winter. She first began studying ``Married . . . With Children,'' but found it ``so objectionable I couldn't bear to analyze it,'' she said. While searching for a new program, she settled on ``The Simpsons'' and decided to find out if there was any basis for the critical reviews the program received in Time, Newsweek and The New York Times. ``In terms of communication and family roles, the criticism in the popular press hardly seems warranted,'' she wrote in her research. While the percentage of positive sibling communication on ``The Simpsons'' ranks slightly behind ``Cosby'' and ``Family Ties,'' the overall family image is quite positive, Larson found. For example, the Simpsons are active in their community, she said, recalling episodes where Marge crusades against violent cartoons and another episode where the family fights for a stoplight at a dangerous intersection. The family is also seen on vacations, in church and doing other family-related activities that aren't generally shown on the ``real-life'' sitcoms, Larson said. On ``Cosby'' and ``Family Ties,'' ``the families literally exist in the home'' to cut down on set-related expenses, she said. Both Marge and Homer take an active role in parenting on ``The Simpsons,'' whereas the fathers seem to dominate parenting on other sitcoms, Larson said. On ``The Cosby Show,'' which is typical of many sitcoms, ``Cliff Huxtable does the majority of the parenting,'' Larson said. And he also manages to run his medical practice while his wife is busy with her legal career. In general on sitcoms, ``The fathers are able to spend a vast amount of time in a relaxed way with their kids. It's like their job has never given them a problem,'' she said. ``And these mothers are able to juggle it all without batting an eyelash.'' Even though ``The Simpsons'' manages to avoid a lot of sitcom pitfalls, Larson acknowledges that there are some image problems with the program. The family ``doesn't deal with authority figures well. Where they really get in trouble is outside the family. Within the family, however, they're really sticking up for each other,'' she said. But even the problems that the Simpsons encounter are dealt with more realistically than in other sitcoms, she said. ``On `The Simpsons,' problems don't get solved in 22 minutes. . . . Bart continues to have trouble at school, Homer continues to have problems at work,'' she said. In contrast, Larson recalled an episode of ``The Cosby Show'' in which Theo was having problems at school and was summarily diagnosed as dyslexic. Immediately, his grades improved as if diagnosing his problem magically solved it, Larson said. ``The Simpsons'' also has a kind of cross-cultural appeal which Larson said is, in part, due to their color. The family characters are yellow -- not white, black, or any other identifiable nationality. ``There's this kind of ambiguity that makes them easy to adapt,'' she said. And, indeed, merchandise ranging from T-shirts to cigarette lighters features a black Bart Simpson with the character's customary flippant remarks. After finishing her research, Larson found she still had to convince people the sitcom is OK. She even had to talk one colleague into allowing her young son watch ``The Simpsons.'' ``I told her he was being culturally deprived,'' she said."
