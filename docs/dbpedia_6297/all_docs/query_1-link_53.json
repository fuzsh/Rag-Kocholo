        "text": "Aside from delivering some of the funniest, smartest TV the world has ever seen, The Simpsons also boasts 33 years of cromulent guest stars who truly embiggened the show.\n\nWe’re taking a look back on the eclectic musical guests who have rubbed elbows with the Simpson family, from singer-actor Ron Taylor voicing “Bleeding Gums” Murphy in season 1 to The Weeknd portraying Orion Hughes, the owner of the fictional skate brand Slipreme.\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up every musical guest to ever hit The Simpsons in chronological order. From legends (Johnny Cash, Paul McCartney, James Brown) to pop idols (Britney Spears, Justin Bieber) to artists you kinda-sorta can’t believe actually nabbed a slot on The Simpsons (the Baha Men guested TWICE?), the series’ guest roster is a mix of the timeless and the zeitgeist-y — much like the show itself.\n\nSpeaking of the show’s cultural impact, one of the bands to guest on The Simpsons — Fall Out Boy — actually took their name from an episode that aired 14 years before they appeared on the show.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nNote: We didn’t include guests who occasionally sing but are primarily known as actors (Mickey Rooney, Neil Patrick Harris) unless they sang on The Simpsons (Beverly D’Angelo, Anne Hathaway).\n\nSeason 1\n\nRon Taylor: “Moaning Lisa”\n\nSeason 2\n\nTony Bennett: “Dancin’ Homer”\n\nDaryl Coley: “Dancin’ Homer”\n\nRingo Starr: “Brush With Greatness”\n\nSeason 3\n\nMichael Jackson: “Stark Raving Dad”\n\nKipp Lennon: “Stark Raving Dad”\n\nAerosmith: “Flaming Moe’s”\n\nSting: “Radio Bart”\n\nTerry Cashman: “Homer at the Bat”\n\nBeverly D’Angelo: “Colonel Homer”\n\nSpinal Tap: “The Otto Show”\n\nSeason 4\n\nTom Jones: “Marge Gets a Job”\n\nLinda Ronstadt: “Mr. Plow”\n\nBarry White: “Whacking Day”\n\nDavid Crosby: “Marge In Chains”\n\nBarry White: “Krusty Gets Kancelled”\n\nBette Midler: “Krusty Gets Kancelled”\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers: “Krusty Gets Cancelled”\n\nSeason 5\n\nJames Taylor: “Deep Space Homer”\n\nDavid Crosby: “Homer’s Barbershop Quartet”\n\nThe Dapper Dans: “Homer’s Barbershop Quartet”\n\nGeorge Harrison: “Homer’s Barbershop Quartet”\n\nThe Ramones: “Rosebud”\n\nJames Brown: “Bart’s Inner Child”\n\nRobert Goulet: “$pringfield”\n\nSeason 6\n\nThe Tiger Lillies: “”Round Springfield”\n\nRon Taylor: “”Round Springfield”\n\nTito Puente: “Who Shot Mr. Burns?
