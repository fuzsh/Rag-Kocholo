        "text": "The Simpsons, an animated television series featuring the daily adventures of a nuclear family living in a fictional town called Springfield, is the longest running American sitcom to date since its debut in 1989. The Simpsons differ from other animated families such as “The Flinstones” and “The Jetsons” in that the entire show is a satire on American lifestyle. Erin Smith, Adrenne McLean, Dean Terry and Daniel Wickberg say in The Simpsons and American Culture that, “Although the success of The Simpsons is in large part due to the popularity of both The Flintstones and The Jetsons, it differs significantly from each: whereas the commentary of its predecessors was oblique and mild, the commentary of The Simpsons is overt and often scathing p.6”. It features multiple parodies that mirror real-life events and pokes fun at religion, capitalism and politics in their plot lines. This paper examines how The Simpsons’ character dialogues and story narratives repeatedly undermine America ideals by laying out examples from certain episodes.\n\nDiane Alters (2003) says in We Hardly Watch That Rude, Crude Show: Class and Taste in “The Simpsons”, edited by Carol Stabile and Mark Harrison, that the Simpsons are a traditional nuclear family. Homer is the breadwinner of the family and Marge is the housewife that is largely responsible for raising the three children (p. 167). This family template is associated with white middle classes in the 1950s and seen as “traditional” in American society as a whole (Stabile & Harrison, 2003, p. 168). Although the Simpsons’ appearance is portrayed as a “traditional” family, the series itself is far from it. Michael Teuth (2003) says in Back to the Drawing Board: The Family in Animated Television Comedy, edited by Stabile and Harrison that The Simpsons differ from shows like “Father Knows Best” (a comedy about a middle-class family), where the father laid down most of the family rules and refereed disputes (p. 136). He says the Children in that show were good natured, if sometimes confused, and always managed to learn that, indeed, “father knew best” even about their own childhood issues (p. 137). The Simpsons portray an almost opposite depiction from this “traditional” family, where Homer’s authority is repeatedly undermined by his children, especially Bart who is portrayed as the opposite of the “good natured” children of “Father Knows Best”. Bart is seen to enact multiple tricks on not only his father, but the people of Springfield in as well, such as prank-calling Moe’s Tavern on a daily basis. There are countless episodes where Homer is seen choking Bart’s neck with his bare hands out of frustration screaming “Why you little!” as a consequence to Bart’s foul play.\n\nThe Simpsons are able to incorporate an abundant display of child-abuse in their show because they can get away with it by portraying it as comedy due to its animated format. Teuth (2003) says animation increased the opportunity for much more physical comedy, rapid dialogue, and plot twists than live-action comedy could ever manage (p. 139). For example, Homer and Marge’s lovemaking under the bed sheets may offend viewers if presented in graphic realism, says Teuth, but by their very exaggeration in animation they become ludicrous and beyond offense (p. 142). Using this to their advantage, the Simpsons’ creators poke fun at multiple aspects of American ideologies.\n\nPaul Cantor, author of The Simpsons: Atomist Politics and the Nuclear Family, says television shows generally avoid the subject of religion because producers are afraid it may offend viewers and companies will pull out of sponsoring the show in fear of being boycotted by religious groups (p. 742). However, in The Simpsons, religious jokes are commonly delivered in character dialogues; religious acts like going to church are demonized, such as Homer saying “I’m not a bad guy! I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I’m going to hell?” in the episode “Homer the Heretic”. The episode “Loan a Lisa” has Marge saying “we’re visiting Grandpa” and Homer replies “No fair we just went to church”. Then Bart jumps in and says, “Yeah, so we’ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago about stuff that didn’t happen”. This represents going to church as an aggravating chore rather than a festive event, while also questioning the authenticity of religion as Bart describes testaments from the bible as “stories from thousands of years ago about stuff that didn’t happen”. Another episode where Christianity’s authenticity is questioned is “Milhouse Doesn’t Live Here”. Lisa tells Bart, “the mound builders worshipped turtles as well as badgers, snakes and other animals” and he responds, “thank God we’ve come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago”. By saying what Christianity is objectively (worshipping a dead carpenter), the creators have put it in the same level of inauthenticity as the mound builder’s religion because Bart finds it ludicrous.\n\nIn the article The Simpsons as a Critique of Consumer Culture, Sam Tingleff points out an episode where Bart asks what religion Homer is. He answers, “You know, the one with all the well meaningful rules that don’t work out in real life”. Bart replies, “Christianity?” and Homer responds “Yeah! That’s it” (Tingleff, 1998). In a way, they are undermining Christianity’s legitimacy with saying the “meaningful rules” (Ten Commandments) do not always act out adequately and may even sometimes lead to negative results in real life. The Simpsons get away with it because Homer is a cartoon character, often shown to have lower intellect than most people. Tingleff (1998) says that in ridiculing Homer, the television show is able to criticize dominant knowledge as hypocritical and self-centered. As mentioned earlier, by their very exaggeration in animation the words and actions of the characters become ludicrous and beyond offense (Teuth, 2003, p. 142).\n\nThe Simpsons also criticize America’s capitalist system. In the episode “The Crepes of Wrath”, Lisa has a conversation with an exchange student from Albania named Adil who says, “How can you defend a country where five percent of the people control 95 percent of the wealth?” Lisa responds with “I’m defending a country where people can think, act and worship any way they want”. Consequently, the two get into a childish argument with Adil saying “cannot!” and Lisa following with “Can too!” repeatedly over and over. The purpose of this episode is to encourage audiences to question the hierarchy in capitalist America.\n\nAs a very influential country, America’s global imperialism is also satired in The Simpsons when a Brazilian lifeguard says “excuse me Americans!” and Homer replies “Ah! How did you know?” As Homer turns around to face him, he is revealed to be wearing a t-shirt featuring Uncle Sam menacingly smiling over a globe with the captions “TRY AND STOP US”. This may be The Simpsons’ attempt at depicting America’s government as evil and greedy. To criticize America’s dominating influential power over other countries in culture and trade. Uncle Sam’s evil profile is similar to the character Mr. Burns, the richest man in town and Homer’s employer. Tingleff (1998) says Mr. Burns is the symbol of capitalism in The Simpsons, because he cares little for his employees, the town and the environment. Mr. Burns cares for nothing other than profiting from his nuclear power plant business, which is how The Simpsons portray capitalism, cold-hearted and ruthless (similar to the depiction of Uncle Sam on Homer’s shirt).\n\nCapitalism, and the monetary system in general, is portrayed as reprehensive in The Simpsons. In one episode, Homer quits his job working for Mr. Burns to follow his dream working at a bowling alley (Tingleff, 1998). This work is much more satisfying for him and Homer is much more “capable and qualified” in contrast to his previous job as security for the nuclear power plant. However, his wife Marge is pregnant with Maggie (the youngest of the three children) and due to financial demands, Homer must go back to the job he dreads. Tingleff (1998) says Homer’s unhappy status within the capitalist hierarchy is justified with his return. He has learned the lesson that familial responsibilities necessitate and justify unpleasant work. This criticizes the “American dream” where prosperity and success are within reach through hard work. In Homer’s case, he must sacrifice his own enjoyment to provide for his family; no matter how hard he works he must continue to have the loathsome dead-end security job.\n\nDuring the 1996 campaign, The Simpsons aired an episode, which featured two aliens invading Springfield by disguising themselves as Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. Homer reveals their true identities to everyone but the aliens respond by saying, “What can you do? It’s a two party system! You must vote for one of us!” The episode ends with all of humanity enslaved by the aliens and forced into slave labor. Homer says to Marge, “Don’t blame me, I voted for the other guy”. Tingleff (1998) says that this episode portrays the Democrats and Republicans as two sides of the same evil coin. “It is an explicit criticism of dominant American political parties and of the public for endorsing them” (Tingleff, 1998).\n\nAnother episode features Homer saying, “Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don’t have to think all the time. Just like that rainforest scare a few years back: our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it, didn’t they?” This phrase is a way for the creators to send audiences the message to question the amount of trust we give the government in how they manage the country, once again undermining America’s dominant principles. Do they really handle all the problems in an efficient and timely manner? In the episode “The Trouble with Trillions” Todd (the Simpsons’s neighbor) asks his father, “Daddy, what do taxes pay for?” and he replies “Oh, why everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine! And let’s not forget the folks who just don’t feel like working, God bless them!” Another episode where this issue is talked upon is when Apu (an immigrant grocery clerk), finally gets approval for American citizenship. Right after he is validated, he asks the clerk, “Now, which way to the welfare office?” with a big smile. Many people already know this occurs in the social system and The Simpsons display it through their characters in a comedic exaggeration to satire it.\n\nAlthough portrayed as a nuclear family, with Homer being the wager-earner and Marge the house wife, The Simpsons completely differ from traditional nuclear family shows like “Father Knows Best”, in that Homer’s authority is repeatedly undermined and Bart continuously rebels against society. Homer is often seen choking Bart on the television show, but this child abuse is rendered comical due to its animated format. It allows The Simpsons to poke fun at serious topics such as religion by questioning the legitimacy of Christianity without facing heavy prejudice in comparison to if the President said the same thing at a televised presidential debate. Issues on capitalism are humorously delivered through character dialogues and story narratives to subtly point out the flaws in the monetary system, such as five percent of the population controlling 95 percent of America’s wealth. Politics are also poked fun at with the two dominating parties being portrayed as evil aliens and Ned Flanders being shown to graciously accept unemployed individuals taking advantage of the social system. The Simpsons offer a satirical version of America in which the country’s problems are set on a platter and delivered comically through animated television. As more imitations of The Simpsons are being created such as Family Guy and Bob’s Burgers, perhaps they will develop into a completely separate genre not aligned with “traditional” cartoon families such as “The Flinstones” or “The Jetsons”.\n\nReferences\n\nCantor, P.
