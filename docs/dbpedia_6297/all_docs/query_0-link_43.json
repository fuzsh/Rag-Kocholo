        "text": "“C’mon people – this poetry isn’t gonna appreciate itself!” – Bart Simpson, of all people. Drugs – they do weird things.\n\nAirdate: October 3rd, 1999\n\nWritten By: George Meyer\n\nPlot: One of Bart’s stunts during a Fire Prevention event at Springfield Elementary results in the destruction of the gym. Having had enough, Skinner concluds that Bart has Attention Deficit Disorder, and makes his enrollment at the school conditional on a prescription of Focusyn – an experimental drug meant to combat ADD symptoms. While Bart does become much more focused, there’s also the odd side effects, such as a paranoia about satellites spying on him…\n\nReview:\n\nWell, episode 1 of Season 11 was a bust. Next time I want to watch a satire of Mel Gibson, I’ll just throw on that South Park episode where he turns into Daffy Duck and goes full blown Road Warrior because two kids dared criticize his movie. Not even the shifty-eyed dog could save that.\n\nThankfully, the season does improve with “Brothers Little Helper”. While flawed, I do think it does more to capture what The Simpsons can do at its best – analyze our society, in this case, mental disorders and how we diagnose/treat them, alongside the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nA lot has been made of how the United States is dealing with problems in the pharmaceutical field. While much has been made over the Opioid crisis (even getting mentioned by President Trump), some controversies have also been raised over medicines used to treat neurological or mental maladies, such as Attention Deficit Disorder. The question being raised is simple: how do we treat ADD (suspected or confirmed) and similar disorders while trying to stem a possible addiction – psychological or physical – to medications?\n\n“Brother’s Little Helper” is one of those episodes that tries to not only satirize the methods of diagnosing ADD, but also how much leverage the pharmaceutical industry can have over individuals and society. And what better vehicle to use here than Bart Simpson, the troublemaker to end all troublemakers?\n\nWell… here’s where I think this episode starts to lose it a little bit. But just a little.\n\nBart is a character that was marketed early on as the ultimate rebel – to the point where schools actually forbade shirts featuring him. And indeed, within him is a subversive, anti-authoritarian streak, an aspirant “petty thief” to put it one way. Yet, there are nuances to his character – a self-acknowledgement of his inability to pick up on educational structure and resulting self-deprecation (“Bart Gets An F”, “I’m dumb, dumb as a post”), moments of genuine kindness (“Separate Vocations”, for one), and the ability to comprise some intriguing plans (the abortive plan to kidnap Sir Oinksalot in “Homer Goes To College”). I mean, diagnosing him with ADD is not too far out of the realm of reality, and could be handled well.\n\nIt’s how they handle it that makes it feel a tad bit off.\n\nThis take on Bart is hyperactive to a fault, almost stereotypically ADD. It just doesn’t feel like the character that we’ve come to understand and recognize in earlier episodes. Honestly, it feels like too little faith is put into the audience, like we don’t recognize what an ADD child looks like. It’s something of a disservice to the character and the show’s ability to treat the audience like they have a high intellect.\n\nI mean, this is certainly not the most egregious example of character exaggeration at the cost of nuance, but still.\n\nStill, after destroying a fire safety day, Skinner has had it and officially marks Bart with ADD pills. Thus, we get to a bit of lost potential. I mean, it was a rather quick diagnosis after the incident and Skinner threatens to expel the kid. An argument could be made that Skinner was jumping to conclusions just to finally get Bart out of his hair, after years of the character being the class clown. Hey, remember “Lisa’s Sax”? How that took a look at nature vs. nurture and how it may have made Bart embrace his “class clown” aspect?\n\nBut the counter-argument – that Skinner finally did what no other authority figure could’ve done and found the root cause of Bart’s id – can also be supported by other episodes from the “golden era”, such as “Bart Gets an F” (“…uh, straighten up and fly right?” “Lucky guess!”). Hey, The Simpsons plays fast and loose with continuity, so both are rather valid.\n\nThus, Bart is placed on Focusyn, and becomes an incredibly focused and almost intellectual child. This little aspect does lessen the issues I have with the exaggeration of his hyperactivity – it does serve to showcase that he isn’t dumb, he just has an unchecked and abnormally short attention span. I do give some credit to the writers there. It also does, for a brief while, increase the efficiency at home, albeit not without some brashness on his part (“Memo to self: shut up, Lisa.”) Truly, the pills do work… at least, at first.\n\nAnd here’s where the show really starts to work in terms of satire. There are odd instances where, rather than conventional treatment of over-excitement (such as burning energy, etc.) and getting to the sheer over-stimulation of entertainment circa 1999 (did you see that video game Bart was playing?), we jump straight to dispensing mind-altering pharmaceuticals. Granted, there are people with AD(H)D that show a marked improvement on Ritalin, and I’m not going to deny that for a second. Still, it does seem like modern society has a tendency to overmedicate while at the same time dispensing of the rationale and the risk behind the dispensation of drugs.\n\nAlso, instead of being forthright with the issues our kids are facing, there are those that tend to trick them into just taking drugs without discussing the full consequences of such – understandable given that we are dealing with children (and it is a tad bit of Jerkass Homer trying to trick Bart into taking Focusyn at first), but still. There’s also the fact that these companies are giving drugs tested on rodents to children without long-term analysis of potential side-effects.\n\nAnd, oh boy, are there side effects! Once a hyperactive kid, Bart goes full blown Coast to Coast AM and becomes paranoid about MLB, tinfoil hat and all. Such is his psychosis that, as soon as the company tries to take him off the drug and put him on sister drugs (because of the almighty dollar in Pharma Nation), Bart downs a bunch of pills, runs off, steals a tank, and drives around town with it.\n\nYeah, the show went zany again. But, I will concede that I do prefer this quite a bit over the chase scene in “Blunderdome”. For one, there’s no love letter to Mel Gibson – automatic plus. More prudently, while taking a tank is certainly on the more over-the-top side for this show, there isn’t this sense that the writers are just showing off – that there is a method to the madness rather than just pointless filler. Here’s the thing with these “wacky” twists – besides requiring a heightened suspension of disbelief, they seem to up and come out of nowhere, with little foreshadowing and notice. I guess they’re trying to take us for a ride, but this seems like a promise to Disneyland turning into a trip to boot camp.\n\nHere’s the thing with these “wacky” twists – besides requiring a heightened suspension of disbelief, they seem to up and come out of nowhere, with little foreshadowing and notice. I guess they’re trying to take us for a ride, but this seems like a promise to Disneyland turning into a trip to boot camp.\n\nThankfully, this isn’t complete filler, as Bart shoots down a satellite being operated by the MLB to spy on the citizens, as not explained by Mark McGuire.\n\nOK, we’re in the Scully years. Stupider things have happened, like meeting Nessie. Stupider things will happen. Still… that happened. Could it have worked if Bart was just being overtly paranoid and shot down an innocent satellite simply carrying premium channels for no reason? Maybe. This could’ve been an even strike against the companies that prescribe these drugs indiscriminately and only care about their profits.\n\nLet me repeat – there are people who do well on Ritalin et al. I’m not going to deny that for a second. But lest you think these drug companies care about the consumer? I dunno. Sometimes they do. Most of the time, however…\n\nThen again, at least the third act was funnier than “Blunderdome”… mainly because there was little sucking up to the celebrity (McGuire barely tries to hide the information from the satellite, and distracts the town by knocking a few dingers. Far better than the slavish love for Mad Max himself.)\n\n“Brothers Little Helper” is a strange episode. It’s strangely more relavent nowadays than it was back in 1999, it serves as a fine satire regarding society’s treatment of ADD and other mental disorders, and actually does provide some level of emotional resonance between Bart and Marge. If the show had a stronger payoff and a more nuanced portrayal of Bart in the first act, the episode would truly be a Scully-era classic. As it stands, it’s a good episode with the potential to be a great episode.\n\nAt any rate, I’ll take it over Mel Gibson any day of the week.\n\nTidbits:\n\nThe use of the Volunteer Fire Department not only serves as a great callback to “Homer the Heretic”, but it does work to connect the first and third acts together.\n\nOn that note, though, this is the first episode to not feature Maggie Roswell as Maude Flanders – Roswell resigned before the season started. Instead, Maude is played by Marcia Mitzman Gaven. I guess she doesn’t do the worst job, but I just can’t shake the idea that Maude has a head cold. (And believe me, we’ll get to what happens to her character later this season. Makes a head cold preferable.)\n\n“I am feeling the urge to straighten up and fly right!” Ah, an interesting callback to “Bart Gets an F”, one of the best episodes of the criminally overlooked Season 2. And a rather subtle one, at that.\n\nNote to self – frame stores are sacred.\n\nAlso, this episode may have played a role in President Clinton holding a White House conference on mental health five months later. If anybody doubts the cultural impact this show had back then…\n\nWrap-Up:\n\nFavorite Scene: In the otherwise over-the-top climax, there is this exchange as Bart seems to point the tank at the school…\n\nSkinner: Good lord, he’s going to fire!\n\nJimbo: Alright! Scud the school, dude!\n\nKrabappel: (voice as flat as Florida) No, stop, think of the children.\n\nLeast Favorite Scene: Homer taking the Focusyn for the second time… and it taking up a whole ten seconds. Are we sure George Meyer didn’t watch an episode of Looney Tunes before writing this episode?\n\nZaniness Factor: 3. I refer to Bart taking a tank and shooting down a satellite with precise accuracy.\n\nJerkass Homer Meter: 2. An otherwise “average” Homer episode is impacted by the rather silly decision to have him take Focusyn. Twice. And act like a maniac afterwards."
