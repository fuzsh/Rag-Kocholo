        "text": "Brother From The Same Planet is the 14th episode of season four and the show’s 74th episode, first broadcasted on February 4, 1993 with a script by Jon Vitti and direction by Jeff Lynch.\n\nAfter leaving Bart alone at soccer practice, Homer’s inept parenting prompts Bart to get a “Bigger Brother” named Tom. Homer finds out about this and decides to get revenge by taking part in the “Bigger Brother” program and taking charge of a young boy names Pepi. Pepi and Homer begin to bond and Bart starts to regret taking advantage of the program. At an aquarium, Homer and Tom meet and begin to brawl and Homer is injured. Tom becomes Pepi’s new Bigger Brother and Bart bonds with Homer by asking him to share his knowledge of fighting. Meanwhile, Lisa becomes addicted to calling a 1-900 number featuring a pretty-boy celebrity named Corey.\n\nSome interesting tidbits about this episode include the fact that the writers wrote the role of Tom for actor Tom Cruise. However, when offered the part, Cruise repeatedly turned it down, so the producers used Phil Hartman instead.\n\nAlso, in the episode, there’s a bit where Bart & Tom are watching Ren & Stimpy and The producers contacted Nickelodeon to get authorization to use the two characters for that sequence. Nickelodeon was strict about what The Simpsons was allowed to do, and the producers were not allowed to have the savageness that they wanted. The Ren & Stimpy Show‘s animators offered to do the layouts of Ren and Stimpy for the episode.\n\nActually kind of funny when you consider that later on in another episode of the season, they take a hard jab at Ren & Stimpy but we’ll save that for when we get to The Front.\n\nAnyway, how does the episode hold up?\n\nWell, for the most part, the episode is very well-made, animation-wise and story-wise. You have a great story that works well because you like the new characters and you want to see Homer & Bart reconcile their differences but at the same time, you understand their dilemma. Bart hates how irresponsible Homer is and all Homer wants is to resolve his problems with his son.\n\nI also liked Lisa’s subplot because they do a good job playing it in a way that we can relate to it because we’ve all been in a similar situation like this at some point and the way it ends is nicely done.\n\nThe comedy in this is also great too, the fight scene with Homer & Tom is so over-the-top hilarious, it’s hard not to keep a straight face because of how crazy it gets…in fact, I think Family Guy actually took stuff from this for the Peter/Chicken fights. Seriously, watch that fight scene again and then go watch a Peter/Chicken fight and tell me they are not the same.\n\nBrother From The Same Planet is a good episode with a lot of great moments, two great stories to work with, and great animation to work with. It has a lot of good things going for it and it’s another great episode from the legendary fourth season of The Simpsons, a must watch indeed."
