        "text": "In comparison, both shows are great. Both shows have a dads that most of the time don't have a clue and wives that make excuses for their behaviors but still love them more than anything. Both shows also have 3 children involved and a pet. They both seem to be either middle or lower middle class families.\n\nThe contrast for the two shows would definately have to be the type of humor used on the shows. The Simpsons has more a an entire family appeal to it while Family Guy has a lot more adult humor that parents today don't want their kids to watch or be subjected to. I personally don't care that my kids watch either one of the shows because they know that they are just TV shows and that behavior on TV is not to be repeated in real life. Meaning, I teach my kids whats acceptable for them to do and say and what's not.\n\nIf I had to choose which show is funnier, I'd have to say Family Guy, but that is just my opinion. I just haven't seen The Simpsons in a while and Family Guy makes me laugh no matter how many times I watch each episode.\n\nOh wow such a hard question to ask. The Simpsons is the archetype for cartoon serial satire. It started it all. Which is evident in the Southpark episode the 'Simpsons did it' Plus Simpsons just had it's 20th season which is nuts. I find lately the Simpsons has transitioned more towards a Family Guy model, having more random pop ins then full on episodes like their earlier seasons. With 20 years of material they have covered almost everything already so staying fresh is hard. Family Guy is much more random, and hits a lot more obscure references to pop culture. The humor is more adult in Family Guy as well and it pushes the envelope more. The Simpson's daughter is intelligent, witty and misunderstood for her liberal views. While Meg from family guy is awkward, unappreciated and abused. Bart and Chris are very similar, while Bart has more intelligence he just prefers antics. Chris is blessed with a much slower mind set. While the wives both nag, Lois is the more active while Marge is usually more passive. Whichever you prefer these two tv watching, middle class, beer drinking, couple canoodling, antic driven cartoon families will be on for many more years to come.\n\nThe Simpsons isn't as offensive as family guy and also sticks to a plot (that is usually split into two halves). Family guy is known for its cut aways that have become more surreal as time has gone on. I think the Simpsons also sticks to a more traditional sitcom style narrative with set-ups and punchlines pushing the story on. Instead Family Guy draws out some parts intentionality for comic effect (e.g chicken fighting). The Simpsons will probably be more timeless than Family Guy just because it doesn't rely on so many references but this remains to be seen."
