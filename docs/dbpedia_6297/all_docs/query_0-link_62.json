        "text": "I remember being nine years of age and watching all kinds of TV shows. I didn’t quite understand them all, but I sat there and watched them because they entertained my older brother and parents. I specifically remember watching the show South Park. “Oh how dumb,” I would say to my self and I could not understand how adults could find these mean animated characters so funny. At some point it even bothered me and I did not find the show funny but rather insulting. I would also watch The Simpsons but oddly enough I only found some episodes interesting. Sometimes I didn’t understand the language and I wondered why my older brother was still into these cartoonish shows. It was not until I got older that I realized these shows were satirizing political, …show more content…\n\nIt does so by showing corrupt things in the episode that we often hear that happens in our world but that we do not always get to physically see and as a result we do not pay attention to or we do not believe in it. One example is when Mr. Burns tried to buy the safety inspectors. He does not literally try to buy them but he offers them a large amount of money in order for them to not report the violations of his company. Like I said these are often things we hear about but that we do not actually get to see happen. So, episodes on shows like The Simpsons show these issues of bribery with the intention of bringing realization and to bring attention of these issues to the public. Through this shows also show the effects of bribery. In this case the shows depicts it as a strategy that politicians or people in higher ranks like the power plant boss (Mr. Burns), uses to try to manipulate people and maintain authority. Another way this show satirizes an issue is through the use of humor. For example, as a candidate Mr. Burns uses the use of logic to appeal to his voters. Mr. Burns uses Darwin’s Theory as an explanation to the public, for why a fish found in the city lake has three eyes. He says that the reason why the fish has three eyes is because the fish is evolving and adapting. He says that the third eye offers an advantage to the fish and he uses Darwin’s theory of survival of the fittest, to …show more content…\n\nIt does so by exaggerating certain parts in the episode to show how easily influenced people can be. For example, when Mr. Burns is having dinner at the table with the family he starts to exaggerate when says all these good things that he is going to do if he becomes president. He previously asks the family to memorize questions to ask him so he can talk about his “great qualities,” and the great things that he can offer the people. It is obvious for the viewer that the candidate is lying, not only because they know his true intention behind it but also because the show exaggerates this part to keep the viewers attention focused. When the candidate Mr. Burns announces that he wants to lower taxes all of a sudden more people want to vote for him. This goes on to show how candidates easily deceive people because in reality they do not care about the candidate they just care about what he has to say. They like what he says and so the people of the town of Springfield believe him without questioning how. Also, the episode shows how Mr. Burns used common people to gain more votes. One specific example is his use of the Simpson family. Mr. Burns first chooses Homer to help support his campaign. He does not only choose him because he is a “common,” citizen but also because he knows that Homer is gullible. This shows how candidates will often target those people who don’t “question,” or are more likely to be"
