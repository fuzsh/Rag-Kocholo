O.J. Simpson was nearly a guest star on The Simpsons, showrunner Al Jean revealed Sunday.

The news was not random, as Fox will be airing the 2006 special, O.J. Simpson: The Last Confession, later on Sunday night.

“Ironically OJ simpson airs on fox 25 years to the day after the episode we asked him to be in (pre-murders) and he turned down,” Jean wrote on Twitter.

The episode in question, Jean said, was the fourth-season classic, “Last Exit to Springfield,” in which Homer becomes the head of the power plant union and Lisa gets braces.

“Fortunately he passed and we got Dr. Joyce [Brothers],” Jean added.

It is unclear what the gag would have been, but Brothers appeared as herself on the Kent Brockman-hosted news show Smartline, along with Homer and Mr. Burns.
