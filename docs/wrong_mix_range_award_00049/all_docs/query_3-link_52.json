        "meta_description": "Mentioning: 7 - Charles Thomson Rees Wilson was born on 14 February 1869 at the farmhouse of Crosshouse near Glencorse in the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh. He was the youngest of eight children by the two marriages of his father John Wilson, a very progressive sheep farmer, whose family had farmed in the neighbourhood for generations, and who himself had published papers in the\n            Journal of the Highland and Agricultural Society\n            on various experiments in farming. Charlesâ€™s mother, Annie Clark Harper, was a second cousin of her husband and came of a Glasgow family, who in the eighteenth century had been prosperous thread makers and muslin manufacturers, as well as burgesses of the city, but whose business had latterly declined. Some of the family attended Glasgow University. The Harpers had literary inclinations: George Harper, Professor of English Literature at Princeton and a distinguished author, was a second cousin of Charles.",

        "text": "[1] The publications, research notebooks and personal correspondence of C.T.R. Wilson are reviewed to understand his thinking on the idea of electron runaway in thunderclouds. The expansion cloud chamber, developed and refined over a period of nearly fifty years, is centrally important. Wilson's habit of research is characterized by a pattern of alternating between laboratory work with the cloud chamber and field observations of thunderclouds and the global electrical circuit. The evidence that the ionization tracks of electrons in the cloud chamber straightened with increasing energy was key to the idea of electron runaway, published in 1925. Despite numerous negative results by Wilson's colleagues Schonland, Halliday and others in searching for energetic particles in the vicinity of thunderclouds, Wilson supported the idea from its inception to his final publication in 1956. Wilson's notebooks indicate a conceptual awareness of runaway breakdown in thunderclouds 60 years in advance of contemporary theoretical publications. Definitive observational results on runaway breakdown in contemporary research were likely delayed for 60 years as a result of the unfortunate negative experimental results with inadequate equipment."
