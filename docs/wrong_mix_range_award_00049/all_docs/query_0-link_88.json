More than 70 per cent of all Nobel Prizes were given to discoveries. The majority of inventions were awarded at the beginning of the twentieth century and only three inventions had a direct application for society. The emphasis on discoveries moves the Nobel Prize further away from its original intention to reward the greatest contribution to society in the preceding year.\n\nDownload\n\nThe 250 years from the second half of the seventeenth century saw the birth of modern physics and its growth into one of the most successful of the sciences.The reader will find here the lives of fifty of the most remarkable physicists from that era described in brief biographies. All the characters profiled have made important contributions to physics, through their ideas, through their teaching, or in other ways.The emphasis is on their varied life-stories, not on the details of their achievements, but, when read in sequence, the biographies, which are organized chronologically, convey in human terms something of the way in which physics was created.Scientific and mathematical detail is kept to a minimum, so the reader who is interested in physics, but perhaps lacks the background to follow technical accounts, will find this collection an inviting and easy path through the subjectâ€™s modern development.\n\nDownload\n\nNotes and Records, 2020\n\nThe Nobel Prize has acted as a surrogate record of invention and discovery throughout the twentieth century. Based on this surrogacy, many claims are made regarding both trends in research and claims for places of research excellence. In this paper I propose that any analysis should be weighted by the 'prize share' made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to each recipient. In addition, I argue for a focus on the organization and period when the prize-winning research was carried out, rather than when the award was made and the often quoted 'affiliated organization at the time of award'. I use this to briefly examine types of invention and discovery for all Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to date (1901-2019). I then use this 'place' lens to briefly explore trends in invention and discovery in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics. I conclude by drawing attention to the difference between institutions claiming Nobel Laureates and institutions where Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and inventions have been made.\n\nDownload\n\nThe article is devoted to the significance of the study of Nobel laureates in Physics in the development of technology contribution by the students of technical institutions. The basic information about the Nobel laureates in the field of Technical physics is presented. There are traced the basic physical ideas that have established their use in various technical devices and technologies. Particular attention is paid to physical discoveries that determined the form of the late twentieth century technology, in such areas as spectroscopy, laser technology and electronics. The main achievements from the twentieth century and the beginning of the XXI century have also been regarded.\n\nDownload"
