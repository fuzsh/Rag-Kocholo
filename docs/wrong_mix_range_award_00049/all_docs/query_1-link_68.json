Ignore the rest.\n\nFor background, see Using the Subpages template Don't worry--you'll get the hang of it right away.\n\nRemember to hit Save!\n\nthe \"metadata template\".\n\nHowever, you can create articles without subpages. Just delete the {{subpages}} template from the top of this page and this prompt will disappear. :) Don't feel obligated to use subpages, it's more important that you write sentences, which you can always do without writing fancy code.\n\nB - For a Cluster Move use the following directions\n\nThe metadata template should be moved to the new name as the first step. Please revert this move and start by using the Move Cluster link at the top left of the talk page.\n\nThe name prior to this move can be found at the following link."
