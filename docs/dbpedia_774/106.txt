JOHN RICHARDSON

John Richardson is well known at an international level as the founding member of the rock band The Rubettes in the '70s. His solo musical career has led him to compose music in a soft, romantic New Age style, with which he intends to contribute to proposals of musicotherapy. He is very interested in natural medicine, and he manages a clinic of this kind in Great Britain.
