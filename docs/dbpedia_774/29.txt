John Richardson has fond memories of walking into Don Wilson Music in Kentucky and purchasing his first tenor saxophone. Mr. Wilson sold the instrument for less than it was worth in the hopes of encouraging young John, which of course it did. He never forgot Mr. Wilsonâ€™s kindness, who later became his boss and mentor when John was hired in 1994 to work behind the counter at the store. All the while John was submerged in music, providing private lessons and conducting the award winning All Star Youth Orchestra. John also worked for Miles Davis of Miles Davis Musical Instruments for six years before another six years as the Winds Brand Manager for KHS. The experiences deepened his passion for the business, which led to his current position at St. Louis Music as Director of Sales!
