In this role, Richardson will guide artist relations activity for all brands, while also assuming direct responsibility for U.S. based artists representing Jupiter Band Instruments, XO Brass, Altus Flutes, and Majestic Percussion. He will also manage the extensive KHS America Academic Alliance grant program in support of educational clinics and will take the lead on other educator outreach programs for the company.\n\n“I’m really excited to return to the KHS America family,” says Richardson. “It’s truly an honor to collaborate with such a talented team and an amazingly diverse and passionate group of artists. We are so fortunate to have such strong support from influential performers and educators across the range of our brands.”\n\nJohn was previously the Winds Brand Manager at KHS America from 2014 to 2019 and has an impressive history of music industry experience as a performing artist, educator, retailer, brand manager and most recently as National Sales Manager for St. Louis Music.\n\n“We’re incredibly excited to have John Richardson back home, in this important role to which he is so well suited,” states KHS America President, Jerry Goldenson. “His knowledge of our business, existing relationships with so many of our artists, deep understanding of music education, and first-hand experience as a performing artist himself are a perfect match to lead our outreach efforts into the future.”"
