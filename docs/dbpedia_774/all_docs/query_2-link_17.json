With its high uncertainty and limited control, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly asked a lot from all of us. One important central question is: how resilient have we proved in face of the unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus pandemic? There is a vast and rapidly growing literature that has examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health both on the shorter (2020) and longer (2021) term. This not only concerns pandemic-related effects on resilience in the general population, but also how the pandemic has challenged stress resilience and mental health outcomes across more specific vulnerable population groups: patients with a psychiatric disorder, COVID-19 diagnosed patients, health care workers, children and adolescents, pregnant women, and elderly people. It is challenging to keep up to date with, and interpret, this rapidly increasing scientific literature. In this review, we provide a critical overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health and how human stress resilience has been shaped by the pandemic on the shorter and longer term. The vast literature is dominated by a wealth of data which are, however, not always of the highest quality and heavily depend on online and self-report surveys. Nevertheless, it appears that we have proven surprisingly resilient over time, with fast recovery from COVID-19 measures. Still, vulnerable groups such as adolescents and health care personnel that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do exist. Large interindividual differences exist, and for future pandemics there is a clear need to comprehensively and integratively assess resilience from the start to provide personalized help and interventions tailored to the specific needs for vulnerable groups.\n\nKey messages\n\n•\n\nThe early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were often associated with increased levels of distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population.\n\n•\n\nA substantial group of individuals has been either largely unaffected or is even doing better during the pandemic.\n\n•\n\nLongitudinal follow up showed remarkable signs of resilience.\n\n•\n\nHealth care workers appear to be at an increased risk of stress-related psychological symptoms.\n\n•\n\nThe mental health of children, adolescents, and students has been particularly affected by the pandemic.\n\n•\n\nElderly people are more vulnerable to the physical effects of COVID-19, but also report lower psychopathology during the pandemic.\n\n•\n\nIndividuals with an existing psychiatric disorder are experiencing detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, but do not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their pre-pandemic levels.\n\n•\n\nA high risk exists for psychiatric sequelae following a COVID-19 infection.\n\n•\n\nMany methodological shortcomings occur in the current literature which is often cross-sectional and relies on self-report, and it is moreover hard to directly compare results across many of the studies.\n\n•\n\nThere is an urgent need for a personalized approach when it comes to identifying individuals at risk or resilient for the stressful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n•\n\nThe effects of stress and the resilience capacity are dependent on (neuro)biological, psychological, and environmental factors and also are heavily dependent on an individual's unique context.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn 2020 many of us had hoped that the COVID-19 pandemic would be over in 2021, and that normal life would have resumed. The situation is clearly different: the pandemic is still ongoing with novel and more contagious variants leading to increased infection rates across the globe, with consequently more stringent restrictions in social interactions and more lockdowns. By the spring of 2021, over 156 million confirmed cases and more than 3.2 million deaths of COVID-19 have been reported (https://covid19.who.int/), with health care systems worldwide being overburdened at certain times. As in 2020, summer was expected to be associated to a reduced impact of the pandemic. However, new variants of the virus emerged, such as the Delta variant and there is still concern for what will occur during fall and winter. The pandemic and the accompanying measures have led to changes in people's daily routines, limited social interactions, as well as formed tensions among families in lockdown together, and fear of getting ill and/or spreading the virus. At the same time, the prospect of mass vaccination efforts has given rise to hope. Undoubtedly, the pandemic has asked a lot from all of us given the high uncertainty and limited control over the situation. For mental health professionals, the key questions are: what are the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, and what have we learnt from this unprecedented and prolonged pandemic regarding resilience at the individual and societal level? During the first wave of the pandemic, our Thematic Working Group on Resilience from the European College for Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) wrote an overview of stress resilience during the early stages of the pandemic (Vinkers et al., 2020). Now, almost a year later, there has been a second wave and, in many countries, a third wave. Numerous studies have attempted to identify how the stressful pandemic has impacted mental health in the shorter and longer term across a wide range of populations. In fact, by April 2021, a staggering 120,000 publications on COVID-19 had appeared, with over 5,000 dealing with the impact of the pandemic on mental health and how stress resilience is shaped during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the pandemic is continuing, and there is the risk of future outbreaks, it is timely to consider its impact on mental health and factors that are linked to resilience against mental illness to guide the ongoing response to it. In view of this, we aim to provide a critical overview of how the pandemic has affected mental health in general, and how human stress resilience has shaped its impact on the shorter and longer term. Moreover, we aim to summarize whether there are specific effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress resilience across groups that may be more vulnerable (such as health care workers and adolescents), and what we can learn for possible future pandemics. In this selective review, we did not apply a systematic approach but rather used a targeted Medline search strategy related to COVID-19 topics complemented with a thorough search of references in key publications. A general premise should be made in the interpretation of the results of this review as several caveats impact on the interpretation of the evidence here summarized. First, most of the studies were conducted in the first wave of the pandemic, often with limited duration of follow-up, and are based on cross-sectional assessments and online surveys. Secondly, and possibly more importantly, the impact of the pandemic (as measured in terms of infections and death rates) as well as lockdown measures varied significantly from country to country. However, although these methodological limitations could reduce the robustness of the findings as well as their comparability among different countries, we believe this data synthesis might guide the reader in interpreting the impact of the pandemic on mental health and the modulating role of resilience.\n\n2. The general population\n\nThe pandemic has affected almost every individual directly or indirectly, either due to (or fear of) COVID-19 infection, or because of the effects of far-reaching measures and their economic and social impact. Consequently, the impact of the pandemic on mental health outcomes has been frequently examined in the general population. In a study conducted in April 2020, using a probability sample (N = 1468) and the Kessler-6 psychological distress scale (0–24 with 13 as a cutoff for serious distress), 13.6% of US adults reported symptoms of serious psychological distress, relative to 3.9% in 2018 (McGinty et al., 2020). In another study among 9565 individuals from 78 countries, during the height of the lockdown (April – June 2020), the pandemic was experienced as at least moderately stressful for most people, and 11% reported the highest levels of stress. Symptoms of depression were also high, including 25% of the sample indicating that the things they did were not reinforcing, 33% reporting high levels of boredom, and nearly 50% indicating they wasted a lot of time (Gloster et al., 2020). In a similar study which also used the Kessler-6 psychological distress scale (N = 2555), distress levels did not increase, with equal numbers of US adults experienced serious psychological distress in February 2019 (prior to the pandemic) as in May 2020 (Breslau et al., 2021). In the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS, N = 17,452), mental health was assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) before and during the pandemic (Pierce et al., 2020). In this study, the population prevalence of clinically significant levels of mental distress rose from 19% in 2018–19 to 27% in April 2020 (1 month into the UK lockdown). In a later report on the UKHLS, most individuals had either consistently good (39% of the participants) or consistently very good (38%) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic (Pierce et al., 2021). A recovering group (12%) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to pre-pandemic levels of mental health. The two remaining groups were characterized by poor mental health throughout the observation period, either with initial but sustained worsening in mental health (4%) or a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time (7%). Concerning major affective disorders, a nationally representative survey study of US adults (March – April 2020, N = 1,441) showed that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was more than three-fold higher during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic prevalence (2017 – 2018) (Ettman et al., 2020). Indeed, a recent quantitative data synthesis, conducted by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Resource center, has shown that the pandemic has impacted substantially on the risk of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, estimating an additional 53.2 million cases of major depressive disorder and an additional 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorders globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators, 2021; Santomauro et al., 2021). Further support for the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of affective disturbances comes from the large cohort study of Lob et al. (March – April 2020, N = 51,417), showing that severe depressive symptoms were developed by 11% of their sample equaling 5656 participants, while moderate symptoms were experienced by 29% of the subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic (Iob et al., 2020a). In Italy (N = 130), quarantine resulted in increased internalizing symptoms, particularly in those individuals with pre-existing psychopathology or experiencing negative economic consequences (Castellini et al., 2021). In another study conducted in the US (March – June 2020, N = 7138), both increases and decreases in distress during the pandemic, assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), could be explained by perceived infection risk and risk of death, perceived financial risks, lifestyle changes resulting from the virus, perceived discrimination, and changes in substance use and employment status (explained variation: 70% for the increase in distress between March and April 2020, and 46% for the decline in April and June 2020) (Robinson and Daly, 2020). Among Chinese students (N = 68,685), levels of stress decreased after remission of the first outbreak (end of March – beginning of April), even though anxiety symptoms (22 to 26%) and depressive symptoms (11 to 15%) still increased, particularly in those with limited physical exercise and perceived social support (Li et al., 2021b). This indicates that the pandemic may have longer-lasting negative effects on mental health outcomes that might take time to fully emerge. Finally, a survey performed in 1,310 Spanish adults during the first lock-down period (March 2020) showed that regression models containing a series of variables (i.e. being female, having a younger age, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time being exposed to news about COVID- 19, having more contact with relatives different to those that participants co-reside with) explained 48% and 33% of the variance of distress and loneliness respectively (Losada-Baltar et al., 2021). Although the methodological quality of studies was quite heterogeneous, with sometimes limited sample size, no longitudinal measures, and only sparse information about mental health status, adaptive responses after the first wave of the pandemic were frequently reported.\n\nIn contrast to studies showing increases in mental health problems in the general population, there is also convincing evidence that most individuals are sufficiently able to cope with the pandemic and its associated measures and even that increased resilience building in the general population may have occurred. In the Netherlands, for example, a longitudinal study among adults (N = 3,983) showed no apparent increase was found in anxiety and depression symptoms between March 2019 and March 2020 when the pandemic broke out (van der Velden et al., 2020). Moreover, in a Chinese general population study (N = 1738), which was conducted during the initial outbreak (end of January – beginning of February 2020) and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (Wang et al., 2020a). In Switzerland, a survey study (N = 10,472) documented increased stress in 50% of participants, but 24% showed no change and 26% even felt less stressed during the lockdown in April 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic period (https://osf.io/jqw6a/). More encouraging news stems from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study showing that, between March and August 2020, in over 36,500 adults, the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly as individuals adapted to the changing circumstances, even though the sample is not representative of the national population (Fancourt et al., 2021). In Spain (N = 3480), after the confinement was lifted, depressive symptoms rapidly decreased after an initial increase during the confinement, but no clear effects on anxiety were found (Gonzalez-Sanguino et al., 2020). In Germany, worrying and depressive symptoms among the general population (N = 2376) decreased on average between March and June 2020 (Bendau et al., 2020b). Another US sample (N = 7319) found increased psychological distress (PHQ-4) between March and April 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began, which subsequently declined to mid-March (baseline) levels by June 2020 (Daly and Robinson, 2020). In 1166 UK adults, a low-stable profile characterized by little-to-no psychological distress was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19-related PTSD (Shevlin et al., 2021). Assessment of loneliness in 1545 American adults in January, March, and April 2020 showed no significant changes in loneliness but rather increased perceived support from others (Luchetti et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion: In the general population, the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were often associated with increased levels of distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, the effects of the pandemic on mental health in the general population have been quite heterogeneous from the beginning, and a substantial group has been either largely unaffected or is even doing better during the pandemic period. More importantly, longitudinal follow up has shown signs of resilience in the general population, with surprising ability to bounce back and adapt.

Health care personnel\n\nHealth care personnel have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and exposed to more stressful circumstances than many other professional groups. This is due to several factors, including the increased infection risk, fear of infecting other people and being isolated from their families, working overtime, demanding work conditions with lengthy shifts, directly witnessing the suffering and death of patients, and witnessing the crowded and challenging situations in hospitals. Hence, it is not surprising that many studies on stress resilience and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic have specifically focused on health care personnel. A meta-analysis of COVID-19-related stress and psychiatric symptoms in nurses already identified 93 studies published between January to September 2020 (Al Maqbali et al., 2021). In this meta-analysis, over one third of over 90,000 nurses reported stress, sleep disturbances and increased mood and anxiety symptoms. This seems considerably higher than findings from studies in nurses working during smaller-scale pandemics like SARS or when compared to the general population at the same time period (Chen et al., 2005). A similar picture arises from other studies. A survey of dental academics across 28 countries (March – May 2020, N = 1862) indicated considerable psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with significantly increased worries and altered individual behavior (Ammar et al., 2020). Moreover, in a Spanish cohort of health care workers (April 2020, N = 1422) over half of the participants reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders, and nearly 50% reported symptoms of depression, with women and younger people showing an even higher risk (Luceno-Moreno et al., 2020). A study of medical staff in China (February – March 2020, N = 899) indicated a significantly increased prevalence of psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety and insomnia compared to the general population (Liang et al., 2020). A longitudinal study among Japanese adults (March 2020 and May 2020, N = 1015) showed that indices of fatigue, anxiety and depression increased among health care compared to non-health care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (Sasaki et al., 2020). In Portugal, a cross-sectional study (May 2020) showed that physicians working at the frontline of COVID-19 (N = 420) presented worse mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) than other physicians. Moreover, this study found that being female and working at the frontline are risk factors for increased stress, while having a garden at home was a protective factor for anxiety and stress symptoms (Ferreira et al., 2021). In Turkey, when 939 health care workers were assessed cross-sectionally in April-May 2020, more than 60% of the participants reported anxiety and depression symptoms (Sahin et al., 2020). These studies stress the need for successful intervention or prevention strategies for health care personnel. To avoid long-term effects of stress, strategies to counteract the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly in highly affected populations, may be helpful. For instance, in a group of Italian general practitioners (N = 102), Di Monte and colleagues found that the implementation of task-orientated project management seemed protective against symptoms of burnout during the pandemic (Di Monte et al., 2020). In another study, specific pandemic-related stress factors were identified in health care personnel, including workload burden and fear of infection (Mosheva et al., 2020). Heath and colleagues reviewed several strategies to increase resilience among health care workers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, also guided by the experiences of previous pandemics (Heath et al., 2020). They identified several interventions and approaches, ranging from individual strategies without professional help (e.g. increased self-care or mindfulness practice) to strategies implemented at the group or organizational level (e.g. competency / resilience training, availability of psychological first aid or implementation of effective leadership and organizational justice). Importantly, some of these intervention strategies, including computer-assisted resilience training, have already been developed and successfully tested (Aiello et al., 2011; Maunder et al., 2010; Weerkamp-Bartholomeus et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion: Overall, health care workers appear to be at an increased risk of stress-related psychological symptoms during a pandemic, compared to the general population. However, longitudinal studies are still largely lacking, and it remains to be seen whether the increase in symptoms is transient and can be considered a normal response to an abnormal temporally limited situation. For more solid conclusions, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies on the specific risk of health care personnel during and after a pandemic are needed. Such studies are already being planned (Roberts et al., 2020). This is particularly relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic has been present over a prolonged period and already spans several waves of infection. Importantly, specific prevention and intervention strategies at the individual as well as at the organizational level may be crucial, with studies already showing beneficial effects of these strategies. See for an overview of findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on the impact of COVID-19 on stress resilience and mental health in health care personnel.\n\nTable 2\n\nStudyPopulationTime period/ waveStudy type and sample sizeObjective(s)/Main outcomesInclusion criteriaMain findings/SummaryChen et al., 2005Taiwanese female nursesMid-May 2003,(at the peak of the SARS outbreak)Cross-sectional and case control, N = 128 (high risk group N = 65, mean age 27.2 years (± 3.6), conscripted group N = 21, mean age 26.1 years (± 2.9), control group N = 42, mean age 25.7 years (± 2.2))Symptoms of distress when working during the SARS crisisWorking as a nurse in the Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang hospital during mid May 200311% of the nurses surveyed had stress reaction syndrome.

Children and their parents\n\nDue to measures to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus, schools have been closed and the opportunity to interact with peers, play outdoors and exercise decreased (de Lannoy et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2020), whereas sleep and screen time have increased (Orgiles et al., 2020). Parental stress significantly increased after the school closures (Hiraoka and Tomoda, 2020). Parents experienced financial and health problems and needed to comply with home schooling in addition to their own responsibilities, which affected parental routines. Parents’ financial concerns increased verbal aggression, increased loneliness was associated with child neglect, whereas worries increased physical abuse of the children. In general, wellbeing of the parents significantly affected children's mental health (Carroll et al., 2020). A national survey from the US in June 2020 (N = 1011) reported worsening of mental health for 26.9% of the parents and 14.3% of the children, whereas the reported effect on physical health was smaller. Lost regular health care and delay in health care visits added to the worsening of children's mental health (Patrick et al., 2020). In Italy (April – May 2020, N = 463) (Cusinato et al., 2020) and in Spain (April 2020, N = 1049) (Romero et al., 2020), parental stress was associated with more conduct problems of their children. In Hong Kong (March 2020, N = 29,202 families), children with special education needs, chronic illnesses, mothers with mental illness, and children coming from single-parent and low income families were reported as more vulnerable to the increased stress levels as a result of the pandemic (Tso et al., 2020). In Brazil (April - May 2020, N = 289), parents reported anxiety in 19.4% of their children. In particular, children living with a person other than their parents reported higher anxiety levels, especially when a guardian had a lower age and lower educational level (Garcia de Avila et al., 2020). Having a house without an outdoor exit to a garden or terrace significantly predicted psychiatric symptomatology (Francisco et al., 2020). Overall, there are concerns that the risk of child maltreatment might be heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a range of stressors such as increased loneliness, reduced physical activity, economic stress, social distancing, homeschooling, marital conflicts and violence, and intensified child–parent relationships (Katz et al., 2020). In a recent study of 169 preschoolers, increased depressive and externalizing symptoms were observed compared to pre-COVID levels. A structured, predicable home environment adherent to family routines appears to mitigate these adverse effects (Glynn et al., 2021).\n\n4.2. Adolescents\n\nIn adolescents, determinants of resilience are less related to the parental situation and stressors associated with parental stress. A large-scale cross-sectional study from China (during the COVID-19 outbreak, N = 3613) revealed that among 3254 adolescents, anxiety and depressive symptoms were common during the COVID-19 pandemic (Duan et al., 2020), as assessed by the Chinese version of the Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS). In another cross-sectional study conducted in China (February – March 2020, N = 1784), following almost 30 days of confinement, depressive and anxiety symptoms were reported in around 23% of adolescents, with an association with less optimism about the pandemic and with being more worried about being infected with COVID-19 (Xie et al., 2020). A Swiss survey study (November 2020, during the second pandemic wave, N = 11,612) found that the youngest age group (14–24 years old, including students) were at higher risk for moderate-severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) compared to individuals over 24 years old, and that this age-dependent effect became more prominent over the course of the pandemic (https://osf.io/6cseh/). A cross-sectional study from China (March -April 2020, N = 7890) reported a prevalence of 21.7% for anxiety and 24.6% for depression symptoms (HADS subscale score >7) (Li et al., 2021a). Another study from China (March 2020, N = 8079) revealed that the prevalence of mild to severe depressive symptoms was 43.7% (assessed by the PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms were 37.4% (assessed by the GAD-7) (Zhou et al., 2020a). Being in senior high school (Zhou et al., 2020a), female gender (Zhou et al., 2020a) (Chen et al., 2020), lack of physical exercise (Chen et al., 2020), and less social support increased the risk for depressive and anxiety symptomatology (Qi et al., 2020). Furthermore, adverse childhood experiences, being exposed to COVID-19 and the presence of fear of exposure to COVID-19 were predictive of elevated levels of PTSD and anxiety in a Chinese cross-sectional cohort (February 2020, N = 6196) (Guo et al., 2020). Moreover, a longitudinal study among Australian adolescents (N = 248) showed that adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms and a decrease in life satisfaction during the epidemic compared to 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents negatively affected the mental health outcomes, whereas adherence to lockdown measures and feeling socially connected during lockdown were protective factors (Magson et al., 2020). In Indonesia, decreased parental support was associated with total mental health difficulties, whereas anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with higher pro-social problems (April –May 2020, N = 113) (Wiguna et al., 2020).\n\nThe previous findings seem to imply that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were unanimously negative regarding stress, coping and mental outcomes. However, the literature is more nuanced. A longitudinal study from the US (N = 322) reported significantly lower internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems in adolescents during the lockdown (April 2020) compared to January 2020 (prior to the spread of COVID-19 in the US), which was associated with better family functioning in youth that reported elevated mental health problems before the pandemic (Penner et al., 2020). Even though a decrease in physical activity and an increase in sleep and screen time were reported for adolescents in a Chinese cross-sectional study (May 2020, N = 10,082) (Yang et al., 2020a), an Italian study (April 2020, N = 306) showed that the great majority of the adolescents did not notice or only noticed very little changes in psychological well-being in the early phase of the pandemic (Pigaiani et al., 2020). In Belgium and Italy (April - May 2020, N = 825), 5% of the participants reported having increased mental health care needs during the pandemic and 44% reported stability in needs for mental health care, with another 52% of the assessed youth reported no need for mental health care either before or after the pandemic (Marchini et al., 2020). A study from Japan focusing on monthly suicide rates of people younger than 20 years old (January – May 2020, N = 138), found that suicide rates from March 2020 to May 2020 slightly decreased during the school closure time and were not significantly different from the previous two years (Isumi et al., 2020). In Canada (March 2020, N = 683), almost half of a study sample of adolescents reported that the pandemic also exerted positive effects, with more time to spend with family and more time for exercise and hobbies. In addition, suicidal thoughts were reported to be lower than 6%. The type of motivation for social distancing was found to be associated with psychiatric symptomatology: social distancing due to fear of personally getting sick or to avoid judgement was related to higher anxiety, whereas social distancing due to the preference of staying home was associated with less anxiety and depressive symptoms (Oosterhoff et al., 2020).\n\n4.3. College students\n\nAmong university students in Spain (March 2020, N = 2530), moderate to extremely severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21%, 34%, and 28% of the participants, respectively (Odriozola-Gonzalez et al., 2020). In a Chinese cross-sectional study (February – March 2020, N = 407), the incidence of concerns about somatic symptoms, assessed by a somatic self-rating scale among college students, was 35%, mainly related to concerns regarding COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020a). In Bangladesh (May 2020, N = 476), over 80% of students exhibited any form of (mild to severe) depressive and anxiety symptoms, also related to worrying about academic activities (Islam et al., 2020). In France (April – May 2020, N = 69,054), the prevalence of suicidal thoughts, severe depression, and high levels of anxiety were 11%, 16%, and 28%, respectively (Wathelet et al., 2020). In separate studies, female gender, social isolation, low quality of social relations were found as risk factors for lower mental health (Wathelet et al., 2020). In a US study (April 2020, N = 195), 71% of college students reported increased stress and anxiety, worry about their own and loved ones’ health, sleep disruptions, difficulty with concentration, and concerns about academic performance as pandemic-related stressors (Son et al., 2020). For Chinese college students, 25% of the students reported mild to moderate anxiety when cross-sectionally assessed during the pandemic (N = 7143), with living in urban areas, income stability, social support, and living with parents as protective factors against anxiety (Cao et al., 2020). Worry about the economic influences of the pandemic, the academic delays and the influence of the pandemic on daily life also contributed to students’ anxiety (Cao et al., 2020). In a Dutch study which ecologically followed students before and during the lockdown (March 2020, N = 78), mood homeostasis decreased significantly during lockdown, a finding that was in turn associated with lower mood and decreased engagement in activities that improved mood. Also, participants with previous mental illness showed a significantly higher decrease in mood homeostasis (Taquet et al., 2020). In Italy (March – April 2020, N = 934), students’ concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic increased PTSD symptoms, whereas positive thoughts about managing the epidemic showed the opposite effect (Nania et al., 2020). Another longitudinal study conducted in the US (N = 675) showed that a group of college students reported a slight improvement in internalizing symptoms, but worsening of externalizing symptoms and attention when assessed before (beginning of Spring semester 2020) and during the pandemic (end of Spring semester 2020) (Copeland et al., 2021). Around 70% of a sample of 950 US students (March 2020) reported that using a coping strategy such as staying connected, trying to relax, keeping busy, having a day-to-day routine, hobbies, doing school work and exercising, were protective factors during the pandemic (Waselewski et al., 2020). A cohort from the Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (N = 768) was assessed before the pandemic at the age of 20 and during the pandemic at the age of 22, and it was found that even though internalizing symptoms decreased, stress levels and anger increased during the pandemic. Moreover, only 30.5% reported feeling notably worse, whereas others were either feeling the same or better (Shanahan et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion: In general, the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health of children, adolescents, and students. Nevertheless, the effects vary widely within and across groups, and there are many methodological shortcomings in the current literature which is often cross-sectional and relies on self-report. Moreover, it is difficult to directly compare results across many of the studies. In children and younger adolescents, parental stress and decreased physical activity seem to be important risk factors for worse mental health, but for adolescents and students, COVID-19-and academic related worries, familial conflicts, loneliness, and not engaging in health behaviors seem to be important risk factors. Although children, adolescent, and students seem particularly vulnerable for the negative effects of the pandemic in general, there are also some studies finding signs of resilience, such as the use of effective coping strategies. Findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on the impact of COVID-19 on stress resilience and mental health in children, adolescents and college students are presented in .\n\nTable 3\n\nStudyPopulationTime period/ waveStudy type and sample sizeObjective(s)/Main outcomesInclusion criteriaMain findings/SummaryChildren and their parentsMoore et al., 2020Canadian children 5–17 years oldPrecise period unknown, but during the initial period of the COVID-19 crisisCross-sectional, N = 1472 (mean age of age group 5–11 years = 8.12 (±2.04), mean age of age group 12–17 years = 14.85 (±1.68), 52.6% female)The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on movement and play behaviours in children and youth (parent-reported)Being a volunteer participant of the Manu/Matchbox consumer online databaseThere was a significant decline in all physical activities in both children and youth.

The largest risk factor for emotional distress during COVID-19 was previous emotional distress.\n\n5. Elderly people\n\nElderly people have been more directly affected by the pandemic than younger age groups as the physical impact of COVID-19 is substantially higher in this population. In addition, even though elderly people have higher levels of comorbidities that need to be taken care of, the availability of physician appointments and medical care has also been negatively impacted by the lockdown periods (Spalletta et al., 2020). In general, elderly people have lower access to technology and social media, which can make it more difficult to compensate for lockdown-related changes and have adequate access to food, news, and social interaction (Martins Van Jaarsveld, 2020). They are more isolated from their families and social connections, leading to an increased risk of developing psychiatric symptoms and therefore impairing their cognitive performance and daily functioning (Yang et al., 2020b). Elderly people also have been subject to change in health behaviors. A Cross-sectional study on the psychological, social and health-related challenges in Spanish older adults during the first COVID-19 wave (March 2020, N = 528) showed that while a quarter of the elderly people could increase their intellectual activity during the first lockdown, more than 60% of them reported decreased physical activity (Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al., 2020). In Greece, 80% of the elderly reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression levels three weeks after a national lockdown (March 2020, N = 103) (Parlapani et al., 2020), and these effects were also apparent in elderly with dementia in Argentina after the first 8 weeks of quarantine (N = 119) (Cohen et al., 2020). A German study (March – May 2020, N = 15,308) showed that while generalized anxiety significantly decreased with age, COVID-19 related fear significantly increased in elderly participants (Schweda et al., 2021), even though this was not found in other studies.\n\nIn contrast, despite all the challenges that the elderly population faces, lower rates of psychiatric symptoms in this population compared to younger age groups were reported. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, older individuals showed higher life satisfaction and quality of life and lower levels of trait anxiety compared to younger age groups (March – April 2020, N = 494) (Bidzan-Bluma et al., 2020). A cross-sectional study in the US (March – April 2020, N = 833) showed that subjects of 60–70 years of age reported higher stress levels compared to older people (>71 years) (Emerson, 2020). Another US survey study with elderly (March 2020, N = 825) revealed that less than 15% of the participants reported pandemic-related stress from confinement/restrictions, isolation, loneliness and concern for others and the unknown future. In particular, stress from concern for others and the unknown future was associated with poorer psychological well-being (Whitehead and Torossian, 2021). In Spain (March - April 2020, N = 1639) (Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2020) and the UK (April - May 2020, N = 15,530) (Li and Wang, 2020), elderly people reported less psychopathology compared to younger people. Also, when compared to younger age groups, lower COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) scores (Brazil, March 2020, N = 638) (Zhang et al., 2021), lower rates of suicidal ideation (Greece, April - May 2020, N = 5116) (Papadopoulou et al., 2021), and lower rates of depression, anxiety and stress (Northern Spain, March - April 2020, N = 1933), were reported in the elderly (Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al., 2020). These findings might indicate that at least a sub-population of the elderly is remarkable resilient, potentially due to their complex experiences during their previous lives. The discrepancy of the findings in elderly people might heavily depend on the geographical location, timing of the measurements, and the nature of the assessed sample.\n\n5.1. Elderly with cognitive symptoms and dementia\n\nElderly with cognitive symptoms may be more prone to the mental effects of the pandemic. In Italy (April – May 2020, N = 126), daily physical activity and adherence to a healthy diet were found to be decreased in this population. However, less than 20% of the participants reported depression and anxiety, which was related to living alone, having less social interaction and reduction in leisure activities (Di Santo et al., 2020). Based on a review on patients with a dementia diagnosis (summarizing 20 studies from March 2020 and June 2020), anxiety, apathy, and agitation were the most reported neuropsychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, probably due to decreased social interaction (Simonetti et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion: Recent evidence points out that even though elderly people are more vulnerable to the physical effects of COVID-19, they also report lower psychopathology during the pandemic period compared to younger age groups. In the elderly population, patients with cognitive decline may be more vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic. However, there is quite some heterogeneity within groups, and a significant proportion of the elderly people may still be at risk for worse mental health outcomes. presents findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on the impact of COVID-19 on stress resilience and mental health in elderly people.\n\nTable 4\n\nStudyPopulationTime period/ WaveStudy type and sample sizeObjective(s)/Main outcomesInclusion criteriaMain findings/ summarySpalletta et al., 2020Italian patients with mild and major neurocognitive disorders (NCD)January - April 2020 (precise period unknown)Cross-sectional, N = 251 canceled scheduled appointmentsNumber of canceled appointments for patients with NCD due to COVID-19 compared to these numbers in January – April 2019Having recorded the number of appointments that were canceled at the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS due to the government-enforced reduction of non-urgent healthcare services in Italy during the lockdown251 scheduled appointments were canceled (follow-up appointments N = 211; first-time appointments N = 40).
