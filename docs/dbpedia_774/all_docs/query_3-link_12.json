        "text": "English comedian\n\nFor other people named Jon Richardson, see Jon Richardson (disambiguation).\n\nJon Joel Richardson (born 1982/1983) is an English comedian. He is known for his appearances on 8 Out of 10 Cats and 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and his work as co-host with Russell Howard on BBC Radio 6 Music. He presented Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, and also features with his wife Lucy Beaumont in the TV show Meet the Richardsons.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nRichardson was born and raised in Lancaster and attended Ryelands Primary School and Lancaster Royal Grammar School.[2] He left the University of Bristol after taking Hispanic Studies for a year and a half, and subsequently spent some time working as a chef.[3] He then decided to pursue a career in comedy, and lived with fellow comedians Russell Howard, Mark Olver and John Robins for a year in Bristol.[4]\n\nRichardson entered and won his heat of the BBC New Talent Comedy Search in May 2003. He also reached the semi-finals of the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year competition in 2004.[5] Quickly developing throughout 2004, he was one of six acts to reach the final of the J2O Last Laugh Comedy Search. He marked the end of his first year in comedy with a performance at the Criterion Theatre in London's West End. Judges Jasper Carrott and Dave Spikey were both \"extremely impressed\" with Richardson's performance.\n\nIn 2006, Richardson appeared in The Comedy Zone at the Edinburgh Festival. He also completed a 60-date British and Irish tour with Alan Carr, and made an appearance on Paramount's The Comedy Store. In 2007, Spatula Pad (Richardson's first solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe) earned him a Best Newcomer nomination at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards.[6] Richardson won the 2008 Chortle Award for Best Breakthrough Act,[7] and performed Dogmatic (his second solo show) at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He later took this show around the country in his first solo tour. He appeared as a team captain in Simon Mayo's 2008 series Act Your Age on BBC Radio 4.\n\nRichardson co-hosted a Sunday morning radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music with fellow comedian and friend Russell Howard, and after Howard left, he continued to present the show himself until 7 March 2010.\n\nIn early 2009, Richardson's show This Guy at Night was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards main prize.[8] That year, he appeared on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks. He also appeared on Have I Got News for You in December 2009 and October 2010, and was a guest on David Mitchell's The Bubble.\n\nRichardson appeared on the BBC Radio 5 Live show Fighting Talk in February 2010. He was curator of The Museum of Curiosity for its third series. On 21 March 2010, he presented a BBC Three programme about compulsions and strange habits, entitled Different Like Me. Richardson has performed at comedy festivals in Leeds, Guildford, and Bristol, and has headlined university gigs for Off the Kerb and Avalon. He has also compèred in the French Alps, headlined in Barcelona, and performed a one-man show in Greece. In 2010 he also performed at the Melbourne Comedy Festival.[3]\n\nStarting with the 11th series of Channel 4's panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats, Richardson took over from Jason Manford as a team captain. Filming for the series began in June 2011. It's Not Me, It's You!, Richardson's first book, was published during the same month. Later in 2011, he became a regular comic on the Channel 4 show Stand Up for the Week, which was hosted by Kevin Bridges during its second series. Upon Bridges's departure, Richardson took over as host, a role he left after series 4 in 2012. Since January 2012, he has also been a regular on Channel 4's 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.\n\nRichardson presented a 2012 documentary entitled A Little Bit OCD, in which he studied the lives of people diagnosed with OCD and worried that he might have the same condition; he was indeed revealed to exhibit symptoms of OCD, but did not show signs of the accompanying dysfunction. The show won the 2013 Mind Award in the documentary category.[9]\n\nOn 19 November 2012, Richardson released his first stand up DVD, Funny Magnet. The performance was recorded at the Apollo Theatre in Hammersmith on 9 September 2012. The DVD also features Richardson's set from Live at the Apollo and audio commentary with his then-housemate, comedian Matt Forde.\n\nIn December 2012, Channel 4 broadcast The Real Man's Road Trip: Sean & Jon Go West,[10] a two-part series in which Richardson and his 8 Out of 10 Cats colleague Sean Lock travelled to Louisiana to experience the local culture and lifestyle. The show was filmed in September 2012.\n\nRichardson began Work in Progress shows in late 2013, and in 2014 took his new show Nidiot on the road culminating in a DVD of the same name.[11] In August 2013 he headlined the comedy stage at the V Festival.\n\nAppearing on Radio 5's Fighting Talk on 11 January 2014, Richardson said his worst ever gig was a couple of months previously at Doncaster Dome. He claimed the initial smattering of applause quickly reduced through his time on stage.[12]\n\nRichardson has presented two series of the Dave panel show Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, in which he and his guests discuss their worries.\n\nIn 2020, Richardson appeared in the mockumentary sitcom Meet the Richardsons for UKTV's Dave and presented Channel Hopping With Jon Richardson on Comedy Central. The former is a documentary-style sitcom written by Richardson's wife Lucy Beaumont with Tim Reid, in which Lucy has to deal with an exaggerated version of Richardson's character,[13] whilst the latter is a weird TV clips show in the style of Clive James on Television, but with Richardson presenting and two other guests discussing the clips each week.[14][15][16][17][18] In 2020 Richardson also launched the podcast Jon Richardson and the Futurenauts with co-hosts Mark Stevenson and Ed Gillespie to discuss systemic societal problems and their solutions. The podcast has received overwhelming positive reviews.[19] The Arts Desk remarked \"without making light of [the subject matter], Richardson and Co find the funny.\"[20] Since 2020, Richardson has also co-hosted the Down the Dog podcast with Matt Forde.[21]\n\nIn January 2023, Richardson and Beaumont launched Jon & Lucy's Odd Couples - a panel show featuring celebrity couples answering questions about their private lives and performing various tasks to test their relationships. The show was first announced in 2022 with an order of 6 hour-long episodes.[22][23]\n\nIn June 2023, Richardson was made an honorary member of Sheffield F.C. after he visited the club to film for Meet the Richardsons, along with Adrian Chiles and Matt Forde.[24]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRichardson lived in Swindon for seven years,[25] then in Surbiton, London, with fellow comedians Matt Forde and Danny Buckler. He also lived with comedians John Robins and Russell Howard.[4] In a 2012 interview with Woman magazine, he mentioned he had bought a house in the Lake District for his mother.[26] He is a vegan[27] and supporter of Leeds United. In July 2019 Richardson mentioned on Saturday Kitchen that he had moved across to Calder Valley, West Yorkshire, from Lancashire.[28]\n\nHe married comedian Lucy Beaumont in April 2015; the pair were introduced by the mutual friend and comedian Roisin Conaty and dated for about two years prior to marriage. They have a daughter born in September 2016.[29][30] Richardson and Beaumont announced their separation in April 2024.[31][32]\n\nRichardson has explored whether he has OCD, concluding that he instead has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder;[33] this was the subject of his Edinburgh Festival Fringe show Spatula Pad.[34][35] In 2018, Richardson told Radio Times that he had been to counselling for six months, calling it \"an immensely positive step\". Saying \"I wish I'd done it sooner\", Richardson said \"acknowledging there's a problem is the best thing\" and recommended counselling to \"anyone who's even mildly upset about anything\".[36]\n\nRichardson participated in a political advert for the Labour Party in the run up to the 2024 general election in the UK.[37][38]\n\nStand-up shows\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Notes 2008–09 Dogmatic 2009–10 This Guy at Night Nominated – Edinburgh Comedy Award[39] 2010–11 Don't Happy, Be Worry 2011–12 Funny Magnet 2014 Nidiot 2017–18 Old Man 2020–24 The Knitwit\n\nDVD releases\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Released Notes Funny Magnet 19 November 2012 Live at London's Apollo Theatre Jon Richardson Live: Nidiot 1 December 2014 Live at London's Hammersmith Apollo Old Man (Live)[40] 19 November 2018 Live at Blackpool's Grand Theatre\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision and radio\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Notes Unknown After Hours Documentary 2005 The Henry Kelly Show Live at the Comedy Store Steve Lamacq's Roundtable BBC 6 Music Most Annoying Pop Moments: We Hate to Love Comedy Shuffle Appeared in three sketches entitled 'Fearing the Worst' 4 Stands Up Out to Lunch It's Debatable Never Write Off the Germans 2006–2008 The Russell Howard Show BBC 6 Music[41] 2007 28 Acts in 28 Minutes BBC Radio 4 2008–2010 The Jon Richardson Show 2009 Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow Walk on the Wild Side Voice only[42] 2009–2010 Never Mind the Buzzcocks 2009–2011 Have I Got News for You 2010 The Bubble Spicks and Specks Grouchy Young Men Different Like Me The Vote Now Show Richard Bacon's Beer & Pizza Club The Museum of Curiosity Act Your Age Team captain 8 Out of 10 Cats Guest 2010–2011 Fighting Talk 2011 Stand Up for the Week The Graham Norton Show 2011–2015 8 Out of 10 Cats Team captain 2012–present 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown Team captain 2012 Comedy World Cup A Little Bit OCD The Real Man's Road Trip: Sean & Jon Go West 2013 Room 101 Guest 2013–2018 Would I Lie to You?
