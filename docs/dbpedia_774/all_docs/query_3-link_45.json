        "text": "The art historian John Richardson, who has died aged 95, was the author of a magisterial biography of Pablo Picasso, the first volume of which was published in 1991 and won the Whitbread book of the year award, and which is still in progress.\n\nThe first part of A Life of Picasso, The Prodigy, concluded with the climactic year of 1906, when the shock to Picasso’s system of the primitive reductions of form in Matisse’s woodcuts and his magnificent canvas Le Bonheur de Vivre induced the self-knowledge that, compared to Matisse, he had been merely cruising in his blue and rose periods. The second volume, The Cubist Rebel, published in 1996, took the story a mere 10 years further, from the breakthrough painting Les Demoiselles d’Avignon through a collaboration with Georges Braque to the brink of Picasso’s neoclassical years.\n\nThe third, The Triumphant Years, 1917-1932, which had to wait until 2007 for publication, covered the years of the Diaghilev ballet, Picasso’s marriage in 1918 to one of its dancers, Olga Khokhlova, and the affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter which began in 1927 and inspired new depths of eroticism in his art.\n\nThis left fully 41 years to cover in the fourth volume, originally due for publication in 2014 but still awaited, through the affair with Dora Maar, the painting of Guernica and Picasso’s death in 1973 after a fecund late period. Interviewed by Alain Elkann in 2016, Richardson stated that he had reached 1939 and hoped to “go through the war”.\n\nAt the opening of a Picasso show, Minotaurs and Matadors, that he curated at the Gagosian Gallery in London the following year, he said that he had received “a mass” of new papers: “It is a bit of a nightmare but I do my best to cope with it.”\n\nAt least part of the reason for the gap of many years between volumes was because the fees to the Picasso estate for reproductions of his work were so high that Richardson was forced into writing volumes of memoirs to raise money.\n\nThe Sorcerer’s Apprentice (1999) was an account of life with the art critic Douglas Cooper, his former lover, who had introduced Richardson to the avant garde in the south of France after the second world war, from Picasso to Braque and Fernand Léger, and to the idle rich.\n\nAlmost the nicest thing Richardson could find to say about Cooper, a notoriously prickly man whose main distinction lay in his ownership of the biggest and finest collection of cubism in private hands, was that in London he was “a very large toad in a relatively small pool”.\n\nA second volume, Sacred Monsters, Sacred Masters (2001), added the lowdown on artists and their hangers-on, in Britain and the US. Both books showed Richardson to be a practised, not to say bitchy, gossip, though the edginess was mixed with passages of insight into the creation of art. In his biography of Picasso this insight deepens into an unmatchable account of the life and work of a genius who will surely be considered among the two or three greatest artists of the 20th century, probably the greatest.\n\nBefore Richardson, there had been various kinds of Picasso biography, none wholly satisfactory: edgy memoirs by his former partners Fernande Olivier and Françoise Gilot; informative but semi-hagiographic studies, such as a life by Picasso’s friend Roland Penrose; the critical 1988 account by Arianna Huffington, Picasso: Creator and Destroyer, with a feminist agenda based partly on a reading of Life With Picasso, the memoir by Gilot.\n\nRichardson brought to his task a full measure of objectivity, massive research, many discussions with Picasso, the memories of Maar and Gilot, with both of whom he nursed long friendships, and, especially, interviews with the artist’s second wife, Jacqueline Roque, who divulged everything she could remember of her life with Picasso and opened to him all the documents in her care.\n\nRichardson was born in London. His father, Sir Wodehouse Richardson, had been one of a group of military subalterns who in 1871 founded a co-op to buy better provisions for the officers’ mess. This co-op became the Army & Navy stores. He was nearly 70 when he met Pattie Crocker, a retoucher of photographs for the Army & Navy. They married and had two sons and a daughter before he died in 1929, when John was five.\n\nAt 13, he went to Stowe school, Buckinghamshire, and in the early part of the second world war to the Slade School of Art in London. All he learned there was that he would not make it as an artist (although in 1994-95 he took pride in serving as Slade professor of art history at Oxford University, the first former Slade student to have held the post). Soon afterwards, Richardson was accepted for a commission in the Irish Guards but within a few days contracted rheumatic fever and was given a medical discharge.\n\nFor the rest of the war he kicked his heels as an air-raid warden in London and had a whale of a time in the impromptu nightclubs that sprang up in the cellars of bombed buildings. After the war, he met the assistant to the literary editor of the New Statesman, TC Worsley, who became his lover and hired him as occasional critic of ballet, art and fiction. In 1948 Richardson went to a party at the house of John Lehmann, the editor of Penguin New Writing; he arrived with Worsley and left with Cooper.\n\nCooper opened the doors for Richardson, not just to the great cubists, but to some of their greatest works, and to the biggest wheelers and art dealers of the century. Cooper was close to Léger and regarded himself as the world expert on Juan Gris. Most useful of all, of course, was his friendship with Picasso, which quickly expanded to embrace Richardson.\n\nSoon after their meeting, Cooper bought the Château de Castille near Avignon, within socialising distance of, at first, Picasso and Gilot in Vallauris, then Picasso and Roque in Cannes and Mougins and their Château de Vauvenargues. Richardson began to see that he might become Picasso’s Boswell, although thus far he had written only three small but fine studies, one on Picasso’s watercolours and gouaches (1956), one on Manet (1958) and one on Braque (1959), the last of these in the excellent but lamentably short-lived Penguin Modern Painters series.\n\nHe also compiled the chronology for the catalogue for the great Braque exhibition at the Edinburgh festival in 1956 and worked with Cooper on the notes about the paintings and the introduction, but, true to form, the sacred monster Cooper stole all the credit and blamed the lack of acknowledgment on the Arts Council.\n\nIn 1958 the pair fell out when Cooper realised, after Richardson spotted a group of fake Légers that Cooper had taken as genuine, that the apprentice had outstripped the sorcerer in both connoisseurship and scholarship. After this tempestuous episode, life together became hardly tenable and Richardson made a first visit to New York to escape the rows. He returned to Castille, realised things would never be the same, and in 1960 went back to the US, where he organised a Picasso retrospective followed by one for Braque. As he wrote later, when he drove from New York to the west coast, he felt as “free as the tumbleweed I was seeing for the first time”.\n\nCooper took his payment for all he had taught his young disciple by ruthlessly annexing the works of art that Picasso had given Richardson, but his comeuppance came when the dealer D-H Kahnweiler, who had backed Richardson’s assessment of the fake Légers, commissioned Richardson to put together an exhibition of the work of Gris, which felt to Cooper like a personal insult.\n\nIn the post-Cooper years, living in New York, Richardson had access to most of the big American collectors and helped Alfred Barr, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, to select modern French work for the museum. He worked for the American office of Christie’s and contributed to the New York Review of Books and Vanity Fair; outlets in Britain included the Burlington Magazine.\n\nWhen, in 1994, the BBC made Richardson on Picasso, a series of half-hour programmes on Picasso related to the Tate exhibition Picasso: Painter/Sculptor, Richardson showed himself to be a natural. He spoke vividly about the creation of Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, and wittily recounted how an acquaintance of Picasso’s friend, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, had stolen a couple of antique Iberian sculpted heads from the Louvre, which found their way into Picasso’s studio.\n\nThe artist, of course, was intensely motivated by the primitive. The moral, Richardson pointed out, was that since Les Demoiselles, in his view the greatest work of the 20th century, had been created partly as a result of the theft, no one could have any complaints.\n\nHe also wrote and presented a Channel 4 series, Picasso: Magic, Sex and Death, in 2001, and contributed to various TV programmes about Picasso and other artists.\n\nRichardson was knighted in 2012. He is survived by a brother, David.\n\nJohn Patrick Richardson, writer and art historian, born 6 February 1924; died 12 March 2019\n\nThis article was amended on 17 March 2019. John Richardson did not meet Juan Gris when he was introduced to the avant garde in the south of France by Douglas Cooper in the years after the second world war – Gris died in 1927."
