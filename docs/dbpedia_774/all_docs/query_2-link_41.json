In his five seasons on the Bluff, Mitchell has been instrumental in helping assemble a Duquesne roster talented enough to advance to the Atlantic 10 Championship final in 2021 and earn a national ranking during the 2022 season.\n\nOver the past three seasons, Duquesne has had nine student-athletes earn All-Atlantic 10 honors, while the Dukes have placed a player on the Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team in four of Mitchell's five seasons on the Bluff.\n\nPrior to joining the staff for the Dukes, Mitchell spent two seasons as an assistant coach, as well as one as recruiting coordinator, at Tiffin University in 2017 and 2018. In the second of his two years at Tiffin, Mitchell helped lead the Dragons to an overall record of 15-4-1 (.775) as well as both the 2018 Great Midwest Athletic Conference regular season and conference tournament titles. Tiffin concluded the year ranked No. 18 ranking in the final United Soccer Coaches poll. The Dragons, who peaked at No. 12 in the poll during the regular season, their highest ranking in school history, earned the top seed in the NCAA Division II Midwest Regional. To cap that memorable season, the 2018 Tiffin coaching staff was named the Midwest Region Staff of the Year in a vote of the United Soccer Coaches Association.\n\nIn his one year as recruiting coordinator, Mitchell helped the Dragons improve from an 8-7-3 (.528) record to 15-4-1 (.775) in 2018.\n\nA native of Brighton, England, Mitchell played at Notre Dame College (Ohio), where he helped the Falcons to a pair of NCAA Division II Tournament appearances. As a junior, he led the Mountain East Conference (MEC) with 14 goals, five of which were match-winners. In addition to being named the 2013 MEC Offensive Player of the Year, Mitchell garnered a spot on the All-MEC First Team, was named to the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) All-America Third Team and was also bestowed NSCAA All-Region First Team plaudits.\n\nAs a senior, Mitchell was second on the team with six goals and four assists in earning all-region honors for a second time. A double major in communications and public relations at Notre Dame College (Ohio), where he earned his degree in 2015, Mitchell was also named to the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) Academic All-District First Team in 2014. Mitchell, who began his collegiate playing career at Ashland (Ohio) University, won a pair of state cups and finished second twice while serving as the U15, U16, U17, U18 and U20 coach at Pacesetter Soccer Club in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nMitchell began his collegiate coaching career at Lourdes University in Sylvania, Ohio, where he completed his master's in organizational leadership in 2017.\n\nHe is currently working toward his NSCAA Advanced National Diploma.\n\nTweet #GoDukes"
