He was 52. My heart goes out to his family, especially his wife and four kids, his friends and colleagues. I just wanted to share this picture as it shows Erik's BIG personality perfectly. We were two geeks who loved to dig into compute hardware and keep expanding the underpinnings of the internet. He contributed to the Open Compute Project Foundation, ITRenew, Iron Mountain, Dell Technologies, Seagate Technology, SNIA and so many more. He always came ready to debate AND collaborate. He was smart as a whip and eternally curious. We could butt heads and still go have a beer when we were done. I really appreciated that about Erik. He will be missed.
