        "text": "A talented performer, improviser, teacher, conductor, counter-tenor, piano/organ tuner, fiddler, and saw player, John Richardson delights in performing varied programs of musical rarities. He began playing the piano at the early age of three, and by age eight he was the organist at his father’s church. John began formal organ study at the age of 16 under the instruction of Marie Johnson in his hometown of Lakeland, Florida. He made his concert debut at the world-renowned Spivey Hall at Clayton College and State University in Morrow, Georgia, where he was privileged to study under Virgil Fox’s chosen student, Richard Morris. John is a graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied pipe organ performance with John Weaver. He was delighted to work as an assistant at the Wanamaker Grand Court Organ in Macy's Department Store in Philadelphia, playing the world’s largest operational pipe organ. John has served as Director of Music and Principal Organist in several large churches and is currently the organist at Myers Park Baptist Church and First Church of Christ, Scientist in Charlotte, North Carolina."
