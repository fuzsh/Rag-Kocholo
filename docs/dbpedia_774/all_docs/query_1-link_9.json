        "text": "1.\n\nGoing Out Again 02:19\n\nWe’re going out again Just to find If I stayed at home I could lose my mind I’m out the door Down the street Grab a cab So many there to meet I know I will be there with the boys and girls from anywhere So follow if you dare Cus we’re going out again It must be love You gave me something I was dreaming of I won’t be glib Or indiscreet Just disconnect my feelings From your sleeve I almost turned around But I fell in love with many sounds That will not fade away And we’re going out again Don’t you know I walked away in silence And you probably did the same Yesterday I wasn’t so reliant Now you know I’m gonna break down? And go out again I always seem to say That I’ll stay in bed for many days But I can’t keep away And we’re going out again We’re going out again\n\n2.\n\nTurning On Blue 04:16\n\nMerry Christmas on the telephone Hold the line before you dial And make it worthwhile Got of lot of what’s coming to me In the interim won’t you smile And tell me you’re alive too And I’ll meet you on the boulevard If not on Sunday then on Monday Then you tell me it’s another day Where the world can show you nothing Now you’re turning on blue Down at Lulu’s there’s a holocaust How did I get so uninspired To let it fall through Three o’clock you’re in the tiled room The only place you know right now is Coming back to haunt you We can make it if we hurry now Before the last few hours come calling And I guess I know the reasons why You will stay forever lost inside you’re Turning on blue With all we’ve been through They’re so glad you made it If only I could trade it In for something else I need it now My infatuation could be your frustration At any moment now I will come round to Turning on blue It’s all I can do April showers on the face card Tell the gypsy you’ll be back To hit the road Jack Roaring on to find a clipper ship There’s a blinking light ahead But don’t pass go, go on through And I’ll meet you on the boulevard If not on Sunday then on Monday Then you tell me it’s another day Where the world can show me nothing Now I’m Turning on blue With all we’ve been through Turning on blue It’s all I can do\n\n3.\n\nToday And Tomorrow 04:29\n\nCrying at the movies Laughing in the news Show me entertainment I’ve already used Like a revolver Smoking from a round You hit me with the world from which I’ve already drowned In my time of trying I wondered why you lied to me then Blood bells rang aloud until I heard the call Now clashing worlds are trying to Harmonize in your eyes Waiting for a sign that’s far away like Today and tomorrow Christ on the postcard Christ on the phone All the lies that find you now You’ve got to let them go Nothing but a memory Nothing left to feel Just paralyzing moments That I can reveal So send me something I can idolize Or despise When we’re all alone we’re far away Like today and tomorrow If there’s a hush heard all the while Don’t let it bring you down Blow a candle out in style And if you break with feelings gone forever Then you’re lying In my time of trying I wondered why you lied to me then Blood bells rang aloud and then I heard the call Now clashing worlds are trying to Harmonize in your eyes Waiting for a sign that far away Like today and tomorrow\n\n4.\n\nYour Heart Beats Alone 04:03\n\nWasting my time, you think I’m out of line I wanted to see how much I really could take this time If you remember how you remember a thought will cling Go to sleep now cos you can blame no one for anything Although the silence won’t be known Tonight your heart beats alone And they say I’m drawn to the very same thing Unlike the prophet who sees only stars worth remembering Calling all souls who follow their footsteps to a bitter end Resolute now you’ve got to begin to begin again At the dawn you’re over the unknown Tonight your heart beats alone Chase away your reasons for disdain Nobody can hear you when you’re sane With the pain comes the rain Although the silence won’t be known Tonight your heart beats alone\n\n5.\n\nIf you’re getting married tonight I really hope you know all that’s true There’s another road in the light That draws me away from you So take your foolish pride and go on You’ve made it clear through all your tears There’s no denying If you’re getting married tonight I really hope he loves you Chances come and go as you run through everyone’s avenue Far be it from me to advise so I’ll leave it all up to you And though our Saturdays are over now There’s still some time to rectify our lives together If you’re getting married tonight I really hope he loves you And though our Saturdays are over now There’s still some time to rectify our lives together If you’re getting married tonight I really hope he loves you And if you’re getting married tonight I think you know I love you\n\n6.\n\nOn The Runway 02:55\n\nOn the runway I listened and lied A solitary sigh On the runway A quiet man who sees The desperate fire in me And if I could write these letters in the air I would tell my story for everyone to share You were there On the runway I’m not too far from home They’ll listen by the phone On the runway Immortality Will soon be haunting me Now there’s no relief from pills and alcohol By the same token I’ll know you’ll hear my call After all On the runway You wait for change and you will find You’re not alone There’s no time for remorse now If I could go back I know I’d do everything the same And if I could write these letter in the air I would tell my story for everyone to share You were there On the runway\n\n7.\n\nWe Started Over Again 03:17\n\nUntil we started over again I fell upon a world so strong But nothing you could draw upon Doesn’t it make you wonder where the truth lies We woke anew to rendezvous But we’ll look back before we’re through Chasing down the days before You never thought you’d ever feel this way Until we started over again I lost my will I lost the need To reconcile my friend Over again Did something happen to you in your life I fell upon a world that wasn’t right In your eyes there’s a light Be it strange to rearrange Because nothing can be done by change Heaven loves to greet you with your dark eyes We woke anew to rendezvous But we’ll look back before we’re through Chasing down the days before You never thought you’d ever feel this way Until we started over again I lost my will I lost the need To reconcile my friend Over again\n\n8.\n\nSilent Town 04:03\n\nThe day will dawn I guess it’s not my own Tomorrow’s cries have already been shown Remember me as I would have been before But don’t look back, you will not ask for more Things we’ll never be In a silent town Suddenly the ship of fools has gone Of course it’s not the avenue we’re on Scenes we’ll never see In a silent town Dream eternally In a silent town This hold land of treasure Nothing designed for pleasure Falling traces of A world you left behind You woke up once You woke up far from home Gravitating back won’t leave you alone Things we’ll never be In a silent town Scenes we’ll never see If only love was free These dreams keep haunting me In a silent town\n\n9.\n\nGood Thing Going 02:55\n\nMy tale begins tomorrow Should I beg steal or borrow To be free I’ll meet you at the station Where you lie in desperation Endlessly When trouble fills these times I’ll lie down by your side We’ve got a good thing going If I should get to see you I’d be glad to say I need you In this way I told her that I’d follow In a world that seemed so hollow Yesterday And your world would stay that way Forever and a day Don’t throw your love away We’ve got a good thing going You’d know that I was lying If I said I wasn’t trying To forget about the things that used to be Forever and a day Don’t throw your love away We’ve got a good thing going When trouble fills these times I’ll lay down by your side We’ve got a good thing going\n\n10.\n\nCompromise 03:03\n\nI’ve been here before so many times That I’ve forgotten just what I really thought we could be Now I’m falling away in your eyes I’m watching the way I’m stuck in this compromise Sugar said she was through with it all Now she would do whatever she could To be free Did anyone see her demise Now we’re watching the way We’re stuck in this compromise Get out get back Don’t tell them you’ll make concessions I thought by now You’d turn in a new direction Alone We’ve been here before so many times that we’ve Forgotten just what We really thought we could be Did anyone see our demise Now we’re watching the way We’re stuck in this compromise\n\n11.\n\nSitting all alone in the dark You can see the sun Feeling ever so far apart I guess you always knew That I felt this way for you But you can’t wait for time Running on but only so far In a world of blame Takes me back to see where you are And if you say it’s true whey do I belong to you You can’t wait for time Laughing in the hallway while the preacher stood and read Trying to uncover all the secrets of the dead And if you say it’s true Then I’ll fall in love with you But you can’t wait for time You face a world of strangers even though you’d like to be Among the ones who walked out only wanting to be free I guess you always knew that I felt this way for you But you can’t wait for time\n\n12.\n\nSpent the morning in the Leidseplein When you’re gone you know i feel no pain Running far away just to be by your side She left her paycheck in the morning sack When you lose your love it won’t come back In an hour you won’t know what you’ll find When love is true it takes so long I’ve been dying to feel something this strong Before the lights go down If I stay around this feeling that I found Will only bring me down for a while Tried to keep the chance of fate intact When you lose your love you want it back Holding on to what I feel will surpass Our love is true it takes so long I’ve been dying to feel something this strong Before the lights go down If I stayed around this feeling that I found Will only bring me down for a while To cross the ocean in a world so black Linger on until you can’t go back Dangerously waiting for something new Our love is true it takes so long I’ve been dying to feel something this strong Before the lights go down If I stayed around to follow you This feeling that I found Will only bring me down It’s worth falling down To get back on the ground for a while"
