        "text": "James Reaney wrote a piece about Jack that appeared in Saturday's London Free Press. Today's online edition has this expanded story.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nJack Richardson, 1929-2011\n\nBy HANK DANISZEWSKI and JAMES REANEY The London Free Press\n\nLast Updated: May 15, 2011 8:59am\n\nThe Canadian music industry is mourning the loss of legendary producer Jack Richardson.\n\nRichardson produced hit records for stars such as The Guess Who, Alice Cooper and Bob Seger before coming to London to teach in the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College.\n\nTo folks in the Canadian music scene he was “Jack the Bear,” a commanding presence in the studio.\n\n“Jack found the very best and brought them together to work. He single-handedly raised the bar for the Canadian music industry,”\n\nsaid Bob Ezrin, another legendary. Canadian producer for groups such as Kiss and Pink Floyd.\n\nRichardson had been in frail health for some time and had been living at the Amica retirement residence in London. He died at University Hospital on Friday night. He was 81.\n\nIn the 60’s Richardson gambled that he could turn The Guess Who into Canada’s first rock superstars.\n\nCoincidentally, former Guess Who lead singer Burton Cummings happens to be on his way to London to perform Saturday night at the John Labatt Centre.\n\nCummings dedicated the show to Richardson and played hit after hit that was made through their collaboration.\n\nCummings toasted Richardson, calling him a \"good friend and a great producer, who will . . . , through the music, live forever.\"\n\nAt one point, Cummings looked up to the rafters of the John Labatt Centre's RBC Theatre, saying, \"Jack Richardson is up there smiling,\" he said.\n\n\"Imagine, he's up there with Jim Morrison, John Lennon and Buddy Holly, my goodness.\"\n\nIn a post on his blog, Cummings hailed Richardson as a great friend who taught him about producing and arranging.\n\n“Jack actually mortgaged his house to take us to New York in 1968 to record Wheatfield Soul. From that album surfaced “These Eyes” which changed things forever for some guys from Manitoba,” wrote Cummings.\n\nRichardson had a rare instinct for recognizing and promoting talent, said Terry McManus, a retired Fanshawe professor who shared an office with Richardson for 17 years.\n\n“He had that sense of what a good song was like nobody else I know.”\n\nLondon documentary filmmaker Bruce Carter's 2002 film Adventures in Rock aka Adventures in Rock and Roll told Richardson's story as the man who almost single-handedly built the Canadian rock and roll scene starting in the mid 1960s.\n\nCarter, who visited Richardson just a few days before his death said he was beloved and revered within the industry. He said peers such as Phil Ramone and Sir George Martin of Beatles fame rated Richardson as one of the top five producers in the world.\n\nDespite his success, Carter said Richardson never let the fame go to his head. Carter said when he approached Richardson about doing the documentary he looked puzzled and asked “Why?\n\nCarter said Richardson knew how to deal with egotistical rock stars and won their respect by always telling them the truth.\n\n“He was grounded and he kept everybody else grounded,” said Carter.\n\nA native of Toronto, Richardson was a bass player in the big band era before going into advertising, becoming an executive with Coca-Cola.\n\nHe helped produce a promotional album for Coca-Cola called A Wild Pair featuring The Guess Who and the Staccatos (later the Five Man Electrical Band) which sold for $1 and 10 bottle cap liners.\n\nIn 1968, with Allan Macmillan, Ben McPeek and Peter Clayton, he founded Nimbus 9 Productions and signed as their first artist, The Guess Who.\n\nIn 1972 he designed and built Nimbus 9's Soundstage Recording Studio at Toronto.\n\nDuring this time, Richardson worked as a record producer and took the helm for dozens of albums for Canadian, American and international acts including The Boss Brass, Poco, Christopher Ward, Rough Trade, The Association, Badfinger, The Toronto Chamber Orchestra, The Brecker Brothers, Hagood Hardy and the Canadian Brass.\n\nOf his 14 albums for The Guess Who, 11 were Canadian gold, five were Canadian platinum with five gold and three platinum records in the United States. His records with Alice Cooper and Seger also achieved gold and platinum status in Canada and the U.S. Richardson produced 27 Billboard charted singles and more than 20 Billboard charted albums and has received 38 gold and platinum awards.\n\nHe was chair of the industry advisory board for the Music Industry Arts Project at Fanshawe College in the late 1970s. In 1985 he became the audio production instructor for the MIA program at the college.\n\nHis son Garth went on to become a famed music producers in his own right and is based in Vancouver.\n\nAlong with Ezrin he produced the hit version of K’naan’s “Wavin’ Flag” by Young Artists for Haiti.\n\nThe Junos and CARAS recognized his leading role in Canadian music by naming the producer of the year award The Jack Richardson Producer of the Year award in 2002.\n\n.\n\nIn 1986 the CARAS/Juno, Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award was presented to him. Richardson is a member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the London Music Hall of Fame. SOCAN presented Richardson with its Special Achievement Award in 1988. In 2003, Richardson was awarded the Order of Canada.\n\nIn London, Richardson is recognized by the Jack Richardson Music Awards, the city's only not-for-profit celebration of its musical excellence. Richardson agreed to let organizers use his name and encouraged their education programming. He appeared at several JRMA events over the years. Richardson attended the 2011 JRMA gala at the London Music Hall on April 10. He was greeted with a standing ovation and honoured by performers and fans all evening. Richardson signed autographs and chatted with a new generation of London music scenesters that night after the formal ceremonies had ended.\n\nA memorial service is being organized and will likely be held on Thursday.\n\nAlong with his wife Shirley and his son Garth he is survived by son Kelly and daughters Tracy and Brooke. He was predeceased by his son Craig who died in 2009.\n\nhttp://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2011/05/14/18148911.html"
