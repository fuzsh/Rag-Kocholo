        "text": "about me\n\nI live in Provincetown on Cape Cod, and I grew up in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, just outside of Minneapolis. I studied history at Grinnell College in Iowa and then got my Master’s degree in musicology from New England Conservatory. For most of my 20s I worked as an executive recruiter at the Boston-based search firm called Isaacson, Miller.\n\nWhen I was 29 I started getting jobs in piano bars and it’s still my thing! I play on weekends in Provincetown, mostly at the Crown and Anchor where I do a 2-hour long piano party. I’ve also written a bunch of original songs: Spotify link here!"
