        "text": "Dear Mr. Elbell,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located the series Indexes to the Carded Records of Soldiers Who Served in Volunteer Organizations During the Civil War in the Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1762 - 1917 (Record Group 94) that include an index card for [Pennsylvania] Smith, Joseph B - 122nd Infantry, Company G. The card indicates there should be a consolidate military service record (CMSR) for him in the record series Carded Records Showing Military Service of Soldiers Who Fought in Volunteer Organizations During the American Civil War in Record Group 94. Most of the service records in this series have been made available via microfilm and through digitization of the microfilm. Unfortunately, the records for Pennsylvania Volunteers have not been microfilmed or digitized.\n\nTo request a copy of his non-digitized service record, please download the NATF Form 86, fill it out to the best of your knowledge, and mail the completed forms to the address listed on the form. Please include a copy of the file unit from the Index. For more information see Requesting Copies of Older (pre-WWI) Military Service Records.\n\nThere also may be a pension file for him, however please note that not all Civil War soldiers received a pension. The majority of Civil War pension files in the Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs (Record Group 15) are in the custody of the National Archives at Washington, DC - Textual Reference (RDT1). There are also 3 record series (XC files) in Record Group 15 at the National Archives at St. Louis (RL-SL) that include claims files relating to Civil War Veterans. These records were transferred to the National Archives in 1952 and 1955 from the VA. Please email both RDT1 at Archives1reference@nara.gov and RL-SL at stl.archives@nara.gov with full details about the soldier you are researching.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to guidance received from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA has adjusted its normal operations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work while also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of NARA staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may experience a delay in receiving an initial acknowledgement as well as a substantive response to your reference request from RDT1 and RL-SL. Also, Please note that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has suspended reproduction and digitization services until further notice due to COVID-19. Orders will not be serviced until operations can resume safely. NARA has also temporarily suspended the option for placing online orders using eservices.archives.gov. Once operations resume, document reproduction requests will be filled in the order in which they were received. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your research!\n\nElliot, I have to apologize for offering some mixed up information. My Dad is 87 and got a couple of names confused.\n\nThe soldier I'm looking for info on is actually John Smith, who was born in Butler County, Pa. in 1839. His father Henry came to the states in 1836 from Germany. The original last name was spelled Schmidt, but was changed when he settled in Pa.\n\nThe Smiths moved to Canoe Township, Pa to take up farming. John engaged in farming with his family, and in helping out on other farms. In early 1863 he enlisted in the Union Army, and was assigned to Company L, 102nd Regiment P.V.I. (also known as the old 13th Regiment).\n\nHis unit was dispatched to Camp Reynolds at Rappahannock Station. He became a sharpshooter in November of 1863, and served with the 6th Army Corps.\n\nSome of his engagements include Gettysburg, Win Run, Spotsylvania, North Anna River, Tolopotomoy, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, Fort Stevens, Charlestown, Winchester, Fishers Hill, Cedar Creek, Fort Steadman, Sailors Creek and Appomattox. He was wounded in the hand at Cedar Creek, and carried the bullet in his hand until he died. He was discharged after Appomattox and returned home to continue farming. His wife was Catherine Binn, from Germany, who died in 1895. They had 5 children who survived, and 3 who died in infancy. He owned 150 acres of farmland in Canoe Township, and was a regular member of the Grand Army of the Republic post in Punxsutawney. There is no date mentioned on when he died.\n\nHe also had an older brother named Adam, who served in Company I, 162nd P.V.I. (Pa. Volunteer Infantry) and was wounded at Bull Run. Very little is known about Adam except that he returned to Jefferson County after being discharged to take up farming.\n\nThis is information my Dad copied from his book of the History of Indiana County and sent me.\n\nThe Joseph Smith I asked about earlier was a cousin of John's.\n\nThank You Elliott.\n\nI wish I had time to do the research, but with our work staff at about 50% less since the Covid crisis, we aren't getting much time off or applicants either.\n\nI'd like to find any unit transcripts, photos or details that might have been recorded by a company adjutant or staff officer.\n\nAnything like troop movements, orders, maps, stories, letters written by the unit members, etc.\n\nI guess I'll have to contact the Library of Congress and other agencies that might have these.\n\nI know there are still distant family members that live in the areas where John and Adam had farms, and a couple of the farms from the family are still being worked. John would be my great, great grandfather on my dads mother's side.\n\nThanks again...!!\n\nIf you run across anything else, don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nLooking at the tombstone of Adam Smith on Find-A-Grave.com, it says that he was attached to \"Company I 62nd PVI.\" It's easy to see how that could be mistaken for the 162nd.\n\nHere's what I was able to find about the 62nd:\n\nUNION PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS\n\n62nd Regiment, Pennsylvania Infantry\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nOrganized at Pittsburg as 33rd Regiment August 31, 1861.

Total 258.\n\nThis information courtesy of the following website:\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units-detail.htm?battleUnitCode=UPA0062RI\n\nInformation from Adam Smith (1 Feb 1836-13 Apr 1915) Find-A-Grave memorial:\n\nBorn near Neuengronau, Hessen, Germany; a son of Heinrich & Elizabeth (Zinkhan) Schmitt.\n\nHe was a veteran of the Civil War, having served with with 62nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry until he was shot through one of his hands during battle.\n\nHe later resided in Bell Township, Jefferson County, where he was farmer.\n\nHusband of Mary Thomas Smith.\n\n~ The Pennsylvania Department of Vital Records-Death Certificate Number-38662.\n\nBack to John: Information from John Smith (17 May 1839-19 Oct 1934) Find-A-Grave Memorial. It has a copy of his death certificate, but when you click on the tombstone, the image is of the tombstone of his daughter Carrie.\n\nHe was a son of Heinrich & Eva Elisabeth Zinkhan Smith, a German emigrant family of Hessian birth. It is believed that he was the first of his family born on American soil, born not long after they came to Butler, PA. They later removed to northern Indiana County with a number of other Hessian families, many of whom helped found the St. Paul's German Reformed Church (Old Round Top), now defunct.\n\nJohn was the husband of Catharina Blinn Smith, who came to America when young from Niederhausen by Winterbach in Pfalz-Zweibrücken, Kingdom of Bavaria.\n\nAs an adult, he served in the American Civil War as a sharpshooter in the 102nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, Co. L. but suffered a severe injury when he was shot through either one or both of his hands.\n\nAll the best in your research effort. Please reply if you need additional help."
