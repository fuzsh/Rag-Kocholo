Having established himself as one of the most exciting players in Toronto, he relocated to NYC in 2022 to find Vincent Herring at Manhattan School of Music. Herring’s mentorship and advocacy for Jacob’s talent led to the recording of Jacob’s sophomore album in December 2023 for the Cellar Music Group label, featuring both Herring and drummer Joe Farnsworth. In the summer of 2023, Jacob performed twice at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington D.C., and at the Burlington Jazz Festival (VT) as a member of the prestigious Betty Carter Jazz Ahead program. Since moving to NYC, Jacob has also performed with Peter Washington, the Mingus Big Band, and the Erena Terakubo Septet.\n\nThe Jacob Chung Quintet’s 2022 debut album Epistle was received with critical acclaim for its embodiment of the spirit of jazz; “A bunch of swingers that know the history without the baggage, they zip the ears open with a delightful sound that uplifts while it makes you smile” (Chris Spector, Midwest Record). Jacob’s aesthetic direction has drawn comparison to that of the 1990s neo-bop renaissance. Will Chernoff (Rhythm Changes) writes that “Jacob and the band are part of a full-on second generation of Young Lions,” a sentiment expanded upon by Jamie Lee Rake (Shepherd Express): “What they are about is connecting the dots between the sophisticated heat of jazz royalty such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie with a post-bop drive.” The Jacob Chung Quintet has played at several major Toronto venues and festivals including The Rex Hotel, The Jazz Bistro, TD Toronto Jazz Festival, TD Markham Jazz Festival, and Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nView Event →\n\nRobin Jessome & Blunt Objects\n\nROBIN JESSOME & BLUNT OBJECTS\n\naugust 10 @ 2:00 PM\n\nRobin Jessome -Trombone\n\nNo Reservations\n\nCover Charges\n\n$15 Front Section\n\n$10 Back Section\n\nBlunt Object is a Toronto-based 11-piece jazz ensemble performing energetic, creative music; balancing unique improvisors with quirky and compelling arrangements.

Born in Jerusalem, Israel to parents who are both visual artists, Jacob moved to Canada and (with his parent's encouragement) began studying music shortly afterwards. Early on in his musical pursuits, Jacob was fortunate to attend a workshop and play with his jazz clarinet-hero, the legendary Buddy DeFranco. This moment continues to serve as a huge musical inspiration for Jacob. Subsequently, he joined the student jazz band, Toronto All-Star Big Band, further developing his love for performance and delving deeper into the jazz tradition.

Raised on Country and Rock & Roll, she fell for jazz during her formative years. Lalonde began singing around her hometown of Midland in small jazz duos and trios, and for her local Big Band. Eventually the clarity and strength of her voice led her into serious vocal study and she obtained an Honours Bachelor of Music Degree in Performance from Wilfrid Laurier University. She excelled in her studies, winning a performance scholarship, several prestigious concerto competitions, and holding the title roles in the University’s opera productions.\n\nAfter graduating she recorded a solo album of jazz and big ­band hits produced by jazz veteran Bill King. The album Spinning Daydreams, features some of Canada’s finest and most sought after musicians including Kevin Breit (Norah Jones, kd lang, Cassandra Wilson), Davide DiRenzo (Jacksoul, Sophie Milman, Tomi Swick), Duncan Hopkins (Diana Krall, Mark Murphy, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass) and Ann Lindsay (Blue Rodeo, Dionne Warwick, The Chieftans).\n\nFollowing the production and touring of this project, Lalonde continued to explore and hone her instrument by delving into Bel canto singing under the guidance of Metropolitan soprano Aprile Millo, and in 2015 she had the privilege of performing in Italy alongside Ms. Millo for a series of concerts benefitting the Museo and Comittato Renata Tebaldi, the Amici delle case di Puccini, and Villa Verdi. While there, she was also honoured to work with legendary Conductor Maestro Richard Bonynge.\n\nJessica enjoys a diverse array of performing opportunities including recent collaborations with Juno award winner Chris Gestrin for a headlining performance of “From Heaven to The Centre of The Earth,” a multi­media performance art piece at the Vancouver Art Gallery’s FUSE Festival. She has also performed backing vocals on three Born Ruffians albums, and is featured on Will Currie and the Country French’s album,They Killed Us, Jaymze Bee’s soon to be released collaborative project, Muse and jazz giant, John MacMurchy’s latest Art of Breath recording project. Looking to expand into new markets Jessica signed with Folkstar Productions and re-released her Christmas single “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” to overwhelming support. With these appreciations she is now headed back into the recording studio with the talented John MacMurchy to record her second album. Look for her new album to drop late 2018.\n\nUltimately the connecting thread between these various musical genres and adventures, has been an ability to express the core emotion of whatever composition she is singing, whether by Puccini, Gershwin or a local folk rock band. This expression is filtered through an open heart and depth of understanding; channelled through a voice that feels as though it may unleash at any moment, but chooses rather to remain grounded; an unaffected purity of tone conveying shadow and light.\n\nView Event →\n\nCLASSIC REX JAZZ JAM hosted by CHRIS Banks\n\nJam with us!

Anchored by the core rhythm section of Anderson-Bowes and Fung, the group’s past performances have featured excellent local and international guest musicians, including saxophonist Kelly Jefferson, pianist James Hill, guitarist Andrew Marzotto, French vibraphonist Simon Mouiller, and, for two nights at The Rex this past July, the eminent American saxophonist George Garzone.\n\nView Event →\n\nDebi Botos Gypsy-Swing Ensemble\n\nDebi Botos Gypsy-Swing Ensemble\n\nAugust 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 @ 5:30 pm\n\nDebi Botos - Guitar\n\nNo Reservations\n\n$10 Cover Charge\n\nIf Gypsy jazz as a whole is what those in the biz would call a “niche market,” then Django in June’s target market is a niche of a niche. A micro niche. A nichette. What we try to do here is offer North Americans relatively easy access to expert instruction in what I (Andrew) lamely call “the European approach” to playing Gypsy jazz.\n\nStrictly speaking, that means very little because there are so many different European approaches to playing Gypsy jazz. Mini micro niches. Still, any American jazz guitarist who goes to Europe and tries jamming on jazz manouche with people whose musical roots run deep in the genre is going to quickly notice many differences. Those difference are what I’m referencing when I use the terms “Gypsy jazz” or “jazz manouche.” It’s an inevitably inexact way of summing up the unique contributions that Django Reinhardt and his musical heirs brought to what had previously been a purely American musical tradition. Those elements are sometimes frustratingly foreign to us Americans.\n\nNot so, though, for Debi Botos, whose Romungro Gypsy heritage (a variety of Hungarian Roma) may help explain why she is developing so quickly into an excellent Gypsy jazz guitarist. She lives in Toronto now, and has most of her life. But her family’s roots are in Rakamaz, Hungary, a village located where the rivers Tisza and Bodrog converge. Her mother would sing nóta and csardas around the house and Debi soaked it up.\n\nHer father and one brother are jazz drummers, another plays guitar. It would be hard to imagine better preparation than that for your first encounter with Django’s music. Or your first trip to Django in June…which for Debi was only in 2018! With a little help from Denis Chang she found herself jamming in Angelo Debarre’s suite, with the grand master looking on. Not long after, those of us who follow Debi on Facebook were treated to her encounter with Dorado and Samson Schmitt when father and son played Koerner Hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music. In 2019 we got to vicariously sit in on her endless jamming around the campfires of Samoreau.\n\nWhen you have Debi’s talent and dedication, those sorts of encounters have a way of developing into friendships and collaborations. For example, in the video below she is joined by two giants of contemporary Gypsy jazz—Samson Schmitt and Ludovic Beier—for a rendition of one of her own compositions, “Bolero for Schmitt”. Like theirs, our own friendship and collaboration with Debi is just beginning. At Django in June 2022, yours can too.\n\nView Event →\n\nJABFUNG\n\nJABFUNG\n\nAUGUST 14, 15, 16, 17 @ 8:30 pm\n\nJulian Anderson-Bowes - Bass\n\nAnthony Fung - Drums\n\nLuis Deniz - Saxophone\n\nRaphael Zaldivar - Keys\n\nJabFung, a project helmed by bassist Julian Anderson-Bowes and Richmond Hill-born, LA-based drummer Anthony Fung, has emerged in recent years as one of Toronto’s leading presenters of collaborative jazz residencies.

Individually, the members of the WPBE have worked with a who's who of Canadian and international musicians, from Feist to the Shuffle Demons, but together, whether it be blending acoustic bass with turntables or analog synths with the saxophone, the WPBE sets out to twist and bend both originals and covers, straddling genres and butting heads with expectation. Often compared to Medeski Martin Wood or the Bad Plus, the boys like to think of themselves as the ugly love child of Radiohead and Miles Davis.\n\nSince forming in 2005, they have shared stages/ toured with the likes of the Bad Plus, Happy Apple, Jeff Parker, Rich Brown, Rich Underhill, Kelly Jefferson and Elizabeth Shepherd.\n\nThey have played festivals and clubs throughout North America including the TD Canada Trust Toronto Jazz Festival, NXNE, the Wreckhouse Jazz Festival (St. John’s, NL), the Ottawa Jazz Festival on Canada Day, IAJE, as well as filling notable venues/clubs like the Rex (Toronto), Schuba's (Chicago), Le Garage (Winnipeg), Yardbird Suite (Edmonton), Bassment (Saskatoon) and the Beat Niq (Calgary), the NAC (Ottawa), and The Cellar (Vancouver). They were recently referred to as a \"highlight\" of the 2012 TD Canada Trust Jazz festival in Toronto.\n\nThe band has just released it's latest EP, \"Sometimes Things Go Wrong (and other songs we shouldn't play)\". It was recorded live in Vancouver on their last tour while promoting their last album,\"Dost Thou Believeth in Science\" (2009). Like their first album, “Thanks for Coming Out”(2006), Dost thou received critical acclaim from traditional and online media such as the Toronto Star, Wholenote Magazine, Something Else! (jazz.com), FFWD, and All About Jazz.Com (including being the featured download of the day). The album has received national and international radio rotation, reaching # 1 on the CIUT Charts in Toronto, #28 on the overall Canadian College Radio Charts (Earshot) and was featured on CBC Radio 3.\n\nTheir music has also been used for film and videos for the United Nations, Teletoon, CBC and the National Film Board - including the NFB's video tribute to dancer, Peggy Baker at the Governor General Awards. They were shortlisted as part of Toronto's NOW Magazine and the Harbourfront Centre's \"Soundclash\" competition and were showcased in the June 2012 issue of Canadian Musician.\n\nView Event →\n\nJABFUNG\n\nJABFUNG\n\nAUGUST 14, 15, 16, 17 @ 8:30 pm\n\nJulian Anderson-Bowes - Bass\n\nAnthony Fung - Drums\n\nLuis Deniz - Saxophone\n\nRaphael Zaldivar - Keys\n\nJabFung, a project helmed by bassist Julian Anderson-Bowes and Richmond Hill-born, LA-based drummer Anthony Fung, has emerged in recent years as one of Toronto’s leading presenters of collaborative jazz residencies.

Raised on Country and Rock & Roll, she fell for jazz during her formative years. Lalonde began singing around her hometown of Midland in small jazz duos and trios, and for her local Big Band. Eventually the clarity and strength of her voice led her into serious vocal study and she obtained an Honours Bachelor of Music Degree in Performance from Wilfrid Laurier University. She excelled in her studies, winning a performance scholarship, several prestigious concerto competitions, and holding the title roles in the University’s opera productions.\n\nAfter graduating she recorded a solo album of jazz and big ­band hits produced by jazz veteran Bill King.

With these appreciations she is now headed back into the recording studio with the talented John MacMurchy to record her second album. Look for her new album to drop late 2018.\n\nUltimately the connecting thread between these various musical genres and adventures, has been an ability to express the core emotion of whatever composition she is singing, whether by Puccini, Gershwin or a local folk rock band. This expression is filtered through an open heart and depth of understanding; channelled through a voice that feels as though it may unleash at any moment, but chooses rather to remain grounded; an unaffected purity of tone conveying shadow and light.\n\nView Event →\n\nCLASSIC REX JAZZ JAM hosted by CHRIS Banks\n\nJam with us!

A micro niche. A nichette. What we try to do here is offer North Americans relatively easy access to expert instruction in what I (Andrew) lamely call “the European approach” to playing Gypsy jazz.\n\nStrictly speaking, that means very little because there are so many different European approaches to playing Gypsy jazz. Mini micro niches. Still, any American jazz guitarist who goes to Europe and tries jamming on jazz manouche with people whose musical roots run deep in the genre is going to quickly notice many differences. Those difference are what I’m referencing when I use the terms “Gypsy jazz” or “jazz manouche.” It’s an inevitably inexact way of summing up the unique contributions that Django Reinhardt and his musical heirs brought to what had previously been a purely American musical tradition. Those elements are sometimes frustratingly foreign to us Americans.\n\nNot so, though, for Debi Botos, whose Romungro Gypsy heritage (a variety of Hungarian Roma) may help explain why she is developing so quickly into an excellent Gypsy jazz guitarist. She lives in Toronto now, and has most of her life. But her family’s roots are in Rakamaz, Hungary, a village located where the rivers Tisza and Bodrog converge. Her mother would sing nóta and csardas around the house and Debi soaked it up.\n\nHer father and one brother are jazz drummers, another plays guitar. It would be hard to imagine better preparation than that for your first encounter with Django’s music. Or your first trip to Django in June…which for Debi was only in 2018! With a little help from Denis Chang she found herself jamming in Angelo Debarre’s suite, with the grand master looking on. Not long after, those of us who follow Debi on Facebook were treated to her encounter with Dorado and Samson Schmitt when father and son played Koerner Hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music. In 2019 we got to vicariously sit in on her endless jamming around the campfires of Samoreau.\n\nWhen you have Debi’s talent and dedication, those sorts of encounters have a way of developing into friendships and collaborations. For example, in the video below she is joined by two giants of contemporary Gypsy jazz—Samson Schmitt and Ludovic Beier—for a rendition of one of her own compositions, “Bolero for Schmitt”. Like theirs, our own friendship and collaboration with Debi is just beginning. At Django in June 2022, yours can too.\n\nView Event →\n\nMark Eisenman Quartet\n\nMark Eisenman Quartet\n\nAugust 21, 22, 23, 24 @ 8:30 PM\n\nMark Eisenman - Piano\n\nMike Murley - Saxophone\n\nNeil Swainson - Bass\n\nTerry Clarke - Drums\n\nMark Eisenman is one among a handful of the top ‘in-demand’ jazz pianists in Toronto.

Individually, the members of the WPBE have worked with a who's who of Canadian and international musicians, from Feist to the Shuffle Demons, but together, whether it be blending acoustic bass with turntables or analog synths with the saxophone, the WPBE sets out to twist and bend both originals and covers, straddling genres and butting heads with expectation. Often compared to Medeski Martin Wood or the Bad Plus, the boys like to think of themselves as the ugly love child of Radiohead and Miles Davis.\n\nSince forming in 2005, they have shared stages/ toured with the likes of the Bad Plus, Happy Apple, Jeff Parker, Rich Brown, Rich Underhill, Kelly Jefferson and Elizabeth Shepherd.\n\nThey have played festivals and clubs throughout North America including the TD Canada Trust Toronto Jazz Festival, NXNE, the Wreckhouse Jazz Festival (St. John’s, NL), the Ottawa Jazz Festival on Canada Day, IAJE, as well as filling notable venues/clubs like the Rex (Toronto), Schuba's (Chicago), Le Garage (Winnipeg), Yardbird Suite (Edmonton), Bassment (Saskatoon) and the Beat Niq (Calgary), the NAC (Ottawa), and The Cellar (Vancouver). They were recently referred to as a \"highlight\" of the 2012 TD Canada Trust Jazz festival in Toronto.\n\nThe band has just released it's latest EP, \"Sometimes Things Go Wrong (and other songs we shouldn't play)\". It was recorded live in Vancouver on their last tour while promoting their last album,\"Dost Thou Believeth in Science\" (2009). Like their first album, “Thanks for Coming Out”(2006), Dost thou received critical acclaim from traditional and online media such as the Toronto Star, Wholenote Magazine, Something Else! (jazz.com), FFWD, and All About Jazz.Com (including being the featured download of the day). The album has received national and international radio rotation, reaching # 1 on the CIUT Charts in Toronto, #28 on the overall Canadian College Radio Charts (Earshot) and was featured on CBC Radio 3.\n\nTheir music has also been used for film and videos for the United Nations, Teletoon, CBC and the National Film Board - including the NFB's video tribute to dancer, Peggy Baker at the Governor General Awards.

Look for her new album to drop late 2018.\n\nUltimately the connecting thread between these various musical genres and adventures, has been an ability to express the core emotion of whatever composition she is singing, whether by Puccini, Gershwin or a local folk rock band. This expression is filtered through an open heart and depth of understanding; channelled through a voice that feels as though it may unleash at any moment, but chooses rather to remain grounded; an unaffected purity of tone conveying shadow and light.\n\nView Event →\n\nCLASSIC REX JAZZ JAM hosted by CHRIS Banks\n\nJam with us!

A micro niche. A nichette. What we try to do here is offer North Americans relatively easy access to expert instruction in what I (Andrew) lamely call “the European approach” to playing Gypsy jazz.\n\nStrictly speaking, that means very little because there are so many different European approaches to playing Gypsy jazz. Mini micro niches. Still, any American jazz guitarist who goes to Europe and tries jamming on jazz manouche with people whose musical roots run deep in the genre is going to quickly notice many differences. Those difference are what I’m referencing when I use the terms “Gypsy jazz” or “jazz manouche.” It’s an inevitably inexact way of summing up the unique contributions that Django Reinhardt and his musical heirs brought to what had previously been a purely American musical tradition. Those elements are sometimes frustratingly foreign to us Americans.\n\nNot so, though, for Debi Botos, whose Romungro Gypsy heritage (a variety of Hungarian Roma) may help explain why she is developing so quickly into an excellent Gypsy jazz guitarist. She lives in Toronto now, and has most of her life. But her family’s roots are in Rakamaz, Hungary, a village located where the rivers Tisza and Bodrog converge. Her mother would sing nóta and csardas around the house and Debi soaked it up.\n\nHer father and one brother are jazz drummers, another plays guitar. It would be hard to imagine better preparation than that for your first encounter with Django’s music. Or your first trip to Django in June…which for Debi was only in 2018! With a little help from Denis Chang she found herself jamming in Angelo Debarre’s suite, with the grand master looking on. Not long after, those of us who follow Debi on Facebook were treated to her encounter with Dorado and Samson Schmitt when father and son played Koerner Hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music. In 2019 we got to vicariously sit in on her endless jamming around the campfires of Samoreau.\n\nWhen you have Debi’s talent and dedication, those sorts of encounters have a way of developing into friendships and collaborations. For example, in the video below she is joined by two giants of contemporary Gypsy jazz—Samson Schmitt and Ludovic Beier—for a rendition of one of her own compositions, “Bolero for Schmitt”. Like theirs, our own friendship and collaboration with Debi is just beginning. At Django in June 2022, yours can too.\n\nView Event →\n\nBoogaloo Squad\n\nBoogaloo Squad\n\nAugust 28, 29, 30, 31 @ 8:30 PM\n\nJoel Visentin - Organ ( Aug 28, 29, & 31 )\n\nAlan Zematias - Organ (Aug 30)\n\nAdam Beer-Colacino - Guitar\n\nJeff Halichuk - Drums\n\nToronto-based keyboardist and composer Joel Visentin is a proud Winnipeg export with a passion for the Hammond B3 organ.

Raised on Country and Rock & Roll, she fell for jazz during her formative years. Lalonde began singing around her hometown of Midland in small jazz duos and trios, and for her local Big Band. Eventually the clarity and strength of her voice led her into serious vocal study and she obtained an Honours Bachelor of Music Degree in Performance from Wilfrid Laurier University. She excelled in her studies, winning a performance scholarship, several prestigious concerto competitions, and holding the title roles in the University’s opera productions.\n\nAfter graduating she recorded a solo album of jazz and big ­band hits produced by jazz veteran Bill King. The album Spinning Daydreams, features some of Canada’s finest and most sought after musicians including Kevin Breit (Norah Jones, kd lang, Cassandra Wilson), Davide DiRenzo (Jacksoul, Sophie Milman, Tomi Swick), Duncan Hopkins (Diana Krall, Mark Murphy, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass) and Ann Lindsay (Blue Rodeo, Dionne Warwick, The Chieftans).\n\nFollowing the production and touring of this project, Lalonde continued to explore and hone her instrument by delving into Bel canto singing under the guidance of Metropolitan soprano Aprile Millo, and in 2015 she had the privilege of performing in Italy alongside Ms. Millo for a series of concerts benefitting the Museo and Comittato Renata Tebaldi, the Amici delle case di Puccini, and Villa Verdi. While there, she was also honoured to work with legendary Conductor Maestro Richard Bonynge.\n\nJessica enjoys a diverse array of performing opportunities including recent collaborations with Juno award winner Chris Gestrin for a headlining performance of “From Heaven to The Centre of The Earth,” a multi­media performance art piece at the Vancouver Art Gallery’s FUSE Festival. She has also performed backing vocals on three Born Ruffians albums, and is featured on Will Currie and the Country French’s album,They Killed Us, Jaymze Bee’s soon to be released collaborative project, Muse and jazz giant, John MacMurchy’s latest Art of Breath recording project. Looking to expand into new markets Jessica signed with Folkstar Productions and re-released her Christmas single “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” to overwhelming support. With these appreciations she is now headed back into the recording studio with the talented John MacMurchy to record her second album. Look for her new album to drop late 2018.\n\nUltimately the connecting thread between these various musical genres and adventures, has been an ability to express the core emotion of whatever composition she is singing, whether by Puccini, Gershwin or a local folk rock band. This expression is filtered through an open heart and depth of understanding; channelled through a voice that feels as though it may unleash at any moment, but chooses rather to remain grounded; an unaffected purity of tone conveying shadow and light.\n\nView Event →\n\nKenji Omae East Coast Quintet\n\nKenji Omae East Coast Quintet\n\nAugust 4 & 5 @ 8:30 PM\n\nKenji Omae - Saxophone\n\nAdrean Farrugia - Piano\n\nJake Hanlon - Guitar\n\nPaul Rushka - Bass\n\nAnthony Michelli - Drums\n\nKenji Omae is a Canadian Jazz saxophonist based in Nova Scotia, Canada.

Individually, the members of the WPBE have worked with a who's who of Canadian and international musicians, from Feist to the Shuffle Demons, but together, whether it be blending acoustic bass with turntables or analog synths with the saxophone, the WPBE sets out to twist and bend both originals and covers, straddling genres and butting heads with expectation. Often compared to Medeski Martin Wood or the Bad Plus, the boys like to think of themselves as the ugly love child of Radiohead and Miles Davis.\n\nSince forming in 2005, they have shared stages/ toured with the likes of the Bad Plus, Happy Apple, Jeff Parker, Rich Brown, Rich Underhill, Kelly Jefferson and Elizabeth Shepherd.\n\nThey have played festivals and clubs throughout North America including the TD Canada Trust Toronto Jazz Festival, NXNE, the Wreckhouse Jazz Festival (St. John’s, NL), the Ottawa Jazz Festival on Canada Day, IAJE, as well as filling notable venues/clubs like the Rex (Toronto), Schuba's (Chicago), Le Garage (Winnipeg), Yardbird Suite (Edmonton), Bassment (Saskatoon) and the Beat Niq (Calgary), the NAC (Ottawa), and The Cellar (Vancouver). They were recently referred to as a \"highlight\" of the 2012 TD Canada Trust Jazz festival in Toronto.\n\nThe band has just released it's latest EP, \"Sometimes Things Go Wrong (and other songs we shouldn't play)\". It was recorded live in Vancouver on their last tour while promoting their last album,\"Dost Thou Believeth in Science\" (2009). Like their first album, “Thanks for Coming Out”(2006), Dost thou received critical acclaim from traditional and online "
