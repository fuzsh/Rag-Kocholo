        "text": "Biography\n\nJohn Richardson (Xi Upsilon – 1986) is a graduate of Eastern Illinois University where he received his B.M. in Jazz Studies. He then received his M.M. in Saxophone from the University of Kentucky. While attending graduate school, John inserted himself into the nationally acclaimed Lexington music scene by playing in local rock, R&B, and Americana bands while also performing in the UK Faculty Jazz Combo, Miles Osland Little Big Band, and Dimartino/Osland Jazz Orchestra.\n\nAfter graduate school, John decided to stay in the Lexington, KY area and developed a large private studio, directed the Jazz Arts Foundation Youth Ensemble, became adjunct saxophone, winds, and jazz instructor at three local colleges and two high schools all while working at Don Wilson Music and maintaining a three-night a week performing schedule. After a few years, he was hired as General Manager for Miles Ahead Music in Louisville, KY where he helped owner Miles Davis (woodwind specialist…not the great trumpet player!) grow a store from 800 square feet into 4000 square ft and eventually a second location.\n\nAfter seven years at Miles Ahead Music, he accepted the position as Jupiter Brand Manager at KHS America. With his knowledge of instruments coupled with his performing and teaching experience, John was a perfect fit for the position. At KHS America John was in charge of marketing and product development of Jupiter Band Instruments, Azumi Flutes, and Altus Handmade Flutes.\n\nSix years later he became and currently holds the position of National Sales Manager for St. Louis Music, which is the owner of Blessing Band Instruments, Knilling Strings, Hamilton Stands, and Alvarez guitars, and are sole US distributors for P. Mauriat Instruments, Tomasi Flutes, Dixon Drums, Sela Percussion and distribute over 8,000 musical accessories."
