        "text": "Click on artist name to go to their music page\n\nCLICK HERE to see IPO Chicago 2022 Artist Yearbook Photos\n\nArtists From Chicago\n\nAlpine Subs – The latest album by these local Chicagoans, Through The Blinds, was released earlier this year on South Africa’s Subjangle label, and their sound – on this and their earlier releases – is definitely jangle pop all the way! Whether Beatle-esque, Monkees-esque, or Folky/Soft Pop-esque, if you like any (or all) forms of jangle, you will love Alpine Subs!\n\nThe AnnaMaze – Comprised of two core members, Anna Maze and Jim Licka, with a rotating cast of other musicians, the band is a refreshing mixture of dark indie country, and the blues: think Johnny Cash and June Carter, if they were from Chicago. The soulful vocals of Anna Maze combined with the haunting cries of Jim Licka are sure to leave you wanting more. The new album, That’s What I Want ‘Em To Say, is out now on all digital streaming platforms.\n\nPhil Angotti – The venerable musician is practically a household name in power pop circles, and especially in his home town of Chicago. Both he and his band The Idea have released a bunch of tremendous CDs, and Phil’s latest solo acoustic effort, Still Life proves he just keeps getting better! We were honored to host the debut performance of Material Re-Issue at IPO Chicago in 2011, and Phil Angotti’s lead vocals and guitar channeled the spirit of Jim Ellison as well as it could possibly be done.\n\nThe Artist Formerly Known As Vince Band – A fun new old school band whose latest record, On Display, is an actual record…on spiffy colored 12” vinyl no less! Glitter glam garage all the way, baby!\n\nAugust Hotel – Powerful power pop, with hints of new wave, ambient haze, funk, arena rock, indie-rock and everything in between. Check out their latest EP, Stations, and their IPO showcase to see and hear for yourself!\n\nThe Bishop’s Daredevil Stunt Club – Drawing from a diverse array of musical styles, The Bishop’s Daredevil Stunt Club’s song arrangements are the product of technique, style and innovation with great attention to detail in the areas of tone, rhythm, harmony and song structure. Their style has been described as falling someplace between The Cars and Sloan, as well as a “sideways Cheap Trick” (by yours truly), and their latest full-length release, End Over End, takes this comparison and kicks it up a notch, with hints of Queen, Rick Springfield, and Lenny Kravitz on some songs. The result is a mix of indie rock, power pop new wave, and dance club R&B that is truly infectious!\n\nThe Bon Mots – Once called “Chicago’s Best Kept Secret” by All Music Guide, The Bon Mots are certainly no secret to power pop afficionados, thanks to their impeccable songwriting and energetic performances. Elements of their songs have been compared to The Byrds and The Zombies, but their most recent album, Best Revenge, adds a few mind-bending twists to the classic jangle pop. They were one of our favorites when they last played IPO Chicago in 2005, so we’re excited to have them back again. Their IPO Chicago 2022 showcase will also feature new tunes from their next album, and is a show not to be missed!\n\nDolph Chaney – His album, Rebuilding Permit, earned him acclaim as Woody Radio’s 2020 Artist of the Year. His latest release, This is Dolph Chaney (on Big Stir Records), is both a career retrospective and a leap forward in production, courtesy of collaboration with Nick Bertling (of Bertling Noise Laboratories). Fans of Chaney’s prior “DIY” work, XTC, Jason Falkner, and other pop classics will dig it!\n\nMichael Steven Cohen – Known to many an IPO audience as one of the main men of The Abbeys and The Pop Dollys, both of which had long been staples at IPO Chicago, Cohen stepped out in 2018 for his first time at IPO as a solo performer, and we’re thrilled to have him back again this year! He’s amassed an impressive repertoire of some of the most melodic, incredible, memorable love songs from the mid-20th century. Expect him to pull out some jazz and pop standards, big band stuff with just his voice & guitar, and to tell a little story about the song (when there is one)!\n\nChristopher Elam – A singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist currently putting the finishing touches on his third solo record. Past bands include Plains, Shelley Miller, and the Nashville Wreckers. His folky style and silky voice may remind one of Elliott Smith if he was part of the Canterbury scene in the early ‘70s! Check out his latest Notes From The Borderline album and his IPO showcase to hear for yourself!\n\nThe Embryos – Their recent album, National Absurdatory, released on Kool Kat Musik, invites the listener to explore an alternate dimension of sound and mind. Psychedelic pop, funk pop, jangly folk pop and power pop meld and twist in compelling ways that somehow all work within the space of a single album. Think The Beatles meet The Grateful Dead at a Zappa concert, with Lou Reed joining in just for fun!\n\nForbidden Kingdom – If their debut single “I’ll Make It By” and their follow up “Over” are anything to judge by, Forbidden Kingdom is well on their way to being a new-found favorite of many a power pop and indie pop fans alike. Hooks galore, Beatle-esque melodies, and bouncy indie pop vocal inflections…we were blown away by their live performance at IPO Chicago in 2019 (as Beyond), and can’t wait to see and hear them do it again with new members Ellis Clark and Eric Chial!\n\nHannah Frank – The Hannah Frank Group is Hannah Frank (Vocals, Songwriting), Ben E. Miller (Bass) Victor Sanders (Electric Guitar), Meg Thomas (Percussion), performing original folk/roots, sometimes with special guests. Fans of Lucinda Williams and Melissa Etheridge will dig their spoken-word lyrics, mellow grooves and explorations into rock and soul.\n\nGal Gun – Understated complexity topped off by instantly accessible melodies make Gal Gun stand out from the crowded Chicago garage-rock scene. Drawing heavy influences from ‘90s behemoths like Weezer and Blur while balancing a softer sound influenced by Belle & Sebastian and The Shins, their sound is equal parts familiar and refreshing. The band’s music and lyrics hope to strike a chord between triumph and heartbreak, emulating the Mancunian bands of the ‘80s in their ability to hide a world-weary pessimism amidst a full pop stride…and have fun doing it! Their latest album, Critical Hit, will be exactly that in the collection of many a fan of fuzzy rock hooks, clever chord changes, and sweet vocal harmonies!\n\nGo Time! – A prolific band offering power pop with a hard-edged groove and a touch of soul that will appeal to fans of artists such as Frisbie, Guided By Voices, and The Clash, to name just a few! Their eighth full length album, appropriately entitled Eight Ball, will appeal to long time fans and new converts alike!\n\nGolden Richards – Gil Golden and Billy Richards met at a midnight showing of Enter the Dragon starring their idol, bad-ass Bruce Lee. Sharing a thing for surfing, Borg and McEnroe, tetherball, Farrah Fawcett, Bubble Yum gum and the Trans Am, they started a band that features New Wave Power Pop with big hooks. Just listen to any of their Bandcamp singles and check them out at their IPO showcase, and you too will be an instant fan of their “Rock N Roll Kung Fu”!\n\nInnkeepers – If you like catchy hooks, buzzing guitars, and energetic bass lines, with a steady back beat, look no further than Innkeepers! Their latest release, Red Dawn, has it all, and has been compared by their bass player, Eddy Crouse, as “The Cars via The Replacements.”\n\nKerosene Stars – Independently rocking Chicago since 2010, the band has put out a slew of excellent EPs and singles over the years, including last month’s “Purpose of a Friend”. Noah Berlatsky of The Chicago Reader has described the band as a “them as a [s]mart unpretentious Beatles-loving group with a sure hand for hooks… It’s perfect pop.” Who are we to argue? (Especially since he’s right!)\n\nKing Mixer – Local power pop stalwart Eric Howell is back again with his latest project, and we at IPO are glad to have him! Howell’s music has always felt the long shadow of the British Invasion, Motown, and the twang of Americana, which is now blended with the sunny ‘70s of Laurel Canyon and the pangs of Irish melancholy. The debut King Mixer CD, Hang On, heaped up some rave reviews for its sound that has been called “equal parts Paul McCartney and Paul Simon backed by R.E.M” (Audities Powerpop Fanzine). Check it out now!\n\nLocal Motive – If you like your pop hooks with a touch of funky soul, look no further than Local Motive! Their latest full-length, Grams, captures the electric energy of a Local Motive performance, bursting with lyrical messages, irresistible soulful melodies, and the spirit of old-school rhythm & blues. We can’t wait to see them do their thing live at their first IPO!\n\nThe Locals – An alt-pop/indie rock trio who have been part of the Chicago scene for over a decade, The Locals have toured all over the US and UK, and we’re honored to have them back again at IPO! The music is bright, guitar-laden, ultra-catchy, alt-pop, that delivers tasty ear-bits from each song’s start to finish. Front-woman Yvonne Doll has also been named as one of the “Top Female Guitarists You Should Know” by Guitar Player Magazine. Fans of The Pixies, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Silversun Pickups will not be disappointed. Check out their latest album, Minutes, Seconds, Degrees, and their IPO showcase!\n\nPacky Lundholm – A fixture on the Chicago scene for quite some time, Mr Lundholm has lent his talents to many local acts, such as I Fight Dragons, Kory Quinn, and Gold Coast All Stars, but is an accomplished power popper in his own right! His debut album under his own name, American Soccer, combines Americana and classic rock elements with that heartland power pop energy that we love! Fans of Springsteen and Lou Reed will dig it! His latest masterpiece, Track Sabbath, is an eclectic three-part opus closely following Lundholm’s stream of consciousness in creativity with a little bit of something for everyone!\n\nAbby Lyons – Lyons pens and sings songs both poignant and uplifting using ukulele and piano, and has developed a fan base of over 50,000 YouTube followers. Her recent album, I’m Not Famous, will appeal to fans of more well-known artists, such as Hillary Duff and Miley Cyrus, as well as to fans of IPO veterans of Liverpool and San Francisco, respectively, Fun of the Pier and The Corner Laughers.\n\nThe Midwest Theory – Brought up on MTV and pop music, Chloe started singing at the age of 11, and got her first guitar on her 13th birthday. Several bands and YouTube videos later, she finds herself back in Chicago at the helm of her latest project, The Midwest Theory. The band’s latest EP, The Quarantine Sessions, mixes poignant lyrics, compelling melodies, and Chloe’s haunting voice.\n\nDrew Neely & The Heroes – Neely has long been a Chicago favorite for his quirky brand of power pop with folk-pop-styled story-teller lyrics, punk pop sensibilities, and sticky hooks. With his current band, The Heroes, he takes his penchant for intelligent lyrics and catchy melody to a whole ‘nother level! They’ve put out two EPs are working on a full-length LP. Their latest EP, This Could Be You, vol 1, and a slew of recent singles (all named after various girls) offer a tuneful preview of more power pop goodness due out soon!\n\nAndrew Robert Palmer – He’s a home-grown solo pop/punk/rock artist with a penchant for quirky chord changes and grunge pop choruses. Fans of artists from Drew Neely (see above) to Blink 182 to Nirvana, Johnathan Richman, and Ben Folds will all find something to love in his collection of fine EPs. Quite the eclectic entertainer!\n\nPenthouse Sweets – The members of Penthouse Sweets (who include Eric Chial of The Bon Mots, see above) have a combined 100 years of experience doing everything from pop rock/psych rock/folk rock and – well, basically anything that rocks! If you like big guitars, loads of jangle, and heaps of harmony, you will love Penthouse Sweets!\n\nThe Pickpockets – The band’s debut, By The Time We’re Through, contains thirteen tracks where distinctive vocals relate indelible narratives while guitars alternately dignify and rub dirt on the agreeable melodies. The band’s sound is influenced by British and American post-punk and indie music of the ’80s and ’90s. With a pandemic-induced break from their devotion to their live shows, they’ve also begun releasing a series of EPs showing off their range; the latest, The 1 Dream, includes everything from horns to strings, as well as their own quirky brand of theatrical punk pop. We can’t wait to see them do their thing live again!\n\nThe Queue – Building a reputation for their roaring guitars and unforgettable hooks, The Queue have found a way to fuse solid melodies, indelible harmonies and gritty rock to produce a sound their fans have identified with and called their own. With a distinctive British pop influence, interlaced with an American alternative sound, their style (which can be heard on their Turn It Up, Turn Me On EP) singles them out from the traditional. Their just-released follow up, Get Out Of Now, was well worth the wait! As they say in Liverpool, “These are too good!”\n\nAlain Quinn – Born and raised on the north side of Chicago by musician parents, Alain Quinn began learning about music at the same time she was learning to walk. This is partly why her organic music flows so naturally from her raw emotions. Her latest album, Paradise, is an amalgam of funky jazzy dreamy pop.\n\nThe Red Wigglers – A quirky art-pop-rock combo with horns! Fans of artists such as The B52’s, The Talking Heads, or Chicago indie-popsters (and IPO veterans!) Beatnik Turtle should check out their 2018 album, Let’s Canoodle, and their ultra-entertaining live show at IPO!\n\nRolling Numbers – A local quartet who deliver original songs in a style they’ve dubbed “American Cosmic.” The lyrics are heart-felt, the vocals (both male and female) are rich and soulful, and the musicianship is tight and inventive. Fans of Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac will dig their recently released self-titled LP.\n\nRollo Time – The describe themselves as just a bunch of guys who’ve played music together over the years, who finally got together and recorded a bunch of songs. Said songs can be heard on their full-length CD, Victims of the Crown, and a slew of more recent singles, and will rock you out in the classic power pop tradition. Think Matthew Sweet, Cheap Trick, Guided By Voices and XTC all rolled into one, and you get the picture! A new album is in the works!\n\nRob Schulz Band – IPO audiences may recognize Schulz as one of the main men behind Swinger, but he’s also put out a couple of fine CD’s under his own name. Influences from The Kinks to The Beach Boys to Elvis Costello abound, but he brings his own unique personality and sensibilities to the fore. His work displays a wealth of hook-packed classic power pop that is earnest, tuneful, sincere, dynamic and accessible. His latest album, Something to Believe In, an exciting 13-song collection of older material that never really got its due, was recorded with Brad Jones at Alex The Great Studios in Nashville, and was well worth the wait!\n\nVee Sonnets – The Sonnets were (and are) much loved for their trademark glitter glam power pop sound, and even took the show on the road to join us for IPO Liverpool one year! It’s been a while since they last played IPO, but we’re honored to have their leader, Vee Sonnets himself, back for a special solo performance, which we’re sure will still really rock!\n\nErich Specht (of Push Puppets) – Push Puppets are an indie rock act offering well-crafted songwriting with hooks that are hard to shake and production that is awash in harmony and creative guitar firepower. The lyrical sensibilities of some of the heroes from Specht’s youth, such as Paul Westerberg or Elvis Costello, have clearly impacted his songwriting which is often brutally honest and always memorable. Check out songs for the upcoming release, Allegory Grey, at this IPO showcase!\n\nThe Spindles – The Chicago-based Spindles feature original melodic power pop and classic covers. Their 2018 release, Past and Present, mixed and mastered by Grammy-Award Winner Blaise Barton, ranked #12 on Goldmine Magazine’s Top 30 Power Pop albums of 2018, #4 on Pop Rock Record’s Must Have Top 20 Power Pop albums of 2018, and #38 on David Bash’s Top 125 Best Power Pop Albums of 2018! “The Spindles Are Here To Bring Power Pop (Back) To The People!” (Goldmine Magazine)\n\nCatherine Tecktiel – IPO audiences may remember Tecktiel as the lead vocalist and keyboardist of Magatha Trysty, but she’s also a fine singer/songwriter in her own right! Her piano-driven melodic style is a mix of folk and indie-pop, and her vocals have been compared to Aimee Mann and Chrissie Hynde, so fans of those artists should come check her out!\n\nThe Thin Cherries – The newest musical project founded by scene vets Steven Delisi and Mark Lofgren. Delisi is a musician and songwriter with a background in theater and film production. His former band, Phenomenal Cat, blended his pop/punk sensibilities with experimental music and the Russian folk influences of his band mates. Songwriter/musician Lofgren is one of the founders of psychedelic pop/rock mainstays The Luck of Eden Hall, who have toured Europe and released music on a variety of independent labels, including Headspin Records and Fruits de Mer Records. Their shared love for bands like Blur, the Replacements and the Smiths can clearly be heard on their latest release as The Thin Cherries, On Moose Lake.\n\nToo Much Saturn – Classic Midwest power pop served up with loads of crunchy hooks, soaring harmonies, big drums, 12-string bass, swirling keyboards and a liberal mix of crunchy, ambient and jangly guitars. Fans of artists from Cheap Trick to The Gin Blossoms to Fountains of Wayne should sit up and take notice of these guys! Check out their Moving Forward Sideways CD and their latest single, “Life On Repeat”; their next single, “Stop Thief”, is dedicated to Guy Sheldon, their bass player who recently passed away.\n\nThe Unswept – Charlie and Ryan O’Brien relocated from sunny Sheffield, UK to a small but tiny apartment in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, where they write and record power pop tunes. With their hook laden songs featuring cowbell, handclaps, and sibling harmonies, we think they fit right in with Chicago’s power pop heritage! Their highly anticipated fourth full length album, Fast Casual, is due to be released just in time for IPO Chicago, and we can hardly wait! Fans of Teenage Fanclub, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys will really dig them!\n\nThe Walkdown – Led by singer/songwriter/guitarist Michael Mazza (who also led the Chicago indie rock band Collectors for several years) and joined by Walter Kiefer on bass and keys, Taylor Morse on lead guitar, Erica Loftus on vocals and Phil Valenti on drums, The Walkdown are a “new” band with a wealth of songwriting and performing experience. With touchstones such as Oasis, Primal Scream and The Rolling Stones, their sound can best be described as “Brit inflected indie rock.” Check out their debut single, “The Distance (Gets in the Way)”, and their IPO showcase to hear for yourself!\n\nMark Watson – Otherwise known as the leader of the Mark Watson Band, whose now classic coulda…shoulda…woulda… CD earned rave reviews and international airplay for its modern pop rock sound, full of hooky choruses, big guitars, smart lyrics and a heaping helping of harmonies. They’re back in the studio with a new line up and some new music, featuring bigger guitars and more bite while retaining all the tunefulness of their previous work, as their 2021 single, When Two Still Feels Alone, will attest. Watson and Band have treated us to a sample of their new material for the last few years at IPO Chicago, and we can’t wait to hear some more this year!\n\nPhil Yates & The Affiliates – Yates is an indie power pop artist formerly based out of Burlington, VT, who for the past several years has made his home in Chicago, and Vermont’s loss is definitely Chicago’s gain! With his hooky sound that’s “too folky for the rockers and too rocky for the folkers,” Phil has played with artists such as The Mountain Goats, The Babies, Cave Singers, Holly Golightly, and Mary Prankster. Party Music!, his latest album with The Affiliates, is pure crunchy power pop ear candy! Enjoy!\n\nU.S. Artists From Outside of Chicago"
