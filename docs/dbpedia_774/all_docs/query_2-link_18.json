Documents created by U.S. Government officials in the course of their duties are in the public domain. Copyright interest in other documents presumably belongs to the creators of those documents, or their heirs.\n\nProcessed by: David Clark (2019).\n\n[ Top of the page | Administrative Information | Biographical Sketch | Collection Description | Series Descriptions | Folder Title List ] BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\n\nThe Center for the Study of the Korean War was founded in 1989, by Korean War veteran and retired university professor Dr. Paul M. Edwards. Originally, the collection was housed in a small office on the Independence Square in Independence, Missouri; in 2001 the collection was moved to Graceland University and housed at Graceland’s Independence Campus; and in 2010 the Center acquired its own building. The collection was donated to the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum in 2015.\n\nThe Center is a non-profit private organization supported solely by public donations. Its mission is to develop insights into the causes and costs of the Korean War, and war in general, in order to understand and promote peace. The Center’s goals are to identify, collect, preserve, display and make available archives, books, and artifacts of the Korean War; to acknowledge the contribution of Korean War veterans, and the war’s significance in American and world history; and to prompt scholarly and popular inquiry into the Korean War, why it was fought, and what can be learned from it.\n\n[ Top of the page | Administrative Information | Biographical Sketch | Collection Description | Series Descriptions | Folder Title List ] COLLECTION DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Records of the Center for the Study of the Korean War consist of correspondence, personal history forms, photographs, memorabilia, oral history interviews, autobiographies, drawings, military personnel records, flight records, certificates, identification cards, dog tags, printed materials, books, obituaries, propaganda, and newspaper clippings related to the service of Korean War veterans. The records are organized into one series, a Subject File.\n\nThe materials in the collection were primarily collected by the Center for the Study of the Korean War. Many of the records collected by the organization are photocopies of original documents that were returned to the donors. Other documents in the collection were created, collected and/or donated by the Mosquito Association (6147 Tactical Control Squadron of the Air Force), the University of Tennessee Center for War and Society, Charles Spurlin of Victoria College in Texas and Norman Zehr who served in the 40th Division Aviation Company.\n\nThe collection primarily contains materials related to the Korean War soldiers and their experiences. Documents related to the overall operation of the war have generally not been included in the collection. A large part of the collection consists of personal history forms that contain information including name, address, phone number, unit/squadron, beginning and ending dates of service in Korea, comments, favorite stories and photographs. Also included are questionnaires completed by Korean War veterans regarding their personal experiences.\n\nMuch of the correspondence consists of letters written by soldiers to family members during and after the war. The largest parts of original correspondence were donated by Paul Edwards, William Ehrlich, LeRoy Eller, Robert McCurley, and Hans Petermann. In addition to donating his letters, Patrick Flaherty also donated 164 hand-drawn images related to the Korean War.\n\nAdditional materials in the collection are various types of foreign currency, propaganda pamphlets, dog tags, identification cards, certificates, oral history interviews, autobiographies and military records. The collection also includes an extensive number of photos and slides that document the activities of the soldiers during the Korean War.\n\nRelated collections at the Truman Library include the President’s Secretary’s Files, the Korean War Files and the Korean War Collection."
