        "text": "PRESIDENT’S SOCIETY\n\nThe President’s Society is Morningside University’s way of paying tribute and expressing gratitude to those individuals who have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to the university by recognizing donors who contribute $1,000 or more during a fiscal year (June 1-May 31). This support allows Morningside to meet some of the most important needs of our students including scholarships, facility enhancements, leadership programs, and much more.\n\nJOIN THE PRESIDENT’S SOCIETY\n\nGifts may be paid annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly. Both spouses are President’s Society members with a joint gift of $1,000 or more within a fiscal year. If your employer has a matching gift program, it can be applied to meet the President’s Society membership requirements.\n\nGOLD (Graduates Of the Last Decade) members can join the President’s Society with an annual gift of $100 or more. Membership at this level is only valid during the first 10 years after graduation.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a member of the President’s Society, please contact JJ Marlow at 712-274-5424 or marlow@morningside.edu."
