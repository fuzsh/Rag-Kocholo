One of the threads that ran through her entire life was a love of all things crafty which started as a young girl crocheting and sewing Barbie doll clothes and through the years included crocheting various items, various painting styles, many projects for (and with) the girls and the grandkids and most recently involved doing vinyl designs as gifts.\n\nHer family especially remembers the joy and love that Mary put into the traditions of life.

Christmas was her yearly triumph as she always made this a magical time of year steeped in traditions for her family.\n\nMary was always a beautiful faith-filled wife, mother, and friend who encouraged those around her through her words, actions and the example she set.

Brian was a loyal employee at EDS for over 27 years retiring in 1999 as a well-respected leader and friend.\n\nDuring his children’s younger years, Brian coached or helped coach soccer, baseball and basketball teams. When he retired from EDS, he dedicated his life to service in various volunteer organizations including the Jasper High School Band Boosters where he served as volunteer coordinator and president; the Plano Senior High School Quarterback Club where he helped sell booster merchandise and set up stadium pennants for game night; the CdLS Foundation where he served on the board for six years, ran an annual golf tournament, served on the Conference Planning Committee for over 15 years and twice was a local point person for the national conferences held in Dallas; and, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton where for a number of years he provided rides through the church’s Meals and Rides Ministry.\n\nWith retirement also came the opportunity for Brian to spend his free time doing what he loved: traveling, golfing, and spending time at Flathead Lake in Montana. He enjoyed traveling the world and had the opportunity to visit much of the U.S. as well as parts of Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Most of all, he loved being on “lake time” in Montana. Some of our most cherished memories have been made at the lake house where we spent many summers together. There he was able to be outdoors, work on household projects, play golf every day, spend time with family, and entertain company. He was the best boat driver for the water skiers and tubers, and he wasn’t afraid to jump in and try those things himself. He always remained young at heart and was never afraid to endure an epic wipeout.\n\nBrian (a.k.a. Daddio/G-Pa) was a loving family man, a faithful friend, and a generous giver of his time, talents and resources. Brian shared his love for math with his children and grandchildren and was often known to bring mathematical concepts into conversations turning them into “learning opportunities.” He also loved card games and board games of all kinds and always looked forward to gatherings around the table to play. Friendly competition was the name of the game, even when it came to decorating Christmas cookies and Easter eggs. Detailed in his approach, he always gave the rest of us a run for our money. Without question, his beloved UCLA Bruins were always represented in any project.\n\nAs a sports enthusiast, Brian spent his free time watching sports of all kinds, especially football and golf. Along with his UCLA Bruins, the Dallas Cowboys held his allegiance. Many special memories have been made attending Cowboy games together through the years, and football-watching parties were common practice in his home. He would readily cheer for the alma maters of his children unless they were playing his cherished Bruins. In those cases, all bets were off, and it was every man for himself. In addition to football, golf has always held a special place in his heart. He loved watching the tournaments on TV, and he played regularly with his buddies, Bill, Sam, and Terry. Although he didn’t have the perfect game, he loved being on the course. He seemed to always be in competition with himself trying to better his driving distance, his putting accuracy, and his score. In fact, the last time he played, he hit a drive to establish his new personal record. What a sweet gift!\n\nMusic also played an important role in Brian’s life. He taught himself to play the guitar and enjoyed serenading the family in the living room at home or around a campfire at the lake in Montana. Sharing his love for folk songs and the “oldies but goodies,” left a lasting impression on his children.\n\nBrian was predeceased by his parents and granddaughter, Faith Elizabeth Sorge. He is survived by his wife, Mary Opitz; children, Lisa Dula (Tim), of Plano, Texas, Greg Luyt (Stephie), of Traverse City, Michigan, Amy Sorge (Matt), of Dallas, Texas, Katherine “Katie” Luyt, of Plano, Texas and Bradley Luyt, of Plano, Texas; grandchildren, Matthew and Kristin Dula, Grady, Emery and Theo Luyt; brother, Howard Luyt and many nieces, nephews, extended family and friends.\n\nA Visitation will be held from 7:00 P.M. - 9:00 P.M. on Wednesday, October 3, 2018 at Allen Family Funeral Options.\n\nThere will be a Mass of the Resurrection at 11:30 A.M. on Thursday, October 4, 2018 at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, 2700 W.

He met his former wife Adelina in Puebla, Mexico and they married in 1976.\n\nAlberto was a very charming person and a man of many talents with an incredible sense of humor. He was always very passionate about rock n’ roll, soccer, good food, friends, and adventures in general. He traveled with his family as much as possible and lived life to its fullest by finding pleasure in simple things. He spent the last 20 years as a single man away from his family. However, his last few years became trying, which eventually led him to become closer with his family as they helped him through his illness. In memory of the love that once brought them together, Adelina became his spiritual companion during his last few months, spending countless hours by his side. He also became very close to his children and his grandson, Julian. His family ensured that Alberto could make the most out of his last days and surrounded him with love and care.\n\nJoin us for a mass in his loving memory on Thursday, September 20th, 2018 at 6:00 p.m. at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, 2700 W Spring Creek Pkwy, Plano, TX. 75023.

He grew up and attended school in Lockport, Illinois. He was a talented musician who played several instruments including folk and electric guitars, banjo, ukulele, drums, electronic keyboards, the organ and harmonica. He played in bands called The Pole Cats and The Casuals in his late teens and early 20’s. He met his wife Mari at a dance in Lockport and they married in March of 1962. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1962 and was deployed to Vietnam. In the army he was trained to become a master photographer. He took and developed many interesting photos which documented the history of army life in Vietnam during the war. When he returned home after serving, he used his photography skills to take many photos of his wife and daughter Lisa, who was born while he was serving in Vietnam.\n\nThe family was based in Yuma, Arizona until Bob was discharged from the Army in 1967. Son Christopher was born there in 1965. They moved back to Illinois to be close to family and Bob began a career in the grocery business. He worked as a produce clerk or manger in many different grocery stores over the years and at one time owned and operated a 7-11 convenience store. Wife Mari became a real estate agent and invested in several properties which Bob often remodeled and prepared for rental or sale.\n\nBob enjoyed fishing, playing music, family get-togethers, and handy work. His large family of aunts and uncles had summer picnics and reunions that were always fun. He also loved spending time with Mari’s parents, Grandma and Grandpa Taylor, traveling to Southern Illinois to fish and ride horses near their country home. Mari’s brothers and their families often came over for parties and music jam sessions.\n\nBob was not only gifted musically, but he was artistic in that he like to draw, make crafty items, and build things. He drew cartoon characters, made mini-sculptures out of nails and various metals and built decks, sheds and a gazebo for our yard. Unfortunately, he also liked to spray paint EVERYTHING… including stripes on cars he owned and even the upholstery of his 1980 Pontiac Firebird. You know how many people think you can fix anything with duct tape; he felt the same about spray paint.\n\nThe family moved to Texas in 1985. Bob found work at Kroger Food Stores where he was employed until he retired in 2012. During his years in Texas, granddaughters Caroline and Taylor were born. He loved to spend time with them goofing around, playing music and having cookouts and swim parties at home. The family vacationed together in Mexico and Jamaica where we had some of our best times.\n\nHe loved his dogs, Soapy, Brandy, “Dog” (yes we had a dog named Dog), Baby, Sammy, and Gi Gi. He enjoyed watching boxing and pro-football and was an avid Dallas Cowboys fan. He told corny jokes and liked to do crossword puzzles.\n\nBob was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2010. His symptoms progressed the last few years. The family is proud of how he courageously endured DBS brain surgery in 2016 to improve his Parkinson’s symptoms and participated in home therapy. When he broke his hip and was hospitalized in March, he tried his best to do speech, occupational and physical therapy when he could muster the strength, all while being connected to a trach and feeding tube and fighting pneumonia and various infections.\n\nThe suffering has ended. May he rest in peace.\n\nBob is survived by his loving wife Mari Lorenc, daughter Lisa Horn and her husband Gary, son R. Christopher Lorenc and his wife Nelly, granddaughters Emma and Caroline Lorenc and Taylor Horn, step-granddaughter Shanna Bolte, great-grandchildren Chandler, Sunny, Ambiance and Lunaray, sister Marilyn Koch.\n\nThe family will receive friends for a visitation Thursday, August 16, 2018 from 5-7:00pm at Allen Family Funeral Options.

She was a spoiled brat until the day she peacefully fell asleep for the final time. She was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana and faithfully remained a Saints and LSU Tigers fan. She met Pete while he was serving in the Coast Guard in New Orleans. They married on June 18, 1960. They were blessed with five beautiful children who they ruled with an iron fist, but who never wanted for a thing.\n\nMarie supported her husband as they moved from her beloved family in New Orleans to Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and finally to Texas where they resided for almost 44 years. They made wonderful friends along the way and Marie was truly adored by many. She was loyal; spoke her mind and never allowed nonsense to get in her way or that of her husband or children. She accepted all that walked through her door as if they were family and made them feel welcome. Her home was always where everyone wanted to hang out.\n\nAt 78-years-old she could dance circles around anyone until a fall in May. As a wonderful friend stated, she is now dancing with the Saints in heaven.\n\nLeft to miss her are her treasured sister, Agnes Lotz; her sister-in-law, Carolyn Falgoust; 23 nieces and nephews; 41 great nieces and nephews and 25 great-great nieces and nephews. And no one enjoyed Family Reunions like Aunt Moutsie! Among those were her Godchildren, Frank Bevinetto, Elaine Rosiere Laviolette, David Lotz and Jean Sherlock Worona.\n\nAs a family, we thank each and every person who touched Marie’s life and, therefore, ours. The kindness, understanding, compassion and support extended during a blessed lifetime, especially in her later years of memory loss will forever be appreciated. She loved life and she loved each of you. We ask that in lieu of flowers or even donations, that you continue to be kind and accepting to those around you, as you were to Marie.\n\nWith love and sincere thanks for being a part of the Kerutis Family.\n\nWe will celebrate Marie's life with the funeral Mass on Friday, August 10, 2018 at 10:30am in the church followed by Interment in the Seton Columbarium. Afterwards everyone is invited to the Parish Hall for reception and to share our memories of Marie.\n\nMary Helen Warren\n\nDecember 08, 1939 - July 25, 2018\n\nHelen was born and raised in the coal mining community of Ralph, Pennsylvania by her parents Michael and Anna Scerbovsky along with her brothers John and Edward.

She embarked on a second career with Sears upon her husband’s death in 1981. Helen quickly climbed up the management ladder with Sears and eventually retired.\n\nIt can easily be said that once Helen retired, she was busier than when she worked. She moved from Garland to Plano and quickly became immersed in the church community of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. She worked tirelessly with the Women’s Club as well as spending time with the Prison Ministry and various other church organizations. Helen loved participating in church meetings by bringing her own brand of opening prayer. She worked tirelessly to ensure that the blessings of the day were appropriate to the subject and time of year. Helen also loved participating in Bible Study at church and could often be found sitting at her kitchen counter “studying” for her next meeting. Her hard work and dedication to the church she called her second family was recognized with the distinction of Woman of the Year but her proudest moment was when she became a Eucharistic Minister. Helen was also an avid bridge player as well as a dedicated member of the Plano Garden Club.\n\nShe is survived by her daughters, Michele Bartlett and Stephanie Fisher (Brian); grandchildren, Samuel Bartlett, Kaitlyn Bartlett, Ian Bartlett, Kaden Fisher and Kyle Fisher; and great granddaughter, Ever Lee Rogers.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held at 12:00pm on Thursday, August 2, 2018 at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, 2700 W.

Donnelley Yellow Pages division. He subsequently held various management positions in other media companies within the D&B Corporation including Moody’s International, cable television in California, and Donnelley Information Publishing. Ernie also served as the Assistant Managing Director for Thompson Locals, headquartered in Farnborough, England, and in that capacity, he represented D&B’s interests in a joint advertising venture.\n\nReturning to the United States, Ernie and his family moved to Redding, CT, while he worked in Purchase, NY for another D&B division. They subsequently moved to Plano, TX when Ernie became President & COO of For Rent Magazine, a nationally-expanding apartment guide. It was then that he became active in the National Apartment Association, and in 2013 he was awarded their Lifetime Achievement Award to recognize his many contributions to the apartment industry. Ernie retired from For Rent in 2001 after a successful career that spanned over 44 years in multiple companies and in multiple executive positions.\n\nErnie often said he never worked a day in his life because he enjoyed his job, and more importantly, truly loved and appreciated the people who worked with him. To Ernie, everyone was valuable and respected regardless of their positions in the corporate world. He always found the time to talk with people, both personally and professionally, regardless of how busy he was, and was ready to listen and offer support and counsel to those who shared their problems or concerns.\n\nAlthough his many jobs often required both domestic and international travel, Ernie’s first priority was always his family. He was a familiar face at all the local hockey rinks and supported his children in their passions. A master at rummy and poker, he taught his children the finer points of the games, especially how to bluff! His bigger-than-life personality was evident in everything he did; he loved to dance, was unconditionally devoted to his family both near and far, and always enjoyed a good joke. He will be remembered as a husband and father who handled difficult times with poise and grace, found the humor in every situation, and knew how to celebrate the good things in life including a wonderful meal and a good bottle of wine. To many, Ernie was also a loyal and lifelong friend and, over the years, he continued to attend his high school reunions as long as he was able.\n\nFuneral Services will be held on Saturday, July 14, 2018 at 12:00pm at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton.\n\nReception to follow in the Parish Hall.\n\nJack Samuel Divita\n\nFebruary 24, 1933 - June 21, 2018\n\nJack Samuel Divita, 85, of Flower Mound, TX entered into eternal peace on Thursday, June 21, 2018.

She was born February 6, 1947 in Columbus, Ohio to parents Col. Walter and Jane (Scott) Cook. Cynde was an amazing daughter, wife, mother, and grandmother. She grew up as a military dependent and lived in many places including Alabama, Illinois, Virginia, England and San Antonio, Texas, where her father held his last assignment in the Air Force. That's where she met her spouse of 50 years, Bruce Ott, while she was working a summer job at Howard Johnson's.She attended college at Texas Tech University along with her then fiancee, Bruce. After they graduated, Bruce was commissioned into the Air Force and the couple lived in Lubbock, TX, Sacramento, CA, and Phoenix, AZ, before settling in Plano, TX, when her husband started a career as a pilot at American Airlines in 1978.\n\nCynde quickly became involved in her church, St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Plano. She was on the bereavement committee, facilitated bible studies and retreats but her most recognized accomplishment was introducing and starting MOMS (Ministry of Mothers Sharing) in the Dallas Diocese. MOMS (Ministry of Mothers Sharing) was such an integral part of Cynde's life. She provided training to a core group of women at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, in Plano and went out to other parishes to help train women to become MOMS facilitators. This movement began a ripple effect that helped countless women throughout the Diocese to foster a deeper Christian commitment to their marriages and families. Furthermore, MOMS provided a support system for women. Cynde worked tirelessly and selflessly in her endeavors to see the continued spread of this Ministry. She was instrumental in facilitating growth in the faith journey of many individuals.\n\nCynde was also a Eucharistic Minister at St Elizabeth Ann Seton. Cynde was a member of a Red Hat group that had its start in 2004. Long after the group discarded the hats, they stayed together as the Scarlet Heart Sisterhood. Meeting monthly, the women fostered a spirit of fun and fellowship with one another. Bowling was also a longtime passion for Cynde. Participation in the Plano Super Bowl Thursday Girls League was something she truly enjoyed. Her teammates kept her coming until four years ago at which time her Alzheimer's prevented her from participating any longer.\n\nCynde's greatest joy in life was her family. She adored being a wife and took great pride in her marriage. She blessed and adored her three children, their spouses and eight grandchildren. One of the highlights of each year was when she and her husband would accompany the grandchildren on an annual summer \"Big Kid Trip\". When Cynde wasn't giving tirelessly to her family and her church she was managing her husband's homebuilding and gardening businesses. She spent her early years in Plano working at the library and continued to do so as a volunteer when her children were in school. She also volunteered as a leader with her children's scouting. Cynde was frequently referred to as \"St Cynde\" because of her love, kindness, and desire to give selflessly to others. She fought Alzheimer's valiantly with her husband Bruce, who was her caregiver. They traveled the world for as long as Cynde was able. They spent the last 10 years visiting places such as the British Isles, Baltic Sea, Rome, Mediterranean, Caribbean Sea, Alaska and, more importantly, trips to visit her family. The most beautiful gift Cynde gave to the world was her devout and never-ending faith. She was an inspiration for all whose lives she touched and will be missed everyone that knew her.\n\nCynde is survived by her husband Bruce Ott, children Jennifer Cushman and her husband Paul, Dennis Ott and his wife Shannon, Christopher Ott and his wife Ashley, grandchildren Allison, Andrew, Stewart, Madison, Adella, Lilibeth, Vaughn, Avery and another grandson on the way. She was preceded in death by her parents and siblings Carol Cook, Thomas Cook and Allison Cook.\n\nThe family will receive friends at a Vigil Service on Thursday, May 24, 2018 at 7:00pm at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, 2700 W.
