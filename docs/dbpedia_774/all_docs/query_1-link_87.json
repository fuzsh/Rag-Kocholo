Community involvement is so important to me.\n\nWhat motivated you to live and work in Vermont? I was motivated to live and work in Vermont by so many things! The change in seasons, the access to nature and the outdoors, and the small town community feel, just to name a few.\n\nFavorite part of your job: My favorite part of my job is being able to help people reconnect with their body and feel better.\n\nWhat is the best career advice you have received? The best career advice I have received is to set boundaries when it comes to work life balance.\n\nTell us something fun about yourself that few people know: Few people know that I was home schooled.\n\nWhat three words best describe you: Three words that best describe me are driven, composed, sociable.\n\nFavorite Vermont escape: My favorite Vermont escape is tied between the Islands of Lake Champlain and The Northeast Kingdom, specifically Lake Willoughby.\n\nFavorite downtime activity: My favorite downtime activity is anything that is outside! Kayaking, swimming, hiking, camping, biking, etc.\n\nFavorite Super Hero and why: My favorite super hero is Dr. Strange. I love his backstory, that he is this driven doctor who then is forced to explore different ways to heal, and then ultimately discovers his power.\n\nFavorite Social Media and why: My favorite social media is Instagram for posting, TikTok for entertaining!\n\nIf you had unlimited access to funds, which cause(s) would you support: The cause I would support is ending domestic violence and sexual assault.\n\nWhat career goal(s) would you like to accomplish in the next 5-10 years? The career goals I'd like to accomplish in the next 5-10 years are to grow my practice by adding more practitioners so we can help more people in Southern Vermont!\n\nHow has your community service changed since the pandemic? My community service during the pandemic has changed because I've found myself reaching for more. I've wanted to help more, I've wanted more connection, and I've wanted to keep the focus on the community during this difficult time."
