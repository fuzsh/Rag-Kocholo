        "text": "Today I had the pleasure to talk on the phone to Ryan Neff and it was a fun conversation we had we talked about new album which you should pick up if you haven’t called Rise Of The Lion, to talking about upcoming Mayhem Festival so enjoy this like I did.. Stay Metal!!!\n\nWhat is your craziest stage moment?\n\nRyan: “I’ve been known to hang from the ceiling quite a bit. In Japan I climbed a few levels into the balcony by climbing up the mains of the PA, then hung my bass over the crowd”\n\nHow was playing Rock on the Range?\n\nRyan: “ROTR was a really cool home state gig for us, we had a blast. It was cool to be a part of such a giant festival in Ohio. We don’t get to play there as often as we would like.”\n\nDid you think Echoes would be the most played song off the new album on the radio?\n\nRyan: “As far as the radio content stuff we knew it would, but that doesn’t always mean it will go well with the live audience. Its been a pleasant surprise to see it enjoyed by all the fans.”\n\nHow excited you are about playing Mayhem Festival?\n\nRyan: “The whole band is pumped. We love the festival atmosphere and can’t wait to take part in the madness.”\n\nWhat do you like to do off tour?\n\nRyan: “I’m a big auto racing fan, Sunday and Nascar are my favorite part of the week. I’m a fan of motor racing all around from F1 and Indy car to the American stock cars, and sports car racing.”\n\nIf you could fight on public figure who would it be and why?\n\nRyan: “Lets all just sock Nancy Grace once for being a total fuck.”\n\nHow do you get pumped before a show?\n\nRyan: “I like a few shots of whiskey, a good vocal and bass warm-up, and jamming some music I love to get me pumped.”\n\nHow was working with Terry Date on Rise Of The Lion?\n\nRyan: “Terry was awesome. He’s recorded so many of our favorite records so we had a blast learning from him and creating a record together.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nRyan: “Thanks for supporting ROTL, and all the Miss May I records – we love all of you and hope to see you circle pitting at a gig soon.”\n\nI want to thank Ryan and Ally for this chance to do this I hope they enjoyed it cause I did and cant wait to see these guys at Mayhem and talk to them again!!!\n\nToday I talked to Trint and Greg from the band Defy Reality these guys have a sound like old school Trivium and dress like Upon A Burning Body!!!\n\nHow did Defy Reality form?\n\nTrint & Greg: “Defy Reality formed in a small town called Garrettsville ohio, Greg Ebie our drummer and Brad Stachowski our guitarist have been just jamming together for a few years and a few small projects. I being the vocalist started doing Vocal Covers and posting them on youtube and facebook, and was contacted by my drummer Greg and asked to try out. I did and got the job, That very same day Don Chaffins came in and became out bassist of our band then the writing process began. We played our first show September 13th 2013. After that show we introduced our newest and youngest Guitarst Nick Labas to our family.”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nTrint & Greg: “Each member of this band is different. We had a huge vast diversity of metal influences individually. We have taken these and .brought them together and or agreed to disagree on certain things. We like to say we are influenced by bands like Between The Buried and Me. White Chapel. but we try really hard to take influences and keep them only influences. We don’t want to sound like this band or that band we want to sound like Defy Reality”\n\nHow is Now or Never tour going so far\n\nTrint & Greg: “We are apart of this tour but not in the way you think, we are only apart of one date of this tour and that is tomorrow, we are very good friends It Lies Within. The two bands actually touring are It Lies Within and One Year Later. We have big hopes of tour the beginning of fall”\n\nTell me about the 6 track EP you have been working on?\n\nTrint & Greg: “The six track EP we recorded back in December. The EP is a Concept EP it tells a story start to finish if i explained the entire story we would be here a while, I will give the cliff notes version. In short our EP tells of the rising up and taking over of what is evil, bad, corrupt and Making it whole again, cleansing it. i wrote five of the six songs and can you the way i wrote them allows them to take their own meaning from it and allow to relate it to something in their life, you will not hear a single cuss word in our music. We feel that throwing the F word in a song 56 times is stupid and looks like you as band cannot write or even have much of a vocabulary. We incorporated a story instead of talking about the generic metal stereotypes. like hate, death, limb dismemberment. we feel that is stupid and with as much emotion is put into metal why not have a positive message instead of preaching about killing and hate.”\n\nHow was it making the lyric video for Shell By Shell?\n\nTrint & Greg: “We actually worked with a good friend of ours Brandon Tharp who works with Behind the Lens Productions. He was very price friendly and wanted to work with us. it was a good experience.”\n\nHave you been told you guys kinda have a old Trivium sound?\n\nTrint & Greg: “We have gotten many diverse comparisons on our music from white chapel, too Trivium, August Burns Red, Between the Buried and me.”\n\nWhat are your plans after this tour is finished?\n\nTrint & Greg: “Well since you now know were not actually touring but, we are currently working on more new material to play at upcoming shows. We will currently keep writing and hopefully work on on a full length sometime in the future.”\n\nIf you spend the day with a living or dead musician who would it be and why?\n\nTrint & Greg: “Each member would have a different choice of musician, my drummer i know would pick Blake Richardson from Between the Buried in me because it is his favorite band.\n\nI personally would pick Phill Bozemen of white chapel, ive met him once and he was incredibly down to earth guy, hearing stories of the stuff hes gone through and overcome is only more inspiration to keep working on my vocals and keep pushing for my dream in this band. The band in whole, Probably love to continue to hangout with the guys in It Lies Within some Great musicians and even better people.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nTrint & Greg: “We would not be anywhere close to where we are now without support from friends, family, fans, Those big three. We can work as hard and as much as we want but if no ones there to see that hard work it doesn’t mean as much. Our fans are not just fans each one we want to get to know we want to meet. We want them to see us at a show and come up and talk to us. We love our fans, If we get signed or make it to the next level we want them to know who got us there and we wont forget them.”\n\nToday I talked to Taylor from We Gave It Hell you will see them from holes in walls to once on the big stage at Mayhem you will see them on tour also.\n\nHow did We Gave It Hell form?\n\nTaylor: “We formed originally through Craiglist ads and mutual friends. We’ve been through a lot of member changes and members going in and out of the band since the beginning. Our current lineup consists of Parker, Drew and Justin who are all original members along with Adam and Taylor who joined the band later in our career. When our singer from our first EP left, Taylor took up the vocal spot and Adam officially joined the band. We have had this lineup for almost two years.”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nTaylor: “We have a lot of different influences from all genres. We range from Deftones, Born of Osiris, and Architects to Justin Timberlake, old school West Coast hip-hop, and EDM, etc.”\n\nHow was playing Rockstar Mayhem Festival for a date?\n\nTaylor: “It was a great experience. The people at the Sumerian stage were really good to us and the crowd was sick. Kids came out of nowhere and starting moshing right when we started. And eating lunch next to Rob Zombie was pretty awesome too.”\n\nWhat was it like shooting your live music video?\n\nTaylor: “It was dope. We were playing to such a huge crowd, I sometimes forgot we were being filmed, but the footage Keene (the director) got came out sick as fuck.”\n\nHow excited are you to play on The All Stars Tour?\n\nTaylor: “We’re stoked to play with all the bands on the line-up! We’ve been listening to most of those bands for years. Stoked to see Structures for the first time!”\n\nTell me a little about your new EP?\n\nTaylor: “The new EP is called “The Conditioning” and it kind of has theme of being controlled by the hierarchies of our world and encouraging people to think outside of the box a bit. There are melodic songs, heavy breakdowns, big choruses and we’re really proud of it. The new stuff we are writing we feel is even better!”\n\nWho has been your favorite band to play with?\n\nTaylor: “It was really cool to play with Born of Osiris at last years extreme thing. They were really cool dudes and they put on a crazy live show. To share the stage with Volumes was awesome too. We’ve known them for a while now. Been following them since they started. Another big favorite of ours was Bring Me the Horizon and Killswitch Engage. Never in a million years did we think we would be sharing the stage with either. They both put on phenomenal performances and we really look up to them as people and as musicians”\n\nWhat do you like to do off tour?\n\nTaylor: “We like to chill and drink good craft brews and talk about space, play super smash bros and hang out at Drew’s house. We also probably say the stupidest shit and laugh for way too long. We can get pretty weird. I don’t think anybody makes the kind of strange noises we make when we’re together for an extended period of time.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nTaylor: “Thank you for all your support with the new EP and the band in general. We wouldn’t be anywhere without you! We can’t wait for you to hear what we’ve got in store for you next!”\n\nToday Im very excited to be part of this interview with Alex Sassaris from Eve To Adam this was so much fun and enjoyed doing this so much so I want to thank Alex and the guys and pick up there new album!!\n\nHow did Eve to Adam form?\n\nAlex: “ETA’s earliest inception began with my brother Taki and I in south Florida under the care and guidance of famed song writer and producer Desmond Child. After an early production deal, some demos and song writing sessions with Desmond, Taki and I elected to leave Florida, and transplanted to New York City in hopes of finding the right guitar player with whom we could craft a sound and style. This is when when we met New Jersey guitar hero, and brother, Gaurav Bali, after we answered his ad in the back of the Village Voice. The three of us have been making albums and touring together to present day.”\n\nHow has the response been for your album Locked and Loaded?\n\nAlex: “The response to Locked and Loaded has been phenomenal! It is sonically by far our strongest, most dynamic offering, and it is stacked from front to back with killer fucking songs….. We made a conscious effort in the studio with mega producer Elvis Baskette, to not have one track that was a throw away, or a filler track, and I feel we succeed…”\n\nHave you played any festivals this summer?\n\nAlex: “We began the festival season as the main stage opener for WJRR’s Earth Day Birthday in Orlando Florida. We have continued on to the Jager stage at Carolina Rebellion, River City Rockfest in San Antonio, Rocklahoma, KQRC’s ROCKFEST in Kansas City (largest single day festival of the year). We will round out the summer festivals with The Bear Growl in Indiana, and ROCKFEST in Cadott Wisconsin.”\n\nHow’s life on tour?\n\nAlex: “Life on tour is… a whirlwind of vans, buses, trailers, tractor trailers, planes, airports, hotels, pavement, blue skies, rainy days….dirty, sexy rock clubs, theaters, festivals……cities, towns, beers, whiskey bottles, vodka bottles, Jager bottles, red bull, monster, rock star, five hour energy, coffee, cigarettes, girls, big fat joints, dabs, edibles…crowds, fans, crew, drivers, smart phones, Netflix, shots at the bar, selling merch, adulation, self loathing, constant doubt, debt, excitement, nervousness, missing your family, longing, brotherhood, crushing it on stage, and living the DREAM!!!!”\n\nWho has been your favorite band to tour with?\n\nAlex: “Favorite band to tour with has to be Escape The Fate. We were part of a sick west coast run in Feb of 2014 as direct support, that turned out to be a total blast. The ETF guys are super cool, and throw down hard on stage. Their crowds took to our show, and it was mayhem from the first song to the last note…Crazy pits, crowd surfing, and merciless energy coursing through the crowd, a truly unforgettable tour and experience.”\n\nWhat was the feeling like when you first heard your song on the radio?\n\nAlex: “The feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is the best way to describe it. After you think of all the countless hours of practice/development, financial investment, and infrastructure that is required to get a song played on the radio, it really feels like a dream the first time you hear it on the airwaves.”\n\nWhat is your craziest stage moment?\n\nAlex: “Playing in front of the 25,000 plus crowd at KQRC’s Rockfest second stage is definitely crazy…I couldn’t see the end of the crowd, and to see a huge pit erupt info front of the stage with as insane!!!”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nAlex: “I would like to say thank you to our fans. Without them, there would be no reason for any of this. The love and respect they have for our songs and albums is what keeps us in the game… Thank You!”\n\nhttp://www.evetoadam.com\n\nToday I talked to Prathesh Prasad from the band Slap The Bull this is a very clever name be on the look out for them in either in the studio or on the road!!\n\nHow did Slap The Bull form?\n\nPrasad: “Well, Most of us knew each other in high school and we ended up in the same University. We knew what each other were capable of and we thought why not. So we got together and voila Slap The Bull.\n\nWho are influences?\n\nPrasad: “We don’t really idolize any band, but we’ve definitely picked out some brilliant artists for their particular talent like:\n\nChad Kroeger’s voice, Clive Burr’s drums of hell, or Frusciante’s solos”\n\nWhat do you have coming up?\n\nPrasad: “As of now, most of us are leaving for higher studies. So currently we are on standby. However the rest of us are forming a new line-up by filling the gaps. Can’t wait for it!”\n\nWhere do you see the band in 5 years?\n\nPrasad: “To be frank no clue! But we’ll be spreading our music as long as we can.”\n\nIs there a full album in works?\n\nPrasad: “As of now, no. But with the new line-up we’ll be definitely looking forward to making one.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nPrasad: “Its the fans who are responsible for the success of this band so far. The brilliant support and encouragement is the vital reason why we’re still growing. All we have to say is to keep supporting us and you guys are doing an amazing job!”\n\nToday I had a chance to talk to Here Lies The Hero in my opinion I love the name and the music these guys produce just saying.\n\nHow did Here Lies The Hero form?\n\nJaxon: “Chaney and I met in choir and formed several bands, the last of which ended up being Here Lies the Hero. There have been several incarnations of the band over time, but the only constants from the very beginning have been Chaney and I.”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nJaxon: “I cannot speak for the rest of the band, but I listen to ALL kinds of music. My main influences for this band’s sound are definitely bands like Saosin and Underoath. Those are my two big influences.”\n\nWould you say kinda like the Deftones?\n\nJaxon: “I love Deftones! Chino is such a talented vocalist and they have yet to come out with a disappointing album. I think all of the members are fans of the music from that point in the 90’s. 90’s metal was the best!”\n\nWhat shows you have coming up?\n\nJaxon: “We are playing at the Epicenter in San Diego this weekend on the 22nd, and then again at The Cobalt Cafe here in Los Angeles on July 18th!”\n\nIs there going to be a full length album with in the year?\n\nJaxon: “You know, I can’t say for sure, but we ARE already writing new material. I have about 6 or 7 songs that I’m feeling pretty confident about and I’m sure the other guys have ideas to mess around with as well. That would be the goal! This year would be great! We shall see.”\n\nTell me about writing the EP Adrift?\n\nJaxon: “Writing Adrift was really cool because we have 2 new members in the band now, thus there are 2 new brains and ways of thinking contributing to the sound that we have already established. The songs on Adrift came out of us pretty naturally. We don’t like to restrict ourselves as far as what the definition of a conventional song is. If we write a song that comes from our collective minds naturally with only one chorus or it happens to be 6 or 7 minutes long, then we like to keep it that way. The story behind the songs follows the concept that we started on our Carpathia EP about a couple who have to weather a symbolic (but also very literal) storm that descends upon them in the midst of a dark time in their relationship while aboard a ship called the Carpathia. This EP is more about finding your inner strength when you’ve lost something or someone dear to you. Our character has to face the emotions that come with coming to terms with a reality where you are both physically and emotionally alone as well as the physical battle of staying alive while being Adrift in the middle of an ocean. These struggles that our character is going through act as mirrors to the struggles that everyone in the band has either been through, or is going through currently, and the way we write is very therapeutic in that way.\n\nWhat is your favorite video game?\n\nJaxon: “Well I would say that the big “gamer” in the band is John, but the one series of games that I play rather religiously are the Halo games. I used to be more into video games, but Halo is all I have time for these days!”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nJaxon: “We would like to tell our fans that we are so grateful to everyone who kept their faith in us during our big move to California and continue to support us. We are so proud of this new EP and we really hope that the fans love it, too. We cannot stress enough how important your support is to this band and we can’t wait to meet each and every one of you the next time we come through your area!”\n\nToday I talked to a deathcore band from Albany NY by the name of The Alaskan. They have been in the scene for a short time but already doing shows with some huge bands be sure to look them up!!\n\nHow did The Alaskan form?\n\nBand: “Well, back in 2012, Mickey, Kyle and I were in a band called OH! Yeller, along with our original drummer Mike and our buddies Murphy and Tristan. We started to write some new material, different from what we usually played, and just felt that it made sense to make it into a whole new project. Heavier, harder hitting, and colder. ”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nBand: “I know we all grew up listening to a lot of different things. Mickey has always been into straight up hard-hitting rock, but I know Whitechapel was probably a pretty big influence on him. Kevin has a Vanna tattoo, so I’m pretty sure they were a big influence for him. Ryan definitely has a wide range of influences, nothing I can really pin down to one band or genre. He’s played every style of music from pop punk to metalcore to jazz to indie rock to beatdown, so he’s got the chops. Kyle was largely influenced by bands like I Declare War, Those Who Fear, and After the Burial in his playing, but vocally he loves Phil Bozeman from Whitechapel. As for me, The Last Ten Seconds of Life, Job for a Cowboy, and The Acacia Strain are some of the bands that have influenced me in heavy music, but Coheed and Cambria was the band that got me into playing. So yeah, we’ve got a wide range of influences when you put us all together.”\n\nWith the long list of bands you have played with who is your favorite?\n\nBand: “Well before Kevin and Ryan joined the band, we played a bunch of shows with our drummer Mike with some of our favorite bands; our favorites of which were The Acacia Strain, Oceano, I Declare War, and The Last Ten Seconds of Life. I don’t really know if we could pick a favorite.”\n\nHow do you go about your writing process?\n\nBand: “Honestly, we don’t have a set way. Usually, Kyle or I, and Mickey once in a while, come up with a riff, and builds off of that. Sometimes we come to practice with almost a full song done, and just look for suggestions, and see if it would work. Lyrically, Mickey writes all the lyrics in his handy dandy notebook, whether they come before the music or after really depends.”\n\nHow do you prepare before a show?\n\nBand: “Well, practice the set about 20 times, making sure we know what goes where. Then, when we’re actually getting ready to play a set, we prepare in different ways. Whether that’s drinking a lot of water, getting a few drinks, making sure you’ve gone to the bathroom, or holding a safety meeting. The worst thing is being completely unaware that “oh shit, we go in in 5 minutes.””\n\nWhat is your favorite horror movie of all time?\n\nBand: “Hmmm, tough question. Kyle says his is Halloween, without a doubt. Kevin is too cool for horror movies I guess, they don’t scare him. The Descent terrified the shit out of me, because I couldn’t imagine being trapped underground. Sleeves me the fuck out.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nBand: “Probably the most important thing we’d like to tell our fans is thank you. You guys realize that the only way we can do what we do is if there’s people like you to listen. Some of you play music, some of you have never picked up an instrument, but whatever you’re passionate in, you know how much it means when someone you’ve never talked to a single day in your life is wearing your shirt, coming to your shows, has your painting on their wall, or anything like that. It makes all the time spent practicing, writing, travelling, and playing worth it. Keep going to shows. Buy a CD or shirt from a local band you like instead of that dope new snapback from the mall, and maybe one day you’ll see one of those local bands headlining a massive tour, proud to call your town their hometown.”\n\nthealaskanband@gmail.com OR Ashley Ventura (Delirium Entertainment) deliriumbooking@yahoo.com\n\nthealaskanband@gmail.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thealaskanband/timeline\n\nTonight I talked to Kelly from the band Waylon Speed! They will be coming to Schmitt Saloon coming up so be on the look out for that you will not wanna miss that!!\n\nHow did Waylon Speed form?\n\nKelly: “Waylon Speed formed in 2009 at the Tuesday night Honky Tonk at the Radio Bean in Burlington VT. It’s a rotating band every week, and that week Noah was playing bass, Justin was playing drums, and I was playing tele. We hadn’t met prior, but that night it all clicked. Chad had played with Noah and Justin in their prior band, and we got him in board. We’ve been writing tunes and playing shows ever since. ”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nKelly: “The band has numerous influence from numerous genres that aren’t even portrayed in the music. Our music is pretty rocking with a touch of twang, but we get influence from everything from Meshuggah to Ray Charles, Fugazi to Rancid. ”\n\nTell me about your new album called Kin coming out June 24th?\n\nKelly: “After recording our album, Valance, in 2012 we knew we had to top it. Valance was such a great jumping off point, and gave us the motivation to write some really great and personal songs; I think they get a little more personal, and musically have a rougher edge. In the vein of stepping it up, we wound up recording Kin at the Magic Shop in Manhattan NYC with Grammy award winning engineer Brian Thorne on the board, and producer Mark Spencer of Son Volt. We recorded live and couldn’t of asked for a better record. We all believe it really portrays the band in the moment it was recorded. Alive and raw. ”\n\nHow was shooting your video?\n\nKelly: “We have been doing a really cool yearly thing in the small town of Bloomfield VT called “blasphemy in Bloomfield”. The whole town comes out to this run down church where no one minds smoking cigarettes and drinking beer in. The video was done to our song “Until it all Ends” portraying the drive to the show, the set up of the show, and the inevitable rocking of the show. We took it as a chance to show folks exactly what we do on the road, and how much we love playing songs with each other, and for people.”\n\nHow excited are you to play at Schmitt Saloon?\n\nKelly: “Super excited to play Schmitts saloon. We will be sharing the stage with Yarn, and it’s the lead up to a great fall time tour. ”\n\nHow did you develop that down home sound?\n\nKelly: “It’s pretty much just a culmination of all the music we’ve all listened to for our whole lives. I think we got lucky and fortunate that it turned out to be our own sound. ”\n\nWhat is life like on the road?\n\nKelly: “Awesome, grueling, exciting, boring, and the best thing ever. Incredibly lucky to do what we do. ”\n\nWould you rather be around a camp fire with guitar and a beer or on stage?\n\nKelly: “I think they each have their necessary places in the world of music. One needs the other. However, I think some folks could use more camp fires. ”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nKelly: “We wouldn’t be able to do what we do without people digging it. Get out to live music when you can, and get off the screen.”\n\nToday we took a stroll to a Camp and this camp was located at Crystal Lake!!\n\nHow did The Jason’s form?\n\nJason V: “The songs I had been writing on and off for about 5 years. Once we decided to actually start the band it was only a month from our first practice to the recording of our album, which we recorded basically in one day. Everything was done in like 1 or 2 takes and then we played our first show a week later. We just wanted something that would be fast, aggressive and catchy, We stayed away from all the modern production stuff like auto tune and click tracks.”\n\nWhy do you hate gimmick bands so much?\n\nJason V: “Ramones never needed a gimmick… Kiss never needed a gimmick! People say that Kiss use gimmicks but we have “Meets the Phantom of the Park” on VHS and you can clearly see them hangin’ out by the pool in their gear and paint… I mean, if the greatest bands in the world didn’t need a gimmick than neither do the Jasons… No bullshit! Just 100% red blooded american punk rock!”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nJason V: “if you were to open up the Jasons and look at our DNA under a microscope, you would see a little DNA helix made of three bands – Kiss, The Ramones, and the greatest band in the world… The Bay City Fuckin’ Rollers! Greatest band of all time!\n\nNow on the turntables back in Jersey we got stuff like The mcRackins, who were basically doin’ what we’re doin’ like 20 before us. We like Screeching Weasel, Beatnik Termites… Stuff like that. Our Drummer, Jason Hell, listens to a bunch of stuff like Venom and Mercyful Fate too… Anything with a pentagram on it… It’s all good music, but the Rollers is where it’s at!”\n\nDo you have a real life beef with The Renfields or was it just for show?\n\nJason V: “Nah… Not Really… Why, what did those Transylvanian fucks say about us? Jackasses!”\n\nWhat is life like at Crystal Lake?\n\nJason V: “it’s alright, I guess… It actually get’s pretty boring. I mean, yeah, for three months outta the year it’s all stalk and slash and tithes and mom won’t stop with the “Kill them Jason, Kill them!”… But we have three other non-summer seasons where shit is dead… I mean dead like nothin’ going on… not dead like “Oh no! My boyfriend is dead”… it’s only like that in summer.”\n\nWhat shows do you have coming up?\n\nJason V: “We’re playing Cleveland Oh on Friday, June 13th. Then we’re playing in logan WV on the 21st with our pals the Big Bad and our not-pals The Renfiends. We have some others that I can’t remember right now.”\n\nWill we be seeing a new EP this year?\n\nJason V: “Right now we’re writing songs for an EP called Stalk and Slash Summer that will have the title track, our Bay City Rollers cover of “Saturday Night” and two other songs. We’re also talking to a small label about putting first album out on vinyl, but I can’t mention which one just yet.”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nJason V: “You don’t have to go to Crystal Lake to get stalked and Slashed… The Jasons are bringing’ Crystal Lake to you! Watch your ass!”\n\nthosecrystallakepunks@gmail.com\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thejasonsband\n\nToday I talked to Michele from all the way in Italy!\n\nHow did As The Monster Becomes form?\n\nMichele: “The band now its formed by 3 guys, me ( the singer) Alessandro ( guitar) and Christian (bass)”\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nMichele: “ours influences are all deathcore band, in particular rings of saturn, veil of maya, beneath the massacre, psyopus ecc.”\n\nTell me about your EP that you released and is there a new one in the works?\n\nMichele: “Renascentia would be our renaissance, the previous ep it was a disaster, so we had to write some amazing stuff, to give to uors fans some good track ad have more visibility by the scene\n\nIn this period we have write another ep, more technical and more serious, but in italy is very hard find someone who is ready to help you, so we wait to register new stuff”\n\nWhat shows do you have coming up?\n\nMichele: “we have not shows in program, our line up is not complete, we need a drummer and a lead guitarist, but we live in a small city and there is not so many people able to play our music, we have listen a lot of guitarist, but no one is ready to play….. for the drummer problem, there is not physically the person able to play”\n\nHow do you think your fan base is in the states?\n\nMichele: “ours fans are amazing, after the digital release of Renascentia we had a lot of person who appreciate our work, lots of reviews, downloads, compliment and like on the facebook page.”\n\nHas your sound changed any since first forming?\n\nMichele: “the first ep called the perfect storm, is really different to ours new sound, it was a deathcore sweedcore, now we try to play only technical stuff”\n\nWhat would you like to tell your fans?\n\nMichele: “we hope to give to ours fans a message of freedom, to think for themselves, to have no masters, a lot of songs are critics about church and cristianity in general,because in italy cristianity is strongly radicated, and this is fucking wrong FUCK! We have no problem with persons who trust in god, but we do not appreciate the operate of the church”\n\nhttp://asthemonsterbecomes.bandcamp.com/album/renascentia\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?5eodyq9zks528m2"
