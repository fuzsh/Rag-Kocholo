        "text": "The Alpha of Oklahoma Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa annually recognizes outstanding undergraduates by inviting them to membership in Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nThere is no application process for Phi Beta Kappa. Apart from a very small number of juniors, only those students who are graduating seniors in the College of Arts & Sciences, College of Atmospheric & Geographic Sciences, College of International Studies, Gaylord College of Journalism & Mass Communication, and ConocoPhillips School of Geology & Geophysics who have a 3.60 GPA or better and who have applied for graduation are considered for membership. A chapter committee reviews the academic records of each student, focusing on the quality and distribution of coursework and the breadth of academic experience in the social sciences, humanities, language, mathematics, and natural science.\n\nEach year in early April the final selected students are invited to chapter membership. Summer and December graduates are considered for membership in the spring semester along with the spring graduates. See Bylaws, Section III, Election and Admission of New Members."
