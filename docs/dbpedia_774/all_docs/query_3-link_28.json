        "text": "Major: History\n\nMinor: Music\n\nGraduation: April 2021\n\nI am from Huntington Beach, CA and spent most of my formative years surfing. Due to the lack of waves in Provo, UT, I find myself at the skatepark more frequently. I am obsessed with choral singing -- probably too much honestly. I am in BYU Singers and employed as a cantor at the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City. I also play the trombone in BYU jazz groups and in an alt-punk-jazz-rock band. I really like school and hearing smart people's ideas, which is why Honors is so fun.\n\nWhat's the best-kept secret at BYU? Why?\n\nThe HFAC student music pass. It's available to all students, its 30 bucks, and gets you two tickets to every School of Music event for the whole year. It's like a roc pass but a quarter of the price, your team always wins, and it's the easiest date you've ever been on. People think you're really classy when you take them to the Philharmonic.\n\nWhy did you decide to join the Honors Program?\n\nI joined the Honors Program to do the Cambridge Program. I was a junior when I heard about Cambridge program and it was run by the Honors Program. I came to the office and they told me about becoming an Honors student. Rihanna's \"Where Have You Been?\" ran through my head as I learned about it. Even though I had already finished my GE's, I signed up and did the whole program, because it's awesome.\n\nWhat has been your favorite part of your Honors Experience?\n\nMy favorite part of the Honors Program was easily the Cambridge Program. Being with other driven students from BYU in that beautiful place with very smart people was the raddest experience of my life!"
