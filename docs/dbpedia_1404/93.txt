EXCLUSIVE: ABC is adding to its collection of game shows.

The network has picked up Lucky 13, which will be hosted by Shaquille O’Neal and Gina Rodriguez and is exec produced by Kevin Bacon.

The series is produced by Studio 1, the company run by Adrian Woolfe, who was part of the original creative team that developed Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.

It tests contestants’ knowledge with 13 true-or-false trivia questions but with a twist: Just how well do they know what they know … and, just as importantly, how well do they know what they don’t know? If they can accurately predict how successfully they’ve answered 13 questions, they could take home a $1M cash jackpot.

Woolfe created the show and will serve as showrunner. It is expected to start filming next month.

Bacon exec produces alongside Mark Wells, Glenn Coomber, Aaron Stone, Alastair Burlingham, Gary Raskin, David Schiff, Scott Henry and GW Wright. O’Neal wil exec produce alongside Colin Smeeton and Michael Parris serving for his Jersey Legends Productions, while Gina Rodriguez will exec produce via her I Can & I Will Productions.

The series will premiere this summer on the Disney-owned network, which is expected to unveil its summer schedule shortly.
