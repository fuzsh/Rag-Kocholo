        "text": "No trip to Los Angeles is complete without a bit of Hollywood show business on your itinerary. Luckily, there are multiple opportunities to see a taping of your favorite television shows live to get a sneak peek of the TV magic you see at home. Plus, good news: tickets to the majority of shows are free.\n\nWatch the casts of The Conners crack up the audience, be amazed by incredibly smart people on Jeopardy!, or laugh along with witty talk show hosts like Jimmy Kimmel or car karaoke star James Corden on The Late Late Show. If competition shows are more your style, try scoring tickets to The Voice or Dancing With the Stars, which both film in the Los Angeles area. Participating on a game show (like Wheel of Fortune) is feasible but typically involves a test or video submission in advance, so check the rules before planning your trip.\n\nBeing in the audience during a taping gives you a behind-the-scenes glimpse of how these shows are actually produced while providing a look at your favorite stars up close and personalâsomething thatâs on every L.A. visitorâs bucket list. Each show has a specific ticket system that sometimes involves a wait listâor waiting in personâso be sure to plan far in advance and anticipate lines so you donât miss your opportunity.\n\nBe sure to get there early if you want a good seat (or any seat at all, as studios overbook the tickets), and expect to stay at least three hours, especially for sitcoms, which can take a long time as scenes get reworked and reshot. If youâre hoping for an on-camera appearance, do your homework ahead of time. What types of things is the show looking for? It might be a silly costume for a game show like Letâs Make a Deal, or it might be well-dressed people for a cameo appearance in a talk show. Also, be enthusiastic: employees sometimes tap the most eager audience members to be part of the show.\n\nBetween tapingsâmost take place in Burbankâfill your TV-loving vacation with studio tours at Warner Brothers and Universal Studios Hollywood, and visits to nearby L.A. neighborhoods that are pop culture staples in themselves. Weâve got tips on amazing things to do in Hollywood, as well as the celebrity-friendly communities Santa Monica, Venice Beach, West Hollywood, and the inimitable Beverly Hills.\n\nCheck out Discover Los Angeles' guide on how to attend live tapings for even more info.\n\nTalk Shows & Competitions\n\nLaugh and hear remarkable stories from guests with Jennifer Hudson on The Jennifer Hudson Show. See what movie stars are talking about on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Watch political wags and celebrities go toe-to-toe on Real Time With Bill Maher. And, as mentioned, on the grounds of Universal Studios Hollywood and adjacent Universal CityWalk, attend a taping to see Extraâs Billy Bush chat with celebs like Chris Evans and Demi Lovato.\n\nTalk shows are a great way to see A-listers in personâusually dressed in on-trend fashions and perfectly coiffed. Another perk from sitting in the audience: you might get on TV too, since many talk shows include shots of the audience, or even pull one or two folks into the show for a gag or two. Glossy whoâs-best shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent also let you see talentâsome good, some badâas well as A-list judges and performers.\n\nSome shows distribute their own tickets via their websites; others use ticket agencies, such as 1iota. You may even get paid a stipend to be in the audience for shows like Safeword or Food Network Star.\n\nGame Shows\n\nMatch wits with the contestants on Jeopardy! Spin the wheel with Vanna and Pat on Wheel of Fortune. Bring out your pom-poms and pork pie hats for Letâs Make a Deal. These game shows and other classics are mainstays in Los Angeles; most have been running for decades. Want to be a contestant? For some shows, that just means reserving a free ticket online and getting a callback to attend (then syncing up vacation plans), then crossing fingers that youâll get picked from the audience. For some shows, itâs a little tougher to make the cut. For Jeopardy!, youâve got to prove your prowess by passing a 50-question test either online or at a regional in-person screening. Wheel of Fortune asks for a video submission.\n\nIf you simply want to sit in the audience for popular game shows like Wheel of Fortune, The Price is Right, or Family Feud, check out On-Camera Audiences. Just keep in mind that show tapings are often overbooked, so a ticket is not always a guaranteed seat (show up a little early to keep your odds high). Most game shows require that audience members be at least 18, but both Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! welcome audience members as young as 8.\n\nSitcoms\n\nCrack up at the hilarious extended-family dynamics of The Upshaws, or watch the antics of the cast of Lopez vs Lopez as the show is being filmed. Sitting in the audience while these and other sitcoms are staged gives you an incomparable behind-the-scenes take of all that goes into producing a professional comedy show. While familiar shows are a big draw and usually a good bet for a great show, donât hesitate to take a chance on a pilot or a new show; you might wind up seeing the birth of the next hit sitcom or TV star.\n\nThe main resources for getting tickets are On Camera Audiences and 1Iota; their websites list TV shows offering tickets within the next 30 days at studios in the Los Angeles area. There are other sites, too, such as Shadow Casting, and OS | LA Productions. If you donât score tickets when they are first released, additional and standby tickets may be released at a later date. Keep in mind, too, that the age minimum for most sitcom tapings is 18, and that tapings often last well beyond a half hourâoften four hoursâbut itâs fun to watch the studio at work. And pack a sweater: studios are kept a little on the chilly side.\n\nInsider Tips\n\nAttending a TV show taping is a blast, but there are a few tips you can follow to make sure itâs memorableâand only in a good way.\n\n1) Be sure to get there early if you want a good seat (or any seat at all, as studios overbook the tickets).\n\n2) Expect to stay at least three hours, especially for sitcoms, which can take a long time as scenes get reworked and reshot. Bring a snack and a book for downtime. (At longer tapings, audience members might be treated to pizza, but donât count on it.)\n\n3) Bring a sweater; studios are kept notoriously cool to compensate for the hot lights on stage.\n\nIf youâre hoping for an on-camera appearance, do your homework ahead of time. What types of things is the show looking for? It might be a silly costume for a game show like Letâs Make a Deal, or it might be well-dressed people for a cameo appearance in a talk show. Also, be enthusiastic: employees sometimes tap the most eager audience members to be part of the show."
