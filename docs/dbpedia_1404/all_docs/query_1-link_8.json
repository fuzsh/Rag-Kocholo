        "text": "Players work together to answer questions with the goal of collecting a gigantic cash prize. Over $12 million is on the line each night and up to $3 million on a single electrifying drop.\n\nIt works like this: When a question is answered correctly, a green ball falls down the four-story wall and more cash is added to the slot players' winning total, called the bank. If a question is answered incorrectly, a red ball drops and the value is deducted from the team’s bank.\n\nBecause Contestants compete in pairs, they must trust their loved ones to make the right decisions to rack up more earnings. In the end, teams are offered a contract that can dramatically impact their payout. Signing the contract forfeits the team’s bank in favor of a lower yet guaranteed payout equal to the Free Fall winnings and $20,000 for each question answered correctly in Rounds 2 and 3.\n\nThis season, two lucky players banked and then played for $2.8 million, the largest amount in the history of the series.\n\nAs with every season, some The Wall contestants include a welcomed mix of folks committed to claiming the show's grand prizes. Season 5 features a retired Army Staff Sergeant who lost part of four limbs during his third tour abroad, a Capitol Police officer who saved a congressman’s life, a retired public transportation supervisor who saved a man from an oncoming train, and a young couple who has cleaned up over 100,000 pounds of trash from their community. You never know which Contestant will take on The Wall next.\n\nThink you've got what it takes to conquer The Wall as a Contestant? Go for it! Applying to become a Contestant is simple, you'll just need to visit The Wall's casting website to apply. Interested Contestants on The Wall will need to provide their credentials as well as details about which teammate and fellow Contestant will be joining them. Contestants will also highlight why they'd like to become a Contestant on The Wall, how long they've watched the show, their trivia background, and explore what led them to shoot for the million-dollar prizes.\n\nNBA legend LeBron James and his business partner, Maverick Carter, serve as executive producers for The Wall. The series is a collaboration between Hardwick and executive producers James, Carter, Andrew Glassman, SpringHill Entertainment, and Glassman Media.\n\n“When we started The Wall we wanted to create something that would get families excited and change peoples’ lives. Maverick and I couldn’t be more proud of the show’s early success and we want to keep building on that,” James told WFMJ. “I want to thank NBC for their partnership, Andrew Glassman for his vision, and all the fans for their support.”\n\n“We have been in pursuit of a brand new high-stakes game show for a while and are so happy to have developed it with LeBron James,” Meredith Ahr, President of Universal Television Alternative Studio, said. “Every time a player releases a green or red ball, the tension is palpable because each drop can affect the Contestant’s life in the most extraordinary way and that makes for great television.”\n\nThat honor of accumulating the most funds this season goes to John and Toni from Episode 5. In the episode, the Bank reached a series high of $2.9 million in Round 3. John hit the Million-Dollar Bin twice, the only time this season. (There were big reactions from John, Chris, and the family members in the VIP section.) The Final Bank was at $2.6 million, but ultimately, they signed the contract and went home with $230,000. Season 5 Contestants Christiana and Nic Trapani were also big champions on The Wall, taking home upwards of $1.6 million during Season 5's premiere after rejecting the contract."
