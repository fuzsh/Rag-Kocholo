        "text": "This game is great to play with friends and family of all ages. I love thÃ© diverse range of categories, and theyâre all free (some need coins that are earned during the game to unlock). There are tons of cards in each deck, so you can definitely play the same deck multiple times. You can change the settings, select favorites, and even create a custom deck!! One thing that I wish would change is that when youâre making your custom deck, you canât go back and edit a card that you made after you add it to the deck. This gets frustrating as sometimes I donât see a typo that I made before I pressed the button. So if youâre thinking about making a custom deck, just be aware that you canât go back and edit the cards once youâve added them. Other than that, this is a great game overall and would definitely recommend!\n\nThis game is great, works fine, does what itâs supposed to. Super fun to play with friends and family. Anywhere from 2 people to 10 or more! No specific way that you have to play either. But I like to create my own custom categories, because I wanna do this with other stuff. But I hate that when you do that you canât edit the name, if thereâs a typo or if you just want to change the name. Same with the cards, if you add a card with a typo, or you donât like, you canât delete them or edit them. There is a delete button to delete the cards, but if you click on it tells you to select an item to delete, but you canât select the cards. Other than that, the game is pretty great, so just be careful when you name your categories, and make your cards to go in them.\n\nOk so I LOVE this game its really cool and theres no need to pay for anything cuz the categories cost coins you earn from playing the free categories I've been playing for a while and its really worth getting cuz its free and the way I deal with the ads is putting my phone on airplane mode cuz it still works without wifi and you cant get ads if you don't have wifi, BUT I do want to add some suggestions like I would love this game SO much more if it recorded like the heads up app does like the heads up app records during game and shows what the card is and its super cool so if anything thats the only flaw I really even see in the game but itâs not much of a flaw so please developers add that little extra think/detail to the game! ð"
