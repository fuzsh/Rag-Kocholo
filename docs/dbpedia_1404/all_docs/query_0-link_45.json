        "text": "Much has been said about perceived parallels between this yearâs Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the 1968 convention, hallmarked by a violent response to anti-Vietnam War protestors and an incumbent who announced he would not seek reelection. Few are as qualified to speak on those comparison as Don Rose, a Chicago journalist, political strategist, and activist who was a leader in organizing the â68 protests. He joined David to talk about 1968 and today, how protests against the war in Gaza could affect the DNC, how focusing on abortion issues may have helped Vice President Kamala Harrisâ rise,Â and his surpriseâand delightâat her selection of Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This week, Audie joined David to talk about her own history: growing up in the âmessy follow-up of integrationâ in Boston schools, being raised by immigrant parents, and unexpectedly finding herself on the path to journalism. Audie and David also discussed the state of American politics, how Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting the moment as a presidential candidate, and Audie's CNN podcast, âThe Assignment.â\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

After 10 years as a Navy SEALâincluding sustaining injuries in an IED explosion that left him with one eyeâhe was medically retired and turned his attention to serving the country as a legislator. As a Texas Republican, Crenshaw remains staunchly conservative, although heâs not shy about calling out the more fringe elements of his party. Rep. Crenshaw joined David to talk about losing his mother at a young age, the need for tougher immigration laws, the importance of aiding Ukraine, his disdain for Tucker Carlson, and the importance of voting in primaries.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Vance didnât start out a Trump fan. Once a harsh Trump critic, he slowly transitioned to all-out supporter. Sen. Vance spoke with David in 2017 about his life and bestselling book âHillbilly Elegy,â what it was that attracted working class voters to President Trump, and his political opinions on the social and economic difficulties facing everyday Americans.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Now, heâs questioning whether Biden should stay in the race. He joined David to talk about voters feeling âgaslitâ by the Biden campaign and White House, poll denialism, why a stellar convention performance by Biden and his supporters wonât move the needle, and the allure of the demagogue and need for citizens to reengage in democracy.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But for her latest book she focused on a different sort of subject: her husband, the late political adviser Dick Goodwin. Part memoir, part history, âAn Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960sâ tells the story of the decade through more than 300 boxes of Dickâs archives. Doris joined David to talk about the book, the parallels between the 1960s and today, the state of American democracy, and what can be learned about the present by looking to the past.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
