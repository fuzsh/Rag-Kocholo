        "text": "It is upsetting me tremendously to miss my little news because you and Direct Tv can't get your act together. This is ridiculous every couple of years of that start haggling again. Why is it nobody else but CBS does this? Is it greed or what. for god sake's either teach Nora O'Donnell how to say 100 or get her off the news I'm so sick of hearing her side 1hunerdt. it's one thing for a light person to say that it's a whole Nother person an issue for someone who's being paid top dollar on the biggest newscast in the nation not be able to pronounce 100 properly! I can't stand her only use anyway she's to arrogant and I'm a woman. She's just haughty as we would say in the south!\n\nIt's always jarring to have some notification pop up on your screen in the middle of something you're doing â interrupting you, startling you, forcing you out of what you were doing to deal with whatever message has frozen your whole system to make itself known. For users of Apple devices, this jolting horror is an everyday occurrence, usually happening multiple times a day. \"Space is low\", \"new iOS ready for you\", whatever. It never is something urgent enough to have to deal with right away, but it has to be dealt with right away because it just interrupted you out of the flow and enjoyment of whatever you were doing. That's the price for using any Apple device.\n\nBut just imagine â instead of saying \"Space is low\", the message says \"FATAL ERROR. You have exceeded the maximum number of video streams.\" Fatal? In the middle of an app purely designed for entertainment ? Because if you're using the CBS app, that's what you're watching it for.\n\nIn the middle of am excellent episode of \"Bull\", right at the most dramatic and touching moments, I was interrupted FOUR TIMES with the \"FATAL UPDATE\" message, freezing the show and forcing me to back out and simply hit play again. Fatal?? Not so much. Infuriating?? You bet!!\n\nAnd BTW, I was interrupted while writing this review with \"Software Update - New iOS ready\", freezing me yet again for maybe the 10th time today.\n\nCBS and Apple. What a winning combination!!!!\n\nWorst streaming app Iâve ever had. You spend 40 min watching a show and get a fatal error before the end of the show. Missing out on the end of every show every time I use the app. I send an email describing the problem only to get told toâ¦get thisâ¦force close the app and reboot. As of I didnât try that 263 times myself. Then I get told to call an 800 number, which is to Paramount Plus. Not CBS. Therefore, they canât help fix any fatal errors. So basically, you have to live with watching a show only to get fatal errors before the end with no resolution or ways to fix it. (And no itâs not my brand new iPhone 13 Pro Max not my perfectly running and setup cable service. App is up to date). Doesnât happen with any other streaming service or app. App has obvious bugs they know about but wonât fix.\n\nUpdate: Dear developer, fix the bugs in your app instead of sending the same form email to users having trouble. If all these people are having the same issue, logic should tell you that itâs YOU! Your app! Not the users. Sending the same email asking people to force close, turn on location services and reboot isnât going to fix your buggy app."
