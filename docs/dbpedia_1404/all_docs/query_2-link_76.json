        "text": "Healthcare\n\nHigh potential use case: Data-based diagnostic support\n\nAI-powered diagnostics use the patient’s unique history as a baseline against which small deviations flag a possible health condition in need of further investigation and treatment. AI is initially likely to be adopted as an aid, rather than replacement, for human physicians. It will augment physicians’ diagnoses, but in the process also provide valuable insights for the AI to learn continuously and improve. This continuous interaction between human physicians and the AI-powered diagnostics will enhance the accuracy of the systems and, over time, provide enough confidence for humans to delegate the task entirely to the AI system to operate autonomously.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nIt would be necessary to address concerns over the privacy and protection of sensitive health data. The complexity of human biology and the need for further technological development also mean than some of the more advanced applications may take time to reach their potential and gain acceptance from patients, healthcare providers and regulators.\n\nAutomotive\n\nHigh potential use case: Autonomous fleets for ride sharing\n\nAutonomous fleets would enable travellers to access the vehicle they need at that point, rather than having to make do with what they have or pay for insurance and maintenance on a car that sits in the drive for much of the time. Most of the necessary data is available and technology is advancing. However, businesses still need to win consumer trust.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nTechnology still needs development – having an autonomous vehicle perform safely under extreme weather conditions might prove more challenging. Even if the technology is in place, it would need to gain consumer trust and regulatory acceptance.\n\nFinancial services\n\nHigh potential use case: Personalised financial planning\n\nWhile human financial advice is costly and time consuming, AI developments such as robo-advice have made it possible to develop customised investment solutions for mass market consumers in ways that would, until recently, only have been available to high net worth (HNW) clients. Finances are managed dynamically to match goals (e.g. saving for a mortgage) and optimise client’s available funds, as asset managers become augmented and, in some cases, replaced by AI. The technology and data is in place, though customer acceptance would still need to increase to realise the full potential.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nConsumer trust and regulatory acceptance.\n\nRetail and consumer\n\nHigh potential use case: Personalised design and production\n\nInstead of being produced uniformly, apparels and consumables can be tailored on demand. If we look at fashion and clothing as an example, we could eventually move to fully interactive and customised design and supply in which AI created mock-ups of garments are sold online, made in small batches using automated production, and subsequent changes are made to design based on user feedback.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nAdapting design and production to this more agile and tailored approach. Businesses also need to strengthen trust over data usage and protection.\n\nTechnology, communications and entertainment\n\nHigh potential use case: Media archiving and search\n\nWe already have personalised content recommendation within the entertainment sector. Yet there is now so much existing and newly generated (e.g. online video) content that it can be difficult to tag, recommend and monetise. AI offers more efficient options for classification and archiving of this huge vault of assets, paving the way for more precise targeting and increased revenue generation.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nCutting through the noise when there is so much data, much of it unstructured.\n\nManufacturing\n\nHigh potential use case: Enhanced monitoring and auto-correction\n\nSelf-learning monitoring makes the manufacturing process more predictable and controllable, reducing costly delays, defects or deviation from product specifications. There is huge amount of data available right through the manufacturing process, which allows for intelligent monitoring.\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nMaking the most of supply chain and production opportunities requires all parties to have the necessary technology and be ready to collaborate. Only the biggest and best-resourced suppliers and manufacturers are up to speed at present."
