The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. The questions were written in advance by the producers. Certain kinds of questions such as name, age, occupation, and income were not permitted to be asked. The process continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. After making her choice, the bachelorette met the two unchosen bachelors before meeting the chosen one. When all said and done, the dating couple went out on a dream vacation which was paid by the producers. Occasionally, the bachelor would ask questions to three bachelorettes.\n\n1990s version[]\n\nFor this revival's first season, two formats were used.\n\nThe basic format for this show, used throughout the first year, was for the bachelor/bachelorette to pick from two facts about the three potential dates. Once it was picked, the person in question would reveal the reason behind the fact to the hopeful single. After a round of questioning, the bachelor/bachelorette chose their date. All three of the potential dates had their names revealed before the questioning started as well, something that wasn't done on any version of TDG prior.\n\nDuring a part of the first season, in addition to asking the questions, the bachelor/bachelorette got to see all three contestants at the outset of the game (who all had headphones on so they couldn't hear what their potential date was saying about them), and would pick who they thought was the best looking of the bunch. After that, the question round was conducted in its usual fashion, with the bachelor/bachelorette picking who they thought had the best personality out of the three. After the choices were made, the contestant was then prompted to choose between their choice for best looking or best personality. Sometimes the guy chosen would be the one chosen for both looks & personality; in later shows when that happened he/she won a $500 bonus in addition to the trip.\n\nThis format was mostly disliked by fans of the original show so the next year they switched back to its original format and theme with new host Chuck Woolery at the helm (although now the game featured bachelors questioning bachelorettes more often than the original version).\n\nCelebrity Version[]\n\nPlays like the original version with two celebrities whom each pick one lucky suitor from a hidden panel of three bachelors/bachelorettes. But the twist here is that the celebrities identity remains hidden in plain sight to their potential suitors who are given clues by hilarious song parodies being performed by Bolton.\n\nPilots[]\n\nGSN[]\n\nIn 2008, according to an article from The Hollywood Reporter[1]the network has taped comediennes Kim Coles (who previously hosted Pay it Off for BET) and Judy Gold respectively to host pilots of this show along with its sister show The Newlywed Game even though for this show they already had a female host with Elaine Joyce in 1986 until 1987 as they would incorporate modern elements like online dating sites. Michael Davies would executive produce both shows through his overall deal at Sony Pictures Television. However, this never came to fruition.\n\nCBS[]\n\nIn 2009, a pilot[2]was taped for the network in order to replace the now-cancelled, long-running soap opera Guiding Light hosted by Paige Davis of Trading Spaces fame as a companion to either The Joker's Wild, The $1,000,000 Pyramid or Let's Make a Deal hosted by Wayne Brady but has lost in the process.\n\nCelebrities[]\n\nMany celebrities appeared on the show over the years; here are a few of them:\n\nAdam West – 1966\n\nPeter Duel - 1966\n\nJeremy Clyde – 1966 (of Chad and Jeremy fame)\n\nMichael Richards - 1967\n\nDanny Bonaduce – 1972\n\nKathryn Minner, \"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\" – 1966\n\nKathy Garver – 1966; December 31, 1970 and January 1, 1971\n\nSally Field and Robert Vaughn – 1966\n\nJohn Ritter – 1967\n\nGroucho Marx – 1967 (as a prank on his daughter Melinda, who was Bachelorette #1)\n\nDonna Loren – 1967\n\nPaul Lynde – 1968\n\nRichard Dawson – 1968\n\nBill Bixby – 1968 (he appeared on the show four times and was never selected)\n\nDeep Purple – 1968\n\nSteve Martin – 1968 & 1970\n\nMcLean Stevenson – 1968\n\nStrawberry Alarm Clock – 1968 (Drummer Randy Seol appears as one of the three eligible bachelors and is chosen)\n\nJackson Bostwick – 1968\n\nJoanna Cameron – Late 1960s\n\nFarrah Fawcett – 1969\n\nIron Butterfly – 1969 (Bassist Lee Dorman appears as one of the eligible bachelors and is chosen)\n\nThe Carpenters – July 1970\n\nAnn B.
