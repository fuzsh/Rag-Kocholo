        "text": "Charles Matos\n\nSince joining LAND in 2019, Charles Matos has become a favorite for art lovers all over the globe. His stylized drawings and paintings, created with an economy of line and color , depict a likable cast of characters engaged in light-hearted hobbies. Charles’s work evokes a particular nostalgia that brings the viewer back to a simpler time in cartoon history. While tipping his hat to the influences of Warner Brothers, his drawings are all his own. He considers it his job to spread the news that “art is for everyone and no one should be left out.” At LAND you can find him drinking his coffee, doing a jig to his favorite song while socializing with peers and visitors.\n\nCharles answered a few questions about his process.\n\n1) How long have you been making art?\n\nI started making art in childhood. I drew cartoons like The Flintstones and Scooby Doo. Drawing makes me happy.\n\n2) What’s your favorite thing to do at LAND?\n\nI like drawing and painting and being funny.\n\nI start my day with a hot cup of coffee and greet people as they come in.\n\n3) What type of art do you like to make?\n\nI enjoy making classic characters and people. Drawing happy faces and people joining hands like The Super Friends on DC Comics.\n\n4) What is your favorite Food and Drink?\n\nAll kinds of them … fruits and pizza and Spanish food rice.\n\n5) What advice would you give artists starting out?\n\nI would say, forgive and forget and be happy, never curse, never! Not in a million years pal."
