Some TV taping tickets can be a bit slow and tedious to get.\n\nTV Show Taping Schedules:\n\nShort Window Shows\n\nSome TV shows come into New York City to tape a lot of shows in a very short time. They book a TV studio and shoot a large amount of shows in a small time window to minimize their studio costs. Sometimes they can shoot 25 shows in one week. They may not return to NYC to tape again for several weeks. These types of shows are usually where the subject is not time sensitive or newsworthy, IE court shows, chef shows and game shows.\n\nDaily Taping Shows\n\nOther TV shows may tape every day and the show may be broadcast soon after taping, if not live. These TV shows maintain a permanent TV studio in the city. These shows have feature news, interviews, weather forecasts and special-interest stories. Late night talk shows, daytime talk shows and morning shows fit into this category.\n\nBoth types of these TV shows have free tickets which are available to the general public.\n\nSome TV Shows Pay The Audience to Attend\n\nSome of the short-window TV shows want to get a a reliable audience for a whole day of taping during a single day shoot. They will often pay audience members to attend these types of shows. The non-union pay rate is about $15/hour. The gig can last for up to 8 hours. Food and drinks are provided.\n\nFree Ticket Availability\n\nSome of the free TV show tapings tickets can be hard to get, while other TV show tickets are abundant and are available most days of the week.
