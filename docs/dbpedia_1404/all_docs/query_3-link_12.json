This week's studio shot has been submitted by MusicRadar reader Joshua Lutz.\n\nTell us a little about your studio set-up? What do you love about it?\n\n\"After two years of working around the clock to build my home studio, itâ€™s finished. My dad and I floated the control and live room in my basement and even ran tielines throughout. I started with just a couple pieces of high end gear, a Neve 1272 from an old console and a Neumann U87. I flipped them for a little more than I paid and bought some other gear which I flipped for a little more than I paid, and just kept flipping my way up and saved from audio gigs until I have the collection I have now.\"\n\nTell us a little about your musical background and the music that you make in your studio?\n\n\"I was an Assistant Engineer at Electric Lady Studios for two years after graduating from the Conservatory Of Recording Arts and Sciences. I'm a multi-instrumentalist, I play over 35 instruments and am a visual designer as well.\"\n\nWhat's your favourite piece of gear in your studio and why?\n\n\"The Altec 436C pair cause it is, to me and many other engineers, the very best vari-mu compressor ever made. It's instant Beatles on everything. Great for tracking, mixing, mastering and 2-bus.\"\n\nWhat was the first bit of gear you ever owned?\n\n\"Tascam Portastudio 424MKII and a Shure SM58. I made hundreds of songs on it until I upgraded to a Roland VS880!\"\n\nWhat dream piece of gear would you love to own if money was no object?\n\n\"A Fairchild 670 or a Oberheim FVS-1.\"\n\nListen to Joshua Lutz's track Yasmin below.\n\nJoshua's gear list\n\nNeve 33609C\n\nUA LA-2A\n\nAltec 436C pair\n\nAltec 1591A\n\nRetroGrade Stereo Federal Compressor\n\nUniversal Audio 6176\n\nHairball Audio 1776 Blue Stripe\n\nCBS Audimax pair\n\nDemeter VTCL-2\n\nGates Dynamote\n\nBinson Echorec, 2\n\nTelefunken V672 racked pair\n\nNeve V racked channel strip\n\nNeve 1073\n\nAPI 512C\n\nQuad Eight racked pair\n\nNeotek Racked pair\n\nBEAG Racked pair\n\nStuder racked pair\n\nEventide DSP4000\n\nDistressor EL8X Pair\n\nStam SA4000\n\nChandler Limited TG1\n\ndBX 160\n\nDolby 361 w/ Vocal Stressor mod\n\nApollo X16\n\nYamaha NS-10 pair\n\nEnsoniq DP/4\n\nRoger Meyer Gates pair\n\nNeumann Racked Danner EQ pair\n\nDangerous Bax EQ\n\nMoog Ladder\n\nRoland RE-301\n\nMagnecorder Custom Pre\n\nLexicon PCM90\n\nTubetech LCB-2"
