I took it and explored from there, eventually playing so much on my computer I decided to look for the app for my tablet.\n\nI started out with the paid version because Iâd already played enough to know it was worth it for me. I love how many options there are and that I can pick and choose where to focus, when to add more, when to review, and whether to be in the learn mode or the quiz mode. Iâve made great progress in learning all the countries in the world. Iâm working on capitals and states/provinces/regions as well as predominant physical features. Itâs really made me notice how frequently places are mentioned in the news or in stories or just in passing. I donât know that itâs much hurt my comprehension to not know exactly where the place being mentioned was, or what surrounded it, but it has added depth and context to my understanding now that I do know where things are happening and how those places relate to nearby or distant places where other things are happening. Great app!\n\nNot sure how often it updates, and I do find it odd that the free version I was playing on my computer has at least one quiz (identify the US states by shape) that does not appear in the paid for version. I would have thought theyâd be the same, or that the paid version would offer more options if there was a difference. Thatâs my only negative thus far.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThanksi! The app is now updated to incude all games on the website, including the US States outline game.\n\ncello324 ,\n\nGreat app, just one thing\n\nFirst off, this app is great and has helped me reach my goal of memorizing where every country is on the map as well as to identify every countryâs flag.\n\nThe only thing that I feel could be improved is the variety of ways in which the knowledge of countriesâ location/flags is assessed. Currently, a countryâs name pops up and you have to locate it on the map or locate its flag out of a grid of many flags. However, due to the process of elimination, I feel that this method of learning the countriesâ location and flag does not necessarily guarantee mastery. In order to truly know any given countryâs location and flag, one must be able to name the country from memory when given either its location on a map or a flag. Thus, this issue could be resolved by adding a feature in which users may type out a countryâs name from a highlighted country on a map or type out a countryâs name after being shown its flag. I feel that this process of learning, focused on production from memory, requires a different mindset than the current recognition method employed by the app. While I do not believe that the current method of assessment should be removed, the addition of another way to test oneâs knowledge of countriesâ flags and locations (typing out the countryâs name given its flag/location) would be very beneficial and greatly appreciated among the users of your app.\n\nThank you so much!"
