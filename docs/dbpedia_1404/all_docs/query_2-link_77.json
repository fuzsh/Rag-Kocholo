        "text": "What are widgets?\n\nWidgets are small cards that display dynamic content from your favorite apps and services on your Windows desktop. They appear on the widgets board, where you can discover, pin, unpin, arrange, resize, and customize widgets to reflect your interests. Your widgets board is optimized to show relevant widgets and personalized content based on your usage.\n\nOpen the widgets board from the left corner of your taskbar where you see the live weather icon. Widgets help you stay on top of what’s important to you by bringing together personalized content from your favorite apps and services so you can have the latest info at a glance throughout your day. Say goodbye to constantly switching between apps, devices and websites—now you can stay connected to the things you care about without losing focus on your most important tasks.\n\nEach widget is powered by a different app or service. To see what is powering a widget, select More Options (…) in the upper-right corner of the widget, and look for the “Powered by” message at the bottom of the menu. Each individual widget is an extension of its corresponding app or service and is controlled by the settings for that app or service. This means the way to change your privacy settings for a widget is to change them for the app or service that powers that widget.\n\nNote: Some apps or services that power your widgets might tailor content based on your location estimation to provide you with the most contextually relevant experience. Location estimation can come from the Windows Location service if enabled, otherwise it may fall back on using the IP address of your internet connection.\n\nWhat data does Microsoft collect?\n\nThe widgets board is a personalized experience, powered by Microsoft Start, that shows you the most relevant widgets and content based on your usage. To access and manage the data associated with your Microsoft account and used to personalize the widgets board, go to the Microsoft privacy dashboard. Or, to stop the collection of this data, you can sign out of the widgets board.\n\nWindows diagnostic data is collected from the widgets board and is determined by the diagnostic data settings you choose in the Windows Settings app. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows. Individual widgets might also collect data. To learn more about what data is collected by a widget, see the information provided for the app or service that powers the widget.\n\nPersonalizing news and interests in your feed\n\nYour feed—the stream of widgets and news content shown on your widgets board—will become more personalized over time. To get started, tell us what you care about by selecting Manage interests in the Widget settings dialog box. This will open the My Interests page in Microsoft Edge.\n\nFrom the My Interests page, you can:\n\nIf you need help choosing which publishers and content you prefer, select Tune your feed on the left side of the My Interests page to be guided through the steps to set up your news feed.\n\nNote: The ability to follow publishers and tune your feed is currently only available for English speakers in the US.\n\nYou can also fine-tune your feed from within an individual news story. Here’s how:\n\nSelect the Hide this story (X) button in the upper-right corner of the article to remove the article. You can then provide feedback that you are not interested in the story, you don't like the source, or that you want to report an issue.\n\nSelect the See more (...) button in the lower-right corner of a news story and choose either More stories like this or Fewer stories like this to see more or what you care about or less of what you don't. You can also choose to hide stories from the story's publisher.\n\nTo view and manage the publishers and interests you follow, select the Followed interests and Followed Publishers sections in the left side of the My Interests page.\n\nTo view and manage your hidden publishers, select Hidden Publishers on the left side of the My Interests page.\n\nUpdated content will appear in your feed when there is new content to show that meets your personalization settings. Your feed learns about you over time, so you might not always see changes right away.\n\nSigning in to Windows 11 and Microsoft Edge with the same Microsoft account will help ensure your news feed personalization is available across Widgets, apps, and devices."
