        "text": "00:21\n\n\"Goddess of Victory: NIKKE\" in Tokyo Tower.\n\n00:24\n\nLet's get started!\n\n00:28\n\nThis event is a fan meeting for a certain game.\n\n00:32\n\nIt's proved very popular among young players.\n\n00:40\n\nThe characters are totally cute, so I've really gotten hooked on it.\n\n00:47\n\nI got pulled into the world of the game, and now I can't quit playing.\n\n00:54\n\nIt was released by China's largest game publisher.\n\n01:00\n\nOur business is making what the players want.\n\n01:04\n\nThat's what lets them get drawn into our games.\n\n01:13\n\nThe game industry continues to expand.\n\n01:16\n\nIn 2022, it had annual sales of 203 billion US dollars.\n\n01:26\n\n3 billion people are gamers, more than a third of the world's population.\n\n01:38\n\nJapan has long been known as a major force in the video game industry.\n\n01:45\n\nNow, to survive on a global scale, a drastic change is occurring there.\n\n01:54\n\nI don't know what I did, but it was cool!\n\n01:58\n\nIt felt great when I pulled off a special move.\n\n02:05\n\nThis video game company that created generation-defining fighting games\n\n02:09\n\nis making a huge change to a well-loved series.\n\n02:19\n\nTo increase interest among users worldwide,\n\n02:23\n\nit has revamped the character designs and game system.\n\n02:29\n\nOur concept was a Street Fighter that could be enjoyed by all mankind.\n\n02:36\n\nThat's right, all mankind.\n\n02:43\n\nELDEN RING!\n\n02:46\n\nMeanwhile, another Japanese game maker has given birth to worldwide hits by pursuing their own trajectory.\n\n02:57\n\nTheir games are known to be agonizingly difficult,\n\n03:01\n\na twist mesmerizing loyal users to attain unprecedented success.\n\n03:10\n\nEven as a niche, being a global niche is totally different.\n\n03:14\n\nHaving this many players out there allows games to be developed to suit specific needs.\n\n03:24\n\nA battle for the ages spans the globe as game makers worldwide plan their next attack.\n\n03:37\n\nIn this program, we follow the challengers in this massive industry.\n\n03:52\n\nOne of the largest video game events in the world, the Tokyo Game Show.\n\n04:04\n\nA new peak of 787 companies exhibited their latest creations.\n\n04:15\n\n240 thousand attendees witnessed the spectacle.\n\n04:20\n\nWe have space for just 10 more!\n\n04:26\n\nOne booth attracted particular interest from fans.\n\n04:32\n\nWow! Wow!\n\n04:48\n\nIt was for fighting game Street Fighter 6.\n\n04:52\n\nAfter 7 years, the latest entry to the series.\n\n05:04\n\nShoryuken!\n\n05:16\n\nI love the excitement in their voices.\n\n05:20\n\nPerfect.\n\n05:23\n\nDevelopment has been led by the game's director, Nakayama Takayuki, and its producer, Matsumoto Shuhei.\n\n05:33\n\nThey're eager to gauge player response.\n\n05:46\n\nI was happy to see so many people lining up.\n\n05:51\n\nIt's nice to see people playing.\n\n05:54\n\nOf course, people had played the series a lot in arcades.\n\n06:00\n\nBut these days there are fewer arcades, so it's great to see them out here.\n\n06:05\n\nYou feel a connection.\n\n06:17\n\nThe game was created by one of Japan's most prominent video game developers and publishers, Capcom.\n\n06:27\n\nOver the last decade, they've seen a steady increase in sales.\n\n06:36\n\nTheir sales in the 2022 fiscal year amounted to around 900 million dollars.\n\n06:43\n\n80% of that came from the overseas market.\n\n06:47\n\nTheir long creative history has boasted numerous hits in diverse genres including horror and action.\n\n06:56\n\nAmong them, Street Fighter is one of the most famous.\n\n07:09\n\nThe series began in 1987, and Street Fighter II dominated the arcade scene in the early 90s.\n\n07:18\n\nThe fighting game featured a cast of colorful characters hailing from around the globe.\n\n07:33\n\nStreet Fighter II Dash. The individual competition begins!\n\n07:43\n\nSpecial moves are pulled off with masterful command of the joystick and buttons.\n\n07:50\n\nTournaments filled with arcade warriors waiting to show their skills swept the country, creating a social phenomenon.\n\n08:01\n\nFor over 3 decades since then, the series has commanded continuing popularity.\n\n08:15\n\nWe were given permission to visit the development area.\n\n08:28\n\nAre you playing?\n\n08:31\n\nOf course not.\n\n08:35\n\nWe're performing research.\n\n08:39\n\nThe current development team has been working together for about 5 years.\n\n08:43\n\nIn order to expand overseas sales, they sought to change things up.\n\n08:55\n\nFrom programmers to designers and composers,\n\n08:59\n\nmore than 300 staff members have worked on the latest iteration.\n\n09:05\n\nTheir goal was 10 times the success of a million seller: 10 million copies in sales.\n\n09:16\n\nWe considered how to reach out to countries with people who had never played before.\n\n09:23\n\nHow to get people to think that it looks fun and give it a try is the challenge I face.\n\n09:33\n\nThe first step they took was refreshing the design.\n\n09:47\n\nIn previous games, characters were depicted with an anime-like style favored in Japan.\n\n09:56\n\nBut internationally, gamers tend to prefer character models with more realistic features.\n\n10:10\n\nI think that anime style is a hit with people who like anime, or that sort of image.\n\n10:16\n\nBut something intended to appeal to a wide variety of people should be\n\n10:22\n\na style that they're all familiar with.\n\n10:25\n\nThat's why we decided to go with a base of more realistic textures.\n\n10:32\n\nOne focal point was the depiction of muscles.\n\n10:44\n\nBeing a fighting game, the characters tend to be very physically fit.\n\n10:54\n\nTo convey this, we actually assembled a team for muscle research.\n\n11:05\n\nThe developers enlisted the help of bodybuilders and martial artists from around the world.\n\n11:16\n\nFirst, they photographed their physiques from every conceivable angle.\n\n11:22\n\nThey used this data to bring a new level of reality to the characters.\n\n11:33\n\nShe's one of the top bodybuilders.\n\n11:35\n\nYou can see that she has very little fat, and her muscles are strongly defined.\n\n11:43\n\nThis is a martial arts champion.\n\n11:49\n\nAlthough she isn't as heavily built,\n\n11:52\n\nshe seems to be muscled in a way that withstands damage.\n\n11:59\n\nThey record not just overall appearances,\n\n12:02\n\nbut the slight movements among muscles.\n\n12:18\n\nRyu is a Japanese martial artist, so he isn't quite bulging with muscles.\n\n12:28\n\nThis is a game after all,\n\n12:32\n\nso we went for a degree of emphasis where he could still look Japanese.\n\n12:42\n\nZangief is a huge wrestler, so he's got plenty of both muscle and fat.\n\n12:47\n\nEven his bone structure is big, and we aimed to put that across.\n\n12:56\n\nPower! Look at this body of iron!\n\n13:03\n\nAnother vital strategy to the game is making sure\n\n13:06\n\nthat people all over the world can enjoy it to the same extent.\n\n13:19\n\nMy job involves localizing all of Capcom's games into various different languages with the localization team.\n\n13:28\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is being translated into 14 languages, which in addition to English,\n\n13:34\n\ninclude languages such as Polish and Arabic.\n\n13:38\n\nWhen designing the stages set in each country,\n\n13:41\n\nspecial attention was paid to making them authentic.\n\n13:51\n\nTake the streets of France.\n\n14:00\n\nThis crepe shop was planned to be selling churros.\n\n14:10\n\nBut when we asked the French staff, they told us that nobody eats churros there.\n\n14:17\n\nNaturally crepes are popular in France, so we thought that would make sense.\n\n14:22\n\nWe designed the storefront accordingly.\n\n14:31\n\nFor the game's theme, they went with hip-hop for its worldwide appeal.\n\n14:37\n\nHip-hop is a genre of music that's appreciated all over the world.\n\n14:55\n\nOur concept was a Street Fighter that can be enjoyed by all mankind.\n\n15:01\n\nWe wanted to give it as broad an appeal as possible.\n\n15:06\n\nUntil now, I think not having that is something that limited us.\n\n15:11\n\nI'd like to break boundaries, in a positive sense.\n\n15:18\n\nOn a worldwide scale, there are many regions where the infrastructure is still developing.\n\n15:25\n\nThat's one reason why more people may start gaming in the future.\n\n15:31\n\nIt'll be essential to understand how they play games, or hear about them.\n\n15:40\n\nAs Japanese video game creators pursue an increasingly global standard,\n\n15:44\n\nthe game industry's growth continues to accelerate.\n\n15:51\n\n6 trillion yen or about 56 billion dollars in sales in 2014 have multiplied to 200 billion dollars in 2021.\n\n16:04\n\nAlthough during that time, the Japanese domestic market doubled from around 9 billion dollars to 18 billion,\n\n16:13\n\nthe pace of growth in regions like North America and China has been far greater.\n\n16:23\n\nWith advances in technology, graphics have made leaps in fidelity.\n\n16:28\n\nBringing a high-quality game to market now requires years of work with many people involved.\n\n16:40\n\nThe funding needed for development also reaches staggering sums.\n\n16:53\n\nProfessor Koyama Yusuke has devoted extensive research to video game manufacturing.\n\n17:01\n\nHe points out that it's not unheard of for games to require 100 million dollars in production costs.\n\n17:09\n\nIt used to be that developers could focus just on the domestic market.\n\n17:19\n\nNow, that wouldn't even cover costs.\n\n17:24\n\nJapan is still important, but the economy won't likely regain its former strength.\n\n17:30\n\nThere's a limit to our economic power, so how to sell games overseas becomes a key issue.\n\n17:41\n\nTwo months have passed since the release of Street Fighter 6.\n\n17:51\n\nIt really stands out!\n\n17:55\n\nThe producers stop by a music festival.\n\n18:07\n\nCapcom has set up a booth at a non-game-related event to judge the reaction from outside their core audience.\n\n18:21\n\nIn this entry to the series, a fundamental change was made to the game's formula.\n\n18:34\n\nAll right!\n\n18:39\n\nI don't know what I did, but it was cool!\n\n18:43\n\nI thought that it was a lot harder to do attacks with the button presses or something.\n\n18:49\n\nIt felt great when I pulled off a special move.\n\n18:55\n\nA system to easily use special moves has been implemented into the game.\n\n19:03\n\nWe want to open it up to everyone.\n\n19:07\n\nEveryone should be able to enjoy letting loose with a fireball.\n\n19:12\n\nLet us begin.\n\n19:14\n\nDon't expect me to be a pushover.\n\n19:19\n\nThe game contains between 20 and 30 moves for each character.\n\n19:28\n\nThe shoryuken, for example.\n\n19:32\n\nNormally, it would be performed by rolling the directional key right, down,\n\n19:36\n\nand diagonally to the lower right, ending with a press of an attack button.\n\n19:45\n\nIn the \"modern\" control scheme, all this can be done with one button press.\n\n19:51\n\nThis was added to significantly lower the barrier to entry, attracting new players.\n\n20:01\n\nHowever, the change incited a wave of criticism from long-time players.\n\n20:15\n\nSome people regard the necessity of inputting challenging attacks as a test of skill.\n\n20:26\n\nThere was some resistance to it from longtime players.\n\n20:33\n\nNakayama deeply understood the criticisms leveled at the change by fans.\n\n20:44\n\nHe himself has been a fan of the series since childhood.\n\n20:51\n\nWe had house rules that none among our friends could use the same character.\n\n20:57\n\nGuile and Dhalsim were the ones left.\n\n21:03\n\nI thought about which one to pick, and decided Guile looked cooler.\n\n21:10\n\nNakayama first became involved with the development of Street Fighter in 2014.\n\n21:23\n\nHe worked alongside Matsumoto, another longtime fan of the series.\n\n21:36\n\nThe first obstacle they encountered was the difficulty of attracting new players.\n\n21:46\n\nWhat struck me most was that if you ask, \"Who knows Street Fighter,\" everyone does.\n\n21:56\n\nThen you ask them, \"Who plays the game regularly?\"\n\n22:04\n\nIt's just a few people, or none.\n\n22:08\n\nI thought this was a really risky situation to be in.\n\n22:14\n\nI don't want to see the popularity of Street Fighter trail off.\n\n22:20\n\nI thought about what we could do to surpass the previous games.\n\n22:26\n\nThat meant adding in features that could be enjoyed by all current players.\n\n22:32\n\nWe set about doing everything we could in that direction.\n\n22:40\n\nThe battle to stand at the pinnacle of the video game industry is one that spans the globe.\n\n22:48\n\nCurrently, Chinese game developers are the fastest growing in the world.\n\n22:57\n\nIn 2022, the Chinese game industry boasted sales of 39 billion dollars,\n\n23:02\n\nnearly equal to the U.S. game industry.\n\n23:08\n\nThe most popular game in China is a multiplayer online battle arena,\n\n23:12\n\nor \"MOBA\" game, Honor of Kings.\n\n23:22\n\nActive users number more than 100 million.\n\n23:29\n\nIn 2022, a tournament was held offering more than 7 million dollars in prize money.\n\n23:39\n\nThe game is developed and published by Tencent.\n\n23:45\n\nWe received permission to film at their office.\n\n23:54\n\nYearly sales at Tencent's game department are about 25 billion dollars,\n\n24:00\n\nmore than that of the entire Japanese video game industry.\n\n24:05\n\nThe company's employees number around 100,000.\n\n24:10\n\nTheir headquarters includes gyms and restaurants,\n\n24:13\n\npractically a whole town devoted to their staff.\n\n24:19\n\nTencent has been buying up game developers all over Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n24:27\n\nThey now hold 20 development studios around the world.\n\n24:31\n\nAnd their next goal?\n\n24:37\n\nThis shooter game was developed with an eye toward sales in North America.\n\n24:43\n\nPlayers team up to take on opponents.\n\n24:50\n\nThis is a strategy game made with regions such as Mexico in mind.\n\n24:55\n\nPlayers hatch plans based on the changing tide of battle.\n\n25:09\n\nBy working with global studios,\n\n25:11\n\nTencent seeks to develop games that address the needs of players in each region.\n\n25:22\n\nWe place a great importance on the cultures of each region,\n\n25:27\n\nso that we can deliver enjoyment to players there.\n\n25:30\n\nWe hope that by providing a positive experience, they'll recognize the high quality of our games.\n\n25:41\n\nJapan is one of their main targets.\n\n25:51\n\nThis is a shooter they released in 2022, Goddess of Victory: NIKKE.\n\n25:57\n\nThe characters are artificial humanoids known as Nikkes.\n\n26:06\n\nThe anime-style visuals were designed to appeal to Japanese players.\n\n26:17\n\nThe game is about more than visuals.\n\n26:20\n\nIt features an RPG system where characters grow and deepen their bonds with the player.\n\n26:33\n\nThe characters eventually reveal surprising backstories.\n\n26:40\n\nAnd a long time ago, I had a little brother.\n\n26:44\n\nYeah, he's gone.\n\n26:47\n\nI want to talk about him after such a long time.\n\n26:51\n\nI wonder if my little brother will be as outstanding as you.\n\n27:00\n\nThe game grasps the Japanese trend of becoming emotionally invested in characters through their growth.\n\n27:11\n\nWe met with the team focused on development of the game.\n\n27:16\n\nThey told us about their marketing and analysis performed for the Japanese release.\n\n27:28\n\nWhat part of the game do you work on?\n\n27:31\n\nI work on promotional videos and visuals that encourage communication with the players.\n\n27:45\n\nTheir research extends not just into Japanese games, but also manga and music,\n\n27:51\n\nin order to grasp the cultural landscape.\n\n27:59\n\nIn the summer of 2023, they chose the event called Comic Market as a means to promote the game.\n\n28:08\n\nCosplayers dressed as characters from the game appeared there,\n\n28:11\n\nand the photo session was crowded with fans.\n\n28:20\n\nIn just a year of service, the game has reached 25 million downloads,\n\n28:26\n\npropelling it to sales of nearly 400 million dollars.\n\n28:32\n\nThe characters, like this one, have a mysterious element to them that's very appealing.\n\n28:40\n\nAs cute as they are, some have tragic pasts.\n\n28:44\n\nLearning about them makes you like the characters even more.\n\n28:54\n\nWe have built up a certain degree of understanding toward users worldwide.\n\n29:02\n\nBased on that, we choose the direction and work with our colleagues in R&D to create our games.\n\n29:19\n\nIncreasing globalization of the game industry has led to changes in the play environment as well.\n\n29:30\n\nThis service, Steam, provides a means to download games produced all over the world.\n\n29:39\n\nAll of them are for play on computers.\n\n29:44\n\n160,000 games are available through the service,\n\n29:48\n\nwhich is used by an estimated 100 million people.\n\n29:55\n\nThe number of games made to play on PCs or smartphones is skyrocketing.\n\n30:01\n\nHome game consoles command only 19% of the market.\n\n30:11\n\nThe fact that people can play games without dedicated consoles is a big issue.\n\n30:19\n\nIn advanced developing countries, smartphones and PCs are the only options.\n\n30:28\n\nJapan had once stood at the top of the industry through its mastery of home consoles.\n\n30:33\n\nAs they became less influential, Japan lost its edge in attracting new users.\n\n30:43\n\nThe efforts of Japanese game companies are now pitted against worldwide competition.\n\n30:55\n\nGames made in developing countries find a direct audience with advanced countries.\n\n31:03\n\nCountries that weren't influential before might produce a hit game.\n\n31:09\n\nAs the culture of games expands globally,\n\n31:12\n\nthe industry has opened up to the possibility of hits from anywhere in the world.\n\n31:26\n\nAmidst this intense international competition,\n\n31:29\n\none game publisher has delivered breakout hits.\n\n31:35\n\nAlright. The Game of the Year, winner is... ELDEN RING!\n\n31:48\n\nWhat a surprise. Thank you.\n\n31:52\n\nIn 2022, Elden Ring was awarded Game of the Year.\n\n31:57\n\nWhile journeying through a vast open-world environment,\n\n32:00\n\nplayers do battle with all manner of frightful foes.\n\n32:09\n\nThe game was developed by Japanese company FromSoftware.\n\n32:18\n\nShrouded in secrecy, neither their development studio nor staff was available for filming.\n\n32:28\n\nWhat gives FromSoftware their overwhelming international appeal?\n\n32:36\n\nWe asked an American journalist who has covered their releases for his opinion.\n\n32:48\n\nThis genre of Souls-like, which is kind of defined by very difficult combat,\n\n32:58\n\na freedom of customization in being able to approach different challenges with different builds,\n\n33:07\n\nand having a very large risk-reward element to the gameplay.\n\n33:18\n\nFromSoftware is known for their highly challenging games.\n\n33:26\n\nNot long after starting...\n\n33:34\n\nA huge beast swoops out of the sky, crushing the player instantly.\n\n33:43\n\nOn the next try, they manage to avoid its talons...\n\n33:51\n\nBut are instead burnt alive.\n\n33:59\n\nBy enduring game over after game over, step by step,\n\n34:03\n\nplayers discover the way to defeat enemies.\n\n34:07\n\nIt's common to spend hours of play time battling a single boss.\n\n34:21\n\nIt's a very specific style of difficulty.\n\n34:23\n\nIt's not based so much on split-second reflex testing.\n\n34:28\n\nIt really is based on learning as you go, taking notes every time you die,\n\n34:35\n\nand coming back stronger with more knowledge to overcome a certain challenge.\n\n34:43\n\nFollowing the game's release, internet communities sprung up devoted to the details of gameplay.\n\n34:52\n\nPlayers from across the globe competitively post videos of their feats,\n\n34:56\n\nand come up with strategies together,\n\n34:58\n\nsharing knowledge to work their way through the game.\n\n35:06\n\nI saw it's coming. Thank god...\n\n35:13\n\nDespite, or thanks to its intense difficulty, Elden Ring has sold 20 million copies in the past year.\n\n35:32\n\nA specialist in the game industry explains that there's a distinct secret behind this success.\n\n35:44\n\nThey aim for very niche markets.\n\n35:48\n\nEven as a niche, being a global niche is totally different.\n\n35:52\n\nHaving this many players out there allows games to be developed to suit specific needs.\n\n35:59\n\nThe market size increases on the level of millions of games sold, sometimes 10 million.\n\n36:07\n\nIt all comes down to how best to handle a globally popular property.\n\n36:12\n\nWe can definitively say that how to realize the appeal to fans is a critical point.\n\n36:28\n\nMeanwhile, Street Fighter 6 is making its mark on the global arena.\n\n36:34\n\nWith 2 million copies sold in the first month since its release, it's off to a good start.\n\n36:51\n\nAs the next step, the producers are working on downloadable content for the game.\n\n37:02\n\nWe're playing the next downloadable character, A.K.I.\n\n37:09\n\nSo, shall we put him out of his misery?\n\n37:42\n\nThey took care to make her movements look totally distinct.\n\n37:53\n\nMotion capture was used in the process.\n\n37:58\n\nIn motion capture, dozens of markers are applied all over the body and filmed with 150 special cameras.\n\n38:10\n\nActual human movements are digitally captured.\n\n38:16\n\nShe sways a little, so I'd like you to drop down as low as you can.\n\n38:32\n\nA.K.I. contrasts the fluid motions of a snake with sudden, sharp strikes.\n\n38:44\n\nTwo actors take part in the filming.\n\n38:52\n\nOne of them is a contortionist.\n\n39:00\n\nThe other, a stunt performer.\n\n39:10\n\nShe's got sharp movements, and she points her nails toward the opponent.\n\n39:17\n\nWe found someone who is very flexible.\n\n39:22\n\nThat let us give the character odd, limber movements that people usually can't do.\n\n39:29\n\nIf we can mix them with sharp movements, it should give her depth as a character.\n\n39:40\n\nHere we go. Start!\n\n39:45\n\nThey aim to incorporate the special skills of both performers.\n\n39:51\n\nFor the clawed attacking motions, they use the version performed by the stuntperson.\n\n39:59\n\nThe wide leg sweeps and other flexible moves feature the contortionist.\n\n40:09\n\nAnd for the sharp poses, they again use the stuntperson.\n\n40:20\n\nThrough their combined efforts,\n\n40:22\n\na range of motions impossible for any single person are captured.\n\n40:32\n\nWe got it.\n\n40:34\n\nThank you very much.\n\n40:40\n\nTo keep players invested in the game, updates are essential.\n\n40:49\n\nIf interest trails off, the huge investment in the game could be all in vain.\n\n41:01\n\nWe keep on adding things and making adjustments.\n\n41:05\n\nI don't feel like we're anywhere near done.\n\n41:09\n\nI thought we might have some downtime after release, but we're always busy.\n\n41:16\n\nWe might not get time off for the next decade.\n\n41:22\n\nThere was one more addition to make the game as accessible as possible.\n\n41:28\n\nIn line with their concept to let anyone enjoy the game,\n\n41:32\n\nthey added the option of sound effects indicating character distance.\n\n41:45\n\nThis acts as an audio guide for players with sight impairments.\n\n41:54\n\nWe need to make the game easily playable to as wide a range of people as we can.\n\n42:07\n\nIn August 2023, a large fighting game event was held in Las Vegas.\n\n42:15\n\nStreet Fighter 6!!!...\n\n42:24\n\n7,000 people from over 50 countries and regions participated in the Street Fighter competition.\n\n42:42\n\nThe response from fans far exceeded Nakayama's expectations.\n\n42:50\n\nI got the chance to see so many people playing and practicing there.\n\n42:55\n\nAt last, I could truly feel that the game had been released.\n\n43:13\n\nThe tournament was also streamed online,\n\n43:15\n\nwhere 3.7 million fans watched from around the world.\n\n43:32\n\nThe players included people with visual impairments.\n\n43:42\n\nHe used his gauge! Will it be enough?\n\n43:46\n\nNot quite, but...\n\n43:51\n\nHe's burned out!\n\n43:58\n\nIt ended with a headbutt!\n\n44:01\n\nGreat match.\n\n44:04\n\nHe really did it just by sound!\n\n44:13\n\nThe championship featured a player from the Dominican Republic\n\n44:17\n\nagainst one from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n44:30\n\nTense strikes were exchanged...\n\n44:39\n\nSpecial moves landed...\n\n44:45\n\nAnd finally...\n\n44:52\n\nAngry Bird, you are the Street Fighter 6 Evolution 2023 champion!...\n\n45:06\n\nI was just ecstatic.\n\n45:09\n\nSomething from Japan has become a test of strength for people on a global scale.\n\n45:16\n\nIt's simple, isn't it?\n\n45:19\n\nMatches letting players compete fairly with people of other countries\n\n45:26\n\nand languages is a great thing.\n\n45:32\n\nGames have shown the power to bring the world together.\n\n45:36\n\nThis limitless possibility is an aspect of their work that Nakayama and his colleagues savor.\n\n45:49\n\nThe industry continues its ceaseless expansion.\n\n45:54\n\nIn October 2023, Microsoft bought out a major American game company for over 68 billion dollars.\n\n46:05\n\nFrom the deal, an industry giant grew even larger.\n\n46:15\n\nWith its record of over 500 million units of home console sales,\n\n46:20\n\nSony is preparing their counterstrike.\n\n46:28\n\nThey've released a device letting players access games anywhere there's Wi-Fi,\n\n46:33\n\nwithout the need for a TV.\n\n46:39\n\nThey seek to create an environment of even greater accessibility to their consoles.\n\n46:47\n\nWe hope to give people more places to play.\n\n46:52\n\nSince we've built the Playstation as a platform, that's very important to us.\n\n47:01\n\nIn China, Tencent has announced 10 new titles currently in development.\n\n47:12\n\nBy accurately measuring user needs in diverse locations,\n\n47:17\n\nthey aim to expand their market even further.\n\n47:26\n\nWe'll continue making new games with skilled developers worldwide.\n\n47:33\n\nI think that we'll bring many new titles to the market.\n\n47:41\n\nThere it is!\n\n47:44\n\nNice to see parents playing with their children.\n\n47:49\n\nAs their goal for the future, Capcom works to sell 100 million games a year.\n\n47:57\n\nThe endless battle rages on...\n\n48:02\n\nThe Asian market is big, and there are lots of areas to develop in Africa and Europe.\n\n48:10\n\nSo many people come together to make our games,\n\n48:16\n\nso I'd like to see them played by people everywhere.\n\n48:21\n\nWe're just getting started.\n\n48:29\n\nThe harder we work, the better the result.\n\n48:33\n\nWe've got a lot left to do."
