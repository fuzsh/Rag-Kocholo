        "text": "2021\n\nDollywood’s 36th season included major park infrastructure enhancements, new restaurant seating areas and ride re-tracking efforts designed to add to the guest experience. The Flower & Food Festival was held for the first time during what will become its traditional time of season and was named the inaugural winner of the IAPPA Brass Ring Award for Best New Food and Beverage Festival or Special Event. The park’s Summer Celebration included a groundbreaking multi-sensory drone light show that created a symphony of light in the sky above the park. Representing a true evolution in traditional theme park entertainment, Dollywood’s Sweet Summer Nights used nearly 400 drones to animate the spectacular Dollywood-exclusive story. The drone performance was integrated into a musically-choreographed fireworks show, creating a visual and audial event of epic proportions. In June, Dolly announced the new HeartSong Lodge & Resort, scheduled for completion in 2023, along with a new $500 million, 10-year investment strategy.\n\n2020\n\nDollywood opened its 35th anniversary season in June due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the late opening, the park opened a “budding” new event, the Flower & Food Festival, which featured hundreds of thousands of vibrant plants blooming in brilliant splashes of color. Dollywood’s Harvest Festival featuring Great Pumpkin LumiNights showcased a fresh new look with reinvigorated decorations through the park, with families delighted by thousands of imaginatively-carved pumpkin displays and family activities each evening. Due to the park’s regularly scheduled slate of early-season performances canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, the park hosted its largest lineup of music ever during the Harvest Festival - more than 800 concerts featuring Southern gospel, bluegrass, Americana and folk performers on stages throughout the park. Dollywood was named the #8 theme park in the world by Tripadvisor.\n\n2019\n\nDollywood opened Wildwood Grove, the largest expansion in the park’s history, with 11 new family experiences including a new suspended roller coaster, Dragonflier, as well as Mad Mockingbird and Black Bear Trail. A new restaurant, Till & Harvest, provided visitors with another scrumptious option from Dollywood’s award-winning food team, while the Wildwood Tree serves as the centerpiece for this sprawling new land. The season opened with Festival of Nations, headlined by Lizt Alfonso Dance Cuba and Drum Struck, and the late spring Barbeque & Bluegrass Festival hosted the greatest names in the bluegrass genre, including Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver and Rhonda Vincent & The Rage.\n\n2018\n\nDolly dubbed 2018 a “Season of Showstoppers” as Dollywood invested $1 million for additions to its season-long entertainment schedule, the largest in park history. The year started with Dollywood’s Festival of Nations and then continued in April with the Spring Mix music series featuring artists from multiple genres. Dollywood’s Barbeque & Bluegrass added an extra week of concerts, while Dollywood’s Summer Celebration featured iLuminate, finalists on America’s Got Talent in 2011, DRUMLine Live! and PaintJam, with Ricardo Barazza created stunning works of art on a spinning 360-degree canvas. Dollywood’s Harvest Festival presented by Humana provided more fall family fun with the expansion of Great Pumpkin LumiNights, and the addition of Glacier Ridge to Dollywood’s Smoky Mountain Christmas brought the total light count for the festival to more than five million. Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa was named the Top Amusement Park Resort Hotel in USA Today’s 10Best poll.\n\n2017\n\nDollywood declared 2017 the “Year of the Family” with the summertime addition of Drop Line, a 200-foot tall free-fall experience in Timber Canyon, and Whistle Punk Chaser, a junior coaster which allows Dollywood’s younger guests the opportunity to experience the exciting twists and turns of a larger roller coaster. For the first time during the fall Harvest Festival, Dollywood offered extended operating hours each evening and added Great Pumpkin LumiNights, which immersed families in fabulous fall pumpkin illumination.\n\n2016\n\nDollywood announced the addition of Lightning Rod, both the world’s fastest wood coaster and the world’s first launching wood coaster. Set to roll to the starting line in March 2016, Lightning Rod adds another groundbreaking roller coaster to the park’s already impressive portfolio of world-class attractions. The thrilling $22 million ride also marks the single largest attraction investment in The Dollywood Company’s history. Themed after a tricked out 1950s-era hot rod, Lightning Rod launches riders from zero to 45 mph more than 20 stories up its lift hill to one of the ride’s first airtime moments. At the crest of the hill, riders face twin summit airtime hills before tackling the daring first drop.
