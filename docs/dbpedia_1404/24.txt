Family Feud, one of America's longest running and most popular game-shows, is back in ATLANTA! This daytime game show pits family against family to guess the results of audience survey questions. A player from each team initially faces off, answering the question to earn the chance to either pass or play. The winning family gets a chance to earn extra cash in a bonus round. Don't miss the chance to see Steve Harvey host the world famous show LIVE!
