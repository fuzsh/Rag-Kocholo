Appearing on a game show is surprisingly easy. In most cases, it’s as simple as getting in touch with the company that produces the show and letting them know that you’re interested in becoming a contestant. You may also have to pass a preliminary audition for more competitive shows. Being selected means getting the opportunity to have fun, win cash and other prizes, or even become an overnight television sensation.
