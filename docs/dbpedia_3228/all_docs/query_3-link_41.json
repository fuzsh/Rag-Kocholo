Do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns with applying for Financial Aid or setting up your tuition payments through FACTS.\n\nProfile\n\nChris Alling\n\nPresident\n\nFaculty/Staff\n\nSara Alvarez\n\nCounselor\n\nThis is my fourth year here at Jesuit and I’m so happy to be a part of this wonderful school. I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri where I was an elementary school teacher. I moved to California about 10 years ago and really enjoy it. I’ve known since I was in elementary school that I wanted to work in Education. I was the Administrative Assistant in Counseling here at Jesuit for 3 years and decided to go back to school for my Masters in Educational Counseling. My husband is an alum of JHS and always speaks so highly of it.\n\nFaculty/Staff\n\nAmy Becker\n\nPhysics and Chemistry\n\nMs. Becker holds a B.S. from the University of Notre Dame and an M.Ed (with an emphasis in Curriculum and Instruction in Science) from the University of Missouri. Amy spent the last 8 years teaching Physics and Chemistry in Catholic high schools, most recently at Marist Catholic High School in Eugene, Oregon, and has been involved in student retreats, Track and Field, and the National Honor Society.\n\nFaculty/Staff\n\nJared Bercea\n\nIT Assistant\n\nBorn in Anaheim, CA, Jared spent his early years in Carlsbad at the beach with his family. In his elementary school years, his family moved to Northern California where Jared grew a passion for music and technology.
