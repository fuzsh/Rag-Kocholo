        "text": "For Frederick Richard, there are times when the reality hits that he’s leaving his first Olympic Games with a team bronze medal.\n\nThen there are times when he feels like he needs just a little bit more time to process it all.\n\nThe 20 year old social media sensation, better known as Frederick Flips, has achieved his goal of helping the U.S. men’s gymnastics team get back on the medal podium for the first time in 16 years. The team has proudly given themselves the nickname “the Bronze Boys.”\n\nBut he’s already ready for more.\n\n“I definitely feel very hungry to do more,” Richard told NBCOlympics.com. “We did all the work and it all paid off, which I’m really grateful for and satisfied. But that just opened up more doors and showed more potential. Now I want gold.”\n\nNow I want gold.\n\nFor Richard, the bronze medal signifies just how close the U.S. team is to the dominant nations of Japan and China.\n\n“The gap between first and third was about two points (1.8101), that’s easily something we can bridge in four years if we do it right,\" Richard said. “I’m just motivated to be on that level for 2028.”\n\nIn the future, Richard also wants to bring home individual medals. In Paris he didn’t advance to any individual event finals and finished 15th in the all-around final, which he feels was a result of exerting so much energy in the team final.\n\n“I used a lot of energy in the team final fighting for that medal,” Richard admitted. “The routines I did, I did with more energy and strength than I usually do because I really wanted it. Going into the all-around final I didn't expect to be as tired as I was and didn’t perform to the level I knew I could have, so I ended up with two falls. It just means it wasn’t my time for the all-around final. This next cycle I want to dominate and show I’m really happy to be a key part of the team winning, but I can also have those successes in the all-around and individual events too.”\n\nBeyond the medals, Richard's goals include increasing visibility for the sport on the men’s side. That’s a goal that begins at the NCAA level.\n\nNine current and former NCAA gymnasts competed in Paris, with all five members of the U.S. men’s team affiliated with a college program. However, the sport is on the brink of collegiate extinction with only 12 Division-1 colleges sponsoring men’s gymnastics teams. There are none at the Division II level, and just three at Division III level.\n\nThe threat of complete elimination has never been more imminent. With recent settlements requiring payouts to athletes, athletic departments are scrutinizing their budgets more closely than ever. As a result, the risk of sport elimination remains high, and men’s gymnastics is particularly vulnerable.\n\n“It’s really disappointing to see,” Richard said. “This is the sport I love and it looks like it's dying on the college side. I’m hoping (our bronze medal) shows the potential of gymnastics in gaining eyeballs (on the sport) — that's how the NCAA and all schools look at each sport: Is it entertaining enough to bring in revenue and sustain a program? What we’re trying to do is show gymnastics is amazing and super fun and people can fall in love with it if we do it right, which will cause schools to take a chance and open up more gymnastics teams.”\n\nRichard is also bringing visibility to the sport through his growing social media following, which currently sits at just over 1.5 million after his performance in Paris. He’s been committed to upping his social media game ever since using his national team stipend to hire two videographers the moment he stepped foot on the University of Michigan’s campus as a freshman."
