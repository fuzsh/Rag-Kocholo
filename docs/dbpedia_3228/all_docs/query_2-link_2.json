        "text": "If you think being fluent in the English language means you'll understand everything being said on the rink and in the stands of a hockey game, think again.\n\nHockey has developed its own language, adding a whole new depth of fun. So before you watch the next game, here is our hockey dictionary to help you chirp when your team is down and celly when they pull off the win.\n\nHere are 35 hockey slang words you might hear at a NCAA rink near you, defined:\n\nApple: an assist\n\nBarnburner: a high-scoring game\n\nBender: a player whose ankles bend while they're skating\n\nBottle rocket: when a goal breaks the goalie's water bottle that sits on top of the net\n\nLATEST POWER 5: Denver rises to third\n\nBiscuit: the puck\n\nBeauty/Beautician: a player who is loved not only for his skills, but for his personality. He is one of the coolest guys on the team and usually has great stories. He might also have the best flow on the team.\n\nBucket: helmet\n\nCelly: celebration following a goal\n\nCheese: the top shelf of the net\n\nChiclets: teeth\n\nChirp: to trash talk the opposing team\n\nClapper: a slapshot\n\nMORE: Men's ice hockey national championship history | USCHO rankings | Scores\n\nDangle: when a player is a deke (or decoy) by making moves to fake out the goalie or opposing player; also used to describe the act of stick-handling\n\nDirty: term to describe an outstanding deke\n\nDuster: someone who doesn't get much playing time and collects dust on the bench\n\nEgg: when the game ends 0-0\n\nFace wash: when a player rubs the palm of their glove in an opponent's face simply to annoy them\n\nFilthy: another term for a great deke or pass, like \"dirty\"\n\nFlamingo: when a player lifts one leg, standing like a flamingo, to get out of the way of a shot\n\nFlow: long hair — you can see it sticking out of their helmet\n\nGino: a goal that is scored\n\nRELATED: Frozen Four 2024 schedule and dates\n\nGongshow: a game that gets out of control, from big hits or high scores\n\nGrocery stick: the player who sits between the defensive side of the bench and the offensive side\n\nHoser: a trash talk term for calling a player or team a loser. This one has been around for a while — before the Zamboni was created, the losing team had to hose down the ice following the game.\n\nKronwalled: a huge hit by a defenseman, named after Red Wings star Niklas Kronwall\n\nLettuce: hair, on the head and the face\n\nLight the Lamp: scoring a goal — a red light goes off behind the net when a team scores a goal\n\nLip lettuce: a mustache\n\nMuffin: a shot that should have been stopped after wavering back and forth in the air all the way to the net\n\nPillows: the goaltender's leg pads\n\nPlumber: maybe not the best player on the team, but a hard working player who does the dirty work in the corners\n\nBRACKETOLOGY 101: Everything you need to know about the Frozen Four selection process\n\nSieve: a goaltender who allows a lot of goals, usually referred to as being full of holes\n\nSin-bin: the penalty box\n\nSweater: hockey jersey\n\nTop shelf: \"where grandma keeps the good stuff\" — the upper section of the goal's net between the crossbar and the goaltender's shoulders\n\nYard Sale: when a player gets hit so hard that he loses his equipment (stick, helmet, or gloves) and they're left on the ice after the play\n\nSources: FloHockey, Bleacher Report, The Hockey Writers"
