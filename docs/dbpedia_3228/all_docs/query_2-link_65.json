        "text": "Crimson Tide\n\nUA’s football team was first known as the Thin Red Line or the Crimson White. As the story goes, that changed on a soggy day in 1907, when Alabama went to Birmingham to play heavily favored Auburn. Birmingham’s iron-rich soil turned to a sea of red mud which stained Alabama’s white jerseys. The team fought Auburn to a 6-6 tie, and sports editor Hugh Roberts of the Birmingham Age-Herald is supposed to have said the team played like “a Crimson Tide.”\n\nThe elephant\n\nThe University of Alabama is the only major university with an elephant as a mascot. Like many of our traditions, multiple origin stories exist, but it seems we can again credit a sports writer.\n\nIn 1930 Everett Strupper of the Atlanta Journal wrote of his shock upon seeing the immense size of Coach Wallace Wade’s varsity players when they charged the field against Mississippi: “It was the first time that I had seen it and the size of the entire eleven nearly knocked me cold, men that I had seen play last year looking like they had nearly doubled in size.”\n\nA fan is supposed to have yelled out, “Hold your horses, the elephants are coming!” Strupper and other sports writers adopted the moniker “the red elephants” for the crimson-wearing team.\n\nWhile the elephant quickly became a team symbol, it was not until the 1979 Sugar Bowl that the official costumed elephant mascot Big Al made his debut. He has been beloved of the UA family ever since."
