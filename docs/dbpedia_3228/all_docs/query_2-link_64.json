        "text": "Port Gibson is going through an identity crisis, too. Used to be the Blue Waves. In the last couple of years they've started calling themselves the Port Gibson Blue Wave Fighting Sharks.\n\nIt sounds like a move from a badly-dubbed episode of \"Dragonball Z\".\n\nNothing that comes out of Port Gibson will ever surprise me, or shock me.\n\nI'm amazed that I haven't contributed to this in some way.\n\nFrom the Hoosier state:\n\nActive\n\nClay City & Eminence Eels\n\nCrawfordsville Athenians (the home of Lew Wallace, C-Ville is the \"Athens of the Midwest\" or something like that)\n\nDelphi Oracles\n\nFort Wayne South Archers\n\nForest Park Rangers\n\nFrankfort Hot Dogs\n\nIndianapolis Northwest Space Pioneers (the school opened in the 1960s)\n\nLaPorte Slicers\n\nMadison-Grant Argylls\n\nMishawaka Cavemen (Marengo -- where there are actually caves -- also used the name)\n\nPendleton Heights Arabians (named after the horses, not the race of people )\n\nRising Sun Shiners\n\nShoals Jug Rox\n\nTell City Marksmen\n\nVincennes Alices (named after the book \"Alice of Old Vincennes\")\n\nWashington Hatchets\n\nConsolidated out of existence\n\nAdvance Osceolons, which joined the Thorntown Kewasakees to form the ... Western Boone Stars (yes, lame nicknames are the heart of consolidated schools).\n\nArlington Purple Breezes\n\nBanquo Ghosts\n\nBattle Ground Tomahawks\n\nBedford Stonecutters (in the heart of limestone country)\n\nBloomingdale Academy Immortals\n\nBurlington Polar Cubs\n\nCambridge City Wampus Cats\n\nChili Polar Bears\n\nConcannon Cannons\n\nCory Apple Boys\n\nCynthiana Annas\n\nDePauw Blue River Echoes\n\nEdwardsport Powers\n\nFarmersburg Plowboys\n\nFort Branch Twigs\n\nHartford City Airedales (and its cousin, the Mt. Ayr Ayrdales)\n\nHolton Warhorses\n\nHuntingburg Happy Hunters (who consolidated with the Holland Dutchmen to form ... the Southridge Raiders ... ugh!)\n\nHymera Shakamaks (named after a nearby forest ... there has since been a consolidated school named Shakamak ... of which Hymera is not a part).\n\nIreland Spuds\n\nJackson Twp. Stonewalls (and we're nowhere near the Confederacy ... Roanoke also used the name)\n\nKlondike Nuggets\n\nLadoga Canners\n\nLincoln Railsplitters (who later consolidated with the Onward Redcoats)\n\nLynnville Lyndies\n\nMontezuma Aztecs, Mecca Arabs & Rosedale Hot Shots consolidated together (to form another school with a lame name, the Riverton Parke Panthers)\n\nMichigantown Ganders\n\nMilton Sharpshooters\n\nMonroe City Blue Jeans (named after former Gov. Blue Jeans Williams, a native of the town)\n\nOwensville Kickapoos\n\nPine Village Pine Knots\n\nPlainville, Wanatah & Perry Central Midgets\n\nPoseyville Posies\n\nRaleigh Sir Walters\n\nRemington Rifles\n\nRoll Red Rollers\n\nScircleville Ringers\n\nSmithville Skibos\n\nSpencer Cops (because Spencer was once the \"C\"enter \"O\"f \"P\"opulation in the U.S.)\n\nStinesville Quarry Lads\n\nSummitville Goblins\n\nSwayzee & Urbana Speed Kings\n\nTerre Haute Gerstmeyer Black Cats\n\nUpland Yeomen\n\nWallace Peppers\n\nWaynetown Gladiators\n\nWest Baden Sprudels\n\nWheatfield Shockers\n\nWhitewater Twp. Elkhorns\n\nWilliamsport Bingy Bombers\n\nI'd say I miss them too, ... but my wife might find out.\n\nLoved the bumpersticker and wish I had one. Ah, the sweet and innocent times of the mid-1980s.\n\nI know of a Senior A hockey team here in Ontario called the Muskies. The story I was told was, they were to have been called the Huskies. But when their New York Ranger-style sweaters arrived, for some reason there was an \"M\" in place of the \"H.\"\n\nAnd they remain the Muskies today, with a fish logo and everything - they're even nicknamed the Fish - even though the town in which they play doesn't have a river, a harbour or any kind of body of water anywhere nearby.\n\nOut here in the AJHL -- alberta junior hockey league -- we have the Olds Grizzlys. Apparently they can't spell in Olds. Innocent enough, sure, but after having to write it out for a hockey season you feel rather stupid doing so. I have now had to write it out for six of my eight years in the business."
