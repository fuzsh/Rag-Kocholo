        "text": "Rice and Hardcastle sounds like it could be the name of a 1980s television cop drama.\n\nBut it’s not. They are the last names of two of Arapahoe High School’s best grapplers this season: senior Jeff Rice and junior Seth Hardcastle.\n\nRice, who wrestles for the Warriors in the 171-pound weight class, and Hardcastle, at 135, both went ranked in the state the week prior to facing cross-town, non-conference rival Heritage.\n\nIt seems every wrestler at Arapahoe, especially this season, is uniquely similar to each other in several ways. That includes Rice and Hardcastle. Both athletes started wrestling only when they got to high school, their respective freshman seasons. Both started with little knowledge and skills, but after work and learning, they have risen to varsity status and a state rank this season. Rice, one of the team’s captains, said his freshman year was a disaster.\n\n“I was pretty awful,” Rice said. “I only had one win, but I kept up with it and worked with the coaches.”\n\nAt first, Rice joined wrestling to supplement his skills as a football athlete. He has played football longer, but wrestling just feeds his passion for sports overall.\n\n“I love wrestling now,” he said. “And the guys on the team are great.”\n\nHardcastle has been on varsity two seasons. He was recruited into the program by coach Steve Sisler his freshman year, strangely enough, after Sisler saw the ninth-grader dance.\n\n“I was doing flips and these breakdances, and he pulled me aside,” Hardcastle said. “At first, I thought I was in trouble. Instead, he asked me, ‘Are you a wrestler?’ I said I wasn’t, and he said, ‘You are now.’\n\n“I certainly didn’t expect that going into the dance.”\n\nHardcastle is also a football player, but he identifies himself more as a wrestler.\n\n“I’ve had more success as a wrestler,” the junior said.\n\nBoth Rice and Hardcastle feel, although wrestling comes down to the individual, they like the team aspect of the sport the most, the camaraderie.\n\n“It’s different than football,” Hardcastle said. “Everyone is in the same position, and we know what’s happening to each other.”\n\n“You’re always around each other and share the same experiences,” Rice said.\n\nEven since last season, both grapplers have shown improvement. Rice aspired to have his best season ever and keep up with the rest of the team. Arapahoe had plenty of youth on the varsity roster last season, but everyone has improved since, Rice said.\n\nHardcastle was one place away from being a state qualifier his sophomore season. He was fifth at the regional tournament. He is eyeing not only a trip downtown but also a place on his podium this year. Hardcastle credits one of his captains and wrestling partner last season, Phil Krell, who graduated 2010, for much of his improvement.\n\n“He had a lot to do with it,” the junior said. “He worked with me pretty hard and got me where I needed to be to go to state.”\n\nAnother thing that makes Rice and Hardcastle similar is their pre-game nuances. Both have their rituals before a game or between matches at a tournament. Rice tends to get down on himself prior to a match. Before he steps onto the mat, he will hit himself twice in the head, as if to knock the ill-confident thoughts out of his mind, he said. He also has to have his gear a certain way.\n\nAlthough he washes them, Hardcastle always wears the same T-shirt and socks. The shirt was a hand-me-down from his older brother, a former baseball athlete at Arapahoe, and Hardcastle has made the shirt a permanent part of his gear since his first season.\n\nYou think you can dance?\n\nApparently, dancing is another bond for Arapahoe’s wrestling team. While Hardcastle has a talent for singing, being a part of Arapahoe’s concert choir and other performing arts clubs, and he was recruited for wrestling from the dance floor in the first place, Rice also said he has a talent as a dancer.\n\n“I’m probably one of the top three dancers on the team,” Rice said.\n\nHowever, the senior said the Arapahoe wrestler with the best feet is without a doubt Square Bear. Rice wouldn’t say who the nickname Square Bear was for but it was easy to figure it out just by looking at him.\n\nA grand entrance\n\nIf Hollywood were to ever make a movie about Rice and Hardcastle and their achievements, both wrestlers have ideas of casting and the soundtrack. Hardcastle said, in the comedy that would be his life’s story on the big screen, Brad Pitt or George Clooney would be great to have play him.\n\n“They’d have to touch up my picture a little bit for the end credits,” Hardcastle said laughing. “But I think they could bring in the crowds.”\n\nRice had another idea. He thought Will Smith should play him in the movie.\n\n“My life is more fun, and I think Will Smith could do the dramatic things too,” Rice said. “But he wouldn’t be too serious either.”\n\nIn the big climactic scene where both wrestlers would step onto the mat for their big championship bout, Rice said Matisyahu’s “One Day” should be playing.\n\n“It’s a relaxing song, and it always clears my head,” the senior said.\n\nHardcastle would turn to country music and could hear Montgomery Gentry’s “Hillbilly Shoes” playing on the soundtrack of his championship moment.\n\n“Country music pumps me up I guess,” he said. “I listen to it before all my football games too and on the bus. I listen to others before matches, but I always make sure it’s in the mix.”"
