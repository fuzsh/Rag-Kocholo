        "text": "Ralph Schill, President of the CMAS Scientific & Sustainability Committee met the legendary oceanographer Sylvia Earle in a panel discussion. She began diving at age 16 and has spent more than 6,000 hours underwater. In 1979 she got the nickname \"Her Deepness\", because she became the first and still the only person to walk solo on the bottom of the world on the ocean floor in the depth of 1,250 feet.\n\nShe is a recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees and is a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. As an advocate for marine conservation she founded Mission Blue / The Sylvia Earle Alliance. Mission Blue is uniting a global coalition to inspire an upwelling of public awareness, access and support for a worldwide network of marine protected areas - Hope Spots."
