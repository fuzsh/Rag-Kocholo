The majority of parents do not know how to make their children understand the importance of exercising, especially because of the amout of technology no child will rather go out and play football than sitting at home and watching TV or playing video games. Should we encourage children to do sports? Firstly, doing sports is important for our health and if children do not do sports it may cause health conditions when they get older for example overweight. Choosing an exercise should be appropriated to the child's age and development. A good thing to do is to take the child for a walk, swimming pool or even to play a video game Wii. Secondly, sports makes children more active and playful, which develops their minds.

Some say that people nowadays spend too much time playing games and sports. It is my opinion that it is important to do sports and playing games is developing. First of all, there aren’t too many people who do sports, i’d say too less. Most people I know enjoy staying indoors. I think everyone should take part in sports in order to have healthy body and a healthy mind. Secondly, playing computer games is rather good than bad. Games help people relax and they can teach us a lot about history or geography as well. Opponents say that people are wasting time on games and sports. Firstly, they argue that sports can be injurious. For example, you broke your leg while playing football. They also say that computer games are addictive and make people aggressive.\n\nFree Time - Vaba Aeg\n\nFree Time In my free time I do a lot of a things.

A lot of us enjoy doing different sports, others maybe not so much. Everybody needs some sport while growing. It is not only because the world today is filled with computers and people are always sitting by desks. Sport has many positive effects on people besides having a fit body. There is a saying that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind. Team sports show and teach how to work in a group, how to communicate. People who play sports can release some energy in the game also and they will be calmer, their decisions will be more calculated. Training regularly will teach how to divide their time between school or a job and training. I think that sport is a good way to teach a person some responsibility and consistence, too. To make some improvement in a certain sport a person has to keep training consistently.\n\nInglismaa - lühitutvustus\n\nrelaxation or sporting activities.

Why is it so important to drink plenty of liquids during exercise? Water acts as your body's cooling system. You don't want to get dehydrated. The best way to stay hydrated is to drink plenty of fluids with meals, and drink about 2 cups (16 ounces) of water 2 hours before exercise. Is it better to stay hydrated with sports drinks or plain water? Water is often enough. But if you're exercising for more than 60 minutes in hot, humid conditions, sports drinks may help. They give you carbs and sodium, as well as fluids. Sports drinks are also a good choice if you play team sports like soccer or football, especially when the temperature and humidity are high. If you sweat a lot, a sports drink might be preferable to water. Is it bad to exercise on an empty stomach, especially in the morning?\n\nThe United States\n\narea.

The sheer volume of money spent each year on sports are actually absolutely ridiculous. Sports have become a monster that is beyond our control. This happens as legitimate scientific research struggles to find funding or a struggle along with tiny handouts from patronising governments around the world. Space exploration is probably the prime example in that it is now, at this stage of human development, more important than ever before that we find ways to make space inhabitable. But instead NASA has become a bit of a joke to the public and space exploration the stuff of B-\n\nEesti üritused, toidud, spordialad, talv\n\n2.
