        "text": "Can you believe that you can actually play Quidditch in real life? The sport that Harry plays at Hogwarts is now played by over 20,000 people across the world. However, flying on magical broomsticks has been replaced by running around a field with a broomstick in between your legs.\n\nApart from this the rules are pretty much the same as in the Harry Potter books. The aim of the game is to score as many points as you can before someone captures the golden snitch.\n\nÂ Â\n\nEver had a pillow fight and got in trouble? Then check out International Pillow Fight Day. One day a year people get together in town squares across the world to fight it out with a pillow.\n\nFor those that take it really seriously, there's a World Pillow Fight Championship taking place in America in 2019. You better get practicing!\n\nÂ Â\n\nYes, you are looking at people playing football with their bikes! The game Cycle Ball was invented in 1893 in America and involves two teams of two players with the aim of scoring goals with a bike.\n\nPlayers are not allowed to use their hands or feet and can only move the ball with their bike. The bikes themselves are specially adapted for the game and don't even have brakes. Don't try this on your own bike as it can be pretty dangerous.\n\nÂ Â\n\nYes, people actually race sit-on lawnmowers! The sport was invented in the 1960s by a group of people who found other kinds of motorsports too expensive.\n\nThey removed the cutting blades for safety from their lawnmowers and set up lawnmower races across Britain. You need to be 18 to compete, but you can go and watch a race if you are interested in seeing how it's done.\n\nÂ Â\n\nGet your nose pegs at the ready, the annual Toe Wrestling World Championships takes place in Derbyshire, England! It has similar rules to arm wrestling and after having their feet inspected for signs of fungus or injury, contestants sit on the floor, facing each other and lock toes.Â\n\nThe aim of the game is to attempt to pin the other's foot for three seconds to the sideboard. It is the best of three rounds and played first with the right foot, then left, and right again (if necessary). There is also a tradition for players to remove the other player's shoes and socks before they play!Â\n\nÂ Â\n\nEver wanted to be a mermaid? Well, you can now get special mermaid swimming lessons. You put both feet in a large single fin (similar to the fins you'd wear for scuba diving) and wear a mermaid tail which holds your legs together to get that half-fish mermaid look.\n\nYou have to learn a special swimming technique that's a bit like a butterfly stroke, under the guidance of a professional mermaid instructor and then you too will be swimming like a mermaid!\n\nÂ Â\n\nLog rolling is where two people compete to knock each other off a log floating in water. The competitors battle to stay on the log by running, jumping and kicking the log whilst attempting to knock their opponent into the water.\n\nThe match begins with a whistle and continues until someone falls in or the time runs out. The first person to lose contact with the log and fall into the water loses the game. A competitive match consists of five games and the first to three wins.\n\nÂ Â\n\nStreet luge is an extreme gravity-powered activity that involves riding a street luge board (sometimes referred to as a sled) downhill over a paved road or pre-defined course. Much like the Winter Olympic sport of luge, riders lie back with their feet facing forward and steer using their bodyweight.\n\nIt was originally invented by skateboarders in California who wanted to go faster downhill, so they lay down on their skateboards. Professionals now reach speeds of over 100mph!\n\nÂ Â\n\nMountain unicycling or 'muni' as itâs often known, is an adventure sport that involves people using a specially designed unicycle to cross terrain you'd usually ride a mountain bike on.\n\nMuni riders require much more focus on the route than normal mountain bikers and the risk of falling off is much higher. The unicycles are equipped with large, knobbly tires, high-grip pedals and rugged frames. Some are also equipped with brakes, having the lever mounted under the nose of the saddle to help with stability going downhill.Â Â\n\nÂ Â\n\nSwamp football (or 'swamp soccer' as it's more commonly known) is a game of football played in a big muddy bog. Teams play with six players on a very squidgy pitch and games have two ten minute halves.\n\nThe game was invented in Finland in 1998, when the top Finnish cross-country skiers wanted to improve their basic level of fitness during the summer months, so practiced football in the swamp. The aim of the game, just like regular football, is to score more goals than your opponent.Â Â\n\nÂ Â\n\nThis is a race between humans and horses, and guess what, the horses usually win! The Man versus Horse Marathon is an annual race over 22 miles, where runners compete against riders on horseback through the Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells.\n\nIt originated when someone tested a much debated theory, that over a significant distance across country, man was equal to any horse. It has been run since 1980 and has only been won by a human twice, with the first winner in 2004 scooping up a Â£25,000 prize for achieving such an incredible feat.\n\nÂ Â"
