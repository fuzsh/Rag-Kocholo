        "text": "Discover Virginia Tech’s rich history and traditions through our heritage as a leading university from 1872 to the present.\n\nWhat is a “Hokie”?\n\nColors and mascot\n\nAthletics traditions\n\nThe Corps of Cadets\n\nCampus buildings and memorials\n\nMotto, seal, and logos\n\nMore history\n\nWhat is a “Hokie”?\n\nIn the 1890s, a student named O.M. Stull, Class of 1896, won a $5 prize for coming up with a new spirit cheer, now known as “Old Hokie.” The original went:\n\nHoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy.\n\nTechs, Techs, V.P.I.\n\nSola-Rex, Sola-Rah.\n\nPolytechs - Vir-gin-ia.\n\nRae, Ri, V.P.I.\n\nLater, an “e” was added to “Hoki” to make “Hokie,” and “Team! Team! Team!” was attached to the end.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nSignificant academic changes in 1896 ushered in a new name more befitting the university’s higher profile — Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, commonly known as Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or VPI.\n\n1944: The shortened Virginia Polytechnic Institute became the official name.\n\n1970: The Virginia General Assembly bestowed university status, and the formal name of the university became Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\n\nToday: Virginia Tech is the university’s official nickname, used in all but the most formal situations.\n\nColors and mascot\n\nVirginia Tech colors\n\nDuring 1896, a committee was formed to find a suitable combination of colors to replace the original colors of black and gray, which made athletic uniforms resemble prison garb. The committee selected burnt orange and Chicago maroon because no other college was using that particular color combination.\n\nBurnt orange and Chicago maroon was first worn during a football game against Roanoke College on October 26, 1896.\n\nVirginia Tech mascot: From Gobbler to HokieBird\n\nHokies were once called “Gobblers,” a nickname whose origin is widely disputed. One story claims it resulted from the way student athletes would “gobble” up their food.\n\nThe name was already popular when Floyd Meade, a local resident, trained a large turkey to pull a cart at a football game in 1913. Throughout the years, trained turkeys would continue to gobble on command and perform stunts. In 1962, a student raised $200 for a costume; the result was an unusual turkey with a cardinal-like head, known as the Gobbler and then the Fighting Gobbler.\n\nAthletic traditions\n\nFight song\n\n“Tech Triumph,” the university's most popular fight song, was composed in 1919 by Wilfred P. Maddux (Class of 1920) and his neighbor, Mattie Eppes. It was officially adopted by the student body in December 1919.\n\nTechmen, we’re Techmen, with spirit true and faithful,\n\nBacking up our teams with hopes undying;\n\nTechmen, oh, Techmen, we’re out to win today,\n\nShowing “pep” and life with which we’re trying;\n\nV.P., old V.P., you know our hearts are with you\n\nIn our luck which never seems to die;\n\nWin or lose, we’ll greet you with a glad returning,\n\nYou’re the pride of V.P.I.\n\nChorus:\n\nJust watch our men so big and active\n\nSupport the Orange and Maroon. Let’s go Techs.\n\nWe know our ends and backs are stronger,\n\nWith winning hopes, we fear defeat no longer.\n\nTo see our team plow through the line, boys.\n\nDetermined now to win or die:\n\nSo give a Hokie, Hokie, Hokie, Hy,\n\nRae, Ri, old V.P.I.\n\n\"Alma Mater\"\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\" was born in spring 1939 when Ernest T. Sparks (Class of 1940) composed music and L.G. Chase (Class of 1941) wrote lyrics for a student contest.\n\nVerse:\n\nSing praise to Alma Mater dear,\n\nFor V.P.I. we'll ever cheer;\n\nCome lift your voices, swell the song,\n\nOur loyalties to her belong.\n\nChorus:\n\nSo stand and sing, all hail to thee.\n\nVT, all hail to thee.\n\nVerse:\n\nThe Orange and Maroon you see,\n\nThat’s fighting on to victory;\n\nOur strife will not be long this day,\n\nFor glory lies within this fray.\n\nVerse:\n\nAll loyal sons and daughters, one,\n\nWe raise our banner to the sun;\n\nOur motto brings a spirit true,\n\nThat we may ever serve you.\n\n“Enter Sandman”\n\nWritten and recorded by the heavy metal band Metallica, “Enter Sandman” has been played in Lane Stadium since 2000 as the football team enters the field. The tradition of students jumping up and down during the song started on December 1, 2001, when a Marching Virginians band member started jumping during the song and was joined by his colleagues. The tradition eventually spread to the basketball teams’ entrances in Cassell Coliseum.\n\nThe lunch pail\n\nThe famed Virginia Tech lunch pail symbolizes the blue-collar approach of the Hokies’ football defense, developed by assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. Foster’s Lunch Pail Defense Foundation provides scholarships for high school students from the New River and Roanoke valleys, as well as assisting the families of those awaiting organ transplants.\n\nIn 1995, the original lunch pail was acquired by the mother-in-law of co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless. The pail once belonged to a coal miner, and after the record-setting defensive season, the lunch pail became an iconic element of the Hokie football lore. The battered and rusting pail, which now contains the names of the 32 Hokies who died in the tragedy on April 16, 2007, travels wherever the Hokies go, and its care is entrusted to a defensive leader.\n\nGame-Ball Run\n\nRanger Company, the Army ROTC company, has performed the Game-Ball Run every year since 1977, although the tradition likely originated with the Virginia Tech-VMI football games years before that.\n\nMembers of Ranger Company run the game ball for 100 miles around campus during the week of the annual homecoming football game and then hold a ceremony the day of the game, which includes running the ball into the stadium.\n\nFiring cannons: Skipper\n\nAt a football game against Virginia Military Institute (VMI), two cadets from the Class of 1964 made a pact that they would build a cannon to outshine — or outblast — VMI’s “Little John.” The cadets, Homer Hadley “Sonny” Hickam (of “October Sky” fame) and Alton B. “Butch” Harper Jr., collected brass from fellow cadets and added it to metal provided by Hickam’s father. On its first firing, the eager cadets tripled the charge, which blew the hats off half the VMI Keydets and shook the glass in the pressbox windows of Roanoke’s Victory Stadium.\n\n“Skipper” is named for President John F. Kennedy, who had been a PT-boat skipper. Today, Skipper is fired at football games and for other notable occasions.\n\nMore athletics history\n\nThe first known organized competition against an off-campus team occurred in 1877 when the VAMC baseball team, which probably included townspeople, played Roanoke College and won by a record score of 53-13.\n\nThe first effort to formalize athletic activities came in fall 1891 when the VAMC Athletic Association was established. The following year, a football team and tennis association were added. In one long-running and affectionately remembered football tradition, Tech played VMI in Roanoke on Thanksgiving Day for nearly 75 years.\n\nWomen finally joined the athletics fold in 1970 with a swimming team. Women’s basketball followed in 1972.\n\nThe Hokies have been a member of several conferences over the years. They joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2004. NCAA Division I-A men’s varsity sports at Tech are football, basketball, baseball, soccer, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, wrestling, tennis, golf, and cross country. Women’s varsity sports are basketball, tennis, volleyball, swimming and diving, indoor and outdoor track, soccer, softball, lacrosse, golf, and cross country.\n\nThe Student-Athlete Performance Center benefits recruiting, nutrition, and performance for all 22 varsity sports. And in 2021-22 academic year, over 350 of the university's student-athletes earned GPAs above 3.0.\n\nVirginia Tech Corps of Cadets\n\nOur oldest tradition\n\nThe Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets became official in the 1890s, drawing from the university’s origin in 1872 and its required military training for students. As the university changed and innovated, so did the corps. Mandated four-year participation in the corps for all males changed to two years in 1923 — the same year women were first admitted — and then participation became voluntary in 1964.\n\nToday, Virginia Tech is one of three public universities in the country with both an active corps of cadets and a “civilian” lifestyle on its campus.\n\nUpper Quad\n\nCentered in Virginia Tech’s early history, the university’s Upper Quad has long been the home of the Corps of Cadets. Lane Hall, completed in 1888, is a state and national historic landmark originally known as Barracks No. 1. In front of the hall is an orange and maroon sidewalk that forms the largest “VT” on campus.\n\nIn recent updates, Pearson and New Cadet halls have replaced older cadet residence halls, and a new plaza between the halls displays the Corps’ monuments, honoring those who have served in the past and present.\n\nMarching in memory of Caldwell\n\nThe Corps of Cadets pay homage to the university’s beginnings and celebrate the progress of first-year cadets by retracing the walk Add Caldwell took from Craig County. Cadets cover the first 13 miles in the fall and the second 13 miles in the spring to mark the end to the first year of training.\n\nCampus buildings and memorials\n\nHokie Stone\n\nVirginia Tech exhibits its character and pride every day via its buildings, most of which are made of Hokie Stone, a limestone common in Southwest Virginia. It was first used in campus building construction in 1899, and today, all new central campus buildings must bear the distinctive stone.\n\nThe Hokie Stone symbolizes our relentless spirit, our courage to move forward, and our determination never to forget.\n\nGargoyles and grotesques\n\nTheir hunched bodies and contorted faces are the stuff of Hokie legend. At least 15 “gargoyles” at Virginia Tech fit right into our neo-Gothic architecture. And for some students, finding every one of them before graduation is a rite of passage.\n\nFunctional gargoyles are waterspouts that move water away from the roof of a building. So while the “cowgoyles” of Saunders Hall might not function as waterspouts, they are a beloved decorative element.\n\nList of known gargoyles:\n\n4 Eggleston Hall\n\n4 Hillcrest Hall\n\n3 Smyth Hall\n\n4 Saunders Hall\n\nVirginia Tech motto, seal, and logos\n\nIn 1896, the university adopted Ut Prosim, Latin for \"That I May Serve,\" as its motto, and a college seal was developed. The Virginia Tech Board of Visitors did not officially adopt the seal, which is still used, until 1963.\n\nThe university also has an athletic logo: a streamlined “VT,” which is used only for sports and sports merchandise. Unveiled in 1984, the athletic logo is a composite of designs submitted by two Virginia Tech students to a competition sponsored by the university’s art department.\n\nMore Virginia Tech history\n\nFirming and building the foundations\n\nJohn M. McBryde laid the foundations for modern-day Virginia Tech in the 1890s, including the development of B.S. degrees and graduate study, granting permanent status for the Corps of Cadets, and starting the athletics program. McBryde and his son also developed the university’s motto: Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).\n\nT. Marshall Hahn Jr. transformed VPI from college status to a major research university in the 1960s and 1970s. He championed the development of a university education and led the movement to create the research division. The student body tripled, and eight residence halls and 10 other major facilities were added.\n\nCharles W. Steger expertly guided the university’s growth and scope during the first 14 years of the 2000s. Research funding and private fundraising increased. He established the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute and a school of biomedical engineering. He was a visionary leader for the Moss Arts Center and in elevating Virginia Tech’s presence in Northern Virginia.\n\nThat “huge” Virginia Tech ring\n\nColleges across the country offer students the chance to buy a class ring, but very few annually redesign the ring to be unique to each class. This tradition began at Virginia Tech in 1911-12, and the resulting ring always invokes memories, traditions, and pride.\n\nEach year, the sophomore class selects a Ring Committee to design their ring collection, which always includes the screaming eagle, American flag, campus buildings, and an interlocking chain around the bezel. From there, the Ring Committee incorporates characteristics unique to its class.\n\nSince 1934, couples have exchanged rings at the Virginia Tech Ring Dance to the tune of “Moonlight and VPI,” written specifically for the Ring Dance by composer Fred Waring and lyricist Charles Gaynor."
