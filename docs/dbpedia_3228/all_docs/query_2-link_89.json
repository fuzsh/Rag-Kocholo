        "text": "Call it Cornhole. Call it Bean Bag Toss or Bags or Bag Toss. Call it whatever you like, just play this fun game soon. You will be hooked for life. It was only after I became involved with Slick Woody’s Cornhole Company as an Inbound Marketer, that I found myself totally addicted to tossing the bags.\n\nYup! This game of throwing a corn- or resin-filled bag at a board with a hole in the top has been around a long while. Sometimes people use beans in the bags, thus the name Bean Bag Game or The Bags Game.\n\nWhere is this game played?\n\nCornhole has been very popular in the upper Midwest and South forever. Now it is the fastest growing game in America with it being played in the bars of Brooklyn and in the trendy hot spots of SoCal.\n\nProbably the most well know place our game is played is while tailgating at sports events. Thus it is also referred to as Tailgate Toss or The Tailgate Game. At almost every college and pro football stadium parking lot you, will find people playing cornhole. The smell of BBQ grills, the popping open of cans and bottles, and the sounds of bags hitting on a cornhole board surface... these are the sights and sounds of pre-game in America.\n\nAnother favorite spot for throwing the cornhole bags is the backyard picnic. The cooler is full, the brats are on the grill, and the Backyard Toss or Lawn Toss games have already begun.\n\nWhat are the lesser known names for our game?\n\nOther names I have seen are Soft Horseshoes or Hillbilly Toss. This lawn game has many names, but is loved by all because it is a game of skill. Much like old standards lawn bowling, metal horseshoes, and bocce, cornhole requires patience and developing that consistent throwing motion to beat your opponents.\n\nPeople and companies have tried to own the cornhole identity with names such as Baggo and Chuck-O. Others have put a personal spin on it with names such as Doghouse (pretty obvious metaphor), Dadhole (don’t ask me), and Dummy Boards (hopefully not talking about me).\n\nThe list of names by which Cornhole or Bag Toss is known:\n\nCornhole\n\nBag Toss\n\nBean Bag Toss\n\nBags\n\nBagz\n\nBean Bag Game\n\nBags Game\n\nTailgate Toss\n\nTailgate Game\n\nBackyard Toss\n\nLawn Toss\n\nSoft Horseshoes\n\nHillbilly Toss\n\nCornhole Toss\n\nBaggo\n\nChuck-O\n\nDoghouse\n\nDadhole\n\nDummy Boards\n\nSo, what do we call it?\n\nBy any name that you play this great lawn or tailgate game, cornhole is sweeping the nation. Here at Slick Woody’s Cornhole Company, we are old school. We call them bags and boards. But as you can see, our company name says it all. In Ohio, we call it Cornhole!\n\nE-mail us at Slick Woody’s Cornhole Company and tell us what this awesome game is called in your neck of the woods.\n\nSometimes being the best in the business just requires getting everyone’s name correct. We didn’t say we were the best, Wiki-EzVid says so. Check out this video ranking Slick Woody’s as both the number 6 as well as the Number 1 cornhole board offered in the Amazon Store.\n\nReady to play cornhole?"
