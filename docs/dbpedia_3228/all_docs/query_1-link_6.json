        "text": "I can see you blushing. You’re trying not to giggle. Octopush??? “Is that a, uh…well… a, uh… Is it when you, uh… Please just tell me what it is! No wait, don’t! … Well?”\n\nThe name is comically deceptive. It is not related to intimacy (Whew!). It is also has nothing to do with giving birth to eight children at once (sorry Octomom). Neither of these categories are sanctioned sports (yet?), but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to have a little fun.\n\nIt’ s like the bean bag chair that I had in college. Friends would snuggle up and get really comfortable and then ask ‘What is this?’ to which I would reply ‘a Lovesac’. Instantly they would bolt upright and fling themselves across the room, traumatized by thoughts of everything that happened in the chair before they sat down. I would break out laughing. Lovesac is a brand. Totally misleading, but totally worth it.\n\nStill…what on earth is this sport? It might help to know that it was created by the English, the same people who have a point system using emotions and uneven intervals (heres looking at you, tennis). It also has a second, more widely adopted name outside of England.\n\nUnderwater hockey.\n\nThat’s right. Hockey played at the bottom of pool. Why waste money cooling a rink, when you can simply play below the surface?\n\nOkay, so why Octopush? The origins are murky. (Pun!) . Just kidding, they’re actually crystal clear. (Lame second pun.)\n\nAlan Blake, an English diver, founded the training facility Southsea Sub-Aqua Club (also known as the British Sub-Aqua Club No.9) in 1954. Early on, it became apparent that interest in the club was tied to the open-water season. Memberships took a dive (really? another one?) during the winter months, which drastically hampered operations.\n\nBlake had the idea to create an underwater sport, one that would still foster diving skills while also providing a new form of entertainment. He came up with the basics and had several companions help to fill in the rest. In short, two teams of eight players (octo) would utilize a curved bat (pusher) to move and score a disk. Hence, Otcopush. (For better or worse, the game was simply going to be Octopus until ‘pusher’ became part of the vernacular).\n\nIn summary, an oddly named sport was born out of sheer boredom…well, sheer determination to prevent boredom so as not to lose members during the dive offseason.\n\nGot it?\n\nThe name is outdated, because the standard team is now made up of ten players, six in the pool at a time. The rules are actually enforced by a governing body, the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (World Confederation of Underwater Activities) or CMAS. There are over 100 recognized federations across all continents.\n\nPlay is pretty straightforward. Athletes wear suits similar to those used in competitive swimming. They also adorn a mask, snorkel, and fins. The snorkel allows play to be viewed from the surface without having to repeatedly lift the head out of the water to take a breath. Water polo caps are worn, primarily to protect the ears, as are gloves on the pusher (or stick) wielding hand.\n\nPushers are extremely small compared to their much cooler counterparts. There are a wide variety of sticks available and few restrictions surrounding what players can and cannot use. The principal rules stipulate that any stick must be able to fit in a box with dimensions 100 mm × 50 mm × 350 mm (3.9 in × 2.0 in × 13.8 in) and must not be able to surround the puck or hand that holds it. Additionally, to prevent injury, the radius at any edge must be minimum of 10mm (e.g., a rounded edge). Many athletes still create their own sticks, but mass manufacturers are becoming more popular.\n\nThe final elements are the puck (once called the ‘squid’) and gulley (or goal, originally the ‘cuttle’). The puck is similar in size to that used in ice hockey, but its construction is of plastic-coated lead. The plastic coating depends entirely upon the type of pool bottom (e.g., concrete, tile) as grip and friction can vary. The gulley is a three meter piece of aluminum, only twice as wide as the puck, with a brief upward slope that resolves into a trough. A goal is only scored when the puck reaches the trough.\n\nGames are comprised of two fifteen minute halves. Unfortunately it isn’t the best spectator sport, because, well, how many pools do you know of that have an underwater viewing area? Hopefully that will be the next great development in the sport, but in the meantime, cameras provide the best coverage.\n\nThe next World Championships will take place July 2020 in Gold Coast, Australia.\n\n(If anyone wants to fly me out there, I won’t say no!)\n\nCheck it out for yourself on below!"
