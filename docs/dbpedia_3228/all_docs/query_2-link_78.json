They do not set aside nor modify any rule. They are made and published by the NFHS in response to situations presented. Dr. Karissa L. Niehoff, Publisher, NFHS Publications © 2023\n\n2023 NFHS Football Rules Book Clarification:\n\n(Underlining shows additions; strikethrough shows deletions.)\n\nPage 82, Rule 10-5-2: ART. 2 . . . The enforcement spot for any foul by the defense is the goal line when the run ends in the end zone and would result in a safety.\n\nRule 10-4 and TABLE 10-4 are correct as listed in the 2023 NFHS Football Rules Book.\n\nIn compiling the multitude of changes to Rule 10 necessitated by the discussion around the proposed 2023 NFHS football rules change that was approved unanimously, there remains two additional clarifications to be made for coaches, administrators and game officials for the upcoming 2023 high school football season.\n\nTo summarize, if on-field game situations involving a loss of possession create a conflict between the end of the run or related run and the succeeding spot, game officials should apply the standard related to the end of the run as intended by the cleanup in Rule 10-4-8. This does not apply to fouls as detailed in Rule 10-4-5a through 10-4- 5d which explicitly call for succeeding spot enforcement (the spot where the ball will next be put in play per Rule 2-41-10). Rule 2-41-9b will help clarify those situations in which conflict might exist.\n\nRule 10-4 and TABLE 10-4 Clarification – (Play Situations):\n\nPLAY 1: A first and 10 on A’s 40. The runner runs to B’s 40, where he fumbles the ball forward and out of bounds at B’s 30. During the run (before the fumble), A11 commits a holding foul at B’s 38. RULING: The holding penalty is enforced from the end of the run (B’s 40 - the fumble spot). A first and 10 at the 50.\n\nPLAY 2: A first and 10 on A’s 40. The runner runs to B’s 40, where he fumbles the ball forward and out of bounds at B’s 30. During the run, B18 commits a face mask foul anywhere on the field. RULING: The penalty for illegal face mask is enforced from the end of the run (B’s 40 - fumble spot). A first and 10 on B’s 25.\n\nPLAY 3: A first and 10 on A’s 40. The runner runs to B’s 40, where he fumbles the ball forward and B RECOVERS at B’s 30. During the run, B11 commits a face mask foul anywhere on the field. RULING: The penalty for illegal face mask is enforced from the end of the run (B’s 40 - fumble spot). A first and 10 on B’s 25.\n\n2023 NFHS Football Case Book Clarification: (Underlining shows additions; strikethrough shows deletions.)\n\nPage 75, 9.2.1 SITUATION J: On a successful try for point by kick, the interior linemen of K all reached across and grasped the teammate immediately to their inside after the snap. RULING: Interlocked blocking, 10-yard penalty from the previous spot spot of the foul since this spot is probably behind the basic spot. (10-4-2)\n\n2024-25 NFHS FB Game Officials Manual Points of Emphasis\n\nPREGAME ADMINISTRATION\n\nMany game officials may be under the impression that their job begins at kickoff and ends when the game clock expires. However, efficient administration of a game requires advance planning by the crew to ensure awareness of potential distractions that can cause problems and disrupt the orderly conduct of the game.\n\nPregame administration begins a few days before the game. The referee, as crew chief, has some added administrative responsibilities. The referee should contact the host school (either the athletic director or designated game administrator) by email or phone a few days prior to the game to confirm the date and time of kickoff. This is particularly important if the game was assigned months – and sometimes years – in advance. Games can and will be cancelled or rescheduled by schools, and members of the officiating crew are usually the last people to know of such changes. Moreover, it is a common business courtesy to contact clients in advance to confirm arrangements.\n\nThe referee should also inquire about parking location, changing facilities (if provided), the name and phone number of a contact person for the crew upon arrival, and whether there are any special activities occurring prior to the game. The referee should inform the school of the approximate arrival time of the crew. The referee should also inquire where the locker rooms are located for each team. This information can be important because some teams go to their locker room or another designated location after warm-up and return to the field just a few minutes before kickoff. If the referee is not aware of the team’s location and has not had an opportunity to meet with the team’s head coach, the pregame meeting will be rushed if it is held just minutes before kickoff.\n\nOnce the referee has contacted the school, the referee should provide the crew with all the information and specify the crew’s arrival time if crew members are arriving separately. After the crew has arrived and changed into game uniforms, the referee should lead the crew in a pregame conference.\n\nWhen the crew takes the field, each crew member has certain responsibilities, as detailed in this manual. Those responsibilities include field inspection, checking player equipment, checking the chain crew equipment and meeting with the chain crew, meeting with the clock operator, meeting with ball helpers, and checking and securing game balls.\n\nPregame administrative responsibilities should be conducted in a professional manner and should not be taken lightly. If game officials are diligent in conducting their pregame administrative tasks, the game will flow more smoothly and efficiently.\n\nCLOCK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe rule implementing the 40-second play clock that was passed recently by the NFHS created not only some subtle changes to clock management but also had direct impact on the pace of play.\n\nOccasionally, clock operators are volunteers, but in most cases they are hired by the home team and it is not unusual for them to be partisans. The vast majority of operators are ethical, reliable individuals who are burdened with multiple responsibilities. It is common for the game clock operator to also be responsible for maintaining the scoreboard. The latter duty requires the succeeding spot, down and distance to the line-to-gain to be updated promptly after each play. When a team achieves a first down inbounds, the game clock stops and is restarted when the referee signals. That interval should be no more than 3-5 seconds. The problem arises when the referee gives the start-the-clock signal – the “silent wind” – while the clock operator is working on the scoreboard console instead of watching the referee. The clock operator’s briefing should include a request to refrain from changing the scoreboard (down, distance and yard line where the ball is located) until the referee has restarted the game clock.\n\nAfter a first down inbounds, the ready-for-play occurs when the ball has been spotted and the game official who spotted the ball has stepped away into position. Under no circumstances should the ready be delayed if the chain crew is still moving and is not in position. In such a case, the linesman can drop a beanbag to mark the spot of the snap. In that situation, to ensure the game clock is promptly started, the referee should begin the silent wind when the umpire has possession and is about to spot the ball. That will compensate for the clock operator’s reaction time to the signal and ensure the game clock has been started and is running when the ball is snapped. The prompt starting of the game clock will ensure neither team gets an unfair time advantage especially during the last two minutes of a half. If the spotting of the ball is delayed for any reason e.g., wet ball, exceptionally long gain, etc., the referee can adjust accordingly by slightly delaying the silent wind.\n\nIf there is a visible play clock that is not being operated by an on-field official, play clock operators should be certified game officials who are knowledgeable of NFHS play clock rules. Operating the play clock is a more difficult proposition than operating the game clock. The game clock operator can adequately do the job by following on-field signals with only minimal knowledge of NFHS rules. The play clock operator frequently must act without a visible signal from a game official. Knowledge of the situations where a 40-second play clock is required versus a 25-second play clock is essential as is always keeping the referee in view for a play clock re-set signal.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF DEAD-BALL OFFICIATING\n\nDead-ball officiating may be viewed by some game officials as an afterthought and a time to take a break. However, when the ball becomes dead, it is the most critical time for game officials to continue to perform their duties in order to maintain decorum among opponents. Game officials should strive to be excellent dead-ball officials since the likelihood of fouls being committed is at perhaps its highest.\n\nDead-ball fouls include behavior that is outside of the normally accepted boundaries of football and can involve both players and nonplayers. Some examples are baiting and taunting, fighting, throwing equipment in frustration, verbal abuse of game officials, and initiating contact with an opponent after the play is over. Because this type of behavior tends to gender ill will between opponents, it is imperative that it is immediately recognized by game officials and penalized accordingly.\n\nNFHS football rules penalize unsportsmanlike actions in different ways:\n\nIllegal personal contact is a category of fouls that involve contact with an opponent. Frequently referred to as a personal foul, illegal personal contact can result in disqualification if the game officials deem the foul to be flagrant. Even though they may involve unsportsmanlike actions, penalties for dead-ball illegal personal contact fouls, with limited exceptions, are always enforced from the succeeding spot, the same way as penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced. While there are no rules mandating additional penalties for multiple illegal personal contact fouls committed by the same player or nonplayer, good dead-ball officiating will prevent participants from repeatedly committing\n\nthese types of fouls. Game officials must recognize situations where opponents are likely to commit dead-ball fouls and prevent them from happening through positioning and communication with players.\n\nUnsportsmanlike conduct fouls, by definition, are non-contact fouls (other than illegal participation) that do not influence a play. The penalties for these fouls are always enforced as dead-ball fouls (i.e., from the succeeding spot). When an unsportsmanlike conduct foul is judged to be flagrant or when any player or nonplayer commits two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls in the same game, the offender is disqualified. Unsportsmanlike conduct fouls cannot be combined with illegal personal contact fouls to disqualify an offender.\n\nRecognizing unsportsmanlike actions requires game officials to be familiar with and use approved mechanics. Since most dead-ball fouls occur within three seconds of the end of a play, maintaining appropriate distance and angles after a play ensures game officials who do not have runner responsibility will be positioned so that they can monitor areas around the ball. This “Halo Principle” allows effective coverage of all 22 players. Rather than rushing to retrieve the football or focusing on the area around the runner, game officials should gently pinch-in toward the nearest players keeping them within sight and sound until the opponents have separated and teams are on their own side of their line of scrimmage. This is particularly important after a touchdown or try, when multiple players and substitutes are intersecting as they enter or leave the field.\n\nUnderstanding the need to eliminate unsportsmanlike actions from the game, properly and consistently penalizing unsportsmanlike conduct and illegal personal contact and using NFHS-approved football game officials’ mechanics and officiating philosophies are all critical steps to improve sportsmanship in high school football.\n\n2024 NFHS Points of Emphasis\n\n2024 FOOTBALL POINTS OF EMPHASIS July 15, 2024\n\nSPORTSMANSHIP AND ALTERCATION PREVENTION AND PROTOCOL\n\nThe National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), state associations, coaches and game officials across the country are concerned as unsporting behavior in education-based athletics continues to escalate across all sports. A commitment to a collaborative, working relationship to promote good sportsmanship and teach and enforce NFHS rules and state association expectations is paramount to continue to safely conduct the game.\n\nEveryone associated with high school football has a role to play in creating a positive, sportsmanlike atmosphere at games. The NFHS must continue to address poor sporting behavior and promote the value of good sportsmanship. State associations must clearly set expectations in regard to unsportsmanlike behavior and enforce association rules regarding violations of those expectations. School administrators and coaches must teach, promote, model and set clear standards of behavior for themselves, players and fans. School administrators and coaches should also ensure that additional personnel on the sideline, outside the team box, adhere to set standards of sportsmanship. Game officials must fairly and consistently enforce NFHS rules in all aspects related to unsporting behavior by coaches and participants. Players and parents must model respect for coaches and game officials’ decisions, opponents and adhere to and promote the set expectations regarding sportsmanship.\n\nEveryone involved must clearly understand that education-based athletics is an extension of the classroom and is about more than just winning and losing, getting scholarships and gaining accolades. Education-based athletics is about learning, and the conduct and actions of everyone involved should reflect this.\n\nIn order to prevent unsportsmanlike issues from escalating please consider the following preventive protocols.\n\nFight or Altercation Protocol\n\nMost fights end quickly. Fights that escalate beyond the initial incident tend to do so because others run toward the fight. Running toward a fight normally contributes to the escalation of the altercation.\n\n1. Prepare before it happens. Make sure to instruct and even practice what to do in case an altercation occurs.\n\na. Assign specific coaches or administrators to run to the altercation to assist with breaking it up.\n\nb. Assign specific coaches to immediately step off the sideline and turn their attention to keeping the players on the sideline.\n\nc. Team members already on the field should distance themselves from the altercation.\n\nd. Educate all participants about the penalties associated with fighting, leaving the team area, taunting, using offensive gestures, and other unsportsmanlike acts.\n\ne. Instruct your video crew to continue to record or to start recording if an altercation occurs.\n\nf. Know where security is stationed.\n\ng. Keep all non-essential people off the sideline and preferably behind a fence or barrier.\n\n2. If an altercation does occur, execute the above plan.\n\n3. Once the participants are separated, keep them separated until play can safely resume or until administrators and game officials decide how to proceed.\n\n4. Do not allow teams to simultaneously use the same exits or occupy the same areas following an altercation or chippy contest.\n\nHandshake Line Protocol\n\n1. Administrators/security from both schools should be stationed on the field in close proximity to the handshake line.\n\n2. One team should be on the right and the other team should be on the left. Players from one team should not be allowed to walk down both sides of the line.\n\n3. Absolutely no non-essential personnel should be allowed on the field or sidelines until both teams have reached a designated area after completion of the handshake line.\n\n4. A coach or administrator should be stationed at the end of the handshake line to direct the players who have completed the line to a designated area on their end of the field. Do not allow the players to continue to the opposing sideline or to the other end of the field.\n\n5. Have one or more coaches at the front of the line and one or more at the end of the line.\n\nImproving the current state of the game regarding the prevalence of unsporting behavior requires that everyone involved commit to addressing the issue. Civility, even in the midst of intense competition, matters.\n\nPLAYER EQUIPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nTo support the safety of all participants, players must wear equipment and uniforms that are properly fitted and worn as intended by the manufacturer. Before starting each game, the head coach must verify that all players are properly and legally equipped.\n\nThe use of knee pads is an area targeted for emphasis. Due to potential injury, it is essential that players only be allowed to participate if their pants and knee pads comply with the rules. Pants must completely cover the knees, and knee pads must be worn over the knee. In pregame duties, game officials should be watchful and proactive in addressing potential equipment, and more specifically, knee pad issues. Players often wear pants that slide up and expose the knee during movement. Game officials should communicate with coaches and/or players and ensure that only legally and properly equipped players are allowed to participate – noncompliance results in nonparticipation.\n\nIt is the shared responsibility of the coaches, players and game officials to closely monitor equipment issues and act in accordance with NFHS football playing rules on this subject. The specific areas of concern include the wearing of mandatory equipment by each player at all times while the ball is live, properly wearing any mandatory/legal equipment as intended by the manufacturer, and avoiding the use of any illegal equipment at any time by any player. It must be noted that NFHS Football Rules 3-5-10e and 9-8-1h directly address the correct enforcement for violations of these specific equipment rules. Coaches, game officials and players should work together and support the safety of all participants by ensuring that NFHS football equipment and uniform rules are followed.\n\nFORMATIONS\n\nOver the past several years, there has been a considerable decline by many teams in their efforts to line up legally. There has also been a decrease by game officials with enforcement of illegal formations, especially involving offensive linemen. Linemen are legally on the line of scrimmage when they face their opponent’s goal line and have head or foot breaking the imaginary plane through the waist of the snapper. It has become fairly common to see guards or tackles line up a yard or two off the ball to aid in pass blocking or pulling. Doing so provides a significant advantage for the offense and should be addressed at the first opportunity by coaches and game officials.\n\nA back is an “A” player who has no part of his body breaking the plane of the waist of the nearest teammate who is on the line of scrimmage. Formations become illegal when backs are not clearly in the backfield. If an offensive player lines up by intersecting the waistline of the tackle, but not the center, Team A has committed an illegal formation foul because all Team A players must be a lineman or back. Receivers who wish to line up as a back should have “daylight” between the rear end of the nearest lineman and their nearest body part. Communicating with the line of scrimmage official on your side of the field is the best way to avoid a formation foul.\n\nAll coaches should spend time learning and periodically reviewing the current NFHS football playing rules so they can effectively pass correct information on to their players. Someone on the coaching staff should be assigned to monitor player compliance and understanding of formation rules during practice and game play. Early and consistent communication between coaches, players and game officials will permit the game to proceed with less disruption to the flow.\n\nGame officials should monitor pre-game warm-up and communicate (through coaches) to allow them to correct borderline or illegal formation issues they have observed. Once the contest begins, preventive officiating skills should be used at the earliest opportunity to allow coaches to make adjustments before formation issues become egregious. However, formations that clearly and obviously do not meet the specifications of NFHS Football Rules 2-32-3, 2-32-9 and 7-2 must be penalized as fouls without warning.\n\nHelmet to Helmet Emphasis\n\nEducation – along with proper football techniques – is one of the biggest deterrents to concussions and one of the keys to athletes being treated properly if one does occur\n\nDirect helmet-to-helmet contact and any other contact both with and to the helmet must be eliminated from the sport of football at the interscholastic level! Using the helmet to inflict punishment on the opponent is dangerous and illegal. Coaches and game officials must be diligent in promoting the elimination of contact to and with the helmet, as follows:\n\n• Coaches -- through consistent adherence to proper and legal coaching techniques.\n\n• Game Officials -- through strict enforcement of pertinent playing rules and game administrations.\n\nCoaches must insist that players play “heads-up” football by utilizing proper and safe techniques, - not only during games, but on the practice field as well. Coaches must shoulder the responsibility of consistently reinforcing with their players that using the top or face of the helmet goes against all tenets of the basic techniques of safe and legal blocking and tackling.\n\nThe No. 1 responsibility for game officials must be player safety. Any initiation of contact with the helmet is illegal; therefore, it must be penalized consistently and without warning. Player safety is really a matter of attitude, technique, attention and supervision. Football players will perform as they are taught; therefore, there must be a concentrated focus on consistently enforcing the existing rules. And contrary to most other rule enforcements, when in doubt, contact to and with the helmet should be ruled as a foul by game officials. Contact to and with the helmet may be considered a flagrant act and may be penalized by disqualification if a game official considers the foul so severe or extreme that it places an opponent in danger of serious injury.\n\nNOCSAE - Third Party Helmet Add-On\n\nNFHS Information\n\nNOCSAE Statement - Add-Ons (2018) | NOCSAE Statement - Add-ons\n\nThe NFHS does not perform scientific tests on any specific items of equipment to determine if the equipment poses undue risks to the student-athletes, coaches, officials or spectators. Such determinations are the responsibility of equipment manufacturers, and we rely heavily on products meeting NOCSAE standards.\n\nNFHS Football Rule 1-5-1a states, in part, that “A helmet and facemask which met the NOCSAE test standard at the time of manufacture…” is required. A consideration in determining whether add-on helmet attachments are legal is that our rule specifies only that the helmet had to meet the NOCSAE test standard at the time of manufacture; helmet add-ons typically are added after the time of helmet manufacture.\n\nThe attached NOCSAE Statement gives manufacturers of add-on attachments (in the fourth bullet) the option to have helmets tested with the helmet add-on attached; however, this would presumably require such manufacturers to test every make and model of helmet with their add-on attached.\n\nThe third bullet of the NOCSAE Statement gives the right to helmet manufacturers to determine, under the NOCSAE standards, whether given helmet add-on items would render the certification void. While that may occur, we have no information that it has happened yet.\n\nIn the interim, absent decisions by the helmet manufacturers, under the NOCSAE standards, to declare their certifications void pursuant to the third bullet point, or absent further revisions of the pertinent NOCSAE Statement, or absent an NFHS football rules change, our position about the permissive use of such helmet add-ons remains unchanged from last August.\n\nWe know and understand that this position by NFHS is not as proactive as some may wish as to whether given helmet add-ons should be considered legal; however, when considering the NOCSAE Statement and the applicable rules, the NFHS is not in a position to change our Rules Review Committee determination that such equipment is permissive.\n\nNOCSAE statement on third party helmet add-on products and certification\n\nThere are many new products on the market that are intended to be added to helmets, in particular football helmets, which products claim to reduce concussions and make helmets safer and more protective. Read the entire NOCSAE Position Statement.\n\nCPSC/CDC 4 Quarters of FB Helmet Safety Publication\n\nhttps://nfhs.org/media/869193/348-3.pdf\n\nTargeting\n\nMinimizing risk for all participants is the number one priority.\n\nWhen in doubt as to whether or not a targeting foul has occurred - game officials will be instructed to call targeting.\n\nWhen in doubt as to whether or not a flagrant targeting foul has been committed - game officials will be instructed to classify the foul as flagrant and disqualify the offending player.\n\nWIAA Adaptations to NFHS Rules\n\nWIAA Adaptations to NFHS Rules -- Print and place in your rules book for reference.\n\nWIAA Overtime Procedure\n\nThe WIAA will continue using the Overtime Procedures used during previous years.\n\nNew NCAA Overtime Procedures for 2021 will be monitored and reviewed during the NCAA season ahead.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\n25-YARD LINE OVERTIME PROCEDURE\n\nWIAA ADAPTATION\n\nof the\n\nNCAA FOOTBALL 25-YARD LINE OVERTIME PROCEDURE\n\nNote: In the text that follows the word “inning” is used but alternate wording is given in the square brackets “[ ].”\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe 25-yard line overtime procedure to resolve tied games adopted by the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association for the 2011 football season and beyond incorporates elements of the NCAA tie breaker system modified to comply with football rules published by the National Federation of State High School Associations.\n\nhttps://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Sports/Football/tie-breakersystem.pdf"
