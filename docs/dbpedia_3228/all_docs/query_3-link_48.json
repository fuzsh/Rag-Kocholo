        "text": "August 17th, 2021\n\nScuba diving provides a wonderful bonding experience for families and it is something mothers and daughters can do together.\n\nCREDITS | Text and Images Kate Jonker\n\nAs a \"Scuba Girl\" myself, I am often asked why I love scuba diving. There are so many reasons, and these vary from person to person.\n\nWhen I decided to learn to scuba dive, my friends thought I was crazy. “Women can’t scuba dive!” they said… “What about all that heavy stuff?” … “Only guys dive and they’ll just look at you as a burden” …. “It’s just not something women do!”\n\nThose comments were made by my non-scuba diving friends (male and female). After seeing how much fun I was having, however, they have dived right in and are now fellow scuba divers. And loving it, too!\n\nWhen I started diving, I was the only woman on my Open Water Scuba Diver Course. I was only one of two ladies on my Advanced Course. At that time there were less women in our diving group than men. But that did not bother us - we all absolutely loved Scuba Diving!\n\nWomen just know how to stay calm under any situation.\n\nSo, what kind of women love scuba diving?\n\nThe ladies that belonged to my dive club came from all age groups and levels of fitness. We had a 16-year-old learning to dive with her 40-year-old mother. We had a grandmother of fifty-six as well as women who participated in triathlons. In addition, there were some ladies whose only exercise was the walk from the car into the Wimpy. We all kept up with the boys, carried our own weights and cylinders. Not to mention that we were often able to beat the boys at their joke telling!\n\nScuba diving brings us new opportunities for adventure.\n\nWhy do women learn to scuba dive?\n\nThat was 22 years ago. Nowadays the men taking scuba classes are being outnumbered by the ladies. Quite a few of our students learn to dive so that they can join their partners on diving trips. They do not want to be left on the shore any longer! In general, we do not want to listen to how great the dive was - we want to experience it for ourselves.\n\nOther reasons for the increase in ladies wanting to learn to dive is that they want to try something different. Or they “just always wanted to do it but never found the right person to teach them.” Whatever the reason, after their first dives most are absolutely hooked. Already in love with scuba diving, they are eager for their next dive!\n\nScuba diving takes us to a whole new world!\n\nScuba diving is easier than you think...\n\nAlthough scuba diving does require a certain level of strength and fitness, it is not as strenuous as one expects. The bonus is, the more you dive, the fitter you become. Even if you can do it all yourself, there is always a gentleman somewhere wanting to help. Swallow your pride ladies, let them carry your weight belt or cylinder, just smile, and say, “thank you!” I am still teased for growling back \"I can do it myself\" all those years ago. It earned me the nickname \"Kwaai Kate\". Nowadays, I smile and am grateful.\n\nDiving can push us out of our comfort zones and build confidence in ourselves!\n\nNot always glamorous\n\nI won’t deny that there are a couple of minor drawbacks of being a female diver. For example – those neatly manicured long nails – they will not stay like this for long. Nails break easily, usually when pulling on wetsuits, picking up weights and climbing over rocks. The solution – keep your nails short. Long hair can also be a problem. If yours is like mine, you will always have a bird’s nest / dreadlock hairdo after diving. However, plaiting your hair or simply saturating your hair with fresh water before a dive can help.\n\nShore diving comes with its own challenges. How often will you find a bathroom on a remote beach? Guys have it easy. We must find a bush or make a plan. It is all about being creative - and we are good at that, right? But then, there may be some gentlemen reading this, so we will chat about this on our next dive, OK?\n\nWomen know how to have fun!\n\nAmazing benefits\n\nDiving really is an amazing sport for women. For instance, the places it can take you to, the great people you meet and the wonderful things you see. There is nothing like it! Coupled with the feeling of total peace during a dive makes this an unbeatable sport. You will feel so relaxed after diving, too. So, if you have not taken the plunge already - sign up for an Open Water Diver Course right now! You will soon realise why women just like you love scuba diving!\n\nNOTE:\n\nHere are a few women related articles on the blog. We know many of you will have concerns.
