        "text": "Over the past month we've been featuring some of the best nicknames in high school sports, with an end goal of determining the fans' favorite.\n\nWe've built 12 brackets of 15 teams each, and we'll roll out three brackets a week.\n\nWe recently released the Pun Bracket, featuring 15 outstanding high school sports nicknames rife with word play. Descriptions of each are below the poll.\n\nBest high school mascots in America: 15 most unique nicknames (Pun Bracket)\n\nNow, we want to hear from you: Which is the best nickname in the bracket?\n\nVote in the poll to pick your favorite, and the winner will advance to the Dandy Dozen Championship Bracket.\n\nPun Bracket voting will conclude Saturday, Oct. 8, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n(Punahou alum Manti Te'o photo by Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nKey Obezags (Maryland)\n\nWhen the property on which the school was built was donated, it was filled with gazebos. The students voted and decided to spell gazebo backwards as their nickname.\n\nArchbishop Molloy Stanners (New York)\n\nArchbishop Molloy used to be called St. Ann’s Academy, and the students were known as \"St. Ann-ers,” which evolved into the easier-to-say Stanners. And since Stanners is definitely easier to say than “Molloyers,” it stuck.\n\nThe Webb School Feet (Tennessee)\n\nWord has it that when looking for a name for the school’s sports teams, Webb students heard there was a California school called the Argyle Socks. And then in 1973-74, the Webb Feet of Tennessee were born.\n\nCameron Yoe Yoemen (Texas)\n\nThe school did some real yeoman’s work coming up with this nickname.\n\nRising Sun Shiners (Indiana)\n\nThe school’s logo is backed by a nice, bright sun, so it’s definitely going for a reference to the city’s starry name rather than the slang term for a black eye.\n\nDell Rapids Quarriers (South Dakota)\n\nStep aside, all you Warriors. Here come the Quarriers, named after the large Sioux Quartzite rock quarries that are also in Dell Rapids.\n\nClay-Battelle Cee Bees (West Virginia)\n\nIf every hyphenated school used its initials as its nickname, there’d be a whole lot more competitors with the Eagles and Tigers as the most common team name. But they don’t, so the Cee Bees stand out.\n\nFlintridge Sacred Heart Academy Tologs (California)\n\nYou mean you don’t know what a Tolog is? Obviously it’s an acronym devised by the FSHA Class of 1948 meaning “To Our Lady of Good Success.” Jeez. Study more.\n\nCoal City Coalers (Illinois)\n\nCoal City must have roots in Occam’s razor: a philosophical principle that states the simplest explanation is usually the best one.\n\nAndrean Fighting 59ers (Indiana)\n\nNope, not the 49ers, and for good reason. Not only was Andrean founded in 1959, but its address is 5959 Broadway.\n\nLejeune Devilpups (North Carolina)\n\nThe Lejeune students in 1944 to took the moniker “Devilpups,\" a reference to the Marine Corps nickname of Devil Dog and Camp Lejeune being a Marine Corps base.\n\nPunahou Buff 'n Blue (Hawaii)\n\nPunahou doesn’t have a physical mascot, but its teams are named for the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach.\n\nPoca Dots (West Virginia)\n\nOn Friday nights, you can find a mean-looking red dot with arms and legs patrolling the sidelines for Poca. The school received its fitting nickname nearly a century ago from a local reporter, and it's stuck ever since.\n\nGwinn Modeltowners (Michigan)\n\nGwinn became known as a “Model Town” for miners in the early 1900s, so naturally the high school sports teams called themselves the Modeltowners.\n\nHampshire Whip-Purs (Illinois)\n\n“Whi-Pur” won the school’s mascot contest in the 1940s. The school’s colors were white and purple, so “Whi-Pur” shortened that. At some point it evolved into Whip-Pur to make it look more like a real word, and that became an important part of the original mascot drawing (a cat holding a whip).\n\nSheldon Orabs (Iowa)\n\nSheldon and Hampshire must have shared the same playbook. They’re about 500 miles apart, but the Orabs’ story is startlingly similar to the Whip-Purs’, just with different colors. The Orabs’ school colors are orange and black, and in a contest in the 1920s to name the mascot, Orabs (orange and black) took the prize."
