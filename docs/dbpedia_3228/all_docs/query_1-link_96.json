        "text": "OCTOPUSH.JPG\n\nMembers of the Corvallis Narwhals observe as Mark Swick takes the puck to the goal during an underwater hockey game. Players use snorkeling gear to dive into the water for short spurts.\n\n(KOJI WIEBER/The Pride)\n\nThe smell of chlorine fills the air of the Osborn Aquatic Center in Corvallis as two teams of men and women hold the rail of opposite sides of the pool with vicelike grips.\n\nDonning swim caps, snorkelers, gloves and fins, 12 swimmers eagerly await three magical words so they can charge at a 3-pound, bright pink puck at the bottom of the pool.\n\n“Black! White! Go!”\n\nStudent tries octopush\n\nI was on the verge of panic when I showed up at the pool to test the waters of underwater hockey.\n\nI’m generally uncomfortable in the water, which is a problem in a sport where relaxation is key, says Shawn Tucker, organizer of the Corvallis Narwhals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tucker explained the rules as I put on loaner fins, a swim cap, a mask, a snorkel and a glove. When I jumped into the water, I briefly thought I’d have a smooth transition.\n\nI was sadly mistaken.\n\nI struggled with the snorkel, choking on water and getting some in my nose.\n\nA few minutes later, Shawn and his team showed me how the game was supposed to be played. As the two teams smoothly navigated around the pool, I struggled to stay afloat, gasping for air and grabbing the wall for support as I tried to shoot underwater video.\n\nIt’s funny how some trying experiences can be memorable. Even as I tightly gripped the edge of the pool -- with my ears throbbing and my legs exhausted -- I couldn’t help but be grateful for something I’ll always remember.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe I’ll even suit up and play in Portland one day.\n\n-- Koji Wieber, Grant High School sophomore\n\nThe players push off the walls, disappearing into the blue water like dolphins diving into the ocean. Seven feet below, they resemble a feeding frenzy as they attack the puck with short black and white sticks and try to maneuver it towards a metal trough.\n\nWelcome to the world of underwater hockey.\n\nEvery Wednesday, the Corvallis Narwhals gather at the swim center to practice a sport so under the radar in the United States that slightly more than 60 clubs operate across the country.\n\nMore cities are catching on to the trend. Just a year and a half ago, a Portland enthusiast started his own club and another group has started in Newport. As the game steadily gains players and recognition, the Corvallis Narwhals and other clubs are helping underwater hockey evolve into a household name rather than just an absurd concept.\n\n'No other sport like it'\n\nWhat started in the 1950s as a two-on-two hobby in England has transformed into a fast-paced, six-on-six sport known around the globe.\n\nThe rules of the game are fairly basic: Six players from each team dive under the water in 10- to 15-second spurts, using 350-millimeter sticks to navigate a 3-pound lead puck into a 3-meter-wide goal. The swimmers use snorkels, masks, gloves and fins during the game, which usually consists of two 15-minute halves.\n\nNarwhals organizer Shawn Tucker said there’s no other sport like it. “With soccer, bowling or badminton, you get to breathe,” he said.\n\nWhile some parts of America are becoming increasingly aware of the sport, underwater hockey has always been bigger internationally, with teams from England, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa dominating in international competitions.\n\nSean Avent, Northwest regional development director for USA Underwater Hockey, said Corvallis is one of more than 10 clubs sprinkled throughout the West Coast.\n\nTucker caught word of a new underwater hockey club in Corvallis in 1997 and eventually took over as organizer. In a town of 50,000 people, finding underwater hockey enthusiasts is like “finding a needle in a haystack,” he said.\n\nPlayers say the sport is typically greeted with a chuckle and \"Is that a real thing?\" due to the attire and unusual concept.\n\n“It’s a silly sport, but not in a stupid way,” said Narwhals member Cate Dolan, who is so dedicated to the sport that she sometimes practices with a tuna can.\n\nThough the game can be intimidating, teams tend to be inviting and develop strong bonds, which keeps people coming back. Devlin Gray, a fairly recent addition to the Corvallis team, said weekly visits to the Flat Tail Brewery after a scrimmage bring the team together.\n\nAn equalizer\n\nSince the sport is played underwater, the sport is advantageous to people who find it hard to run or play contact sports. Because of that, the sport serves as an equalizer of sorts.\n\nDolan recalls a pregnant woman from Australia playing three days before she gave birth. “She was still schooling everyone,” she said.\n\nThe trick to success isn’t necessarily strength or speed -- relaxation and timing are more vital. When Tucker dove into a 13-foot diving well in 1994 for his first game, he immediately shot back up to the surface after running out of breath.\n\n“You really have to learn how to relax, control yourself and exert your body,” he said.\n\nThe unfamiliarity of the sport may make some people shy away, but enthusiasts believe the sport will continue to gain attention. Jorge Filevich, the creator of the underwater hockey club in Portland, believes clubs will grow steadily, though at a slow pace.\n\n“You need somebody who knows how to play to start playing” and start a club, then wait for it to gain traction, he said.\n\nOther underwater hockey enthusiasts, like Eugene native Mark Swick, think it won’t be long before the sport is as common as water polo.\n\n“It’s sweeping the nation,” Swick said recently as he took a break after a play in Corvallis. “Everyone’s going to try it.”\n\n-- Savannah Cha, Parkrose High School sophomore\n\n-- Koji Wieber, Grant High School sophomore"
