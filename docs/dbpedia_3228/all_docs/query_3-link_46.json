        "text": "The long summer holidays are here at last! With the days ahead stretching out ahead, it would be a shame to waste the seemingly endless sunshine. Why not grab a friend or 2 and take the chance to try something new? If you’re stuck for ideas, here are a selection of 7 unusual sports that are well worth giving a go!\n\nUnderwater Hockey\n\nFootvolley\n\nSepak Takraw\n\nDisc Golf\n\nQuidditch / Quadball\n\nCycleball\n\nKabaddi\n\nUnderwater Hockey\n\nInvented in the UK in 1954, this sport is exactly what is sounds like – it’s hockey, but underwater! Also known as Octopush, the sport was quickly welcomed in other countries such as South Africa in 1957. There are 10 players on each team, with 6 in play at a time. Players hold their breath and push the puck at the bottom of the swimming pool to try and score a goal. The goals are weighted down to the bottom of the pool at each end of the playing area, and consist of a shallow slope leading to a trough for the puck to be pushed or flicked into.\n\nCheck out the British Octopush Association website for more info.\n\nImage Source: Pexels\n\nFootvolley\n\nThe UK Footvolley Association describes their sport as “beach volleyball with football rules.” Having evolved from the age old fun of Keepy-Uppy, footvolley is now played on all 5 continents and so enjoys a number of large tournaments, including a World Cup. For any youngsters who are keen on on football, the move into footvolley is a relatively easy one which many famous footballers have made. Ronaldinho, David Beckham and Christiano Ronaldo are all lovers of the sport apparently! Needing only a ball, low net and a bit of space, footvolley is fairly easy to try. As a result, it’s popularity is continuing to grow.\n\nImage Source: Pexels\n\nSepak Takraw\n\nKeeping along the lines of volleyball variations, sepak takraw is also reffered to as Kick Volleyball. “Takraw” is the Thai word for the original ball used for the sport, which was made traditionally of hand woven rattan.\n\nAs the nickname of Kick Volleyball implies, players may not use their hands. Instead, they must use their feet, head, knees and chest to try and entice the opposing team to make a fault, thereby earning themselves a point. Teams are made up of three players each, and the first team to make it to 21 points wins the match. It’s a “best out of three” situation, with the overall winning team reaching 21 first in at least 2 matches.\n\nFor more details on how and where to play the game, visit the English Sepak Takraw Association website.\n\nImage Source: Pixabay\n\nDisc Golf\n\nThis is one of the more well-known sports to make our list. You may know it as Frisbee Golf, a name which accurately describes the two sports that this one combines. Played on a course of 9 or 18 holes, participants throw a disc from a tee pad towards a target, known as a basket. The baskets are usually made of wire and/or metal and have hanging chains designed to catch the frisbees. Players count how many throws it takes to reach the basket from the tee pad to get their score. Each hole has a par, or number of strokes it would take in expert player to complete it.\n\nVisit the Disc Golf UK website to find your nearest course.\n\nImage Source: Pixabay\n\nQuidditch / Quadball\n\nYes, it is an actual, real sport! Originally conceived by author JK Rowling for the Harry Potter book series, it became a reality in 2005.\n\nPlayers have one of several roles, including a Keeper, Seeker, Chasers and Beaters, but they all run around holding poles like broomsticks. We’re not kidding. The aim is to score the most number of points, with Chasers scoring goals in three uneven hoops set on opposite ends of the playing field. An impartial player called the Snitch is dressed in yellow and runs around the vicinity of the playing area, trying not to be caught by each team’s Seeker. They can run anywhere, into the crowd for example! When they are caught, the Seeker who completed the catch earns their team 30 points.\n\nThere are more rules, depending on which level you play the sport at, such as timing handicaps for the Snitch for example. The Quidditch UK website has loads of information for prospective players. To be honest, watching the videos on Youtube is pretty entertaining as well.\n\nImage Source: Pixabay\n\nCycleball\n\nAnother unexpected sport with a World Cup, cycleball involves players scoring goals in teams of two. However, players cannot actually touch the ball they are using. The ball can only be moved using bicycles, which the players are riding. At no point may a players foot touch the ground, requiring some pretty impressive balancing skills. One of the most watched cycleball competitions is even held as part of the annual UCI World Indoor Cycling Championships.\n\nIf you fancy competing in the World Championships in Glasgow 2023, have a read of the Home of British Cycleball website.\n\nImage Source: Pexels\n\nKabaddi\n\nBy far the most popular sport on our list, this relatively unknown game in the UK is the national sport of Bangladesh. Each team consists of 7 players, with one player at a time acting as the “raider” who enters the opposing team’s side attempts to touch out as many of the defenders as possible and return to their side… all in one breath! Apart from a playing area and teammates, Kabaddi doesn’t need anything else to play. As a contact sport, Kabaddi does have a higher injury level than most of the other sports we have mentioned, so we suggest taking care if you try this one out.\n\nThe England Kabaddi Association is affiliated with World Kabaddi and its website is a great resource.\n\nImage Source: Pexels\n\nHave you tried any of these unusual sports?\n\nLet us know if you give any of these unusual sports a go this summer.
