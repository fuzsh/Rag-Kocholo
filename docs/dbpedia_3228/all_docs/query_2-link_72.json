After two years of renovations, it has now been enlarged to about 98,000 square meters, looking like an \"ice brick\" embedded in the original building, according to the account.\n\nDuring the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the National Stadium will host all men's ice hockey events, some of the women's ice hockey finals, as well as the ice sled and ice hockey events for the Paralympic Winter Games, Beijing Daily reported on Sunday."
