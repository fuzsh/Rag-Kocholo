        "text": "I play it with my university club at plymouth, it says non contact but thats more like a guide line as far as i can tell, just no blatant contact ahah. it an amazing sport and probably the only reason student life hasnt made me a fat slob, also i meet many awesome people which is how i found out about freediving and spearfishing as these things seem to go hand in hand with uwh, its just a shame the weather is terrible at the moment because i want to go in the sea again\n\nI used to play, but gave it up after too many injuries.\n\nThe normal, black eye, bloody nose, fin kick to the balls weren't so bad that I would quit, but I had a puck hit my mask and knock out the lens of my Sphera- which left a nice cut below my eye. That healed but later on the following season I got hit pretty hard by two players at once. I heard my neck go crunch, felt my arm go numb, and then the headaches started. :crutch\n\nAfter x-rays, doctor appointments, and many chiropractor visits I decided that I'd had enough. actually, my docotrs told me I had enough. I still have neck/head pains from time to time as a result of it.\n\nIt was/is a great work out, and a fun way to pass the time when there's a couple of feet of snow on the ground. From time to time I'll go in and video the games. It's sort of a work out and we get to drink beer afterwards. :friday\n\nJon\n\nNo it isn't that non contact. It's kinda like how basketball is non contact. I play where I live, in sunny Singapore, where right now it's pissy as some parts of the UK. There's only one club here (our country is smaller than some states in the US).\n\nJon, bugger, how in the hell did you get all those injuries? Is that the way it's played in the US?\n\nHi,\n\nIf you live in Singapore and freedive you might like to check out Underwater rugby. We have recently started playing UWR here in NZ and were over in Sydney playing the Australian team a couple of weeks ago. I heard that a couple of the Singaporeans that used to play on the Australian team have set up a club back in Singapore. Rugby is not as frenetic as UWH. Dives are longer with more surface interval as it is played in a 5m deep pool so It's closer in many ways to freediving. It's also more acessible to newbies (with a good breath hold) as puck/stick skills are not required.\n\nPhil\n\nYeah, what's the story about Colombia anyway? Heard something about the NZ organisation or something putting their feet down and drawing a line... Well in anycase, you guys are welcome to join the Asian Underwater Hockey Championship. The Aussies played this year, time for the NZs to represent. And no, didn't play with the NZ team on their way to Durban last year. I wasn't around. Were you with them or something?\n\nHey Walid, good to hear UWR is popular there. How about UWH? We don't play UWR here unfortunately, but things may change.\n\nYes, there's of course a much lower risk of BO, due to the high CO2 present. I saw a couple of UWR players blacking out though.. it is an interesting sport for a freediver I guess,but it has much more benefits if it is played in a big swimming pool and at altitude of course, as I used to practice it. However I think it does not replace long breathold trainings, which requieres a complete different training.\n\nI rarely practice UWH, I find it less usefull, as a freediving training. I prefer a nice UWR match where I can grab the ball as long as possible underwater, or cross the 25m pool with already a huge O2 debt to the other side! of course it's not the best game strategy and I usually get scolded for my too long Apneas! I prefer the name \"Apnea with a ball\" rather than UWR."
