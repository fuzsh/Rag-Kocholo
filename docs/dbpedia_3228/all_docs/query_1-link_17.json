It is played by snorkeling down to the bottom of the pool to push a weighted puck along into the opposing team's goal.\n\n​Under the supportive umbrella of EUSAC, our underwater hockey club is called the Edinburgh Hippos which meet every Wednesday at 8:30pm and Friday at 8:15pm at Dalry Pool to train with our sister club Edinburgh Underwater Hockey Club. Wednesday night is game night while on a Friday we spend time perfecting our skills before having a wee game to end. We compete across the country with past players also representing Scotland and Great Britain at an international level.\n\nAll beginners are welcome... we all start somewhere! We have qualified coaches who can teach you everything you need to know. If you own any kit please bring it along but if not don't worry as we can provide equipment to get you started."
