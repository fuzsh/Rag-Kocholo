        "text": "Trying a new sport or competing against other staff and students can be a great way to meet new people. Take part in friendly competition and develop your skills and understanding of new sports or reignite a passion for a sport you once enjoyed.\n\nSome of our clubs compete in local leagues, student only Wednesday leagues and yearly intervarsity tournaments and competitions against other Universities and Colleges. We compete in both Student Sport Ireland (SSI) and British University Colleges Sports (BUCS) events and competitions.\n\nAll 54 student clubs at Queen's are constituted through the Students' Union. Clubs are normally comprised of an executive committee made up of a Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer who are all students at Queen's.\n\nRecently, clubs have incorporated officer roles for students to cover a wide range of areas including Sponsorship, Social, Safety, Fresher Liaison and IT.\n\nStudents can join a Sports Club by going onto the Students' Union Club Website.\n\nFind out more information regarding our Student Clubs development pathway for Athletes, Coaches and Clubs in our Student Clubs Pathway Booklet. Also, below are some FAQs related to our Sports Clubs.\n\nQueen's Sport's Off Peak membership offers students unrestricted access to club facilities at any time.\n\nSports Clubs FAQs\n\nStudent Club Pathway Booklet\n\nFor more information on club activity and opportunities to take part, use the the contacts below:-"
