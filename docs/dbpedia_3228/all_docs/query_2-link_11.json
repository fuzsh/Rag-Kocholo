        "text": "Nicknames have long been a popular concept for sports teams. The catchy monikers create unique personalities for teams and help inspire loyalty among fans by establishing a common connection.\n\nThe Australian national sports teams have embraced the trend wholeheartedly. With the Paris 2024 Olympics approaching, names such as the Dolphins, Hockeyroos, Olyroos, Opals, Matildas and many more will take centrestage.\n\nWhile many national sides draw inspiration from their history, culture or flag colours, the Australian national sports teams have traditionally drawn from the iconic and endemic wildlife Down Under for their monikers.\n\nThe Australian men’s field hockey team (Kookaburras) and the women’s team (Hockeyroos) celebrate an iconic native bird and the kangaroo, respectively.\n\nThe Aussie 3x3 basketball team is called the Gangurrus, the original name of the eastern grey kangaroo as called by the Guugu Yimithirr people of far north Queensland.\n\nThe Australian men's football team is known as the Socceroos while the Australian men’s team for the Olympics, which consists mostly of the U23 players, is known as the Olyroos. Both names are also inspired by kangaroos, the country’s national animal which also represents Australia’s strength and fighting spirit.\n\nThe name Boomers for the Australian men’s basketball team has also been inspired by native slang for male kangaroos.\n\nHowever, wildlife isn’t the only inspiration behind Australian national teams’ nicknames.\n\nMatildas, used by the Australian women’s national football team, comes from the 19th-century folk song Waltzing Matilda, which is a big part of Australia’s cultural heritage.\n\nThe name Opals for the women’s basketball team, meanwhile, has been inspired by the gemstone found in the Australian seas.\n\nThe Australian water polo teams have been christened the Aussie Sharks (men) and Aussie Stingers (women), reflecting Australia's strong connections with the three oceans surrounding the continent.\n\nThe names Dolphins and Australian Flames are gender-neutral monikers for the Aussie swimming and track-and-field teams, respectively. The Australian volleyball, 3x3 basketball and badminton teams have also opted to stay gender-neutral.\n\nSurprisingly, national cricket teams in Australia don’t have any formal nicknames. The 'Baggy Greens' which refer to the caps the Australian men’s and women’s cricket players wear is as close as they get.\n\nThe Australian women’s team was called the Southern Stars but the name was dropped to ensure both men’s and women’s teams get referred to as the national teams.\n\nThe nickname Wallabies for the men's rugby union team, adopted in the early 20th century, evokes the image of a small, agile marsupial, symbolising the team's resilience. The women's rugby union team is similarly named the Wallaroos for a distinct identity.\n\nThe Australian rowing team got their moniker just ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The team's nickname Rowsellas was inspired by the bird rosella. It will be used for the men's, women's as well as Paralympic teams.\n\nThe nicknames of the Australian national sports teams not only celebrate the distinctiveness of Australian wildlife but also foster a sense of national identity and pride for Australians globally.\n\nNicknames of the Australian national sports teams"
