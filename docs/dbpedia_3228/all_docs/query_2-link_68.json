        "text": "You may know Michigan Stadium as “The Big House” but do you remember who made the term famous?\n\nWhat about the mystery object that may or may not be buried underneath it? (Hint: It's not Jimmy Hoffa).\n\nAnd did you know you have Michigan to thank for the origins of a certain object that is now found in every stadium across the land?\n\nJoin us on a spin through some of the things that make Michigan Stadium like no other football field in the land.\n\n(Special thanks to the Bentley Historical Library for the use of several images as well as information.)\n\nWhere did the ‘Big House’ nickname originate?\n\nThe nickname “Big House” was used for Michigan Stadium in a Sept. 13, 1985 Detroit Free Press story, in which Notre Dame running back Allen Pinkett was quoted, “ … I’m looking forward to playing against (Michigan) in the Big House …,” alluding to the then-101,701-seat Michigan Stadium.\n\nIt’s unclear whether that was the very first time the moniker was used, but its origins trace back to the 1980s.\n\nKeith Jackson, the retired, legendary broadcaster for ABC Sports, is credited with coining the term “Big House,” but it’s unclear what year he did so. Without question, Jackson popularized the term.\n\nIt started at the Miller family farm\n\nMichigan Stadium was built at the site of the Miller family farm, which featured a barn, a strawberry patch and an underground spring. The site is located across the railroad track from the Wolverines' previous stadium, Ferry Field.\n\nIn 1925, the university purchased the land -- a tract of 16 acres and 119 city lots -- for $239,000. That included the cost of several lots, which were acquired via condemnation procedures.\n\nThe land gradually sloped from the valley of the old Allen's Creek, which was diverted underground, and rose to the level of South Main Street.\n\nA big portion of the low-lying land was swampy. The underground spring had served as a source for the University of Michigan's water needs in the university's earlier days.\n\nMichigan athletic director and former coach Fielding Yost chats with a Michigan Stadium site contractor during the construction of the stadium. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nCost of Michigan Stadium construction\n\nThe price tag for the construction of Michigan Stadium in 1927 was just shy of $1 million, specifically at $950,000. Today, that amount would equate to more than $13 million.\n\nAt the time of construction, the stadium contained 70 rows and was designed to seat 72,000 fans.\n\nWith the addition of wooden bleachers, the capacity increased to 84,401.\n\nCranes work on excavation during the construction of Michigan Stadium. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nCrane buried beneath the stadium?\n\nThe underground spring on the land where Michigan Stadium was built had been capable of delivering 300 gallons of water per minute. The water posed a problem during construction, so the land had to be lowered to take care of an underground lake.\n\nThe surface was quicksand-like and, during construction, a crane was swallowed up. According to legend, the crane remains buried beneath the stadium’s surface today.\n\nThe high water table led to nearly three-quarters of Michigan Stadium being built below ground level.\n\nMichigan all-around star Louis Gilbert is shown running with the ball during the first-ever game at Michigan Stadium, a 33-0 win over Ohio Wesleyan on Oct. 1, 1927. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nFirst game in Michigan Stadium\n\nOn Oct. 1, 1927, the first game was played in Michigan Stadium. Michigan defeated Ohio Wesleyan, 33-0. More than 40,000 people witnessed the game, which was played in rainy conditions.\n\nAll-around star Louis Gilbert factored into each of the Wolverines’ scores. Bennie Oosterbaan was a team captain that season, and he scored one of the touchdowns during the inaugural game at Michigan Stadium.\n\nThree weeks later, the stadium was dedicated in the Wolverines' 19-0 victory over Ohio State. A then-record crowd of 84,401 attending the dedication game on Oct. 22, 1927.\n\nThis is how the scoreboard appeared at Michigan Stadium in 1930. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nFirst stadium to use electronic scoreboards\n\nMichigan Stadium was the first to use electronic scoreboards as official time, doing so when it installed electronic scoreboards at both ends of the stadium in 1930.\n\nFor years, Michigan Stadium was one of few college stadiums to feature video scoreboards on each end of its facility.\n\nIn August 1968, the scoreboards at each end of the stadium were replaced at a cost of $75,000.\n\nHere is an aerial photo of Michigan Stadium in 1949, when steel bleachers replaced wooden bleachers during an expansion project. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nSteel stands replace wooden bleachers\n\nTwenty-one years after the stadium capacity was increased to 85,753, Michigan Stadium’s wooden bleachers were replaced by steel stands in 1949. That change raised the stadium’s capacity to 97,239.\n\nThat year, Michigan led the nation in average attendance with 93,894 for its six home games. It was the first year that NCAA attendance records were kept. The Wolverines’ closest competitor was Ohio State, which averaged 76,429.\n\nAn aerial photo of Michigan Stadium is shown from 1956 when the Wolverines had their first crowd of more than 100,000. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nCapacity exceeds 100,000 in 1956\n\nMichigan Stadium’s capacity is increased again, expanding to 101,001 in 1956.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 1956, Michigan Stadium hosted more than 100,000 people for the first time as the Wolverines took on Michigan State.\n\nThat year, a state-of-the-art pressbox was added as well. The price tag for the pressbox was $700,000. It was dedicated on Sept. 22, 1956.\n\nArtificial turf is installed in Michigan Stadium for the first time in 1969. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nArtificial turf goes in for the first time\n\nIn June 1969, U-M Regents approved installation of artificial turf after it became evident that turf would require less maintenance than grass and could withstand any type of weather.\n\nThe following month, 88,285 feet of Tartan Turf was installed at a cost of $250,000.\n\nThe artificial turf was torn out and the playing surface was lowered 3 1/2 feet as natural grass returned to Michigan Stadium in 1991. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nNatural grass returns in 1991\n\nIn May 1991, Michigan Stadium returned to a natural-grass playing surface as 87,000 feet of Prescription Athletic Turf was installed. Eight thousand square yards of sod were brought in for the playing surface, which was lowered 3 ½ feet to facilitate better sightlines for those seated in the lower rows.\n\nThe conversion from artificial turf to natural grass cost $2.25 million.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1991, Michigan defeated Notre Dame, 24-14, in the first Michigan Stadium game played on natural grass since 1968.\n\nFieldTurf is installed in Michigan Stadium in May 2003. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\nPlaying surface goes to FieldTurf in 2003\n\nFrom late-April to early-July in 2003, the playing surface at Michigan Stadium underwent another change. It went from natural grass back to an artificial surface, as FieldTurf replaced the Prescription Athletic Turf that had been in place since 1991.\n\nThe price tag was $620,000, which included the cost to install the FieldTurf and the fee to remove the existing surface and replace the urethane track around the field and tunnel. It also included a $46,000 donation by Ford Motor Company for the crushed rubber infill used in the FieldTurf.\n\nThe field’s dimensions are 360 by 160 feet.\n\nPeople stand at the front gate of Michigan Stadium before going in for an open house following the stadium renovations in 2009. (Lon Horwedel | MLive file photo)\n\nBig House gets big upgrades in 2009\n\nA $226 million renovation project in 2009 not only made Michigan Stadium the largest college football venue in the country again, but it enhanced the fan experience.\n\nThe project featured wider aisles, wider bench seats and more handicap-accessible seats, as well as more stadium access points. It offered elevated concourses with additional restrooms and concessions on both sidelines, plus buildings at both the north and south ends of the stadium which house additional restrooms, concessions and public safety services.\n\nA new press box was built on the west side, and four towers (one at each corner of the stadium) with elevators and wide stairways for access to the new concourses and premium seating areas.\n\nSeating was added to both the east and west sides of the stadium. The west side features 650-plus chairback seats and 46 suites split across the first two levels. On the east side, there are about 1,900 outdoor club seats, 250 indoor club seats and 850 covered club seats, with stadium lounges on the first and second level of the structure. There also are 36 suites on the third level.\n\nAn aerial view of Michigan Stadium is shown during the 1927 season, when the stadium's capacity was 72,000. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\n11 different seating capacities\n\nMichigan Stadium has featured nearly a dozen different seating capacities since opening in 1927.\n\nHere are the capacities in its 91 years of existence:\n\n72,000 (1927)\n\n84,401 (1927)\n\n85,753 (1928)\n\n97,239 (1949)\n\n101,001 (1956)\n\n101,701 (1973)\n\n102,501 (1992)\n\n107,501 (1998)\n\n102,601 (2008)\n\n109,901 (2010)\n\n107,601 (2015)\n\nAn aerial of Michigan Stadium is shown during the 1998 game against Syracuse. (Photo provided to MLive.com by Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)\n\n100,000-plus fans for 273 straight games and counting\n\nOn Nov. 8, 1975, Michigan shut out Purdue, 28-0, before a crowd of 102,415. That started the Wolverines’ streak of consecutive games at Michigan Stadium of crowds featuring 100,000-plus.\n\nThe streak is alive and well today, sitting at 273 straight home games of 100,000-plus fans entering the 2017 season.\n\nThe last time that Michigan Stadium did not have 100,000-plus in attendance for a Wolverines football game was on Oct. 25, 1975, when U-M beat Indiana before 93,857.\n\nNebraska holds the longest home sellout streak in college football with 354 games (dating back to Nov. 3, 1962), but Memorial Stadium’s capacity is 86,047, accommodating far fewer than the Big House.\n\nMichigan has led the nation in attendance for 41 of the past 43 seasons. The only seasons during that stretch in which the Wolverines did not rank No. 1 in attendance were 2014, when they were third, and 1997, when they were second.\n\nMichigan fans rush the field after the Wolverines' 12-10 win over Michigan State during the 2012 season.

The Wolverines also averaged 112,000-plus in 2011.\n\nU-M has averaged 111,000-plus fans in six seasons, and 110,000-plus in 15 seasons.\n\nMichigan fans wave pompoms as they cheer during the 2013 game against Notre Dame.

During that season, then-Michigan football coach and athletic director Fielding Yost worked out a deal with the zoo to have two of the wolverines transported to the stadium on football Saturdays.\n\nThe two wolverines, nicknamed “Biff” and “Bennie,” were paraded around Michigan Stadium in cages. That practice ended after a short time, however. As the story goes, Biff and Bennie grew larger and more ferocious, making it dangerous for them to be moved around near the public.\n\nIn 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine and a cage to keep it in to the University of Michigan. A contest was held to name the new mascot, and “Intrepidus” was the winner.\n\nNo live wolverines have been in Michigan Stadium in the last half-century.\n\nMichigan Stadium is shown under construction in 1927.

An announced crowd of 105,491 was reported, with 104,173 being certified. The Red Wings lost in a shootout.\n\nReal Madrid and Manchester United play during the International Champions Cup at Michigan Stadium on Aug. 2, 2014.

Prior to the crowd at the Big House setting the record, the Rose Bowl held the mark with 101,799 fans."
