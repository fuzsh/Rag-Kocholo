        "text": "I just laughed so hard at my desk that my intern came in to see if I was crying. Mariah Carey? Mike Green, you are too much.\n\nChuck had a brilliant idea: Mikey Mondays! I will see her blatant attempt to restrict my ramblings to one day a week and raise her with another edition of:\n\nMike Green Paid for This – Episode 2: Mike’s Lamborghini\n\nRemember the scene in Batman Forever where Chris O’Donnell’s Robin goes joyriding in the Batmobile? When he pulls up to some girls and says, “Wanna go for a ride in my love machine, baby?” Well that is really happening here.\n\nElephant in the room much? I can’t not do a post about Greener’s most ostentatious possession: a white 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo. It’s too obvious. It cost about $150k and I bet it plays “Smack That” by Akon every time you turn it on (totes a custom upgrade). You are not allowed to eat drive-thru in Mike’s car, nor are you allowed to touch his stereo. Because he is, in all seriousness, listening to Mariah Carey:\n\nThe NHL Network did this “Day in the Life” segment where Mike rocks his accent and drives past the White House on his way to work. So anyone thinking about stalking him by following the unmissable car home from the Verizon Center (no Chuck, I am NOT) should choose another ambush location. Wait, does the Secret Service protect Canadians? Anyway, the Cribs clip shows just about everything but his house number, so he’s pretty much home right now waiting for you to come over with a pizza and beer. Extra pepperoni.\n\nI’m struck by both the urge to laugh and to lay across the hood in my bathing suit. There are not many guys who can pull off a Lambo, and even those who can really shouldn’t. I’m not sure which category Mike falls into yet. (I’m treading lightly here because Marc-Andre Fleury also has a Lambo and if you make fun of him, I’ll beat you with a blocker.)\n\nWhat do you think – hot or not? Overcompensation? Would you rather come across Mike driving his Escalade or Bentley? Personally, I think if you’re gonna go for it, go all out. Then get sponsored by GEICO just in case something happens to your dream machine.\n\nTraining camps opened Friday and over the weekend a lot of people (who weren’t me) got to see some pre-season hockey. It looks like the Blackhawks had the most fun, as the Champs should, by hosting their annual Training Camp Festival including… wait for it… a rollerblading race! Mr. Pants is very jealous because he thinks he’s French and it’s 1994.\n\nThe Penguins unveiled some prospective line combinations, including Evgeni Malkin at right wing next to Mr. Hillary Duff, with Eric Tangradi on the left. It was also announced that Malkin will be talking more with the media this season, and in this video his English has improved a ton. He even smiles, instead of looking vaguely terrified. Of course, it means he’ll have to answer questions if his productivity does pickup stat. (Helpful hint: Don’t Google Malkin. There’s a photo of him tongue-kissing some girl that no one should ever have to see.)\n\nThe Canucks, who still don’t have a captain, presented an episode of WUYS’s favorite show: I Should Have Been a Trainer.\n\nThe Phoenix Coyotes took two pages from a politician’s handbook – they hosted a Town Hall-style meeting and they said nothing. According to their COO, a potential new owner is sniffing around with “money on the table” to keep the team in AZ. So say we all. Thanks for the Coyotes for the best countdown clock in the league.\n\nKari Lehtonen debuted the coolest goalie mask in the history of time – the Chuck Norris edition. Mr. Pants agrees.\n\nIn other clips from camps:\n\nLightning coach Guy Boucher’s scar is still really scary, like the one Mark Hamill is covering with that beard in Empire Strikes Back.\n\nThe Islanders have a mascot (I did not know this). What the eff does Sparky the Dragon have to do with Long Island?\n\nHollywood loves the St. Louis Blues – John Hamm talked about his team during The Town junket and in the trailer for Life as We Know It, Josh Duhamel is wearing a Blues hat.\n\nThe Canadiens are looking for an host for their live in-game promotions. Too bad all the French I can remember is the “Je Suis un Pizza” song and how to say [CENSORED] in case I ever meet Max Talbot.\n\nWhere do I begin to tell the story (cue theme from LOVE STORY) … It was 25 years ago today the world was blessed with the mega-talent of Alexander – Ovi – as his teammates affectionately refer to him. I am not going to list his achievements because you can go look them up.\n\nI will say, or rant, however, that his only sin, (ah – besides being freakin’ smokin’ drop-dead sizzlin’ hot but that’s OK with me! Don’t vomit Pants.) if you can call it that, is being born in Russia. Because if he was born in the other frozen tundra called Canada, there would be no rivalry between him and Sidney Crosby. Crosby would be a foot note in hockey history and Ovechkin would be the second coming of the Great One. Yes, I went there AND sent a postcard!\n\nThe other kids are just jealous of his talent – Max Talbot! I argue with my Hockey Husband Don about this all the time because when he’s not ranting about Alex on Hockey Night in Canada, he’s ranting about Alex on Hockey Night in Canada. But Don’s jealous (Max Talbot!) because I hear him scream Alex’s name at night, and it ain’t like he’s coaching him on the ice, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more!\n\nOvi has brought excitement back to the game old-school style and it’s what’s been missing. He finishes his checks, he plays hard, he’s as excited for his teammates who make goals as he is for himself; he makes no apologies for his game – good or bad (Max Talbot!).\n\nSo happy birthday Sasha and a Foxy Friday salute to my smokin’ hot Russian Bear.\n\nSee ya in San Jose! I’ll be the one with the “Ovi 8 MY HEART” sign ….\n\nYa lublu tebya, lyubimaya moya!\n\nHi all, Chuck here.\n\nSo with the start of the season only a few weeks away (cue our Balki Bartokimus-style “Dance of Joy”), I thought it would be apropos to talk a little bit about my favorite team, the good ‘ol Big, Bad, Black and Gold – the Boston Bruins.\n\nThe last few seasons for us have been less than stellar. Sure we make it to the playoffs, only to get pummeled by the Philadelphia Flyers and Scott Hartnell’s hair last year and the gut-wrenching overtime loss to the Hartford Whalers Caroline Hurricanes the year before, the start of a new season always brings the promise of that perfectly played season that ends with the Czech Giant, Zdeno Chara, lifting the cup 10 feet above his head and skating around the Garden in two strides. (In case you haven’t heard, dude is mad tall.)\n\nSome in Boston claim that #1 Draft pick Tyler Seguin might be our savior, our Sidney Crosby, you might say, but I’m more excited about Nathan Horton. Who? Tim Horton, the Canadian Coffee Guy?\n\nNo, not him. This guy…\n\nNever heard of him? Me neither. Not until he came to the Bruins in an off-season trade for defenceman Dennis Wideman and a draft pick.\n\nSo who is this guy?\n\nNathan Horton. Right Wing. Born May 29, 1985. 6’2″, 229 lbs. (read: Beast). Married to Playboy model (of course), who also happens to be the great-niece of Jacques Plante. Drafted #3 Overall in 2003, at the ripe ol’ age of 18 and was part of the stellar class that year, which included Marc Andre Fleury, Eric Staal, Thomas Vanek, Zach Parise, and Jeff Carter. Career-high goals: 31. Total goals: 142.\n\nWord around town is that he’ll be on a line with my Marc (Savard), so the prospect of him scoring 30 or more goals this season is a definite possibility. Savard loves passing pucks like a fat kid loves eating cake. Bruins have been dying for a finisher ever since Phil Kessel left and me thinks that this Horton guy and his nasty wrist shot might be it. Granted this all remains to be seen, I mean there is a whole season to play, but the prospect has me all googily-eyed and optimistic.\n\nUntil next time, WUYSers!\n\nChuck. Out.\n\nHere at WUYS, we delight in carrying the banner for you. While wearing short pants and jaunty caps, perhaps with a choreographed dance routine (remixed to Lady Gaga?) From the Morning News Desk: T-minus 3 weeks until the season starts!\n\n1) Penguin’s forward Jordan Staal will miss the start of the regular season after another surgery to clear up the infection in his foot. Listen Gronk, get back in the lineup by November 5 because I am not flying to Anaheim just to look at Crosby. I paid a whole 5,000 Virgin America miles for this 1-hour trip, so I’m really doing my part. Meet me halfway. (Just in case you’re not better, I do have an extra ticket. Because sitting in the box is boring.)\n\n2) Rumors abound that Brian Gionta will be named Montreal Canadiens captain during training camp. All together now: “BOOOOOOO.” Even being from Upstate NY is not enough to make up for going to Boston College.\n\n3) My 3rd favorite Staal, Marc, got a 5 year contract with the Rangers. More on why this is important (to me) later.\n\n4) Phoenix’s Paul “BizNasty” Bissonnette debuted his Asian Reference Roulette on Twitter. He took a Korean girl on a date, then made a sushi comment and a won ton joke. I bet his favorite part of Rush Hour 3 is when Chris Tucker tells Jackie Chan, “All y’all look alike!” The only thing better than his Tourette Syndrome is his spelling – he reported that no “wahn tahn panty soup” was made. Then he posted the girl’s Twitter and asked everyone to follow her, but make no Asian jokes. This guy is GOLD.\n\n5) Finally, Ovechkin took the ice for the first time with the Caps this season, then talked about it. Basically he partied every night, all summer, and still plans to dominate the NHL with a single massive paw. If you’re lucky, you get the Caps Convention promo with Varlamov cackling at the start of the video. Over to you, Dawn.\n\nBONUS) Mike Green video! I haven’t watched it yet – but he’s wearing a gold chain. What’s NOT to like about this guy?!\n\nMore notes: Ottawa will host the 2012 All-Star Game, Bobby Ryan got a 5-year deal with the Ducks, San Jose Sharks pre-sale tickets available today (code: TWSHK).\n\nWhile Dawn Cherrie and I were on a double date last night with Mike Green and Ovie, the rest of the NHL’s top 20 stars partied with Graydon Carter and the fancypants folks at Vanity Fair. Well, fancy-ish. Guests included “actor” Tom Cavanaugh and Olympic ice skater Evan Lysacek. It kills me that we’re not famous, because NHL events get the lamest D-list celebrity turnouts ever. I like Tom Cavanaugh, but if you have to say “actor” in front of someone’s name, then the title is questionable at best. Like if you have “Bootylicious ” written on the ass of your sweatpants. Just as the NHL Awards were a parade of “It’s that guy from that thing!” and “Is Smallville still on TV?”, this Vanity Fair party seems to have been solely bolstered by Carter’s Canadian-ness. And for that, we thank him.\n\nThe rest of the NHL Media Tour crew was there, including Malkin, Toews, Kaner and my second-favorite Staal, Eric. We bet Kane’s the only one who had any fun, hopefully joyriding around NYC in Lundqvist’s special edition bus. After Ovie ditched me and Mike Green (apparently not on the guest list), he graced the party with his presence. In a t-shirt.\n\nSid and Ovie did a photo shoot for an upcoming issue of Vanity Fair. If you listen closely, you’ll hear a lot of screaming between Seattle (Dawn) and San Francisco (Pants). There’s plenty of video and photo content of yesterday’s media tour at NHL.com, including Dion Phanuef talking about what makeup he likes to wear and EStaal talking about his butt. Quality.\n\nBefore the party, Dawn and I let Mike Green and Ovie take us to a Russian restaurant. Except they sat next to each other, so maybe we should be worried? Dawn took this photo with her decoder ring camera, so as not to appear all fangirl in the moment, then ran to the bathroom and totally spazzed out. Ovie had 11 shots of vodka and asked to borrow Mike’s Lamborghini. I pretended to know what borscht was and tried not to think about Mike’s bathroom. I’m pretty sure Mike was thinking about Mike. As usual.\n\n(Photo from @washcaps, which I think must be run by a girl because it’s pretty awesome.)"
