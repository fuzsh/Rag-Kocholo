        "text": "Underwater Hockey.... ummm we mean Octopush - was started in the United Kingdom by Alan Blake in 1954 where it was originally called Octopush. Blake of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club and other divers including John Ventham, Jack Willis, and Frank Lilleker first played in Eastney Swimming Pool, Portsmouth, England Originally called \"Octopush\" (and still known primarily by that name in the United Kingdom today) the original rules called for teams of eight players (hence \"octo-\"), a bat reminiscent of a tiny shuffleboard stick, called a \"pusher\" (hence the \"-push\"), an uncoated lead puck called a \"squid\", and a goal known at first as a \"cuttle\" but soon thereafter a \"gully\". *Sourced From Wikipedia\n\nThese Underwater Hockey shirts are made of the softest and most durable 100% cotton fabric and are built to withstand the rigors of daily wear."
