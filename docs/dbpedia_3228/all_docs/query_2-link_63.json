        "text": "If you pay close attention to Caps telecasts, you’ll learn something new every night. During Tuesday’s Rangers game, CSN Washington zoomed in on Alex Ovechkin on the bench, drinking Gatorade and staring at things. We also got a front-row seat to the Caps’ stick rack.\n\nAnd that’s how we learned that TJ Oshie‘s nickname is Osh.\n\nLet’s zooooooom and vector the rasters.\n\nYou would think that calling Timothy Leif Oshie TJ would suffice. Or that Oshie would do too as 99 percent of hockey nicknames are just adding “ie” to the first part of someone’s name.\n\nBut nope. It’s Osh. Here’s more proof.\n\nFrom Alex Prewitt’s story about Troy Brouwer and TJ Oshie meeting each other awkwardly at Kettler after being traded for one another:\n\nFriday morning, as Brouwer guzzled water after an on-ice session, the man for whom the Capitals traded wandered behind the bench, taking a tour of the place and checking out the rink.\n\n“Osh,” Brouwer said, spotting forward T.J. Oshie and extending a hand to say hello.\n\nOr this story from USA Hockey:\n\n“The best thing that happened to him was when [Blues coach Ken Hitchcock] came in. He placed a lot more responsibility on him,” said Kevin Shattenkirk, Oshie’s teammate with the Blues and on Team USA.\n\n“He put Osh into a leadership role right away and Osh is a guy who has always led by example on the ice. There wasn’t a guy on the team who ever doubted his effort in games, so to put him into a role like that, it forced Osh to mature and grow up right away. He’s done a tremendous job.”\n\nOr this Blues story during the playoffs:\n\nBlues coach Ken Hitchcock said following Friday’s morning skate that Oshie is playing better every game.\n\n“The last half of the last game was the Osh that we know,” Hitchcock said. “He’s up to speed. I thought he really had an impact in the second half of the game, which is great to see. Coming out of that game he said for the first time he felt normal and alert, and I think you saw it in his play. He had way more tempo in his game. He had his tenacity back. He wasn’t hesitating on the ice, as far as reads go. His relentless pursuit on the puck in critical ice was exceptional in the second half of the game. If that’s the player we’re going to get tonight, that’s going to be a significant player.”\n\nSo thank you CSN Washington zoom shot for letting us know TJ’s canonical nickname. We are now smarter and better for it."
