        "text": "Disclaimer : Major Barbie spoilers ahead!\n\nI’m a little late to Barbie Mania, but I finally saw this unique film written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, and directed by Greta Gerwig. I adored Gerwig’s Little Women (2019), and so I had high hopes for this movie. Immediately after leaving the cinema and even while watching the movie, my brain was bustling with opinions and my heart was fluttering with feelings. Firstly, I loved the set and costume design. The intricacy and attention to detail in this movie were immaculate. The narration by Helen Mirren was beautiful, and it was perfectly cast. It felt like Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were born to play Barbie and Ken. As a woman of color and a black woman, I loved seeing a black Barbie as president (Issa killed it). It was also great to see another black Barbie (Alexandra Shipp) as a Nobel prize winner and author — highly inspirational, even to me as a grown black woman. I completely adored America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt’s characters, Gloria and Sasha, as the token family responsible for stereotypical Barbie.\n\nWith all that being said, let me dive into the first layer and topic of this film — feminism.\n\nBarbie & Feminism\n\nThe movie starts off by explaining that Barbie helped move along and pioneer feminism — as a toy. Barbie was a revolution that allowed young girls to stop only playing and dreaming to be mothers, and now to play, imagine and dream themselves as literally anything! Self-actualized, self-reliant, and independent. As we know, there was no career that Barbie didn’t undertake and represent, from astronaut to doctor to president to video girl Barbie. The sky was not even the limit when it came to breaking glass ceilings and changing the social climate for how little girls and young women could dream of themselves in the future. Beautiful, especially when we remember the time period that Barbie was truly blowing up and taking over the world (first launched in 1959).\n\nOn the flip side, as Barbie herself learned when she first found Sasha, Barbie has cemented a certain perfectionist ideal of both beauty and achievement for women. Barbie has a perfectly proportioned, white body, long luscious blonde hair, envious blue eyes, a dazzling smile, and the perfect attitude. Unattainable, even for real-life blondies, even more so for those of us who grew up and looked nothing like Barbara Roberts. To this end, Barbie has done her part within culture and media to promote harmful beauty norms and harmful gender norms for women. Barbie does it all! This is great but also reinforces a gender norm that many women are trying to get away from — the pressure to do and be it all…for everyone. A sentiment, a struggle, and a challenge beautifully worded by Gloria’s award-worthy speech in the movie. We will put a pin in this to explore later on — #circlingback\n\nBarbie & Patriarchy\n\nNext and even more curious was the film’s exploration of the patriarchy and its role in society. The film starts off in #BarbieLand where all the Barbies (women) hold positions of power. #BarbieLand is a fictional world that aims to show what our society could be like if women ruled. If #Girlpower really ran the world. Many have already highlighted the fact that the women in power in #BarbieLand did not hurt, objectify, aggressively demean, harass, exploit, or devalue the Kens aka men. This is a stark contrast to the treatment of women in the real world, where women are harassed, belittled, objectified, used, abused, etc. We see this as soon as Barbie and Ken rollerblade through Los Angeles. Barbie is immediately affected by the way the men treat her and she even says that she feels unsafe, whereas Ken, for the first time, feels power and respect…just for the sake of being a man.\n\nThe film also does a great job of highlighting the selfishness and egotistical behavior that patriarchy promotes. Ken becomes self-obsessed, not confident and competent, and accomplished like the Barbies in power at #BarbieLand, but truly self-obsessed, arrogant, and selfish with a male ego inflated by nonsense. He even abandons Barbie and chooses to return to #BarbieLand without her, knowing she could be in danger because he saw his opportunity to change #BarbieLand and make it more like the real world — male-centered and male-dominated aka patriarchal.\n\nSimilar to the real world and modern society, there is tension, misunderstanding, and essentially a gender war between the Barbies and the Kens. I will be objective here, the Barbies were not perfect. Although the Barbies were not intentionally mean, cruel, etc to the Kens, there was no effort to make them more equal in society. I am also confused as to why Greta chose to portray the Kens in such an extremely dumbed-down fashion even towards the end. Is it a direct response to the dumb-blonde, ditzy tropes that women have suffered in media since time immemorial? If so, okay but why not allow the Kens to evolve more towards the end? Just as the Barbies themselves go through a societal and conscious awakening.\n\nHowever, the difference in patriarchy’s (Kendom) treatment of women and feminism’s (#BarbieLand) treatment of men is still striking. In patriarchy (Kendom), Ken became spiteful, jealous, cruel, and boxed in by his own definitions and rigid playbook of masculinity. This is a deliberate social commentary on the system of patriarchy, which promotes harmful male gender norms that hurt BOTH men and women. The Barbies (feminism) recognize this, hence when they plotted to overthrow the Kens (patriarchy) they used their own shortcomings of jealousy and competitiveness against them. The film does a good job of showing how patriarchy does more harm than good to BOTH men and women. It also does a good job of showing how much patriarchy and its promotion of what masculinity is supposed to look like is just nonsense, pointless, unfulfilling, and unproductive to the psyche of men. After all his obsession with power, horses, domination, control, being “the man”, and standing out from the rest of the Kens, Ken (Ryan Gosling) eventually realizes that he is still lost and unhappy — particularly without Barbie. This is a commentary on the struggle with mental health many men are facing in our society. Men are coming forward and confessing that they are lonely, because of the structure of patriarchy and the way it raises them to stifle their own emotions, and even with the strong networks of boys club and boys night, men are still suffering psychologically. #Kenough is just a very small nod to the notion that men must free their psyche from the prison of patriarchy, and also embrace the need for their emotional side and genuine love and healthy companionship in their lives — without making their social status and relationship status the definition of their manhood and identity. Who are you, Ken? i.e. What does it mean to truly be a man?\n\nBarbie & Gender Wars\n\nThere were many things that I enjoyed about the film. However, I wished for a more productive, deeper, and (true) feminist ending when it came to resolving and healing the gender wars. Yes, the Barbies should have reinstated their constitution, which is of course a metaphor for embracing feminism into the fabric of society. However, a true feminist understands that feminism, at its true core, is a revolution, movement, and ideology that calls for the equality of both sexes. Feminism wants balance and harmony. Feminism works for the benefit and care of men too — so yes Ken become slightly conscious too and began a self-help journey aka #Kenough, but I would have liked to see a deeper and more complete transformation of the Kens as they accepted #BarbieLand back aka feminism. I would have liked to see them transform from being tools into more conscious and empathetic men and partners. Especially after the big musical number that really served as a big display of the male ego. Real feminism focuses on some important principles. Most feminists agree on five basic principles — working to increase equality, expanding human choice, eliminating gender stratification, ending sexual violence, and promoting sexual freedom.\n\nThese principles are for both men and women. Thankfully, I know what real feminism is, as I was educated by some of the best authors and pioneers, whose feminist principles were more diverse and inclusive — Bell Hooks, Audre Lorde, and dem! Ironically, the movie gave us a taste of the white savior brand of white feminism or second-wave feminism that largely ignores the experiences of black and brown women. Bell Hooks in her wisdom warned against this type of feminism — which is counterproductive. This type of radical feminism just seeks to become the reverse of patriarchy. Men have power, let us take the power away and give it to ourselves and become the ones in power. There is no real equality in this. And giving the Ken’s a small job at the President’s house makes #BarbieLand (feminism) no better than Kendom (patriarchy) in this regard. This brand of feminism feeds right into the uneducated fears of a majority of the population, and many men, and puts a serious spoke in the wheels of actual equality. Again, because this is my disappointment with the movie, I would have liked to see better harmony and true equality between the genders as a resolution and solution in this movie. Yes, #BarbieLand is a fantasy world, but as Ruth tells Barbie, “Humans only have one ending. Ideas live forever”. So let us teach the correct idea of feminism. Particularly, as this movie is going to be a major introduction to many people — adults, adolescents, and children — into these critical social, political, and societal topics and ideologies.\n\n“Radical feminists see the society as patriarchal, and it is dominated and ruled by men, i.e., men are the ruling class, and women are the subject class. Moreover, they believe that women are not just equal but are actually morally superior to men and patriarchy can be replaced by matriarchy. They want to transform the women life and the society through radical actions (Tong, 2009). “\n\nBarbie & Beauty Standards\n\nSo now we have circled back to fully dissect Ms. Barbara Roberts and her beauty standards. Barbie herself admits it — she is the stereotypical Barbie. But let us examine what this means in her representation of beauty in the media. Gerwig and Baumbach are “woke” enough to admit this and also to have Sasha hilariously roast Barbie when she first encounters her in the real world by letting her know how she has harmed girls and women with her impossible beauty and professional standards. To reiterate, by pushing the image and the idea that Barbie can do everything because women can do everything, this, unfortunately, meant that a lot of girls, women, and society LITERALLY pushed girls and women to do everything. Be a mother, wife, and a #bossbabe. Be a working professional, a five-star chef at home, and a hands-on mother. It’s ironic and sad one of Sasha’s lines, “Men hate women and women hate women. It’s the one thing we can all agree on.”Because in part, in their naivete of dealing with gender roles and fighting against the patriarchy, many of the waves of feminism did contribute to this cognitive dissonance of being a #bossbabe — yes you can be an executive but you still have to go home, and be a trophy wife and perfect mother too. Exhausting and impossible.\n\nBarbie can do it all because she lives in a fantasy world without human limitations, complexities, and problems. Real women and girls? We have shit to deal with. We are human. We need support, we need help. We shouldn’t have to shoulder the world to prove #grlpwr and earn the respect of men. Just like second-wave and radical feminism overlook this and thereby ironically burden women with their own power, so too does #BarbieLand’s feminism. Yes, the Barbies have an amazing sisterhood, and yes they are capable but again — why do women have to do it on their own? Why promote the idea that men are completely and utterly useless to women? Why give the Kens small jobs and essentially send a message they are beneath the Barbies when it comes to societal power?\n\nIt was also ironic to see the movie be as diverse and inclusive as possible, while also still promoting the idea of a “weird” Barbie. The Barbie that was not perfectly polished, accomplished, and meeting the expectations and requirements of #BarbieLand aka society in this case — was horrifically ostracized. Even Sasha says in the movie, “You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented”\n\nThink about it, even if I was close to the ideal Barbie represents — skinny, blonde, and blue-eyed, I would still fall short in one way or another. Far less for everyone else — from brunette to redhead to raven-haired, and worse yet for BIPOC. Yes, we have Teresa and Christie, etc., but Barbie has always been placed on a pedestal, and portrayed with #maincharacterenergy. Once more, let’s not even talk about her perfectly proportioned body, her ideal height, and her ideal everything. Children aren’t stupid and pick up on these things. What does that do to a young girl’s psyche? As long as the stereotypical Barbie or the main Barbie only looks like the Margot Robbie’s of the world — Barbie will remain a culprit in promoting unhealthy and toxic beauty standards. While it is a win and excellent to add more Barbies and be more diverse and inclusive, as long as Mattel and Barbie-related media continue to center all the stories and attention on stereotypical, white, blonde, blue-eyed, and skinny Barbie…we are not making as much progress as we can.\n\nIn contrast, Barbie’s competitor saw these critical errors and gaps in representation and image by Mattel and so this is the reason Bratz dolls were able to be so successful. They were better at making all the dolls seem more equal, desirable, beautiful, relatable, realistic, and have that #maincharacterenergy, even whilst being portrayed as a group. The other dolls in these franchises have better looks, personalities, and quirks and represent a more inclusive and diverse range of the female population. And so Mattel self-corrected with My Scene and soon the market was flooded with all kinds of dolls like Monster High, LOL dolls, etc. I had Barbies but I had more fun, felt more seen, and had a harder time letting go of my Bratz and MyScene dolls. P.S. They were also waayyyy hotter and cooler! In a world of Barbies (preppy, polished, overworked, bossy boss babe), I wanted to be and wanna be a Bratz or MyScene — just effing sexy, cool, fun, dynamic, hot, mysterious …ok I will say it….the real IT GIRLS.\n\nOverall, Mattel still has a lot of #unpacking to do when it comes to Barbie beauty standards, diversity, inclusion, and gender norms. The Barbie movie is undeniably a new cult classic. As said online, it’s to women what the Godfather is to men. Yes, I might bring this movie up on a date to determine if a guy is worth it or not. Yes, I will still show this movie to my children — both sons and daughters. However, I will have some cliff notes ready. This movie will also be just for fun, for entertainment, and as a conversation starter on the aforementioned topics that will be a long, never-ending conversation in my future home just as they are long neverending topics in society as we all grow, change, evolve and as societal rhetoric moves and changes according to media and trends. And yes I am aware that the movie is intended to be light and playful and almost juvenile in its presentation, however, again, I just wished for a better outcome and more equality between the Barbies and Kens towards the end. All in all, I do wish Barbie Handler the best in the real world, and I felt like a proud mamma watching her put her big girl pants on and attend her first gyno appointment. You go, girl!\n\nLove,\n\nMj\n\n❤\n\n© COPYRIGHT 2023 Micaela Jordan, All Rights Reserved.\n\nReferences\n\nAbbott, A.
