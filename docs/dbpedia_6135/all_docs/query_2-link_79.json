        "text": "Sometimes, Buck thinks he and Eddie have had every conversation there is to have.\n\nThey’ve been best friends, work partners, and co-parents for the last six years. They’ve been romantic partners — or lovers, as Eddie once insisted on calling them, which made Buck laugh so hard he fell off his chair, which made Eddie laugh so hard he nearly fell off his too — for nearly eight months now.\n\nAll of this time spent together has amounted to many vast and sprawling discussions. Extraterrestrial life: whether it exists, whether it would be hostile, whether it’s something to fear. The sheer stupidity in how eighth-grade algebra is being taught these days. Potential wedding venues, discussed with all the excitement of two preteen girls huddled over a scrapbook of their dream ceremonies. Fortnite strategy discussions, because Chris is deeply disappointed in how bad they both are at the game. The correct way to sort laundry, and why Buck apparently never meets Eddie’s standards. The correct way to fold laundry, and why Eddie definitely doesn’t meet Buck’s standards.\n\nThey’ve definitely repeated conversations too— often, Buck will start rambling about something cool he knows about, like space rocks or zine history, and realize over halfway through his tangent that he’s definitely said this all before. Eddie always tells him to continue; says “maybe I’ll learn something new this time” or “I like hearing you talk,” which always makes Buck feel giddy and light and so, so lucky.\n\nSometimes, they return to old arguments: if there are more doors or wheels in the world (Eddie says wheels; Buck says doors), if curses are real (Eddie says no; Buck says yes), if Sara’s mom was flirting with Buck at the PTA meeting that one time (Eddie says she was making heart-eyes at you the entire time; Buck says she was being friendly, when did you get so jealous?).\n\nPoint is, Buck and Eddie may as well have run the gamut of conversation topics. There might be nothing left to say. He’s alright with that, as long as they keep talking anyway.\n\nThen, one day as Buck helps Hen restock the ambulance, he mentions hearing something about a potential reboot of The X-Files, which prompts Hen to say: “My closet key was my best friend when I was sixteen, but I definitely should have realized I was a lesbian from how obsessed I was with Gillian Anderson.”\n\n“Oh, I was definitely more into Mulder,” Buck agrees, and then his brain catches up. “Wait, closet key?”\n\n“The person who makes you realize you’re queer,” Hen explains with a little laugh. “They’re called a closet key ’cause they’re unlocking the door, you know?”\n\nBuck cringes. “I guess mine would be Tommy.”\n\n“We can pretend it’s Mulder,” Hen says sympathetically. “Or whoever your earliest maybe-crush on a guy was. That’s your would-be closet key.”\n\n“Maybe not Mulder, then,” Buck muses. He casts his mind back, but like all of his thoughts, this one passes through the Eddie-shaped filter in his brain and emerges as: I wonder who Eddie’s would-be closet key is.\n\nBuck would happily have the same conversations with Eddie over and over again, but he certainly doesn’t mind having something new to discuss.\n\nHours later — once they’re off work and they’ve made breakfast and Eddie’s put on some laundry sorted in that very particular way of his — they settle on the couch; both in a lazy, post-work mood. Buck’s got his arm tossed around Eddie’s shoulders; Eddie leaning tiredly into him and pressing his cold nose against his neck. He has half a mind to complain about it, but there’s a quiet sort of serenity that’s settled over them.\n\nInstead, Buck leans his cheek against Eddie’s soft hair and says, “I was your closet key, right?”\n\nEddie makes a muffled, questioning noise into Buck’s neck. He laughs as the sound reverberates through his throat.\n\n“A closet key’s the person who makes you realize you’re queer,” he explains. “I was talking to Hen earlier about would-be closet keys. The kind of stuff where, in retrospect, you’re like: wow, how did this person or media or character not make me realize I was gay?”\n\nEddie lifts his head, a little begrudgingly, and blinks a few times like he’s clearing his vision. His expression is soft; unguarded. Buck’s used to seeing this expression in relation to Chris — whether Eddie’s talking to him or about him — but now, it’s for Buck. Adoration clear in those beautiful brown eyes; a gentleness born out of a love he still can’t quite believe he deserves. It makes him feel lucky all over again.\n\n“Well, you’re right,” Eddie says, voice a little gravelly. “You were my closet key. But as for would-bes…” He pauses; glances downwards in thought. A moment later, his lips twitch up into a smile. “It’s gotta be Tom Cruise as Maverick in Top Gun.”\n\nBuck tries, valiantly, not to laugh. He fails after a millisecond. Eddie half-heartedly glares at him.\n\n“What, the beach volleyball scene? Because I can definitely understand that.”\n\n“No, no, Maverick as a character,” Eddie stresses. “You know, he was… he was charming. Competent. And he’s reckless, and he breaks protocol, but it’s always for a good reason. It’s always out of loyalty.”\n\n“I see,” Buck replies, grinning. “You’re all about personality.”\n\n“Exactly,” Eddie declares. The tips of his ears redden as he admits: “Though the beach volleyball scene definitely sweetened the deal.”\n\nBuck scans him, trying to gauge if he realizes what he’s confessed to. “You have a type,” he says finally, unable to resist the smugness sliding into his voice.\n\nEddie raises his eyebrows, incredulous. “Do I?”\n\n“Come on,” Buck urges, knocking their shoulders together. “Charming, loyal, competent, devilishly handsome—”\n\n“I didn’t say that,” Eddie says firmly.\n\n“It was implied,” Buck says. “Admit it. You basically just described me.”\n\nEddie flushes. “You think that’s how I’d describe you?” he challenges.\n\n“How else would you?”\n\n“Well, boneheaded, for starters,” he says, immediately taking the bait Buck has so politely handed him. “Impulsive, way too forgiving, and an absolute terror with a clipboard. Maverick is not nearly as bossy as you.”\n\n“You love it, though,” Buck teases.\n\nEddie rolls his eyes, but his voice is soft when he says, “I do.”\n\n“And,” Buck continues, “I am exactly your type.”\n\nEddie’s lips twist like he’s sucking on a lemon. Haltingly, as though it’s an exceptionally difficult act, he concedes: “You are.”\n\n“I’m what?” Buck asks, wanting to hear the full sentence.\n\n“Don’t push it,” Eddie warns, pointing at him.\n\nBuck just laughs, leaning in to kiss his cheek. Eddie turns his head at the last possible second. Their lips meet, sweet and slow, and he can only savor it for a moment before Eddie is pulling away with narrowed eyes.\n\n“What about you, then? You’re telling me you don’t have a type?”\n\n“Oh no, I do,” Buck admits easily.\n\n“So who was your would-be closet key, then?”\n\n“You’re gonna laugh.”\n\nEddie grins, sharklike. “Oh, I bet.”\n\nTaking a deep breath, he admits: “Jude Law in The Holiday.”\n\nMuch to his surprise, Eddie doesn’t laugh. Instead, he cocks his head and asks, “The Holiday?”\n\nBuck doesn’t remember being struck by lightning, but he imagines the jolt would feel similar to the one that hits him now. “Cancel our plans,” he orders, immediately untangling himself from his boyfriend in search of the TV remote.\n\n“Our plans?” Eddie raises an eyebrow at the urgency. His hand wraps around Buck’s wrist, like he doesn’t want to let him go. “So… folding laundry and picking up our son from school?”\n\nEvery time Eddie refers to Chris as our son, Buck’s reaction is involuntary — he grins, wide and giddy. He doesn’t even need to feel his face move to know he’s doing it now. The way Eddie’s eyes crinkle in delight says enough.\n\n“Just the laundry,” he says, snatching the remote off the coffee table and switching the TV on. “It’s a two-hour movie. We’ll be done long before the end of the school day.”\n\n“Oh, you’re serious about this,” Eddie remarks, amused.\n\nBuck sinks back into the couch. Eddie immediately gravitates to his side, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. “I’ve never been more serious about anything in my life,” he says, pulling up the movie on Netflix.\n\n“Anything?”\n\nHe fixes Eddie with a very serious look and explains: “It’s a Nancy Meyers movie where Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, after having bad breakups, decide to swap houses for the winter holidays and find love overseas.”\n\n“So it’s very important,” Eddie observes. He’s clearly just pretending to understand.\n\n“You’ll get it,” Buck says, and hits play.\n\nEddie, to most people, is a terrible movie companion. He makes snarky comments and chatters throughout the film. and then repeatedly asks to rewind when he gets confused about a plot point he missed because he was talking so much. Fortunately, Buck has a similar habit — though he’s more prone to talking loudly and then telling everyone else to shut up and pay attention. They make a perfect movie-going pair. Chris can’t stand either of them.\n\nThey keep up a low commentary during the movie. Eddie complains about Cameron Diaz, as Amanda, being unappreciative of Kate Winslet’s quaint British home; Buck defends her by explaining that she’s a city girl. When Jack Black, as Miles, starts talking about the magic of the Santa Anas, Eddie shoves his face in the crook of Buck’s neck and starts muttering about “you Californians and your weird superstitions.”\n\nDespite all his comments — and for someone who’s allegedly not a rom-com guy — Eddie takes to it quickly. Buck thinks his new favourite movie might be Eddie-watching-The-Holiday.\n\nJude Law’s character, Graham, shows up forty minutes into the movie — wasted on the doorstep of the cottage where Amanda is staying. Eddie immediately turns to Buck, looking skeptical and amused all at once.\n\n“So this is him?”\n\n“Yeah, that’s him.”\n\n“Interesting,” Eddie says, and then refuses to elaborate.\n\n“Well, he can’t actually be a cheater,” Eddie theorizes when Graham picks up a phone call from the mysterious Olivia, only scenes after he takes a call from someone named Sophie. “Otherwise you wouldn’t like him.”\n\n“I like you,” Buck points out, just to be a bitch.\n\nEddie glares at him. “Do you want me to keep watching this movie with you or not?”\n\nWhen Amanda shows up unexpectedly at Graham’s house, Buck waits for Eddie’s reaction with bated breath. He’s been watching Eddie the entire movie; getting a little lost staring at his strong profile, all dark lashes and lips twisting in disapproval or amusement, and only being brought back to the present when Eddie turns to him to provide animated commentary.\n\nThis, though, is a make or break moment, and he’s somewhat dreading his reaction.\n\n‘Oh my god,’ Amanda says in response to a noise clattering behind Graham. ‘You’re not alone, are you.’\n\nGraham shakes his head grimly. ‘No, I’m not, actually.’\n\n“Is this going to give me secondhand embarrassment?” Eddie asks, turning to Buck. “Because I really don’t do well with secondhand embarrassment.”\n\n“Watch the movie,” Buck urges.\n\nEddie frowns, but fixes his gaze on the screen anyway. Amanda fumbles her way through an awkward apology, and then the door creaks further open. Buck holds his breath.\n\nWhen a little girl appears in the doorway, Eddie looks just about as shocked as Amanda does.\n\n‘Who is it, daddy?’ the little girl, Sophie, whispers.\n\n‘Daddy?’ Amanda echoes.\n\n‘Yes,’ Graham confirms with a nervous smile. ‘I am daddy.’\n\nEddie bursts into laughter. Buck, unfortunately, knows that it’s not directed at the scene they’re watching. He places his head in his hands as Eddie continues to cackle, the sound of it drowning out the entrance of Graham’s other daughter, Olivia.\n\nFinally — finally — Eddie’s laughter dies down. Buck cautiously lifts his face. Eddie’s shoulders are still shaking silently.\n\n“Your type— your type is single dads?” Eddie accuses, barely restrained amusement clear in his tone.\n\n“It’s not just that,” Buck defends. “He’s caring, respectful, and reserved, but secretly sensitive and romantic once Amanda gets to know him.”\n\n“And he’s a single dad,” Eddie points out, smirking.\n\n“And he’s an amazing father who would do anything to protect his kids,” he corrects. “He ticks every box.”\n\n“Wait,” Eddie says, “kids plural?”\n\nBuck gestures to the screen, where Graham is doling out hot chocolate to Amanda and his daughters. “Do you need me to rewind?”\n\n“No, I think I got it,” Eddie replies, a smirk tugging at the corners of his lips. “Graham has two kids, and you have a thing for single dads.”\n\n“I hate you,” Buck says seriously. He pecks Eddie’s cheek and then leans forward to grab the remote. “We do have to go back, though. I think you missed some details.”\n\n“Right. If you just told me what I missed, you’d lose out on watching precious minutes of single dad Jude Law,” he teases. “This is so much better than I expected.”\n\nBuck groans as he rewinds. “I was fourteen when Maddie made me watch this,” he complains. “Go easy on me.”\n\n“I was twelve when I first watched Top Gun,” Eddie retorts. “If you get to make fun of me, I get to make fun of you.”\n\n“When you first watched Top Gun?” Buck narrows his eyes at him. “So you’ve seen it multiple times?”\n\n“It’s not weird to rewatch a movie!”\n\n“Was there something you missed the first time around? Maybe something to do with Tom Cruise’s abs?”\n\n“How many times have you seen The Holiday? ” Eddie fires back. Buck blanches. “Exactly what I thought.”\n\nIn lieu of a response, he presses play right before Graham’s second daughter enters the scene, and nudges Eddie’s leg as a way of saying pay attention.\n\nNear the end of the movie — as Amanda bursts into tears upon realizing she does love Graham, urges her driver to turn the taxi around, and sprints across a snowy field to reunite with him — Eddie leans a little further into Buck.\n\n“I get it,” he murmurs, voice low in his ear.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Nancy Meyers knows what she’s doing.”\n\nBuck laughs at that, a little teary. This scene always makes him emotional. Eddie doesn’t say anything about it; just takes his hand and presses a gentle kiss to it.\n\nOn screen, Amanda enters Graham’s house to find him crying. ‘You know, I was just thinking,’ she says, ‘why would I ever leave before New Year’s Eve? That makes no sense at all. I mean, you didn’t exactly ask me out, but you did say you loved me. So I’m thinking I’ve got a date, if you’ll have me.’\n\n‘I have the girls New Year’s Eve,’ Graham tells her.\n\nUnder his breath, Buck whispers the next line alongside Amanda: “Sounds perfect.”\n\nAmanda and Graham hug. Eddie squeezes Buck’s hand. “Yeah,” he whispers, “I definitely get it.”\n\nAs the credits roll, Buck says: “Maddie always loved rom-coms. I always complained every time she put them on, because I wanted to watch Goosebumps or Transformers or whatever. But really, I was hooked. I always dreamt of finding a love like that, you know? Someone who’s willing to work through all the miscommunication and drama to be with you. Someone who’d run a mile in high heels in snow because they love you the way you are.”\n\n“Did you?” Eddie asks, voice soft in his ear. “Find that love, I mean?”\n\nHe thinks of a scrapbook with scattered photos around it; of two lives well spent; of hands clasped in death.\n\n“Well,” he says, “I was told once that you don’t find a love like that. You make it.”\n\nEddie hums. His hand finds its way to the juncture between Buck’s shoulder and neck, absentmindedly stroking his thumb against his jawline.\n\nBuck leans into the touch. He’s sure Eddie can feel the tension in his throat; sense the hesitancy in his tone. “Do you think…”\n\n“Buck, baby,” Eddie says firmly, eyes shining with a love he still feels so bewildered by. “I think we’ve been making it for a long time now.”\n\n“We’ve only been together eight months,” he points out dumbly.\n\n“That doesn’t mean we haven’t been building this all along,” Eddie replies. It’s matter-of-fact, like there’s no question about what he’s saying. Buck is inclined to agree.\n\nHe tilts his head into Eddie’s hand, kissing the palm of it. “I love you,” he says.\n\n“I love you too,” he answers easily. Amusement glimmers in his eyes as he adds: “Even if I have to prove it by running a mile in high heels in the snow for you.”\n\nBuck feels his eyebrows shoot up high on his forehead. “You’d wear high heels?”\n\n“It’s a metaphor,” he says, which is not a no.\n\nBefore Buck can tease him further, Eddie’s eyes go comedically wide. He bolts upward so fast that it knocks Buck backward on the couch “Oh my god. We left damp laundry in the washing machine.”\n\n“I thought I told you to cancel the laundry,” Buck pouts, scrambling to pull Eddie back towards him. “Don’t leave me.”\n\n“I’m going to switch it,” Eddie says, tugging his wrist out of Buck’s grip, “and when it dries, you can show me your folding strategy again. Maybe I’ll get it this time.”\n\n“I doubt it,” Buck says seriously. Eddie swats at his shoulder, kisses his forehead, and leaves the room.\n\nBuck sighs, content, and pulls up Top Gun on Netflix. There’s another few hours before they have to pick Chris up from school, and hey— he wants to know what all the fuss about this Maverick guy is. And if he gets to both hold and bully Eddie in the process, well, no one will hear him complain about that."
