        "text": "Although many of Christopher Nolan’s movies happen simultaneously in the past, present and future, he almost never works on weekends. He made an exception, though, on a Saturday early this fall, while he was in New York on the sort of errand almost no director takes up, or has to take up, these days: He was visiting theaters to make sure they were properly prepared to project his new movie, “Interstellar.” The final cut of the movie had been delivered, as is characteristic for him, ahead of schedule, back in June, and he was rapidly running out of tasks within his control before the premiere.\n\nIn an industry where status means not having to care about the value of other people’s time, Nolan never keeps anybody waiting. At 10 a.m. sharp, he was greeted at the Bow Tie Cinema on 23rd Street in Chelsea by Adam Cole, who had flown over from Los Angeles with the film print, which had its own ticket. Cole, who has been Nolan’s postproduction coordinator for the last two films, had been there since 7 in the morning. He was wearing a bow tie, only slightly askew; this might have been an understated homage to this particular theater — one of only 240 or so nationwide that would be projecting the movie on actual film rather than digitally — or might merely have been an expression of the odd sartorial discipline that all of Nolan’s collaborators seem to share, their shirts tucked in like barracks bedsheets. (Brad Grey, the chairman and C.E.O. of Paramount Pictures, told me the set of “Interstellar” was the best-dressed set he ever visited. “Everyone was in suits and ties, and I thought, Who are these folks, everyone talking very nicely to each other, all civilized?”)\n\nNolan’s own look accords with his strict regimen of optimal resource allocation and flexibility: He long ago decided it was a waste of energy to choose anew what to wear each day, and the clubbable but muted uniform on which he settled splits the difference between the demands of an executive suite and a tundra. The ensemble is smart with a hint of frowzy, a dark, narrow-lapeled jacket over a blue dress shirt with a lightly fraying collar, plus durable black trousers over scuffed, sensible shoes. In colder weather, Nolan outfits himself with a fitted herringbone waistcoat, the bottom button left open. A pair of woven periwinkle cuff links and rather garish striped socks represent his only concessions to whimsy or sentimentality; they have about them the sweet, gestural, last-minute air of Father’s Day presents.\n\nDespite the civilized and civilizing exterior, Nolan was a little anxious that morning. He is comfortable with the fact that his filmmaking practice rests on the expertise of his team — he calls himself a jack-of-all-trades and emphasizes the “master of none” — but film projection, the final gate before the audience, was a dying art, and there were fewer and fewer people around he could trust. Like most theaters, the Bow Tie now shows most of its movies in digital projection, which Quentin Tarantino has called “TV in public.” Over the last 10 years, Nolan has emerged, along with Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, as one of Hollywood’s most visible advocates for film, with its exacting texture and granularity of hue, over the Styrofoam flatness of digital. Nolan is a gestalt thinker and entertainer, and he thinks that it’s technical details like these, even the ones we register only unconsciously, that make the theatrical experience a vivid and continuous dream: “At the movies, we’re going to see someone else put on a show, and I feel a responsibility to put on the best show possible.” Nolan was at the Bow Tie to optimize the show. The theater hadn’t projected film in some time, so Paramount had called in their New York head of technical operations to get everything in order. “They’ve only got one rack of sub,” Cole said, indicating that the sound system perhaps wasn’t ideal for such low-end sounds as roars and booms, of which this film has its share."
