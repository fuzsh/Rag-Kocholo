        "text": "It's the mantra that's haunted many a Community fan: six seasons and a movie. Viewers have been begging for the beloved sitcom to fill that quota and, well, the first part came true when Yahoo of all places rescued it from cancellation. And after an arduous seven-year wait, it looks like the rest of the prophecy will finally be fulfilled.\n\nSet at a community college, the series from Rick & Morty creator Dan Harmon centred around a study group attended by some eclectic students, including a disbarred lawyer (Joel McHale) and a hypocritical activist (Gillian Jacobs). The show became something of a cult hit for its meta humour and boundless creativity, best exemplified by its annual paintball episodes. (A hoot!) Despite its middling ratings at the time, it kick-started the careers of the likes of Alison Brie and Donald Glover, and also attracted some serious directing talent including the Russo brothers (of Avengers fame), Justin Lin and Richard Ayoade.\n\nThis is all to say, viewers have been patiently waiting for Community’s cinematic return for a long time. Be warned: the movie isn’t quite confirmed yet. Still, several cast members have been dropping hints that a film is in the works.\n\nWhat’s happening with the Community movie?\n\nThere have always been rumours swirling around about a possible reunion for the Greendale study group, as McHale and Harmon have expressed hopes for it to come to fruition. But it’s all starting to look like it could genuinely happen. On WrapWomen’s Unwrapped podcast, Brie, who played high school dropout Annie, revealed that “there’s been movement.” She continued:\n\n“Wheels are turning. I said it! I’m saying there are legitimate conversations that are happening. Whether or not they will ever turn into an actual movie, I would love it if they did, and I hope that they do. But the fact alone that actual real conversations are happening is I think the most progress we’ve ever made on that front.”\n\nAccording to Collider, fellow cast member Yvette Nicole Brown added more fuel to the fire by confirming that they’re in talks for the movie. The problem is it’s a little bit of a logistical nightmare:\n\n\"This is the thing that we've been saying for years now, it's not that there's a lack of desire. We all would love to do it, but everyone has just branched off and done so many different things. It's like, how do you work out a schedule where you can get a Donald Glover, or a Gillian Jacobs, or Danny Pudi all together in one place at the same time again? So I think that is the biggest jigsaw puzzle to put together, but every puzzle can find its way to completion. So, I believe that it's going to happen. I don't know when but there are talks right now, currently.”\n\nWell, fair enough, it must be nearly impossible to get all of these actors back in one room – but we have hope.\n\nWhere did six seasons and a movie come from exactly?\n\nIt all traces back to one joke. In the season two episode “Paradigms of Human Memory”, pop culture-obsessed Abed (Danny Pudi) wears a cloak in homage to the poorly received and short-lived NBC series The Cape. An annoyed Jeff (McHale) yells at him that the show will “last three weeks”, and Abed retorts that there will be “six seasons and a movie.” The phrase became something of a motto for Community fans hoping the show would meet the same quota."
