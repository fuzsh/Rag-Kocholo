        "text": "Balkan Express\n\n40Mins\n\nGerman mountaineers Max Kroneck and Jochen Mesle book a one-way train ticket from Munich to Thessaloniki – and start their 2500-kilometre journey back home by bike and ski. They explore the mountains of the Balkans, looking for the most beautiful ski runs and sharing good times with locals along the way.\n\nContinuum\n\n2Mins\n\nEverything is connected. Each ride is an extension of the one before and each reentry is a transition to the next launch. Each experience builds on one another toward a flow state of endless progression.\n\nFall Theory (Tour Edit)\n\n29Mins\n\nFall Theory follows the notorious Franco Cookson on his latest journey to climb a dangerous line where the weight of previous successes hangs heavily on his mind – that, and the laughable protection combined with moves he can’t yet do. Madman or genius? Decide for yourself with this enthralling watch; spare trousers recommended.\n\nThe Fastest Girl in the Village\n\n6Mins\n\nAs a girl growing up in Lesotho, Khothalang Leuta never imagined she could become a bike racer. From teaching herself how to ride a bike to becoming “faster than the boys”, see what can be accomplished when opportunity is provided.\n\nFree to Run\n\n31Mins\n\nWhen the Taliban takes over Afghanistan threatening the basic human rights of women across the country, UN human rights attorney and mountain runner, Stephanie Case, must ?ght to ?nd a way forward for the Afghan women of her NGO, Free to Run, in the midst of taking on the longest and hardest ultra trail race of her life.\n\nJoy\n\n22Mins\n\nIn the extreme South-West of Uganda is Mgahinga Gorilla National Park – a wild ecosystem drawn by the orography of three sleeping giants, the Muhavura, Gahinga and Sabinyo volcanoes, which mark the border between Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Joy is a female ranger and a mother who dedicates her days to protect the National Park and more specifically to watch over the Nyakagezi family, the only family of mountain gorillas that lives in its forests.\n\nKUMARI: A Father's Dream (Tour Edit)\n\n16Mins\n\nDeep in rural Nepal, Jagat Lama is driven by a promise he made to his dying father to bring medical care to the village. Along with a group of childhood friends from low-caste families, he starts a trekking guide social enterprise that transforms their home community of Kumari. The guides channel their profits and energy into developing a self-sustaining community centered around many of the regions firsts: basic electricity, a women’s skill center, a local school, a working community farm and a medical hospital.\n\nLapporten Skyline (Tour Edit)\n\n18Mins\n\nDuring the summer 2021 some of the best highliners in the world head for the iconic Lapporten Gap just outside Abisko in Northern Sweden. The plan is to put up a two kilometre long highline 600 metres above the deck and then walk across. If they succeed it will be a new world record.\n\nLil' Buddha\n\n9Mins\n\nLo Phong has hiked over 77,000 kilometres since age 19. He attributes his motivation and drive to his Hmong lineage, a family of survivors who’ve historically persevered and celebrated their freedom since their removal from SouthEast Asia by the US military in 1976. Lo Phong’s story chronicles the journey of a refugee on a quest for freedom and a sense of home.\n\nThe Nine Wheels\n\n21Mins\n\nThe film tells the story of the Schneeberger family a.k.a The Nine Wheels. This film explores what it is like to live with a disability, brotherly love, the devotion of parents and ultimately, what it is like to live life one day at a time.\n\nNorth Shore Betty\n\n12Mins\n\nThe misty forests above North Vancouver, British Columbia are hallowed ground for mountain biking, a place so harrowing it’s influenced every aspect of the sport for over 30 years. It’s also where Betty Birrell, at age 45, picked up mountain biking after a career as a mountaineer and professional windsurfer. Three decades later, the single mother is a role model for her son, her friends and anyone she’s met along the way – and proof that you’re never too old to send.\n\nNuisance Bear\n\n14Mins\n\nChurchill, Manitoba, is famous as an international destination for photographing polar bears. We’ve seen the majestic images and classic wildlife series captured here, but what do these bears see of us? Through a shift in perspective Nuisance Bear reveals an obstacle course of tourist paparazzi and wildlife officers whom bears must navigate during their annual migration.\n\nThe Process\n\n15Mins\n\nTom Randall is a rock climber known for his commitment to training and the courageous and, at times, outrageous challenges he sets himself. This time, Tom has set his mind on becoming proficient and efficient in the sport of fell running and he has a madcap idea to try and complete the previously un-attempted Lakes Classic Rock Challenge and a Bob Graham link-up in 24 hours. That’s 15 classic Lakeland rock climbs, 42 summits, and 142 kilometres. What lengths is he willing to go to achieve his goal and when is enough, enough? Sometimes letting things go is an act of far greater power than hanging on...\n\nSaving Glaciers\n\n8Mins\n\nA scientist and his team on a mission to save the inevitable melting of glaciers in the Alps. Determined that the melting and eventual disappearance of the glaciers in the Alps can be averted, dr. Felix Keller, a Swiss glaciologist, and his team set out to develop a complex snow cabling system, recycling glacial meltwater into snow. Unlike others, their solution can be scaled up enough to save an entire Morteratsch glacier. Enthusiasm, resilience, and love for the Alps reflect in these locals’ efforts to save the winter for future generations.\n\nSheri (Tour Edit)\n\n18Mins\n\nSheri Tingey’s 60-year career as a woman who has defied the odds by starting a company at age 50 that has revolutionized the outdoor industry. The film is a story about the hurdles she overcame to launch the company, about the ways she hid from view so that people would judge the boats, not her role in creating them. At this watershed moment of reckoning around equity and inclusion for the industry, Sheri’s life story will both warm audiences, and ask them to grapple with important questions about who belongs.\n\nSinner Fields (Tour Edit)\n\n14Mins\n\nA bavarian story of living in a camper van as a full-time skier. My 2022 winter season split in three segments (Sun, Snow and season final Kaunertal.) combined with a special kind of humor. Also there is a segment of a blessing 10 day trip to East Tyrol in January 2021 sneaked in. Entirely filmed in the Austrian alps. Between the skiing segments, I gave my own comedy a try. Playing with bad accent, acting as the lonely camping-wolf and joking in a self ironic way. A very specific type of humor I would say but despite the bad English, not to far from the truth and therefore very personal.\n\nTo The Hills & Back\n\n46Mins\n\nAt a remote backcountry cabin, a veteran mountain guide and his daughter connect and reflect upon a lifetime in the mountains. A torch is being passed within their family’s legacy of guides and they discuss the history of those that have come and gone, some too soon. Stories unfold, from the early pioneers to modern day hard charging enthusiasts, and we hear from several characters including those with life shattering events.\n\nWild Waters (Tour Edit)\n\n45Mins\n\nAdventurer, competitor, daughter, friend, pioneer, hero, and badass human are all words used to describe French kayaker, Nouria Newman. In Wild Waters, we follow Nouria as she prepares to become the first female to run a 100-foot (30 m) waterfall; we watch her grow from a young, keen Olympic hopeful to one of the greatest kayakers of all times - male or female. However, running some of the world’s hardest whitewater isn't Nouria's biggest life challenge. Realizing that the expectations placed upon her as both an athlete and as a woman weight heavily on her decisions and ambitions, she pushes back to make her own path. It is this central aspect of her life – this refusal to conform to others’ expectations – where Nouria is able to use kayaking as a way to transform into her truest self, and become a once-in-a-generation kayaker.\n\nWood Hood\n\n16Mins\n\nDeVaughn is a 15-year-old kid from New York City who loves skateboarding and craves a \"quiet place\" to escape the chaos of his home, the city, and kids that steal from him. The film follows a weekend-long group camping trip, and as we weave between the city and the woods, a place that is unfamiliar and historically inaccessible to many, we witness the joy and growth that is possible when kids have an opportunity to find that \"quiet place\"."
