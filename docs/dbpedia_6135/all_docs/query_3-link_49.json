        "text": "Training Wheels is a fun romantic comedy playing at the Sundance Film Festival. The short film is about a woman named Enid (Alison Rich, also the writer and director) who is two days away from a big date. The catch? Enid is socially inept and has never been in a romantic relationship. She decides to contact a website call Casanovas and rent a man to teach her how to act on a date.\n\nThe set-up is there for a traditional rom-com and the movie checks off all the right boxes. Rich is hilarious as Enid. Her reservations about her dating prowess turn out to be entirely correct as even making small talk is difficult for her. Subtle things like the way Enid stands adds to the hopelessness of the character. George Basil is also fantastic in the role of Enid’s instructor Ricky Mountain. His introduction to the audience sets the tempo for what type of character he is. As great as his one liners are, Training Wheels also has heart. Ricky genuinely wants to help Enid out.\n\nTraining Wheels is an entertaining rom com that fans of the genre should love. Even in a condensed form it is funny, sweet, and has two leads that will engage audiences. The film leans into its comedy and is all about having fun. Those who do not normally watch the genre will definitely get some laughs from this."
