        "text": "For most of us, our obsession with cars began at a young age. Whether it was playing on racing mats with Hot Wheels or absorbing automobiles on screens, the avenues to become a car fan are numerous. Because of this, many movie studios have produced excellent car films aimed toward younger audiences.\n\nWith plenty of speed-bending action, lovable characters, and great role models for the kids, these films aren't just for car fans, either. Consider these flicks for your next family movie night—but be prepared for a chorus of ka-chows! Here are our favorite car movies for kids.\n\nIf you're looking for even more ways to entertain young car fans, check out the R&T Crew magazine and subscription box, which features all sorts of auto-themed goodies."
