        "text": "color in film\n\nBefore there was color in film\n\nBlack and white cinematography dominated the first decades of filmmaking. Companies like Technicolor began experimenting with color film proecesses in the '20s. But it wasn't until the 1950s that color cinematography replaced black and white as the predominant style.\n\nWith the explosion of color in film, a new approach to the movie color palette had to be created. The artists who’d used light and shadow to tell stories now had far more tools at their disposal.\n\nIt was what you might call a game changer.\n\nCOLOR PALETTES IN FILM\n\nHow can color tell a story?\n\nThe primary reason for using color in film might be obvious: to make the images colorful, dynamic, and beautiful. But there is a secondary reason that facilitates visual storytelling. That's right, the best uses of color in film also tell a story.\n\nLewis Bond’s color theory video, posted on Channel Criswell, is not only a practical analysis of how movie color palettes enhance storytelling, but also an engaging historical recap on the maturation of color in film. Let's use this video as a primer for our discussion on film color theory.\n\nColor in Storytelling by Criswell\n\nColor in filmmaking is a huge part of mise-en-scene, or the overall effect of everything we see in the frame. Color can affect us emotionally, psychologically and even physically, often without us becoming aware.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Wes Anderson uses color in film to balance tone. Specifically, how Anderson tends to have depressed characters dealing with personal trauma while being surrounded by the brightest and most optimistic colors.\n\nThis is a huge part of Wes Anderson's directing style.\n\nAnderson's movie color palette • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nColor in film can build harmony or tension within a scene. Bring attention to a key theme. And that’s just the start.\n\nWhen telling a story, colors:\n\nElicit psychological reactions\n\nDraw focus to significant details\n\nSet the tone of the movie\n\nRepresent character traits\n\nShow changes or arcs in the story\n\nWe know that color in filmmaking can be used to tell stories but how? What do the individual colors represent or suggest? And how can they be combined to communicate multi-layered meaning? Let's continue with a quick look at the psychology behind film color theory.\n\npsychology of color\n\nThe psychology behind colors in film\n\nA well-designed movie color palette evokes mood and sets the tone for the film. When choosing a particular color, remember that there are three main components — hue, saturation, and brightness.\n\nHue – the color itself\n\nSaturation – intensity of the color\n\nBrightness – The darkness or lightness of a color\n\nAs Bond mentions in his film color theory video, many viewers will have predictably similar reactions to certain colors. A strong red color has been shown to raise blood pressure, while a blue color elicits a calming effect (more on this when we discuss lightsabers later).\n\nStanley Kubrick's directing style relies heavily on color to create highly impressionable images and scenes. With color in mise en scene, Kubrick is a filmmaker that understand that color has a direct and powerful impact on the viewer. Here's a breakdown of the color palette across all of Kubrick's best films.\n\nKubrick's Color Palette • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nIn one of the best M. Night Shyamalan movies The Sixth Sense, red color is used to represent fear, dread, and foreshadowing; whereas, in Pleasantville, Gary Ross uses red to represent hope, love and sensuality. Red creates an experience in the viewer, so target its presence in your film color palette carefully.\n\nColor Theory in Film • The Sixth Sense\n\nYou can already see how choosing the right colors for the right spots can create emotions your audience may not even be aware of. But don’t just start picking colors for your movie color palette out of a hat. One way to bring color into your projects is to create a mood board.\n\nThis can be done with a mood board app or by using a free mood board template. Creating a mood board is just one of many early ideation steps in the Pre-Production Process. If you’ve done some work with mood boards, the next step is to bring your movie color palette ideas to life with dedicated storyboard software.\n\nStoryboarding in StudioBinder\n\nTo show you what we mean, we've put together a handy dandy infographic that you can download for reference. We've grouped the major colors on the color wheel with their most common emotional associations. As you considering color in your next project, it might help to start with the emotional resonance of the scene and base your movie color palette around that.\n\nColor Theory in Film • StudioBinder Mood Board\n\nColor theory norms should be understood by filmmakers, but never seen as a limitation. So, choose your color palettes wisely! Like every other part of filmmaking, you should consider the use of color in film from the very beginning.\n\nAs you do, make sure that you keep your film color palette in mind. Let's move on to look at color schemes, movie color palette examples and all the beautiful and meaningful ways color in filmmaking is used.\n\ncolor schemes in film\n\nMovie color palette examples\n\nSo, creating a balanced color scheme might be trickier than initially thought. You can’t just have every image on your shot list be red.\n\nWhile it doesn’t necessarily sound “balanced” to have a movie where everything is blue and orange, those colors are complementary on the color wheel. So, that would in fact be a very balanced use of color in film.\n\nLet’s go over the types of color schemes you can employ to create a balanced movie color palette.\n\nMONOCHROMATIC COLOR SCHEMES\n\nWe’ll start off with the monochromatic color scheme.\n\nA monochromatic color scheme is when a single base “hue” is extended out using shades, tones, and tints. Tints are achieved by adding whites, and shades by adding black.\n\nExample of monochromatic color palette: The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nAs you can see in this image from one of the best Wes Anderson Movies The Grand Budapest Hotel, his team utilized a monochromatic color scheme. Light pink gives way to deeper purples. The result keeps the chosen color tone intact, but it allows you to create contrast within it.\n\nMonochromatic color schemes come in shades of a single color such as red, dark red, and pink. They create a deeply harmonious feeling that is soft, lulling and soothing.\n\nOne of the best action movies, The Matrix is another good example of a monochromatic movie color scheme. Nearly every scene set within The Matrix itself utilizes a green color palette. Shades of green permeate everything in the frame to create an unnatural, sickly effect.\n\nExample of monochromatic color palette in The Matrix\n\nMonochromatic color schemes don’t require that your film be homogenous in its look. It just gives you a color hue within which to create contrast.\n\nCOMPLEMENTARY COLOR SCHEMES\n\nComplementary color schemes are when two colors from opposite sides of the color wheel are used in conjunction with one another to form the color palettes.\n\nThe goal of complementary color palettes is to create a visual ‘life’ in the frame. Red and green, in the instance of Amelie, both pop more in the presence of their complementary color.\n\nExample of complementary color pallettes in film: Amelie\n\nContrasting drama (i.e. warm vs. cool), complementary colors live opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, orange and blue are complementary colors commonly used in the color palettes of many blockbuster films.\n\nDueling colors are often associated with internal or external conflict. No matter the color selection, complementary colors combine warm and cool colors to produce a high-contrast, vibrant tension in the film.\n\nANALOGOUS COLOR SCHEMES\n\nAnalogous color schemes utilize colors that are next to one another on the complementary color wheel. They tend to occur in nature and create a harmonious feeling that is pleasing to the eye.\n\nGood examples of neighboring colors that can create analogous color schemes are red & violet, or yellow & lime green. Since the colors lack the contrast and tension of the complementary colors, they instead create a kind of visual unity.\n\nIn general when creating an analogous color scheme, one color is chosen to dominate, a second to support, and a third (along with blacks, whites and grey tones) to accent.\n\nChildren of Men’s analogous color scheme seemed to match the dangerous state of its world in which no more children were being born. By focusing on analogous colors (and thereby eliminating the rest), the dire situation is matched with a dire color scheme.\n\nAn analogous color palette in movies: Children of Men\n\nIn one of the best crime movies, Traffic, color schemes are used in multiple ways — to establish each parallel story and to connect them to each other. Essentially, these analogous color schemes end up creating a different kind of complementary color scheme.\n\nFor example, the scenes featuring Michael Douglas use an analogous color scheme of blues. The scenes featuring Benicio Del Toro use an analogous color scheme of oranges.\n\nExample of analogous color scheme: Traffic\n\nBeing one of the best Steven Soderbergh movies, it's pretty crafty to give different story lines their own color schemes. This, in turn, uses juxtaposition to create a completely different color scheme. No doubt, this master plan was aided by a complex mood board and storyboarding process, resulting in an excellent example of color in film.\n\nTRIADIC COLOR SCHEMES\n\nA triadic color scheme is when three colors that are evenly spaced around the complementary color wheel are used in conjunction.\n\nOne color in the triadic colors scheme is chosen to be the dominant one with other two used in complementary fashion. Triadic color schemes are somewhat less common because they can look a bit cartoonish, especially when the HSB are all elevated, like in Superman.\n\nExample of triadic color scheme in Superman\n\nBut does that mean that a triadic color scheme can only be used in movies like Superman? No, of course not, and the way around this is to keep avoid HSB lower: less bright and less saturated.\n\nSymbolism in movie color palettes\n\nHow to use color in film symbolically\n\nThere are many ways to create symbolism in a film, but using different types of color schemes might be one of the most effective.\n\nEven if the audience isn’t entirely conscious of the symbolism coming from the color palette (like maybe they are with discordant color schemes) they will be affected by it. We’ll cover a few different wants to creating powerful connections between ideas and themes through the use of your color palette here.\n\nDISCORDANT COLOR\n\nDiscordant use of color in movies can help a character, detail, or moment truly stand out from the rest of the film. For example, the color blue in Amelie, or the color red in The Sixth Sense.\n\nExamples of color discordance in movies\n\nDiscordance is a deliberate choice by the director to deviate from the balanced types of color schemes and color palettes we’ve mentioned to refocus attention.\n\nWhy? Well, for one by creating discordance you create a pretty obvious symbol. A movie color palette could all be one way, learning towards one direction, but then suddenly one element sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nFor example, the girl’s jacket in one of the best WW2 movies, Schindler’s List. The girl’s red jacket, in the otherwise black and white film, is a clearly meant to be symbolic.\n\nSchindler's List uses color discordance to create a powerful symbol\n\nNot all examples of discordance in movie color palettes are so clear cut. But when a director and design team make a choice like this, they make it for a reason. It's one way to create symbols with color in film.\n\nIn neo-noir classic (not to be confused with film noir) Sin City, the sudden discordance within the color palette is a reflection of graphic artist Frank Miller’s style.\n\nIt also helps make certain elements “pop” in an attempt to capture the look and feel of Miller's original graphic novels.\n\nColor discordance: Sin City has a playful color palette\n\nA movie's color palette is yet another place where storyteller’s can create conflict and drama. All it takes is mismatching colors in the right places. In the next section, we'll talk about how to use color in film to represent characters, ideas, and themes.\n\nASSOCIATIVE COLOR SCHEMES\n\nAssociate colors in film refers to when a recurring color or scheme represents a theme or character in a film, thereby connecting visual spectacle with emotional storytelling.\n\nIn one of the top Christopher Nolan movies, The Dark Knight, both key characters in the drama have their own associative colors palettes.\n\nExample of associative color palettes in The Dark Knight\n\nContrasting with Batman’s dark blacks and grays were The Joker’s slightly muted clown colors of purple and green. The clash between them came to represent a clash between the simple order of dark tones and the funhouse horror chaos of the Joker's mismatched colors.\n\nOne of the most famous associative uses of color in movies was the role of orange in one of the best mafia movies, Francis Ford Coppola’s all-time classic The Godfather.\n\nOrange is associated with death in the film, often as a precursor to sudden and messy violence.\n\nExample of associative colors in The Godfather\n\nUnlike the gangster films that had come before, The Godfather approached violence in a more brutal and ugly fashion. So, it made sense that in a world of crushed blacks and desaturated tones, a bright incongruous orange tone would indicate the coming violence.\n\nQuentin Tarantino loves to play with different types of color schemes, and in one of his best movies (Kill Bill: Vol. 1) he gave his central character “The Bride” her own color: bright yellow.\n\nExemple of associative color palettes in Kill Bill: Vol. 1\n\nOf course, a lot of the time blood red was also her color but that's neither here nor there. Due to The Bride's insatiable thirst for revenge, drenching her in bright yellow helps us make a connection between color and character.\n\nIn one of the best sequels out there, The Empire Strikes Back, associative colors are use both with the characters, and their position in the story’s main conflict. Darth Vader is black, with a bright red lightsaber, contrasting to Luke’s lighter earth tones and whites, and blue lightsaber.\n\nExample of associative colors in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) movie\n\nThese colors combined to convey an emotional state from the character. Black and red are violent and menacing where blue and white are cool and comforting.\n\nWhen a recurring film palette or color represents a character or larger theme in the film.\n\nIn Vertigo, the bright green is used as a callback to when main character Scotty first became transfixed with the woman he was supposed to be investigating. Much later, after the woman’s death, he spots a look-alike and begs her to try and look more like the woman he first fell for.\n\nVertigo • Associative Color Schemes\n\nUsing color palettes to create powerful connections between your characters and meaning is a tool no filmmaker should ignore. The more examples you study, the better.\n\nTRANSITIONAL COLOR SCHEMES\n\nTransitional color usage is when a change in colors and color palette indicates a shift of some sort. This could be a shift in mood or tone, between different movie genres, or within the characters themselves.\n\nOver the course of the classic anti-hero series Breaking Bad, Walter White lives a double life as alter ego Heisenberg. Walter White lives a double life as a mild-mannered science teacher and his vicious, drug kingpin alter ego, Heisenberg.\n\nHow to Use Transitional Colors in Film\n\nWalter White's color palette is lighter, softer and has a use of cooler primary color palette. Heisenberg has a much darker, yet still analogous color palette.\n\nThe transition of iconic character Luke Skywalker was less obvious, but still well reflected in a major shift in his color palette.\n\nOriginally he was clad in lighter earth tones. This both reflected his ‘farm boy’ upbringing, but his place on the ‘light side’ of the force. Once Luke has gone through his Jedi training, and learned of his true identity as the Darth Vader’s son, Luke shows up in all black.\n\nTransitional Film Color Palette: Luke Skywalker\n\nIt both reflects the serious and adult quality the ‘kid’ is now imbued with, but also that he has a dark streak in him, and a potentially dangerous connection to evil.\n\nIn the case of Up, following the Pixar storytelling formula, the shift in color palette represents a change in story tone. A happy gleeful time has given way to a dark depressing reality. The darker reality is shown in shadow, with a bleak drab color palette.\n\nExample of transitional colors in Up\n\nThe Up movie color palette shift isn't necessary — we can see for ourselves what has happened to Carl and his wife. But the color shift amplifies the emotions on screen. It brings that intangible element to visual storytelling that we feel more than we see."
