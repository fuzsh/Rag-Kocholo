        "meta_description": "The British North has featured regularly on screen since 1959. The representation of its industrial and urban features has given birth to a two-pronged mythical construction over sixty years: a geographical and a psychoanalytical/gendered one using the figure of the Northerner. Cinema is a myth and identity maker but it is also a medium which has reflected the socioeconomic evolutions of the North, first synonymous with relative prosperity and modernity until the 1980s, then decline and recession owing to deindustrialisation. Simultaneously, films try to deconstruct both the archetypal North – which ends up being geographically and socioeconomically more diverse than it first seems to be – and the figure of the Northerner – who takes his self-proclaimed image or the one that the South seeks to give him with a pinch of salt. The common identity of Northerners mostly channelled through their common aversion towards the South nonetheless leads them to reconstruct the myth of their native North.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nConstructing the Myth of the North\n\nDepicting the Reality of the North\n\nDeconstructing the Myth of the North\n\n9Alongside its social realist ambition, cinema likes to play with the myths it creates or contributes to maintain. Many films turn out to be attempts at deconstructing both the archetypal North – which ends up being geographically and socioeconomically more diverse than it first seems to be – and the figure of the Northerner – who takes the image he gives himself or that the South seeks to give him with a pinch of salt.\n\n10The contemporary and working-class North is not only synonymous with an urban and industrial world. The counterexamples set in the country or in the Lake District are rare enough (Whistle Down the Wind, Local Hero, This Filthy Earth, My Summer of Love, White Settlers, God’s Own Country) but the films featuring the working class hero almost always include a scene in a more rural area. The hero’s presence in this kind of environment may seem bizarre since the bucolic North is so associated in viewers’ minds with heritage films – among which the famous adaptations of literary classics with the numerous versions of North and South, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights but also Women in Love, Love and Friendship – a genre that is often deemed conservative and always set in a more distant past, focusing on the lives of higher social classes. A working-class rural counterpoint is a way of showing a multifaceted North as well as placing the working class hero within a literary tradition, making him the heir of the pastoral and romanticism. Far from distorting his representation, this connection rather expresses his response to the alienation he feels due to his social condition and his fears of a potential erosion of his identity. Rural scenes often tainted with nostalgia for a preindustrial North signal the hero’s unconscious fantasy over the image of a pastoral England symbolising feudal society. Forgetting his status for a moment, the Northerner becomes just a man in his natural habitat. Over sixty years, his love of nature reveals he thinks he can escape first from his harsh working conditions (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Kes) then the harmful effects of unemployment (TwentyFourSeven, The Angels’ Share) but these rural breaks are short and ambivalent. While expressing the hero’s deepest desires, they reveal personal, socioeconomic and existential tension. The only time Mrs Hammond (This Sporting Life) looks happy with Machin and her children is when they play football in front of the ruins of an old abbey. However, Machin has to go back to the city and endure the rough shocks of rugby if he wants to be able to pay for his costly Rolls-Royce trips to the country. The editing further reinforces the transience of the moment since the scene is inserted as a flash-back between the party scene during which the hero suffers from broken teeth and a rugby match (see also Room at the Top, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, A Taste of Honey, Kes, My Son the Fanatic, T2 Trainspotting). Nature as a form of escapism thus remains an illusion because it always sends the hero back to his condition as a worker in the end.\n\nConclusion: Reconstructing the Myth of the North\n\n17Over the decades, the North on screen has remained proud of its history and the imagery it has generated, mostly a grim but dignified industrial North and a beautiful but threatening rural North. With its will to construct and deconstruct the myth of the North since 1959, British cinema has clearly exploited the North/South rivalry which has become a source of creative tension. It thus keeps fuelling the debate about the North/South divide but clearly seems to have chosen its side by having firmly anchored – and popularised – a certain Northern identity at the heart of the British national culture and imagination."
