        "text": "For other uses, see Thomas and the Magic Railroad (disambiguation).\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad is a 2000 British-American fantasy adventure film based on The Railway Series, the television series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and its American spin-off Shining Time Station. It was produced by Gullane Pictures, The Britt Allcroft Company, Isle of Man Film Commission and Destination Films and was distributed by Icon Productions in the UK and Ireland and Destination Films in the US. It stars Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda, Mara Wilson, Michael E. Rodgers, Cody McMains, Didi Conn, Russell Means and Lori Hallier, with the voices of Eddie Glen, Neil Crone, Kevin Frank, Susan Roman, Linda Ballantyne, Colm Feore, Shelley-Elizabeth Skinner and Britt Allcroft, who also wrote, directed and produced. In the 110-minute uncut version of the film, it includes original voice talents by John Bellis, Michael Angelis, Keith Scott and Patrick Breen and the performances of Doug Lennox. The latter five roles were ultimately cut from the final film.\n\nReleased in cinemas on 14 July 2000 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and on 26 July 2000 in the United States and Canada, Thomas and the Magic Railroad was lambasted by critics upon its initial release, with criticism of the acting, plot, special effects and lack of fidelity to its source material, with several critics pointing out the uneven connection to Shining Time Station, with many stating that it never aired in the UK. Grossing $19.7 million worldwide on its production budget of $19 million, the film was a box office bomb and is frequently labeled as one of the biggest box office bombs in history. A sequel was originally conceived by Destination Films, revealed on 1 July 2000, though was quietly cancelled.\n\nPlot\n\nMr. Conductor begins the film by introducing Thomas the Tank Engine, his engine friends and the Island of Sodor.\n\nAt Killaban, Gordon complains to Thomas that he is eight seconds late with his passenger local. Thomas retorts that Gordon is being bossy, because he wants to be really reliable and right on time and says that he has to find Mr. Conductor, who is looking after the North Western Railway while Sir Topham Hatt is taking a holiday. When Gordon claims they can take care of themselves, he then changes his mind when an evil diesel named Diesel 10 speeds by, kicking up dust and dirt and leaving Gordon physically and literally rattling in fear. Thomas reminds him how devious Diesel 10 is and how he is rated 10 out of 10 for devious deeds and brutal strength and for his hatred of steam engines.\n\nMr. Conductor then introduces his home town of Shining Time, where we see happy residents, full of life at the station.\n\nThomas is later thinking trouble is soon to come if Diesel 10 has unfinished business. He talks to James at Tidmouth Sheds, after he accidentally bumps into some buffers. James explains that he was shut up in the sheds by Sir Topham Hatt for being naughty, when Diesel 10 shows up and voices his plan to destroy a lost engine named Lady and thus establish diesels as the dominant engines on Sodor. While James is confused, Thomas is worried and goes to find Mr. Conductor.\n\nAfter seeing Billy Twofeathers' map and noticing some strange lines on it, a boy from Shining Time named Patch heads off to Muffle Mountain to see Burnett Stone once the Rainbow Sun arrives.\n\nThere is something on Muffle Mountain, a secret that Burnett only shared with his childhood friend and future wife Tasha: he promised he would drive an engine and take her with him. When Patch sees the engine, Burnett reveals the engine's past - her name is Lady since she was sealed inside Muffle Mountain after Diesel 10 crashed and nearly destroyed her long ago. Burnett has fixed her up but informs Patch that she still needs coal to fully run again. Unfortunately, Lady requires special coal to build up steam, which he has not found yet.\n\nAt Diesel 10's mountain, Diesel 10 tells his sidekicks Splatter and Dodge of his plan to get rid of the lost engine. The two bumbling diesels report that Mr. Conductor is coming to Sodor, so Diesel 10 decides to destroy him too, only to humiliate himself in front of Splatter and Dodge when his claw whacks him on the nose.\n\nMr. Conductor prepares to leave Shining Time. Despite difficulty with his gold dust and a little chat with Stacy about Burnett's pass, he soon meets Thomas on Sodor. Thomas reports that Diesel 10 is back but Mr. Conductor was confident that he can use his gold dust to keep Diesel 10 in order.\n\nBurnett looks at a painting of Lady and starts to have doubts in his belief of magic due to his failure to guard her. Meanwhile, far away, Burnett's granddaughter, Lily, prepares to visit him.\n\nThomas, James and Gordon begin arguing about who should have taken Mr. Conductor and Gordon boasts that Thomas is too small to do important jobs, which angers Thomas as he shunts some Troublesome Trucks, unaware that Splatter and Dodge are shunting trucks nearby. Over in the yard, Splatter and Dodge are spying at the steam engines. Henry tells the other engines about why Diesel 10 wants to find the lost engine, Percy and James decide to find her before Diesel 10 does. Splatter and Dodge continue to laugh at Thomas as Harold flies by spreading sneezing powder, dumped by Diesel 10, over all Thomas and on them as well.\n\nAt Knapford, Mr. Conductor reads the letter Sir Topham Hatt left him. After trying on his top hat and returning it after he notices the portrait of the Controller appears angry, then smiling, he receives a phone call from Sir Topham Hatt and receives his instructions.\n\nThat night, the engines are asleep at Tidmouth Sheds but Mr. Conductor is having a hard time trying to sleep and pretends to talk with a ball and a bat. But that does no good and then has a cup of cocoa, when Diesel 10 rolls up and demolishes the scaffolding of the sheds with his powerful claw and scares the engines awake. Mr. Conductor taunts Diesel 10 but then finally discovers that he has run out of gold dust. As Diesel 10, delighted, tries to force Mr. Conductor to confess to the lost engine's whereabouts otherwise he will destroy the shed even more but Mr. Conductor frightens Diesel 10 away with a bag of sugar after he threatens to dump the entire bag in his fuel tanks to seize him up permanently. Mr. Conductor voices his concern about his gold dust but tells the engines to go back to sleep, despite their concerns.\n\nLater that night, Mr. Conductor has a nightmare of Shining Time in ruins and Stacy Jones begging him to come back home. He soon realises that his universe is in danger and that he needs more gold dust.\n\nThe next morning, Mutt goes to Lily's hometown with Billy, as he knows that Lily can help Mr. Conductor but only if she meets someone special at Shining Time first. To reach that end, he intentionally directs her onto the wrong train, placing her on the train bound for Shining Time instead of the train to Muffle Mountain. Meanwhile, Burnett Stone hears the sound of Lady's magic echoing through the mountain.\n\nBack on Sodor, Mr. Conductor is helping make James' itch go away. When James notices that Mr. Conductor looks so tired and asks if it is because he is red considering Diesel 10's negative opinion of the colour, he happily reassures him that red is bright and cheerful just like his gold dust. He then sends James off to work while he departs to deal with his own problems.\n\nMr. Conductor goes to the windmill in search of more gold dust but ends up lost. He tries to blow his whistle but his gold dust is completely gone. Meanwhile, the engines gather for a meeting. As Bertie passes by and tells them to smile, all have their individual concerns about Diesel 10 destroying Lady (while Henry has a stuffed-up smokebox). Thomas heads off to look for Mr. Conductor to help him. Bertie offers a race with Thomas but Thomas declines the offer and decides to help Mr. Conductor solve some mysteries.\n\nMr. Conductor finds a note left by Rabbit and tries a carrot and a stick of celery to make him think properly and has the idea of his beach-loving cousin Junior, who has used up most of his gold dust too, by snoring the whole time during his nap. He tells Junior to go to Shining Time Station first and pick up his emergency whistle, then go to Sodor and warns him not to talk to anyone about the buffers. Before he can say anything else, the phone line goes dead.\n\nThe Rainbow Sun arrives at Shining Time and Mutt barks at Lily to get off the train. Lily finds the station empty and meets Junior. After a talk, Lily picks up the gold dust Junior leaves behind. At Sodor, Mr. Conductor is sleeping by a bush when he has another nightmare about Shining Time in ruins, the Big Dipper crumbling and Lady's wheels rolling on the rails. He soon wakes up when he hears Thomas calling his name. Mr. Conductor tries to reply but poor Thomas cannot hear him as he chuffs away.\n\nLily meets Stacy, who takes her to Burnett who is giving directions to a biker. That night, Burnett and Lily hear Lady's whistle coming from the mountains. Patch, who is outside with his horse, hears it too.\n\nAs Percy arrives at Knapford with the Mail Train, he and Thomas talk about Mr. Conductor and conclude that he travels to Sodor on a magic railroad by a set of magic buffers, as Percy overheard him the night before. Diesel 10 overhears them and goes to the Sodor Ironworks to tell Splatter and Dodge his plan. Toby, who has secretly followed them there, hears their plans when the diesels arrive and distracts them by ringing his bell. Trying to smash him, Diesel 10's claw causes the shed to crash down on him, Splatter and Dodge, thus blocking their path and trapping them underneath it.\n\nThe next day, with the diesels trapped, the steam engines work very hard on the main and branch lines, delivering goods and passengers to every station and yards, as repairs continue.\n\nThomas finds Henry suffering a boiler ache and offers to fetch six trucks of special Island of Sodor coal to make him better. Thomas does not notice the sixth truck rolling away into some magic buffers. Bertie passes and greets Thomas and his five trucks; Thomas is confused. When he tells Percy about the missing truck while pulling Annie and Clarabel, they realise that the buffers where the truck disappeared are the buffers leading to the Magic Railroad. Thomas tells Percy to guard the buffers while he goes to find Mr. Conductor, citing that Percy is a brave engine.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Conductor is wandering aimlessly when Diesel 10 appears. Mr. Conductor is captured by Diesel 10's claw and is dangled over the Big Dipper. Diesel 10 reveals that he knows about the buffers and threatens to drop Mr. Conductor if he does not reveal its whereabouts. Mr. Conductor notices the viaduct has begun to lose chunks of pieces, just like in his dream and realises the world is beginning to fall apart without the gold dust. Mr. Conductor escapes by cutting a hydraulic tube to Diesel 10's claw, thus catapulting him to the windmill, much to Diesel 10's rage and fury. There, he sees the words: \"Stoke up the magic in the mountain and the Lady will smile, then watch the swirls that spin so well.\"\n\nLater, Splatter and Dodge ask Diesel 10 why he let Mr. Conductor escape, he replies that he just did it on purpose and was testing to see if he could escape. Splatter and Dodge thinks that he is lying and mock him and Diesel 10 angrily decides to attempt to teach them \"How to stop being stupid,\" but makes an even bigger mistake when he taps the coal hopper above him with his claw and pours coal all over himself with his claw. James, Gordon and Henry laugh at Diesel 10.\n\nLily is introduced to Patch, who offers her a horse ride to Shining Time. There, she meets Junior again, who offers to take her to Sodor via the magic buffers. But as they were floating, Junior tells her that the Magic Railroad is vanishing and about the lost engine. Along the way, they notice the missing coal truck that Thomas bumped earlier and soon they make it to Sodor. They meet Thomas, who agrees to help and uncouples Annie and Clarabel, together they find Mr. Conductor at the windmill. When Mr. Conductor tells Junior about his clue to the gold dust, Lily is introduced to Mr. Conductor. While their backs are turned, Junior climbs onto the sail, as the strong wind current blows him off and he lands onto Diesel 10. Meanwhile Patch tells Burnett that he has no idea where Lily is since she was not at the station when he went back for her. Despite Lily having apparently vanished, Burnett is confident she will turn up again.\n\nThat night, Percy finds Splatter and Dodge at the magic buffers. He tries to stay brave like Thomas says he is but he is too easily frightened by a flock of crows, a talking tumbleweed and a slamming door. Splatter and Dodge argue about who tells Diesel 10 about the Magic Buffers until an owl frightens them. Finally they suggest telling Diesel 10 about the buffers tomorrow and Percy races back to warn Thomas.\n\nMr. Conductor and Lily camp out with Thomas. Mr. Conductor tries to keep Lily entertained but she is worried about being late as her grandfather told her to return by sunset. After a conversation, they realise that Burnett may hold the key to the clue of the gold dust. As Burnett reveals to Patch that Lady is magic, they realise that the railroad is vanishing and that it needs Lady. But Burnett does not know her secret and time is running out.\n\nThomas and Percy do not want Diesel 10 to get rid of the Magic Railroad, so they know they must get Lily back to Burnett at Muffle Mountain now before trouble occurs. Thomas wonders how Lily can get home without gold dust, Mr. Conductor reveals that only the lost engine could do so now. Then he has the idea and asks Thomas if he will take Lily to Muffle Mountain. Thomas is not sure but decides that he will try before he and Lily set off. Guided by a tumbleweed, the two roll right through the magic buffers. While journeying through the Magic Railroad, they discover the missing truck. Lily realises the connection between the truck and the clue, so Thomas decides to go back for it and couple up to before setting off again. They soon arrive on Muffle Mountain with the coal truck behind them. As Lily leaves to find Burnett, a gust of wind blows Thomas down the hill, away from the coal truck and back into the Magic Railroad through another portal at the bottom.\n\nLily finds Patch, who takes her to Burnett's workshop. Lily figures out only special Island of Sodor coal can make Lady steam, so she sends Patch to collect the coal from the truck.\n\nDiesel 10, with Junior still on his cab, races into the Smelters where he corners James who is working there. Junior tries to whistle both of them out, only to discover that he, too, is out of gold dust. As Diesel 10 drives the two closer into a melting pit, Junior uses the last of his extra gold dust to teleport himself and James away to safety much to Diesel 10's bewilderment. The two arrive near the buffers, where Mr. Conductor is there waiting. James happily departs, while Mr. Conductor and Junior, both out of gold dust, refuse to give up hope. Lily asks Burnett Stone if Tasha took a ride on Lady and if she loved her as much as Burnett did. Burnett says that she loved Lady because he loved her but could not fix her in time for Tasha to take a ride on her before she passed away.\n\nBy now, Burnett Stone has finally succeeded in making Lady steam, by using the special Island of Sodor coal from the truck Thomas and Lily picked up from the Magic Railroad. Together with Lily, Patch and Mutt on board, they set off into the Magic Railroad. The railroad, receiving energy from Lady, comes back to life, while Lady's face appears. The team reunite with Thomas, who is right behind them, before appearing on Sodor through the buffers, where they reunite with the two conductors. Junior happily states they can go to Shining Time but Mr. Conductor fears that they will not make it back to Shining Time until they have gold dust.\n\nBefore the team can find the rest of the clue, Thomas appears from the buffers but they are found by Diesel 10, Splatter and Dodge. Diesel 10 starts to close in on the two engines, with his claw raised up and orders his cronies to destroy Lady but Splatter and Dodge, fed up with Diesel 10's ways, decide to abandon him. Thomas offers to help Lady, with Burnett driving Lady. Mr. Conductor warns them about the unsafe collapsing viaduct. Just as the engines run away from the large diesel, the conductors realize that Lady is part of the clue to the gold dust.\n\nDiesel 10 chases the two fleeing engines and Burnett throughout the Kirk Ronan sites and even run pass Percy pulling a train, until they approach the Big Dipper. As Lady and Burnett pass, a gap appears on the viaduct. When Thomas manages to make it across the gap just in time before it gives way, whistling in victory, Diesel 10 brakes hard but falls off due to his weight. He tries to hang on to a sleeper but it breaks off and he falls into a sludge barge pulled by a tugboat and is towed away.\n\nThomas, Lady and Burnett return, where they and the rest of the team work out the answer to the riddle. Lily mixes water from the well with golden shavings from the magic railroad and with a little encouragement, tosses them into the air, where they form into gold dust. Delighted, the conductors resupply their whistles, while Thomas and Lady thank each other.\n\nPatch and Mutt go to look around, while Junior gives Lily some gold dust. Junior tells Mr. Conductor that he wants to work now, so Mr. Conductor gives him his hat and sends him to a railroad with \"palm trees and sunny spells.\" After Junior leaves, Sir Topham Hatt calls and says that he is on his way back, so Mr. Conductor sets off to welcome him, letting Sir Topham Hatt know that everything is under control before he hangs up. Lily offers her gold dust to Burnett, who sprinkles it on her bluebird toy and whispers that they will \"always remember their Shining Time together.\"\n\nWith Lady and the Magic Railroad back to life, Shining Time is now restored to its old glory. Thomas happily puffs home to Tidmouth Sheds into the sunset and the end credits roll.\n\nCharacters\n\nThomas\n\nHenry\n\nGordon\n\nJames\n\nPercy\n\nToby\n\nAnnie and Clarabel\n\nBertie\n\nHarold\n\nTroublesome Trucks (do not speak; full roles cut)\n\nCranky (cameo; full role cut)\n\nHenrietta (cameo)\n\nButch (cameo)\n\nSir Topham Hatt (voice only; portrait cameo)\n\nLady Hatt (mentioned; portrait cameo)\n\nDouglas (Brazilian Portuguese dub only; not seen)\n\nGeorge (dropped)\n\nCharacters Introduced\n\nLady\n\nDiesel 10\n\nSplatter and Dodge\n\nMr. Conductor\n\nJunior\n\nLily\n\nLily's Mother\n\nStacy Jones\n\nBurnett Stone\n\nBilly Twofeathers\n\nPatch\n\nThe Tumbleweed\n\nTasha Stone (voiceover as a child; portrait cameo)\n\nP.T.

At the same time, its live-action American spin-off Shining Time Station was also successful. As early as 1994, prior to the launch of the fourth series, Britt Allcroft had plans to make a feature film based on both of these shows and would make use of the model trains from Thomas and the live-action aesthetic of Shining Time Station.\n\nInitial plans between Allcroft and co-creator Rick Siggelkow would have been a straight-forward Shining Time Station film; the film would have had a circus train coming to the station, with Mr. Conductor (unintentionally caused by J.B. King's latest efforts to find him) being captured by the evil ringmaster. The Shining Time gang, alongside Thomas and the other engines (together for the first time in the series' history) would have gone after him. Scenarios discussed for the film included a circus girl becoming friends with the station kids and overcoming her fear of horses to become a stunt rider, The Jukebox Band would be lost and scattered after their titular home gets knocked over, J.B. finally meeting Mr. Conductor, and Schemer being shot from a cannon.\n\nPlans for the feature were ultimately put on hold when Siggelkow moved to head the new children's division for BBC Worldwide Americas in September 1995.\n\nIn February 1996, Allcroft was approached by Barry London, then vice-chairman of Paramount Pictures, with an idea for a Thomas film. Allcroft signed a contract to write the script for the film with the working title of Thomas and the Magic Railroad. According to a press release, filming was due to take place at Shepperton Studios in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the theatrical release set for 1997. The same month, Wilbert Awdry gave his blessing for the film. He claimed;\n\n“ If the film follows the stories as written in the books, all well and good. If they're treated in the same way as the videos, that is unwelcome. As far as I'm concerned, they're a washout. ”\n\nHowever, Paramount shelved the plans for the film after London left the company. This led Allcroft to seek other sources of funding. Discussions about the film were held with PolyGram, which did not go on any further as the company was in the middle of a corporate restructuring and sale.\n\nDuring all of this, her company would form Gullane Pictures, an American distribution arm, in 1997. With a minimum of $50 million of backing from the company, the primary mission of Gullane was \"to develop, produce and distribute films and TV programming for the U.S. marketplace\". Initial projects were distributing Thomas, Shining Time, and fellow Allcroft production The Magic Adventures of Mumfie (through both pre-existing American contracts and the then-new Fox Family Channel), and producing an adult drama film Row Your Boat.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, during the launch of the fifth series in the UK, Allcroft saw an Isle of Man Commission advert offering tax incentives to companies who wanted to film on the Island. Allcroft visited the Island a few weeks later and decided the location was perfect for the film. In 1999, Barry London became Chairman of the newly-founded Destination Films and renewed his interest in the project, leading to Destination Films becoming the main financial backer and studio for the film in February (with Gullane co-producing and handling distribution outside the US, UK, and Ireland). Destination was initially scheduled to distribute the film in the UK, but the also-newly formed Icon Film Distribution would purchase the rights that June.\n\nFilming\n\nMain Article: Thomas and the Magic Railroad (test footage)\n\nAfter Britt Allcroft had proposed the idea of a full-length theatrical film, the crew were worried that the gauge 1 models would not be up to cinematic condition and the models imperfections, perfectly fine on television screens, would look problematic on the big screen. Because of this, the film crew had the idea of filming the fifth series and every previous series with larger gauge 3.5 models.\n\nModels of Thomas and Percy were built by David Eves during 1996. The models were made from brass unlike the previously plastic models of the show. The model of Thomas would later be used in some music videos produced during the fifth series. A model of the station Cronk was built, a station previously never seen before in the show.\n\nThree test sequences were created. The first sequence was simply called Test Sequence. In this sequence, Thomas crosses a wooden bridge over a stream and looks in his reflection. Thomas reaches a station and stops there. Then Thomas' driver steps down from his cab and leaves.\n\nThe next test sequence, titled Little Man, starts with Thomas running through the countryside. Percy passes him. After looking at his reflection in the water, Thomas meets Percy at a station where Mr. Conductor (at his normal small size), who was running Thomas, leaves the station and so does Thomas.\n\nBig Man is the same as Little Man, except with Mr. Conductor at human size. Mr. Conductor was green-screened in both tests.\n\nThe crew was left with footage that had a runtime less than a standard episode. It was ultimately decided that it would be too costly to rebuild an entire new fleet of engines. The crew returned back to the Gauge 1 models for the fifth series of the show and Thomas and the Magic Railroad.\n\nThe 3.5\" Thomas and Percy would later be repurposed as designated models for Jack and the Sodor Construction Company and close-up shots of the engines between the fifth to twelfth series of Thomas & Friends.\n\nFilm\n\nPrincipal photography began on 2 August 1999 and wrapped on 15 October 1999. Filming took place at the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, United States, as well as in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and on the Isle of Man. The Castletown railway station on the Isle of Man Railway formed part of Shining Time Station and the goods shed at Port St. Mary railway station became Burnett Stone's workshop. The large passenger station where Lily boards the train is the Harrisburg Transportation Center. Strasburg Rail Road's (ex Norfolk & Western) 4-8-0 475 was repainted as the Rainbow Sun.\n\nDuring production, Thomas and Percy had replica brass models made. This was because their original plastic models were starting to show their age and had been repaired and repainted so many times that the crew were afraid some of these imperfections would be seen on the big screen and the models needed to be in top condition for intense filming. The new models were made out of brass and painted in matte finishes. They were equipped with CNC machined brass chassis powered by DC motors and the bufferbeam details were built from scratch. The plastic models also were repainted in a matte finish and had their original Marklin chassis replaced with new CNC brass made chassis.\n\nSodor was realized using models and chroma key. The models were animated using live-action remote control, as on the television series. The model sequences were shot in Toronto instead of Shepperton Studios, the \"home\" of the original show; however, several of the show's key staff were flown over to participate. When the filming sets from the TV series were sent from Shepperton to Toronto, Many of the set pieces and buildings were damaged beyond repair from shipping and had to be recreated from scratch. During the first week of filming, Tidmouth Sheds became warped due to the set reaching 113°F forcing the crew to rebuild it. The Magic Railroad was created using models, CGI and water-coloured matte paintings. Throughout Post-Production, the visual effects were provided by six studios: C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, Gajdecki Visual Effects, Howard Granite Films, LairdFX, Mad Dog Digital and Toybox.\n\nProblems and Changes\n\nIn a 2007 Sodor Island Fansite interview, Britt Allcroft commented that the finished film was drastically different from the version she had written, with several scenes, plot elements and characters being cut from the final film.[6]\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the film was the removal of P.T. Boomer, the film's original main antagonist. He was cut after test audiences found him to be too frightening for children. Despite his excision, Boomer still appears in a few unedited moments of the final film and even appears in one of the trailers, which shows him and Diesel 10 falling off the viaduct. The official Thomas and the Magic Railroad website also had images and information regarding his character prior to being cut. Parts of his character, such as his goal to find Lady, were rewritten for Diesel 10.\n\nSeveral character voices were also changed during production. Thomas was originally voiced by John Bellis, a fireman and part-time taxi driver who worked on the film as the Isle of Man transportation coordinator and facilities manager. Bellis received the role after he happened to pick up Allcroft and her crew from the airport; Allcroft believed his voice suited Thomas perfectly and so he was flown to Toronto to record his lines. Test audiences in Los Angeles disliked Bellis' voice for Thomas, believing his Liverpudlian accent made Thomas sound \"too old.\" Bellis was replaced by Eddie Glen, who gave Thomas a more youthful voice. James and Percy were originally going to be voiced by Michael Angelis, then-narrator of the television show. Test audiences also considered his voice to be too old for the characters and so he was replaced by Susan Roman and Linda Ballantyne who gave the two a more youthful but ladyish accent. Patrick Breen originally voiced Splatter and Dodge but he was also replaced for unknown reasons, to be replaced by Neil Crone and Kevin Frank.\n\nDiesel 10 was originally voiced by Keith Scott but his voice was later changed; Scott believes that he was replaced due to his voice sounding too scary to younger children. He was replaced by Neil Crone, who gave Diesel 10 a Russian accent. Due to complaints by test audiences, who believed the voice could be considered offensive, Crone gave Diesel 10 a stylised New Jersey accent. He and Kevin Frank both improvised a lot of comedy in the film.\n\nIn a 35mm teaser trailer, Diesel 10 says (to Thomas), \"Things are gonna change around here, puffball\", while speaking in an Australian accent.[7] The trailer was narrated by Jim Cummings and was released in 1999, and is the only known time Scott (an Australian himself) uses an Australian accent for Diesel 10.[8]\n\nDuring filming of the confrontation scene at the smelters yard, James' model fell off the set and was significantly damaged. Even after repairs were completed, cracks could still be seen in his cab and other areas, even during the final cut.\n\nDeleted Scenes and Original Script\n\nAll of these changes were featured in the original script of the film. They were cut out in either later scripts or the final release:\n\nOriginally, Sir Topham Hatt was to be casted in a live-action appearance but this was eventually dropped because no actor \"of the right size\" could be found.\n\nThe Island Song and Thomas' Anthem were going to be used in the film during the opening musical sequence. Additionally, Night Train was originally going to be used in the scene of Thomas and Percy pulling their mail trains.\n\nThe special takes place in 1999, hinted by Lily's age being the same as Mara Wilson's.\n\nLily was the narrator, telling the story to her children twenty years later. In the future, she became a railroad engineer like Burnett and married Patch. She also had a pet dog named Jeff, who was a descendant of Mutt.\n\nLily's mother was pregnant, which is why Lily goes to visit her grandfather.\n\nCranky was meant to have a nonspeaking role. In the scene where Splatter and Dodge ask Diesel 10 why he let Mr. Conductor escape, Cranky would have dropped a crate of fruits and vegetables on them. There was a second idea which had him drop oil on Diesel 10. In the final film, Diesel 10 is covered in coal from a hopper. Cranky's model still appears in the film, albeit as set dressing at Knapford.\n\nOriginally, Percy and Toby were going to be introduced hauling scrap from the scrapyard. Percy speaks about how he is glad to be out of the scrapyard as he finds it scary. He also tells Toby about Sir Topham Hatt going on holiday. Toby assures him everything will be alright. Splatter and Dodge are revealed to be listening in and leave to tell the boss, Diesel 10.\n\nGeorge was going to make an appearance as one of Diesel 10's lackeys. He agreed to help Diesel 10 destroy all the buffers on Sodor to find the ones that led to the Magic Railroad and as a reward he would be allowed to destroy the turntable at Tidmouth Sheds and turn it into a roller rink, though at some point he eventually turned against Diesel 10. As his model was never taken out of storage, his role was dropped in later scripts.\n\nDiesel 10 was a new engine who came to help while Sir Topham Hatt was away, instead creating problems on the railway.\n\nPinchy would have been concealed underneath Diesel 10's roof and not been revealed until Diesel 10's first meeting with Splatter and Dodge.\n\nDiesel 10's claw originally was not named. When Neil Crone was improvising dialogue in the recording studio, he came up with Pinchy. The team loved it, so it stayed.\n\nBurnett Stone was given the task of being Lady's caretaker by a previous Mr. Conductor.\n\nThe railway was undergoing major repairs throughout the film, which would explain why Tidmouth Sheds was under repair in the final cut.\n\nIn the original script, Thomas meeting Gordon and Diesel 10's arrival was to take place at Knapford Station. Also, Thomas was to shunt Gordon's coaches and after Gordon gets shocked by Diesel 10 rushing past him, he was to jerk forward and leave his coaches and he went back to get them.\n\nMr. Conductor would have remained in his original size of ten inches on the Island of Sodor in certain scenes. The items in Sir Topham Hatt's office are described as being as large as him.\n\nMr. Conductor would have slept in a small hammock in Tidmouth Sheds instead of a bed.\n\nWhen scratching James' itch, he was supposed brush James with a tree branch instead of a push brush.\n\nThe scene where Thomas was meant to be covered in dust by Harold was intended to carry on through the night at Tidmouth Sheds, with Diesel 10 dumping sneezing powder down Thomas' funnel.\n\nThe scene of Mr. Conductor talking to the baseball bat and plastic ball originally did not exist.\n\nThere is an unused brief few scenes where Thomas would temporarily have his whistle broken.\n\nAnother thing to note about the powder scene was that it originally took place at the quarry instead of Tidmouth.\n\nMr. Conductor would originally sparkle himself to the mountain and find himself at the wrong part of it, he would lost his sparkle at the bottom of the mountain instead of the top of it, he would then be forced to climb the mountain.\n\nThe windmill was not the location of the clue to the source of the gold dust. Instead, it was a large waterfall that Mr. Conductor had to climb up to retrieve a sheet of paper, it was then revised to a waterfall with a light shining into a barrel, a wagon and a rainbow reflecting onto a rock-face, Mr. Conductor would have to step onto the wagon to inspect the writing before it would disappear.\n\nLady originally did not speak. Her only ways of communicating would be through telepathy with Thomas on Muffle Mountain and her whistle. She was later given a speaking role in order to smooth over cuts to the final film.\n\nIn the original script, the differences between British and American terminology were acknowledged and occasionally poked fun at. The engines would continue to refer to Sir Topham Hatt as \"The Fat Controller\" and also corrected Mr. Conductor when he mistakenly said \"Sodor Railroad\" instead of \"Railway.\"\n\nThere was an extended scene where Toby would hide next to Diesel 10 when he eavesdrops on Thomas and Percy.\n\nJunior was originally described as being an English character. His nationality was changed after Michael E. Rodgers was cast for the role.\n\nPatch was originally intended to be Irish.\n\nMr. Conductor escapes Diesel 10's claw by cutting a blue/green wire instead of the hydraulic hose he cuts in the final film. His original predicament would include him having to figure which wire to cut, one opening the claw and the other tightening it which could crush him, as opposed to the pliers falling out of his hands having to reach them under 10 seconds. Instead of being catapulted to the windmill by Diesel 10's claw, Mr. Conductor would have been dropped, caught onto Diesel 10’s wheel, lost grip and bounced off a bush before landing at the windmill.\n\nThere was an extra scene where Henry would return feeling a lot better and would thank Thomas for helping him.\n\nWhen Toby distracts Diesel 10, he was supposed to use his whistle instead of his bell. In addition, the three diesels would get covered in scrap instead of being blocked by the roof.\n\nThe scene where Thomas speaks to Percy about the missing coal truck was meant to take place after Diesel 10 explaining his next plan instead of before.\n\nSplatter and Dodge were not meant to reform; instead, George would have been the one who turned against them, telling them to destroy the magic buffers themselves. They try to do so but bump into each-other and derail. In another script, George would have helped Junior and James defeat the two diesels by pushing a boulder onto their line, trapping them on a siding.\n\nIn the original script, Thomas does not stop to pick up the missing coal truck despite recognizing it and only realises its significance after he reaches Muffle Mountain. Lily makes the same connection and Patch and his horse are sent to retrieve the truck. The horse's hooves are permanently etched with gold dust, allowing it to go down the Magic Railroad.\n\nThere an extended scene where Junior would taunt Diesel 10 and pretend to go surfing, serving to annoy him, to which the engine would try to throw Junior off by speeding.\n\nIn the original script, the chase scene with Thomas, Diesel 10 and Lady was originally going to have Lily with Burnett. However, this was cut.\n\nIn the original script when Lily notices the coal truck, she would fallen off of Thomas' cab, to which Thomas would go back for her.\n\nIn the original script, Thomas is knocked off of Muffle Mountain by an explosion caused by P.T. Boomer. In the final release, the ground under him simply crumbles away.\n\nAfter Diesel 10 and P.T. Boomer fall into the barge, they would have either vanished or would have been turned into boiler sludge via Junior's magic bandanna, who arrived at the Big Dipper by Percy.\n\nJames and Percy were originally present in the ending at the wishing well but were later cut from the scene.\n\nThe ending would have seen Lily, now married to Patch, finishing the story with her children, who are on a picnic and looking through a scrapbook with pictures from Sodor. They can be seen walking together with their horse in the shot viewing Shining Time Station.\n\nRelease\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 14 July 2000 and the United States and Canada on 26 July 2000. The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square; for the purpose, a steam locomotive, LMS Fowler 3F no. 47298 (painted to resemble Thomas) was brought to the cinema by low-loader on 9 July 2000. National press coverage was low, as many journalists were concentrating on the launch of the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book, for which a special train called \"Hogwarts Express\" would run on 8 - 11 July. In September 2020, it was announced that the film would be re-released in theaters for one day only on October 24, 2020 for the film's 20th anniversary.\n\nHome Media\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad was released onto VHS and DVD on 19 October 2000 in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Icon Home Entertainment and in the United States on 31 October 2000 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. In 2007, it was re-released on DVD as a Double Feature with The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. In 2009, it was re-released as part of a 3-DVD Boxset entitled Family Favorites Movie Collection which also features The Adventures of Milo and Otis and The Bear.\n\nShout! Factory had planned to release the movie on Blu-ray and DVD to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary on 9 June 2020,[9][10]but the date had been pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 15 July 2020, a day after the original release for the movie in the UK and Ireland, Britt Allcroft announced on her Facebook page the official press release for the 20th Anniversary Blu-ray.[11] The combo pack was released on 29 September 2020. The release featured new interviews with the cast and crew (including Mara Wilson and Alec Baldwin), \"The Making of Thomas and the Magic Railroad\" featurette previously only available on the German DVD release and for the first time, the entire original deleted storyline featuring P.T. Boomer and narration by Lily (extracted from the film's workprint and missing final effects and ADR voiceover).\n\nReception\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad was negatively received by critics, sporting an approval rating of 21% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 68 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus says \"kids these days demand cutting edge special effects or at least a clever plot with cute characters. This movie has neither, having lost in its Americanization what the British original did so right.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 19 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike.\"\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film one star out of four and wrote \"(the fact) That Thomas and the Magic Railroad made it into theaters at all is something of a mystery. This is a production with 'straight to video' written all over it. Kids who like the Thomas books might kinda like it. Especially younger kids. Real younger kids. Otherwise, no.\" While he admired the models and art direction, he criticised how the engines' mouths did not move when they spoke, the overly depressed performance of Peter Fonda, as well as the overall lack of consistency in the plot. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film a 3/5 rating, saying, \"Mr. Baldwin's attack -- there's no better way to put it -- is unforgettable.\" However, he had a positive, saying, It's very slow, though it does offer a respite from the overactive animation that kids are mostly subjected to. Kaleem Aftab of The List, stated, \"For those under-tens, Thomas and the Magic Railroad will be a great way to spend a school holiday afternoon.\"\n\nWilliam Thomas of Empire gave the film a one out of five stars, he was critical of the films special effects, stating, \"But, believe it or not, the true villains of the piece are, in fact, the 'special' effects. Quite how – in today's era of slo-mo and seamless digital wizardry – such a shoddy result can have been achieved is anyone's guess. With clunky bluescreen, spot-a-mile-off matte work and an absolute lack of synergy between real-life and animated action, it all conspires to provide an appropriately amateur sheen.\" Plugged In stated, \"While the animation maintains its simple appearance, the plot is anything but simple. And that's not good news for the many tots who make up the majority of Thomas' audience. Switching back and forth between Shining Time and Sodor, interweaving two relatively complex story lines, may confuse more than it challenges. Parents may well find that their children are squirming in their seats long before Thomas rides his magic rails into the sunset. That said and the magic notwithstanding, tikes who do manage to grasp the complex story lines and can sit still for an hour and a half, will learn good lessons about friendship, courage, hard work and being kind.\" Neil Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film three out of five stars and writing that it \"will please [Thomas fans]\" but that the plot \"might confuse kids.\"\n\nThe film was also a partial box office flop, grossing $19.7 million compared to its $19 million budget. During its second week of screening in Britain, it only took in £170,000 (roughly $215,000 in the United States).\n\nCancelled Sequel\n\nBefore the film was released, a sequel was originally already being developed by Destination Films. However, due to the negative reception and poor box office bomb performance, the sequel was cancelled.[12]\n\nSome consider Calling All Engines! to be a sequel, although it is not strictly a sequel. The Adventures of Thomas was planned to follow the film, but was scrapped when HiT Entertainment shut down and was replaced with the upcoming Untitled Thomas & Friends Movie.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nNomination - YoungStar Awards - Best Young Actress/Performance in a Motion Picture Comedy, 2000, to Mara Wilson\n\nNomination - Young Artists Awards - Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actress, 2001, to Mara Wilson\n\nTrivia\n\nA working title for the film was Thomas and the Rainbow Railway.\n\nDespite P.T Boomer being cut from the final film, he can be easily seen in the original trailer for the film where he falls down the Big Dipper with Diesel 10.[13] He also makes an appearance in the Australian trailer, a rod is connected to Thomas' coupling hook and Thomas and Diesel 10 also have their original voices at certain points. This was likely because there was either no time to redo these scenes in the trailer or they were otherwise mistakes.\n\nIn the original trailer for the film, there are two scenes were Diesel 10 incorrectly speaks in a different voice with only one scene having his final. When he first appears uttering ''Out of the way!'' when speeding past Gordon and Thomas, he speaks in a (possibly) Russian accent which may be part of his original Russian accent audio done by Keith Scott in an the early version of the film.\n\nThe results of the film not only heightened the franchise's presence in the United States but also promoted Gullane to consider producing spin-off shows surrounding Bertie and Harold in 2001. However, both plans were immediately scrapped in favour of another planned spin-off, Jack and the Sodor Construction Company, in 2003.\n\nThe script was finished being written on 19 May 1999.\n\nA 1996 newspaper claimed that George Carlin would be reprising his role as Mr. Conductor but due to Carlin having left the show after Shining Time Station ended that same year, Alec Baldwin recasted the role as Mr. Conductor for the former.[14]\n\nAccording to Britt Allcroft, the film was partially inspired by the fourth series episode Thomas and the Special Letter.[15]\n\nDifferent versions of the original script can be found online.\n\nAccording to David Axford, David Mitton had desired to incorporate characters from the Tugs franchise into the film as a tie-in through a scene where Thomas encountered them on a seaside run by. It would have been likely the models would have been modified for the film.[16] Many of their models were shipped over from the United Kingdom but none were ultimately used in the film, due to a clash between Britt and David.[17] Many of the models were damaged or destroyed during their transportation back to the United Kingdom. The only possible mention of this scene in any versions of the original script is a scene where Thomas pulls The Mail Train past the sea before arriving at Knapford.\n\nJohn Barry originally signed on to be the film's composer but left the project due to scheduling conflicts. He is still credited as the composer on the 1999 US teaser poster.\n\nMutt the dog was portrayed by British golden-doodles, Bently and Dita. When in action, trainers stood off camera and gave verbal cues to get the dogs to sit, lay down, stand and stay. When Mutt is shown running through the crowded train station, one trainer doubled as an actor while the other stood off camera and held up a treat that Dita ran towards. The trainers put Mutt into the train so he sat and rode with the actors. In several scenes we see close up shots of Mutt’s face reacting to something. These were all taken in one day, with a trainer holding up Bentley’s favorite toy.\n\nIn the second half of both the UK and US trailers feature the instrumentals of the 1997 song, The World Is New by American band, Save Ferris.\n\nThis film marks the first occurrence of many things:\n\nThe first film based on Thomas & Friends.\n\nThe first film distributed by ABC Films.\n\nThe first Thomas & Friends production to feature separate voice actors for the characters in the English dub and the first to use this format worldwide. This is the only time CGI animation was used until Thomas and the Billboard. Also, these techniques would not be done fully again until nine years later, with 2009's Hero of the Rails, the first full CGI Thomas & Friends production (excluding a 1990's German Ad for Thomas Wooden Railway), all the way to the twenty-fourth series.\n\nThe first appearance of Thomas' shocked face without the bucktooth since the second series episode The Runaway, which continued to appear until the twelfth series.\n\nThe first time an engine says \"Shut up!\" since the second series episode Edward's Exploit. Diesel 10 says this to Pinchy in annoyance as he backs away from Tidmouth Sheds after harassing the steam engines. This is a rare occurrence since Thomas & Friends was meant to have gentler language most often as of the 1990s and later on in the 2000s, 2010s and the 2020s.\n\nThe first production without the narrow gauge engines since their debut in the fourth series.\n\nThe first in the series to have a railway/railroad crossing sound effect.\n\nThe first appearance of the watermill since the third series episode Thomas, Percy and the Post Train.\n\nThe first appearance of James' smug face re-casted as his sleeping face.\n\nThis film marks the only occurrence of a few things:\n\nThe only Thomas & Friends film to feature live actors.\n\nThe only film based on Shining Time Station.\n\nThe only production to have a first-person narrative until the twenty-second series episode Number One Engine.\n\nThe only appearances of Lady and Diesel 10 until Calling All Engines!.\n\nThe only special without the narrow gauge engines until Hero of the Rails.\n\nThe only appearances of Splatter and Dodge. They were originally going to be included in the CGI specials, Day of the Diesels and The Great Race but were replaced by Paxton and Sidney and the Mainland Diesels respectively possibly due to budgetary issues.\n\nThe only time Neil Crone voices Gordon and the only special to have him and Eddie Glen as part of the voice cast until Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go.\n\nThe only time where Diesel 10's shocked and worried facial expressions are used on screen.\n\nThe only fully worldwide theatrical Thomas film release to get released until the upcoming Marc Forster Film. A second one before the film named The Adventures of Thomas was in development by HiT Entertainment sometime around 2010 but was cancelled after Mattel acquired the company and years of repeated postponement. Many of the specials also received brief theatrical runs.\n\nThe only appearance of Killaban in the series.\n\nThe only special in which Edward does not appear until the All Engines Go special, Race for the Sodor Cup.\n\nThe only time the Fat Controller does not physically appear on screen, although he is seen via portrait cameo and his heard on the phone unintelligibly, except for foreign dubs.\n\nThe only time until the seventeenth series episode Bill or Ben?, where all the engines aside from Thomas, Percy and Toby have headlamps, albeit only used on the night scenes.\n\nToby's only speaking role in a special until The Great Discovery.\n\nThe only appearances of Burnett Stone, Lily, Junior and Patch.\n\nThe only time in the franchise Alec Baldwin played Mr. Conductor.\n\nThe only time in the franchise Russell Means played Billy Twofeathers.\n\nThe only appearances of The Big Dipper and Shining Time (town).\n\nThis film marks the last occurrence of a few things:\n\nThe last Thomas and Friends production ever produced in the 20th century (1901-2000). All other Thomas media content would be released in the 21st century starting in 2001.\n\nThe last production where Thomas' original wincing face mask is used. A new one would be gained for the seventh series until The Great Discovery.\n\nMara Wilson's last major film role before her ten year retirement from acting. She returned to the acting profession around 2016.\n\nThe last time in the franchise where a character says \"stupid\" and \"Shut up!,\" likely to reduce more crass language on the show.\n\nThe last VHS/DVD to be released by DVD Acadamy in South Korea.\n\nThe last appearance of Mr. Conductor, Stacy Jones and Billy Twofeathers.\n\nThe last appearance of Shining Time Station.\n\nThis special was never shown and dubbed overseas in Spain, Romania, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Serbia, Czechia, Poland or Indonesia.\n\nThis is the longest Thomas & Friends production ever made, running at 85 minutes (1 hour and 25 minutes) in the final cut.\n\nPhil Fehrle and Shelley-Elizabeth Skinner made cameos in the film.\n\nDidi Conn is the only actress from Shining Time Station to reprise her role in the film.\n\nEdward was never featured in any script of the film. According to an interview with Phil Fehrle, there was not enough screen time or opportunity to utilise him in a way that added any real value to the film.\n\nTwinkle Toes, the nickname that Diesel 10 uses to call Mr. Conductor and Junior, would be used by him once again with Sidney in the seventeenth series episode The Missing Christmas Decorations.\n\nJohn Bellis, the original voice of Thomas, is credited as \"transportation coordinator.\"\n\nPeople that worked on the original series also worked on this film. Namely, David Mitton (as model unit creative consultant), David Eves (as model SFX supervisor), Stephen Asquith (as model supervisor) and Terence Permane (as director of photography for the models section).\n\nIn the trailers, Mr. Conductor is heard saying \"I've run out of gold dust and because of that, I'm losing my energy as well,\" a line originally from the uncut version. Similarly, Diesel 10 is also heard saying \"I'll get you, you blue puffball!\" which was also originally from the uncut version.\n\nThe English and a couple foreign theatrical trailers played \"The World is New\" by Save Ferris, with music done by Nick Phoenix. The same was done with the Japanese theatrical trailer but it replaced some of the original music with bits of the original Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends theme.\n\nThe Australian VHS release has both the Destination Films and Gullane Pictures logos plastered with the ABC Films logo. However, the Australian DVD release has all three logos presented in alphabetical order before the start of the film.\n\nIn a deleted scene, the newspapers that P.T. Boomer searches through to find Burnett Stone's address are dated 22 July 1999. This means that the events of this film took place between 22 and 25 July 1999.\n\nAll of the engines and road vehicles have different whistle and horn sounds:\n\nThomas still uses the same whistle sound albeit slightly modified.\n\nSome of the engines share the same whistle sound (which is Thomas' whistle in the special but at different pitches); Gordon and James both use the same whistle, as do Henry and Percy.\n\nToby's bell sound changes for the second time since the second series but this time, another bell sound sounds slightly different.\n\nBertie's horn is the same one as the other one used in the first to third series but in a higher pitch.\n\nIn the first teaser for the film, Thomas has his regular whistle sound, albeit pitched down a few tones.\n\nThe line that splits that Percy goes down with the mail train has some similarities to the one Oliver went down in Oliver's Find.\n\nAccording to multiple SiF interviews, several of the models were either damaged or lost in transit after being shipped from Toronto to Shepperton. This likely included models such as Big Mickey and The Fultan Ferry which went unused in the film but were still shipped over for the potential of being used on set.\n\nIt has been debated whether the film is canon to the Thomas & Friends television series.\n\nThe events of the film are never referenced again in the rest of the television series, despite Diesel 10 making multiple appearances and Thomas saying \"Little engine can do big things\" in Thomas and the Royal Engine.\n\nChris Lloyd has stated in his interview with Sodor Island Fansite that Lady does not exist in the television continuity.[18]\n\nLocations from the film have been featured on Sam Wilkinson's 2014 map of Sodor.\n\nAccording the official Unlikely Fandom Twitter account, a documentary about Thomas the Tank Engine fans that interviewed Britt Allcroft, she considers the film canon.[19]\n\nThe film was shot in a 4:3 fullscreen frame and later matted into either a 1.85:1 widescreen image for theatrical release or a 1.14:1 open matte image for 35mm open matte film scan prints; the UK and Irish DVD as well as the film on Sprout and Starz airings was rendered in full frame as a letterboxed widescreen image.\n\nFor the 16:9 widescreen release, the top and bottom of the film are cropped to fit the widescreen frame. Notably, several scenes were filmed in 16:9 widescreen, such as:\n\nThe scene of Thomas at the campfire when Mr. Conductor explains how he was keeping Lady entertained.\n\nThe second scene of Thomas and Percy at the campfire when Percy explains how they must get Lily back to Burnett Stone.\n\nThe scene of Burnett Stone saying \"Well done, Thomas! Well done,\" before blowing Lady's whistle after Thomas crossed the viaduct that was about to collapse.\n\nThe Digital HD Copy and 20th Anniversary Shout! Factory Blu-Ray release are the only official ways to own the film in 16:9 widescreen in North America.\n\nThe posters of Sir Topham Hatt reading \"Sir Topham Needs You\" featured throughout the film are a reference to the Lord Kitchener and Uncle Sam recruiting posters.\n\nDespite Sir Topham Hatt's voice being unintelligible over the phone, it is still changed in the foreign language dubs.\n\nAlthough live human actors are used for the film, Lady Hatt and Bertie's driver still appear as model humans, in a picture frame for the former and physically for the latter.\n\nAside from Bertie's driver, Sodor appears to be entirely devoid of people, including the engines' crews, guards and workmen, thus making the engines self-driven. Despite this, the passengers' shadows can be seen in some of the windows of the coaches.\n\nAside the engines' drivers, Burnett Stone is able to drive and operate Lady.\n\nThis would later happen again in Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go! (But this time, it also has rolling stock moving on their own).\n\nThe town beside Knapford is replaced with trees, however, many cottages and houses are seen elsewhere at Knapford and at the windmill.\n\nScrap models of Thomas, Gordon, City of Truro, Toad and one of the Scottish twins appear in the smelters yard scenes.\n\nThe Hollywoodedge, Air Brake Hiss Truck PE079201 sound effect is heard when Diesel 10 stops.\n\nOne of Flying Scotsman's tenders, painted black, can be seen as Thomas backs into the siding next to James.\n\nThree props from TUGS can be seen in the film. The repainted coal hopper, the white industrial tank from the episode Trapped and a tower from Ballantine's.\n\nIn a deleted scene of Splatter and Dodge at the Smelter's Yard, they are both wearing their different masks that did not appear in the final film.\n\nIn the Railway Adventures PC game and the twenty-fourth series double-length episode Thomas and the Royal Engine, Thomas says \"Little engines can do big things\" which is a reference to the film's tag line.\n\nThe scene where Mr. Conductor is in Sir Topham Hatt's office, pictures of the engines from past series episode such as No Joke for James, Tender Engines, A Surprise for Percy and Thomas, Percy and Old Slow Coach, are seen.\n\nThis film aired in the UK twice on BBC One - once on 1 January 2004 and again on 29 December 2008.\n\nThe film aired in the US on PBS Kids Sprout on 3 July and 11 July 2015 and in Canada on Family Jr. in 2017 where, like with the UK and Irish DVDs, it was fitted as a widescreen image.\n\nThis is also the only model production to air on the Family Jr channel.\n\nWhen the film aired on the Playhouse Disney channel in Australia on July 2007, the scene with Junior surfing on Diesel 10 was cut after he says, \"Oh, no, my beach bag!\", likely due to safety concerns in that country.\n\nThis film, Big World! Big Adventures!, Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure, Tale of the Brave and King of the Railway are the only known specials to have been dubbed in Hebrew.\n\nThe Korean VHS/DVD does not contain any of the UK or US company logos; instead, it only had DVD Acadamy's logo.\n\nThe Korean VHS plays the English dub with Korean subtitles.\n\nIn the Greek dub, all of the songs are cut for unknown reasons.\n\nThe Japanese dub kept Leo Morimoto as narrator, as he is in the television series, instead of Mr. Conductor.\n\nThe Russian version is a voice-over production that plays the Hebrew dub in the background as a dubbing track was not used.\n\nThe Azerbaijani and Korean versions are the voice-over productions that plays the English dub in the background as a dubbing track was not used.\n\nThe Dutch, Slovenian, Azerbaijani and Korean versions were never got dubbed the songs in their respective languages but they added subtitles for the lyrics.\n\nIn the Brazilian Portuguese dub of this film, there is a brief greeting exchanged between Thomas and Douglas during the first scene of Knapford station. This is despite Douglas making no appearances outside of this in the film and not being featured on-screen.\n\nIn the Brazilian Portuguese dub of this film, the instrumental version of Really Useful Engine plays during the end credits.\n\nThe film's original US VHS release came with coupons for Amtrak tickets.\n\nFlags of the Isle of Man, Germany, Scotland, Ireland and Europe can be seen above one of the shops at Shining Time.\n\nThe film's UK VHS release has the Milkyway Magic Stars Advert parts one and two.\n\nGoofs\n\nExcluding cab shots, Thomas and Percy's cab doors are missing throughout the entirety of the film.\n\nWhen Thomas reads the sign, his eyes move from left to right, meaning he is reading the sign backwards.\n\nWhen James says to Thomas that he is feeling blue, he has his angry face.\n\nWhen Diesel 10 zooms past Thomas and Gordon, Thomas shifts a bit, his eyes are misaligned and a small piece of hair flies on his face. Also, in the close up of Diesel 10, a black pencil is seen on the right side.\n\nWhen Thomas says \"If Diesel has unfinished business...\", his siderods stop moving.\n\nWhen Diesel 10 and Thomas leave the sheds, the edge of the set can be seen.\n\nA car disappears and reappears at the shed beside Diesel 10 when he is conversing with Thomas and James.\n\nWhen Pinchy hits Diesel 10 in the face, the support mechanism is gone, in order for Pinchy to reach Diesel 10's face.\n\nDuring the engines' conversation about Lady at Tidmouth Sheds, the bottom of Percy's smokebox saddle was white in one shot and his smokebox saddle is black. Then they both turn green for the rest of that scene and during Diesel 10's invasion at the sheds during the evening. For the rest of the film, the smokebox saddle is black but it becomes green again when Percy tells Thomas that they need to get Lily back to Burnett. That was due to the plastic and brass models both being used together in the film.\n\nWhen Diesel 10 asks \"Where's that lost engine?\" Gordon's face is coming loose.\n\nAfter Diesel 10 leaves the sheds, the engines are clean but moments later, they are all covered in dust.\n\nIn the close up of Percy in the shed his eyes are misaligned and James' tender is crooked.\n\nAt one point, when Mr. Conductor talks to James, his voice slightly echoes as if he is inside the sheds, even though he is not.\n\nWhen Thomas bumps the sixth and last truck full of coal into the magic buffers, the fifth one derails.\n\nWhen Thomas and Percy are talking at the water tower, when the camera focuses on Percy, Thomas's vacuum pipe is crooked. But when the camera focuses on Thomas, his vacuum pipe is suddenly fixed.\n\nFor most of the film, Clarabel is facing the wrong way and in a scene during \"Really Useful Engine,\" she is in front of Annie.\n\nAs Diesel 10 leaves after overhearing Thomas and Percy, a red wire can be seen in his cab.\n\nWhen the roof falls over Diesel 10, Splatter and Dodge, Diesel 10 tilts a bit.\n\nAfter Diesel 10 is covered in coal, Henry can be seen puffing backwards next to Gordon but in the next shot, he is near Splatter and Dodge.\n\nIn a close-up of Percy finding Splatter and Dodge at the magic buffers, his lamp mysteriously moves.\n\nAfter Lily tells Thomas he is \"a really useful engine,\" the coal truck he has disappears. Later in the next scene, it reappears.\n\nWhen Junior is flung into the air, the scene shifts to the right. This goof occurs in the full screen version only.\n\nJames' whistle disappears in the scene of Junior falling on his cab roof but reappears later when he and Junior are teleported to the grotto.\n\nWhen the chase begins, Diesel 10 clips a bush too close to the track.\n\nAfter saying \"Now I'll get you, Burnett Stone!\", Burnett replies: \"No, you won't, because the magic you refused to believe in, will get the better of you.\" However, Diesel 10 did believe in the magic as that was the whole reason as to why he wanted to destroy Lady. This is because the line was originally intended to be directed at P.T. Boomer but when he was cut from the film, the line was edited to omit any mention of him.\n\nDespite his role being cut, P.T. Boomer still makes a few appearances in the final film. He appears riding on top of Diesel 10's roof in the chase scene in some shots, probably because there was no time to redo these shots without him, and he makes an appearance in the \"crossroads\" scene in which Stacy brings Lily to Burnett Stone. Doug Lennox confirmed that the original scene would have seen Boomer confront Burnett about Lady's whereabouts and was re-dubbed by supervising sound editor Nelson Ferreira when his role was cut out.[6]\n\nIn the chase scene, Diesel 10 is on a different track but later right before he falls off the viaduct, he is on the same track as Thomas and Lady. However, he could have switched tracks at a junction off-screen.\n\nIn the chase, when Diesel 10 says \"Coming, puffball!\" Thomas and Lady are smiling.\n\nAs Thomas crosses the viaduct gap, a rope can be seen pulling him.\n\nWhen Lady and Thomas round the bend to the viaduct their is not much distance between the bend and the viaduct but during the close shots their appears to be a lot of track between the bend and the viaduct.\n\nWhen Diesel 10 is hanging on to the viaduct, he is vertical but when he falls, he is horizontal.\n\nAlso as he's hanging, when he yells \"Puffball!\", he has his worried face but it suddenly goes to his evil smile face when he shouts \"Teapot!\".\n\nDuring the song Really Useful Engine, the captions read \"Now he's got a workshop\" instead of \"Now he's got a branch line.\" This also occurs during \" 'Cause the Fat Controller, he told him so,\" as the captions instead read \"Cause the Last Controller, he told him so.\"\n\nAfter the chase scene when Lily gives gold dust to Mr. Conductor and Junior, part of the green screen effect on Mr. Conductor's left elbow can be seen.\n\nSodor is misspelled as \"Sodar\" on the back cover in some early American VHS releases.\n\nFor some reason, on some digital prints of the film in the United States, the first eleven seconds of the Destination Films logo are cut off and the Samuel Goldwyn Films logo plays instead, despite them having no involvement in the film's production or distribution.\n\nIn the end credits, Bertie and Harold, who are non-rail vehicles, are under the voice cast for The Trains.\n\nSir Topham Hatt goes uncredited from Kevin Frank's listing of characters.\n\nIn one shot of the theatrical trailer, a rod can be seen pulling Thomas.\n\nThe US Spanish VHS back cover misspells the Island of Sodor as \"Sodar\".\n\nThe German DVD Character Gallery misspells Bertie's name as \"Berty\".\n\nThe Korean DVD back cover says 소더 (sodeo) instead of the Island of Sodor.\n\nIn the Korean voice-over, Gordon's line \"What does that sign say?\" was said by Thomas' voice actor.\n\nAlso, Percy's line \"You're very brave, Toby.\" is said by Toby's voice actor.\n\nWhen Thomas says \"He says, the harder we work the less he'll need diesels to help,\" and Diesel 10 appears, James does not say his line \"Uh, Thomas?\"\n\nOn the Apple TV cover, the first \"R\" in \"Railroad\" is missing from the title.\n\nIn Other Languages\n\nLanguage Title Azerbaijani Tomas və sehrli dəmir yolu Brazilian Portuguese Thomas e a ferrovia mágica\n\nThomas e a estrada mágica Cantonese 湯瑪士和神奇鐵路 Canadian French Thomas et la voie ferrée magique\n\nThomas et le chemin de fer magique Chinese Mandarin 托马斯和神奇铁路 Czech Tomáš a přátelé: Kouzelná železnice Dutch Thomas en de magische spoorbaan German Thomas: die fantastische Lokomotive Greek Ο μαγικός κόσμος του Τόμας Hebrew תומס ומסילת הקסמים Japanese きかんしゃトーマス 魔法の線路 Korean 토마스와 마법 기차 Latin American Spanish Thomas y la vía de tren mágica (VHS)\n\nThomas y el tren mágico (TV) Persian توماس و راه آهن جادویی Portuguese Thomas e o comboio mágico Russian Томас и волшебная железная дорога Slovenian Lokomotivček Tomaž in čarobna železnica Taiwanese Mandarin 湯瑪士和神奇鐵路\n\nDVD Packs\n\nUS/CAN\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad/The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland Double Feature\n\nFamily Favorites Movie Collection\n\nTrailers and Featurettes\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad on IMDB\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nWikipedia has an article related to:"
