        "text": "If you thought 30s British cinema was all upper-class twits in dinner jackets and awfully nice ladyships with impeccable cut-glass accents, think again (though there are plenty of those). Why not drop in on George Formby and tap-dancing moppet Binkie Stuart in Keep Your Seats, Please (1936)? Or if heartthrob Charles Boyer is more to your taste, you’ll find him on dashing form as a Japanese naval officer in The Battle (1934).\n\nFor contemporary British audiences these films represented an escape from economic depression and escalating political tension at home and across Europe. With no less than 60 hours of newly digitised material – and most of the 50 features currently unavailable on DVD – Welcome to the Dream Palace offers the perfect getaway from 21st-century stresses.\n\nTen to try\n\nLove on Wheels (1932)\n\nWonderful toe-tapping musical comedy starring Jack Hulbert.\n\nThe Private Life of Henry VIII (1933)\n\nCharles Laughton on Oscar-winning form as the much-married monarch.\n\nEvergreen (1934)\n\nJessie Matthews is at her best in this musical proving that 30s glamour wasn’t confined to Hollywood.\n\nWaltzes from Vienna (1934)\n\nA real Hitchcock rarity, and a Hitchcock musical, to boot.\n\nDandy Dick (1935)\n\nWill Hay – as a country vicar no less – finds himself accused of doping racehorses.\n\nThe Tunnel (1935)\n\nAmbitiously mounted sci-fi tale about the construction of a transatlantic tunnel.\n\nThe Man Who Changed His Mind (1936)\n\nBoris Karloff, in his first mad-scientist role, develops a machine that can exchange minds between bodies.\n\nThe Great Barrier (1937)\n\nWestern-style adventure on the Canadian Pacific Railway with a heroic Richard Arlen and luminous Lili Palmer.\n\nThe Challenge (1938)\n\nA British take on the German mountain film, recreating the 19th-century conquest of the Matterhorn.\n\nThe Dark Eyes of London (1939)\n\nBela Lugosi, a disfigured murderer and bodies in the Thames: a landmark British horror."
