        "text": "Finding out that your school has selected to study a Shakespeare play as your section A text can be a pretty daunting prospect. If Iâm honest, I wasnât all too thrilled upon discovering this either...it seemed as though I now not only had to worry about analysing my text, but also understanding what Shakespeare was saying through all of his old-fashioned words.Â\n\nHowever, letâs not fret - in this post, Iâll share with you some Measure for Measure specific advice and tactics, alongside excerpts of an essay of mine as a reference.Â\n\nBefore you start reading, How To Approach Shakespeare: A Guide To Studying Shakespeare is a must read for any student studying Shakespeare.\n\nHistorical ContextÂ\n\nHaving a basic understanding of the historical context of the play is an integral part of developing your understanding of Measure for Measure (and is explored further in Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare). For example, for prompts that open with âWhat does Shakespeare suggest aboutâ¦?â or âHow does Measure for Measure reflect Shakespeareâs ideas aboutâ¦?â it can be really helpful to understand Shakespeareâs own position in society and how that influenced his writing.Â\n\nThereâs no need to memorise certain parts of Shakespeareâs history - as that would serve no purpose - just try to gauge an understanding of what life was like in his time. Through understanding Shakespeareâs position in society, we are able to infer his stances on various characters/ideologies in the play.Â\n\nMeasure for Measure is often regarded as an anti-Puritan satire. Although Shakespeareâs religion has been a subject of much debate and research, with many theories about his faith being brought forward, many believe that he was a secret Catholic. He is believed to be a âsecretâ Catholic, as he lived during the rise of the Puritans - those who wished to reform the Church of England and create more of a focus on Protestant teachings, as opposed to Catholic teachings. It was often difficult for Catholics to practice their faith at this time.Â\n\nAngelo and Isabella - particularly Angelo, are believed to embody puritanism, as shown through their excessive piety. By revealing Angelo to be âyet a devil,â though âangel on the outward side,â Shakespeare critiques Puritans, perhaps branding them as hypocritical or even unhuman; those ânot born of man and woman.â Thus, we can assume that Shakespeare would take a similar stance to most of us - that Angelo wasnât the greatest guy and that his excessive, unnatural and puritanical nature was more of a flaw than a virtue.Â\n\nTips for Moving Past the Generic Examples/Evidence Found in the PlayÂ\n\nItâs important to try and stand out with your examples in your body paragraphs. If youâre writing the same, simple ideas as everyone else, it will be hard for VCAA assessors to reward you for that. Your ideas are the most important part of your essay because they show how well youâve understood and analysed the text - which is what they are asking from you, itâs called an âanalytical interpretation of a text,â not âhow many big words can you write in this essay.â You can stand out in Measure for Measure by:Â\n\n1. Taking Note of Stage Directions and Structure of Speech\n\nMany students tend to simply focus on the dialogue in the play, but stage directions can tell you so much about what Shakespeare was really trying to illustrate in his characters.Â\n\nFor example, in his monologue, I would often reference how Angelo is alone on stage, appearing at his most uninhibited, with his self-interrogation revealing his internal struggle over his newfound lust for Isabella. I would also reference how Shakespeareâs choice of syntax and structure of speech reveal Angeloâs moral turmoil as he repetitively asks himself âwhatâs this?â indicating his confusion and disgust for his feelings which âunshapesâ him.Â\n\nIsabella is shown to â[kneel]â by Mariana at the conclusion of the play, in order to ask for Angeloâs forgiveness. This detail is one that is easily missed, but it is an important one, as it is an obvious reference to Christianity, and symbolises Isabellaâs return to her âgentle and fairâ and âsaintâ like nature.Â\n\n2. Drawing Connections Between Characters - Analyse Their Similarities and Differences.Â\n\nDrawing these connections can be a useful way to incorporate other characters not necessarily mentioned in your prompt. For example, in my own English exam last year, I chose the prompt â...Power corrupts both Angelo and the Duke. Do you agree?â and tried to pair Angelo and Isabella, in order to incorporate another character into my essay (so that my entire essay wasnât just about two characters).\n\nA favourite pair of mine to analyse together was Angelo and Isabella. Although at first glance they seem quite different, when you read into the text a little deeper you can find many similarities. For example, while Angelo lives alone in his garden, âsuccumbed by brick,â requiring âtwo keysâ to enter, ânun,â Isabella, wishes to join the nuns of Saint Clare where she âmust not speak with menâ or âshow [her] face.â Shakespeareâs depiction of the two, stresses their seclusion, piety and restriction from the âviceâ plaguing Vienna. Whatâs important about this point is that you can alter your wording of it to fit various points that you may make. For example, you could use this example to prove to your assessor how Isabellaâs alignment with Angelo signals Shakespeareâs condemnation of her excessive puritanical nature (as I did in my body paragraph below) or, you could use these same points to argue how Angelo was once indeed a virtuous man who was similar to the âsaintâ Isabella, and that it was the power that corrupted him (as you could argue in the 2019 prompt).Â\n\nAnother great pair is the Duke and Angelo. Although they certainly are different in many ways, an interesting argument that I used frequently, was that they both were selfish characters who abused their power as men and as leaders in a patriarchal society. It is obvious where Angelo did this - through his cruel bribery of Isabella to âlay down the treasures of [her] body,â however the Dukeâs behaviour is more subtle. The Dukeâs proposal to Isabella at the conclusion of the play, as he asks her to âgive [him her] hand,â in marriage, coincides with the revelation that Claudio is indeed alive. It appears that the Duke has orchestrated the timing of his proposal to most forcefully secure Isabella and in this sense, his abuse of power can be likened to Angeloâs âdevilishâ bribery. This is as, through Shakespeareâs depiction of Isabella, it is evident that she has little interest in marriage; she simply wishes to join a convent where she âmust not speak with men,â as she lives a life of âstrict restraint.â The Duke is aware of this, yet he demands Isabella to âbe [his]â-Â wishing to take her from her true desire and Shakespeare is able to elucidate Isabellaâs distaste through her response to this: silence. By contrasting Isabellaâs once powerful voice - her âspeechless dialectâ that can âmove menâ - with her silence in response to the Dukeâs proposal, Shakespeare is able to convey the depth of the Dukeâs selfishness and thus his similarity to Angelo.\n\nWe've got a character list for you in Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare (just scroll down to the Character section).\n\nWhatâs important to realise about these bits of evidence is that you can use them in so many different prompts, provided that you tailor your wording to best answer the topic. For example, you could try fitting at least one of the above examples in these prompts:Â\n\nâGive me your hand and say you will be mineâ¦â The characters in âMeasure for Measureâ are more interested in taking than giving. Discuss.Â\n\nâMore than our brother is our chastity.' Explore how Shakespeare presents Isabella's attitude to chastity throughout Measure for Measure.\n\nâI have seen corruption boil â¦' To what extent does Shakespeare explore corruption in Measure for Measure, and by what means?Â\n\nâMeasure or Measure presents a society in which women are denied power.â Discuss.\n\nHow To Kick Start Your Essay with a Smashing Introduction\n\nThereâs no set way on how to write an introduction. Lots of people write them in many different ways and these can all do well! This is the best part about English - you donât have to be writing like the person sitting next to you in order to get a good mark. I personally preferred writing short and sweet introductions, just because they were quick to write and easy to understand.Â\n\nFor example, for the prompt...\n\nâ...women are frail too.âÂ\n\nTo what extent does âMeasure for Measureâ examine the flaws of Isabella?Â\n\n...my topic sentences were...\n\nIsabella is depicted as a moral, virtuous and pious woman, but it is this aspect of her nature that paradoxically aligns her with the âtyrannousâ Angelo.Â\n\nShakespeare explores the hypocrisy and corruption of Isabella as a flaw, as she deviates from her initially âgentle and fairâ nature.\n\nDespite exploring Isabellaâs flaws to a large degree, Shakespeare does indeed present her redemption at the denouement of the play.Â\n\n...and my introduction was:Â\n\nWilliam Shakespeareâs play, âMeasure for Measureâ depicts a seventeenth century Viennese society in which disease, misconduct and licentiousness are rife. It is upon a backdrop of such ordeals that Shakespeare presents the character of Isabella, who is initially depicted as of stark contrast to the libertine populate of Vienna. To a considerable extent, âMeasure for Measureâ does indeed examine the flaws of the âgentle and fairâ Isabella, but Shakespeare suggests that perhaps she is not âsaintâ nor âdevil,â rather that she is a human with her own flaws and with her own redeeming qualities.Â\n\nInstead of rewording my topic sentences, I touched on them more vaguely, because I knew that I wouldnât get any âextraâ points for repeating them twice, essentially.Â However, if you feel more confident in touching on your topic sentences more specifically - go ahead!! There are so many different ways to write an introduction! Do what works for you!Â\n\nBody ParagraphsÂ\n\nThis body paragraph included my pairing between Angelo and Isabella. My advice would be to continue to incorporate the language used in the prompt. In this paragraph, you can see me use the word âflawâ quite a bit, just in order to ensure that Iâm actually answering the prompt, not a prompt that I have studied before.Â\n\nIsabella is depicted as a moral, virtuous and pious woman, but it is this aspect of her nature that paradoxically aligns her with the âtyrannousâ Angelo. Where Angelo is âof ample grace and honour,â Isabella is âgentle and fair.â Where Angelo believes in âstricture and firm abstinence,â Isabella too believes that âmost desire should meet the full blow of justice.â This similarity is enhanced by their seclusion from the lecherous society in which they reside. Angelo lives alone in his garden, âsuccumbed by brick,â requiring âtwo keysâ to enter, whilst Isabella desires the life of a nun where she âmust not speak with menâ or âshow [her] face.â This depiction of both Angelo and Isabella stresses their seclusion, piety and restriction from the âviceâ that the libertine populate is drunk from. However, Shakespeareâs revelation that Angelo is âyet a devilâ though âangel on the outward side,â is perhaps Shakespeareâs commentary on absolute stricture being yet a facade, a flaw even. Shakespeare presents Isabellaâs chastity and piety as synonymous with her identity, which ultimately leaves her unable to differentiate between the two, as she states that she would âthrow down [her] life,â for Claudio, yet maintains that âmore than our brother is our chastity.â Though virtuous in a sense, she is cruel in another. Although at first glance, Shakespeareâs depiction of Isabellaâs excessive puritanical nature appears to be her virtue, by aligning her with the âdevilâ that is Angelo, it appears that this is indeed her flaw.Â\n\nConclude Your Essay by Dazzling Your Assessor!Â Â\n\nMy main tip for a conclusion is to finish it off with a confident commentary of the entire piece and what you think that the author was trying to convey through their words (in relation to the topic). For example, in pretty much all of my essays, I would conclude with a sentence that referenced the entire play -Â for example, how it appeared to be such a polarising play, with largely exaggerated, polarising characters/settings (eg. Angelo and the Duke, or the brothels that stood tall next to the monastery):Â\n\nUltimately, Shakespeareâs play âMeasure for Measure,â depicts Isabella as a multifaceted character. She is not simply one thing - not simply good nor bad -Â her characterâs depiction continues to oscillate between the polar ends of the spectrum. Although yes, she does have flaws, so too does she have redeeming qualities. Though at times deceitful and hypocritical, she too is forgiving and gentle. Thus, as Shakespeareâs play, âMeasure for Measure,â does centre on polarising characters in a polarising setting, perhaps through his exploration of Isabellaâs flaws alongside her virtues, he suggests that both the good and the bad inhabit us.\n\nMeasure for Measure is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nWeâve explored themes, literary devices and characters and development amongst other things over on our After Darkness by Christine Piper blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an After Darkness essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nLetâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt:Â\n\nâWhile Ibaraki clearly suffers the consequences of his actions, it is those closest to him who pay the highest price. Discuss.â\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis is a theme-based prompt, and the keywords are: suffer, consequence, actions and highest price. You want to explore both the evidence that supports the statement and also any evidence that may offer a contradiction to the statement.\n\nFrom here you can find the definition of the keywords to help develop some questions to explore.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nTo suffer is to be affected by or subject to something unpleasant.Â\n\nIs Ibaraki the only one who suffers? Who else suffers?\n\nKayoko, Johnny, Stan, Sister Bernice.\n\nHow do characters deal with their suffering differently?\n\nKayoko and Sister Bernice abandon their relationships with Ibaraki, Johnny becomes agitated and spiteful, Stan becomes depressed.Â\n\nA consequence is a result of an action.Â\n\nAre the consequences negative or positive?\n\nJohnny being outspoken in the internment camp angers the traditionalist Japanese, but creates a sense of kinship amongst the half-blood Japanese.Â\n\nCan characters overcome these consequences or learn from them?\n\nIbaraki eventually learns from his mistakes and grows as a result.Â\n\nAn action is the process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim.Â\n\nIs it Ibarakiâs actions, or lack thereof that lead to consequences?\n\nIt is often his silence and obedience that cause trouble. For example, not telling Kayoko about his work leads to the failure of their marriage.Â\n\nIs it only Ibaraki who makes mistakes?\n\nSister Bernice ignores her religion to confess her love for Ibaraki.Â\n\nWhat are the factors that cause the characters to act in the way that they do?\n\nIbarakiâs guilt and fear of authority and judgement prevent him from speaking up on multiple occasions.Â\n\nHighest price refers to Ibarakiâs suffering being above all else.Â\n\nIs this true?\n\nIbaraki loses his dignity, his friends, his wife, his unborn child, his family, his job and his freedom. However, he does partially regain these.Â\n\nWho suffers the most?\n\nKayoko has a miscarriage and her marriage to Ibaraki fails. Stan is assaulted by other internees and is eventually killed by a guard. Johnny becomes an outcast in his community and is bullied by other internees.Â\n\nAt this point, you can begin to group your ideas and evidence from the text to support your claims.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper uses a variety of literary devices including dialogue, simile and foreshadowing to convey her message of every action having a consequence. The most prominent of these is her use of imagery and metaphor which she uses to illustrate Ibarakiâs guilt and the way it impacts his actions. However, the story is not only centred around Ibaraki. Piper also highlights that people will often face consequences no matter what decision they make. She does this through her use of foil characters (characters who are used to highlight a particular trait in another character). For example, Ibarakiâs fear and obedience are emphasised by the courage of Kayoko and Johnny Chang. These characters, alongside Ibaraki, face suffering as a result of their actions.Â\n\nFrom these ideas, the main themes I am going to explore are what factors affect the characterâs actions, and how the consequences of these actions can lead to negative, but also positive change.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1:\n\nWhilst the novel centres around Ibarakiâs actions and their consequences, he is not the only character that makes mistakes and is forced to face the repercussions.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\nIt is not necessarily Ibarakiâs actions, but lack of action that often results in the suffering of those around him. Consider the reasons for his lack of action: his blind devotion to authority, his fear of judgement, his ongoing guilt and regret from previous situations.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, but it is not the only factor.\n\nParagraph 3:\n\nIbaraki may pay the highest price for his actions. The structure of the storyline to include a chapter from Ibarakiâs perspective years later indicates that these consequences have ultimately led to positive change.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nNow it is time to write the essay!\n\nSet during the Pacific War, Christine Piperâs After Darkness explores the difficulties and misfortunes many face during wartime. Depicting the rise and fall of Japanâs war efforts (1), After Darkness highlights that all actions have consequences of varying severity, particularly those of protagonist Dr Ibaraki Tomokazu. Throughout the novel, Ibarakiâs lack of action perpetuates the suffering of those closest to him, however, this is shown to be one of many factors and often initiates positive change within him, allowing his character to develop. Fundamentally, After Darkness highlights that change can only occur if people face the repercussions of their actions. (2)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) In the introduction, it is important to introduce the text withcontext. As After Darkness is predominantly set in 1942 during wartime in both Japan and Australia, it is important to include this in the introduction in order to explore the essay topic with a complete understanding.Â\n\n(2) Another key part of the introduction is to briefly introduce the topics you will discuss throughout the essay.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper emphasises the idea that all actions have consequences, however, this idea is not limited to Ibaraki. Across the three novel strands, protagonist Dr Tomokazu Ibarakiâs suffering as a result of his mistakes is depicted through both his internal and external dialogue. Ibaraki makes many significant mistakes throughout his lifetime, one of these being his failure to perform a dissection of a child when working at Unit 731. Despite ânot [being] [him]selfâ (3) when asked to perform the operation, Ibaraki is promptly fired. His termination of employment is not the only consequence of his failure, as shame continues to take over his confidence. This is illustrated when he was âunable to go onâ during an operation in Broome, despite being in a completely different scenario. Through Ibarakiâs flashback of âBlack dots on a childâs bellyâ, Piper indicates the torment and lasting effects of consequences on an individual (4). Whilst the novel centres around his mistakes, it is revealed that Ibaraki is not the only character who is forced to face the repercussions of their actions. Despite acting as foils for Ibaraki and presenting many different qualities, Australian internees Johnny Chang and Stan Suzuki also struggle immensely to overcome the results of their behaviours. Johnny Changâs outspoken nature is often shown to cause disruption among the camp, for example, labelling the imperialist Japanese as âemperor worshipping pigâs.â In standing for his beliefs, Johnny creates a tense division within groups, leading to the half Australian internees being treated like âoutcastsâ. Conversely, Stanâs introverted behaviour results in his eventual death (5). Piperâs contention that all actions have consequences is arguably enforced strongly through Stanâs death, as it results from the failure of many characters to act. Ibarakiâs inability to open up, Johnnyâs selfishness and Stanâs loss of self are inevitably all factors leading to his eventual demise. This is ultimately reinforced when Johnny states âIt shouldâve been me Docâ, indicating he has finally realised his role in the tragedy.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) In order to embed quotes, words, prefixes and suffixes can be added to ensure the sentence flows correctly. However, you must indicate that you have edited the quote by placing your changes in square brackets. Here, the original quote was ânot myselfâ but it has been changed to fit the sentence.Â\n\n(4) Whilst it is important to include quotes, it is even more important that you analyse how the author uses the quote to convey a message. In this case, the example of one of Ibarakiâs many flashbacks is used to bear Piperâs belief that one cannot escape the repercussions of their actions.\n\n(5) Comparison is a powerful way of exploring the authorâs ideas throughout the text. Here, Johnnyâs outspoken nature is contrasted with Stanâs âintroverted behaviourâ, yet both concede repercussions. This supports the idea that all actions have consequences, no matter their nature.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, however, it is not the only factor. After Darkness shows the faults in many of Ibarakiâs actions, suggesting his mistakes lead to the misfortunes of many of those around him but this is only partially true. Stan Suzukiâs death is a pivotal moment in the novel where Ibaraki begins to truly express his emotions and open up about the pain he feels (6). Ibaraki realises that he âcould have done somethingâ when opening up to the investigators of Stanâs death, leading to the conclusion that Ibaraki is to blame. Piper illustrates that suffering results as a combination of factors through the later revelations of Johnnyâs escape attempt and the instability of the âtrigger-happyâ guard who shot Stan. This idea is reinforced through the breakdowns of Ibarakiâs close relationships with Kayoko and Sister Bernice. Whilst Ibarakiâs emotionally distant nature catalysed the loss of these significant relationships, it was not the only factor. Both Kayoko and Sister Bernice are structured with similar characteristics in the novel, one being their confidence and strength in their beliefs. Nevertheless, both women lack this characteristic when it comes to their relationship with Ibaraki (7). Ibaraki admits his separation from Kayoko is his âgreatest regretâ, and whilst the first-person perspective does not give an insight into Kayokoâs side, she is shown to lack her usual self-assuredness. Similarly, Ibarakiâs allowance of âsilence [to] stretch betweenâ¦â him and Sister Bernice is hurtful and a failure on his behalf, yet she still willingly confesses her feelings, aware of the risks involved. This is evident when âher eyes dart away from [his]â, implying she is ashamed of her statement as it contradicts her religion and the terms of their work relationship and friendship. This results in an abrupt end to their friendship as the embarrassment of the repercussions of her actions overwhelm Sister Bernice. Whilst the series of mistakes that Ibaraki makes throughout the novel show that his actions cause grief for both him and the people around him, they also highlight that the misfortune of others is not always the fault of one individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(6) Referring to specific events in the text is extremely useful to support your ideas and claims. However, it is important that you avoid over-explaining the event, as this will lead to you retelling, rather than analysing the text. See How To Avoid Retelling the Story for more tips.Â\n\n(7) An often-overlooked literary device is the use of foils. A foil is a character that is used to highlight a particular trait in another character, often a flaw. In this case, Piper uses the similarities between Kayoko and Sister Bernice, and the ultimate failure of their relationships. This highlights Ibarakiâs repetition of his mistakes, which we can attribute to his ongoing guilt.Â\n\nIbaraki ultimately pays the highest price for his actions; although this is shown to result in positive change. Through her descriptions of Australia and Japan, Piper uses the juxtaposition of light and dark imagery to illustrate how suffering can lead to learning and growth. Facing racism in Broome when labelled as a âBloody Japâ¦â, trauma from his experiences in Unit 731 and hardship during his internment at Loveday, Ibaraki is constantly a victim of circumstance. Even so, the pressures and torment of these events force him to seek the support of others. The colourful descriptions of the âpink spur of land crested with greenâ foreshadow the positive change to come for Ibaraki (8). This becomes evident when Ibaraki finally opens up to Stan in the infirmary about his separation from Kayoko. Ibarakiâs development as a character continues as he learns to trust despite the unfair circumstances of being interned. Although memories of trees haunting the riverâs edge âlike lost peopleâ and the bark of red trees appearing âlike blistered skinâ continue to plague Ibarakiâs conscience, they force him to confront his past and in turn begin to heal. Through the retrospective novel, Piper describes Japan as where âdarkness crowded the cornersâ and Ibaraki worked âin the basementâ, indicating his misguided obedience and attachment to silence. This not only illustrates (9) Ibarakiâs trauma, but emphasises his drastic development through his experiences. The importance of the consequences Ibaraki has faced throughout his lifetime are reinforced in the final pages of the novel after he reads Sister Berniceâs letter and has an epiphany. The discovery that he had âclung to the ideal of discretionâ creates a sense of hope for Ibarakiâs future and emphasises his newfound understanding of life through the consequences he has faced. (10)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) Ensure you donât just randomly place quotes throughout the essay, but instead, analyse them to give them meaning. An easy way to do this is by including the quote, its connotations and what emotions or ideas they provoke, followed by why the author has used it. In this case, the quote was the âpink spur of land crested with green.â Its connotations were positive such as colour, happiness, and hope. These connotations were used to foreshadow positive change.Â\n\n(9) Using a variety of vocabulary such as âillustratesâ, âexploresâ and âdemonstratesâ shows that you are not only identifying what the author is doing but that you understand how and why they have done it in this way. This is ultimately the goal of a text response essay.Â\n\n(10) It is important to ensure the flow of your essay to show sophistication in your writing. It is not only the ideas you have, but the way in which you convey and explain them that ultimately indicates your understanding of the text. A simple way to do this is to use a summary sentence at the end of each topic that subscribes to the idea and links to the previous or following paragraph.Â\n\nEssentially After Darkness highlights the necessity of facing consequences for our actions to promote learning and growth. Whilst Ibaraki and many other characters suffered as a result of their behaviour, Piper asserts that Ibaraki is not the overall perpetrator but ultimately pays the highest price of all. (11)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(11) Just like the introduction, the conclusion is a brief summary of the discussion topics throughout your text response. Most importantly, after exploring all of the evidence you must form a stance in relation to the essay topic. Many students believe that this needs to be a simple and definite yes or no, which is not the case. Instead, I have suggested that Ibaraki is not the only one to blame for other characterâs suffering, but that ultimately, he paid the highest price.

Introduction\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that depicts the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Polish Jewish Holocaust survivor who experienced living in the ghettos and concentration camps during the Nazi regime. Vladekâs son, Art has transformed his story into a comic book through his interviews and encounters which interweaves with Artâs own struggles as the son of a Holocaust survivor, as well as the complex and difficult relationship with his father.\n\n2. ThemesÂ\n\nSurvivalÂ\n\nSurvival is a key theme that is explored during Vladekâs experience in concentration camps and his post-Holocaust life.Â\n\nFor example, Vladek reflects that âYou have to struggle for lifeâ and a means of survival was through learning to be resourceful at the concentration camps.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nResourcefulness is depicted through the physical items Vladek keeps or acquires, as well as through Vladekâs skills. For example, Vladek explains to Art that he was able to exploit his work constantly through undertaking the roles of a translator and a shoemaker in order to access extra food and clothing by being specially treated by the Polish Kapo.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHe even wins over Anjaâs Kapo to ensure that she would be treated well by not being forced to carry heavy objects. Vladekâs constant recounts and reflections symbolise survival, as Vladek was willing and able to use his skill set to navigate through the campâs work system.\n\nDuring the concentration camps, food and clothes also became a currency due to its scarcity and Vladek was insistent on being frugal and resourceful, which meant that he was able to buy Anjaâs release from the Birkenau camp.\n\nâGuilt\n\nAlthough survival is a key theme, the graphic novel explores how Holocaust survivors in The Complete Maus grapple with their deep psychological scars.Â\n\nMany of those who survived the war suffered from depression and was burdened with âsurvivorâs guiltâ. This can be seen through the character of Artâs mother, Anja, as 20 years after surviving the death camps, she commits suicide. After having lost so many of her friends, and families, she struggled to find a reason as to why she survived but others didnât. Throughout the graphic novel, her depression is apparent. In a close-up shot, Anja appears harrowed and says that âI just donât want to liveâ, lying on a striped sofa to convey a feeling of hopelessness as if she was in prison. Her ears are additionally drawn as drooped, with her hands positioned as if she was in prison in the context is that she must go to a sanatorium for her depression.\n\nIt is not only Anjaâs guilt that is depicted, but also Art himself who feels partly responsible. Art feels that people think it is his fault as he says that âThey think itâs MY fault!â and in one panel, Art is depicted behind bars and that â[He] has committed the perfect crimeâ to illustrate that he feels a sense of guilt in that he never really was the perfect son. He believes he is partly responsible for her death, due to him neglecting their relationship. Spiegelman also gives insight to readers of a memory of his mother where she asks if he still loves her, he responds with a dismissive âsureâ which is a painful reminder of this disregard.Â\n\nIntergenerational Gap\n\nArt constantly ponders how he is supposed to âmake any sense out of Auschwitzâ if he âcanât even make any sense out of [his] relationship with [his] fatherâ. As a child of Jewish refugees, Art has not had the same first-hand horrific experiences as his parents and in many instances struggles to relate to Vladekâs stubborn and resourceful tendencies. Art reflects on this whilst talking to Mala about when he would not finish everything his mother served, he would âargue til I ran to my room cryingâ. This emphasises how he didnât understand wastage or frugality even from a very young age, unlike Vladek.\n\nSpiegelman also conveys to readers his sense of frustration with Vladek where he feels like he is being treated like a child, not as an adult. For example, Art is shocked that Vladek would throw out one of Artâs coats and instead buy a new coat, despite Vladekâs hoarding because he is reluctant and feels shameful to let his son wear his âold shabby coatâ. This act could be conveyed to readers that Vladek is trying to give Art a life he never had and is reluctant to let his son wear clothes that are âinappropriateâ in his eyes. However, from Artâs perspective, he âjust canât believe itâ and does not comprehend his behaviour.\n\nSince we're talking about themes, we've broken down a theme-based essay prompt (one of five types of essay prompts) for you in this video:\n\n3. Analysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that may seem daunting to analyse compared to a traditional novel. However, with countless panels throughout the book, you have the freedom to interpret certain visuals so long as you give reasoning and justification, guiding the teacher or examiner on what you think these visuals mean. Here are some suggested tips:\n\nFocus on the Depiction of Characters\n\nSpiegelman may have purposely drawn the eyes of the Jewish mice as visible in contrast to the unapparent eyes of the Nazis to humanise and dehumanise characters. By allowing readers to see the eyes of Jewish mice, readers can see the expressions and feelings of the character such as anger and determination. Effectively, we can see them as human characters through their eyes. The Nazisâ eyes, on the other hand, are shaded by their helmets to signify how their humanity has been corrupted by the role they fulfill in the Holocaust.\n\nâ\n\nWhen the readers see their eyes, they appear sinister, with little slits of light. By analysing the depictions and expressions of characters, readers can deduce how these characters are intended to be seen.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nLook at the Background in Each Panel\n\nThroughout the graphic novel, symbols of the Holocaust appear consistently in the background. In one panel, Artâs parents, Anja and Vladek have nowhere to go, a large Swastika looms over them to represent that their lives were dominated by the Holocaust.\n\nEven in Artâs life, a panel depicts him as working on his desk with dead bodies surrounding him and piling up to convey to the reader that the Holocaust still haunts him to this day, and feels a sense of guilt at achieving fame and success at their expense.\n\nThus, the constant representation of symbols from the Holocaust in Spiegelmanâs life and his parentsâ past in the panelsâ background highlights how inescapable the Holocaust is emotionally and psychologically.Â\n\nSize of Panels\n\nSome of the panels in the graphic novel are of different sizes which Spiegelman may have intended to emphasise the significance of certain turning points, crises or feelings. For example, on page 34, there is a disproportionate panel of Vladek and Anja passing a town, seeing the first signs of the Nazi regime compared to the following panels. All the mice seem curious and concerned, peering at the Nazi flag behind them. This panel is significant as it marks the beginning of a tragic regime that would dominate for the rest of their lives.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to how some panels have a tendency to overlap with each other which could suggest a link between events, words or feelings.\n\nAlthough not specifically targeted at Text Response, 10 Things to Look for in Cartoons is definitely worth a read for any student studying a graphic novel!\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nKey Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nPoetic Analysis Examples\n\n1. Introduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nWilliam Wordsworth was a British poet and primary co-founder of the Romantic literary movement. He strongly believed that the poetry of the nineteenth century was much too fast-paced and too mindless to be able to evoke a meaningful message to the reader. Contending that âall good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling,â he wished to pioneer Romanticism to create a genre of poetry that reminded the reader of the very essence of humanity.\n\nAs such, Wordsworth and fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge founded a new style of poetry through their co-written 1798 Lyrical Ballads, a collection of poetry which attempted to unite the human condition with the tranquility of nature.Â\n\nAs a resident of Englandâs picturesque Lake District, Wordsworth enjoyed becoming one with nature by wandering through the neighbouring hills, moors and lakeside views, while mentally composing poems inspired by its glorious elements.Â\n\nWilliam Wordsworth: Poems Selected by Seamus Heaney is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\n2. Key Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nNature\n\nThe Romantic movement of poetry was founded during the Industrial Revolution, a period in which people were growing farther from the serene comfort of nature and closer towards modern mechanisation and mass manufacturing. As such, a primary characteristic of Romantic poetry is nature, as poets attempted to remind humanity of its meditative respite, and the comfort it could provide in the backdrop of the pollution that accompanied the growing industrialisation of England.Â\n\nWordsworth was a pantheist and believed that God was within every aspect of the natural world. In addition to this, he categorised himself as an ardent âworshipper of natureâ. Thus, much of his poetry explores nature in a sacred and religious sense, presenting goodness and naturalness as synonymous - aptly displaying his belief of nature as a living, divine entity that could only to be ignored at humankindâs peril.Â\n\nEmotionalismÂ\n\nRomantic poetry subdues reason, intellect and the scientific truth in order to place more focus on the âtruth of the imaginationâ. As a result of the harsh rigidity and rationality of the Enlightenment era, all human sentiments, from melancholiness to hopefulness, were celebrated by Romantics as important instruments in poetry to remind the common people of sentimentality in a modern and intransigent era.Â\n\nAs Romantics believed that these feelings allowed one to look deeper into oneâs self, the theme of powerful emotions constructs the very essence of Romantic poetic poetry. As a result of this, rather than placing much importance on sense or sensibility, much of Wordsworthâs poems scrutinise his own effusion of feelings and the universal truths that these help him discover, speaking as the characteristic Romantic poet occupying a sentimental place of alienation.\n\nRebellion and Individualism\n\nThe Industrial Revolution oversaw the creation of distinct class differences between the extremely wealthy class of businessmen, and financially struggling workers and entrepreneurs. Poets, like all other artists, were forced to become increasingly independent and needed to rely on their unique vision and style in order to succeed in their gradually declining line of work. The Romantics subsequently began to view themselves as heroes who challenged and overcame the social challenges that arose; as champions of independence and self-awareness. As such, Romantic poetry often features characters or symbols of valiant heroism, as the poet acts as a visionary figure in his work, like a prophet telling of poetic self-awareness.Â\n\nThe Sublime\n\nIn accordance with their celebration of human emotions, Romantics also became fascinated with the literary conception of âthe sublimeâ, a mental state that Classical authors such as Longinus defined as âphysical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic greatnessâ that is of such magnificence that it cannot be measured.Â\n\nThe Romantics explored these extraordinary experiences in their poetry, describing the power of such sublime experiences on oneâs senses, mind and imagination. Wordsworth expressed in his essay that a sublime experience is what occurs when oneâs mind attempts to attain âsomething towards which it can make approaches but which it is incapable of attainingâ. For example, his biographical poem, The Prelude recounts his ascent of Mount Snowdon and the sublime emotions he experiences as a result of its powerful atmosphere.Â\n\nMany have viewed Wordsworthâs view of the sublime as the Romantic standard, as his poetry focuses equally on both the alluring and devastating aspects of such sublime experiences. His work focuses on the intertwined pleasure and terror that is generated as a result of such experiences, and how either end of the spectrum is ultimately beautiful and inspiring.\n\nContext is really important when engaging with a text in VCE English, so be sure to read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\n3. Poetic Analysis ExamplesÂ\n\nExample Passage 1\n\nBooks! 'tis a dull and endless strife:\n\nCome, hear the woodland linnet,\n\nHow sweet his music! on my life,\n\nThere's more of wisdom in it.\n\nAnd hark! how blithe the throstle sings!\n\nHe, too, is no mean preacher:\n\nCome forth into the light of things,\n\nLet Nature be your teacher.\n\nThis passage, taken from Wordsworthâs Tables Turned; An Evening Scene on the Same Subject, is a primary example of a poem displaying the Romanticsâ propensity and reverence for the natural landscape.Â Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nThe speaker of the poem contrasts the âendless strifeâ of book-learning to the spontaneous and liberal method of learning through interacting with nature. The description of the âwoodland [linnetâs]â song as âsweetâ music evokes an image of heavenly bliss associated with the charms hidden within nature. That âthereâs more of wisdom inâ such nature works in tandem with this, as the speaker asserts that the natural landscape is able to teach a lesson of a magnificence incomparable to the monotony of the âdullâ studying thorough book-learning.Â\n\nThe speakerâs evocation of âblitheâ emotions through sound is continued in the second stanza, in which âthe throstleâ delivers another divine âsongâ in an attempt to entice the reader. The speaker furthers his advocation for natural learning through a condemnation of route learning, as he attacks teachers of such as âmean preachersâ. The directly following use of a pun emphasises this contrast, as the âlight of thingsâ symbolises both the enlightenment that will accompany natureâs teaching, as well as the literal âlightâ of nature underneath the sun.Â\n\nThe final line of the passage summarises the speakerâs persuasion aptly, as the phrase, âlet nature be your teacherâ, rings similar to a passage which can be found in the Bible; the speaker thus implies that the natural world is the all-superior entity and source of knowledge that one should take lessons from.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe rhyme and the rhythmic beat of the poem give it a sound comparable to a nursery-rhyme. This works in tandem with the Romantic viewpoint that great poetic language should be simple, accessible and conversational; as understandable to the common people as a nursery rhyme is to a child. This similarity also works in accordance with the authorial message of the poem, that nature should be a universal âteacherâ, as nursery rhymes are often employed as enjoyable sing-songs that educate children on a moral level. As such, Wordsworth here strengthens his viewpoint through his poetic words; that nature should be a mentor to all.Â\n\nExample Passage 2\n\nâFor thou art with me here upon the banksÂ\n\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catchÂ\n\nThe language of my former heart, and readÂ\n\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lightsÂ\n\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little whileÂ\n\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,Â\n\nKnowing that Nature never did betrayÂ\n\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,Â\n\nThrough all the years of this our life, to leadÂ\n\nFrom joy to joyâ¦\n\nTherefore let the moonÂ\n\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;Â\n\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be freeÂ\n\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,Â\n\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be maturedÂ\n\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mindÂ\n\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,Â\n\nThy memory be as a dwelling-placeÂ\n\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,Â\n\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,Â\n\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughtsÂ\n\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,Â\n\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchanceâÂ\n\nIf I should be where I no more can hearÂ\n\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleamsÂ\n\nOf past existenceâwilt thou then forgetÂ\n\nThat on the banks of this delightful streamÂ\n\nWe stood together; and that I, so longÂ\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither cameÂ\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather sayÂ\n\nWith warmer loveâoh! with far deeper zealÂ\n\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,Â\n\nThat after many wanderings, many yearsÂ\n\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,Â\n\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to meÂ\n\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\n\nThis passage is taken from the final section from Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, a critical work in Wordsworthâs poetic career. Tracing the growth of his mind in different periods of time, the poem is a condensed, spiritual autobiography of Wordsworth himself as it views his younger self from the perspective of his older self, weighing the sense of âlossâ suffered against the belief that the years have brought him âabundant recompenseâ.Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nAfter recalling his experiences with nature over his formative and adult years, the speaker now addresses his younger sister Dorothy, as he gives her heartfelt advice about what he has learnt. Here, Dorothy becomes a ghost of his former self, as he hears âthe language of his former heartâ when she speaks and perceives his âformer pleasureâ in the âsoothing lights of [her] wild eyesâ.Â\n\nThe speaker depicts his loyalty to nature and its reflective loyalty to him, by the expression that ânature never did betray [his] heartâ that loves Dorothy, and this is the reason they have been living from âjoy to joyâ, lending nature a role of salvation.Â\n\nThe speaker then directly addresses the moon as a kind of separate entity, in order to ask it to bless his sister by shining on her âsolitary walkâ, so that when she is an adult her mind may become a âmansion for all lovely formsâ. This is an ode to the harshness of the society at the time, in which the privileged businessmen and factory owners possessed a monopoly over British wealth, and accompanying prejudices clouded social judgement. As such, the speaker expresses his desires for his beloved sister to be exempt from such hardship that he was once subjected to, so that she can enjoy âsweet sounds and memoriesâ without experiencing the vexations of an unrelenting human society.Â\n\nThe conclusion of the poem is cyclic, as it takes the speaker back to the âgreen pastoral landscapeâ of the beginning of his meditations. This symbolises the omnipresent timelessness of nature. As the speaker muses upon his âpast existenceâ, he wishes to convey his own reverence for nature to his beloved sister, as he expresses that she will not forget the âsteep woods and lofty cliffsâ upon which he first understood and respected nature.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe language utilised in this poem is lucid and natural, characteristic of Romantic poetry. The simplicity of the words chosen by Wordsworth effectively communicate the honesty of his own emotions towards nature. The elevated blank verse structure furthers this simplicity, as its familiar and easy tone is like that of a comfortable heartbeat or pulse that runs throughout oneâs body in a serene state of mind.Â\n\nUltimately, the unconstrained and liberating tone of the poem, in accordance with its free blank verse structure emphasises Wordsworthâs belief that nature is within our very selves. Just as the poem runs smoothly and continuously, akin to a human pulse, Wordsworth suggests that nature too runs within everyone as an incessant heartbeat, necessary in order to experience a âwarmerâ and âholierâ love for this universe.\n\nContents\n\n1.

This is a novel about the experiences of children recovering from polio inside a convalescent home in Perth. With a sympathetic and warm approach, London tells the tragic yet brave stories of these children, as well as the stories of their parents and carers.\n\nThe novel essentially revolves around Frank Gold, a Hungarian Jew and a war refugee, and London blends his mature voice with the innocence of a coming-of-age narrative, all set against the backdrop of World War II.\n\nAs youâre reading the book, watch out for her literary or poetic language, and keep track of the storyâs overall mood. These will be important considerations for text study, particularly if you are to write a creative response on this text for your SAC. With this in mind, Iâve included writing exercises throughout this blog post for you to practise writing creatively on this text.\n\nIf you are writing analytically on this text, either for your SAC or for your exam, you may still complete the exercisesâeach one should still be insightful for your writing in some way. Also, feel free to check the video below; it breaks down an analytical prompt for this text.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThis novel is set in Perth during the early 1940s, which gives rise to a couple of interesting historical elements all intersecting in the book.\n\nCrucially, the events of the novel take place for the most part while World War II is raging in Europe. This is important for understanding the backstory of the Gold family: they are Hungarian Jews who have escaped their war-torn home of Budapest to seek safety in Australia. In particular, we know that at some stage, Meyer had been taken away to a labour camp, and that Frank had had to hide himself in an attic.\n\nTheir Hungarian heritage, however, is something that distances them from other Australians, and they never really get a good chance to settle in, always feeling like they just werenât on the same wavelength as the locals. In many ways, the story of the Golds is underpinned by tragedyânot only are they war refugees, but young Frank then contracts poliomyelitis (known to us just as polio), which forces the family to reassess all the plans they had for him to settle into an ordinary, Australian life.\n\nHowever, Frank was far from the only victim of polio at the timeâthe entire nation was rocked by a wave of polio, with major outbreaks during the 1930s-40s. This was quite a nerve-wracking, and causing great fear for our country and its active, outdoors-y culture. The prospects of death, paralysis and permanent disability were understandably terrifying. About 70,000 people were affected, and almost half of them eventually died as a result. Almost every Australian at the time knew or knew of someone who had polio.\n\nTask: You are Ida, composing a letter to Julia Marai after Frankâs diagnosis. Convey succinctly (in 250 words or less) what you think and how you feel.â\n\nKey Themes & Implications\n\nI like to think that a lot of the themes in this book exist in diametric or opposing pairs. For instance, London gives Frank a voice that is wise beyond his years, yet uses it to tell a tender story of first love. She also plays on the paradox that while some characters have become isolated due to the unfortunate events that have befallen them, these very events end up becoming the thing that unite them.\n\nEssentially, London plays with a lot of these thematic tensions, showing us that life isnât really ever black and white, but there are whole lot of grey areas in every day life.\n\nCentral to the novel are ideas of innocence or childhood. These ideas are really explored in the friendship between Frank and Elsa, who are both on the cusp of adolescence. While they are set up as young lovers in the eyes of readers, we know that they are far too young to truly have romantic feelings for each other. In actual fact, their interactions are permeated by a sense of innocence.\n\nHowever, these interactions are also punctuated by a sense of maturity, a desire for more. This is evident to the extent where nurses are getting hesitant about leaving them alone with each other (even though their parents still trust them entirely). In actual fact, these parents serve as an important point of contrast. Some manage to recapture the magic of youth even as adultsâconsider Ida reigniting her love for the piano, or Meyer jumping on opportunities to start anew. In this sense, innocence and maturity are a pair of themes that are interestingly not always found where one might expect.\n\nAnother key thematic element of the novel is tragedy or adversity, which are relevant to a far wider gamut of characters. Considering the storyâs geographical and historical setting, it seems evident that these ideas will play a major role in the story. A particularly poignant example lies in Sullivan, who contracts polio right on the cusp of adulthood, and readers canât help but feel a sense of loss for what might have been.\n\nHowever, on the other end of this spectrum is the strength required to cope with their suffering. While Sullivan had his indefatigable sense of humour, other characters have developed different mechanisms to stay strong in the face of adversity. In some cases, you might say that theyâve transcended or risen above their tragedies, and become stronger for it.\n\nFinally, London also tackles the idea of isolation, which can be seen as a consequence of tragedyâcharacters become isolated because they lose their ability to relate to others, and others feel unable to relate to them. Symbolically, the Golden Age hospital is surrounded by four roads and therefore cut off from the world, almost as if quarantined. However, the solidarity and unity of patients inside becomes a great source of strengthâIâll leave it to you to think about what London was trying to say with this!\n\nTask: Selecting one of the above themes, write a poem from the POV of an imaginary spectator in the novel, outlining how you perceive/experience these themes in other characters. Use all five senses(how you see it, hear it, smell it, taste it, and touch/feel it)\n\nMajor Characters\n\nI havenât written too extensively about characters for a range of reasons: on one hand, itâs important for you to form your own interpretations about what theyâre like and why they do the things they do, but on the other hand, I wanted to leave you with some key points to consider and/or some essential points about their characters to incorporate into your writing. This will allow you to hopefully feel like youâre capturing them accurately when writing your creatives, but without feeling restricted by an extensive set of traits that you have to invoke.\n\nFrank Gold\n\nthe central character, he is cerebral, intelligent and mature (which we can tell from his narrative voice, or how he âsoundsâ)\n\nhe is, however, still very young, wide-eyed, inquisitive in spite of the tragedies which have befallen him (consider how he sees his relationship with Elsa)\n\nalso significant is the motif of his poetry; not only does it highlight his maturity, but it also acts as a way for him to voice or articulate his feelings and experiences in the hospitalâyou could try incorporating some poetry in your writing (either original poems or quoted from the novel)\n\nElsa Briggs\n\nanother central character who becomes quite attached to Frank (they are the two eldest children in the Golden Age)\n\nshe is warm, caring and selfless, demonstrating an emotional maturity beyond her years (because of having to bear the metaphorical albatross of polio)\n\na lot of what we know about Elsa comes from Frankâs perspective (though we do get some insight from her own, and some from her motherâs)âhow does this shape the way we see her? Consider Londonâs use of imagery, portraying her as an angelic figure.\n\nIda & Meyer\n\nFrankâs parents, Hungarian Jews, and war refugees who come to Australia to cleanse them of their pasts and to have a fresh start; some of this is purely by circumstance, but there are parts of their past that they willingly and actively eschew e.g. Idaâs piano\n\nnote that Hungary is a landlocked country in the midst of European hustle and bustle with easy access to other nations/cultures/peoples, but Australia is an island on the other side of the worldâconsider how this affects their sense of isolation\n\non the other hand, they do form new connections with people here and in their own individual ways; Ida by reclaiming her pianist talents and Meyer by taking up a new job\n\nTask: You are Elsa, Ida, or Meyer and youâve just discovered Frankâs poem book. What are your thoughts and feelings towards his writing? Consider the context of your chosen characterâs own experiences\n\nMinor Characters\n\nIâm sure youâve heard it by now, but any piece of text-based writing (creative or analytical) can be strengthened by diversifying the range of characters that you write about. Even though youâve already differentiated yourself from most VCE students by even doing this text at all (very few people choose it, so props to you!), some inclusion of more minor characters might help to distinguish yourself further. Iâve picked some that I think are interesting to talk about, but feel free to experiment with others as well!\n\nSullivan\n\na young man who contracts a severe strand of polio right on the cusp of adulthood, thereby exemplifying the theme of tragedyâhowever, his sense of humour remains active in spite of his immobility, so perhaps he not only exemplifies this theme but subverts it as well\n\nLondon poses the complex question of whether or not heâs actually unhappy or defeated as a result of polio; thereâs no clear answer, since thereâs many ways to interpret his humour (is it a sign of strength or is it a front for inner turmoils expressed through poetry?)\n\nin addition to his humour and poetry, his relationship with his family could also be an interesting point of discussion to address some of these questions\n\nAnn Lee\n\na young girl in the hospital who is quite close to Elsa (almost in a sisterly way)âhow have they developed this relationship, and how does this relate to the theme of unity/companionship/human connection?\n\nnotably, she wanted to rehabilitate herself after polio took away her ability to feed the brumbies in her desert townâthink about how this might represent strength as well\n\nJulia Marai & Hedwiga\n\nIdaâs former piano teacher and her flatmate/partner who live at the top of an apartment block in Budapest; they shelter Frank in their attic under no obligation whatsoever, but purely out of the kindness and selflessness of their hearts\n\nagain, thereâs this subversion of what it means to be isolated: on one hand, their apartment is so cut off from the rest of the world below, and they lead a largely self-sufficient life together, but on the other hand, the fact that theyâre together means that theyâre not entirely isolated consider the power of human connection in this context as well\n\nTask: Pick a minor character from this list and a character from the above list of major characters, and write about them meeting each other for the first time. Pick two that do not already interact closely within the novel e.g. Elsa meeting Sullivan\n\nI hope this gives you some ideas or starting points about writing creatively on this text!\n\nDownload the PDF version of The Golden Age study guideÂ here.\n\nDissecting an A+ Essay using 'The Golden Age'\n\nPicture this: youâre sitting down at your desk, fumbling your fingers, inspecting the new stationary that you convinced yourself you needed for year 12, resisting the urge to check your phone. Your text response SAC is in two weeks. Youâre freaking out because you want, no, need an A+. You decide to write a practice essay for your English teacher. Practice makes perfect, right? You stay up for hours, pouring your heart and soul into this essay. The result? B+. Where did I go wrong?\n\nThatâs where I come in! Writing an A+ essay can be really tough without examples and specific advice. Before reading on, make sure you've read our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response so you are up to scratch.\n\nI will be explaining some basic dos and donâts of writing an essay on The Golden Age, providing a model essay as an example.\n\nThe following prompt will be referenced throughout the post;\n\nâThe Golden Ageâ shows that everyone needs love and recognition. Discuss.\n\nPlanning: the silent killer of A+ essays\n\nIâm sure your teachers have emphasised the importance of planning. In case they havenât, allow me to reiterate that great planning is compulsory for a great essay. However, flimsy arguments arenât going to get you an A+. The examiners are looking for complex arguments, providing a variety of perspectives of the themes at hand. From the above prompt, the key word is, âdiscussâ. This means that you should be discussing the prompt, not blindly agreeing with it. Make sure you donât write anything that wouldnât sit right with London.â\n\nDONâT\n\nDonât plan out basic arguments that are one-dimensional. This may give you a pass in English, but wonât distinguish you as a top-scoring student.\n\nFor example:\n\nParagraph 1: The children at TGA need love and recognition.\n\nParagraph 2: Ida and Meyer need love and recognition\n\nParagraph 3: Sister Penny needs love and recognition.\n\nThe above paragraphs merely agree with the statement, but donât delve into the many aspects of the novel that could contribute to a sophisticated essay.\n\nDO\n\nDo create complex arguments, or paragraphs with a twist! If you can justify your argument and it makes sense, include it in your essay. There are many ways that you could answer this question, but my plan looks like this:\n\nParagraph 1: Frank Gold yearns for mature, adult love, not recognition from onlookers or outsiders\n\nParagraph 2: Ida Gold does not seek recognition from Australia, but love and validation from herself\n\nParagraph 3: Albert requires love from a specific kind of relationship â family, and Sullivan may view love from his father as pity which he rebukes\n\nSee the difference?\n\nThe introduction: how to start your essay off with a BANG!\n\nPersonally, I always struggled with starting an introduction. The examiners will be reading and marking thousands of essays, so if possible, starting your introduction with something other than Joan Londonâs âThe Golden Ageââ¦ is a great way to make you stand out from the crowd. Having a strong start is essential to pave the way for a clear and concise essay. You could start with a quote/scene from the text! This is not essential, but itâs a great way to mix things up. This is my start:\n\nPerhaps nothing exemplifies the power of love and recognition more than the bond between Albert Sutton and his older sister, Lizzie, in Joan Londonâs âThe Golden Ageâ. Many of Londonâs characters exhibit suffering that requires compassion and support to heal and grow, to distinguish present from past. However, London explores the perspectives of such characters from different aspects of trauma, and emphasise that love and recognition do not always work to heal and mature. Frank Gold, the novelâs resident âsneakyâ boy who adjusts to newfound life in the Golden Age Convalescent Home seeks love as an adult, rather than eliciting sympathy as a supposed victim. Here love and recognition are unsuccessful in amending Frankâs troubles when given from the perspective of an outsider, a judgemental onlooker. In a similar sense, Ida Gold seeks recognition not from Australia, who she views as a âbackwaterâ, but validation in herself after having been ousted from her Hungarian identity. London, however, makes sure to emphasise the impact that Sullivan has on Frank Goldâs life. Sullivan, a boy only a few years older than Frank, seems content with his future, with his fate, despite his sacrifice of rugby and conventional life. Â There is a lacking sense of urgency for love and recognition in Sullivanâs life, rather, it appears that Sullivan accepts his fate, regardless of his fatherâs sympathy or support. Thus, London explores a myriad of ways in which love and recognition may or may not heal wounds inflicted upon individuals.\n\nRemember, there are many other ways you could start your essay.\n\nThe body paragraphs: To TEEL or not to TEEL?\n\nIâm sure youâve heard of TEEL countless times since year 7. Topic sentence, evidence, explanation, link. The truth is that these elements are all very important in a body paragraph. However, following a rigid structure will render your essay bland and repetitive. It is also extremely important to note that you should be using evidence from multiple points in the text, and you should be making sure that your paragraphs are directly answering the question. Write what feels natural to you, and most importantly, donât abuse a thesaurus. If you canât read your essay without rummaging for a dictionary every second sentence, you should rewrite it. Â If vocabulary isnât your strong point (it definitely isnât mine!), focus on clean sentence structure and solid arguments. Thereâs nothing worse than you using a fancy word incorrectly.\n\nDONâT\n\nDonât overuse your thesaurus in an attempt to sound sophisticated, and donât use the same structure for every sentence. For example:\n\nPrematurely in the paperback London makes an allusion to Norm White, the denizen horticulturalist of The Golden Age Convalescent Homeâ¦\n\nThat was an exaggerated example generated by searching for synonyms. As you can see, it sounds silly, and some of the words donât even make sense. I mean, âdenizen horticulturalistââ¦really?\n\nDO\n\nDo mix up your paragraph structure! If vocabulary is your weak point, focus on clean language.\n\nHereâs mine:\n\nEarly in the novel, London makes reference to Norm White, the resident groundskeeper of The Golden Age Convalescent Home. Norm White hands Frank Gold a cigarette, âas if to say a man has the right to smoke in peaceâ. Here, there is a complete disregard for rule and convention, an idea that London emphasises throughout the text. This feature provides a counter-cultural experience for Frank, pushing him to realise that he is a strong human being rather than a mere victim. This is a clear contrast to the âbabyishnessâ of the home, and is used as evidence of true humanity in an era where society judged upon the unconventional. Frank yearns for a traditional Australian life after his trauma in Hungary; âhis own memoryâ¦lodged like an attic in the front part of his brainâ. Hedwiga and Julia Maraiâs caring of him pushed him towards fear and reluctance to trust, yet also pressured him to seek acceptance in a world that ostracises him for his Jewish heritage and polio diagnosis. This here is why Frank desires a mature, adult connection â love that regards him as an equal human being. Frank seeks Elsaâs love and company as she too loathes being reduced to a victim, an object of pity. Frank thereafter uses humour to joke of his wounds; âwe Jews have to be on the lookoutâ. Elsa sees âa look in his eyes that she recognisedâ, thus their bond enables both characters to heal. London alludes that Frank requires love and recognition not from the perspective of a sorrowful onlooker, rather he longs to be recognised as a mature adult.\n\nTo learn more about using the right vocabulary, read 'Why using big words in VCE essays can make you look dumber'.\n\nThe conclusion: closing the deal\n\nI firmly believe in short and sharp conclusions. Your body paragraphs should be thoroughly explaining your paragraphs, so donât include any new information here. A few sentences is enough. Once again, write what feels natural, and what flows well.\n\nDONâT\n\nDonât drag out your conclusion. Short and concise is the key to finishing well.\n\nDO\n\nDo write a sharp finish! Sentence starters such as, âUltimatelyâ¦â or âThus, Londonâ¦â are great.\n\nHereâs mine:\n\nAlthough trauma is often treated with love and compassion, London details different perspectives on this idea. Whilst Frank Gold requires a specific kind of recognition, Ida and Meyer seek validation in themselves and their relationship, whilst Sullivan is at ease with his fate and does not yearn sympathy from his father.\n\nâ\n\nTo learn more about A+ essays, you should also have a read of 10 easy English points you're missing out on.\n\nI'll finish off by giving you an exercise: brainstorm and write up a plan for the essay topic shown in the video below.

Good luck!\n\nThe Golden Age Essay Topic Brainstorm\n\n[Video Transcript]\n\nThe takeaway message for this video will be to utilise minor characters here and there to deepen your argument. London has really developed all her characters to feel three-dimensional and real, so itâs important not to just write about Frank and Elsa when there are so many others worth touching on.\n\nLet's head straight into background information:\n\nJoan LondonâsThe Golden Age is a novel about children recovering from polio in a convalescent home in Perth. She tells the stories of these various children, their families, and their caretakers, focusing on FrankGold and Elsa Briggs, the young protagonists who are just starting to develop romantic feelings for each other. Though they, and many of the other children, have faced much hardship and misfortune, London tells a story of hope and human connection in times of misery.\n\nOn that note, todayâs essay topic is:\n\nThe Golden AgeÂ is primarily a tragic tale of isolation. Discuss.\n\nLetâs break this prompt down and define some keywords. The keywords weâll be looking at first are isolation and tragic. Weâll be defining them quite briefly, but be sure to think about these in terms of how they relate to the novel. In particular, see if any scenes, passages or characters jump to mind.\n\nIsolation is a state of being alone or away from others and can be associated with a sense of powerlessness or insignificance. Tragic can simply just mean sad, depressing and loaded with sorrow or âpathosâ, but there are also literary implications to this word: you mightâve done a tragic Shakespeare play and learned this before, but in general, a tragic story centres on a hero who encounters misfortune, and treats their demise in a serious or solemn way. Note that a good essay will discuss both these terms, and will address not only isolation but also the question of whether or not it is treated tragically.\n\nThe other important word is âprimarilyâ. This word in the prompt suggests that The Golden Age isÂ for the most partÂ about these ideas - for you, that means you should ask yourself how central you think they are, and make a call on whether they are theÂ mostÂ central.\n\nWell, itâs definitely true that elements of isolation and separation do exist in The Golden Age, but these themes are not primarily tragic ideas in the novel -London explores the way in which hope can shine through in times of hardship. In fact, the novel overall has a message of kinship and hope, and this would be the primary thematic focus, as well as the main treatment of otherwise tragic ideas. So how might this look in paragraphs?\n\nParagraph 1: Letâs concede that the novel does evoke sadness through its frequently sombre tone and treatment of isolation\n\nWe see this through characters such as Ida and Meyer, who have been cut off from the world in their escape from their war-torn home, and forced to transition from their landlocked Hungary to an island on the other side of the globe. Their struggle to adjust is evoked through symbols - for instance, black cockatoos, which represent a âhomely, comfortingâ omen to locals, sound âmelancholy [and] harshâ to Ida. In particular, Londonâs solemn characterisation of Ida as constantly âfrowningâ, and as having a âbitter little mouth that usually gripped a cigarette âworks to emphasise her ennui or her dissatisfaction with being cut off from the world. Their homesickness is evoked through this constant longing for home, though sometimes much more literally: Meyer feels that ânever again on this earthâ¦would, he feel at home as he once had.â\n\nSimilarly, the story of Sullivan Backhouse, confined in an âiron lungâ and physically isolated from outside contact, is also primarily tragic. London develops this character and gives him a backstory - he has âjust turned eighteenâ and had been the âprefect [and] captain of the rowing team.â This gives readers an idea of the life he might have had if not for the tragedy of his condition. Even in spite of his âgood-humoured natureâ, his poetry belies the pessimism within - his book, morbidly entitled âon my last day on earthâ, closes with the line âin the end, we are all orphans.â We can thus see how lonely he must have felt when he tragically passed away.\n\nIn this paragraph, weâve considered three different characters, whereas a lot of people writing on this text might just do a character per paragraph, so this is a good way to really show the examiners that youâve considered the full extent of what the book offers. Letâs continue this as we move ontoâ¦\n\nParagraph 2: We disagree, however, since the novel includes various other moods and thematic material - in particular, London explores notions of resolve and hope in times of hardshipÂ\n\nNow, the first character that comes to mind would have to be Elsa - London uses particularly powerful imagery, such as her âtranslucentâ, âgolden waveâ of hair or even her âprofile, outlined in lightâ, to portray her as angelic or elysian. For the children, Elsa evidently represents hope - even in her state of isolation, her âgraceful and dignifiedâ demeanour and her quiet acceptance that polio âwas part of herâ is courageous and worthy of admiration.\n\nMoving onto a minor character who was perhaps inspired by Elsa - the young Ann Lee, who was quite close to Elsa, also has a story which is more inspiring than tragic. When polio first crippled her, she found herself unable to give water to the brumbies in her desert town. As a result, she perseveres, âstep after painstaking stepâ so as to be able to return home and âgive a drink to thirsty creatures.â Her compassion and determination to work against her isolation become the focus of her tale.\n\nParagraph 3: In fact, theÂ novelâs focus is on hope rather than tragedy\n\nA range of other characters demonstrate the power of love and human connection in the face of adversity, and London seems to be focusing on these ideas instead. Plus, itâs not just the children who are brave in the face of tragedy, but ordinary people prove themselves to have the potential for strength and courage. Take Julia Marai and Hedwiga, who hide Frank in their attic during the Nazi invasion of Hungary. Even though their apartment is âon the topâ of the block, and isolated in its height, suspended from the world, they become âprovider[s]â for Frank. London writes that in difficult times, âkindness and unselfishness were as unexpected, as exhilarating, as genius,â and itâs easy to see how these qualities form a counterpoint to the tragedies that permeate the novel, allowing hope to shine through.Â\n\nAnd thatâs the end of the essay! Being able to explore minor characters like we did here is a really good way to show examiners that you have a deeper understanding of a text, that youâve considered it beyond just the main characters on the surface. The Golden Age is a really great one for this because London has done so much with her cast.\n\nEssay topics\n\n1. âBeing close made them stronger.â In The Golden Age, adversities are tempered by camaraderie.

An event in the VCE English context is anything that happens which also generates opinionated media coverageâso, itâs not just an event but it has to be an event that people have published opinions about, and they have to have been published since September 1.\n\nYou might wonder why we donât go to the issue straight away. Hereâs a hypothetical to illustrate: if you asked me to name an issue, the best I could probably come up with off the top of my head is climate change. However, if you asked me to name an event, Iâd pretty easily recall the Australian bushfiresâsomething much more concrete which a) has generated specific and passionate opinions in the media; and b) can easily be linked to a wider issue such as climate change.\n\nSo where do you find an event? If you canât think of a particularly interesting one right away, you could always try Wikipedia. Seriously, Wikipedia very helpfully has pages of things that happened in specific years in specific countries, so â2019 in Australiaâ might well be a starting point. The ABC news archive is also really helpful since you can pick dates or periods of time and see a good mix of news events from then.\n\nI wouldnât underestimate your own memory here either. Maybe you attended the School Strike for Climate and/or you feel vaguely disappointed in the government. Maybe there was something else happening in the news you remember (even though it is often about the environment these days). It doesnât have to be from the news thoughâmaybe there was a movie or TV show you watched recently that you have thoughts about. You could really do a speech on any of these, as long as you suspect there might be recent, opinionated media coverage.\n\nOnly once you have an event should you look for an issue. This will be a specific debate that comes out of the event, and can usually be framed as a âwhether-or-notâ question. The bushfires, for example, might generate debate around whether or not the Australian government is doing enough to combat climate change, whether or not Scott Morrison has fulfilled his duties as Prime Minister, whether or not itâs appropriate to discuss policy already when people are still grieving. All of these issues are going to be more current and more focused than just âclimate changeâ, so pick one that resonates for your speech. In the next couple of sections, Iâll offer you a list of 2019-20 issue-debate breakdowns (i.e. topic ideas!).\n\nMost importantly, choose an event/issue that is interesting for you. Youâre the one whoâs going to deal most intimately with this event/issue - youâll have to research multiple sources, come up with a contention and arguments, write the essay, present the essay - so make it easier for yourself because youâre going to be spending a lot of time completing all these steps. Besides, an inherently interesting topic means that youâll showcase your opinions in an authentic way, which is incredibly important when it comes to presentation time.\n\nStep 2: Filter out the boring events/issues\n\nâYour aim of this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.â Â\n\n-The VCAA English Study Design\n\nNext, youâll need use this test to see whether or not your topic will stand up to the test of being âinterestingâ enough for your audience. My first question to you is: who is your audience?\n\nIs it your classroom and teacher? Is it a handful of teachers? If you donât know, stop right now and find out. Only continue to the next question once youâre 100% certain of your audience.\n\nOnce you know who your audience is, ask yourself: Does this event and issue relate to my audience?\n\nThis question matters because âyour aim of this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.â This means that what you say to your audience and how they respond to your speech matters. Even if your assessor isnât counting exactly how many people are still listening to your speech at the end, everyone knows a powerful speech when theyâre in the presence of one - it hooks the audience from start to end - and an assessor, consciously or subconsciously, cannot deny that the collective attentiveness of the room has an influence on their marking of your Oral Presentation.\n\nThatâs why you should choose a topic that your audience can relate to. This is just my personal opinion, but I donât find a speech on the Adani Coalmine (broad issue = climate change) as interesting and engaging as School Strike For The Climate (broad issue = climate change). Thatâs not to say that Iâm for or against the Adani Coal Mine, but I know that if Iâm speaking to a crowd of 17-18 years olds, the School Strike For The Climate would be a better choice because itâs going to hit a lot closer to home (1) (perhaps some of those in your audience - including yourself - have attended one of those strikes).\n\nTo extrapolate this idea further, I try to avoid topics that have too many unfamiliar words for my audience. For example, I recall one year when one of my students decided to take a stance on pain medications and that they should be restricted to only over-the-counter in pharmacies. Have I lost you already with the âover-the-counterâ? Yeah, I have no doubt that some of you are unfamiliar with that word (donât stress, I didnât know it either when I was in school). On top of this phrase, she used words like âSchedule Aâ, âPharmaceuticals Benefits Schemeâ, âMedicare rebateâ, âopioids', âsubsidisedâ, and other words that arenât part of the usual vocabulary of her audience. Iâd take heed because in order to captivate the audienceâs attention, they need to understand what youâre talking about. As soon as thereâs something they donât understand, it becomes much harder for them to follow your speech, and before you know it, Sarah, the class sleeper is taking her afternoon snooze and the others are struggling to keep their eyes open! Having said all that, if you have an equivalent jargon-heavy topic like pain medications that really does interest you, then go for it. Just bear in mind that youâll need to explain any new vocabulary during your speech to keep your audienceâs attention.\n\nKeen to learn more?

The film follows President Mandelaâs attempt to infuse a deeply divided country with new energy, by supporting the South African rugby teamâs victorious 1995 World Cup Campaign. The unlikely bond formed between President Mandela and Francois Pienarr, the captain of the rugby team, illustrates themes of unity and reconciliation in a divided nation. The film begins with the image of a deeply divided society in 1990, as Mandela is released from 27 years of incarceration. A poignant opening scene sees Mandela drive along a long dirt road that runs between two playing fields, on one side, young black children shout excitedly as Mandela passes. On the other side, immaculately dressed white boys stare vacantly, as their coach proclaims, âThis is the day our country went to the dogs.â This tumultuous period in South African history is of central concern to âInvictusâ, as Eastwood portrays the lingering racial prejudices imbedded in this society. The film portrays the tension between the bitter resentment of black South Africans towards their former oppressors, with the fear and uncertainty of white Afrikaners under Mandelaâs political leadership. Eastwood masterfully depicts the true story of the moment when Nelson Mandela harnessed the power of sports to unite a deeply divided South Africa.\n\nRansom\n\nSet during the Trojan War, one of the most famous events in Greek mythology, David Maloufâs historical fiction âRansomâ seeks to explore the overwhelming destruction caused by war, and the immense power of reconciliation. Drawing on the Iliad, the epic poem by Homer, Malouf focuses on the events of one day and night, in which King Priam of Troy travels to the enemy Greek encampment to plead with the warrior Achilles to release the body of his son, Hector. Maddened by grief at the murder of his friend Patroclus, Achilles desecrates the body of Hector as revenge. Despite Achilles refusal to give up Hectorâs body, Priam is convinced there must be a way of reclaiming the body â of pitting new ways against the old, and forcing the hand of fate. Maloufâs fable reflects the epic themes of the Trojan war, as fatherhood, love, grief and pride are expertly recast for our times.\n\nMalouf and Eastwood both depict societies on the brink: Troy faces annihilation by the Greeks, while South Africa faces an uncertain future as it emerges from the injustices of the apartheid era, both worlds are in dire need of true heroes to bridge the great divide. Together, these two texts echo the significance of hope in the enactment of change. To learn more, head over to our full Ransom Study Guide (covers themes, characters, chapter summaries, quotes and more).\n\nThemes\n\nThe power of shared human experiences\n\nBoth texts are centrally concerned with the significance of the universal experiences of love, loss, grief and hope to unite a divided people. Both Invictus and Ransom explore how societal forces divide people into different, often conflicting groups â whether this be race, history, culture, or war. Each text appeals to the universal experiences that define the human condition, and emphasise the significance of opportunities to cross-cultural divides.\n\nIn âRansomâ, Malouf is centrally concerned with the theme of fatherhood. This concept links the mortal and godly realms, which King Priam straddles over the course of his journey. The relationship between Priam and Somax illustrates this complex theme most clearly. The two men, despite being deeply separated by their class, education and power, share their common familial experiences. Priam confronts the poignancy of their shared experience of losing sons, questioning whether it âmeant the same for him as it did for the driverâ. Malouf thus presents Priam as initially lacking in terms of his understanding, Somaxâs friendship and stories are the catalyst for Priam to engage in deeper, empathetic understanding. Somaxâs trivial yet symbolically significant story about the griddle-cakes represents a moment of anagnorisis for Priam, wherein the shared bond of humanity in fatherhood allows Priam to obtain insight, and progressively grow as a human and as a leader. This incident fuels the journey to appeal to Achilles âman to manâ, Priamâs insight into the power of empathy allows him to appeal to their shared bond as suffering fathers.\n\nJust as Priam goes to Achilles âas a fatherâ, using their common quality, fatherhood, to further understand each other, Mandela, too, emphasises the point that you must âknow [your] enemy before [you] c[an] prevail against himâ and thus he âlearned their language, read their books, their poetryâ. Mandela attempts to unite Black and white South Africans, despite the mutual animosity and distrust fostered by decades of apartheid. Black and White South Africans share almost nothing in common, with significant cultural and societal barriers to their reconciliation, including different dialects. Rugby emerges as the most poignant manifestation of this divide as the White South Africans support their national team, but the black south Africans barrack for the opposing side. The scene wherein Pienarr and Mandela meet over tea is symbolic of this sentiment of fostering unity amongst deep divisions. President Mandela literally hunches over to pour the tea for Pienaar, this inversion of status demonstrates his willingness to reduce his dignity as a superior and speak with Pienarr, and by extension, white south Africans, on an equal level, modelling an example of how race relations in his nation should be carried out. This equality is also symbolised by the passing of the tea to Pienaar, the close up shot where both arms of the individuals are depicted on an equal level reinforces this sense of mutual equality and respect, extolling the virtues of empathy and integrity as a uniting force.\n\nLeadership and Sacrifice\n\nMandela and Priam symbolise how leadership must inevitably entail familial sacrifices. Both leaders self-identify with their nation and people. Priam embodies Troy itself, his body is the âliving mapâ of the kingdom. The âroyal sphereâ he embodies is constrained by customs and tradition, full of symbolic acts that separate him from the mortal world. To an extent, these royal obligations and ritual suffocate Priamâs individuality and he is unable to show his true nature, or connect with his family in the way he would desire to. He regards intimate relationships with his children as âwomenâs talkâ that âunnerves himâ as it is not âhis sphereâ. This articulation of the disassociation of the âroyal sphereâ with natural human bonds of family reveals the secondary role that family and love must take when oneâs role as a leader is paramount. Similarly, Mandela claims âI have a very big family. Forty-two million peopleâ. Unlike Priam, Mandela seeks human connection, predicating his leadership on democratic ideals. This takes a physical and emotional toll, as shown by Mandelaâs collapse in his driveway. The cost of leadership here is evident, as Mandela has effectively sacrificed his family for the good of his nation. His strained relationship with his daughter Zindzi further reinforces this, as she disapproves of Mandela reaching out to Pienarr, likening him to one of the white âpoliceman who forced (her) out of her homeâ, showing the disconnect between father and daughter due to the sacrifices necessitated by Mandelaâs life of leadership, including his 27 year imprisonment.\n\nFatherhood and Masculinity\n\nIn âRansomâ Malouf presents an enclosed, limited and unemotional masculine world, with particularly stringent expectations for menâs behaviour. This is a world characterised by war, wherein the expectations of violent masculinity are paramount. In presenting Achilles inside of âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ, Malouf reveals the constant tension between the emotional, domestic human nature inside Achilles and the hierarchical violent external society that he is expected to abide by, revealing the constricting nature that the society has on defining menâs actions. Malouf uses words like âknottedâ and ârope-likeâ when describing Achillesâ muscles, implying that his conventional great strength, the source of his fearsome reputation, represents a confinement that the society enforces on him and other men. Further, through a degree of compassion, Priam is able to touch the âsore spot whose ache he has long repressedâ in Achilles, a symbol of the emotions that have been supressed by the dominant patriarchal nature of this society.\n\nWhilst the world of âInvictusâ is less overtly masculine and patriarchal, the narrative of the film is primarily focused on the male experiences, with female characters assuming a largely secondary role. Zindziâs strained relationship with her father exemplifies the sacrifices involved in leadership. Whilst Mandela is seen to have sacrificed a close connection with his daughter, this is suggested to be in service of the nation, âI have a big family. Forty two million peopleâ.\n\nCharacter analysis and comparison\n\nCharacter analysis/Comparison\n\nPriam\n\n- aging king of troy\n\n- individuality has been subsumed by the ceremonial functions of his high position\n\n- self-identifies with nation\n\n- life of obligation\n\n- foregoes convention and embraces chance with his proposal to offer ransom for his sonâs body\n\n- becomes more attuned to the natural world\n\n- gains a greater appreciation of his true self as a man, rather than a symbolic figurehead\n\nMandela\n\n- historic figure, symbol of peace\n\n- spent 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government while he was trying to gain civil rights for all south Africans\n\n- tackled institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality\n\n- suffered under apartheid\n\n- pursues reconciliation, prepared to face down calls for retribution\n\n- in his speech to the sports council, he defends the traditions of the people who persecuted him\n\n- interacts easily with people of all social standings\n\n- charismatic, in touch with the people\n\nComparison\n\n- embody essential role that leadership plays in achieving just resolutions to conflict\n\n- sacrifice family for leadership\n\n- illustrate that effective leadership takes a toll on the individual\n\n- exemplify that reconciliation requires unexpected and difficult acts.
