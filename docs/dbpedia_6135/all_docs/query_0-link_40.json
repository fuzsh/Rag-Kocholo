        "text": "Chapter 1[]\n\nPM: Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the Arrivals Gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion’s starting makes out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified, or newsworthy - but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. Before the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate and revenge - they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.'\n\nLOVE ACTUALLY\n\nBilly, the old rocker:\n\n\"I feel it in my fingers\"\n\n\"I feel it in my toes\"\n\n\"Feel it in my toes, yeah\"\n\n\"Love is all around me\"\n\n\"And so the...\"\n\nJOE: I'm afraid you did it again, Bill.\n\nBILLY: It's just I know the old version so well, you know.\n\nJOE: Well, we all do - that's why we're making the new version.\n\nBILLY: Right, OK, let's go.\n\n\"I feel it in my fingers\"\n\n\"In my fingers\n\n\"I feel it in my toes\n\n\"Feel it in my toes, yeah\n\n\"Love is all ar...\"\n\nOh, fuck, wank, bugger, shitting, arse, head, and hole. Start again.\n\n\"I feel it in my fingers\n\n\"In my fingers\n\n\"I feel it in my toes.\n\n\"Feel it in my toes, yeah\n\nChristmas is all around me\n\n\"And so the feeling grows.\n\n\"It's written in the wind,\n\nIt's everywhere I go.\n\n\"So if you really love Christmas,\n\n\"Come on and let it snow...”\n\nThis is shit, isn't it?\n\nJOE: Yup, solid gold shit, maestro.\n\nChapter 2[]\n\nJamie’s house\n\nJAMIE: God, I'm so late.\n\nKATYA: It's just round the corner, you'll make it.\n\nJAMIE: You sure you don't mind me going without you?\n\nKATYA: No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.\n\nJAMIE I love you.\n\nKATYA: I know.\n\nJAMIE: I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting.\n\nKATYA: I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it.\n\nJAMIE: Right. Did I mention that I love you?\n\nKATYA: Yes, you did. Get out, loser.\n\nDaniel’s house\n\nDANIEL: Karen, it's me again. Sorry, I literally don't have anyone else to talk to.\n\nKAREN: Absolutely. Horrible moment right now though - can I call back?\n\nDANIEL: Of course.\n\nKAREN: Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned that your wife just died.\n\nDANIEL: Understood. Bugger off and call me later.\n\nKaren’s house\n\nKAREN: So what's this big news?\n\nDAISY: We've been given our parts in the nativity play and I'm the lobster.\n\nKAREN: The lobster?\n\nDAISY: Yeah.\n\nKAREN: In the Nativity play?\n\nDAISY: Yeah. First Lobster.\n\nKAREN: There was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus?\n\nDAISY:Duh.\n\nFAIRTRADE OFFICE\n\nCOLIN: Best sandwiches in Britain. Try my lovely nuts? Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady. Morning, my future wife.\n\nFILM STUDIO\n\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY: OK, you can stop there. Thanks.\n\nJOHN: By the way, he introduced me as John but everyone calls me Jack.\n\nJUDY: Oh, fine - nice to meet you, Jack. He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.\n\nJOHN: Great, Just Judy!\n\nCHURCH\n\nPETER: No surprises?\n\nMARK: No surprises.\n\nPETER: Not like the stag night?\n\nMARK: Unlike the stag night.\n\nPETER: You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?\n\nMARK: I do.\n\nPETER: And it would've been much better if they'd not turned out to be men?\n\nMARK: That is true. Good luck, kiddo.\n\nDOWNING STREET\n\nANNIE: Welcome, Prime Minister.\n\nPM: I must work on my wave. How are you?\n\nANNIE: How are you feeling?\n\nPM: Cool. Powerful.\n\nANNIE: Would you like to meet your household staff?\n\nPM: Yes, I would like that very much indeed. Anything to put off actually running the country.\n\nANNIE: This is Terence. He's in charge.\n\nTERENCE: Good morning, sir.\n\nPM: Good morning. I had an uncle called Terence -hated him - I think he was a pervert - but I very much like the look of you.\n\nANNIE: This is Pat. PM: Hello, Pat.\n\nPAT: Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.\n\nPM: Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot - no nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.\n\nANNIE: And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.\n\nPM: Hello, Natalie.\n\nNATALIE: Hello, David. I mean, sir. Shit, I can't believe I just said that. And now I've gone and said \"shit\". Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.\n\nPM: That’s fine...You could've said \"fuck\" and we'd have been in real trouble.\n\nNATALIE: Thank you, sir. I did have an awful premonition I was going to fuck up on my first day...oh, piss it!\n\nANNIE: Right, I'll get my things and then let's fix the country, shall we?\n\nPM: Yeah, I can't see why not. That is so inconvenient.\n\nChapter 3[]\n\nCHURCH DAY\n\nVICAR: In the presence of God, Peter and Juliet have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other. They declared their marriage by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.\n\nPETER: And you resisted the temptation for surprises.\n\nMARK: Yeah, I'm mature now.\n\n\"Love, love, love\n\n\"Love, love, love\n\n\"Love, love, love...\"\n\nJULIET: Did you do this?\n\nPETER: Er -no.\n\n\"Love, love, love, love\n\n\"There's nothing you can do that can't be done\"\n\nOh, it...\n\n\"There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung\n\n\"There's nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game\n\n\"It's easy \"All you need is love \"All you need is love \"All you need is love, love \"Love is all you need...\"\n\nJAMIE’S HOUSE\n\nJAMIE: Hello! What the hell are you doing here?\n\nCHRIS: Oh, I just popped over to borrow some old CDs.\n\nJAMIE: The lady of the house let you in, did she?\n\nCHRIS: Yeah.\n\nJAMIE: Lovely, obliging girl. I thought I'd pop back before the reception, see if she was better. Listen, I've been thinking. I think perhaps we ought to take Mum out for her birthday on Friday. What do you think? I just feel we've been bad sons this year.\n\nCHRIS: Sounds fine. A bit, you know, boring, but fine.\n\nKATYA: Hurry up, big boy! I'm naked and I want you at least twice before Jamie gets home.\n\nRECEPTION HALL\n\nCOLIN: Delicious delicacy?\n\nMARK: No, thanks.\n\nCOLIN: Taste explosion? Food?\n\nNANCY: No, thanks.\n\nCOLIN: Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it? Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh. Tastes like it, too. I'm Colin, by the way.\n\nNANCY: I'm Nancy.\n\nCOLIN: Wicked. And what do you do, Nancy?\n\nNANCY: I'm a cook.\n\nCOLIN: Ever do weddings?\n\nNANCY: Yes, I do.\n\nCOLIN: They should've asked you to do this one.\n\nNANCY: They did.\n\nCOLIN: God, I wish you hadn't turned it down.\n\nNANCY: I didn't.\n\nCOLIN: Right.\n\nRECEPTION KITCHEN\n\nCOLIN: I've worked out why I can't find true love.\n\nTONY: Why is that?\n\nCOLIN: It’s English girls. They're stuck up, you see. And I am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler, game for a laugh. Like American girls. So I should just go to America! I'd get a girlfriend there instantly. What do you think?\n\nTONY: I think it's crap, Colin.\n\nCOLIN: No, that's where you're wrong. American girls would seriously dig me with my cute British accent.\n\nTONY: You don't have a cute British accent.\n\nCOLIN: Yes, I do! I'm going to America.\n\nTONY: Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole, and you must accept it.\n\nCOLIN: Never. I am Colin, God of Sex. I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.\n\nFILM STUDIO\n\nJOHN: The traffic today was just...\n\nJUDY: Oh, unbelievable.\n\nTONY: Judy, could you take your top off this time - lighting and camera need to know when we're actually going to see the nipples and when we're not.\n\nJUDY: Yes, okay, right. At least it's nice and warm in here.\n\nJOHN: Absolutely. Isn’t always the case. I was standing in for Brad Pitt once on Seven Years In Tibet...bloody freezing...\n\nTONY: Sorry, guys, time's pretty tight and we have to get the actors in.\n\nJUDY: Fine.\n\nJOHN: I promise I won't look.\n\nTONY: And Jerry says, if you could just put your hands on her breasts?\n\nJOHN: OK, right, okay. Is that all right?\n\nJUDY: Yes, yeah – fine.\n\nJOHN: I'll warm them up!\n\nTONY: And massage them, please.\n\nJOHN: Right. It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it? Total gridlock this morning.\n\nChapter 4[]\n\nCHURCH DAY\n\nDANIEL: Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment. Some of her requests, for instance, that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral, I was confident she expected me to ignore. But others she was pretty damn clear about. When she first mentioned what's about to happen, I said, \"Over my dead body.\" And she said, \"No, Daniel, over mine.\" And as usual, my darling girl...and Sam's darling mum was right. So she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but, inevitably, ever so coolly, through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers...\n\n\"Bye bye baby, baby goodbye\n\n\"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye\n\n\"Bye bye baby\n\n\"Don't make me cry\n\n\"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye\n\n\"You're the one girl in town I'd marry\n\n\"Girl I'd marry you now if I were free\n\n\"I wish it could be\n\n\"I could love you but why begin it?\n\n\"Cos there ain't any future in it\n\n\"She's got me but I'm not free so...\"\n\n\"Bye bye baby, baby goodbye\n\n\"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye\n\n\"Bye bye baby, don't make me cry\n\n\"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye\n\n\"Wish I never had known you...\"\n\nRECEPTION HALL\n\nSARAH: Do you love him?\n\nMARK: WHO?, what?\n\nSARAH: No, l-I just thought I'd ask the blunt question in case it was the right question and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you so you’d never been able to talk about it even though you might have wanted to...\n\nMARK: No. No. No is the answer. No, absolutely not.\n\nSARAH: So, that’s a no then?\n\nMARK: Yes. This DJ, what do you reckon? The worst in history?\n\nSARAH: Probably. I think it all hangs on the next song.\n\nDJ: Now here's one for the lovers. That's quite a few of you, I shouldn't be surprised and a half.\n\nMARK: He's done it, it's official.\n\nSARAH: Worst DJ in the world.\n\nHARRY’S OFFICE\n\nMIA: Sarah's waiting for you.\n\nHARRY: Oh, yes, of course, great, er, good, good. How you doing, Mia? You settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?\n\nMIA: Absolutely. SARAH: Hi Harry HARRY: Now, switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here? SARAH: Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, what, two hours? HARRY: And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer? SARAH: Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes. HARRY: I thought as much. SARAH: Do you think everybody knows? HARRY: Yes. SARAH: Do you think Karl knows? HARRY: Yes. SARAH: Oh, that is... that is bad news. HARRY: I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it. SARAH: Like what? HARRY: Invite him out for a drink - then after twenty minutes casually drop into conversation the fact that you’d like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies. SARAH: You know that? HARRY: Yes. And so does Karl. Think about it, for all our sakes. It's Christmas. SARAH: Certainly. Excellent. Will do. Thanks, boss. KARL: Hi, Sarah. SARAH: Hi, Karl. SARAH: Babe. Absolutely, fire away. Mia, could you turn that down? What is that?\n\nRADIO STATION\n\nDJ: And that was the Christmas effort from the once great Billy Mack. Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen. I can safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the worst record I've heard this century...Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be a guest on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes' time. Welcome back, Bill.\n\nMIKE: So, Billy, welcome back to the airwaves. New Christmas single, cover of Love Is All Around.\n\nBILLY: Except we've changed the word \"love\" to \"Christmas\".\n\nMIKE: Yes, is that an important message to you, Bill?\n\nBILLY: Not really, Mike. Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.\n\nMIKE: And that's not you?\n\nBILLY: That's not me, Michael. When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish and now I'm left with no one, wrinkled and alone.\n\nMIKE: Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.\n\nBILLY: For what?\n\nMIKE: For actually giving a real answer to a question. Doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.\n\nBILLY: Ask me anything you like. I'll tell you the truth.\n\nMIKE: Best shag you ever had?\n\nBILLY: Britney Spears. No, only kidding! She was rubbish.\n\nMIKE: OK, here's one. How do you think the new record compares to your old, classic stuff? BILLY: Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do the record's crap. But...wouldn't it be great if number one this Christmas wasn't some smug teenager but an old ex-heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price? All those young posters, come Christmas day, they’ll be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager Joe - ugliest man in the world, - fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off. So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, like your Uncle Billy does, buy my festering turd of a record and particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line... MIKE: I think you're referring to \"If you really love Christmas...\" BILLY: \"Come on and let it snow.\" Ouch. MIKE: So, here it is one more time, the dark horse for this year's Christmas number one, Christmas Is All Around. Thank you, Billy. After this, the news - is the new prime minister in trouble already?\n\nChapter 5[]\n\nDOWNING STREET\n\nPM: OK. What's next? ALEX: The President's visit. PM: Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play. Alex? ALEX: There's a strong feeling in the Party we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from pillar to post like the last government. JEREMY: Here, here. This is our first really important test, let's take a stand. PM: Right. Right. I understand that but I have decided...not to. Not this time. We will of course try to be clever, but let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world. I'm not going to act like a petulant child.\n\nPM: Right – now who do you have to screw around here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit? Right.\n\nPM’S OFFICE\n\nPM: Yup, come in. NATALIE: These have just come through from the Treasury...and these are for you. PM: Excellent. Thanks a lot. NATALIE: I was hoping you'd win, not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke, just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate. PM: Thanks very much. Thanks... Natalie. Thinking: God, come on, get a grip. You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.\n\nFILM STUDIO\n\nJOHN: So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?\n\nJUDY: Oh, I like him. I can't understand why he's not married, though.\n\nJOHN: You know the type - married to his job. Either that or gay as a picnic basket.\n\nTONY: Judy, if you could just lower the nipples and cheat them a bit to the left?\n\nJOHN: I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure, it's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.\n\nJUDY: Thank you! Ditto.\n\nTONY: And the move again, please, Judy.\n\nBOTH: Oh, God, sorry.\n\nCOLIN’S VAN\n\nCOLIN: Exciting news!\n\nTONY: What?\n\nCOLIN: I've bought a ticket to the States. I'm off in three weeks.\n\nTONY: No.\n\nCOLIN: Yes! To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.\n\nTONY: No!\n\nCOLIN: Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!\n\nTONY: No, Col! There are a few babes in America, I grant you, but they're already going out with rich, attractive guys.\n\nCOLIN: Nah, Tone, you're just jealous. You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me than the whole of the United Kingdom.\n\nTONY: That is total bollocks. You've actually gone mad now.\n\nCOLIN: No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William...without the weird family. TONY: No, Colin, no! COLIN: Yes! TONY: Nyet!\n\nCOLIN: Da!\n\nTONY: Nein!\n\nCOLIN: Ja, darling!\n\nHARRY’S OFFICE\n\nHARRY: Right, the Christmas party. Not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise.\n\nMIA: Tell me.\n\nHARRY: It's basic, really. Find a venue, over-order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.\n\nMIA: Wives and family and stuff?\n\nHARRY: Yeah. I mean, not children. But wives and girlfriends, et cetera. Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend you’ll be bringing, have you?\n\nMIA: No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.\n\nHARRY: Really? Right.\n\nDANIEL’S HOUSE\n\nDANIEL: He now spends all the time in his room. I mean, he'll be up there now.\n\nKAREN: That's not unusual. My horrid son Bernard stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.\n\nDANIEL: Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time. I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know? I mean, clearly it's about his mum, but Christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.\n\nKAREN: At the age of 11?\n\nDANIEL: Well, maybe not his eyeballs, maybe just his veins.\n\nDANIEL: The problem is, it was his mum who always used to talk to him and I don’t know... the whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter, like it never did before. KAREN: Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time. Just be patient. And maybe check the room for needles. DANIEL: And then when he sometimes does come out, it's obvious he's been crying. It was such a ridiculous waste. And if it's now going to ruin Sam's life as well...I just don't know. KAREN: Get a grip. People hate sissies. No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time. DANIEL: Yeah. Absolutely. Helpful.\n\nLONDON BENCH\n\nDANIEL: So, what's the problem, Sammy-o? Is it just Mum or is it something else? Maybe...school? Are you being bullied? Or is it something worse? Can you give me any clues at all?\n\nSAM: You really want to know?\n\nDANIEL: I really want to know.\n\nSAM: Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?\n\nDANIEL: Even if that's the case.\n\nSAM: Okay. Well truth is, actually...I'm in love.\n\nDANIEL: Sorry?\n\nSAM: I know I should be thinking about Mum all the time and I am but the truth is I'm in love and I was before she died and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nDANIEL: Aren't you a bit young to be in love?\n\nSAM: No.\n\nDANIEL: Okay, right. Well I'm a little relieved.\n\nSAM: Why?\n\nDANIEL: Because I thought it'd be something worse.\n\nSAM: Worse than the total agony of being in love?\n\nDANIEL: Ahmm...No, you're right. Total agony.\n\nChapter 6[]\n\nFAIRTRADE OFFICE\n\nKARL: Night, Sarah. SARAH: Night, Karl. Yup, absolutely. Free as a bird. Fire away.\n\nFARMHOUSE IN FRANCE\n\nJAMIE: Alone again. Naturally.\n\nDOWNING STREET\n\nPM: Natalie. NATALIE: Sir. PM: Thanks. Natalie. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about us working in such close proximity every day and me knowing so little about you, it seems élitist and wrong. NATALIE: Well, there's not much to know. PM: Where do you live, for instance? NATALIE: Wandsworth. The dodgy end. PM: My sister lives in Wandsworth. So which exactly is the dodgy end? NATALIE: At the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head. PM: Right, yes. that is dodgy and you live with your husband? Boyfriend, three illegitimate but charming children? – NATALIE: No, I've just split up with my boyfriend, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while. PM: Oh. I’m sorry. NATALIE: No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him. He said I was getting fat. PM: I beg your pardon? NATALIE: He said no one's going to fancy a girl with thighs the size of big tree trunks. Not a nice guy, actually, in the end. PM: Right...You know, being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered. NATALIE: Thank you, sir. I'll think about it. PM: Do - the SAS are absolutely charming - ruthless, trained killers are just a phone call away. PM: Oh, God. Did you have this kind of problem? Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.\n\nDANIEL’S LIVING ROOM\n\nDANIEL: We can definitely crack this. Remember, I was a kid once, too. So, come on, it's someone at school. Right? SAM: Yup. DANIEL: And what does she/he, feel about you? SAM: SHE doesn't even know my name. And even if she did, she'd despise me. She's the coolest girl in school and everyone worships her because she's heaven. DANIEL: Good. Good. Well, basically...you're fucked, aren't you?\n\nTV STUDIO\n\nDEC: Hi there and welcome back. So, Billy three weeks till Christmas, and it looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue. BILLY:Yes, I saw them on the show last week. They weren't very nice about my record. ANT: No. Little scamps.\n\nBILLY: Yeah-but very, very talented musicians. DEC: Billy, I understand you've got a prize for our competition winners. BILLY: Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's a personalised felt-tip pen. ANT: Oh, great. BILLY: It's brilliant. It even writes on glass. So if you've got a framed picture, like, for instance, this one… of Blue you can just write on it. DEC: Er, a lot of kids watching, BILLY: Oh, yeah. Hiya, kids-here's an important message from your Uncle Bill: don't buy drugs-become a pop star and they give you them for free. ANT: And I do believe it's a commercial break. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.\n\n40. ART GALLERY? PETER’S OFFICE/JULIET’S OFFICE\n\n\"All I want for Christmas is you\" GIRL- Look at him! Eurh! - Just a minute.\n\nMARK: Actually, they're not funny. They're art. (On the phone) OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place. PETER: Great…but for now I've got Juliet on the other line. Can I patch you through? She wants to ask you a favour. MARK: OK, fine. PETER: Thanks and, er, be nice. MARK: I’m always nice. PETER: You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.' MARK: I’m always... JULIET: Mark? ' MARK: Hi. How was the honeymoon? JULIET: It was great. Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff. MARK: So, what can I do for you? JULIET: It's only a tiny favour. I've just tried the wedding video and it's a disaster. 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.' MARK: I'm sorry. JULIET: I remember you filming a lot and I wondered if I could look at it. MARK: Oh,no-look-to be honest, I didn't really... JULIET: Please. All I want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise. MARK: I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it, so don't get any hopes up. Must go.'\n\nChapter 7[]\n\n41 INT.

Pathetic, isn't it? Just never been able to tie a girl down.\n\nNot sure that politics and dating go together.\n\nPRESIDENT: Really?

Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?I fear that this has become a bad relationship. A relationship based on the President taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm...\n\nBritain. We may be a small country but we're a great one, too.The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles,Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot, David Beckham's left foot, come to that. And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend.And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward, I will be prepared to be much stronger.\n\nAnd the President should be prepared for that.\n\nPRESS PEOPLE: Mr President!
