        "text": "April Walsh\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nLegendary Women\n\n·\n\n10 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 3, 2016\n\n--\n\nLet me tell you about a show. A show that passed The Bechdel Test before it existed. A show that took The Smurfette Principle and upended it. A show that gave us a pair of ride-or-die besties who would do anything to support each other.\n\nThey are also terrible, vain, self-serving, dissolute people, who are mostly supporting each other in destructive habits and bad behavior. But that’s pretty much why we watched and why we want more even 24 years later. It’s not even love-to-hate. It’s just love, maybe with a side of disdain and superiority and a little self-recognition. We are better than Patsy and Edina, but never by much. That’s pretty much the charm of this show, like a ribald aunt with wicked humor and a “there, but for the grace of God, go I” vibe. A funhouse mirror reflection of women foolishly struggling with the impossible task of being young, thin, on-trend, and flawless forever. We laugh. We may feel a bit guilty for laughing, and even a little sad for them and for us, but we still laugh.\n\nHonestly, what I really want is for this movie to have happened ten years ago and another full season of the show right about now, but I love this world and every single person in it enough to take whatever I am given. And, unlike X-Files, this is a 90s property that knows what its audience wants. The more times change, as celebrity culture and fashion get sillier and more self-absorbed, the more we need to check in with these two and see what they make of it.\n\nAs we expect, they are still haplessly, cluelessly chasing trends and failing upwards. In fact, everything in this movie is kind of what we expect and everyone is just as we left them. That’s not a criticism, though. Far from it.\n\nThe thing about Ab Fab is that it’s not a premise that tires out, at least for me. The older Patsy and Edina are, the more fun it is to see them struggle to be forever 29 and prove they can run with the cool kids. Well, that’s always been more Eddy’s crisis. Patsy is along for the ride, but she’s always been pretty secure in her worth and untouched by criticism or the changing world.\n\nPatsy is a flawless beehive and a Chanel suit, both of which are sure to come back into vogue again any day now and she will gladly wait. Eddy is whatever flashy, colorful thing makes her stand out, a shout to anyone looking that she gets it, whatever it is, that she matters. I can relate to both of them (I sing songs from the 40s and I have a thing for red accessories. I’m a little desperate to be seen and appreciated, too!). I like seeing them again, whatever form it takes. Let’s get into it. I will try not to spoil much…\n\nThe Plot:\n\nEddy‘s credit cards are “all broken” and she has lost the financial support of her exes and the belief that she is relevant and interesting, so she is desperate to get Kate Moss as a client for her PR firm (which still only boasts Lulu, Baby Spice, a boutique Vodka, and Pop Specs). Patsy is there to help, as she always needs Eddy’s money and companionship to keep herself in Bolli-Stoli cocktails and good times. Of course, Patsy has no problem with being the breadwinner in their strange marriage… by marrying. I won’t spoil the hows, but it’s nice to know that Patsy would also let Eddy sponge off her without hesitation.\n\nOf course, Eddy messes everything up as usual and it looks like she’s sent Kate Moss to a watery grave. The world (which, in this universe, loves Kate Moss with a Princess Diana level intensity) reviles her, so they escape to Cannes…\n\nThe Bad…\n\nThere was a bit of a Twitter tempest last December when Margaret Cho accused the film of yellowface when it was revealed that very tiny Scottish person Janette Tough of The Crankies was playing a fashion designer named Huki Muki.\n\nTough does speak in the film, and in her heavy Glasgow accent. “It was just a silly little joke — in no way are we pretending she is Japanese,” Saunders told the Guardian. “The whole film is about people being what they’re not.” So I suppose it is more a satire of the fashion industry’s pretension and cultural appropriation than actual yellowface. Still, with that being the case, it didn’t land. It needed more lampshading, more lines from Janette, or just something that said “Hey, we’re not being racist.” You have to squint to see that it isn’t yellowface, basically. What it looks like, to the casual moviegoer, is a sight gag using Janette’s height and unique jaw line and the name Huki Muki for giggles. It also just plain wasn’t funny enough to be worth the outrage it caused.\n\nThen again, this is a film that gives us jokes about using fetal blood for facial rejuvenation and Rebel Wilson as the worst flight attendant since Total Bastard Airlines, complaining about Patsy’s bad behavior, and how much she hates that she has to be nice to transgendered people these days. Patsy’s likeness to a drag queen (and one phase where she lived as a man) is still a running gag. I mean, there is plenty of outrage to go around if you want some more, but this show has always been enough of a darling of the gay and the drag community to get away with certain things.\n\nThere was the “you work in a shop” joke that I wish had been worded differently so as not to recycle old material. Then again, some of the recycling worked as I was happy to hear Eddy singing her original song again.\n\nThe Middling…\n\nThis is definitely not a movie for non-fans. Much like the show, when it comes back for specials or seasons after a few years away, it just plops you into the world without much explanation of who these people are and what their relationships have been up to now. As a long time fan, I’m fine with them getting right into the action. But a casual movie-goer might find the dynamics hard to get into.\n\nThe sad thing is that, as the world has gotten more vain and ridiculous, the less shocking their antics are. I mean, we live in a world where we have Real Housewives in multiple cities and Pimp Mama Kris (TM Dlisted) masterminding her Jenner/Kardashian spawn into thirstier, meme-ier, grosser territory every day. I could definitely see these whippersnappers feeling like they’ve seen it all and worse, like Patsy and Eddy are nothing special. I wish I could tell them how edgy and ahead-of-its-time this was back in my day!\n\nSo many tiny dips into things I wanted explored more. Edina may still not understand Twitter (or being “trollied”), but Patsy has fully embraced Tinder. But it’s just a few minutes. I’d love an entire episode dedicated to the social media and app-based activity of every character in this world. The world has changed so much since we last met!\n\nEmma Bunton and Lulu were put to good enough use, mostly as foils. I also enjoyed their implied rivalry with that attention hungry La Roux!\n\nBesides them, I could take or leave most of the celeb cameos… except for Joan Collins and Dame Edna. Those were priceless seconds!\n\nThe Good…\n\nJoanna Lumley pretty much steals every scene she’s in, but so sneakily. I can’t even pinpoint how, it’s something subtle in her delivery, just the odd quirk of the brow or a sneer and she had me rolling.\n\nI said before that I take comfort in the familiarity and I stand by it. I like seeing these people as I left them. Bubble is still a complete idiot with worse fashion sense than even Eddy and has isolated moments of brilliance. Gran is still dotty and so cheerfully critical that no one is offended. Saffy is still long-suffering and desperate for Eddy to be a more responsible mother, and now grandmother…\n\nThe one surprise was Lola, mostly since we haven’t seen her since she was in diapers and she’s now a preteen. I was wondering where they would go with her — whether she would have inherited Saffy’s severity or Eddy’s partying ways. They seemed to split the difference, with her sort of disapproving of all the high fashion silliness and hijinks in theory, but also a little bit curious about this more adventurous, glam life her grandmother seems to lead. Throughout the film, Eddy and Patsy have her smoking, drinking, and driving (not all at once) and it’s awful, but kind of a kick to watch. Not gonna lie, I’d love to see a new season with Eddy’s further efforts to corrupt Lola and Saffron’s harried efforts to rein it in.\n\nAs for the old recurring characters, I loved checking in with them, even if it was for just a moment. Kathy Burke’s Magda is still callous and terse and better-than-you. Fleur and Catriona are still daffy. Claudia Bing is still insufferable and scheming. Llewella Gideon’s nasty nurse turned beautician is still harping on Eddy’s weight (even though she has surpassed Eddy by now, which they lampshade heavily). Marshall and Bo are still changing identities like clothing — he is transgender now (possibly more for Bo’s gratification than his as she has to cover his ears over any mention of them “cutting it off”) and Bo now sincerely believes she is black. But my favorite was Dawn French’s morning show host, mostly because… Dawn French. It’s amazing what that woman can do with a quirk of the lip and a condescending tone.\n\nSaffy has a surprisingly poignant and intimate karaoke moment in a club full of drag queens (several of whom must take fashion cues from Patsy, as we all should).\n\nJulia Sawalha’s ability to play everything completely straight with the chaos around her is as wonderful as always. There are lines where she brings a depth that almost pulls you out of the silliness and glitz and into the real world, only for her to lose it hilariously. Her struggle to say the F-word, though still managing to get it out multiple times, was adorable.\n\nThe interaction between Saffy and Eddy is a bit softer. After all these years, I think Saffy has accepted her lot of cleaning up Eddy’s messes, but I like to see her, once in a while, get a little appreciation and love back… even if Eddy undoes it in the next second.\n\nI enjoyed Chris Colfer’s fanboy/stylist Christopher.\n\nOther thoughts…\n\nThe older ladies get a party where they dance with each other, show off their floaty scarves and low-heeled sandals (with visible pantyhose, of course), and settle for low-rent impersonator entertainment and light gambling. Not that they mind.\n\nBut their male counterparts with their false teeth and bad suits are are feted poolside with EDM and Eastern European models barely out of their teens. Sadly, I can’t even say this is inaccurate in its treatment of aging men as opposed to aging women… or even men and women of all ages.\n\nThere’s a moment reminiscent of “Send In The Clowns” and another that gives me Some Like It Hot vibes.\n\nIt’s a B+ teetering drunkenly toward A- for me.\n\nI would still prefer another season, but if this is the last we see of Ab Fab, I can make my peace with it. I don’t know if this movie will please everyone or even all fans, but I enjoyed it. It’s not better than the very best episodes, but it’s true to the characters and took me on a fun and wicked ride. Also, my theater served booze. That might have helped.\n\nIf you want to know what I think about other nerdy things, you can find it all on my page.\n\n*****\n\nAll images from Ab Fab are property of BBC One and Saunders and French Productions and courtesy of many nice Tumblr people.\n\nWant to help us support a worthy cause with Casa Ruby, D.C.?
