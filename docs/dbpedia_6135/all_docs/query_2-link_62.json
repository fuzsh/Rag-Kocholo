        "text": "Focussing on a veteran stunt double, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's new film features some truly spectacular action sequences – and makes an important case for the people who perform such feats to be finally recognised as true artists.\n\nWhen it comes to the unsung heroes of movie-making, no one can lay claim to the title quite as much as stunt people – they are the film professionals who literally take the hits so that actors don't have to, even as their faces are unseen and their names unrecognised by all but a tiny few. They've been performing incredible feats on film since the early 1900s. Edwin S Porter's 1903 silent film The Great Train Robbery saw Frank Hanaway hired as a bandit to fall off a horse in a chase scene, one of the first appearances of a stuntman. Now, more than a century later, where there is an over-reliance on CGI and VFX to create spectacular scenes in the action genre, films like The Fall Guy – that showcase more practical stunt solutions – feel like exciting outliers.\n\nA loose adaptation of the 1980s TV series of the same name, the action-comedy centres on Ryan Gosling's Colt Seavers, a veteran stunt double who after experiencing a traumatic workplace mishap, decides to leave the industry – only to be persuaded to get back into business, 18 months on, when he is hired to work on a new sci-fi blockbuster. Making things more complicated, it happens to be directed by Emily Blunt's Jody – the ex he loves but whom he ghosted when he quit. With a mystery thriller plot involving the disappearance of the film's leading man thrown in, it's a charming and funny film that showcases the thrilling power of well-executed stunt sequences and just what it takes to achieve them.\n\nA rare celebration of an artform\n\n\"This is a love letter to the stunt community,\" stunt driver Logan Holladay tells the BBC. Stunt double Ben Jenkin adds: \"We wanted to incorporate every aspect of stunts in this movie, whether that be rolling a car, doing a high fall, fights, fire burns, massive winch moves, rigging, all of this stuff.\" It's certainly a film close to the hearts of many people working on it, in particular stuntman-turned-director David Leitch, who doubled for Brad Pitt on several films, and has since helmed the acclaimed, action-packed features John Wick (2014), Atomic Blonde (2017) and Deadpool 2 (2018). \"It was fun to direct a movie with direct experience of the subject matter,\" Leitch tells the BBC. \"Directing John Wick, for example, I've never been a ruthless assassin, but a stunt performer, I have [been]. Living on sets for my entire adult life, I know what that's like, so getting into the world of behind-the-scenes movie-making was fun.\"\n\nIt's strange when you get to set, and the stunt performers put themselves in harm's way for you. They're also playing your character, are also actors, yet in their case they disappear into the shadows – Ryan Gosling\n\nGosling, who has played stunt drivers in Drive (2011) and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012), believes stunts are \"a huge part of why we love film in general\", and he relished the opportunity to go deeper into how a stuntman ticks. \"[With those other films] I never felt like I got to scratch the surface of what the real life of a stunt performer is, so to do this film with David, who understands this more deeply than anyone, was so exciting,\" he tells the BBC. Shooting the film, Gosling had four stunt doubles, including Holladay and Jenkin, who each contributed a specific skill set to make Gosling’s character, Colt, a stunt performer of remarkable versatility.\n\n\"It's strange when you get to set, and they put themselves in harm's way for you. They're also playing your character, are also actors and members of SAG [Screen Actors Guild], yet in their case they disappear into the shadows,\" Gosling adds. \"The thing that this movie does well, which feels fresh, is not just acknowledging the physical hits that some performers take, but the emotional ones too. What's that like when your job is to take all the risks but you hide your face and get none of the credit?\"\n\nSo what makes a good stunt? Screenwriter Drew Pearce – whose action credits include Iron Man 3 (2013), Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019), and his 2018 directorial debut Hotel Artemis – says a good stunt needs narrative substance as much as style to be successful. \"An action sequence should work like a song in a musical,\" he explains. \"The rule should be that if the characters, the story or the plot doesn't change from the beginning to the end of the action sequence, then it doesn't need to be there.\"\n\nHe also believes that it is not the size or length of a sequence that makes it memorable. \"I think [Stanley] Kubrick said you don't remember movies for plot or story or even character, you remember them for moments, \" he explains. \"If you think about Mission Impossible: Fallout, a movie with incredible stunts that shot for a year and a half, the most memorable moment in that movie – and I mean this as the highest praise – is when Henry Cavill comes out of a toilet cubicle and reloads his arms. It's an indelible image.\"\n\nPushing the boundaries\n\nWhile The Fall Guy has many stunt scenes – \"enough for five movies\", says Holladay – a few key ones push the boundaries of the art form forward, while paying homage to the past. Before writing the script, Pearce put together a list of the biggest stunts in cinema history as inspiration for what Leitch, stunt designer Chris O'Hara and their 100-strong stunt department could achieve. That included stunt performer Dar Robinson’s 220ft fall from a skyscraper in the 1981 Burt Reynolds thriller Sharkey’s Machine, and the celebrated carriage-drag stunt in 1939 the 1939 film Stagecoach, performed by Yakima Canutt, which saw him drop between six galloping horses pulling a stagecoach. He then grabs on to the harness, keeping the front two steeds together (metal bars had been attached to the harness to help with this), and is dragged along with his feet in the dirt for a few seconds before letting go, lying flat so the stagecoach is pulled over him without touching.\n\nBoth Robinson and Canutt are considered pioneers in the field. Robinson (who worked on The Fall Guy TV show) invented an early version of the \"decelerator\" – a dragline cable or wire that's attached to a performer when they are jumping from a high place, and slows them down such that a safety airbag is not needed. Meanwhile Canutt developed special rigging and harnesses to improve the safety of horse-riding feats and wagon crashes. \"The Stagecoach drag was replicated and improved upon in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jackie Chan's work,\" says Pearce. The stunt also inspired The Fall Guy's mid-film sequence that sees Colt fighting some henchman in a car chase through Sydney's city centre, and involves a stunt dog and a truck carrying a skip.\n\nEvery department involved in the creation of a movie deserves to be recognised – when was the last movie you watched without a little bit of action? – Ben Jenkin\n\n\"After conversations with David, a very visual, stunt-based director, I'll try putting the character beats in. Then that would go to Chris and locations would get locked,\" he adds. \"Fundamentally, what you're trying to do is keep to the North Star of what the story is here and in that sequence, a person needs to get back to the person they love because of the promise they made.\"\n\nMost impressively of all, The Fall Guy team earned a new Guinness World Record for achieving eight and a half barrel rolls by a car in a single motion – that is, having it flip around eight and a half times in the air. It's an honour Colt receives in the film too; he's asked to perform a high-stakes barrel roll on his first day back on the job after 18 months off. \"You see Colt at the beginning of this movie coming back and he's a little rusty, he's unnerved, we're learning a lot about his mental condition,\" says Leitch. \"He wants to impress Jody. You're feeling all those stakes in that scene. It's not just about rolling a car, it's about, 'Am I going to look good in front of the girl? Am I going to have this chance to get her back?' Action was a great way to define his character, and in a movie about a stuntman, it makes sense.\"\n\nStill, it relies on a driver being able to roll the car expertly well. Just as old Hollywood producers hired rodeo stars to perform daring riding feats in Westerns, champion racer Holladay was enlisted to achieve their historic goal. The sequence takes place on a beach in Kurnell, Sydney, as a nod to the 1974 John Wayne thriller McQ and its climactic beach chase, which featured the first cannon-assisted roll captured in a movie. The stunt involves attaching a cannon-like device underneath a car that fires toward the ground, and propels the vehicle into a series of rolls when triggered by the driver.\n\nIn practice runs, Holladay hit seven rolls, the record previously held by the Aston Martin DBS driven by Daniel Craig's Bond (stuntman Adam Kirley) in Casino Royale (2006), but on the day they outdid it. \"We picked a car that was as tall as it is wide so it just wants to roll, then you find the balance point of that vehicle to put in the device that flips it over,\" he explains. \"Then it's all in the technique of how you drive it: how much air pressure is in that cannon? You could crank that thing up so high, the car will go 10 feet off the ground but we want to stay low and short and just go horizontal.\"\n\nWhile these stunts might last mere seconds or minutes, the planning took five months. \"It is dangerous but it's an art,\" says Holladay. \"We're not out there winging it like daredevils and seeing what happens.\" One of the few stunts Gosling himself performs is a one-shot scene ending in a wire fall, which Jenkin rehearsed before the actor got anywhere near the rigging. \"I did it so many times before at different speeds, at various heights, just to make sure that the system is working well,\" he says. \"Everything you see [is a product of] months and months of calculations, rehearsals and safety plans.\"\n\nStunts over the last century\n\nTrial and error was the norm for early performers like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in their silent movie capers but Harold Lloyd's 1923 film Safety Last! was credited as one of the first films to implement safety protocols and pre-planning. The car chase became a must-have after the release of 1958 crime drama Thunder Road, thanks to stunt coordinator Carey Loftin and his dedication to realism and suspense in depicting high-speed stakes on wheels.\n\nAn increasing demand for risky sequences in action movies more generally soon followed, so the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures was created in 1961 in order to reduce the number of injuries and deaths by offering professional training and qualifications to stunt people. In the 1960s and 70s, the growing popularity of martial arts films from Hong Kong set a new benchmark for energetic fight sequences, spearheaded by stuntmen-turned-stars Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, while the slapstick inventiveness of Jackie Chan's iconic stunt choreography from the 1980s onwards is still being referenced across Hollywood action films today, from Marvel's Shang-Chi to John Wick and, of course, The Fall Guy.\n\nIt should be said, of course, that incredible stunts have not just been a male endeavour. American stuntwoman and racer Kitty O'Neil, who trained with Robinson and is still known as the \"fastest woman in the world,\" set a high fall record in a 1979 episode of Wonder Woman of 127 feet and had an action figure made of her by Mattel a year later. Elsewhere, Jadie David, former stunt double for Pam Grier in the 1970s, is often credited as the first professional African-American stuntwoman and, among other things, performed a pioneering fire stunt without the aid of a protective fire suit on 1975's Mandingo.\n\nThe job of the director, writer, the actors themselves, and everyone else is to convince you that you're inside this reality, that this is a real story, and stunts are the pinnacle of that – Drew Pearce\n\nFor Jenkin, the most noticeable evolution of the stunt performer is a move away from a \"general stuntman\" who does everything to hiring several of them to perform tailored skills. \"There is so much content online and social media so people are very aware of what's out there, of the parkour, the fighting, the cars, the motorcycles,\" he explains. \"So you have to give them the best of the coolest things, and that takes multiple people, more specialists to deliver great action pieces.\"\n\nAs much as The Fall Guy is dedicated to authenticity regarding its stunts, the team recognises how important VFX artists can be to augmenting the believability of any given sequence. \"If you talked to stuntmen in the 60s and 70s, who are still haunted to this day by shots where you can see they're on a cable, they would have begged for wire replacement using CG,\" says Pearce. Leitch also credits the sound department with boosting the intensity of stunts in post-production: \"Sound is so crucial in action. it's a whole other science project to give the audience the feels and in this movie there are some great moments in the third act of how we [use sound to] take up the scale of that set piece and make it really pop.\"\n\nYet where the Academy Awards recognise the sound department and other technical movie-making units, stunts are still not being given their due recognition. Despite stunt veterans like Canutt and Hal Needham being awarded honorary Oscars for their outstanding career contributions, there is still no dedicated best stuntwork Oscars category each year. Campaigning for such an award continues – because as Gosling said while presenting a tribute to stunts with Blunt at this year's Academy Awards in March: \"Every award season features their work in every genre — from Butch and Sundance to Black Panther, from the depths of space to the battlefields of Earth and beyond. Stunt performers and the action they design continue to create some of the most memorable moments in the history of cinema.\" Stunts people didn't get into showbusiness because they wanted awards, says Jenkin, \"but every department involved in the creation of a movie deserves to be recognised. When was the last movie you watched without a little bit of action?\"\n\nWhether Hollywood does eventually give due recognition to the stunts community or not, and whatever technological advances in cinema may occur, one thing's for sure: there will never be anything quite like the dramatic stakes of a stuntperson pulling off an incredible, very tangible physical feat to suck the audience into the high-octane world of make-believe. \"The job of the director, writer, the actors themselves, and everyone else is to convince you that you're inside this reality, that this is a real story, and stunts are the pinnacle of that,\" says Pearce. \"As long as I believe that somebody could have got hurt, the more exciting it is and there's something instinctive in humans that means when there's a real stunt on screen, we know it.\"\n\n--\n\nThe Fall Guy is out in UK cinemas on May 2 and US cinemas on May 3.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFacebook page or message us on Twitter."
