His hopes are thwarted when he is fired from his job at a major department store. However he is eventually able to return, securing both his dream job as advertising manager in charge of window dressing and the girl he loves.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJack Hulbert as Fred Hopkins\n\nLeonora Corbett as Jane Russell\n\nGordon Harker as Briggs\n\nEdmund Gwenn as Philpotts\n\nTony De Lungo as Bronelli\n\nPercy Parsons as American Crook\n\nRoland Culver as Salesman\n\nMiles Malleson as Academy of Music Porter\n\nMartita Hunt as Piano Demonstrator\n\nMaria Milza as Mrs Bronelli\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was made at the Islington Studios of Gainsborough Pictures. Gainsborough was part of the larger Gaumont British empire, and specialised in making comedies during the 1930s. Hulbert became one of the studio's top stars during the early 1930s, often appearing with his wife Cicely Courtneidge.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nBFI Screenonline called the film a \"sublime musical comedy.\"[2] and British Pictures called it \"one of those charmingly amateurish British musicals the 30s produced so well. It proclaims: we may not have dancers like Fred and Ginger, or songwriters like Gershwin or Berlin, or directors like Busby Berkeley, but when it comes to endearing silliness we're world class...Love on Wheels is never going to make the critics Top 100 list, it certainly leaves a smile on your face.\"[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
