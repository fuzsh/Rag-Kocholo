        "text": "This guide is part of the Semantix toolkit for copywriters, but it should also be useful for language students or those who wish to improve their overall language skills. It includes examples of metonymy in use as well as definitions. After reading this blog post, youâll have a clear understanding of what metonymy is and how to use it in your own writing. Weâll also make some helpful distinctions between metonymy and closely associated figures such as synecdoche and metaphor.\n\nWhat is metonymy?\n\nIn simple terms, metonymy is a figure of speech that changes the name of one thing to another related word. Itâs a literary device commonly used to add interest and mood to text. It also enables writers to vary the way they express things or add a sense of the concrete to abstract concepts.\n\nMetonymy can also be used to add an element of the writerâs opinion, either positive or negative, about the concept or object. If a writer uses metonymy, it can be an attempt to influence the audienceâs opinion. Therefore, the effect is subjective and based on everyoneâs experience of the concept and âbuy inâ to the writerâs ideas.\n\nMetonymy gives writers an opportunity to flex their creative muscles, which can be fun. Itâs a form of literary symbolism that invites the reader/listener to visualise a concept as it relates to another form. It can also be used to deliver a deeper meaning or add emphasis. Metonymic phrases are often much simpler and shorter than a full explanation would be. An example would be the well-known phrase, âthe pen is mightier than the swordâ. This is far more concise and impactful than explaining how writing about a situation to influence opinion is a better strategy than fighting about it!\n\nThe word used in place of the original word is called a metonym. In our first example, using âthe stateâ to refer to the legal organisation in a country or area, âstateâ is the metonym.\n\nTypes of metonymies\n\nAs with many literary and rhetorical devices, definitions vary depending on which source you turn to. Moreover, the definitions are open to interpretation. If youâre considering different definitions, our advice is to focus on the ones that are useful to you and those that can help improve your writing or your understanding of texts.\n\nHow is metonymy used?\n\nMetonymy can have a powerful effect on an audience, and it can also be fun to use. It can express a positive or negative opinion about an object or concept. If an audience resonates with the way a skilled writer uses metonymy, they might find the words memorable; their own opinions might even be influenced. This is a good reason why metonymy is used so often in politics and marketing â it has the power to change someoneâs perception.\n\nOn the other hand, if an audience feels that metonymy is used in an inappropriate or detrimental way, itâs possible for them to feel quite negatively about the writer or speaker. The sword of metonymy should be wielded only with skill and consideration.\n\nSome examples of metonymy are so commonplace, we donât even notice when we use, hear or read them. For example, saying âWhat is your favourite Klimt?â. Substituting âpainting by Gustav Klimtâ with simply âKlimtâ is a metonymy that weâd likely understand without much thought or consideration of the substitution.\n\nMetonymy can also be used to emphasise a characteristic or reinforce an aspect of something. It can give us an original, interesting and creative way to say something. For example, if we refer to someone who likes cars as a âpetrol headâ, weâre emphasising that they like vehicles and speed. âPetrol headâ summons up an idea of speed and mechanical performance. It has far more creative impact than just saying that someone âlikes carsâ.\n\nLetâs have a look at some examples of metonymy. We can guarantee youâve come across at least some of them before:\n\nMetonymy examples in literature and poetry\n\nMetonymy in literature\n\nIn this passage from Moby Dick by Herman Melville, the word 'handsâ is used to describe the crew of a ship:\n\nâYou must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.â\n\nCharles Dickens was a master of metonymy. This passage from Bleak House is used to describe the lawyers present in the chancery. Notice how he uses the terms for the clothes they wear in place of their official titles:\n\nThere are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or whatever they may be in legal court suits.\n\nMark Twainâs Huckleberry Finn is also full of with metaphor and metonymy. In this passage, Huck Finn uses the word âbodyâ in place of a person or character:\n\nI went and told the Widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was âspiritual giftsâ.\n\nMetonymy in poetry\n\nIn Ode To A Nightingale by John Keats, the poet uses the word âvintageâ in place of wine or another desirable drink that has been aged:\n\nO, for a draught of vintage! that hath been\n\nCoolâd a long age in the deep-delved earth,\n\nTasting of Flora and the country green,\n\nDance, and ProvenÃ§al song, and sunburnt mirth!\n\nLord Byronâs famous poem, She Walks In Beauty, uses metonymy to paint an alluring picture of womanhood. In the example below, the term âraven tressâ is used in place of her hair. This gives the reader an impression of hair that is visually magnificent and, perhaps, dark and mysterious as a raven.\n\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\n\nHad half impaired the nameless grace\n\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\n\nOr softly lightens oâer her face;\n\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express,\n\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.\n\nMetonymy examples in speech and performance\n\nSpeech\n\nMarlon Brando used âHollywoodâ to describe the world of film rather than the geographical area:\n\nMost of the successful people in Hollywood are failures as human beings.\n\nLance Morcan uses âpressâ to describe part of the news reporting industry:\n\nThe media, like anything else, can be bought. Everything, it seems, has its price. Even the free press.\n\nFigures of speech\n\nBelow are some common examples of metonymy being used in general language. These are British/English specific so itâs important to remember that they might not work if translated directly. If youâre creating material that will be translated to another language, itâs always a good idea to work with an experienced, native-speaking writer who can check that translated figures of speech still carry the same inferred meanings or suggest alternative ones.\n\nâThe silver screenâ - the world of film.\n\nâPlodâ - police (refers to them walking - plodding â âthe beatâ)\n\nâThe lawâ - also police\n\nâWhat's your favourite dish?â - meaning, whatâs your favourite meal\n\nâThe turfâ - world of horse racing\n\nâHired gunâ - a freelance assassin\n\nâThe pressâ â for newspapers or media\n\nâWall Streetâ â for the US financial sector\n\nMetonymy vs synecdoche\n\nSynecdoche is a type of metonymy. Like metonymy, it constitutes a name change, but the name needs to be either using a part of something to describe the whole or the other way around.\n\nFor example, the expression âhaving a roof over oneâs headâ contains two synecdoches. The âroofâ actually refers to more than just a roof â an entire house, an apartment, or in general, a place to stay. One's âheadâ, too, refers to the whole body or being.\n\nIn both examples above, the whole (home and body) is substituted for the part (roof and head). This type of synecdoche is called pars pro toto, which is Latin for âthe part for the wholeâ. The opposite also has a name: totem pro parte. An example the latter is for example saying: âThe United States have decided...â where the United States symbolise the government, or âThe company has decided...â meaning the management.\n\nIn other words, synecdoche is a subcategory of metonymy. So how can you tell if something is a metonymy without being a synecdoche? For example, describing your car as your âwheelsâ or your âmotorâ would be using synecdoche, as these are both parts of the car. The word ârideâ can also be used to describe a car, but this time ârideâ isnât part of the car so itâs metonymy, not synecdoche.\n\nMetonymy vs metaphor\n\nMetaphor is also a related figure of speech, and there is even an ongoing academic debate as to whether you can even wholly separate metonymies from metaphors, or whether they are so inherently linked that they should be seen as the same device.\n\nHowever, they are generally distinguished in the following way: metaphors are comparative and figurative, whereas metonymies are associative and logical.\n\nA metaphor compares aspects of two unrelated things. Referring to yourself as a âmagpieâ if you collect shiny objects, a ânight owlâ if you like late nights, or a ârising starâ if youâre doing well, are all examples of metaphor. Calling a child the âapple of my eyeâ or describing an idea-generating meeting as âbrain stormingâ are also examples of metaphor.\n\nA metonymy, on the other hand, expresses a proximity to the thing it substitutes. For example, if you are at a friendâs house and they offer you some wine, and you say: âIâd love to have a glassâ, you are using a metonymy, since the âglassâ is just the container of what you would love to have. You have substituted the content for the container, which is logically understood with regards to what was offered.\n\nHow metonymy is used in marketing\n\nMetonymy can be used in advertising very creatively. As a rhetorical device, the skillful use of metonymy makes the advertisement more verbally vivid and therefore more memorable.\n\nMetonymy is often used in advertising in an ambitious or hyperbolic attempt to associate a product with the thing substituted in the metonym. An example of this is a recurring tagline from Yorkshire Tea (Taylors of Harrogate), which mentions âa proper brew'. Since the product theyâre promoting is dried tea leaves grounded in paper bags, theyâre not actually making âbrewsâ. Since the word they use to promote their product is rather what can be accomplished by a customer with the help of their product, âbrewâ is a form of metonymy.\n\nAnother example is from an H&M campaign promoting their Conscious Denim collection, with the tagline: âGo green, wear blueâ, where âgreenâ is a metonym for being environmentally friendly. This is a tricky example, though, since âgreenâ might originally have been a metaphor before becoming a widespread term associated with environmental issues. The term probably originated with âgreen politicsâ, becoming a kind of ideology wanting to encourage political decisions that prioritise the preservation of nature. It might also have been a metonymy, since the colour green is in many areas the most common colour in nature.\n\nEven the other colour in the campaign, âblueâ, is a metonymy for denim or rather, for the products theyâre selling that are made out of denim.\n\nMetonymy can also happen organically and provide a brand with plenty of âfree marketingâ when an audience start referring to a whole range of products by a specific brand name. An example of this is âcokeâ being used for fizzy cola drinks in general, or âhooverâ used as a name for all vacuum cleaners.\n\nSemantix copywriting and proofreading\n\nSemantix offers a full range of copywriting services, and you can work with a copywriter with specific knowledge in your industry.
