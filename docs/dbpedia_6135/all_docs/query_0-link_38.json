        "meta_description": "A list of 80 films compiled on Letterboxd, including To Provide All People (2018), The Spirit of '45 (2013), The Nation's Health (1983), Britannia Hospital (1982) and Family Life (1971). About this list: *Updated July 2018 for the NHS's 70th anniversary!* Films set in or concerning British medicine, care and treatment since the 20th century, specifically the inception of the NHS in 1948 - our finest institution, a socialist landmark. It's not an area all too often explored in British cinema strangely enough, though it did thrive for a little bit understandably in the '50s and '60s. When it was it was it was oftem usually for comedic or - by the '70s - for sexploitation purposes. I guess TV is where depictions of the NHS has truly thrived (with Life In Emergency Ward 10, listed here, a spin off from a successful TV series and The Nation's Health, also listed here, a superb mini series) and medical dramas such as Angels, Casualty, Holby City, Medics, Cardiac Arrest, Bodies, Critical and Call The Midwife all have something to recommend them. I'm looking for examples where the majority of the film is set in or has to do with NHS/medical settings and the business of medicine, or a central character is largely associated with the business of medicine - so Alfie, which features just a vignette in a TB ward hasn't been included sadly - and nor has any film which features characters who are in the medical profession but this detail is just background colour - Kerry Fox in Shallow Grave for example. I also don't want to cross-over too much into films that are about disease or one's mortality as I think that's potentially a very different list - as a result, The C-Word has regrettably been taken off this list. Have I missed any? Open to suggestions",
