If you thought 30s British cinema was all upper-class twits in dinner jackets and awfully nice ladyships with impeccable cut-glass accents, think again (though there are plenty of those). Why not drop in on George Formby and tap-dancing moppet Binkie Stuart in Keep Your Seats, Please (1936)? Or if heartthrob Charles Boyer is more to your taste, you’ll find him on dashing form as a Japanese naval officer in The Battle (1934).

For contemporary British audiences these films represented an escape from economic depression and escalating political tension at home and across Europe. With no less than 60 hours of newly digitised material – and most of the 50 features currently unavailable on DVD – Welcome to the Dream Palace offers the perfect getaway from 21st-century stresses.
