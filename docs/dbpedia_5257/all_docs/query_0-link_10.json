If you'd like to purchase it, your 50% off SRP discount code is: sub50This discount code will work with most Partner Label, VSA, VSU, VSP or Peekarama titles that falls within your subscribership (certain releases, like box sets, will require a different code). This special limited edition embossed slipcover (designed by Tony Stella) is limited to 2,000 units and is only available here at VinegarSyndrome.com! From arthouse to Canuxploitation, Canadian International Pictures (CIP) is devoted to resurrecting vital, distinctive, and overlooked triumphs of Canadian cinema. This label is focused on the country’s original cinematic boom years – spanning the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s – occasionally venturing past that period (and the country’s borders) to highlight the films of Canada’s most inspired actors and filmmakers. Vinegar Syndrome’s sister company, OCN Distribution, is thrilled to be representing CIP's brand new line of home video releases! Seasoned drug smuggler and thief François “Chico” Tremblay (Panic’s Marc Legault) is tired of his modest lifestyle. Given the opportunity to earn $50,000 killing a prominent New York City gangster, he leaps at the opportunity, ignoring the warnings of Montreal’s leading mob boss, who has forbidden local criminals from taking the assignment. Upon his return, Chico discovers he is being pursued from all sides, prompting an unlikely response: he calls a local talk radio show and starts revealing the mafia’s most carefully guarded secrets. As his revelations get more shocking, so do the tactics of his adversaries, culminating in a devastating gut punch of a finale. Bringing seedy authenticity to his depiction of organized crime, director Jacques Godbout (YUL 871) reached new heights with this urgent, fatalistic gangster odyssey. Landing somewhere between the American and European crime films of the ’70s, The Mob (La gammick) is propelled into constant crisis by its uniquely unscrupulous protagonist – and those determined to avenge his indiscretions. Almost completely unseen outside of Quebec, this is a lost Canadian classic.In addition to The Mob, this disc includes Godbout’s previous film – the madcap hockey-themed Les « troubbes » de Johnny – and Criminels québécois, a new collection of Quebec crime film trailers from the ’60s and ’70s, highlighting overlooked gems from Denys Arcand, Gilles Carle, Jean-Claude Lord, and several other notable auteurs of the era. directed by: Jacques Godboutstarring: Marc Legault, Dorothée Berryman, Pierre Gobeil, André Guy, Gilbert Chénier, Julien Poulin, Gilles Renaud1975 / 87 min / 1.85:1 / French Mono with English subtitlesAdditional info:• Region Free Blu-ray• Scanned and restored in 2K from the 35mm interpositive • Criminels québécois - A collection of Quebec crime film trailers from the ’60s and ’70s (39 min.) • Les « troubbes » de Johnny (1974, 21 min.) • Bonus short: Hunger (1974, 11 min.) • Booklet featuring an essay by Fantasia programmer Marc Lamothe and a new interview with director Jacques Godbout • Reversible cover artwork • English SDH subtitles for all three films Vinegar Syndrome is the premiere online destination for cult classic movies on DVD and blu-ray from the 70's, 80's and 90's.",
