        "text": "Sussman explains how mobsters extorted studio bosses by taking control of the unions whose members were essential to the quotidian workings of making movies. The mobsters controlled unions of projectionists, art directors, cinematographers, electricians, scene designers, stagehands, extras. Control the unions, and you control the whole industry. The mobsters were like sharks tearing away enormous chunks of cash. They extorted producers, blackmailed stars, forced studios to hire those actors who were either connected to mobsters or indebted to them.\n\nIn addition to Tinseltown Gangsters, Jeffrey Sussman is the author of Sin City Gangsters: The Rise and Decline of the Mob in Las Vegas; Big Apple Gangsters: The Rise and Decline of the Mob in New York; and Boxing and the Mob: The Notorious History of the Sweet Science.\n\nPre-publication comments about Tinseltown Gangsters:\n\n“Sussman turns his attention to the mob in Hollywood during the 20th century. He begins with Joseph Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy family, who reportedly used the connections he established with the mafia during Prohibition in Chicago to borrow money to purchase the low-budget film company FBO Pictures in 1920 and turn a quick profit. Sussman’s meticulous research indicates that mobsters soon realized there were more opportunities for illegal wealth in Hollywood. For instance, notorious gangster Bugsy Siegel hobnobbed with A-list celebrities and got loans from them that he never repaid. He also took control of the Screen Extras Guild and refused to provide extras to the studios until they paid up. Meanwhile, former boxer Mickey Cohen financed the publication Hollywood Nite Life to allegedly extort celebrities in return for not publishing incriminating articles about them. A great addition to collections about the history of film or organized crime, chronicling famous and lesser-known mobsters who made a killing, literally and figuratively, in Hollywood. Sussman’s diligent research and juicy storytelling will appeal to fans of his other works.” - Library Journal\n\n“For years, Hollywood has been fascinated by the world of the mafia, but until now, there really hasn’t been a comprehensive look at what role the mob actually played in Hollywood’s formative years. Jeffrey Sussman’s masterpiece changes all that. In vivid detail that’s as well researched as any history book but as captivating as any crime novel, Sussman provides an in-depth look at some of the biggest names in the underworld, Hollywood, and politics, and how those areas so often seemed to intersect with one another. This book is required reading for anyone seeking an answer to the questions of 'How did Hollywood get this way?' or 'What happened to the mob?” — Frank Morano, nationally syndicated radio talk show host and the host of “The Racket Report” podcast\n\n“Tinseltown Gangsters is not just a captivating page turner, but also a valuable historical account that exposes behind the scenes insights into the movies, its scandals and the entertainment industry's long-standing involvement with organized crime. Sussman's heavily researched dive into this hidden world is a testament to uncovering the sordid, behind the scenes business of the movie world. This book is a gem for both true crime enthusiasts and Hollywood aficionados alike. Highly recommended.” — Robert A. Santucci, Esq., former chief of the Rackets Bureau, Office of the District Attorney of Bronx County; and special assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Public Corruption Unit. Mr. Santucci prosecuted numerous members of organized crime, many of whom had relationships with celebrities.\n\n“In Tinseltown Gangsters, Jeffrey Sussman reveals the dark secrets of the American mafia and the Hollywood film industry. With meticulous research and vivid storytelling, Sussman exposes the mob’s influence over the stars, the studios, and the scandals of Tinseltown. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of crime and cinema.”— Gary Jenkins, producer/host, Gangland Wire Crime Stories podcast\n\n“Jeffrey Sussman presents a riveting picture of the most degenerate, immoral characters in the movie industry, included are the sexual behavior of actors and executives, along with their relationships with members of organized crime over numerous decades. Tinseltown Gangsters is concise and well done. Bravo to Mr. Sussman!”— S. M. Chris Franzblau, former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney for alleged organized crime figures and professional boxers, in a career that has spanned more than 50 years\n\n“Tinseltown, implying a shiny, soft place, was an easy target for organized crime. Jeffrey Sussman again takes us on a harrowing journey, showing how gangsters preyed on the soft targets, big and small, in Tinseltown, USA.”— Joseph Giannini, Esq., former criminal defense attorney for members of organized crime and retired captain of the U. S. Marines Corps"
