        "text": "Extraction 3 is taking longer than expected to arrive at Netflix, but the end result will be better for it according to Chris Hemsworth.\n\n\"Each time there's been such a great collective collaboration between myself, Sam [Hargrave], the Russos, Netflix in expanding that universe and bringing that courage in life,\" the actor told Collider in July 2024.\n\n\"We just wanna make sure that we have it right, and that we have a script that is good enough basically to follow the last two, because I'm really proud of what we've done previously, and hopefully we can do it again.\"\n\nThe threequel was originally confirmed by Netflix after Extraction 2 had one of the streaming service's biggest opening weekends of 2023.\n\nReleased on June 16, 2023, the action sequel topped The Mother for the most-watched Netflix movie debut in 2023 with 88.4 million hours viewed.\n\nMeanwhile, the first Extraction remains one of Netflix's biggest-ever movies with 226.9 million hours viewed. Even if the sequel wasn't able to match those numbers, viewers are eager to see more of Tyler Rake's adventures.\n\nSo, yes, we're definitely getting another helping of Chris Hemsworth, with returning director Sam Hargrave.\n\nWe had suspected that a third movie was brewing, as the ending of Extraction 2 saw Idris Elba's mysterious new character recruit Tyler for another sure-to-be dangerous mission that we'll see play out in the next movie.\n\nSo while we wait for that return, here's everything you need to know about Extraction 3.\n\nExtraction 3 potential release date: When will Extraction 3 be released on Netflix?\n\nWhile we now know that Extraction 3 is happening on Netflix, we still don't have a confirmed release date for the new movie.\n\nHargrave had already revealed to BroBible's Post-Credit Podcast in May 2023 that a story was \"in development\" for a third movie, assuming the sequel was a hit – which it turned out to be. \"What it is exactly, I can't say right now, but I believe there is another adventure in the wind for Tyler Rake,\" he teased.\n\nOver a year after that, the script seems to be still in development.\n\n\"We’re in the middle of sort of writing, prepping, getting it ready. I don’t know when we’re gonna start, but it’s in the works,\" Chris Hemsworth told Collider in May 2024.\n\nThree years passed between the first Extraction movie, released in April 2020, and the sequel Extraction 2, released on June 16, 2023, so we could be looking at a 2026 release if Netflix decides to follow the same pattern. We'd be happy to be proved wrong, though.\n\nExtraction 3 cast: Who's going to be in Extraction 3?\n\nExtraction 2 spoilers follow.\n\nThe announcement for the third movie confirmed that, of course, Chris Hemsworth will be back as Tyler Rake.\n\nWe haven't had any other cast announcements yet, but we'd expect Golshifteh Farahani back as Tyler's partner Nik Khan. However, she'll be without her brother Yaz (played by Adam Bessa), who was killed off in the sequel.\n\nIdris Elba's mysterious character, credited as Alcott, will almost definitely be back too, as the ending teased he has a part to play in the series' future.\n\nAnother character that could pop up in future films is Olga Kurylenko's Mia, Tyler Rake's ex-wife. However, although Tyler helped save her sister, it still seemed she wanted nothing to do with him.\n\nExtraction 3 plot: What will Extraction 3 be about?\n\nThere are still no details about what Extraction 3 will be about, but the path is set thanks to Extraction 2's ending.\n\nThe sequel follows Tyler Rake as he achieves an impossible prison break to save his ex-wife's sister and her two kids, who are held captive by Georgian mob boss Davit Radiani.\n\nThe extraction is successful, but Davit's death enrages his brother Zurab, who won't stop until he has killed Tyler. After a dramatic chase in Vienna, the mercenary faces the villain and kills him, but the Austrian police storm onto the scene and arrest him and his partner Nik.\n\nAt the end of the film, Idris Elba's unnamed character reappears to make them an offer: They will be released from prison if they do a job for his boss. It remains to be seen who that might be, or what kind of mission they are about to embark on.\n\nExtraction 3 should reveal more about this new job – probably some very difficult extraction, to honour the saga's title – that will challenge Rake's abilities as a soldier. It's also a new opportunity to bring him and Nik closer together, as we see if there's romantic potential between them.\n\nWe also expect to meet Alcott's mysterious boss and find out if he is an ally or a new villain to deal with. Talking to Collider, Hargrave said that while they know who the character is, they don't yet know who will play them:\n\n\"You just had two pretty wild movies with Tyler Rake. What is going to be upping the ante, what are the stakes? How are they elevated? And by just dropping a single line, like, 'He's a gnarly mother-effer', you're like: okay, one line then says this is someone who might be in the same league as Tyler Rake. Now, I'm intrigued.\"\n\nHe added: \"Who is going to portray that? I think that's the beauty of that line. It's like, now that single line can go out and attract a lot of cool, amazing actors to play that wild character.\"\n\nIn November 2023, Netflix's Head of Film Scott Stuber gave an exciting update about the status of the script. \"You know, you've got to find the right thing,\" Stuber told Collider.\n\n\"I think the second one was so good because it was emotional and complex. It kind of reminds me of when I worked on the Bourne movies. Tony Gilroy did such a good job on the second one of making it emotional and making that kind of activate around Franka [Potente’s] death,\" he added.\n\n\"So, this one had the same kind of familial background around Chris [Hemsworth’s] motivation. Getting Idris [Elba] into the franchise was an interesting way to kind of evolve it.\n\n\"So we're waiting on the script and working hard, but aspiration would be great to get it back. I mean, what those guys have done has been really great in that franchise.\"\n\nExtraction 3 trailer: Any Extraction 3 footage yet?\n\nExtraction 3 has not released any footage yet, so we'll have to wait a little while until we can see a trailer. Patience!\n\nExtraction and Extraction 2 are available to watch on Netflix.\n\n.."
