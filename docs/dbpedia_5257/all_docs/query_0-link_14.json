        "text": "Noirvember is here and you know how I keep saying that The Big Combo (1955) is the most underrated film of all time? I believe that it goes beyond genre. I don’t think The Big Combo is the most underrated noir ever, I believe it’s the most underrated film ever. I’ve blogged about it numerous times and I am still as obsessed with it as the first time I watched it. But if we’re talking especially film noir, I think The Big Combo has a relatively steady following within the noir-loving community, as it should. The Mob (1951, dir. Robert Parrish), on the other hand… For a film with Broderick Crawford as wise-cracking policeman Johnny Damico going undercover to stop dodgy activities on the docks as well as some of the most hilarious noir lines after, perhaps, The Big Sleep, The Mob is inexplicably unknown and severely under-appreciated. As some of you may know, I wrote an article for Eddie Muller’s Noir City E-magazine in 2018. This was for the REMEMBER ME feature and I chose the always underrated, always terrifying and always brilliant Neville Brand. I researched and watched and re-watched a lot of his movies, including The Mob, which I hadn’t seen up until that point. I loved it and have been trying to get people to watch it ever since, so you know what to do! Here are some of my favorite quotes from it:\n\n‘I’ve got more influential friends than you in the Boy Scouts.’ Pawn broker to Johnny Damico – Ouch. Imagine saying that to a police officer just as he’s trying to get a good deal just because he’s a police officer. Ha!\n\n‘I’ll remember your face.’ ‘I’ll try to forget yours.’ Longshoreman and Johnny Damico – I mean, that’s the stuff noir is made of, but Crawford’s delivery is always priceless.\n\n‘How are ya, Flynn? I got a little invitation to a party for you. RSVP.’ ‘Sure, I’ll go right home and change.’ ‘It’s a sort of come-as-you-are party. Get in.’ Gunner and Johnny Damico – Gunner has his gun firmly pointed at Johnny and this is the exchange. Brilliant. In fact, their entire interaction is so slick, it makes you wish you could drop those lines in conversation, but that’s noir for ya!\n\n(Un)Happy Noirvember!"
