        "text": "Mobsters can’t help themselves. It’s in their nature to solve problems the family way — with baseball bats, explosives and anything at hand that leaves an opponent dead or writhing in agony. Sadistic violence is a reflexive response to having grown up in households where fathers regularly beat their sons senseless for no reason.\n\nSo says Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro), a mobster in hiding, when explaining his pathological behavior in Luc Besson’s dark action comedy “The Family.” Giovanni, who ratted out his fellow mobsters to the feds and is now in the witness protection program, has a new identity. Under the name Fred Blake, he has been moved with his family to a village in Normandy. There they face many frustrations, starting with the ancient plumbing.\n\nWhen Giovanni’s wife, Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), shops and is snidely informed, “We don’t stock stuff like that,” she blithely burns down the supermarket. Maggie is disgusted by the French preference for butter and cream over olive oil. And in the movie’s funniest speech, she rails about the awful things these dairy products do to your insides.\n\nThe role of Giovanni could have been a walk-through for Mr. De Niro, whose character, given his new identity, calls himself a writer and begins typing his memoirs. But Mr. De Niro gives a surprisingly nuanced performance of a monster offering a long list of bogus reasons to excuse his evil. The character is charming in a rough-hewed way, but lethal. He loves inflicting pain and misery.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
