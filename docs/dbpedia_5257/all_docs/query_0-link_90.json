        "text": "Toni Collette is one of the best actors working today. She is someone who can go from utter terror in “Hereditary” to the crime drama series, “Unbelievable,” and the true-crime series “The Staircase.” And now, she’s tackling a silly mob comedy in “Mafia Mamma.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Power’ Trailer: Auli’i Cravalho & Toni Collette Star In A Sci-Fi-ish Thriller Series About Teenage Girls With Electrical Powers\n\nAs seen in the trailer for “Mafia Mamma,” the film follows the story of an American woman who finds herself unknowingly taking over a crime family in Italy after the death of her grandfather. She doesn’t see herself as capable of leading a criminal organization because she’s currently occupied with the drama surrounding her marriage and trying to raise a teenage son. But this is a comedy, so you have to assume everything will likely work out in the end, and hopefully, the journey will be hilarious.\n\nREAD MORE: Toni Collette, Mark Ruffalo & Naomi Ackie Join Robert Pattinson For Bong Joon-Ho’s Next Sci-Fi Film\n\nJoining Collette in the cast are Monica Bellucci, Sophia Nomvete, Giulio Corso, Francesco Mastroianni, Alfonso Perugini, Eduardo Scarpetta, Tim Daish, and Tommy Rodger. “Mafia Mamma” is directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who is probably best known for helming the first “Twilight” film. More recently, she directed an episode of “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities,” as well as films such as “Miss Bala” and “Prisoner’s Daughter.”\n\n“Mafia Mamma” arrives in theaters on April 14. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nMAFIA MAMMA follows an insecure American woman (Toni Collette) who unexpectedly inherits her grandfather’s mafia empire in Italy. Guided by the firm’s trusted consigliere (Monica Bellucci), she hilariously defies everyone’s expectations, including her own, as the new head of the family business."
