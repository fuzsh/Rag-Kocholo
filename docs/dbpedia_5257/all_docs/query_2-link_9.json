        "text": "Shigeo Kageyama (影山 茂夫, Kageyama Shigeo), nicknamed \"Mob\" (モブ, Mobu) and \"White T-Poison\", is the main protagonist of the Mob Psycho 100 series. He is a third-year student at Salt Middle School and the vice-president of the Body Improvement Club who is also a former assistant and disciple of Arataka Reigen.\n\nAppearance\n\nShigeo has jet-black bowl-shaped hair and dark eyes.[2]\n\nHe is usually seen wearing the Salt Middle School male uniform, a typical gakuran outfit. Shigeo has a rather nondescript expression on his face. However, whenever he reaches 100%, his eyes glow red or white, and his hair is affected by his psychic powers, causing it to float and become spiky. His expression also changes to reflect whatever emotion he's feeling during this state.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs a child, Shigeo learned that his psychic power was linked to his emotions. Strong negative emotions can cause him to hurt others, something he strongly dislikes and avoids (as shown in the 7th Division Arc where, after going 100%, he hurts several teenagers). Therefore, he generally tries to keep his emotions in check. However, in some cases, he can control his powers, e.g. when he is at 100% courage. This could imply that pure emotions, such as courage or the honest and genuine desire to want to help or protect others, can allow Mob to remain in control, while negative emotions such as rage cause him to lose control.\n\nHe is reserved and struggles with \"reading the atmosphere\", which has led him to have a lack of friends, and even to come across as aloof and distant to others due to his constant inexpressiveness, like in the (LOL)cult arc. He's also easily scared in public, as seen when he stood in silence for 5 minutes on the podium during a student presidential election speech.\n\nShigeo is a very kind and understanding individual, never holding grudges or resentment towards those who've hurt him. This was first seen with Teruki, who relentlessly attacked Shigeo and choked him to try and fight back, but despite this, the two became close friends. With Ritsu, who gained psychic powers and wanted to fight Shigeo to prove he was stronger while trying to break their bond, Shigeo pays no mind to this, later commending Ritsu for his intelligence and other skills that Shigeo lacks, leaving Ritsu in tears. The most notable example of his capacity for forgiveness is with Minori, who ruthlessly bullied him for six months in a mental world created by Mogami and brought him to the brink of insanity. Despite having been hurt like this, Shigeo instantly forgives her and chooses to view his time in the mental world as a valuable lesson that both Minori and Keiji taught him, actually saying that he was glad they could meet.\n\nPerhaps most remarkable about Shigeo is his seemingly nigh-limitless compassion. When fighting villains, he often refuses to use his psychic powers unless necessary, preferring to talk with his enemies and try to reason with them. With Katsuya, despite being the enemy, Shigeo offered to be his friend and helped him to become a better person by no longer hurting people. With Toichiro Suzuki, despite having destroyed most of Spice City, Shigeo still offers the hand of friendship and continues to try and reason with him. During their fight, at some point, he empathizes with Suzuki due to the lonely life he leads, and actually cries after his rage get cooled, and didn't want to hurt him anymore, but had no choice at that point, conflicting with his previous rage. Then, when Suzuki is about to self-destruct, Shigeo makes the incredibly selfless decision to stay by his side in his final moments because leaving him to die alone would be too sad, finally causing Suzuki to change.\n\nIn the Keiji Mogami Arc, he lives for half a year in a fantasy world created by the bitter former psychic, Mogami. There, he is friendless, without a family supporting him or anything else. Despite that, it takes great emotional manipulation, along with physical harm, for Mogami to make Shigeo become angered with his tormentors. Even then, he wants to offer them forgiveness. Moreover, instead of being bitter and viewing the world in a more negative light after this torment, he viewed it positively. It meant that with all the horrible people and circumstances in the world, he was lucky to have his friends and family, and vowed to be even more grateful, demonstrating his very noble and pure character.\n\nHe is also morally opposed to using psychic abilities against other people. He is, however, willing to cast this principle aside in cases of emergency, such as when Ritsu is kidnapped.\n\nAnother principle of his is that psychic ability does not make him or others inherently better and that his psychic ability is not something that he requires in life. This belief leads to conflict between him and Teru, Mogami, Toichiro, and even his own brother, Ritsu. Even so, if the situation is dire enough, for example, his brother being kidnapped by Claw's 7th Division, he will use them without hesitation.\n\nBecause of this principle, and because he believes that he is greatly lacking in many other areas, Shigeo has a low opinion of himself, despite being one of the most powerful espers in the series. As a result, Shigeo was initially very silent and did not often voice his opinion, mostly keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself. But as time passed, he began to speak out more and state his opinions on many things. This primarily affected his relationship with Reigen; at first, Shigeo would follow Reigen practically anywhere at almost anytime and do whatever he told him with almost no objection. The only exception was against Ceiling Crasher when Shigeo reminded Reigen that he'd asked his master not to summon him on such short notice. However, even then, he wasn't particularly irritated. But at the beginning of Season 2, Shigeo objected to Reigen's wishes more fiercely, telling his master in a somewhat aggravated tone to stop forcing Shigeo to drop everything for him.\n\nThis more confident side and the growing suspicion towards his master appeared to finally hit its peak after Shigeo lived in Mogami's world for six months and Reigen called him out of the blue once again to deal with an evil spirit when Shigeo was going to have a very fun and socially engaging activity with his friends. After Reigen claims that his friends are simply mocking Shigeo and telling him to prioritize his job over his social life, going so far as to call Shigeo gullible, this is the tipping point that makes Shigeo finally go against his master. He realizes that not everything Reigen said was true, and states that he wasn't as gullible as Reigen believed him to be. From this point on, he stops going to work and leaves Reigen for an unknown period of time to enjoy himself with his brother and his friends, actually being happy and not being worried about Reigen.\n\nShigeo also had a somewhat naive sense of how cruel the world could be, due to being shielded from a harsh environment by a loving family--especially the honor student Ritsu. This was why Mogami decided to put Shigeo in a mental mindscape where he didn't have his powers and was surrounded by horrible people he couldn't fight back against. After six months of torment and being subconsciously motivated by Mogami, Shigeo had had enough. He was almost ready to unleash his psychic powers on his bullies, but he was stopped by Dimple, who reminded him of who he was and snapped him out of his amnesia. Despite the bullying he endured for six months in Mogami's mental mindscape, he didn't appear to be traumatized after escaping, even declaring that, since the world was full of terrible people, he should be even more grateful for the amazing people and family he has around him.\n\nEven though Shigeo wasn't turned by Mogami the way he'd initially wanted, Mogami and the six months of torment impacted Shigeo and his view of the world. Although he didn't appear psychologically traumatized by the experience, he appeared to have become less naive and more knowledgeable about the world around him. It's possible that after seeing the horrible people in the world and the way others used Mogami, he began to grow even more suspicious of his master and became less gullible as a result, which was why he left Reigen after concluding his master was beginning to use him and treat him more like a tool instead of a person. Moreover, he appears to have become harder on his friends and allies after Mogami told him to be harder on people when the time came. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the effect Mogami may have had on Shigeo was how Shigeo became more willing to use his psychic powers in excessively aggressive ways when the time called for it. The primary instance of this was when he began to violently and painfully twist and tear Toichiro Suzuki's body to end the fight, something he likely would not have done before.\n\nDespite his honorable and humble nature, Shigeo is not immune to praise and flattery. This was primarily shown after the Divine Tree arc when it appeared that he was becoming more popular and girls were talking to him or talking about him, and when he became aware of the Psycho Helmet cult having a meeting to worship their \"leader\". This caused him to enter a new 100% state: 100% Getting Carried Away, where his face morphed to become more defined, and he began to speak in a more self-righteous tone. This new overconfidence was noted by Reigen when Shigeo explained that a cult was created because of his actions, an overestimation of himself, and something Reigen thought sounded awfully cocky. However, this inflated confidence appears to have disappeared sometime after Shigeo discovered Dimple had taken his place as the leader of the Psycho Helmet cult at their meeting.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore meeting his master, Reigen, Shigeo was frightened of his own abilities and was looking for a guiding force to follow. He soon learned from Reigen and his childhood crush, Tsubomi, that his psychic ability did not make him inherently greater than anyone else. He also learned that psychic ability should not be used against other people. This philosophy leads him to where he is currently and is one of his many defining traits of his.\n\nPlot\n\nSpring of Youth Arc\n\nShigeo first appeared when his master Arataka Reigen called him to exterminate an evil spirit named Ceiling Crasher. The spirit underestimated Shigeo, but he exorcized the Ceiling Crasher easily and quickly.\n\nShigeo was an adolescent boy in his second-year middle school days. Unlike his peers, Shigeo spent his time working assistant in a psychic business run by Reigen. He manned the reception desk of Spirits and Such Consultation Office. He observed Reigen getting better on massages on customers like the man plagued by a one-click site curse. Reigen explained these massages are only effective because of his spiritual powers.\n\nThe Telepathy Club of Salt Middle School was threatened to be abolished because it lacked a member to be considered a legitimate club of the school. They found Shigeo, an esper who doesn't have a club or committee, and tried to recruit him. But when Shigeo called Reigen to tell him he was going to be late for work, Reigen advised against joining the Telepathy club, even with the persuasion of the Telepathy club's president Tome about it. Shigeo decided to think about his decision to join the club or not overnight.\n\nShigeo and Reigen went to another job in Highso Private Girls' Academy, an all-girls private high school. Unable to get permission to enter the school, the two dressed in female uniforms infiltrate it. But Reigen's disguise was seen through, leaving only Shigeo to meet their clients on the school rooftop. Arriving at the rooftop, Shigeo mistook three thug girls lounging there as his clients, Mari and Chihiro, who showed up and called his attention when the thugs left. Girls said their school did not take them seriously when they complained about supernatural occurrences in the school. So they called the cheapest exorcists in the area, Reigen and Shigeo.\n\nShigeo, Mari, and Chihiro explored the school to find spiritual occurrences. Shigeo only felt slight of the supernatural. They heard a scream from the bathroom and ran there, only to find a student saying something peeked up the bathroom stall she was using. Shigeo, Mari, and Chihiro continued searching the school until they reached the gymnasium where the basketball team was practicing. Shigeo said the spirit was angry and trapped it in the gym using his psychic powers. Entering the gym, they encountered the huge bespectacled ghost called the Scent-Ghoul. The Scent-Ghoul attacked Shigeo, but he easily canceled the punch with his psychic powers, while simultaneously destroying the Scent-Ghoul's arm. When the Scent-Ghoul realized it underestimated Shigeo and was too weak to be a match for him, it tried to take a basketball member hostage to save itself. Still, Shigeo protected her and exorcized the spirit. This earned him praise from the girls.\n\nThe next day, the Telepathy club asked Shigeo if he finally decided to join the club. They were interrupted by the Vice President of the student council Hikaru Tokugawa and the newly formed Body Improvement Club, which will take over the Telepathy Club's room once they're abolished. Tokugawa questioned Shigeo about his decision to join the Telepathy Club and about what he really wanted to do during his youth. At this, Shigeo realized that he dreamed to confess his feelings to his crush Tsubomi. He flash-backed on the times he spent with Tsubomi, showing her various things he could do with his psychic powers. He made frogs and dogs float in the air and made playground bars wriggle. Eventually, Tsubomi grew bored with Shigeo's psychic abilities, and Shigeo realized there were other things he could do besides using his psychic powers. Shigeo joined the Body Improvement Club, much to the surprise of everyone. The Body Improvement Club happily accepted him.\n\nShigeo trained with the Body Improvement Club members, but their heavy training made Shigeo faint. Musashi, the president of the Body Improvement Club, brought Shigeo back to their club room, where the Telepathy club continued loitering. He left Shigeo to the care of the Telepathy Club members.\n\n(LOL) Cult Arc\n\nA masked woman approached Shigeo while he was going home. She tried to convince Shigeo to join LOL, a month-old religious cult, with the promise of making him popular. Its leader Dimple can make anyone smile and laugh. When Shigeo arrived at the LOL assembly, he found a crowd of masked people and wondered if they wanted to become popular just like him. He was welcomed warmly by the LOL members, and he was presented with two new recruits, one of which is his classmate Ichi.\n\nDimple made his appearance. The LOL members laughed with Dimple while Shigeo and the other two new recruits just watched and stared at them, finding them creepy. Dimple promises the three new recruits' smiles and happiness as he places smile masks on them. Mezato and the other recruit began smiling and laughing despite not previously wanting to when they wore the masks.\n\nShigeo questions if the only purpose of the cult is smiles and happiness, rather than popularity. The lady who found him states he has problems with his love life. Shigeo says that the cult won't help him with his problems and takes off the mask, revealing that he is the only one unaffected by it; much to Dimple's and the cult members' surprise, he tries to leave the LOL assembly. But Dimple tries to convince him to stay, saying he's missing out on life if he keeps the same boring face. Shigeo reasoned people have different perceptions of \"missing out\" when his dad told him people are missing out in life when they refuse to smoke tobacco. Dimple challenges him to a staring contest against the three smiling LOL leaders. The game mechanic was to drink milk; the first one who laughs will lose.\n\nShigeo accepted the challenge because he likes milk. Shigeo easily defeated the three smiling LOL leaders, so Dimple decided to face him in the same game. But Dimple cheats, mixing a seemingly sour element with Shigeo's milk. Shigeo spits the milk out, to which Dimple declares Shigeo was laughing and lost the game. Shigeo insisted that he was wrong and that he didn't laugh, unconsciously canceling out the hypnosis Dimple placed on the LOL members. Dimple reapplied his hypnosis on the people while worried that Shigeo was canceling his powers. Dimple then told Shigeo to get a clue and laugh along with them.\n\nDimple tries to hypnotize Shigeo into laughter. But Shigeo retains his bored look. Shigeo realizes Dimple also has psychic powers as Dimple yells out, questioning if Shigeo is a corpse. He explained to Dimple that he couldn't make him laugh because Shigeo can't laugh even if he wanted to. Dimple concluded Shigeo doesn't have emotions and told Shigeo so. Dimple said this was the reason for Shigeo's problems with love, and that he'd be alone forever.\n\nDimple told him to laugh and chuckle with his cult. However, Shigeo's anger grew, and he dared Dimple to make him laugh using his psychic powers. Dimple grew nervous and realized he and Shigeo had the same powers. He decided to exterminate Shigeo, who'll stand in his way of being a god. Shigeo then found out that Dimple was an evil spirit. But, Dimple used his LOL followers to dog pile on top of Shigeo and immobilized him.\n\nAs a child, Shigeo realized his powers were dangerous and linked to his emotions, so he hid them to suppress his psychic abilities. This led to a complex as a result of his emotional suppression. But when his emotions became too great, they exploded out of him along with his psychic power, in which Shigeo's rage allowed him to use 100% of his psychic power.\n\nDimple left the human he was possessing and became a dark cloud. Shigeo escaped the dog pile by lifting the LOL members off him using his psychic powers. Shigeo challenged Dimple to kill him, saying that killing him might be easier than making him laugh. Dimple transforms into a muscled green humanoid, saying he only needs two seconds to kill Shigeo before attacking him. Shigeo defended by forming a barrier around himself, and Dimple attacked him again, but the second failed attempt caused Dimple to lose a hand and foot. Dimple regenerates his lost limbs and uses his full powers to attack Shigeo again. Shigeo retaliated by slicing off all of Dimple's limbs with his psychic power. As Dimple groaned in pain, Shigeo stepped on his face and uttered that his emotions were out upon Dimple's request. Shigeo stated that this was what happened when he let his emotions show and asked if Dimple was satisfied. Dimple questioned if Shigeo was some kind of monster before regenerating one of his arms and using it to push himself upward and use Wraither Beam on Shigeo, then regenerating all his limbs and transforming his arm into a huge knife. Dimple states that the battles he endured would decide the victor and loser before attacking Shigeo, who set up a barrier that snapped off Dimple's arm blade. Shigeo murmured he himself was terrible and exorcized Dimple with a tap on the forehead. Shigeo went back to the Spirits and Such Consultation Office where he told Reigen about the \"Get a clue\" incident, and Reigen just told him social norms were beyond him. Seeing Shigeo still sad, Reigen told Shigeo that he was the protagonist of his own life. Shigeo felt guilty about the dissolved LOL organization, and Reigen commented about Shigeo's destructive denseness. So Shigeo continued to sulk.\n\nTeruki Hanazawa Arc\n\nShigeo woke up one morning to find a small spirit in his room, which reintroduced itself as Dimple. Shigeo wanted to exorcize Dimple and asked Reigen for advice, but Reigen couldn't see Dimple. Dimple chuckles that Reigen wouldn't see him as if he was a fake. Reigen says Dimple was likely too weak to see, angering Dimple, and told Shigeo to do what he wanted. So Shigeo let Dimple hang around.\n\nShigeo found a poster of himself. The Psycho Helmet Religion, formerly the LOL religious group, looking for him and dubbing him as their god.\n\nShigeo found a letter in his shoe locker, and he thought it was a love letter even when Dimple deduced it wasn't. Despite Dimple stopping him, he went to Ankle Park anyway to meet the girl who wrote the letter, but he found Black Vinegar Middle School students there where they tied him up and took him, hostage, because of Tenga Onigawara. Dimple suggests Shigeo escape using his psychic powers, but Shigeo refuses, saying he won't use his powers on people.\n\nThe Body Improvement Club went to retrieve Shigeo from Black Vinegar Middle School. They defeated many of the Black Vinegar Middle School students. Still, they lost to Teruki (the shadow leader of Black Vinegar Middle School), who used his psychic powers to fight. Shigeo alone remained unaffected by Teru's attacks and told Teru not to use psychic powers on other people. Then, Shigeo used Telekinesis to escape his binds, shocking Teruki.\n\nTeru attacks Shigeo to absolutely no avail, but Shigeo only wants to be friends with him and remains on defense even as Teru continues to attack him. Shigeo refused to fight back by using his psychic powers, remembering Reigen's advice. Dimple decided to fight Teru instead, but Teru exorcized the spirit. Shigeo initially didn't mind that Dimple was exorcized but changed his mind when Teru looked down on the spirit.\n\nTeru continued to attack Shigeo, and they reached the home economics room, where Teru used telekinesis on the knives. Shigeo defended using psychic powers on the knives and cut the hair on top of Teru's head, this angered Teru, and he attacked Shigeo relentlessly again. Shigeo realized Teru wanted to defeat him because Shigeo being an esper like Teru, makes Teru seem average. Teru choked him with his hands, but Shigeo refused to retaliate by using his psychic powers.\n\nShigeo remembered a time when he and Ritsu Kageyama were younger. Three older guys took their New Year's money before they hurt him and Ritsu. But Shigeo had blacked out, waking up to find Ritsu and the bullies hurt.\n\nTeruki ends up choking Shigeo to the point of unconsciousness, which proves to be a fatal mistake on Teruki's part as an unknown and powerful force awakens within Shigeo and controls his body. It defeated Teru easily and destroyed the Black Vinegar School building. When he regained consciousness, Shigeo cried at his inability to change. His psychic powers went berserk and caused an accident because of his emotions. His sadness reached 100%, and he used it to fix the Black Vinegar school campus. He was about to apologize to Teru, but he was interrupted. The Body Improvement club checked on his well-being, and he went back with them.\n\nBig Cleanup Arc\n\nWhile climbing up one of the school's staircases, Shigeo was approached by Tenga Onigawara where he soon apologized to Shigeo because of the incident in the Black Vinegar Middle School; it wasn't without incident; however, as he was soon interrupted by Shigeo, where he then immediately lashed out at him, despite apologizing. When Yamazaki tried to justify the outburst, he soon found himself getting pummeled again by Onigawara, enraged at being called an idiot again.\n\nLater, Shigeo went on his \"date\" with Tome. He found an adult esper, but didn't approach the person because he felt sickened.\n\nA lady from the street tried to sell Vase of Happiness to him. He refused, not having the amount to buy the very expensive vase. The lady then made it look like Shigeo cracked the vase and forced him to pay for the damage. Reigen called Shigeo on his phone and went to retrieve his apprentice. They ate dinner and talked about how terrible con artists are.\n\nHe later saw Ritsu Kageyama in an alley after Ritsu defeated the delinquents looking for White T Poison.\n\n7th Division Arc\n\nShigeo discovers that Ritsu has psychic powers and is happy he has them before Megumu attacks him and his brother. Shigeo attacks the esper, but a cursed cologne knocks him out. However, he, or rather ???%, stood up again, terrifying Koyama, and prompting him to flee with Ritsu in hand.\n\nHe teams up with Teruki Hanazawa and Dimple to save Ritsu and the Awakening Lab kids from Claw.\n\nMob's Girlfriend Mini-Arc\n\nShigeo is convinced by Ichi Mezato to participate in an election for the new Student Council president. Unfortunately, he froze up during his speech and took the last place. However, after that, Emi tells him she was impressed by his bravery.\n\nUrban Legends Arc\n\nDue to slow business, Shigeo and Reigen decide to go check out urban legends, where they run into Banshomaru, and they team up to confront the urban legends. They eventually confront the Dragger, and Shigeo exorcises her. He ends up being traumatized after he fails to outrun a granny.\n\nKeiji Mogami Arc\n\nAfter taking 3 jobs involving a man trying to place a curse on someone, an Esper using his power to be a peeper, and college kids wanting him to exorcise innocent spirits, Shigeo begins to wonder if someone could stop him if he abused his powers like the people in those instances did.\n\nShigeo, along with Reigen and Dimple, comes at the request of Masashi Asagiri. The businessman explains that an evil spirit has taken possession of his daughter, and after a game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, Reigen is the first to go in and talk to her. After an initial conversation, the other psychics believe that no evil spirits possess Minori. Still, Reigen contradicts them, explaining her suspicious behavior and how he called him a psychic despite never introducing himself. With her act exposed, Minori begins to attack the other psychics. After severely injuring Minori's father, Shigeo decides to intervene and stops Mogami from attacking Banshomaru by restraining him with his telekinesis. Shigeo releases her when Keiji begins twisting Minori's body beyond its natural limits. Enraged at his disregard for Minori's safety and cruel nature, Shigeo attempts to exorcise Mogami and expel him from Minori. Unfortunately, his burst of energy causes Mogami to entrench himself deeper into Minori's body. He laments to his master that he's only made things worse, proclaiming Mogami to be stronger than him.\n\nShigeo tries to chase him out from the inside by leaving his body. After asking Dimple to take over his body while he's gone, Mob projects his soul outside of his body and enters Minori's body. Upon entering the mental realm, he's greeted by Mogami, and after asking Mogami to leave Minori's body, the evil spirit launches an energy attack, which is blocked by Mob's barrier. Mogami then begins to telekinetically choke Mob, with the esper retaliating by firing a barrage of psychic blasts that rip Mogami's limbs apart. As Mob prepares to finish Mogami, the evil spirit asks where every incarnation of psychic powers comes from, revealing they come from feelings. Suddenly, Mogami appears behind Shigeo, completely unharmed while punching him in the face, putting his foot over the esper's cheek while continuing his explanation of psychic energy originating from emotions, specifically negative emotions. Mogami states that Mob can become much stronger than he already is, but merely needs to change how he looks at the world. The evil spirit offers to help him, putting him in a mental mindscape where Mob has no powers, friends, family, or anyone from his regular life.\n\nSeparate Ways Arc\n\nMob has a falling out with Reigen, and they go their separate ways.\n\nWorld Domination Arc\n\nShigeo decides to participate in the school marathon and finish it in at least 10th position. Unfortunately, he suffers a leg injury and passes out. After he wakes up, the marathon is already over. He heads home, but he discovers that someone burned down his house. Much to the horror of onlookers, he goes inside, concerned about his parents and Ritsu Kageyama. Dimple explains that it appeared as though someone forced their way in, worrying Shigeo even more, and he looks for clues, fearing his parents and Ritsu were kidnapped. He opens another door and stares in horror at what he believed were the burning corpses of his family. As Dimple pleads for Shigeo to close his eyes, Shigeo is driven mad at the sight, his emotional gauge far exceeding 100% and reaching ???% as he remembers his family. Shigeo clenches his teeth, and his bones start cracking with rage and psychic force, but Dimple says that he is certain that these bodies are dummies. Shigeo's gauge drops to 100%, and he becomes obsessed with finding the culprit. He uses Spiritual Awareness and finds some espers near his house.\n\nShigeo jumps out of nowhere before two Claw soldiers before beating them to the point of unconsciousness in front of a crowd of people. Then suddenly, Megumu and Yusuke appear, inviting Shigeo to their car. After hearing of a gathering with Reigen, Shigeo makes the car fly and get there as soon as possible.\n\nDimple explains the situation to Reigen and others who gathered in Kenji's place. Reigen tells Shigeo that he is sure that his parents and Ritsu are okay. Shigeo relaxes after hearing that, and instantly starts sleeping, with his emotional gauge at 2%.\n\nHe wakes up the next day, just after Dimple's fight with Hiroshi. He sees Shibata coming at Musashi, defeating him with telekinesis.\n\nHe later fights Toshiki and stops Keiji from killing them.\n\nHe later duels with Toichiro, and after a lengthy and life-threatening battle, he defeats him.\n\nDivine Tree Arc\n\nThe broccoli tree's power that came from the explosion during the battle of Shigeo and Toichiro was absorbed by Dimple to fulfill his wish to become a god. Having heard of this Shigeo convinces dimple to stop with what he is doing, and even refrains from using his psychic powers during their talk.\n\nTelepathy Club Mini-Arc\n\nShigeo recruits the Shiratori brothers to help look for aliens with their powers.\n\n???% Arc\n\nAfter hearing that Tsubomi Takane will be moving out, Shigeo finally decides to confess to her. He buys a flower bouquet to give her, but after he realizes how little he can afford, Toshiki Minegishi offers to trade him a larger one instead. On his way to Tsubomi, he saves a child from being hit by a car, but he gets hit instead. When blood starts to flow from his head, ???% takes control of his body and continues the path to Tsubomi.\n\nREIGEN Arc\n\nShigeo exorcises the Mimic spirit that impersonated him and tried to kill Reigen.\n\nEpilogue\n\nAfter a few months, Shigeo becomes vice-president of the Body Improvement Club, where he first welcomes new students. Then, he walks with Ritsu and Teruki to Reigen's birthday party. Shigeo is shown to be fully emotive and emotionally free, indicating he has finally outgrown the need to repress his emotions.\n\nPowers & Abilities\n\nAt first glance, Shigeo is an average middle school student. Initially, Shigeo was very physically unfit and incapable, having no bodily coordination, a lack of stamina, and surprisingly low muscular strength. However, after joining the Body Improvement Club, his physical capabilities grew greatly, although they are still relatively below average for someone his age. He isn't very skilled at his schoolwork either and gets flustered whenever teachers call on him to answer questions in class.\n\nHowever, Shigeo's true strength lies in his phenomenal psychic powers, which outclass those of almost every other esper in the series. He is arguably the most powerful esper in the series, rivaled only by Keiji Mogami and Toichiro Suzuki. He has a tremendous capacity for storing psychic energy, which he primarily uses to fuel his already existing powers. Due to his belief that psychic powers are not to be used against others, he has done little combat training and does not specialize in any specific type of ESP. Despite this, he still has various techniques at his disposal. He is actually able to learn new techniques rather easily, as seen when he learned how to use chlorokinesis during his battle with the farm spirit, when he managed to project his spirit out of his body after only seeing it a single time, and when he learned how to track the energy of other espers when he entered his 100% Obsession state, something that Dimple noted. However, he still relies most heavily on simple things such as telekinesis and barrier creation in combat. Toichiro, who has traveled the world, never encountered an esper on Shigeo's level before.[3][4] Shigeo's psychic aura is usually blue, but can sometimes show shades of pink and purple. It also has a polygonal pattern.\n\nMob's Abilities Telekinesis\n\nShigeo possesses immeasurably potent telekinesis. With it, he can move extremely heavy objects, such as entire buildings, pin an entire crowd to a ceiling, create nearly impenetrable force-fields, fly, augment his physical strength and speed, disassemble matter and reconstruct it on a molecular level. Psychic Energy Absorption\n\nShigeo possesses the ability to drain energy from other espers, energy-based attacks aimed at him, and even the environment around him and add it to his own. So far, Shigeo only exhibited this ability while at 100% or at ???%. When absorbing energy that originated from other espers, he can also absorb some of their emotions. This is shown when Shigeo absorbs Katsuya's attack and feels his sadness.[5] It is even possible for the emotion that he absorbs to overwhelm him to the point that he feels that emotion at 100%, such as when he absorbed Toichiro Suzuki's attacks and entered Ecstasy 100% due to his influence.[6] His holding capacity is extremely high as well, since he was able to fully absorb all the psychic energy Toichiro had released and still survived. However, the process caused him great pain, and he could barely survive. Shigeo has exhibited this ability while in \"subconsciously\" ???% mode.[7] Psychic Energy Transference\n\nShigeo has the ability to energize others with his power, both espers and non-espers. In the case of the latter, it bleeds out quickly since their bodies can't contain their power for very long, and is of limited use unless the person already knows how to use psychic powers. However, even a non-esper can have basic abilities such as a protective barrier for the duration of this effect. This is first shown when Shigeo reaches Gratitude 100% and temporarily relinquishes his powers to Reigen.[8] He is also able to transfer his memories and emotions along with the energy, as shown when Shigeo relayed his feelings of friendship to Katsuya Serizawa.[9] Later on, Shigeo is shown using this technique without being at 100% when he recharged Sho Suzuki's energy after the latter's fight against his father.[10] Chlorokinesis\n\nShigeo eventually learns to imbue his psychic energy into plants enabling him to manipulate them and cause them to grow and mature at will.[11] Spiritual Awareness\n\nShigeo can sense the psychic energy of spirits and other espers. He can widen his \"antennae\" up to 20 kilometers to sense the presence of other nearby espers.[12] Astral Projection\n\nShigeo can will his soul/spirit to leave his physical body, appearing as a floating Axolotl-like creature.[13] He can also enter the bodies and minds of others,[14] though whether or not he can completely possess people is currently unknown.\n\nShigeo's Progress Towards Explosion\n\nNote: Shigeo's Meter measures the amount of Psychic Powers being released rather than his Emotion or Heartbeat Rate; the % meter also has a connection to quickly releasing Psychic Energy at an Alarming or Steady Rate.\n\nDue to a childhood incident involving his psychic powers, Shigeo has subconsciously sealed away his emotions to control his psychic abilities better. However, there is a limit to how much of his emotions he can keep bottled up. Once he reaches his limit, all the power he kept suppressed will explode, giving him a significant boost in his psychic abilities.\n\nThe progression toward Shigeo's explosion is visually depicted with a percentage labeled \"Shigeo's Progress Towards Explosion\" that eventually reaches 100%. The more emotional stimuli Shigeo experiences, the faster his limit will be reached. After Shigeo's psychic explosion has been completed, the counter of his emotional limit will reset back to 0%.\n\nWhen Shigeo explodes, how he uses his enhanced power depends on the emotion he feels when he reaches his limit. The emotions that have been displayed at 100% so far include:\n\n100% Anger / Rage - After being taunted by Dimple and the (LOL) Cult, and later after Toichiro attempts to kill Reigen and disrespects Serizawa. This resulted in Shigeo becoming serious about fighting.\n\n100% Sadness - After going into ???% mode in his battle with Teru, resulting in the destruction of Black Vinegar Middle School.[15][16] Resulted in Shigeo crying and putting the school back together.\n\n100% Hostility / Animosity - After watching the violent and callous treatment of Ritsu and the other middle schoolers by Koyama.[17] Resulted in Shigeo beginning a brutal beatdown of his attacker.\n\n100% Rejection - While being forcibly shown an illusion of Ritsu in a pool of blood by Muto.[18] Resulted in Shigeo frying Muto's brain with psychic energy in retaliation.\n\n99% Murderous Intent - Although not a true 100% state, this was nearly achieved, reaching 99%. In this state, Shigeo became utterly ruthless and cold-blooded, prepared to kill his opponents as long as the people he cared about were safe, and he was shown wickedly smiling. Thankfully, Reigen stopped him at the last second, and his master's words changed his energy and emotions to 1000% Gratitude.\n\n1000% Gratitude - When Reigen tried to protect Shigeo by telling him it was okay to run from the battle with the 7th Division.[8] Resulted in Shigeo temporarily transferring his powers to Reigen, who is at \"1000%.\"\n\n100% Courage - While fighting Mogami to save Minori Asagiri, and later while fighting Toichiro and resolving to fight to protect his friends and family.[19] Resulted in Shigeo gaining a more bishounen appearance. This is Shigeo's most powerful 100% state, since he was able to momentarily fight on par with Suzuki at 100% while he was struggling greatly before with just 50% of Suzuki's power.\n\n100% Tenacity / Obsession - After identifying the Claw espers who supposedly burned down his home and kidnapped his family. Resulted in Shigeo going on a single-minded rampage to track down said espers and find out where they took his family and how they made the dummies at his house.\n\n100% Friendship - After learning about Serizawa's sad backstory and being willing to be his friend. This resulted in Shigeo absorbing Serizawa's energy blast and throwing it back at him to let Serizawa understand Shigeo's own sad backstory.\n\n100% Ecstasy - While being influenced by Toichiro's own emotions of ecstasy during their battle.[6] Resulted in Shigeo laughing hysterically and flying erratically, enjoying the thrill of the battle. He momentarily allowed himself to get carried away in this state but stopped when he saw Ritsu's fear of looking at him.\n\n100% Shame - After realizing he let himself get carried away with his psychic powers in his battle against Suzuki.[20] Resulted in Shigeo groveling and hiding in the clouds.\n\n100% Compassion - After realizing how sad Toichiro's life must really be and feeling sorry for him during their battle.[21] Resulted in Shigeo crying and trying to crush Toichiro with buildings quickly.\n\n100% Resignation - After deciding that Toichiro could not be convinced to stop, he had no choice but to stop him by force.[22] Resulted in Shigeo brutally contorting Toichiro's body in an attempt to leave him physically unable to go on.\n\n100% Kindness - After deciding to stay with Toichiro in his supposed final moments and attempt to save him from his ghastly fate. Resulted in Shigeo creating a barrier around himself and Suzuki and trying to absorb his energy overload.\n\n100% Getting Carried Away - After noticing how many girls were talking to him and how much attention he received compared to usual. It didn't result in any psychic occurrences, but it led to Shigeo growing insensitive and disregarding Dimple's feelings when he talked to him about the Divine Tree.\n\n100% Trust - After deciding not to use his powers against Dimple in the Divine Tree and to trust him instead. This resulted in Shigeo temporarily throwing away his psychic powers, being completely unable to use them at all. This led to Dimple re-collecting his senses, dropping the desire to be a god.\n\n100% Shigeo Kageyama - After Arataka told Shigeo the truth about his actions. Shigeo was able to tame ???, despite having taken his latter, and managed to come to terms with one another. Shigeo was finally able to show emotion again without his psychic powers lashing out, able to live a normal life once more.\n\n???%\n\nMain article: ???\n\n\"???%\" is a special state that Shigeo occasionally enters when he becomes unconscious under extreme stress, or when his physical vessel is destroyed. When ???% is active, Shigeo can unleash virtually limitless psychic energy, allowing him to achieve a level of psychic strength far beyond his 100% explosions. Also it should be noted that Mob has a 100% explosion in this form as well.\n\nThe major downside of this power is that Shigeo completely loses control of himself while it’s active, and his basic instincts take over. This runs the risk of Shigeo doing something that he would regret.[7]\n\nQuotes\n\nCatchphrase: \"I don't really get it.\"[1]\n\n(Shigeo to Ritsu Kageyama) \"Psychic powers aren't needed to survive in the first place.\"[23]\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Shigeo means \"lush, luxuriant\" (茂) (shige) and \"man, husband\" (夫) (o).\n\nThe kanji for his forename Shigeo can alternatively be read as \"Mob\", which the Character Guidebook confirms as the source of his nickname. [24]\n\nShigeo's surname Kageyama means \"shadow, shade, other side\" (影) (kage) and \"mountain, hill\" (山) (yama).\n\nNotes & Trivia\n\nShigeo's favorite foods are takoyaki, milk and ramen and his least favorite foods are cilantro, shiokara and locusts.[1]\n\nApparently, Shigeo's specialty is making dogs float, and his hobby is watching the sky.[1]\n\nShigeo's favorite music is cheerful sounding ones, and his favorite movie genre is action.[1]\n\nShigeo's facial expression looks just like ONE's character Saitama.\n\nONE has stated that Tatsumaki, the strongest esper from the One-Punch Man series, could, in fact, beat normal Shigeo, but if Shigeo gets serious then there is no answer.[25]\n\nDespite Shigeo's crush on Tsubomi Takane, the two have made very few interactions with each other.\n\nShigeo is one of the only two espers who has the ability to absorb and transfer psychic energy with the other being Toichiro Suzuki. Because of this, Suzuki viewed Shigeo as his greatest enemy.[26]\n\nShigeo gives ONE the impression that when people invite him out during summer break, he follows along with them, regardless of if their activities take place indoors or outdoors. However, when he is alone, he lies on his side and looks out at the sky through the window.[27]\n\nJason Liebrecht takes over the role for Shigeo in Season 3 after Kyle McCarley (Shigeo's Season 1-2 English voice actor) made an announcement that he would no longer voice Shigeo in September 2022 (Video).\n\nReferences\n\nNavigation"
