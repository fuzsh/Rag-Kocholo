        "text": "We are all tickled to see our jobs portrayed on the screen and gangsters get tickled more than most because there are more gangster films. Many more. The process is circular, however: not only do gangsters' lives inspire the movies, the movies inspire those lives. It is a fascinating example of the influence of art, if not quite its redemptive power.\n\nA fine local example was revealed in 2007 when police released an email from Natasha Moradian to her husband, the West Pennant Hills drug boss Alen \"Fathead\" Moradian. Natasha was upset because Fathead had been attracting attention to the family cocaine import and distribution business by boasting.\n\n\"Why do you just sit there and show off – 'I am the man, I am the man.' Do you see Tony Soprano doing that?\" she wrote. (It remains unclear why she needed to have this heart-to-heart by email.) \"He points it all off on a junior for a reason, to take the heat away from him. He doesn't care who people think is the boss – papers [that is, money] is his No. 1 priority. You on the other hand want the attention, you get a big head, you love it. People like that won't survive.\"\n\nNatasha was wrong about Tony Soprano's need for respect but right about the rest; in fact, Fathead is now doing time for drug importation. And she was not the first to regard The Sopranos as an instructional video: one recalls Jason Bautista being jailed in California in 2005 for killing his mother. Bautista told the court he decapitated her and cut off her hands after learning how a victim's identity could be disguised from The Sopranos. (The show's early theme of great, if tormented, filial love seems to have had less influence on him.)\n\nSomeone in the US actually wrote a self-help book based on Tony Soprano's leadership style, which raises the prospect that captains of industry are now running their enterprises in the way the Mafia is run. But this, too, is circular because, as many observers have noted, mob films and television programs are often about much more than criminals. Indeed, one of their sources of inspiration is the brutal behaviour of Hollywood moguls (see box). In the words of Mario Puzo, who wrote The Godfather in 1969: \"Motion pictures are the most crooked business that I've ever had any experience with. You can get a better shake in Vegas than you can get in Hollywood.\"\n\nYou might think mobsters would resent being portrayed as evil on screen but this is not the case. In his illuminating Codes of the Underworld (2009), Oxford academic Diego Gambetta has pointed out that gangsters want people to be scared of them, so movies that make them look scary are good for business. They build the brand. He has found only one case where a filmmaker was punished for a mob film: the slashing of Juzo Itami in 1992 for his Minbo no Onna. But the issue there was not that the director made the Yakuza look evil but that he made them look incompetent.\n\nThe first Godfather film is the most influential mob movie, although not because of its authenticity. In at least three main areas – the dominance of family, the prevalence of honour and the refusal to sell drugs – it is seriously misleading, indeed grossly sentimental. For this reason, as Tim Adler notes in his 2007 book, Hollywood and the Mob (Bloomsbury), The Godfather \"changed the way the Mafia regarded itself and, for many, rehabilitated gangsters into men of honour instead of what they really were – pig-ignorant, violent-sentimental goombahs. It perpetuated the myth of honour among thieves at a time when the real Mafia was being eaten away by rat informants more concerned about saving their own skins than keeping omerta.\"\n\nNo wonder gangsters liked it so much. A lot has been copied from it and its sequels. The scene in which the Mafia dress up as doctors to enter a hospital and kill a patient has been reproduced in Italy (where a Mafia chief admitted taking the idea from the novel) and in Hong Kong.\n\nIn May 1991, building contractors in Palermo found a severed horse's head in the company car; 10 years later, a foreman at a shipyard received the same gift. This was, of course, copied from what is probably The Godfather's most famous scene; although, to be fair, this might have been inspired by a real case in 1956, when a man engaged in a turf war in Palermo received the severed head of his German shepherd. The wheel of influence, as always, rotates between life and art.\n\nThe Mafia even copied the language of The Godfather. Although a lot of this was invented for the film, it became authentic. The lieutenant of US Mafia boss John Gotti, supergrass Sammy \"the Bull\" Gravano, told police how he would use lines such as \"I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse\" and \"If you have an enemy, that enemy becomes my enemy\". (Other gangster films have also contributed to the language. For example, \"You can dish it out but you can't take it\" comes from 1931's Little Caesar.)\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola said he didn't want to glorify the Mafia in The Godfather but on Gravano's evidence, he failed. \"It made our life seem honourable,\" the killer said. \"It was a validation of everything we believed in . . . I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, everybody, who felt exactly the same way.\"\n\nLaw-enforcement wiretaps reveal many mobsters around the globe have memorised large chunks of the film's dialogue. One FBI agent claimed this gave a voice to inarticulate men, providing them with \"a whole range of ready-made things to say when they wanted to sound tough, sincere, righteous or even wise\". This, of course, has always been one of the roles of art.\n\nThe reach of The Godfather is faithfully reflected in The Sopranos, whose characters are fans and sometimes act out scenes. The show's creator, David Chase, observes: \"The Godfather is everything to [the Mafia]. It's their Bible, their Koran. Their Mona Lisa, their Eiffel Tower.\"\n\nGambetta provides examples of other films influencing gangsters. At the trial of John Gotti and co-defendant Frank Locascio, the latter's son, Salvatore, yelled out in court, \"This is America! Haven't they heard of the Bill of Rights?\" These stirring words come from the Al Capone character in a 1959 movie. But the influence applies not only to tactics. Capone himself and his mob based their clothes – hat and suits – on the 1912 film The Musketeers of Pig Alley and the use of dark glasses by gangsters seems to have come from the movies, too.\n\nAdler reminds us that in The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler says one thug's voice \"was the elaborately casual voice of the tough guy in pictures . . . pictures have made them all like that\". British gangster Reggie Kray told his tailor to make him a copy of the clothes worn by George Raft, who starred in the 1932 version of Scarface, a film based loosely on Al Capone. Adler, too, notes how criminals take language from the movies; indeed, the term \"godfather\" to describe a Mafia boss was invented by Mario Puzo.\n\nMobster Joey Gallo based his body language on the gangster films of Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson. Just before he was shot in 1972, he spent the evening with an actor who was to play him in a film and wanted to know how to walk and talk like a gangster. Adler observes: \"The barrier between the Mafia in reality and movie fiction had grown increasingly permeable over the years. Art was imitating life imitating art.\"\n\nGambetta suggests films are an important means of criminal communication because the movies take a type of behaviour associated with gangsters at one place and show it to gangsters everywhere. He quotes a Russian organised crime expert who said, \"When the leaders of the Soviet wanted to see how to bribe, blackmail, embezzle, hijack and smuggle more efficiently, they found ready-made lessons available. They watched American crime movies.\"\n\nAustralian crooks, and former crooks, enjoy mob movies and TV shows as much as their American colleagues. Police have found posters of The Sopranos in the homes of Melbourne mobsters. Early this year, I visited Karl Bonnette, described in the 1970s as Sydney's godfather (a title he rejects), and there was a framed poster of Brian De Palma's Scarface remake in his billiard room.\n\nIt's always the Americans. I can't think of a local production that has influenced real criminals. Underbelly hasn't contributed anything, except perhaps a bit of glitter. Even the best, such as Phoenix and Blue Murder, are more journalistic than imaginative. If American culture was like ours, The Godfather would never have been published. It would have been rejected for its grotesque stereotyping of an ethnic minority and its manifold untruths that had no place in reality. But being published, by a culture with more capacity for fantasy than our own, it created its own reality.\n\nOne of the strangest stories about the intersection of art and crime involves another novel. In 2000, a corpse was found in a river in Poland and police were baffled by the murder. Some years later – as David Grann recorded in The New Yorker – the name of intellectual Krystian Bala came up in their investigation, although not as a strong suspect. Then, a detective discovered that, in 2003, Bala had published a novel called Amok, in which (wait for it) a Polish intellectual commits a murder and gets away with it.\n\nThe case was a sensation in Poland, with one magazine commenting, \"Killing doesn't make much of an impression in the 21st century but allegedly killing and then writing about it in a novel is front-page news.\"\n\nBala protested his innocence but was convicted of murder in 2007. He is reported to be working on a novel about another killing.\n\nThe meaning of crime\n\nJust as Shakespeare's historical dramas aren't only about history, crime films — at their best — are about more than crime. The surge of clever television drama also uses the entertainment value of crime to explore other themes.\n\nThe Sopranos is about Americans' loss of confidence. When Tony tells his therapist, \"Lately, I get the feeling that I came in too late, that the best is over,\" she says a lot of people feel that way — not just the Mafia.\n\nThe undervalued The Shield is about moral ambiguity while The Wire (pictured) is a powerful critique of the war on drugs (and much else). Breaking Bad looks at entrapment and death and Sons of Anarchy, nominally about bikies, concerns the need to belong. Even when gangster films are not at their best, they are still about ruthless A-type males, who are hardly unique to the criminal world.\n\nHere is Raymond Chandler reflecting on this broader relevance after seeing some Hollywood executives walking on a lot: \"I happened to see the big boys strolling back from lunch. I was transfixed with a sinister delight. They looked exactly like a bunch of Chicago gangsters moving in to read the death sentence on a beaten competitor. It brought home to me the strange kinship between the operations of big business and the rackets. Same faces, expressions, same manners.\""
