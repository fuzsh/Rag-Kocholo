Called “one of the most realistic and honest accounts of the Mafia ever put on film,” Rob the Mob is the true-life story of Rosie and Tommy Uva, an unlikely – and unlucky – crime duo who specialize in robbing Mafia-run social clubs, a specialty that gets them in hot water with the Mob and the FBI. With an all-star cast including Michael Pitt, Andy Garcia, Ray Romano and Nina Arianda, this Mob comedy is a must-see film for any Mafia movie fan.

Rob the Mob was written by veteran screenwriter and producer Jonathan Fernandez, who will join us for a talk prior to the movie screening.
