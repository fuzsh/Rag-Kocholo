The Mob is the name of the crew founded by Sean and Eddy in Step Up 4 Revolution to participate at contest organized by YouTube. They disturb public order by dancing in restaurants, museum or business building and film themselves to earn views. They manage to reach the first place with approximately 9 million and a half views but are finally disqualified after Bill Anderson filed a complaint.
