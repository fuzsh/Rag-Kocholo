Mike Winter, Executive Director of Christian Businessmen's Committee (CBMC) of Mid-Michigan, offered the following invocation:

I want to begin with a reading from Luke 22. A dispute arose among the disciples as to which of them was considered to be the greatest. Jesus said to them, "The kings of people lorded over them, and those who exercise authority called themselves benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the least, and the one who rules like the one who serves."

O God, thank You this morning that we can gather first under the name of Jesus Christ, and in His name, we pray that we be public servants. I pray that these people of Yours serve You and the people of Michigan.

Lord, I pray their recess was refreshing. Now, Lord, I ask that You give them wisdom like You gave the men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do. Lord, give them wisdom. I pray for a spirit of unity as well. Lord, may there be conciliation among these members of the Senate.

Thank You for this opportunity to recognize You. Fill their hearts and minds with a servant heart and wisdom from above. In Jesus' name. Amen.

Department of Consumer and Industry Services

July 1, 1999

In accordance with Public Act 304 of 1982, the attached 1998 Annual Report of the Michigan Utility Consumer Representation Fund is transmitted to the Legislature.

The state's largest public utilities were required, pursuant to this Act, to pay a total of $848,500 to fund intervention in selected gas cost recovery (GCR) and electric power system cost recovery (PSCR) proceedings before the Michigan Public Service Commission. The assessments upon the utilities are recognized by the PSC as a cost of service for rate making purposes. Thus, the funds forwarded by the utilities originate from ratepayers, not utility investors.

In 1998 grant recipients funded by the Utility Consumer Participation Board reported savings to ratepayers of $21,000,000. These actions were the results of intervention efforts either by the grantees alone or in conjunction with other parties.

Half of the funds received by the Board are allocated by statute to the Office of Attorney General, while the remaining half is made available for competitive grants to non-profit organizations seeking to intervene in GCR and PSCR matters before the PSC. In 1998 the Board awarded $384,800 for intervention and awarded $403,037.50 to the Attorney General for his participation in matters jurisdictional to P.A. 304.

Since the passage of P.A. 304 there have been some significant developments regarding GCRs and PSCRs. Within the past two years, the PSC has suspended the operation of GCRs for Michigan Consolidated Gas and Consumers Energy. The PSC also has suspended PSCRs for Consumers Energy and Edison Sault Electric, while a request for suspension by Detroit Edison was filed and withdrawn, but may be filed again.

The Board suspects that this outcome was not envisioned by the Legislature when it constructed Act 304. It may be that you will want to look into this matter before the next round of grant applications is solicited in April, 2000.

Sincerely,

Utility Consumer Participation Board

I am pleased to present the report on Pollution Prevention (P2) Impacts and Costs of Materials Accounting (MA) and Toxics Use Reporting (TUR) Programs of Other States and the Federal Government. This report is being submitted to the Governor and the Legislature in accordance with Section 14510(2) of Part 145, Waste Reduction Assistance, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended.

The report evaluates mandated MA and TUR programs of the states of Massachusetts and New Jersey (the two states that have these programs) and the federal government. The report looks at the impact of these programs on fostering P2 and the cost of the programs. This report defines TUR as the amount of toxic chemicals imported, produced, processed, or otherwise used at the facility. MA is used to describe a method of reporting the collection and analysis of the input and output of toxic chemicals at a facility.

I trust the members of the Senate will find this report informative. If you have comments or questions about this report, please contact Mr. Paul Zugger, Chief, Environmental Assistance Division, at 517-241-0490, or you may contact me.

Michigan Supreme Court

July 20, 1999

Enclosed please find the 1998 Citizen Advisory Committee Annual Report to the Legislature.

Public Act 366 of 1996 established Citizen Advisory Committees in each county. Among the statutory duties of citizen advisory committees is the requirement of submitting an annual report of activities. The act also requires the Friend of the Court Bureau of the State Court Administrative Office to prepare an evaluative summary of the activities and functioning of each citizen advisory committee; the aggregate of all citizen advisory committees; and identification of problems that impede the efficiency and functioning of the citizen advisory committees. We have developed a report on the activities of Citizen Advisory Committees as a supplement to the Annual Grievance Report that was previously submitted to the Legislature. Both the grievance report and the executive summary include information gathered in a one-year period ending in December of each year.

The State Court Administrative Office, Friend of the Court Bureau provides technical assistance to citizen advisory committees. This includes development of an informational brochure, telephone consultations with committee members and others, regular contact with county executives and boards of commissioners. The Bureau also developed annual reporting forms for use by the citizen advisory committees for their activities.

Also included in the executive summary is a copy of Public Act 551 allowing Citizens Advisory Committees access to Friend of the Court files.

This office welcomes any questions or suggestions regarding the status of citizen advisory committees or the evaluative summary.

Public Policy Associates Incorporated

September 3, 1999

I herewith submit the report of the Boating Access Site Advisory Committee, as mandated by Public Act 210 of 1998.

The complexity of issues and concerns surrounding boating access sites prompted the formation of a public boating access site advisory committee (BASAC) in accordance with Public Act 210 of 1998, which I sponsored. The committee was charged with advising the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), the Legislature, and the Michigan State Waterways Commission on the state's method of acquiring and operating public boating access sites by reviewing and making recommendations regarding current methods. The committee devised additional recommendations, as provided by P.A. 210. The advisory committee consisted of 18 members representing the boating industry, recreational users, riparian owners, local public officials who have public boating access sites within their local unit of government, higher education, and the general public.

On behalf of BASAC, I proudly submit the enclosed final report that is the result of three committee meetings, and collaborative revision and editing. The recommendations in this final report were reached by consensus at the third committee meeting and through compromise by all the diverse organizations involved. However, the recent Supreme Court decision on Burt Township versus the MDNR ultimately impacted some members' willingness to support the previously formed consensus on the recommendations presented in the report.

Since consensus dissolved after the Supreme Court decision, all members were invited to attach letters explaining their positions, commenting on the report's content, discussing the process involved in developing the report, and recommending any other specific changes to or improvements in the boating access site policymaking process. I am extremely pleased that the result of this process is 14 of the 18 members lending their support to the report and uniting in their efforts to significantly impact the future of boating access site policy.

We hope that this final report is carefully reviewed and its recommendations are seriously considered during the policy and decision-making process regarding boating access site issues in the future.

Sincerely,

Penny M. Crissman

Former State Representative, 45th District

APPROPRIATIONS; MILITARY AND VETERANS AFFAIRS

July 1, 1999

Today I have signed Enrolled Senate Bill 369, the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bill for the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.

This bill will complete the Fiscal Year 2000 budget for the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. My action today:

* Contains $2 million general fund creating a tuition assistance program. The program is designed to offset tuition costs for National Guard members enrolled in any course of instruction offered at Michigan colleges and universities.

* Provides $2.8 million, including $840,000 state commitment, for the ChalleNGe program, creating a new bootcamp type program to serve high school drop-outs between the ages of 16 and 18 as part of a nationwide effort to make the National Guard a more active presence in the community through assistance to at-risk youth.

* Increases state funding for veterans' service organizations by 3 percent with special consideration for the advocacy efforts of the American Legion.

* Provides state funding to assist county veterans' counselors in attending training programs sponsored by the Veterans' Affairs Directorate.

This bill supports the operations of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for Fiscal Year 2000. I commend the Legislature for its prompt action and cooperation in completing this budget.

APPROPRIATIONS; STATE POLICE

July 8, 1999

Today I have signed Enrolled Senate Bill 371, the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bill for the Department of State Police. This bill will complete the Fiscal Year 2000 budget for the Department of State Police. My action today:

* Contains funding for a trooper recruit school, beginning in August 2000, resulting in 1,031 enlisted men and women trained during the past eight years.

* Increases funding for secondary road patrol grants to county sheriff departments by $1.3 million, a 61 percent increase since 1990.

* Includes $1 million for additional detectives, increasing investigations of child protective service cases, incidents occurring within Department of Corrections facilities and other crimes against Michigan citizens.

* Provides $339,400 general fund for the Uniform Services program, relieving troopers and sergeants of clerical tasks, allowing more involvement in community policing and improving supervision of new recruits.

* Includes full-year costs for casino gaming oversight responsibilities of the Criminal Investigations unit.

This bill supports the operations of the Department of State Police for Fiscal Year 2000. I commend the Legislature for its cooperation in completing this budget.

APPROPRIATIONS; AGRICULTURE

July 8, 1999

Today I have signed Enrolled Senate Bill 357, the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture. My action today:

* Increases second-year funding of Project GREEEN (Generating Research and Extension to meet Economic and Environmental Needs) to $6.1 million aimed at producing innovative solutions to emerging plant agriculture issues.

* Contains $60,000 for Future Farmers of America, a 50 percent increase in state support for awards and leadership activities directed by Michigan State University to encourage farming and agriculture as a career.

* Provides $550,000 for migrant labor housing construction grants, helping farmers to provide adequate housing for migrant labor farm families.

* Commits an additional $100,000 of state support to promote the export of Michigan food and agricultural products.

* Provides state funding to assist Michigan's apple industry in investigating unfair dumping, particularly of Chinese frozen apple concentrate, which is eroding a valuable market for Michigan producers.

* Adds $303,100 for food safety inspection efforts, allowing consumer access to food safety information by automating inspection systems.

* Increases state funding for the Michigan Food Bank Council by 4 percent for processing donated food for distribution.

* Contains $7.9 million for local health department food safety activities, a 3% increase, aligning dollars and expertise to help improve inspection services and reinforce consistent food safety standards.

* Includes $11.5 million in restricted funds for horse racing regulation and equine industry events.

* Continues state support of fair premiums at county and state fair events.

The legislature added $1.5 million for an environmental technology research grant earmarked for the Michigan Biotechnology Institute (MBI). I anticipate that this will be the last year of this type of state support. In order to assist MBI in a gradual progression to self-sufficiency, the Department of Agriculture will consider dispersing Fiscal Year 2000 funds over a multi-year period. I also encourage MBI to maximize the receipt of federal revenue support and to compete for future funds through the Health and Aging Research and Development Fund included in the Fiscal Year 2000 Strategic Fund budget.

I commend the Legislature for its action in funding critical food safety and agricultural programs contained in Enrolled Senate Bill 357.
