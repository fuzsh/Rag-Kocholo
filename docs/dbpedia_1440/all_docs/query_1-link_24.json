Chemoprevention, as now used for breast cancer, for example, had not been implemented. Screening was employed for only one disease, cervical cancer, using the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. The first trial of mammographic screening for breast cancer, the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) study, had just been launched (Mukherjee 2010). Many of the most critical advances in mechanistic understanding that are relevant to prevention and treatment today had yet to arrive (Table 6.1) (DeVita and Rosenberg 2012).",

        "text": "Mechanisms of Cancer Induction by Tobacco Smoke\n\nClassic studies demonstrating the covalent binding of carcinogens, or their reactive electrophilic metabolites, to cellular macromolecules (including DNA) were published at about the same time as the 1964 Surgeon General's report on smoking and health (USDHEW 1964; Miller and Miller 1976). Building on these seminal observations, many researchers explored this mechanistic concept in detail and confirmed it for different classes of chemical carcinogens; that line of research continues even today (Searle 1984; Loebe and Harris 2008; Penning 2011). Tobacco smoke, with its multiple carcinogens, recapitulates the classic mechanisms established in these studies. The general concept of exposure to carcinogens, metabolism to reactive intermediates, and DNA damage leading to mutations in critical genes has been established as one major mechanism by which tobacco smoke causes cancer. This topic was discussed in some detail in Chapter 5 of the 2010 Surgeon General's report. A mechanistic framework encompassing these steps and related phenomena was presented in that report and in related publications, and it is reproduced here as (Hecht 1999, 2012a). This section will present a brief overview of the relevant steps in and a more detailed discussion of some recent findings pertinent to this overall mechanism.\n\nFigure 6.4\n\nPathway for causation of cancer by carcinogens in tobacco smoke. Source: Modified from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010.\n\nPeople begin to smoke cigarettes at a relatively young age, typically have difficulty stopping, and may continue to smoke for decades. Nicotine is addictive, but is not a direct chemical carcinogen (see Chapter 5, “Nicotine”) (Maier et al. 2011; Murphy et al. 2011). However, by creating and sustaining addiction, it leads to the prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke that increases cancer risk for smokers. When smokers inhale smoke, each cigarette puff delivers a mixture of carcinogens and toxicants. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, and at least 69 of these can cause cancer (USDHHS 2010). These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); tobacco-specific nitrosamines; aromatic amines; and volatile carcinogens such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and benzene (as well as various metals).\n\nMost constituents of cigarette smoke, including the carcinogens, are compounds foreign to the human body and, consequently, are acted upon by metabolizing enzymes designed to detoxify them. These enzymes, including cytochrome P-450, glutathione S-transferases, and UDP-glucuronosyl transferases and sulfotranferases, catalyze the conversion of these foreign compounds to more water-soluble products that can be easily excreted from the body. But during this process, certain reactive compounds may be formed as intermediates. Examples of these reactive intermediates include electrophilic carbocations or epoxides that can bind covalently to nucleophilic sites in DNA, including the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of DNA nucleobases. These binding products are known as DNA adducts and are critical in carcinogenesis if they are not fixed by DNA repair enzymes. Persons with rare syndromes in which DNA repair is deficient, such as Xeroderma pigmentosum, are highly prone to cancer development; people with this syndrome develop skin cancer because of the multiple types of DNA damage that result from exposure to sunlight (Weinberg 2007).\n\nThere is convincing evidence for the presence of DNA adducts in the lungs and other tissues of smokers in amounts generally higher than those found in nonsmokers. While many of these adducts remain unidentified, a number of studies have characterized specific carcinogen-DNA adducts in the tissues of smokers (Phillips and Venitt 2012).\n\nIf the DNA adducts produced by tobacco smoke carcinogens and their metabolites evade repair systems and remain, they can cause miscoding during DNA replication when bypass DNA polymerase enzymes direct the placement of an incorrect nucleobase opposite the adduct (USDHHS 2010). This can result in a permanent mutation in the DNA sequence. If this mutation occurs in an important section of a cellular oncogene such as KRAS, or in a tumor suppressor gene such as TP53, the result can be an alteration of the normal growth control mechanisms, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, further mutations, and cancer. Multiple studies, using state-of-the-art methods, have shown that thousands of mutations are present in the DNA of lung tumors from smokers, including in critical growth regulatory genes, most frequently KRAS and TP53. These genes are discussed in more detail below (Greenman et al. 2007; Ding et al. 2008a; Lee et al. 2010c; Pleasance et al. 2010).\n\nSome constituents of tobacco smoke or their metabolites may bind directly to cellular receptors, leading to activation of protein kinases, growth receptors, and other pathways, which can contribute to carcinogenesis (Chen et al. 2011b). Cigarette smoke contains substances that can induce inflammation resulting in enhanced pneumocyte proliferation, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and tumor promotion (Takahashi et al. 2010). Cigarette smoke also has cocarcinogens which, while not carcinogenic themselves, enhance the smoke's carcinogenic effects. Further, cigarette smoke induces oxidative damage and gene promoter methylation, processes that also likely contribute to cancer development.\n\nIn the last few years, there have been some developments that were not fully covered in the 2010 Surgeon General's report, but are pertinent to a fuller understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis by cigarette smoke. They are discussed briefly here.\n\nAddiction to nicotine results from its binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). An association between common variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 nAChRs subunit gene cluster on chromosome 15q25 and the risk of lung cancer was reported in three genome-wide association studies (Amos et al. 2008; Hung et al. 2008; Thorgeirsson et al. 2008). These genes are strongly associated with nicotine dependence (Saccone et al. 2007), and multiple studies have confirmed and amplified these observations (Saccone et al. 2009, 2010; Timofeeva et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011; Ware et al. 2011; Wassenaar et al. 2011). These results are likely due to changes in smoking behavior causing an increased uptake of nicotine as well as a greater presence of lung carcinogens, such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), in carriers of the gene variants described above (Le Marchand et al. 2008). The increased uptake of nicotine, which was confirmed by measurement of its metabolite cotinine in a similar study based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, is a surrogate for the uptake of carcinogens and toxicants in cigarette smoke (Timofeeva et al. 2011; Yuan et al. 2011a, 2012). Thus, carriers of the gene variants smoke their cigarettes more intensely and are exposed to higher levels of NNK and other carcinogens in smoke, thereby increasing their risk of lung cancer.\n\nModern DNA-sequencing methods allow scientists to carry out detailed investigations of mutations in human cancers. Because there are multiple carcinogens in cigarette smoke and multiple DNA adducts in the lungs of smokers, one would expect to find many mutations within critical genes in the lung tumors from smokers. Sequencing studies are consistent with this expectation. For example, when Greenman and colleagues (2007) investigated mutations in the coding exons of more than 500 protein kinase genes, they found that lung cancers were among those with the most somatic mutations (4.21 per megabase). The authors attributed this finding to recurrent exposure to exogenous mutagens (Greenman et al. 2007). Another investigation sequenced 188 primary lung adenocarcinomas; altogether, 247 megabases of tumor DNA sequence were analyzed and 1,013 nonsynonymous somatic mutations in 163 of the 188 tumors were identified, including 915 point mutations, 12 dinucleotide mutations, 29 insertions, and 57 deletions (Ding et al. 2008a). Twenty-six significantly mutated genes were identified, including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes commonly found to be mutated in lung cancer, such as TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, STK11, and others. Mutations were most common in TP53 and KRAS.\n\nMore recently, a report on complete exome and genome sequences of 183 lung adenocarcinomas revealed a mean exonic somatic mutation rate of 12.0 events per megabase (Imielinski et al. 2012). Analysis of nucleotide context-specific mutation signatures grouped the sample set into distinct clusters that correlated with smoking history and alterations of reported lung adenocarcinoma genes. Elsewhere, Pleasance and colleagues (2010) sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line; these investigators identified 22,190 somatic substitutions, including 134 in coding exons. They found that G→T transversions were the most common (34%), followed by G→A transitions (21%) and A→G transitions (19%). These results are similar to data that have been obtained by analysis of the TP53 gene, which is discussed later in this overview. Elsewhere, a case report focused on a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a 51-year-old patient who had smoked 25 cigarettes per day for 15 years prior to excision of the tumor, which yielded a poorly differentiated sample with 95% tumor content, most likely an adenocarcinoma (Lee et al. 2010c). In this patient, single nucleotide variants were common, mostly at G→C base pairs, frequently G→T transversions; these were statistically distinct from germline mutations. More than 50,000 single nucleotide variants were observed, approximately 17.7 mutations per megabase. At least eight genes in the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway were either mutated or amplified.\n\nIn another investigation, whole-exome sequencing and gene copy number analyses were used to study 32 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (Agrawal et al. 2011). Tumors from patients with a history of tobacco use had more mutations than did tumors from patients who did not use tobacco, and tumors that were negative for human papilloma virus (HPV) had more mutations than did HPV-positive tumors. Six of the genes that were mutated in multiple tumors were assessed in up to 88 additional head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In addition to previously described mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, and HRAS, new frequent mutations were found in FBXW7 and NOTCH1. In all, 11 of the 28 mutations (39%) identified in NOTCH1 were predicted to truncate the gene product, suggesting that NOTCH1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene rather than as an oncogene in this tumor type. Moreover, a similar study of 78 additional tumors reported that 30% of the cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (including NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating such dysregulation as a major driver of carcinogenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Stransky et al. 2011).\n\nThe results of these studies are consistent with those reported in the 2010 Surgeon General's report and with information found in the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database (Wellcome Trust anger Institute 2012), which stores and displays somatic mutations in genes associated with cancer, such as TP53 and KRAS. Collectively, the available results of late-generation sequencing studies, as well as the extensive databases on TP53 and KRAS mutations, are completely consistent with the induction of multiple mutations in critical growth control genes by metabolically activated carcinogens of cigarette smoke, although other processes downstream from exposure to carcinogens could also contribute.\n\nEpigenetic changes, defined as nonsequence DNA changes, are also an integral part of cancer progression. Gene promoter hypermethylation is an epigenetic change, involving extensive methylation at the 5-position of C in CpG islands within the promoter region, and, often, extending into exon 1 of regulatory genes (Jones and Baylin 2002). In lung cancer, more than 750 genes are inactivated by gene promoter hypermethylation, and new genes are still being identified through genomewide screening approaches (Selemat 2012). The end result of this process can be the loss of gene transcription and, therefore, the silencing of gene function. Comparison of DNA methylation profiles between lung adenocarcinomas of current and never smokers, using a genome-wide platform, showed only modest differences between the groups, and it identified only LGALS4 as significantly hypermethylated and downregulated in smokers (Selamat et al. 2012). Analysis of the DNA methylation data identified two tumor subgroups, one of which showed increased DNA methylation and was significantly associated with KRAS mutation and, to a lesser extent, with smoking. Promoter methylation of several genes, including P16, occurs early in tumor formation. One study of head and neck cancer found that P16 methylation was significantly and positively associated with pack-years1 of smoking and was an independent risk factor for overall survival, being significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with early resectable adenocarcinomas (Ai et al. 2003). In that study, P16 promoter hypermethylation also correlated significantly with a history of alcohol consumption or tobacco use in head and neck cancer. Other genes, such as BRMS1 and RASSF1A, may be more frequently methylated in various tumor types from smokers. In a study by Tessema and colleagues (2009), the frequency of methylation of TNFRSF10C, BHLHB5, and BOLL was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas from never smokers than in those from smokers. Methylation of genes, such as MGMT and AGT promoter hypermethylation, may increase G→A transition mutations at CpG sites within the TP53 gene in NSCLC.\n\nThese data in aggregate support the pathways illustrated in . The contribution of specific tobacco smoke carcinogens to lung cancer (and also to esophageal cancer) has been investigated in several nested case-control studies as well. In these studies, the carcinogens or their metabolites were quantified in stored urine samples that were collected from smokers years or decades before cancer developed. For example, using frozen urine samples collected during the 1980s from more than 18,000 smokers in Shanghai, China, scientists have found that specific metabolite levels were associated with an increased risk of lung or esophageal cancer, even after correction for the number of years of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day (Yuan et al. 2009, 2011a,b). Thus, significantly elevated risks for lung cancer were associated with increased levels of the NNK metabolites' total NNAL [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and its glucuronides] and the PAH metabolite phenanthrene tetraol. The strongest elevated risk was for esophageal cancer in individuals with the highest levels of the tobacco-specific carcinogen N′-nitrosonornicotine and its glucuronides in their urine. This carcinogen induces a high incidence of esophageal tumors in rats (Yuan et al. 2009, 2011a,b).\n\nSmokers experience proinflammatory changes in their lungs. Inflammation is intimately associated with activation of NF-κB and tumor promotion (Malkinson 2005; Smith et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2008), and many studies in laboratory animals demonstrate that anti-inflammatory agents can decrease tobacco carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis (Hecht et al. 2009). In addition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly emphysema, is an independent risk factor for lung cancer in smokers. This association further implicates a strong role for inflammation in lung cancer (Turner et al. 2007). In one study, the tumor-promoting activity of cigarette smoke was examined in mouse models of lung tumorigenesis (Takahashi et al. 2010); here, exposure to smoke after treatment of A/J mice with NNK increased the multiplicity of lung tumors. Similar results were obtained in KRASLA2 mice harboring a mutation in KRAS codon 12 identical to that caused by NNK. IκB kinase β (IKKβ) was required for NF-κB activation and played a critical role in tumor promotion in this system, most likely through the induction of inflammation and related phenomena (Takahashi et al. 2010). These studies amplify and extend earlier observations demonstrating the tumor-promoting activity of cigarette smoke.\n\nSummary\n\nUnderstanding of the mechanisms by which smoking causes cancer continues to advance. An overall framework for the causation of cancer by tobacco smoking was set out in the 2010 Surgeon General's report. The utility of that framework is supported by new experimental findings as well as by ongoing studies of smokers in the population.\n\nChanging Cigarettes and Risk for Lung Cancer Over Time\n\nCigarette smoking is the predominant cause of lung cancer in the United States, and lung cancer is the country's leading cause of cancer death (USDHHS 2004). Cigarette smoke, which contains multiple carcinogens (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; IARC 2004; USDHHS 2004; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009), is composed of gases and particles with a distribution of size that result in substantial deposition in the lung when the smoke is inhaled (Stratton et al. 2001; Gower and Hammond 2007). The composition of tobacco smoke varies with cigarette type (e.g., filtered or unfiltered) and across brands of the same type (IARC 2004; Burns et al. 2008; World Health Organization [WHO] 2008b). Over past decades, multiple substantive changes in the design and composition of cigarettes have altered the chemistry of tobacco smoke raising the question as to whether lung cancer risks have changed in response (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009). This section reviews evidence relevant to this question.\n\nThis section focuses on lung cancer because it is the cancer most related to cigarette smoking (USDHHS 2004). Substantial data are available, both over time and from many countries, on the occurrence of lung cancer, both generally and by histologic type. The topic of lung cancer in relation to smoking has been addressed in depth in several past reports of the Surgeon General. These reports have focused on levels of machine-measured tar and nicotine in relation to risk and have considered whether changes in design and characteristics that have lowered the tar yield of cigarettes have also reduced the risk of diseases caused by smoking (USDHHS 1981, 2004). The 2004 Surgeon General's report on the health consequences of smoking concluded that no substantive reduction in the risk of disease was associated with using cigarettes with low levels of tar, as measured by machine. This and earlier reports clearly document that machine-measured tar yields have little relationship to the doses actually received by smokers because of the phenomenon of compensation. This section focuses mainly on whether the changes in the design and composition of cigarettes over time that paralleled the reduction in tar yields (by machine measurement) may have altered—and possibly even increased—the risk of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking. The analysis is limited to cigarette design issues and does not consider other issues, such as changing nicotine yields and the marketing of various types of cigarettes. This section does not explore the implications of these changes for diseases other than lung cancer.\n\nChanges in Cigarettes Over the Past Several Decades\n\nSince the 1950s, cigarettes have undergone changes in their design and composition (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001). The most prominent changes have been the addition of filters and the use of ventilation holes in the filters to lower machine-measured tar and nicotine yields. shows the rapid rise in the use of filtered cigarettes that followed the heavy marketing of such cigarettes in the mid-1950s. The marketing effort promised a lower risk product to smokers who had become concerned about the disease risks of smoking (Brandt 2007). This shift to filters continued and today almost all manufactured cigarettes currently consumed in the United States are filtered (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001). shows the move to cigarettes with lower tar yields, beginning with a shift from brands with more than 20 milligrams (mg) of machine-measured tar to lower tar-yielding brands in the late 1960s and early 1970s (NCI 2001). By 1990, about two-thirds of cigarettes sold had either medium (11–15 mg), low (6–10 mg), or very low (1–5 mg) yields of tar. The principal mechanism underlying the lower yields of machine-measured tar was the increase in the number and the size of ventilation holes in the filter, thereby diluting the smoke entering the machine (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001). Although these changes reduced tar delivery as measured by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) protocol, which did not reflect how smokers actually smoke; they did not reduce the risks of disease and premature mortality in smokers (NCI 2001; USDHHS 2004).\n\nFigure 6.5\n\nMarket share and total annual cigarette sales of filtered and unfiltered cigarettes in the United States, 1925–1993.

Note: Tar levels for given years (more...)\n\nEpidemiologic evaluations of risk and assessments of smoke chemistry during the decades in which these substantial changes occurred tended to treat all cigarettes as if they were equivalent, both over time and across brands. The exception was that these evaluations did consider the machine-measured tar and nicotine yields and whether they were filtered. However, the design and composition of cigarettes changed substantially in other ways, even as they were continuously redesigned to deliver ever lower machine-measured yields of substances. Unfortunately, researchers in the past did not have access to information about the nature and extent of these and other changes in cigarettes because they were handled as trade secrets and, therefore, not disclosed by the industry.\n\nChanges in Design, Curing, and Composition\n\nAlthough smokers may perceive cigarettes as very simple devices: chopped-up tobacco rolled in paper, perhaps with a filter attached to the end, the reality, however, is that cigarettes are highly engineered products (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009; Proctor 2011). The design features of cigarettes can have significant effects on the composition of the tobacco smoke and perhaps its toxicity. Over time, changes to cigarettes have become progressively more extensive and more complex, further complicating the efforts of researchers to understand their health implications (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; WHO 2008b). Many factors can influence the chemistry of tobacco smoke: (1) the geographic location where the tobacco is grown (which can alter the heavy metal content of smoke, for example) (IARC 2004, 2007); (2) agricultural practices (which can influence levels of nitrates and pesticides, but also polonium and heavy metal content as well) (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009); (3) how the tobacco is cured and processed (which can influence tobacco-specific nitrosamine levels and other factors) (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001; Peele et al. 2001; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008); (4) the blend of tobacco used; (5) the use of reconstituted tobacco sheet and puffed tobacco (tobacco expanded through an industrial process) (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; IARC 2004, 2007; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009); (6) the engineering characteristics of the manufacturing process (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009); (7) the additives used in tobacco; and (8) the pattern of puffing the smoker uses to generate the smoke (which can alter the quantity of smoke generated and the relative composition of its constituents) (WHO 2007, 2008b; Burns et al. 2008).\n\nCigarettes in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are made primarily of flue-cured tobacco, but most brands sold in the United States use a blend of air-cured tobaccos (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; IARC 2004; WHO 2008b; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009). In addition, substantial amounts of reconstituted tobacco sheet and puffed tobacco are added to the blend. The soil in which the tobacco is grown, the agricultural practices used, and the methods of curing and processing the tobacco also differ across brands and have changed over time (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Peele et al. 2001; IARC 2004; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009). Flavoring agents; processing aids, such as humectants; chemicals intended to alter the pH of the smoke; and other agents are added to tobacco as part of the manufacturing process.\n\nApproaches used to alter the processes of generating smoke may involve the cut size of the reconstituted tobacco sheet, filter ventilation, the density of the tobacco in the rod, the composition and design of the filter material, the porosity of the cigarette paper, and other factors (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009). The pattern the smoker uses to puff the cigarette is superimposed on all of its intrinsic characteristics. This pattern varies among smokers and can change with different types of cigarettes smoked by the same smoker; it can also change systematically across smokers in response to certain design features, most notably filters and ventilation (NCI 2001; WHO 2008b). Rodgman and Perfetti (2009), O'Connor and colleagues (2008), and O'Connor and Hurley (2008) have reviewed the impact of many of these factors on the composition of tobacco smoke, but a detailed review of the extensive literature describing the effect of isolated changes on smoke composition is beyond the scope of this section.\n\nBeyond the data held by the manufacturers, the details on differences in the design and composition of cigarettes across U.S. brands are not available in a systematic form. Complete and representative information is also not available over time on the composition of smoke generated by individual brands or on the changes in manufacturing practices for different brands. Longitudinal data on brands marketed in the United States are limited to data—using FTC's protocol—on machine-measured yields of the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide produced. Without this information, the research and public health communities have been unable to fully assess the potential effects of changes in the design and composition of cigarettes on smokers' exposures over time to toxicants in cigarette smoke. Nevertheless, the limited data that exist allow for some assessment of likely changes in smoke toxicity following changes that have been made in cigarettes.\n\nDifferences Across Brands in Toxicant Yields\n\nOf the 7,000 or more constituents in tobacco and tobacco smoke, 69 have been identified as carcinogens (USDHHS 2010). The complexity and expense of measuring multiple constituents for all the different brands under multiple sets of machine parameters have led tobacco industry scientists to suggest that constituent yields can be benchmarked and reliably predicted from machine-measured tar yields (Counts et al. 2004, 2005, 2006; Morton and Laffoon 2008). This concept is based on the assumed relationship between the total mass of smoke and its nicotine content, as measured by a smoking machine. However, the mass of smoke generated by a smoking machine using any fixed protocol bears little relationship to the amount of smoke inhaled by a smoker or to the differences between brands in smoke exposure (Jarvis et al. 2001; NCI 2001). A more appropriate method for examining the variation in constituent yields across brands is to examine these yields after they have been normalized per mg of tar or per mg of nicotine to characterize the variation that might be experienced for a given level of nicotine intake.\n\nNicotine is the principal addictive constituent sought by the smoker and the ratio of tar to nicotine is relatively constant across brands. When the Massachusetts Benchmark Study data on yields for a 1999 sample of U.S. brands of cigarettes are normalized per mg of tar or per mg of nicotine, the ability of tar yields to predict the variation in yields of other constituents is poor (Harris 2001, 2004). In fact, the normalized yields of several constituents are higher for cigarettes with low machine-measured tar yields than for those whose machine-measured tar yields are high (Harris 2004).\n\npresents the variability in the yields of a variety of constituents across brands, normalized per mg of tar or per mg of nicotine, from the Massachusetts Benchmark Study sample of U.S. cigarettes in 1999. In this table, the coefficient of variation across brands (which represents the standard deviation of the measurements across brands normalized to the mean value of that constituent for all brands) is divided by the mean standard deviation of replicate measurements for that constituent. This formulation expresses the variation of constituents across brands in relation to the precision with which the constituent can be measured. demonstrates that for many of the toxicants measured, the variation in constituents across brands, normalized per mg of tar or per mg of nicotine, is many times higher than can be explained by the variability of the measurement. Clearly, at least in terms of constituent yields from machine-generated cigarette smoke, smoke from all cigarettes is not uniform in composition. This variability is likely not limited to 1999, when the cigarettes were sampled, or to have remained constant over time. Furthermore, normalized constituent yields in Canadian and Australian cigarette brands and a sample of international blended cigarette brands manufactured by Philip Morris International have demonstrated similar variability (WHO 2008b). In addition, when biomarkers of exposure to specific toxicants are assessed, the data show considerable variability in their levels among smokers, particularly in heavy smokers (Joseph et al. 2005); this finding is consistent with variation in exposure due to differences in smoke composition across brands and to inherent variability among smokers.\n\nTable 6.2\n\nRatio of brand coefficient of variation to replicate measurement coefficient of nicotine and tar variation per milligram (mg), per Massachusetts Machine Smoking Protocol, in rank order.\n\nChanges in Tobacco-Specific Nitrosamine and Benzo[a]pyrene Levels Over Time\n\nBecause only limited longitudinal data are available for toxicant yields, changes in these yields over time are difficult to characterize accurately for all brands. However, for one major U.S. brand, some data are available for two of the major toxicants: benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and the tobacco-specific nitrosamines (N′-nitrosonornicotine [NNN] and NNK).\n\nB[a]P, one of the earliest identified carcinogens in cigarette smoke, is a typical carcinogenic PAH and is often used as a surrogate index for the PAHs as a group. Efforts to reduce the levels of this carcinogen in smoke have included increasing the proportion of tobacco in the cigarette rod that is made up of reconstituted sheet, changing the tobacco blend, increasing the porosity of the paper, and using other techniques (O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; WHO 2008b; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009). Data are not available for all U.S. brands over time, but Hoffmann and Hoffmann (1997) published data for a prominent cigarette brand, measured repeatedly from 1959–1995, that showed a modest decline in B[a]P levels in smoke over that period.\n\nIn contrast to the decline in levels of B[a] P, levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, specifically NNK, increased dramatically in the previously referenced brand from 1978–1995 (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). This increase was due in part to the increased nitrate levels in the tobacco used in cigarettes even before the curing (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Ding et al. 2008b; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009) and to changes in curing practices that have increased the presence of oxides of nitrogen and nitrate ion and the latter's reaction products during curing, with the resultant formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines from the nicotine in the leaf (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001; Peele et al. 2001; IARC 2004; Ding et al. 2008b; O'Connor et al. 2008; O'Connor and Hurley 2008).\n\nDifferences in Toxicant Yields Across Countries\n\nRelatively more evidence is available for differences in toxicant yields from comparisons of international brands of cigarettes. Of particular note, the use of burley tobacco in U.S.-style blended cigarettes contributes substantially to the differences in tobacco-specific nitrosamines between U.S.-style cigarettes and those of Canada and Australia (Burns et al. 2008; Ding et al. 2008b; WHO 2008b), where most brands contain mainly unblended, flue-cured tobacco. Datasets are available for some smoke constituents that have been measured for major brands in the Canadian and Australian markets (WHO 2008b) and for a selection of international brands of blended cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris (Counts et al. 2004, 2005).\n\nSeveral other differences between Canadian and Australian brands were found, although cigarettes in both countries are made with unblended, flue-cured tobacco. Differences in the levels of cadmium and lead between the brands are notable. presents the mean yields of some toxic constituents for the major Canadian and Australian brands sampled in late 2000 to early 2001. The yields are normalized per mg of nicotine and expressed as a ratio to the mean yields for an international sample of brands manufactured by Philip Morris. The data for the Canadian brands are presented for all brands and for brands other than those with high NNN levels (U.S.-style and Gauloise cigarettes). The expected differences between flue-cured and blended cigarettes are evident (Ding et al. 2008b); the flue-cured cigarettes from Australia and Canada have much lower levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (notably NNN and NNK) and substantially higher levels of B[a]P. Australian and Canadian brands, however, differ markedly from blended cigarettes in a number of other toxicants, with lower levels of oxides of nitrogen; 1-ami-nonapthalene; 1,3-butadiene; and isoprene. Canadian, but not Australian, cigarettes have higher levels of catechol, phenol, and cresols. These differences may reflect the use of tobacco grown for use in cigarettes in different regions of Canada and Australia.\n\nFigure 6.7\n\nRatio of the means of constituents in cigarette brands from Canada and Australia to the mean for an international sample of U.S.-style blended cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris and sampled from late 2000 to early 2001. Source: Counts et al. 2005; (more...)\n\nshows the differences in NNN and NNK between Australian brands and a blended version of the Marlboro brand designed for the Australian market (Burns et al. 2008; WHO 2008b). The levels of NNN and NNK in the blended-tobacco cigarette from Marlboro are much higher than those for even the highest level brand reported to the Australian regulatory authorities.\n\nFigure 6.8\n\nMean and range of N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) yields per milligram [mg] of nicotine for brands reported to the Australian government, contrasted with the levels of NNN and NNK reported for (more...)\n\nThese differences in tobacco-specific nitrosamine levels in smoke translate to different exposures among smokers. Mouth-level exposures to NNN and NNK and urinary measures of NNAL—a metabolite of NNK—are higher among smokers in the United States than in smokers in Australia and Canada (Ashley et al. 2010), demonstrating that the observed differences in the composition of smoke result in substantive differences in exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines.\n\nLow-Tar Cigarettes Do Not Reduce Risk of Lung Cancer\n\nEarly efforts to alter the risks of cigarettes focused on reducing the yields of tar and nicotine as measured by machine-smoking methods. As a result, machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine declined by more than 60% from the 1960s to 1990 (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; NCI 2001). Much of that reduction was accomplished initially by adding filters and later by ventilating the filter to dilute the smoke coming through it, thus lowering the machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine so the newer products could be marketed as being less risky to health (NCI 2001). But to compensate for the reduced yields, smokers changed the way they smoked these cigarettes, resulting in no meaningful reduction in either the total dose of smoke received or in the risks of diseases caused by smoking (NCI 2001; USDHHS 2004). Changes in patterns included increasing the volume and velocity of puffs, increasing the duration of puffing, and shortening the intervals between puffs (NCI 2001). However, the protocol for smoking by machines was not changed.\n\nOverall Death Rates for Lung Cancer Indicate Increased Risk of Smoking in Recent Decades\n\nIn the United States, the prevalence of smoking among males has declined since at least the 1950s, but age-adjusted death rates for lung cancer among men did not begin to decline until approximately 1990 (Wingo et al. 1999). Among women, the comparable death rates peaked around 2003 and significantly declined (Jemal et al. 2013), likely due to considerable success in reducing the prevalence of smoking among women. The long delay between decreases in the prevalence of smoking and changes in death rates for lung cancer raises the question as to whether there might have been an increasing risk of lung cancer over time from smoking cigarettes that could have contributed to this delay.\n\nEpidemiologic studies are a key source of evidence for assessing whether the risk of lung cancer associated with smoking has changed over time. Particularly informative is the comparison by Thun and Heath (1997) of two prospective cohort studies of the risk of smoking conducted by the ACS. Each study, conducted more than 20 years apart, followed more than 1 million men and women. The Cancer Prevention Study I (CPS-I) began in 1959, and the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) began in 1982. The more than two decades between the studies saw substantial changes in the design and composition of cigarettes and in the brands of cigarettes that Americans smoked. The decline in machine-measured yields of toxicants in cigarettes between these two studies led to an expectation that the risk of lung cancer death for smokers would likely be lower in the CPS-II. The authors compared death rates from lung cancer in the first 6 years of follow-up for each study among the subsamples of never and current smokers at enrollment. The risks were found to be higher in CPS-II (Thun and Heath 1997). presents the results from these analyses for men and women current smokers and never smokers based on 786,387 CPS-I and 711,363 CPS-II participants. The risk for never smokers (as measured by the death rate from lung cancer) went essentially unchanged during the interval between the two studies, but the risk for smokers increased dramatically, with a proportionately greater increase among women smokers. The increase in risk of death from lung cancer remained after controlling for measured differences in duration and intensity (number of cigarettes smoked per day) between the smokers in the two studies.\n\nFigure 6.9\n\nDeath rates from all lung cancers, by smoking status, Cancer Prevention Study I (CPS-I) and Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), 1959–1965 and 1982–1988.

During the second 20 years of follow-up, the risk of death from lung cancer was greater than during the first 20 years (Doll et al. 1994); this increase over time was limited to smokers and former smokers. Among never smokers, rates of lung cancer mortality were relatively constant across calendar years (Thun et al. 2006, 2008), suggesting that the changes observed in the relative risk (RR) of smoking were unlikely to have resulted from changes in population demographics or in other risk factors for lung cancer in the general population.\n\nModels of risk based on smoking patterns have been applied to data on smoking prevalence for birth cohorts (i.e., sets of individuals born during specified calendar years and for whom rates can be examined as the cohorts advance in age and calendar year) to estimate the expected occurrence of death from lung cancer in the absence of any change in the risk imposed by smoking. Using birth-cohort-specific data on smoking developed by Harris (1983) and a multistage carcinogenesis model similar to that developed by Whittemore (1988), Swartz (1992) predicted overall age-adjusted trends in lung cancer mortality for White men from 1970–1985. The author estimated that a 12% decline in rates should have occurred during this interval, based on the assumption of a constant effect over time. However, this estimated decline contrasted sharply with the observed 26% increase in lung cancer death rates during the interval (Swartz 1992). To predict death rates for lung cancer over time by birth cohort, Tolley and colleagues (1991) used an updated set of birth-cohort-specific estimates for smoking prevalence and a risk model developed by Peto (1986) that was based on data from the British Doctors' Study (Doll et al. 1994). These authors estimated that overall lung cancer mortality should have started to decline in the early 1980s for White men and in the mid-1990s for White women. Instead, observed lung cancer mortality continued to rise throughout the 1980s, peaking in the early 1990s for White men (Wingo et al. 1999) and 2003 for women generally (Jemal et al. 2013). A similar approach, using risk models developed from the CPS-I data and birth-cohort-specific data on smoking prevalence from the National Health Interview Survey, demonstrated a systematic trend of increasing underestimation of observed death rates for lung cancer across all birth cohorts with advancing calendar years (NCI 2001).\n\nEstimates of smoking behaviors for birth cohorts that incorporate changes in the number of cigarettes smoked per day were developed for NCI's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) (Anderson et al. 2012). These estimates are more detailed than previous data on smoking behaviors for birth cohorts and include estimates of the intensity and duration of smoking for 5-year birth cohorts from 1900–1984. For each calendar year, these estimates provide rates of smoking initiation; prevalence of current and former smoking; and distributions of the duration of smoking, the duration of abstinence, and the number of cigarettes smoked per day for current and former smokers. These estimates for smoking behavior were combined with risk models for current, former, and never smokers derived from 12-year follow-up data from the CPS-I (Knoke et al. 2004, 2008) to estimate birth-cohort-specific lung cancer death rates from 1960–2000 (Burns et al. 2011b). The resulting estimates were compared with observed U.S. national lung cancer death rates for the same birth cohorts. The comparison showed a progressively increasing underestimation of U.S. national lung cancer death rates across all birth cohorts as calendar years advanced from the 1960s to 2000 (Burns et al. 2011b). This underestimation was eliminated when a term that increased the risk of smoking, based on the estimated duration of smoking after 1972, was added to the risk model. These analyses suggest that estimates of smoking-related lung cancer deaths that are based on observations in the 1960s underestimate the current risks of smoking, implying that the risk of death from lung cancer associated with smoking may have increased over the past several decades—that is, during the same decades in which changes in the design of cigarettes were made.\n\nConsidering the increase in risk of death from lung cancer seen from CPS-I to CPS-II, Thun and Heath (1997) recognized the possibility that the risk of death from lung cancer observed in CPS-I might underestimate the contributions of (a) amount smoked and (b) duration of smoking due to overreporting in the CPS-I data of the duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked early in life. Among White men, the transition from other forms of tobacco use (e.g., cigars and pipes) to cigarettes began largely after 1914, because cigarette smoking was uncommon before that year (Burns et al. 1997). Because lung cancer is a disease of older ages, much of the lung cancer mortality experience in CPS-I occurred among men who were well past their adolescence by 1914, and yet many of them reported initiating smoking at early ages. Some participants in CPS-I may have reported initiating cigarette smoking at the time at which they first used tobacco of any type, or they may have otherwise overestimated their duration of cigarette smoking, leading to a longer reported duration of cigarette smoking than actually occurred. The resulting misclassification, with a bias toward reporting a longer duration of smoking, could lead to a reduced magnitude of the estimated effect of duration of smoking on risk of lung cancer death in risk models based on CPS I data. Because a much larger fraction of those who developed lung cancer in CPS-II took up smoking after 1914, the effect of overreporting the duration of smoking would be lower in CPS-II, the magnitude of the estimated duration effect would increase, and the risk of smoking would appear to have increased between the two studies, with adjustment for differences in reported duration of smoking.\n\nThe study used the CISNET smoking rates and risk models based on CPS-I (Burns et al. 2011b) and attempted to minimize the contribution of overreporting of smoking duration and early smoking by eliminating birth cohorts born before 1915—the period during which overreporting was most likely. In addition, the potential for underestimation of the increase in duration over time to produce the observed progressive underestimation of the U.S. birth-cohort-specific death rates for lung cancer with advancing calendar time was examined by iteratively increasing the duration term and examining the fit of the resulting estimates to the observed U.S. death rates. Although increasing the duration term increased the estimated rates as anticipated, the pattern of a progressive change in risk remained even as calendar years advanced, with an overestimated actual risk giving way to an underestimated risk as calendar years advanced. Thus, an increasing effect of duration on risk of death from lung cancer did not explain the progressive underestimation of mortality from lung cancer, whereas a term increasing the risk of cigarette smoking over time did.\n\nOverreporting in CPS-I also may have resulted in an overestimation of the number of cigarettes smoked early in life, but the contribution of cigarettes smoked per day to risk of lung cancer is much smaller than the contribution of duration (Flanders et al. 2003; Knoke et al. 2004), and the exponent for the cigarettes-per-day term in the CPS-I risk equations is close to one (Knoke et al. 2004, 2008). As a result, any underestimation of lifetime number of cigarettes smoked per day due to overreporting of smoking early in life is expected to be modest and could be approximated by a constant that would be incorporated in the risk equations when they are adjusted for the healthy population selection bias (Pinsky et al. 2007) required for such estimates (Tolley et al. 1991; Burns et al. 2011b).\n\nTo further assess changes in the risk of lung cancer from smoking over time, Thun and colleagues (2013) extended their analyses by comparing the lung cancer risk associated with smoking observed in five contemporary cohorts (2000–2010) with risks observed in CPS-I (1959–1965) and CPS-II (1982–1988). For never smokers, rates of death from lung cancer remained constant across time among men and increased only slightly among women. Among females 55 years of age and older at baseline, the RR for lung cancer comparing current smokers to never smokers progressively increased from 2.73 in CPS-I to 12.65 in CPS-II to 25.66 for the 2000–2010 cohorts. Corresponding RRs for current male smokers were 12.22, 23.81, and 24.97, respectively. Compared with their counterparts in CPS-I and CPS-II, both men and women in the contemporary cohorts were at greater risk for lung cancer despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day. Duration of smoking increased substantially across the study time periods for women. In comparison, duration of smoking changed only modestly for men across the studies and actually declined slightly between CPS-II and the 2000–2010 cohorts.\n\nThun and colleagues (2013) also stratified their analyses by smoking intensity (i.e., number of cigarettes smoked per day) and duration of smoking for all three study periods. Within each stratum of smoking intensity and duration of smoking, the RR estimates increased over time for women. For men, RR estimates increased over time within each stratum of smoking intensity, but a consistent pattern was not evident for each stratum of smoking duration. The authors concluded that the risk of lung cancer from smoking has continued to increase among women but among men has plateaued at the very high levels observed in the 1980s.\n\nTrends in most other tobacco-related cancers have not been examined in detail, although Baris and colleagues (2009) reported an increase in the incidence of bladder cancer over the past several decades.\n\nChanges Over Time in the Types of Lung Cancer Associated With Smoking\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the lung has been increasing in the United States since the 1970s (Travis et al. 1996; Wingo et al. 1999), as manifested in rising incidence rates and an increasing proportion of all lung cancers that are adenocarcinomas (Wingo et al. 1999; Devesa et al. 2005). Theoretically, this increase could be due to changes over time in the classification of tumors, but an analysis by Charloux and colleagues (1997) found the increase to be real and not a consequence of changing diagnostic practices.\n\nNotably, the increase in adenocarcinoma of the lung has been accompanied by an increase in the estimated RR for this type of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking. Early in the investigation of the lung cancer epidemic, the most common histologic type of lung cancer in men was squamous cell carcinoma, and the RR of squamous cell carcinoma associated with smoking was substantially higher than that for adenocarcinoma (Wu-Williams and Samet 1994; USDHHS 2004). Kreyberg (1962) even debated whether adenocarcinoma was associated with cigarette smoking, because of the low RR and because adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer among women who have never smoked. As the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma increased over time, the RRs of this type of lung cancer associated with smoking also increased (USDHHS 2001), suggesting that a new, or at least a substantially enhanced, risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the lung occurred in smokers. In a comparison of data from CPS-I and CPS-II, Thun and colleagues (1997) found that the RR for adenocarcinoma increased in smokers from 4.6 for men and 1.5 for women (per data from CPS-I, conducted 1959–1965) to 19.0 for men and 8.1 for women (per data from CPS-II, conducted 1982–1988), but that the age-adjusted death rates for adenocarcinoma of the lung among never smokers were essentially unchanged over the period. Furthermore, risk for lung cancer of all tissue types among never smokers remained constant over the same interval (Thun et al. 2006, 2008).\n\nTrends across calendar years in age-standardized incidence rates of lung cancer have also varied by tumor type. presents trends in age-standardized incidence rates in the United States from 1973–2010 for lung cancer by gender and histologic type using data from NCI's SEER Program. Among men, the decline in the incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma started well ahead of the decline for incidence rates for adenocarcinoma; similar trends are seen for women. Rates of squamous cell and small cell carcinoma have been declining in men since the early- to mid-1980s, but rates of adenocarcinoma did not peak until the 1990s (Travis et al. 1996; Wingo et al. 1999; Devesa et al. 2005). Age-standardized rates in women reflect their later uptake of smoking, resulting in a later year of peak smoking-induced rates of lung cancer, and the patterns are more difficult to interpret. However, rates of squamous cell carcinoma leveled off among women around 1990, but their rates of adenocarcinoma continued to increase through the 1990s (Wingo et al. 1999; Devesa et al. 2005). The recent trends in rates for the NSCLCs have been affected by trends in diagnostic practice, reflecting treatment approaches that are targeted by histologic type. There has been a trend to avoid nonspecific classification and to designate lung cancers as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Langer et al. 2010; Travis et al. 2011; Conde et al. 2013).\n\nFigure 6.10\n\nStandardized incidence of lung cancer, by gender and histology (age adjusted to 2000 U.S. population), 1973–2010.

Note: Other non-small-cell-lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (more...)\n\nInterpreting age-standardized rates of lung cancer is difficult because of variations in the prevalence of smoking, in the distribution of duration of smoking, and in the distribution of the duration of abstinence in the U.S. population over the past several decades. For that reason, rates of lung cancer by histologic type have also been examined by birth cohorts. This approach examines outcomes as the population born during the selected calendar years initiates and quits smoking over time (and ages, as well). These two smoking behaviors have been found to differ substantially across sequential birth cohorts for the U.S. population (Burns et al. 1997, 2011b).\n\nZheng and colleagues (1994) found that birth-cohort-specific rates of lung cancer by histologic type across calendar years in the Connecticut Tumor Registry data demonstrated a clear birth-cohort pattern for increased rates of adenocarcinoma; that is, there were identifiable differences in rates by cohort. These changes paralleled gender and generational changes in smoking rather than advances in diagnostic procedures (Thun et al. 1997a). In this Connecticut study, the birth-cohort trends for squamous cell carcinoma were consistent with changes in smoking prevalence by birth cohort over time, but rates of adenocarcinoma by birth cohort progressively increased for both men and women in a manner that was not consistent with changes in smoking prevalence by birth cohort (Zheng et al. 1994). This increase was consistent with an increase over time in the risk of adenocarcinoma associated with smoking due to changes in the design of cigarettes, including the introduction of filters and low-tar cigarettes (Zheng et al. 1994; Thun et al. 1997a).\n\nand present incidence rates for lung cancer by histologic type based on 5-year birth cohort data from the SEER Program. Although the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma is somewhat higher for women across all birth cohorts, a trend is found in which adenocarcinoma represents an increasing proportion of lung cancer when sequential cohorts are examined for both men and women. Data in and are combined in to present mean values for the proportions of all lung cancers with a designated histologic type that were adenocarcinoma for those cohorts with data available. The mean values demonstrate a substantial increase in the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma when moving from the earliest to the more recent cohorts. An important caveat in interpreting these means is that the age range for each cohort is different, as it must be, with the earliest cohorts having only the older age ranges and the more recent cohorts only the younger age ranges.\n\nFigure 6.11\n\nIncidence of lung cancer among U.S. men from various birth cohorts, by histologic type (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small and large cell carcinoma) and year of diagnosis, 1975–2000.

Source: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, public use data.\n\nData from the SEER Program do not contain information about smoking status at the individual level, but the birth-cohort rates for the different histologic types presented in the figures result from a steadily progressing mixture of current, former, and never-smoking behaviors that are specific for each cohort as it moves forward in time. Therefore, differences in the proportion of lung cancers due to a specific histologic type are not due to differences by histology in overall smoking behaviors, given that these behaviors are the same for all of the histologic types in any given calendar year. Differences by histologic type within a cohort can reflect differences in the relationship of age to histologic type, differences in the rate of decline in risk after smoking cessation for the different histologies, or variation in the exposures over time in the agents causing the different types of lung cancer.\n\nEffects due to aging, such as those that might be manifested if the durations of smoking required to produce squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are different, would likely reveal themselves in a similar fashion across all cohorts as those cohorts reach the appropriate ages, but and do not indicate a consistent pattern with age.\n\nThe time course of reduction in excess risk of lung cancer after cessation of smoking likely differs for the different histologic types. For example, some data suggest that excess risks for squamous cell and small cell lung cancers may decline more rapidly after cessation than do excess risks for adenocarcinoma (Kenfield et al. 2008). As calendar years have advanced, the U.S. population in the age groups at substantial risk for lung cancer (i.e., those over 50 years of age) is composed of an increasing fraction of former smokers, and those former smokers have had longer durations of abstinence. The potential effect of a slower decline in risk for adenocarcinoma raises the possibility that the decline in squamous cell carcinoma and the increase in adenocarcinoma over time may be a result of a relatively more rapid decline in risk for squamous cell carcinoma, leaving an increasing fraction of lung cancer as adenocarcinoma. However, if the increasing proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma was in fact due to this effect (of a less rapid decline in the excess risk for adenocarcinoma following cessation), then the greatest shift would be in the earliest birth cohorts, among whom the effects of differences in risk with abstinence would be most evident. and show the opposite pattern—the greatest increase in the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma occurs in the more recent birth cohorts who are younger in age and have less cumulative abstinence.\n\nThe birth-cohort pattern observed in and suggests that changes in the design and composition of cigarettes may be a factor that is driving the increase in rates of adenocarcinoma (Charloux et al. 1997; Thun et al. 1997a; NCI 2001). Risk of lung cancer reflects cumulative exposure to cigarette smoke, and if a change in the design or composition of cigarettes increases the risk of lung cancer from smoking, then the onset of increasing risk begins at the time when the change is made. Each succeeding cohort would have a larger fraction of its cumulative smoking exposure from the new cigarettes, as existing brands are refashioned and smokers switch to brands with greater risk characteristics. This increased risk becomes stronger in successive birth cohorts, particularly if use of the newer, more hazardous product is more common among younger than older smokers. Among older individuals from the earlier birth cohorts, rates of lung cancer will continue to be dominated by the substantial contribution of their past smoking, and an increase in risk resulting from a more recently changed cigarette product will make a relatively modest proportional contribution to the pre-existing and already substantial risk for these cohorts. As more recent birth cohorts are examined, the onset of increasing risk due to a change in product design will begin at an earlier age because members of the cohort will begin smoking the newer products at a younger age. The increment in risk with the use of the newer products reflects a larger proportion of the total risk for the cohort, simply because the duration of smoking preceding the shift to a more dangerous type of cigarette is shorter and thus the risk for that earlier period as a fraction of total risk is smaller. Such an effect could explain the progressive increase in the proportion of lung cancers that are adenocarcinomas across sequential cohorts, as shown in .\n\nDifferences in the prevalence of current and former smoking and differences in the distribution of the duration of smoking and the duration of abstinence from smoking vary markedly across birth cohorts and contribute to differences in risks of lung cancer. To account for these differences in the examination of rising rates of adenocarcinoma, birth-cohort-specific smoking behaviors have been used to model changes in the rates of lung cancer of different histologic types (Burns et al. 2011a), as was done for overall lung cancer mortality and incidence rates. Risk models derived from CPS-I were applied to the smoking behaviors of birth cohorts. These behaviors include rates of smoking initiation, prevalence of current and former smoking, and distributions of the duration of smoking, duration of abstinence, and number of cigarettes smoked per day for current and former smokers (Burns et al. 2011a). The resulting rates were adjusted for a healthy population selection bias and differences between rates of incidence and mortality and then were scaled, based on the fraction of lung cancers of the appropriate histologic type in the SEER Program data for the first years available (1973–1975).\n\nThe predicted rates for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma by 5-year birth cohort were compared with the rates observed in data from the SEER Program for the same cohorts during the calendar years 1973–2000. For squamous cell carcinoma, the predicted rates closely matched the rates from the SEER Program, suggesting that much of the variability in the incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma over the past several decades can be explained by changes in the rates of smoking prevalence and cessation. In contrast, the predicted rates for adenocarcinoma did not match data in the SEER Program, and the differences between predicted rates and those of the SEER Program varied systematically by birth cohort. When a term increasing the risk for adenocarcinoma with duration of smoking after 1950 was added to the risk model for current and former smokers (to simulate an increasing risk over time associated with a change in the design of cigarettes), the predicted rates matched the rates from the SEER Program. Thus, these analyses suggest that increasing risk of lung cancer over time may be associated with changes in the design or composition of cigarettes. The analyses also raise the possibility that the increase in overall lung cancer mortality from smoking may reflect an increase in the risk of developing adenocarcinoma from smoking, with little change in the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSome researchers have suggested alternative explanations for the increase in lung adenocarcinoma. Based on birth-cohort analyses of data from the SEER Program and differences in the temporal trends in the incidence of squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma of the lung, Chen and colleagues (2007b,c, 2009) suggested an effect of air pollution, and specifically nitrogen oxides, as the cause for the trends in adenocarcinoma. However, because among never smokers both lung cancer mortality and the incidence of adenocarcinoma do not seem to have changed over time and because the risk of adenocarcinoma among smokers has increased, changes in cigarette smoking are a more likely cause of the temporal trends than air pollution.\n\nChanges in the demographics of smokers are another potential explanation. Over time, the poorer and less-educated segments of the population have become a progressively greater fraction of U.S. smokers (see Chapter 13, “Patterns of Tobacco Use Among U.S. Youth, Young Adults, and Adults”). Within birth cohorts, an increasing proportion of smokers come from population groups characterized by less education and lower income and cessation rates are lower in these groups as well, compared with those having more education and higher incomes. Occupational and environmental exposures associated with increased lung cancer risk are also more common among those with less education and lower income. As a result, the effects of this demographic shift should be relatively uniform across cohorts, unlike the pattern observed in the figures. In addition, a demographic shift of this type in the characteristics of smokers would not affect rates of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma or would not affect rates of adenocarcinoma or influence rates of squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nIn summary, adenocarcinoma has been increasing in the United States as a fraction of all lung cancers, becoming the most common histologic type of lung cancer. Despite decreases in smoking prevalence and concomitant decreases in squamous cell carcinoma, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma among smokers has increased since the 1960s. Changes in the design and/or composition of cigarettes during the 1960s have increased the levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines and other carcinogens in cigarette smoke. Evidence from birth-cohort models and epidemiologic studies are sufficient to conclude that the increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma among smokers is due to changes in the design and/or composition of cigarettes which increased the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke.\n\nEvidence for a Rising Risk of Adenocarcinoma of the Lung in the United States\n\nDifferences Across Time in Rates of Adenocarcinoma Within the United States and Across Countries\n\nIn a population, the principal determinants of risk for lung cancer are the prevalence of current smoking and the distribution of the duration of smoking among current and former smokers. As described previously, assessing the impact of differences in population-based smoking behaviors on rates of lung cancer is a complex undertaking. Even so, some understanding can be gained by comparing rates of lung cancer in countries where smokers have similar behaviors but smoke different types of cigarettes.\n\nIncidence rates of adenocarcinoma of the lung and the proportions of adenocarcinoma in relation to all lung cancers increased in most countries through 1995–1997 (Devesa et al. 2005). These trends were particularly evident among women and reflected the higher risk of lung cancer accompanying their increasing smoking prevalence and a rising proportion of lung cancer that was adenocarcinoma (Devesa et al. 2005). When examined at the national level, however, the rates of increase of adenocarcinoma and the patterns of the shift to adenocarcinoma as the most common form of lung cancer varied among countries (Devesa et al. 2005). In many countries—such as European countries (Devesa et al. 2005), including Italy (Russo et al. 1997); Japan (Yoshimi et al. 2003); and Hong Kong (Tse et al. 2009)—the patterns among men have roughly mimicked those of U.S. men, with falling rates of squamous cell carcinoma and initially rising but then falling rates of adenocarcinoma. Among women, interpretations of changes in rates of cancer by histologic type need to consider the rising rates of smoking prevalence for women. Regardless, rates of adenocarcinoma rose faster than rates of squamous cell carcinoma in most countries for which data were available (Devesa et al. 2005).\n\nAs described previously, flue-cured cigarettes of the type preferred in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have substantially lower levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines than do U.S.-style blended cigarettes and have higher levels of B[a]P (WHO 2008b). Tobacco-specific nitrosamines, specifically NNN and NNK, are organ-specific carcinogens for adenocarcinoma of the lung in animal models (IARC 2007; USDHHS 2010); NNK selectively induces adenocarcinoma of the lung in rats, mice, and hamsters. The level of NNAL, a metabolite of NNK, in the urine of smokers has been shown to be an independent predictor of risk for lung cancer even when the analysis controls for intensity (by cotinine concentration) and duration of smoking (Church et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2009).\n\nIn terms of PAHs, one prospective cohort study found that a biomarker (phenanthrene tetraol) for PAH exposure was not an independent predictor of risk for lung cancer (Church et al. 2009). When the risk for lung cancer was examined by histologic type in this study, however, a significant association was found between NNAL in the urine and adenocarcinoma of the lung. The relationship between NNAL and risk for lung cancer was not significant for all other types of lung cancer combined, and the odds ratios for adenocarcinoma and other lung cancers did not differ significantly from each other (Church et al. 2009).\n\nMouth-level exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines in smoke has been examined among smokers in countries with high use of blended cigarettes (United States) and flue-cured unblended cigarettes (Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom) (Ashley et al. 2010). Levels of NNK exposure among Australian and Canadian smokers were approximately one-third that of U.S. smokers, and levels of NNN exposure were 85–90% lower than the U.S. experience. Among smokers in the United Kingdom, levels of NNK exposure were 20% lower than those of smokers in the United States, and levels of NNN were approximately 50% lower (Ashley et al. 2010).\n\nIn England and Scotland, flue-cured cigarettes remain popular, but measures of the level of exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines fall between those observed in smokers in the United States and in smokers in other countries where unblended cigarettes are common (Canada and Australia) (Ashley et al. 2010). In England (Bennett et al. 2008) and Scotland (Harkness et al. 2002), incidence rates of adenocarcinoma of the lung for men have increased only slightly, and squamous cell carcinoma remains the predominant lung cancer. Rates of squamous cell carcinoma among men in those countries are declining consistently as smoking prevalence drops.\n\nIn Canada, the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma among men in 1995–1997 remained lower than that of squamous cell carcinoma and well below the rate for White men in the United States ( ) (Devesa et al. 2005). In contrast, rates for squamous cell carcinoma were similar for men in the United States and Canada in this period and in women as well (Devesa et al. 2005). Based on data up to 1997, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lung did not appear to be increasing over time in Canada. Instead, the data suggest that squamous cell carcinoma was decreasing so that adenocarcinoma represented an increasing fraction of lung cancers over time (Devesa et al. 2005).\n\nFigure 6.14\n\nTrends in incidence rates for lung cancer (age adjusted, world standard), by histologic type (squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma) and geographic area, 1980–1982 to 1995–1997. Source: Devesa et al. 2005. Reprinted (more...)\n\nIn Australia, where flue-cured, unblended cigarettes with low tobacco-specific nitrosamine levels are also prominent, the rate of adenocarcinoma among men rose across birth cohorts and over time and exceeded the rates of squamous cell carcinoma for the most recent cohorts (Blizzard and Dwyer 2002). In contrast, the rate of adenocarcinoma among men in New South Wales, Australia, remained essentially constant between 1985 and 1997 ( ) (Devesa et al. 2005) or rose only slightly over time. However, the rate for squamous cell carcinoma in 1995–1997 among New South Wales men declined to a level approximating that of adenocarcinoma ( ) (Joshua et al. 2005). Similarly in South Australia, the rate of adenocarcinoma among men through 2000 was also relatively consistent over time, and the rate of squamous cell carcinoma fell to the same level as adenocarcinoma (Nguyen et al. 2003). However, in South Australia, the rate of adenocarcinoma increased among younger age groups.\n\nWhen comparing the United States and Australia, the different patterns of cigarettes smoked may contribute to different patterns of lung cancer. presents gender- and age-specific rates of lung cancer mortality for the United States and Australia for 2000 (Peto et al. 2006). Lung cancer death rates were lower in all age groups for men and women in Australia compared with the United States. Detailed comparisons of smoking behaviors similar to those used to model U.S. death rates are not available for Australia, but estimates of the prevalence of smoking show a general similarity for Australia and the United States, particularly during the 1990s (White et al. 2003).\n\nFigure 6.15\n\nAge-specific rates of lung cancer death, by gender and age group, in the United States and Australia, 2000. Source: Peto et al. 2006.\n\npresents information on adenocarcinoma as a proportion of all lung cancers with a designated histologic type, by birth cohort and gender for the United States and Australia (Burns et al. 2011a). In Australia, a modest rise occurs in the proportion of lung cancers that are adenocarcinoma across the birth cohorts for both genders, but the fraction remains well below 50% for men and only slightly above 50% for women. Data for the United States show a much more dramatic increase in the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma, with the proportion exceeding 60% in the most recent cohorts for White men and women. Notably, the earliest birth cohorts for the U.S. population, those born from 1880–1900, have proportions similar to those found in Australia.\n\nFigure 6.16\n\nAdenocarcinoma as a percentage of designated lung cancers in U.S. White men and women and Australian men and women, by various birth cohorts, 1890–1955.

Reprinted with permission from Science & Business Media (more...)\n\nIn summary, rates for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung have been decreasing in most countries in which the prevalence of smoking has been declining. In contrast, the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma has been rising in the United States and has been level or increasing in other countries, with the general result that adenocarcinoma has increased as a proportion of lung cancer in most countries. The magnitude of that increase has differed between the United States, where the predominant type of cigarette is made of blended tobacco with relatively high levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and Canada and Australia, where flue-cured cigarettes with lower levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines predominate. Incidence rates of adenocarcinoma and the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma are substantially higher in the United States than in Canada and Australia.\n\nEffects of Filter Ventilation on Deposition of Smoke in the Lung and the Toxicity of This Smoke\n\nOne potential explanation for the rise in adenocarcinoma of the lung in the United States is a change in the pattern of smoking after ventilated filters were introduced to lower the machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine (Zheng et al. 1994; Thun et al. 1997a; Wingo et al. 1999). Smokers who shift to brands with nominally lower machine-measured yields with ventilated filters change their smoking pattern to restore their nicotine delivery to the level needed to sustain their addiction. As described previously, changes include increasing puff volume and velocity, greater duration of puffing, and shortening the intervals between puffs (NCI 2001). In addition, smokers may increase the depth of inhalation and hold the smoke in their lungs longer to increase nicotine uptake. Notably, there is little difference in markers of nicotine ingestion between smokers of brands of cigarettes with substantially different machine yields (Jarvis et al. 2001; NCI 2001). Increasing depth of inhalation and other more intense smoking patterns likely increase the deposition of smoke in the alveolar region of the lung.\n\nMost physical models of particles disseminating in the lung incorporate the size-dependence of particle deposition in the lung, but do not fully reflect the complexity of smoking behavior. As a consequence, the models may underestimate the fraction of smoke particles retained in the lung (Stratton et al. 2001; Gower and Hammond 2007; Rostami 2009), raising questions about their validity in characterizing the distribution and deposition of particles in different regions of the lung with different tobacco products. An analysis by Gower and Hammond (2007) of models of cigarette smoke deposition that examined the effects of the changes in pattern of smoking after a shift to brands with lower machine-measured yields showed that puff time, inhalation depth, time holding one's breath, and exhalation time may affect total smoke deposition. While a shift in deposition to the alveolar level remains a possibility, the researchers could not determine whether the changes in patterns of smoking resulting from the use of more highly ventilated cigarettes could produce a large enough shift in the location of deposition to change the pattern of incidence of a specific histologic type of lung cancer. Although the magnitude of the potential change in regional deposition in the lung remains uncertain, existing evidence suggests that changes in the pattern of smoking, with a shift to lower tar-yield cigarettes, will likely increase the fraction of cigarette smoke particles deposited in the alveolar region of the lung. This shift may also have played a role in increasing the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung over time.\n\nThe introduction of ventilated filters, or changes in the design and composition of cigarettes that accompanied their introduction, may have increased the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke. Given the dilution of smoke by filter ventilation and the compensation for that dilution by smokers when these cigarettes are used, comparisons of the toxicity of cigarettes on a per-cigarette basis can be misleading, making comparisons on the basis of “per mg tar” or “per mg total particulate matter” more useful.\n\nThe level of filter ventilation alters the composition of tobacco smoke. In general, based on the International Organization for Standardization protocol and under more intense smoking parameters, higher levels of ventilation result in more complete combustion in flue-cured, unblended cigarettes smoked by a machine (Adam et al. 2010). When experimental (Rickert et al. 2007) or commercial (Roemer et al. 2004) U.S.-blended cigarettes were compared with experimental, unblended, flue-cured cigarettes (Monitor-7 Canadian reference cigarette) in mutagenicity testing, the level of revertants per mg (the indicator of mutational strength) of the total particulate matter was lower for the unblended Canadian reference cigarette. For Kentucky reference cigarettes, mutagenicity per mg of total particulate matter was 30–40% lower for unfiltered cigarettes than for the same cigarette with a filter added (Shin et al. 2009).\n\nTobacco industry documents show internal company research demonstrating that increasing filter ventilation increases the mutagenicity of the resultant tar on a per-mg of tar basis (Johnson et al. 2009). The published evidence produced by the industry is less clear. In a study from R.J. Reynolds, Chepiga and colleagues (2000) compared full-flavor, full-flavor low-tar, and ultralow-tar cigarettes and reported a nonsignificant trend of increased revertants per mg of tar in mutagenicity studies as the level of machine-measured tar decreased. In a study from Philip Morris, Roemer and colleagues (2004) reported that higher total yields of particulate matter were associated with a trend toward less mutagenic activity per mg of total particulate matter. In another study from Philip Morris, Patskan and colleagues (2008) compared the mutagenic activity of Marlboro full flavor, Marlboro Lights, and Marlboro Ultra Lights, finding that mutagenic activity was higher per mg of total particulate matter for Marlboro Ultra Lights, but this was for only some Salmonella strains used in the mutagenicity testing and for only some runs. Thus, the evidence supports a modest increase in the mutagenicity of tobacco tar as the level of machine-measured tar falls; this effect may result from increased ventilation.\n\nThese data should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. Mutagenicity is generally used as only a screening test, is often poorly associated with carcinogenicity in humans, and has not been quantitatively associated with differences in human risk. In addition, most of the studies described previously compared smoke generated under standardized machine-testing protocols. In actual use, smokers change their patterns of smoking, compensating for the design changes that result in lower yields of machine-measured tar and nicotine. This compensatory smoking behavior makes comparisons of cigarettes with very different machine-tested yields difficult to interpret relative to carcinogenicity in humans when the smoke for the different cigarettes is generated using a single, standardized, machine-smoking protocol.\n\nExisting evidence about changes in the patterns of smoking cigarettes with low yields of tar and high ventilation supports a shift in the deposition of smoke in the lung toward the alveolar region; this shift likely contributes to the observed increase in adenocarcinoma of the lung. Research has not clarified whether the magnitude of this shift in lung deposition, by itself, is great enough to explain the dramatic increase in adenocarcinoma observed in the United States. The mutagenicity of tobacco tar from cigarettes with lower yields of machine-measured tar is trending upward. However, the trend is modest in size, and difficulties in extrapolating results from mutagenicity testing to risk for humans make it difficult to know whether these changes contribute to increasing the risk of lung cancer.\n\nEvidence Synthesis\n\nThe design and composition of cigarettes have changed substantively since the first major wave of evidence linking smoking to lung cancer in the 1950s. Although the details of these changes are only partially understood, changes in design—notably the addition of ventilated filters—have clearly changed the pattern of smoking, including more intense puffing. In addition, changes in the composition of cigarettes have resulted in incompletely characterized alterations in the chemical composition of cigarette smoke. Documented changes include increases in tobacco-specific nitrosamines and decreases in PAHs in the smoke of U.S. cigarettes. Substantial differences between U.S. cigarettes and those of many other nations include the use of blended tobacco in U.S. cigarettes and the use of unblended, flue-cured tobacco in cigarettes in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The United States has somewhat preceded most other developed countries in the adoption of filtered and low-yield, machine-tested cigarettes, but U.S. products are also used widely in most countries. These changes raise a question of whether rates of lung cancer have been altered by the changes in the design and composition of cigarettes—changes that were accompanied by an initial belief that lower yields of machine-tested tar might signal a lower risk for lung cancer. In fact, the risk of lung cancer in the United States may have increased as a result of such changes.\n\nComparison of results of CPS-I and CPS-II—two large epidemiologic studies conducted 20 years apart by ACS—demonstrated an increased risk of death from lung cancer from smoking across the 20-year interval between the studies. For female smokers, the results from the contemporary cohorts show that lung cancer risk continued to rise through 2000–2010. Modeling of risks of lung cancer from smoking behaviors suggests that risk estimates based on the smoking experience in the 1960s underestimated the current incidence of lung cancer. In addition, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lung and the proportion of lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically during the past several decades. This shift from squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma is confined to smokers, because neither the overall risk of lung cancer nor the risk of adenocarcinoma has changed over time among never smokers. The rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has declined in the United States since the 1980s and is well-predicted by declines in smoking behaviors, but the rate of adenocarcinoma continued to rise for an additional 10–15 years before either leveling off or beginning to decline. Birth-cohort-specific analyses of trends in overall mortality from lung cancer and the incidence of type-specific lung cancer suggest that increases in diagnostic accuracy, differences by tumor type in the time course of excess risk reduction with cessation, and underestimation of the effect of intensity and duration of smoking in the studies that defined risk in the 1960s do not explain the observed trends. In contrast, a change in the risk of the cigarettes smoked over time does explain the increase in risk. A shift in the demographic composition of smokers toward those groups with less income and education may contribute to the increased risk of lung cancer among smokers, but this shift does not likely explain the increase in adenocarcinoma or the difference in the rates of incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.\n\nMost countries have experienced increases in the proportion of all lung cancer that is adenocarcinoma, but substantial differences are found in the extent of this increase when comparing the United States, where blended cigarettes are used, with Australia and Canada, where unblended cigarettes are used. Adenocarcinoma in the United States has increased more steeply, represents a much higher fraction of lung cancer, and has higher absolute incidence rates than those of Australia or Canada. Compared with unblended cigarettes, U.S.-style blended cigarettes have dramatically higher levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines—an organ-specific carcinogen of adenocarcinoma of the lung in animals. Exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines is also much higher among U.S. smokers than among their counterparts in Australia and Canada. Levels of a metabolite of NNK, a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, are an independent risk predictor for the occurrence of lung cancer after controlling for the intensity and duration of smoking.\n\nCompensatory changes in the patterns of puffing and inhaling smoke by smokers switching to cigarettes with low yields of toxicants may increase the deposition of smoke particles in the alveolar region of the lung. This is supported by modeling of particle deposition in the lung that suggests this effect likely increases the deposition of particles in the alveolar region. Increased alveolar deposition and increasing tobacco-specific nitrosamine levels over time may have combined to increase the risk for adenocarcinoma.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe evidence is sufficient to conclude that the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the lung from cigarette smoking has increased since the 1960s.\n\nThe evidence is sufficient to conclude that the increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung in smokers results from changes in the design and composition of cigarettes since the 1950s.\n\nThe evidence is not sufficient to specify which design changes are responsible for the increased risk of adenocarcinoma, but there is suggestive evidence that ventilated filters and increased levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines have played a role.\n\nThe evidence shows that the decline of squamous cell carcinoma follows the trend of declining smoking prevalence.\n\nImplications\n\nThe evidence presented has multiple implications. Above all, if the risk of lung cancer has increased with changes in the design and composition of cigarettes, then the potential exists to reverse that increase in risk through changes in design and composition. Even a modest reduction in the large burden of mortality from lung cancer would result in saving substantial numbers of lives over time.\n\nThe evidence reviewed suggests that differences in the design and composition of cigarettes may contribute to differences in smoking-related risks of lung cancer in different populations and different geographic locations. Data also suggest that epidemiologic studies treating all cigarettes as having identical risks, or using single biomarkers of exposure to quantify actual exposure to the multiple carcinogens in cigarette smoke, should be undertaken with some caution. The number of cigarettes smoked per day, measures of cotinine in biologic samples, and other measures of total smoke exposure will remain useful for estimating total smoke exposure and population risk. However, the potential for differences in products to yield differences in risk suggests that a broader array of biomarkers of exposure should be used to examine whether differences in the toxicity and composition of a given total exposure to smoke may also play an important role in determining differences in risks.\n\nThe changing risk for lung cancer associated with cigarettes over time also has implications for the surveillance of tobacco products. Monitoring tobacco products needs to go beyond tracking the most obvious changes, such as the addition of a filter, to assess the characteristics of the tobacco in the cigarette, how the product is manufactured, how it is likely to be smoked, the design of the cigarette, and its performance under a variety of smoking patterns. The absence of such information for past and current tobacco products limits the ability to more fully study the effects of changes in the design and composition of cigarettes on risks of disease. The availability of such information could help in the assessment of potential differences in risks going forward.\n\nFinally, the rise in the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung from smoking was unanticipated. This experience, like that of cigarettes with purportedly low yields of toxicants, indicates that changes to cigarettes should undergo careful, evidence-based assessments as such changes are being considered.\n\nLiver Cancer\n\nIn many parts of the world, liver cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality. Primary liver cancer, the great majority of which is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), generally presents at an advanced stage with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Although worldwide liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in terms of incidence, it represents the third most common cause of cancer-related death (Ferlay et al. 2010).\n\nA number of strong risk factors for HCC have been identified, including infection with the hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV, HCV), exposure to aflatoxins, and alcohol-associated cirrhosis (London and McGlynn 2006). The incidence of liver cancer varies geographically worldwide, with rates generally consistent with the regional prevalence of the primary viral etiologic factors (Nordenstedt et al. 2010). Globally, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa—with endemic HBV infection and common dietary exposure to aflatoxins—have the highest incidence of HCC. Rates of HCC appear to have stabilized or started to decline in several Asian countries, where widespread vaccination against HBV and reduction of HBV cofactors have occurred during the past few decades (Yuen et al. 2009). HCV infection has been the primary etiologic agent for HCC in various countries having substantial incidence of HCC (London and McGlynn 2006).\n\nHistorically, the United States has had a low incidence of liver cancer and low death rates for the disease. However, rates of HCC have been increasing in the United States over the last two decades (Altekruse et al. 2009; El-Serag 2011). In recent years, Whites and Blacks, particularly those 50–59 years of age, have experienced the largest annual percentage increases in rates of HCC; rates of HCC among Asians/Pacific Islanders have been stable (O'Connor et al. 2010). The increased rates of HCC in the United States appear to be largely a consequence of chronic HCV infection (El-Serag 2004). However, obesity, diabetes, and associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and the substantial burden of chronic HBV infection among foreign-born Asians may also be potential contributors to the increasing incidence of HCC (Larsson and Wolk 2007; Starley et al. 2010). In addition to viral hepatitis, cirrhosis from consumption of alcohol represents an important cause of HCC worldwide (London and McGlynn 2006). HCC is more common among men than women, which likely reflects gender differences in exposure to viral hepatitis and rates of progression of that disease, differences in smoking and in consumption of alcohol, and perhaps hormonal differences.\n\nThe association between smoking and HCC is complicated by the potential for confounding with the causal factors of consumption of alcohol and HBV and HCV infection. For example, people who drink alcohol are more likely to be smokers than people who do not drink alcohol (Dawson 2000). In addition, most HCV infections worldwide are acquired by injecting drugs, and the prevalence of smoking is very high among injection drug users (Marshall et al. 2011). In regions of the world with a high incidence of HCC, HBV infection is generally acquired perinatally or during early childhood. However, in other regions, HBV may be more commonly acquired through parenteral or sexual transmission; these behaviors may also be associated with smoking. Hence, the potential confounders must be examined carefully when assessing the association between smoking and HCC. However, considerable epidemiologic evidence, including data from studies in which measures have been taken to address potential confounding, indicates that smokers are at an increased risk for liver cancer (IARC 2004).\n\nConclusions of Previous Surgeon General's Reports\n\nThe Surgeon General's report on smoking cessation (USDHHS 1990) noted an association between smoking and HCC that persisted after controlling for potentially confounding lifestyle factors, including consumption of alcohol. The report also noted that HBV infections may modify the effects of smoking on the risk of liver cancer. The Surgeon General's report on women and smoking (USDHHS 2001) concluded that smoking may be a contributing factor to the development of liver cancer. The Surgeon General's report on the health consequences of smoking (USDHHS 2004) noted a consistent association between smoking and HCC after controlling for potentially confounding factors, but it called for further consideration of the history of viral hepatitis and consumption of alcohol. Overall, the 2004 report concluded that although the data were suggestive of an association between smoking and liver cancer, further evidence was required to classify smoking as a cause of liver cancer.\n\nBiologic Basis\n\nCirculating carcinogens from tobacco smoke are metabolized in the liver, exposing the liver to many absorbed carcinogens. Experimental studies have identified several constituents of tobacco smoke (e.g., N-nitrosodimethylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl) as liver carcinogens (IARC 2004). Limited human data on smoke-related carcinogens have suggested increased levels of 4-aminobiphenyl and PAH adducts in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues (Wang et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2002). Therefore, long-term exposure to carcinogens in smoke may lead to cellular damage in the liver and contribute to the development of cancer. Cigarette smoking may also contribute to liver carcinogenesis through the development of liver fibrosis (Dev et al. 2006; Mallat et al. 2008; Altamirano and Bataller 2010). Similar to their effects on other fibrogenic conditions (e.g., cardiac, renal, or pancreatic diseases), components of smoke may induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress pathways, and direct fibrogenic mediators (e.g., transforming growth factor-β1, angiotensin II) (Altamirano and Bataller 2010). Smoking has also been recognized as a risk factor for primary biliary cirrhosis, which itself can progress to HCC (Zein et al. 2006; Corpechot et al. 2012; Smyk et al. 2012). Although their results have been inconsistent, several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that smoking substantially increases the risk for progression from chronic liver disease to HCC (Tsukuma et al. 1993; Marrero et al. 2005; Fujita et al. 2006). Further clarification is needed of the mechanistic and epidemiologic effects of smoking in relation to potential etiologic agents that can influence these pathways (chronic inflammation and/or oxidative stress associated with HCV infection, obesity, or diabetes).\n\nEpidemiologic Evidence\n\nSince the 2004 report of the Surgeon General, 90 additional studies have been published or identified that report on the association between smoking and liver cancer. IARC (2004) concluded that there was sufficient evidence of a causal association between cigarette smoking and liver cancer. Subsequently, Lee and colleagues (2009) published a meta-analysis that was based on the studies considered in the 2004 IARC report.\n\nStudies for the current review were compiled by searching the MEDLINE database (from January 1966 to December 2012) using the medical subject headings “tobacco,” “smoking,” “liver neoplasms,” or “hepatocellular carcinoma” and by examining references cited in the previous Surgeon General's reports, the IARC (2004) monograph on smoking and liver cancer, and the associated meta-analysis (Lee et al. 2009). The epidemiologic data came from a wide range of studies in both low- and high-incidence countries (Tables 6.3S and "
