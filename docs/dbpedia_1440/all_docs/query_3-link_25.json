        "text": "4. Discussion\n\nIn this study of Veterans with military-related exposures and associated health conditions, we found a number of associations with the microbial taxonomic composition of the gut, including bipolar disorders, severe depressive symptoms based on the BDI, PVD, gastroenteritis, opioid and stimulant use disorders, beta-blockers, SNRI antidepressants, diabetes medications, and GI medications including PPIs, and omeprazole, which is a specific type of PPI. Gut microbiota functional composition was associated with overall perceived physical health (SF-36 PCS), CHF, use of muscle relaxers, omeprazole, and supplemental vitamin use. Military service-related characteristics and conditions, such as deployment history, combat exposure, PTSD, and number of TBIs, were not among the strongest correlates of overall gut microbiota metrics, such as α- or β-diversity. However, there were several notable differences in taxonomic relative abundance associated with deployments, as well as with many of the health-related metrics and disorders that are highly prevalent among Veterans, including insomnia, bipolar and anxiety disorders, and depressive symptoms.\n\nWe observed that age, race, and sex correlated with the gut microbiota composition, as has been observed in many other population studies, including the Human Microbiome Project (Jackson et al., 2018; Falony et al., 2016; Human Microbiome Project, 2012). Mental health conditions were highly prevalent among the US-VMP cohort, and we found that bipolar disorders were associated with bacterial community structure. Previous findings on the community composition of the gut microbiota and bipolar disorders are mixed, with some showing community level differences in individuals with bipolar disorders (Coello et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2017) and others finding no such differences (Vinberg et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Painold et al., 2019). There were many taxonomic differences cited by previous studies associated with bipolar disorders, specifically, increased Actinobacteria (Painold et al., 2019), increased Flavonifractor (Coello et al., 2019), and inconsistent associations with Faecalibacterium (Coello et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2017). Our study found that Bacteroides was increased in individuals with bipolar disorders, but this is somewhat difficult to interpret as this is a very common member of the human gut microbiota with wide-ranging correlations. Some prior studies separated bipolar disorders into the clinical subtypes of I and II (Coello et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2017; Aizawa et al., 2016), or differentiated bipolar individuals based on severity of current symptoms (Painold et al., 2019) or pharmacological intervention (Flowers et al., 2017, 2019), which we did not. Additionally, we found decreased Ruminococcus 1 in participants that suffered from severe depressive symptoms based on the BDI. One study that recruited 115 participants experiencing bipolar disorders reported a lower abundance of the family Ruminococcaceae compared to control participants (Evans et al., 2017), though the consistency of this result is difficult to assess as this is a broad and diverse family.\n\nWe showed an increase in Blautia genus of the Firmicutes phylum in individuals with anxiety disorders as determined by the SCID-5-I/P W/PSY SCREEN (First et al., 2016). Gacias et al. showed that Blautia was associated with increases in anxiety-like behavior (social avoidance) in mice (Gacias et al., 2016). Blautia has also been correlated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. (Ozato et al., 2019; Egshatyan et al., 2015). However, other work has suggested that Blautia may have protective effects in some contexts (Wong et al., 2016; Jenq et al., 2015), and a recent study found an inverse association in men between Blautia abundance and anxiety (Taylor et al., 2019) measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) – although this was a pilot study, and the findings could be spurious due to the large number of comparisons made.\n\nMany of the physical and mental health conditions correlated with the gut microbiota in this study, such as gastroenteritis, CVD, anxiety disorders, and affective disorders, have been associated with underlying inflammation (Dickerson et al., 2016; Goldsmith et al., 2016; Vivinus-Nébot et al., 2014; Namazi et al., 2018; Hamjane et al., 2020). It is also worth noting that among military Veterans there is evidence linking exposure to traumatic stressors and subsequent diagnoses of mental health conditions (e.g., PTSD) to the development of future physical health conditions (e.g., CVD) (Dyball et al., 2019). Increased permeability of the GI lumen, commonly referred to as “leaky gut”, which also has been shown to lead to exaggerated inflammation (Camilleri, 2019), has been identified in those suffering from affective, GI (e.g., inflammatory bowel disorders [IBD]), and cardiovascular disorders (Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2012; Bischoff et al., 2014; Novakovic et al., 2020). Similarly, it is common for those GI and cardiovascular disorders to have comorbid affective disorders (Wilmes et al., 2021; Cohen et al., 2015). Given the high rates of inflammatory disorders among Veterans (Tanielian et al., 2008; Breland et al., 2017), this is an important population within which to study the microbiota-gut-brain axis and physical and mental health. We predeominantly focused on lifetime diagnoses of mental health conditions because we were not adequately powered to examine current mental health conditions, or to compare short-term versus long-term conditions. However, this is an important area for future research, as there is some evidence that prolonged exposure to mental health conditions can lead to enhanced immunological and inflammatory changes (Dickerson et al., 2016; Goldsmith et al., 2016).\n\nNumber of deployments showed a positive relationship with Prevotella 6 and Collinsella and a negative relationship with Bifidobacterium. A deployment is a temporary relocation of a military service member, typically to an international location, and can vary in length from three to fifteen months and does not necessarily include combat. Relocation inherently involves the exposure to different environmental microbes (Barberán et al., 2015), changes in diet (Turnbaugh et al., 2009b), novel living quarters (Lax et al., 2014), and novel cohabitants (Song et al., 2013), all of which have been shown to influence the gut microbiome. Prevotella is a highly diverse genus with numerous clades, many of which are typically underrepresented in Westernized countries (Tett et al., 2019). Veterans with multiple deployments may have increased exposure to these types of microbes that are less common among Western populations, which could explain this finding. Collinsella has been associated with low dietary fiber intake and high circulating insulin (Gomez-Arango et al., 2018). There is high prevalence of insulin resistance and diabetes among Veterans (Liu et al., 2017), and the US-VMP cohort generally has a homogeneous, Western-style diet, low in dietary fiber, and high in animal foods, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars (Flowers et al., 2017). A reduction in dietary fiber intake could result in a general switch in the gut away from short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and toward more lactate fermentation processes (Pylkas et al., 2005). Bifidobacterium has many known probiotic strains and has been largely considered a genus comprised of beneficial microbes (Azad et al., 2018). Bifidobacterium species are generally known for their ability to catabolize complex carbohydrates and produce the necessary substrates for the Bif Shunt metabolic pathway (O'Callaghan and van Sinderen, 2016). The Bif Shunt pathway breaks down phosphates to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and produces SCFAs as end products (O'Callaghan and van Sinderen, 2016). SCFAs are important signaling molecules, and they can influence systemic inflammation by reducing inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-⍺) and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (Vinolo et al., 2011). However, they have also been associated with obesity and may reflect an increased capacity to harvest energy from food (Gentile and Weir, 2018).\n\nOur results show that the most common medications among Veterans in the US-VMP were comparable to adults in the US as a whole, antidepressants and CVD-related medications, including lipid-lowering medications, beta-blockers, and ACEIs (Hales et al., 2019). The prevalence of antidepressants and other mental health medication prescriptions was higher in the US-VMP than in the US generally, which is likely due to recruitment of Veterans that were actively seeking healthcare from a VHA medical center. It is important to note that some of the commonly prescribed medications in this cohort were classified as treatment for a specific condition based on the classification system from Epocrates, (Epocrates) but that in this population, it is likely that certain medications were being used off-label to address other conditions (Leslie et al., 2009). For example, 18% of the cohort was prescribed “seizure medications,” but drugs within this class of neurological medications (e.g., gabapentin) are often used in the VHA at a lower dosage as mood stabilizers or for pain control (Ketter et al., 2003). Another example is prazosin, which in was classified as a blood pressure lowering medication, but is frequently used among Veterans to treat PTSD-related nightmares (Raskind et al., 2018).\n\nWe found that PPIs, particularly omeprazole, as well as other GI medications (which included digestive enzymes and heart burn medications, most commonly ranitidine) showed a strong correlation with overall gut microbiota composition and functional pathways. This is not surprising, as these medications target the gut function. PPIs increase the gut pH, which alters the types of microbes that can survive and grow (Duncan et al., 2009). This finding is consistent with prior literature showing that these commonly prescribed medications are associated with alterations in the gut microbiota, such as lower microbial diversity and increases in potentially commensal microbes, specifically the genera of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and the potentially pathogenic species Escherichia coli. We likewise saw an association between increased Streptococcus and PPIs (Imhann et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2016). These alterations in the gut microbiota composition are likely not entirely benign, as use of PPIs is also associated with an increased risk of enteric infections, including C. difficile (Janarthanan et al., 2012), which carries a high mortality risk (Oake et al., 2010) and is known to respond well to restoration of a healthy microbiota composition through fecal microbiota transplant therapy (Youngster et al., 2014). Moreover, these findings are particulary relevant in light of recent wide-spread PPI de-implementation strategies, based on findings suggesting that many PPI prescriptions are inappropriate (Orelio et al., 2021).\n\nIn some cases, it was difficult to isolate whether a condition or its treatment was more strongly associated with the gut microbiota. For example, we saw that PVD, SNRIs, and beta-blockers were associated with differences in the gut microbiota composition. There were only nine individuals with PVD in the cohort; almost half of them were on beta-blockers, and one-third were on SNRIs, making it difficult to tease apart these effects. This is an important area for further research as PVD showed some of the most pervasive associations with gut microbiota characteristics, including with ⍺-diversity, overall gut microbiota community composition and relative abundance of Faecalibacterium. In a recent study of atherosclerotic CVD, disease status was more strongly associated with the gut microbiota than CVD medication (Jie et al., 2017). However, the relationships among disease, medications, and the gut microbiota are complex, and the efficacy of some medications may be dependent on interactions with the gut microbiota. This is thought to be the case with metformin, the most frequently prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes (Vallianou et al., 2019). Our results confirm those of other studies that diabetes medications are associated with alterations in the overall gut microbiota (Jackson et al., 2018; Vallianou et al., 2019)."
