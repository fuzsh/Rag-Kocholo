Han2 Abstract Animal migrations are often spectacular, and migratory species har- bor zoonotic pathogens of importance to humans. Animal migrations are expected to enhance the global spread of pathogens and facilitate cross- species transmission. This does happen, but new research has also shown that migration allows hosts to escape from infected habitats, reduces disease levels when infected animals do not migrate successfully, and may lead to the evolution of less-virulent pathogens. Migratory demands can also reduce immune function, with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality. Studies of pathogen dynamics in migratory species and how these will re- spond to global change are urgently needed to predict future disease risks for wildlife and humans alike. 1ââOriginally printed as Altizer et al. 2011.

The most dramatic migrations, such as those by monarch butterflies (Figure A1-1), gray whales, and some shore- birds and dragonflies (Figure A1-2), span entire continents or hemispheres, can take several months to complete, and are accompanied by high energetic demands and extreme physiological changes. The ultimate cause of these seasonal migra- tions remains debated; most hypotheses focus on avoidance of food scarcity, seeking physiologically optimal climates, and avoiding predation during periods FIGURE A1-1â Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), shown here at a wintering site in central Mexico, undertake one of the longest distance two-way migrations of any insect species worldwide. Monarchs are commonly infected by a debilitating protozoan parasite that can lower the flight ability of migrating butterflies.\n\nAPPENDIX A 113 FIGURE A1-2âRepresentative migratory species, including migration distances and routes, known parasites and pathogens, and major threats to species persistence.

Contemporary studies of migra- tion have uncovered mechanisms of animal navigation, energy budgets, resource use, and phenological responses to environmental change; migratory species have also been recognized for their potential to connect geographically distant habitats and transfer large amounts of biomass and nutrients between ecosystems [reviewed in (Bowlin et al., 2010)]. These studies illustrate the profound ecologi- cal and evolutionary consequences of migratory journeys for animal populations on a global scale. Owing to their long-distance movements and exposure to diverse habitats, migratory animals have far-reaching implications for the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Importantly, most previous work on the role of host move- ment in infectious disease dynamics has focused on spatially localized or random dispersal. For example, dispersal events give rise to traveling waves of infection in pathogens such as raccoon rabies (Russell et al., 2005), influenza in humans (Viboud et al., 2006), and nuclear polyhedrosis viruses in insects (White et al., 2000). In the context of metapopulations, limited amounts of host movement could actually prevent host extinction in the face of a debilitating pathogen and allow host resistance genes to spread (Carlsson-Granner and Thrall, 2002; Gog et al., 2002). From a different perspective, case studies of species invasions dem- onstrate that one-time transfers of even a few individuals can transport pathogens long distances and introduce them to novel habitats (Daszak et al., 2000). Yet relatively few studies have examined how regular, directed mass movements that characterize seasonal migration affect the transmission and evolution of patho- gens within host populations and the response of migratory species to infection risks. In this article, we review the consequences of long-distance migrations for the ecological dynamics of hostâpathogen interactions and outline key challenges for future work. Ecological processes linked with migration can increase or de- crease the between-host transmission of pathogens, depending on host migratory behavior and pathogen traits (Figure A1-3). Moreover, new work shows that for some species, the energetic demands of migration compromise host immunity, possibly increasing susceptibility to infection and intensifying the impacts of dis- ease. Importantly, many migratory species are at risk of future declines because of habitat loss and exploitation, and animal migrations are shifting with ongoing anthropogenic change (Wilcove, 2008). Thus, understanding how human activi- ties that alter migratory patterns influence wildlifeâpathogen dynamics is urgently needed to help guide conservation and management of migratory species and mitigate future risks from infectious disease. What Goes Around Comes Around: Pathogen Exposure and Spatial Spread An oft-cited but poorly supported assumption is that long-distance move- ments of migrating animals can enhance the geographic spread of pathogens,\n\nAPPENDIX A 115 FIGURE A1-3â Points along a general annual migratory cycle where key processes can increase (red text) or decrease (blue text) pathogen exposure or transmission. Behavioral mechanisms such as migratory escape and migratory culling could reduce overall pathogen prevalence. As animals travel to distant geographic locations, the use of multiple habitat types including stopover sites, breeding areas, and wintering grounds can increase trans- mission as a result of host aggregations and exposure to multihost pathogens. This might be especially true for migratory staging areas where animals stop to rest and refuel. High energetic demands of spring and fall migration can also result in immunomodulation, pos- sibly leading to immune suppression and secondary infections. [Photo credits (clockwise): J.

Hall]\n\n116 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS including zoonotic pathogens important for human health such as Ebola virus in bats, avian influenza viruses in waterfowl and shorebirds, and Lyme disease and West Nile virus (WNV) in songbirds. For example, WNV initially spread in North America along a major corridor for migrating birds and rapidly expanded from its point of origin in New York City along the Atlantic seaboard from 1999 to 2000 (Rappole et al., 2000). Although experimental work concluded that pas- serine birds in migratory condition were competent hosts for WNV and could serve as effective dispersal agents (Owen et al., 2006), evidence to show that this expansion resulted from movements of migratory birds remains equivocal. For the zoonotic pathogen Ebola virus, a recent study points to the coincident timing of an annual influx of migratory fruit bats in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the start of human Ebola outbreaks in local villages during 2007 (Leroy et al., 2009). In central Kazakhstan, saiga antelopes (Saiga tatarica) become infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (Marshallagia) during the course of seasonal migration by grazing on pastures used by domesticated sheep earlier in the sea- son. As migration continues, saiga carry and transmit Marshallagia to northern sheep populations, leading to pulses of infection that coincide with annual saiga migrations (Morgan et al., 2007). The potential for serious disease risks for human and livestock health has raised alarm about the role of migratory species in moving infectious agents to distant locations. Yet surprisingly few examples of long-distance pathogen dispersal by migrating animals have been clearly documented in the published literature, and some studies indicate that migrants might be unfairly blamed for transporting pathogens. As a case in point, wild waterfowl (Anseriformes) and shorebirds (Charadriiformes) represent the major natural reservoirs for diverse strains of avian influenza virus (AIV) worldwide, including the highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 subtype that can lethally infect humans (Olsen et al., 2006). Although many of these migratory birds can become infected by HP H5N1, recent work incorporating what is known about viral shedding period, host migration phe- nology, and the geographical distribution of viral subtypes suggests that most wild birds are unlikely to spread HP H5N1 long distances (e.g., between Asia and the Americas) as previously suspected [e.g., (Krauss et al., 2007; Takekawa et al., 2010)]. Central to the question of how far any host species can transport a pathogen are the concepts of pathogen virulence and host tolerance to infection. Specifically, virulence refers to the damage that parasites inflict on their hosts, and tolerance refers to the hostâs ability to withstand infection without suffering major fitness costs. Thus, hostâparasite species or genotype combinations associ- ated with very low virulence or high tolerance should be the most promising can- didates for long-distance movement of pathogen strains, a simple prediction that could be explored within migratory species or using cross-species comparisons. Beyond their potential role in pathogen spatial spread, a handful of studies suggest that migratory species themselves encounter a broader range of pathogens from diverse environments throughout their annual cycle compared with species\n\nAPPENDIX A 117 residing in the same area year-round (Figure A1-3). One field study showed that songbird species migrating from Europe became infected by strains of vector- borne blood parasites originating from tropical bird species at overwintering sites in Africa (WaldenstrÃ¶m et al., 2002), in addition to the suite of parasite strains transmitted at their summer breeding grounds. The authors posited that winter exposure to parasites in tropical locations is a significant cost of migration, be- cause resident species wintering in northern latitudes encounter fewer parasite strains and do not experience year-round transmission. Similarly, the number of parasite species per host was positively related to distances flown by migratory waterfowl (Figuerola and Green, 2000), indicating that migrating animals could become exposed to parasites through encounters with different host species and habitat types. Although some animals undertake nonstop migrations, most migratory spe- cies use stopover points along the migration route to rest and feed. These stop- over points usually occur frequently along a journey, although some species like shorebirds fly thousands of kilometers between only a handful of staging areas (Dingle, 1996). Refueling locations are often shared by multiple species, and the high local densities and high species diversity can increase both within- and between-species transmission of pathogens. In one of the most striking examples of this phenomenon, shorebirds such as sanderlings (Calidris alba), ruddy turn- stones (Arenaria interpres; Figure A1-2), and red knots (Calidris canutus), which migrate annually between Arctic breeding grounds and South American wintering sites, congregate to feed in massive numbers in the Delaware Bay and the Bay of Fundy to rebuild fat reserves, leading to upwards of 1.5 million birds intermin- gling, at densities of over 200 birds per square meter (Krauss et al., 2010). This phenomenon creates an ecological hotspot at Delaware Bay, where the prevalence of AIV is 17 times greater than at any other surveillance site worldwide (Krauss et al., 2010). Leaving Parasites Behind: Migration as a Way of Lowering Infection Risk Although greater exposure to parasites and pathogens can pose a significant cost of long-distance migration, for some animal species, long-distance migration will reduce infection risk by at least two nonexclusive processes (Figure A1-3). First, if prolonged use of habitats allows parasites with environmental transmis- sion modes to accumulate (i.e., those parasites with infectious stages that can persist outside of hosts, such as many helminths, ectoparasites, and microbial pathogens with fecal-oral transmission), migration will allow animals to escape from contaminated habitats [i.e., âmigratory escapeâ (Loehle, 1995)]. Between intervals of habitat use, unfavorable conditions (such as harsh winters and a lack of hosts) could eliminate most parasites, resulting in hosts returning to these habitats after a long absence to encounter largely disease-free conditions (Loehle, 1995). Empirical support for migratory escape comes from a few well-studied\n\n118 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS hostâparasite interactions, including research on reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), which showed that the abundance of warble flies (Hypoderma tarandi) was nega- tively correlated with the distance migrated to summer pastures from reindeer calving grounds (the main larval shedding area in early spring) (Folstad et al., 1991). This observation prompted researchers to suggest that the reindeersâ an- nual postcalving migration reduces warble fly transmission by allowing animals to leave behind areas where large numbers of larvae have been shed (and where adult flies will later emerge). It is worth noting that escape will be less successful from pathogens with long-lived infectious stages that persist between periods of host absence or pathogens that cause chronic or life-long infections. Long-distance migration can also lower pathogen prevalence by removing infected animals from the population [i.e., âmigratory cullingâ (Bradley and Altizer, 2005)]. In this scenario, diseased animals suffering from the negative consequences of infection are less likely to migrate long distances owing to the combined physiological demands of migration and infection. Work on the migra- tory fall armyworm moth (Spodoptera frugiperda) suggested that insects infected by an ectoparasitic nematode (Noctuidonema guyanense) had reduced migratory ability because few to no parasites were detected in moths recolonizing sites as they returned north (Simmons and Rogers, 1991). More recent work on Bewickâs swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) showed that infection by low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses delayed migration over a month and reduced the travel distances of infected birds compared with those of healthy individuals (van Gils et al., 2007). However, a study of AIV in white fronted geese did not find any difference in distances migrated between infected and uninfected birds (Kleijn et al., 2010), suggesting that, not surprisingly, some species are better able to tolerate infections during long journeys and raising the possibility that migra- tion could select for greater tolerance to infections in some hosts due to the high fitness costs of attempting migration with a debilitating pathogen. Whether the net effects of migration will increase or decrease prevalence depends in large part on the mode of parasite transmission and the level of host specificity, both of which will affect opportunities for cross-species transmission at staging and stopover sites. Parasites that decline in response to host migra- tion may include specialist pathogens, as well as those with transmission stages that can build up in the environment, pathogens transmitted by biting vectors or intermediate hosts, or for which transmission occurs mainly from adults to juveniles during the breeding season (e.g., Box A1-1). Conversely, migrating hosts could experience higher pressure from generalist parasites if opportunities for cross-species transmission are high at stopover areas or wintering grounds or from specialist pathogens if transmission increases with dense host aggre- gations that accompany mass migrations. Importantly, effects of migration on pathogen dynamics within host populations should translate to large differences in prevalence across host populations with different migratory strategies. Over the past few years, we have focused on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus)\n\nAPPENDIX A 119 as a model system to study the effects of migration on hostâpathogen interac- tions (Box A1-1) and found that both migratory culling and migratory escape can cause spatiotemporal variation in prevalence within populations and extreme differences in prevalence among populations with different migratory strategies. However, we are not aware of intraspecific comparisons of prevalence between migratory and nonmigratory populations for other animal species. Immune Defense Balanced Against the Demands of Migration In addition to ecological mechanisms affecting between-host transmission, the physiological stress and energetic demands of migration can alter the out- come of infection within individuals through interactions with the hostâs im- mune system (Figure A1-2). More generally, because several immune pathways in both vertebrates and invertebrates are known to be costly (Eraud et al., 2005; Schmid-Hempel, 2005), seasonal demands such as premigratory fattening or strenuous activity will likely lower the resource pool available for mounting an immune response (Weber and Stilianakis, 2007). In anticipation of migration, for example, some animals accrue up to 50% of their lean body mass in fat, increase muscle mass, and atrophy organs that are not essential during migration (Dingle, 1996). Thus, before migration, animals might adjust components of their immune response to a desired level (i.e., immunomodulation), or the energetic demands of migration could reduce the efficacy of some immune pathways (i.e., immunosuppression). To date, the effects of long-distance migration on immune defenses have been best studied in birds. In a rare study of immune changes in wild individu- als during migration, field observations of three species of thrushes showed that migrating birds had lower baseline measures for several components of innate immunity (including leukocyte and lymphocyte counts), and exhibited lower fat reserves and higher energetic stress, relative to individuals measured outside of the migratory season (Owen and Moore, 2006). Captive experiments with Swainsonâs thrushes (Catharus ustulatus; Figure A1-2) later demonstrated that cell-mediated immunity was suppressed with the onset of migratory restlessness (the agitated behavior of birds that would normally precede their migratory depar- ture) (Owen and Moore, 2008a), suggesting that predictable changes in immunity occur in preparation for long-distance flight. In this species, the energetic costs of migration can intensify seasonal immune changes: Migrating thrushes that arrived at stopover sites in poorest condition had the lowest counts of immune cells (Owen and Moore, 2008b). The extent of altered immunity before and during migration is likely to be both species and resource dependent and will further depend on the specific im- mune pathway measured. Red knots, for example, exhibited no change in either antibody production or cell-mediated immunity after long flights in a wind tunnel, a result that argues against migration-mediated immunosuppression (Hasselquist\n\n120 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS BOX A1-1 Lessons from a Model System: Monarch Migration Drives Large-Scale Variation in Parasite Prevalence During the past 10 years, we studied monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) (top-right images) for the effects of seasonal migration on hostâpathogen dynamics. Monarchs in eastern North America (A) migrate up to 2,500 km each fall from as far north as Canada to wintering sites in Central Mexico (Brower and Malcolm, 1991). Monarchs in western North America (B) migrate shorter distances to winter along the coast of California (Nagano et al., 1993). Monarchs also form nonmigratory populations et al., 2007). Another study of captive red knots revealed no declines in costly immune defenses during the annual periods of mass gain (Buehler et al., 2008); however, animals in this study had constant access to high-quality food, which might have negated energetic trade-offs between immune investment and weight gain. Interestingly, barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) in better physical condition showed greater measures of cellular immunity during migration, cleared ecto- parasites and blood parasites more effectively, and arrived earlier at breeding grounds than birds with poor energy reserves (MÃ¸ller et al., 2004). These studies suggest that animals in robust condition or with access to resources might toler- ate long journeys without significant immunocompromise. Studies of migratory species to date also emphasize the need for a more detailed understanding of the\n\nAPPENDIX A 121 that breed year-round in southern Florida (C), Hawaiâi, the Caribbean Islands, and Central and South America (Ackery and Vane-Wright, 1984). Because monarchs are abundant and widespread and can be studied easily both in the wild and in captivity, field and experimental studies can explore effects of annual migra- tions on hostâpathogen ecology and evolution. A recent continent-scale analysis showed that parasite prevalence increased throughout the monarchsâ breeding season, with highest prevalence among adults associated with more intense habitat use and longer residency in eastern North America, consistent with the idea of migratory escape (bottom-right graph) (Bartel et al., 2010). Experiments showed that monarchs infected with O. elektroscirrha flew shorter distances and with reduced flight speeds, and field studies showed parasite prevalence de- creased as monarchs moved southward during their fall migrations (Bartel et al., 2010; Folstad et al., 1991), consistent with the idea of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also highest among butterflies sampled at the end of the breed- ing season than for those that reached their overwintering sites in Mexico (bot- tom right graph). Collectively, these processes have likely generated the striking differences in parasite prevalence reported among wild monarch populations with different migratory behaviors (bottom-left graph) (Altizer et al., 2000). Laboratory studies also showed that parasite isolates from the longest-distance migratory population in eastern North America (A) were less virulent than isolates from short-distance (B) and nonmigratory (C) populations (de Roode and Altizer, 2010; Altizer, 2001), suggesting that longer migration distances cull monarchs carrying virulent parasite genotypes. Work on this model system illustrates how multiple mechanisms can operate at different points along a migratory cycle and highlights the role that migration plays in keeping populations healthy. Monarch migrations are now considered an endangered phenomenon (Brower and Malcolm, 1991) due to deforestation of overwintering grounds, loss of critical breeding habitats, and climate-related shifts in migration phenology. If climate warming extends monarch breeding seasons into fall and winter months, migrations may eventually cease altogether. Evidence to date indicates that the loss of migration in response to mild winters and year-round resources could prolong exposure to parasites, elevate infection prevalence, and favor more virulent parasite genotypes. Images reproduced from (Bartel et al., 2010; Altizer et al., 2000). [Photos by S. Altizer] mechanisms linking nutrient intake and metabolic activity to innate and adaptive immune measures, a step that is essential to predicting how different immune pathways will respond to physiological changes that occur before and during long-distance migrations. Perhaps most importantly, immune changes that accompany long-distance migration could lead to a relapse of prior infections and more severe disease fol- lowing exposure to new pathogens, increasing the likelihood of migratory culling and lowering the probability of spatial spread. This possibility was investigated for Lyme disease in redwings (Turdus iliacus) (Gylfe et al., 2000). Consistent with results showing negative effects of migratory status on immunity, migratory restlessness alone was sufficient to reactivate latent Borrelia infections in captive\n\n122 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS birds. Thus, the demands of migration could ultimately lead to more severe in- fections and greater removal of infected hosts. Together, these results point to a role for migration-mediated immune changes in the dynamics of other wildlife pathogens, including zoonotic agents such as WNV (Owen et al., 2006) and bat- transmitted corona and rabies viruses (Li et al., 2005; Messenger et al., 2002). Effects of Anthropogenic Change and Climate Changes to the ecology of migratory species in the past century (Figure A1-2) could have enormous impacts on pathogen spread in wildlife and livestock, as well as altering human exposure to zoonotic infections. As one example, habitat loss caused by urbanization or agricultural expansion can eliminate stopover sites and result in higher densities of animals that use fewer remaining sites along the migration route (Wilcove, 2008). Although the resulting impacts on infectious diseases remain speculative, dense aggregations of animals at dwindling stopover sites might create ecological hot spots for pathogen transmission among wildlife species, as illustrated in the case of AIV in migrating shorebirds at Delaware Bay (Krauss et al., 2007). Moreover, continuing human encroachment on stopover habitats increases the likelihood of contact and spillover infection from wildlife reservoir hosts to humans and domesticated species. For some animal species, physical barriers such as fences (terrestrial species) or hydroelectric dams (aquatic species) impede migration (Berger et al., 2008), leaving animals to choose between navigating a narrow migratory corridor or forming nonmigratory populations. Consequently, pathogen prevalence could increase when animals stop migrating and become confined to smaller habitats, if parasite infectious stages build up with more intense use of a given habitat. Attempts to control cattle exposure to brucellosis from bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem illustrate these risks. Due to the potential threat of Brucella transmission from bison to cattle, bison are routinely culled if they leave the confines of Yellowstone National Park (Bienen and Tabor, 2006). Elk migration is less restricted, but there is evidence that supplemental feeding areas encourage the formation of dense nonmigratory populations that support higher prevalence of brucellosis, with 10 to 30% sero- prevalence in animals at the feeding grounds compared with 2 to 3% seropreva- lence in unfed elk ranging the park (Cross et al., 2010). High population densities in elk also correlate with higher gastrointestinal parasite loads at feeding grounds (Hines et al., 2007), suggesting that high densities of nonmigrating hosts lead to increasing intraspecific transmission of multiple parasites. More generally, human activities that discourage long-distance animal move- ments and encourage the formation of local year-round populations can cause the emergence of zoonotic pathogens in humans. For example, human-meditated environmental changes facilitated outbreaks of two zoonotic paramyxoviruses\n\nAPPENDIX A 123 carried by flying foxes (Pteropus fruit bats; Figure A1-2): These animals are highly mobile and seasonally nomadic in response to local food availability (Daszak et al., 2006). Anthropogenic changes such as deforestation and agricul- tural production likely influenced the emergence of lethal Nipah and Hendra virus outbreaks in humans in Australia and Malaysia in two key ways: by resource supplementation and habitat alteration limiting migratory behaviors of fruit bats and by facilitating close contact with domesticated virus-amplifying hosts (pigs and horses). In Malaysia, resident flying foxes foraging on fruit trees on or near pig farms transmitted Nipah virus to pigs, probably via urine or partially con- sumed fruit with subsequent spread from pigs to humans [(Daszak et al., 2006) and references therein]. Human activities are also thought to increase the risk of Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia by driving flying foxes from formerly forested areas into urban and suburban areas (Plowright et al., 2008), where they form dense nonmigratory colonies that aggregate in public gardens containing abundant food sources. In marine systems, aquaculture increases exposure to parasites in wild fish species, particularly in salmonids. Migration normally protects wild juvenile salmon from marine parasites in coastal waters by spatially separating them from infected wild adults offshore (KrkoÅ¡ek et al., 2007), but densely populated salmon farms place farmed fish enclosures adjacent to wild salmon migratory corridors, increasing the transmission of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) to wild juveniles returning to sea (KrkoÅ¡ek et al., 2007). Finally, climate change will alter infectious disease dynamics in some migra- tory species (Harvell et al., 2009). To survive, many migratory species must re- spond to climate changes by shifting migratory routes and phenology in response to temperature and the availability of key resources (i.e., flowering plants, insects) [e.g., (Saino et al., 2010)]. It is possible that changes in the timing of migration could disrupt the synchronicity of host and parasite life cycles, much in the way that ecological mismatch in migration timing or altered migratory routes could impact whether suitable food and habitat are available when migrants arrive. For example, the spawning periodicity of whale barnacles in calving lagoons of gray whales is a classic example of a parasite synchronizing its reproduction to overlap with a hostâs migratory cycle (Rice and Wolman, 1971). If the tim- ing of whale migrations and barnacle reproduction shift in response to different environmental cues, this could result in reduced infections over time. On the other hand, altered migration routes might facilitate contact between otherwise geographically separated host species, leading to novel pathogen introductions and increasing disease risks for some wildlife species (Harvell et al., 2009). One example of this phenomenon involves outbreaks of phocine distemper virus in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the North Sea, which was likely introduced by harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) migrating beyond their normal range and contacting harbor seal populations (Jensen et al., 2002). Moreover, if climate\n\n124 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS warming extends hostsâ breeding seasons, migrations may cease altogether, with year-round resident populations replacing migratory ones (Box A1-1), leading to greater pathogen prevalence through a loss of migratory culling and escape. Outlook and Future Challenges Understanding the mechanisms by which long-distance movements affect hostâpathogen systems offers exciting challenges for future work, especially in the context of global change and evolutionary dynamics. In terms of basic re- search, there remains a great need to identify conditions under which migration will increase host exposure to infectious agents versus cases where migration can reduce transmission, with the ultimate goal of predicting the net outcomes for host species where multiple mechanisms operate on the same or different pathogens (e.g., Box A1-1). To that end, mechanistic models are needed to examine how migration affects infectious disease dynamics and to explore the relevance of possible mechanisms. Such models must combine within-season processes (including host reproduction, overwintering survival, and pathogen transmission) with between-season migration (Figure A1-4). For example, to examine the importance of environmental transmission for the dynamics of LPAI in North American birds, Breban et al. (Breben et al., 2009) modeled a waterfowl population migrating between two geographically distant sites, with transmission dynamics occurring at both breeding and wintering grounds. Similarly, models describing interconnected networks of metapopulations could be useful in inves- tigating disease dynamics between habitats linked through seasonal migrations (Keeling et al., 2010). Although currently uncommon in the literature, epidemio- logical models can also be extended to capture mechanisms such as migratory culling and migratory escape and to include multiple infectious agents to explore questions of coinfection and multihost transmission dynamics (Figure A1-4). One outstanding question is whether parasites can increase the migratory propensity of their hosts by favoring the evolution of migratory behaviors. Long- distance migration has previously been hypothesized to reduce predation risks for ungulates and birds, with the general rationale being that the survival costs of mi- gration should be outweighed by fitness benefits associated with reproduction. In support of this idea, field studies of wolf predation on North American elk at their summer breeding grounds (Hebblewhite and Merrill, 2007) and nest predation on migrating songbirds (McKinnon et al., 2010) showed that animals traveling farthest experienced the lowest predation risk. Similar observational studies could ask how the prevalence, intensity, virulence, and diversity of key parasites change with migratory distances traveled. To that end, comparing infection dynamics between migratory and nonmigratory populations of the same species offers a powerful test of both pattern and process (e.g., Box A1-1), although research- ers will need to keep in mind that climate differences (e.g., milder climates for habitats used by nonmigratory populations) could confound some comparisons.\n\nAPPENDIX A 125 FIGURE A1-4âA compartmental model illustrating infectious disease dynamics (S-I model) in a migratory host population moving between geographically distinct breeding and overwintering habitats. Susceptible hosts (S) in the breeding grounds are born (v), die (Î¼b) because of background mortality, and become infected at a rate, Î². Infected hosts (I) suffer disease-induced mortality (Î±b). Different fractions of susceptible (xb) and in- fected hosts (yb) survive migration from the breeding habitat and arrive successfully at an overwintering habitat at some rate (Î´b). Here, natural (Î¼w) and disease-induced mortality (Î±w) are both influenced by a different set of environmental conditions that characterize wintering grounds. The fraction of hosts surviving the spring migration the following year (xwÎ´w, ywÎ´w) will return to the breeding grounds to reproduce. A simple model like this can be readily modified to accommodate different parasite species and their transmission modes, host recovery, host age structure, and cross-species transmission. Modeling approaches are also needed to explore how seasonal migration might respond evolutionarily to parasite-driven pressures, similar to other studies that examined effects of within-site competition, costs of dispersal, and variation in habitat quality on random dispersal strategies (McPeek and Holt, 1992). Another question related to host evolution is whether the combined demands of migration and disease risk could select for greater or lower investment in resistance or immunity. Field and laboratory studies have already documented between-season changes in immune investment, suggesting that some migratory species suppress specific immune responses before or during migration (Owen\n\n126 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS and Moore, 2006). The reduction in investment in immune defense could be an adaptive response to lower risks from certain parasites in migratory species (beyond issues related to energetic trade-offs) and might affect adaptive im- munity (shown to be costly for many vertebrate species) more strongly than in- nate defenses. Over longer time scales, long-distance migration could select for greater levels of innate immunity in migratory species or populations, especially if migrating animals encounter more diverse parasite assemblages (MÃ¸ller and ErritzÃ¸e, 1998). With this in mind, comparisons of adaptive and innate immune defense and resistance to specific pathogens between migratory and nonmigra- tory populations represent a challenge for future work that could be especially tractable with invertebrate systems (Altizer, 2001). Pathogens might also respond to migration-mediated selection, with ecologi- cal pressures arising from migration leading to divergence in virulence. There is some evidence to show that less-virulent strains circulate in migratory popula- tions than in resident populations. The negative correlation between virulence and host migration distance, illustrated in the monarch system (Box A1-1), highlights the troubling possibility that pathogens infecting other migratory species could become more virulent if migrations decline. Moreover, dwindling migrations might affect host life history by altering pathogen virulence in once-migratory hosts. For example, a theoretical study showed that even moderate increases in virulence can change host breeding phenology to stimulate hosts to develop more quickly and breed earlier before they have a chance to become heavily infected (Restif et al., 2004). The recent facial tumor disease devastating Tasmanian devil populations provides a striking empirical example of high disease-induced mor- tality shifting host reproductive strategy from an iteroparous to a semelparous pattern through precocious sexual maturity in young devils (Jones et al., 2008). Although the hosts in this example are nonmigratory, they illustrate how virulent pathogens can generate longer-term fecundity costs beyond their direct impacts on host survival. Studying the migratory process in any wildlife species poses exceptional logistical challenges, in part because distances separating multiple habitats can sometimes span thousands of kilometers, making sampling for infection or im- munity intractable for field researchers. One problem is that historically, large numbers of animals have been sampled and marked at migratory staging areas, but for many species their subsequent whereabouts remain unknown (Webster et al., 2002). Tracking animals over long time periods and across vast distances has become more feasible with technological innovations such as radar and satel- lite telemetry for larger animals and ultra-light geolocators, stable isotopes, and radio tags to record or infer the movements of smaller animals (Robinson et al., 2010). Furthermore, physiological measurements such as heart rate, wing beat frequency, and blood metabolites can be obtained remotely for some species, enabling scientists to examine how infection status influences movement rates and the energetic costs of migration (Robinson et al., 2010).\n\nAPPENDIX A 127 Interdisciplinary studies to connect the fields of migration biology and in- fectious disease ecology are still in the early stages, and there are many excit- ing research opportunities to examine how infection dynamics relate to animal physiology, evolution, behavior, and environmental variation across the annual migratory cycle. Most evidence comes from studies of avian-pathogen systems, especially viruses. Although this is not surprising given the relevance of patho- gens such as avian influenza and WNV to human health, there remains a great need to explore other systems. Good places to start would be to make connections between disease and migration for species such as sea turtles, wildebeest, bats, dragonflies, and whales (Figure A1-2). Parasite infections and movement ecology in species in each of these groups have been well studied separately but not yet bridged. Taking a broad view of diverse host life histories and parasite trans- mission modes will allow future studies to identify ecological generalities and system-specific complexities that govern the mechanistic relationships between host movement behavior and infectious disease dynamics.

A2 CLIMATE CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: FROM EVIDENCE TO A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK3 Sonia Altizer,4 Richard S. Ostfeld,5 Pieter T. J. Johnson,6 Susan Kutz,7 and C. Drew Harvell8 Abstract Scientists have long predicted large-scale responses of infectious diseases to climate change, giving rise to a polarizing debate, especially concerning human pathogens for which socioeconomic drivers and control measures can limit the detection of climate-mediated changes. Climate change has already increased the occurrence of diseases in some natural and agricul- tural systems, but in many cases, outcomes depend on the form of climate change and details of the hostâpathogen system. In this review, we highlight research progress and gaps that have emerged during the past decade and develop a predictive framework that integrates knowledge from ecophysiol- ogy and community ecology with modeling approaches. Future work must continue to anticipate and monitor pathogen biodiversity and disease trends in natural ecosystems and identify opportunities to mitigate the impacts of climate-driven disease emergence. 3ââOriginally printed as Altizer et al. 2013.

Over the past decade, climate warming has already caused profound and often complex changes in the prevalence or severity of some infectious diseases (Figure A2-1) (Baker-Austin et al., 2013; Burge et al., 2014; Garrett et al., 2013; FIGURE A2-1â Animalâparasite interactions for which field or experimental studies have linked climate change to altered disease risk. (A) Black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, vectors of Lyme disease, attached to the ears of a white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leuco- pus, show greater synchrony in larval and nymphal feeding in response to milder climates, leading to more rapid Lyme transmission. (B) Caribbean coral (Diploria labyrinthiformis) was affected by loss of symbionts, white plague disease, and ciliate infection during the 2010 warm thermal anomaly in CuraÃ§ao. (C) Malformed leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) as a result of infection by the cercarial stage (inset) of the multihost trematode R. ondatrae; warming causes nonlinear changes in both host and parasite that lead to marked shifts in the timing of interactions. (D) Infection of monarchs (D. plexippus) by the protozoan O. elektroscirrha (inset) increases in parts of the United States where monarchs breed year-round as a result of the establishment of exotic milkweed species and milder winter climates. (E) Infection risk with O. gruehneri (inset shows eggs and larvae) the common abomasal nematode of caribou and reindeer (R. tarandus), may be reduced during the hottest part of the Arctic summer as a result of warming, which leads to two annual trans- mission peaks rather than one (e.g., Figure A2-3C).

For human diseases, vector-control, antimicrobial treat- ments, and infrastructural changes can dampen or mask climate effects. Wild- life and plant diseases are generally less influenced by these control measures, making the climate signal easier to detect (Harvell et al., 2009). For example, although the effects of climate warming on the dynamics of human malaria are debated, climate warming is consistently shown to increase the intensity and/or latitudinal and altitudinal range of avian malaria in wild birds (Garamszegi, 2011; Zamora-Vilchis et al., 2012). Predicting the consequences of climate change for infectious disease severity and distributions remains a persistent challenge surrounded by much controversy, particularly for vector-borne infections of humans [boxes S1 and S2 (available as supplementary materials on Science Online)]. Work using climate-based envelope models has predicted that modest climate-induced range expansions of human malaria in some areas will be offset by range contractions in other locations (Rogers and Randolph, 2000). An alternative approach, based on mechanistic models of physiological and demographic processes of vectors and pathogens (Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2012), predicts large geographic range expansions of hu- man malaria into higher latitudes (Martens et al., 1995). Both approaches have their limitations (Garrett et al., 2013), and the challenge remains to accurately capture the contributions of multiple, interacting, and often nonlinear underly- ing responses of host, pathogen, and vector to climate. This challenge is further exacerbated by variation in the climate responses among hostâpathogen systems arising from different life history characteristics and thermal niches (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2013). A decade ago, Harvell et al. (2002) reviewed the potential for infectious diseases to increase with climate warming. Since then, the frequency of studies examining climateâdisease interactions has continued to increase (Figure A2-2), producing clear evidence that changes in mean temperature or climate vari- ability can alter disease risk. Some of the best examples of climate responses of infectious diseases to date are from ectothermic hosts and from parasites with environmental transmission stages that can persist outside the host (Figure A2-1). Indeed, first principles suggest that the rates of replication, development, and transmission of these pathogens should depend more strongly on temperature relative to other hostâpathogen interactions. The next challenges require integrat- ing theoretical, observational, and experimental approaches to better predict the direction and magnitude of changes in disease risk. Identifying the contribution of other environmental variables, such as precipitation, humidity, and climate variability remains a challenge (Paijmans et al., 2009; Raffel et al., 2013). Here, we review the individual, community, and landscape-level mechanisms behind climate-induced changes in infectious disease risk and illustrate how a quantitative, ecophysiological framework can predict the response of different hostâpathogen relations to climate warming. We mainly focus on changes in temperature, which have been more thoroughly explored both empirically and\n\n132 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS FIGURE A2-2â Rising interest in climateâdisease interactions. Research focused on asso- ciations between infectious disease and climate change has increased steadily over the past 20 years. After correcting for total research interest in climate change (open symbols) or infectious disease (closed symbols), the frequency of papers referencing a climateâdisease link in the title has nearly doubled over this period, based on long-term publication trends following a Web of Science search of article titles (1990 to 2012). Search criteria and statistical analyses are provided in the supplementary materials, and the total number of climate changeâinfectious disease papers identified by our search criteria ranged from 5 to 117 publications per year. theoretically, relative to other environmental variables. We consider impacts of climate change on human diseases and on pathogens affecting species of con- servation or economic concern, including agroecosystems [box S3 (available as supplementary materials on Science Online)]. A crucial need remains for long- term ecological studies that examine the consequences of climate-disease inter- actions for entire communities and ecosystems, as well as for efforts that couple effective disease forecasting models with mitigation and solutions. Ecophysiology of HostâPathogen Interactions More than a century of research has firmly established that temperature and other climatic variables strongly affect the physiology and demography of free- living and parasitic species [e.g., (Walther et al., 2002)], with effects on behavior, development, fecundity, and mortality (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). Because these\n\nAPPENDIX A 133 effects can be nonlinear and sometimes conflicting, such as warmer temperatures accelerating invertebrate development but reducing life span, a central challenge has been to identify the net outcomes for fitness (Harvell et al., 2002). For infec- tious diseases, this challenge is compounded by the interactions between at least two speciesâa host and a pathogenâand often vectors or intermediate hosts, which make the cumulative influence of climate on disease outcomes elusive [e.g., (Lafferty, 2009; Rohr et al., 2011)]. Immune defenses are physiological processes crucial for predicting changes in disease dynamics. Warmer temperatures can increase immune enzyme ac- tivity and bacterial resistance for insects, such as the cricket Gryllus texensis (Adamo and Lovett, 2011). Positive effects of temperature on parasite growth and replication, however, might outweigh greater immune function of the host. In gorgonian corals, for example, warmer temperatures increase cellular and hu- moral defenses (Mydlarz et al., 2006), but because coral pathogens also replicate faster under these conditions, disease outbreaks have coincided with warmer sea temperatures in the Caribbean (Figure A2-1) (Burge et al., 2014; Harvell et al., 2009). Warm temperatures also can lower host immunity; for example, melanization and phagocytic cell activity in mosquitoes are depressed at higher temperatures (Murdock et al., 2012). In addition, increased climate variability can interfere with host immunity, as illustrated by decreased frog resistance to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in response to temperature fluctuations (Raffel et al., 2013). Even though Bd grows best in culture at cooler temperatures, which suggests that warming should reduce disease, incorporating variability-induced changes in host resistance suggests a more complex relation between climate change and Bd-induced amphibian declines (Rohr and Raffel, 2010). These issues are important for predicting the immunological efficiency of ectotherms outside of their typical climate envelope. One promising approach for predicting how hostâpathogen interactions re- spond to climate warming involves infusing epidemiological models with re- lations derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). This approach circumvents the need for detailed species-specific development and survival parameters by using established relations between metabolism, ambient tempera- ture, and body size to predict responses to climate warming (Brown et al., 2004). One breakthrough study (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2013) used MTE coupled with traditional hostâparasite transmission models to examine how changes in seasonal and annual temperature affected the basic reproduction number (R0) of strongylid nematodes with direct life cycles and transmission stages that are shed into the environment. By casting R0 in terms of temperature-induced trade-offs between parasite development and mortality, this approach facilitated both general predic- tions about how infection patterns change with warming and, when parameterized for Ostertagia gruehneri, a nematode of caribou and reindeer (Figure A2-1), specific projections that corresponded with the observed temperature dependence of parasite stages. Moreover, this model predicted a shift from one to two peaks\n\n134 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS in nematode transmission each year under warming conditions (Figure A2-3C), a result consistent with field observations (Hoar et al., 2012; MolnÃ¡r et al., 2013). In some cases, ecophysiological approaches must consider multiple host species and parasite developmental stages that could show differential sensitivity to warming. Such differential responses can complicate prediction of net effects, especially for ectothermic hosts with more pronounced responses to tempera- ture. For instance, because both infectivity of a trematode parasite (Ribeiroia ondatrae) and defenses of an amphibian host (Pseudacris regilla) increase with FIGURE A2-3âTheoretical underpinnings and categorization of disease responses to climate change.\n\nAPPENDIX A 135 temperature; maximal pathology (limb malformations) (Figure A2-1) occurs at intermediate temperatures (Paull et al., 2012). Other work showed that the virulence of both a coral fungus (Aspergillus sydowii) and protozoan (Aplanochy- trium sp.) increased with temperature, probably because pathogen development rate continued to increase in a temperature range where coral defenses were less potent (Burge et al., 2013). Thus, the ideal approach will be an iterative one that combines metabolic and epidemiological modeling to predict general responses and to identify knowledge gaps, followed by application of models to specific hostâpathogen interactions. Pathogen responses to climate change depend on thermal tolerance relative to current and projected conditions across an annual cycle. (A) Gaussian curves relating temperature to a metric of disease risk suggest symmetrical temperature zones over which warming will increase and decrease transmission, whereas left-skewing [a common response for many terrestrial ectotherms, including arthropod vectors (Deutsch et al., 2008)] indicates greater potential for pathogen transmission to increase with warming [box S2 (available as supplementary materials on Science Online)]. Bold arrows represent geographic gradients that span cool, warm, and hot mean temperatures, which indicate that the net effect of warming (at point of arrows) depends on whether temperatures grow to ex- ceed the optimum temperature (Topt) for disease transmission. Projected changes in disease will further depend on the starting temperature relative to Topt, the magnitude of warming, measurement error, adaptation, and acclimation. (B) Pathogens at their northern or altitudinal limits might show range expansion and nonlinear shifts in their life cycle in response to warmer temperatures (red) rela- tive to baseline (blue). For example, a shift from 2- to 1-year cycles of transmis- sion has occurred for the muskox lungworm (Kutz et al., 2009). This outcome could generate sporadic disease emergence in a naÃ¯ve population (if extremes in temperature allow only occasional invasion and/or establishment), or could gradually increase prevalence and establishment. (C) At the low-latitude or low- altitude extent of a pathogenâs range, where temperature increases could exceed the pathogenâs thermal optimum, transmission might be reduced, or we might see the emergence of a bimodal pattern whereby R0 peaks both early and late in the season, but decreases during the midsummer [as in the case of the arctic O. gruehneriâreindeer example (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2013)]. In (B) and (C), the lower blue line represents R0 = 1, above which the pathogen can increase; values above the pink line represent severe disease problems owing to a higher peak of R0 and a greater duration of time during which R0 > 1. Community Ecology, Biodiversity, and Climate Change Hostâpathogen interactions are embedded in diverse communities, with cli- mate change likely leading to the loss of some hostâpathogen interactions and the gain of novel species pairings. In some cases, pathogen extinction and the loss of\n\n136 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS endemic parasites could follow from climate change, potentially reducing disease or conversely releasing more pathogenic organisms from competition. In other cases, multiple pathogens can put entire host communities at risk of extinction. Although ecosystems of low biodiversity, such as occur in polar regions, can be particularly sensitive to emerging parasitic diseases (Kutz et al., 2009), most knowledge of community-wide responses stems from tropical marine systems. For example, the wider Caribbean region is a âdisease hot spotâ characterized by the rapid, warming-induced emergence of multiple new pathogens that have caused precipitous coral declines with ecosystem-wide repercussions (Rogers and Muller, 2012; Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2012). Impacts of climate-induced changes in disease can be especially large when the host is a dominant or keystone species. For example, near extinction of the once-dominant, herbivorous abalone (genus Haliotis) by warming-driven rickettsial disease caused pervasive community shifts across multiple trophic levels (Burge et al., 2014). Similarly, seagrass (Zostera marina) declines caused by infection with the protist Labyrinthula zos- terae, which correlates positively with warming, have degraded nursery habitats for fish and migratory waterfowl and caused the extinction of the eelgrass limpet (Hughes et al., 2002). Microbial communities, which are often part of the extended phenotype of host defenses, are also likely to respond to climate changes. For instance, warm- ing sea-surface temperatures in coral reefs can inhibit the growth of antibiotic- producing bacteria, sometimes causing microbial communities to shift from mutualistic to pathogenic (Ritchie, 2006). In agroecosystems, higher tempera- tures can suppress entomopathogenic fungi and antibiotic production by bacte- rial mutualists in plants (Humair et al., 2009). Warming also underlies bacterial shifts from endosymbiotic to lytic within host amoebas that live in human nasal passages, increasing the potential risk of respiratory disease (Corsaro and Greub, 2006). Thus, effects of warmer temperatures on the diversity and function of commensal or mutualist microbes could promote pathogen growth and pest outbreaks. From a broader perspective, biodiversity loss is a well-established con- sequence of climate change (Jetz et al., 2007; Parmesan and Yohe, 2003) and can have its own impact on infectious diseases. For many diseases of humans, wildlife, and plants, biodiversity loss at local or regional scales can increase rates of pathogen transmission (Cardinale et al., 2012; Johnson and Hoverman, 2012; Keesing et al., 2010). This pattern can result from several mechanisms, includ- ing the loss of the dilution effect (Johnson and Hoverman, 2012). For example, lower parasite diversity could allow more pathogenic species to proliferate when endemic and competing parasites are lost from a system (Johnson and Hoverman, 2012). Climate warming can also weaken biotic regulation of disease vectors by inhibiting their predators (Hobbelen et al., 2013) and competitors (Farjana et al., 2012). Interactions between biodiversity and infectious disease underscore the need to put climateâdisease interactions into the broader context of other forms\n\nAPPENDIX A 137 of global change, such as land-use change and habitat loss, when extending pre- dictions from focused hostâpathogen interactions to larger spatial and taxonomic scales. Shifts in Behavior, Movement, and Phenology of Hosts and Parasites Changes in climate are already affecting the phenology of interactions be- tween plants and pollinators, predators and prey, and plants and herbivores (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). Climate-induced shifts in phenology and species movements (Chen et al., 2011) will likely affect disease dynamics. Many species are already moving toward higher elevations or latitudes (Hickling et al., 2006), and an open question is whether these shifts could disrupt established interactions or bring novel groups of hosts and pathogens into contact (Morgan et al., 2004). For instance, the range expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) across Europe and the Americas has created the potential for novel viral diseases such as Chikungunya to invade (Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2012); this pathogen is already expanding in geographic range, and a recent outbreak in Europe empha- sizes the need for surveillance and preparedness. Along eastern North America, warming sea temperatures and changes in host resistance facilitated a northward shift of two oyster diseases into previously unexposed populations (Burge et al., 2014). Migratory species in particular can be sensitive to climate change (Hickling et al., 2006), with the routes and timing of some speciesâ migrations already shift- ing with climate warming (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). Long-distance migrations can lower parasite transmission by allowing hosts to escape pathogens that accu- mulate in the environment or by strenuous journeys that cull sick animals (Altizer et al., 2011). In some cases, milder winters can allow previously migratory host populations to persist year-round in temperate regions (Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2007); this residency fosters the build-up of environmental transmission stages, and mild winters further enhance parasite over-winter survival (Garrett et al., 2013). A case study of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and the protozoan parasite Ophyrocystis elektroscirrha (Figure A2-1) provides support for climate- warming shifts in migration and disease. Monarchs typically leave their northern breeding grounds in early fall and fly to Mexican wintering sites. Milder winters, combined with increased planting of exotic host plants, now allow monarch populations to breed year-round in parts of the United States (Howard et al., 2010). Relative to migratory monarchs, winter-breeding monarchs suffer from higher rates of infection (Altizer et al., 2011). Similarly, migration is considered an important parasite avoidance strategy for barren-ground caribou (Hoar et al., 2012), but the loss of sea ice with climate warming will likely inhibit migrations and prevent them from seasonally escaping parasites (Post et al., 2013). Thus, diminishing migration behaviors among animals that use seasonal habitats can increase the transmission of infectious diseases.\n\n138 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS Changes in the timing of vector life stages and feeding behavior can also arise from interactions between climate and photoperiod. For several tick-borne infections (Figure A2-1), pathogens are sequentially transmitted from infected vertebrate hosts to naÃ¯ve larval tick vectors, and from infected nymphal ticks to naÃ¯ve vertebrate hosts. Asynchrony in the seasonal activity of larval and nymphal ticks can delay transmission and select for less virulent strains of the Lyme bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Kurtenbach et al., 2006), whereas synchrony allows for more rapid transmission and the persistence of virulent strains. In the case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), viral transmission occurs directly between cofeeding ticks; thus, viral maintenance requires synchronous larval and nymphal feeding (Randolph et al., 1999). Because synchrony of larval and nymphal ticks characterizes milder winter climates, climate change could increase tick syn- chrony and the transmission and virulence of several tick-borne infections. Changes in the timing of shedding or development of environmental trans- mission stages could result from climate warming. Some parasites could experi- ence earlier hatching, exposure to hosts earlier in the season, and encounters with earlier (and often more sensitive) life stages of hosts. For example, a long-term data set of lake plankton showed that warming shifted fungal prevalence patterns in diatom hosts from acute epidemics to chronic persistence, in part because of faster transmission and more widespread host population suppression under warmer temperatures (Ibelings et al., 2011). In contrast, Brown and Rohani (Brown and Rohani, 2012) argued for the opposite outcome with respect to avian influenza (AI) in reservoir bird hosts. Climate-driven mismatch in the timing of bird migration and their prey resources (e.g., horseshoe crab eggs) amplified vari- ability in epidemiological outcomes: Although mismatch increased the likelihood of AI extinction, infection prevalence and spillover potential both increased in cases where the virus persisted. Plasticity in parasite traits could allow parasites with environmental trans- mission stages to respond more rapidly to climate warming. For example, arrested development (hypobiosis) of the nematode O. gruehneri within its caribou host is a plastic trait more commonly expressed in areas with harsher winters as com- pared with milder climates (Hoar et al., 2012). This arrested state prevents wasted reproductive effort for the parasites, because eggs produced in late summer in colder regions are unlikely to develop to infective-stage larvae by fall. Ultimately, plasticity in life history traits could speed parasite responses to changing envi- ronments and allow parasites to deal with climate instabilities (e.g., a series of severe winters interspersed by mild), relative to the case where selection must act on genetically variable traits (Moritz and Agudo, 2013). For example, if climate warming extends the transmission season for O. gruehneri on tundra, a rapid decrease in the frequency of nematode hypobiosis could shorten the life cycle and increase infection rates.\n\nAPPENDIX A 139 Consequences for Conservation and Human Health Climate change is already contributing to species extinctions, both directly and through interactions with infectious disease (Thomas et al., 2004). Roughly one-third of all coral species and the sustainability of coral reef ecosystems are threatened by human activities, including climate warming and infectious dis- eases (Burge et al., 2014). In contrast to tropical marine systems, the Arctic is a less diverse and minimally redundant system that is warming at least twice as fast as the global average (International Panel on Climate Change, 2007) and si- multaneously experiencing drastic landscape changes from an expanding human footprint. Altered transmission dynamics of parasites, poleward range expansion of hosts and parasites, and disease emergence coincident with climate warming or extremes have all been reported in the Arctic (Kutz et al., 2009; Laaksonen et al., 2010). Together, these phenomena are altering hostâparasite dynamics and causing endemic Arctic speciesâunable to compete or adapt rapidly enoughâto decline (Gilg et al., 2012). Changes in wildlife health can also compromise the livelihoods and health of indigenous people who depend on wildlife for food and cultural activities (Meakin and Kurvitz, 2009). In humans, exposure to diarrheal diseases has been linked to warmer tem- peratures and heavy rainfall (Pascual et al., 2002). Human infections of cholera, typically acquired through ingestion of contaminated water (in developing coun- tries) or undercooked seafood (in the developed world), affect millions of people annually with a high case-fatality rate. Coastal Vibrio infections are associated with zooplankton blooms, warmer water, and severe storms (Baker-Austin et al., 2013). For example, in the Baltic Sea, long-term warming and temperature anomalies have been linked to increased disease from Vibrio vulnificus, which was first reported in 1994 along the German coast after an unusually warm sum- mer (Baker-Austin et al., 2013). Long-term sea surface warming can increase the geographic range, concentration, and seasonal duration of Vibrio infections, as seen in coastal Chile, Israel, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Modeling ap- proaches indicate that Vibrio illnesses from the Baltic region could increase nearly twofold for every 1Â°C increase in annual maximum water temperature (Baker-Austin et al., 2013). Human mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are fre- quently proposed as cases where vector and disease expansion into the temperate zone could follow from climate warming (Mills et al., 2010). However, some researchers have argued that ranges will shift with warming, rather than expand, and that the best predictors of infection risk are economic and social factors, especially poverty (Lafferty, 2009; Randolph, 2010). Controversy has also arisen over which climatic variables are most important in delimiting the distributions of these diseases [boxes S1 and S2 (available as supplementary material on Science Online)]. Detecting impacts of climate change on human vector-borne diseases remains difficult, in part, because active mitigations, such as vector-control, an- timicrobials, and improved infrastructure, can complicate detection of a climate\n\n140 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS signal. Several unresolved issues include identifying conditions under which climate warming will cause range expansions versus contractions, understanding the impact of increasing variability in precipitation, and determining the addi- tional economic costs associated with increased disease risk caused by warming. Ultimately, the societal implications of climate-driven shifts in diseases of humans, crops, and natural systems will demand solutions and mitigation, including early-warning programs. Recently, a forecasting system linking global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models to malaria risk in Botswana allowed anomalously high risk to be predicted and anticipatory mitigations to be initiated (Thomson et al., 2006). Forecasting is well established in crop disease manage- ment and leads to improved timing of pesticide application and deployment of planting strategies to lower disease risk [box S3 (available as supplementary material on Science Online)]. Modeling efforts to better predict crop loss events are also tied to improved insurance returns against losses (Garrett et al., 2013). Similarly, accurate forecasting programs for coral bleaching have become a main- stay of marine climate resilience programs (Eakin et al., 2010) and are leading to the development of coral disease forecasting algorithms (Maynard et al., 2011). Appropriate management actions under outbreak conditions include reef closures to reduce stress and transmission, culling of diseased parts of some colonies, and increased surveillance (Beeden et al., 2012). In the ocean, efforts are also under way to increase the resilience of marine ecosystems to disease, including devel- oping no-fishing zones and reducing land-based pollution that can introduce new pathogens (Burge et al., 2014). Outlook and Future Challenges Climate change will continue to limit the transmission of some pathogens and create opportunities for others. To improve predictions and responses we need to deepen our understanding of mechanistic factors. Although the initial climatic drivers to be explored should be temperature variables (both mean and variability), because the data are available and we understand the mechanisms at work, future work must concurrently explore the effects of precipitation, relative humidity, and extreme events. In particular, models are needed that combine the principles of ecophysiology and MTE (Brown et al., 2004) with epidemiologi- cal response variables, such as R0 or outbreak size, and that are designed to ac- commodate distinct pathogen types (e.g., vector-borne, directly transmitted, or complex life cycle) and host types (ectotherm versus endotherm) (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2013). These models should be applied, by using climate-change projections, to evaluate how broad classes of pathogens might respond to climate change. Building from this foundation, the next step is to extend such general models to specific pathogens of concern for human health, food supply, or wildlife conser- vation, which will require empirical parameterization, with attention to the on- the-ground conditions. Modeling efforts should be integrated with experiments to\n\nAPPENDIX A 141 test model predictions under realistic conditions, and with retrospective studies to detect the âfingerprintâ of climate-induced changes in infection. Scientists still know relatively little about the conditions under which evolu- tion will shape host and pathogen responses to climate change. Although evo- lutionary change in response to climate warming has been reported for some free-living animals and plants, the evidence remains limited (Moritz and Agudo, 2013). Even less is known about how climate change will drive hostâpathogen evolution. Corals have multiple levels of adaptation to intense selection by ther- mal stress that could also affect resistance to pathogens, including symbiont shuf- fling of both algae and bacteria, and natural selection against thermally intolerant individuals (Howells et al., 2011). In oysters (Crassostrea virginica), warming might have contributed to increased resistance to the protozoan multinucleated sphere X (MSX) disease (Ford and Bushek, 2012), but climate variability might also slow the evolution of oyster resistance (Powell et al., 2012). In cases where increased rates of transmission follow from warming, selection could favor higher pathogen virulence, although examples are now unknown. A persistent challenge involves the ability to detect changes in disease risk with climate across different systems. In the oceans, for example, impacts of disease on sessile hosts like corals, abalones, and oysters are readily apparent, and for terrestrial systems, clear impacts are seen for plant diseases and some wildlife-helminth interactions. But for highly mobile species and many human diseases, detecting signals of climate change remains problematic. For these less tractable systems, long-term ecological studies that examine the past distribu- tions of pathogens, important hosts, and severity of diseases are indispensable. Permanent repositories of intact physical specimens, as well as their DNA, can provide records of diversity that will be critical resources as new methodologies become available (Fernandez-Triana et al., 2011; Hoberg, 2010). Moreover, new technologies can detect variability in physiological processes and gene expression and can improve climate projections from global circulation models. Sophisti- cated experimental designs conducted under appropriate ranges of environmental conditions and retrospective studies to identify past climatic effects on disease (Burge et al., 2014; Hoverman et al., 2013) will help advance predictive power. An additional key challenge is predicting the impacts of climateâdisease interactions for human societies and gauging how these compare with other components of climate change, such as the loss of arable land. By affecting food yields and nutrition, water quality and quantity, social disorder, population displacement, and conflict, past climate changes have long influenced the burden of infectious disease in many human societies (McMichael, 2012; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013). Predicting the regions where humans and natural systems are most vulnerable to pressures from infectious disease and how these pressures will translate to changes in global health and security constitute critical research pri- orities (Myers and Patz, 2009). Building a mechanistic understanding of climateâ disease interactions will allow public health interventions to be proactive and will\n\n142 GLOBAL CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS facilitate effective responses to new or expanding health threats. Surveillance programs capable of detecting pathogen or disease emergence are essential and, in many instances, predicting and detecting local-scale impacts might be more important than predicting global-scale changes. To this end, the value of engag- ing local communities in disease surveillance is increasingly recognized, with the goal of advancing science on climateâdisease linkages for practical solutions to protecting human and wildlife health.

A3 MIGRATION, CIVIL CONFLICT, MASS GATHERING EVENTS, AND DISEASE Chris Beyrer9,10 and James Wren Tracy9 Introduction Human agency can drive infectious disease establishment, adaptation, and spread, which can subsequently have profound impacts on the health of individu- als, communities, and populations. Civil conflicts and the complex humanitarian emergencies they generate are widespread, common, and may increase in con- text of current global environmental change (Hsiang et al., 2013). Conflict, civil disruption, and the implicit migration that comes with both can compromise our ability to understand, track, respond, and mitigate infectious disease threats mak- ing their impact on human health even more difficult to address. With increased migration and mobility of peoples, a concurrent increase in exposure to multiple infectious diseases can occur. Populations mixing from the movement of individuals, groups, and sometimes whole communities can allow for a greater mixing of infectious diseases and heightened vulnerability to those diseases. Work by our group in Eastern Burma documented much higher rates of childhood and adult malaria, water-borne diarrheal diseases, childhood malnutri- tion, "
