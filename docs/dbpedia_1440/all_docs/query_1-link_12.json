        "text": "AAG Honors\n\nDeadline: September 30, 2024\n\nAAG Honors are offered annually to recognize outstanding accomplishments by members in research and scholarship, teaching, education, service to the discipline, public service outside academe and for lifetime achievement. As a scholarly association committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, we strongly encourage nominations from and of people underrepresented in the discipline of geography, including women and persons who are trans/non-binary and/or underrepresented minority groups. AAG Honors have been awarded since 1951 (see below for complete list).\n\nCategories of AAG Honors\n\nWe invite nominations reflecting the breadth of the discipline from individual AAG members, specialty groups, affinity groups, departments from all types of institutions, and other interested parties. Please scroll down on this page to the bullets providing more detail on the broad and inclusive criteria we encourage nominators to consider for AAG Honors. Currently, honors are awarded in several categories, including:\n\nThis category of AAG Honors recognizes exceptional Geography teachers who have demonstrated a sustained track record of innovative, creative, and effective ways to convey geographical concepts and topics to their students (at any degree level). It may also recognize candidates who have developed new curricula, certifications, or degree-paths. Candidate impact is measured in the sustained quality of their courses over time, whether their students continue pursuing the discipline (majors, alumni career paths, etc.), and teaching and mentoring style.\n\nThis category of AAG Honors celebrates geographers who have promoted the discipline in the public, private, or non-profit sectors either through their own work or impactful collaborations with others. Examples of such success may include developing pioneering applications to support more transparent and effective governance, promoting the use of geographical concepts and applications in addressing key societal and/or natural challenges.\n\nThis category of AAG Honors celebrates service to the Association and the community of AAG members. Examples of such service include but are not limited to: the launch of a successful new AAG Specialty Group to fill a significant gap in the Association’s sub-disciplinary offerings, improving the AAG’s profile and increasing its visibility, contributing significantly to special AAG initiatives or member-focused efforts, and/or sustaining a career-long arc of service and leadership on AAG committees, task forces, Specialty/Affinity Groups, and in AAG governance.\n\nThis AAG Honors category recognizes geographers who have significantly advanced geographic education. Examples include preservice training, professional development, and/or related support for educators. Candidates may be recognized for having developed state/local/national academic standards, serving as editors on key geography education journals, or for supporting development of geography teacher resources and peer-reviewed research. Successful candidates demonstrate a positive influence on contemporary geographic education.\n\nThis AAG Honors category celebrates a career-long, distinguished track record of high-quality research in geography which has moved the discipline forward. Candidates may be recognized for transformative scholarship in any sub-discipline of geography, an extensive and impressive record of funding from foundations or government agencies, and/or setting standards of exemplary behavior in scholarly practice. A significant and impactful publication record is also an important factor for recognition under this category of AAG Honors.\n\nThis AAG Honors category celebrates those geographers who have had a unique and path-breaking impact on the discipline through a combination of research and public engagement, perhaps as leaders in academia or other sectors where they have championed the discipline, in their publication record, and in their service to the discipline. Recipients of the AAG Lifetime Achievement Honors demonstrate excellence across the range of honor categories and in the significance of their contributions.\n\nThe AAG Media Achievement Award and the AAG Publication Award are also selected by the AAG Honors Committee.\n\nCitations for awardees providing an overview of the scope of the awards are published in the website Resource Hub and in the AAG Newsletter.\n\nBrowse Awardee Citations\n\nNomination Guidelines\n\nNomination dossiers must have at least 3 and not more than 5 letters of support documenting the nominee’s contributions to and impact on geography in the specific Honors category for which they are being nominated, and must also include the candidate’s CV. Efforts to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the discipline need to be addressed in the nomination letters. Self-nominations are allowed, but must include the required letters of support.\n\nNomination dossiers should be submitted by the deadline by completing the online application form. Please gather all required supporting documents before completing the online application. The Application Form will require you to upload all supporting documents before being able to complete your submission. You cannot save a partially completed form and return to it later, so it is important to have all materials ready before accessing the online Application Form. For questions, please reach out to grantsawards@aag.org.\n\nThe nominations are reviewed by the AAG Honors Committee, comprised of at least two members who have previously received AAG Honors. A final slate of nominees is presented to the AAG Council at its annual Fall meeting. The names put forward to the Council are accompanied by an award citation indicating the contribution which forms the basis of the proposed award. The final decision for awarding AAG Honors rests with the Council.\n\nNominations for these awards are solicited in late spring and announcements are published in the AAG Newsletter and on the AAG’s social media platforms, along with electronic distribution to specialty and affinity groups, department chairs, all AAG members, and other interested parties.\n\nIn addition, AAG Councilors and members of the AAG Honors Committee may also share the call for nominations and encourage submissions to the AAG Honors program. AAG Honors Committee members are not allowed to submit nominations for AAG Honors and must recuse themselves from deliberations on a candidate they may have close and active professional or personal ties to (some examples: departmental colleague; research, fieldwork or grants collaborator; mentor/mentee; supervisor or supervisee; spouse or domestic partner, etc.).\n\nIn making a nomination, please be aware that under current guidelines:\n\nNo more than eight individuals may be awarded AAG Honors in a single year. However, depending on the pool of nominees, fewer than eight awards are sometimes made.\n\nNormally only one award is made annually in each category, although more than one is permitted. However, there is no requirement to make an award in every category if there are insufficient nominations.\n\nNominees must be AAG members if they are residents of the United States; if they reside elsewhere, the membership requirement is waived. In some cases, professionals from other disciplines or professions are eligible for consideration.\n\nNominations of a group of individuals for an AAG Honors are allowed if the achievements of the group clearly demonstrate outstanding accomplishments in one of the following areas: research & scholarship, teaching, education, service to the discipline, public service outside academe. All individuals in the group being nominated must be eligible under these eligibility criteria. Groups of individuals are not eligible for the AAG Lifetime Achievement Honors.\n\nPrevious AAG honorees (see list below) may be nominated for a second AAG honor in the same category but, if nominated again, the nomination must be for distinction achieved since their first award.\n\nThe contributions of some nominees may span two or more of the award categories. In this situation, nominators may suggest more than one category for the award. The final decision of award category rests, however, with the AAG Council.\n\nNo more than one AAG Honors can be awarded posthumously in any given year in any Honors category, while still not exceeding the total maximum of eight Honors per year.\n\nNomination dossiers will be automatically carried forward for two years after the initial nomination, unless the nominee or the nominator withdraws the nominee from consideration, or unless the nomination is judged not to meet the minimum requirements for AAG Honors.\n\nThe AAG strongly encourages nominators and the Honors Committee to consider broad and inclusive criteria for AAG Honors nominations and selections. Such criteria can include (but are not limited to): race, age, religion, creed, color, ancestry, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, disability, military or veteran status, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, but also institutional diversity (i.e., teaching institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, tribal institutions, research institutions, Associates’ degree-granting programs, private or public sector organizations, non-profit organizations, etc.).\n\nAs with all other AAG awards, eligibility also rests on the nominee being in compliance with the AAG Professional Conduct Policy. Nominations may be revoked, and the AAG Honor may also be revoked for any candidate or AAG Honoree who is found in violation of the AAG’s Professional Conduct Policy.\n\nHonors Committee\n\nThe AAG Honors Committee is elected by the AAG Membership. The committee for the 2024 AAG Honors is comprised of: Megan Ybarra, University of Washington (chair); Kavita Pandit, Georgia State University (member – honoree); Alexandra Ponette-Gonzalez, University of North Texas (member); Carol Harden, University of Tennessee (ret.) (member – honoree); Godwin Arku, Western University Ontario (member); Kate Derickson, University of Minnesota (member); LaToya Eaves, University of Tennesee (observer – honoree); Kara E.

Funded by Gamma Theta Upsilon (GTU), the International Geographical Honor Society, and managed by the AAG, the VGSP sponsors visits by prominent geographers to colleges and universities across the country. Its purpose is to stimulate interest in geography, especially in small departments that do not have the resources to bring in well-known speakers. Participating institutions select and make arrangements with the visiting geographer. The VGSP covers travel costs and provides a small honorarium; host institutions provide meals and housing.\n\nThe Program is Targeted for\n\nStudents – to acquaint them with subfields that may not be available in course offerings at their institution, stimulate their interest in geographic research, and familiarize them with career opportunities available to geographers.\n\nFaculty members – to encourage geographers in their own subfields of geography, to enrich their knowledge of other subfields, to provide counsel on research and curriculum problems, and to inform non-geographers about current developments in the discipline.\n\nAdministrative officers – to acquaint them more fully with the nature, content and purpose of geography, assist them in understanding the unique spatial point of view that geography contributes to a liberal education, and provide counsel on the development of staff and curricula.\n\nProgram Conditions\n\nTo qualify for the program, at least one-half of the institutions hosting a visiting scientist during the academic year must have active chapters of Gamma Theta Upsilon (an active chapter is one that has reported initiates in the past two years). Institutions without a GTU chapter may host a visiting scholar only once. Thereafter, they must have a Gamma Theta Upsilon chapter to be eligible. Two-year colleges which offer a degree or a certificate program in Geography are eligible to form GTU chapters.\n\nThe VGSP requires one scientist to visit two or more institutions over a one to three-day period. A single contact at the primary sponsoring institution will coordinate the visits. This contact will work with the visiting scientist, the representatives of the other institution(s), and the VGSP Coordinator in the AAG Office. Participating institutions need to directly contact and schedule visiting scientists, but are welcome to contact the AAG for advice. Speakers for the VGSP are subject to GTU/AAG approval, unless selected from the current VGSP Speakers List.\n\nEach host institution is responsible for providing the visitor with meals and lodging. GTU will pay an honorarium of $100 per institutional visit to each visiting scientist and will reimburse the visitor up to $600 for travel costs to and from the area of the institutions visited. Visitors will receive their checks from the AAG. Additional travel costs (above the $600 allowance) must be absorbed by the institutions.\n\nPast experience has demonstrated that the most successful visits have resulted from careful planning of the visitor’s agenda without over-scheduling the visitor’s time. Institutions should plan to keep formal presentations to a minimum and provide a maximum of opportunities for informal discussions with students and faculty.\n\nAs with all other AAG programs, eligibility also rests on the person being in compliance with the AAG Professional Conduct Policy. Nominations may be rescinded, and participation in the program may also be revoked for any person who is found in violation of the AAG’s Professional Conduct Policy.\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nDownload application form and view the speakers list.\n\nOrganize prospective visit with at least one other institution (arrange tentative dates/times/venues).\n\nContact prospective speaker from VGSP speaker list, or obtain AAG/GTU approval for a speaker not on the list (in this case, submit curriculum vitae of speaker to be approved and ensure they are a GTU member), and fix dates.\n\nIf the proposed speaker is not a GTU member, please submit their CV along with a written statement to explain how they can promote geography AND GTU to a range of audiences (administrators, faculty, students, and the public). AAG/GTU will review and if accepted, the prospective speaker will be invited to become a GTU member before VGSP application is approved.\n\nPrepare a schedule of speaker activities while on campus (e.g., featured talk, meeting with student groups/related organizations; meeting with administration)\n\nWrite a cover letter to address purpose of the talk and its benefit(s) to students and the department; topic(s) speaker will address; description of the student body and department; and how the speaker will be promoted on campus/community.\n\nComplete the VGSP application form, a schedule of speaker tour, and a cover letter for submission to the AAG.\n\nPlease send your complete application to the attention of Mark Revell (1710 16th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20009-3198) or via e-mail (mrevell at aag.org).Upon approval of application, confirm all arrangements with speaker and co-sponsor(s), including meals and accommodations. Please allow two weeks from date of application for notification of acceptance.\n\nView past VGSP events\n\nShare\n\nWilliam L. Garrison Award for Best Dissertation in Computational Geography\n\nDeadline for Nominations: Applications will not be accepted in 2024.\n\nThe biennial William L. Garrison Award for Best Dissertation in Computational Geography supports innovative research into the computational aspects of geographic science. The award is intended to arouse a more general and deeper understanding of the important role that advanced computation can play in resolving the complex problems of space–time analysis that are at the core of geographic science. The award is one of the activities of the AAG Marble Fund for Geographic Science, which also includes the Marble-Boyle Undergraduate Achievement Award and the Marble Fund Award for Innovative Master’s Research in Quantitative Geography.\n\nThe Garrison award consists of a cash prize in the amount of $3,500 and a formal certificate of merit. The formal presentation of the Garrison Award will take place at the annual meeting of the AAG following the announcement of the award. If they so choose, the Trustees of the Marble Fund may elect to award one or more additional certificates of merit to non-awardee finalists whose work is, in their judgment, of exceptional merit.\n\nEligibility\n\nThere is no restriction placed upon the formal disciplinary area of the research so long as it is directly related to advanced computational approaches to the spatial-temporal problems addressed by geographic science. The award is open to candidates associated with any institution of higher education, anywhere in the world, that is authorized to award the doctorate.\n\nDissertations completed in the two-year period beginning on September 1st of 2021 and terminating on August 31st of 2023 will be eligible for nomination. In the context of this award, a dissertation is considered to be completed when the final version of the document is deposited with and has been accepted by the institution of higher education awarding the degree.\n\nCriteria\n\nProposals should demonstrate high standards of scholarship. The selection committee will observe the general purposes noted above when evaluating proposals. It should be noted that the emphasis of the Garrison Award is upon innovative computational approaches and award applications based upon the routine application of standard software packages are not encouraged. All nominations will be carefully reviewed and those determined to be within the stated goals of the competition will be invited to make a full submission for consideration.\n\nInitial Nominations\n\nDissertations to be considered for this award may be placed in nomination by either the candidate’s doctoral advisor or by a member of the Dissertation Committee.\n\nThe nomination documents must consist of:\n\nA signed letter of nomination, prepared on institutional letterhead, that clearly sets forth the reasons for nominating the dissertation. The letter must also provide an objective assessment of the candidate’s future research potential,\n\nA current and complete vita of the candidate, and\n\nAn extended abstract of the dissertation, including its full title, that addresses the selection of the research problem, the research methodology adopted (explicitly addressing the nature of the computational approach employed), and the anticipated contribution of the research results.

Garrison\n\nThis award was created to honor the outstanding research and educational activities of Dr. William L. Garrison who, following service in World War II, received his Ph.D. in Geography from Northwestern University in 1950. While a young faculty member at the University of Washington, Garrison became one of the leaders of the resurgence of geographic science and many of his doctoral students (including Duane Marble, Brian J. L. Berry, John Nystuen, Arthur Getis, Richard Morrill, and William Bunge) were subsequently instrumental in the evolution of geographic science and geographic information systems. Bill Garrison was also one of the first geographers to make use of computational approaches to the solution of geographic problems. The early work at the University of Washington of Garrison and his students involved such historic computing systems as the IBM 604 and IBM 650. Garrison is currently Professor Emeritus of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Emeritus Research Engineer in the Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nTrustees of the Marble Fund for Geographic Science\n\nDr. Jay Sandhu, ESRI\n\nDr. Donna Peuquet, Pennsylvania State University\n\nDr. Elizabeth Wentz, Arizona State University\n\nAAG William L.

Her creativity and her commitment to public scholarship are remarkable. Among her many noteworthy projects are the National Toxic Land/Labor Conservation Service, a faux government agency that enlists artists-activists to propose projects focused on the environmental legacies of American militarism to actual government agencies. In addition, her A People’s Atlas of Nuclear Colorado invites the public to learn about, and to engage with, the history of the Cold War and nuclear landscapes in Colorado. This interactive digital atlas, which tackles Colorado’s nuclear military-industrial complex, represents stunningly innovative, interdisciplinary, collaborative and public facing scholarship that stretches the political and social scope of what it is that an atlas can do. In receiving this award, Dr. Krupar wishes to acknowledge her long-term collaborator on these projects, Sarah Kanouse. She is affiliated with Georgetown University.\n\n2023 AAG Glenda Laws Award\n\nShiloh Krupar\n\n2023 AAG Glenda Laws Award\n\nShiloh Krupar’s work combines scholarship on nuclear politics and policy with performance-based community activism.

She requires students to write, provides detailed feedback, and promotes constructive peer review between students.\n\nHamerlinck incorporates participatory approaches to teach culturally diverse topics. Examples of her creativity include low technology ‘nanobugs’ as an example ‘game’ on how diseases spread; and social media ‘campaigns’ for effective educational programs. She created multiple new courses, including a required UF Quest course “The Next Pandemic” which she was teaching when COVID hit. Gaby also developed Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) for Geography. This CURE platform increases undergraduate research in the geography department and serves as a pedagogical tool shown to increase learning gains and retention for all students, especially those who have been historically excluded from higher education.\n\nHamerlinck is also a highly trained PhD in mathematical biology and offers her students a fresh perspective on those tools in geography. In each semester she teaches, more students find geography, and many pursue the discipline as a major.

Marcus. Grants from the Mel Marcus Fund for Physical Geography will foster personally formative participation by students collaborating with faculty in field-based physical geography research in challenging outdoor environments.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMarcus Fund grants of up to $2,000 will be awarded to faculty applicants to support travel and logistical costs of including students in field research in physical geography. Student submissions will only be accepted if the faculty member writes an accompanying letter stating how she or he will work with the student in the field. The faculty member must join the student for a significant portion of the field work. In general, the award is intended to support the inclusion of one or more students in field-based research, but not an entire class. Research sites may include international as well as national locations. Marcus grant funds may be used to cover travel to the research site, as well as expenses related to the logistical support of the student, such as food, fuel and lodging. Student stipends are not eligible expenses under this grant. University or department overhead charges are not permissible budget items.\n\nAs with all other AAG awards, eligibility also rests on the candidate being in compliance with the AAG Professional Conduct Policy. Nominations may be rescinded, and the award may also be revoked for any candidate or awardee who is found in violation of the AAG’s Professional Conduct Policy.\n\nCriteria:\n\nThe evaluation committee will select proposal(s) that in its judgment best address the objective of the fund as stated above. No awards will be made in years when funds are insufficient or if proposals are not suitable.\n\nApplications:\n\nDigital submissions are required. All information must be entered on our online application form. The form asks applicants to describe the research opportunity for the student and the manner in which the field experience will challenge the student to grow both personally and professionally. The review committee is aware that the personal experience and physical abilities of students will vary widely, and that what is challenging to one student may not be to another. Field experiences therefore may cover a large range of activities, so long as the outdoor experience will help the student to grow and excel in new ways. A budget and budget justification for the requested funds should be included on the form. The proposal should address how safety of the participants will be insured. The most successful proposals typically identify the individual students who will be involved in the study. Please view the application form before trying to submit, so that you have all information ready when you are ready to apply.\n\nSubmissions:\n\nSubmissions must be sent using the online application form. In exceptional cases, paper submissions may be accepted, but only with prior approval (requests should be sent to grantsawards@aag.org). Acknowledgement of receipt will be returned within a maximum of 2-3 business days. All applicants will be notified of the status of their submission within approximately 3 months after the deadline. Awardees may anticipate receiving their grants by late Spring, in time for summer scheduled activities.\n\nReports and Acknowledgment:\n\nBy accepting an AAG Grant you agree to submit to the AAG Executive Director a brief (two-page) report that summarizes the project and documents the expenses underwritten by the grant. Please include photographs of the field experience. You should submit your report upon completion of your research. Please acknowledge AAG support in presentations and publications.\n\nAbout Dr. Marcus:\n\nMelvin G. Marcus, past president of the American Association of Geographers and an internationally recognized physical geographer, structured his career around a balance of field work, theory development, teaching, and enjoyment of the geographic endeavor. Making physical geography accessible to everyone with a love of the outdoors, including women, minorities, and the less privileged, was one of Mel’s life-long objectives.\n\nTo put this objective into practice, Mel created and oversaw programs that emphasized excellence in field studies and the translation of field studies into scholarly achievement. He also believed in socializing and relaxing at the end of a field day, and encouraged collegiality and creative expressions of the enthusiasm and joy that often accompany field work.\n\nIn his own career, Mel took students on research expeditions to the Yukon and Alaska (especially the Juneau and St. Elias icefields), the Himalayas, the Southern Alps, the Colorado Rockies, and the Grand Canyon, as well as many other locations. These expeditions were often life-transforming experiences for those students fortunate enough to participate.\n\nAAG Marcus Fund for Physical Geography Recipients\n\nMauris non tempor quam, et lacinia sapien.
