        "text": "Tate Hildebrandt is in this week’s DragChamp Jr Racer Spotlight. Learn all about this DragChamp Pro Member in his spotlight below!\n\nPEARLAND, TX- Tate Hildebrandt has been drag racing for four years, ever since his grandpa, Kevin Theobald and dad, Jason Hildebrandt introduced him to the sport. Racing runs in the family, as both his grandpa and dad are also racers themselves. Tate started out racing in the 8.90 class and has since moved up into 7.90. He primarily competes in the Southwest Jr. Dragster Series and considers Houston Raceway Park, Xtreme Raceway Park, and Pine Valley Raceway his home tracks. This past year, Tate raced at 13 different tracks over 25 weekends, including prestigious events like the NHRA Western Conference Finals at Bandimere and the NHRA Eastern Conference Finals in Bristol.\n\nGet to know more about Tate below!\n\nHis Race Car\n\nTate’s current Junior Dragster is a 2004 Hardens, designed to resemble a WW1 Bomber. He has owned this car for 4 years. The car is powered by a 3 ½ inch Jim Rogers motor, capable of running 7.90s. In addition to his role as a driver, Tate is actively involved in maintaining his car. He has also learned the skills to swap engines and perform tasks such as removing and cleaning the clutch.\n\nOutside of Racing\n\nWhen Tate isn’t speeding down the track in his Junior Dragster, he finds joy in a variety of activities. From gaming sessions to tinkering with his race car, he keeps himself busy. His entertainment tastes range from his favorite movie, Cars to the rap music of Chief Keef. A fan of baseball, he proudly supports the Minnesota Twins. When hunger strikes, brisket is his go-to food with his favorite restaurant being Whataburger. Online, Tate channels his passion for racing into Roblox Drag Racing.\n\nAccomplishments\n\n2023 IHRA Division 4 Jr Dragster Champion\n\n2023 IHRA World Finals Qualifier\n\n2023 JDRL Challenge Wally at Julesburg Raceway 13-17 Age Group Winner\n\nSWJD All Run Big Money at I-30 Raceway Winner\n\n2022 IHRA D4 Jr Finals at Little River Raceway 10-12 Age Group Winner\n\n2022 IHRA D4 Team Finals shootout at Xtreme Raceway Park Winner\n\n2022 Space City Showdown at Houston Raceway Park Winner\n\n2022 Houston Raceway Park Points Race #2 6-12 Age Group Winner\n\n2022 Pueblo Motorsports Park Points race 2 10-13 Age Group Winner\n\n2022 Pueblo Motorsports Park Points race 3 10-13 Age Group Winner\n\n2023 Pine Valley Raceway Turkey Race 1K Runner-up\n\n2023 Xtreme Raceway Park Points Race Runner-up\n\nEdinberg Motorsports Park Points Race Runner-up\n\nXtreme Raceway Park Points Runner-up\n\n2022 Houston Raceway Park Points race #1 6-12 year Age Group Runner-up\n\n2022 Houston Raceway Park Points race #4 6-12 Age Group Runner-up\n\n2022 WCF Main Event 12 Year Old Semi-finalist\n\n2022 WCF Shootout 8.90 Class Semi-finalist\n\n2023 ECF 13 Year Old Main Event Semi-finalist\n\nTate’s Q&A\n\nWhich win are you most proud of?\n\nThe win I’m most proud of is the IHRA D4 Finals at Xtreme Raceway Park.\n\nWhat’s on your bucket list, future goals, what do you hope to achieve?\n\nI want to win WCF, ECF, and the Christmas on the coast 20k.
