        "meta_description": "Seed dispersal plays a significant role in forest regeneration and maintenance. Flying foxes are often posited as effective long-distance seed dispersers due to their large home ranges and ability to disperse seeds when flying. We evaluate the importance of the Madagascan flying fox Pteropus rufus in the maintenance and regeneration of forests in one of the world’s priority conservation areas. We tested germination success of over 20,000 seeds from the figs Ficus polita, F. grevei and F. lutea extracted from bat faeces and ripe fruits under progressively more natural conditions, ranging from petri-dishes to outdoor environments. Seeds from all fig species showed increased germination success after passing through the bats’ digestive tracts. Outside, germination success in F. polita was highest in faecal seeds grown under semi-shaded conditions, and seeds that passed through bats showed increased seedling establishment success. We used data from feeding trials and GPS tracking to construct seed shadow maps to visualize seed dispersal patterns. The models use Gaussian probability density functions to predict the likelihood of defecation events occurring after feeding. In captivity, bats had short gut retention times (often < 30 mins), but were sometimes able to retain seeds for over 24h. In the wild, bats travelled 3–5 km within 24–280 min after feeding, when defecation of ingested seeds is very likely. They produced extensive seed shadows (11 bats potentially dispersing seeds over 58,000 ha over 45 total days of tracking) when feeding on figs within their large foraging areas and dispersed the seeds in habitats that were often partially shaded and hence would facilitate germination up to 20 km from the feeding tree. Because figs are important pioneer species, P. rufus is an important dispersal vector that makes a vital contribution to the regeneration and maintenance of highly fragmented forest patches in Madagascar.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nWe report several novel findings that are important for seed dispersal in degraded habitats in the Old World tropics. First, we show that the germination success of fig seeds (which are important pioneer species), and the establishment of their seedlings, increases as a consequence of the seeds passing through the guts of flying foxes. Second, by using a combination of GRT and movement ecology data, we show that Madagascan flying foxes are important long distance seed dispersers, and frequently disperse seeds in degraded habitats, potentially facilitating forest regeneration. Below we discuss these aspects further.\n\nAmong all experiments the best germination results were achieved using filter paper where the Petri dishes provided a stable (albeit unnatural) environment. Seeds of F. polita extracted from the spat-out pellets (rejecta) had the lowest success. In most cases no, or very low, germination rates were evident. The spat-out seeds are empty husks and are mostly those already killed by fig wasp larvae (R.Z. Oleksy pers. obs.). As a result they lose their gelatinous coating, which makes it difficult for the bats to swallow the seeds, so they are rejected along with the fruit fibre, in the form of rejecta (spat-out) pellets [25]. Picot et al. (2007) confirmed the absence of germination from rejecta seeds [26]. The rejection of non-viable seeds may also enhance the success of P. rufus as a disperser of fig seeds compared with animals that do not reject non-viable seeds. Because we discarded seeds that showed evidence of fig wasp damage from ripe fruit, the higher germination success of seeds from faeces compared with seeds from ripe fruit is unlikely to be explained by the ripe fruit containing more non-viable seeds. In F. polita, faecal seeds sown in semi-shaded conditions achieved significantly greater germination success than those in direct sun or completely shaded conditions. It is expected that apart from faecal material remaining on the seeds, shade helps retain moisture in soil and this is necessary for seeds to grow. Although the number of germinated seeds was rather low in different shade treatments, the approach took into account such factors as predation and atmospheric changes, as the seeds were sown outside with no protection. Therefore, the seedlings were exposed to heavy rain and fluctuating humidity, as well as to many invertebrates that feed on seeds and seedlings. Given that at least 70% of seed shadows fell within or close to forested areas (i.e. often in semi-shaded conditions), this will further increase the likelihood of seed germination.\n\nA higher germination success for bat-processed seeds has been suggested previously [26] where Ficus seeds processed by the Madagascan fruit bat Eidolon dupreanum germinated better than unprocessed seeds (germination rates of 20% for F. brachyclada and 40% for F. pyrifolia while no seeds germinated from ripe fruits). The germination of F. lutea and F. natalensis seeds was higher after ingestion by P. voeltzkowi compared with germination rates of intact seeds [27]. However, both studies involved relatively small sample sizes and their germination experiments were minor additions to detailed studies of the bats’ diet. Seeds that pass through the digestive tract of animals may lose pericarp and mucilaginous coats that serve as substrates for fungal and bacterial infection, and may soften the seed coat after mastication or after exposure to acids and enzymes in the digestive tract [28, 29]. Additionally, animals remove the fruit pulp from the seeds, which usually contains germination inhibitors [30]. Faecal material that adheres to seeds may also provide nutrients that enhance germination success.\n\nOur experiments showed that bat-processed F. polita seeds germinated better in a relatively natural environment than unprocessed seeds and were more successful in terms of relatively long-term survival. Because Ficus species are often described as ‘keystone’ species in tropical ecosystems [e.g. 31], they have been promoted as framework species for tropical forest restoration [32]. Ficus produce fruit all year round, usually when other fruits are scarce [33]. They attract a wide range of frugivores, enabling them to survive during times of food shortage [e.g. 34]. Many Ficus species are fire-resilient and drought- and pest-resistant, and survive under the harsh conditions found in many degraded areas [35]. Additionally, their root systems can often penetrate even the hardest substrates (including rocks) improving its aeration and drainage, and making it suitable for the establishment of other plant species [36]. These characteristics of Ficus species, combined with the large number of fig seeds deposited by bats in a wide range of habitats increase the potential for germination and establishment, yet the propagation and use of figs as a tool to restore forest has been little studied [37]. Fruiting fig trees will in turn attract more frugivores, which contribute to the soil seed bank and thus facilitate passive restoration. Given its ability to disperse fig seeds and increase their germination success, P. rufus may act as a keystone species in regeneration of the forest in Madagascar. Our study focused on small seeds of Ficus species: larger seeds may be deposited directly under feeding trees after the fruit flesh is ingested. Qualitative analyses of droppings suggested that P.rufus were eating solely Ficus fruits at the time of study, although it is possible that the bats fed on some larger fruits and ate only the pulp, which could not be detected in faeces.\n\nBecause on average 2.5 droppings were produced in the first 30 min sample, average food transit time in P. rufus may be as short as 12 min. If all droppings were produced near the end of the inspection intervals, transit times may be closer to 30 min, which is the probability peak of the first defaecation event we have modelled here. Either way, it is clear that the transit time is short. This corresponds with previous findings in which food transit time in Pteropus, Ptenochirus, Nyctimene, Lissonycteris, Epomops and Rousettus species was recorded to be between 12 and 114 min (and is usually less than 30 min) [e.g. 25, 38–43]. A recent study on Eidolon helvum indicated a gut passage time between 4 to 1143 min with median of 72 min [12]. Our probability density function models incorporated a range of GRTs with a peak probability of first defaecation at 30 mins.\n\nSeveral studies have, like ours, estimated gut transit times using extracted seeds inserted into slices of other fruits such as papaya or banana [33,41] or using fluorescence dye on intact fruits [12]. As bananas are not commonly eaten by P.rufus the species and ripeness of fruit might affect gut passage times, especially due to the content of secondary plant compounds (or presence of dye), which may speed up or slow down gut passage [44,45]. The seeds with longer retention times may be dispersed over greater distances and in a larger variety of habitats than those with short GRTs [46]. We acknowledge that there are biases inherent in studies of GRTs, and such biases will affect our seed shadow estimates. However, such biases are inherent in most studies performed to date. Gut retention times will influence the capability of animals to disperse seeds and are likely to be species-specific and related to anatomy and physiology [46]. Our study tested only one seed species on a limited number of individuals. The food provided for the bats (bananas) is not commonly eaten by the species and may influence GRT. Ideally it would have been informative to measure retention times of fig seeds from intact ripe fig fruits. However, the bats refused to eat these in captivity. By placing the fig seeds on banana slices we were able to control the numbers of seeds given to the bats, but the texture of banana could differ substantially from that of fig potentially altering the time over which fig seeds pass through the bat guts. Additionally, captivity (and any associated stress) may alter the bats’ behaviour.\n\nDespite short defecation intervals in P. rufus, the bats can retain some seeds in the gut for over 20 h. Long retention times were also recorded for Cynopterus sphinx, where seeds were retained for more than 18 h [43]. Observations made on Rousettus captured around dusk showed that they defecate dark, viscous faeces that sporadically contained seeds. The faeces lacked the characteristic colour and texture of the eaten fruits, suggesting that they were retained in the gut during the day [44]. Also P. poliocephalus defecated when captured at dusk, suggesting long GRTs [43]. The feeding trials on P. rufus revealed similar behaviour. Bats refused to eat on the first night of captivity (just after capture) and did not defecate during the following day. Only in the evenings, at around 18.00 h did bats produce droppings that were similar in appearance to those described by Thomas (1988) [47]. This behaviour continued throughout the study, though it may have been a consequence of the stress bats experienced during the first day of capture. Nonetheless, retaining food in the gut during the daytime rest phase may be widespread in Old World fruit bats [47]. Such retained seeds would probably be deposited close to the day roosting site, which was used consistently by bats in our study.\n\nThe seed shadow map presented here (Fig 7) incorporated spatio-temporal movements of bats and the probability of the deposition of seeds into certain areas. It is not a generic seed dispersal pattern based on travelled distances, but the actual representation of an average bats’ day-to-day behaviour, showing stochastic seed dispersal events. It shows that bats disperse seeds over a vast area and away from the feeding sites. Although most seeds will be deposited below or in close proximity to the feeding trees (Fig 7), in many cases they will be dispersed while commuting between feeding sites. The average distance over which a bat would disperse seeds may be three to five km (Fig 4) and the maximum travel distance recorded over the time when seeds are most likely to be defecated is nearly 20 km. However, this only considers journeys up to three hours after eating figs. Taking into account that bats can retain small numbers of seeds for a day, some seeds may potentially be dispersed over much greater distances and in a wide range of directions.\n\nThe spatial scale of dispersal by P. rufus is much greater than those recorded in lemur species found in Madagascar. For example the highly frugivorous Eulemur fulvus collaris moves on average only between 1500 and 3500 m during a day [48]. Although these lemurs contribute to long distance dispersal (LDD) of large and small seeds, their movements are limited to the forest fragments in which they live. Small nocturnal lemur species (Microcebus spp.) have limited home ranges, typically from one to four hectares [49], and thus their dispersal abilities are more restricted.\n\nThe seed dispersal distances of birds have been studied in more detail, vary among species and habitats and provide a useful yardstick against which to compare our data. Hornbills Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus can disperse seeds as far as 6,919 and 3,558 m respectively [50]. On the other hand, small passerines (<110 g) in Spain disperse most of the seeds to less than 51 m and into covered microhabitats while medium-size birds (110–500 g) can show longer dispersal distances (>110 m) [51]. African turacos (Corythaeola cristata, Musophaga johnstoni and Tauraco schuettii) disperse seeds up to 304 m [52], bulbuls Hypsipetes amaurotis up to 300 m [53], and toucans (Ramphastos spp.) >100 m [54]. Recently, seed dispersal by Eidolon helvum was recorded at occurring over >70 km [12] demonstrating the ability of fruit bats to act as efficient long distance seed dispersers compared with many bird species.\n\nIn the majority of ecosystems, birds are the main vertebrate seed dispersers [55]. However, it has been suggested that bats, rather than birds, have a tendency to disperse seeds into clearings [56,57]. This is because birds are more likely to deposit seeds when perching on trees while bats defecate more during flight [e.g. 58,59]. Bats’ ability to defecate frequently when flying has been observed in Cynopterus spp., Rousettus amplexicaudatus and Pteropus vampyrus in Indonesia, and P. poliocephalus in Australia [43]. It is therefore highly likely that P. rufus exhibits the same behaviour. In this study. P. rufus spent nearly 30% of its nocturnal time budget flying and therefore is very likely to disperse many seeds during flight.\n\nThe foraging behaviour and flight speed of P. rufus facilitates long distance dispersal and ensures that seeds are deposited in cleared areas, far from forest boundaries as well as within isolated forest fragments. During flight, the bats can deposit seeds over a large area and far from the parental trees. The seed shadow map represents results from only 11 individuals out of around 600 in the colony (at the time of the study). It is therefore a case-specific documentation of seed dispersal by P. rufus at Berenty Reserve as the animal’s foraging behaviour might be influenced by the availability of other food types, time of the year, weather, habitat and reproductive status [5]. At some times of the year, the P. rufus roost at Berenty Reserve may contain over 2,000 individuals [60]. It is therefore clear that within a few months bats will create extensive seed shadows over their colony home range, as well as on their migratory pathways. Additionally, the seeds defecated by bats show increased germination and a better establishment rate to those extracted from fresh fruits. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence to support the hypothesis that P. rufus is an efficient long distance seed disperser vital for regeneration and maintenance of highly fragmented forest in Madagascar."
