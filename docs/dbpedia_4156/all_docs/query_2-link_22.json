        "text": "3.1. On-Going Assessment Is Important in Guiding Interventions and Influencing Change\n\nAssessment was identified by participants as a key theme and basis to providing effective intervention and care. Participants identified standardised models of assessment as a means of evaluating function.\n\n‘I can take implications from standardised tests as to how the individual functions in real life… and that allows me to make links with the level of cognition in people and their mobility level’ [P2].\n\nAssessment was also illustrated by participants as an on-going process in order to gain further insight into the context of a fluctuating and declining condition. This was described as being more difficult if the individual lived alone. Family and carers were found to be valuable sources of information and support, as well as presenting complex dynamics.\n\n‘Families, usually, in those circumstances are a really good source of collateral. However, sometimes…it can complicate the input’ [P4].\n\nParticipants perceived the assessment process as challenging and evolving. A range of assessment approaches, formats and models were reflected on as part of this process. Assessments were highlighted to include informal, perhaps more discrete assessment, to ensure interventions were person-centred.\n\nParticipants reflected on the value of assessments bringing about change. One participant discussed the ‘scope’ of influence and the opportunities to make improvements. Assessing the environment was a component of falls management which participants found important. Understanding the individual’s habits and routines was perceived as an essential component of this assessment.\n\n‘If you can make something an everyday activity by maybe re-arranging the environment so it becomes a more natural, more instinctive thing to do…. this hopefully takes them away from doing more risky activities’ [P3].\n\nParticipants discussed environmental adaptations made in response to visual and perceptual impairments.\n\n‘With perceptual difficulties in the home assessment…I am looking at the surfaces of the floor and the patterns…and if there’s anything that could be improved’ [P2].\n\nParticipants also felt that there were limitations to the changes they would like to make to benefit the individual. This included feelings of frustration at the limited time the participant might have with an individual. If you were ‘just visiting once a week, (you are) limited to how much influence and how much help you can be’ [P3]. Changes may not be sustained and individuals could be resistant to change as they may have had ‘feelings of autonomy about their own home and their own life’ [P3].\n\nParticipants highlighted the importance of individualised, thorough, on-going assessments to ensure interventions were at the right level for the right person and at the right time.\n\n4.1. Summary of Findings\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the challenges experienced by community health care workers when managing falls for individuals living with MCI or early dementia. To the best of our knowledge this is the first qualitative study to explore practice perceptions on this subject. This study found that combining physical and cognitive strategies was not widely practised as part of a falls prevention strategy. Such an approach has potential benefits but was highlighted as being complex and needs to be person-centred.\n\nParticipants identified impaired executive function as an important factor when managing falls in this population. This reflects findings from other studies [11,25,26]. There is a growth in evidence that associates executive function with gait changes and balance as important factors contributing towards falls risk. Adults with cognitive impairment have been found to demonstrate altered gait patterns, including reduced speed and increased stride variability, together with other motor dysfunctions such as reduced balance. The role cognition plays in the control of gait and balance can be considered to be dementia-specific falls risk factors, placing this population at a much higher risk of falls [26]. Additionally, a systematic review investigated specific cognitive factors to gait, balance, and falls, which further demonstrates the association between impaired executive function and gait changes [11]. This link contradicts earlier views that falls are a result of motor function failures [25]. Further studies found that regions of the brain involved in cognitive functioning and memory are required to coordinate mobility, balance, and gait [26]. Training both physical and cognitive functions has the potential to prevent mobility limitations and falls in dementia [26,27].\n\nDementia involves the progressive loss of an array of executive functions. In addition to physical alterations, it also affects movement coordination, visuospatial perception, and ability to recognise or respond to hazards [7]. In our study, participants experienced such challenges in practice, highlighting the higher level executive skills including flexible thinking and ability to adapt, which must be considered. Our study supports findings where an association was found between impaired gait adaptability and impaired executive function [28]. A further study found that falls with declining executive function are particularly relevant to frail older adults as they may not have the cognitive abilities to compensate for physical deficits [11]. This raises the question as to whether cognitive risk factors for falls can signify an emerging dementia pre-diagnosis, for which further research is required. Kearney et al. [11] adopted a rigorous design but reliability of their findings was limited by a lack of uniformity in outcome measures. There was also limited consensus regarding a definition of executive function, but this is found throughout the literature so comparisons between studies are challenging. There are also few studies that specifically include or focus on adults with cognitive impairment [29], reflecting complex and highly regulated approval processes, which lead to the under-represented populations in health research [30].\n\nThe different levels of physical and cognitive abilities are important factors when considering combined approaches. Individuals who are further advanced in their dementia would find such combinations more challenging and potentially over-whelming, to the extent that it could be detrimental. This is reflected in the findings of our study, particularly in the imagery of ‘flooding’ used by one participant which conveyed a feeling of submersion, empathising with the strength of emotion which can impact such individuals when faced with physical and cognitive challenges simultaneously. High levels of anxiety and emotion can increase falls risks, and makes addressing physical deficits more challenging. This highlights the value and importance of experience and incorporating knowledge into practice, as illustrated in the findings of our study.\n\nDual-tasking can be extremely challenging and emphasises the need for on-going assessments to be person-centred. In our study, participants identified on-going assessment as a basis for clinical decision-making and determining what approaches were appropriate or beneficial to the individual. Different models of assessment were illustrated by participants as being crucial to gaining insight and adding context to dementia as a complex and deteriorating condition. This key theme is in line with previous studies. For example, Caetano et al. [28] found that the addition of a cognitive task to a physical task resulted in the individual prioritising the physical task by slowing the gait speed, for example. Individuals who are further impaired cognitively may not be able to perform such prioritisation and are at a higher risk of falls. This reinforces the need for careful consideration of the stage of dementia the individual has reached. It also supports the important role of earlier intervention and how this affects outcome [31]. Early interventions in falls prevention specifically designed for this population supports longer-term sustainability of any changes, helping to reduce dependency and prevent crisis [2,8]. The complex interplay between motor and cognitive functioning is common in daily activities [32]. When introduced in the earlier stages of dementia, combining physical and cognitive approaches can improve dual-task capabilities. Such an approach helps to inform and achieve meaningful, functional goals [9] to be important to the individual, to their carers and family and to the health care worker, as identified in our study. The findings from our study supports those from a previous study where significant improvements were found in cognitive functions, functional balance, and functional status in individuals with MCI who underwent a 10-week structured functional task exercise programme [14]. Additionally, a stimulating environment can enhance the benefits of a combined approach and increase the impact on neuroplasticity [33,34]. This was highlighted in our study by participants who felt that a lack of stimulation affects motivation and leads to decreased activity.\n\nConsideration of the stage of dementia can also inform intervention choice such as exercise mode or approach. Multicomponent exercise training, for example, can improve functionality in older people by addressing several falls risk factors associated with physical decline in older age [10]. This includes improvements in strength, flexibility, and balance which in turn improves physical function and reduces the risk of falls [10,35]. However, which exercise mode most suitable for older adults, particularly those with dementia, requires further research [36,37]. Previous studies found that multicomponent exercise can benefit individuals with dementia in improving function [37]. Our study also highlights the challenges dual-tasking can present for individuals in the more advanced stages of dementia; combining different exercise modes simultaneously could be over-whelming and potentially distressing for such individuals and further research is required [37]. Exploring exercise training modes in the community is limited by the need for more specialised exercise health professionals and is beyond the scope of this study.\n\nParticipants emphasised the strength and support provided as part of a multi-disciplinary team, particularly reflecting on the breadth of skill and experience required in the context of dementia care. The sharing of knowledge from experience is illustrated as being essential to applying, effectively, formal learnings and theory to practice. Previous studies have also found that an integrated team approach enhanced intervention and progression towards goals [38]. However, issues of conflict and potential for dilution of professional identity and role were also raised. This reflects the wider changes to healthcare with the growth of the Integrated Care System (ICS) which is recognised as a response to the rising numbers of older people living with complex long-term health conditions [39]. This move is a key part of the NHS Long-Term Plan to deliver person-centred care that is effective, timely, and equitable [40]. Integrated care is complex and there is a lack of evidence or guidance on how professionals can prepare themselves to preserve their professional identity while working as an effective team member [41]. Identities must be flexible and able to adapt to a changing professional landscape within an on-going process of identity formation. Findings in our study highlight the lack of empirical research relating to workforce perceptions of an integrated care system [39]. Identifying what matters to the workforce would enable systems to respond, adapt and deliver optimum sustainability to very vulnerable populations."
