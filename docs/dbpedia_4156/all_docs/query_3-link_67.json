        "text": "A short survey - I’ve been wondering who’s reading my spy novels (see janmccleery.pixieset.com) and which one they like the best so I’m sending out a short survey. Plus it includes a blatant request for book reviews on amazon - where you go to the book page (go to amazon and search for Jan McCleery and my books come up) give one or more of them 1-5 stars and, hopefully, add a review. Good or bad reviews are fine - it lets amazon and publishers know people are reading the books :-) https://lnkd.in/dmsRRNy9\n\nIn this Quarterly Newsletter for Book Lovers, I am sharing my five favorite novels from the last several months and so much more!
