        "text": "Imagine transforming a shipping container into a fully equipped clinical trial site for malaria. This is what happened in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, where with the support of Novartis and Medicines for Malaria Venture, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute flew a ‘lab in a box’ – a fully equipped shipping container that was assembled on site. This will become a semi-permanent facility for current and future clinical trials. This solution underscores the importance of conducting clinical trials where the highest burden of disease is, even when it means investing in infrastructure and taking risks to reach remote communities. We believe that bringing clinical trials to hard-to-reach areas is important not just to advance science – but also to build lasting healthcare capacity in the communities that need it most.

Novartis, in partnership with the Swiss Center of Scientific Research (Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Côte d'Ivoire) and Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, will support the center in Abidjan which will provide specialized care and further research initiatives to advance treatment options. About 80% of the global sickle cell disease (#SCD) burden is in Africa, where at least 50% of children born with SCD die before their fifth birthday. Côte d'Ivoire has an estimated SCD prevalence of 2% with under-5 mortality similar to other African countries. The World Health Organization has identified early diagnosis as a key measure in the fight against the hereditary blood disorder, and the center will integrate screening and diagnosis into primary health care services. The goal is to enroll over 70% of screen-positive patients in a comprehensive disease management program and adopt technology solutions to ensure continuity of care and quality data collection. In addition, nurses and community healthcare workers will be trained on the use of SCD point-of-care devices and genetic counseling in a community-based setting. This SCD center which is located within the Yopougon Millionnaire Extension Mixed Health Center, is part of a partnership between #Yopougon community and the Swiss Kanton Basel-Stadt. The Yopougon Health Center includes general medicine, obstetrics, pediatrics and dentistry services, as well as a pharmacy and laboratory. Lutz Hegemann I Manon COULIBALY I Nicola Lister I Gesa.

The manuscript details research into a new approach for inducing fetal hemoglobin production. Higher fetal hemoglobin levels significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in #SCD. The goal of Novartis research is an improved oral treatment that addresses the unmet need for accessible options for patients in low- and middle-income regions, where the disease burden is greatest. https://lnkd.in/dZ3CTCmj Pamela Ting I Jay Bradner\n\nWhat a remarkable day this was! Our highlights included: 🌍 Showcasing the power of Swiss-African collaboration. With rapidly evolving changes in demographics and geopolitics across Africa, we believe it is crucial to deepen engagement, fostering collaboration in areas ranging from research and development to trade. 🤝Agreeing that strong multi-sector partnerships are the fastest – and perhaps only – way to drive lasting change. Through co-creation and collaboration, we, as a global community, can make innovation happen fast, reach everyone who needs it, and be sustainable. 💊 Shifting our perspective from viewing healthcare as a cost, to recognizing it as a driver of economic growth and prosperity. Thank you to Swiss-African Business Circle, Afreximbank, SECO, our visitors, partners, and co-hosts for making this day a reality! We look forward to further collaboration. #AfricaBusinessDay | #ABD24 | #GlobalHealth | Swiss-African Business Circle | African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) | Novartis | State Secretariat for Economic Affairs\n\nTwo years ago, Novartis endorsed the Kigali Declaration, pledging to accelerate the elimination of neglected tropical diseases that continue to cause suffering and stigma for millions. Here are some of the strides we have made together with our partners since then, advancing research and development of new treatments: ▪ Nearly half of the world’s population is now at risk of 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐞 𝐟𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫, with 100-400 million infections annually. We advanced a potential treatment for dengue to Phase 2 clinical development in 2024. Wellcome Trust partnered in research efforts, and current discovery work involves collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health. ▪ 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐢𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐬 is a major cause of severe parasite-induced diarrhea in young children, prevalent in Africa and Asia. With support from Wellcome Trust, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners, we moved the most advanced candidate for the treatment of life-threatening pediatric cryptosporidiosis into Phase 1 clinical development in 2023. ▪ Each year, 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐞𝐢𝐬𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐕𝐋) affects more than 50 000 new people, mainly in South America, East Africa, and South Asia. Novartis, with financial support from Wellcome Trust, discovered a first-in-class parasite-specific growth inhibitor for the treatment of VL. The compound is also a frontrunner for 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞, a parasitic disease affecting more than 6 million people globally, primarily in Latin America. The compound entered Phase 2 clinical development in 2023 for both indications. We are proud to partner with Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative - DNDi on the development of this potential treatment. With governments, pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, and other partners all taking action, we can #UniteActEliminate to #BeatNTDs. Stay tuned as we continue to push the boundaries of innovation! #NTDs #100percentCommitted #NTDroadmap #CoaliciónChagas\n\n📣 Breaking! The first-ever guidance for managing #sicklecelldisease across Africa is out! The World Health Organization Africa has released the WHO SICKLE Package of Interventions for Sickle Cell Disease Management to help countries improve quality of care, broaden access to treatment and strengthen health outcomes. The guidance was developed in collaboration with academic, public and private sector partners including Novartis to strengthen efforts to tackle the growing toll of sickle cell disease (#SCD). About 80% of the 8 million people with SCD worldwide live in Africa, where there is a lack of facilities that can provide comprehensive services including research, training and clinical management. Dr. Isaac Odame of Global Sickle Cell Disease Network, an expert contributor to the guidance documents, Guidance Framework for Sickle Cell Disease Management and Harmonized Guide for Sickle Cell Disease Management in Africa, believes this a critical step towards the reduction in incidence, morbidity and mortality due to SCD in Africa.

Five things we learned in the webinar: 1. Early detection saves lives. Enabling this requires awareness raising and increased access to newborn screening. 2. Since the lion’s share of the disease burden falls in low- and middle-income countries, access to healthcare needs to start at the primary care level and be integrated across the system. 3. The WHO and partners including Novartis have developed the first guidance framework for treating SCD holistically in Africa, which carries 80% of the global disease burden. 4. Healthcare providers need to be trained and equipped, and access broadened to treatments like the generic disease modifying therapy that helps people living with the disease live longer and fuller lives. 5. Cross-sector collaboration can help ensure care is affordable and sustainable. The webinar, organized in collaboration with the World Coalition on Sickle Cell Disease (WCSCD) and Business Council for International Understanding (BCIU), closed with panelists calling for a global movement where public and private sector leaders and academia join forces with patient advocates to raise awareness of #SCD and its significant burden.

The experiences of his older brother as a person living with sickle cell disease (SCD) deeply impacted Jean while growing up. The challenges his brother faced, compounded by limited access to healthcare, made managing the disease even more difficult for their family. Watch the video to hear Jean's inspiring story, #MyWhy. Let's join forces in raising awareness about SCD. By educating ourselves about the disease, we can contribute to reducing stigma and fostering a greater understanding of the challenges faced by people with SCD. Together, we can work towards addressing disparities and promoting health equity for everyone. Remember, you are not alone in this journey. #SCD #Purpose #WorldSickleCellDay\n\nAre you interested in learning about best practices in managing sickle cell disease?
