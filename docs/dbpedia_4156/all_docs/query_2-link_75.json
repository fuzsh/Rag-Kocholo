        "text": "Benjamin Grows Up Fast to Win Azera 100, Earn First Victory at Five Flags\n\nChuck Corder\n\nTeenage sensations are used to topping the charts.\n\nIt was fitting then that Kyle Benjamin, the 13-year-old phenom driver, recorded a blockbuster No. 1 hit in the Allen Turner Pro Late Model Azera 100 on Friday at Five Flags Speedway.\n\nHow he got there ultimately didnâ€™t matter. The simple fact he was in Victory Lane for the first time at the famed, half-mile asphalt oval added another chapter to the kidâ€™s ballooning legacy.\n\nBenjamin, who led the majority of laps Friday, benefited late from some more Bubba Pollard-D.J. VanderLey fireworks and bask in a watermark win.\n\nâ€œI always wanted to win here,â€? said the Easley, S.C., driver. â€œItâ€™s a very hard place to win at. Itâ€™s like Darlington or Bristol. This is really special.â€?\n\nThe moment, obviously, wasnâ€™t lost on Benjamin.\n\nNeither was the path that brought him to the checkered flag first.\n\nPollard had the fast time in qualifying at 16.922 seconds, but a die roll of eight set an eight-car invert in the 22-car field. That put Pensacolaâ€™s Keith Thorpe on the pole.\n\nBenjamin took the lead from Thorpe on Lap 22 and led until Lap 75 when Pollard passed him on the fifth restart of the night.\n\nVanderLey took second 10 laps later and it appeared Benjamin would settle for third.\n\nInstead on a late restart with 93 laps completed, the feud between VanderLey and Pollard reared its ugly head in an ugly way once again. The two exchanged some heated words at the Allen Turner Pro Late Model race June 10.\n\nVanderLey got into the side of Pollard and spun him down the front stretch.\n\nâ€œI was trying to pass Bubba and I may have had an inch or two on him,â€? VanderLey said. â€œHe came down to block me and thatâ€™s the way it goes. Iâ€™m sure (Pollard will) have a different story.â€?\n\nIn fact, Pollard did.\n\nâ€œI was leading the race and got turned around,â€? Pollard said, doing his best to conceal his frustrations.â€?Itâ€™s going to be my fault somehow and I was out front. Ask anybody throughout the pits and theyâ€™ll tell you the same thing. (His No.) 18 was out front once again, thatâ€™s all I can say.â€?\n\nInstead, Pollard let his car do his talking. As the field was under caution, he waited for VanderLey to make it around the oval. Anticipating the retaliation, VanderLey slowed up and attempted to allow Pollard to pull away.\n\nInstead, Pollard shoved his No. 18 in â€œreverseâ€? and crunched VanderLeyâ€™s front end.\n\nâ€œThatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t want to pass (Pollard) there,â€? VanderLey said. â€œItâ€™s just part of it.â€?\n\nWhile Pollard was black-flagged, thus ending his night, VanderLey was sent to the tail end of the lead lap, which amounted to six cars.\n\nBenjamin, running third when the fracas spilled out before him, assumed the lead and held off Chris Davidson. VanderLey hustled for a third-place finish.\n\nâ€œI saw (Pollard and VanderLey) bang and I thought, â€˜Oh, God, here it comes,â€™ â€? Benjamin said. â€œI barely had enough room to make it through that.â€?\n\nVanderLey was a Five Flags darling en route to the Pro Late Models track title last year.\n\nWhile he treasured his finish â€” â€œThis is the best third place Iâ€™ve ever hadâ€? â€” he received mixed reviews from the Five Flags faithful when he climbed out of his No. 2.\n\nâ€œAll in all it was a good night for the points and our finish,â€? said VanderLey, who cut Pollardâ€™s lead to just nine heading in the regular season finale Oct. 8. â€œI was confident in the car.â€?\n\nBenjamin knew his car had the mettle to win Friday.\n\nâ€œThere were some heavy hitters out here,â€? he said. â€œTo finish first, itâ€™s an amazing feeling.â€?\n\nThe rising star wasnâ€™t the only one who knew his was the car to beat.\n\nâ€œKyle was better than we were,â€? Pollard said. â€œHe deserved to win.â€?\n\nThe first of what figures to be many big hits at Five Flags for Benjamin.\n\nAllen Turner Pro Late Models Azera 100â€”1. Kyle Benjamin, 2.

Mason Mitchell\n\nModifieds\n\nChris Cotto loves him some fresh air.\n\nOut front most of the night in the 35-Lap Modifieds feature, an out-of-breath Cotto inhaled a little bit more of the crisp night in Victory Lane.\n\nA group of paramedics kidded Cotto by strapping an oxygen mask onto his face and the Milton driver playfully posed for photographs. Gerald Wilkerson finished second and series points leader Todd Jones was third.\n\nâ€œI ainâ€™t as tired as I was last time,â€? Cotto joked. â€œI enjoyed that. The car was tight in qualifying, but it paid off for us.â€?\n\nCotto assumed the lead with 12 complete when then-leader Bubba Pollardâ€™s No. 07 came to a standstill on the backstretch to bring out a caution.\n\nIt was a disappointing result for Pollard, who was extremely racey early on.\n\nHe was shot out of a cannon following the first caution, zooming by Cotto on the third lap.\n\nWilkerson, who began second overall Friday, cut into Jonesâ€™ points lead thanks to his runner-up finish.\n\nModifieds 35-Lap Feature Resultsâ€”1.

Nathan Ingersoll\n\nSportsmen\n\nSteve Buttrick had a healthy dose of hindsight Friday.\n\nHe easily grabbed his sixth Sportsmen win of the season on Double Points Night to shoot a couple place from fifth where he started the night. The victory was a bit bittersweet.\n\nâ€œI wish I had this car last race,â€? Buttrick said.\n\nThe Sportsmen race last month was for $1,000 and won by Brannon Fowler.\n\nOn this Friday, while Fowler and Randy Thompson battled for second all night, Buttrick easily made his way around the speedway for 20 laps.\n\nâ€œWe were pretty good tonight,â€? said Buttrick, who is the seriesâ€™ reigning track and Snowball Derby champion. â€œI hope itâ€™s this good at the Derby.â€?\n\nWhile Buttrick took home the checkered flag, Scott Barbaric left a lasting impression.\n\nWith just two laps left, Barbaricâ€™s No. 55 did several barrel rolls and ended up on the infield.\n\nAfter Michael Couture spun going into Turn 2, Barbaric began to fish-tail trying to avoid him. Barbaric clipped the outside wall, then clipped Couture and began a gradual tumble down the speedway.\n\nBarbaric flipped three times in all, over the inside fence and barely missed some spectatorsâ€™ cars that were parked on the infield.\n\nAmazingly, Barbaric kept his sense of humor through those thrilling acrobatics.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m good. I hope it was as cool looking as it felt inside. Iâ€™m fine. It was laying on its side for a little while. I went high, it closed up. I hit the outside wall and hit (Couture). I remember rolling. It was like a roller coaster ride. It reminded me of the Zipper ride at the Fair.â€?\n\nSportsmen 20-Lap Feature Results â€” 1. Steve Buttrick, 2. Randy Thompson, 3. Brannon Fowler, 4.

Then, amazingly, Day managed to hold on after he got sideways splitting lapped traffic on the second-to-last lap.\n\nJust when he looked like he was going to crash into the inside wall and allow Goodwin to coast into Victory Lane, Day righted the wheel just in time.\n\nHe celebrated with the checkered on top of his black No. 98.\n\nâ€œFinally!â€? Day said of his long-awaited win. â€œIâ€™m worn out. Itâ€™s a lot harder racing over here than in Mobile.â€?\n\nAs huge as Dayâ€™s win was, Goodwinâ€™s runner-up finish was equally important on Double Points Night.\n\nThe charter fishing boat captain came into Friday with an eight-point lead on Brandon Burks. Goodwin extended his lead after Burks finished third.\n\nâ€œIt definitely helps out,â€? Goodwin said. â€œWe wouldâ€™ve liked to win, but that (No.) 98 car sure is fast. But oh well, weâ€™ll take second.â€?\n\nBombers 20-Lap Feature Results â€” 1. Jay Jay Day, 2. Gary Goodwin, 3. Brandon Burks, 4. Robert Balkum, 5. Kerner Kafka, 6. Michael Nelson, 7. Tracy Soles, 8.
