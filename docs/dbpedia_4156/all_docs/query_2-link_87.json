        "text": "I'd be willing to pay more than the voucher for a steel frame that I knew was going to last.\n\nI'm also taken with the idea of getting my son on his bike and doing some light camping/fishing.\n\nSo the croix de fer seems to tick all of those boxes. To be honest, the Temple bike is just me thinking wow, that's amazing, will it fit what I need. It is lighter but not as set up to go fast\n\nDon’t know if this helps but my Croix de Fer is currently on 3755 miles and my Day One Decade (almost same frame but single speed) is on 5488 miles. The CDF has to have the groupset replaced after I killed it in the Scottish highlands, the DOD has needed the rear wheel hub replaced.\n\nYes makes sense, groupset will always degrade, but I'm guessing the frame is rock solid. My carbon cube I rode through the winter is still workable, but cosmetically, despite being looked after, looks like it's been through a war zone.\n\nHow is the croix de fer compared to a road bike? Can you get it up to speed?\n\nCompared to the temple I'm looking at the CDF seemsnto have a much more compact frame\n\nHow is the croix de fer compared to a road bike? Can you get it up to speed?\n\nI rode my Roubaix to work the other week and it was like having a devil on my shoulder shouting “faster,faster” all the time (averaged 18mph over 14 miles).\n\nThe CDF can be pushed to get speed I do regularly see 17mph, it just feels too relaxed to put the effort in. I find the frame only feels heavy if you’re lifting it, once rolling you don’t notice the weight. I’m running 700x35 gravel tyres.\n\nAh OK\n\nThanks for the help . I'm guessing sweeping over to 28 slicker tyres may help on my commute.\n\nAnd to make my mind up I've just found the 2018 croix de fer in XS at a ridiculous price of 750. And it's in that lovwly retro pale blue/ dove grey\n\nI think that is the one!\n\nThe Temple was one of two bikes on my shortlist. They do make beautiful bikes.\n\nIn the end I opted for the other bike on my list. Sonder Santiago which is probably more of a tourer than you're looking for. The steel frame is a fantastic ride. The other two bikes I have are also steel frames, but the Sonder is a proper all day ride. Out on it for 8 hours yesterday testifies to that. Got it using a C2W voucher too, which I sort of had to after mithering my boss forever to sign up for C2W.\n\nEnjoy your new CDF.\n\nThe sonder looks quite racey?\n\nI'd have all of the temple bikes, gorgeous.\n\nBut 1100 extra for a retro look and 105? No brainer really. Maybe I'll get the temple single speed with my next voucher....\n\nBeing a confirmed solo - and devoutly uncompetitive - cyclist I feel like I'm going fast on it, but yesterday some fella with thighs like a kangaroo and the skinniest tyres I've ever seen went flying past me. Maybe it looks sporty, but the engine is very much built for comfort rather than speed.\n\nI can't fathom Temple making a single speed. They're in Bristol, right? Where it's very lumpy... Anyway it was the Adventure that was on my list. I think a fair bit of the additional £500 cost compared to my bike is the UK-made 725 frame vs the forrin-made 631 frame. A London shop's going to cost them a bit to run too. It's difficult to say whether the price difference is justified without trying the bike.\n\nBe happy with the bike you're on. :-)\n\nI think the temple frames are made abroad and then painted here according to a review. The adventure disc is now 1800, as opposed to 1600 last year.\n\nI've just ordered the croix de fer 2018, beautiful colour. And for £750. Very pleased with the find. Thanks to whoever pointed out the size issue, I checked measurements and it comes in almost to the millimetre the same as my colnago. Ordered pedals, shorts and shoes with the remaining voucher money"
