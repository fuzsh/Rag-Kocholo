        "text": "Prosthetic Components\n\nFor each missing joint, various options are available. For replacement shoulder function, there are only passive components, either friction or locking. Currently, no shoulder joints are commercially available that are motorized or body-powered; the same is true for replacement of humeral rotation. However, the commercial release of the DEKA arm will offer both powered shoulder movement and humeral rotation. At the elbow, there are motorized joints (myoelectric/externally powered) as well as body-powered joints. The motorized elbows have passive lift (how much can be carried) of approximately 50 pounds, which is comparable to body-powered elbows, although none of the motorized joints are able to flex actively with more than a few pounds held in the hand (Heckathorne, 1992). Available at the wrist are friction/locking and motorized wrist rotators; at this time, however, there are only friction/locking wrist flexion units.\n\nMany varieties of terminal devices (hooks or hands) are available for both myoelectric and body-powered prostheses. There are body-powered hook options—called voluntary opening (VO) devices—in which pulling on the cable opens the device, and a spring or rubber bands cause it to close (see ). The hooks can be aluminum, titanium, or steel, depending on the durability needed, although the more durable ones are often heavier. One limitation of VO devices is that grip strength is limited by the rubber bands or springs used. To achieve a higher grip strength, the user must pull against this force every time the device is opened. Another variation is voluntary closing (VC) devices, in which pulling on the cable causes the device to close, and a lightweight spring causes it to open. The user can generate much higher grip forces with a VC than with a VO device, but unless using some kind of cleat or cable lock, must maintain tension on the harness to keep the device closed. The amount of force required varies across types of VC terminal devices (Smit and Plettenburg, 2010). Both VO and VC hands also exist. A body-powered prosthesis can be provided with a hook, a hand, or both to interchange in specific situations, most often for cosmesis or for use in social settings. Specialized work or recreation devices may also be interchanged on a body-powered system to maximize function during tasks when a traditional hook or hand device is not optimal (Texas Assistive Devices, 2016; TRS Prosthetics, 2016).\n\nFIGURE 4-6\n\nExamples of body-powered hooks.

Hosmer 7 Work Hook, voluntary opening. SOURCES: (more...)\n\nFor body-powered systems, it is important that the individual have the range of motion and strength to operate the device. To fully open a standard VO hook, 2 inches of cable excursion is required. For a body-powered elbow, an additional 2.5 inches is required. To enable this full range of movement, the socket must fit well, and the harness must be properly fit to the user—a potentially time-consuming task. Proper fitting of the harness also often requires that it fit very tightly on the body, which can cause discomfort and lead to abandonment.\n\nMotorized hooks and hands also are available (see and , respectively). They are much heavier (approximately 1-1.5 pounds) than the body-powered hooks (0.25-0.5 pound) and hands (0.75 pound) (Belter et al., 2013; Fillauer Companies, Inc., 2016; Hosmer, 2017; Steeper, 2016). The advantage of motorized hooks is that they are more durable than a motorized hand and can generate much more force than the frequently used VO hooks. Motorized hands can be divided into two categories: single-degree-of-freedom and multiarticulating. Single-degree-of-freedom hands have one motor and only open and close. They are the most durable type of myoelectric hand and can generate the most pinch force (Belter et al., 2013).\n\nFIGURE 4-7\n\nExamples of two powered hooks. NOTE: A.

Because the motors are smaller, these hands cannot generate the same pinch force as a single-motor hand; by individually powering each digit, however, a more conforming grasp can be achieved.\n\nFIGURE 4-9\n\nExamples of three multiarticular hands, all shown without a glove.

These limitations and restrictions are greater with bilateral than with unilateral limb loss (Davidson, 2004). Disability also is typically greater with more proximal-level (transhumeral and shoulder-level) than with transradial-level amputation (Lerman et al., 2005; Resnik and Borgia, 2015), although people with partial hand amputation report greater disability than those with either transradial or transhumeral amputation (Davidson, 2004). Additionally, some evidence suggests that the impact on functional performance is greater for acquired than for congenital limb loss (James et al., 2006), although the evidence for this finding is mixed (Lerman et al., 2005).\n\nSeveral small studies have found that persons with upper-limb amputation who use a prosthesis report less disability, as measured by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and QuickDASH questionnaires, relative to those who do not use such a device (Lifchez et al., 2005; Resnik and Borgia, 2015). However, as many as one-third of prosthesis users report that they do not find their device to be useful to them when performing daily activities or work functions (Datta et al., 2004). Prosthesis users report dissatisfaction with their ability to use their devices in such daily tasks as food preparation, eating, and self-care (Ritchie et al., 2011). And some research focused on pediatric congenital amputees has found no differences in functional performance between children who utilize a prosthesis and those who do not (James et al., 2006), suggesting that children adapt to limb deficiency at a young age and maximize function without the use of a prosthetic limb.\n\nIt is clear that currently available upper-limb prostheses cannot replace the complex functions of the missing upper limb because of limitations inherent in their control and design, their lack of sensory feedback, and the methods required to suspend them onto the residual limb. The human hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder complex together comprises 32 bones, with dozens of movable joints and muscles, which together enable a wide field of active movement around the body, sometimes called the “functional envelope” (Harrtigan and Serrafin, 2004).\n\nAlthough prosthesis use may in some instances partially mitigate the impact of upper-limb amputation on impairments in body functions and limitations in activity, the amount of mitigation provided by the prosthesis varies by the type of device used, as well as the level of amputation (see ) and, as discussed later in the chapter, of user training and ability. The findings in were determined through the consensus of committee members based on their expert knowledge, review of selected manufacturers' specifications, and review of the scientific literature. These findings are summarized below.\n\nANNEX TABLE 4-2\n\nAbility of Upper-Limb Prosthetic Devices to Mitigate the Effects of Impairment.\n\nBody Image\n\nThe experience of acquired amputation is disruptive to one's body image and sense of self-esteem (Morris, 2008; Racey, 1992; Winchell, 1996). Body image includes physical, psychological, and social components. The upper extremities are an integral part of a person's self-identity, communication, and social interactions with others (Desteli et al., 2014), and acquired amputation, as well as congenital limb absence, can be associated with significant psychological distress, embarrassment, and shame due to perceived social stigma. Some persons with amputation may experience prejudice from others and a sense of injustice as a result of the visibility of their disability. For some people with limb loss, cosmetic restoration is highly valued, or even preferred over functional restoration, because of its mitigating effect on the disruption to body image. People with upper-limb loss in particular report high levels of distress about body image, and for them, the cosmetic aspects of the prosthesis are considered more important than is the case for people with lower-limb loss (Desteli et al., 2014). Thus, some people with limb loss may prefer terminal devices that resemble more closely the shape of the hand than a hook because they appear more like an unimpaired hand, and so may draw less attention to the prosthesis (Flannery and Faria, 1999; Hanson, 2003). Indeed, concerns about body image and the desire to improve cosmesis with prosthetic devices can result in rejection of prosthetic devices that may be more functional and may impact the choice of prosthetic devices, particularly for activities, such as work, that involve interaction with others (Morris, 2008; Racey, 1992; Winchell, 1996). Completely passive prostheses provide the best mitigation of cosmetic impairment. Cosmetic coverings can approximate the skin tone of the lost limb, and custom coverings may provide high-definition, cosmetic restoration that fully mirrors skin coloring, as well as anatomical details such as freckles or even hair of the lost limb. As discussed later in the chapter, however, access to such custom coverings varies because of limitations in reimbursement and the availability of providers who can make them.\n\nSensation\n\nResearch is under way on means of providing sensory function to prosthesis users (Carlsen et al., 2014; Chaubey et al., 2014; Cipriani et al., 2011, 2012; Clippinger et al., 1974; Hebert et al., 2014, 2016; Marasco et al., 2009; Nghiem et al., 2015; Rager et al., 2013; Schiefer et al., 2016; Schofield et al., 2014; Tabot et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2015; Tyler, 2015; Witteveen et al., 2014, 2015). Some existing devices have crude sensors for grip pressure or other features intended to provide the user with information on touch or object slip. However, all currently available devices fall short of restoring the sense of touch or proprioception of the missing appendage. Limited proprioception is available because users can feel the weight of the socket on the residual limb as the device is positioned in space and the muscular energy associated with the body movements required to pull the cable (for body-powered devices) or contraction of the musculature required to operate the myoelectric controls (for myoelectric devices). Loss of sensation makes control of grip force problematic, as prosthesis users cannot tell how hard they are gripping objects; thus, they are susceptible to dropping items because of too little or improper grip or to crushing fragile items by using a stronger grip than intended (Schiefer et al., 2016). To ensure that an object is held firmly, the user may be able to listen for the sound of the motors stalling or just hold a contraction after contacting an object so a large grip force is generated. For the most part, however, the user must rely on vision to modulate grip force and object placement (Sobuh et al., 2014), and so may avoid handling delicate, fragile, or slippery objects with the prosthesis. Lack of sensation also impairs the performance of fine motor activity.\n\nPassive Range of Motion\n\nNo currently available upper-limb prosthesis can execute all of the passive movements of the human upper extremity. Although some advances have been achieved in improving the movements of multiarticulating prosthetic hands, even the most advanced of these devices, which may allow passive movement of the thumb or other digits, do not possess all of the passive range of motion of the human hand. The most commonly used terminal devices—body-powered and myoelectric hooks—have only a single degree of freedom, meaning that they can be moved only in two opposing directions—open and closed. Other myoelectric devices, such as the i-limb and Michelangelo hands, have a movable thumb and compliance in the digits that enable some degree of passive movement to conform to grasped objects.\n\nSome existing prosthetic wrists allow passive wrist pronation and supination. However, prosthetic wrists lack full passive flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation, although there are some compliant wrists that allow a small amount of passive wrist movement in these directions. In contrast, most prosthetic elbows possess good passive flexion and extension movement, although some myoelectric elbows can be positioned only by motor action. Some shoulder-level prostheses have a fixed shoulder joint that does not move at all, while others can be manually positioned and then locked in a limited set of positions or held in place with friction.\n\nActive Range of Motion\n\nActive control of the movements of upper-limb prostheses is limited by both hardware constraints and currently available prosthetic control options. Even when passive range of motion is available (as described above), the user may not have active range of motion or control of that range. This may be because the device lacks the actuators and motors to move the joint. Some hand designs, for example, are under actuated, meaning that joints are linked together so they can be powered by a single motor or action. As another example, certain multiarticulating hands that have passive thumb movement require the user to position the thumb manually to change the thumb alignment. Further, no currently available devices allow active control over wrist flexion and extension or radial and ulnar deviation, humeral rotation, or powered shoulder movement in any direction.\n\nLimitations in the active range of motion of any joint negatively impact the size of the functional envelope and are considered a contributing factor in the compensatory movements of the trunk observed in kinematic studies of upper-limb prosthesis users (Carey et al., 2008). This abnormal movement may, in turn, be associated with overreliance and overuse injuries of the sound side that have been reported (for people with unilateral amputation) and the more proximal joints and/or the neck and back (Burger and Vidmar, 2016; Østlie et al., 2011; Postema et al., 2012, 2016a).\n\nThe current standard for controlling prostheses is direct control, meaning that the user directly operates a specific control to activate a single intended movement, such as wrist extension to control hand opening (Phillips et al., 2013). In most cases, each intended prosthesis movement must be activated by the user in a sequential fashion, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to engage available powered movements simultaneously. Users of traditional two-site EMG myoelectric devices who may have powered elbow flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, and terminal device open/close cannot operate any of these movements simultaneously. Instead, they must use an alternate signal (frequently a muscular co-contraction) to switch control between joints (also termed switch modes). Another challenge for users of myoelectric prostheses is that active range of movement may not always function reliably. It is well known that myoelectric controls may function erratically if the surface electrode contact is disrupted. As discussed earlier, this can sometimes happen if the socket fit changes as a result of changes in residual limb volume or if the residuum becomes excessively sweaty.\n\nActivities\n\nGrasp, fine motor use, dexterous activities, and handling objects The human hand has more than 30 distinct grasp (grip) patterns (Cutosky, 1989), which are sometimes grouped into 6 or more major categories based on the shape of the grasping hand. Commercially available prostheses have between 1 and 14 (Ottobock, 2016b; Steeper, 2016; Touch Bionics, 2016). However, the most commonly used single-degree-of-freedom terminal device, the split hook, has a single grasp, although there are various styles of hooks. Grip strength and speed vary widely across these devices and type of grip (Belter et al., 2014; van der Niet et al., 2013).\n\nStudies reporting the overall functionality of commercially available devices compared with limbs of intact subjects, as measured by the overall index-of-function score of the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP), show wide variation in mitigation of impairments of grasp. To date, no terminal device tested has been shown to restore function completely to all major grasp patterns. Body-powered terminal devices may be VO or VC, with some evidence that VC devices are associated with faster task performance as measured by the SHAP (Berning et al., 2014). SHAP index-of-function scores for several two-joint, single-degree-of-freedom terminal devices have been reported to be about 74 percent and 43-84 percent, respectively, compared with the functionality typical of an intact hand (Dalley et al., 2012; Luchetti et al., 2015; van der Niet et al., 2013).2 The SHAP index-of-function scores for several commercially available multiarticulating hands have been reported in multiple studies: 52-76 percent for the i-limb Hand (Dalley et al., 2012; van der Niet et al., 2013), 87-88 percent for the i-limb Pulse (van der Niet et al., 2013), and 75-89 percent for the Michelangelo hand (Luchetti et al., 2015). Other research has found that myoelectric prosthesis users had average index-of-function scores of 43-50 percent compared with an intact hand (Bouwsema et al., 2012).\n\nFew studies have directly compared the dexterity of myoelectric and body-powered terminal devices or multiarticulating and conventional myoelectric terminal devices. In one study, the functionality of a myoelectrically controlled single-degree-of-freedom terminal device was reported to be lower than that of a single-degree-of-freedom body-powered device as measured by the SHAP (Kyberd, 2011). Another study, comparing the performance of six transradial amputees using both a multiarticulating (Michelangelo) hand and a standard myoelectric hand, found better dexterity (box and blocks test and SHAP tests) using the multiarticulating hand (Luchetti et al., 2015).\n\nPartial hand amputations range from single-digit amputations to those that involve multiple digits or part of the hand itself. Although single-digit amputations typically do not result in significant functional deficits, partial hand amputations that involve multiple digits and/or the thumb, compromising prehension force and sensation, can result in significant disability. Many people with partial hand amputations lose the opposition of digits necessary for an effective grasp, particularly if the amputation involves the thumb. Restoration of grasp to persons who have lost part but not all of their hand has been particularly challenging, with little research having been conducted in this area. A single study of 10 people with partial hand amputations showed that prosthesis use improved the strength of some but not all grips and also improved self-reported difficulty in the performance of specific activities (Lifchez et al., 2005).\n\nSeveral studies have found substantially lower dexterity in users of upper-limb prostheses of all amputation levels compared with age-matched norms (Resnik and Borgia, 2012), as well as slower time to complete movements and activities (Bouwsema et al., 2010b; Cowley et al., 2016). Slower speeds are attributable, in part, to the fact that prosthesis users must perform more discrete submovements to perform basic tasks (Doeringer and Hogan, 1995; Fraser and Wing, 1981). In addition, grasping is uncoupled from reaching when one is using a prosthesis, which makes reaching for and grasping an object take longer (Blough et al., 2010; Bouwsema et al., 2012; Cowley et al., 2016).\n\nLifting, carrying, and reaching overhead Lifting and carrying objects with a prosthesis can be limited by the design restrictions of the prosthetic components, the method used to attach the prosthesis to the socket, or the socket and its suspension system. Lifting and carrying can be limited if the prosthesis hardware will not support the weight of the object, if the device detaches from the socket, or if the socket slips from the residuum. The functional envelope, or the space around the body in which the prosthesis can be used reliably, is often limited. Even when individuals with amputation have use of their own shoulder joint for reaching activities, they may be unable to use their prosthesis when reaching overhead because of the constraints of the harnessing that operates the cable. Users of myoelectric devices may also have difficulty operating their device in a full range of body positions because involuntary co-contraction of residual limb muscles that often occurs when stabilizing the limb against gravity can interfere with voluntary control of residual musculature.\n\nEffects of Multiple Impairments on Impairment Mitigation\n\nAcquired upper-limb amputations and congenital limb deficiencies are often associated with other impairments and comorbidities that affect overall function and can impact the use of prosthetic devices to mitigate impairment. The function of the upper extremities is complex and requires coordinated movements of multiple joints, visual feedback, sensation, and proprioception to accomplish even simple tasks.\n\nPersons with amputation often have comorbid injuries, such as burns, nerve damage, or muscular loss, that interfere with the skin integrity, range of motion, strength, and/or sensation of the residual limb. Weakness of the proximal arm or trunk musculature and/or pain in the proximal joints, neck, or back can make it difficult to lift the weight of the prosthetic limb or to tolerate wearing a prosthesis for long periods. Thus, even those who wish to wear an upper-limb prosthesis may be unable to do so to the extent that they desire. Comorbid injuries and conditions that affect vision, cognitive ability, or the upper extremity/trunk proximal to the limb deficiency will make using a prosthesis more challenging and will limit the impairment mitigation effects of a prosthetic device. In addition, comorbid conditions that cause limb volume fluctuations, such as diabetes or renal or cardiovascular disease, can impact a person's ability to fit comfortably and consistently in a prosthetic device.\n\nAs noted earlier, beyond the physical conditions that often accompany upper-limb deficiency, the impact of limb loss or deficiency on body image, social role, and psychological health is substantial (Gallagher et al., 2007). In addition to the body image issues discussed above, it is estimated that at least 27 percent of people with limb loss experience symptoms of depression and that the risk for developing depression is greater for people with comorbid conditions (Desmond, 2007; McKechnie and John, 2014; Perkins et al., 2012). People with traumatic amputations are also at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with prevalence rates estimated at 17-77 percent (Copuroglu et al., 2010; Tennent et al., 2014; Vincent et al., 2015).\n\nIn addition to psychological distress, upper-limb loss is frequently associated with chronic pain (Hanley et al., 2009; Kooijman et al., 2000). Several studies have found that people with upper-limb amputation report more postamputation pain relative to people with lower-limb amputation (Bosmans et al., 2010; Davidson et al., 2010). It is important to consider this high prevalence of postamputation pain, including phantom limb pain, when examining the use of prosthetic devices, as pain is a common reason why people with limb loss are not able to wear prosthetic devices successfully or restrict their use of the devices (Desmond et al., 2012).\n\nEffects of User's Age on Prosthesis Use\n\nLittle is known about the association between age and use of upper-extremity prosthetic devices, particularly as children transition to adulthood and enter the workforce. A number of studies have examined factors that affect the use of prosthetic devices in children with either congenital limb deficiencies or acquired amputation. In general, these studies have found that young children with acquired amputation are more likely to become users of upper-extremity prosthetic devices if they begin using them at a younger age (Dabaghi-Richerand et al., 2015; Meurs et al., 2006). One study of 218 children aged 2-20 years in the Netherlands found that the majority preferred the use of unaffected parts of the body to accomplish tasks (>60 percent) over adaptive devices (<48 percent) and prostheses (<9 percent) (Vasluian et al., 2013). In this study, 27 percent of children reported having difficulties with work (the majority of these were children aged 13-20, and work for them was defined as any part-time, summer, or full-time job), yet none of these children reported using adaptive or prosthetic devices for their work. The children in this study who used both adaptive devices and prostheses reported higher satisfaction with the use of adaptive devices for specific activities compared with prosthetic devices because of the former devices' dimensions, weight, adjustability, and ease of use.\n\nAnother survey conducted in Sweden (Sjoberg et al., 2014) found that a majority of adults with congenital limb deficiencies (68 percent) used assistive devices, including prosthetic devices, but there were gender differences in the types of devices used: those using body-powered prostheses were exclusively men, and women were more likely to use cosmetic prostheses. Among those with upper-limb deficiencies, the vast majority were either working or in school (93/108); however, 24 percent of people reported that their self-assessed work capacity was reduced because of their upper-limb deficiency.\n\nA qualitative focus group study of children and adolescents (aged 8-20 years) with unilateral transradial congenital limb deficiencies found that the limitations they experienced were typically environmental—related to attitudes or lack of accommodations—rather than being due to the limb deficiency itself (de Jong et al., 2012). Study participants transitioning to adulthood and thus more dependent on adults reported that they were more limited in their function relative to those who had already transitioned to independence. This finding suggests that the transition period itself is challenging for adolescents with limb deficiency, a phenomenon that has been recognized in other populations of people with disabilities (Donkervoort et al., 2009). This qualitative study also highlights that children and adolescents with upper-limb deficiency use many different and creative strategies to accomplish activities that do not necessarily rely on adaptive or prosthetic devices.\n\nProsthesis Use and Prognosis for Occupational/Educational Success\n\nAs noted earlier, congenital limb absence and acquired upper-limb amputation can significantly affect a person's ability to work. Although a number of studies have reported return-to-work rates of 50-75 percent following lower-limb amputation (Dajpratham et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2003; Schoppen et al., 2001a,b), the committee found limited data, particularly from the United States, documenting work reintegration following acquired upper-limb amputation. Several studies specifically examining return to work after upper-limb amputation have found employment rates of approximately 57-85 percent; however, none of these studies were conducted in the United States (Datta et al., 2004; Fernandez et al., 2000; Jones and Davidson, 1995; Millstein et al., 1986; Postema et al., 2016b). One of the studies found that a majority of people who returned to work changed their employment because of limitations associated with their amputation (Datta et al., 2004). Another study, conducted in the Netherlands, found that individuals with amputation were employed at lower rates (57 percent for acquired amputation, 74 percent for congenital limb absence) than their age- and sex-matched peers (82 percent) but reported similar work productivity. This study also found that prosthesis use was a predictor of employment (Postema et al., 2016b). Other studies similarly found a positive association between prosthesis use and return to work following amputation (Fernandez et al., 2000; Millstein et al., 1985, 1986). The precise relationship between prosthesis use and return to work is unclear (Fernandez et al, 2000), although some have speculated that positive attitude and motivation may contribute to both (Millstein et al., 1985).\n\nA study of people with partial hand amputation found that fewer than half were able to return to the same job, and most found prosthetic devices insufficient to meet the demands of their work, although cosmetic prostheses were important to their work success (Burger et al., 2007). While a limited sample, a recent survey of people with major limb amputation in Ireland found that 92 percent (n = 11/12) of those with upper-limb amputation experienced difficulty with employment or job seeking, even more so than people with lower-limb amputation (69 percent, n = 96) (Gallagher et al., 2011). Another European study found that 38 percent of people with upper-limb amputation required modifications to their job duties but that people with amputation reported job satisfaction similar to that of age- and gender-matched controls (van der Sluis et al., 2009). One small case series found that of 13 civilians with upper-limb amputation in the United States, 4 were able to return to work in any capacity, although none were able to return to their specific preinjury employment (Livingston et al., 1994). These findings are consistent with those of international studies, which found that upper-limb amputees typically returned to work in jobs that had fewer physical demands but required greater intellectual skills (e.g., clerical, service, managerial work) (Millstein et al., 1985). Similar findings also emerged from a study showing higher rates of return to work following upper-limb amputation in the building industry than in agriculture, presumably because agriculture offers fewer job opportunities compatible with a missing upper limb (Fernandez et al., 2000). Higher levels of employment for people with upper-limb amputation in more skilled jobs may explain the positive association found between postinjury employment and higher levels of education (Postema et al., 2016b), as well as receipt of vocational services (Millstein et al., 1985). Younger age at amputation and male sex also have been positively associated with return to work (Postema et al., 2016b).\n\nIn the United States, most of the studies examining the relationship between upper-extremity amputation and work duties were conducted in military populations. Although return-to-duty rates remain low for both upper- and lower-limb amputations, return to active duty is particularly challenging for people with upper-limb amputation (Belisle et al., 2013; Hurley et al., 2015). Roughly 75 percent of combat amputees from the global wars on terror were retired because of the amputation (Belisle et al., 2013). A recent study of all U.S. military amputations from 2001 to 2011 identified 153 people with upper-extremity loss (Tennent et al., 2014). In this population, no upper-extremity amputees were found to be fit for full duty, although 12 percent were allowed to continue on active duty (Tennent et al., 2014). Earlier studies had found higher return-to-duty rates for upper-limb amputees (17-22 percent), only slightly lower than the rates for lower-limb amputees (18-25 percent) (Stinner et al., 2010). Although military amputees are a unique population, and these findings may not be applicable to the general civilian population with upper-extremity amputation, they highlight the difficulties associated with return to work following upper-extremity loss. Further, upper-extremity amputees were more likely than lower-extremity amputees to experience PTSD and comorbid nerve injuries that impacted function (Tennent et al., 2014).\n\nThere are many reasons why employment may be difficult after upper-limb amputation, including limited ability to perform tasks repetitively (either with or without a prosthesis). One study found that bilateral amputees were less successful in returning to work relative to unilateral amputees (Millstein et al., 1985). Associated musculoskeletal complaints, including overuse injuries of the remaining limb, and pain also are negatively associated with return to work (Millstein et al, 1985; Postema et al., 2016b), and the impact of limb loss on psychological health, body image, and social role may negatively affect return to work as well (Saradjian et al., 2008). Depending on the type of work, each of these issues may impact one's ability to perform repetitive tasks involving the upper extremities and consequently, the quality of work and work productivity (Postema et al., 2016b). In addition, professions in which interactions with the public or social interactions are integral to job function may be more challenging for people who experience perceived social stigma or public self-consciousness due to their upper-limb loss (Saradjian et al., 2008).\n\nEmployment has been associated with decreased rejection rates of upper-limb prosthetics (Postema et al., 2016b), although this association depends in part on the level of amputation. Studies suggest greater employment among individuals with transradial relative to transhumeral amputations (Fernandez et al., 2000; Millstein et al., 1985), presumably because retention of one's elbow helps with carrying out work-related tasks (Fernandez et al., 2000). Some studies suggest that people with more proximal amputations use prostheses primarily for cosmesis while at work, whereas people with transradial amputations use prostheses for functional activities, and people with partial hand amputations more frequently choose not to use such devices at all (Burger et al., 2007; Postema et al., 2016b).\n\nIn summary, although research in the United States is lacking, international studies suggest that male sex, younger age, medium or high level of education, prosthesis use, good general health (fewer comorbidities), and positive attitude are predictors of work participation among upper-limb amputees (Fernandez et al., 2000; Millstein et al., 1985; 1986; Postema et al., 2016b; Raichle et al., 2008). Importantly, issues of prosthesis reliability and the need for repair also impact device use in the work environment and may contribute to work interruptions.\n\nProsthetic Training\n\nThe average amount of time needed to train patients with upper-limb amputation varies by level of amputation, type of device, and such other factors as the presence of comorbid conditions. The optimal frequency of training visits, the intensity and duration of training, and the time needed to acclimate fully to a new prosthesis have not been studied. Some have suggested that persons with transradial amputation require, on average, 3-5 weeks of training (Dakpa and Heger, 1997); others have suggested that 5 hours of training is sufficient for people with transradial amputation, 10 hours for those with transhumeral amputation, and 12-20 hours for those with bilateral amputation (Atkins, 2004); and still others have suggested that gaining proficiency can require from a few days to several months (Johnson and Mansfield, 2014). Although the committee suspects that skills in prosthesis use may improve over time, with greater experience, no studies evaluating the length of time required to become a fully proficient, “expert” prosthesis user could be found. Although some detailed protocols are available in the professional and scientific literature (Atkins, 2004; Resnik et al., 2014c; Smurr et al., 2008), few studies have examined the effectiveness of specific approaches to prosthetic training. Given the small numbers of upper-limb amputees, most of these studies were conducted with able-bodied participants instead (Bouwsema et al., 2008, 2010a, 2014; Clingman and Pidcoe, 2014; Lake, 1997). One such study demonstrated that those with 8 hours of training on a prosthesis simulator had better performance than those who were not trained (Lake, 1997).\n\nThe current evidence-based guidelines state that prosthetic training should include the following components: education, controls training, and functional training (Management of Upper Extremity Amputation Rehabilitation Working Group, 2014). Education includes instruction in putting on and taking off the prosthesis, caring for the residual limb, caring for and understanding the components of the prosthesis, and safely using the device. Generally speaking, most people require an adjustment period to acclimate to wearing a prosthesis and to learn to use it before they can wear the device full-time or for extended periods. Users need to acclimate to wearing a prosthesis through a graduated wear schedule (Management of Upper Extremity Amputation Rehabilitation Working Group, 2014), and the fit and function of the device must be reassessed periodically during prosthetic training. Prosthetic fit (i.e., the socket and harnessing) may need to be modified by the prosthetist to address such issues as pain in the residuum, skin breakdown, or changes in socket fit and comfort.\n\nControls training teaches the patient how to operate each aspect of the prosthesis while avoiding unnecessary compensatory movements and using good body mechanics. Users of body-powered devices must learn the movements needed to operate the harness and to position any movable joints (e.g., wrist rotators, elbow) manually, while users of myoelectric devices must learn to isolate and control specific muscles and, in some instances, switch between modes of control. Several studies of able-bodied subjects have examined the content of prosthetic controls training and found that use of a myoelectric trainer improved myoelectric signal control (Clingman and Pidcoe, 2014). However, a recent study of able-bodied subjects found no differences in skill acquisition among three approaches to myoelectric controls training: use of a prosthesis simulator, a virtual prosthesis on a computer screen, or an isolated prosthetic hand (Bouwsema et al., 2010a). Nevertheless, use of a virtual trainer has become a widely accepted method of myoelectric controls training (Johnson and Mansfield, 2014).\n\nControls training typically includes repetitive drills to enable the user to practice specific prosthesis actions and commonly used movements, such as grasp and release of objects. Preliminary evidence gathered on able-bodied subjects suggests that the structure of the training approach (blocked practice versus random practice of skills) does not impact the rate of acquisition of prosthetic skills (Bouwsema et al., 2008). A study of four approaches to grasp training for users of myoelectric prostheses recommends that training programs begin with indirect grasping tasks but ultimately emphasize fine motor tasks (Bouwsema et al., 2014).\n\nFunctional skills training is designed to help individuals integrate use of their prostheses into their everyday tasks and to teach them strategies for maximizing their functional abilities. Because most prostheses lack movable wrists and have limited grasp positions, functional training often focuses on teaching prepositioning of the device in a functional position prior to utilization. Functional training typically progresses from using the prosthesis in unilateral activities to engaging it during bimanual activities. Ultimately, training should advance to engagement in community activities to increase the user's confidence in utilizing the device in public and in real-world situations (Johnson and Mansfield, 2014).\n\nAccess to and Availability of Devices\n\nData are scarce on the prevalence of use or incidence of prescription of upper-limb prostheses across the United States, largely because no single nationally representative source of data contains this information. Thus, most studies on the prevalence of use of these devices, as well as the rates of prosthetic prescription and repair, have used self-report surveys. Results of such surveys suggest that persons with major upper-limb amputation receive a new device every 1-5 years (Blough et al., 2010; MacKenzie et al., 2007).\n\nA recent, large study on prosthesis prescription patterns in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) used 10 years of data from the VHA's National Prosthetic Patient Database to calculate annual prescription and repair rates by level of amputation and type of device (Etter et al., 2014). The rate of prescription of upper-limb prostheses was 0.20/year for persons with shoulder-level amputation, 0.27/year for those with transhumeral amputation, and 0.26/year for those with transradial amputation (Etter et al., 2014). These data suggest that overall, veterans with major upper-limb amputation received a new prosthesis once every 3.6 years. The prescription rate for myoelectric devices, however, was 0.38/year compared with 0.23/year for body-powered devices, indicating that the former devices were being prescribed or replaced more frequently than the latter. Repair rates varied by level of amputation, with the least frequent repairs provided for persons with shoulder-level amputation (0.02/year) and more frequent repairs for those with transhumeral and transradial amputations (0.26/year and 0.21/year, respectively). Furthermore, compared with veterans over age 65, those under age 65 had higher incidence rates of both prescription of new devices and repair of existing devices. The results of this study are limited to the prescription and repair patterns within the VHA and likely are not generalizable beyond that system of care.\n\nIt should be noted that issues with the reliability of a prosthesis may impact vocational use. Particularly with myoelectric devices, which need more frequent repairs/replacement, not having a back-up device can be a barrier to successful participation at work.\n\nAs described in Appendix C and Chapter 3, the committee examined data for a 5 percent random sample of beneficiaries from the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment (DME) files for the years 2013-2014 to gain information on the frequency with which UEPs were prescribed within the 20- to 67-year-old population of beneficiaries. Although the population represented in the Medicare data is not necessarily representative of the overall population using UEPs, these data were available to the committee. The 5 percent sample is commonly used in research as the 100 percent dataset is so large that its use for research purposes is not feasible. Because of the underrepresentation of the 20- to 67-year-old cohort in Medicare claims data and the relatively low frequency of UEP claims, the 5 percent sample yielded a small study sample, which limited the presentation of granular information based on individual-level characteristics. Use of a 20 percent random sample and/or more years of data would improve future analyses. The Medicare DME data were linked to data from the Master Beneficiary files to obtain information on the demographic and clinical characteristics of device recipients. (See Appendix C for a detailed description of methods.) The committee identified all upper-limb prostheses provided by Medicare to persons aged 20-67 and then categorized the types of devices provided, as well as the characteristics of device recipients. Given the small sample size (fewer than 150 persons) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS's) restrictions on reporting values for categories of 20 or fewer persons, the analyses reported here show proportions rather than absolute values.\n\nOf the prosthetic components and devices provided to the 5 percent random sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 20 to 67 in 2013, 43 percent were classified as body-powered, 27.6 percent as myoelectric, and the remainder as other (see ). shows the demographic characteristics of those Medicare recipients who received a device, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Most recipients were under age 65, suggesting that these were individuals with long-term disability. The majority of recipients were male (58.2 percent) and white (68.4 percent). shows the distribution of amputation diagnoses among this sample. More than half (54.3 percent) had amputation at the transradial level; 23.9 percent had amputation at the transhumeral level; almost 20 percent had unspecified amputation diagnoses; and only 2.2 percent had partial hand amputation.\n\nTABLE 4-1\n\nUpper-Limb Prostheses Provided to Beneficiaries by Type.\n\nTABLE 4-2\n\nDemographic Characteristics of Recipients of Upper-Limb Prostheses.\n\nTABLE 4-3\n\nEstimated Percentage of Upper-Limb Prosthetic Devices by Amputation Category.\n\nMedicare and most state Medicaid agencies and private insurance companies utilize the CMS DME, Prosthetics/Orthotics, and Supplies fee schedules for all procedure codes. In contrast with most medical care, time typically is not billed separately. Instead, the billing of a code (L–code in the case of prosthetic devices) is assumed to include the time needed to evaluate, fit, deliver, and follow up on the given device. Later modifications, adjustments, and repairs past the warranty period may be billed as repair time and parts. When devices and components are provided for patients through private payment or workers' compensation insurance, payment can vary widely based on the selected codes and provider customary fee schedules, which may or may not cover the cost of the components. Medicare fee schedules are shown in ; however, they may not be representative of practice outside of Medicare. The existence of a device-specific code does not guarantee coverage, which, depending on the source of coverage, may require preauthorization or predetermination prior to delivery. Additionally, some recommended items may be noncoded, noncovered items to which no specific fee has been assigned.\n\nMedicare does not provide preauthorization and instead may later request documentation to justify medical necessity. If the claim of medical necessity is not met, a claim will not be paid to a provider. In some situations, the provider anticipates that a device may be determined not medically necessary and therefore may be denied, and so they may ask a patient to sign an advance beneficiary notice (ABN). The ABN allows the patient to make an informed decision about whether to receive an item or service that may be determined noncoverable by Medicare and to accept financial responsibility should that be the case. An example is a device or parts “not otherwise specified” (code L7499), which includes any new technology. The challenge in these cases is that the new technology may be very expensive (>$10,000). A clinical facility, especially a smaller one that is less able to absorb the cost of an unpaid device or less confident in the justification for a complex upper-limb device, may be very concerned about assuming the risk of purchasing and delivering such an item for which payment is not assured. Likewise, a patient may be very hesitant to accept financial responsibility in case Medicare does not. In addition, Medicare, as well as other insurance providers, requires a copayment for service, which may represent a significant financial burden for individuals without secondary insurance coverage.\n\nThe committee recognizes that limited or lack of evidence about the impact of upper-limb loss, prosthesis use, and amputation rehabilitation on activity and participation may affect decisions by funding sources about which devices and services to cover. Such information on outcomes could contribute to studies on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of different types of prostheses and help inform the development of rational resource utilization, including use by insurers and other funding sources to inform their coverage decisions.\n\nDistribution of Experienced and Knowledgeable Clinicians\n\nIt is widely recognized among those who work frequently with individuals with upper-limb amputation that this population is best served by knowledgeable, trained clinical providers who work together as a team to provide amputation care. Yet, while limited data are available on utilization of rehabilitation services in the U.S. population, one study examining practice patterns found that only 27 percent of the people who had a unilateral amputation and used a prosthesis had received training from an occupational or a physical therapist, and only 22 percent had received more than 10 hours of training from either a therapist or a prosthetist (Kestner, 2006).\n\nRequirements for becoming a certified prosthetist/orthotist have evolved to an entry-level master's degree from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. Students receive training in upper- and lower-limb prosthetic fittings. To achieve certification for each discipline, all students must also complete a 1-year residency (per discipline) working under a certified clinician at an American Board for Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics (ABC)-accredited residency location, followed by written and practical qualifying exams. The experience the student receives in upper-limb fittings will depend on the patients seen at the residency facility. Only 15 states have licensure for prosthetics and orthotics (ABC, 2017b). Those that do typically rely on the ABC certification examination as a requirement. There are approximately 14,000 ABC-certified clinicians (prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists) (ABC, 2017a).\n\nProsthesis users receive training from occupational or physical therapists, depending on the clinical environment and team. Both occupational and physical therapy training programs require training in upper-limb prosthetics as part of the accreditation process. However, there are no mandates regarding the extent or content of this training.\n\nGiven the relative rarity and geographic dispersion of persons with upper-limb amputation in the United States, it is difficult for physicians, prosthetists, and therapists to acquire expertise in working with this population. Although limited data on the workforce are available, a recent survey of ABC members found that only 150 of 1,145 prosthetist members (13 percent) would consider fitting a patient with a UEP (Stark, 2016). Nearly 72 percent of respondents to a survey of upper-limb practitioners categorized themselves as novices in upper-extremity prosthetics and indicated that they treated an average of three such patients per year. The 26.2 percent who considered themselves experts in the field treated an average of 25 such patients per year. Many prosthetists endorsed the idea that the fitting process for patients with upper-limb amputation is particularly complex and that few prosthetists are being educated in this practice specialty. The areas of greatest challenge in upper-limb prosthetics were identified as knowledge of componentry, patient training, patient variation, and functional adjustment.\n\nGiven the scarcity of clinicians, including physicians, prosthetists, and occupational therapists, who are specialists in caring for persons with upper-limb amputation, a skilled team approach to care may not be widely available across the United States. Because the typical clinician has minimal education specific to upper-limb amputation and may see very few of these patients over the course of his or her career (Alley, 2004), most have little opportunity to develop expertise with this patient population (Stark, 2016). In addition to having limited experience in prosthetic fitting, clinicians would also have limited experience in justifying the need for and benefits of certain devices to insurers, which also could negatively impact delivery and outcomes. Because of their lack of expertise, many prosthetists rely on consultations with upper-limb experts to treat their patients. Some clinicians and patients must travel long distances to deliver or receive care. This necessity may delay care and negatively impact outcomes (Stark, 2016).\n\nIn 2007, the VHA launched an Amputation System of Care (ASoC) to improve access to expertise and specialized training for veterans with amputation (VA, 2016). Seven geographically dispersed VHA medical centers were designated as Regional Amputation Care Centers (RACs). RACs provide interdisciplinary care and prosthetic fabrication facilities, and they serve as resources to other VHA medical centers by offering telerehabilitation, consultation, and education. In addition, 18 VHA sites were designated Polytrauma/Amputation Network Sites (PANS), which offer inpatient and outpatient amputation rehabilitation services and have prosthetic labs. The remaining VHA medical centers were designated Amputation Care Centers. These centers have interdisciplinary amputation care teams but may lack the resources of RACs or PANS; or they may be designated amputation points of contact for assessment and refer patients to sites with requisite resources. The goal of the ASoC is to offer a coordinated system of high-quality, multidisciplinary, lifelong care that can provide the “most advanced and appropriate prosthetic components to Veterans across the system of care regardless of geographic location” (VA, 2012)."
