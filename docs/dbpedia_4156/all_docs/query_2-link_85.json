        "text": "Helps History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe name Helps came to England with the ancestors of the Helps family in the Norman Conquest of 1066. It comes from the Old English personal name Helps, which is thought to be a shortened form of a longer name such as Helpric, or some other name with the first element help, meaning aid or assist. It is also possible that the name is of metronymic descent and derives from the Old Norse female personal name Hialp. 1\n\nEvidence for both of these theories exists, but time has confused the two derivations and etymologists now disagree on which is appropriate in any given instance.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Helps family\n\nThe surname Helps was first found in Lincolnshire where Helpe Arbalistarius was the first recording in the Pipe Rolls of 1181. Walter Help was later listed in Northumberland in 1230. Over one hundred years later, Gilbert Helpe was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Suffol in 1327. 1\n\nInterestingly, the same author notes that Simon Helpusgod who was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1296, presumably derived his name from 'may God help us.\" 1\n\nTurning back the clock for a moment, one author presumes that name was actually Norman as he notes that the Magni Rotuli Scaccarii Normanniae lists Hugo de Helpe, Normandy, 1180-95. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Helps family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Helps research. Another 57 words (4 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Helps History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nHelps Spelling Variations\n\nAnglo-Norman names tend to be marked by an enormous number of spelling variations. This is largely due to the fact that Old and Middle English lacked any spelling rules when Norman French was introduced in the 11th century. The languages of the English courts at that time were French and Latin. These various languages mixed quite freely in the evolving social milieu. The final element of this mix is that medieval scribes spelled words according to their sounds rather than any definite rules, so a name was often spelled in as many different ways as the number of documents it appeared in. The name was spelled Helps, Help and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Helps family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nSir Arthur Helps of Gloucester\n\nLoading...\n\nHelps migration to the United States +\n\nBecause of the political and religious discontent in England, families began to migrate abroad in enormous numbers. Faced with persecution and starvation at home, the open frontiers and generally less oppressive social environment of the New World seemed tantalizing indeed to many English people. The trip was difficult, and not all made it unscathed, but many of those who did get to Canada and the United States made important contributions to the young nations in which they settled. Some of the first North American settlers with Helps name or one of its variants:\n\nHelps Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nJacob Helps, who settled in Philadelphia in 1753\n\nHelps Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nAlexander Helps, who settled in Passamaquodey in Maine in 1823\n\nHelps migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers. Early immigrants include:\n\nHelps Settlers in Australia in the 19th Century\n\nMiss Mary Ann Helps who was convicted in Middlesex, England for 7 years, transported aboard the \"Brothers\" on 20th November 1823, arriving in New South Wales, Australia and Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) 3\n\nMr. William Helps, English convict who was convicted in Bristol, England for 7 years, transported aboard the \"Burrell\" on 22nd July 1830, arriving in New South Wales 4\n\nMr. Baynham Helps, (William, Holliday), English convict who was convicted in Wiltshire, England for life for stealing, transported aboard the \"Clyde\" on 20th August 1830, arriving in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) 5\n\nStephen Helps, aged 21, who arrived in Adelaide, Australia aboard the ship \"Duke Of Wellington\" in 1849 6\n\nMartha Helps, aged 24, who arrived in Adelaide, Australia aboard the ship \"Duke Of Wellington\" in 1849 6\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Auxilia auxilliis\n\nMotto Translation: Assistance to help\n\nCitations +\n\nReaney, P.H and R.M.
