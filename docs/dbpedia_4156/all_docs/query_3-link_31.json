        "text": "Powell, OH —Just in time for Halloween, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, along with Versiti Blood Center of Ohio is teaming up with a zombie horde to raise awareness about the need for lifesaving blood donations.\n\nAs an official Zoo and ZOMBIEzi Bay partner, Versiti invites you give blood to ensure a safe and stable supply of blood year-round. Don’t be alarmed if a zombie phlebotomists is helping you with your donation or if you see some fan favorite ZOMBIEzi actors make an appearance. We’re told they’re harmless.\n\nThe blood drive will take place at the Zoo’s Africa Event Center located off the main parking lot, and appointments are available to book online now from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. To thank donors for their important contribution that helps to make a difference for others, all donors will receive a Good Any Day ticket to ZOMBIEzi Bay and a Versiti 1-of-a-kind bottle koozie with opener, while supplies last.\n\nAnyone 17 years or older who is in general good health and meets eligibility requirements is encouraged to donate blood. Parental consent is required for 16-year-olds to donate. Appointments are preferred to ensure a quick and convenient donation, but walk-in donors are also welcome. The entire process takes about an hour. Donors should bring a photo ID that includes their birth date.\n\nBlood is precious and perishable, and the need for blood donors is vital. Every 2 seconds, someone in the United States is in need of blood. By donating blood, you are helping to save up to three lives!\n\nVersiti is also a supporting partner of ZOMBIEzi Bay for the 2021-2024 season.
