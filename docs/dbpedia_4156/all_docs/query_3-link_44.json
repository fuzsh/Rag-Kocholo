These are the absolute best: üìö Jade City (Fonda Lee): There simply isn‚Äôt enough hype around this trilogy, and I‚Äôm not ok with it. ‚ÄòJade City‚Äô is an Asian-inspired urban fantasy set in a world where jade confers great strength and powers to the select few who can wear it without losing their minds. I was so ridiculously invested in all the main characters and their messy family dynamics. The book is also really fast-paced and filled with action, setbacks, plot twists, and one of the richest world buildings I‚Äôve ever seen. This month, I also finished book 2, ‚ÄòJade War‚Äô, and I‚Äôm now holding back on starting the 3rd and final installment as I don‚Äôt want this series to end. Ever. But more about this later. üìö Several People Are Typing (Calvin Kasulke): Would you read a novel written entirely through Slack messages? It took me a while to get used to the format, but I burned through this book. This is an unapologetic satire on the corporate world (with a few speculative elements), and in my opinion, it perfectly captures its essence. It was a fun and relatable read, and I warmly recommend this. FYI, something questionable happens towards the end of the story, but I was able to get past it given the absurdist nature of the novel‚Äìthis is an exception though. üìö The Shards (Bret Easton Ellis): From the author of ‚ÄòAmerican Psycho‚Äô, here‚Äôs another unhinged and blood-soaked ride. An upper-class teenager and his friends navigate LA in the ‚Äò80s while a serial killer is on a rampage. This book is a journey to hell made of substance abuse, lies, fever dreams, and mounting paranoia. I‚Äôm very hard to scare, but there were three particular scenes in this book that creeped the hell out of me. Discomforting and nightmare-inducing. Just perfect. üìö Listen For The Lie (Amy Tintera): I went into this book expecting a beach read, which it was to a certain degree, but the story turned out to be much more than a simple small-town murder mystery. This book deals with the brutality of domestic violence, victim blaming, and the whole ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs a good guy‚Äù nonsense, depicting these realities in all of their nastiness. I enjoyed this book, but as a woman, it was tough to digest. üìö The Jasmine Throne (Tasha Suri): Also mentioned in my previous LGBTQ+ recs (https://lnkd.in/d-GXUJen) this is an accessible Indian-inspired high fantasy. As a die-hard fantasy reader, I know how challenging it is to find a high fantasy novel with multiple POVs, intricate worldbuilding, a complex magic system, and a gripping tale that keeps you turning the pages without having you feel overwhelmed or confused. This book was such a refreshing and enjoyable read.

Particularly, the final book, Death's End, left me in awe. This trilogy isn't just a hard science fiction masterpiece; it's a profound exploration of humanity, technology, and the universe. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking read. Here are three key lessons we can learn from this series, especially in the context of business: 1. Embrace the Unknown: üåå Just as the characters navigate the vast uncertainties of the cosmos, businesses must be prepared to venture into the unknown, embracing innovation and adapting to ever-changing environments. 2. Strategic Foresight: üî≠ The trilogy's intricate plot highlights the importance of long-term planning and strategic foresight. Businesses, too, must look beyond immediate gains and plan for sustainable success in the future. 3. Collaboration is Key: ü§ù In facing existential threats, the series demonstrates the power of collaboration. In business, fostering strong partnerships and working together can drive unparalleled success and innovation. However, I was very disappointed with the Netflix adaptation. The world in the books is way bigger and more intricate. Liu Cixin's creativity and ability to weave complex themes into a compelling narrative is nothing short of astonishing. If you haven't read it yet, add it to your list! üìö‚ú® https://lnkd.in/e6YA7Auq #ThreeBodyTrilogy #LiuCixin #SciFi #Innovation #BusinessStrategy #Collaboration #MustRead #NetflixDisappointment\n\nThere really is only one thing happening here...

If you have ever watched Arnold outside of movies, especially when it comes to motivation and life lessons, he has a great outlook on life. This book is the culmination of life of lessons he has learned along the way. Each of the seven tools he breaks down in depth on how they have helped him an multiple ways, how they can be applied in life, and takes time to credit the individuals who inspired/taught him these lessons along the way. He understands the man he has become is a culmination of the people who inspired him, motivated him, taught him, and shared with him. In spite of what manny people may think, Arnold is not a self-made man and takes the time to appreciate those who helped sculpt him into the athlete, the actor, the governor, and the humanitarian he has become. The one thing he does take credit for is his willingness to follow his dreams and make them reality. He had the internal drive and determination to go after what he wanted. And he didn't care who believed in him or not. He never compromised on his dreams. Too many people compromise their dreams. They settle for the status quo, or what life has dealt them. This book inspires you to look past that. Do what makes you happy no matter what the outside world thinks. Geniuses are crazy, until what they have envisioned comes to fruition. Then, they are applauded and looked up to. No one pays attention to the hundreds and thousands of setback that they suffered before the breakthrough. Failure is a tool for learning. We all fail. Arnold failed. But the failures lead to the solutions. Use failures as stepping stones, not weights that hold you down. Side note: I listed to this book on audible. Listening to book counts as reading. It is especially good when the author reads. And really good when that person has a fantastic accent like Schwarzenegger!\n\nBestsellersworld.com has posted a review for The Jake Matthews Saga: Ascension by Josiah Akatab. Reviewed by Lisa Brown-Gilbert A winning amalgamation of fantasy, science fiction, action, and adventure, author Josiah Akhtab‚Äôs, Jake Mathews Saga: Ascension, brings to life the evolution of a superhero of legendary proportions. As book one of an intended series, this work makes for a great introduction to the imaginative world characters and creatures that inhabit this epic tale. At the story‚Äôs outset, central character Jake Matthews comes into focus, He is young, and intensely intelligent. Starting out he is a seemingly bored teenager, and at fourteen years old has no real direction nor believes he has a true purpose in life. And to top it all off he is blind. In fact, he has a type of blindness called eagle-eyed blindness, which when applied within the paradigm of this saga means he sees shadows. But much to his credit his visual impairment does not seem to hamper his existence as much as it would others. As it turns out his other senses are amplified, as well as burgeoning ones such as the ability to detect electromagnetic fields, giving him the ability to maneuver through life as a blind person with exceptional prowess. And, little does Jake know, he has a destiny that is much bigger and more important than he could ever realize. Meanwhile, is a story abundant with adventure as Jake finds himself transported to the unreal world of Figueroa located in the eighth dimension. There he comes to learn of his true destiny and that he does have a true purpose in life. As Jake trains he grows in super-powered skills overcoming the many challenges on the path to his destiny. Defeating many opponents along the way, he soon proves a worthy opponent to some and a hero to many. Ultimately, the scope of this story expands and entangles two worlds; the fantastical world of Figueroa where he grows as a young man, a hero and becomes the ruler, and earth, where he is also destined to be a hero of epic proportions. Altogether, Jake Matthews Saga: Ascension by author, Josiah Akhtab was an overall enjoyment to read. I found this to be an engaging fantasy-based coming-of-age novel. From the story‚Äôs outset, I was engaged by this well told story brimming with plenty of action‚Äìpacked super-powered fighting scenes, multi-dimensional heroics, and fantastical adventures set in intriguing worlds. For me, this book turned out to be a worthwhile read that I would definitely recommend especially to readers intrigued by fantasy and science fiction sagas.\n\nHey, I am Domenic, delving into Abby Jimenez's trilogy comprising ‚ÄúThe Friend Zone,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Happy Ever After Playlist,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Too Short,‚Äù it is evident that these novels offer a delightful blend of humor, romance, and emotional depth.

Each book in the trilogy seems to build upon the themes of love, self-discovery, and the complexities of modern relationships, providing a nuanced exploration of life's twists and turns. One of my favorite phrases from Abby Jimenez's trilogy is from \"The Happy Ever After Playlist\": \"And in this moment, I realize that everything is going to be okay. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day, the sun will come out, and we'll try again.\" This line encapsulates the trilogy's underlying message of hope, resilience, and the belief that brighter days lie ahead even in the face of adversity. Another standout phrase is from \"Life‚Äôs Too Short\": \"Life isn't always about a happy ending. It's about the moments that led to that happy ending.\" This quote resonates with me as it emphasizes the significance of the journey, the growth experienced along the way, and the beauty found in the imperfect yet meaningful moments that shape our lives. In APA style, these favorite phrases would be cited as: Jimenez, A. (Year of publication). \"And in this moment, I realize that everything is going to be okay.
