        "text": "LAS VEGAS -- Single-file racing? We saw plenty of it in Daytona, but the racing was a lot better at Rockingham. Not tremendous like one of my producers Don Schick seems to think, but things were more racey at the Rock. This weekend, we all have our fingers crossed for more side-by-side racing in Las Vegas. Hopefully, the only follow-the-leader type battles we will see all weekend were passengers racing down the ramp to board our flight to Las Vegas. I never understood that deal anyway. I mean, you have an assigned seat, it's not musical chairs. Then again, have you traveled lately?\n\nThe smart money may be on Roush Racing, but Bobby Labonte is another good bet to win.\n\nThe airport can be like Bristol's night race, with ticked off people glad to spin you out for an emergency exit seat, or a chance to upgrade to first class. However, the term \"bumping\" in the airline business is either really good or devastating. You can be bumped up to first class, or bumped right off the flight due to overselling.\n\nBy the way, have you read my compadre Bill Weber's column yet? If not, quickly jump back to his column, then come back here and read on. I'll wait.\n\nOK, so the RPM 2Night and NASCAR 2Day crews hadn't even pulled away from the gate when I hung our fearless leader and wordsmith Mr. Weber out of the draft -- that's racing terminology, found right next to \"bump and run\" in the racing dictionary. Originally, he and I were in Row 8, which is right in front of emergency exit row. Now, getting one of those six exit row seats in coach is like hitting blackjack in Las Vegas. Getting a seat in front of those six, however, is like being dealt a \"6\" when hitting \"16.\" Busted! Those seats don't recline, no matter how the reservations girl says in a very nice way, \"they do partially recline\". I quickly found out that \"partially\" means when you sit in that seat, it reclines an eighth-of-an-inch when your body weight pushes against the seat's back. Oh, but the luck every driver will need Sunday in Las Vegas came early for me. I was upgraded to a plush and roomy first class seat. Weber? He was stuck in 8F. He wrote his column in coach, while I typed my weekly ramblings in 1D. (Part of the perks in first class is you get to eat and drink basically anything you want ... read that as champagne for me.) Oh, I sent back a roll of sweetarts to Weber and producer Pam Surbaugh. Who says I don't have a heart? By the way, the movie was horrible. Glad I didn't pay $5 for the headset. But then again, I am in first class, they give them to you for free. First class is how you would describe Joe Gibbs Racing over the past nine months. (That's what we call a segue in TV.) Since Bobby Labonte scored his first win of 1999 -- a romp at Dover -- the Gibbs Boys have shown impressive chemistry, mirroring each other in work ethic, desire, and passion for success. The two-car Gibbs team of of Labonte and Tony Stewart has won nine of the past 25 Winston Cup races through Labonte's victory last week at Rockingham. In those nine victories, the No. 18 and 20 teams have proven that success breeds success. When one car ran well, its sister car wasn't too far behind. When one team struggled, both cars seemed paired together, trying to claw their way up the speed chart. In the nine wins, the car that didn't win finished fourth or better in eight of those races.\n\nTHE BETTING LINE Jeff Burton 7-2 Mark Martin 4-1 Rusty Wallace 5-1 Jeff Gordon 6-1 Dale Jarrett 8-1 Bobby Labonte 8-1 Dale Earnhardt 10-1 Tony Stewart 12-1 Ward Burton 15-1 Dale Earhardt Jr. 30-1 Matt Kenseth 40-1 Darrell Waltrip 200-1\n\nCourtesy of America's Line\n\nI brought that stat up to the No. 18's crew chief, Jimmy Makar, earlier this week. When I rattled of the numbers, he was quiet for a couple seconds and then responded. \"Wow, really? That's cool. I had never heard those numbers before,\" Makar said. \"That is a good example of how both teams work together with our 'one team, two-car effort.' To be honest, that's how it has to work for a two-car team to be truly successful.\"\n\nBefore the summer of '98, the No. 18 team's flat-track success was much like Weber's tray table in Row 8 -- a little lopsided and broken. The luck changed during a test session at the Brickyard when Labonte's team hit upon something in the chassis area. (If you read Weber's column, his luck never changed Wednesday).\n\nFlat-track frustration quickly came to an end. Labonte finished second and third in the last two visits to Indy; swept both Pocono races last year; and the No. 20 and No. 18 cars were 1-2 at Homestead. Now for my list this week. It comes straight off the Vegas tout boards. The early Vegas odds-makers have Jeff Burton listed as the favorite, with Labonte at 8-1 and Stewart at 12-1. The \"wise guys\" obviously haven't been following the \"good ol' boys.\" Sure the Roush Fords have taken the first two Las Vegas races -- Mark Martin in 1998 and Burton last year. But Ward Burton, who just happens to drive a Pontiac, was close behind his brother last year. And I think the Grand Prixs will be very stout Sunday even though a Ford led Las Vegas testing in January.\n\nSo how will, or should I say would, I lay down my money? I'd first look to see who were the flat-track masters in '99, or at least ran well in Vegas in the past. Then I'd put my money on the following drivers.\n\nOdds-makers have Burton at 7-2. He'll drive a Roush Ford. And Burton's up for the \"No Bull 5\" $1 million bonus. In eleven past \"No Bull 5\" events, seven times the big money has been handed out. 7-11 ... we're in Vegas .... hummmm. Numerology anyone? We already talked about Labonte's flat track prowess, and he brought his winning Homestead car to Vegas. I like his value at 8-1. We know the older Burton finished second to his brother in last year's race. It marked the first of three runner-up finishes to Jeff 1999. He's looked good already in 2000, so he wouldn't be a bad bet to pick up career win No. 2 this week. Stewart should be strong at Vegas. Then again, where is the No. 20 not strong? Dark horses? Well, there could be the two out of the Dale Earnhardt Inc., stable -- Dale Jr. and Steve Park. Both are on the board at 30-1. By the way, Little E had a very successful Vegas test session. Joining Burton in the \"No Bull 5\" chase are Dale Jarrett, Bill Elliott, Rusty Wallace and Martin. Remember these five from Daytona? In all honesty, picking a winner at Las Vegas Motor Speedway is harder than rolling dice on the strip -- unless you're Benny Parsons, a former Winston Cup Champion and champion dice thrower. I really have a better chance of doubling down on an ace than picking a winner on Sunday. However, anyone can hit something if they throw a dart in the dark long enough. So let's roll the dice: Labonte, the Burtons, Stewart, and Martin. That's my top five. The top Chevrolet could be Dale Earnhardt again. The 3 car was second last week in Rockingham and Earnhardt returns to the desert with the car he tested here in January. It's a sister car to his runner-up mount at the Rock, which didn't make the trip to Vegas after being tested by NASCAR in the wind tunnel this week. By the way, I wonder if Weber got peanuts in coach?\n\nALSO SEE\n\nAUDIO/VIDEO\n\nBill Weber checks in from the Las Vegas strip to preview this week's races.\n\nRealVideo: |"
