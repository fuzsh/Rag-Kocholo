        "text": "By Rhonda Beck September 21, 2022\n\nI usually don’t start an article with an apology. But this article was meant to come out at the end of May or in early June after I had talked with several area crate late model drivers about their success at The Dirt Track at Charlotte. But then I went to Eldora Speedway for The Dream 100 and was also asked to help do interviews and writing for the program for the 50th Anniversary of the Shrine 100 at Carolina Speedway on August 12, 2022. After that, I took a trip to see relatives in Wisconsin (which I hadn’t done since before covid hit). Then I drove back through the Midwest and stopped in Ohio to cover the conclusion of The Dream 100 and The World 100 at Eldora Speedway this month.\n\nI want to thank those drivers who spoke with me in May. They were the top three finishers in the Mid-East Series crate late model races during the XR Super Series competition in May at The Dirt Track at Charlotte in Concord, N.C. They include the Mid-East 604 winner Dillon Brown, second place-finisher Jeremy Steele and third-place finisher Ethan Wilson on May 14, 2022. On the Mid-East 602 side, Baron McDowell won the first race on May 11, 2022 followed by Jameson McBride in second and Preston Blalock in third. Then Preston Blalock won the Colossal 100 race on May 12, 2022 followed by Baron McDowell in second and Jamison McBride in third.\n\nSince May, many of these drivers have gone on to get more wins and even run in some super late model races. Some of them will be racing September 23-24th in the FASTRAK World Championships at Virginia Motor Speedway as well as in other end of the season races with the Mid-East and other series. Here were their interviews from May 2022:\n\nBaron McDowell, Mid-East 602 Colossal 100 Winner on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 and 2nd place finisher in the 602 race on May 12, 2022 at The Dirt Track at Charlotte, #14, Fountain Inn, S.C.\n\nRB: Congratulations. You won at the Dirt Track at Charlotte. Anything to say about that?\n\nBM: It was an amazing race. I couldn’t thank XR enough for putting on this race. They did an excellent job preparing the racetrack. The bottom is what helped me all the way through. My car worked great. I couldn’t do it without my sponsors, all of my crew, my mom, my dad and grandparents, Ben and Carson and most importantly Jesus Christ for letting us be able to do this every week.\n\nRB: How often have you been to this track? Were you at the short track championships?\n\nBM: Yes ma’am. We run the short track championships every year. I’ve run those four times. We came here last year for the Sizzler. And then this event here. So I think six or seven times.\n\nRB: Will you be racing with the Mid-East Series?\n\nBM: No ma’am. We are not following the Mid-East series. We are actually following the GM Performance 602 Series.\n\nRB: What are the main tracks you race at?\n\nBM: We actually travel all over the country. We hit a lot in the Southeast. Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, Alabama--all those tracks we hit on a regular basis.\n\nRB: Do you have other plans for this year, like with the XR Series?\n\nBM: Oh yes, ma’am. We ran some last year. We traveled to Bristol and made an appearance there. We got in a wreck after starting 17th and passing for second our right front tire blew out. As long as they keep running our class, we’ll continue to do it. It’s a great series to run and a great group to run with.\n\nRB: Any certain competitors you want to comment on?\n\nBM: The 215 (Jamison McBride) is always good. He led most of the race last night and he’s a good competitor and he’s fun to race with.\n\nRB: Anything to say about people from this area and pioneers like Mike Duvall?\n\nBM: Absolutely. Mike Duvall was always a really hard guy to race with and a very good guy to race with. Always someone to look up to. And Chris Ferguson. He and I are good buddies. I’ve gone and helped him at a race or two before. They’re an outstanding group to be around.\n\nDillon Brown, Mid-East 604 Colossal 100 Winner on May 12, 2022 at the Dirt Track at Charlotte, #6, Gaffney, S.C.\n\nRB: Dillon, Congratulations on your win. There were about 30 cars there. How did you feel about winning The Colossal 100 at The Dirt Track at Charlotte?\n\nDB: I mean anytime you can win at Charlotte it’s just a big deal because of the stage you are on, and the amount of eyes and the people there watching and watching live now. It’s just a great opportunity. I’ve been having a little bit of success there over the years. Winning at Charlotte is as big as it gets in this part of the country for our crate car. It’s a wonderful opportunity. I’m in a really good position, the people I’ve surrounded myself as far as Penske and ProFab, Renegade and Hendren and Russell, my brothe,r and the people that work for me, HST Shock Technologies. It’s truly amazing in what we’ve been able to do over the last year.\n\nRB: I used to cover drivers like Ron Parker, Steve Hendren and Chris Steele when they were running at the top levels in crate late models. As far as the Short Track Championship and other races at Charlotte--you’ve won there before?\n\nDB: I won three there last year. I won this year.\n\nRB: Yeah, I talked to Chris Ferguson and he said he was still trying to win at Charlotte. As far as the XR Series and the Mid-East Series and the regional racing around here, it was great to see all the area racers do well. Anything to say about your competitors, be it Jeremy Steele or those guys?\n\nDB: Yeah, Jeremy’s been really good in this region and those guys have been touring a lot at some of the same places I’ve been at. And not to discredit him at all, but I seen where he started at really last year in the 604 and where he’s at now. He’s tough and he’s only getting tougher. So me and him have become really good friends. We talk a lot. I’ve got a lot of respect for him and his dad, Chris. I messed up there at Elkin (Friendship Speedway) a few weeks ago for one of those Mid-East races and he done his job and outrun me, beat me. I was leading and he got by me on a restart. I looked up on the board and there were four or five to go. I say that being funny. Like I said, he’s only getting better. I hate to see maybe where he’s going to be maybe in a few months and next year.\n\nRB: You’re from Gaffney and Cherokee Speedway, I’m also working with the Gaston County Shrine Club, planning for the Shrine 100, the 50th anniversary. Any pioneers that you admired over the years?\n\nDB: Well, I’ve raced with Rambo (Franklin) and (Chris) Madden a lot. Madden’s a really big mentor of mine and has helped me a lot throughout my career. He still helps me to this day, and I wouldn’t be where I am without him. And Mike Duvall. My family owns Cherokee Landscaping and Mike Duvall, the last five or six years before he moved to the crates when he run super there, he drove for my grandpa. So I grew up with Duvall. And Pam posted a picture a few weeks ago of my brother and Bonnie at the racetrack in diapers. So I got all of my memories are from the Duvall days, in his prime. Duvall was a pioneer and an idol and I worshiped him. I mean, in my opinion, he was one of the best to ever come out of this region. I miss that guy a lot. And funny that you asked me that. I was just talking to his son Mitchell a few weeks ago at Cherokee—the first time I ever drove a late model was in Duvall’s driving school car. I got a Barry Wright that year and I wrecked it. And Mike was kind of taking a backseat and not driving so much and he got a crate car. One of his cars with a crate motor in it. And he let me borrow it for three or four weeks so I could race. So yeah, I know I went all the way around the world to get your answer, but Duvall would definitely be at the top of that list that you asked me about.\n\nRB: That’s great. And anything to say about the XR series and Mid-East series and promotion and payouts?\n\nDB: Let me first say this—I was very thankful for the XR for allowing us, the Mid-East guys, to tag along, especially in their finale there for the $50,000. I was grateful for the opportunity and grateful just to be able to come and race with those guys. And the Mid-East, as far as the Mid-East goes, Jason took a chance there. 604’s in this area were starting to die and he took a chance to have a 604 race and that guy really took on a role, trying to put some life back into that series and into that class. And he has. I’ve tried to support him. And that’s the argument right now--do I really want to ride four hours to Fayetteville this weekend or not? I’m deciding if I want to go or not. I want to go, just to support him because I want him to do it again next year. I have a lot of respect and grateful for him too for taking a chance on the 604 class. Obviously, we’d always like to race for more money. But maybe next year they’ll get 30 or more cars showing, and maybe they should pay a little more.\n\nRB: What are your plans in next couple weeks?\n\nDB: I’m going to Fayetteville next week and then over that weekend we’ll probably go to Smoky Mountain and Wytheville.\n\nRB: Wytheville’s a nice track. Anything else you’d like to add?\n\nDB: Again, I want to emphasize on the XR and Mid-East stuff--I don’t know if I worded those quotes right or not--but, no complaints. It was a smooth show and run the way a show’s supposed to be run. Like I said to begin with, it ain’t easy to win Charlotte. So just to win, I’m just grateful for the opportunity. Just grateful for everybody that was a part of it, including XR, Charlotte Motor Speedway, the Mid-East. Just grateful to be able to be on that stage.\n\nRB: I was in the booth on Thursday when they were trying to get the race in by the 10:00 p.m. curfew. The weather is something that plays a factor as well.\n\nDB: Last year for the Sizzler, they had the $10,000-to-win crate race there on that Sunday night and I passed for the lead on lap 30. It was supposed to be a 50-lap crate race--it was the headline for that weekend. I passed for the lead on lap 30 and they throwed the checkered flag on lap 31 because of lightning within five miles of the racetrack. I won $10,000.\n\nPreston Blalock Mid-East 602 Colossal 100 winner on May 12, 2022, # Clemmons, N.C.\n\nRB: Thanks for taking a little time to talk. Have you been here at Charlotte before?\n\nPB: Yeah, I’ve been to the short track championships every weekend in October every time they’ve had it. I’ve run a modified. I build my own cars. I don’t run every weekend. I had been away from it for about ten years myself, but I got back into it about six years ago. I got a modified and I ran the Sizzler last year in the modified and that’s actually how I got hooked up with the late model ride. The gentleman was there. He didn’t make the show in the modified--his driver didn’t--and he got to talking to me and that’s how we got hooked up this year driving his late model. He bought a late model over the winter and that’s how I ended up being in the late model. That was my seventh race in a late model.\n\nRB: Wow. That’s great. You’re from Greensboro now and originally from Florida?\n\nPB: Yeah, I’m originally from Jacksonville, Florida. Used to race Earl Pearson Jr. Earl Pearson Jr. in the Lucas Oil. But I moved up here in 1994 because of racing. I was a big fish in a little pond down there. I’d won a bunch of races and short track championships and thought I was going to be the next Dale Earnhardt, so I moved up here. But I’m now a fireman full-time, have 26 years in. I work for the city of Greensboro Fire Department but I live in Clemmons which is about 45 minutes from Greensboro, Southwest of Winston Salem.\n\nRB: It was great to see regional and local guys here who run in the Mid-East series.\n\nPB: Yeah, the Mid-East Series is an awesome series. Jason Wahls has done a great job with that series. Started out with the modifieds and now he’s got four to five divisions and it’s really the best thing going. Car counts are good with the economy like it is. And usually, for the lack of a better word, it’s the cream of the crop who show up to run these big shows. They pay good, better than the local shows usually. And it’s fun getting to travel. A lot of people don’t get to travel or run different tracks instead of being a one track wonder, running the same track every weekend. I run part-time. I’m 50 years old. I’ve run every weekend and I just run when I can. I try to get in a couple races a month and that works out perfect. I’ve run seven times this year and usually I run 10 to 12 a year. So I’m a little head of schedule, but it kind of worked out that way. People go weekend to weekend and say what’s next? We kind of wing it and don’t have a schedule and look something up, what’s paying money and what might be fun to go race.\n\nRB: You see things differently at different weekends. And things are always changing. Might you run at N. Wilkesboro?\n\nPB: Yeah, we’re going to see. We’re definitely looking at it. We’ll see when it gets closer, if they’re still doing Charlotte, we’re definitely going to go to Charlotte. I think it’s a few weeks before Charlotte. We’ll just see how it plays out. We haven’t committed to it yet. I actually raced asphalt. I raced asphalt when we moved up here. I actually raced there in ‘96. They closed it the next week. We ran the week before, the asphalt modifieds, NASCAR Whelen modifieds and the late model stocks They used to call them the Goody’s Dash Series. We ran there the week before the Cup series went there and ran their last race in ’96. I was actually running third and had a flat tire with 10 to go. But yeah, so I’ve raced there on asphalt, not on dirt. But it’s such a big track and these crate motors, get kind of wound up. The supers I think will be great but the crates, we’ll see what happens.\n\nRB: So do you have any pioneers in racing that you admire?\n\nPB: Oh yeah, originally from Florida, my grandfather actually worked with Smokey Yunick down there. He owned cars and Fireball Roberts drove for him for a while. My grandfather was one of his crew members. And, of course, my dad. Leroy Yarborough was big down there and won the Cup and everything and my dad raced with his brother. He’s from down there and they knew all them people. My dad was a racer. He’s actually in the dirt car hall of fame down in Florida. I would love to have raced with my dad, but I didn’t get to. I’ve actually raced with my son. My son started last year. We ran a couple races together, but he didn’t get the car ready this year. But definitely, I love Fireball Roberts. My folks were there, or my grandparents, when he got burned. Him and LeeRoy Yarbrough and Tiny Lund was a fixture down in Jacksonville. He ran there a lot. I’ve got pictures of my grandparents with them. So people around here don’t know me well because I don’t get on Facebook much and I was on asphalt. A lot of people think I just started racing. A lot of people thought my son drove the cars. I won at Friendship when it was asphalt and now it’s dirt again. We’re going there this weekend. I’ve crew-chiefed an ARCA car at Charlotte. I crew-chiefed a guy in New Jersey in ARCA. I’ve raced around Bristol on asphalt. Been to Myrtle Beach, been to Hickory racing and Martinsville and all that. But when I got back into dirt racing six years ago, and I don’t run every weekend, a lot of people think I just got started. I’ve been doing this since I’ve been born, literally. I’ve raced 26 different tracks in seven states, I think. And if you were there, we were the only one of all them people that was there with an open-trailer.\n\nRB: Yeah, I heard you saying that in victory lane.\n\nPB: Yeah, I own my own car. I do my own set-ups. I build my own cars. I didn’t build this late model, but I keep it up. I work on it. Didn’t have the money like everybody else or complain about it because I don’t have to do this. It made me think of my dad and he was the same way. I really am very old school when it comes to working on your stuff. I see these kids get out of the car and dad and everybody are there working on the car and he’s just waiting there to get back in it and that tears me up. You’ve got to know everything about your car. Get in there, get your fingers dirty. That’s half the fun. And racing, any of it, especially dirt racing, is a whole lot of work. We ran green flag, Wednesday night, started sixth, ended up third. We did not have one caution. It was over in 6 minutes and 48 seconds. Because I had the race monitor. And I prepped for that race for a week and a half. So you have to enjoy. I try to instill in my sons—if you don’t enjoy working on them, three quarters of it—enjoy the family, the camaraderie, the fans. I mean it really is a brotherhood. We parked beside of Trent Ivey and we had never met them before and we had a big time. His dad is hilarious.\n\nRB: Yeah, the Ivey’s and others are definitely a fun group. It’s all a racing family.\n\nPB: Yeah, when we won and we got the pictures and they took the car to my trailer and proceeded to do the tech, he was right there. You’da thought he’d won. Right there with us. It was just great. And the pioneers. Since I’m not from up here, those are the first ones where they like the Freddy or Ralph Earnhardt or whatever. But I have family ties to Fireball Roberts and LeeRoy Yarbrough, the two main ones just because of the state and city I lived in. I’m a historian. I love the old. Because my step-grandpa raced at Daytona, started in the ARCA Permatech, back in the 60’s and 70’s. I have an original at my house—I have an original 1959 entry form to the very first Daytona 500 that he got and he kept and I ended up with it.\n\nRB: And you have people that help you? And your son?\n\nPB: My car, I have zero. But his car. One is Randy’s Custom Lettering. He done all the wraps on the car. And then Salvage America; it’s a recycling center in Greensboro. It does all your recycling. And then the last one is called Shore Thang Charters in Charleston,\n\nRB: Anything else to say about being from around Jacksonville?\n\nPB: I grew up on the West side and the West side is the Navy base. My dad wasn’t in the Navy, but he worked on the Navy base. They have the North side, West side and South side and the North side is kind of worn down and kind of rough. The South side is the beaches. And the West side, like Lynyrd Skynyrd, that’s where they’re from.\n\nJeremy Steele, Mid-East 604, 2nd Place Finisher on May 12, 2022 at the Dirt Track at Charlotte, #22, York, S.C.\n\nRB: The other night at Charlotte you had a good run; anything to say about that?\n\nJS: It was pretty good. We fell back pretty early to like seventh. We got strung out and got some clean air and started to drive back to the front. I had a really good car; just didn’t have enough time to get to Dillon. I don’t know if I would have been able to get around him but I think we could have at least had a race.\n\nRB: I had a note about something skipping in your engine?\n\nJS: We did have something in qualifying, but we got it fixed.\n\nRB: What are your plans and do you have a comment on the Mid-East series?\n\nJS: I’m actually going to Cherokee to practice somebody’s else’s car and then I’m going to Lavonia tomorrow night and then race my car at Fayetteville. But I think the Mid-East deal’s good and we need a good 604 series around here. Obviously, we don’t get to race the XR deal, but I think it’s good and they’re giving it back. Whatever they’re bringing in, they’re giving back, if not more.\n\nRB: Anyone to thank?\n\nJS: We had a couple extra people. We had Jonathan that comes with us, Dad was there, Chris that owns it all, Randy Adams, Doug Adams; that was really it.\n\nRB: Were there any drivers you didn’t know that raced there?\n\nJS: There might have been a couple, but most of those guys we’ve raced with. As much traveling as we’ve done everywhere from Virginia to Tennessee to Florida, we pretty much see many of those guys.\n\nRB: Are you doing any FASTRAK races?\n\nJS: We’re not really running any other series besides The Mid-East. If FASTRAK has some good races, we’ll probably go. Crate racing USA has some races, the All-star deal. Any of them that have the big races; we’re kind of hopping around how we want to.\n\nRB: Anything else about the weekend at The Dirt Track at Charlotte?\n\nJS: Yeah, I was glad to be there and the racetrack was in really good shape, probably the best I’ve ever seen it in a couple years if not ever. I think whoever did it did a good job on it. I think that whole XR Deal is a good deal.\n\nJamison McBride, Mid-East 602, 2nd and 3rd place finishes, Mid-East 604, 4th place at The Colossal 100 5-11 to 5-14-2022, #215, Danbury, N.C.\n\nRB: Congrats on your top finishes at The Dirt Track at Charlotte. Was the track similar all the days you were there?\n\nJM: Thank you. Yeah, the racetrack was pretty similar, but Thursday it was pretty hooked up then. It was pretty hammer down. But Wednesday and Saturday it was pretty slick.\n\nRB: Do you compete regularly with 602 & 604?\n\nJM: Yeah, we run some of the tour. We’re pretty regular with them as far as running their stuff.\n\nRB: And how long have you been racing late models?\n\nJM: I started racing in 2014. I run go-karts then. But I started running late models in 2018.\n\nRB: How many times did you run The Dirt Track at Charlotte?\n\nJM: I run, I think, six times.\n\nRB: And do you have a general statement about the XR and Mid-East series and how they’re trying to support the racers and hopefully bring more money to all of you, especially regionally?\n\nJM: Yeah, I think it’s a good thing because they’re paying good money wherever they go and they’re all good people. They’re trying to bring more money into it and, yeah, it’s drawing a crowd and it’s drawing plenty of cars and I’ll go do it.\n\nRB: This week are you doing Fayetteville, or do you have other plans? I know with tires and costs have affected some drivers.\n\nJM: We’re supposed to go to Friendship. It’s a local track and not but an hour away.\n\nRB: So you drive there more regularly?\n\nJM: We run up there pretty regularly now since 311 isn’t doing anything this year.\n\nRB: I know that they have the short track championships at Charlotte. What do you do for your job during the week? I know expenses and tires can affect travel.\n\nJM: Well, actually I’m still in high school.\n\nRB: Do your parents or other relatives race?\n\nJM: My grandpa, Gary Mabe, he races. And my dad. Both of them used to run the Clash back ten or 15 years ago.\n\nRB: Do you do any of the iRacing?\n\nJM: No, not really. I used to I play it a little bit.\n\nRB: And you mentioned your grandpa. Outside of your relatives, do you have any pioneers that you admire or like to watch or wished you could have raced with?\n\nJM: I like watching Scott Bloomquist and all of them ‘cause they’re good and still are good.\n\nRB: He won the first Colossal 100. Do you have any racing goals?\n\nJM: Probably to run super late models because we run some last year. But I’d like to get into it and run it pretty consistently and try to compete with some of them boys.\n\nRB: And do any friends at school come watch you or also race?\n\nJM: Yes, I’ve got a few people that comes from school every now and then and some of my buddies.\n\nRB: Well, it’s a great family sport. How old you are?\n\nJM: 16\n\nRB: Anything else you’d like to say?\n\nJM: Really, I’d like to thank my mom and my daddy and my grandpa and all my crew and my sponsors, because you can’t do it without them. And thank God and do it with love.\n\nEthan Wilson, Mid-East 604, 3rd place finisher at The Colossal 100 5-14-2022, Fayetteville, N.C.\n\nRB: Anything to say about yesterday and your brother Daulton competing with the Lucas Oil Series and now being in Iowa?\n\nEW: It’s honestly the first time we’ve ever been out this way with Daulton getting this deal. The furthest race we’ve been was probably Florence, Ky. The North South we raced. This is definitely the furthest we’ve ever been away from home racing. It was pretty good. We enjoyed it. The thing is to get out here to new places. And he’s just trying to figure out how to race and racing all these guys who’ve been out here before. If we were racing our normal crowd, we’d probably be okay. But when we get out here with the professionals, you’ve got to be on your A-game right out the gate.\n\nRB: It takes some time. He got 13th last night.\n\nEW: Yeah, we wound up 13th. He was up to 11th and then that last caution they had the rear tire was going flat and he just went around there to finish the race.\n\nRB: With you, congrats on your 3rd at The Dirt Track at Charlotte. Have you raced there before?\n\nEW: I run the Carolina Sizzler. The only race I run there was the Carolina Sizzler and I think I wound up finishing 10th or 11th there that night. That was my first time around Charlotte and until the other night, that’s only the second time I’ve raced a late model at Charlotte.\n\nRB: That’s pretty good. Anything to say about the track?\n\nEW: We enjoyed going to Charlotte. I’m sure you know that where we are from in the Carolinas there aren’t very many places in the Carolinas that race the best. They race pretty good sometimes but not a lot. But Charlotte is one of the few places you can go in the Carolinas that once the racetrack slows down, it actually gets pretty racey. But with my experience at Charlotte, definitely not having many laps leading where I led the first laps, there was a brown streak that I was trying to run and when it went away. It went away right about when that caution came out. The only thing I really don’t like about Charlotte, is you can’t see your spotters very well. Like letting you know where you should be on the racetrack. You get out front and the racetrack’s so wide. That’s a good thing and it makes for good racing. But I felt a little helpless there when that caution come out because I didn’t know where to be on the racetrack. Especially when you’ve got guys like Matt Long behind you and Dillon’s back there. Them guys have got so many laps around Charlotte, so they kind of know where to be at. I figured if they were going to get me, they were going to get me on that caution. And Dillon, he’s run a lot of laps around there and he’s been pretty good there and I’m not in my head about that.\n\nRB: Any pioneer racers you admired growing up?\n\nEW: A lot of people always talked about Freddy Smith when we were growing up. I would have to say with my age the one person that I looked up to was Scott Autry. He was right around our home.\n\nRB: Yes, he ran with the Carolina Clash too.\n\nEW: That would probably be a pioneer for me and Daulton. It would probably be Scott. We watched Scott race. We would travel when he raced an asphalt car at Wayne County Speedway. It’s an asphalt track that’s there by the house. And we’re not really into the asphalt stuff, but we would just go to watch him. And he was always good with us because we were just kids at the time and we would take pictures. We kind of knew them on a personal basis for a little while. And my mom was pretty good friends with his wife. Obviously, we were kids and he wasn’t hanging out with us or anything, but as far as the kid aspect taking the pictures and the T-shirts and from that aspect of it, it was Scott.\n\nRB: I assume you and Daulton are still on board for some of those big races—the Eldora Million, the North/South, etc.?\n\nEW: Yeah, we’re definitely going to be at Eldora for the Million. that’s his goal. Obviously, he run tomorrow at 34 and then we’ll be headed to the Million for sure. We’ll definitely be there for the North /South. And pretty much give him a leash and let him do whatever he’s comfortable with. And the Lucas deal has kind of worked out with everything this year because of the tire situation. As long as you’re running the tour you get tires when you need them. I mean that’s why we’ve run it as long as we have. So hopefully that will continue like it is. But as far as all the big stuff, it’s all about the money right now. We’re going to chase it as long as they let us chase it.\n\nRB: And do you have any specific goals?\n\nEW: I mean, I have not raced as much, obviously because we were financially strapped a bit for both of us to race a lot at the same time. So I raced just enough just to keep up and not fall off as far as skill and then still taking in all the knowledge I could. But our goals was to get me in to where he’s at and in the near future. Me messing my motor up at Cherokee for the World of Outlaws race kind of put a damper on it for me as far as the super stuff. But that eventually is the goal for both of us to have our own deal as far as doing what he’s doing right now. Getting him to where he’s at right now and get me doing more of my own stuff. Q"
