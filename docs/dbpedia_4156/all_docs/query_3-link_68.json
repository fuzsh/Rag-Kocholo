        "text": "Postcard with pic by Hannes Petersen\n\nDaily posts continue here on May Dreams Gardens!\n\nDid I mention I’ve started the tiniest little collection of vintage postcards?\n\nOh, I didn’t mention my tiny little collection of vintage postcards? Well, let me tell you, I have started the tiniest little collection of vintage postcards.\n\nI tend to like Christmas postcards with unusual flowers on them, like lily of the valley and violets. One doesn’t often associate the holidays with those flowers today, but back in the day, they did.\n\nAnd lately I’ve taken to finding postcards with fanciful drawings like this one of an angel riding on top of some kind of beetle (or is it a roach) which is being pulled by two butterflies. This particular postcard is German and the artist “Hannes Petersen” is really Johanna Helene Charlotte Schröder. Most of the websites about her are written in German so I only know she was born in 1885 and died in 1960 in Berlin. On the back of this particular postcard, someone also wrote a message in German, and I have no idea what it is.\n\nI’ve discovered several other artists from this same time period who drew fanciful pictures of little bunnies and mice and other forest creatures all dressed up for postcards. So far, I’ve discovered Molly Brett, Racey Helps, and Hester Margetson, I made a Pinterest board for them called “Bunnies and Mice – Illustrations”.\n\nI’m sure there are other such artists of the same ilk and if I’m meant to find out about them, I will. Of all of them, I like Molly Brett the most, at least today. That could change tomorrow.\n\nReally, it’s just the tiniest little collection of vintage postcards. Oh, and did I mention I also like postcards with pictures of people in their gardens? That’s another current obsession interest.\n\nReally, it is just the tiniest little collection and if I limit it to certain flowers, a few artists and gardeners in their gardens, it should stay tiny, I think. I hope!"
