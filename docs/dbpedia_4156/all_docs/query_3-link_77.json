        "text": "By the time the Delaware Medical Relief Team landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday, they had treated thousands of earthquake survivors, committed to building more than 240 homes in Nepal and showed villagers who had lost everything that everything wasn't lost.\n\n\"Sometimes, I ask myself why I'm doing these things,\" admitted Kathryn Gollotto, a sports medicine doctor who joined the third wave of volunteers this week. \"The desire to help others is too deep.\"\n\nThe second wave, a nine-member team of doctors, nurses, physician assistants and logistics experts accompanied by The News Journal, arrived in Kathmandu on Mother's Day to deliver medical care and supplies to communities near the capital. Two days later, on May 12, a 7.3-magnitude earthquake threatened to abort their mission.\n\nInstead, the team rallied to finish out the week, seeing more than 1,000 patients in their final three days.\n\n\"We will work until daylight stops or we run out of patients,\" promised Christiana physician assistant Patrick Phelan. Gutsy and sincere, Phelan was among three team members who attempted to drive six hours and trek several more hours to the remote village area of Syabrubesi to treat some of the hardest-hit Nepalese.\n\nA landslide blocked their path. Phelan compared the adventure to bungee jumping, which he wouldn't dare do back home.\n\n\"The end part is making me jump,\" he said.\n\nThat elusive \"end part,\" helping others who can't help themselves, drove team members to ignore their own gnawing fears, leave their families and comfortable homes and fly to a shell-shocked country whose own government had ordered search and rescue workers to go home days earlier.\n\nArriving two weeks after the first, 7.8-magnitude earthquake, the team mostly treated minor wounds and listened to complaints about chronic joint pain, upset stomachs, sleepless nights and, yes, acne. A group of nurses spent 20 minutes trying to convince a stubborn elderly man to go on blood pressure medication or risk a stroke. The man eventually left with a year's supply.\n\nThe Nepal mission was a major departure from the team's work in Haiti, where doctors performed lifesaving surgeries shortly after a devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nStill, volunteers listened intently to patients, reassuring them with a knee pat, pinky swear or lollipop. Each day, they rolled their mobile pharmacy/suitcase to the next classroom, tent city or hilltop. Lunches consisted of trail mix or granola bars.\n\n\"How can we take a break?\" said Jessey Jennings, a Christiana nurse practitioner. Among her patients, Jennings treated a 5-month-old trapped for 22 hours under the rubble.\n\nTo date, the combined death toll from the two Nepal earthquakes is more than 8,500, along with another 21,000 injured. Some 600,000 families have lost their homes.\n\nLess than a week after the first earthquake, the Delaware team gathered dozens of volunteers and mounted a highly orchestrated effort to respond swiftly. They fielded a three-person advance team to confirm logistics on the ground, communicated regularly with Nepal-based coordinators and overcame bureaucratic hurdles to secure spots at hospitals and makeshift clinics.\n\n\"You don't have to have money to make a difference,\" said volunteer Stacy Myrie, a medical assistant in dermatology at Christiana who also serves meals at Wilmington's Sunday Breakfast Mission.\n\nGrowing up poor in Jamaica, Myrie recalls praying on an NGO-issued Bible when her grandmother was seriously ill with a stomach infection.\n\nIf God would spare her grandmother, Myrie promised to devote her life in service to others.\n\nThis week, she joined the third wave of medical team volunteers, a young, energetic group calling themselves the \"Crazy Eights.\" A fourth group of about 10 volunteers is expected to depart Saturday, providing a sense of continuity in a country that has slipped from international headlines.\n\nDifferent standard of care\n\nBernard Racey could either buy a new microwave or build a house in Nepal.\n\nRecently, the Christiana Care physician assistant proudly showed a cellphone image of his legacy: a basic tin structure with a brick foundation that promises to keep one Nepali family dry during the coming monsoon.\n\nAll this for the bargain price of $100. In the next several days, building materials for more than 240 homes will be distributed by Helping Hands Health Education, a non-governmental organization that will match a percentage of the medical team volunteers' donations.\n\nAlso contributing is Hands International, a California-based nonprofit group. Wilmington internist Reynold Agard is the group's medical director. Benefiting families will participate in the rebuilding effort.\n\n\"To fully reach out to a grassroots organization is more authentic,\" explained Racey, a father of two who encouraged his neighbors in West Grove, Pennsylvania, to donate. \"I am setting an example for my boys.\"\n\nIt was a frustrating, emotional week for Racey and other team members, who couldn't help but compare Nepal's hobbled health care infrastructure with the standard of care in the United States.\n\nCommunicating through interpreters, volunteers focused on the basics, cleaning stitches with bottled water, lancing a pus-filled nose abscess to produce a fountain of blood and recommending rice and bananas to stop chronic diarrhea. Nurses initially suggested bread until a local reminded them, \"We don't have bread here.\"\n\nFor much of the trip, the team was in damage-control mode, addressing chronic issues that were long ignored, misdiagnosed or improperly treated.\n\nWith two doctors for every 10,000 people, health care in Nepal is beyond the means of most citizens because of insufficient government funding. Only about half of the poorest Nepalese seek treatment when they are ill, because of problems with access and affordability, according to research by the World Bank.\n\nNepal ranked 139th in life expectancy, with the average Nepalese living less than 66 years, according to a 2010 World Health Organization study.\n\nOver the past week, Delaware volunteers found themselves treating symptoms without any expectation of follow-up care. After spending decades carrying gargantuan baskets of brush and hay for miles, arthritis sufferers received packets of 10 aspirin to blunt their pain.\n\nA young woman with a 102-degree fever for six days straight was told to travel to a district hospital three hours away. Delaware nurses were concerned about meningitis, but it was unclear how the patient would get from point A to point B.\n\nOn Sunday, Racey visited with Ram Devi Sijakhwo, a 50-year-old woman who lost movement in both her legs during the first earthquake. He was recruited by Sijakhwo's niece, who worked at the medical team's hotel.\n\nAccompanied by a News Journal reporter and photographer, Racey entered the hospital, walked up six flights of stairs and consulted with the patient in a dark room full of 20 others without being stopped by one hospital staffer.\n\nRacey studied the woman's outdated MRI and ran a wooden pointer along her feet to test her sensation. A bone fracture was pushing into her spinal cord, he concluded, requiring immediate surgery.\n\nAt that point, it had been nearly two weeks since the earthquake. Sijakhwo appeared to be dissolving into her bed at Bir Hospital, one of the busiest public hospitals in Kathmandu. Involuntary spasms gripped her right thigh, while her left hand glided up and down the plastic-covered bed handles.\n\nUnder her lip was a scabbed-over gash, a reminder of her four-story fall during the earthquake.\n\nShe wasn't scheduled for surgery until Tuesday.\n\n\"She's still shocked. She wants to be OK right now,\" explained Sijakhwo's niece, Laxmi.\n\nRacey, who works in neurosurgery at Christiana, grew increasingly exasperated.\n\n\"If this came in at any emergency room at any hospital in Christiana, it would've been done that night,\" he said.\n\n\"I think she'll improve. I don't know if she'll walk,\" he told the family. \"I wish I could do more.\"\n\nOn the way out, the physician assistant with 15 years of experience imagined if Sijakhwo had been born in a different country, to different parents.\n\n\"It's disturbing to know that where you're located and born affects your access to care,\" he said.\n\n\"To walk away from something like that, I've never done that,\" he said. \"It's killing me.\"\n\nLater that day, Racey joined the rest of the team in the medieval town of Bhaktapur, where he met a 40-year-old man who was paralyzed from the waist down after undergoing spine surgery to remove a benign tumor. The man had been discharged early to make room for quake victims.\n\nDoctors likely botched the surgery by cutting the nerves, Racey hypothesized.\n\nLying on a bedsheet covered with teddy bears, the patient greeted Racey with his hands folded in \"Namaste,\" before his eyes glazed over. Nearby, his 11-year-old daughter tried to cover his bedsores with scraps of newspaper.\n\n\"He's probably going to die in five years,\" said Racey, knowing that his patient didn't understand English.\n\nTemporary fix\n\nBombarded by hardship, the medical team banded together by bowing their heads in prayer each morning and blowing off steam with laughter each night.\n\nConstrained by resources and time, they delivered Band-Aids and hope to patients who were most appreciative.\n\nEven a stray dog received a splint on its right leg, before chewing it off.\n\n\"We didn't come to sightsee. We came to work,\" said team leader Agard.\n\n\"It's a real pleasure serving these people.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nTo date, the Delaware Medical Relief Team has raised nearly $100,000.
