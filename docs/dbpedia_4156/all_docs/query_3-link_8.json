All Medici prints come with a border around the image with the title and artist name printed at the foot of the sheet.\n\nAngus Clifford Racey Helps (1913-1971) was a leading children’s illustrator who produced many illustrations for The Medici Society throughout the 1950s and 60s. Born in Somerset he worked as an antiquarian book-dealer. A course at the West of England College of Art set him on his career as an author and illustrator of children’s books. His anthropomorphic illustrations of woodland animals are full of humour and appeal to children and adults alike.\n\nStandard Delivery\n\nStandard Delivery items are usually dispatched within 2 working days of the order being placed.
