        "text": "Cecily started her career on Capitol Hill working on public policy, where she met her husband, George, who is the grandson of BCI co-founder Verne Read.\n\nShe currently resides in Colorado with her husband and two young children, both of whom also love educating everyone they meet about the importance of bat conservation.\n\nIn addition to BCI, she serves on the board of her children’s school and a charitable foundation based in Wyoming.\n\nDanielle Gustafson is the Executive Director at EMS FDNY Help Fund. Trained as a visual artist, Danielle launched the New York Stock Exchange’s first website and then grew their digital footprint through 2009 before expanding her scope to start-ups, not-for-profits and banking. While serving as a digital-strategy executive in financial services, she also (literally) moonlighted as cofounder of the NYC Bat Group in 2004. In addition to her professional consulting work and leading bat walks, she now advocates for broader awareness and study of bats, and believes that the smartphone, in the hands of the citizen scientist, may be the most important conservation tool of the 21st century.\n\nDanielle is a graduate of the University of California at Santa Cruz, and has an MFA from California Institute of the Arts. She was a fellow at the Whitney Museum of American‘s Independent Study Program, studied e-business strategy at MIT Sloan School of Management and is a Resident at TED. She also serves on the Board of the International League of Conservation Photographers and has a recent TED Talk: The future of conservation is in your pocket.\n\nM.B. (Brock) Fenton received his Ph.D. in 1969 for work in the ecology and behaviour of bats. Since then he has held academic positions at Carleton University (Ottawa, Canada 1969 to 1986), York University (Toronto, Canada 1986 to 2003) and the University of Western Ontario (2003 to present). He has published more than 250 papers in refereed journals (most of them about bats), as well as numerous nontechnical contributions. He has written four books about bats intended for a general audience (Just bats 1983, University of Toronto Press; Bats 1992 – revised edition 2001 Facts On File Inc; and The bat: wings in the night sky 1998, Key Porter Press; Fenton and Simmons 2014 Bats: a world of science and mystery Univ of Chicago press).\n\nHe continues his research on the ecology and behaviour of bats, with special emphasis on echolocation and evolution. He currently is an Emeritus Professor of Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada. He was inducted as a Fellow of the Royals Society of Canada (FRSC) in November 2014.\n\nDr. Shahroukh Mistry\n\nShahroukh Mistry is a professor of Biology at Butte College in California, Adjunct Professor of Biology at California State University, Chico and has an avid interest in ecology, conservation, education, and outreach. He grew up in India where he researched the ecology and behavior of birds for his undergraduate and master’s degrees. Shahroukh received a master’s in Ethology with Gary McCracken at the University of Tennessee, examining the behavior of Mexican free-tailed bats in Texas, and then his Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of New Mexico with James H. Brown, investigating the role of Indian fruit bats in pollination and seed dispersal – a study that would not have been possible without the support of a BCI Student Scholar Award.\n\nShahroukh has been Chair of the Mammal Technical Committee for the Pennsylvania Biological Survey, part of the Chiroptera Specialist Group of the IUCN, and the Chiroptera Conservation and Information Network of South Asia. He served on the Board of the North American Society of Bat Research for ten years as Chair, Secretary and Associate Program Director. Shahroukh has received the Life Member Award from NASBR, and the John W. Rice Diversity and Equity Award from the California Community Colleges Board of Governors.\n\nJenn has both a business and technical background, and has worked for multiple Fortune companies as well as startups throughout her career, including companies centered around technology, software, banking, stock brokerage, transportation, and industrial automation. She has frequently been called upon to work with executives and corporate partners, and lead large global programs that require both strategic thought and attention to detail. Jenn has expertise in consulting, mediating, data analytics, employee engagement, customer experience, change management, Lean Six Sigma, and building cross-functional teams.\n\nJenn became aware of the benefits of bats over 20 years ago when she moved to a ranch and found the need for natural bug control. Being a conservationist at heart, as well as a proponent of managing property through organic measures, she discovered that bats were the perfect solution. This discovery resulted in two custom-made bat houses being built and installed on the ranch, and are now home to over 600 Mexican Freetail bats. The houses became maternity wards due to their location along the bats’ yearly migration path, were quickly inhabited, and are still in use to this day. This was the start of Jenn’s love for bats and her understanding of the critical need to protect this important and unique mammal and its habitats.\n\nJenn holds an MBA from UMass Amherst, and a Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola University New Orleans. She is thrilled to leverage her expertise to support Bat Conservation International’s mission to “conserve the world’s bats and their ecosystems to ensure a healthy planet.”\n\nCurator-in-Charge of the Department of Mammalogy and Professor in the Richard Guilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History. Dr. Simmons is an expert in taxonomy and systematics of bats. Author of the authoritative “Chiroptera” chapter in Mammal Species of the World, she maintains an ever-updated list of valid bat species of the world including their geographic ranges and recognized subspecies.\n\nDr. Simmons has authored numerous papers on bat phylogenetics and evolution, and in 2008 she was awarded the Gerrit S. Miller Award from the North American Society for Bat Research for outstanding contributions in the field of chiropteran biology. She is a member of the Steering Committee for the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Research Unit (SEABCRU), and is also a member of IUCN Bat Specialist Group of Species Survival Commission.\n\nDr. Andrew Sansom is one of Texas’ leading conservationists.
