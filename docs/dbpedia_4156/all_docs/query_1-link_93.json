BULLETIN OF HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION J o h n H u n t e r S e d g w ic k , Volume X V JULY, 1939 Editor Number 4 EDITORIALS A PATHETIC CASE It is one of the tragedies of history that so sensitive a man as Mr. John L. Lewis of the C. I. O. must be subjected to the buffetings of a naughty world. His irenic projects are by some obstructed, by others condemned, and worst of all by some other labor leaders. These, apparently, decline to let Mr. Lewis have his own way. This will shock our readers when they realise how gentle and beneficent that way has been. There appeared an item in the Boston Herald of June 15,1939, which quoted Mr. Lewis as saying that the C. I. O. peace committee believed that the A . F. of L. leaders ‘‘were following a rule or ruin policy.” This, too, will shock our readers, if only by its tone of dignified sorrow caused by the reactionary attitude of the A . F. of L. The idea that the wishes of Mr. Lewis and his associates should be opposed must be peculiarly repellent to all who, like them, are sensitive. Mr. Lewis has been the victim of cruel misunderstanding by some at least of the public. There were those, for example, who thought that the sit-down strikes, especially in the automobile industry, showed a certain tendency to ruling or ruining, even though the then Governor Murphy regarded them with blandness. These critics indeed went so far as to believe, nay, in some instances to say that Mr. Lewis and his C. I. O. were interfering with the well-being of the country in general and seeking to impose their will upon thousands of persons quite innocent of any fell designs upon organized labor. There were, too, thousands of Americans who pre­ ferred the rule of the law to that of Mr. Lewis and who believed that the law and the orders of courts of justice should be upheld. They instinctively felt that when the law was flouted, decent rules of living were flouted, and the props knocked away from the struc' ture of democracy. It appears now, however, that Mr. Lewis does not at all approve of ruling or ruining, at least when attempted by those not in sympathy with that body of philanthropists known as the C. I. O., that he is gravely moved and troubled in heart. Before this spectacle the flippant must stand corrected. There is one phase of the question to which we must make bold to call Mr. Lewis’ attention. First, after the sit-down strike had shown itself for what it was, the American public began to understand that it was a challenge to itself and associated Mr. Lewis with that challenge. It is well enough for him now to condemn a policy of ruling or ruining, but not long ago that was his policy. Second, policies like that of the C. I. O. have been in a large part of Europe the plausible excuse for the existence of totalitarianism with all its evil consequences and its threat to the free nations. Third, thé designs upon the democratic societies which the totalitarian states have plainly avowed, the more than grave conditions in the Old World, the necessity for cohesion in the democracies, all point to the fact that such systematic trouble making as that pursued by Mr. Lewis and his associates may shortly become a menace to the defense of the United States and that menace Americans will not permit.

REMONSTRANCES No doubt many honest and patriotic Americans have been grieved of late years that what they think ought to be as plainly is not. They seem to think that the declara­ tion of a right is tantamount to its effective defense. So it would be, if all men had as good morals as themselves. The main, or one of the main difficulties in the present condi­ tions of international relations is that these honest people do not seem to understand that something more than remonstrance is needed in doing the business of diplomacy in such fashion that what is right may prevail. T. J. Lawrence in his work on interna­ tional law under the title “ Non-Intervention” has this to say: taught to believe that what is not backed by force does not exist as anything to be reckoned with outside the realms of dialectic. It is not the immediate use of force that must be considered so much as the ability to use it in certain circumstances when there is a question of international justice. To this conception, men must accustom themselves as part of the normal instruments of civilized states, for failing that, force will be elevated into a principle and not left in its place as a means. To make remonstrances, to write solemn state papers, to tell the wrongdoer what he already knows, is no more than a literary exercise and worth about as much if it carry no implication that something more is meant by it. When, however, that implication is understood, results will be obtained. THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE The contemplative life is a thing of the past; the reflective life is more than ever a necessity, but the two are quite different. To scatter abroad protests and re­ It used to be possible to contemplate what proaches, and yet to let it be understood went on and do nothing else. The world that they will never be backed by force and the beings that seethed in it were to of arms, is the surest way to get them some a raree-show, to others a kind of theat­ treated with angry contempt. Neither rical performance, to still others material for selfish isolation nor undignified remon­ essays that at least were neither revolutionary strances is the proper attitude for honor­ nor improper. Indeed, at one stage of the able and self-respecting states. world’s history, no blame attached to a man This is clear enough and does not exagger­ who preferred to do his living on the side­ ate.

The contemplative had there are millions of men who have been always existed, but they were few in number July , 1939 and not very vocal before that time. Things kept on developing until the modern state took shape, especially the democratic state in which, oddly enough, each man was supposed to play his part. We say “ oddly enough” because in the United States where the suffrage is virtually universal and idling is not encouraged, the contemplative seem to have increased, not diminished. This can be explained by the fact that millions of Ameri­ cans merely contemplate their political and social life — they take no active part in either. They do their contemplating largely through the evening paper and read about crime and graft and disorder as they would peek at a two-headed calf. They do not seem to think that it has anything to do with 219 them; they are spectators; they are not citi2£ns; they contemplate a phenomenon, they do nothing to extirpate its causes. They have not been hurt themselves, or think that they have not, therefore their rule of thumb logic persuades them that malefactors and victims are in a well-nigh imaginary world. This kind of contemplation does not make moral fibre, but rather it weakens the public conscience. As a matter of fact, the contem­ plative life is impossible because citizens must do their part— existence in this world is not a show, but something more searching, where everyone must understand that each has a duty to perform. It is often not pleasant, but then that is not the criterion. “ BUSINESS LOOKS AHEAD” The Ninth Special Program of the Business School Alumni Over four hundred Business School Alumni and their guests attended the Ninth Special Program of the Harvard Business School Alumni Association held at the Business School on June 16 and 17. The general sub­ ject of the meeting was “ Business Looks Ahead,” and the Alumni heard men of prominence in both business and government affairs discuss various aspects of the problem of forecasting the trend of business during the coming months. The meetings began Friday afternoon in the Reading Room of Baker Library, continued with a dinner meet­ ing in Eliot House, and the final session was held in Baker Library on Saturday morning. The committee in charge of the program was under the leadership of Theodore F. Drury, ’28. Other members of the Alumni Committee included: Louis W . Munro ’23, president of the Alumni Association, Fred­ erick M . Bundy, ’23, Dwight P. Robinson, Jr., ’25, W. Stewart McDonald ’25, Boyce F. Martin ’30 and Roland P. Campbell ’35. It was the intention of this committee that a well-rounded program of interest to all Alumni be presented. In carrying out this purpose, three types of speakers were secured: Business School Faculty members, govern­ ment officials, and business executives. The topics discussed included the construction industry, the aviation industry, the public utilities industry, the Government’s recovery program, the financial situation, industry’s program for recovery, and the major social problems confronting business executives. The Alumni registered in Baker Library early Friday afternoon and then gathered in the Reading Room to hear the three afternoon speakers. The first speaker was Mr. Thomas S. Holden, vice-president in charge of statis­ tics and research of the F. W. Dodge Corpor­ ation. The title of his address was “ New Frontiers.” Following Mr. Holden was Mr. Claude Robinson, president of Opinion Research Corporation, who spoke on “ The New Science of Public Opinion Measure­ ment and Its Implications for Business.” The third speaker on the afternoon session was Judge Robert E. Healy, Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who spoke on “ Holding Companies and Pri­ vate Capital Financing.” The discussion of private capital financing was off-the-record, but the remainder of Judge Healy’s speech is carried, as are the other speeches, elsewhere in this issue of the B u l l e t i n . An innovation instituted by this year’s program was the cocktail party for all the Alumni, which was held in the Faculty Club. This provided the Alumni an opportunity to meet the speakers at the afternoon and eve­ ning meetings as well as to renew acquaint­ ances with classmates and friends. The dinner meeting was held this year in the main dining room of Eliot House. Ap­ proximately 220 Alumni and their guests were present at this meeting. Louis W. Munro, president of the Alumni Association for the year 1938-39, presided and introduced the speakers as well as the guests at the head table. The speakers included Mr. Marriner S. Eccles, chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Professor O. M . W. Sprague, Professor Malcolm P. McNair, and Dean Wallace B. Donham. Other guests at the head table included Mr. Holden and Judge Healy, who spoke at the afternoon meeting; Mr. Walter Bucklin, president of the National Shawmut Bank; Mr. Roy A. Young, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; Mr. John H. Wil­ liams, Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration; Mr. Hugh Ward, vice-president of the First National Bank of Boston; Professor Philip Cabot; Theodore F. Drury, chairman of the Special Program Committee; and Edmund F. Wright, newly elected president of the Association. Mr. 221 July, 1939 THE SPEAKERS’ TABLE A T THE A N N U A L ALUMNI DINNER Left to right: Eccles, Munro, Sprague and Healy Munro announced the election of the officers in addition to Mr. Wright, who will be in charge of the Association during the coming year. These included W. Stewart McDon­ ald of New York, vice-president; Boyce F. Martin, secretary-treasurer; and the follow­ ing members of the Executive Council : Robert E. Anderson, Jr., Boston; William O. Forssell, Walpole; Russell M . Sanders and Joseph J. Snyder of Boston; and John M. Young, Jr., of New York. The program was resumed Saturday morn­ ing with a speech by Mr. Howard Coonley, chairman of the Board of the Walworth Company and president of the National Association of Manufacturers. The title of Mr. Coonley’s address was “ Obstacles in the Way of Business Recovery.” The second speaker on the program was Mr. R. S. Damon, vice-president in charge of operations of American Airlines, Inc., who spoke on the future of air transportation. The final speaker on the program was Professor Philip Cabot. The topic of Mr. Cabot’s speech was “ Ten Years of Depression — the Shadow and the Substance.” There were representatives at the meeting from all parts of the country. A total of 32 cities were represented, including San Fran­ cisco, Tampa, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Balti­ more, Rochester, Washington, Hartford, as well as New York and Boston. Except for the local group the largest contingent was from New York with a total of 23 men repre­ senting this city. There were six Alumni from Hartford, five from Rochester, four from Springfield, and three from Bridgeport, New Haven, Washington, and Holyoke. The final Alumni Council meeting, which was held after the afternoon session, was 222 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin attended by a large number of representatives Hedges ’26 of Rochester, N.

I would, therefore, like to survey briefly the past hundred years of economic growth in the United States, citing original documents. First, a letter to the editor of the 'Hew Tor\\ Evening Post, dated May 1,1937: “ The present commercial revulsion is without a parallel in our history. The distress pervades all classes — the pru­ dent and the foolhardy — the regular mer­ chant and the speculator, the manufacturer, tradesman, laborer, banker — all are involved in one general calamity.” Next item in our outline would be this from Harper's Wee\\ly, dated October 10, 1857: “ It is a gloomy moment in history. Not for many years has there been so much grave and deep appre­ hension; never has the future seemed so incal­ culable as at this time. . . . O f our own troubles no man can see the end.” The theme recurs in 1876, when on August 3, the New Yor\\ World said: “ The industrious millions o f our people are suffering now as they have never suffered before. Honest labor starves, and capital hides out of sight.” The consistency of the picture was again con­ firmed on April 28, 1894, when the J^ew Tor\\ Commercial said: “ The world has com­ pleted, perhaps, the most disastrous liquida­ tion in its history.” A glutton for punishment the United States survived till March 1,1908, when the Wall Street Journal expressed the emotions of the moment in mixed metaphors, as follows: “ There never was a time in the country’s history when our industrial affairs were in such a tangle, and were going down­ hill as rapidly as they are today.” And, to climax the record of despair, let me quote the New Yor\\Herald'Tribune of January 1,1938: “ The year 1937 will be remembered as the one in which the world, steadily and insist­ ently, appeared to be going to hell in a hanging basket. It was a twelvemonth of gloom, uncertainty and apprehension. Many things happened to disturb the even surface flow of events — strikes, wars, and so on. But what actually did happen? Was there any substantial and measurable gain in the upward struggle of the human race? In all the pulling and hauling, the conflicts and the bickerings, was there any tangible victory, over any broad front, for the nobler aspira­ tions of mankind? We presume to doubt it. The assaults upon the ideals of democracy surely became stronger. The increase in bitterness, between peoples and factions and individuals, appears too obvious for comment. Are there still men of good will? Perhaps, but they are hard to find.” I think you can draw two possible con­ clusions from all this. You might decide that the people of the United States are a weary plodding race, inured to misfortune and resigned to a barren and desolate existence. On the other hand, you might conclude that the recuperative energy of our economic system resides less in charts of statisticians, predictions of economists and remarks of newspaper commentators than in the indi­ vidual and collective will and intelligence of people. If our economic system were a machine, as many people appear to assume, it would long ago have broken down beyond repair. If it is a living, growing organism, then it must progress by the experimental method. Experi­ ments by government and criticism of govern­ mental experiments are part of the process. I will draw one more quotation from the source of the others I have given you, When the Merry'Go'Round Breads Down, by Wilfred J. Funk. Said the Washington (D.C.) Daily National Intelligencer, on June 12, 1838: “ Everything is uncertain on account of the Government. The members of that Govern­ ment write to some of our business men, encouraging the hope of a change in policy; but no change takes place of any consequence, July , 1939 and further experiments continue to be made.” One hundred and one years after that complaint was uttered, we still have enough vitality left in us to experiment and to grumble about it. Perhaps what we need most is appreciation of the evolutionary processes in economic phenomena in order that we may appraise experiments correctly and have a real understanding of economic growth. The construction industry, which has prospered in every phase of economic growth this country has enjoyed and has fabricated the physical embodiments of our economic progress, has been called a backward indus­ try. Some people even seem to regard it as being made up entirely of antiquarians, dumb­ bells, and racketeers. Professional housing experts, many of whom have never built a house, take the industry to task for not turning out a product for people who have no money. Wall Street statisticians are per­ sonally very much hurt that the industry does not jump immediately into assembly-line production of houses, when there is such an obvious statistical need for a boom. The term “ construction industry” is a convenient generalization which does not have the same kind of factual connotation that is implied when we speak of the “auto­ motive industry,” “ the petroleum industry,” “ the electric-power industry.” The term is sometimes used as though it included the processes of producing and transporting materials, as well as the process of assembling structures. Even in the field of structural assembly, there are two fairly well-defined sets of indus­ trial processes, one having many of the char­ acteristics of modern large-scale industrial enterprise, the other being characterised principally by survivals of individualistic, handicraft procedures and so overlaid with tradition and resistance to change, that it has shown very little progress. I will refer to these divisions of the industry hereafter as large-scale construction and small-scale con­ struction. 225 Large-scale construction gained its original impetus back in the 1890’s from such inven­ tions as steel-frame and reinforced concrete construction and the power-driven safety elevator. It met a large and rapidly growing demand for large industrial plants and for large urban buildings where maximum use of ground space seemed economically desirable. It is unnecessary to review the triumphs of engineering science that have expressed them­ selves in the design and fabrication of such projects as the Panama Canal, the West­ chester County Parkway System, the Golden Gate and George Washington Bridges, Boulder Dam, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, or practically any large modern industrial plant you can name. These structures are the admiration and wonder of the entire modem world. One of them, Rockefeller Center, was recently character­ ized by Mr. Henry Vandervelde, the famous Belgian architect, as one of the great architec­ tural achievements of all time. Similarly, M . Jacques Greber, noted French city-plan expert, has pronounced the Westchester County park and parkway system as the finest regional planning job in the world. The men who brought such great struc­ tures into being have all been technicians of the highest competence: architects, engineers, general contractors. All are essentially pro­ fessional men; even the general contractors, although they combine with engineering skill and organization technique the functions of business management. While professional status is officially and generally accorded to architects and engineers, it is not so generally recognized as belonging to those general con­ tractors who erect large modem industrial and urban type buildings and the more com­ plicated engineering structures. Yet those men (so long as they function as contractors) rarely initiate or finance projects, or produce buildings to sell or to operate for income. The volume of operations of particular archi­ tects, engineers, and contractors is subject very little to their own control; they do as 226 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin well as they can in the matter of maintaining permanent skeleton staffs, hoping for reasonable continuity of work. Many contractors also have considerable capital invested in construction equipment, much of which may lay idle a considerable part of the time. Generally speaking, each project is a customtailored job. It is the magnitude of the spe­ cific job that calls forth the economies and efficiencies of modem large-scale production. Generally speaking, the economies effected on such projects have been economies of organi­ sation, of operation, and of the time required for completing a project. The Empire State Building was constructed in eighteen months. During the World War, when army canton­ ments, industrial housing and other construc­ tion requiring maximum speed were required, the Government called upon the services of the executive heads of the big private con­ tractor organisations to do these jobs. Low unit costs have always been a factor in largescale buildings, but have probably counted most in factory and warehouse projects; most other classes of large-scale building projects have been quality jobs, involving a number of skilled handicraft trades, and planned for fairly high-cost uses. Mechanisation of processes has gone fairly far with respect to excavation and material handling, and there has been a gradual advance in shop préfabri­ cation. This modem professionalised large-scale construction industry has not, until recently, functioned to any considerable extent in the production of housing facilities. According to the Census of 1930, 76 per cent of the family dwelling units occupied by American families were in single-family houses, 12 per cent in two-family houses, and 12 per cent in multiple dwellings. Only a small fraction of the multiple dwellings were very large build­ ings, the average number of family units per building in 1930 being slightly under six. While many operative builders have produced quantities of small houses for sale, with few exceptions their building operations have not involved any really large number of new buildings in any particular year, nor any great degree of continuity of operations. Consider­ able numbers of the single-family houses that are produced for sale or rent are erected on the basis of one house per operation. Consequently, most housing facilities have been produced by the small-scale construction industry. The small-scale industry dates back to the beginnings of man-made shelter, and in respect to construction methods has made little progress in modern times, although great progress has been made in such acces­ sories as plumbing and heating and lighting equipment and similar conveniences and com­ forts. Consisting to such a large extent of small individualised operations, material and equipment purchases are generally on a retail basis. Even where stock plans are used, variety is frequently sought in external appearance, aiming at the effect of a custom job. The small-house builder is frequently a boss-carpenter or graduate from one of the other handicraft trades, or a former small-lot subdivider; he may be highly competent within the range of handicraft production of small houses, but only rarely has he had any­ thing approximating the professional tech­ nique of the architect, the engineer, or the large-project contractor. The operative builder who produces small house developments for sale has been, for the most part, a land speculator. As, during the evolution of urban communities, it became increasingly difficult to sell building lots, the addition of houses was made in order to sell the lots at a profit. This speculative tech­ nique was carried into the apartment field. Few builders of apar ment houses produced them with the intention of operating them for an income over an extended period of time, although they have frequently held them until they were fully occupied with paying tenants before selling the properties to investors. The need for planned community develop­ ments, providing housing accommodations with a preconceived relationship to school, July , 1939 transportation, and social facilities and em­ ployment opportunities has only received general recognition in recent years. Thus, the small-scale building industry has never commanded any considerable amount of working capital, has had no opportunity to develop modern research, no real bargaining power in the material or labor market. It has not yet become in any important sense a modem business; it is in many respects an archaic survival of ancient and medieval con­ struction techniques and nineteenth century management concepts. While real estate speculation has been con­ spicuously present as a motivating force in the large-scale construction industry, it has not so dominated it as to exclude business considerations. Factories, office buildings, department store buildings, hotels, large apartment projects, and the like, have had to proceed from careful analyses of their poten­ tial earning power as business enterprises. There have been noteworthy examples of large-scale enterprise in the housing field. The Fred F. French group of companies has produced more than $100,000,000 worth of rental housing accommodations in the City of New York. The affiliated companies of this organisation have included a holding com­ pany, a financing company, an architectural planning organisation, a construction organi­ sation, and a management company to operate the properties. The Queensboro Corpora­ tion, also of New York, has produced more than $50,000,000 worth of rental housing accommodations, although it has let out its construction on contract. The J. C. Nichols Development Company of Kansas City, the River Oaks Company of Houston, and the Roland Park Company of Baltimore are examples of well-capitalised companies which have produced planned communities of high quality as a matter of continuous operation over a considerable period of years; their projects have consisted principally of single­ family residence properties. These outstand­ ing exemplars of housing conducted as a 227 regularised business have until quite recently operated in the luxury housing field, where they found their greatest potential market. They have all recently engaged in lowerpriced operations, consisting both of rental projects with FHA-insured mortgages and individual houses for sale. In addition, there are such familiar examples of rental housing for middle-income families undertaken on a strictly investment basis, as the projects of the City and Suburban Homes Company projects of New York, the Wash­ ington Sanitary Improvement Company, the Washington Sanitary Housing Company, Chatham Village in Pittsburgh, and some of the limited-dividend projects under the pro­ gram of the New York State Board of Hous­ ing. These projects have to a considerable extent provided the pattern for the largescale rental projects that have been under­ taken with FHA-insured mortgages. The essence of investment housing is that it is undertaken for the sake of operating profits and equity appreciation over the years, rather than with the aim of a speculative profit from a quick sale. Initiation of such a project, therefore, is the nature of launching a business enterprise rather than a real estate speculation. Operation of a large urban or garden apartment project is just as much a business as operating a hotel. The buildings with the land and appurtenances constitute the plant; the merchandise sold is shelter, plus varying degrees of comfort and kinds of service; in the one case for transient tenants, in the other for occupants of longer tenure, usually on the basis of a lease. The concepts of housing as a business and as a field for investment (as contrasted with speculation) are daily gaining a wider and wider accept­ ance, although there is a great need for more education of the public as to the nature of these concepts, and as to the investment opportunities in this field. The earlier investment housing projects were mostly financed with the conventional sixty per cent mortgages, though two impor­ 228 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin tant ones, ChathamVillage in Pittsburgh and the earlier Metropolitan Life Insurance Com­ pany project, were wholly owned by one hundred per cent investment of institutional funds. The new Metropolitan project, also wholly owned, will be the largest single rental housing project in the country. It is perhaps significant that this project has engaged the services of the architects, engi­ neers, and builders of the Empire State Building. The inception of the FHA plan for insur­ ing mortgages on large-scale private enter­ prise rental projects thus found already in existence a pattern of investment housing, a construction industry entirely competent to build on as large a scale as needed, and a ready supply of mortgage money. Although the life insurance companies were a little slow in taking up these loans at first, they are now ready to make almost any rental-housing loan that meets the requirements for FHA approval. As of April 30, 1939, sixty-six of these projects were completed and in opera­ tion, eighty-seven were under construction and ninety-nine more had commitments for mortgage insurance. One of the earliest of these projects, Colonial Village in Arlington, Virginia, has proved so sound and profitable that it has recently been refinanced without mortgage insurance, the new mortgage being taken by the New York Life Insurance Company, which was the original mortgagee. The prin­ cipal obstacle, therefore, to more rapid prog­ ress in large-scale rental housing, has not been absence of construction technique, or mortgage money, but the absence of equity financing; there is as yet a dearth of men and money willing to go into the business of selling shelter service on a long-term basis. But their number is constantly growing. Large-scale public housing projects, built with government subsidies, have also made considerable progress in reducing unit costs, partly by setting up reasonably modest plans and specifications and partly by engaging the services of architects and contractors who have by careful study found more economical ways of building than were employed in the earlier subsidized projects. Thus far, large-scale production of single houses for sale has not developed on any grand scale. Perhaps we ought to give it time. We have expected it to develop through some spectacular invention of a patentable house to be rolled off an assembly line. When this happens, if it ever does, it will be in response to a market demand and to the pos­ sibility of quantity orders from the field. While large-scale production of small houses has not been the rule, it has been done. Mr. John H. McClatchy of Philadelphia was an apprentice in a company that was building six hundred houses a year as early as 1894, and has been continuously in the housebuild­ ing business for himself since 1900, since which time he has built and sold approxi­ mately ten thousand houses. Technical im­ provements in building, whether evolution­ ary or revolutionary in character, are more apt to come in a period of large activity than at a time when little building is going on. The market makes the opportunity. Evidence could be cited that small-house production as a regularized business is gradually coming into teing. Now, the people who at various times in the past hundred years thought the world had come to an end did not bring back prosperity with any synthetic miracles. They did not even know what was going to be the next big stimulus to economic expansion. The wailers of 1837 did not foresee the annexation of Texas, or the gold rush to California, and they probably looked upon steam railroads as interesting mechanical toys. The pessimists of 1857 did not foresee a settlement of the slavery problem, the establishment of a national banking system, or the building of western railroads. It was impossible in 1873 to forecast the rise of oil and steel and cement. Visitors to the Columbian Exposition in Chi­ cago in 1893 were awed by the twenty-two- July , 1939 story Masonic Temple building, but they were not even shown the laboratory expert ments that later produced the automobile. This great invention was still a rich man’s luxury in 1908. In 1908, no American knew that a World War would, in a short space of time, make us a creditor nation. Why should we today expect explicit road maps and charts guaranteeing a completely safe way to prosperity? There never were any new frontiers for those who did not have the frontier spirit. I recommend to students of business administration fewer charts, fewer explanations of the business cycle and more visits to the movies; if they must write dissertations, let them trace the spirit of American enterprise as shown in “ Covered Wagon,” “Man of Conquest,” “Dodge City,” “ Union Pacific” and “ Alexander Graham Bell.” For post\" graduate work, I suggest the New York and San Francisco World’s Fairs. During the past five years, slightly more than $12,000,000,000 worth of construction contracts were reported by F. W. Dodge Corporation for the territory covered by its field staff, the thirty-seven States east of the Rocky Mountains. This large total was practically evenly divided between public and pri­ vate work. During those five years, private work accounted for ninety-one per cent of the residential contract total, fifty-six per cent of the non-residential total, and ten per cent of the heavy engineering construction total. The six billion dollars worth of private contracts were let by more than five hundred thousand private individuals, firms, and corporations, whose names and addresses have been recorded daily by the Dodge organize tion. Since these private projects had an average value of only $12,000, the vast majority of venturesome people who made these commitments must have been people of moderate resources. A t any rate, here were half a million Americans who had sufficient faith in the future to assume large risks at a time when many business and financial leaders and economists and statisticians were telling 229 them the world had practically come to an end. The continuous increase that has taken place in private residential building since 1934 has been largely aided by FHA-insured mortgages, although not entirely financed in that way. This has caused some people to say that the residential building revival was artificially stimulated, a judgment I believe to be incorrect. Neither long-term amortized mortgages, moderate interest rates, nor invest­ ment housing is a new creation. It was just as necessary to change our lending from a pawnbroking system to a long-term credit system, as it was to change our basis of real estate appraisals from the speculative basis to the income basis. The mortgage-insurance feature, only novel device in the system, was necessary in order to override the limitations of restrictive state laws, so that uniform lend­ ing practices and uniform moderate interest rates might prevail throughout the country. This needed financial reform has broadened the area of business opportunity just as in earlier times the National Banking System and the Federal Reserve System did. In an important sector of finance, it has caused merchants of debt to become managers of credit. Since the FHA is neither a spending nor a lending agency, but draws out private funds for mortgage investment in small houses and large-scale rental projects, it seems to me that the progress this agency has made in stimulating residential building is a recovery factor of real and substantial proportions whose value cannot be discounted merely because it is an instrument of the Federal Government. Its current record of applica­ tions and commitments for mortgage-insur­ ance constitute one of the most important indicators of continued residential building revival. The public building and engineering half of the construction program of the past five years has represented an unusual proportion of the total and has been financed on an emergency basis; it did not exceed in actual volume the expenditures for public improve* 230 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin ments that were made in the preceding five years. The difference was in the extent of financial participation, and incidental central­ ised control, by the Federal Government. The states and local governments, with depleted credit resources dependent upon taxing depreciated real estate, could not have carried out unaided their improvement programs on their customary scale. While we cannot be sure that all public improvement projects that have been carried out with the stimulus of loans, grants, and work-relief programs are equally meritorious, the needs for community improvements to supplement and, in many cases, to stimulate, private construction throughout the country have been very great indeed, and have not been fully taken care of yet. The two reorganisation plans adopted by the Administration, one for consolidating the lending agencies, and the other for con­ solidating the construction agencies, are in principle, steps toward unifying these govern­ mental activities, toward abandoning emerg­ ency programs and adoption of long-term policies. I do not profess to know just how these mergers of functions should be effected, nor what the long-range policies should be. The problem is in both cases largely one of long-term finance, involving both private and public credit. On the side of public works financing, Mr. A. A. Berle has recently proposed the estab­ lishment of a Federal bank. Congressional proposals have included the possibility of the Federal Government’scontributing two-thirds of the cost to non-Federal projects, an amount that seems to me beyond all reason. Neither of these proposals has, so far as I know, been accompanied by any authoritative statement as to the potential capacity of states and municipalities to do their own financing. There is also a need to spread the new mort­ gage system beyond the housing field into other branches of real estate, and proposals for a National Mortgage Discount Bank have been urged. And, outside the field of con­ struction finance, we have heard proposals for facilitating capital loans to small business. While I am inclined to think that further adjustments are called for in the field of long­ term finance, it does seem to me that the time is past for piece-meal emergency jobs, or for major legislative enactments in the field of banking and finance on the basis of proposals by public administrative offices or govern­ mental advisers, without full consideration of the points of view of private finance and private business. It seems to me that the time has come for a broad objective survey of the country’s needs in the field of long-term finance, including analysis of the present functioning of private and public agencies; it should include a critique of the workings of regulatory agencies, as well as of lending and investment banking agencies, and of the municipal bond market. It should give equal consideration to the testimony of bankers, industrialists, big business and little business, economists and public officials. This could be done in a way to inspire confidence instead of promoting distrust, if a joint committee were set up by Congress following the pattern of the National Monetary Commission of 1908 (generally known as the Aldrich Committee) whose studies resulted in creation of the Federal Reserve System. Such a National Long-Term Credit Commission, paralleling the deliberations of a similar commission to study Federal, State, and local taxes, could accomplish tremendous results in completing necessary adjustments, supplying any new instrumentalities of finance whose need may be fully demonstrated, and removing such obstacles to recovery as may exist either by reason of governmental restrictions or inertia of banking institutions. I realise fully that the people of this country have tremendous problems to solve, and I would not wish to give the impression that I think all is right in the best of all possi­ ble worlds. It never was. But I do believe that the spirit of defeatism is dying out and that the recuperative forces of recovery are 231 July , 1939 strongly in evidence, very particularly in the field of private construction, a -very good barometer. Total contracts let for private construction during the first five months of this year in the thirty-seven eastern states amounted to $729,968,000, compared with $537,095,000 in the corresponding period of 1938, an increase of thirty-six per cent. During the same pe­ riod, public construction contracts amounted to $681,080,000, a thirty-four per cent increase over the first five months of last year. Residential contracts have run seventythree per cent ahead of last year; non-residential building and heavy engineering, each twenty per cent ahead. There can be little doubt that the year will close with a sub­ stantial increase in total construction over 1938. This is nearly certain to be the sixth consecutive year of increased total construc­ tion and the fifth of increased residential volume; the odds seem highly favorable for continued recovery progress. It would be foolish to minimize the gravity of our international, political, economic and social problems; or the fact that the construc­ tion industry itself still has important obstacles to overcome. We reached the boundaries of our geographical frontiers a couple of generations ago; and we arrived at maturity as an industrial nation between 1914 and 1929. But the job of making our country into a completely civilized nation, with better living conditions, and better com­ munities for our people and greater efficiency and economy in our productive and construc­ tive enterprises, has scarcely begun. Modern Lewises and Clarks have explored some of the frontiers of modern civilization, but no man has yet discovered the boundary lines. Per­ haps the frontiers do not disappear unt.l the frontier spirit is dead. I have tried to sketch for you the evolu­ tionary process by which basic real estate concepts and practices are changing, by which mortgage banking is being transformed into a modern long-term credit system, by which speculative housing is being turned into a business, by which the builders of Rocke­ feller Center, the Westchester County Park­ way System, the George Washington Bridge, Boulder Dam, and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Housing Project have begun to create the World of Tomorrow. I believe these phenomena to have greater significance than any mere listing or statistical compilation can indicate. I have not even had time to touch upon the new inventions, new materials, new machines, which will add their contributions to the American economy as recovery broadens and opportunities increase — that story is being much better told to millions of Americans at the two great expositions now in progress in New York and San Francisco. I have merely tried to present some evidence that the individual and collec­ tive will and energy and ingenuity of our people are not dead, that we have begun to demonstrate some of that initiative which in recent years we merely talked about. ■■mmb THE NEW SCIENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION MEASUREMENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS By CLAUDE ROBINSON We are accustomed to think of public opinion as a social force with which politi­ cians alone deal. As a matter of fact, business men have more public opinion problems than politicians for they deal with four publics to the politicians’ one, and account to these publics, not once at election time, but every day of the year. When a man is in business he answers to a customer public, a labor public, an owner public, and a general public. These publics are socially powerful. With the customer public, this power is mani­ fested on every hand. Each day in the market place an election is held. The buyers look at the competing candidates for the sale and express their choice by their purchase. The business man who gets very far out of step with the opinion of the consumer public suffers the terrible penalty of being voted out of business. Some have tried to defy the customer either by innovating too rapidly or by overstaying a once successful market, but the answer is always the same: the customer simply withdraws his vote of confidence and gives it to the competition. When the public wants a gear shift car, not even a Henry Ford can hold out against the demand. The labor and owner publics are, likewise, powerful. If they do not like the way a busi­ ness is being run, they strike. They withdraw their labor or capital from the enterprise and the business suffers. Business has had much experience with these publics, and it under­ stands the principles by which they operate. But the power of the general public — that is a relatively new experience for busi­ ness men. By the general public, I mean society as a whole — the public that gives the right to do business in the first place and lays down the fundamental rules by which the game is played. The power of this form of public opinion is dramatically illustrated by the sit-down 232 strike. In this country, in contrast to some totalitarian societies, we have the institution of private property. We believe that a man’s home is his castle, and we entrust ownership of property to individuals for exploitation under a set of rules governing the use of property. In 1937 these established rules of property were challenged in a revolutionary way. Workers seized plants and held them against owners and agents, until their demands might be met. For a time govern­ ment officials were undecided whether or not the sit-down was to be recognized as a valid labor technique. But the general public was not long in making up its mind. It said a stem “no” to this attempted change in the customs regulating the use of property, and the sit-down epidemic was shortly at an end. Suppose the general public had said “ yes” ; suppose this public had agreed that employes had the right to take over a plant or an office during a strike and keep the employer away until the workers’ demands were met. Then, gentlemen, however fantastic it may seem to you now, sit-down strikes would have become an old union custom, and business men would have been forced to accommodate themselves to this new way of doing things, or go out of business. The general public is the Supreme Court of society, as it were, from which there is no further appeal. In recent years the business man has felt the impact of opinion of the general public largely through government. In the economic demoralization that followed 1929, the public lost confidence in business leadership and turned to the politician and the instrumen­ tality of the State to reorganize social effort. The changes that have taken place as a result of the intervention of the State have been, in an historical sense, revolutionary. Govern­ ment has stepped in to regulate enterprises such as security exchanges; it has set minimum July, 1939 wages and maximum hours for workingmen; it has gone into active competition with utility companies in supplying electric light and power; it has reached into the pay envelope and the corporate treasury to establish a vast system of old age and unem­ ployment insurance; it has become banker to private and public enterprise; it has made it compulsory for the employer to deal with his employes collectively; it has given housing and food and grants of one kind and another to large segments of the population, creating a dependency relationship between the indi­ vidual and the State which heretofore had not existed in this country. Business men have been at their wits’ end in coping with this expression of the general public’s will. Some business institutions resisted change too long, and suffered the humiliation of being regulated from without rather than being allowed to clean house from within. It has been a difficult problem for business to know when to yield and when to fight; and it has been the more difficult because, by and large, business men have been too little schooled in the tactics or the language of the struggle for public favor. In this discussion of the relation of the business man to his several publics, I am not for a moment implying that he should be a yes man to any public. As a matter of fact, the public does not want yes men. What the public does want, and what the business man must be if he is to get on with his several publics, is a leader, an innovator, but a leader with a keen appreciation of what his fol­ lowers are thinking. Nowadays, as I shall indicate later, it has become possible to meas­ ure and chart the public mood objectively. If business is to supply social leadership it must work in some fair relation to that mood, neither too far ahead nor too far behind. The business leader must have firm convictions on fundamentals, but he must also be able to understand his public and speak to it in a language it can comprehend. In the absence of better techniques, busi­ 233 ness men have heretofore depended a good deal on hunch and impression or scattered reports, for their knowledge of what the public is thinking. This is particularly true with the labor, owner and general publics. With the consumer public, of course, the sales curve has provided a basic index of public opinion. This index, however, is not without shortcomings, for the sales curve does not tell why people are voting favorably or unfavorably on a product, nor whether they are in favor of or opposed to government regulation of the distribution of the product. In the case of the chain stores, for example, the sales curve gave no evidence whatsoever that a large segment of the population thought they were an alien influence in the community and monopolistic, and that they should be subjected to special taxes not levied on other stores. Another shortcoming of the sales curve as an index of consumer opinion is that where offers are controlled, sales may reflect the opinion more of the sellers than of the buyers. There are two things wrong with judging public opinion by impressionistic observation and hunch. In the first place, impressions may be wrong. An observer may judge the public’s mood brilliantly for a time, and then without warning run completely off the track. The process is a very subtle one. A little wishful thinking and a self-assured pronounce^ ment by a trusted friend are all it takes to do the trick. There is no alarm bell to sound when observations of public opinion are about to betray the facts. Having been right before, the observer is sure he is right this time. The annals of business are filled with instances of guessing the public wrong, and of failure to discover a shift in public taste before the competition has won patronage away. Some very interesting studies on this point were made by Arthur C. Nielsen. He asked executives of client companies to guess the public’s attitude toward their product before the sales figures were available. These guesses, according to Nielsen, were fifty-eight 234 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin per cent right. I have no doubt that, by and large, business men’s impressions about their own business are much more reliable than the same type of observations by outsiders, but the fact is that impressionistic observation as a technique for acquiring knowledge of what a public is thinking, has a very large margin of error. The second thing that is wrong with appraising public opinion by impressionistic observations is that equally competent observers may disagree on what are the facts. In situations of this kind, disagreements over policy are commonplace, because each school of thought starts with a different premise. The only sure way to reconcile these differ­ ences, is to appeal to an objective method for developing the facts. When this is done, differences over policy frequently disappear. Business men, by the nature of their calling, are schooled to face facts, and it is historically true that they have uniformly turned from hunch thinking to systematic analysis of facts whenever fact-finding techniques have been made available to them. Such a process of transition is now going on in the field of public opinion. Thanks to the development of modem methods of opinion sampling, business executives today are relying less on their bone marrow to tell them what the public is thinking and more on systematic sampling studies. There is much misinformation abroad about the methods of public opinion sampling and I should like, therefore, to discuss briefly some basic aspects of the technique. The central idea of opinion sampling is that the opinions, desires, customer prefer­ ences, and so on of any public can be deter­ mined by interviewing a few representative individuals of that public. The validity of the conclusions drawn from the sample depends upon three factors: the representa­ tiveness of the persons interviewed, the size of the sample and the system of interrogation used in the interview. If the social composition of the sample public is like that of the larger public, then it is valid to reason from the sample to the larger public. In sampling a population, for example, the sample is normally balanced for such factors as geographical area, sex, age, farm versus urban dwellers and income status. If a limited public such as buyers of a luxury product were being studied, then the sample would conform to the geographical peculiarities of the market, and particularly the income status of those included in the sample. Most mistakes in the interpretations of samples are directly traceable to the question of representativeness. The most famous example, of course, was the Literary Digest. In 1936, this magazine sampled the voting preferences of upper income owners of tele­ phones and automobiles and assumed that these preferences were representative of the whole electorate. They were not, of course, for the haves in the country are predomi­ nantly Republican while the have-nots are strong for Roosevelt and the New Deal. Today people vote in direct relation to their pocketbooks, not only in the market place but also at the polls, and the income factor there­ fore is of primary importance in determining the validity of a sample. So the first question that must be raised whenever a sample is being interpreted is: what does the sample represent? The second question, although a less important one, is: How many people were interviewed? The Literary Digest popularized the idea that millions of ballots were necessary to get an accurate sample. As a matter of fact, nations, states and trading areas are nowadays regularly and accurately sampled with from two to five thousand interviews. And it is a striking fact that some industrial concerns with hundreds of thousands of dol­ lars at stake have found reliable policy guidance in samples numbering only a few hundred cases. One does not sample opinion long before he notices great likenesses in the ideas of people interviewed. When added July, 1939 interviews fail to produce different opinion patterns, the opinion sampler knows that his sample is large enough. Beyond this point of stability it is a waste of time and effort to go. It is not enough, however, to reach repre­ sentative individuals in sufficient numbers to get a reliable opinion sample, for once the contact with the public is made the interviewer must interrogate the respondents in such manner as to elicit opinion that parallels behavior. This is a matter for great art and experience. The American people are very communicative, but to get desired informa­ tion from them, they must be handled correctly. It is necessary, in the first place, to inter­ view them about things in which they are interested or in which they are experienced. It is a mistake to assume that the public has an opinion on everything. Opinions elicited in a sampling study can be considered valid only if the topic touches the people’s interest. In further describing what makes for a good interview, the interrogation must never put the respondent in an unfavorable light, nor put a premium of self-esteem on the answer given to the question. In studies of magazine readership, for example, researchers run into this difficulty consistently. People will tell you they read the Reader's Digest and the Saturday Evening Post, but overlook mention of magazines about love or astrology. Interviewing problems of this type provide a real challenge to research ingenuity. Some time ago the American Institute of Public Opinion made a count of those who had read the best seller, “ Gone With the Wind.” Aware of the prestige nature of the book, the Institute phrased the question in such manner as to take account of this factor. It did not ask respondents, “ Have you read ‘Gone With the Wind’?” Instead, it asked, “ Do you intend to read kGone With the Wind’?” Everybody was flattered. The people who had read the book said they had read it, and those who never read books under any circumstances, but who like to be 235 in the swim, were given a pleasant oppor­ tunity to express their literary aspirations. One more observation on the technique of interviewing: Questions must be phrased clearly and concisely in words that are meaningful to respondents. Language is at best an imperfect instrument for communica­ tion of thought, for not only the meaning but also the emotional connotation of words varies with each individual. I once asked a simple question: “ Is the electric utility in your community privately or publicly owned?” Many people who were served by private power companies answered, “pub­ licly owned.” Upon investigation, we found people saying “ publicly owned” because the public owns the shares. The question was thereupon changed to read: “ Is the electric power system in your community owned and operated by the government?” Some words and phrases carry distinct emotional overtones either on the positive or negative side. People are generally for mother­ hood and against sin, in favor of helping the poor and opposed to going to war. Cliches of this type, therefore, must be avoided in asking questions of the public. To get a valid sample of public opinion, therefore, it is necessary not only to use skill in selecting people to be interviewed, but also to use skill in their interrogation. When these technical hurdles have been cleared, the infor­ mation from opinion samples can become invaluable as a practical guide to the trend of the public’s thinking. The growing recognition of opinion samp­ ling as an instrument of business is attested to in many ways. A number of large manu­ facturing and distributing organizations now have departments of consumer research with substantial budgets to discover and analyse consumer opinion. General Motors, for example, has its Henry Weaver who sends you those entertaining little picture ques­ tionnaires which enable you to vote on body design, location of gear shift, types of ventila^ tion and so on. 236 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin Procter 6? Gamble, to cite another exam­ ple, directs its whole merchandising program from the conclusions of its research. If a new toothpaste is to be put on the market, it finds out if the customers like it red or blue, or yellow or green, whether they like it flavored or unflavored — in short, what they want in the way of a dentifrice. If a skillet or a hair brush is to be used as a premium to stimulate the sale of soap flakes, the housewife is first contacted to find out what she thinks about it. Procter 6? Gamble pre-tests radio commercials and magazine advertising. Being the biggest users of radio time in the country, they care­ fully analyse listener habits and listener reac­ tions to the programs they offer. It is a tribute to the genius of Paul Smelser, who heads Procter 6s? Gamble’s research, that his company has regarded it as good business to increase its research budget year by year. Advertising agencies have increasingly turned to opinion research for guidance on advertising programs. What people read in newspapers and magazines, what they listen to on the air, what types of copy most arrest their attention, what selling themes stimulate them most to buy, are among the problems dealt with in this kind of research. In the publishing field, editors have more and more turned to readers for advice on what to print and how to print it. Following the reader interest technique developed by Dr. George Gallup, they lay their publica­ tion down in front of a subscriber and check, page by page* what he has read. Every arti­ cle, picture, advertisement, cartoon, editorial, etc. is given an interest rating. Through analysis of these reader interest ratings, the editor can confidently add a feature here and cut one there, thus bringing his publication closer in line with the readers’ demands. In the field of public relations, opinion research is making very rapid strides. In the absence of more objective techniques, public relations men have been compelled to rely on impression to determine how people feel about any particular issue, and again rely on impres­ sion to determine if their tactical maneuvers have actually changed the public’s thought. Nowadays an intelligently conceived public relations campaign is first preceded by a care­ ful opinion study — where are the centers of disaffection, is one group more pro or anti than another, what is the principal cause for complaint, what does the public think should be done about the situation? With these facts in hand, the public relations counsel maps a program. If disaffection can be elimin­ ated by change in trade or labor policy he recommends such change. If unfavorable opinion is based on misconception of facts, he uses the channels of publicity to correct these misconceptions. From time to time as his program is carried out, he tests sentiment to see what progress he is making in changing opinion. Opinion research thus objectifies much of the public relations counsel’s think­ ing; he is enabled to know his problem in detail at the start and follow it week by week as his program matures. There is an interesting corollary to this point. It is that through opinion sampling a client or sponsor can measure what he gets for his public relations dollar. A tremendous sum of money is spent in the United States each year on campaigns to change public opinion. Heretofore the success of these cam­ paigns has been judged by evidences of indi­ rect character. With modem statistical methods, public relations campaigns can be audited with a high degree of accuracy, and sponsors can see what they get for their expenditures. High grade public relations advisers, of course, welcome this develop­ ment, for it strengthens their position. Finally, regular opinion studies such as those of Dr. Gallup have contributed much to the business man’s understanding of social trends. Heretofore business leaders have been largely occupied with such problems as raw material prices, labor costs, inventories, depreciation, machine obsolescence and so on. Their aim has been to earn a dollar by pro­ ducing and distributing goods more cheaply. July , 1939 They thought that as long as they were suecessful in this, they could get along with their several publics. But the social ferment of the past few years has changed this. Nowadays business men not only produce goods and services of better quality at cheaper prices, but they must also justify themselves to the general public on social grounds. If they sell groceries at cheaper prices by quantity meth­ ods of purchase and distribution, they must convince the general public that they are not monopolistic, that they pay their labor fairly, and that they contribute something to the community as well as take something out of it. If business makes much profit, it must not only account to the tax collector but also explain to the public why it should appro­ priate that part of the social surplus. In a hundred and one different ways, the business man is faced with social pressures which before now never even entered his conscious­ ness. Opinion studies are helping him to understand these pressures and deal with them. In this discussion I have said that business men deal with several publics, that what these publics think makes or unmakes a business, that hunch and impressionistic methods of learning what the public thinks are giving way to systematic opinion sampling studies, and that research of this type is being used increasingly in merchandising, in advertising, in publishing, in public relations and, gen­ erally, in gaining understanding of social trends. Is this development of opinion research a fad that will pass when the mood changes, or is it a permanent implement of 237 business that will grow with the using? The logic of the situation, it seems to me, argues greatly in favor of the latter alternative. Opinion research deals with the most ele­ mentary force in society — the force that makes right and wrong, that sets codes and standards, that gives or withholds favors, that dictates the success or failure of any social enterprise, particularly a business. In dealing with this force, opinion research sub­ stitutes factual thinking for impressions and guesswork. It enables executives to end dis­ agreement as to what are the facts and devote their time to doing something about the facts. It makes possible the discovery of opinion trends at their inception, so that something may be done about them before the tidal wave of opinion engulfs an enterprise. It enables detailed analysis of opinion by geo­ graphical areas, by sex, nativity, age, by types of buyers, by membership in associa­ tions or ownership of product. It produces economies in that it eliminates fumbling in matters of policy. It makes possible the establishment of opinion time series whereby the direction and speed of opinion change can be measured in relation to events. The more business knows about its four publics, the more efficient it will be in serving these publics. The better its understanding of what the people think, the better its ability to fight off demagoguery and to supply social leadership that looks forward to higher and more equitable living standards for all. In promoting this understanding between business and the public, research is ready to make its contribution. PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANIES By ROBERT E. HEAL Y It is a great pleasure to be here with you at Harvard. This is one of the few occasions on which I have had the pleasure of returning to my native New England. I am here to discuss some of the problems of the public utility industry and to describe for you the effort which the Securities and Exchange Commission and the responsible leaders of the industry are making to restore sanity and soundness to the industry. This effort, as you know, has been fraught with dispute and attended on occasion by bitterness, and it is for that reason that I am particularly glad to discuss it here in New England where the conservative tradition is well understood and where the advocacy of old-fashioned honesty is not regarded as radicalism. I speak for no one but myself. I express no views but my own. The principle that to gauge the future we must study the past applies with particular force to the public utility industry. A t the Securities and Exchange Commission the prob­ lems of public utility companies come before us daily and in a great many cases the difficulty with which we must deal is the tangible heritage of an abusive practice of ten or fif­ teen years ago. A major defect of the public utility hold­ ing company systems was their tendency toward over-expansion and over centraliza­ tion. This tendency became most pronounced during the period between 1920 and 1930. These years were characterized by extreme and often disastrous competition of holding companies to acquire additional properties. Holding company representatives and pro­ moters combed the United States in search of municipal and private utility companies which •could be purchased outright or tied up with an option. Ambitious promoters put through many consolidations of small, locally owned systems into larger operating companies. There appeared to be no limit to the prices which could be paid for new properties or the extent to which anticipated profits could be capitalized. This point of view stimulated, and in turn was stimulated by, the great speculative frenzy which swept the country during the late 1920’s. Many of the holding companies were increasingly impressed with the ease of floating new securities through investment bankers, who were eager for com­ missions and profits on securities which could be sold to a public hungry for investment out­ lets and speculative opportunities. One hold­ ing company was piled upon another. Socalled investment trusts and companies were erected above the holding companies, equities were divided and redivided and subdivided over and over again; and at the bottom of this vast pyramid, depended upon to support themselves and everything above them, were the only companies which owned any physi­ cal properties or had any real earning power, the local operating electric and gas utility companies. In certain cases there were as many as eight subholding companies inter­ posed between the operating companies at the bottom and the holding company or investment company at the top. While these practices were not universal there were few that did not embrace the opportunity to extend their spheres of influ­ ence with the money so readily provided by the public. One of the major evils of the scramble for bigger systems and greater “empires” was the tendency to acquire new companies at figures far beyond reasonable values. Even as late as 1931, Samuel Insull caused the Mid­ land United Company to acquire control of the Gary Heat, Light and Water Company from the United States Steel Corporation at a price of approximately $23,000,000. At the time of purchase, the tangible fixed capital of the operating company was stated at about $7,500,000. Is it any wonder that July, 1939 the Midland United system became bankrupt and is still in the process of reorganisation in the Federal courts? Another instance was the purchase of the common stock of Eastern New Jersey Power Company, now Jersey Central Power and Light Company, by National Public Service Corporation, an Insull holding company, from Utilities Power and Light Corporation. The price paid, $15,620,100, included a profit of $8,898,848 to Utilities Power and Light Cor­ poration, although the profit was never realised in full. The buyer, National Public Service Corporation, subsequently became bankrupt and the seller, Utilities Power and Light Corporation, is in the process of reor­ ganisation in the Federal courts. You are undoubtedly familiar with other similar instances. There were many of them. They not only led to overcapitalised systems but they resulted in the illogical expansion of many holding companies. To prevent their recurrence in the utility industry of the future, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, established in Section 10 certain stand­ ards covering the acquisition of securities and assets by registered holding companies. Among other things, the price paid must be reasonable. It must bear a fair relation to the money invested in, or the earning capacity of, the utility assets to be acquired. To prevent illogical acquisitions in the future, it must be shown that the acquisition will serve the public interest by tending towards the economical and efficient development of an integrated public utility system. In view of the abuses which developed under the holding company system with its scattered properties, its absentee-management, and its pyramided control, the integra­ tion requirements of the Holding Company Act appear reasonable indeed. As you know, Section 11 (b) (1) of the Holding Company Act requires each holding company to con­ fine its operations to one integrated public utility system. The Commission, however, is required to allow the retention of additional 239 integrated systems, provided these addi­ tional systems can meet what are known as the ABC standards of Section 11. These standards are that — (a) Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system; (ib) All of such additional systems are located in one state, or in adjoining states, or in a contiguous foreign country; and (c) The continued combination of such systems under the control of such holding company is not so large (considering the state of the art and the area or region affected) as to impair the advantages of localised man­ agement, efficient operation, or the effective­ ness of regulation. Any company which can satisfy these conditions has a legal right to retain more than one integrated public utility system; other­ wise not. If the conpany has more than one such system, the burden seems to rest upon the company to demonstrate that it can meet the ABC standards quoted above. This determination is not a matter of mere discretion, nor is it one of Commission policy. The Supreme Court has said that administra­ tive agencies like the SEC can have no policy but the policy of the law. The application of that policy to specific cases, in accordance with the standards prescribed by the law, is one of the administrative tasks of the Com­ mission. Determination of the effect of Section 11 (b) (1) upon a specific company is as much a question of fact as it is a question of law. Section 11 provides that there must be a public hearing on the ABC questions. With­ out a hearing and evidence the Commission has no legal right to determine that a com­ pany has or has not complied with Section 11. But that question can be brought before the Commission in either of two ways. The com­ pany may file a voluntary plan under Section 11 (e) of the Act, or the Commission may institute a proceeding under Section 11 (b) 240 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin (1). In either event, it becomes the Commis­ sion’s duty to decide first whether the com­ pany has more than one integrated system and, if so, whether the company has shown its legal right to retain them by meeting the ABC standards. The most notorious of all holding company abuses was the write-up. In its most direct form the write-up consisted of marking up the figures at which assets were carried on books of account to higher figures, however arrived at. The same result was achieved in a less evident manner by causing one com­ pany to convey its assets to an affiliated com­ pany at a price in excess of the figure at which they were recorded by the selling company. Again, a merger or a consolidation of two or more companies under common control was sometimes utilised to accomplish a similar increase in the book value of the assets of the new company. The write-up also took other forms, but these were the most common. The methods used to explain the amount of a write-up varied. Some of them were claimed to be based on appraisals. The appraisal was frequently made by a closely affiliated interest or by an officer of the company. In other cases the value was fixed arbitrarily by a vote of the directors. Very few of them were sub­ ject to any check by governmental authority. The appraisal, when made, was often based solely on an estimate of what it would cost to reproduce the property. Many intangibles, items such as lawyers’ fees, costs of engineer ing supervision, interest during construction, goodwill or going-concem value, were fre­ quently included in this estimate. The fact that these appraisals were often made by officers of the company or by affiliated com­ panies and that they were seldom subject to official scrutiny cannot be overemphasised. In one system, for many years the appraisals were made by an apparently independent engineer who, it developed upon production of bank records under subpoena, deposited all of his fees in a bank account on which he could not draw. It was found that these fees were the property of one of the men who con­ trolled the system. The engineer was on a salary paid by that man. On the basis of appraisals made by this “ independent” engineer the book values of properties on this system were written up many millions. The effect of legal concepts in connection with reproduction cost new for balance-sheet pur­ poses may be seen in this same system, where the overhead allowances made by this same engineer in his appraisals were discarded and the higher ones which had been recommended by a special master in a gas-rate case were substituted. The system was not involved in that case and the allowances had been approved, not by an appellate court, but by a United States district court in a decision which has been infrequently followed. This change alone added many millions to the appraisal. Varying dispositions were made of write­ ups. In some systems they were credited to a surplus account against which dividends sub­ sequently paid were charged, thus resulting, in some instances, in the payment of divi­ dends out of unrealised appreciation. In other systems they were credited to a capital surplus account against which losses were charged, thus relieving the income accounts of the company. Very often unamortised debt discount was charged against a capital surplus so created, thus increasing the reported earnings of the company in future years. There were instances where the write-up was used as a basis for additional security issues. Securities were thereby issued against “water.” In a very few instances these secur­ ities were sold directly to the public, but in most cases they were delivered to a holding company which issued and sold its securities against them, so that indirectly many securi­ ties that were based on inflation or write-ups were sold to the public. The Federal Trade Commission investiga­ tion found that the ledger values for the capital assets of the holding and operating July, 1939 companies examined included a substantial amount of write-ups. The examination covered 18 top holding companies, 42 subhold\" ing companies, and 91 operating subsidiaries. The 91 operating companies had capital assets of $3,306,893,000 which included write-ups of $599,329,000 or 22.1 per cent. This percentage, computed on the basis of the assets as of the dates of examination of each company, would have been materially larger if computed on the basis of the assets at the time such write-ups occurred. The Federal Trade Commission also found evi­ dence of further write-ups in the amount of $264,000,000 for other operating subsidiaries, as disclosed in connection with the examina­ tion of the holding companies concerned. The introduction of write-ups into balance sheets through the use of reproduction appraisals was based upon a misconception of Smyth v. Ames, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1898. That was a rate case in which it was held that a rate imposed on a railroad which prevented it from making a fair return on the present value of its property was confiscatory. The Court said: We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the pres­ ent as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for con­ sideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the prop­ erty. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. (Italics added.) 241 And from one clause in the Court's dictum — “ the present as compared with the original cost of construction”— has sprung the “reproduction cost new minus depreciation” theory of fair value. That one short phrase has profoundly influenced the economic life, perhaps the history, of this nation. I know of nothing in law or accounting that justifies the recording of estimates of reproducing property new on books of account. Smyth v. Ames does not justify it: first, because that case dealt only with ratemaking and the confiscation issue, and, second, because even under that decision an estimate of reproduction cost was only one of several elements to be considered. A rate base, under certain decisions of the Supreme Court, is required to reflect the present fair value of public utility properties for rate-making pur­ poses. And since such value has no immut­ able character these decisions also recognize that altered circumstances, such as a change in the general price level of commodities, may necessitate a change in the base. The rate base, and consequently the rates, can be adjusted to changing conditions. But once securities are issued and sold on the basis of an estimate of the cost of reproduction (espe­ cially if as here the estimate is made in a time of high prices) the loss must be absorbed by the investors, and the loss cannot be avoided merely by restating the value of the proper­ ties. Such a restatement is usually made in the process of a painful reorganization, and in the meantime many of the investors have been compelled to dispose of their securities and suffer severe losses. The view that Smyth v. Ames in some way justifies the recording of reproduction esti­ mates on books of account and the issuance of securities of an equivalent amount is based upon a distortion and misapplication of that famous decision and has done incalculable injury to the public and to the utility industry. I am glad to report that some companies have embarked upon a comprehensive pro­ gram of reorganizing their capital structures. 242 Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin For example, one of the largest holding companies has begun to work out a program for restating its capital account and that of various subsidiaries. The program is based upon studies of the companies in the system with the following objectives: (1) To obtain as accurate a figure as possible of original cost of all property; (2) to identify and to obtain facts about every transaction which resulted in a debatable bookkeeping entry; and (3) to analyse the surplus accounts. Several of the companies in the system have filed applica­ tions with us to obtain approval, on the basis of the facts so ascertained, of a restatement of capital and creation of a special capital sur­ plus. These special capital surpluses, in addition to surpluses as of December 31,1937, may be used to absorb all debatable items which any of the companies find necessary to remove from their accounts, or to write their properties down to original cost, should that become necessary. In this way, it is reason­ able to hope, the capital structure of compan­ ies in the system will be adjusted so that they can economically finance their requirements and confidently face the future. Some of the utility holding companies indulged in unsound accounting. Such con­ duct may not have been characteristic, but it was sufficiently widespread to be an impor­ tant problem. In part, many of these practices resulted from attempts to make up for the consequences of bad fortune or of reckless or improvident management. Where utility holding companies were heavily overcapitalised, there often resulted very strong pressure to find the income neces­ sary to pay interest or dividends on an exces­ sive amount of securities. Moreover, such companies were pressed to maintain their financial standing and prestige and were eager to make a good showing as to net income and to pay dividends in order to sustain or improve their credit. One of the principal means of meeting this situation was to make inadequate provisions for depreciation. A similar practice, often employed not only by operating companies, but also by holding companies, where bond issues had been made at a discount, was to neglect the proper annual amortisation charge. The payment of dividends from capital sur­ plus or from an entirely fictitious surplus was sometimes resorted to. Another device was to take up on the books of the holding com­ pany the earned surpluses of subsidiary companies without any disbursement of them by those companies and to charge holding company dividend payments against such a surplus. Another was to create profits, and ‘ create” is the very word for it, by transfers from one subsidiary to another. Another great problem of the past in the utility industry, and one with which the Holding Company Act deals vigorously, was the siphoning off of profits through service, management and construction contracts. In general, these contracts provided that the holding or a wholly owned subsidiary com­ pany would, for a fee, manage or supervise the management and construction work of the other companies, usually operating utility companies in the same system. It became a feature of the holding company system, even though not all the holding companies made a practice of it. In a few instances, however, there were indications that a holding company system was promoted principally to create a source for these fees. There were many instances where the operating company paid for services far more than they were worth. In two systems the operating companies paid fees to a service company controlled by such systems and this company hired the service from an outside concern for a lesser amount and pocketed the difference. After the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation brought some of these facts to light, certain large holding company systems, sensing earlier than others the trend of public opinion, created servicing companies mutually owned by the operating companies. Some of these management companies per­ formed useful services for the operating July, 1939 companies. However, they were managing their own properties and making a good profit so doing. The large profits obtained through service contracts would not have aroused widespread criticism had such contracts been made between strangers in interest rather than between companies under common con­ trol. This common control from which arose many of the other abuses, already pointed out, inevitably gave rise to the suspicion that service contracts, dictated as they were by the holding companies, were forced upon the controlled subsidiary companies making it especially difficult to decide such questions as the worth of the service to the operating company, and the real need of the operating company for outside management. Not all such fees were exorbitant or unearned. How­ ever, the unearned fee was a fraud on the senior security "
