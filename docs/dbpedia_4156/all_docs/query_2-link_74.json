        "text": "Tag Archives: reason to run\n\nTried, Tested & Abused – Altra Timp 5\n\nThe new Altra Timp 5 boasts maximum comfort for spending all day out on the trails. Accelerate Community Run Leader Carlton has been putting them to the test in Peak District. Continue reading to find out his thoughts on Altra’s new cushioned trail shoe\n\nStraight out of the Box\n\nTaking these shoes out of the box, I was immediately struck by the bright colours: these luminous yellow ones are not for those wanting to blend in (other colours are available).The shoes look big both in terms of the wide toe box and ample midsole cushioning but I found them surprisingly light: my size 8s were just 277g on the scales. They are well designed for trail running with a reassuring toe guard, a flexible lacing system and a gusseted tongue to stop debris getting inside.\n\nI was initially perplexed by the loop at the front of the laces and the Velcro tab on the heel but apparently these accommodate gaiters. I’m sure this might be a useful feature for some, but I have never heard of anyone running in gaiters so it did seem a bit unnecessary.\n\nThe Vibram sole is as colourful as the upper. The 4mm lugs are well spaced and I was interested to see how they would cope with really muddy paths.\n\nFirst Run\n\nFeeling slight conspicuous in my new fluorescent shoes among the grizzled runners of the Peak District, I went out for a 10km trot around Stanage Edge over a variety of paths and terrains. The shoes were a perfect fit for my shoe size and the spacious toe box let my feet spread and breathe while the combination of laces and fitted heel held me snug and secure throughout the run. I was initially concerned that the side of the shoe came up quite high and would rub my ankle but this didn’t happen as I scampered around.\n\nThese are zero drop shoes and the lack of elevation at the heel is not something I am used to. I noticed the difference it made to my running form as I found myself less likely to heel-strike and this improved my steadiness particularly when the ground was unpredictable.\n\nThe thick midsole proved extremely comfortable, offering lots of bounce and a surprising amount of stability which helped me feel more confident running on the uneven terrain. The outsole really held onto the gravel paths and forest trails. Despite all the cushioning, I found the shoes quite responsive and nimble over roots and more technical rocky sections. I was surprised at how grippy they proved to be on the particularly muddy parts of the run and having been submerged numerous times, how quickly the water inside displaced.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese shoes are very comfortable and soak up bumps on the trail while remaining pleasantly responsive. Combined with the roomy toe box, the shoe is really well suited for long runs. Although, I’m not sure what they would be like if I was wearing gaiters at the same time!\n\nHow do they sound?\n\nThe men’s can be found here >> and the women’s can be found here >>. Or if you are not quite convinced, pop down to the Accelerate Running Store and try a pair out for yourself!!\n\nThe Saucony Xodus Ultra 2\n\nAccelerate Community member and Accelerate Trail Runners Run Leader Graeme is back again and has been lucky enough to get his hands on another pair of the Saucony Xodus Ultra’s, but this time it’s version 2. Now available from the Accelerate store, to find the specs of the shoe Click Here >>. Keep reading to hear how he got on!\n\nI reviewed the Saucony Xodus version 1 back in May 2022 and have now done over a 1000k on them – The review on the version one can be found Here>>; this review is a comparison of that version so I’ll focus on the differences I’ve noticed after ~50k with runs on mixed terrain (tarmac to fell) ranging from 7k to 26k. I’m being a bit picky.\n\nStraight out of the box\n\nThe upper is stiffer, less stretchy — more protective I suppose — so I was unable to tighten it up in the same way over my lumpy feet. That said, I did this last time as I thought they were slightly too big – same size this time and they didn’t feel too big – certainly for longer runs where feet need to expand. The forefoot is spacious as before. The laces have changed too – round and quite chunky, not the original stretchy, flat ones.\n\nThe ride feels firmer than before – but the sole has not changed! So it must be me: too used to my now slipper-like v1s – after 20-30k they feel as before, so it was me. Very comfortable in both heel and forefoot.\n\nThat upper…\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that there seem to be two versions of the upper – and this is not just a colour thing – mine are a claret colour – interesting – all others I’ve seen are grey. On inspection the grey ones have a different (softer?) upper, more akin to the v1, plus the inner forefoot gusset seems to be of a lighter / thinner material, plus the laces are the flat stretchy ones. Most unusual. In summary the grey ones are much more like the v1s but are still a more robust material. The inner gusset now covers the whole forefoot – the v1 had it just around the mid foot.\n\nThe upper foot shape has changed a bit – see comparison photo – and there is now a useful looking rand around the whole shoe next to the sole – to protect more I suppose. My concern was that it would keep water in – didn’t seem to make any difference, which was good. The change in upper shape may be holding my foot more naturally, requiring less tight lacing.\n\nI can only really comment on my claret version but personally, I prefer the previous material but I like the new foot shape change and the welt – I’d prefer a softer, thinner material as previously it only started to fail on me after 1000k, so not bad.\n\nConclusion\n\nPros: new grey colour looks good; same plush ride but with good ground feel.\n\nCons: check out if you want the claret or the grey style; the upper may be a bit stiff for some.\n\nSummary\n\nFundamentally the same as the version 1 with a more robust upper. My go-to, long run shoe again.\n\nYou can find the Men’s Here and Women’s Here.

Spoiler Alert, Dot smashed the out of the water. Find out how she got on below!\n\nGrangemouth, 16th April 2023.\n\nNamed after Jim Dingwall (1949-2005), one of the finest Scottish runners of his generation*, the Round the Houses 10k road race in Grangemouth was the setting for the British Masters Championships for the second successive year.\n\nA weekend in Edinburgh in glorious spring sunshine, a walk up Calton Hill and a tour of the Botanic Gardens provided a splendid preparation for the BMAF 10k road race. A short journey up the Firth of Forth towards Falkirk on Sunday morning brought us to Grangemouth for a lunchtime race organised by the redoubtable Falkirk Victoria Harriers. Everything you might hope for in a race, a stadium start and finish, large sports hall for meeting organisers and friends and a fast, flat course round the houses to enjoy in pursuit of a good finishing time, nice T shirt, chocolate egg and if at all possible a British Masters medal.\n\nMargo Duncan, Sheffield Tri Club and I, the Sheffield contingent, met athletes from all parts of Scotland and the north of England to catch up on news of achievements, injury and illness and then, with our age group printed on card and pinned to our backs so we could view our competition on the line, tipped out onto the track for a warm up lap or three in mild Spring conditions.\n\nThe race took us round and out of the stadium and directly onto the road for an anti clockwise circuit round a housing estate finishing with a run through an adjoining park before re entering the stadium for an 80 metre dash on the track to the finish.\n\nThe usual jitters about pre race nutrition and hydration were played out. Too little and you’d be gasping; too much and you’d have the lead stomach to contend with. In the event I relied on a jam sandwich and water an hour before the lunchtime race. It seemed to do the trick. I started with a steady pace resisting the temptation to chase Margo who was way ahead almost immediately. One by one I focused on runners with similar pace to try and pick them off. Eventually I saw Margo ahead so put all my energy into levelling up and even briefly overtaking her at 8k. She urged me on but clearly saw the chance to chase me down in the final stages and came haring past at 9k as we returned for the final push to the finish. It’s great to have a friend to race against. We used each other for motivation and finished the race with Margo, V50, slightly ahead on the line in 47.14. I kept the elastic as short as I could to finish in 47.20. That gave me first V70 by a good five minutes and BMAF V70 Champion 2023. That chocolate egg tasted very good once I’d recovered from the post race nausea.\n\nThe race was won by Daniel Bradford, Shettleston Harriers in 31:03.\n\nFirst woman was Jennifer Wetton, Central AC in 35:48.\n\nDot Kesterton was first V70 in 47:20 chip.\n\n*Jim Dingwall achievements: 5000m -13:48. 1975.10,000m- 28.45. 1978.10 miles- 48:05. 1985. Marathon- 2:11:44. 1983.\n\nTried, Tested & Abused: Altra Lone Peak 7\n\nIt’s not very often that I get to write a review. Coming across any type of shoe in a size 14 can be hard work. When it came to getting my hands on a pair of the new Altra Lone Peak 7, I was excited for a new experience on the trails.\n\nSpecs\n\nTrail running\n\n0mm Drop 25mm stack height\n\n314g in men’s 8UK\n\n262g in women’s 6UK\n\nStraight out of the box\n\nWow, just look at the size of them. I know it shouldn’t surprise me but it just amazes me how big they actually are. Sliding them on, my initial thoughts are they feel great. They feel very spacious in the toe box which allows my toes to relax while still having a secure fit around the heel. When lacing them up they feel very lightweight, like I’ve got nothing on my feet. Which I appreciate as I’m already quite a big heavy lad.\n\nFamously, Altra are known for their zero drop shoes. This is something that I haven’t tried before and I and looking forward to giving it a go. Now it’s time to get them onto the trails!\n\nFirst few miles\n\nFor my first test run in the Altra Lone Peak 7, I hit the trails of a very muddy Rivelin Valley. They felt plush under foot and could handle everything that the valley threw at them. From loose gravel to boggy water logged paths, they got me through with ease.\n\nThe spacious toe box feels amazing as my feet can splay out naturally. The MAXTRAC rubber lugs and a new outsole pattern gives fantastic grip and traction in thick mud. The Altra Ego midsole feels very responsive which makes the ride on the trails go by like a dream, not needing much effort!\n\nAfter about 7k down the valley, they felt just as good as when I first put them on. No aches, no rubbing, a shoe I would happily wear all day.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter a few more runs up and down the valley, they still feel just as good as the first run. The wide-fitting toe box and well cushioned midsole giving them a great level of comfort. Making the ride feel like a dream no matter the trail. This is complemented by the MAXTRAC rubber lugs which have given me confidence that I won’t slip even on wet and muddy trails.\n\nIf you looking for a wider-fitting shoe to take you on most trails, the Lone Peak 7 should definitely be on your list to try.\n\nYou can find the Men’s Here and Women’s Here. Alternatively, pop on down to the shop and give them a try.\n\nTried, Tested and Abused, the On Cloudgo\n\nTeam Accelerate’s resident marathoner Andy Shelton has had the chance to test out the newest in the On Running lineup, the Cloudgo. Andy admits to being a big On fan and has had “possibly every running shoe they have released since the brand started.” Keep reading to hear his thoughts on their latest creation and if its a thumbs up from him.\n\nThe On brand has continued to grow and develop its range of running, hiking, and lifestyle shoes over time. I am constantly surprised at the innovation that they have been putting into their new shoes. Each year On Running manages to design a running shoe that exceeds expectations and consequently shuffles my ranking of On best shoes.\n\nSo far this year, On has already overdelivered with 2 new running shoes that have wildly stood out. These stand-out On running shoes include the Cloudmonster (for running long and comfortable), and now the CloudGo (for easy training and longer runs)\n\nSo here is what is going on with On’s latest addition….\n\nIt’s most certainly an understated running shoe from On. When I opened the box I didn’t really expect much from it just by judging the exterior of the shoe.\n\nWell after using them, I was wrong!!! OK, I was partly right in my judgment because the Cloudgo really doesn’t have one stand-out feature or unique selling points that target it to a specific type of runner. Surprisingly, this is exactly what makes the Cloudgo one of those shoes that, put simply, does everything well without trying to be too much.\n\nThe Cloudgo is a neutral, medium-width shoe, and the toe box feels airy – so if your midfoot, and toes are average width then the Cloudgo should feel great in the toe box. It’s a similar feel to the Cloudsurfer.\n\nIt has a medium arch that sits ever so slightly more towards the front of the shoe than I’m used to with On running shoes but they feel extremely comfortable right out the box like On shoes generally do. If you’ve worn On’s before and enjoy the feel, then the Cloudgo won’t disappoint, it will likely impress because On has made some great improvements to the cushioning around the heel, and tongue area.\n\nThe Cloudgo feels similar to the earlier updated Cloudstratus, in terms of padded cushioning and comfort in the upper, and also the cushioning underfoot to some degree.\n\nThat’s a good thing by the way because in both these shoes I enjoy running long distances on concrete and asphalt. The outsole used for the On Cloudgo is quite unassuming but the multi-directional micro-tread patterns mean they can hold their own in wet conditions very well, trust me as they offer plenty of grip, when the conditions aren’t good. The Cloudgo works well on mixed terrain too, including gravel, hard-packed dirt, and very light trails.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend wearing them on technical trails as the tread just doesn’t have the lugs to support uneven terrain., but they have even changed the depth of the lugs underneath, so they aren’t stone grabbers anymore.\n\nThis isn’t the bounciest, most fun ride of all the On Running shoes, however, that title still belongs to the On Cloudmonster. Check out the previous review I did here if you really want to turn up the fun while running.\n\nThe Cloudtec pods in the Cloudgo are large and as supportive as the Cloudstratus , although the Cloudgo is a lighter shoe with a bit less cushioning in the midsole, and a lot like the Cloudsurfer in terms of how they feel underfoot.\n\nThis understated performance makes it tricky for me to put a finger on what actually makes this shoe so good. The only thing I can really say is that they just work well, without trying to be anything ground-breaking. On have gone back to basics and have ultimately created a relatively simple yet effective running shoe that JUST WORKS WELL!\n\nOn a personal note, I love the design. As I said earlier though, there’s nothing all that flashy about them, they are comfortable and perform extremely well.\n\nOn Cloudgo upper is made with sustainable recycled materials. I really like the little details on these running shoes, from the streak of white lines that run all around them, to the almost camo pattern in the mixed weave/stitching pattern that you can see in the orange parts of the upper. The mesh material used for the On Cloudgo upper is quite thick, comforting, and surprisingly breathable. The shoe is made with 30% recycled materials while the upper is made with 90% recycled polyester. The material used for the interior is very soft on the top of your feet which is so important if you’re planning longer runs in these.\n\nThere are areas in the upper that have been protected with strips of ‘no-sew foil’ which will firmly hold fabrics together without the possibility of materials fraying. Everyone will appreciate every move the On brand makes to help improve sustainability in the manufacturing process.\n\nMy final conclusions are these, how do I describe the feeling of the Cloudgo: unassuming, reliable, and comfortable!\n\nThis is one of those running shoes that you can rely on, is unassuming, yet performs to very high standards.\n\nIt’s a workhorse you can rely on which allows you to get in plenty of training miles in total comfort.\n\nPROS\n\nVery comfortable out the box.\n\nOne of those shoes that JUST WORKS. I like how they haven’t been over-engineered.\n\nUnassuming yet a high performance shoe – I find myself running faster than usual.\n\nMedium cushioning gives them comfort and responsiveness – this makes them great for half marathon and even marathon running.\n\nVery reasonably priced for such a workhorse of a shoe that just does it all well!\n\nCONS\n\nThe design looks a bit unassuming – some will love that; others may prefer something else.\n\nI’d like to see more daring colourways. But this is a personal thing.\n\nGet here pair today you can find the Men’s here and the Women’s here\n\nScott Pursuit, Tried, Tested and Abused\n\nMy name is Will and I have been running with the Accelerate team for around 4 years now. I enjoy all types of running but am currently studying in Manchester, so do a lot of my training on tarmac and in parks and will be reviewing the Scott Pursuit. Keep on reading to find out my thoughts!\n\nStraight out of the box\n\nStraight out of the box the shoes felt plush and cushioned. The soft tongue and laces made it easy to get a good lace lockdown in the shoe, stopping my feet from slipping around. The 30mm stack height and rocker shape of the shoe did feel unique, especially after running in more minimal shoes like the Saucony Kinvara before, but I quickly got used to this and liked it. I run in a UK size 10 and have found the Pursuits fit true to size. I also like the different colourways (grey-black-lime green, blue-orange and dark green in men’s sizes, and navy-yellow, green-red and purple in women’s sizes) which is always a bonus!\n\nFirst run thoughts\n\nFor my first run in the shoes, I did an easy 6-mile loop from my house. The soft midsole of the shoe was really comfortable running on a mixture of tarmac and dirt trail. Despite the cushioned feel of the shoe, they felt snappy and responsive. The rocker shape of the shoe helped me to promote an efficient midfoot strike and by the end of the run, I had no aches or pains which I sometimes suffer from with inefficient foot placement. The shoes felt snug and secure throughout the run. They were stable and grippy on slightly wet tarmac and soft trail but wouldn’t be appropriate for a muddier trail. The shoe is designed primarily for road running but can handle dry, non-technical trails.\n\nDespite running less than 50 miles in the shoes so far, I have done lots of easy runs, an 11-mile long run, a fast Parkrun and a 12 x 400m session in them. The shoe is not designed as a racer but it has nevertheless felt comfortable and fast for all the types of running I have thrown at it. The shoes were also quick to break in, any initial stiffness alleviated after two runs in the shoe.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Scott Pursuit is the best all-round running shoe I have used. From fast sessions to long slow runs, this shoe fits the bill. Using the shoe, I have been able to run further and faster with less fatigue the following day.\n\nThe men’s can be found here and the women’s can be found here.

Keep reading to find Andy’s thoughts on the new Aion Next Gen below.\n\nWho are true motion, and what are they about.\n\nTrue motion is a German based company whose ethos is putting the runner first. No fancy gimmicks, they are using science to help people enjoy running and stay injury free.\n\nAre the shoes different, yes, they are and for this reason they are wanting to make shoes that are as comfortable, natural, and efficient as possible.\n\nSo recently I have been asked to take the Aion Next Gen shoe and put it through it paces. As people know I’m an Ontm fan and have a large rotation of stability and carbon plated shoes.\n\nIs this shoe going to be different, I’m not a stranger to True motion as I have a pair of the Solos in my shoe rotation, and I have been very impressed with overall robustness of that shoe. I have ignored all the sales talk about the shoe, and this is what I think.\n\nStraight out of the box\n\nThey look neat and tidy, looks a well-made shoe, with nothing flashy about it, a pure shoe for running.\n\nLove the colourway as it is nice and understated.\n\nI took the shoes on a few runs furthest was about 16km and how did the shoe feel, all I can say is that they were a joy to my achy feet. Comfort is the buzz word and comfortable they are, this is due to the more cushioned U-Tech midsole which offers up a really soft landing.\n\nThe 3D MotionBridge structure also extends around the heel of the shoe for enhanced security and support. The outsole incorporates rotated TrueFlex flex grooves in the front of the shoe which enhance comfort when you push off from your toes. The sustainable Regrind Rubber outsole offers excellent traction and durability, so it gives confidence in the wet (it was raining heavily during the test)\n\nThe fit of the shoe was excellent, it felt stable and really secure on my foot, and it nice to know that the material used in these shoes is from sustainable resources.\n\nWho do these shoes suit, in my opinion anyone, if you going to buy the shoes, I would go up ½ a size as this will help your feet and toes, with the little upsizing you will benefit from the extra cushioning. U-Tech Aion (Next Gen) is True Motion’s most luxurious, premium feeling shoe and is an excellent addition to your running shoe rotation, it is excellent for any runner looking to treat their feet kindly on easier or steady-paced runs.\n\nThe Aion Next gen specs are as follows:\n\nWeight: 270 grams (slightly lighter than previous models)\n\nDrop: 10mm\n\nU-Tech structure centres forces applied during the gait cycle\n\n3D MotionBridge structure helps transfer energy and offers a smooth transition\n\nOverall conclusion\n\nYou aren’t going to go super-fast in these shoes, as they aren’t the lightest of shoe as they aren’t designed for this they are for long easy steady runs, these are definitely a road shoe.\n\nFor comfort and running enjoyment these are definitely for you, and you will not be disappointed as you will get lots of happy miles running in the Aion next generation.\n\nAre you sold on them and want a pair right now?\n\nThe men’s can be found here and the women’s can be found here. Or if you are not quite convinced, pop down to the Accelerate Running Store and try a pair out now.\n\nMore information about the True Motion and their range can be found Here.

A dozen reasons why I won’t make the start line. With emerging consciousness comes a breath of relief. I’m in the right place at the right time with the right kit, well prepared and have done my homework as thoroughly as I can. Despite the nerves I’m looking forward to it.\n\nBristol, a bit hilly like home and made rich on the back of slavery sits in late summer sunshine with a breeze off the sea as I walk to the start. I do wish the ‘England’ on my vest sat as comfortably as the ‘Wales’ on the other home international athletes, proud of their heritage. There are times when I’m simply ashamed to belong to a small island nation with small, minded leaders.\n\nThe race was organised by England Masters Athletics. The qualifier was Leeds Abbey Dash last October so here I am 11 months later in my new V70 age group to pound city centre streets in search of a new title. The route, snake like in the route map, winds around the Avon, through a small park, over unfriendly cobbles and finishes in Millennium Square, a large pedestrian area overlooking Spike Island and the river. Around 240 England Masters 35+ years old were at the head of a large group of runners looking forward to the Great Bristol 10k.\n\nTim Rafferty, fellow Sheffielder warming up for the half marathon after the 10k calls a greeting. it’s so good to see a familiar face among a sea of strangers.\n\nMy race goes well in that I find my pace in the early stages and settle to around 4.40mins per k. That should bring me in among the leaders without blowing up. Breathing is manageable and my legs are strong. Through the 5k point at 23.22 minutes so if I can hold onto it, I’ll be in around 47 minutes. It would be good to magic up a sprint finish but that eludes me, so I stumble in breathing hard in 47.30 chip time. At that stage I don’t know if I’m leading the age group or not, so it comes as a great relief to learn that I’ve led the group from the outset. Friend and rival, Anne Dockery, a formidable duathlete is next in around 50 minutes with the remaining V70’s a little after.\n\nWe relax and chat over the post-race presentations as people from far and near celebrate their achievements. The Masters winner was Matthew Rees, M35 in 31.33. First woman was Helen Gaunt, W40 in 35.41. Full results can be found at Here>>\n\nDot Kesterton, W70\n\nTreadmills, the Saviour of Winter Training.\n\nLove them or hate them, come the cold mornings and long and dark nights of winter they can be incredible in keeping your running mojo going. As the age-old saying goes, winter miles = summer smiles. Here at Accelerate, we are lucky enough to work with Noble Pro and have both the Elite 8.0 and Elite E8I, If you are looking into getting a treadmill this winter pop down to the store where you can try both out!\n\nWe have put together a top 5 list of the best reasons to hop on a treadmill this winter.\n\nRunning in the Warmth: In my opinion, the worst parts of running in the winter has to be the cold. With a treadmill though, you never have to leave the warmth of your home. When everyone else is piling on tights and jackets while you can be happily trotting along in shorts and a vest. No fear of the cold creeping in and a reduced risk of pulling a muscle due to the cold.\n\nConsistent footing: If you are, like me, a fan of getting out early for your run, then you may have noticed frost and ice creeping across the pavements turning smooth tarmac into an ice-rink. Jumping on the treadmill and there is no chance of slipping on ice.\n\nLighting: Night’s drawing in, and many runs in the cover of darkness. Running at night is a valid safety concern. The opportunity to run with others isn’t always an option. No longer do you have to worry, the treadmill is the answer and much safer than running alone at night.\n\nTraining benefit: Let’s not forget the training benefit you can have from training on the treadmill. Program in the speed you want to run at and no longer do you need to worry about having to slow for other pavement users or stop at traffic lights. Broken intervals and stop/start runs are a thing of the past.\n\nEntertainment: Boredom, this certainly isn’t the upside to treadmills. With the great Noble Pro Treadmills and their built in TV’s. Why not make the most of it and catch up on your favourite TV show, film or podcast, even pop on an album you have been meaning to listen to. Checking your watch to see if you are almost done is a thing of the past, and runs getting longer is the new norm.\n\nAnd finally, hop off and you are already home, winner!\n\nDon’t be mistaken, on a sunny winter’s day I love getting outside to run, but come wind and rain the treadmill is the place to go.\n\nAfter reading this do you think a treadmill will help take your winter training to the next level? Pop down to the store and try one of the Noble Pro treadmills.\n\nThe Accelerate Running Store is working in collaboration with Noble Pro Treadmills, acting as a local showroom. You can get in touch to make an appointment to see, try and find out more about their range.

The latest entry from Saucony in the carbon shoe battle happening right now. If you head to any busy running area you are bound to see at least a couple of people wearing carbon plated shoes.\n\nEver since the first few companies released carbon plated shoes and amassed a cult following, PB’s and world records started dropping like flies. Until now I haven’t had a pair, so when the Endorphins bounced through the door I was very interested to see if the hype they had built up was really worth it.\n\nThe first thing that hit me out the box was “WOW, these are a flippin good looking shoe”. Bright and bold colors just catching your eye. Yet still maintaining the same look of current running shoes unlike some of the carbon shoes out there.\n\nSlipping your foot into them, they are comfy but not plush. They use Saucony’s FormFit to wrap around and hold your foot firmly in place. The upper is lightweight with no added extras to\n\nmaintain a racey feel. Its made with a single-layer engineered mesh upper which is highly breathable to keep your foot cool and drain any water or sweat with ease.\n\nThe midsole is Saucony’s latest and greatest PWRRUNPB foam a peba based foam. It claims to be super responsive and cushioned but with the longevity of a standard midsole (500 miles). Sandwiched in between is an S-shaped carbon fiber plate, there to fire you forward with every step. Couple this with Saucony’s new Speedroll meta-rocker and it has the potential to be a very fast shoe. It comes in a whopping 35.5mm stack height in the heel and 27.5 in the forefoot for an 8mm drop. Not quite your traditional racing flat.\n\nTo finish it off the outsole use a minimal amount of high carbon rubber compound and exposed midsole to keep them down to a featherweight 213g (UK size 9)\n\nJust jogging up and down in them is a very odd sensation. They feel very soft however, you can feel the plate sandwiched in them as if you are running through mud then hit firm ground. Then roll onto the toe and snap forward. Very strange. But not bad at the same time just very different from anything I have used before.\n\nThe first proper opportunity I got to use them was a 3k time trial with some of Team Accelerate. I was excited, to say the least, after hearing all the stats that have been thrown about the Endorphin and other shoes like it. Were they really 4% more efficient than a standard trainer? Well…….\n\nThey are bouncy, very bouncy. The combination of soft and springy foam along with the carbon plate results in a shoe with a lot of pop. They feel fast, one of the biggest changes I noticed was how much longer I felt like I was in the air after each stride, almost floating. Now I know they are meant to be a marathon shoe but after 3k my legs felt as if they hadn’t done much not sore or tight even when coming down the small hill in the course it didn’t feel as if they were pounding my legs, still just bouncing along.\n\nI know this was only 3k but still for longer races they certainly could come I handy to keep you feeling fresher even in the later stages of a race.\n\nIn short, if you can get hold of a pair then 100% go for it, they are an amazing shoe. They make you feel fast and want to run faster! For anything from 10k and above they are an incredible shoe. The one you pull out on race day when you want to rip it and break PB’s. Get a pair here >> today, alternatively take a look at the Endorphin Speed, a more forgiving racer/ quick trainer, here >>\n\nMy personal fitness regime in lock down.\n\nHarry who regularly runs with running past 50 on a friday and attends parkruns every saturday shares how he has stayed fit when all of his normal outings are gone.\n\nWeek 8 and have not been outside the gate. This not because of Coronavirus phobia but because my wife is on the government extremely vulnerable list for the virus.\n\nI do not have dumbbells or a yoga mat but what I do have is a furnished house and a garden. You do not need a gym to keep fit. So how have I managed?\n\nDaily routine consists of 10-minute workout in private in the bedroom. Starts with spinal stretches. Can nearly touch my toes. Hamstrings are held taut and stretched by placing a foot on a chair. Hips are swung without shoulders moving. Shoulders swung with hips held firm. Dressing table is pressed into action for bicep and triceps dips. Even though it is only 08.30 am out comes the gin bottle. A litre bottle of Tanqueray Gin weighs 1.602kg. (at the start of the week.) Useful for developing upper body strength, mainly bicep curls. The bedroom rug doubles up as a yoga mat for sit ups.\n\nWalking around the garden I can resist re-enacting a scene from John Cleese the Ministry of Funny Walks sketches. High kick walk. Then opening and closing the hip gate as I progress down the path. Amuses the neighbours whom I am sure wonder if I am losing sanity as isolation continues. To add to their entertainment, I run a mile around the garden each night. 30 to 40 m of ascent depending on route. So many twists and turns that it takes at least 22 minutes of strenuous effort. PB 20.05 all comers welcome after lockdown is over.\n\nAdd to this routine Sunday I act as house fairy. Hoovering is a brilliant exercise. Use those Abdominal muscles. Move furniture, Weight lift on the stairs. Put in the occasional star jump. Bee bop to music whatever but the job gets done. Windows are washed, requiring step aerobics as well as upper body work out. Even watching TV or working at the computer induces the odd chair squat\n\nTwice weekly 2 kg of bread dough are kneaded. Shoulder ache after this 20-minute workout.\n\nThe outdoor gym AKA the Garden then becomes my focus of activity most days. A wealth of equipment here. Electric mower that needs pushing. Hedge cutter waiting to be used. Barrows of compost to be shovelled and lifted. Land drains to be dug up, unblocked, and then relayed. Essential tree surgery using hand saw and loppers from the top of a ladder. Seemed as if every muscle group was used as I soaked my aching body in the bath.\n\nI just have strength left for the final exercise of the day. To lift and then extract cork from 1.134kg bottle of Chardonnay.\n\nHopefully, lockdown will finish soon, and I can resume my normal restful exercise routine namely a daily 2-mile walk, The Over Fifties Running Group on Fridays, and Park Runs Saturday. Despite all the above or perhaps because of it time flies past and I feel FIT and EXHAUSTED\n\nReasons to run, The Health Benefits of Running\n\nThe second installment from Harry Smith in our Reasons to run series, a retired GP and keen runner who regularly attends Running Past 50 on a Friday morning here at the Accelerate store. Harry shares the medical benefits of exercise and how it can keep you healthy and strong whatever your age.\n\nThomas Edison 1847 – 1931 said “The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will involve the patient in the proper use of food, fresh air and exercise.”\n\nRunning is one of the best ways to keep fit and boost your overall health. It is a social activity enjoyed in an outdoor environment by thousands.\n\nThe Health benefits are numerous.\n\n1. Cardiovascular System ‘A runner must run with dreams in his heart.’ – Emil Zatopek\n\nThe heart is a muscle and like any other muscle in the body benefits from regular exercise. Exercise lowers blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major causative factor in heart attacks. Good HDL cholesterol transports fat away from the arteries and back to the liver for processing is increased by exercise which may also reduce levels of bad LDL cholesterol which causes arteriosclerosis, Arteries therefore retain their elasticity.\n\nThis increase in cardiovascular health is asso ciated with a decrease in the incidence of strokes, heart attacks and coronary heart disease\n\n2. Respiratory System “Just breath.” Author unknown\n\nOur lung capacity naturally declines with age. Exercise can increase lung capacity by 5 -15% (lung capacity is the amount of air your lungs can hold after one inhalation). Running thus leads to increased efficiency of the lungs better facilitating transport of oxygen to all body cells leading to better stamina and more work for less cardiorespiratory effort.\n\n3. Muscular Skeletal system. “Be fluid and elegant in your movements.” Anonymous\n\nRunning and running coaching especially can improve joint strength, mobility, and function. Muscles are strengthened and bone loss reduced. Core exercises train muscles in the pelvis, lower back, hips, and abdomen to work in harmony, leading to better balance and stability in daily activities.\n\nSufferers from arthritis also benefit from appropriate exercise reducing pain and increasing range of movement. The incidence of falls is reduced.\n\n4. Weight Loss. “Sweat is just fat crying” anonymous.\n\nExercise is the key to weight control. Running for one hour can burn 400 calories. Running is the second-best exercise for burning calories, only second to cross country sking. However, for losing or maintaining a constant weight a balanced diet is also required. Exercise also lowers the incidence of diabetes by 50% by allowing muscles to better process glycogen, afuel for energy. Impaired processing of glycogen leads to excessive blood sugar and thus Diabetes\n\n5. Psychological “Exercise equals endorphins. Endorphins make you happy” Anonymous\n\nBeta-endorphin is released into the circulation from the pituitary gland during exercise,This improves mood and promotes a feeling of wellbeing thus boosting confidence and self-esteem.\n\nSetting and achieving goals can give a sense of empowerment that leaves one feeling happier so fighting depression and stress.\n\nRunning is good at increasing social interaction since the running community has many supportive individuals and clubs.Aging is delayed as brain cognitive functions are maintained and decline prevented. New brain cells (Neurogenesis) are also created. There is an increase in vocabulary retention. with better decision making and learning.Miscellany Exercise has also been shown to have the following effects\n\nThe immune system is boosted.\n\nReduction in risk of breast cancer.\n\nBetter sleep pattern\n\nIncrease production of growth Hormone which is required for cell regeneration and growth and maintenance of healthy body tissues.\n\nIn summary. Running is incredibly beneficial to the body and the mind. It can leave you feeling more energised, fitter, more focused and better able to enjoy all life has to offer.\n\nPromoting regular running will bring us nearer to Thomas Edison’s prediction."
