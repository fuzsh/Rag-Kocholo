        "text": "Rand McNally published children's books starting around 1913. Below are several of their books published in the late 1930s and early 1940s. including # 239, 383, 384. These books measured 5 x 6 3/4 inches. In 1947, after seeing the huge success of the Little Golden Books, Rand McNally began the Elf Books. The elf books were 6 5/8 x 8 3/4 inches, closer to the size of the Little Golden Books. They also later published the Junior Elf Books, which were a smaller size similar to the earlier books, as well as the Tip-Top Elf books and the Start Right Elf Books.\n\nIn assessing my books, I have tried to clarify when various editions were published. It appears that some of the early titles from the late 1930s and early 1940s were later reissued as Junior Elf Books. An example is The Three Wishes, #415 and #8061 below. The first, #415, was published in 1945, before the Elf Books began., and was 60 pages. The cover reads A Rand McNally Book. The second, #8061, seems to be essentially the same book. The copyright is 1945, as the text is the same, except the font is smaller, and several sentences have been removed in the interest of length. The illustrations are also the same, although some have been removed to shorten the book. The resulting book is 28 pages. Also the cover has changed and is labeled a Rand McNally Junior Elf Book\n\nThe cover on the Elf books had an elf in a box in the top left corner. Introduced in 1959, the Tip-Top Elf books, featured an elf standing on a globe. In 1966, the Start-Right Elf books had an elf sitting reading a book in the same corner."
