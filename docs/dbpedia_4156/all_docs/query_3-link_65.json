        "text": "About the artist\n\nBorn in 1902 and passing away in 1990, Molly Brett was a well known English author and illustrator, famous for her anthropomorphic artwork in children's literature. Known formally as Mary Elizabeth Brett, she was raised in Surrey and was the daughter of esteemed animal artist, Mary Gould Brett.\n\nMolly Brett's ability to give her animals a realistic appearance, despite often dressing them in stylish, dapper clothing fit for Savile Row, was a unique talent. Her art education originated with a distance learning course in illustration, followed by formal education at Press Art School and the Guildford Art School.\n\nDuring her time at school, she developed a deep friendship with Margaret Tarrant and began her career with one of her first assignments: illustrating stories by Enid Blyton. She continued to write and illustrate a total of 21 books for the Medici Society, an association that lasted 60 years.\n\nOver 500 of her artworks have been published by Medici in the form of greeting cards, postcards, and prints. She upheld the tradition of other 20th-century illustrators like Beatrix Potter, Margaret Tempest, and Racey Helps who also excelled in creating smartly attired animal characters."
