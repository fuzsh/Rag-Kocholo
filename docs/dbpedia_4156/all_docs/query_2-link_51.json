        "text": "Born on November 24, 1974, in Bristol, England, Stephen James Merchant is a remarkable figure in the world of entertainment. Renowned for his towering height and wry wit, Merchant has etched his name in the annals of comedy, television, and film. He began his journey into the world of performance at the University of Warwick, where he studied Film and Literature. It was there that he ventured into radio, hosting a student radio show, which sparked his interest in broadcasting. His talent and perseverance eventually led him to a career at the BBC, where his life took a significant turn. Stephen Merchant's partnership with Ricky Gervais proved to be a game-changer. Their collaboration resulted in the creation of the groundbreaking mockumentary, The Office, where Merchant served as the co-writer and co-director. The series became a cultural phenomenon, earning numerous accolities, including Golden Globes and BAFTAs. Not just resting on the laurels of The Office, Merchant continued to flaunt his creative prowess by co-creating and co-writing the hit television shows Extras and Life's Too Short, both of which received critical acclaim. Apart from writing and directing, Merchant also showcased his acting talents. He starred in the critically acclaimed HBO series Hello Ladies, based on his stand-up comedy routine. Additionally, he voiced the character Wheatley in the popular video game Portal 2, further expanding his versatile portfolio. His directorial debut in the film industry came with Fighting With My Family, a biographical sports comedy-drama that was well-received by audiences and critics alike.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell (February 3, 1821 – May 31, 1910) was a British physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, and the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer, and pioneered in promoting education for women in medicine. Her contributions remain celebrated with the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal, awarded annually to a woman who has made significant contribution to the promotion of women in medicine.Blackwell was initially uninterested in a career in medicine especially after her schoolteacher brought in a bull's eye to use as a teaching tool. Therefore, she became a schoolteacher in order to support her family. This occupation was seen as suitable for women during the 1800s, however, she soon found it unsuitable for her. Blackwell's interest in medicine was sparked after a friend fell ill and remarked that, had a female doctor cared for her, she might not have suffered so much. Blackwell began applying to medical schools, and immediately began to endure the prejudice against her gender that would persist throughout her career. She was rejected from each medical school she applied to, except Geneva Medical College, in which the male students voted on Blackwell's acceptance. In 1847, Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States.Blackwell's inaugural thesis on typhoid fever, published in 1849 the Buffalo Medical Journal, shortly after she graduated, was the first medical article published by a female student from the United States. It portrayed a strong sense of empathy and sensitivity to human suffering, as well as strong advocacy for economic and social justice. This perspective was deemed by the medical community as ”feminine”.Blackwell also founded the New York Infirmary for Women and Children with her sister Emily in 1857, and began giving lectures to female audiences on the importance of educating girls. She also played a significant role during the American Civil War organizing nurses."
