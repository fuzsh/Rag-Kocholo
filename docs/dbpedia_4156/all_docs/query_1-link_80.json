        "text": "Dark Skies at Gnaraloo\n\nHere at Gnaraloo, we see the importance and benefits of having Dark Skies over wilderness areas.\n\nWe support Gnaraloo’s listing as a Dark Sky Reserve as it fulfills the requirements set out by the International Dark-Sky Association for such a reserve. This will also support the protection of the Gnaraloo Bay and the Gnaraloo Cape Farquhar Sea Turtle Rookeries.\n\nLight impacts on sea turtles\n\nResearch shows that light pollution alters animal behaviours such as mate selection, breeding cycles, foraging ranges, detection of resources and navigation (Davies et al. 2013).\n\nDuring the breeding season, adult female sea turtles return to the beaches in the area where they were born to dig nests and lay their eggs generally during the night. They can be easily disrupted whilst digging their nests, or even discouraged from emerging all together, along busy touristic beaches with lots of movements and artificial lighting. This is detrimental to the survival of turtles. When disrupted during a nesting attempt, a turtle may decide to abandon the nest and re-emerge a few days later to nest again, using more energy than was initially needed which may negatively affect her during her long migratory journey back to her foraging and resting home grounds. Roughly two to three months after the female has laid her eggs, the hatchlings are ready to make their way to the ocean to start their new lives. As hatchlings depend on the natural light horizon to navigate their way to the ocean, artificial lighting on beaches causes many hatchlings to become disorientated, moving towards the bright lights rather than towards the ocean (Lorne & Salmon, 2007) and leading to their demise.\n\nLight impacts on migrating birds\n\nMigratory bird species have also been known to become disorientated and confused by the increasing light pollution along their natural migratory routes, with species that migrate nocturnally being especially affected (Verheijen 1958; Poot et al. 2008). A phenomenon known as positive phototaxis suggests that some species are attracted to the artificial lights and that both visual cues and a magnetic compass mechanism are used for orientation (Emlen, 1967; Emlen et al. 1976; Poot et al. 2008). Some scientific studies have found that birds were more attracted to the artificial lights on overcast nights than on clear nights as the birds could not use celestial cues, therefore depending more on magnetic compass orientation (Cochran & Graber, 1958; Avery et al. 1977; Evans Ogden, 2002; Poot et al. 2008). This has led to individuals straying far off course when they were attracted by large cities or offshore installations, leaving the individuals depleted of energy.\n\nLarge aggregations of migratory birds visit Lake MacLeod at Gnaraloo each year and may be impacted by artificial lighting.\n\nReferences\n\nBoldogh, S.
