        "text": "Freda,\n\nYou were an awesome friend you treated me like family and called me your daughter too even though I wasn't your daughter. You always made me feel wanted. I remember Bob and I going down your house every Sunday for dinner and then playing bingo, it was so much fun. I have sooo many good memories of you. I will miss you I know you are in a better place and free from pain. Give mom a hug from all of us. My heart goes out to my brother in law Joey, all the grandchildren, great grandchildren, sisters, son, daughter and all your friends and family. You were really loved by everyone and will be missed you will always be in our hearts forever. I love you and I will never forget you and our talks.\n\nLove,\n\nRuth\n\nI love you very much mommom..you were an amazing woman and you loved with all of your heart. I want to say that you raised great children who I am proud to say that one of them is my father. Uncle joe is also an amazing man. You made my father into who he is..so I guess in a way..I am who I am because of you. Even though I miss you very much. I am glad that you are not in any more pain. I love you <3\n\nJoey, my heart goes out to you in your time of grieving. I know no matter what anyone says, that it will not take away the pain and emptiness of losing your mother. I have a few memories of Freda, but I think one that sticks out the most is going to a Cash Bingo with her. She loved her Bingo, and I know that she loved you and your girls so much. My deepest sympathy is with you and your family.\n\nTracie, I am so sorry for your loss. Words seem to escape as I sit here trying to think of what to say to make it better. I'm remembered of when I lost my grandmother, the Saturday before Easter in 1996, and just spending time with you helped so much. I'm so sorry for your loss, but hope that you and your family will find comfort in knowing that she's not suffering anymore. Knowing they're at peace is what helps you to somehow get through it. My deepest sympathy is with you as well. Love ya!\n\nTracie and Holly\n\nI am sooo sorry for the loss of your mom-mom but she is in a better place now no pain and happy. She is up there with mom-mom Haines now catching up with the grandchildren and great grandchildren and the rest of the family I can just hear them laughing and having fun. Mom-mom was a amazing person she was a kind sweet loving person and loved her family. She loved playing cards with the sisters and playing bingo with us. We have sooo many memories with her that will live in our hearts forever. She loved her great grandchildren Caitlin, Bethany and Evan She was so much fun. I am here for all of you anytime day or night.\n\nSherry and Joey\n\nMom-mom was amazing person she was more then a mom-mom she was like a mom too she helped raise you two. She gave Sherry a beautiful wedding and help Joey with his too all in the same year. Sherry I'm glad you were there taking care of her, you were her nurse and she loved it she felt safe with you there, a jack of all trade nurse, medicine,cooking, cleaning etc it's hard to get a nusre like that. She loved Nathan he was her helper always working in the flower beds puling weeds and mulching. You are a really strong person taking care of your mom-mom you never left her side being that sick and in sooo much pain. You both have sooo many memories that will be in your hearts forever. She will live forever in your hearts and will be looking down on all her family and friends. If you ever need anything I am here for you both.\n\nLove,\n\nRuth"
