        "text": "Thomas Gainsborough (1727–88) was born in Sudbury and baptised at the Independent Meeting-House in Friars Street on 14 May 1727, the fifth son and ninth child of John and Mary Gainsborough. In 1958, Gainsborough’s House Society was formed to purchase the house and establish it as a centre for Thomas Gainsborough. The Museum opened to the public in 1961 and has remained open for over 50 years. The beautiful historic garden at the heart of Gainsborough’s House is maintained by a devoted body of volunteers. In November 2022, the museum re-opened to the public after a transformational refurbishment. The international centre for Thomas Gainsborough is now the largest gallery in Suffolk.\n\nGainsborough’s House Society , Charity No. 1170048 and Company Limited by Guarantee No. 10413978"
