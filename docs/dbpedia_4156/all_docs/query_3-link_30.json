Molly Brett's particular skill was to make her animals look thoroughly naturalistic, despite their often being depicted in snappily tailored outfits that would look perfectly well in Savile Row.\n\nMolly began her art training with a correspondence course in illustration, followed by formal instruction at Press Art School and the Guildford Art School where she became close friends with Margaret Tarrant. One of her earliest commissions was to illustrate stories by Enid Blyton. She went on to write and illustrate 21 books of her own for the Medici Society, with whom she was associated for 60 years. Medici has published over 500 of her paintings as greetiogs cards, postcards and prints. Her work follows in the tradition of other 20th Century illustrators of smartly dressed animals such Beatrix Potter, Margaret Tempest, Racey Helps and others. Molly Brett born 1902, died 1990.\n\nMolly Brett Gallery of paintings"
