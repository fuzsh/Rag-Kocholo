        "text": "During the 2013 revision of the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation (IUCN), a new lemur strategic conservation plan was developed. Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals, and the strategic plan will provide guidance to preserve this biodiversity.\n\nPrimate experts, including Dr. Louis, determined that 90% of all lemur biodiversity now exists within 30 priority sites in Madagascar. These sites were selected due to the presence of critically endangered species and significant threats to remaining habitats. Four of these sites are key locations for Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership. At these locations, intensive emergency surveys have been ongoing to develop baseline levels of threat and remaining biodiversity.\n\nRealizing that sustained preservation is only possible with local participation, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership has designed its conservation efforts to be community-based. The following highlight some of the work being done at the Zoo's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership's priority sites:\n\nAnalamazaotra\n\nKianjavato\n\nAntsiranana\n\nLavavolo\n\nAnalamazaotra\n\nReintroduction and Translocation Project\n\nThe Analamazaotra Special Reserve is an evergreen rainforest, which is a short, three-hour drive from Madagascar's capital city of Antananarivo. This reserve remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Madagascar due to the guaranteed opportunity to view quite closely the Indiri, the largest remaining lemur.\n\nHistorically, the reserve was part of a continuous forest that included Mantadia National Park to the north, Maromizaha Classified Forest to the southeast and Anosibe an'ala to the south. However, due to habitat destruction, the four forests are now relatively isolated yet remain home to vast biodiversity, including many endemic rare and endangered species.\n\nThe endangered Diademed sifaka and the critically endangered black and white ruffed lemur were once among the fauna found in Analamazaotra Special Reserve. In 1973, hunting pressures led to the regional extinction of the Diademed sifaka. Three years later, the black and white ruffed lemur followed. Although forest management regimes have improved protection efforts of the forests, not all of the voices of the forest have returned.\n\nDr. Louis and his field team were recruited by Madagascar National Parks and Eaux et FÃ´ret (Malagasy Forestry Service) to initiate the first-ever attempt to recover a species' former distribution in Madagascar. In January 2006, after more than four years of planning and adherence to the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) guidelines, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium initiated the Analamazaotra Reintroduction and Translocation Project by re-establishing the Diademed sifaka and black and white ruffed lemur back into their historical habitat range within Analamazaotra Special Reserve.\n\nThe collaborative multi-disciplinary project has evaluated the biomedical, genetic, habitat, nutritional and reproductive parameters through the daily monitoring of 34 radio-collared translocated/reintroduced lemurs, including 26 Diademed sifaka and eight black and white ruffed lemurs from nearby forests. These translocated lemurs created new groups and have produced numerous offspring in the following years.\n\nThe project has succeeded by re-established the wild lemur populations, collecting data, preserving fecal samples for hormone analysis, increasing protection within the reserve and habituating the re-introduced groups to human presence. These introduced lemurs, taken from threatened populations or small, unsustainable forest tracts, are doing so well that visitors have been lucky enough to see three generations of babies born at the park. This project has also helped the Malagasy community through the training of Malagasy doctorate and graduate students and local field guides and educating the local communities about the biodiversity of their local eco-region.\n\nKianjavato\n\nLargest Multifacted Conservation Effort\n\nIn the last five years, Kianjavato has quickly become Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's most significant and comprehensive conservation effort. The program incorporates multiple lemur monitoring intiatives, a regional community-based reforestation effort, as well as the introduction of alternative technologies that reduce the pressures on the natural habitat while improving the quality of life for participating residents. The program is based out of the Kianjavato Ahmanson Field Station, which serves as a community center, teaching hub and site for the introduction of new technologies and procedures.\n\nAye-Aye Research Project\n\nAlthough well-known for centuries, the aye-aye's reclusive lifestyle has limited our understanding and knowledge of its ecology, demography and population genetics in natural populations. This nocturnal lemur with unusual traits, including an elongated, thin, highly flexible middle finger leads a solitary life.\n\nAye-Ayes have the largest species range of any existing lemur. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is active at two sites that represent aye-aye habitats across the eastern geographic range of the species, the humid primary forests of Kianjavato and Torotorofotsy.\n\nDue to the demand of the forests they call home, aye-ayes may especially be vulnerable to extinction due to deforestation.\n\nFour local guides, hired and trained by the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership, follow the elusive primates through the forest and collect data regarding demography, habitat use and food resources. Our monitoring program has been utilizing radio collars to monitor these elusive lemurs since 2010. Radio collars allow for the collection of GPS data, which allows for the estimation of home range sizes. We currently follow three adult males and one female, named Bozy, who gave birth to her second baby in June 2013.\n\nGreater Bamboo Lemur Monitoring\n\nThe greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) in the humid forests of eastern Madagascar is critically endangered. In fact, it ranks among the top 25 most endangered primates in the world and, at one point, was even thought to be extinct. Its rediscovery in 1986 in Ranomafana was one of the leading factors in designating the area as a national park. It was simultaneously rediscovered in the Kianjavato coffee plantation, an area that currently harbors the greatest concentration of the species. Once widely distributed across vast areas of the country, massive deforestation and hunting have resulted in dwindling numbers of greater bamboo lemurs. An estimated 300 individuals now remain. However, a successful program implemented by Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership in the villages of the Kianjavato Commune is helping to reduce hunting and is rallying local support for the lemur's conservation.\n\nA team of international volunteers and local field guides track individuals of this endemic and endangered lemur species daily, collecting a variety of data. The program is conducting a comprehensive study on the population genetics of the greater bamboo lemur, which is keystone information in developing effective in-situ conservation plans. For this project, non-invasive techniques are used, relying on fecal samples instead of tissue as the source of DNA. This means less stress on the lemurs, less expense and the ability to make a research team of Malagasy residents and provide modest amounts of training.\n\nVarecia Monitoring\n\nBlack and white ruffed lemur populations are found in the forest fragments surrounding the commune of Kianjavato. This lemur species is listed among the 25 most endangered primates in the world due to habitat loss and hunting. This monitoring program instilled by Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership involves a team of international volunteers and local field guides to track individuals of this endemic and endangered lemur species daily to record diet, home range and social interaction observations. This monitoring will aid in determining the populations' genetic health and habitat management.\n\nAs with the greater bamboo lemur study, the Varecia study is comprehensive, looking at the population genetics of the black and white ruffed lemur, a vital component for developing effective in-situ conservation plans. For this project, non-invasive techniques are used, relying on fecal samples instead of tissue as the source of DNA. The collection of fecal samples from this important seed-dispersing species is particularly vital to our reforestation program.\n\nEducation Promoting Reforestation Project\n\nThe Education Promoting Reforestation Program (EPRP) focused on the unique diet of the critically endangered black and white ruffed lemur, which consumes up to 90% fruit, eating it whole and then passing the seeds unharmed.\n\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership discovered that seeds collected from this species' fecal samples grow better than \"unprocessed\" seeds. In this unique reforestation project, seeds are used from the lemur's feces to rebuild lemur-friendly forests, not only planting the lemurs' favorite seeds, but also timber and fruiting trees closer to the villages to provide additional food and income.\n\nUnder the EPRP, Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership personnel, volunteers and graduate students track the lemurs through the forest, collecting fecal samples and plant the seeds in nurseries. The seedlings are transplanted as part of a community-supported reforestation program in an effort to restore Kianjavato's damaged forests. Some tree species serve to restore habitat and enable movement of future lemur populations while other species have a commercial value and benefit residents as an additional source of income. As we have seem throughout the program, community awareness and support has increased due to the regular participation of many local community members to monitor lemurs, maintenance and preparation of seedlings in the local nurseries, as well as the transplantation of trees.\n\nThe EPRP had modest beginnings focused on seven-kilometer stretch in which 60,000 trees were planted. However, with the help of local participants, we have planted more than 100,000 trees in the region in the past two years, making the future brighter and hopefully greener for these communities and the lemurs. Ultimately, we'd like to plant one million trees back into the Kianjavato landscape. We believe that our innovative forest corridor program can be one facet in a larger, overarching vision to reduce poverty while promoting a sustainable future for the residents of Kianjavato.\n\nConservation Credit Program\n\nIn 2012, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership initiated a conservation credit program to encourage participation at community plant events, which rewards families or individuals with a variety of items for planting trees. Incentive items were selected for the potential of improving the standard of living while reducing people's burden on local forests. These items included fuel-efficient rocket stoves, biofuel briquettes, commercially valuable trees, Water Hippo rollers and Tough Stuff solar panels and accessories. The distribution of incentive items as part of the conservation credit program is strengthening community ties to forest and habitat preservation.\n\nIn collaboration with graduate students from the University of Nebraska at Omaha's Geography Department, the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership aims to streamline and automate the conservation credit program. Participants will soon receive electronic identification cards to track their involvement and reward earnings. This technology will provide us with other valuable data collection like number and species of trees planted and the location for each planting.\n\nAutomation of the conservation credit program is an essential advance in the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership's one million tree effort and its related conservation credit program. Once deployed, this system can function as a model for serving the needs of Madagascar's people and wildlife. Encouraging communities to sustain themselves by conserving their resources through the use of alternative technologies will be a long-term process, but is the most effective way of steering Madagascar onto a healthier, more prosperous course.\n\nAntsiranana\n\nNorthern Sportive Lemur Project\n\nThe world's most endangered primates are not gorillas or orangutans, but the relatively unknown northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis). Only about 50 remaining individuals are known to exist and are restricted to the rapidly deminishing forests of the Montagne de FranÃ§ais Reserve in Madagascar.\n\nAs the northern sportive lemur does not survive in captivity, preservation of its natural habitat is the only way to ensure this species' survival. Yet, rapid extinction of the northern sportive lemur is a very real possibility due to habitat loss associated with the extensive production of charcoal throughout its restricted range. The loss of this species, which is currently on the list of the 25 most endangered primates, could be followed by other species endemic to Montagne de FranÃ§ais, such as 36 endangered or critically endangered plants only found there.\n\nHere, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership's conservation program is working to save this most endangered lemur by fervently working with the local community to protect this habitat, introducing alternative fuel sources and establishing a reforestation program.\n\nRocket Stove Project\n\nCharcoal production is resulting in large swaths of trees being cut for fuel with little to no opposition from government or park officials. The land is then left exposed in a hot and dry environment risking desertification. Eventually, local villages will not be able to supply themselves with supplies elsewhere. Residents of nearby Andavakoera participate in this illegal activity as they previously had not been introduced to affordable alternatives.\n\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Conservation Fusion, an international non-governmental organization focused on conservation education, have been working with Andavakoera since 2009. Overall, the community has been receptive to new ideas and eager for change that will improve the standard of distributing 100 fuel-efficient cooking stoves coupled with an intensive education program to participants in the forestation program in Antsiranana. The income-generating potential of these technologies increase the likelihood of long-term acceptance. Simultaneously, a reforestation program incorporating native trees and a sustainable agriculture component will restore ecosystem services.\n\nThe momentum generated from this initiative will be used to encourage local people to assume leadership roles in the sustainable development of their home and protect the northern sportive lemur and forests of Montagne de FranÃ§ais.\n\nAquaponics Pilot Program\n\nRecent research indicates that small-scale fisheries in Madagascar have a significant and positive impact on local economies due to their contribution to food security and poverty reduction, both critical factors in development of sustainable societies. This is a sustainable food production method that combines aquaculture techniques of raising fish for food with hydroponics methods of growing plants in a liquid medium. When the system is properly balanced, both the vegetation and fish can be regularly harvested, providing much needed food security to the community.\n\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Conservation Genetics Department has initiated a pilot project focused on aquaponics. We are partnering with Whispering Roots, an Omaha-based non-profit that specializes in aquaponics to design a system using locally available materials that are robust enough to withstand the climate and incorporate local vegetation and dish preferences to ensure acceptance by the community.\n\nAs of September 2013, we have constructed and are currently testing a pilot program in which we will mirror the concepts that we hope to build in Madagascar. This test system is allowing us to learn the process hands-on as well as evaluate vegetation and fish productivity in the system for deployment in Madagascar. We hope to transfer this knowledge to our field team in Madagascar in 2014.\n\nLavavolo\n\nRadiated Tortoise Project\n\nThe spiny forests near the village of Lavavolo in southwestern Madagascar is one of the last strongholds of the critically endangered radiated and spider tortoises, known to the Malagasy as sokake. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Conservation Fusion have formed a coalition to engage the community of Lavavolo in protecting their natural heritage. The poor economic conditions of southern Madagascar leave many desperate to provide for their families. Poaching of these tortoise species for bushmeat and the illegal pet trade is rapidly driving them toward extinction. Illegal sokake hunting camps operate year-round businesses in Madagascar and Asia. These camps harvest hundreds of radiated tortoise individuals to sell on the black market. Confiscations from the camps are reported every year. This is compounded by the slashing and burning of the endemic spiny forest for agriculture and charcoal for cooking fuel. With the current rate of harvesting and habitat loss, wildlife experts predict that the tortoises will become extinct in the wild in the next 20 years.\n\nIn response, the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership initiated the Radiated Tortoise Project in Lavavolo - with financial support from the Radiated Tortoise Species Survival Plan and the Turtle Survival Alliance. This project follows our philosophy of combining community development to ease human pressure on the ecosystem along with field research and tortoise monitoring.\n\nThe Radiated Tortoise Project is long-term conservation that utilizes extensive fieldwork and molecular genetic data collection. Fortunately, Lavavolo's permanent residents maintain the local fady (taboo) against eating or harming the sokake. However, this fady has not been respected by outsiders that have immigrated into southern Madagascar to set up tortoise harvesting operations.\n\nIn 2008, the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership began an intensive monitoring program of radiated tortoise nest sites at Lavavolo. During the first phase of this study, Malagasy graduate students were taught how to locate the tortoises, collect genetic samples and morphological data, while local field assistants were trained to monitor nest sites throughout the incubation period. The second phase of the project is ongoing and consists of daily nest observation and subsequent sampling of new tortoises.\n\nRing-Tailed Lemur Project\n\nUtilizing methodology that was field-tested in Kianjavato, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Conservation Fusion are also initiating a number of conservation endeavors in the Lavavolo region.\n\nLike the black and white ruffed lemurs, the equally threatened ring-tailed lemur is a prominent seed dispersing species in this arid region, eating fruit whole and passing the seeds intact. Thus, the ring-tailed lemur is a perfect candidate for a monitoring program and fecal collection efforts for a reforestation initiative in the region. To facilitate this, 10 ring-tailed lemurs from a number of populations throughout the area have been radio-collared, enabling local field assistants and students to study and monitor the lemurs and collect fecal samples.\n\nAs with the Kianjavato Education Promoting Reforestation Program (EPRP), the Lavavolo Education Promoting Reforestation Program will result in the production of seedlings that will be transplanted as part of a community-supported reforestation program that will utilize native trees to restore habitat and enable movement of lemur and tortoise populations. Once mature, endemic trees planted will entice lemurs to forage and continue the process of forest regenerations themselves, thus requiring less future human intervention. Additionally, employing local community awareness and support.\n\nThis work is coupled with intense community education and outreach efforts that integrate alternative agricultural practices, habitat restoration and species protection, resource conservation, sustainable energy technologies and entrepreneurial opportunities. Additionally, Conservation Fusion is working to build a school in this commune that historically has had little access to education.\n\nEducation and Technology Transfer\n\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership has been involved in the professional development of Malagasy graduate students and local field teams. This training and employment of local people directly involves them in conservation and encourages them to be advocates of their natural environment.\n\nTo date, more than 45 Malagasy graduate students have benefited from the program's mentoring assistance during the completion of their graduate degrees. The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership also supports more than 75 full-time Malagasy employees as field assistants, project supervisors, office employees, drivers and supporting field personnel. In addition, at least 10 international graduate students have partnered with the program and have since successfully completed their graduate or veterinary degrees. More than two dozen international volunteers have worked with the program, gaining valuable field experience and inspiring many to pursue a graduate degree focused on conservation.\n\nOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium's Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership has also had an effect on Madagascar's elementary school children. The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership's partnership with Conservation Fusion has led to numerous educational outreach activities. In 2007, for example, more than 15,000 conservation-based activity books were distributed to primary school children throughout Madagascar. Students that resided in areas of high biodiversity that was under threat from habitat destruction and hunting were specifically targeted. Following the distribution of these books, we detected a noticeable decline in the evidence of hunting. This indicates the critical role of conservation-based education and community-wide participation in preservation activities are vital for sustained preservation of natural resources and wildlife.\n\n2015\n\nRunhua Lei, Adam T.
