My brothers and sister also shared their wisdom through the everyday joys and challenges experienced in our large and dynamic family. I express my love and gratitude to my sister, Pat, who is my best friend and lifelong counselor; my loving, strong, and steady husband, Joe, who consistently supports my dreams; my amazing daughters, Cara and Andrea, who are loving and wise beacons of light in their own right; my incredible son through marriage, Bryan Fenster; and the entirely wonderful Battersby and Racey clans of which I am so fortunate to be a part.\n\nSpecial thanks to my personal editorial team: Melissa Cooper Sargent, Cara Fenster, Pat Battersby, and Kevin Witenoff. Special thanks to Chris Elliott for his Illumined Heart drawing that touched the core of our message: walk your path with a wise and loving heart and mind.\n\nGratitude and Encouragement\n\nI am deeply honored and grateful that you have chosen to invest your valuable time and energy in the use of this journal as a tool for your personal transformation work. May it awaken you to your wise, loving, eternal nature and your fluid connection to universal wisdom.\n\nMaster of the Storm\n\nShe watched the tornadic winds with awe and fear."
