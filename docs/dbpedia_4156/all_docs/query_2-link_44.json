        "text": "\"After we installed SelfieCam we were amazed how quickly the kids started using it, they understood how to use it as a game to record their tricks but also how to share them over social media - they loved seeing themselves on the phones after the session.\"\n\n​​\"We use them in lessons, at playtime and for special needs support as well – so there’s lots of applications. What you expect to be the benefit [of the CardioWall] is one thing, but then there’s lots of other things that come out of it as well. So, we are really, really pleased we’ve got them!\"\n\n​​\"The CardioWall Compact Duo has added a new dimension to PE at Fowey Primary. What makes the CardioWalls particularly effective is their accessibility – every child of every ability and age can enjoy using them. They are not only used during lessons but utilised by extra-curricular clubs including breakfast club. CardioWalls and Wake & Shake... a great way for children to be ready to learn at the start of the day!\"\n\n\"Teachers often need to identify movement breaks, rewards and incentives for children and the CardioWalls provide both very well. Teachers also plan the CardioWalls in to their gym activities as a component of units of PE work on fitness. One advantage over some existing PE activities is that the CardioWalls can be used independently. They require no teamwork, which suits some children. I should add though; the CardioWalls are also very effective for encouraging teamwork.\"\n\n​​\"The CardioWalls give you a score every time you play on them. So, [pupils] are developing the idea that; if I work hard, if I try hard and I keep practicing, I will actually get better at something.\"\n\n\"iZone has made me feel much more confident. I really enjoyed the CardioWall as this is the only piece of equipment I have found that I can comfortably do cardio and feel a benefit. I really enjoyed all the visualization techniques and cannot wait to come back.\"\n\n\"The CardioWall particularly lends itself to an ‘open play’ PE where the lessons are very much structured around what really gets the students’ attention. It develops their ability to think as well as giving them a really good physical workout. We find the CardioWalls to be highly accessible as both a learning and an exercise / fitness tool. The majority of our diverse ability groups can enjoy and benefit from using them, and the score capture facility enables us to measure their progress particularly easily.\"\n\n\"The main reason for using it actually is reflexes to get your brain and your hands and the other parts of the anatomy to work. That applies to all the exercises that you do, I look for the lights and don’t look for support, it's developing a part of the anatomy that used to work and isn’t being worked at the moment.\"\n\n\"Reaction speed in motor racing is very important so I used the CardioWall Pro-X at iZone over and over and over again, until I got to a point where I could do a score above 700 with my eyes closed. This thing made my race starts better than anyone else's on the grid because I could react to the lights on the track so quickly. It is good to have in the gym because other drivers get quite competitive and we have a leaderboard with all of the drivers. My goal is to get 1000 one day!\"\n\n\"iZone has made me feel much more confident. I really enjoyed the CardioWall as this is the only piece of equipment I have found that I can comfortably do cardio and feel a benefit. I really enjoyed all the visualization techniques and cannot wait to come back.\"\n\n\"The CardioWalls have been among the most used pieces of apparatus in the functional fitness area of our gym. They’re popular with people of all ages and abilities – providing a motivating and accessible alternative to structured exercise machines. We’ve used them with everyone from our older members to school children, from people who just want to improve their fitness to people with disabilities or with specific health needs, such as cardiac rehabilitation.\""
