Researchers are beginning to look at the chemical makeup of this mushroom to better understand how and whether it really works for each of these conditions.\n\nHigher doses of reishi mushroom might make bleeding more likely in people who have a very low platelet count.\n\nAlso, avoid using reishi mushroom if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, because there hasn't been enough study on their safety in these circumstances.\n\nInteractions.

Ginkgo and fish oil are two examples.\n\nTell your doctor about any supplements you're taking, even if they're natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with medications or foods. They can let you know if the supplement might raise your risk.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does regulate dietary supplements, but it uses different regulations than it does for \"conventional\" foods or drugs. Unlike drug manufacturers, the makers of supplements donât have to show their products are safe or effective before selling them on the market."
