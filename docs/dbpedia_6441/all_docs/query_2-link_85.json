However, their role has changed over time. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, with the diminishing role of religion in European society, writers with some kind of belief system, whether religious or political, have tended to use myth in two different ways. They have either retold the old, familiar myths of the past so that they carry a new message to the author’s own generation or created their own, new myths as modern vehicles of traditional truths. Many writers have combined the two techniques. This volume’s title, Re-Embroidering the Robe, was chosen both on account of its religious and mythological connotations—from Christ’s seamless garment to the Swan Maiden’s magic robe, Zeus’s gift to Chthonie or even Cinderella’s ball gown—and because it evokes the act of transforming artistry by which the enduring tale becomes new and relevant to each succeeding generation. Although writers, being merely human, cannot create ex nihilo, each author studied in this work has, in one way or another, fashioned a myth for their own time using, to some extent at least, already existing literary events and images. In order to make the most of the current interest in faith and myth, an international conference on “Faith, Myth and Literary Creation since 1850” was organised at Lille Catholic University in the north of France in May 2007. Thirty-seven scholars from North America, the United Kingdom and continental Europe were selected by an academic panel to share their research in this field in front of a fascinated audience. Although the conference took place in France, over half of the participants chose to speak in English. The majority of these were invited to contribute an article to this volume and one, Daniel Warzecha, has translated his study of Nordic mythology in The Chronicles of Narnia from the French. The articles naturally fall into three categories. The first group explores the notions of faith, or lack of faith, and myth in fictions of childhood and adolescence. The works studied are drawn from England, Scotland, New Zealand, the USA and Estonia. The authors considered range from a\n\nRe-Embroidering the Robe: Faith, Myth and Literary Creation since 1850\n\nix\n\ntraditional Christian, via a liberal theologian and a freethinker, to others for whom national or female, rather than individual or spiritual, reembroidering of myth is the primary consideration. The second group of articles examines the work of the explicitly Christian author’s relationship with myth, both as a mythopoeic creator and as a teller of traditional tales from a new slant. A surprising unity can be seen between the Non-Conformist MacDonald, Catholic Tolkien and O’Connor and the Anglican Lewis, Williams, Sayers and Eliot, as each writer provides in their work a form of incarnation of their own spiritual message to their contemporaries. Classical, Norse, Hebrew and Celtic mythology as well as national legend and biblical or other religious imagery all provide the rich raw material for the literature studied. The approaches to this material vary from that of post-modern theory to the more traditional literary and critical approach, from the historian’s contextualisation of religious and political ideas to the teacher’s personal dilemma of how to make the text live for his students. On the surface the factors unifying the studies in the third group may seem more tenuous. French, German, British, Greek, Irish and American authors are joined together in a panoply of mythological wealth. Nevertheless, each contributor analyses how certain well-known mythical tales or concepts have found new expression in the literature of the last one hundred and fifty years. To borrow from Jacques Coulardeau’s title, from Faust to Apocalypto, God and the gods may sometimes be dead, but in literature they have shown a remarkable tendency to rise again at the slightest opportunity. The authors of these papers, many of them leading academics in their respective fields, have had the opportunity to feast at a banquet of literary delights. You too are invited to the symposium.\n\nPART I: MYTH AND FAITH IN FICTIONS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE INTRODUCTION ADRIENNE E. GAVIN\n\n“Robert Frost said that poetry is what gets lost in translation: we could say that a myth is a story that is not lost, or harmed, or diminished as it sheds the skin of one language and assumes that of another.”1 That these are the words of a children’s author, Philip Pullman, is fitting, for it is perhaps in the literature of childhood that myths most often assume new forms. “When compared with general literature,” as John Stephens and Robyn McCallum observe, “the literature produced for children contains a much larger proportion of retold stories.”2 Similarly, Maria Nikolajeva suggests, all children’s fiction is “essentially ‘mythic,’” in that, like myth, it is often “a symbolic depiction of a maturation process (initiation, rite of passage) rather than a strictly mimetic reflection of a concrete ‘reality.’”3 The five essays in this section discuss novels of childhood and adolescence which re-embroider myth into fashions—or “skins”—more wearable in the modern world. Creating and reflecting national identity, conveying religious and moral messages, or re-visioning gender, class, and home, the novels examined all express a purpose beyond the purely narrative in their reinvention of mythical models. Spanning the twentieth century and the globe—with texts drawn from the United States, Estonia, Britain, and New Zealand—the fictions analysed here all contain mythinfluenced fantasy worlds or supernatural infusions into the realist, and centre on the passage of child or adolescent characters through magical experiences or places into a new sense of identity. J. Jackson Barlow’s essay examines The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), a distinctively American fairy tale written by L. Frank Baum in 1\n\nPullman, “A Word or Two About Myths,” n. p. Stephens and McCallum, Retelling Stories, Framing Culture, 3. 3 Nikolajeva, From Mythic to Linear, 1. 2\n\n2\n\nAdrienne E. Gavin\n\nrejection of dark and moralistic old European models. Arguing that the novel does, nevertheless, contain a moral message, Barlow poses the question: “what is the moral of Baum’s tale, and how do political structures and practices in Oz help us to understand it?” The message which his essay finds Baum’s “wonder tale” to have for its readers is that ordinary people have extraordinary power and must learn to rely on their own judgements and be sceptical about conventional wisdom and the claims of others. On her journey to the Emerald City Dorothy discovers that the land of Oz is “uncivilized” and flawed in its government. By killing the wicked witches and unmasking the fraudulent myth-making of the Wizard, Dorothy begins to “civilize” Oz by moving it towards government by consent and democracy. Learning self-reliance and to question received wisdom, she begins to realize the limits of rulers such as the Wizard to fulfil her own needs and dreams. As Barlow shows, Baum’s story urges the idea that anything is possible for those who try. In the second essay in this section Daniel Warzecha traces the influence of Nordic mythology on C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia (1950-56). Returning a clear yes to his question whether the seven tales of Narnia can be read as “more than mere children’s stories,” Warzecha shows that Norse mythology resonates with other inspirational sources in the stories to point towards “Christian eschatology in accordance with the Lewisian principles of transposition and inter-dependence of all things.” After discussing the appeal of the mythological Great North to Lewis in life, the essay examines the way in which The Chronicles borrow magical atmosphere, sylvan landscapes, spatio-temporal themes, supernatural creatures, journey patterns, and mythic devices from Nordic myth. Lewis interweaves his own artistic, psychological, and spiritual dimensions with old Scandinavian myths to create new dynamic tales, Warzecha shows, and the use of mythic figures magnifies the moral vision of Lewis’s work, making the battle between good and evil spiritual, timeless, and cosmic. Examining metamorphosis and odyssey, fauna and the sea, and destiny and sacrifice in poetic Eddas and Nordic sagas as echoed in Lewis’s works, the essay argues that Lewis wove through the Chronicles a “personally revised Christian eschatology” which reflected his belief that “all myths are essentially ‘copies’—lesser and yet glorious—of the central universal archetype, namely the redemptive incarnation of Christ.” Focusing on Estonian literature, Mari Niitra’s essay discusses the role of mythology in sculpting a nation’s identity. A small country with a history of being ruled over by more powerful nations, Estonia in the nineteenth century began recording and constructing myths with the purpose of creating a foundation for a “civilized nation.” Niitra outlines\n\nPart I: Introduction\n\n3\n\nthe role of Estonian intellectuals Friedrich Robert Faehlmann and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald in creating canonical literary myths, and giving Estonia its own national epic Kalevipoeg (Kalev’s Son). Drawing on a range of sources including classical mythology, German folklore, oral tales, and romantic literature, these nineteenth-century myth-makers created a national literature based on Estonia’s pre-Christian “golden age of ancient freedom.” As Niitra shows through her analysis of Reet Made’s 2005 children’s novel Salaroheline hiis (Secret Green Grove), these nineteenth-century myths still serve as ideological models for contemporary Estonian literature. The story of modern children who meet fairy creatures in the countryside and learn about old wisdom, national identity, and folkloric traditions, Made’s novel reveals the fairy world as “more sacred” than that of humans. It also reveals, the essay argues, a deeply rooted and enduring consciousness of the nineteenth-century mythic conception of the Estonian nation. In retellings of myths for children, such as Made’s novel or Lewis’s Chronicles, there is often “a high probability that replication of old content and mode of representation may result in the further replication of, for example, old masculinist and antifeminist metanarratives.”4 Yet, as critics Stephens and McCallum show, “[a]t the same time retold stories have the potential to disclose how old stories suppress the invisible, the untold and the unspoken.”5 The novels of female adolescence discussed in the final two essays in this section overtly acknowledge the untold female stories of old myths and re-stitch gender roles for a modern world. Ostensibly realist texts which introduce magical or supernatural elements, Margaret Mahy’s The Tricksters (1986) and Sara Maitland’s Three Times Table (1990) both depict the passage to womanhood as involving recognition of the faultiness of old myths as models for female protagonists. Discussing New Zealand author Margaret Mahy’s young adult novel The Tricksters, Adrienne E. Gavin argues that Mahy’s fluid, metamorphic drawing on old myths creates new female myth. In this coming-of-age story the protagonist Harry (Ariadne), a secret writer and keeper of family secrets, learns through conquering three supernatural trickster brothers that the old patriarchal forms of myth and romance that she echoes in her writing are a faulty and dangerous model for young women to follow. Suggesting that several myths serve as prominent but altered intertexts in the novel, the essay examines the ways in which Harry can most clearly be read as a reinterpreted Ariadne whose role also encompasses that of the 4 5\n\nStephens and McCallum, Retelling Stories, Framing Culture, 22. Ibid.\n\n4\n\nAdrienne E. Gavin\n\ntraditional Theseus. Not simplistically inverting old myths, but fluidly adapting, alluding to, and recasting them, The Tricksters weaves a modern, humanist myth of female maturation. Mahy emphasizes the power and marvellousness of human life and love in her myth-making, Gavin argues, and the novel reveals that the modern Ariadne must both create and follow the silken clew of her own story into the labyrinth of literary creation. Deborah Sarbin analyses Sara Maitland’s Three Times Table, a novel which re-energizes the myth surrounding St. Margaret of Antioch, a dragon conqueror who had a cult following in England in the Middle Ages but whose story was subsequently suppressed and deemed only legendary. Sarbin focuses on the youngest of the novel’s daughter-mothergrandmother trio of protagonists: fifteen-year-old Maggie Petherington whose entry into adulthood is marked by the giving up of her personal dragon, Fenna. Like Mahy’s Harry, Maggie realizes that she needs to create a new story of her own. Fenna has initially been useful, protective, and liberating for Maggie but as Sarbin argues, the dragon also becomes, like sin, dangerous and isolating for Maggie, cutting her off from the risks of real life. Considering the loss of St. Margaret’s legend, particularly in England, and discussing the ways in which this novel reinvents it, Sarbin shows that Maitland creates a story of spiritual strength which “addresses both a feminine coming-of-age and an examination of the complex nature of sin.” As Karen Armstrong writes, the “imagination is the faculty that produces religion and mythology.”6 It is also the faculty which inspires literature. The essays in this section range their discussions across the fields of mythology, religious belief, and literature, highlighting the ways in which, through their re-embroidering of myth, authors create new myths of place, of time past and present, and of identity national and personal. Authors such as Lewis and Maitland intertwine the religious with the mythical, others like Mahy reveal myth in more humanist terms, and yet others such as Baum and Made create myths of national identity. Discernible within all these myths re-told for modern times, however, lie the old myths undiminished, still beating and breathing in metamorphosed new skins.\n\n6\n\nArmstrong, A Short History of Myth, 2.\n\nPart I: Introduction\n\n5\n\nWorks Cited Armstrong, Karen.

JACKSON BARLOW\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) was America’s top-selling children’s book for the last Christmas season of the nineteenth century. Looking ahead to the new century, author L. Frank Baum offered his story as the prototype of a new form of children’s literature. In these “wonder tales,” the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.2\n\nGenerations of critics, however, have found something more than simply entertainment in The Wizard; they have found a moral, if not a “fearsome” one. Baum does not avoid making moral judgments, even as he entertains. Wickedness is defined as clearly and suppressed as effectively in Oz as it is in old fashioned fairy tales. But what is the moral of Baum’s tale, and how do political structures and practices in Oz help us to understand it? Much recent discussion about the politics of Oz has been framed by Henry Littlefield’s 1964 claim that the book is a “Parable on Populism.” He argues that the tale is an extended satire on the politics of the 1890s, with the Scarecrow representing Midwestern farmers, the Tin Woodman standing for the industrial workers of the East, and the Cowardly Lion being a caricature of William Jennings Bryan. Dorothy’s silver shoes and 1\n\nJuniata College students Amber Laird ’08 and Emily Hauser ’09 helped with the research for this paper.

I thank them for their support. 2 Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 4.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Myth for an Age of Progress\n\n7\n\nthe Yellow Brick Road in his view represent contemporary competing proposals over whether to monetize silver.3 Baum’s intention, according to Littlefield, is to support “Democratic Populism,” in particular the policy of “free silver.”4 This interpretation and its “monetary allegory” variant have been embraced by a number of other scholars and have proven to be especially popular among economists.5 More recent scholarship, however, has questioned the Littlefield thesis.6 The time has come for a fresh look at Oz and its politics. How do the adventures of Dorothy and her companions fulfil Baum’s intention of creating a “wonder tale” for modern children? The tale begins in Kansas, the heart of the heartland, where American values are the most solid. Yet Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are scarcely living the American Dream. They appear instead to be living in a story with a “fearsome moral,” for as the story begins they are powerless against the forces of nature. Nature is unkind in Kansas; everything is grey and cheerless, except for Dorothy. She and Toto are the only exceptions to the general dreariness. Baum is unsparing in his portrait of the human costs of life in Kansas: When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled, now…. Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.7\n\nThe land has remade Uncle Henry and Aunt Em in its own image. Dorothy, however, is young and yet to accept defeat. As Littlefield suggests, Dorothy is an American Everyman, or every child, characterized by a robust common sense and a powerful optimism.8 She has not yet lost hope or her sense of humour, and she has a generous way of accepting things on their own terms. By contrast with Kansas Oz is a beautiful place—a visual paradise. But for all its beauty, Dorothy quickly discovers that Oz is flawed.

When Dorothy arrives, Oz is governed by witches—the good witches of the North and South and the wicked witches of the East and West—and by the Wizard. This condition has not changed for many years—just how many no one can quite tell.9 Although the people are prosperous, Oz is thus far “uncivilized,” as the Witch of the North explains to Dorothy soon after she arrives: “‘In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left; nor wizards….But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.’”10 By killing the Wicked Witch of the East, Dorothy has begun the process of civilizing Oz, and although the process is not complete when she leaves, the trend is clear. In every case where a change of government occurs in the book, government by force or fraud is replaced with government chosen by consent. Civilization means that no one, however powerful, is justified in ruling others without their consent. This means replacing those who have, or claim to have, more than human knowledge and power with those who have only everyday knowledge and abilities. Government by consent means government by ordinary people. Why has change been so slow to come to Oz? Dorothy kills both witches—one hit with a house and the other “liquidated”—and she makes it look easy. We must assume that any one else, at any time, could have done so with equal ease, yet in spite of the oppression they have suffered, citizens in the various lands of Oz have apparently never risen in rebellion.11 Although in some respects people in Oz seem public-spirited, they are also complacent. To them the power of witches and wizards is simply a fact of life, and is not worth challenging. Part of this, no doubt, is simple prudence: those who lack magic abilities dare not test others’ claims of power, lest they turn out to be true. But part is also the people’s habit of passive acceptance. It is easier to avoid trouble than to take action, especially if one enjoys a comfortable living. Of course, the Witches really do have magical powers, even if the limits of those powers have never been tested. The Wizard is different. He 9\n\nBaum’s narrative is not free of problems, and this is one of them. It is difficult to see how the Wizard, coming as he did by balloon from Nebraska, could have built the Emerald City and ruled it for so long that everyone had forgotten what he looked like, especially since people in Oz seem to have longer than usual life spans. 10 Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 45. 11 The Wicked Witch of the East “‘has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day’” (Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 38, 40).\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Myth for an Age of Progress\n\n9\n\nhas convinced the inhabitants of the Emerald City to treat his very name with reverence, but he has done so by a series of lies. Although he claims to rule in the best interests of the citizens, they never appear to have questioned whether that is true, or inquired about what their interests might be. They are satisfied with his rule both because it seems benign and because they assume that his authority is based on powers or knowledge that set him apart. Dorothy and her companions expose the Wizard for a fraud. They discover that like successful charlatans in all ages he has a knack for finding the weak places in people’s self-estimates and exploiting them. The people’s fear of his anger, and the Witches’ fear of his power, are sustained by judicious but sparing demonstrations, and above all by clouding himself in mystery. The Wizard’s power is nothing more than the power of opinion. He has been able to manipulate and intimidate the people so that his power remains unchallenged. But there is no wizard, only the apparatus of wizard-making. Behind the illusion is simply a “common man” who managed to exploit the people’s superstitious beliefs. Baum depicts the Wizard’s myth-making in a way that undermines the political authority of myth. This is an appropriate lesson in a tale for modern children. The Wizard is more of a threat to popular government than is the real power of the witches, because he makes the people agents of their own deception. Unmasking the Wizard’s fraud reinforces for modern children a fundamental principle of democratic citizenship, the responsibility to scrutinize the activities of those in positions of power. Those who try to hide from the public may not turn out to be as wise, as powerful, or as benevolent as they would like us to believe. Democratic politics assume that the people can learn to see through the tricks of humbugs and rule in their own behalf. Democracy also assumes that there is no greater power than that of the people themselves. Dorothy and the Wizard, as Americans, share an unmistakably American recognition of the worth and dignity of individuals. But the Wizard’s recognition is merely formal; his power hinges on people being aware of their individual weakness and unable to assert their collective strength. As James Madison and later Alexis de Tocqueville observed, in an individualist age individuals feel little confidence in their own judgments when they diverge from public opinion. This insight allows the Wizard to succeed in deceiving the people of Emerald City.12 Dorothy, on the other hand, represents individualism’s more assertive or Emersonian side, the 12 Hamilton et al., The Federalist Papers, no. 49, 311-12; de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, 243-49.\n\n10\n\nJ. Jackson Barlow\n\nside that stands up to public opinion and challenges figures of authority. In bringing this form of individualism to Oz, Dorothy will not only expose the Wizard’s fraud, but will set the inhabitants on a path to government by consent. Oz is a place of superstition, credulity, and tyrannical government when Dorothy arrives. As the witch says, it is not a civilized place because there are still witches and wizards among them. Dorothy’s arrival begins the process by which Oz will become civilized, and although this is scarcely her intention, Baum makes it appear the inevitable result of her presence. The qualities of her character alone are sufficient to bring about a transformation of the political system, resulting in improved government. But the Wizard’s government of Emerald City raises the question whether any state can be free from the manipulative arts of politicians, especially if the people are able and willing to deceive themselves. The causes of tyrannical government in Oz may thus be related to certain limitations of democratic citizenship. What are the appropriate character traits for “civilized” citizenship? The discovery of these character traits is explored in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz through the central action of the book: Dorothy’s journey to the Emerald City to consult the Wizard and her quest to carry out the task he demands of her. Completing the Wizard’s assignment requires that Dorothy learn self-reliance, and this involves two steps. First, she must become sceptical, both of conventional wisdom and of others’ selfevaluations. She must learn to test claims of knowledge and power (or lack thereof) against her own knowledge and experience, rather than taking things on faith. By shaping Dorothy’s story in this way, Baum not only reveals a profound scepticism about claims to political authority, but also teaches an amused and ironic detachment from both socially accepted conventions and from others’ self-assessments. This detachment provides the foundation for the second step in Dorothy’s learning self-reliance: the discovery of her own powers. Nothing is quite what it seems in Oz, as even its youngest readers quickly learn. Perhaps most obvious is the fact that each of the main characters proves to be an ironic inversion of his or her reputation and/or self-image. The brainless Scarecrow is logical and thoughtful. The heartless Tin Woodman is sentimental and tender. The Cowardly Lion is brave. The mighty but shadowy Wizard is a mere con man, and the powerful Wicked Witches are easily defeated by quite ordinary means. Some characters believe themselves to be less than they are, and others appear to be more than they are. It turns out that most people are willing either to accept or to exploit conventional attitudes, especially those that\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Myth for an Age of Progress\n\n11\n\nconcern their own capacities. Dorothy must learn that the characters who underestimate their powers, especially her companions, have hidden strengths, and that the characters that are reputed to be powerful, especially the Wizard, have hidden weaknesses. She must first learn to question her own preconceptions. The first challenge to Dorothy’s received opinions comes in her initial meeting with the Witch of the North. When the Witch reveals her identity, Dorothy responds with the “stereotyped” fairy tale knowledge: “‘But I thought all witches were wicked.’”13 Dorothy’s conventional attitude toward witches is excusable because Kansas is civilized, and the witches there died out long ago.14 Dorothy must learn to replace her opinions about witches, and many other things, with knowledge derived from actual encounters with them. Dorothy’s scepticism about received wisdom grows as her experience grows. The first of her companions, the Scarecrow, has an advantage over Dorothy, in that he is not in need of unlearning accepted opinions. Having been created only the “‘day before yesterday,’” the Scarecrow’s mind is literally a blank slate.15 The Scarecrow has reason, but lacks experience, and so at first he falls into every pothole along the road. His lack of experience makes it difficult for him to understand Dorothy’s desire to return to Kansas, when she tries to explain it to him: ‘I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.’ ‘That is because you have no brains,’ answered the girl. ‘No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is no place like home.’ The Scarecrow sighed. ‘Of course I cannot understand it,’ he said. ‘If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.’16\n\nThe Scarecrow’s logic is inescapable, and certainly is not lost on readers. It does not seem to be lost on Dorothy, either, who responds by changing the subject. She cannot let go of her desire for home, however illogical. 13\n\nBaum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 40. Ibid., 45. 15 Ibid., 76. 16 Ibid., 75-76. Most commentators have noted Baum’s play here on the adage, “be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.” 14\n\n12\n\nJ. Jackson Barlow\n\nBut the Scarecrow’s logic generates just the sort of naïve questions Dorothy must learn to ask. In contrast to Dorothy’s conventional views of witches or her attachment to her home, everyone’s faith in the Wizard’s power seems well justified and hardly open to sceptical inquiry. It is grounded in real accomplishments: he designed the Emerald City and has kept the Wicked Witches at bay for a long time. Faith is a natural progression from things seen (the city) to their unseen causes (the Wizard). The evidence for the Wizard’s goodness seems obvious as well, for the people are prosperous. The Wizard initially appears as a God-like figure in keeping with our traditional images of divinity.17 He is infinitely good but also deeply mysterious. He is a shape-shifter, appearing in different guises to Dorothy and each of her companions. The Wizard’s ability to change shapes reinforces our ideas about his power, but more importantly emphasizes our inability to know him in any meaningful way.18 At best we can know an aspect of divinity, but we cannot grasp the whole of it: ‘What is he [the Wizard] like?’ asked the girl. ‘That is hard to tell,’ said the man [a farmer in the country outside Emerald City], thoughtfully. ‘You see, Oz is a great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.’19\n\nThe claims about the Wizard’s power, which are grounded in fact, are supported by images that conform to our conventional expectations about divine things. That they will prove to be mere images is one of the discoveries that Dorothy must make. At their first encounter the Wizard demands that Dorothy and her companions prove themselves worthy of the rewards they ask from him by killing the Wicked Witch of the West. The Wizard’s favours are not bestowed as an act of grace, but must be earned: “‘In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets.’”20 Dorothy’s response to the Wizard’s demand is a deep sense of disappointment, but it also indicates her growing independence of mind: “‘even if I wanted to, how could I kill 17\n\nNathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, 179. 18 Hudlin, “The Mythology of Oz: An Interpretation,” 455-56. 19 Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 165. 20 Ibid., 188; cf. Brotman, “A Late Wanderer in Oz,” 160.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Myth for an Age of Progress\n\n13\n\nthe Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?’”21 Dorothy raises no objection to the Wizard’s insistence that she do something in return for his favour. It is not unreasonable for him to demand a quid pro quo, and indeed it might be unreasonable for Dorothy to ask for an unrequited favour. But she can and does object to what he requires of her. Her question is a sensible one, after all. If the Wizard is powerful enough to send her back to Kansas, why can he not kill the Witch himself? Dorothy’s doubts will be amply confirmed by the end of her journey. Dorothy must sharpen her critical faculties before she can embark on her journey home. What she discovers is that there are no mysteries.22 Upon her return to the Emerald City to claim her reward, the Wizard is abruptly revealed to be simply “‘making believe.’”23 He is a humbug, if a very skilful one. What seems inexplicable or unknowable at first sight turns out to have a perfectly simple explanation that can be discovered by rational inquiry. The first step toward self-reliance is to understand things and people on their own terms, and not as containing or representing unseen forces that are working in or through them. Oz and its inhabitants are there for the purpose of being discovered by Dorothy, who must become sceptical of others as she is learning to trust her own judgment. The first step toward self-reliance is doubt about the ability of other forces, whether witches, wizards, or gods, to solve one’s problems. Dorothy learns to take others’ claims of power with a healthy dose of scepticism, because she can observe that no one is invincible. One cannot depend on being rescued by others or on escaping to another place—these are not just illusions, but irresponsible ones, for they make one passive in the face of problems that require action. As observed earlier, in a democracy it is essential that the people take action to solve problems, rather than accept things passively. But this also means they must discover and use their own powers. Having become sceptical about others’ powers, Dorothy and her companions must become confident in their own capacities to solve problems. Dorothy and the others must learn what the Wizard already knows and practices: how to make the best use of one’s talents and opportunities, however modest they might be. The key to his success is the Wizard’s understanding of others’ need for reassurance and their capacity for self-deception: 21\n\nBaum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 189. Sale, “L. Frank Baum, and Oz,” 581. 23 Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 261. 22\n\n14\n\nJ. Jackson Barlow Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. ‘How can I help being a humbug,’ he said, ‘when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything.’24\n\nPeople in Oz, and perhaps people in Kansas as well, prefer their own imaginings or a comfortable and familiar falsehood to an uncomfortable truth, and the Wizard’s power is grounded in this observation. Baum makes clear to his readers that this human tendency is in tension with the needs of democratic government, which is undermined by the belief that those in power can “do anything.” The Wizard takes this insight one step further. He has not only given the people an illusion; he has reinforced it by staying out of the public eye. The less that is known, we may surmise, the better—let the public fill in the blanks with their own speculations. We must therefore add to his list of talents that he knows when to remain silent. The overt and explicit lesson Dorothy and her companions receive, or should receive, from their journey is that they have within themselves the resources to solve their problems. Again and again in the story they demonstrate their own capacities and strengths, yet the characters still doubt (as the readers do not) that they have the virtues they have displayed. The great irony is that they doubt themselves, but they do not doubt the Wizard, even after he has admitted he is a fraud. Dorothy’s companions never stop believing that their virtues are grants from outside, and not generated from within. They have made the mistake of imagining themselves without qualities they in fact possess, and must rely on an authority figure, however tarnished, to provide them with an equally imaginary reassurance. None of Dorothy’s companions really learns the lesson that Dorothy herself learns, or that the reader learns from them. The Wizard’s “gifts” to the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion are silly—not just symbols, but cheap and tacky ones. He cannot, in fact, give them anything, and everyone knows it but the characters themselves.25 As the readers learn, Dorothy also has the powers she seeks from the Wizard, since the silver shoes have the power to transport her home. But in contrast to the situation of her companions, the Wizard does not know Dorothy’s powers, and cannot “grant” them by making a symbolic gift. No 24\n\nIbid., 283. Cf Hearn’s comments and the sources he cites in Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, 271, n. 17. 25\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Myth for an Age of Progress\n\n15\n\none else has the power to send her back to Kansas. Dorothy’s discovery completes the lesson that modern children must learn: regardless of how difficult it may seem to achieve one’s goals, one’s own abilities are up to the task. Anything is possible for those who try. The Wizard can show the Scarecrow, the Woodman, and the Lion that they have the qualities they seek, only because they have already displayed them. They had achieved their goals, and needed only the testimonials. Dorothy, too, must find her powers in herself, but her discovery is more complicated. Her resourcefulness and pluck along her journey lead to discovering the power of the silver shoes. Metaphorically and literally, her powers have been right under her feet all along, but she did not know how to use them. The moral of Dorothy’s story is the extraordinary power of the ordinary person. This is the message that Baum’s “wonder tale” brings to the children of the twentieth century. Its Emersonian celebration of the extraordinariness of the ordinary is what has kept The Wonderful Wizard of Oz a central part of American mythology. Every person has inherent talents or abilities that he or she needs only to recognize; and every person also needs to learn to be sceptical of conventional wisdom and of others’ claims about their own powers. These are the grounds of self-reliance, and a critical support for the principle of government by the consent of the governed. Citizenship in a “civilized” country requires that citizens recognize that their own common sense is all that is needed to solve political problems. Politics is not a mysterious art for which they need to rely on the opinions of “experts.” In an age of rapid progress, the most important thing citizens can do is think for themselves. If the message of the older fairy tales was “trust authority,” Baum’s message to modern children is “trust yourself.”\n\nWorks Cited Attebery, Brian. “Oz.” In The Wizard of Oz.

Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia (1950-56). This is due to Lewis’s long-standing passion for myth in general which is shown in his many and diverse works which are impregnated with mythopoeia. Indeed, Lewis’s reason and imagination seemed to have been influenced by a mythological state of mind. Reasons for this are to be found in the writer’s intimate personal development as well as in his intellectual training. Recalling some major (auto)biographical landmarks might therefore be useful in better understanding the centrality of myth in Lewis’s career. Nordic mythology certainly played a major role in the writing of The Chronicles of Narnia, but it was only one element among many others. Yet Nordic mythology cannot just be reduced to a literary epiphenomenon made up of disparate elements. On the contrary, it contributed significantly to the depiction of an underlying “larger pattern”1 which underpins the architectonics of the seven tales. This specific mythology resonates with other powerful sources of inspiration to be found throughout Lewis’s stories. All however point in the same direction, namely to Christian eschatology in accordance with the Lewisian principles of transposition and inter-dependence of all things. This essay therefore asks whether The Chronicles are not more than mere children’s stories. Why does myth occupy such a prominent place for Lewis? Simply because, in his own view, “it is the myth that gives life.”2 At an early age, through pictures and stories, Lewis discovered the Great North which elicited in him a deep poetic and spiritual feeling. In his teens he shared this interest for the North with Arthur Greeves, a neighbour living near Belfast who became his lifelong friend. Then, when Lewis was at Malvern School, he discovered Richard Wagner’s music. Arthur Rackham’s picture 1 2\n\nLewis, Miracles, 110. “Myth Became Fact,” God in the Dock, 65.\n\n18\n\nDaniel Warzecha\n\nSiegfried and the Twilight of the Gods3 created in him an aesthetic and spiritual rapture (which he called “joy”4). This feeling was as strong as his delight when he first saw the toy garden that his brother Warren had made for him. It was as powerful as his enchantment when he was a child and he read Beatrix Potter’s Squirrel Nutkin (1903). This “northernness” Lewis was so fond of was not so much a geographical location but rather a very strong aesthetic feeling for an imaginary place. In Surprised by Joy (1955), his spiritual autobiography, Lewis wrote of how thrilled he was when he first read Wagner’s Siegfried in 1911. I had never heard of Wagner nor of Siegfried. I thought the Twilight of the Gods meant the twilight in which the gods lived. How did I know, at once and beyond question, that this was not Celtic, or silvan or terrestrial twilight? But so it was. Pure “northernness” engulfed me: a vision of huge, clear spaces hanging above the Atlantic in the endless twilight of Northern summer, remoteness, severity5\n\nIn the mid 1920s Lewis attended the Coalbiters, a club created and chaired by J. R. R. Tolkien. The club was designed to initiate Oxford dons to Icelandic myths and sagas. Lewis took part in it and enjoyed learning Old Norse and reading Eddas in Icelandic. Tolkien happened to have been a lover of the North since he was a boy. Like Lewis, he admired William Morris and since his adolescence, he had written poetry and plays influenced by old Nordic civilisation. The two men met on a regular basis in the 1930s and during World War Two at the Inklings, an informal literary circle created and animated by Lewis. The participants (Oxford dons, friends, and writers) read out their manuscripts, some of which would become bestsellers. The issue of myth was a very decisive one in the process of Lewis’s (re)conversion to Anglican Christianity in the early 1930s. At that time Lewis was a brilliant Oxford teacher. His conversion was gradual. He first became a literary convert very much in tune with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English writers such as Edmund Spenser, John Milton, or John Bunyan. On 19 September 1931, he had a fruitful conversation about myths with his friends Tolkien and Hugo Dyson. The conversation caused him deep inner turmoil. According to Tolkien, pagan myths had a divine origin and God spoke through them\n\n3\n\nArthur Rackham illustrated Richard Wagner’s Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods in 1911. 4 A word extracted from Wordsworth’s poem “Surprised by Joy.” 5 Lewis, Surprised by Joy, 55.\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n19\n\neven if it was in a distorted way through mythopoeia.6 He argued that the Christian “myth,” although true, functioned in the same way as the Pagan ones. Lewis, who was keen on myths, was challenged by the argument. This attraction for the Great North, which was more mythic and literary than geographic, was closely interwoven with Lewis’s conception of religion. At an Oxford Socratic Club conference, he admitted: “If Christianity is only a mythology, then I find that the mythology I believe is not the mythology I like best. I like Greek mythology much better: Irish better still: Norse best of all.”7 The Chronicles of Narnia illustrates those preferences by making Nordic images central to the novels’ poetic and spiritual re-enchantment of the world. Lewis’s stories are immersed in the same magic atmosphere as that of the Eddas. “The religious world of the ancient Scandinavian was strongly impregnated with magic,”8 but how did Lewis manage to include this mythic and magic substratum in his tales? Lewis freely borrowed spatiotemporal mythic themes (like the winter, the spring, the forest, or the sea), mythic figures (such as dwarfs, giants, elves, or witches), mythical devices (like odysseys or metamorphoses) into which he incorporated aesthetic, and moral, psychological, and/or spiritual dimensions. For Lewis did not forget the intrinsic dynamism of his own tales. Very often the mythological borrowings were used as narrative artefacts. Lewis liked allegorizing and mythologizing time and space and by doing so he intended to make them denser. For instance, the opening scene of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) reflects Nordic mythical time.9 At the very beginning of the tale, Narnia is plunged in endless winter—“Always winter and never Christmas” (23)—because the land is under the evil spell of the White Witch. This spell, synonymous with a curse, has provoked barrenness. Probably the aspect most indicative of this sterility is the Witch’s power to make statues of all the living creatures. This winter is reminiscent of “fimbulvetr” (or “formidable winter”) which characterised the first event of the Nordic eschatology described in the 6\n\nCarpenter, The Inklings, 42-45.

Interestingly, the melting of the snow in Narnia coincides with the return of Aslan, the “good god”—“‘Aslan is on the move,’” say Mr and Mrs Beaver euphorically (LWW, 65). Apart from in The Horse and His Boy (1954), the sylvan landscapes of the tales are drawn from the forests of Northern Europe as mythologized by ancient Scandinavians. The squabbles and the wars between Ase gods and Vane gods evolved in the snow-covered landscapes of the Nordic lands. Far from reflecting the widespread stereotypes of warriors, the mythology of Vikings was above all the mythology of magicians and poets. Patrick Guelpa indicates that it is a mythology which mirrors “a purely agrarian society.”11 The ancient Scandinavians had a consubstantial relationship with trees. “The centre of the mythological architecture is the Yggdrasill ash tree, The World Tree, whose roots extend beyond the inhabited world.”12 According to old Scandinavian belief “men are created by gods from tree trunks (i.e. terrestrial elements); as well as the primitive giants these gods are the guardians of original knowledge that lies in the Mimir spring at the foot of the big Yggdrasill ash tree.”13 In the precarious world under the threat of giants and the forces of chaos, “the tree is bitten at both its ends.”14 Lewis did not go as far as Tolkien in his symbolical and mythical representation of trees, but, like Narnia’s other living beings, trees are integral to the Chronicles’ cataclysms and promised restoration. Thus, in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Tumnus the faun and Mr and Mrs Beaver warn the children against the spy trees’ submission to the Enemy. As the thaw progresses, however, the forest becomes the natural “friend” of the children as they walk towards the Stone Table and the natural “enemy” of the Witch who tries to catch them up. In The Magician’s Nephew (1955), nature and trees participate in the chastisement 10 “[The winter] will last for three years without stopping. There will be heavy snow falls, heavy frost and the wind will be icy. The sun will no longer shine” (Guelpa, Dieux, 95). These scenes remind the reader of the episodes in the LWW when the children are heading for the Beavers’ house or when they are fleeing the Witch’s wrath. 11 Guelpa, Dieux, 109. He mentions “1) the biological rites that mark the great stages of life 2) the practical or directly utilitarian rites” (ibid., 110). 12 Ibid., 22-23. 13 Ibid., 106. 14 Ibid., 106.\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n21\n\nof Uncle Andrew. In Prince Caspian (1951) the Narnian rebels take to the bush in the friendly forest. In the same tale, the trees and the wood nymphs (dryads and hamadryads) communicate with Lucy in a very subtle way allowing her to go on and meet Aslan in a forest.15 The sea is omnipresent in old Nordic civilisation as is shown by the numerous collective ship-like tombs. These show that the Vikings were sailors, but they also encapsulate the idea of the voyage into the great Beyond. It is striking that the Norse god Balder’s body was laid down in a boat.16 In Eddic cosmology, the sea is mythologized. “Among the Scalds, giant Ymir’s blood is a kenning, i.e. a Scandinavian poetic form, to name the sea.”17 In the Nordic pantheon, the giant Aegir personifies the Ocean. Finally, in Nordic eschatology, after the ultimate catastrophe, paradise occurs and a new beautiful and once more green earth emerges from the sea.18 In The Chronicles, the sea is not “physically” present in all the tales, but it is present “just beneath the surface” because Aslan originates from his Father, “the Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea” (LWW, chapter 13). The sea is a geographical and spiritual Elsewhere. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe the sea is geographically peripheral and appears at the very end of the book. Yet it is strategically central because the castle of Cair Paravel is situated on the strait of Beruna overlooking the ocean. In Prince Caspian, the four Pevensie children are drawn back into Narnia and are “landed” on an island, which used to be the strait of Beruna on which the ruins of Cair Paravel stand. In The Silver Chair (1953), the Sea is hinted at in chapter three, in which old King Caspian puts to sea in order to look for his lost son. But it is in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952) that the sea becomes central. At the same time, it stands for a geographic, poetic, and spiritual topos. The sea is the medium that allows travel and the device that brings fluidity to the story. Symbolically it is very ambiguous. The chaotic turbulence that springs up from the sea is redolent of the spiritual and psychological darkness (sea monsters, storms, the Sea of Nightmares). At the same time, the sea is also laden with the promise of seeing Aslan’s country beyond the sea: in other words, paradise. Only the brave Reepicheep will be allowed to go there. The children will stay on the threshold of this Divine Elsewhere. Mythic figures magnify Lewis’s moral vision. So the battle between good and evil becomes timeless, spiritual, and cosmic. Aslan (“lion” in Turkish) holds a special place and is difficult to define. Is he a 15\n\nPC, 103-04. Guelpa, Dieux, 49. 17 Ibid., 22. 18 Ibid., 96. 16\n\n22\n\nDaniel Warzecha\n\n“cosmocreator,” “a mythic animal,” a god or a demiurge, a “Christ-like figure”? Interpretations vary. He certainly embodies good. “He is the Alpha and Omega of the tales.”19 He is the centripetal figure around whom all the plots converge.20 The archetypal witch Jadis (MN) with her hypostases the Queen of Narnia (LWW), the old Hag (PC), or “the Lady of the Green Kirtle” (SC) echo the she-trolls, i.e. the ugly giantesses that people the forest. The White Witch acts as a foil to Aslan. The children first turn up in a forest where a queen reigns. According to Nordic legend, the she-troll gives life to many gigantic wolf-like sons. The White Witch commands several wolves including the ferocious and cruel Maugrim. He echoes the wolf Fenrir or the wolf Hati (also called “the heinous”) of Norse mythology. Nordic myths contain fauna living near the world of men. Narnia is also filled with beasts of all sorts. Some speak, others are dumb. Some play determining roles like the horses Bree and Hwin (HB), the mouse Reepicheep (VDT), or the winged horse Fledge (MN). Other animals are just part of the background like the animals that surround Aslan after he has created Narnia (LWW). From Nordic myths Lewis extracted for use in The Chronicles the crowd of supernatural creatures like dwarfs, elves, witches, giants, sylvan nymphs, and satyrs closely associated with major gods like Odin or Thor. For instance, Nordic dwarfs come from the blood and bones of giants, and like giants they are tellurian beings, but they “live inside the earth and in stones.”21 In Snorri’s Edda, although elves are difficult to define, they are akin to Ase-gods and are associated with dwarfs. In Prince Caspian, Trumpkin can be read as corresponding to a Nordic “bright elf.” He is inclined to good because he is faithful to the crownless prince whereas the black-bearded, dark-haired dwarf Nikabrik shares many points in common with Nordic “dark elves” who are “darker than pitch and correspond to demons and live under the earth.”22 Nikabrik is inclined to evil. He is suspicious and keeps discouraging the party as they get inside the tumulus. He ends up invoking the ghost of the White Witch and dies as he joins the\n\n19\n\nSys, “Le Lion de Juda.” All quotations from Sys translated by Warzecha. “At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions at that time. Apart from that, I don’t know where the Lion came from or why He came, and soon He pulled the six other Narnian stories in after Him” (Lewis, “It All Began with a Picture,” Of Other Worlds, Essays and Stories, 42). 21 “Four dwarfs uphold the canopy of heaven. Their names correspond to the points of the compass: Austri, Vestri, Nordhri, and Sudhri” (Guelpa, Dieux, 22). 22 Ibid., 25. 20\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n23\n\nHag and the Wer-Wolf who fight against Caspian, Edmund, the badger Trufflehunter, and Cornelius (PC, chapter 12). The giants also belong to one side or the other. In Nordic mythology giants, from whom the gods come, are “chthonian beings living in the mountains and the rocks.”23 By definition, they are “ugly, noisy and stupid. They have names that conjure up these qualities.”24 At the end of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the kind Rumblebuffin smashes down the gate of Cair Paravel, which has been disenchanted by Aslan. This nice giant enables the statues, which Aslan has resuscitated by his breath, to get out (chapter 18). In The Silver Chair Scrubb, Jill, and Puddleglum, as they walk in the wild and mountainous land of the North, come across lazy but quarrelsome giants who start stoning them. The children should have remembered the hostile giants as they were received at the court of the Queen of the House of Harfang. In her castle, the hospitable giants, in fact ogres, were preparing the Autumn Feast during which the children and Puddleglum were supposed to be served as delicacies to the royal couple (chapter 8). For aesthetic reasons, Lewis gives free rein to his imagination by inventing intermediate creatures like the wise Cornelius who is half-man and half-dwarf or the lovable Puddleglum, the “marshwiggle” who is unclassifiable: neither an animal nor a man but much more humane and generous than some humans. As narrative devices, metamorphosis and odyssey are interrelated. Metamorphoses give density to a journey: technically, they accelerate the rhythm of the journey and symbolically they disclose a concealed meaning or a moral or spiritual dimension. The odyssey, the voyage, or the journey is an integral part of mythic stories. It infuses vitality and dynamism into them. Probably one of the most beautiful and moving odysseys in Nordic mythology, because of its tragic dimension, is the Riding of Hermodhr. As Odin’s messenger, Hermodhr has been mandated to snatch Balder out of hell which is guarded by the goddess Hel. His riding fails because he has been confronted with the power of destiny. Indeed Balder’s death had been prophesied a long time ago. The journey pattern in The Chronicles, especially in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, is shrouded with the same seriousness and sense of emergency found in the Riding of Hermodhr. The children have been entrusted with nothing less than the destiny of Narnia. The journey is par excellence the recurring narrative principle that energises the story by spurring the characters on. In all the tales the children are either brought unknowingly (MN), attracted (LWW), transported 23 24\n\nIbid., 105. Ibid., 20.\n\n24\n\nDaniel Warzecha\n\n(VDT), called (PC, LB), or even helped (SC) into Narnia, so as to be given special missions—namely, save Narnia, help Caspian (PC), Rilian (SC), or Tirian (LB), or take part in battles (LWW, PC). These missions imply travels and voyages which provide spiritual initiations for each child—for instance, by overcoming fear, becoming brave, redeeming oneself and so on. Metamorphoses fulfil a narrative purpose too. Let us take the examples of Fledge in The Magician’s Nephew and Eustace in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Before being named by Aslan, Fledge is a mere horse that pulls Frank’s cab. Later, as Narnia needs redeeming because it has been contaminated by evil, Digory is sent by Aslan to fetch an apple of life (without eating any) from the top of a mountain garden.25 So as to help Digory, Aslan makes the horse a talking beast and transforms him into a winged horse. Fledge is remotely reminiscent of Sleipnir, Odin’s eightlegged charger. In Lewis’s story the aim of the transformation is obvious: to make the plot progress and propel the action forward. In the case of Eustace Scrubb, the aim of metamorphosis is different. Eustace is the epitome of the selfish unpleasant little boy. On board the Dawn Treader with Lucy, Edmund, and the King’s crew, Eustace behaves selfishly. As the ship casts anchor near an island, he comes across treasure in a cave which he intends to keep for himself. He puts a bracelet on his arm and falls asleep. As he wakes up, he is changed into a dragon. His double transformation achieves two aims. It gives him a moral lesson and it enables the story to move on. Eustace is initially discouraged at being a dragon but then he is recognised by the others, and in his dragon state becomes useful by enabling the ship to be repaired by transporting tree-trunks. His becoming a human again is made possible through his being plunged into water (a hint at the rite of baptism) and through Aslan’s help (he tears the dragon scales off the boy’s skin). The technique of metamorphosis is to be found in all myths without exception. It is also found abundantly in fairy tales. First Odin himself as “the god of magic” very often changed forms. As his body was lying as if it was asleep or dead, he had become a bird or a beast, fish or snake and in the twinkling of an eye he would go to remote lands for his business or to fight against men.”26 Odin is “the elusive god.”27 Aslan, Narnia’s god, cannot be caught either in the proper sense of the term (“‘[He] is not like a tame Lion’” says Mrs Beaver28), but also in the figurative sense of the word. He undergoes a 25\n\nIbid., 133. Ibid., 37. 27 Ibid., 37. 28 Lewis, LWW, 166. 26\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n25\n\nmetamorphosis (HB) and is even transfigured into a lamb (VDT, 187-8) because he is a numinous or Christ-like figure whose name is hidden.29 Some of Odin’s characteristics have been re-used by Lewis here and there in Narnia. A parallel between Odin and the White Witch could be drawn. Odin is not the god of war. His weapons are above all intellectual, and through them he causes others to fight.30 The White Witch is very manipulative too and forces others to fight for her, or at least to collaborate. The wolves, the dwarfs, or the Faun Tumnus are good examples (LWW, chapters 2, 4, and 6). “The warriors devoted to Odin distinguish themselves by their fury.”31 As warriors they are like “wild beasts” that howl, bite savagely, and are invulnerable. They are called “wolf skins” and are gifted with shamanic strength; they are impassive to “pain, fire and weapons.”32 They are invincible. The Wer-Wolf (a man transformed into a wolf) was a widespread belief in Europe in about the year 1000. According to Guelpa “this belief in the Wer-Wolf seems to correspond to the metamorphoses into animals coming from Odinic cults: the wild warriors, the Wild Hunt. The belief in the Wer-Wolf probably dates back to metamorphic cults.”33 In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Maugrim, the Witch’s wolf-like secret agent evokes this old tradition of the Wer-Wolf. Killed by Peter, his hypostasis comes back in the tumulus cave (PC, chapter 12). Evil (in its various forms) is what threatens the world of the ancient Scandinavian, and the world of Narnia. In Nordic mythology Loki, as “the instigator of Balder’s assassination,” epitomises “the Nordic devil” and he commits his crime by disguising himself as a woman. He flees to the mountains to escape the gods’ wrath. “In day time he is changed into a fish.”34 Loki is the principle of evil and the metamorphoses he initiates or the ones that come from him or from his sons represent manifestations of evil: cruelty, natural disasters, and chaos. Evil is embodied by different “characters” throughout the Narnian tales (Queen Jadis in MN, The Witch in LWW, Miraz or the old Hag in PC, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in SC, Tash in LB). The same functioning principle of evil as in Nordic 29\n\nAs the children are worried about not meeting him again in their world, Aslan reassures them by telling them: “‘But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me a little here, you may know me better there’” (VDT, 188). 30 “[S]cience, slyness, artefact, magic” are his characteristics (Guelpa, Dieux, 35). 31 Ibid., 35. 32 Idem. 33 Ibid., 36. 34 Ibid., 63.\n\n26\n\nDaniel Warzecha\n\nmythology reigns over Narnia into which an extraneous evil has been introduced. Queen Jadis has stolen and eaten the Apple of Life (MN, 14353) and has contaminated Aslan’s newly created world. Thenceforth, evil will assault Narnia in succeeding waves. Each time it is countered by different protagonists, but eventually it succeeds in destroying Narnia. Nonetheless, as in St. John’s apocalypse, “new heavens and a new earth” replace the old fallen world.35 The old Narnia gives life to a new Narnia. Beyond the mere thematic correspondences or functional similarities extracted from Nordic mythology, Lewis’s tales point to a larger pattern. Lewis drew his inspiration from Nordic organisational principles which he included in his stories. An underlying teleology rules over Narnia. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the over-arching tale, it is reinforced by the initial prophetic element, which triggers off the redemption of Narnia.36 This underlying finality in the nature of things could be interpreted through three leitmotivs: destiny, order versus disorder, and eschatology. What characterises Eddas and Nordic sagas is the crucial role played by destiny. Nothing and nobody, not even the gods (Odin above all) can escape destiny. Guelpa notes that destiny has many synonyms in Old Norse like lög meaning rules fixed beforehand or orlög for original laws. Lewis, who had some knowledge of Old Norse, has the White Witch say that Edmund the traitor must be killed in accordance with that law established since “the dawn of time” by the “Emperor-beyond-the-sea.” That law was written by his sceptre on the Stone Table. Nobody can elude it, not even all-mighty Aslan (LWW, chapter 13). Only a “deeper magic” dating back from “before the dawn of time” can cancel the first one and spare the culprit (LWW, 148). Another idea related to destiny is sacrifice. Animal and human sacrifices were part of Nordic rites. For the ancient Scandinavian who lived in a completely sacred world, sacrifices and other rites were meaningful responses to destiny. The White Witch’s demand for Edmund’s blood and his replacement by Aslan could have this signification too, and might therefore be seen as simply a response to destiny. The Christian interpretation, which is not necessarily the most obvious to readers, could be superimposed on the Norse concept of destiny without really contradicting it. Aslan’s sacrifice allows several interpretations. First, it could be read as reminiscent of the sacrifices in all 35\n\nRevelation 21: 1. Mr Beaver sings that old nursery rhyme inscribed in Narnia’s collective subconscious: “‘When Adam’s flesh and Adam’s bone / Sits at Cair Paravel in throne, / The evil time will be over and done’” (LWW, 76). 36\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n27\n\nmyths, including Nordic mythology. There has been an offence (or fault) which requires atonement either directly (the culprit Edmund is killed) or by “an interposed sacrifice” through Aslan. This could be called the substitutive or vicariant dimension of sacrifice. Second, it might be deciphered as having a Christian meaning, with Aslan representing Christ. Third, the sacrifice could be seen as simply a means for the plot to go on. The old Nordic world order, which makes peace, prosperity, and abundance possible, cannot be separated from the king who is a sacred figure. If the king fails to ensure peace and order he is sacrificed.37 But this order is precarious and “constantly threatened by creatures coming from the original chaos.”38 One finds the same vision of the world in the Lewisian tales. In the matrix story, the world created by Aslan (MN) has been disrupted by the introduction of foreign chaos (symbolised by Queen Jadis). To restore order, Aslan is sacrificed, and the four Pevensie children become kings and queens of Narnia, thus warranting the return of law, order, and peace. The other tales relate other chaotic disruptions and misadventures but each time law and order triumph: the lawful kings Caspian (PC) and his son Rilian (SC) are restored. Nordic mythology contains eschatology described in Snorri Sturluson’s Poetic Edda as “ragnarökr” (meaning “the twilight of powers” or “the twilight of gods”).39 This end of the world, also called “the destiny of powers” or “the accomplishment of the destiny of powers”40 can be divided into five major events, according to Guelpa: 1) the fimbulvetr or “formidable winter” will arrive and last for three years without intermediary summer; 2) the sky will get dark and the sky and the earth will be shaken; 3) the wolf Fenrir will fly into a rage; 4) The serpent Midhgardhr (the Nordic version of the Bible’s Leviathan) will make the earth surge out of the sea; and 5) There will be a battle of the end of times and a cosmic fire. “However this cataclysm is followed by paradise and death is followed by resurrection: the earth will appear suddenly out of the sea and it will be beautiful and green, the fields will be fruitful without having been sown.”41\n\n37\n\nGuelpa, Dieux, 105. Ibid., 105. 39 Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241): Medieval Icelandic writer. He was the main mythographer and historiographer. He announced the end of the world in his Gylfaginning (50-52). It was also predicted in Völuspà, the cosmogonic and eschatological poem, part of the Poetic Edda (44-46). 40 Guelpa, Dieux, 96. 41 Ibid., 96. 38\n\n28\n\nDaniel Warzecha\n\nThis eschatology was revisited in a very personal way by Lewis in his “Always winter never Christmas” (LWW), the Sea Serpent (VDT, chap. 8), and all the battles announcing the last one. He integrated a personally revised Christian eschatology interwoven in the plots. Basically, there are similarities in both eschatologies because the Nordic one was in itself Christianised. We must bear in mind that the two medieval Norse mythographers Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241) and Saxo Grammaticus (1150-1220) were Christians. In the tales of Narnia both eschatologies are interlocked, for in Lewis’s thought, all myths are intrinsically linked to one another. “Everything is indebted to everything else, sacrificed to everything else, dependent on everything else.”42 In accordance with the Lewisian principles of incarnation and transposition all myths are essentially “copies”—lesser and yet glorious—of the central universal archetype, namely the redemptive incarnation of Christ. “We catch sight of a new key principle—the power of the Higher, just in so far as it is truly Higher, to come down, the power of the greater to include the less.”43 So Nordic mythology for Lewis is one of the “transpositions of the Divine theme into a minor key.”44 Eventually all myths echo each other in symphonic polyphonies and converge in the “Great Dance” or the “Great Game”45 in which humankind, now reconciled with its Source, as well as all redeemed and glorified creation participate. Occurrences of celebrations and feasts can be found at the end of most stories: the coronation of Frank and Helen (MN, 160-1), the coronation of the four Pevensie children (LWW, 165), the grand feast (HB, 173), the dance involving Bacchus, Silenus, and the Maenads (PC, 179-80). However, the “Great Game” at the end of The Last Battle (1956) is of a different kind. The old Narnia has been recapitulated and transfigured in a deeper dimension, “further up and further in” (165), with all the Narnian heroes assembled again. The whole world, encapsulated in a garden “with its own rivers and woods and sea and mountains” (169), is now glorified by the very presence of Aslan. He is like the lover in the Song of Songs compared to “a young stag on the rugged hills” “leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills” in order to meet his beloved.46 It is as if the new Narnia were enthralled by the sight of her Master, Lover, and Creator appearing again for good.\n\n42\n\nLewis, Miracles, 124. Ibid., 116. 44 Ibid., 118. 45 Lewis, Perelandra, 340. 46 Song of Songs 2: 8, 17. 43\n\nNordic Mythology in C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n29\n\nThe light ahead was growing stronger. Lucy saw that a great series of many coloured cliffs led up in front of them like a giant’s staircase. And then she forgot everything else, because Aslan himself was coming, leaping down from cliff to cliff like a living cataract of power and beauty. (171)\n\nAs we can see, The Chronicles are not only children’s stories. Following the major wardrobe metaphor—both a familiar piece of furniture and a magic object—the Narnian stories are filled with, and disclose, treasures hidden in the collective psyche. Nordic legends, in the same way as Warren’s “toy garden,” function as the vehicle of a mighty and transient “something else” which is, “a sensation of desire; but a desire for what?”47 The storyteller’s art consists in harmoniously putting together all these cultural and literary elements. Nevertheless, one does not necessarily need to know all about the sources of inspiration to enjoy the stories. For Lewis, who had been fascinated all his life by children’s stories, writing his own was an old dream and a pleasure. One must bear in mind that “we murder to dissect”48 and that the Narnian Chronicles are above all stories to be enjoyed for themselves. But what about their apologetic dimension? It cannot be erased altogether although Lewis always denied having written a sort of “picture catechism.” The tales, published in the early 1950s, were the work of a Christian apologist wellknown worldwide, famous for Mere Christianity (1952) and The Screwtape Letters (1959) and accustomed to demonstratio evangelica. Yet in 1948, his public debate with philosopher and believer Elizabeth Anscombe about the validity of naturalism had a devastating effect on Lewis as Christian apologist. “His argument for the existence of God had been demolished.”49 From that time, he stopped writing apologetic works as such and resolutely turned to fiction and books for edification. It is worth noting that The Chronicles, which are still bestsellers, were written by a childless, middle-aged bachelor.50 All in all it is through imagination, prepared since childhood and then “baptised,” and thanks to mythopoeia that Lewis returned to Christian faith. Therefore, it is not surprising that he chose this very mode of expression he excelled in. To intellectual and 47\n\nLewis, Surprised By Joy, 11.

Estonian myths were constructed with the clear purpose of creating a foundation for a “civilized nation,” and as this discussion outlines, in the nineteenth century Estonian intellectuals Friedrich Robert Faehlmann and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald created canonical literary myths which still serve as ideological models for contemporary literature. By analysing Reet Made’s 2005 children’s novel Salaroheline hiis (Secret Green Grove), this essay shows how the nineteenth-century romantic conception of the nation is deeply rooted in shared consciousness. Estonia is a small country in Eastern Europe surrounded by more powerful neighbours. Therefore the history of Estonia consists mainly of the reign of various oppressors (Germans, Russians, Swedes, Poles etc.). Through the centuries, the population of Estonia has consisted of two ethnic groups: Estonian peasants and a largely German nobility. It is important to note that, in the case of Estonia, the borders between ethnic groups and social classes coincided. The nineteenth century was the period when a so-called “cultural awakening” started among many European nations. In Central and Eastern Europe the ideology of nationhood developed under the influence of the ideas of the French Revolution, German classical philosophy, and romanticism. The ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau formed the philosophical background for the emerging conceptions of nationhood.2 In creating a national identity, some nations turned to their more or less glorious past or, where they did not 1\n\nCompletion of this article was funded by ETF grant project no 6484 Nimetamine ja anonüümsus kultuuris. 2 Laar, Äratajad, 65.\n\nCreating National Mythology and its Reflections in Contemporary Children’s Literature\n\n33\n\nhave one, constructed it from more arbitrary components. Memories of a nation’s heroic past are of fundamental importance to national ideology. Accordingly, every nation creates its own view of the past in a way which best corresponds to its interests.3 Historian Ea Jansen writes that although the concept of nation is a rather new phenomenon, the national ideology of any nation always attributes great importance to the images of the nation’s past: the older the better.4 The legitimacy of the nation rests upon its past. National ideology is never a mere reconstruction of a historical past; it is, rather, a conscious process of reworking or perhaps even an artificial construction. Its purpose is to emphasize the vigours and virtues of a nation. If a nation does not have a glorious history (at least in documentary form), it has to construct its heroic figures and events. For the nationalities which did not have a statehood of their own (e.g. Estonians, Finns, Slovaks, and Slovenes), the main means of doing this was to turn to their ethnic traditions and myths. In a word, mythology or some reconstruction of mythological elements could be substituted for history. We can even say that the historicity of heroes and golden ages is actually of secondary importance. According to Anthony D. Smith, what matters about heroes and myths, “is their ability to evoke a lost splendour and virtue and to act as stimuli and models for a national self-renewal today.”5 The initiative for national awakening in Estonia first came at the beginning of the nineteenth century from a group of local German Estophiles, who noticed the unique folklore of Estonian peasants and found it worth preserving and studying. They were also the first to advocate the possible renaissance of the Estonians as a nation.6 It is important to note that during that period all university education and in fact all written culture was conducted in German without exception, so the Estonians who managed to advance economically and acquire a university education inevitably became Germanized. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, when social and economic emancipation arose among Estonian peasants and literacy became a norm, it seemed doubtful whether Estonians could manage to survive as a separate ethnos and develop their own literary culture. It seemed more likely that they would merge with the Germans, whose language and\n\n3\n\nJansen, “Muinaseesti Panteon,” 802.

The most outstanding among them were two authors: Friedrich Robert Faehlmann (1798-1850) and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803-82). Both came from the families of the officials working for local German landlords, were freed from serfdom, and had access to education in Tartu University.8 They both made efforts to create Estonian literary culture. Both men understood the importance of preserving Estonian folkloric heritage, and, by using folkloric material, tried to create canonical masterpieces, which would prove the peasant culture’s right to stand among other European nations as an equal member. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries scientific interest in folklore was widespread across Europe, and this certainly gave encouraging impulses to Estonian intellectuals.9 Both German Estophiles and intellectuals of Estonian origin believed in the glorious past of the Estonian people and tried to investigate and reconstruct it in the spirit of romanticism. Their aim was to prove to the educated world that Estonians had the right to exist as a separate nation and that their culture belonged in human cultural heritage.10 Finding evidence of the glory of the Estonian past had a crucial impact on ways of describing this past in the literary texts of the period. Faehlmann, for example, contrasted the more recent gloomy centuries of serfdom with the ancient liberty of Estonians, which he praised romantically.11 He described the period before the crusaders’ invasion in the thirteenth century as the golden age of ancient freedom, depicting it as a strongly mythologized ideal.12 Because there were extremely few historical documents about pre-Christian Estonia, it was possible to reconstruct the period at one’s discretion, preferably idealistically. Faehlmann attempted to reconstruct Estonian national mythology. He wrote a collection of tales called Müütilised muistendid (Mythical Tales, published originally in German during 1840-52; three of them were also published in Finnish in 1847) which proceeded from a belief that ancient Estonians must have had a highly developed spiritual life and\n\n7\n\nJansen, Vaateid eesti rahvusluse sünniaegadesse, 377.

According to these mythical tales, the centre of the universe is Toomemägi, a mountain in the Estonian city of Tartu, where a sacred grove was situated. The demiurge lives on the mountain along with smaller divinities and semi-divine heroes. Faehlmann tried to concretize mythology by using very specific toponyms and descriptions.14 Faehlmann writes: For the proof of this splendour and magnificence we have left only the ancient tales and songs of uneducated people. But we still should not abandon these evidence[s], because where history does not reach with its written letters, there the tale and song would be justified.15\n\nLargely due to Faehlmann’s influence, the Estonian pre-Christian period became mythologized in the nineteenth century, being described by many authors as an era of enormous wealth, democracy, and justice. Estonian national consciousness in the nineteenth century valued the idea of homeland, the mother tongue, ancient folk traditions, the historical past (especially the ancient “golden age” and fight for freedom) and inspired romantic literature. It had an enormous impact on the humanities as well, for example encouraging the science of history and folklore studies.16 Romantic ideas about the nation, which spread throughout the nineteenth century, gave an unequivocally negative assessment of the Christianisation of Estonians and described the period from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century as a 700-year long “night of slavery.” Because works of fiction preceded professional history by a few decades, even historians used many rhetorical tropes taken from the period’s belletristic writing in their texts (the ancient era of democracy and justice, the night of slavery for example), which then became regarded as historical truths.17 One widespread precondition of becoming a Kulturnazion, was showing that Estonians must necessarily have had something comparable to Western culture in the past. Kreutzwald writes: 13\n\nJansen, “Muinaseesti Panteon,” 808. Annus et al., Eesti kirjanduslugu, 61. 15 Faehlmann, Müütilised muistendid, 17.

The one who has been oppressed for centuries is not able to give us a proper idea about the intellectual capabilities of his ancestors.18\n\nOne aim of the early Estonian intellectuals was to give the nation its own national epic, which they compiled from oral tales. Composition of this epic, Kalevipoeg (Kalev’s Son), was initiated by Faehlmann in 1839 and the work was completed by his friend and adherent Kreutzwald during 1857-61. Its literary influences included the Finnish national epic Kalevala, classical Greek epics, and the works of Virgil, Christfried Ganander and others.19 Kalevipoeg covers a wide range of topics in Estonian history: the formation of the Estonian nation, the praise of hard work, the fight against feudalism and a promise for future freedom, and the return of a “golden age.”20 Kreutzwald compiled another important text in the history of Estonian literature: the collection of Estonian fairy tales Eesti rahva ennemuistsed jutud, which was published in 1866. It is significant that the full title of this work is: Ancient Tales of the Estonian People. Gathered from People and Written Down by Fr. R. Kreutzwald. As we can see, he stresses his role as a mediator for uneducated people rather than as the independent author of a literary text. Kreutzwald, probably deliberately, did not take into account the scientific tradition of his time which demanded more or less precise recordings of folklore texts. Kreutzwald instead seems to have considered himself a member of the Estonian people to such an extent that he would have the right to add improvements to folklore recordings as a “spokesman” of the people.21 The purpose of the national epic and the fairy-tale collection was ambitious. As Kreutzwald writes in a letter to a colleague in 1860: “If some of these ancient tales will be published and Kalevipoeg will be printed as a popular edition, then we can already say something about the beginning of Estonian literature.”22 Kreutzwald’s ambition was to establish Estonian national literature and, as intended, the epic and his often republished fairy tales became the cornerstone of Estonian literature 18\n\nQuoted in Masing, Eesti usund, 6.

The impact of Kalevipoeg and Kreutzwald’s fairy tales on the emerging Estonian national culture was enormous. The epic instantly became a symbol of ancient glory. “Kalevipoeg should have a place in every Estonian’s home along with the Holy Bible,” wrote C. R. Jakobson, another intellectual and author of many school textbooks in 1867.23 Some literary motifs in these texts were initially perceived as a true heroic history of the country,24 and they played a crucial role in bringing national identity into local peasants’ awareness. The relationship between Estonian folklore and some of the period’s literary examples is interesting. Faehlmann and Kreutzwald both wanted to demonstrate the splendour of Estonian culture, but they did it mainly via literary models taken from classical mythology and Western European literature. So, for example, Faehlmann created a pantheon of Estonian gods and claimed that Estonians had a monotheistic religion in order to show that the peasants, though poor, had a very sophisticated spiritual culture. Moreover, Faehlmann published his mythical tales in German as he was interested in changing the expectations of German readers, who saw Estonians as mere barbaric savages during that period. Kreutzwald proceeded from the literary traditions of his own period in creating his fairy tales. One clear influence was the fairy-tale collections of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, who also reworked traditional material and presented it as authentic, while trying to show the rich heritage of German peasants.25 In his fairy tales, Kreutzwald expanded short oral tales, elaborated the style artistically, and added some motifs from European romantic literature and Western folklore collections. The process of forming national identity thus took place via the cultural models of nations perceived to be more powerful than Estonia, which still had an orality-based culture. Such a wide use of literary examples was related to the attempts to create Estonian literary culture. It did not matter how rich and unique the peasants’ oral heritage actually was, because being a nation inevitably presupposes the existence of a written culture. It is no wonder that these texts are the products of somehow contradictory endeavours: a wish to preserve folklore and an ambition to establish a national literature which would correspond to Western European traditions and literary standards. In order to show that Estonian people, although poor peasants, were able to produce folklore texts of high artistic value, these authors reworked 23\n\nQuoted in Jansen, “Eestlaste rahvuslik ärkamisaeg,” 96.

At the same time, some genuine folkloric materials were set aside as worthless. The already vanishing oral culture of Estonia in the nineteenth century was widely perceived to be non-culture while everything defined as culture came from Western Europe. In a broader theoretical context this process can be"
