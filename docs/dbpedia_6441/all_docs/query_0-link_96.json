        "text": "Author: Heathcote Pursuit\n\nHarry and Nellie Quealy ~ Life and death in variety\n\nAbove: Nellie and Harry Quealy in 1910, at the height of their popularity on the Australian stage.\n\nHarry Quealy, born 1876\n\nHarry was born Henry Joseph Quealy in Brisbane in July 1876 to Thomas, a shoemaker, and sometime mechanic at Brisbane’s Theatre Royal – and who was, according to Harry, also “the best dancer in Queensland” and his Irish born wife Margaret nee Byrne. Harry’s stories about being encouraged onto the stage at a young age are true. He recalled that he was on stage in a benefit concert as early as 1882, when he danced to much acclaim. By 1891, 15 year old Harry was a part of Tom Pollard’s new juvenile troupe touring Australia. He continued to be associated with Tom Pollard’s troupes of players as they matured, until they finally broke up, about 1908. Harry’s associates are not well remembered now but were very well known at the time and included – Maud Beatty(1878-1959) and May Beatty(1880-1945), William S Percy (1872-1946), Nellie Wilson(1877-) and Jack Ralston (1882-1933). See Note 1 below regarding various Pollard tours.\n\nHarry developed to become a popular comedian for Tom Pollard’s comic operas, taking on numerous character roles –“a list too long for me to give it to you right off” he told The Theatre in 1910. In 1903 he joined Pollard’s “Royal Australian Comic Opera Company” for an extended tour of South Africa. It was here that Harry met Nellie Finlay, who was touring with Harry Hall’s Juvenile Australian Company at the same time.\n\nBoth Harry and Nellie were short and slight – a physical profile famously preferred by juvenile companies. Harry was inclined to claim he was even shorter than his 162 cms (5’4″) inches while Nellie stood just 152 cms (5′) in height. But it was their skills as dancers, singers and comedians that made them so popular, even before they teamed up on stage. “We both revel in sketch work” Harry assured Theatre magazine.\n\nNellie Finlay, born c1885\n\nNellie Finlay was born c1885 in New Zealand. Details of her childhood are obscure, almost certainly because her mother Millie Robins was unmarried. Nellie and her sisters Nattlie and Irene adopted the surname Finlay when her mother married George Charles Finlay in 1893.\n\nAccording to Harry Quealy, Nellie’s performance career began when she was aged only 4 and a half – or in about 1890. She was documented onstage in 1892, dancing a sailor’s hornpipe in a program at the Exhibition Hall at 232-234 Brunswick Street Fitzroy and the Finlay family moved permanently to this area soon after. A few years later, this part of inner city Melbourne had become the main recruiting ground for Charles Pollard & Nellie Chester nee Pollard’s Lilliputian Opera Company troupes and it is not surprising that Nellie and her sisters would end up being associated with them.\n\nBy 1897, Nellie had a reputation for her dancing – which included a version of Bessie Clayton’s “back kick dance” – meaning she was flexible enough to kick backwards and touch her head. In late 1898, Nellie and Nattlie joined a Charles Pollard tour of South Africa – performing the usual repertoire of musical comedies – The Geisha, The Gaiety Girl and the like. A report written for Sydney’s Referee included interviews with Nellie and Nattlie: “Nellie Finlay, aged 12 years, who is a bright and clever girl, said: ‘I like South Africa, and travelling. I came to Cape Town from Australia on November 17, 1898. I like playing parts and dancing. My best part is Mamie Clancy in The Belle of New York.“\n\nIn 1900, Nellie and Nattlie joined Harry Hall’s own troupe to perform in South Africa. However, even by the permissive employment standards of the time, the choice of South Africa as a destination for a children’s troupe was unusual – the country was then in the midst of the Second Anglo-Boer war. See Note 2 below regarding Irene Finlay joining the Pollards.\n\nNellie Finlay remained connected with Hall’s company in South Africa for several years – she travelled there again in early 1903, with other up and coming juveniles like Harold Fraser (later Snub Pollard) and Mae Dahlberg (later Mae Laurel). Hall died suddenly in South Africa in late October 1903, and his Australian Juveniles mostly returned to Australia. However, Nellie returned to Australia on the same ship as Harry Quealy, and the couple married in Western Australia in 1904.\n\nWorking together\n\nFollowing their marriage in Western Australia, Nellie and Harry both appeared on the Australian and New Zealand stages for Tom Pollard, with Nellie increasingly choreographing for productions. Fun in the Kitchen was first performed in September 1908. It met with great approval and appeared in Australia on and off for six years, being entirely devised and regularly refreshed by Nellie and Harry.\n\nIn April 1909 Arthur Pollard asked Nellie and Harry to accompany his new Lilliputian tour of the “Far East,” India and North America – Nellie as Ballet Mistress and Harry as Stage Manager.(Charles Pollard had announced he was retiring from running his North American tours) About thirty young performers departed in July 1909 on the SS Gracchus, bound for Java and Singapore as first performance stops. However, as this writer has noted elsewhere, the tour of India was a disaster. Pollard was inexperienced as a manager and temperamentally quite unsuited to be a supervisor of children. The tour fell apart and the child performers returned home in early 1910, with considerable press attention. Harry went out of his way to protect the name of his mentor and friend Tom Pollard, but it didn’t help – the Pollard family reputation was ruined and new Federal legislation followed soon after to restrict the employment of children overseas. Harry also studiously avoided saying anything about his sister in law, Nellie’s youngest sister, Irene, who had disappeared with Arthur Pollard after the troupe broke up in Madras. This writer can find no evidence Nellie and Irene saw each other again. Perhaps the early death of their mother Millie Finlay in Melbourne in 1907 saw the family relationships fracture for good.\n\nBack home, Harry and Nellie resumed their career in vaudeville. For six years, they toured far flung towns and cities in Australia and New Zealand, as part of varied variety lineups, almost without a break. Fun in the Kitchen made a regular return, but they also had new acts – Ragtime Musical Stores, On the Stage and Only a Dream – unfortunately only the titles survive. Fun in the Kitchen continued to tickle Australia audiences, in late 1912 the Kalgoorlie Miner reported that the huge audience “screamed with laughter, and wanted more.” At the conclusion of a final, very long run on the Fuller circuit and shortly before they left Australia in September 1916, the Sunday Times of Sydney reported that Nellie “possesses all the accomplishments necessary for success in vaudeville, with a good voice, a good presence, and shapely figure she has all the essentials for success in the rapid-fire sketches she and her husband present.“\n\nWorking in the US\n\nIt was wartime, but the Quealys were able to catch a ship to South Africa, and in January 1917 they arrived in Boston – the shipping manifest for SS City of Lahore suggests they had work already arranged. Harry’s first few years in the US saw his enthusiastic self promotion at work again – but many of the claims he made at this time to boost his profile now appear to be without foundation.\n\nIn 1917 Nellie was pregnant with their second child, Aileen, born in that year in New York. Harry found work in a film in mid 1917 – just one – a version (silent of course) of the musical comedy Madame Sherry. Clear photos of Harry, credited as H J Quealy, can be seen at Kay Shakleton’s Silent Hollywood website. He then found work in Oh Boy, a successful New York musical comedy that had opened in August at Boston’s Wilbur Theatre.\n\nThere is also evidence the Quealys were working together on tour at the end of 1920, in the “novelty” vehicle On Manilla Bay, but after this the couple did not work together again.\n\nNellie was busy – without Harry – in the early 1920s, on tour performing with Frank Roberts in Time – a sequence of episodes in the night life of a large city, and later in partnership with Jack Girard, who was sometimes listed as “Jack Quealy” in Shoe Echoes.\n\nIn 1920 Harry toured the US in the musical SeeSaw, followed by a run in Canada with fellow Australian Alma Gray in The Royal Perriots in 1921. And in 1922 he took a role in Rain, at the Maxine Elliott Theatre in New York – a Somerset Maugham story, later filmed several times, as Sadie Thompson.\n\nIt is not clear whether Nellie and Harry had separated by this time, or whether their careers just took them in different directions, by some sort of mutual agreement.\n\nEarly and tragic deaths\n\nFate did not treat Nellie or Harry well.\n\nIn October 1923, during the long run of Rain in New York, Harry suffered a debilitating stroke, bad enough to keep him off stage and in hospital for some months. With financial support from friends, he returned to Australia in March 1925, and lived with his sister Mary at her home in Lyon Street, Randwick, Sydney.\n\nDespite the positive spin he tried to put on his circumstances – he claimed he was much improved by the sea voyage home – he required nursing and died in 1927, aged 51.\n\nStill working in the US, Nellie was diagnosed with tuberculosis in late 1929. Before the era of antibiotics, bed rest, fresh air and diet were all that could be done to treat the disease. Nellie went into a specialist sanitorium at New York state’s Saranac Lake, run by the National Vaudeville Association. And there she stayed, her progress regularly reported for the benefit of other performers, in the pages of Variety – in a public fashion we would find unthinkable today. In December 1935 Variety reported she was “doing nicely after a slight setback,” but she succumbed to the disease in 1936. She was aged about 50.\n\nHarry and Nellie’s two daughters lived out their lives in the United States.\n\nNellie’s youngest sister Irene eloped with Arthur Pollard after the disastrous 1909 tour, went to England with him and finally married him in New Zealand, in 1925. Nattlie Finlay and step sister Myra Finlay both left the stage. A step brother Nigel Finlay, pursued other interests.\n\nNote 1 – the Pollard tours\n\nBased on Peter Downes work, we might define the Pollard troupes this way:\n\nJames Pollard‘s (Original) Lilliputians (mostly comprising his own children, 1880-1886),\n\nTom Pollard‘s Lilliputians aka the Pollard Opera Company (Australasia, the Far East and South Africa, 1891-1905)\n\nTom Pollard‘s Juvenile Opera Company (mostly Australasia 1907-c1908)\n\nCharles Pollard & Nellie Chester nee Pollard’s Lilliputian Opera Companies (one to South Africa, then generally to the Far East and North America 1896-1910 )\n\nArthur Pollard‘s Company (to the Far East and India 1909-1910)\n\nNellie Chester nee Pollard’s “Pollard Company” (only active in North America 1909-1914 but mostly comprising Australians)\n\nTom Pollard’s troupes are the subject of Peter Downes book The Pollards (2002) – and their members came from across New Zealand and Australia. Charles Pollard & Nellie Chester nee Pollards companies were mostly enlisted from inner Melbourne. Most child actors did not swap companies.\n\nNote 2 – The Finlays and the courts\n\nThere were at least 7 civil cases brought by Charles Pollard & Nellie Chester nee Pollard against members of their troupes, between 1898 and 1904, including several against the Finlay family. Despite the legal wrangling in 1900, Nellie’s youngest sister Irene Finlay joined a Charles Pollard & Nellie Chester nee Pollard troupe to North America. She ended up travelling on five overseas tours with them, reminding us again that the Pollards were running a business and parents of child performers were entering into transactions with them – there was no altruism involved.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nAugust 2022\n\nReferences\n\nText\n\nGillian Arrighi and Victor Emeljanow (2014) Entertaining Children: The participation of youth in the entertainment industry.

Author’s Collection\n\nGrowing up in Australia\n\n“Toots” Pounds was born Doris Sophie Mary Pounds in Melbourne, Australia, on 17 November 1896 to Henry Jouxson Pounds, an English born waiter, and his wife Sophie nee Powles, a woman from Kyneton, Victoria. Toots was the third child of the family – her older sister and performance partner was Lorna Pounds, born Lorna Eva Muriel Pounds on 7 April, 1889.\n\nUntil the time of Toot’s birth, the family lived at 61 Roseberry Street in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. This was where Lorna and brother Harold (b 1890) were born. Their neighbours were respectable, aspirational urban Australians – greengrocers, law clerks, book keepers and tailors. But about the time of Toots’ birth, the family moved to larger houses in inner-city Carlton. We know little of the family’s financial circumstances, but the move to a larger house suggests a change in fortune, perhaps a better job.\n\nLorna attended the Rathdowne Street Primary School in Carlton, but by the early 1900s the family had moved on again, interstate to Sydney, relocating to a modest terrace house at 46 Bligh Street, Newtown, Sydney where another son, Walter also called Noel, was born in 1904.\n\n“Sweet essays in child acting” & the origin of a name\n\nIn late 1904, 8 year old Doris Pounds appeared in Blind Man’s Buff or Her Own Way a new play from US playwright Clyde Fitch, which featured Nellie Stewart. Here she played one of the four child characters, a character named Toots. “It was one of the most natural and sweetest essays in child acting seen on the Melbourne stage for many years” reported Melbourne’s The Argus. And the pet name stuck, apparently.\n\nBoth Toots and Lorna quickly developed reputations as attractive performers, with great stage presence, for such young child actors. In mid 1906 they went on tour together, for producers Clyde Meynell (c1867-1934) and John Gunn (c1869-1909), in the popular melodrama The Fatal Wedding, playing small Australian towns for several months. By 1907, they were developing their own act – which involved clever impersonations of contemporary actors. “That of Miss Tittell Brune… was so life-like that it was hard to believe that it was not Miss Brune actually speaking” reported Table Talk.\n\nAs this writer has noted previously, this was an era when Australian child labour laws were permissive and juvenile performers were regularly in demand to provide popular theatre turns. Like Lorna and Toots, many inner Melbourne children were part of extended acting families – for example, Toots’ 10 year old companion on stage in 1904 had been Ella Nugent (born 1894 and an older sister of future singer Reita Nugent), who in 1909 joined the disastrous Pollard Lilliputian Opera Company tour of India. Queenie Williams (born 1896) was another contemporary, a popular child actor who also appeared in local performances of The Fatal Wedding and then left Australia to accompany the final Pollard tour of the US in 1912. A difference with Toots and Lorna was that they made the transition to being successful adult performers, when so many child performers did not.\n\nTrying their luck in London\n\nMrs Sophie Pounds did not send her daughters overseas to perform with a Pollards troupe, as some inner Melbourne parents did. Rather, she kept Lorna and Toots close at hand, becoming the girls dresser and manager. Interviewed several years later in the US, Lorna described her mother as “a regular old trouper… it makes us work harder when we know she is standing there in (the wings) watching us and listening to the applause…”\n\nIn April 1911, the family decided it was time to “try their luck” on the London stage. Sophie had scraped together enough to pay for third class passages to England on the SS Suevic for herself, Lorna, Toots and her 5 year son Noel. Henry Pounds probably also contributed to the enterprise, although in 1908, he had moved to New Zealand to take up work as Head Waiter at the Grand Hotel in Wellington, later moving to the Clarendon Hotel in Christchurch. The oldest son of the family, 21 year old Harold, stayed in Melbourne Australia, working as a salesman.\n\nTheir act – only 15 minutes long – eventually brought them attention in London, but it took seven months of hard work to be noticed. By December 1911, it was reported that they were making £25 a week.\n\nAmongst the first to document their struggle was William Buchanan-Taylor, a journalist for Sporting Life. Under the heading “Two Clever Girls,” he wrote “Toots and Lorna Pounds are the names of the young Australian girls… It may be recalled that I told of two girls who, having come to England seven months ago, were offered six weeks’ engagement if they were willing to work for nothing. Thanks to Mr Alfred Butt and Mr Jack Hayman, his booking manager, they have been given an opportunity to show what they could do … and… they are being paid for it. They appeared at the Victoria Palace last Monday, and were an immediate and undoubted success… Years later, Mrs Sophie Pounds also told Australian newspapers a similar story of her daughter’s struggle to establish themselves in London. She regretfully explained “we had come to London with plenty of ambition, but no dates (booked).”\n\nTheir act seems to have been a mix of light humour and clever parody, based on close observations they had made of the actual performers. Buchanan-Taylor wrote “Their work consists of mimicry of a high order. Perhaps their most successful item was a scrap… from Kismet, in which the older girl played Oscar Asche’s part, and the younger figured as Lily Brayton. Their reproduction of scene from Sweet Nell of Old Drury in which they played King Charles and Nell respectively, was capitally done. A dramatic fragment, called At the Telephone, is also included in their repertoire… “\n\nToots and Lorna’s act toured throughout the UK as part of a variety lineup, but in August 1913, having signed up with the Orpheum circuit in the US, they departed for New York. Mrs Pounds also went, together with young Noel. Reviewers noted the challenge the girls had in making sure their impressions were topical and updated for US audiences – who needed to see the original performer to appreciate the act. Co-stars in US variety included Australian artist-comedian Bert Levy and cowboy star Will Rogers. Eight months later they were back performing in Britain. Amongst their partners in British variety were George Robey and up and coming singer-dancer Laddie Cliff.\n\nIn September 1916, Harry Pounds travelled to England to rejoin his family. It is unlikely he or any of the Pounds family met oldest son Harold again – he had joined the Australian Army (AIF) in late 1915, arrived in France in March 1916, and was killed in action at Villers-Bretonneux on Christmas Day 1916, and had no known grave – an awful fate shared by so many. Lorna felt his death particularly keenly.\n\nThose spectacular London revues\n\nToots and Lorna’s transition from variety turn to more substantial roles in spectacular revues was a reflection of their success but also a reminder of the other changes at play – particularly with the challenge of cinema as a competing source of entertainment by the mid 1910s. The revues had a kind of loose narrative to them, but over the course of a season the program and actor lineup could easily be refined and changed. The shows were characterised by lots of dancing and singing of catchy tunes, big chorus numbers, and impressive costumes and sets. Not their first big revue, but certainly amongst their most memorable, was The Bing Girls are There at the Alhambra Theatre in 1917, a show that followed the great success of The Bing Boys are Here the year before.\n\nThe great success of this led to another production in the series that ran for most of 1918 – The Bing Boys on Broadway, again at the Alhambra, and with many of the same actors – Violet Loraine, George Robey as well as Toots and Lorna. As music historian Colin Larkin has noted, these productions (and others such as Chu Chin Chow and The Better ‘Ole) served an invaluable entertainment purpose through the dark years of the war.\n\nOver the next eight years, Toots and Lorna appeared in a string of spectacular productions. The long runs of these – usually at the Palladium Theatre – confirm they had become popular favourites on the London stage. The musical comedy Pretty Peggy ran for 168 performances in early 1920. But it was Rockets that was such a standout success in 1922, running for almost 500 performances. Indeed it was such a success that Australian producer Hugh Ward signed them to perform in an Australian version. The entire family had arrived in Australia by June 1923 and Rockets was performed throughout Australia through to December.\n\nWatching Palladium Pleasures several years later, reviewer James Agate felt that Toots and Lorna were the act everyone had come to see – in fact he wrote that they were “the mainstay of these popular reviews.” In the same show, during performances of the song Valencia, Lorna and Toots sometimes threw bunches of violets to their adoring audiences.\n\nAfter appearing in another revue, Sky High, in 1925, in company with Melbourne born baritone Robert Chisholm (1894-1960), both Toots and Lorna took a break from performing. Toots departed for the United States again, taking a role in the operetta The Student Prince for a few months – in Salt Lake City and San Francisco. At about the same time, Lorna returned to Australia for a three month “rest”, although it seems her interest in lengthy sea travel may have had more to do with the Second Officer on P&O’s SS Naldera, Hugh Slinn. In April 1926, a few months after her return to England, Lorna and Hugh married. Toots had returned and was bridesmaid. The girls’ final performances together were in 1927, when presumably, their contracts ran out.\n\nToots Alone\n\nIt is hard not to gain the impression that once Lorna had left the partnership and retired, Toots struggled to find her place. In March 1927 and April 1928, The Sketch and The Tatler reported the sisters holidaying in Cannes, apparently a favourite retreat for the family. In June 1929, London’s The Stage reported Toots was now studying operatic singing. However, in early 1930 she returned to the US for a third time, possibly with an eye to working in Hollywood. Whatever her plan really was, by November 1930 she was back in London again, visiting the Palladium Theatre and a few months later she was on stage in variety again, the London Evening Standard noting that she had developed “a first rate operatic voice.”\n\nIn 1931, Toots also spent some time studying voice in Germany with Alma Schadow, a celebrated Hamburg voice teacher, the experience being “just like… back at school” she recalled.\n\nToots first appeared on radio in September 1933, with Robert Chisholm, in a radio version of the film Waltz Time. Although Chisholm was of a similar age to Toots and Lorna, and they had both spent some of their childhood in Carlton, there is no evidence they knew each other then.\n\nYet, Toots and Robert Chisholm did spend some time in each others company in the US in 1930, as at least one film fan magazine reported them in Hollywood at the same time.\n\nToots continued to alternate variety with radio work and in early 1935, she briefly re-launched herself as a singer with a new stage name – Maria Linda. However, she did not use this name for very long. She continued to appear until the 1940s, including in concerts for the services, but she was generally thought of as an actress of the Great War era, although she was still only aged in her early 40s. She appears to have been active as late as 1953, when The Stage reported her understudying Cicely Courtneige (1893-1980) in the revue Over The Moon.\n\nOver the years, gossip columns associated Toots romantically with several men – including First World War hero Lieutenant Duncan Grinnell-Milne (1896-1973), a pilot and POW escapee from German captivity, and later Director Norman Lee (1898-1964). In June 1945 she married William “Bucky” Buchanan-Taylor – the journalist who had first reported the girls’ act thirty years before. She nursed Bucky through a long illness before his death in March 1958.\n\nLorna died in 1963. Toots’ death in January 1976 was recorded in an obituary in The Stage. Youngest brother Noel Pounds also appears to have tried his luck as an actor, although his success is currently unknown.\n\nNote 1: Toots’ birth\n\nBorn late in 1896, Toots’ birth wasn’t registered until 5 January 1897, hence it has a 1897 code. This has mislead some to think she was born that year. However, this anomaly with reporting is not uncommon with some late-in-the-year Australian births. The family address on her birth certificate was given as 115 Rathdown(e) st Carlton, but this features regularly as a rental property in newspapers of the time, and rate books and city directories do not show the family living there. The only Harry Pounds in Carlton at the time was living nearby at 214 Elgin Street in 1900. The family’s oldest son, Harold John Pounds, lived in North Carlton until 1914.\n\nNote 2: Toots on the screen\n\nThere are several internet claims that Toots Pounds appeared as an extra in British films in the 1940s and 50s. This writer has not be able to verify these, and the few photos of Toots circulating appear to show a much older woman.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nSept 2023\n\nReferences\n\nText:\n\n* Elisabeth Kumm (March 2016) The La Trobe Journal.

In 1923, Fred Niblo described her as “the finest actress in Australia.”\n\nThe Five Second Version\n\nGwen Burroughs (or Gwen Day Burroughs more often in later life) was born into a non-theatrical family in Melbourne, Australia. She was on stage for JC Williamsons, the Australian theatre monopoly, from her late teens, usually in ingénue roles. She made close friendships with Enid Bennett and Fred Niblo, and benefitted by appearing in support of touring players Nellie Stewart, Marie Tempest and Ethel Irving. She travelled to the US to perform in 1923, and although she returned to Australia, her 1930s New York stage work established her reputation. After 1936, she worked continually in radio in Britain, with only occasional returns to the stage. She appeared in one 1915 Australian film that has not survived.\n\nShe was probably engaged to actor Lewis Willoughby, but the couple parted company in 1918, and Gwen announced her intention to “divorce” him in 1923. Fred Niblo’s ringing endorsement about her skills as an actor dates from the same time.\n\nInterviewed in 1947 for Radio Who’s Who, she listed one of her recreations as “sea travel,” which was fortunate, as she is amongst the best travelled Australian actors of the era. She died in London in 1968.\n\nAustralian career\n\nBorn in Melbourne, Australia, in 1888, she was named Gwendoline Helena Burroughs at birth, adopting “Day Burroughs” later in life. Her mother was Lizzie nee Harwood, her father was Thomas Melbourne Burroughs, a successful ship chandler (supplier) who turned his hand to being a grazier in 1906. Gwen attended Methodist Ladies College in Kew, where she appears to have excelled in the creative arts.\n\nAt the age of twenty she was associated with amateur theatricals at Melbourne’s Savage Club, and by 1909, she was appearing professionally on Nellie Stewart’s (1858-1931) long Australian tour, playing (she later recalled) “in the funniest little out of the way places imaginable” – in Sweet Kitty Bellairs – where she reportedly also understudied the star. While Nellie Stewart’s own hefty autobiography contains only passing reference to Gwen, the young actor’s exposure to her – and then British actress Ethel Irving (1869-1963), was profound. “You have no idea what encouragement I have received from those two women,” she said. Early interviews also noted the influence of theatrical entrepreneur George Musgrove (1854-1916) on her career.\n\nGwen’s great success in ingénue roles made her a regular subject of newspaper interviews early in her career. At 1.72cms (5’8″) in height she was taller than many of her contemporaries, with flashing dark brown eyes and black hair, and a clear, well modulated voice suited to the stage, almost certainly the product of elocution lessons that middle class Australians so valued. By 1913, some newspapers went so far as to predict this “modest Australian” would someday “be a star.” Like so many Australian actors of the era, she was also developing plans to go to overseas to work, “some day, soon.” That plan appears to have been delayed by the outbreak of war in 1914 – but she stayed very busy. The Ausstage database entry for Gwen, which is not definitive, lists about twenty stage shows in Australia between 1911 and 1918.\n\nSylvia Bremer, Enid Bennett and Fred Niblo were colleagues and friends in the Australian theatre world and their assistance would be invaluable when she tried to establish herself in the US.\n\nGwen’s one Australian movie appearance was in Monte Luke’s 1915 For Australia, a now lost film made by JC Williamson’s. Loosely based on the sinking of the German raider SMS Emden by the Australian ship HMAS Sydney in late 1914, film historians Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper note that despite the topicality of the script, it was not a success. The JC Williamson film studio was an experiment and it closed later that year.\n\nEnter Lewis Willoughby 1915\n\nSometime in late 1914 or early 1915, Gwen met newly arrived English actor Lewis Willoughby. Interviewed at length by Melbourne’s Table Talk in late 1914, Willoughby had a great deal to say about acting and many other things, but was also intrigued by the young democracies of Australia and New Zealand – where women could vote. Did they exercise their right to vote? And what was the attitude of Australian women to the suffragette movement, he wondered. He spent the next three years touring and performing in Australia and New Zealand – sometimes with Gwen.\n\nIn April 1917, after a successful tour of New Zealand, Gwen and Lewis joined Marie Tempest’s (1862-1942) company in Melbourne. Tempest was then part the way through a world performance tour. A few years later, Gwen acknowledged Tempest as one of her mentors in a long, self authored article for Australia’s Triad magazine, although her commentary on Tempest’s and Ethel Irving’s various concerns with their weight was not entirely diplomatic.\n\nGwen and Lewis’ marriage was first mentioned in a newspaper report in September 1915. It would be easy to dismiss this as a muddled up account, except that shipping manifests in 1918 indicate the couple reported each other as dependent spouses when travelling to the US that year. Yet there appears to be no corresponding marriage certificate in Australia or New Zealand, suggesting that while they may have intended to marry, they never actually did so. See also Note 1 below, regarding Lewis’ English wife and family\n\nEstablishing herself internationally\n\nIn early 1918, Gwen and Lewis Willoughby apparently reached a decision to work in the US – and Lewis went first. He found employment quite soon after arriving in California. In March 1918, Moving Picture World announced he would be appearing in the film Treasure of the Sea, with Edith Storey (1892-1967) – this marked the start of his modest film career as an actor and director. 30 year old Gwen “Willoughby” then arrived in California in May 1918, determined to seek work in films – in “Vampire” parts, it was reported. But she only stayed in the US for a few months – returning home in August. It seems this was also the end of her relationship with Willoughby (See Note 1 below). Over the next decade she continued to use the name Willoughby when travelling to the US, which probably relates to the documents she first presented.\n\nOn stage in Sydney again, she was soon proving herself a well established favourite with audiences and demonstrating considerable versatility – for example, in early 1919 she was performing Ibsen and musical comedy at the same time.\n\nIn 1921, she met Enid Bennett’s younger sister Marjorie Bennett, who had been enticed back to Australia by JC Williamson’s to perform in farces and musicals, and the two performed together with English comedian Joseph Coyne in His Lady Friends. They also appeared together in Johnny Get Your Gun. Probably with encouragement from the Bennetts, in March 1923, she made a second trip to California, arriving there at about the same time as Marjorie.\n\nAlthough she again travelled using the name Gwen Willoughby, this time the passenger list contained no contact details for a husband. Instead, a pencilled annotation on the passenger list shows she was to stay with Enid Bennett and family. And soon after arrival she announced again that she planned to get roles in films, and that she was also looking forward to “getting a divorce” from Willoughby. She hoped this would “give me a new start all around.” However, as with a marriage certificate, no records of a divorce have been found. In her 1921 piece for The Triad, she made the following unusual comment about publicity that actors sometimes face – that hangs awkwardly at the end of the article: “any divorce case, any breach of promise case, is dissected to the most minute detail… People are inclined to forget that the same unfortunate occurrences may thrust themselves into the very best regulated families…” But the article made no direct reference to Lewis Willoughby.\n\nIn California there were no film offers, but she was offered a role in the bedroom farce Getting Gertie’s Garter, with Marjorie Bennett, probably courtesy the rousing endorsement from Fred Niblo – who announced that Gwen was “the finest actress in the whole of Australia.” However, after running for 11 weeks at the Egan Theatre, the play ended up in court for its “indecency.” It was also very good publicity – and in the photo below, none of the cast look very worried. Changes were apparently made to the script by order of the court. The play then ran on for another four weeks.\n\nIn 1924, Gwen toured up and down the US east coast, some of the time appearing in the popular mystery The Last Warning, the entertaining tale of a haunted theatre. In June she appeared in One Helluva Night on Broadway with a group of actors calling themselves the “Cheese Club”. It was a one-night comedy performance, their intention was to run a play so bad it would be entertaining, and according to the New York Times the Cheese Club achieved this object – “a play so crazy in spots that it is funny.” But it was not funny enough to run again, apparently.\n\nGwen returned to Australia again in March 1926.\n\nIn Australia she toured in another string of JC Williamson’s productions, including The Last of Mrs. Cheyney and Brown Sugar. Then, in late 1927 Gwen Day Burroughs travelled to London by the ship Cathay, apparently still restless, or determined to test out new opportunities. By 1928 she was in a supporting role in the comedy Her Past, first at the Lewisham Hippodrome, and then moving to the Shaftesbury and Prince of Wales Theatres in 1929. But then, again, there was another change. In October 1930, Gwen “Willoughby” arrived in New York, with a contract to appear in a US version of the Frank Harvey play The Last Enemy – which opened at the Schubert Theatre in November. Reviews were mixed and the play only ran for a few nights. Not so Ivor Novello’s The Truth Game, which opened in New York a month later, with Gwen in a supporting role. It ran for over 100 performances, and was described by one journalist as “a nice clean, diverting evening in the theatre.” Active on the New York and US east coast stage for six years, she was now usually described as a “highly competent” member of a supporting cast – but she was no longer a leading player.\n\nA career on British radio\n\nIn December 1936, Gwen Willoughby sailed back to England again. And finally, she settled down in the one place to build a career. As early as 1934, Gwen had appeared in US radio dramas and in England, radio also became her speciality – for the next 35 years. The BBC’s very thorough list of actors and programs notes her first broadcast performance in 1937, with more than three hundred and eighty entries to 1968. Her radio career is also noteworthy for its variety.\n\nGwen’s experience in the US meant American roles became her speciality. Her work included original entertainments such as He’s Got Rhythm (based on the life of Cole Porter), Saddle Song (the life of Gene Autry) and Banjo Eyes (the life of Eddie Cantor). There were also radio versions of films such as Mr Deeds Goes to Town (1939) and Sunny Side Up (1939). When war broke out, her work switched to BBC forces radio. By the late 1940s she was a regular performer for The Children’s Hour and narrated The Woman’s Hour.\n\nBy the 1950s, there were even a few Australian authored plays and radio programs that made use of her talents. In 1950 for example, the BBC ran a ten part serial based on Rolf Boldrewood’s bushranger novel Robbery Under Arms – with numerous London-based Australian actors in the cast, including John Wood, Dorothy Alison, Gwenda Wilson, Don Sharp and Gwen. The C19th Australian novel The Mystery of a Hansom Cab was serialised, (Gwen played the character role of Mother Guttersnipe) and in 1958 Vernon Harris’s series The Flying Doctor required voice artists, presumably capable of distinctive Australian accents. In 1959, she appeared in the live play Kookaburra. Set in rural Queensland c1910, it was a “kind of Australian ‘Oklahoma'” and featuring fellow Australians Maggie Fitzgibbon (1929-2020) and Bettina Dickson (1920-1994). It ran for a short time regionally and then at London’s Princes Theatre, where it met with mixed reviews.\n\nIn March 1955, 67 year old Gwen returned to Australia, to see her younger sister Adele and her family, and probably to test out whether she wanted to stay long term. She found work as a regular in a series of one hour radio dramas directed by Henry Cuthbertson for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). She stayed for ten months, but was back in London by January 1956. She continued her British radio career almost to the time of her death in 1968. Amongst her last performances was a celebrated dramatization of E M Forster’s A Passage to India, which also featured Sybil Thorndyke (1882-1976).\n\nFor many years Gwen lived alone at Collingwood House on Dolphin Square in London. She died in a Kensington nursing home on 3 April 1968.\n\nNote 1- Lewis Willoughby (c 1876-1968)\n\nLewis Willoughby, who before his Australian experience had performed and designed for the theatre in London and Glasgow, already had a family – artist wife Vera and two children – in England, but later went on to a long personal and professional relationship with US based, British-born actress Olga Petrova (Muriel Harding). He appeared in her play Hurricane in 1923 at New York’s Frolic Theatre – in the same year Gwen arrived to stay with the Bennetts in California. Lewis and Olga married in September 1939, following the death in England of his first wife, artist Vera Willoughby, in May*. He died in Florida in 1968. In the US, his name was generally spelled Louis.\n\n*The claim that Vera Willoughby was born in Hungary is wrong. She was born in England as Vera Christie, but she also used the name Vera Petrovna during the 1920s. Her father was British mathematician James Robert Christie (1814-1879).\n\nNick Murphy\n\nJune 2022\n\nReferences\n\nText:\n\nCyrus Andrews (1947) Radio Who’s Who.

Spotlight Directory 1936, Author’s collection\n\nThe five second version\n\nWhen 75 year old “Janet Lind” was interviewed as a guest on a Melbourne nostalgia radio programme in 1978, the audience must have wondered what all the fuss was about. While Alex Kenworthy’s programme played plenty of her music, she said little that informed listeners about her achievements, and Kenworthy was poorly prepared – even to the point of not being aware she was Australian born. One must conclude she had either forgotten these achievements, or really didn’t want to discuss her working life.\n\nThis is surprising, because her reputation as a dancer on the Australian stage was an impressive one – even before she was an adult. In 1920 the Sydney Referee reported 15 year old Reita as “One of the pleasant surprises awaiting the visitor to [the play] Yes Uncle!, at Her Majesty’s… [Her] terpsichorean abilities not possessed by many of her profession.”\n\nReita’s Australian career 1909-1926\n\nBorn Margaurite Olive Nugent in South Melbourne, Australia in 1905, “Reita” or “Rita” was the fifth child of Margaret nee O’Shea and Michael Joseph Nugent, a Victorian Railways employee. The two oldest children of the family – Ella (born 1894) and Patrick (born 1896) both performed in the ill-fated Pollards Opera Company tour of India in 1909-1910. Despite the experience, both continued performing for some time. Brothers Len (born 1902) and Ray (born 1900) also became performers.\n\nReita’s earliest appearances on stage began when she was only five years old – she was noted as being in the chorus of Sweet County Kerry at Melbourne’s Bijou Theatre, in July 1909. This suggests that the Nugent family, by now living in Gore Street in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, had made a conscious decision that all their children should pursue careers on the stage. As this writer has noted elsewhere, this was not simply a matter of obliging an early interest by a child. It was a pathway to opportunity and wealth that was otherwise not possible for working class families. In the case of Ella and Patrick, the Nugent parents were party to an agreement with Arthur Pollard, who was taking the children on an overseas performance tour with other juveniles – and intending to be away for a year or more. The Nugents were paid via a trust fund.\n\nIn later life, Reita was inclined to suggest that she was self-taught as a dancer and singer, and in her 1978 radio interview she made no reference to tutors or mentors. However, contemporary newspaper reports confirm that she was a student of Melbourne dance teacher Jennie Brenan for most of the ten years 1916-1926.\n\nThe Ausstage Live Performance Database lists at least twenty-five Australian performances for her – the names Reita and Rita were used interchangeably. The lists also indicate that she began a serious stage career at the age of 11 or 12, and then worked almost continually – for JC Williamsons’ troupes – as a featured dancer, often in partnership with Jack Hooker. Interviewed in 1923, she stated a wish to become a singer and move into roles in musical comedy. She did so – at the end of 1924 she had her first major speaking part in Betty, while a few months later she was dancing AND singing in Primrose, “with charm.” One newspaper reviewer asked “Why, why doesn’t some enterprising producer make a star of Reita? She is a magnificent dancer, and can sing and speak pleasingly. The dancing was superb.”\n\nReita in Europe and Britain 1926+\n\nClearly ambitious, when a chance to perform overseas arose in 1926, Reita took it. She left Australia in June 1926 with a contract to perform in a touring variety show in Berlin, Vienna and Paris, alongside Australian dance partner Charlie Brooks – although this was, again, in specialist dance numbers and part of a larger show. Reita’s footsteps across Europe in 1926-1927 are faint, but the variety tour she joined, likely began in Berlin. When the show reached Paris in March 1927, Paris-Midi provided a rare critical review of her performance which may also have highlighted a challenge she was experiencing: “Reita Nugent has at least as much talent as [Brooks] and she dances just as well. [But] it seems quite inaccurate to consider their complicated exercises as a dance. A dance has a rhythm… Certainly, Charlie Brooks and Reita Nugent are excellent acrobats, but… without rhythm… Moreover, they seem to forget that comedy is born of observation and simplicity. The complexity of the act… evokes the idea of ​​a terribly concerted effort. I don’t think effort, toil and application have ever provoked laughter.“ The reader can view Reita’s unique and acrobatic style of dancing here, in the short British Pathe newsreel entitled “India Rubber Muscles,” filmed in 1928. Perhaps, while popular with some audiences, a career in acrobatic dancing was hard work, plus – as a niche area of performance, not likely to lead to anything else.\n\nBack in London her ability as a dancer and singer saw her in the supporting role of Peggy in the new George and Ira Gershwin musical about bootlegging, Oh Kay! in late 1927. While The Times felt the plot was “incomprehensible” and the music “commonplace,” it was a success with audiences, running for over 200 performances at Her Majesty’s Theatre. In April 1928, she appeared in a long run ofStanley Lupino’s So this is Love with old colleagues from the Australian stage, Cyril Ritchard and Madge Elliott. Ritchard and Elliott were good enough friends to attend Reita’s wedding to English businessman William Fairbairn Hall in August 1931.\n\nThen, following a long run at the Hippodrome in Mr Cinders, Reita went to Berlin with a German version of the play. Years later her young Australian dance partner Renee Murphy recalled that performing this gender-reversed version of the Cinderella story, in German, was “heavy weather” because of cultural differences in humour. However, German reviews of Reita’s “extraordinary dancing” were enthusiastic.\n\nReita tries the US 1931-2\n\nReita and her husband travelled to the US soon after her wedding, and she did not return to London until December 1932. On her return to Australia ten years later, she gave some accounts of what she had done in the US. She said she had appeared in a 1931 tour of the play Gay Divorce with Fred Astaire and Clare Luce. She also claimed she used the names Judy Kent, Janet Lorraine and Janet Faye, because of problems with Actors Equity. Perhaps. However, there is no evidence of a person going by any of these names in the touring cast, or when it opened on Broadway on November 29 1932. In her 1941 Australian accounts, Reita also claimed that she had trained in dance while in the US, which is plausible. She also mentioned performing in unspecified “variety,” but what this work entailed seems impossible to verify.\n\nBecoming Janet Lind 1935 +\n\nOn her return to London Reita appeared in another musical, the spectacular Ball at the Savoy, at the Drury Lane. However, at the same time she was increasingly involved with BBC radio, and appeared as a singer and dancer in some of the very early televised programmes, available only to the handful of people with television receivers at the time, and unfortunately lost to us today.\n\nSometime in September 1935 Reita signed up with agent Cecilia Arcana, or Madame Arcana as she liked to be called. A former singer and now also a voice coach (see Note 1 below), Madame’s management coincided with the start of Reita’s serious singing career and possibly it was she who helped Reita find a new stage name and made connections. In October 1935 Madame announced Janet Lind as her new “find,” performing in a radio version of the comic opera Veronique. The name Reita Nugent disappeared overnight. But it was not until August 1936, five months later, that there was public acknowledgement Janet Lind really was the well known Reita Nugent.\n\nIt is difficult to be certain how much influence Madame had on Reita, particularly as neither made reference to the other in later years. However, it is the case that the glamorous studio photos (see top of article and below) date from this time, as does Reita’s first appearance, now as Janet Lind, performing in the BBC programme Music from the Movies with conductor Louis Levy and the Gaumont British Orchestra. In various interviews, Reita suggested she auditioned several times as a singer before she was successful. Given that Reita’s singing voice had already been heard and remarked upon in 1924, it appears that she was indeed, naturally very talented. However, it would be unusual for an Australian who had finished formal education at age 12 to have developed the singing voice we hear in her surviving recordings without some training.\n\nAs Janet Lind, Reita performed for the BBC almost continuously between 1936 and 1940. In addition to singing (most famously music from films), she appeared in radio versions of musical comedies, varieties and apparently also dramas. By 1939 she was also compering radio programmes for the armed forces. The slogan “The girl with the smile in her voice” also dates from this busy pre-war period.\n\nSurviving recordings of her performances with Louis Levy in the late 1930s are easily found – a number are listed at the end of this article. Also existing (click here) is one of her performances with Webster Booth (1902-1984), which collectors Stephen Langley and Jean Collen suggest showcases her singing at its best.\n\nJanet Lind returns to Australia 1940\n\nIn August 1940, Reita and her husband decided to leave Britain for Australia, via the USA. They departed Liverpool, bound for New York on the SS Samaria. In the US, Reita sang several times for radio stations, but the couple were in Sydney by early October. A performer newly returned to Australia from the London scene, and of Reita’s prowess, was a novelty in 1940 and there were numerous newspaper reports.\n\nIn April 1941, Reita joined ABC radio’s Out of the Bag, a light entertainment style programme featuring Australian comedian Dick Bentley, who had also recently arrived home from London. It had been devised by another recent returnee – Harry Pringle (1903-1985), whom Reita had known in London, ten years before.\n\nAs for so many people, the Second World War seems to have changed Reita’s fortunes. Her husband joined the Army, while she continued performing on Australian radio, however there were fewer live performances – the last possibly being a US forces musical in 1944. By 1948, it seems she had drifted into an entirely new career, as Australian newspapers reported that she was now an interior designer, and now used the name Jane Hall.\n\nAlthough she lived in the Melbourne suburb of Toorak in the late 1960s and 1970s, she appears to have moved above the second hand shop she ran in Fitzroy soon after her husband’s death in 1984. Her death certificate clearly states her place of residence was 345 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, and that she also went by the name Jane Hall. While Australian newspapers appear to have missed her passing, British newspapers did not. The London Daily Telegraph ran an obituary reminding British readers of her past success as a singer, with her “light, well-articulated voice of refreshing clarity”, and stating that she had taken up singing under the guidance of Madame Arcana.\n\nNote 1\n\nMadame Cecilia Arcana (Olive or Mary Clifton c1887-1969) had a career on the English stage as a singer before becoming a teacher of voice and elocution. She ran her own agency in London from about 1930 until 1940 when she moved to the US and attempted to reestablish herself. In the early 1950s she settled in Kings Cross, Sydney, where she again took up teaching voice and elocution. She died in Sydney in May 1969. To the end of her days she remained proud of the performers she had mentored and convinced of her almost mystic ability to predict success – although she did not mention Janet Lind again after the initial announcement noted above. In 1967 she predicted “Mark my words! Don Lane will become an international film star of the first water” US born Don Lane (1933-2009) did become a popular Australian TV presenter but not a film star. She was inclined to speak about herself in a most grandiloquent way, as this advertisement in The Era illustrates.\n\nSpecial thanks\n\nto Stephen Langley for assistance with this account.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University\n\nJanet McCalman (1979), ‘Brenan, Jennie Frances (1877- 1964)’, accessed online 10 May 2022.\n\nJohn Rickard (1996) ‘Ritchard, Cyril Joseph (1897–1977)’, shared entry with Elliott, Leah Madeleine (1896-1955) accessed online 17 May 2022.\n\nF.

She travelled to the US in December 1916 to join Enid. Famous in later years for “cheerful, white haired woman” roles, by the time of her death she had over 200 film and TV appearances to her credit. (TCM and the IMDB provide lists of her screen appearances after 1946.) Much less well known is that before 1946 she had already enjoyed a long career as a stage actress, including a successful twenty-eight month performance tour back to Australia, where she developed something of a reputation for “saucy theatre” in the process. When she died in June 1982, she was so well known that almost every notable US newspaper carried her obituary.\n\nYounger sister Catherine Bennett also briefly appeared in Hollywood films.\n\nLeft: Marjorie Bennett as an ingenue, in the play The Taming of Bab, at the Royal Playhouse, California, 1924.\n\nThe Bennett family\n\nThe Bennett girls from Western Australia – Enid (born 1893) , Marjorie (born 1896) and step-sister Catherine (born 1901) all ended up living and working in California’s booming film industry. However all three women had a different experience – Enid preferred screen work, Marjorie spent twenty years on stage before returning to film, while Catherine briefly tried stage and screen and then rejected both.\n\nEnid Bennett was the first to go the United States – in June 1915, appearing on stage in New York later that year. This followed several years performing in Australia with the Fred Niblo–Josephine Cohan Troupe, and appearances in two Australian films directed by Niblo. Her Australian story is told here.\n\nWhile Enid’s path to the stage and screen is well documented, Marjorie’s is less so. It was US film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times who gleaned much information from Marjorie while she was alive. Reading these accounts today, one gains the impression she was a woman with a strong sense of self, a healthy sense of humour and held in high esteem by many in the industry. In 1977, Rick Rosner, a producer and writer for the popular TV series CHiPs told her “you are the sun on a cloudy day. When you arrive everything becomes beautiful.” A nice compliment for an 80 year old, still hard at work.\n\nEnid, Marjorie and Catherine’s mother was Nellie nee Walker. After the death of her first husband Francis Bennett in 1898 and second husband Alexander Gillespie in 1903, Nellie Gillespie moved her family from Western Australia back to Sydney, to the comfortable suburb she had been born in – Woollahra, where she apparently ran a boarding house at No 20 Newcastle Street, Rose Bay. In response to letters from a homesick Enid in Hollywood, Marjorie was sent to keep her older sister company. Marjorie arrived in the US in December 1916 on the SS Ventura, accompanied by just two pieces of luggage and on a tourist visa. She recalled that she didn’t want to go to the US and certainly “didn’t want to be an actress.” By this time, Enid had already appeared on stage and in her first Thomas Ince film, A Princess of the Dark and her star was rising. The sisters lived together in an apartment in Los Angeles and there is some evidence they had a jolly time of it, socialising with various celebrities and sometimes the other Australians working in Hollywood. Soon after, Marjorie was also convinced to appear in a film for Ince, reportedly The Girl, Glory, where Enid had a leading role.\n\nThe family together in the US\n\nNellie Gillespie arrived in the US in January 1918, with her younger children Catherine and Alexander. Several dramatic events had impacted the family at this time. One was the tragic death of Francis or “Reg”, the oldest of the Bennett children and a Lieutenant in the Australian Army, killed in action in Belgium in October 1917 The second, a happier piece of news, was the impending wedding of Enid and Fred Niblo. The couple married in February 1918. Niblo went on to become one of Hollywood’s leading directors while Enid’s fame as a star soared. By the early 1920s the couple were very well known figures in the industry – perhaps “Hollywood royalty” might be the term.\n\nTouring with Julian Eltinge and a return to Australia\n\nUnlike Enid, it is difficult to find Marjorie showing any interest in acting while growing up in Australia. It appears she owed her entree to Hollywood films entirely to her sister Enid and the counsel of Fred Niblo. Marjorie appeared in three films in 1918, including Naughty Naughty with Enid. Motion Picture directories of the time listed her as a suitable ingenue type.\n\nAnd then at the end of 1918, as she recalled when interviewed by Kevin Thomas, she gave up the screen to try the stage. In fact, for the next eight months she performed with famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge(1881-1941), touring throughout the US.\n\nEltinge was very well known in the US and had appeared successfully in vaudeville, several films and musical theatre by the time of the tour. His 1919 revue was firmly in the vaudeville tradition and included Marjorie and fellow Australian Arthur Shirley (1886-1967) in the cast. Historians Cullen, Hackman and McNeilly estimate that Eltinge may have been earning $3,500 per week before the tour, an enormous sum for a performer at the time, which possibly indicates how lucrative working with him was for Marjorie. But given that female impersonators soon came to be regarded as thoroughly improper entertainment, it is hardly surprising that later biographies of the careers of Marjorie Bennett and Arthur Shirley don’t make mention of this lengthy tour, while the memory of Julian Eltinge has also been buried.\n\nIn the later part of 1920, the Australian theatre firm JC Williamsons, enticed Marjorie back to Australia to perform with another import – Joseph Coyne (1867-1941) – in farces including Nightie Night, My Lady Friends and Wedding Bells. Clearly someone representing Williamsons, probably Hugh Ward, had seen her perform in the US and thought highly enough of her to bring her back.\n\nThe Coyne company tour of major cities in Australia and New Zealand was a success. Coyne left for England in December 1921, but Marjorie stayed on. She then performed in another string of farces and comedies – Johnny Get Your Gun, The First Year and Parlor, Bedroom and Bath, in company with other visiting actors brought in by JC Williamsons, including Louis Bennison and Phillips Tead.\n\nAlthough she often spoke to reporters of her “home” now being in California, in August 1922 she told Table Talk that she didn’t want to go back to the US just yet. “All the rest of the family is in California, and mother keeps writing to ask when I am going back; but I want to make good in my native country before I leave it. I never realised how fascinating Australia is until I left it… There’s nothing like seeing other countries to make one appreciate one’s own.” The comment was the sort Australians liked to hear and was shared nationwide. Significantly, she also expressed her preference for the stage very clearly, despite Enid’s success on the screen back in Hollywood.\n\nIn Australia, Marjorie felt confident enough to speak publicly occasionally about Hollywood matters – including the death of Virginia Rappe in September 1921, after news broke. Finally, in late March 1923, she boarded the SS Sonoma for California.\n\nTrouble with Getting Gertie’s Garter\n\nIf Australian newspapers thought Parlor, Bedroom and Bath was a bit “saucy,” this was not the case with Marjorie’s first play on returning to Los Angeles. While the reports surrounding the court appearance of the cast of Getting Gertie’s Garter created a blaze of publicity – and what wonderful publicity – it seems likely the play really was pulled for “indecency” several weeks after the start of its run at the Frank Egan Theatre in 1923. Changes were apparently made to the script by order of the court.\n\nOf course, this was an era of publicity stunts and outrageously silly stories – all in the interests of self-promotion. For example, reports about Marjorie’s newly arrived Australian friend and costar Gwen Burroughs (1888-1968) made much of her reputation as a film star “vamp” (and impending divorce from Lewis Willoughby), yet she had only appeared in one Australian film and none in the US. Consider also the very dramatic story about Lotus Thompson and the “acid” on her legs stunt, which surfaced in early 1925 and continues to dominate accounts of her life, even 100 years later.\n\nOnly a few months later, another newspaper report suggested that Enid was concerned with a part Marjorie had taken in the play The Adding Machine, as a “scarlet woman,” and insisted she withdraw. Possibly. But the story has all the hallmarks of another publicity stunt.\n\nMarjorie’s stage performances over the next twenty years were many – and in a variety of theatre styles, but they reflected the popular tastes of the time, such as the romantic comedy Loose Ankles, which opened at Los Angeles’ Playhouse Theatre in early 1927. In the 1930s she was also in one act plays for the Writers Club , radio dramas and occasionally more traditional plays – including a stage version of A Tale of Two Cities in 1933 and the drama The Shining Hour at the Beverley Hills Little Theatre in 1937. Comedies and bedroom farces prevailed however – as a quick survey of titles suggest – Wedding Night (1941), Two in a Bed (1944) and Motel Wives (1945).\n\nUnfortunately, we have few clues regarding the reason for her steady twenty-year preference for the stage whilst living in the midst of Hollywood’s thriving film industry – or her sister Catherine’s rejection of both stage and screen as a career in 1926 (see Note 1 below). It is noteworthy that in the 1940 US census she described herself as a “motion picture actress.” By contrast, in the 1930 US census, she had stated her occupation and industry as the “legitimate stage.” Unfortunately, US journalists, even the diligent Kevin Thomas, tended to brush over Marjorie’s activities for the entire period 1924-46. Perhaps Marjorie did some very mundane extra work in films in the later 1930s and early 40s, that has yet to be discovered.\n\n200 screen characters\n\nMarjorie Bennett’s first known later-in-life film role was an uncredited appearance as a shop assistant in Universal’s Sherlock Holmes film Dressed to Kill (1946). Here, she portrayed a cheerful white haired woman character for the first time. With her white hair usually tied in a distinctive “crown braid,” she repeated this role numerous times over the next thirty years. Why she re-embraced the screen as a career at this time is unknown, but it was a successful move and by the 1970s – with more than 200 appearances behind her, she was so familiar for US audiences that she was also being used in television commercials – for Ford cars and Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nOn her passing, Kevin Thomas wrote that she was the “classical little old lady with a mischievous gleam in her eye.“ But this writer is of the view her success was not simply because she was effective at playing a stereotyped older woman. She was also versatile – as shown by her appearance at the end of Have Rocket, Will Travel with the Three Stooges. Here, she dances cheerfully with Joe and then neatly pulls a punch thrown at Nadia Sanders. All those years learning stagecraft had paid off.\n\nMarjorie also displayed versatility with her accent. In Limelight (1952), her second film with Charles Chaplin, she played landlady Mrs Alsop, sporting (what sounds like) a broad Australian accent. Set in London but filmed in Hollywood, most viewers probably heard Mrs Alsop as a working class Londoner. Yet in her many TV guest roles of the 50s and 60s, such as Lassie, The Real McCoys and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis her accent had changed to sit comfortably alongside a variety of American accents.\n\nOf the examples of her screen work reviewed by this writer, the trademark of her performances seems to have been an irrepressible good humour.\n\nAccording to her many obituaries, she had finally retired in 1980, aged 84, due to failing health. She died two years later in June 1982. In May 1933, in Tijuana, Mexico, she had married Bill Cady, a singer, with whom she had occasionally performed. The couple had no children of their own but seem to have enjoyed close relationships with their nephews and nieces.\n\nMarjorie’s recollections of Hollywood in the late 1910s, 1920s and 1930s appear in the press interviews she gave in the 1970s and her obituaries. Her accounts of meeting the likes of Valentino, Mary Pickford, mentoring a young Robert Taylor, and working with Charles Chaplin are generally based on real events, even if there are some errors in detail and timing.\n\nNote 1: Catherine Bennett (1901-1978)\n\nCatherine Fanny Bennett (or Gillespie) was a step sister to Enid and Marjorie Bennett. Born in Perth, Western Australia on 17 January 1901, she arrived in the US with her mother and brother Alexander in early 1918.\n\nAfter some extra work in Robin Hood in 1921, Catherine appeared in a leading role in a Stan Laurel short, When Knights Were Cold in 1923. But her few public comments reveal an ambivalence about a career in acting and suggests that she had little desire to try to copy Enid’s success. Despite showing “a great deal of dramatic talent” and being heralded as a new MGM ingenue, by late 1926 she had left it behind, and taken up secretarial work in a studio – in some accounts she was also described as a scenario writer. Although romantically associated with producer John Considine for a while, she did not marry. She died in 1978.\n\nEnid, Marjorie and Catherine’s younger brother Alexander Gillespie (1903-1978) used the surname Bennett for much of his life and married silent actress Frances Lee (1906-2000) in 1933. While he is often described as an Assistant Director in Hollywood, his 1931 US naturalisation papers reveal he was an auditor-accountant.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nApril 2022\n\nReferences\n\nText:\n\nKevin Brownlow (1968) The Parade’s Gone By… University of California Press\n\nAndrew Pike & Ross Cooper (1980) Australian film 1900-1977, P224-226.

Private Collection, used with kind permission.\n\nReconstructing the lives of those for whom there are limited sources of information is difficult. This is the case with Joan Lang and her first husband Joss Ambler, and it also explains why so much written about them is wrong – most notably the oft-repeated claim that Ambler was married to US actress June Lang (1917-2005). Joan and Joss were both capable actors, but they seem to have been quickly consigned to character roles and passing appearances, and without direct family to preserve their memories, much of their history has been lost.\n\nJoan’s childhood in Australia\n\nBorn in Queensland, Australia on November 17, 1911, Joan Olive Agnes Lang was the only child of Andrew Lang and Olive nee Hopkins. (Also see Note 1 below) They were not a theatrical family, but it seems that her experiences at the Hermitage, a Geelong girls’ school, helped foster a passion for performing. In 1929, her final year at the school, she was picked out for particular praise for her performance as Mrs Pringle in a production of Marigold.“So excellent a portrayal was given… [bringing] an impression of vivid reality to all the scenes…” Reportedly also a good pianist, dancer and vocalist, Joan was the director and a leading actor in a number of charity productions in regional Victoria in 1931-2, in aid of returned servicemen.\n\nFollowing some work in Melbourne Little Theatre, in May 1933 Joan landed a small role in actor-director Pat Hanna‘s newest film – Waltzing Matilda, alongside other up and coming Melbourne actors Coral Browne and Joss Ambler. Film historians Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper describe the film as “studio bound and slow,” and it was not a success, despite Hanna’s popularity on stage as a knockabout Australian (or “digger”) comedian. Young women in Hanna’s films (like the very young Mary Maguire in Diggers in Blighty) tended to be relegated to very secondary roles – the humorous narrative was the domain of Hanna and his costar Joe Valli.\n\nA few months later Joan took a role in actor-director Gregan McMahon’s production of Schoolgirls in Uniform. This was an English language adaption of Christa Winsloe‘s boarding school drama Mädchen in Uniform. McMahon is also credited with launching the stage career of Coral Browne, who had a leading role. In a minor role in the cast was a young Janet Johnson, who would also go on to a career in Britain in the 1930s.\n\nJoan impressed audiences in her role as school girl Ilse, providing some welcome comic relief in an otherwise intense play. Of Joan, Table Talk reported “here is a girl who is a born comedian…indeed at one time it almost looked as though she were going to run away with the play.” Aged just 22, she made the decision to try her luck in London in late 1933. She had achieved success quite quickly at home, and probably felt the time to go overseas seemed right. She departed Australia on the Swedish cargo ship MS Bullaren, in January 1934. With her was Joseph Dillon, stage name Joss Ambler, another member of the Gregan McMahon players, with whom she had apparently begun a relationship. The couple married in Wandsworth, a few months after arriving in England.\n\nJoss Ambler\n\nThe son of a publican and Melbourne City Councillor who had died suddenly in 1915, Joss Dillon was eleven years Joan’s senior. After an indifferent time at school and a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to join the wartime Australian Army whilst still underage, he became a partner in an agency for Norton motorcycles, becoming active in the sport in the 1920s. Somehow, he also discovered a passion for performing on stage, coming to the notice of Gregan McMahon at the same time as Joan.\n\nJoan’s “flair for puckish humour”\n\nThe newly married Joan Lang and Joss Ambler did not stay in London for long. By the end of 1934 they had moved to Scotland, joining the Brandon-Thomas Repertory Company. As well as performing in Scotland, during 1935 they also established their own drama school (the Modern Theatre Academy) in Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nThe Brandon-Thomas company’s repertoire generally included comedies and farces – including Harry Wagstaff Gribble’s March Hares (1935), W Somerset Maugham’s Home and Beauty (1935), James M Barrie’s The Admirable Crichton (1936) and Jevan Brandon-Thomas’s (1898-1977) own farce Passing Brompton Road (July 1935). Rep company plays were chosen according to likely audience appeal and, by the early 1930s, faced increasingly stiff competition from sound films. Thus plays would run for a few weeks before being replaced by something new – and hopefully equally as popular.\n\nAfter almost two years performing in Scotland, in September 1936 the couple returned to London, where Joss had an offer of some film work. In an article that noted Joan was “always most at home playing little girl and maid parts,” the Scotsman newspaper also inadvertently highlighted a problem for actresses of the time – there were fewer roles of substance for women. Fifteen years later, Dorothy Alison would tell a similar story – the narrow range of work for actresses, despite initial successes and no lack of ability.\n\nAn Australian newspaper report of 1936 described Joan’s well established “flair for puckish comedy”, while Joss was “tall, solid, with features magnificently adapted to character work.” But despite her ability, Joan did not find roles in films – or perhaps she just preferred the stage. Joss appeared in his first films in 1937.\n\nReviews of Joan Lang’s stage performances from the late 1930s give some idea of her prowess. While generally a supporting player, she was often picked out for positive comment by the press. When she appeared in Noël Coward’s cycle of short plays Tonight at 8:30 at the Kings Theatre in mid 1939, The Stage reported “Joan Lang deserves the reception accorded her for a delightful study of (a) snivelling child.” A few months later, in Coward’s Private Lives at Edinburgh’s Empire theatre, The Scotsman reported that she gave “one of the best performances of the evening.” Over the next few years she shared the stage with well established British actors – the likes of Vivien Leigh, Leo Genn, Torin Thatcher, Cyril Cusack, Gwynne Whitby, Leslie Banks and a very young Claire Bloom. She performed in plays directed by Muriel Pratt (the first wife of producer William Bridges-Adams), including Daleby Deep, Murder by Suggestion and But for the Grace. In May 1939, she was back in another Jevan Brandon-Thomas production, The Return of Peter Grimm, at the King’s Theatre.\n\nIn January 1949 Joan Lang appeared on the radio program Dick Bentley Speaks. Bentley, an Australian musician and comedian who had been in England in the 1930s and returned in 1947, recorded interviews with many of the Australians working in England, in a radio series running in 1948-1950. Joan told him of her work (presumably with ENSA) arranging concerts for ex-POWs. She also sent messages to some of the Australian servicemen she had met. Sadly, the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Archives department has assured this writer that Bentley’s radio series no longer exists – our knowledge of what Joan and others had to say is derived entirely from newspaper reports.\n\nJoan gained some further publicity in 1949, when The Sketch ran a series of photos and stories about Alan Melville’s new comedy Top Secret. It opened first in Liverpool, before starting a season in London. The reviews were mixed, but even those who found fault with the play had to acknowledge Joan’s success as Miss Fish, the inefficient secretary whose incompetence threatens the interests of the British Embassy, in an imaginary South American country. It was a story of its time of course, more relevant in an era when Britain was divesting itself of its Empire.\n\nSometime in the late 1940s, Joan and Joss’s marriage came to an end. In June 1952 Joan married a US air force Lieutenant-Colonel, Almon A Tucker, who was based in England at the time. Soon after marrying, the couple relocated to the US, and at about this time, Joan left the stage. She lived the rest of her long life in the United States, and died there in January 2003, aged 92.\n\nJoss Ambler’s later career\n\nThe IMDB lists almost 80 appearances on screen by Joss Ambler between 1937 and his death. He had some standout roles – for example in the two George Formby films of 1939 – Trouble Brewing and Come on George! and a third in 1942. However it has been noted that his roles were often as noisy drunks, stuffy authority figures or vaguely humorous members of the British upper classes – complete with trademark walrus moustache and old fashioned spectacles. Even as early as 1940, he indicated he had tired of some of these roles. Typecasting in film could be frustrating, which may explain why he also continued to appear on stage when he could – his last performance in London being in Thirteen for Dinner, at the Duke of York’s Theatre, in December 1953. He had remarried by this time, but he died of cancer in London on 19 September 1959, aged only 59. .\n\nJoss’s sister Frances Dillon acted on stage in Australia, sometimes using the stage name Josephine Ambler.\n\nNote 1: All those stories about Joan’s family…\n\nAt a time when so many performers embellished their profile and fibbed about their ages, it is noteworthy that the stories attributed to Joan Lang and her family are true. Andrew Lang (1844-1912), the famous Scottish writer, poet and collector of fairy tales, really was her paternal grand uncle – from the part of the family that never left Scotland. Her maternal grandfather, Henry “Bull” Hopkins, an experienced Queensland drover, died of thirst on an ill-fated stock-drive near the Rankin River in the searing summer of December 1901. . Her own father, Andrew Lang, a former World War One pilot with the Australian Flying Corps and later the Royal Flying Corps, died in a car crash in 1924 while trying to set an Australian motoring record. A relative in Victoria’s Western District, the well known pastoralist John Lang Currie, then took a role in her care while she attended Geelong’s Hermitage School from 1926-1929.\n\nReferences\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nSophie Church, School Historian, Geelong Grammar School\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University\n\nAnne Rees (2015) ‘Browne, Coral Edith (1913–1991)’accessed online 26 March 2022.\n\nAllan Ashbol (1986), ‘McMahon, Gregan (1874–1941)’ accessed online 26 March 2022.\n\nFrank Van Straten (2009) ‘Bentley, Charles Walter (Dick) (1907–1995)‘, accessed online 5 April 2022.\n\nText\n\nBrian McFarlane (2003) The Encyclopedia of British Film.

Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales .\n\nBorn Kathleen Margot Rhys-Jones, (Katie to the family), in South Yarra, Melbourne, in 1914 to Philip, variously described as a manager or engineer and Nellie nee Hussey. Katie Rhys-Jones attended St Catherine’s Girl’s School in Toorak, Melbourne, at the same time as Janet Johnson and Gwen Munro, who also went on to acting careers. While still aged in her teens, Katie gained some publicity for appearing in charity fundraising performances. The photograph at left shows 17 year old Katie while performing in the play Prunella, for Melbourne’s Queen Victoria Hospital.\n\nIn Late 1931, after completing school, she moved to Sydney to attend Miss Jean Cheriton’s Doone finishing school – thus becoming a contemporary of Margaret Vyner. At Doone, languages, dance, music, elocution and performance arts were all part of the curriculum, alongside tennis and fencing, in what Cheriton liked to characterise as a “leisurely” learning environment, for young women who were ready to take their places in society.\n\nFor much of 1933, Katie modelled, performed in radio dramas and on stage with the Sydney Repertory Company. But her big breakthrough came in August 1933, when she gained a role in a play with visiting German actor-director Theo Shall, when she also adopted the stage name Margot Rhys.\n\nTheo Shall, had arrived in Australia in July 1932 at the invitation of JC Williamsons, the theatre company so dominant in Australia it was commonly known as “the firm.” He spent almost two years (August 1932 – June 1934) bringing “continental” theatre to Australian cities, with mixed success. See Note 1 below regarding the Theo Shall tour.\n\nA translated version of Fair Exchange found an audience and some enthusiastic supporters when it opened in Melbourne in late August 1933. But not everyone liked it. Several newspaper reviewers found fault with the acting and felt it a poor choice of play. And Table Talk, usually so enthusiastic for new productions, thought 19 year old supporting actress Margot Rhys was too inexperienced. Shall followed this with the farce Baby Mine, with Margot Rhys again in a supporting role.\n\nWe are fortunate in that Katie, as up and coming actor Margot Rhys, left some public thoughts about the experience of working with Theo Shall. In September 1933 she commented: “He arouses and brings something out of you that has been lying dormant and of which you were scarcely aware. By his methods he awakens you to realisation of your possibilities. It is his thoroughness, and his patience, which so impresses you, and which is so wonderful.” It may well have been wonderful, but not long after this she left Shall’s company. In early March 1934, Margot was announced as taking the leading role of pioneer woman Jane Judd, in Charles Chauvel’s upcoming film Heritage. With her was 16 year old Peggy (later Mary) Maguire, another “find” of Chauvel’s.\n\nCharles Chauvel deserves his reputation as an Australian filmmaking pioneer, however most modern viewers will find Heritage heavy weather. Paul Byrnes at the NFSA suggests “even in 1935, Chauvel’s tendency to preach and berate, rather than dramatise, made the film seem like a tiresome lecture. It was not a success.“ In their account of the film, Film historians Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper report that shooting commenced in April 1934 and took almost six months – an extraordinary length of time for an Australian film of the era. However, with its themes of pioneer struggles and nation building, the film struck a chord with political leaders, and won first prize of £2,500 in the Commonwealth Government’s Film competition. And clearly Chauvel was happy with Margot as an actor, as he cast her again in his next film, Uncivilised.\n\nFilming of Uncivilised began in late 1935, with English actor Dennis Hoey brought out to play a leading role opposite Margaret. Mary Maguire had signed up to appear in National Production’s The Flying Doctor, so despite suggestions she would work for Chauvel again, she was not available.\n\nSadly, Uncivilised has aged even less successfully than Heritage. Paul Byrnes aptly describes it as an Australian version of a Hollywood Tarzan movie. This writer’s view is that Chauvel seems to have wheeled out almost every imaginable jungle film stereotype – including Mara, the white ruler of an indigenous tribe (Hoey); a shifty “half cast” in the best traditions of Tondelayo from White Cargo; drug smuggling; fabulous rubies; and a wicked Afghan. The best that can be said of it, is that it is “of its time.” Margot Rhys is competent in the leading role of Beatrice Lynn, an author, who goes, inexplicably, on her own, in search of Mara.\n\nThe film was completed by April 1936, and Hoey went home, after making the usual complements about the wonderful experience of filming-making in Australia, that seem to have become a established tradition for visiting actors even in the mid 1930s. The film gained some further fame when Australia’s chief censor banned it for export. The cuts required were scenes of Margot Rhys skinny-dipping and a scene from the final fight, where an Indigenous man is strangled.\n\nIn early April, as the film wrapped, another announcement was made. Margot Rhys, now aged 21, would soon marry Dalzell Mein, a grazier. Charles Chauvel said he hoped she would not retire as an actor, but she did. The couple honeymooned in Hawaii, and then returned to run “Toolang,” a large property near Coleraine, in Victoria’s western district. Three years later she was more than happy to describe herself “as a complete country bumpkin and proud of it.“ Of course, she was never a country bumpkin and her occasional return visits to Melbourne were still noted with interest in society pages of newspapers.\n\nIf Katie Mein ever regretted giving up her career, she never said so. A number of her contemporaries kept working after marriage – Mary Maguire and Margaret Vyner for example. But we cannot assume that the experience of working with Shall and Chauvel was such a thoroughly enjoyable one, it was preferable to life on the land. Perhaps it wasn’t.\n\nKatie Mein died of cancer in Adelaide in June 1996. She was survived by a daughter. To this writer’s knowledge, she was never interviewed or asked to record her experiences of her three years performing and being continually in the public eye.\n\nCharles Chauvel died in 1959. Arguably his best film was Jedda (1955), also his last, which showed that, twenty years later, he had moved on from his 1930s vision of Indigenous Australians as stock characters in films. The colour film concerned a love story between an Indigenous man and woman, and was a fitting finale to his long career.\n\nNote 1 – The Theo Shall tour of 1932-1934\n\nTheo Shall arrived in Australia with considerable fanfare – he had appeared on stage and screen in Germany, Britain, and had been in a US film with Greta Garbo. Despite his reputation, it was a somewhat tumultuous two years, with several plays cancelled and rescheduled and inconsistent reviews of his work. Shall’s Australian sojourn is worth an entire study of its own, but there are few references to him beyond contemporary newspapers. Writing in 1965 when some Australians could still recall meeting Shall, Eric Porter described him as “handsome but hysterical…” Porter also suggested that Shall was very difficult to work with – his “backstage tantrums outmatched Oscar Asche’s…“ Some evidence supporting this claim exists. In early 1933 Shall’s wife Maria Von Wyl took great umbridge and refused to perform because she was billed beside (rather than above) a young Australian actor called Coral Browne. .\n\nShall departed Australia in something of a hurry in June 1934, cancelling a scheduled performance in Adelaide. He went back to Britain to make films, and then eventually went on to Germany. He is famous today for the wrong reason – for roles in Nazi propaganda films, such as Titanic (1943). He died in East Berlin in 1955. Maria Von Wyl’s later fate remains unknown.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nMarch 2022\n\nFurther reading\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University\n\nMichael Shmith (2012) ‘Shmith, Louis Athol (1914–1990)‘ accessed online 10 March 2022.\n\nElsa Chauvel (1973) My life with Charles Chauvel.

Courtesy the Australian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne Australia.\n\nThe five second version\n\nWhen Melbourne-born Gwenda Wilson died in 1977, fans of the BBC radio series The Archers mourned the actor’s passing. For twenty years she had played Aunt Laura, a “crusty, bossy, but lonely widow,” a New Zealand interloper who had moved into the village of Ambridge, having inherited Ambridge Hall. One correspondent felt it would be difficult to find a replacement actor “who could exactly imitate (her) distinctive Antipodean whine and put such righteous indignation into the part.”\n\nIn addition to her role in The Archers, she appeared occasionally on the British stage, on TV and in a handful of British films. Before she left Australia in late 1948, she had enjoyed six busy years on the stage and in radio in Australia. She was aged only 55 at the time of her death.\n\nGwenda Olive Wilson was born in September 1921, in Melbourne, Australia, to Albert Wilson, a furniture manufacturer, and Elsie nee Field. She grew up in the inner eastern suburb of Kew, and attended nearby Methodist Ladies College, where she developed a passion for performance. She won a scholarship to study music at the University of Melbourne, (she later said that her father had dreams of her being a soprano) but it is clear that her passion from a young age was acting. While at the University she regularly featured in amateur performances, including with the University’s Tin Alley Players. She also studied with speech and drama teacher Maie Hoban, in company with Patricia Kennedy, Coral Browne and others.\n\nIn 1942, having saved £20, she moved to Sydney. After some radio performances she won a breakthrough role as Janie, in the new US play of the same name, which opened at the Minerva Theatre in 1943.\n\nJanie concerned a small town girl who hosts a party for US servicemen that gets out of control while her parents are absent – perhaps the idea was a novelty for Australian audiences at the time. On stage with Gwenda were well established Australian performers like Fifi Banvard, and new faces including Margo Lee and Betty McDowall. The play found an audience and it ran for two months – thus establishing Gwenda’s credentials, but it was generally dismissed by most as lightweight entertainment. One newspaper wrote that it was without “real character development, plot construction… (and had) the appeal…of a nice whopping chocolate soda.”\n\nIn October 1943, she took a leading role in Kiss and Tell, another play about modern youth from the US that had opened on Broadway only a few months before. It enjoyed a record 53 week run in Melbourne, and long runs in other Australian cities. 21 year old Gwenda gave a “finished and charming interpretation” as Corliss Archer. It was while working on this play that she was caught up in the 1944 “theatrical dispute,” between JC Williamsons, the Australian theatrical monopoly, and Actor’s Equity, over conditions and the use of non-union performers. Gwenda was one of the striking performers issued with a writ to prevent them appearing in an Equity fund-raising performance. The strike was resolved after three weeks and the principle of the “closed shop” for the Australian theatre firmly established – so Equity succeeded.\n\nIn January 1945, Gwenda married former serviceman and Tasmanian"
