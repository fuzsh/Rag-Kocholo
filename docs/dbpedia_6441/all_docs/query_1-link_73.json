[Lucile & Meredith].\n\nFor many years Burrows Brothers published a newsletter, The Burrows Brothers Breeze. In its December 24, 1921, issue (page 2004), Publishers' Weekly reprinted an article by George P. Fluck of the Juvenile Book Department:\n\nTime makes changes. The book business has been no exception. Many of the favorite books of early days are known to few present-day readers. The writing of Dickens, Scott, Thackeray, Bulwer, Cooper, Eliot, Hawthorne and a host of other survive and are appreciated. Outside fo the \"Sketch Book\" and \"Alhambra,\" Irving is little read. J. G. Holland, deservedly popular, is almost forgotten.\n\nSome \"big sellers\" of long ago were Tourgee's \"A Fool's Errand,\" and \"Bricks Without Straw,\" Beecher's \"Norwood,\" Spraugue's \"An Earnest Trifler,\" and Wallace's \"Ben Hur.\" The last named is still in good favor, the others forgotten.\n\nPopular fiction writers of the eighties were: Wilkie Collins, Charles Reade, Thomas Hardy, William Black, R. D. Blackmore, Marion Harland, Captain Marryat, E. P. Rose, Mrs. Alden (Pansy), Amelia Barr.\n\nOthers of less quality were: Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. Southward, Charlotte Braehm, Augusta Evans, Bertha Clay and many others.\n\nOutstanding writers of detective or mystery stories were Allen Pinkerton, Emile Gaboriau and Anna Katherine Green.\n\nOf the writers of humor, Mark Twain, Max Adeler, George W. Peck, Artemus Ward, Bill Nye, Josh Billings and Marietta Holdy stood out most prominently.\n\nThe writers who most thrilled our daddies when boys were Optic, Alger, Castleman, Trowbridge, Kellogg, Ellis, Hentry, Du Chailler and Stephens. \"The Boy Travelers,\" \"Zig Zag Journeys\" and \"Knock-About-Club\" books were popular but are now out of demand.\n\nThe girls and boys of the eighties, as those of today, enjoyed \"Little Women,\" \"Helen's Babies,\" \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\" \"Tom Brown's School Days,\" \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Hans Brinker.\"\n\nAlong religious lines, the sermons of Phillips Brooks, Talmadege, Spurgeon, Farrar and Moodie were in strong demand, also Taylor's \"Holy Living\" and \"Holy Dying.\" Young's \"Night Thoughts,\" Clark's \"Scripture Promises and Phantoms of the Past.\"\n\nThe most popular book for gift purposes was \"Lucille,\" followed by \"Lady of the Lake,\" \"Lalla Roohk,\" \"Lorna Doone,\" \"Geraldine\" and \"Cranford.\"\n\nDuring the late eighties, the large, flat, illustrated gift book had its sway. Some subjects were: \"The Raven,\" \"The Ancient Mariner,\" and \"The Inferno.\"\n\nThe standard poets sold more readily than now. Authors were more often sold in complete sets. Worcester's Dictionary was the preferred authority in 1880.\n\nSome paper covered series, now no long available, were The Seaside Library, Lakeside Library, Harper's Handy Volume Series, and Beadle's Dime Libary.\n\nGodey's Lady's Book and Peterson's The Lady's Friend were the leading fashion magazines. Their fine colored plates illustrating the prevailing styles are now most interesting curios.\n\nDuring the eighties, if five thousand copies were sold during the life of a book, it was considered a success and fifty thousand copies was most exceptional.\n\nAt the present time, the sale of two hundred and fifty thousand copies of a good, live novel is not considered unusual.\n\nThe 1899 Catalogue also offers several illustrations of the facade and interior of the Euclid Avenue store. These include the facade; main aisle; an interior view; the book department; the stationery department; and the vacuum tube system that moved messages from one department to another, cash and checks to a cashier, etc.\n\nLast revised: 18 March 2023"
