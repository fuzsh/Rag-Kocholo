        "text": "George Bancroft was raised in Philadelphia and attended high school at Tomes Institute (Philadelphia). He won an impressive appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and graduated as a commissioned officer. He served in the Navy for the prescribed period of required service but no more. He decided to turn to show business, first as a theater manager. He worked in the old and fading minstrel show variety format into the 1920s but then decided to try his hand at acting. By 1923, he was good enough for Broadway and spent about a year there doing two plays. But he was already good enough for some early camera work for by 1921, so he had made his first appearance in the silent movie medium. Being a big man with dark features, he was a natural for heavies. And it seemed that early Westerns were an easy fit as well after his first four films. Through 1924 and into 1925, he did four, culminating with pay dirt in his appealing performance as rogue Jack Slade in the James Cruze Western The Pony Express (1925). With him was another up-and-coming character actor, Wallace Beery. Bancroft's acting made Paramount Pictures take a look at him as star material. His roles as tough guy took on more flesh into the later 1920s, especially in association with director Josef von Sternberg and his well-honed gangster films that started with Unterwelt (1927). Their work culminated with Sternberg's Sie nannten ihn Thunderbolt (1929) for which Bancroft received an Oscar nomination. He was tops at the box office.\n\nBancroft's various on-screen personas as bigger-than-life strong man was not far from his off-screen character as Hollywood notability got to him. It was recalled that he became more difficult to deal with as his ego grew. At one point, he refused to obey a director's order that he fall down after being shot by the villain. Bancroft declared, \"One bullet can't kill Bancroft!\" Although he stayed busy through the 1930s, he was older and stouter -- the stuff of featured characters. And Bancroft was also getting a lot of competition from younger character actors. In the early '30s, his roles continued to typecast him as lead heavies, but increasingly, he was cast as second tier -- if with more variety -- in later roles. He was paper editor MacWade in Mr. Deeds geht in die Stadt (1936); a doctor in A Doctor's Diary (1937); a few sea captains along the way; and most memorably Marshal Curly Wilcox in the John Ford Western (his first with sound) Höllenfahrt nach Santa Fé (1939). Here he is particularly engaging tough lawman but with a big heart. Into the 1940s, he only did a handful of films. But he again had a rogue's spotlight with another name director -- Cecil B. DeMille -- in one of his always epic yarns. This time it was a Texas Ranger chasing a murderer over the Canadian border in Die scharlachroten Reiter (1940) with a stellar cast including Gary Cooper, everybody's favorite blond Madeleine Carroll, and Paulette Goddard as fleeing criminal, Jacques Corbeau's (Bancroft) daughter. By 1942, Bancroft had decided to move on, retiring with the intention of becoming a Southern California rancher. He quietly assumed this new role for a long run of 14 years before his passing.\n\nAmerican character actor of gruff voice and appearance who was a fixture in Hollywood pictures from the earliest days of the talkies. The fifth of seven children, he was born in the first minute of 1891. He was a boisterous child, and at nine was tried and acquitted for attempted murder in the shooting of a motorman who had run over his dog. He worked as a lumberjack and investment promoter, and briefly ran his own pest extermination business. In his late teens, he gave up the business and traveled aimlessly about country. In San Francisco, an attempt to romance a burlesque actress resulted in an offer to join her show as a performer. He spent the next dozen years touring the country in road companies, then made a smash hit on Broadway in \"Outside Looking In\". Cecil B. DeMille saw Bickford on the stage and offered him the lead in Dynamit (1929). Contracted to MGM, Bickford fought constantly with studio head Louis B. Mayer and was for a time blacklisted among the studios. He spent several years working in independent films as a freelancer, then was offered a contract at Twentieth Century Fox. Before the contract could take effect, however, Bickford was mauled by a lion while filming 'East of Java (1935)'. He recovered, but lost the Fox contract and his leading man status due to the extensive scarring of his neck and also to increasing age. He continued as a character actor, establishing himself as a character star in films like Das Lied von Bernadette (1943), for which he received the first of three Oscar nominations. Burly and brusque, he played heavies and father figures with equal skill. He continued to act in generally prestigious films up until his death in 1967.\n\nWhen it came to bright and polished, they didn't get much spiffier than singer/actress Janet Blair -- perhaps to her detriment in the long haul. At Columbia, she was usually overlooked for the roles that might have tested her dramatic mettle. Nevertheless, she pleased audiences as a pert and perky co-star to a number of bigger stars, ranging from George Raft and Cary Grant to Red Skelton and The Dorsey Brothers.\n\nOf Irish descent, she was born Martha Janet Lafferty in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 1921. Raised there in the public school system, she sang in the church choir during her youth and adolescence. The inspiration and talent were evident enough for her to pursue singing as a career by the time she graduated. At age 18, she was a lead vocalist with Hal Kemp's band at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles. While with Kemp's outfit, Janet met and, subsequently, married the band's pianist, Lou Busch, a respected musician, songwriter, and, later, ragtime recording artist.\n\nA Columbia Pictures talent scout caught her behind the microphone and spotted fine potential in the pretty-as-a-picture songstress. The death of Kemp in a car accident in December of 1940 and the band's eventual break-up signaled a life-changing course of events. She signed up with Columbia, for up to $100 a week, and moved to Los Angeles while her husband found work as a studio musician. Janet made an immediate impression in her debut film as the feisty kid sister of Joan Blondell and Binnie Barnes in Three Girls About Town (1941) and also dallied about in the movies, Two Yanks in Trinidad (1942) and Blondie Goes to College (1942), until her big break in the movies arrived. Star Rosalind Russell made a pitch for Janet to play her co-lead in Meine Schwester Ellen (1942) as her naive, starry-eyed younger sister (Eileen), who carried aspirations of being a big-time actress. The film became an instant hit and Janet abruptly moved up into the \"love interest\" ranks. Usually appearing in a frothy musical or light comedy, she was seeded second, however, to another redhead, Rita Hayworth, when it came to Columbia's dispensing out musical leads. Janet, nevertheless, continued promisingly paired up with George Raft in the mob-oriented tunefest, Broadway (1942); alongside Don Ameche in the musical, Something to Shout About (1943); and opposite Cary Grant in the comedy-fantasy, Pinky und Curly (1944), one of his lesser known films. She played second lead to Ms. Hayworth in Music Box Girls (1945) and was right in her element when asked to co-star with bandleaders Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey in their biopic, Die legendären Dorseys (1947). A rare dramatic role came her way in the Glenn Ford starrer, Gallant Journey (1946), but again she was relegated to playing the stereotyped altruistic wife. In retrospect, the importance of her roles, although performed quite capably, were more supportive and decorative in nature and lacked real bite. By the time the daring-do \"B\" swashbuckler Schwarze Pfeile (1948) rolled out, Columbia had lost interest in its fair maiden and Janet had lost interest in Hollywood.\n\nA new decade brought about a new career direction. Putting together a successful nightclub act, she was spotted by composer Richard Rodgers and made a sparkling name for herself within a short time. Rodgers & Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\", starring Mary Martin, was the hit of the Broadway season and Janet dutifully took on the lead role of \"Ensign Nellie Forbush\" when the show went on tour in 1950. She gave a yeoman performance -- over 1,200 in all -- within a three-year period. Following this success, she made her Broadway debut in the musical, \"A Girl Can Tell,\" in 1953. She went on for decades, appearing in such tuneful vehicles as \"Anything Goes,\" \"Bells Are Ringing,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Mame,\" and \"Follies.\"\n\nHer career, however, took second place after marrying second husband, producer/director Nick Mayo in 1953, and raising their two children, Amanda and Andrew. The couple met when he stage-managed \"South Pacific\" and went on to co-own and operate Valley Music Theatre in Woodland Hills, California, during the mid-1960s. There, she played \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Peter Pan\" opposite Vincent Price's \"Dr. Hook,\" among others. Her second marriage lasted until the late '60s. TV's \"Golden Age\" proved to be a viable medium for her. A promising series role came to her in 1956 when she replaced Emmy-winning Nanette Fabray as Sid Caesar's femme co-star on Caesar's Hour (1954) but she left the sketch-based comedy show after only one season because she felt stifled and underused. She also returned to films on occasion, appearing opposite her Dieser verrückte Mr. Johns! (1948) co-star, Red Skelton, in another of his slapstick vehicles, Rindvieh Nr. 1 (1957); as Tony Randall's wife in the domestic comedy, Sexy! (1962), starring Kim Novak; and in the excellent cult British horror, Hypno (1962) (aka Burn, Witch, Burn) and she was fresh as a daisy, once again, in the antiseptic Disney musical, The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968). After her second divorce, Janet laid off touring in musicals and settled in Hollywood to raise her two teenage children while looking for TV work. She found a steady paycheck paired up with Henry Fonda on the sitcom, The Smith Family (1971), playing another of her patented loyal wives. She also found scattered work on such TV shows as Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969), Die Zwei mit dem Dreh (1975), Fantasy Island (1977), and Love Boat (1977). Her last guest showing was on the Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984) episode, Who Killed J.B. Fletcher? (1991). Janet died at age 85 in Santa Monica, California, after developing pneumonia.\n\nOne of Hollywood's greatest screen villains, Charles Henry Pywell Daniell was born in London, England, the son of Elinor Mary (Wookey) and Henry Pyweh Daniell, L.R.C.P. He had the profound misfortune to make his professional theatrical debut on the eve of World War I. His life thus interrupted, he served in the trenches on the Western Front with the 2nd Battalion of the British Army's Norfolk Regiment. Wounded in action, he was invalided out of service in 1915 and spent much of the next few years on the West End stage without rising to particular prominence. In 1921, he made his way to the U.S. and worked hard to establish himself as a character player on Broadway, beginning with his role as Prince Charles de Vaucluse in \"Claire de Lune\". He enjoyed critical acclaim in only his third performance on the 'Great White Way', co-starring with Ethel Barrymore in \"The Second Mrs. Tanqueray\" (1924). For the remainder of the decade, Daniell alternated touring on both sides of the Atlantic, before making his first appearance on screen in 1929. Daniell's lean physique, sardonic, almost reptilian features, cold voice and incisive manner made him ideally cast as icy, austere aristocrats or as insidious, manipulating evil masterminds in period drama.\n\nHis most famous role was as the duplicitous Lord Wolfingham in Der Herr der sieben Meere (1940), though Daniell's inexperience as a swordsman compelled Warner Brothers to use a stuntman for the climactic fight scene with Errol Flynn. The previous year, Daniell had essayed the conspiratorial Sir Robert Cecil, spy master to Elizabeth I, with equal verve in Günstling einer Königin (1939). Under contract to MGM (1936-37), he also excelled as the erstwhile mentor of Greta Garbo's Die Kameliendame (1936), the Baron de Varville. Their vitriolic exchanges are a highlight of the film and belie the fact that Daniell was fretfully nervous acting opposite Garbo. His other, invariably unsympathetic, portrayals include the scheming La Motte in Marie-Antoinette (1938), the hypocritical clergyman Henry Brocklehurst in Die Waise von Lowood (1943) and the gleefully villainous Regent in Der Bandit und die Königin (1946). By the 1940's, Daniell popped up more and more in lower budget productions, yet managed to deliver two of his finest performances to date: the first, as Professor Moriarty, arch nemesis of Sherlock Holmes (played by his real-life friend Basil Rathbone) in Die Frau in Grün (1945); the second, as Dr. Wolfe MacFarlane, a 19th century Edinburgh surgeon employing the grave-robbing services of Boris Karloff in Der Leichendieb (1945), a Faustian parable in which any semblance of morality and virtue is sacrificed to the pursuit of scientific knowledge. In the end, Gray (Karloff), the instrument of MacFarlane's machinations becomes \"a canker in his body\", but even his killing cannot assuage the surgeon's guilty conscience and he is eventually hounded to death by visions of the latter's corpse. This was a rare leading role for Daniell whose scenes with Karloff are among the most chilling of any in this genre. For a change of pace -- or, perhaps, to change his image -- Daniell did the occasional comedic turn, most notably in Charles Chaplin's Third Reich parody Der große Diktator (1940), as 'Garbitsch', a none too thinly disguised caricature of Joseph Goebbels.\n\nOn stage, he enjoyed his most successful run (344 performances) as the avaricious Henri Trochard in \"My 3 Angels\" at the Morosco Theatre in 1953. The play was filmed two years later as Wir sind keine Engel (1955), with, who else, but Basil Rathbone, in the part.\n\nDaniell died after being stricken with a heart attack at his home, a few hours after filming a scene for his final film, My Fair Lady (1964).\n\nComposer, songwriter (\"April in Paris\", \"Autumn in New York\", \"I Can't Get Started\"), author and pianist, educated at the Kiev Conservatory (which he entered at age thirteen) and a music student of Reinhold Gliere and Marian Dombrovsky. He had composed ballets for Diaghilev's Ballet Russe, but he fled Russia after the revolution. He composed the London stage scoes for \"Yvonne\" and \"The Yellow Mask\" and, after coming to New York in 1929, the Broadway stage scores for \"Walk a Little Faster, \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (1934, 1936), \"Cabin in the Sky\", \"Banjo Eyes\", \"Sadie Thompson\", \"Two's Company\", \"It Happens on Ice\", \"The Littlest Revue\" (off-Broadway), the stage background score for \"Time Remembered\", and also \"Zenda\", in Los Angeles. He wrote songs for Broadway revues, including \"Garrick Gaieties\" (1930), \"Thumbs Up!\", and \"The Show Is On\", and he completed the score for \"The Goldwyn Follies\" after George Gershwin's death. During World War II, he was a Lieutenant Commander in the US Coast Guard which helped to inspire themes for his work on \"Tars and Spars\". He founded the Society for Forgotten Music, and served as its president. His autobiography is \"Listen Here!\". Joining ASCAP in 1934, his chief musical collaborators included E.Y. Harburg, Ira Gershwin, Ogden Nash, Howard Dietz, and John Latouche. His other popular-song compositions include \"I Am Only Human After All\", \"Too Too Divine\", \"That's Life\", \"Speaking of Love\", \"So Nonchalant\", \"Water Under the Bridge\", \"I Like the Likes of You\", \"Suddenly\", \"What Is There to Say?\", \"Island in the West Indies\", \"Words Without Music\", \"Now\", \"Taking a Chance on Love\", \"Do What You Wanna Do\", \"Love Turned the Light Out\", \"Honey in the Honeycomb\", \"Cabin in the Sky\", \"We're Having a Baby\", \"Not a Care in the World\", \"Summer Is A-Comin' In\", \"The Love I Long For\", \"The Sea-Gull and the Ea-Gull\", \"Spring Again\", \"Roundabout\", \"Out of the Clear Blue Sky\", \"Just Like a Man\", \"That's What Makes Paris Paree\", \"London in July\", \"Good Little Girls\", \"You're Far from Wonderful\", and \"Madly in Love\".\n\nFeuchtwanger graduated from high school in 1903. From 1903 he studied German, history and philosophy in Munich and Berlin. He moved in the Munich artistic scene and began his first literary attempts with theater reviews, stories and dramas. In 1907 he received his doctorate. phil. with a work on Heinrich Heine's \"Rabbi von Bacherach\". Because of the restrictions for Jews at German colleges and universities at the time, he dropped his habilitation plans. From 1907 he initially worked as a theater critic and dramaturge in Munich. In 1912 he married Marta Loeffler. In 1914 he went on a trip to Tunisia with his wife, during which he narrowly escaped internment by the French.\n\nLion Feuchtwanger became one of the first writers to express criticism of the exuberant patriotism of the Germans and against the war in plays during the First World War. His short military service ended with his discharge due to short-sightedness. In 1918 he experienced the revolution in Munich and worked on the dramatic novel \"Thomas Wendt\". In 1920 he met Bertold Brecht and Marieluise Fleißer there. A friendly relationship developed with Brecht, which led to them working together. Feuchtwanger realized several theater projects with him, incorporating influences from this collaboration into his epic theater. In 1924 the two of them worked on the play \"Life of Edward the Second of England\".\n\nIn 1913, Feuchtwanger's historical novel \"The Ugly Duchess Margarete Maultasch\" about ugliness and outsiderness was published. In 1925 he moved to Berlin and in 1927 his play \"The Petroleum Island\" was premiered. After the National Socialists came to power in 1933, Feuchtwanger was expatriated. His house in Berlin was searched, looted and confiscated, and manuscripts were also lost. At that time he was on a lecture tour in the USA. He went to Sanary-sur-Mer in the south of France and to Moscow in 1937, where he co-edited the exile magazine \"Das Wort\", which was published in Germany, from 1936 to 1939. From 1939 to 1940 he was housed in an internment camp in Aix-en-Provence, France.\n\nThrough the intervention of Eleanor Roosevelt, he was released and fled to the USA via Portugal. From 1941 he lived near Los Angeles. Due to his rapprochement with the communists and the persecution of socialists and communists under Joseph McCarthy, he was unable to become a citizen. Lion Feuchtwanger's literary focus is now on the historical novel. He did not see it as a representation or retracing of history, but wanted to use it to communicate generally valid truths, which he based on historical material and figures as well as on the conflicts highlighted. The first major success came in 1818 with the drama \"Jud Süß\". He then expanded it into a novel, published in 1925. But before that he had difficulty finding a publisher.\n\nFeuchtwanger's first contemporary historical novel, \"Success. Three Years of History of a Province\" (1930), not only tells the story of the rise of the Nazis in Bavaria, but also explains the socio-psychological prerequisites and the functioning of the interaction between politics, the judiciary, large industry and the crime of German citizens . \"Success\" became a highlight in Feuchtwanger's literary work. He later combined the contemporary historical novels \"Success\", \"The Oppenheim Siblings\" (1933) and \"Exile\" (1940) into the trilogy \"The Waiting Room\". The Josephus trilogy consisting of the works \"The Jewish War\" (1932), \"The Sons\" (1935), and \"The Day Will Come\" (1945) occupies a central position in Lion Feuchtwanger's oeuvre.\n\nThis is also about the fate of the Jewish people based on the writer Flavius Josephus in a non-Jewish environment. Feuchtwanger also reflects on his own literary work. In 1936 the satire on Hitler \"The False Nero\" was published. The novel \"Exile\", published in 1940, makes Feuchtwanger's approach to socialism clear. In the report \"Unholdes France\" (1942) he describes his experiences in the internment camp. In 1945 the collaboration with Bert Brecht was resumed with the play \"The Story of Simone Machard\". In 1948 he created the play \"Wahn or The Devil in Boston\" about the witch hunt in Massachusetts - the reason for this work was his experiences of the persecution of communists in the USA.\n\nWith the two works \"The Jewess of Toledo\" and \"Jefta and his Daughter\" Feuchtwanger turned back to the fate of the Jewish people. His other works include \"Peace, a Burlesque Game\" (1918), \"The Prisoners of War\" (1919), \"Three Anglo-Saxon Pieces\" (1927)\n\nPaul Fix, the well-known movie and TV character actor who played \"Marshal Micah Torrance\" on the TV series Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), was born Peter Paul Fix on March 13, 1901 in Dobbs Ferry, New York to brew-master Wilhelm Fix and his wife, the former Louise C. Walz. His mother and father were German immigrants who had left their Black Forest home and arrived in New York City in the 1870s. (The name \"Fix\" is of Latin/Germanic origin, and is derived from St. Vitus and means \"animated\" or \"vital\").\n\nBesides Peter Paul, the Fix family consisted of two girls and three boys, the youngest of whom was six years older than the future actor. Peter Paul's childhood was a happy one. He and his family lived on the 200-acre property on which the Manilla Anchor Brewery, where his father was brew-master, was situated. Such was the importance of the senior Fix to the brewery that when he died at the age of 62 on the eve of America's entry into the First World War (two years after his 54-year old wife had died), the brewery closed.\n\nThe orphaned Peter Paul, who kept to himself a lot and had a vivid imagination, was sent to live with his married sisters, first one who lived nearby in Yonkers, and then to another in Zanesville, Ohio. The just-turned-17-year-old Peter Paul Fix joined the U.S. Navy on March 12, 1918, and spent his state-side service time during World War I in Newport, Rhode Island and Charleston, South Carolina. He first tread the boards as an actor while a sailor stationed in Newport, when the baby-faced salt (who looked much younger than his age) was one of six gobs chosen to play female roles in the Navy Relief Show \"HMS Pinafore\". The Navy staging of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta was a big hit and chalked up a run of several weeks in Providence and Boston.\n\nFix was assigned as an able-bodied seaman to the troopship U.S.S. Mount Vernon, which was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of France but did not sink as it was run aground. The rest of Fix's naval career was less exciting, and he was demobilized on September 5, 1919. After his discharge, Fix went back to his girlfriend Frances (Taddy) Harvey, whom he had left behind in Zanesville. He and Taddy were married in 1922 and they moved to California as Fix had always wanted to live in a warm climate.\n\nFix and his bride settled in Hollywood, not so much because he had set ideas about becoming an actor but because he didn't know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. He liked writing and acting in local plays, and soon became friends with the fellow tyro actor Clark Gable, who was his own age. Fix and Gable were discovered by the stage actress Pauline Frederick, who hired them to be members of her touring troupe that traveled by train the length of the West Coast putting on plays. In all, Fix - who had informally renamed himself Paul Peter - appeared in 20 plays with Gable.\n\nPaul Fix had one of his earliest acting roles on celluloid in the mid-1920s, appearing in a silent Western starring William S. Hart. The Western genre eventually would become the one he was most identified with. He played uncredited bit parts and small roles in silents before getting his first credited role in an early talkie (which was part-silent and part-talking), The First Kiss (1928), which starred future Hollywood superstar Gary Cooper and the dame that drove King Kong ape, Fay Wray. In all, Fix appeared in 300-400 films. The Western programmers of the silent and early talkie days could be shot in less than a week.\n\nIn 1925, Taddy gave birth to their daughter Marilyn Carey, who eventually would marry Harry Carey Jr., the son of one of the first great Western superstars. They would have three more children and become part of the extended family gathered around the director John Ford. In his career, Paul Fix would appear with another Western legend, John Wayne, in 26 films, starting in 1931 with Three Girls Lost (1931). Urged on by Loretta Young, Fix became an acting coach for the young actor, and Wayne later paid him back when he became a star by having Fix appear in his movies. (The Duke also was a part of the close-knit group that collected around John Ford). With the Duke's patronage, the kinds of roles that Fix played changed. He had been typed as villains in the 1930s but, in the 40s, he began assaying a better class of character.\n\nPaul Fix was also a screenwriter, and is credited as the writer on three films: Der Fremde aus Arizona (1944), Gala-Premiere (1954) and The Notorious Mr. Monks (1958). His favorites parts included playing the stricken passenger in the John Wayne picture Es wird immer wieder Tag (1954), Elizabeth Taylor's father in George Stevens' classic Giganten (1956), the grandfather of the eponymous Böse Saat (1956) and the judge in Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). His last screen appearance was in the Brooke Shields movie Wanda Nevada (1979), but he is most famous for appearing in the recurring role of \"Marshal Micah Torrance\" in the popular Western TV series Westlich von Santa Fe (1958). As of 1981, the 80-year old Fix was still getting mail from all over the world from \"Rifleman\" fans.\n\nPaul Fix died October 14, 1983 of kidney failure. He was survived by his daughter Marilyn Carey and son-in-law Harry \"Dobe\" Carey, three grandchildren and several great-grandchildren."
