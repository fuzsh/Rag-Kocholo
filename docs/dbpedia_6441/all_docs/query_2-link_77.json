Therefore, the early history of the library comes from the local newspaper – The Franklin County Citizen, which was later renamed The Preston Citizen. It should also be noted that in the early years, the library was run by a stake committee from the Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nEDITORIAL PAGE\n\nFranklin County Citizen, February 25, 1915, page 4\n\nCome you gentlemen of the free library commission, when are you going to commence operations?

The building will be commenced in the very near future and Is to be completed about July 1st. We are certainly glad that these two gentlemen have received the contract for this beautiful building, because we know that it is in safe hands and that the work that will be put on the structure will bring out the best in the gentlemen named.\n\nNEWS OF HERE AND HEREABOUT\n\nPreparatory work, Architects and Contractors\n\nFranklin County Citizen, April 1, 1915, p. 10\n\nTrees have been hewn down preparatory to the excavation work for Ihe new library building on the north side of the square. The library will be a handsome structure when completed, having a large lecture room in the basement, besides boiler rooms and other compartments, while the upstairs will be used as library and reading room.

It is built of dark red brick and is a splendid bit of architecture. It will open for the use of the public as soon as the building is accepted by the architect.\n\nNEWS FROM FAR AND NEAR\n\nFranklin County Citizen, October 5, 1916, p.8\n\nWhen will the new Library open?

A public library belongs entirely to the public and should not be run in connection with similar organizations of an exclusive nature.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFranklin County Citizen, December 7, 1916\n\nA library committee has been appointed in the city council consisting of the following gentlemen:\n\nJohn Johnson, chairman; V. W. Fairbanks, A. C. Smith, H. R. Merrill, Jesse Rich, J. W. Condie, Mrs. Louis Ballif, Mrs. Junius C. Jensen, and Mrs. J. W. Olsen.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFranklin County Citizen, January 18, 1917, p. 8\n\nBook collectors are around with their smiles and blandishments—however in a good cause—seeking to build up the insides of the new library. By the way, have you any books that you care to give to a good cause? Mrs. Floe Hale and Mr. Eugene Jensen and players will present a play in the near future for the benefit of the Carnegie Public Library. The name of the piece is “Tennessee's Partner.\"\n\nLIBRARY WILL OPEN ON MARCH FIRST\n\nFranklin County Citizen, February 15, 1917, page 1\n\nThe library committee met the other night and decided that the new Carnegie Library should be opened on the first day of March. They passed a resolution commending to the city board that a librarian be appointed at once and asked to go to Logan and Salt Lake to learn of library ways and the method of handling books. A committee was also appointed to select and buy the library furniture in order that everything might be in readiness for the opening.\n\nThe committee bought an excellent library from Dr. Bland the other day. This with what books they will be able to get from the people and will be able to purchase will make a big enough collection to begin with. Quite a number of the very best American magazines for old and young, have been ordered , and should be here sometime this week.\n\nOne of the main features of the circulation of books is what is known as the “Ten Cent Collection.” A collection of the best and latest fiction, as in other libraries, is to be arranged. This is composed of the latest and the best books of fiction and a nominal fee of ten cents is charged for the withdrawal of books in this collection. After the books have been read a number of times, they are put on the “free shelf”\n\nand the money obtained from the reading of these books is used to buy the latest works on fiction in circulation as published.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFund Raiser for Library\n\nFranklin County Citizen, February 15, 1917, page 8\n\nOne of the most delightful dancing socials of the season was given by the Golden Hour Club at the Blue Villa Hall on February 5th. The husbands of the members and many friends enjoyed the jolly party. Sandwiches and coffee were served. The club’s colors of white and yellow was carried out in the luncheon service. The proceeds of the party will be used by the ladies for the benefit of the public library.\n\nLIBRARY TO OPEN MARCH IOTH\n\nFranklin County Citizen, March 1, 1917\n\nAt a meeting of the library committee last Tuesday night, it was decided that the Carnegie Library would be opened March 10th. It was hoped by the committee that the opening might take place earlier but owing to some work that had to be done, the formal opening could not take place until the tenth. A reception committee is hard at work arranging for the opening. It is hoped that all of the patrons of the library will be present. The hours will be from one until five in the afternoon, and from seven until nine in the evening. During those hours punch and wafers will be served free of charge. It was thought at first that a book shower would be held but the plans were changed later. The committee of men of the different wards are now expected to gather the available books and take them to the library before the opening. Mrs. Ella Stewart has been selected as librarian. She is preparing herself to take charge of the library. The very latest methods will be used.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFranklin County Citizen, March 8, 1917, p. 8\n\nThe library committee hereby acknowledges the receipt of a magnificent gift of books, consisting of a 60 volume set of “The Nations of the World,\" by the Preston Furniture Company. The two young men Ephraim and Brigham Bosworth comprising the firm are both magnanimous and progressive and are sure to attract favorable attention by their up-to-date methods of doing business. When asked to\n\ncontribute to the library they did not hesitate to outdo almost every other donor. They left it to the choice of the committee to take a splendid number of books, or to choose several pieces of furniture. Here is a worthy example for others to emulate. Success to the boys.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFranklin County Citizen, March 22, 1917, p. 8\n\nLast week the name of Mrs. A. C. Smith was omitted from the names of the library committee. We are informed that she was one of the most ardent workers, and she placed her household furniture in the library building to take care of the public. Whether we are to blame for this oversight or not, we apologize to the good lady.\n\nThe library is pretty well patronized, the little ones seem to like to go there. And speaking of the little ones, books suitable for their study should be purchased. The books that are already there are a little too advanced for their youthful minds, and juvenile stories are the ones which are now so much needed in the library.\n\nMr. H. J. Hansen of the Hansen Jewelry Company, made the library a present of senator Henry Cabot Lodge’s “Harvard Classics.” This is a magnificent set of 56 volumes and Mr. Hansen is to be complimented for his generous donation.\n\nLOCAL BREVITIES\n\nFranklin County Citizen, March 29, 1917, p. 12\n\nThe library is being well used. Supplies have not yet arrived, therefore it is impossible as yet to lend the books, but the magazines are all in use. Books may be read during library hours.\n\n[The meeting room in the basement was used on a regular basis by the Amalgamated Sugar Co, meeting about the building of the sugar factory; the Golden Hour Ladies Club, and for Red Cross work.]\n\nF. O. HALES MAKES GIFT TO LIBRARY\n\nFranklin County Citizen, May 10, 1917, p. 8\n\nMr. F. O. Hales made a splendid gift of a number of volumes of fiction to the public library. His assortment was made up of Kippling, London, and a number of miscellaneous works. Mr. Hale’s gift will be especially appreciated by the young people as the books which he presented will be popular with the reading public Related item, p. 7: [This] last week a consignment of new books from A. C. McClurg and Company was received at the Carnegie Library. Many of them are reference books and represent the best there is on their particular subjects. Several books of short stories and fiction have also been added.\n\nYOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\nFranklin County Citizen, June 7, 1917, p. 10\n\nThe library is now open to the public, and is ready to loan books; hours from 1 p.m. to7 p.m. All books on the shelves are free and may be kept out for two weeks and if you cannot read them in that time, you may have them rechecked for two additional weeks. A fine of 5 cents a day is charged on books kept out overtime. We do not loan our dictionaries and encyclopedias. We also have twenty-five books of the latest fiction which may be read for 10c per week, until they are paid for, when they will be put on the free shelves. Following is the report for the month of May 1917:\n\nVolumes on hand, June 1st….. 1,434\n\nMembership, June-lst….. 306\n\nBooks loaned for month of May….. 582\n\nFines collected on overdue books….. $1.10\n\nELLA STUART, Librarian\n\nNEW FLAG ON LIBRARY\n\nFranklin County Citizen, August 30, 1917\n\nA new Old Glory was seen over the Carnegie Library and on ascertaining we found that our enterprising townsman, W. R. Smith, of the City Grocery had donated the shimmering stars and bars which constituted the flag of our country.

G. Peterson, jeweler Mr. N. G. Peterson, the wide awake and popular jeweler of Preston,\n\nhas recently presented the Carnegie Library with a beautiful large regulator clock. It is a magnificent\n\npiece of time mechanism and Mr. Peterson deserves credit and praise for his liberal contribution, and in\n\nbehalf of the Preston public, the Library Committee extends their sincere thanks and wish the jeweler a\n\nprosperous and happy business career. THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE\n\nANDREW CARNEGIE\n\nFranklin County Citizen, October 30, 1918, page 4\n\nRecently there passed from this sphere of action—a whole-souled sympathetic gentleman.\n\nThat man was Andrew Carnegie, steel king, philanthropist, and education savior of many who could\n\nnot have secured an education in any other way than the one he sponsored. Through his vast system\n\nof public libraries, many a man and woman, many a boy and girl, has received educational enlightenment.\n\nCarnegie saw the needs of the people. He wanted to help them. He sensed the ignorance of many\n\ncivic boards who thought all a man or woman needed was “jest readin’ writin’ and ‘rithmetic.”\n\nAs a result of his philanthropy, Preston received one of these monuments of Carnegie’s generosity.\n\nWithout a lot of red tape, humming or hawing, he donated to this city the magnificent monument in brick\n\nand stone that will ever keep his name in the hearts of the people.\n\nIt is the right kind of avenue of advancement that the average individual will assuredly take advantage\n\nof. Filled with good books it is a source of perpetual enjoyment to the young; education to the middle aged,\n\nand pleasure to the old.\n\nWere all men of the same mind as Andrew Carnegie, the world would be a better place to live in.\n\nThe people of Preston, when they view the beautiful symmetry of the building, it's ideal\n\nlocation—surrounded by green swards, shrubbery and fountains— it will be to revere the name of the founder and boast of his fatherly kindness and extensive generosities.\n\nA PLAN FOR INTERESTING CHILDREN IN READING\n\nFranklin County Citizen, December 11, 1918, page 9\n\nAt a recent meeting of the library committee, it was decided to inaugurate a Saturday afternoon story telling hour for the children of Preston. Mr. Harrison Merrill visited the department of the Salt Lake Library that has been following the plan, and Mrs. Curtis Bland visited the same department of the Logan Library, where each received enthusiastic promises of support in the direction of interest and suggestion.\n\nThe plan is for a storytelling lady to entertain children, from the ages of 4 years to 12 and older, at the library. If the plan meets with success, it may be followed in the summer vacation also, and on other days than Saturdays. A kindergarten play hour would be a happy summer arrangement in this connection.\n\nThe story hour will be at 2 o’clock on Saturday afternoons closing promptly at 3:00 so that the children who wish may go to the movies. Our first story hour will be Saturday, January 24th. All children are welcome.\n\n​​THE STORY TELLING LADY\n\n[During 1918, the meeting room in the Carnegie Library was used by the Mother’s Association, the Commercial Club, the Sugar Beet Committee, the Chatauqua Club, the Preston Athletic Club, and the Soldiers, Sailors and Marines.]\n\nBOOKS STILL WANTED FOR THE SOLDIERS\n\nFranklin County Citizen, January 16, 1919, page 1\n\nThe following word has been received from the state librarian: “We received a wire a short time ago from Washington urging us to collect more books of fiction for the soldiers AT ONCE. There is pressing need for books of fiction for our soldiers in the hospitals.”\n\nAnyone wishing to give books should bring them in to the Preston Carnegie Library before January 22, 1919.\n\nThe authors which seem to be most popular are: Jack London, McCutcheon, Marold Bell Wright, Boothe Tarkington, Mark Twain, Poe, Kipling, Chambers, Conan Doyle.\n\nELLA STUART, Librarian\n\nLOCAL NEWS\n\nFranklin County Citizen, June 12, 1919, page 8\n\nIt is said that the lawn in front of the Carnegie Library is certainly beginning to look green under the expert hands of Watermaster Hawkes.\n\n[Organizations using the library meeting room in 1919 were the newly formed American Legion Post, the War Mothers, the Chautauqua Association, the Athletic Club and the Commercial Club.]\n\n[1] Preston City Council Minutes, Book 3, 1915-1935\n\n​\n\nBook Reviews\n\nFor a short time, the Friends of the Library sponsored book reviews which were broadcast over the local radio station KPST. Reviewers and the book reviewed as listed in the newspaper were Marilyn Hull, Advise and Consent by Allen Drury, Marilyn Nash Hull, The Spinster by Sylvia Ashton Warner; and Virginia Burton, Nautilus 90 North by Commander William R. Anderson with Clay Blair, Jr.\n\n1961 - Martha Geddes explained the teenager’s book reviews: “Mrs. Margaret Edwards was assigned the task of evaluating teen book reviewers by the American Book Publishers Council. It seemed a rather hopeless task until she remembered that Enoch Pratt’s library had decided to publish “You’re the Critic”. All of the reviews were to be written by teenagers for teenagers and teens will not read book reviews that are written for adults by adults, and newspapers cannot be expected to provide such reviews. The editorial staff for the Critic is composed of one student of each of the Baltimore High Schools. The reviews are written and collected by teenagers. Mrs. Edwards reported, “Our local experience has suggested that there may be an idea here for a book column by and for teenagers in adult reviewing media.” Adults would read such reviews because they like to see what is going on in the minds of these puzzling younger people. Teenagers will read them because they are interested in teenage opinion and in this way will be led to read adult reviews for the purpose of comparison.\n\n“The 1960 Ten Best adult books selected by teenagers were: The Leopard, by de Lampedusa; Dooley books; Times Three by McGinley, Born Free by Adamson; The Lovely Ambition by Chase, Exodus, by Uris; Journey into Summer by Teale; Ben Hur by Wallace; and The Diary of Ann Frank.”\n\n“From the Boston Public Library comes these results of an election in which 2,220 readers age 14 to 21 named the books they wish all their friends would read.: Exodus, Ben Hur, Gone with the Wind, The Diary of Anne Frank, and Jane Eyre.\n\n“The books I enjoyed but older people might not: Seventeenth Summer, Double Date, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Fifteen, and Twixt Twelve and Twenty.\n\n“Books I’m sorry I read: Peyton Place and books of this type. “\n\nBudget\n\n1961\n\nLibrarian 2160.00\n\nJanitor 1164.00\n\nStudent Help 720.00\n\nLights and head 900.00\n\nTelephone 129.00\n\nBuilding Up-Keep 300.00\n\nSupplies 300.00\n\nBooks 1000.00\n\nPeriodicals 375.00[34]\n\n1963 Tax Receipts $6,000\n\nEstimated fees, county patrons, fines, gifts and rentals $1,700 for a total of $7,700 income\n\nExpenses:\n\nLibrarian’s Salary $2,460\n\nAssistants’ Salaries 800\n\nTelephone, lights and heat 640\n\nOperating supplies and expenses 950\n\nPeriodicals 350\n\nBuilding Maintenance $1,000\n\nBooks $1,500\n\nTotal $7,700\n\nMerlin Lewis, janitor terminated as of January 15, 1963. The City Council offered to furnish a parks employee with compensation for service to come from general fund during the winter months. The Rayona Club donated $8.00, and Alene Aller donated $1.25.\n\n1969\n\n10,007.04 budget assuming some of the cost of construction project [35]\n\nLibrary Board Meetings\n\n1961\n\nThe board discussed the basement remodeling project, the relationship of the library board to the city council, and J. Neff Boothe was voted temporary secretary-treasurer. Present were board members plus Harold Pinson, city councilman; Marian Ballif, county representative and state library board representative; and Henry Drennan, State Librarian.\n\nMr. Pinson consented to analyze the ground floor of the library to see what could be done to construct a children’s room and a community room. Mr. Weber consented to finish his plan of the upper floor of the library. Mr. Drennan was to receive a copy. The community room was to take care of meetings of groups such as Friends of the Library. Folding doors could divide the space from the Children’s Reading Room. Mrs. Ballif was to form a Friends of the Library group consisting of both county and city people. Mr. Drennan stated this tentative plan: Move all children’s books downstairs and renovate the downstairs for this purpose. Construct a work room upstairs and make repairs. Mr. Drennan suggested an L-shaped room. Construct or repair restrooms downstairs. Alterations to be paid for by state funds, $24,000 to $25,000 including $1800 for lost rent. Mr. Drennan suggested getting local people involved in contributing labor, funds and services for library improvement. Harold Pinson was to consult with the city attorney on drawing up a contract involving the transfer of the library from the city to the county. Mr. Drennan asked for investigation of a retired school bus for use as a bookmobile. Bookmobile would return to the state in case of election failure. Oneida County might be included in the use of the bookmobile.\n\nMr. Drennan met the previous day with representatives of church officials, PTA, and citizens to look at a trial run of the state bookmobile. He covered the following points about changes being made:\n\n1.The reason for remodeling the present library building is because of its age and for greater service.\n\n2. Library use is 40% by city patrons, and 60% by county residents.\n\n3. The financial backing is almost entirely supplied by the city.\n\n4. The bookmobile traveling library program as it is used in the state of Idaho at present.\n\n5. The state and federal government program to advance funds for a trial operation of the bookmobile, the remodeling of the building, and possible film service.\n\nMr. Drennen reported that the reaction of this group was very favorable toward the program with only one member present objecting to the use of federal funds for it. He informed us that a library should provide at least two books per person and allow a replacement of one book per person per year, making 800 books per year or approximately a cost of $2400. Chairman Greaves appointed members Condie and Boothe to get the Friends of the Library organized in town so that they would be ready to help on the program. Mr. Drennen said he would send Mrs. Rachel Tenski of the state library board to give assistance in the organization of the children’s library.[36]\n\nFriends of Library group made up of people from town clubs: Literary Club, Lavinia Cutler; Fine Arts Club, Roma Hawkes; Pickwick, Donna Webb; Study Club, Mattie Sharp; Art Lore, Muriel Johnson; Study Group, Belva Hart; AAU, Susie Buxton; Jaycees, Dorothy Johnson; American Legion Auxiliary,\n\nHelen Palmer; Lady Elks, Claire Auger; Farm Bureau, Norene Bingham and Elsie Bastian. Paul Woodward as representative from Franklin.\n\nDiscussion on heating underneath the front steps, termite problem in the basement, and book selection committee to work with Martha Gedees.\n\nCity employees to receive a $25 per month raise. Vote to do the same for librarian.[37]\n\nHenry Drennen in attendance. Discussion of county library district. Bookmobile would likely be available from Latah county as they needed a larger bus. Marion Ballif replaced by Elsie Bastian as county library chairman. Mrs. Bastian arranged for Mr. Drennen to speak to bishops, stake presidencies and several citizens about bookmobile service. Mr. Hendricks moved that a plumber estimate the expense of remodeling the toilet facilities. Estimates needed on floor coverings.[38]\n\nLIBRARY CHIT-CHAT\n\nThe Preston C0tizen, November 16, 1961\n\nHow about your public library? How much is enough? Does your library have enough books and other useful materials? Is your library well-housed? Is it well staffed? Is your library part of a library system? These are only a few questions you might ask yourself about your library. Our answer to all of these questions, if we were perfectly truthful, would be “No”.\n\nFirst, a library is built for service to the people in a designated section. It should be a vital part of our community. It should have everything people need for information, research and recreation—such as plenty of books, pamphlets, magazines, maps, music scores, films, recordings and microfilms. In other words, it should be an open door to knowledge and a fuller life, whether people live in the city or county.\n\nBut few communities by themselves can provide all that’s needed. So the new American Library Association’s Guide To Public Library Service keynotes the idea that every public library should be part of a coordinated system of libraries. This means simply that community libraries in a natural area should band together with a central library form or system of libraries but with each community retaining local control. This plan calls for a state program to guide and reinforce these systems.\n\nWe need to be a part of this system but many in our community refused to help us. They said it was national welfare and they wanted no part of it. Yet our school building, post office, hospital, county building, 4-H club work, our new roads, etc., have all been made possible by accepting and working in federal systems of activity. Even the library building was built by using Mr. Carnegie’s library endowment funds.\n\nThe city has tried for many years to give to the whole county community library service. It has now reached the point that the city can no longer carry the burden nor meet the financial needs of the library. In any free society each person must assume part of everything he gets free. The city has taxed its people to the very limit of the law. The law states that a city can tax its people up to 3 mills. Even now this has not been enough to cover the total expenses. The library staff is the lowest paid in the state. The building is rather old and requires much more for upkeep.\n\nMr. Campbell tried very hard to consolidate the county both in the schools and the library. Unless the people want a county library the city will be forced to charge a yearly fee of from three to five dollars per capita per year. This would amount to much more pre family than one mill levy. The real tragedy would come when we would be forced to say who can use the library. This to small children?\n\n1962\n\nContributions were reported from the Junior High PTA for $100.00 and $24.00 from the Ladies Literary Club to be used for books. Carpentry work has been redone. Contract from the state library for the contribution was signed. Junior library chairs were promised from Wayne Evans, Franklin County Grain Growers, Republican committee, Harold Pinson, Lynn Fackrell, Richard Hendricks, Carol Condie and J. Neff Boothe. New janitor sought. The city is planning to lay black top between the curbing and the library wall. Silicon brick proofing and roof seal to be purchased from Lewis Davis. Mrs. Greaves suggested that books be checked out for one month with no renewal and that fines be paid in labor where they can’t be done in cash. Carol Condie asked for her release as a board member[39].\n\nMrs. Lee Sant replaced Carol Condie on the board. Merlin Lewis, janitor, was asked to get Mrs. Solley’s room ready. He will repaint the spots on the wall on extra time. Sufficient funds were had to purchase six more chairs, two round tables, and two oblong tables. County residents will pay $5.00 per year per family or 10 cents per book rental. Mr. Boothe to write the story on the remodeling program. Book drops to be installed upstairs and down. [40]\n\nLibrary out of funds to complete the children’s library and volunteer work was needed to complete it. Merl Klippert to be asked for Friday night. Bill Weber to care for the knocked-down lumber. Walt Ross to take unused lumber and beaverboard back to Anderson Lumber. Harold Pinson to ask city night- watchman to check on the library building regularly. Out-of-town rental program to start in January. Farm Bureau Auxiliary to be asked about supplying the drapery for the library.[41]\n\n1963\n\nCards for each family member discussed. Legal patrons include anyone living within city or paying city tax. Individuals outside the city may get a card for $3.00 for library membership per year.\n\nMiss Geddes suggested that she be released as librarian and proposed that she be given the Junior Library and that a new librarian be hired. She can go on Social Security. Board approved and will advertise for a new head librarian.\n\nSchools to be given free use of library, and it was decided to ask them to donate for replacements. Approved on a temporary basis.[42]\n\nLIBRARIAN RESIGNS AFTER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS SERVICE\n\n“The Preston Library Board Wednesday morning accepted the resignation of Miss Martha Geddes, librarian. Miss Geddes has been librarian at the Preston Carnegie Library for 25 years. William Weber, spokesman for the Board, expressed his regret at Miss Geddes leaving.\n\nMiss Geddes was instrumental in starting a youth section at the library which was climaxed this past year with the completion of the youth library in the basement.\n\nShe is a lifelong resident of Preston, attending Preston schools and graduating from college. She later filled an LDS mission and taught school.”[43]\n\nThe hours for the new Youth Library Section are 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and from 3:30 to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays. The hours of the general library (upstairs) are from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m. Monday thru Thursday, and from 2:30 to 8:00 on Friday and 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. The library charges for those outside the city of Preston are $5 per family or $1 per person and 10c per book.[44]\n\nProblems with school use came up. Schools to meet with library board to work out solution. Rhyl Swainston presented a form for reporting our finances to him. Problem of coal chute repair was discussed. Two candidates for librarian to work for two weeks with Miss Geddes or state help. Total revenue for 1962 was $8,642.43. Total expenses were $7561.98.[45]\n\nApplications for librarians were reviewed. Hours to be worked determined to be approximately 70 hours per week to be split between the two chosen. Wage is to be 90C per hour with paid holidays and vacation. Rate increase to be considered at the end of six months. Applicants: Camilla Norton, Ada Hansen and Dona Webb to be contacted and interviewed for the job. Miss Geddes termination date is to be February 15th.[46]\n\nRachel Penske, Assistant State Librarian was in attendance. She discussed her reactions to the enlarged library and the junior library downstairs. She reported that the selection was good, a credit to former librarian, Martha Geddes. Many books have been repaired and more need to be rebound or mended. The easy books are pretty well worn and many will need to be replaced. New personnel seem to be alert and willing, and will no doubt gain experience as they are new to this work. Schedules should be flexible for the good of the library and the workers’ outside interests. Open one morning each week. She recommended standardized procedures for the best utilization of time. Purchase books from standard buyer’s guides. New Method Book Binding Co in Jacksonville, Ill. charges about $1.07 per volume, and they are the firm the Idaho State Library is using for rebinding this year. Also Hunting and Cadman binderies. Wilson cards are recommended. Many helps are available from the Idaho State Library and should be utilized. She recommended that schools outside the taxing area pay a reasonable price for use of books.[47]\n\nLIBRARY EXAMPLE OF COMMUNITY COOPERATION\n\nThe object was to provide a pleasant and roomy area for a youth library to properly house the extensive collection of junior literature, accumulated over a span of many years by Miss Martha Geddes, librarian. This selection of material was housed in the west section of the main floor area, and more room was needed for ready reference and use without unduly crowding the entire floor.\n\nAfter a study of the basement area and drawing of tentative plans by an architect under direction of Miss Geddes, Glen Call, a contractor, was called on for advice, and recommended that the central partition be removed to make one large room which would adequately house the books and equipment of a youth library.\n\nThe Preston Jaycees, under the direction of Varlan Clark, Doug Campbell and Allen Dunn, removed the central partition. They also removed the partition in a storage room and hall to make a large magazine room. They then removed a large section in the old magazine room and cleared shelving to make way for a second rest room.\n\nDuane McKenzie and Sons, contractors, removed an extra door from the basement entrance hall and closed the opening. This work, likewise, was done as a contribution to the youth library project.\n\nHarold Pinson, City Councilman, replaced the wiring left with the removal of the central partition, and routed the conduit to cover the gap between the ceilings of the two former rooms.\n\nCarlson Brothers were engaged to prepare the walls of the two contained rooms for painting and patched plaster in rest rooms and halls as well.\n\nUnder the direction of Floyd Didericksen and J. Neff Booth, trustee, members of the Lions Club painted the ceilings, walls, and woodwork of the central room, the retained office rental space, and the entrance hall. Mr. Boothe and Carol Condie, a former trustee, made the color selection and type of new furniture as a committee of the board.\n\nMrs. Greaves, together with the custodian on extra time, removed the old paint from the floor with sander and paint remover, to prepare for floor covering.\n\nThe Preston Elks Lodge, under the direction of Burton C. Martin, Exalted Ruler, purchased and donated asphalt tile which was laid by Martin, Glen Call, Rulon Owen, Dean Brostrom, and Howard Johnson, members of the lodge.\n\nThe Preston Rotary Club, under the direction of O. D. Robinson, purchased and installed a toilet and a basin to provide a second rest room and partitioned a hall leading from the central hall to provide access.\n\nThe roughed-in connections were fortunately still in place from a former restroom used when the basement served as a city hall before the present city building was purchased. This saved considerably on plumbing costs.\n\nAt first it was determined that the old shelving from the stacks to be emptied upstairs were to be used wherever possible to save cost and this material was removed and partially prepared for use by the Preston Post of the American Legion , under the direction of Eddie Davis, and the local Carpenter’s Union, under direction of Alonzo Handy.\n\nLater, on reconsideration of walls involved, it was decided to re-shelve the entire room in adjustable pine shelving, which was installed by Meryl Klippert and son Bill, carpenters, each donating part of the labor as a contribution. The Carpenter’s Union gave a cash donation also, toward the completion of this project.\n\nNext it was time to start finishing the new shelving and J. Walter Ross, Richard Hendricks, and William Webber, trustees, sanded and finished the shelf frames. Mrs. Greaves, along with Preston city employees including Miss Geddes and Carol McEntire, Dave Jones, Sara Bambrough, and Ruby Eames Booth, applied finishing coats to the shelves. The old shelving was used in a modified form, on new, lower stacks upstairs, which added breadth to the room, and makes it possible to view the entire room from the librarian’s station\n\nIn the basement, door frames were removed, shelves installed, and painting of the restrooms and halls completed by Elvoid Monson. Old shelving was adapted to the new magazine room by Mr. Weber and the custodian. This room was also given a coat of paint at that time.\n\nMr. Hendricks spearheaded the drive for new furniture by asking for donations for library chairs which were donated by firms, organizations, and individuals to be announced later.\n\nLikewise the PTA organization, American Legion Auxiliary and literary groups made cash contributions which were used to purchase tables and other furnishings.\n\nA complete list of donors will be made public and a suitable recognition placed in tablet form in the library when it has its formal opening.\n\nLibrarian Martha Geddes, who has served as librarian for the past 25 years, asked to be retired from her duties, due to the increased responsibility of the entire operation, impairing her health.\n\nA new librarian has not been designated at this time, but three capable women are now sharing the work of the two libraries. They are Ada Hansen, Camilla Norton, and Donna Webb, working under the direction of Mrs. Greaves, who had library experience when working in Preston schools prior to her marriage. Mrs. Richard Fenske, Assistant State Librarian, came from Boise to initiate training of the new personnel, and to orient them in their duties.\n\nViewing the project as it nears completion, one cannot omit credit to the many years of service of Miss Geddes has given to the selection and care of the volumes and to her pages, Linda Nielson and Rhonda Hammond, for their painstaking efforts.\n\n“The good will evinced by so many contributions and generous friends has fully justified our hopes and efforts,” Miss Geddes said.”[48]\n\nA tour of the library was made and conditions noted by board members. Magazine rack needed. Writing for invoices on delinquent bills and having a check made of books received. Library to be closed for two weeks in July for inventory. Book-binding and weeding discussed. Book loaning to literary clubs discussed. Three copies of statements required from suppliers. Board will approve statements, send three copies to city treasurer. He will return one statement with voucher to supplier, keep one for his files, return one copy with voucher numbers to library, all invoices attached, then filed. Employee wages raised to $1.00 per hour. Librarian to supply information on amount of use of books in each school district so as to ascertain maintenance cost. Also length of time books are kept. Librarian also to set up and maintain a simplified filing system for business records.[49]\n\n​\n\nSTRAY BOOK DAYS HELD AT LIBRARY\n\n“Stray book days will be held at the Preston Carnegie Library, according to Helen Greaves, chairman of the library board. The days, something that is planned to encourage the returning of overdue books, are planned for Thursday through September 2.\n\nDuring these days, anyone who has a book or knows of someone who has a book from the library that is past due may return the book without a fine—no questions asked— Mrs. Greaves said.\n\nShe said the library is short many books on the inventory and most of those books are overdue--many of them long overdue. Included in the books are some special reference books.\n\nThe same thing was tried in another town and some 300 to 400 books were brought in that they didn’t know they had.\n\nThe “no questions” and “no fine” will permit patrons who have had books checked out for some time to drop them off without being embarrassed or paying a large fine.” [50]\n\nBill Weber resigns from the Library Board. Plans for trial run of bookmobile and district meeting to be held December 5 were discussed. Possible replacements for Mr. Weber discussed: Idella Larsen, Barbara Howells, Lorna Larsen, Maurine Burton and LaRae Johnson were names submitted to the mayor.[51]\n\n​1964\n\nBookmobile to begin circulation March 20 with stops at Dayton, Weston, Franklin, Whitney,\n\nPreston, Riverdale, Mink Creek, Clifton-Oxford, and Fairview. Three thousand books will be\n\navailable through this service. Plans for Library Week discussed. New typewriter needed and\n\nbids procured. Budget approved. At the end of the bookmobile demonstration, a county board\n\nwill need to be elected. Obligations – financial reports twice yearly with annual library report.\n\nBooks they buy for the library will stay here. All stamped books go back to the state. Equipment\n\nwill stay here. Plan to extend use of library books from state to six months’ time. 33% use library\n\nwhere a district or county Library District exists.[52]\n\nPlans for Book Week, bookmobile, high school English classes to her book reviews of outstanding modern books, open house at the library to be held Saturday. Mrs. Johnson to arrange for refreshments and Mr. Ross to handle publicity. Storm windows and caulking for the basement windows would cost $480.00.

This is an increase of $2.50 a year for those taking books out of the library who live outside the Preston City limits. Library officials said that Preston City residents are paying an average of $11 a year for the service through the city tax and it was felt that the outside users cost should be nearer to that figure. It was reported to the board that the remodeling in the basement of the library is about complete. A reading room is being developed with a folding door between the room and the children’s library.[59]\n\nA book was recently donated to the Preston Carnegie Library in memory of Mrs. Nettie Robinson.

These displays were made by the library staff assisted by Johnny Hart. Martha Geddes, librarian, talked to the boys and girls of the first and second grades Monday morning and to the junior high school students Tuesday. Wednesday she interviewed Mark Hart for his work as an author, his recent trip to the National Education Convention and on his new assignment to prepare books for the Air Force.\n\n1964\n\nJ. Neff Booth, Chairman of the Library Week Open House and a member of the library board, said that there will be library personnel on duty at the time of the open house to show the interested persons around and explain the workings of the library. He also stated that light refreshments will be served to those browsing on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe new homey atmosphere and the easy access of the reference materials have been accomplished by some minor changes in the stacks and re-cataloguing of materials, “and of course the extra room in the upstairs as well as the youth library has helped to make ours an outstanding asset to the community,” Mr. Boothe added. “We on your library board cordially invite you to inspect and to comment on your library this National Library Week and to use it every day of the year.”\n\nOne of the highlights of the open house to be held this Saturday at the Preston Library will be the bookmobile. It will be parked in front of the library from 3 to 5:30 p.m. People may register and check out books at this time. The regular run of the bookmobile is every third Wednesday thereafter. The next stop will be April 15 and then May 6, then every third Wednesday thereafter.\n\nThe Bookmobile contains some 3,000 volumes for all ages and every variety of books to meet everyone’s taste from beginning readers to all ages. Also on the book mobile unit are several sets of reference books.\n\nBill Gordon, library in Pocatello, said the bookmobile has finished its first full 3 weeks and he and Miss Marry Green, who runs the bookmobile, agree that the run was very successful, especially in Franklin County. They said that 2, 769 books were circulated, and 412 adults and 574 children checked out the books.\n\nMr. Gordon said that he would welcome any suggestions to improve the stops or selection of books. One of the big events of the week was a series of book reviews presented to the Preston High School English classes. The following book reviews were given so that each student heard at least two of them: “Hawaii” by Mrs. Gerte Webb, “My Darling Clementine” by Mrs. David Beckstead, “Travels with Charlie” by Mrs. Lyle Shipley, ”Rogers and Hammerstein,” by Mrs. John Manning; “No Time for Sergeants,” by Mrs. Mrs. Norman Howell, and “Ye Jeeps and Julips,” by Mrs. Harley Greaves.\n\nAt the 100th Birthday Party of the Library in 2015, Kristi Keller Westover submitted the following memories of going to the library when she was young.\n\nI don’t know how old I was when I got my first library card, because I don’t remember not having one. I loved the library. It seemed as if it wrapped comforting arms around me every time I walked through the door. I felt at home there and I thought I could find the answer to anything in the books that were just waiting for me to take them off the shelf and start reading. And I could read whatever I wanted, mystery, romance, historical novels. You name it; I read it. I read it. Each book was an adventure, just waiting for me.\n\nI even liked the return chute as a child. I’d put the book through the little opening and watch it slide down the slide onto the waiting table. I always wondered what would happen if the table got full and there wasn’t room for more. But the librarians took care of the books so I never found out!\n\nI remember going downstairs to find the books to take home and treasure as a child. Dr. Seuss, is the author I remember I looked for the most. Then as I got older The Secret Garden was a favorite. I discovered the Dr. Dolittle and Clara Barton books. There was a contest one summer to see who could read the most books. I won the contest in my age group and I was given a book as a prize. I remember graduating to the books upstairs. I discovered Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier and any book by pearl S. Buck.\n\nI loved looking at the old Preston citizens stored in big books. I think by the year, finding my birth announcement, it was fascinating to me to be able to go back and read about myself! I spent a lot of time sitting in the library looking at the old editions of the paper. And of course, the reference materials for research papers, read and take notes at the library, then go home and write the paper.\n\nThe books had a pocket on the inside cover of the book. Inside the pocket was a card. When a book was checked out, the librarian would stamp the due date on the card, then hand write your library card number. I memorized my number and if I couldn’t’ remember if I’d read a book by reading the title, I would look at the card to see if my number was there. It was a great way to keep track!\n\nThen I discovered the card system. If I wanted to find a specific book I would go to the cards and find where it was in the library. Eventually I learned how to find books without the system. If I knew the author I could find the book. The Preston Carnegie Library holds a special place in my heart, and I was sad to see it go.\n\n[34] Library Board Minutes, April 22, 1961 [35] The Preston Citizen, March 13, 1969, page 1 [36] Library Board Minutes, July, 1961.\n\n[37] Library Board Minutes, November 9, 1961 [38] Library Board Minutes, December 7, 1961 [39] Library Board Minutes, April, 1962\n\n[40] Library Board Minutes, August 6, 1962 [41] Library Board Minutes, November 15, 1962 [42] Library Board Minutes, January 9, 1963\n\n[43] The Preston Citizen, January 10, 1963, [44] The Preston Citizen, January 10, 1963, page 1 [45] Library Board Minutes, January 30, 1963\n\n[46] Library Board Minutes, February 1, 1963 [47] Library Board Minutes, February 17, 1963 [48] The Preston Citizen, April 4, 1963, p. 1\n\n[49] Library Board Minutes, June 17, 1963 [50] The Preston Citizen, August 22,1963, p. 10 [51] Library Board Minutes, December 2, 1963\n\n[52] Library Board Minutes, March 2, 1964 [53] Library Board Minutes, April 4, 1964 [54] Library Board Minutes, April 16, 1964, page 1\n\n[55] Library Board Meeting, October 14, 1964 [56] Library Board Meeting, December 6, 1964 [57] Library Board Meeting, January, 1965\n\n[58] Library Board Minutes, April 27, 1965 [59] The Preston Citizen, December 8, page 1 [60] The Preston Citizen, May 18, 1967, p. 1\n\n[61] The Preston Citizen, June 8, 1967, page 1 [62] The Preston Citizen, March 3, 1960, p. 3 [63] The Preston Citizen, March 10, 1960, p. 11.\n\n[64] The Preston Citizen, April 28, 1960 p. 5 [65] The Preston Citizen December 1, 1960, p. 1 [66] The Preston Citizen, December 8, 1960, p. 2\n\n[67] The Preston Citizen, January 18, 1962, p.7, “Library Chit-Chat” [68] The Preston Citizen, February 15, 1962, p. 1, “Library Chit-Chat” [69] The Preston Citizen, March 11, 1965, p. 2\n\n[70] The Preston Citizen, March 28, 1968, page 9\n\n​​​Library Board Minutes and Preston Citizen Artlcles:\n\n1970\n\nIt was suggested that the library take over the handling of fund and accounting of the library budget.

Mayor Glen Gamble, Lyle Shipley, Glenn Call, Lee Berquist and Ted Roper.\n\nCITY COUNCIL MINUTES, November 11, 1970\n\nThe water charges for the church-houses were discussed, with a decision that December 1, 1970, if the bills are delinquent the Stake Presidents, Carl Mortenson and Dean Palmer respectively, are to receive a copy of the letter dated October 27, 1970, to the church offices in Salt Lake City, advising the church of the city’s decision to return the park property and responsibility to the church. Also a letter advising them water service will be discontinued if not taken care of.\n\nCITY GIVES PARK BACK; WHO OWNS THE LIBRARY?\n\nThe Preston Citizen, December 6, 1970, p. 1\n\nThe Preston Carnegie Library is built upon the ground deeded to the city by the LDS Church.\n\nThe deed states that if the city does not live up to the conditions of the deed it will revert back\n\nto the church. Recently the City wrote the church that they will no longer abide by the\n\nconditions.\n\nAs far as the City of Preston is concerned the LDS Church can have the city park back and\n\nsome councilmen feel that that included in the package is the property on which the library\n\nsits and the entrance to the park off of State Street.\n\nThe city council in a special meeting on October 26, which came to light this week, notified\n\nthe LDS Church in Salt Lake City that the city could no longer furnish water to the churches of\n\nthe city, which was among the stipulations in the deed to the city in 1915. The deed included\n\nonly the property on which the library now stands and the entrance to the park, the parking\n\narea along the alleyway and possibly the alleyway itself.\n\n“It is the decision of the council this deed with its building conditions is outdated and can\n\nno longer be maintained by the city,” the minutes read.\n\nThe deed was executed in 1915 and in addition to requiring free water to the church buildings of the community it also stipulates that the city will keep up the property known as the city park.\n\nThe old deed came up when the city revamped its water rate structure and started billing the churches. Pres. W. Dean Palmer of the Franklin Stake told the city that the agreement provided for free water and said that he had suggested to the bishops in his stake that they not pay the water bill until the matter was settled.\n\nThe minutes of the special meeting also read that a copy of a letter from Bishop Wayne D. Bell to the council be sent to the church office. The letter said that the LDS wards had to be billed through the agent bishop of a building where more than one church unit meets and not to individual wards. No reference was made to not paying the water bill or the original deed.\n\nThe final paragraph of the minutes pertaining to the action reads that the city will “void the agreement in said deed (deed of the library property, etc.) to the extent of the church reclaiming the parcel of grounds named in the deed.\n\nThe mayor and two councilmen agreed that the action gave the property of the library back to the church, but the other two councilmen disagreed.\n\nMayor Glen Gamble said that if the county won’t help us pay for the library we don’t want a library anyway.\n\nLee Berquist, a council member said, “yes it includes the library property and the entrance to the park\n\nThe only area left owned by the city is the city trailer park which was put in this year.” As for the library, he said, “There won’t be one unless the church operates it.”\n\nLyle Shipley and Thedford Roper said that they understood that the action of the council includes only the area of the park and not that land deeded to the city. Mr. Shipley is the one who made the motion to the council, and Mr. Berquist is the one who seconded it.\n\nThe clerk who prepared the minutes said that it was her understanding that the motion was to include the library property and the entrance. The minutes were approved in the following council meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting state that the city will no longer furnish free water to the churches and that the city will no longer maintain nor furnish water for the city park. Local church officials were undecided which action to take.\n\nThe deed was executed on Feb. 16, 1915 by the “Preston First Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by Henry Bodily, Bishop of the Preston First Ward.” The deed states that if the city does not live up to the conditions of the deed, the church may serve notice and if not complied with on 30 days the “whole of sold property shall revert to the party of the first part, its successors and assignees forever.” The party of the first part is the LDS church. Though the deed was executed in 1915, it was not recorded until July 14, 1919 in the county court house.\n\nCITY COUNCIL MINUTES, December 14, 1970\n\nThe two following resolutions were read and passed upon unanimously:\n\nBe it hereby resolved by the Mayor and city Council of the city of Preston that delinquent taxes prior to 1969 already disbursed to the Preston Carnegie library in the amount of 527.26 as per schedule recorded in the minutes is to be deposited out of the December tax remittance into the General Fund for the grounds and reasons that the City of Preston supported the library prior to the tax year 1969 when said library over-expended their annual appropriation budget. Only delinquent taxes due to the library on 1969 taxes and subsequent years will be deposited to the library fund. For clarification: Delinquent taxes received for years prior to 1969 yet received subsequent to 1969 shall be to the general fund account. (Tax schedule given next)\n\nCITY COUNCIL MINUTES, January 4, 1971\n\nWHEREAS, the city deems the following deed from the church to the city in 1915, outdated, the city desires a new deed giving the property in question to the city with no binding conditions. (A copy of the old deed was then included). AND WHEREAS, the city’s decision is to maintain the church’s billing as follows: water $5.75 sewer, $3.50 and garbage, $2.00 making a total bill of $11.25 per unit and to bill all other church buildings according to their category, and in the event the church desires the city to maintain and care for the park until such time as the church desires to develop or use this ground that a new lease could be drawn up.\n\nA deed executed to Franklin County as follows was discussed:\n\nThis deed, made the 23rd day of February, A.D., 1915 between the Preston First corporation of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Idaho, party of the first part, and Franklin County, a municipal corporation of the State of Idaho in the County of Franklin and State of Idaho, party of the second part, WITNESSETH: That the party of the first part, for and consideration of the sum of one dollar, to it paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, does herby grant, bargain, sell and convey unto the party of the second part his heirs and assigns forever, all the following described land and premises, situated in the County of Franklin, State of Idaho, to wit: Commencing at a point 455 ft. East and 49½ ft. South from the Northwest corner of section 26, township 15 South, Range 39 East, Boise Meridian, and running thence East 200 ft. to the Northeast corner of Block 10 of the Preston town site Survey and running thence South 218 ft. thence West 200 ft., thence North 218 ft. to the place of beginning. No jail or such buildings to be erected on this land unless it be on the inside of the courthouse. This grant is intended for court House and Court House grounds only. TOGETHER with all and singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said premises, with the appurtenances, unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the said party of the first part has caused its name to be subscrived hereto and its corporate seal affixed, by its Bishop, duly authorized, the day and year first above written.\n\nThe church officials expressed they felt billing on each unit was not feasible and thought one bill for the Stake houses was sufficient. They proposed the church would draw up a new deed clear and free, the city would bill only the wards not the stakes, the Seminary or the Welfare house.\n\nThe Mayor expressed the billings would be left the way they are and the city desires a new deed free and clear.\n\nIt was duly moved by Ted Roper and seconded by Lee Berquist to drop the billing on the two stake units retroactive to October, 1970, but the respective wards, seminaries and all other church buildings were to remain the same charge as originally debited out; with each ward to be billed according to units using the building.\n\nThe church officials reported this was satisfactory and they would in exchange notify the Presiding Bishop in Salt Lake city, Utah, to draw up a new deed to the city for the ground in question clear and free to the city with no binding conditions.\n\nAnd that solved a problem that was never mentioned in the Library Board Minutes.\n\n********************\n\n1971\n\nBecause of a coal shortage in the city it was suggested that the coal bin be kept filled at the library. The Chief of Police was contacted about parking spaces in front of the library. Ellen Greaves proposed we try to bring salaries up to minimum wage. It was proposed that we have a sinking fund to take care of major repairs. Start with $500 and add $500 each year in the form of a Savings Certificate to be purchased from First Bank and\n\nTrust of Idaho.[82]\n\nWiring should be replaced before painting is done and investigate the need for re-roofing job. A library loading zone is unavailable due to parking issues. Ada to attend ILA convention in Boise. It was suggested that magazine subscriptions be extended for a longer period of time to save subscription fees.[83]\n\nAda to attend cataloguing workshop in Pocatello; Ada did not attend ILA conference because of illness. Wiring has been replaced and $125 paid to Glen Godfrey. Three windows were broken by rocks from construction of the new bank building--will check insurance coverage. Suggestion was made to buy bank certificates with $2,500 and also a $500 note put in the sinking fund at Idaho Bank and Trust. These issues were delayed until later in the year when finances will be in better shape.[84]\n\nThe summer reading program is to run from July 1 to August 31. Curley Dockstader will replace the windows broken by construction. $2,000 note was purchased for 90 days and a $5oo dollar note for 60 day period for library from First Security Bank.

Inventory was completed on the adult collection and books were pulled for rebinding and/or repair.[85]\n\nA special Christmas story hour was held on December 24 for children under 10.[86]\n\n1972\n\n“Do you have some friend or relative who cannot read fine print, who may be confined to bed and cannot lift a heavy book?\n\nMrs. Bill Hansen, librarian of the Preston Carnegie Public Library, may be able to help provide special reading materials for those with visual problems.\n\nThe local library has on hand 12 large print books and can obtain more from the Regional Center Library in Pocatello, or the Idaho State Library. These are proving very popular with persons who are having difficulty reading popular books in the regular edition.\n\nMrs. Hansen also reports that she can get a talking book machine which is a special phonograph with a very slow speed so any person so handicapped that he or she cannot read printed materials. The phonographs for legally blind are distributed by the Idaho Commission for the Blind, and those for the partially sighted or otherwise physically handicapped are distributed by the Idaho State Library.\n\nAfter a user has the talking book machine, or cassette tape machine, he may obtain talking books, taped books, cassettes braille or large-print books, through the regional library for the Idaho-Utah area.\n\nThis is the Utah State Library, 2150 South 200 West, Salt Lake City. There is a toll-free number, 800-453-5520, which blind and physically handicapped may use to make inquiries or place orders for materials.\n\nThe Idaho State Library contracts with the Utah State Library for this service.”[87]\n\nMayor Gamble was in attendance. A construction grant and the library budget was reviewed and discussed. It was suggested that an application in writing be made for the additional half mill levy allowed to libraries, and also talk to the county about financial support.[88]\n\nThe Preston Carnegie Library budget has been submitted and it was noted that finances for that institution are in better shape than ever before at present, and enough money has been saved and set aside for the old steps to be replaced. The library has been an entity separate from the city budget system for the last three years. Mrs. Ruth Weber was appointed to the Library Board to replace Lyle Shipley[89]\n\nMAY GIVE A BOOK IN MEMORIAL\n\n“All who desire may, upon the death of a friend or loved one, contribute a book or books to the Preston Carnegie Library.\n\nThe donor could state the specific title of the book desired, or the general subject matter. If the contributor has neither a specific book or subject in mind, the choosing of the book could be left to the discretion of the librarian, fitting the personality or interest of the person in whose memory it is given.\n\nThe books so donated would bear a card on the flyleaf inscribed “In memory of _____.” A thank-you card would be sent to the donor and the immediate family by the library.\n\nThe library is presently planning a separate shelf for the memorial books.”[90]\n\nLIBRARY SCHEDULES FILM HOUR\n\n“The Preston Carnegie Library’s summer reading program will end August 19. At 1:00 a film hour will at the library. The films will be based on children’s story books. At that time the winners of the summer reading program will be announced. All children up to the seventh grade that are interested are invited to come.”[91]\n\nDiscussed a meeting with the county commissioners regarding the formation of a county library district. A petition with 75 certified signatures in favor a district was filed at the court house. Notices will be published in the local paper for two weeks prior to the hearing. It is anticipated that it will be on the ballot in November. Landscaping is needed in front of the building and on the parking area as a result of putting in new steps and curbing. Six people have used the talking book machines. Ruth Weber asked to be released from the Library Board. Myrtle Wright donated books to the library.[92]\n\nLIBRARY DISTRICT PUT ON BALLOT\n\n“When the polls open Nov. 7, Franklin County voters will have to decide if the county will form a library district in the county. The board of county commissioners has been discussing library facilities for county residents for some time, and when a public hearing was held Oct. 18, 15 persons attended to register support of the formation of a library district. The Preston Carnegie Library Board was also in attendance at this meeting.\n\nAfter discussion it was decided to put the question to a vote by the general public and the county clerk was asked to draw up a ballot to be used by all voters who are residents of the county, but not by voters in the city of Preston. Preston already has formed a library district. County residents can vote on this issue even if they are not registered voters. Non-registered voters simply sign a sworn statement that they are citizens of the United States, and now reside in the county, that they are 18 years old or older, and not residents of the city of Preston.\n\nIt was noted that the maximum the county can levy for a library is 2 mills. After a district is formed it is not necessary that an organized library be built. The county would contract for services with the now Preston city library. The two districts would combine at a later date, if it is to be found beneficial to both parties, also.\n\n​ When consolidation of city and county library facilities was discussed, Mrs. Ellen Greaves, chairman of the Preston Library board, said that the hours and the facilities of the present library would need to be expanded if the two consolidate.\n\nIf the library district is voted in, it will be included in the 1973 budget and funds will be available in November of that year. One of the library board members, Doug Webb, noted that the library would open its facilities to county residents as soon as the district is formed, and expand its hours and facilities after the district was funded.\n\nThe official ballot for the library district will consist of the sworn statement as to the eligibility of the voter, which will be removed from the actual ballot, and the ballot which explains the issue. The voter will then simply mark “yes” or “no” after the library district question.” [93]\n\nThe needs of both city and county groups as to which source of service would be best to follow was discussed. A member of each board will meet to work on a budget. A cleaning woman was hired for four hours a week after Mrs. Sharp terminated her services.[94]\n\nLIBRARY SETS STORY HOUR\n\n“The Preston Carnegie Library will hold the annual Christmas Story Hour on Saturday. According to Ada Hansen, librarian, all of the children of the county and city, under the age of 11 are invited to the story hour. It will be held at 1 p.m.\n\nThe library will be closed during the holidays and will open again on Jan. 2.\n\nThe library, which is owned by the city of Preston, is now open to all residents of the county without charge, pending action by the new county library board.”[95]\n\n1973\n\nLibrary budget followed with tentative budget. Possible repairs were discussed with no decision reached.[96]\n\nEllen Greaves requests release as chairman because of illness of her husband. It was suggested that she be given a leave of absence instead. Roofing problems were discussed and bids requested. The contract between city and county for library service was discussed between both groups and changes that should be made. The final contract was agreed upon and will be signed as soon as a new draft is drawn up. Longer hours were decided upon to accommodate county people. New hours are 1 to9 on weekdays and 11 to 7 on Saturdays. The audit report was given and the new budget discussed. Quarterly meetings between county and city boards were set for the 4th Thursday of January, April, July, and October[97]\n\nThe librarian was asked to keep bookkeeping records on county circulation, finances and references questions. New carpet and paneling are needed. Stucki Miller will do the roofing for $1,300. A grant for air conditioning was discussed. The contract between the city and county has been signed. The ILA conference was discussed.[98]\n\nLIBRARY WEEK NEARS\n\n“The Preston Carnegie Library will be celebrating National Library Week April 8-14. In connection with observance of library week, there will be a special sewing demonstration. Mrs. Roma Schlehuber of the Stretch and Sew agency in Pocatello, will be here on April 11 at 1:30 to demonstrate the technique of sewing on stretch fabrics. All ladies from the city and county are invited to attend. The library has recently purchased the Stretch and Sew patterns. These will be available for checkout purposes.”[99]\n\nLIBRARY ADDS SERVICE\n\n“Preston Carnegie Library has instigated a program during library week which will be a boon to the woman who sews year round. Through special cooperation with the Stretch N Sew store in Pocatello, the library will now have this brand of pattern to loan. About 60 patterns are now in stock ranging from swimsuits to toddlers to ladies dresses to patterns for men.\n\nAs a special service to the people in the community, Mrs. Roma Schlehuber, owner of the Pocatello Stretch N Sew franchise, gave a demonstration on the sewing technique of one of the company’s newer patterns, the one–size body shirt. During this demonstration she also gave instruction on how to make the individual pattern from those in the library.\n\nMrs. Schlehuber has taught many classes of sewing on knits in the county and similar classes are now underway in the high school during evenings under the community education program, making the availability of these special patterns very timely. They are gauged for sewing on knits only, and employ up-to-date techniques employed by the manufacture of more expensive knits on the retail market ,\n\nPersons needing assistance with the use of the patterns or the special techniques for sewing on knits may contact Mrs. Schlehuber at her Pocatello shop. She will also schedule further classes in the area.\n\nMrs. Ada Hansen, head librarian, said the patterns will be available to individuals on a one-week basis. And a person must be a holder of a library card, as is the case with borrowing of the library’s books and records.\n\nThe desire to bring this service to Preston came to Mrs. Hansen when she noted the program was being carried out in the Portneuf Library in Pocatello.”[100]\n\nNEW LIBRARY HOURS\n\nWeekdays, 1-8, Saturdays 11-7[101]\n\nApril 23, 1974\n\nMeeting with County Board.

People who are unable to come into the library because of illness or other handicaps may receive special service simply by calling 852-0175, the library number.\n\nThey can give specific authors and titles, or just give topics they are interested in, one of the clerks will select the books for them and send them by mail if they live out of the city. They can be returned the same way.\n\nFor those living in the city, they can be delivered to your door. “Try it, you’ll like it.”[103]\n\n“Donations made to Library: The Preston Carnegie Library reports that the Preston Kiwanis Club has donated over 100 merit badge pamphlets to the library’s collection. This makes the Merit Badge books collection totally up to date and is a fine contribution for use of Scouts in the area.\n\nThe Ladies Literary Club has made a generous cash gift for the purchase of children’s books. This contribution has been made annually for many years. The Fine Arts club has also made a generous cash contribution each year for the purchase of children’s books. Literature Club gives the money for two or three books each year to the library. These fine contributions help to improve the library collection and are certainly appreciated.\n\nSummer Reading: The Summer Reading Program for youngsters will begin June 24. Please ask at the library for details.”[104]\n\n“The Preston Carnegie Library has received a $600 state grant for the purchase of library materials. Two volumes of “The Book of Mormon,” one volume of “The Doctrine and Covenants” and “Pearl of Great Price,” and three volumes of Family Hour on cassette tapes have been purchased, said Head Librarian Ada Hansen.

Maybe it’s your teen-age student who has consulted the library staff often and now knows his way around the library in his search for school assignment material.\n\nOr perhaps it’s your husband who has saved a bundle by asking the Librarians for material to help in unraveling some business mysteries. Or it could be you, if you come in often.\n\nThe more you consult the librarians and the more you use the books and materials there, the better you are liked. Join the Library’s popularity contest and you , too, could become their favorite patron. Do it this week during National Library Week!”[110]\n\nRoofing and furnace repairs were discussed.

A mechanical reader will be needed to use the films and other libraries will be contacted to find out types and prices. It might be possible to check one out. It was suggested that this project be coordinated with the genealogy people. The parking area in the rear will soon be blacktopped and then the landscaping will be taken care of. It was suggested that we connect a paved walk from the parking lot with the walk on the east side of the building.
