Azulay Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI freely admit to reading romances―\"Nurse Janes,\" as one of my teachers used to call them―whenever I need a break from heavier material or just from life. While I have some favorite authors (who doesn't?), I do not limit myself to any particular era or style of romance. To me, romance has many shades and flavours, and I enjoy them all. Believe you me, choosing just five to recommend was no piece of cake.\n\nAllison's book list on romance in any style and era\n\nWhy did Allison love this book?\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how sweet and truly romantic Will North'sWater, Stone, Heart turned out to be. I wandered lazily through the Cornish countryside with the main character, meeting quirky locals, becoming fascinated by the mystery of the artist who had settled in a seaside village. And at the conclusion I felt comfortably satisfied. A lovely read. Who says men can't write romance?\n\nBy Will North,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Water, Stone, Heart as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nForty year-old Nicola Rhys-Jones is a woman in hiding. Fleeing an abusive husband, she finds refuge in Boscastle, a village on the rugged coast of Cornwall, England. Andrew Stratton is an American professor of architectural theory. Shocked out of his academic bubble when his ambitious wife leaves him, he signs up for something tangible: a course in the art of stone wall-building—in Boscastle.\n\nFrom the moment they meet, Nicola and Andrew are attracted to each other, but at daggers drawn. Nicola, sexy yet sarcastic, is an expert at fending off men. In Andrew, she meets her match: quick-witted, funny, yet…\n\nPreview\n\nLawman\n\nBy Diana Palmer,\n\nFrom my list on romance in any style and era.\n\nBy Allison M.

Believe you me, choosing just five to recommend was no piece of cake.\n\nAllison's book list on romance in any style and era\n\nWhy did Allison love this book?\n\nLawman was my introduction to the novels of Diana Palmer, which have become my go-to for contemporary romance. Perhaps I found Lawman compelling because the heroine's history of trauma stirred some memories of my own. The taut thriller quality of the tale certainly kept me reading, as well. And a happy ending is a must, even if I want to slap a stubborn hero upside the head from time to time. (Well, yes, the heroine sometimes needs an attitude check, too.)\n\nBy Diana Palmer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Lawman as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen San Antonio FBI agent Garon Grier buys a ranch in Jacobsville, Texas, the strong, silent loner is hoping to mend some broken family fences. He's not looking for love. Grace Carver grew up in this quiet Texas town, but because of her troubled youth, she's never married—hadn't even thought about it…until Garon.\n\nThese unlikely allies are brought together by the most difficult case of Garon's career: hunting an escaped child predator whose former victims are all dead. All except one.\n\nNow a desperate lawman and the woman who is the lone survivor of a madman's twisted rampage have one…\n\nPreview\n\nKiss of the Highlander\n\nBy Karen Marie Moning,\n\nFrom my list on romance in any style and era.\n\nBy Allison M.

Azulay Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI freely admit to reading romances―\"Nurse Janes,\" as one of my teachers used to call them―whenever I need a break from heavier material or just from life. While I have some favorite authors (who doesn't?), I do not limit myself to any particular era or style of romance. To me, romance has many shades and flavours, and I enjoy them all. Believe you me, choosing just five to recommend was no piece of cake.\n\nAllison's book list on romance in any style and era\n\nWhy did Allison love this book?\n\nI know, it sounds absurd to recommend a book entitled Heller with a Gun as a romance. But in fact many books of the Western genre have all the elements of romance along with the ultra-American setting, action, and adventure that gave them their own niche. In this particular book, I found the Mr./Miss Right versus Mr./Miss Wrong dilemma and could not put the book down until the problem resolved itself in classic Western style.\n\nBy Louis L'Amour,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Heller with a Gun as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTom Healy was in trouble. His theatrical troupe needed to get to Alder Gulch, Montana, and the weather was turning. Andy Barker promised Tom he could get them there safely, but Tom was reluctant to trust him: he had the lives of three actresses to consider, and his personal feelings for Janice further heightened his concern. Then King Mabry showed up. Although Tom didn’t like the way he looked at Janice, he could see that Mabry made Barker uneasy. So Tom invited Mabry to join them. Tom was right to be worried, because Barker had a plan. He knew that…\n\nPreview\n\nBurden Falls\n\nBy Kat Ellis,\n\nFrom my list on ghost books for teen readers.\n\nBy Dawn Kurtagich Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI often refer to myself as a haunted body. Death is something that has fascinated and alarmed me since I can remember. I’ve even had a spooky experience or five that I can’t explain. But to write a ghost story is akin to making someone fall in love with you, or lean in close to hear a secret. I love the intrigue and power of that kind of tale. Our oldest stories are ghost stories and the biggest and most enduring mystery for the entirety of humanity is: Is there life after death?\n\nDawn's book list on ghost books for teen readers\n\nWhy did Dawn love this book?\n\nI love a vengeful ghost. And Dead-Eyed Sadie, who haunts the little town of Burden Falls, is like an eyeless grudge’s Kayako Saeki. I almost expected to hear that horrible death rattle while flipping the pages. After a series of nightmares and a vision of Sadie, and the appearance of a dead body, teen sleuth, Ava Thorne is determined to solve the town’s murder problem before she becomes the main suspect. With a cursed waterfall and a vengeful ghost to contend with, it should be simple… right? Not when the murderer seems to have a vendetta against the Thornes and there’s a ghost on the loose.\n\nBy Kat Ellis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Burden Falls as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nRiverdale meets The Haunting of Hill House in the unmissable next novel from the author of Harrow Lake.\n\n\"Cinematic, clever, and creepy, with a main charactger that leaps off the page, Burden Falls ticks off all my moody thriller boxes.\" —Goldy Moldavsky, New York Times bestselling author of The Mary Shelley Club and Kill the Boy Band\n\nThe town of Burden Falls drips with superstition, from rumors of its cursed waterfall to Dead-Eyed Sadie, the disturbing specter who haunts it. Ava Thorn grew up right beside the falls, and since a horrific accident killed her parents a year ago, she's…\n\nPreview\n\nA Master of Djinn\n\nBy P. Djèlí Clark,\n\nFrom my list on historical fantasy for armchair travel.\n\nBy Caroline Stevermer Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI write fantasy novels, including A College of Magics, River Rats, and When the King Comes Home. With Patricia C. Wrede, I wrote half of the Kate and Cecy series: Sorcery and Cecelia, The Grand Tour, and The Mislaid Magician.\n\nCaroline's book list on historical fantasy for armchair travel\n\nWhy did Caroline love this book?\n\nAgent of the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments, and Supernatural Entities, Fatma el-Sha'arawi is the spectacularly well-dressed protagonist tasked with saving the world (again) in an alternate 1912 Cairo. This award-winning novel awed me with its detail and invention. What I loved most was the way the world building relegated the British Empire to relative unimportance. Come to think of it, I loved the Ministry library almost as much.\n\nBy P. Djèlí Clark,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked A Master of Djinn as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIncluded in NPR’s Favorite Sci-Fi And Fantasy Books Of The Past Decade (2011-2021)\n\nA Nebula Award Winner\n\nA Ignyte Award Winner\n\nA Compton Crook Award for Best New Novel Winner\n\nA Locus First Novel Award Winner\n\nA RUSA Reading List: Fantasy Winner\n\nA Hugo Award Finalist\n\nA World Fantasy Award Finalist\n\nA NEIBA Book Award Finalist\n\nA Mythopoeic Award Finalist\n\nA Dragon Award Finalist\n\nA Best of 2021 Pick in SFF for Amazon\n\nA Best of 2021 Pick in SFF for Kobo\n\nNebula, Locus, and Alex Award-winner P.

I always wanted to be a detective, but one that didn’t have to do a lot of chasing, like Starsky and Hutch, or get beat up a lot, like Mannix—one who could take a laid-back approach and work his own hours, like Ellery Queen. I wound up becoming a forensic specialist who also writes thrillers. The protagonists have my same job, only with smarter criminals and better-looking colleagues. I also grew up playing the clarinet—not, I admit, particularly well—in a band and/or orchestra from the fourth grade until well after I married.\n\nLisa's book list on crime for music lovers\n\nWhy did Lisa love this book?\n\nIn July of 1980, a beautiful violinist disappeared during a 45-minute break while the visiting ballet company used a prerecorded piece. Helen Hagnes Mintiks was a Julliard grad who had played with professionals since her teens. After the evening’s performance ended, her colleagues knew—as any musician would—that Helen would never have left the building without her violin. It took another nine hours to find her body, thrown down a ventilation shaft, hands tied with knots that stagehands used. A witness led them to the killer, who promptly confessed—a real villain, robbing the world of a kind-hearted talent out of lust. I read this book probably 30 years ago, while I was reading my way through the entire true crime section of the Cleveland Public Library.\n\nBy David Black,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Murder at the Met as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe inside story, written with the cooperation of the detectives involved, of the investigation into the murder of a young violinist\n\nPreview\n\nA Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking\n\nBy T. Kingfisher,\n\nFrom my list on make you laugh and punch you in the feels.\n\nBy Caitlin Rozakis Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve never been a fan of polemics or schmaltz. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to learn or see new perspectives or feel deep feelings; I just think humor is the best way to get past people’s defenses. (All the better to sucker punch them in the feels.) I also think the world can be a pretty dark and scary place. I love books that give us hope, enough hope to have the courage to change what we can to make the world a little brighter.\n\nCaitlin's book list on make you laugh and punch you in the feels\n\nWhy did Caitlin love this book?\n\nI loved this book because it combines three of my favorite things—humor, fantasy, and baking. What’s not to like about a wizard whose familiar is a sourdough starter?\n\nThere’s a small army of hilarious gingerbread men, to boot. T. Kingfisher manages a weird balance between humor, horror, and heart. Her world, like ours, has some really dark stuff in it, but she has such a deft touch that I felt cozy even during murder, political scapegoating, and siege.\n\nBy T. Kingfisher,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFourteen-year-old Mona isn't like the wizards charged with defending the city.

An assassin is stalking the streets of Mona's city, preying on magic folk, and it appears that Mona is his next target. And in an embattled city suddenly bereft of wizards, the assassin may be the least of…\n\nPreview\n\nRed Bones\n\nBy Ann Cleeves,\n\nWhy did Carole love this book?\n\nI have read and loved all of Ann Cleeves’ books about Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, set on the Scottish Shetland Islands. Red Bones is about two feuding families with generations of secrets between them, who are somehow involved in at least two murders. Islands, particularly those that are small and/or remote, foster communities that are incredibly tight-knit by necessity – often your survival entirely depends on one another. That has always made me wonder what lengths such communities might go to in order to survive; what secrets they might have to keep, what lies they might have to tell if something terrible happens that could jeopardise their whole existence. My time living on the Isle of Lewis in the Scottish Outer Hebrides very much inspiredThe Blackhouse, but it was in no small part also inspired by the wild Shetland Islands as described in Cleeves’ wonderful stories.\n\nBy Ann Cleeves,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Red Bones as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe third Shetland novel featuring detective Jimmy Perez.\n\nSometimes the dead won't stay buried . . .\n\nWhen a young archaeologist uncovers a set of human remains, the island settlers are intrigued. Is it an ancient find - or a more contemporary mystery?\n\nThen an elderly woman is shot in what appears to be a tragic accident in the middle of the night, Shetland detective Jimmy Perez is called to investigate.\n\nThe sparse landscape and the emptiness of the sea have bred a fierce and secretive people. As Jimmy looks to the islanders for answers, he finds instead two feuding…\n\nPreview\n\nProvidence\n\nBy Caroline Kepnes,\n\nWhy did Diane love this book?\n\nThis compulsively readable novel by Cape Cod native and television writer Kepnes (7th Heaven, The Secret Life of the American Teenager) begins in a New Hampshire middle school where nerdy Jon and sweet Chloe are best friends united against the provincial attitudes of their small town. Everyone is shocked when John is kidnapped and given up for dead. Years later he turns up in Providence, where he has been kept in a coma by a rogue neuroscience professor who wants to transform him into the monster of The Dunwich Horror by Providence’s own, ambivalently celebrated H.P. Lovecraft. When John learns that he now has terrifying powers that put him at odds with everyone he loves, he sets out to find the professor whose recklessness got him into this mess—and maybe saved his life.\n\nBy Caroline Kepnes,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Providence as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n*** From the bestselling author of YOU, now a major Netflix TV series ***\n\n'Compelling' Observer\n\nWith her trademark flair, precision eye for detail and acerbic wit, Caroline Kepnes brings the suspense thriller to a whole new level with PROVIDENCE - a dark story of death, loss, horror, redemption and the love that binds us all.\n\nIn 2008, 13-year-old Jon Bronson disappears on his morning walk to school.
