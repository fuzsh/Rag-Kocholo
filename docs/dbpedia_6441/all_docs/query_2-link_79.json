        "text": "ahina. Cahina was created by Leo Charles Dessar and appears in A Royal Enchantress (1900). Dessar (1847-1924) is something of a mystery; I�ve been unable to find any information about him apart from his birth and death dates. Cahina (or, alternatively, �Kahena� or �Kahina�) was a real person, a Queen of the Berbers in the 7th and 8th Century C.E. who fought against the Muslim invasion. Gibbons wrote about her in Volume 2, Chapter 514 of his The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (you can read it online if you like). Dessar was struck by Gibbons� paragraph: �the meager account of this beautiful Prophetess-Queen of the Berbers was inspiring, yet irritating: it suggested so much, yet told so little.� From this Dessar spun out a very entertaining historical fantasy.\n\nA Royal Enchantress is about Cahina, a Queen of the Berbers of North Africa in 697 C.E. She is descended of Jewish, Berber, and Greek/Byzantine forebears, but was taken from her mother, the Queen, when young and raised by the high priest Askalon. Within a few years Cahina had mastered the lore of the priests and even grasped the Higher Mysteries. When the King dies Cahina becomes the Queen of the Berbers, who at this time lived in a glorious city. Cahina out-maneuvers Askalon, who lusts after her, and endures a loveless marriage with another monarch for the sake of her kingdom. Eventually, however, she finds love (in the form of Cornelius, a handsome Greek soldier) and happiness (the birth of her son). But nothing lasts forever, and when the Muslim armies invade her country Cahina�s armies defeat the invaders in one battle but fail to capture the Muslim�s leader, Hassan. Cahina, sure that the Muslims will return in greater numbers, convinces her followers to raze their own cities and farmland and bury their treasures, on the grounds that with no city to loot and no treasures to find, the Muslims won�t be interested and will leave them alone. (I know, I know�not the brightest move. And yet there it is in Gibbons. Historical fact, rather than bad writing on Dessar�s part. Go figure). But the self-destruction of the Berbers� city fails to stop the Muslims, who return, destroy the Berber armies, capture Cahina, and behead her after she refuses to convert to Islam.\n\nI came to A Royal Enchantress after reading Cooper, which as you might imagine meant that I was all a-tingle with delight. (You have no idea how much I loathed Last of the Mohicans. Not even my entry on Hawkeye can aptly describe my hatred for that book). But the appropriate comparison for A Royal Enchantress is really Salammbô. Dessar doesn�t take things quite so far as Flaubert did. Dessar�s creation is exotic without being decadent. Dessar�s not the stylist that Flaubert is, of course, and Dessar does not layer on the endless amount historically accurate detail that Flaubert did or try to be impressionistic, as Flaubert was. But Dessar also does not create a first-this-happened-and-then-that-happened history-in-motion novel, the way that Flaubert did. A Royal Enchantress is more of a classic heroic fantasy, with the beautiful heroine (Cahina), the handsome hero (Cornelius), and the dastardly villain (first Askalon and then Hassan, the leader of the Muslim armies). A Royal Enchantress is colorful, has a brisk pace, and has a good (though not overwhelming in the Flaubert fashion) amount of historical detail. The dialogue is faux-Shakespearean (�Examine for me this part of the manuscript, and if thou canst unfold the mysteries there hidden, I will grant thee any gift thou dost desire�) but is not clumsily written and actually flows rather well. The characterization is concise, and sufficient space is given to the characters� interior lives that they gain a decent amount of depth�decent for a historical fantasy written in 1900, anyhow. Dessar does not shy away from the cruelty and horrors of the time, either; there are flayings and sacrifices to Moloch accompanying the feats of arms and knightly duels. Dessar does not, however, engage in the casual anti-Semitism of so many other Victorian novelists, and (most unusually) he makes an effort to treat Muslims fairly.\n\nCahina herself is a vividly drawn, larger-than-life personality. She�s clearly influenced to some degree from H. Rider Haggard�s Ayesha (who will, of course, make her way on to these pages sooner or later), but Dessar is a skillful enough writer to make her more than yet another She lift. Cahina is somewhat haughty, but is religious (a devout worshiper of the Phoenician and Egyptian gods) and chaste; Dessar spends a good deal of time exploring her childhood and adolescence so that the reader sees why Cahina can be haughty. She�s not just intelligent but clever, out-witting her enemies as queen and lying to her people to get them to do what is best for the kingdom. She is indeed a prophetess, being given visions (from her �guardian angel�) of faraway events, the past, and the future. The downside to this is that she receives her visions while possessed (perhaps by that same guardian angel) and while possessed she does things she sometimes regrets later, like ordering the destruction of the Berber kingdom. Besides the power of prophecy, she has very strong animal magnetism, can cause visions among others, and can control others� minds.\n\nA Royal Enchantress is not on the level of the true classics of the Victorian age, but it�s excellent entertainment nonetheless.\n\naptain Bantam. Captain Bantam was created by William Wood, a writer I know nothing about. Bantam appeared in The Popular Magazine in five stories from 1904-1905. Captain Bantam is one of several sea captain heroes, like Captain Kettle, Commander McTurk (see below) and Wolf Larsen, who were prominent in the popular culture of Britain and America during the turn of the century. Bantam is an acerbic, scowling, hard man who runs his ship hard and his crew harder. His ship, the Dione, is old and balky, but he manages to make it go. In his five stories, which are all linked, he sets out for Africa to seize land there and establish a kingdom of his own; if there are natives on the land, so much the worse for them. (As one critic put it, the Captain Bantam stories have little to do with seamanship and a lot to do with colonialism) Bantam is backed in this by a London syndicate and is determined not to be stopped. (While he is not a genocidalist, he is fixated on his goals: land, power, and a pension for himself) When the Dione is stopped by a British destroyer patrol, Bantam lies his way out of the predicament (hardly fitting behavior for a British gentleman). When he finally finds a suitable kingdom for himself, in an area something like the Congo, he trades with the king of the land: the Dione for the kingdom, the king being allowed to take the country's treasury with him. But the king drowns as he flees the area, and a British military expedition takes control of the land. They throw Bantam a sop, however, and appoint him \"Commissioner\" of the territory. Bantam scowls but accepts this title, even though he has no training for it, as it will pay him the pension he so longs for.\n\naptain Black. Captain Black appeared in The Iron Pirate: A Plain Tale of Strange Happenings on the Sea (1893) and its sequel Captain Black (1911), both written by Sir Max Pemberton (1863-1950). Pemberton was a writer (over 60 novels) and editor (of Chums and Cassell's Magazine) and then director of Northcliffe Newspapers, being knighted for various good works in 1928. He also founded the London School of Journalism.\n\nThe Iron Pirate is about Captain Black, a short man with a long beard who is habitually given to wearing black clothes and smoking cigars. Black is a pirate; he commands a rough lot of men and is cruel towards those who disobey him or who make mistakes. His crew follow him through fear, which he is cunning and resourceful enough to continually exploit for his own ends.\n\nBlack, as I said, is a pirate. He started out getting rich on a copper mine in Michigan, but after the death of his son he turned bitter and misanthropic and decided to rob and sink everything he could get his hands on. He used his wealth to build a special, one-of-a-kind ship, and used it to rule the seas. The ship, which is never given a title in The Iron Pirate, is made of \"phosphor-bronze,\" a special kind of super-tough metal that shines and gleams like gold. The ship, capable of great speed, is driven by gas and is a \"great, well-armed cruiser\" filled with cannon and machine guns.\n\nBlack sails under two flags: one Chilean (much to the surprise of the Chilean government, who have no connection with Black) and one black (and what other flag should a pirate sail under?). After he captures a ship he loots it and then sinks it; those on the ship he takes to his hidden port in Greenland, where they are forced to work to death in Black's coal mines.\n\nAt the end of the novel Black is cornered by a European fleet and his ship sunk, and in angry despair he drowns himself. Apparently, in the sequel (which I hope was more entertainingly-written than The Iron Pirate) he returns with a Nautilus-like submarine.\n\naptain Chlamyl. Captain Chlamyl appeared in Across the Zodiac. A Story of Adventure (1893), which was written by Edwin Pallander, an author I know little about apart from his travelogue The Log of an Island Wanderer. Notes of Travel in the Eastern Pacific (1901) and his collaboration with Ellsworth Douglass, he of Dr. Ginocchio Gyves.\n\nCaptain Chlamyl, like Across the Zodiac itself, is heavily indebted to Jules Verne. Briefly, Captain Chlamyl is a brilliant scientist and inventor and a bad man, embodying most of Nemo's bad qualities--the megalomania, the contempt for ordinary man--and none of his good ones. Thanks to Vincent Mollet I can now confirm that, contrary to what I said before, Chlamyl is based on Prince Schamyl/Chlamyl, one of the rebels against the Russian conquest of the Caucasus during the nineteenth century. And Stanislaw Bocian added that \"He is still very famous in those parts, as witnessed by continuing popularty of his name. Shamil Basayev, one of more known Chechen commanders, is named after him.\"\n\nChlamyl is the inventor of the Astrolabe, a wondrous Nautilus/Albatross-like ship capable of interplanetary travel. (It is powered by a gravity-nullifying \"gyroscope\") Three rather colourless scientists are observing an active volcano in Iceland from a balloon drift too close to the volcano and are on the verge of falling into the crater when they are rescued by Chlamyl, who takes the trio along with him rather than depositing them safely back with more civilised folk. The Astrolabe is on its maiden voyage, and it visits the moon, which has the remains of a civilisation on it but is long dead, and Saturn, where they find primitive life and a still-developing world. Unfortunately, Chlamyl, a brutal and arrogant man, mistreats his crew, which leads to a mutiny. A \"gas explosion\" disables the Astrolabe and it drifts, powerless, towards the sun. Fortunately for all concerned (except the reader) Chlamyl et al are saved by the gravitational tug of Venus, which swings them around. They then land on a comet and ride it back to Earth.\n\nThere's really not that much of interest in Across the Zodiac, which is of interest only to those who feel like reading third-rate imitations of Verne.\n\nMr. Peter Bayly wrote in with the following:\n\nE.P. was the nom-de-plume of my grandfather Lancelot Francis Sanderson Bayly, born 16 Oct. 1869 in County Tipperary and died 4 Dec.1952. He was of independent means and a keen botanist, biologist and musician. I have never read Across the Zodiac but my copy of \"Micro-Man\" [see the Dr. Geoffrey Hassler entry for Mr. Bayly's comments on Micro-Man--Jess] has the usual excerpts from press reviews which are much more favourable than yours. I suspect some of this is down to chauvinism as most of the reviews compare him with Verne; e.g. \" Since Jules Verne's 'Voyage to the Moon' nothing so powerful or so fascinating in the way of pseudo-scientific romance has appeared as the volume now being commented on; the novel of the French writer is at the absolute zero of imagination compared with the gorgeous and ofttimes lurid fancy of 'Across the Zodiac'.\" - North British Daily Mail. I have to concede that Verne's books have stood the test of time better than E.P.'s but \"Micro-Man\" is still worth reading.\n\naptain Mors. On this page I used to have an extensive selection of information on Captain Mors, Der Luftpirat. Captain Mors, for those of you new here, was the hero in Der Luftpirat und Sein Lenkbares Luftschiff, a German dime novel published from 1908-1911. Captain Mors was a masked hero who fought for good on Earth and in space. But this page is already fairly lengthy and takes a while to download, and the Captain Mors entry was long and had a number of images, making this page entirely too large and slow in loading. So in the interest of saving space on this site as well as decreasing download time for this page in particular, I've moved all the information on Captain Mors and Der Luftpirat und Sein Lenkbares Luftschiff to my Captain Mors Page. On that site I have as much information on Der Luftpirat as there is available in English as well as, hey hey, e-texts of three of Kapitan Mors' adventures, including his first appearance. Plus, of course, the cover illustrations and scans that I previously had here. Give it a try, won't you?\n\naptain Nemo (I). Captain Nemo was created by Jules Verne and appeared in Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, 1869-1870) and L�Ile Mystérieuse (The Mysterious Island, 1875). Verne is one of the fathers of modern science fiction and is responsible for several of the characters on this site.\n\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea begins with a series of sightings of a mysterious sea creature which is blamed for sinking several ships. An American warship is dispatched to hunt it down and kill it, and Pierre Aronnax, a noted Professor at the Museum of Paris, is invited along. He is accompanied by his servant Conseil. The creature is found and fired upon, only to have it strike the ship, throwing Aronnax, Conseil, and the French-Canadian whaler Ned Land (who was also on the ship) overboard. The trio is rescued. They don�t know their rescuers name at first, but it quickly becomes clear that they have been rescued by Captain Nemo and are on the Nautilus, Nemo�s wonderful submarine. Unfortunately, Nemo is a misanthrope who has foresworn human society, and the trio are not so much guests on the Nautilus as they are prisoners. Months pass as the trio are held on the sub. For Aronnax, this is not an imposition, but rather a pleasure, for Nemo is usually good company as well as a man who delights in showing Aronnax the splendors of the sea. Conseil is content to accompany Aronnax wherever he go. Land, however, grows restive, being uninterested in fish except as things to be caught and eaten.\n\nNemo�s pleasant side is more often on display, but occasionally his misanthropic side comes to the fore. Aronnax doesn�t find Nemo�s vendetta against the hated cachalots, sperm whales, particularly reprehensible, but when the Nautilus sinks a warship Aronnax is more offended. Nemo, meanwhile, declines from his initially not unfriendly mood into one of melancholy and despair. Over the course of the novel he loses two sailors and kills many with his submarine, and eventually it is too much for him. Eventually the Nautilus, aimlessly drifting, makes its way into the Maelstrom off of the coast of Norway, and Aronnax, Conseil, and Land barely escape. Twenty Thousand Leagues ends with Aronnax and the reader not knowing what the final fate of Nemo and the Nautilus was.\n\nIn The Mysterious Island Nemo returns, but only at the end of the novel. Most of the novel concerns Cyrus Smith and a group of men stranded on a lonely island in the Pacific. They are helped by a mysterious benefactor who at the end of the novel is revealed to be Captain Nemo. (They recognise him because they�ve read Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea). Nemo, in Mysterious Island, is not the misanthrope of Leagues, but rather a repentant old man, dying in a marooned Nautilus. At the end of the novel Nemo has died and the Nautilus is scuttled.\n\nIn a way, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea is typical Verne. There is the scrupulous attention to achievable, realizable science and careful extrapolation from known science and scientific principles. Verne is concerned with the probable and the possible, as opposed to Wells, who uses science as a tool for his message. So the Nautilus is as close to real a Verne could make it, with the exception of the source of its power, which Verne explains with a hand-waving reference to a different sort of electricity than normal: \"'Professor,' said Captain Nemo, 'my electricity is not everybody's and that is all that you will permit me to say about it.'\"\n\nThere is the careful attention (or, less kindly, the pedantic obsession) with details and facts, so that Leagues is full of facts about the sea. Unfortunately, Verne lets his obsession overwhelm his storytelling sense, so that what might have been a fluidly told story is constantly interrupted, sometimes for pages on end, with lists of animals and plants which Aronnax sees. Dialogue all too often is used for infodumps, so that Verne can unload whopping great heaps of information on the reader. Characters lecture each other at length, and while the information therein establishes verisimilitude and shows that Verne did his homework it's all too often uninteresting to the reader as well as interrupting the pace of the novel.\n\nThere are Verne's favored themes of travel and the sea. Verne had long been interested in the sea--a Verne family story, possibly apocryphal, had him trying to run away as an eleven year old and enlist as a cabin boy on a ship bound for the Indies, but being caught at the last moment--and he returns to it in a number of his novels. World travel, something much more exotic and interesting and unusual to readers of his day than to ours, is similarly an interest (see the Phileas Fogg entry for more on this) and it is one indulged here, with Nemo taking the Nautilus around the world and to the South Pole.\n\nAnd then there is Nemo's misanthropy. There is a general critical consensus that the darkening of Verne's personal outlook--he underwent a series of personal tragedies in 1886, including an attempt on his life by a nephew, the deaths of his mother and his good friend and publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and the crippling of his leg, all of which left him more cynical and depressed--is reflected in the increased misanthropy of his protagonists. While this is true to a certain degree, especially with regard to the change in character of Robur, such isn't the case with Nemo. In Leagues Nemo is a misanthrope, but by the time of Mysterious Island he has reformed and become benevolent. And his misanthropy and recovery both take place before the 1886 events which affected Verne.\n\nNo, Nemo's misanthropy comes from the Romantic tradition. Verne intended Nemo to be a Romantic great man, genius, and anti-Hero. The Romantics saw the defiance of society as indication of genius, of a man unrestrained by the degrading shackles of society. The ostracized Romantic genius is unappreciated, his talent unvalued, and his intellectual and spiritual values rejected by the soulless materialistic society which does not appreciate his naturally superior talents. Axel is one of the foremost figures in this mode, and Nemo is a conscious successor to it. However, Nemo (like, let�s be frank, many of the Romantics, fictional and real) is not immune to hypocrisy. He criticizes Aronnax and those who have pursued him, and yet he has been sinking ships�hardly the act of a man who truly wants to be left alone. Nemo proudly claims that �I am not what you call a civilized man! I have broken with society entirely, for reasons which I alone have the right to assess. I therefore do not obey its laws, and I advise you never to allude to them before me again!� Nemo seems to think that this and this alone renders him immune to the judgment of society, despite his sinking ships and funding revolutions. To modern readers, the flaw in his thinking is obvious, and not particularly salutary. Likewise, his desire to �live�live in the bosom of the waters! Only there can one have independence! There I recognize no masters! There I am free!� is at odds with his interaction with the surface world and with his stated desire to help oppressed peoples. He can�t be, in essence, a patron to rebels and remain free from the world.\n\nThis hypocrisy extends to Nemo�s respect for nature. He does, indeed, value the world beneath the sea and sees it as superior to the world above the sea, but he�s no pacifist, and he is quite happy to slaughter every cachalot he finds. Like the Romantic heroes, his values and judgment are superior to all others, and so he takes action based on them, without thinking about consequences. The cachalots are a part of the natural food chain; killing them seriously imbalances the population of the sea. To Nemo this point does not occur; all he sees are the defenseless whales and the predatory cachalots.\n\nNemo is so far gone in his rejection of the surface world that he will not even eat food produced on it: �For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth, and I am never ill now...I never use the meat of land animals.� This extends even to the clothing he and his crew wear.\n\nNemo does have hypocrisy, and even some viciousness, as in his sinking of the warship, but Aronnax does mention his �kindness� on several occasions. It�s all part of the Romantic Great Man syndrome. Nemo is capable of remorseless killing--well, remorseless while he's doing it, although he clearly feels remorse afterward--but he weeps for his dying sailor.\n\nNemo, really, is much the most interesting thing about Twenty Thousand Leagues. The public image of Nemo has been greatly shaped by the film portrayals of the character, most especially the James Mason version. What isn�t widely remembered (if it was ever known to begin with) is that the Nemo of Twenty Thousand Leagues is not the same Nemo of Mysterious Island.\n\nVerne originally intended Nemo to be a wealthy Polish count whose daughters had been raped and whose wife and father were killed by the Russians during the 1863 Polish insurrection. However, Russia had proved to be a very lucrative market for Verne�s stories, and Pierre-Jules Hetzel, Verne�s publisher legitimately feared that Czar Alexander II would ban Twenty Thousand Leagues if it portrayed Nemo as a Polish nationalist. Verne reached a compromise with Hetzel and kept Nemo�s ethnicity nebulous. In Twenty Thousand Leagues Nemo is described in this way\n\nThe second unknown man deserves a more detailed description. A disciple of Gratiolet or Engel could read his open physiognomy. I immediately recognised his dominating qualites: his confidence, for he held his head nobly on an arc fromed by the line of his shoulders, and his black eyes looked at me with a cold assurance; his calm, for his skin, pale rather than colored, exhibited the quietness of his blood; his energy, which was seen in the quick contraction of his muscles; and finally his courage, for his great respiration implied a big heart.\n\nI judged that this man could be trusted, for his close looks and his calm seemed to reflect deep thoughts, and that the homogeneity of expressions in the gestures of the body and face, following an observation of his physiognomy, resulted an inscrutable frankness.\n\nI felt myself involuntarily reassured in his presence, and this augured well for our interview.\n\nThis person had thirty-five or fifty years, I was unable to judge more closely. He was tall, with a wide forehead, a straight nose, a clearly drawn mouth, magnificent teeth, fine hands, a lengthy and eminent body...all of which seemed worthy to serve such a high and fascinated soul. This man formed certainly the most admirable type that I had ever met.\n\nThe image of Nemo which accompanied this passage in the first edition of Twenty Thousand Leagues was drawn by Alphonse de Neuville, and clearly shows Nemo to be a white man. Also, Nemo says that �I studied in London, Paris and New York when I still lived on land,� a course of instruction only a wealthy member of the European nobility could or would have taken. (�Nemo,� of course, is not his real name. In Latin �nemo� means �no man� or �nobody.� In calling himself this �Nemo� is being coy as well as indulging in the alienation and isolation so beloved of the Romantic anti-hero.) However, when Verne wrote The Mysterious Island from 1871-1873 he changed that. The Nemo of Island is an Indian, driven to misanthropy by British injustice. Verne, in The Mysterious Island, describes Nemo�s origin in this way:\n\nCaptain Nemo was an Indian, Prince Dakkar, the son of a rajah of the then independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero, Tippu-Sahib. His father sent him to Europe when he was ten years old so that he would receive a thorough education and with the secret hope that he would fight one day with equal arms against those whom he considered to be the oppressors of his country....\n\nIn 1857, the great Sepoy revolt erupted. Prince Dakkar was its soul. He organized the immense upheaval. He put his talents and his riches to the service of this cause. He sacrificed himself; he fought in the front lines; he risked his life like the humblest of those heroes who had risen up to free their country; he was wounded ten times in twenty battles but could not find death when the last soldiers of the fight for independence fell under English bullets.\n\nBundelkhand�Verne wrote �Bundelkund� in error�was, during the British rule, located in the eastern section of the Central India Agency. Today it is a part of Madhya Pradesh, in north central India.\n\n�Tippu-Sahib� is Tipu Sultan (1753-1799), one of India�s more interesting figures. Tipu, the Sultan of Mysore, was a vocal supporter of the principles of the American and French Revolution while also owning a mechanical tiger which he used to torture his enemies. He was also the first man known to use rockets in war. Tipu Sultan was the son of Haidar Ali (1721-1782), who took the throne of Mysore in 1761, fought the British in the First Mysore War (1766-1769), and forced them to sign a treaty of mutual assistance. Haidar Ali received no support from the British in his own war with the Marathas, another powerful Indian ethnic group, and so allied himself with France and attacked the British in the Carnatic in 1780 in the Second Mysore War. Haidar Ali was killed in 1782 and Tipu Sultan was forced to make peace with the British in 1783 when French aid to Mysore ceased. In 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the city of Travancore, starting the Third Mysore War, but he was defeated in 1792 by Lord Cornwallis. In 1799 Tipu, deep in correspondence and negotiation with the French, refused to cooperate with the British Governor General, Richard Wellesley, in his efforts to suppress French influence in India. The British sent two armies into Mysore and drove Tipu into Seringapatam, his capital, and took it by storm. Tipu died, bravely fighting in a breach in the walls.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the quotation in Chapter Three of Part Two of Twenty Thousand Leagues. After Nemo has saved the Indian pearl diver, Aronnax points out to Nemo that his heart was not entirely crushed by his past:\n\nWhen I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved tone, �That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am still, and shall be, to my last breath, from that country!�\n\nNow, obviously this is meant to be read in a more general sense, but in light of the revelations of Mysterious Island the line is a curious one, if not a complete foreshadow.\n\nBesides Nemo�s ethnicity and personal history there are other inconsistencies and contradictions between Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and The Mysterious Island. Leagues is set between 1867 and 1868, while Island begins in 1865 and ends in 1867, although in Island Nemo claims to have been living on Lincoln Island for ten years. Similarly, the racial make-up of the crew of the Nautilus changes from mixed in Leagues, with their own unique language, to Indian in Island.\n\nTwenty Thousand Leagues is, as mentioned, typical Verne. In some ways it is typical Verne taken to extremes�the lists of facts are longer, the lectures are more detailed, the central character more interesting, and the science as grounded but more extrapolated than in his other works. The novel lags somewhat until Nemo appears, and although he is the clear center of the novel Verne spends a great deal of time on Aronnax, Ned Land, and the flora and fauna of the sea, so that the personality of Nemo, that which is truly compelling about the novel, is seen much more briefly than, for example, lectures on the science of the Nautilus. This is unfortunate, as it dilutes the power of the novel. Verne�s interests are likely not to be the same as the reader�s, which makes the novel less interesting than it should be. Too, the style of the dialogue is somewhat formal and dated, which is an inevitable byproduct of the novel�s age but which also lessens the power of the novel. Exchanges like this:\n\n�Professor,� said Captain Nemo, �my electricity is not everybody�s and that is all that you will permit me to say about it.�\n\n�I shall not insist, sir, and I shall be satisfied with being astonished by such a result. I have only one question, which, nonetheless, you will not answer if it is indiscreet. The elements which you use to produce this marvelous agent must be depleted quickly. Zinc, for example, how do you replace it, as you no longer have any communication with land?�\n\n�Your question will be answered,� replied the captain. �First I shall tell you that in the depths of the sea there exist zinc, iron, silver, and gold mines whose exploitation would certainly be practicable. But I have borrowed nothing from these earthly metals, for I wished to find the means of producing my electricity only in the sea itself.�\n\ncontain marvellous ideas, to be certain, but delivered in a stilted and stiff manner, which detracts from the reader�s enjoyment. This is, again, an inevitable part of the novel�s age, which is unfortunate, since what Verne wrote about was very impressive to his audience. Similarly, the speed of the Nautilus (20 miles per hour) and the sheer distance the Nautilus covers in the course of the novel (20,000 leagues or roughly 60,000 miles) are interesting to modern audiences who are jaded by the ease and speed of air flight.\n\nFinally, one thing not usually remembered about Nemo is that, much as he is a scientist and engineer, he is also a passionate artist. (This is, again, part of the Romantic genius). Nemo is a skilled and emotional organ player, to the point where he loses himself, �plunged in a musical ecstasy.� And as an artist he is concerned with the aesthetics of the Nautilus as much as its engines and technical aspects. The insides of the Nautilus are beautiful, from its silverware to the internal aesthetics of the ship.\n\nAlthough Verne was at pains to establish that the Nautilus was as close to possible as is possible, he could not rely on then-achievable science to power it. When Verne wrote Twenty Thousand Leagues, electricity was known about as a potential power source, but it was not used for home lighting until 1882. To ascribe what the Nautilus is capable of to electricity was an act of science fiction for Verne, but (ever careful, and I think knowing that even electricity could not explain the Nautilus) Verne establishes that his electricity is somewhat different from everybody else�s.\n\nThe Nautilus is long and cigar-shaped, armored. Its exterior can be electrified, as it is when the Papuans attack. In addition to the Nautilus, Nemo also has special diving suits with nine or ten hours� worth of stored air and special guns whose bullets are electric batteries.\n\nAs an aside, it should be noted that Verne, for decades, suffered from translators who were either incompetent, venal, malicious, or all three, with the result that much of his work, especially Leagues, was presented to the English-speaking public in horrible forms. Huge amounts of text was deleted or altered, dialogue was changed (especially anti-English comments, by--surprise, surprise--English translators), and the flow of the novel was butchered. Modern readers wishing to see what Verne truly meant to write should read the Emanuel J. Mickel The Complete Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, a new and full translation of the novel with an excellent introduction and good annotations.\n\naptain Nemo (II). Captain Nemo II first appeared in Bracebridge Hemyng's \"Dick Lightheart; or, the Scapegrace at Sea,\" which appeared in Young Men of Great Britain in 1873, and then the next year as The Scapegrace at Sea. (There is a very good account of the following, and the complex publication history of Captain Nemo II & Captain Vindex (see below), at the Prince and the Pauper site)\n\nDick Lightheart is a typical, and tiresome, square-jawed two-fisted self-righteous Victorian adventurer, a young man full of his own moral superiority and willing to shove it down everybody else's throats. (He's also a racist, which is quite typical of much of the young man's adventure fiction of the time) He is on the Indiana when they find the survivor of an encounter with a \"sea monster.\" The ship goes after it, but when they find it only bonehead Lightheart and his chums are willing to try to kill it; the rest of the crew has more sense than that. Sure enough, when they do try to harpoon it, the monster sinks the Indiana (how many deaths on your conscience now, Dick Lightheart?) and Lightheart and his boys are sent into the water, where they are rescued, after a time, by the sea monster, which turns out to be...a submarine.\n\nIs any of this sounding familiar yet?\n\nSure enough, Dick and his posse are brought into the submarine (which is called the Enigma) and made the guests/prisoners of its chief, Captain Nemo. Like the Verne character, he is a moody misanthrope, and as in the Verne novel, the Hemyng story features an underwater burial, an attempted escape to a cannibal-filled island, a visit to a giant pearl that only Nemo knows about, a trip through a submarine tunnel, and an attack by a giant squid.\n\nThe crew of the Enigma use special rifles to hunt and kill undersea creatures, and Hemyng's Captain Nemo is a Confederate veteran whose fiancée, convinced that he was dead, married someone else. For this \"Nemo\" (née Harold Duggan) swears vengeance, sinking ships and acting much as the Verne Nemo does.\n\nDick Lightheart and his chums eventually escape, thanks to the Enigma suffering from mechanical difficulties. Unfortunately for the reader, our escape is not so easy; we'll carry the memory of the ripoff of Verne with us for a long, long time. Shame on you, Bracebridge Hemyng! Shame!\n\nBiographical information on Hemyng can be found below, in the Jack Harkaway entry. For further information on Bracebridge's plagiarism, see the article \"Jules Verne, Bracebridge Hemyng, and Edward Stratemeyer: A Case of Nineteenth-Century Plagiarism\" at the Prince and the Pauper site.\n\naptain Malachi Sturgis. Captain Malachi Sturgis was created by J. Weldon Cobb and appeared in his \"A Wonder Worker; or, the Search for the Splendid City,\" which first appeared in Golden Hours from June 23 to August 25 1894. Information on Cobb is given in the Young Edison entry. Captain Sturgis is an American Naval officer who also happens to be a very gifted inventor. He takes a fancy to Rex Ralston, a working boy who is the target of a Byzantine and uninteresting disinheritance plot, and hires him to help build a flying machine. Sturgis is building the machine to discover a Lost City of the Aztecs that has reportedly survived for centuries, hidden somewhere in Sinaloa. The aircraft is roughly saucer-shaped and is propelled by a one-cylinder engine that powers propellers; the engine itself is fuelled by \"glyco-pyrelium,\" a super-explosive. The saucer crashes, injuring Rex, and the group is forced to head into Sinaloa on the ground, in Sturgis' land-rover, which is armored, powered by electricity, and shaped like a small building. They forge on, passing by and over thugs, crooks, swindlers, and bad Americans and Mexicans, only to find that the hidden city doesn't exist. The rest of the plot is inconsequential, as is \"A Wonder Worker\" itself.\n\naptain Vindex. Captain Vindex first appeared in \"The Wizard of the Deep; or, the Search for the Million Dollar Pearl\" (1895) by \"Theodore Edison,\" which was a pseudonym for Edward Stratemeyer. Stratemeyer (1862-1930) is one of the most widely-read authors of all time, although his name may not be recognizable to many. He wrote widely, but his main claim to fame is the Stratemeyer Syndicate, which he founded in 1904 to turn his story ideas into full-fledged novels. Through the Syndicate Stratemeyer created the Bobbsey Twins, the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and Tom Swift. Although there is some doubt as to whether Stratemeyer himself was responsible for \"The Wizard of the Deep\" (1895)--one critic attributes it to \"Roy Rockwood,\" a Stratemeyer pseudonym, but rejects that it was Stratemeyer's work--he owned the rights to the story and is at least partially responsible for the plagiarism.\n\nAs with Captain Nemo II (see his entry above), Captain Vindex is a plagiarism from Jules Verne. (For a very well-done description of this theft, and Hemyng's theft from Verne, read the article \"Jules Verne, Bracebridge Hemyng, and Edward Stratemeyer: A Case of Nineteenth-Century Plagiarism\" at the Prince and the Pauper site) While Stratemeyer (or whoever wrote \"Wizard of the Deep\") may not have read Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, \"The Wizard of the Deep\" is an overt swipe from \"Dick Lightheart at Sea.\"\n\nIn \"The Wizard of the Deep\" the first 38 pages are an unacknowledged reprint of \"The Schoolboy Cadets; or, Fun and Mystery at Washington Hall,\" (1896), a story Stratemeyer had written earlier. After that, however, the schoolboy cadets--Mont Folsom, Carl Barnaby, and John \"Stump\" Stumpton--are taken on-board a ship (the Comet) that is sunk by a submarine (the Searcher) that is piloted by a mad, misanthropic Captain (Captain Vindex).\n\n\"The Wizard of the Deep\" differs in a few ways from \"Dick Lightheart;\" the story is thinned down, Vindex's background is not explained, although he is stated to be an American, and Vindex's crew are Africans. After the Searcher emerges from the tunnel into the Mediterranean Sea, the trio of \"heroes\" escape from the submarine, which then explodes off the coast of Cyprus while trying to recapture them, killing (presumably) everyone on-board, including Vindex.\n\nHemyng's story, involving Captain Nemo II is not a word-for-word plagiarism of Verne, copying the essential adventure story elements; Stratemeyer's story is a direct rip-off, with only the names being changed. Stratemeyer was not the first to steal from Hemyng--Frank Leslie and then Frank Tousey both stole it. But Stratemeyer's theft is the most blatant and inexcusable.\n\naresco, Dr. Dr. Caresco was created by André Couvreur and appeared in Le Mal Nécessaire (The Necessary Evil, 1899) and Caresco Surhomme (1904). Couvreur (1863-1944) was a French doctor and author who wrote a number of fantastic/science fictional books. I'm unfortunately restricted from accessing his other books, and there's very little critical work on him; what follows is taken mostly from Jean-Marc Lofficier's outstanding French Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror and Pulp Fiction.\n\nDr. Caresco was the one of the first modern mad scientists, anticipating Dr. Cornelius Kramm as well as a number of other characters not only in French genre fiction but in international genre fiction. I unfortunately can't tell you what happens in Le Mal Nécessaire, but Caresco Surhomme I do have a little information on. Caresco rules the island of Eucrasia, an island whose inhabitants are changed by surgery to better do their jobs; the captain of the plane which brings \"guests\" to Eucrasia is a limbless trunk with telescopic vision--the better to help him fly, you see. The island itself is in the shape of a human body. The natives of Eucrasia are addicted to various sensual pleasures, but submit (for the most part) to Dr. Caresco's rule, for fear that he will castrate them or worse.\n\nCaresco is brilliant as well as mad. Making use of Omnium, a mysterious and unexplained power source, Caresco creates scientific prodigies: a machine capable of stripping the years from a person and reversing the aging process, a very fast underground train system, food pills, Omnium-powered diving suits, and so on. But Caresco is mad as well as brilliant, given to things like collecting the spleens of all those he operates on, and eventually he dies, Eucrasia being blown up by a volcano.\n\narmichael, Nasmyth. Nasmyth Carmichael was created by John Munro and appeared in A Trip to Venus (1897). Munro was a British engineer and professor of mechanical engineering at Bristol who wrote two short stories, one of which was later incorporated into A Trip to Venus. Carmichael is a maverick American physicist and inventor who discovers an ambiguously-described \"new force\" (Carmichael refuses to describe how or where he discovered it) which is capable of providing almost unlimited energy. Naturally, he decides to travel into space. The Vernean method of shooting a ship out of a giant cannon is rejected as being insufficient for his needs--not enough muzzle velocity. So he designs a ship similar to a submarine, although larger, heavier, and boxier, and takes it into the solar system, along with his beautiful daughter Miss Carmichael (no first name for father or daughter is ever provided), Professor Gazen, an astronomer, and the nameless narrator. They go to Venus, which they discover has an atmosphere, vegetation, seas and people surprisingly similar to Earth; the Venutians are \"a fine race, tall, handsome, and of white complexion\" (that last somehow being important). They are peaceful, serene, and strict vegetarians, with a simply-learned language and an advanced culture, and they live on an idyllic planet on which disease, pain, crime and sin are virtually unknown, and the average age is 100-150. The narrator falls in love with Alumion, the most beautiful of the Venutians and their priestess, and the pair marry, but Gazen and the others carry him off, and they move on to Mercury, which also has a breathable atmosphere, but despite the presence of predatory animals, including a creature similar to a dragon, there is no intelligent life. At the end of the book the group has returned to Earth, with the narrator swearing to go back to Venus and live with his Alumion. A Trip to Venus isn't particularly notable or memorable for its literary qualities, but it does contain some discussion of multistage rockets, space stations, the use of parachutes in planetary landings, and multigeneration space travel, although none of these concepts are used in the plot itself.\n\narmilla. Carmilla was created by J. Sheridan Le Fanu and appeared in �Carmilla,� which first appeared in The Dark Blue (Dec 1871 to March 1872) and then was included in Le Fanu�s In A Glass Darkly (1872) collection. Le Fanu (1814-1873) was a noted Irish poet and author of short horror stories; he wrote widely, but it is \"Carmilla,� along with �Green Tea� (see the Dr. Hesselius entry) for which he is best known.\n\n�Carmilla� is set in Styria, an Austrian province along the Hungarian border. The story's narrator, Laura, lives there in a castle with her father and a few servants. When Laura is only six years old she has a terrifying experience; one night a woman appears in her bedroom and proceeds to slip under the covers with Laura and begins caressing her. Laura falls asleep and then is awakened �by a sensation as if two needles ran into my breast very deep at the same moment.� Laura screams, and the woman slips under the bed, but when the room is searched she is nowhere to be found. The nurses and maids believe Laura, however, because the space in the bed where the woman lay is still warm. Years pass and the woman does not reappear, but Laura does not forget about her and does not forget what she looked like. One day when Laura is nineteen her father tells her about the death of the daughter of her father�s friend General Spielsdorf. General Spielsdorf is vague about the details, but it is clear there was something untoward about it. That night there is a carriage accident near the castle, and one of the passengers, a young woman named Carmilla, is deemed by her mother to be too ill to continue on the trip. Laura�s father agrees, somewhat regretting his impulsiveness.\n\nLaura instantly recognizes Carmilla as the woman who preyed on her as a child, but as Carmilla immediately tells Laura about a strange dream she had eleven years before in which similar events occurred, Laura�s concerns are dissuaded. Carmilla is strange and will not discuss her past, but she is not unfriendly, and very passionate about Laura, and the two quickly become close friends, with Carmilla very snuggly and kissy and caressing on Laura. They are close for a while, but strange events begin to occur. Some old family portraits are being cleaned, and when the 1698 portrait of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein is revealed, everyone notices that Carmilla is a dead ringer (my choice of words here is quite deliberate) for the Countess. (Carmilla�s response is that she, like Laura, is descended from the Karnsteins, which strikes those listening as at least plausible�which, I admit, it struck me as being, too). Carmilla�s health and mood fluctuate in strange ways. A series of unpleasant and possibly unnatural deaths occurs among the peasants in the countryside around Laura�s castle. And, finally, Laura�s health declines, as she suffers nocturnal attacks from something which is sometimes a cat and sometimes shaped like a woman. These attacks leave Laura increasingly languorous and dreamy and pale and weak.\n\nThen General Spielsdorf arrives. (Remember him?) He tells Laura and her father about the wasting illness of his ward, who he thought of as his daughter, and how this illness, coincided with the entrance into his life and that of his daughter of a mysterious young woman named Millarca. The General�s ward claimed the illness came from nocturnal attacks on her by a specter which sometimes looked like Millarca and sometimes a beast. A doctor the General consulted was certain that his ward�s condition was due to a vampire, and the General waited in the dying girl�s room and caught the vampire, who was Millarca, about to feed on the girl. The General tried to kill her but she was too quick for him and escaped, and the General�s ward died shortly thereafter.\n\nThe General has come to the castle of Laura�s father because the grave of the vampire who is descended from the Karnsteins, is nearby. They go to the ruined chapel of the Karnsteins and see Carmilla herself entering it. The General recognizes her as his Millarca and attacks her, but she overpowers him and she escapes from him again. But the General, Laura, Laura�s father, and the General�s old friend Baron Vordenburg, go to the Chapel of the Karnsteins and open up the grave of the Countess Mircalla. Carmilla is inside, floating in seven inches of blood. Carmilla is staked, her head is cut off, her body burned, and the ashes are thrown into a river, and so Carmilla dies.\n\n�Carmilla� has to be looked at in two ways: in its innate quality and in its literary/historical significance. Taking the former first--it�s a very entertaining story. Le Fanu was of course a very talented and skillful writer of horror stories; one only has to read �Green Tea� or the superbly disturbing �Schalken the Painter� (see the Minheer Vanderhausen entry for more on that gem) to recognize that. The story is very readable, almost compellingly so, and the mystery of what Carmilla is and how everything will be resolved holds up well even when you know Carmilla�s secret and even the end of the story. Le Fanu doesn�t put in the elisions that made �Schalken the Painter� so marvelously unsettling; �Carmilla� is in the form of a more traditional folktale-like story, with the moral status quo being asserted by story�s end through the saving of the innocent (Laura) and the destruction of the monster (Carmilla). But Le Fanu does a fine job of scene setting, in the picturesque descriptions of the Styrian environment and in the dreamlike atmosphere in which Carmilla attacks Laura. Le Fanu�s vampires are distinctive (see below for more on that). Le Fanu also doesn�t explore the psychological aspects of Laura�s victimization the way he did in �Green Tea� with Mr. Jennings, but his characterization is generally solid in �Carmilla.�\n\nFinally, the erotic atmosphere of the story is quite something. The lesbianism in �Carmilla� is too blatant to be a subtext; Le Fanu�s audience was shocked by how relatively explicit he was in making women, not men, the locus of Carmilla�s desires. The lesbianism of the story is not located in Carmilla�s predilection for biting her victim�s breasts, but rather in her attraction to women, in her kisses and caresses on them, in her holding their hands and cuddling with them and seeming to fall genuinely in love with them and acting like many young Victorian women did, when they formed the passionate �romantic friendships.� That, and not the biting of the breasts, is what was shocking to Le Fanu�s audience�his taking a somewhat common piece of real life behavior and overtly sexualizing it. He does so strongly, so that �Carmilla� is quite sexually charged at times.\n\n�Carmilla� was the first vampire story with a lesbian theme. �Carmilla� is significant as a story on several levels. It wasn�t the first vampire story to emphasize the sexual aspects of the vampire�s feeding; that would be the toothsome Clarimonde (who was also the first modern female vampire). But �Carmilla� was the best written of the English language vampire stories of the 19th century (yes, even better than Dracula, but not as good as Clarimonde�but Clarimonde was written in French, not English). Carmilla was also very influential on Dracula, who of course set the mold for vampires for decades afterwards. Among the things Bram Stoker took from Carmilla was the Eastern European setting, an undead Countess (from �Dracula�s Guest,� the deleted first chapter of Dracula), the figure of the knowledgeable and knowing vampire hunter (Van Helsing seems to have been largely based on Dr. Hesselius), and many of Carmilla�s powers, including her superhuman strength, her ability to change shape, and her sleeping in a coffin.\n\nCarmilla is interestingly different as a vampire, or at least will be to those unfamiliar with pre-Dracula vampires. She has superhuman strength, and can change her shape into that of a cat, just like Dracula. Like the fictional Dracula (but unlike the movie Dracula and succeeding vampires) she can move about during the day and is killed by decapitation, not just by the stake through the heart. Unlike Dracula her powers do not seem to be limited by daylight. She can feed on a victim without turning them into a vampire. Her teeth are long and needle-like, not short and pointed. She does not need to constantly feed. She has none of the pallor of later vampires; she can leave her grave without displacing the dirt above it; and she is limited to arrangements of her name, from Millarca to Mircalla to Carmilla. As a person she is in some ways quite Victorian, engaging in a �romantic friendship� with Laura. Carmilla is beautiful, of course. She�s languid in motion but not in speech or thought. She varies in mood, sometimes being quite chatty and sometimes assuming quite melancholy expressions. She is proud and quite aware of her bloodline. And she is very, very passionate, about Laura and about life itself (�there is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature�).\n\n�Carmilla� is a very entertaining and historically important and influential story, and if it doesn�t reach the sublime heights of �Schalken the Painter� it is still far, far above average.\n\nCarmilla\n\nThe e-text of the story.\n\narne, Simon. Guy Boothby (1867-1905), an Australian by birth but an Englishman by adoption, was a prolific writer, with more than 50 titles to his name. Two of his other characters included here are Pharos the Egyptian and Dr. Nikola. Still another was Simon Carne. Those who've read Carne's adventures know that he's a far more interesting, clever, and resourceful character than the smug and insufferable A.J. Raffles; interestingly enough, Carne's first appearance, \"A Prince of Swindlers,\" was in Pearson's Magazine in 1897, predating Raffles by two years' time and arousing suspicions as to who exactly copied who. But Carne is forgotten, despite his superiority, and that of Boothby's work, to Raffles and Hornung's.\n\nThat's a literary battle long-lost, though, and the matter at hand is Simon Carne. Carne is a \"gentleman burglar,\" suave, impeccably dressed, eternally unruffled, and capable of burgling and stealing anything from anybody. If you're familiar with Raffles, think of him, only better in every way (Carne's butler, Belton, is a vast improvement over the unspeakable, craven Bunny). If not...Carne is known, respected, and liked in British High Society, famous as a bon vivant and gentleman. What only a scant handful of people know is that Carne is also a second-story man--a thief and burglar. He's also a good disguise man, and successfully carries out the deception of posing as the brilliant detective Klimo while using his guise as a cover for a crime. While charmingly amoral in many ways, Carne is still a patriot, and has on occasion performed services for the Crown. His only collection was The Viceroy's Protege; or, A Prince of Swindlers (1903).\n\narpi, Medea da. Medea da Carpi was created by �Vernon Lee� and appeared in �Amour Dure: Passage from the Diary of Spiridion Trepka� (Hauntings, 1890). �Vernon Lee� was the pseudonym of Violet Paget (1865-1935), a brilliant writer of supernatural fiction. She may not be well known, but among the cognoscenti hers is a name to conjure with. �Amour Dure� is a classic, recently named by Michael Dirda of the Washington Post as his favorite uncanny story of them all. Having just finished it for the first time, I can certainly see why it is so highly ranked.\n\nSpiridion Trepka is a Polish scholar sent to Urbania, in Italy, to write a history of the city. He finds it dull, though scenic, and the natives tedious, and he is repelled by the women, although his only �friend� (who he doesn�t really like), the son of the Vice-Prefect, urges a love affair on him. (Spiridion is only 24, and what 24 year old should be without a love affair?) His visions of Italy as it was are crushed by its current fallen state. In fact, the only thing that really holds his interest is the story of Medea da Carpi, the Duchess of Stimigliano Orsini and then the wife of Duke Guidalfonso II or Urbania. From 1568 to 1582, starting as a 12 year old and then dying as a twenty seven year old, she used lovers and husband to gain power and then had them murdered, or did the killing herself, to rid herself of them. She was beautiful and manipulative and so frightening that Duke Robert, the priest who finally defeated her, had her strangled by two infanticides and refused to allow her to be shriven before she died, for fear that she would seduce the priest who would grant her penitence. Duke Robert was so afraid of her, in fact, that after he died he had an image of his soul attached to his statue so that the spirit of Medea could not haunt him and he could sleep peacefully until Judgment Day. Spiridion becomes very interested in Medea, looking for portraits of her and then reading letters by her, and his interest becomes fascination and then his fascination becomes an obsession. He begins to see her life from her point of view, and sympathetically, and he begins to sing songs to her. And then he begins to see her, first in his home, in a mirror, standing behind him (it turned out to be a painting of her on the opposite wall, a painting he could not recall seeing before), then in person. He receives a note, you see, telling him to meet �a person who knows the interest you bear her� in a church, and he goes and sees her, but she slips away before he can speak to her. He discovers that the church has been abandoned for months, but he doesn�t care, and he keeps returning to the church, and sees her more frequently, until finally he receives a letter from her, telling him to destroy the statue of Duke Robert, and when he does that, �that night she whom thou lovest will come to reward thy fidelity.� Spiridion destroys the statue, despite the opposition of the ghosts of Medea�s former lovers, and then waits for Medea to arrive. The end note to the story mentions that his body has been found; he died of a stab wound to the heart, just as some of Medea�s former lovers had.\n\n�Amour Dure� is really quite good. The reader knows what Spiridion�s fate is going to be, but Paget sketches his descent into obsession so skillfully that it doesn�t seem predictable, but rather logical and inevitable. There�s a psychological plausibility to Spiridion�s fall that is often missing from similar stories. And Paget combines an intimate knowledge of Italian history�she was a noted cultural historian of Italy, her adopted country�with descriptions pitched toward sight, sound, smell and touch, so that �Amour Dure� comes off as a very tactile and even lushly described story. It�s compelling reading, with a quite convincing narrative voice and striking images, and the story of Medea, though fictional, reads as if it was taken straight from a story of the Borgias.\n\nMedea da Carpi is one of the immortal femmes fatale. Her beauty is such that she can seemingly seduce any male, physically and/or emotionally, and her heart is a cold, adamantine thing. By age 23 she was a widow thrice over, two husbands dying from stab wounds to the heart and the third perishing suddenly and under mysterious circumstances, with Medea forbidding all access to the chamber in which his body lay. Even after she was defeated by Duke Robert and imprisoned her power over men did not diminish, and she convinced two other men to try to kill Duke Robert. Her description is summed up by Spiridion thusly:\n\nA curious, at first rather conventional, artificial-looking sort of beauty, voluptuous yet cold, which, the more it is contemplated, the more it troubles and haunts the mind. Round the lady�s neck is a gold chain with little gold lozenges at intervals, on which is engraved the posy or pun...�Amour Dure�Dure Amour�...love that lasts, cruel love�yes indeed, when one thinks of the fidelity and fate of her lovers.\n\nIn life she may not have been supernatural, but after death she was, between her haunting and possession of Spiridion and the reaction when he destroys Duke Robert�s image, thus robbing his soul of its protection from Medea�s wrath: �the moon was suddenly veiled; a great wind arose, howling down the square; it seemed to me that the earth shook.�\n\n�Amour Dure� is a story that well-deserves the title of �classic� and belongs on any short list of the best horror stories of the 19th century.\n\narter, Nick. On this site I used to have an extensive amount of information on Nick Carter. No, not the Backstreet Boy, nor the \"Killmaster\" whose published adventures have polluted the shelves of bookstores for a generation. The Nick Carter I wrote/write about is the original Nick Carter, the one true Nick Carter, was created in 1886 by Ormond G. Smith and John Russell Coryell and went on to be the most published detective character in American literature (and second only to Dixon Hawke in total overall appearances).\n\nHowever, this page is rather long and takes a while--too long--to download. And I keep finding new material to add to the Nick Carter entry. So I've moved the information from here to a new page, my Nick Carter Page. I've got all the original information from this entry on that page as well as a number of images. So why not go there and take a look?\n\navor, Professor. Professor Cavor was created by H.G. Wells and appeared in The First Men in the Moon, which first appeared simultaneously in Cosmopolitan magazine in New York (November 1900-June 1901) and The Strand in London (November 1900-August 1901) before being published as a novel in 1901. Wells wrote a novel about some Martians and another novel about a Doctor named \"Moreau,\" but I don't really know that much about him.\n\nThe First Men in the Moon is about the first trip to the moon. The narrator, Mr. Bedford, is a bit of a scoundrel, a failed businessman who goes to Lympne, on the Channel, to write a play and, he thinks, get rich quickly. There he meets the eccentric scientist Professor Cavor, and after an initially brusque meeting (Bedford, easily annoyed, vents his spleen at Cavor for the latter's eccentricities) the two warm to each other and become friends. Cavor tells Bedford about his plans to discover a substance which will be \"opaque...to all forms of radiant energy,\" meaning that it will cancel out gravity itself. Cavor experiments, and eventually discovers a metallic alloy which when combined with helium and allowed to cool does just that. Cavor is exultant, but it is Bedford who sees the monetary possibilities for the new element \"cavorite.\" The next step, for Cavor, is to go to the moon in a sphere covered in cavorite, and somewhat reluctantly Bedford accompanies him. The trip to the moon is uneventful, but once there they discover that the moon has a very strange, alien landscape, with strange, fast-growing and fast-dying plants, as well as very strange aliens. Bedford and Cavor are temporarily taken prisoner by the \"Selenites\" or \"Mooneys,\" but after being marched beneath the moon's surface and then through a part of the Selenite's underground world they fight their way free. They flee, pursued by the Selenites, and do some exploring before making their way to the moon's surface. They split up, trying to find their ship (which they'd earlier lost), and Bedford finds it. He returns to look for Cavor but finds evidence that the Selenites had taken him. Bedford then makes it back to the ship and pilots it home, undergoing an out-of-body experience on the way. He lands the ship in the waters off the coast of England, but thanks to the carelessness of a child the sphere is propelled back into space, leaving Bedford with only the gold he took from the moon. Some months later an Italian astronomer begins receiving signals from Cavor, who had been captured but not killed by the Selenites. Over the space of several weeks Cavor transmits 16 messages, describing the Selenites' segmented, insect-like civilization and his meeting with the Selenites' leader, the Grand Lunar, in which the Grand Lunar quizzes Cavor about humanity and human civilization. The last message from Cavor is broken up, but implies that the Grand Lunar has revealed himself to be malign after all.\n\nThe First Men in the Moon is seen as the last of Wells' great \"scientific romances,\" but in my view it is a much lesser work compared to War of the Worlds and Island of Dr. Moreau. Which is not to say it's bad, because it's not. It's rather entertaining, and not without positive qualities. But the satire of First Men is lighter in tone and less pointed than the messages of WotW and Moreau, and the themes are dealt with less seriously. First Men is a satire, to be certain, of imperialism and capitalism; Bedford comes off as an awful ass, greedy, exploitive, ignorant and heartless, and Cavor's justifications for human vilenesses like war are self-evidently absurd. But Bedford and Cavor are straw men for Wells; he sets them up to be ridiculous and then knocks them down. It makes for decent but not particularly sharp satire.\n\nEven lesser Wells, though, is entertaining. First Men is very fast-moving, with a lot of light humor absent from WotW and Moreau. The science is, if not plausible, at least respectable. Wells took some pains to make sure that First Men was not scientifically implausible, and so First Men is much closer to real (for the most part) than WotW or Moreau are. Things like zero-gravity space flight and the low gravity on the moon are used, and without the overt pedantry of Jules Verne. The moon is suitably strange, and the Selenites are distinctly alien in appearance and personality without being at all absurd. The physical description of the moon and of the Selenites' caverns are well done. And the comedy of Bedford and Cavor, who as explorers and conquerors of the moon lose their ship, get hepped up on moon mushrooms, leap about carelessly, act in a quarrelsome and disagreeable manner to each other, and even use broken English on the Selenites (\"'Me look 'im,' he said, \"me think 'im very much. Yes\") is amusing.\n\nCavor himself is stereotypical absent-minded professor. He gets so lost in thought as he walks about that he's unaware he's making strange noises or performing the same movements day after day. He is so wrapped up in his experimental and scientific pursuits that the idea of profiting from his discoveries never occurs to him. He values knowledge so highly that he is in denial about the Selenites and the Grand Lunar until the end of the novel, and justifies many of their more distasteful and dystopian habits. In person, well: \"He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky quality in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and stockings.\" But as a scientist he's brilliant, discovering cavorite and successfully creating and piloting a ship to the moon.\n\nThe First Men in the Moon isn't a classic, but it's a more than agreeable way to pass a few hours.\n\nayley, Lois Lois Cayley is the enormously entertaining creation of Grant Allen, who you can read more about in the Colonel Clay (see below) entry. Cayley first appeared in a series of stories in Strand Magazine which were later collected in Miss Cayley's Adventures (1898). Cayley is Girton girl who, being virtually penniless after graduation, decides to wander off into London and see what adventures life will bring her. She overhears a Cantankerous Old Lady complaining about the maid service she's gotten, and the dilemma she's facing on her upcoming trip to the Continent (always bad news, that; Europe is full of foreigners). Cayley instantly volunteers herself for the role, and after facing the C.O.L. down, and discovering that she was friends with Cayley's father, wins the job. Shortly thereafter she saves the C.O.L.'s jewels from being stolen by an untrustworthy foreigner (something of a tautology, that, eh wot?), winning her a recommendation that gets her further jobs as a governess and bringing her into further adventures and eventually marriage.\n\nWhat's so charming about Cayley is the style with which Allen has written her, and the stories she appears in. Allen is funny; not smile-quietly-to-yourself funny, but genuinely witty and epigrammatical, with some legitimately laugh-out-loud moments. His humor is wry and entertaining, and Cayley is a capable, smart, witty (that word again) young women whose adventures I'd gladly read more of.\n\nMiss Cayley's Adventures\n\nE-texts! Who'd'a thunk it? Once again, we have the wonderful folks at Gaslight to thank for it.\n\nNew Women - New Crimes\n\nAn excellent essay (indeed, one would expect no less) by Chris Willis on \"Grant Allen's Detectives-Heroines.\" (I stole the image at the right of Lois Cayley from her site)\n\nentenarian. The Centenarian was created by Honoré de Balzac and appeared in in Le Centenaire, ou les Deux Beringheld (The Centenarian, or the Two Beringhelds, 1822). Balzac (1799-1850) you should already know about: one of the greatest of French writers of the 19th or any other century as well as a great character. Allan H. Pasco, in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, puts it well:\n\nHad Balzac been a less masterful novelist, the disreputably profligate fraud in him might have overwhelmed his artistry. Still, the other Balzac, the artist, is tainted by his well-earned reputation for what has been called artistic license or dishonesty. And though, like a cowbird, he left at least one and possibly three children in the nests of others, he took away with him knowledge, insights, images and stories that later took their places in La Comédie humaine (1842-1846, 1848, 1855; translated as La Comédie humaine [The Human Comedy], 1895-1900). Balzac's life regularly fertilized his fiction; however, his literary reputation would benefit if he lacked a biography. The view of his masterpiece, La Comédie humaine, has been seriously undermined by his irresponsibility, his casual attitude toward debts and contracts, his crass arrivisme, his naiveté about his purchases and investments, and perhaps even by his ridiculous appearance. On the one hand, he was a born sucker, the answer to many an antique dealer's dreams, the solution to some shaky business deals. On the other he was the nemesis of mistresses and relatives with money. He was indiscriminate in those he exploited. His first mistress, Mme Laure de Berny, loved him tenderly; his mother preferred her adulterous offspring to him; and Balzac impoverished the first and significantly reduced the fortune of the other. At his death he left his wife of five months with mountains of debts. The thought of what he could have done with credit cards defies the imagination.\n\nThe Centenarian is set in the Napoleonic era (\"181...\") and is about General Tullius Beringheld, a French general of an ancient and noble family. Tullius, serving in Napoleon's Army, encounters a strange old man whose knowledge of healing is unmatched but who also kills a young girl. Tullius investigates further and hears stories about the old man, all of which involve him healing the sick but killing others. Tullius eventually discovers that the old man, the Centenarian, is a relative\n\n(the two resemble each other), a four-hundred-year old Count of the Beringheld-Sculdans branch of the family who through arcane arts, learned from the Rosicrucians, discovered the secret of eternal life. The key, unfortunately, is to drain the life essence from another. While Tullius is discovering this the Centenarian is befriending Marianne, Tullius' lady love. The Centenarian is about to drain her life in his headquarters beneath the Louvre when she is rescued by Tullius and his\n\nmen, who then attack the Centenarian. But later, when the Centenarian's body is sought after, it is not found....\n\nThe Centenarian is one of Balzac's apprentice works and has none of his commitment to be the \"secretary of the age,\" to show society as a whole. This is one of his melodramatic, plot-driven novels, with all the over-writing that entails. Too, it's largely a late Gothic, and so has all the trademarks/cliches of the late Gothics: moonlit wanderings, a story told by a witch, a portrait with moving eyes, catacombs, ruins, degenerate aristocracy, a scheming priest, and a Wandering Jew figure in\n\nthe Centenarian. So the novel is entertaining enough but hardly good.The roman-à-tiroirs (linked stories-within-the-story) structure, used in Melmoth the Wanderer and The Necromancer (see the Volkert entry) among other places, tells the stories Balzac wants to tell, but at the cost of interrupting the narrative momentum. It's enjoyable, The Centenarian, but more of historical than literary value.\n\nThe Centarian himself is Count Maxime Beringheld-Sculdans. The Beringhelds, whose ancestral castle is in the Alps, are an ancient family but are prey to \"moral decadence.\" The Sculdans are a cadet branch of the Beringhelds founded by the first Count Maxime. The Centenarian is his son, the second Count Maxime. He was born in 1470 and as a young man devoted himself to the sciences. He \"lived in close contact with all the famous scientists of his time, and in the course of his life visited India and China; he participated in the discovery of the New World, circumnavigated the globe, and lived from 1470 until 1572, when he disappeared, the very day of the Saint-Bartholomew-Day Massacre.\" At some point during his life he befriended the second-to-last Rosicrucian and won from him the secret of the elixir of life. (The Centenarian describes himself as \"the last Rosicrucian\"). The Centenarian, thinking carefully about his new powers (for the elixir grants him many), uses his immortality to save the lives of great men. He wanders the Earth righting wrongs, saving the good and killing the wicked, and manipulating kings and countries. Napoleon himself hints that it was the Centarian who put him in power. The Centenarian is known and respected around the world, not just in France. In his travels he searches out the old and knowledgeable of every country, speaking to them in their languages, gathering rare plants and simples from them as well as animal and vegetable curiosities. In the Indian Himalayas there are monks who worship him.\n\nThe Centarian's purpose is not just to travel and put his hand-picked rulers in power, however. His two main goals are to heal the sick and dying and to protect the Beringhelds. The Beringheld family has a legend that the Centenarian visited them one last time before he disappeared in 1572 and that he prophesied that his \"race\" would only perish when a \"mountain\" falls on the Beringhelds on a \"plain.\" (A nice Macbeth homage, but one that surprisingly doesn't come to pass). Since that time he is reputed to have used his magic powers to protect the Beringhelds, and that any time misfortune threatens a member of the Beringheld family, his \"spirit\" will appear to protect them.\n\nThis legend is true. The enemies of the Beringhelds are kidnaped by the Centenarian and drained of life. One such was \"the best swordsman of his day,\" due to fight a duel with one of the Counts, but on the morning of the duel the man was nowhere to be found. And when Tullius' life is in danger, as it is in Egypt, by the Pyramids, when he and his men are surrounded by Mamelukes, the Centenarian appears, healing the wounds of all 800 of Tullius' men as well as Tullius himself.\n\nThe Centenarian looks like a walking corpse. His \"huge hoary head\" reeks of the tomb, and there is \"no skin at all\" on his dull, gray skull. He is very tall, balding with white hair on the back of his head, and his body and carriage hint at \"extreme decrepitude.\" He has bony arms out of proportion with his barrel chest, massive legs, and broad shoulders; the arms are \"huge bones covered only with the barest layer of flesh.\" He has no belly at all. He has black, sunken eyesockets, \"from deep within them a mere residue of light, a spark of pure flame, animated two dark eyes which slowly moved about in sockets too big for them.\" In all other parts of the eyes \"the pulse of life had vanished completely.\" After the Centenarian has fed off of a living being, the flames of his eyes are bright; when he is wearied, they are dim. Likewise, when he has fed he moves confidently and powerfully, but at other times he walks very slowly, with a \"stiff and solemn\" gait. Even when he hasn't fed,\n\nhowever, he is powerful. He can survive hanging, he has superhuman strength, and he can perform mystic movements over the sick and \"draw forth\" their illnesses. Usually he uses various \"healing balms\" and \"elixirs\" to cure the sick, but at other times he uses his personal power. He claims that \"the world of spirits is at my beck and call.\" His gaze can terrify, paralyze, or kill, he has a powerful animal magnetism, he can read minds when he chooses, and he can teleport himself or others\n\nwithout moving. He has a magic lantern which allows him to spy on others from great distances and he can lift great weights with the power of his mind. And along with his healing balms he has other alchemical arts, including a white powder which he uses to disintegrate the evidence of his victims.\n\nThe Centenarian's headquarters are in the crypts beneath the Louvre; his quarters there are lushly accoutered with all manner of historical curiosity, including pieces of wood from Joan of Arc's stake, the last stone of the Bastille, Cromwell's Bible, Christopher Columbus' map, Cardinal Richelieu's pen, and Pope Sixtus the Fifth's ring. In his headquarters he keeps a giant bronze bell which he uses to suck the life out of his victims. By stealing their \"vital fluids\" he regains his strength. He \"eats no earthly fare;\" it is only the life force of others which sustains him.\n\nOn the whole the Centenarian's not a bad guy, for a vampire. He lives up to his end of the bargains he strikes; he will heal the sick if he is provided with a live body to feed on. If the family members of those he heals do not give him a live body, then they must give up themselves to him. The Centenarian always succeeds in healing those men and women. He is not happy about being a vampire, and in fact is rather sad and weary about his state, but he does what he has to to live. And he is very dedicated to protecting his family. Yes, he preys on the innocent, but don't we all have minor peccadillos?\n\nharity Joe. Joe was created by George Emmett, one of the more prolific authors of penny dreadfuls and boys' adventure fiction. Charity Joe appeared in Charity Joe, or From street boy to Lord Mayor, a 22-part serial published in 1870. Charity Joe is part of the British rags-to-riches tradition, specifically that which shows a penniless street urching clawing his way to the top--or, more realistically, getting a decent job that would allow him (never her) to live in something approaching a middle class lifestyle. Ragged Dick (see below) is one of the best-drawn examples of this, with a fairly realistic conclusion. Charity Joe takes a different tack, doing away with the boring (to its intended audience) day-to-day life on the streets and instead providing a large dose of sensationalism.\n\nCharity Joe does not remember his father, and his mother died when he was very young. Since then he has been living on the street, running with a pack of street arabs. He's nicknamed \"Charity Joe\" because he refuses to accept charity from anyone; the rest of his gang have nicknames like \"Turkey Jack,\" \"Gobbling Frank,\" and \"Sam Sneaky,\" all based on their personalities and characteristics. Joe, despite his poverty, is a moral and upright character (think Horatio Alger's creations), a smudge-faced saint who vows to earn his way no matter what. He has faith (which he repeats--many times) that hard work and good character will help him overcome his poor situation.\n\nNow, in a more intellectually and morally honest work, the possibility of failure and a lifetime of poverty, despair, hunger and crime might be admitted. Indeed, the life of the Victorian street arabs was almost unbelievably grim, even tragic, with tens of thousands of potentially useful lives wasted because of a merciless social and economic system. But Charity Joe takes place in the world of popular Victorian fiction, where realism is a secondary priority to entertainment; the reading public, poor children and teenagers for the most part, did not want to read about the sad realities of their own lives. They wanted sensation and a happy ending, or at least one that confirmed their morals and biases.\n\nWhich is why Charity Joe succeeds so spectacularly. One of his gang dies of consumption; another, \"Slim Jim,\" drowns when he goes into the sewers during a storm and is caught and dragged under by a fast-flowing current. Charity Joe escapes the streets unharmed. The lure of crime is ever-present, and the rest of the gang eventually succumbs to it, running errands and performing burglaries for a Fagin-like character named Cold Johnson. Charity Joe, moral to the end, refuses, although this strains his friendships with the rest of the gang and alienates him from them. Interaction with women and the upper class is limited for the rest of the gang, although there is a hint of the others taking up with prostitutes their own age. (At least, it was only a hint to me, but I think that the contemporary audience would have snapped to it much more quickly than I and would have found it much more obvious than I did) Charity Joe saves Eleanor Whittingham from a mugging (and perhaps worse), fighting off six \"Chinamen\" who drag Eleanor into an alleyway. Eleanor and Charity Joe strike up a friendship which eventually becomes a marriage. (Oops, there I go, spoiling the ending of the book for you)\n\nAnd, naturally, Charity Joe finds that his hard work is rewarded. He begins by selling rags, metal, clothes, and anything he can scavenge from the street or junkpiles or, most often, from the tunnels and sewers beneath London. (There's an exciting scene where Charity Joe is almost swept out to sea, in the same storm that kills Slim Jim) Joe scrimps and saves the money he makes and then uses it to strike a deal with a fruit merchant, and so begins selling fresh fruit and apples. It's at this point that Charity Joe saves Eleanor, and she begins buying from him and having her friends and family do the same. This helps him make enough money to buy some clothes and take some lessons on reading and writing, and when Eleanor's father has an opening in his office, he offers it to Joe, who impressed him with his diligence, honesty, and refusal to ask for or take charity.\n\nThis is where Ragged Dick stopped, because Horatio Alger was more honest with his audience; an office job is in all likelihood as far, realistically speaking, as a street arab could go. But Emmett, for whatever reason, went farther, and in the space of a few years Charity Joe has worked his way up the business and, pushed on by Eleanor's father, won the Mayorship.\n\nSite Master's Note: I have, in the past, relied upon the contributions of a few other people to put together this site, and some of these people sent along entire entries, such as this one. I have suspected for a while now that some of these entries were, to put it kindly, somewhat embellished. Now, thanks to Justin Gilbert and the good people of the Bloods and Dime Novels mailing list, I've begun to find out which entries were created from whole cloth, rather than accurately reported to me. I'm not very happy about this, you understand.\n\nThanks to Michael Holmes, I can provide information on the real Charity Joe, rather than the fake one mentioned above. To quote Michael:\n\nCHARITY JOE; OR, FROM STREET BOY TO LORD MAYOR\n\nBy George Emmett\n\nOne Shilling edition in coloured paper wrapper comprising ten weekly penny parts.\n\nPublished by Hogarth House, London c.1885\n\nThe author was an ex-cavalry officer who is reputed to have taken part in the famous charge at Balaclava. He was proprietor of the firm of Hogarth House, Bouverie St, Fleet St. This was a family business and along with his three brothers and one sister they ran a successful firm from the early 1860s to the late 1880s before finally fading away to relative obscurity.\n\nThe story opens with a flourish of the pen by the enthusiastic and offbeat Emmett. Quoting Dr. Johnson's assertion that \"No book was ever written but something, however small, may be learned from it\" he follows with a dismissal of the present day publishing scene ( i.e. c.1885 )\n\n\"....when literary bookmakers spring up like mushrooms.....with as much experience of the work before them as the not-to-be-despised-fungi.\" This is the first of several literary digs at 'lower' literature, which were no doubt aimed at the Emmett's competitors, but it's interesting to see such remarks coming from an author who seemed to be viewing cheap fiction from some moral high ground. In fact Victorian society of the time would undoubtedly have slapped the label 'penny dreadful' on this work, regardless of its redeeming message.\n\nThe tale begins with the sixteen year old Charity Joe working as clerk to Mr. Sivins, a surly collector's agent, who for reasons unknown removed Joe from the workhouse some years earlier. The board of the workhouse in their infinite wisdom had given him the euphonious appelation 'Joseph Chudleigh Cholmondeley' which the other children shortened to 'Joe Chummy.' In his new situation as boy clerk to Sivins's loan shark business he is known to the street boys as 'Charity Joe.'\n\nThe 'disaffected heir' storyline ( de rigeur in these tales ) is hinted at early on: \"He had a dim recollection of being happy, and of a lady he called mother...\" We learn that Sivins had initially farmed the boy out to a drunken shoemaker, but after five years of beatings this wretch finally dies and thus Joe is once again under the charge of Mr.Sivins. He is permitted to adopt his deceased master's dog, Toby.\n\nAfter trying to place him in several lowly jobs, all of which Joe is expelled from for either mischief or fighting, 'Old Siv' is compelled to take him back under his own employment. We learn that 'Joe and Toby soon became a terror to the juvenile population around St. George's Market..\"\n\nOne fine evening, contrary to the express orders of Sivins, Joe is tempted from his desk by a game of duck in the street outside. A broken window and a tussle with a copper prompt Sivins to place the \"spirited lad\" in the hands of the skiving Mr.Dothem at his skinflint starvation school, Baream Hall. If you think this sounds a little like Oliver Twist meets Nicholas Nickleby you're on the right track.\n\nIn the course of introducing us to the daughters of Mr. Dothem, Emmett gets an opportunity to fire a few more shots at prevailing cheap literature, albeit with fictitious titles:\n\n\" Sylvia Dothem was a lady of about thirty....she like to read about lovers whose oozing passion flowed out of their finger ends.....and she received large doses...for week by week she read The Family Trumpeter and The London Jowler.\n\nHer sister Deborah was a somewhat stout maiden of twenty seven summers...she was also romantic, but the disease was in a stronger form. She contributed to the weekly serials, but her choice was the London Roarer and the Bow Chimes.\n\nShe liked a little sensation with her novels; such as an amiable daughter having poisoned her mother, bolts with the cashbox, and someone else is taken up for the murder etc etc. \"\n\nWithin a few days at the school Joe and Toby first dethrone the school bully and his cronies ( \"Now look here, short jacket\" said Boggins \" You've put your legs too far through your trousers this morning\"........\"Bounce is very good\" said Joe \"but it don't sell here\" ) ; then raid the overstocked larder of the Dothem family and distribute the food to the emaciated boys. After a riot in which the boys get revenge on their tyrannical schoolmaster, Joe and his new found friend, Tommy Nimblejaws, take to the road to begin their adventures.\n\nOn their journey along the country roads the author tackles the contemporary issue of children ( supposedly ) being led astray by 'pernicious' literature. A bizarre conversation follows in which Charity Joe acts as the mouthpiece for the goody-goody Victorian parent. The passage is too lenghty to quote in full but these lines give an idea of the message :\n\n\" I wish these were the days of highwaymen, Joe\"\n\n\"Do you? What for?\"\n\n\"Why we'd do the same as the young chap I used to read about in penny numbers\"....\n\n\"What became of him?\" Joe asked \" he was hanged of course?\"\n\n\"No, he wasn't. The king made him a knight or a duke or something...\"\n\n\"Well Tommy, I didn't think you were such a fool as to spend your money on such rubbish\"\n\n\"Rubbish?\" Tommy repeated \"Why it's all true.\"\n\n\"Not a word\" Joe said \" I took a number or two of the 'Red-Nosed Pirate, or, the Highwayman of the Bounding Ocean'.....it was no good, only a pack of lies and rubbish; and the highwaymen you used to read about were all sneaking cut-throats, and used to have to hide away in all sorts of dirty holes and corners, and they were always caught and hanged by the neck at Tyburn....\"\n\n\"Well...\" said Tommy \"I won't read any more; there's plenty of good books to be had for a penny.\"\n\nIn a country village the boys meet with a former friend of Joe's, Bill Adler, who has a little sideshow which tours the provincial towns. The boys and the dog join up with Bill and the story then runs along fairly predictable lines. Several encounters with a rich lady and her grumpy father, 'the General', set up what seems destined to be the predictable ending, but surprisingly Emmet switches track and goes for a highly unusual rebuff to convention.\n\nThe three comrades and their dog, after numerous adventures, eventually manage to scrape together enough money to open a little shop in one of the poorest quarters of London. Joe falls for a dishy young seamstress and wins her mother's favour by rescuing them from eviction by his old boss Sivins.\n\nIn his quest to learn his background Joe marches into the London home of the old general and demands to know his connection to the family. The obvious disaffected heir story unfolds, and his inheritance is offered by the family if he'll leave behind his street life and become a young gentleman. This is the twist which Emmet must be commended for including, for Joe rejects the offer of wealth and position with a fiery speech which can be summarised with one nice line:\n\n\"Good society and you may be jiggered!\"\n\nJoe returns to his comrades and through hard work becomes employed by a bullion merchant whose business he eventually inherits. His elevation to Lord Mayor occurs on the last page suggesting the plot may have been concluded before its time ( a suggestion of Joe going to sea is dispelled some pages earlier by an old seaman relating a genuinely horrific and factual sounding account of a flogging 'around the fleet' ).\n\n\"Ring down the curtain please, for this is the end of the story of Charity Joe, who from a Street boy became Lord Mayor\".\n\nharrington, John. John Charrington was created by E. Nesbit and appeared in �John Charrington�s Wedding� (Grim Tales, 1893). Nesbit (1858-1924) is best known as a writer of children�s fantasies, but she also penned some tales of the supernatural, including �Man-Sized in Marble� (see the Knights in Marble entry). �John Charrington�s Wedding� is a predictable return-from-the-dead story, but not the less enjoyable for being predictable.\n\nIn the small English town of Brixham all the young men are in love with May Forster. Few more so than John Charrington, but he�s more persistent than the others, and he has the added knack that what he wants, usually have a �queer way of coming to pass.� So when May agrees to marry John, the nameless narrator is surprised and even doubts May�s affection for John, but the narrator accidentally sees May looking at John, her face transformed with love, and the narrator quickly ceases doubting. The narrator also hears John say, �My dear, my dear, I believe I should come back from the dead if you wanted me,� something the narrator does not remark upon (but that modern readers are likely to). Two days before the wedding the narrator has to go to London on business, and finds May and John on the train as well. John has to visit a dying friend, but May doesn�t want him to go; she was a bad feeling about the trip. John�s laughs her premonitory feelings off, however, and goes. But he does tell her that he will return, no matter what: �Alive or dead I mean to be married on Thursday!� Charrington stays an extra day, but when the wedding day arrives he still has not returned. The train he should have traveled on does not contain him, and the narrator becomes convinced that something happened. He returns to the church, to find that Charrington has already entered�looking worse than he ever did in his life, according to the gardener, and not acknowledging anyone. The narrator has arrived when the wedding is over, but he is in time to see the party leave the church, and Charrington does indeed look bad�dusty, disheveled, and with a black mark above his eyebrow. May looks extremely pale, and the bell ringers do not sound the wedding peal, but rather the passing bells. All is silent as the bridal pair enter their carriage and leave, and it is only after their departure that the wedding party angrily speaks, May�s father furious that a drunken man married his daughter. When the carriage arrives at the Forster home, Charrington is gone, and May has fainted, her blonde hair gone white and her beautiful face �white and drawn with agony and horror, bearing such a look of terror as I have never seen before except in dreams.� A telegraph boy then arrives with a note that Charrington was thrown from a dogcart at half past one that afternoon and died on the spot. The wedding took place at half past three.... May never awakened and was buried a few days later.\n\n�John Charrington�s Wedding� has none of the surprises of the cleverer sort of ghost story, but it is still entertaining. It�s got a brisk pace and the modern-seeming 1890s-style smart dialogue and is quite the opposite the padded, turgid Bulwer-Lytton style. Nesbit compensates for the predictability of the story�s outcome by letting the suspense of what exactly is going to happen mount. Nesbit doesn�t go for the cruelty of �Knights in Marble,� but she isn�t kindly, either.\n\nCharrington was smug in life, assured that he�d always get what he want. And we might assume that he really did love May Forster, even if his words seem to smack more of conceit than of affection. But there was no love in his return from the dead; he did so out of pride, because he intended to keep his word and show the world that he was reliable. In doing so frightened the life out of May. Hardly the act of a loving husband, wouldn�t you say?\n\nhief of Police. The Chief (no other name given) was created by Alexander M. Reynolds and appeared in \"The Mystery of Djara Singh,\" which appeared in the Overland Monthly v30 n179, November 1897. Alexander M. Reynolds apparently lived in the American West, for the Overland Monthly was a Californian magazine, and Reynolds is credited with a few other stories in the Overland Monthly and with co-authoring an 1894 street map of Seattle, but other than that there's no information available on him. (My assumption is that Reynolds was a part of the Old San Francisco Science-Fantasy Movement, along with Robert Duncan Vampire Bomb Milne and a few others). This is unfortunate, since \"The Mystery of Djara Singh\" is surprisingly entertaining as well as an early example of the Occult Detective genre.\n\nI've written about a few O.D.s on this site and on my Pulp Heroes site, of course: John Bell, Dr. Silence, Carnacki, and some others. What is interesting about the Chief of Police is that he appeared in 1897, before Bell and before Flaxman Low, who was the first true Occult Detective. The Chief is not a recurring character, which is the easiest way to separate him from someone like Bell or Low or Carnacki, but Reynolds clearly has the concept of a mystery investigation involving the occult in his head in \"The Mystery of Djara Singh.\"\n\nThe story actually has the feel of a 1920s story to me, being surprisingly free of excessive verbiage and taking a more modern and less Victorian attitude towards its subject; there's no talk of Buddhism and spirit worlds, as you might get with a Victorian mystic character like Ozmar. It's about Djara Singh, a Thibetan (sic) Prince who visits New York City and becomes a sensation, touted and wined and dined and living very well at the best New York hotel. At the same time several banks in the city are burgled of large amounts of money under mysterious and quite improbable circumstances--grays of cold coins vanishing in front of witnesses and the like. Professor W. K. Miriam, the \"professor of Oriental Philosophies in Columbia College,\" visits the Chief of Police of N.Y.C. and tells him that he, Miriam, had spent time in India investigating psychic phenomena \"among the mysterious religious sects of the highlands of that country,\" and that he had seen men separate their spirits from their bodies and telekinetically manipulate matter, and \"if there are men who possess the extraordinary faculty described, would not the commission of such crimes be to them a very simple matter?\"\n\nThe Chief is initially dubious but agrees for politeness' sake to investigate the matter. He wires Scotland Yard and the Police Commissioner of Calcutta, asking for information on Djara Singh and for robberies committed by Singh while he was in London. Calcutta wires back, informing him that Singh was \"formerly priest among mysterious religious sect in Haujab. Reported deposed account irregularities.\" Scotland Yard responds to the wire by telling the Chief that there were a few mysterious bank robberies, quite similar to those in NYC, while Singh was in NYC.\n\nThe Chief mulls this over and after another bank robbery decides that he needs to do something, so he goes to \"a professional spiritualist and fortune teller, an alleged Italian, who went by the imposing name of Rienzi Di Colonna. He was a most unmitigated scoundrel, as the Chief had had occasion to know in the course of his professional duties.\" After a \"singularly frank, honest conversation\" about Djara Singh, Colonna agrees to be hired to spy on Djara Singh; Colonna, you see, though a crook and scoundrel, is also learned about astral projection and various psychic abilities, and can do what the Chief asks. However, Colonna warns the Chief that Singh \"may also have powers that will make my mission an uncertain and perhaps dangerous undertaking, and one liable to end in unknown disasters.\"\n\nWell, sure 'nuff, ten days later Colonna is dead; his spirit left his body to spy on Singh and never returned, and his body died of unknown causes. Singh immediately leaves NYC. Ten weeks later the Chief receives a letter from \"Tokio\" (sic) telling him that\n\nThe writer, while he cannot but admire the boldness of an experiment so much in advance of your civilization, must presume to doubt its wisdom, and to suggest that before conclusions are again tried with unknown forces, it would be well to know something of the strength of those you seek to oppose, and of the power with which it is intended to overthrow them.\n\nThe Chief is left not knowing what to think, but\n\nthe chief of police is studying occult philosophy and speculating upon the advisability of introducing into the police department a corps of trained spiritualists.\n\nIt's hard to call \"The Mystery of Djara Singh\" sparse in style, but it's told in a matter-of-fact and almost droll tone, which is a pleasing difference to the paid-by-the-word verbiage of the dime novel detectives and the Victorian posturing of so many contemporary British detectives, including the sainted Holmes himself. I think the impression of drollness I'm left with from the story is greater than what's actually there, but it's significant (to me, anyhow) that I'm left with that impression at all.\n\n\"The Mystery of Djara Singh\"\n\nFrom the Making of America site, which is a very nice resource indeed.\n\nhild Adventurers.
