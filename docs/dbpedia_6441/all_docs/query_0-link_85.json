        "text": "I'm the twenty pounds of shifts, pantalettes, underslips, overslips, corsets, birdcage hoops, and bodices it takes the actress's dresser two hours to put on and over the actress's head, and fasten with hooks, ribbons, and laces. The actress's furious rant during this process, and as she staggers in us to the soundstage, are unprintable.\n\nMeanwhile, the dresser keeps muttering to herself, \"It could be worse, it could be worse: I could have to launder it all.\"\n\nI'm the coach brought on to teach the actress's how to walk in this shit, because most of them waddle in the costumes.\n\nCan someone PLEASE remind the actresses that only whores lift their skirts with BOTH hands?!\n\nLadies of virtue lift the skirt with one hand and to the side when managing stairs.\n\nI'm the real jewellery looking sadly on. It's too too bad they don't borrow me from places like Grey's in Bond Street - the faux shit fools no one, and it so brings down the look of the piece.\n\nIt's how they cheap out on filming cost: the insurance, you know.\n\nI'm Luchino Visconti. My movies are untolerable snoozefests, but I get to fuck all these lovely european male stars, and some of the americans too, which is my main reason for making them. Oddly, because I put some Classical music and litterary references in them, I can even sell 3 hours of a elderly pedo chasing teenage ass, and clueless females italian teachers the world over will bring their classes to watch me.\n\nI'm the french star who was originally cast as the lead. I had interminable lists of demands, arrived late for the shooting in the farthest possible hotel, fucked my married costar, complained that I wasn't treated with the respect I'm entitled to, since I've worked once 15 years ago with Truffaut/Godard/Fellini/Polanski/Welles, fucked my other married co-star, had a nervous breakdown, refused any kind of contact with the press before/during/after the shooting, all in the first week, and finally stromed off the set saying I couldn't possibly play that part, since I have a young husband, and my character is supposed to be over 30. I have to be replaced and all my scenes reshot. People wonder why I 'm so scarce on the big screen, outside my homeland\n\nI am The Cold. If an Austen heroine dares to go for a solitary walk, it will surely rain and I will befall her, even unto threatening her life and propelling the remainder of the plot. Oddly, no one suffering under me ever sneezes or blows their noses but all nearly die of me.\n\nWeâ€™re the dueling actors both playing Truman Capote telling the same story in two different films released less than a year apart because Hollywood has such a hard time coming up with original ideas. One of us had the good grace to have Catherine Keener as our Harper Lee, the other one, unfortunately, Sandra Bullock.\n\nI'm this british actor with a long nose and pale eyes you've seen in every period piece film for a short few years, and then never again. Apart from my curly hair that looked good in the rain, I've aged like unrefrigirated custard. I do Shakespeare now mostly, I'm touring a lot.\n\nI'm the coach and four. I am just possibly the most uncomfortable vehicle for travel ever developed. As soon as the director calls, \"Cut!\" the actors get out and start groaning and clutching their backs, barely able to walk. Even though they haven't really travelled for two days in me. Trust me: a half hour will cripple you for life.\n\nAnd why those narrow little wobbly steps out the door don't collapse under the weight of the ladies costumes, I don't know. I'm waiting for it. It will absolutely, totally, memorably, make my day.\n\nIâ€™m Melinda going after the wrong man and regretting it for years to come. I guess you could say that it was Not a clear day.\n\nIâ€™m not even sure I can say I was in a period film. Well, as Scarlett Oâ€™hara once said to Rhett Butler onceâ€¦partly.\n\nI am Lenski's aria from \"Eugene Onegin\", sung before I head off to a duel with my former friend, and Tchaikovsky's exquisite music make it clear Lenski is going to lose as he sets off in his frock coat and high hat to meet his second and get on with it.\n\nI'm Jenna Malone, and I hold the distinction of being the only actress in any period drama who's appropriate ripened lack of hygiene comes straight through the silver screen. I look as though I haven't had a good bath in six weeks, and that is how it should be - being true to the period.\n\nI'm the rose garden in which the plain but wealthy county catch proposes to the heroine, who accepts him in order to save the family estate.\n\nIn the end, she realises he's worth ten of the handsome Hussar she's been pining for, but who was two-timing her with the rich widow in the next county.\n\nI could have told her that, but who listens to roses?\n\nI'm the respectable but not well born lass who captures the heart of the Duke's heir. The family isn't having it. It's going to have to be Gretna Green. Then there will be nothing they can do with it.\n\nI'm the male clothes the heroine dresses in to run off to meet her lover at an inn.\n\nAmazingly, I fit her perfectly, and she looks quite, er, toothsome as a young man, I must say.\n\nI'm the silk purse dangling by a cord from the heroine's wrist. You have no more idea what I contain than you did the Queen's purses.\n\nAnd that's as it should be.\n\n[quote]I'm the one nude scene to get an R rating\n\nAs a horny middle schooler in the early '90s with no access to video/print porn, I used to rent period movies from the '70s and '80s (particularly foreign) to get my rocks off. I knew there was bound to be male nudity. ðŸ˜‚\n\nThankfully, my family got internet connection in 1996, when I was a junior.\n\nI'm the crone in the broken down cottage at the edge of the wood. The young women seek me out because they know I can predict the future. They always bring me a gift: a few coins, some tobacco, some eggs, even a bit of port. It's not much, but it's a living.\n\nI really can see the future, but I have to be careful, or I'll end up at the stake.\n\nIn other words, I am an old crone who can see the future playing an old crone who can see the future so I appear as an old crone chivvying silly young women along for some money, tobacco, eggs, and sometimes a bit of port.\n\nIf they only knew.\n\nI'm Tintagel Castle, and as you know, the walls have ears.\n\nAnd if you believe for one moment that Igraine didn't know Uther wasn't Gorlois, you'll probably believe everything you see in yet another bloody filming of the Arthurian legend.\n\nr199 I'm the Lady of Shalott... you might come riding, riding, riding but I'm just going to lie there dead until I nearly drown, forced to clean to a post for life until my raven haired beauty, my eternal rival, comes to rescue me and I reluctantly surrender myself onto him.\n\nI'm R43 = I'm Maggie Smith's performance. You've seen me 1,256 times, since 1962, but you never tire of me.\n\n[quote]R192 I'm the witty retort delivered in exactly the same manner by Dame Maggie Smith for the last 50 years to rapturous wonder by armies of wizened homosexuals across the English speaking world...and beyond...\n\nR192, aren't you ashamed of yourself ? is taht what you do ? are you Amy Schumer, stealing other peoples's jokes ?\n\nI'm the corsets.\n\nIf I'm in a British film, I will be correct for the period and look as uncomfortable as hell. If I'm in an American film, I will be some colorful satiny thing that looks like it came from Victoria's Secret, and I'll probably be worn on the outside of the gown!\n\nI'm Julia Roberts' costume in her one attempt at period drama, screaming for casting to give it a rethink and put someone who looks like she belongs in something besides a miniskirt in the role.\n\nAnd it wasn't even that far back.\n\nChrist, Neeson would have looked better in that midi-blouse and skirt\n\nDid we need to add her to The Troubles?!\n\nI'm the PERIOD PIECE FILM of the MUSICAL sort. I've decided this time that my cast would sing LIVE on set. The industry is so shocked that the first reaction is to throw awards at me like it were raining oscars. After the dust settles, I become an legendary object of horror and ridicule. looking at you , Russell C.\n\nI'm male primogeniture.\n\nThe Queen may have gotten rid of it for the royal line of succession, but I'm hanging on in the hereditary peerage.\n\nWithout me, 60% of those story lines would either."
