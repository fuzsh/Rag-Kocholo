Thus, it is important to understand the role\n\nof school leaders as both gatekeepers and facilitators within their speci c context.\n\nPhuong is a teacher in a preschool in Nam Giang, a mountainous district in Quang Nam province in the central part of Vietnam. It\n\nis an area with many ethnic minorities, and children in this area experience many barriers to learning and participation at school. Twice\n\na year, Phuong applies process-oriented child monitoring in her classroom (watch the video; see media link below). She observes signs of well-being and involvement in her learners, assessing their level of participation and learning. She asks herself, âWho is doing well?â and âWho is at risk of not learning?â\n\nAfter identifying the main barriers to learning and participation experienced by the children in her class, Phuong considers what priority actions she can take to mitigate those barriers. She develops and applies concrete changes\n\nto the environment, materials, activities, and interactions. By doing so, she increases equity and care in her classroom. Phuong learned these skills from a core group of trainers who train teachers like Phuong in process-oriented child monitoring. is core group includes provincial and district level education o cers, school leaders, and teachers.\n\nWatch the video: http://bit.ly/Phuongclass\n\nA previous version of this article was presented at the 19th UNESCO-APEID International Conference- E ective School Leadership for the 21st Century, 7-9 November 2018.\n\nBut what happens if the school leader does not approve of Phuongâs new approaches\n\nin the classroom? Or if the school leader\n\nwants the same activities and materials in all classes? What if the school leader is hesitant about children learning through play? What\n\nif the school leader gets annoyed about a teacher taking initiative? What if Phuong\n\ndoes not possess enough autonomy to initiate innovation? What if the school leader does not allow her to make mistakes?\n\nWhile teachers are the most important factor contributing to learning outcomes, school leaders are key in creating the conditions\n\nfor e ective teaching and learning. ey are gatekeepers to change.\n\nPreschool Education in Vietnam\n\nSince 2009, Vietnam has stepped up its consideration of preschool education and has established solid foundations in the provision of public preschools for 3- to 5-year-old children. Current participation rates are high; 89.56% of 5-year-old children participated in organized learning in 2016. However, a focus on equitable access alone does not guarantee the opportunity for all children to ful ll\n\ntheir potential. Inequality in developmental outcomes remains a concern.\n\nOver the past two decades, the Vietnamese government made signi cant investments in in-service teacher professional development\n\nat all levels of education. However, most of these trainings were theoretical rather than practical, and attempted to reach large groups of teachers through a cascade approach. ese e orts proved ine ective; teachers continue to experience di culties when transferring and applying newly introduced methods to\n\n4\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nP:07\n\nIncreased Care Width and Equity\n\nStep 3\n\nAct to enhance well-being and involvement\n\nStep 1 Observe childrenâs well-being and involvement\n\nChild\n\ntheir daily practice. ey struggle to fully understand or implement the o cial policy of child-centred education. ey continue to use more traditional, teacher-centered activities that separate âlearningâ and âplay.â ey still have di culty innovating their practices to cater to diverse needs and address barriers experienced by children at risk of not learning.\n\nIn this context, VVOB Vietnam works together with the provincial Departments\n\nof Education and Training of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Kon Tum provinces to mitigate preschool childrenâs barriers to learning in disadvantaged and ethnically diverse districts. e intervention improves in- service professional development of preschool teachers by building the capacity of VVOBâs government partners. e objective is to improve the quality of preschool education and\n\nsupport all childrenâs development to their rich and full potential.\n\nInitiating Professional Re ection\n\ne intervention introduces process-oriented child monitoring (Figure 1) to preschool teachers. is approach starts with observing childrenâs levels of well-being and involvement as process indicators of learning, using a contextualized version of the Leuven scales for emotional well-being and involvement. is\n\nis followed by identi cation of social barriers to learning and participation. To address these barriers, teachers then select action points they can implement to improve the well-being and involvement of all children. Maybe the teacher can rearrange her class and make the corners more attractive or enrich their content? By making sure materials are accessible and fun, more children will engage with them. e\n\nFigure 1. Process-oriented child monitoring\n\nStep 2 Re ect on barriers to learning and participation\n\nMarch/April 2019 5\n\nP:08\n\n6\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\ninvolvement of a child will likely increase when an activity meets that childâs interest. As teachers develop a re ective practice to better meet the needs of all children, they widen the scope of learning opportunities.\n\nProcess-oriented child monitoring\n\nhence becomes a catalyst for developing professional re ective practice. When teachers share their questions, evidence, and thinking with each other and jointly re ect, they build collaborative expertise. Process-oriented child monitoring is embedded in the class and school context and creates an innovative school-based learning opportunity for teachers.\n\ne process described above needs encouragement and nurturing. School leaders are key to creating the conditions for e ective teaching and learning. ey can enhance a learning culture as well as develop systems that support teacher learning. is also applies to Vietnamese schools where hierarchy is a given and teachers are typically hesitant to deviate from their formally assigned roles.\n\nSchool Leadership in Vietnam\n\nWhile Vietnamese preschool leaders\n\nexperience less autonomy in terms of teacher appointment, investments in teaching, and learning materials and school facilities,\n\nthey do operate in a context that recognizes the importance of teacher professional development. Despite limited funding, systems are in place to organize both external and internal or school-based teacher professional development activities.\n\nHowever, hierarchy, collectivism, and the tendency to avoid âlosing faceâ are core values of Confucianism and remain deeply rooted in Vietnamese society, including school culture. A Vietnamese school leader must be capable of navigating the authority of the education system, maintaining credibility as a leader in the eyes of teachers and of the community.\n\nis creates a challenge for external partners to contribute to their e ectiveness directly. Like\n\nVVOB â education for development strengthens education systems worldwide. Quality education is key to achieving a more equitable world for all.\n\nVVOB Vietnam and the Ministry of Education of Vietnam have joined forces to improve the performance and effectiveness of preschool teachers in disadvantaged, ethnically diverse districts in three central provinces (Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Kon Tum) through its BaMi program. This early education program (2017-21) is nanced by Belgium.\n\nRecently, VVOB Vietnam started implementing a European Union co-funded program (2018-2021) on gender-responsive play-based learning in early childhood education (GENTLE).\n\nteachers, school leaders are reluctant to deviate from their formally assigned tasks, which may limit their support for education innovation and change.\n\nIdentifying an Appropriate Entry Point\n\nWorking directly on school leadership as\n\na driver of education change, especially at\n\nthe start of the intervention, has proven di cult. erefore, VVOBâs collaboration with Departments of Education and Training primarily focuses on school-based teacher professional development.\n\nEducation o cers, with their core group, train teachers like Phuong in process-oriented child monitoring. Afterward, these education o cers visit schools and coach teachers on practical implementation in the classroom. e education o cers bring teachers together to jointly re ect on the teachersâ classroom observations of learners and subsequent actions.\n\nP:09\n\nTeacher professional development on process-oriented child monitoring\n\nTeachers\n\nEducation of cers\n\nSchool leaders\n\nCreating an enabling environment\n\nFigure 2. School leaders as gatekeepers to change, nding an appropriate entry point for action\n\ne education o cers meet regularly with their core group to prepare the training on process- oriented child monitoring, plan for the support visits to schools, and discuss the role they can take during these visits. While doing this,\n\nthey also re ect on the e ectiveness of their teacher professional development system as a whole. ey consider questions such as: âHow can we improve the way we develop capacity with teachers?â and âDoes what we do lead to learning and change in the classroom?â\n\nBased on their experiences during support visits to schools and re ection on the e ectiveness\n\nof the existing system, education o cers have identi ed school leaders as gatekeepers to education change. Some of these school leaders do not give teachers enough autonomy to initiate innovations. As a result, teachers are not con dent about trying out new techniques and potentially making mistakes. e core group also noticed that schools with a culture\n\nof learning and collaboration are quicker to integrate innovations successfully.\n\nStarting from the multi-dimensional model\n\nof school leadership, VVOB and its partners looked at how school leaders can support teachers to re ect on and change their practices to better meet the needs of all children (Figure 2).\n\nEmerging Practices of Working With Preschool Leaders\n\nAs a rst step, education o cers include school leaders in teachersâ learning trajectories for improving the quality of education\n\nby re ecting on childrenâs well-being and involvement. Participating in and promoting teacher learning and development is the leadership dimension that is most closely associated with positive student outcomes. School leaders who participate in learning trajectories for teachers develop a deeper\n\nMarch/April 2019 7\n\nP:10\n\nCatering to the needs of all children\n\nPhuong learning with other teachers\n\n8 Childhood Education: Innovations\n\nP:11\n\nVVOB programs globally use a model of eight dimensions of leadership affecting student outcomes, developed from research as a starting point. Depending on the countryâs experience, challenges, and needs, this model is adjusted, acknowledging\n\na diverse set of national contexts. This means assessing the\n\ncontext and identifying who exactly needs support\n\nImproving conditions for teaching & learning\n\nDe ning visions, values, & direction\n\nStudent learning Well-being & achievements High expectations\n\nBuilding trust\n\nto improve school leadership. Local education partnersâ ministries of education and institutions that are responsible for\n\nthe professional development of school leadersâ\n\nmay need support\n\nto empower school leaders to improve\n\nthe quality of education. Professional development providers may need assistance from experts.\n\nBuilding relationships inside the school community\n\nRedesigning and enriching the curriculum\n\nRestructuring the organization: redesigning roles & responsibilities\n\nEnhancing teaching & learning\n\nBuilding relationships outside the school community\n\nEnhancing teacher quality (including succession planning)\n\nunderstanding of the conditions needed for sta to implement and sustain changes.\n\nHowever, education o cers soon realized that school leadersâ participation was not enough. Although it leads to a better understanding of the education change envisaged, it does not automatically lead to enhanced conditions for sta to try out and apply newly learned skills.\n\nerefore, education o cers now include the concept of an enabling environment explicitly in their interventions as a second step. During training, which both teachers and school leaders attend, they work with school leaders to plan how they will support their teachers.\n\nPhuong is nding it easier to innovate her classroom practices, as her school leader gives\n\nFigure 3.

Her school leader, in turn, is supported by the education o cers in her district and province to create this enabling environment. As the education o cers engage in this process, their understanding grows and next steps can be taken.\n\nConclusions\n\nSchool leaders play a key role in leading professional learning in their schools. However, school leaders also depend on an enabling environment to learn and grow. As the education o cersâ understanding of the school leaderâs role with regard to teacher development grows, they re ect on their own role and take the next steps to facilitate school-\n\nRelevant websites and resources for further reading:\n\nâ¢ https://vietnam.vvob.be/\n\nâ¢ www.vvob.org\n\nâ¢ www.child-encyclopedia.com/sites/default/ les/\n\ndossiers-complets/en/child-care-early-childhood-\n\neducation-and-care.pdf#page=52\n\nâ¢ BaMi programme (Mitigating Preschool Childrenâs\n\nBarriers to Learning in Disadvantaged and Ethnically Diverse Districts) /www.vvob.be/en/programmes/vietnam-bami\n\nâ¢ VVOB.

VVOB does this both at the school level, via collaborative learning and school leaders, and at the district and provincial levels, where education o cers in charge of preschool education can facilitate and guide school-based teacher professional development. As school leaders and education o cers collaborate with teachers on changing their practices and beliefs about education, they trigger broader system change to achieve quality education for all.\n\n10 Childhood Education: Innovations\n\nVideos:\n\nâ¢ What is process-oriented child monitoring?: www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI0_ VrqWzvQ\n\nâ¢ From observation to action!

This article describes an innovative model for school improvement that focuses on coaching to elevate educators into true change-makers.\n\nBelinda Dunnick Karge\n\nConcordia University Irvine\n\nCynthia E. Stephens, Mary K. Widener, and Janice Poda\n\n14\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nAny Leadership and Education Effectiveness Group\n\nWhen educators are âelevatedâ to a level\n\nwhere they prioritize accountability for their actions in the classroom, inside the school,\n\nand outside with the school community, they take ownership in supporting students using\n\nall possible strategies to enhance student\n\nresults and intentionally make overall school improvement progress. Hallingerâs review\n\nof 30 years of empirical research on school leadership clearly points to the a rmative impact of building collaborative positive school climate to increase student achievement.1 Elevating educators in such a way is a primary component in the innovative Leadership E ectiveness and E ciency Analysis and Action Planning for Schools (LEEAAPS) model.\n\ne LEEAAPS Model is a research-based e ective school improvement tool designed\n\nto elevate educators and all involved in the deepest operations and needs at the preschool, school, center, or district level. A speci c focus is on high-need, hard-to-sta communities where challenges contributing to school\n\nunderperformance impede progress, and change is necessary.\n\nFigure 1 provides a graphic of the LEEAAPS Model: E ective School Improvement. Innovation for the design was developed by\n\nthe non-pro t Initiative of the Leadership & Education E ectiveness Group ( e LEEG Group). e LEEAAPS model was informed by input over two years of convening education professionals and stakeholders representing diverse schools, a variety of districts, multiple states, and education organizations, as well as research about school improvement and reform literature. e LEEAAPS Model for school improvement advocates for the use of coaching within analysis of school function areas (SFAs) using an E4 framework of Engage, Empower, Equip, and Elevate.\n\nMany formal and informal induction and support programs are available for teachers. Far fewer in-depth and continuing programs and services exist for leaders.

During Phase I, Foundation, a coach âwalksâ alongside the\n\nleadership of a school, preschool, center, or district to establish agreement about who will be coached and how long the coaching will last. Prior to beginning the coaching process, the assigned coach provides an overview of the coaching conversation structure. Together, the coach, coachee, and supervisors (if appropriate) develop an agreement on the overall design and plan for coaching implementation. e coach and coachee devote time and discussion to fostering rapport and a trusting relationship. To ensure mutual understanding of the progress accountability in Phase 2, Discovery, using a coaching conversation approach, the coach strategically supports the coachee with the SFAs to assess current school instructional, organizational practices and student achievement results. LEEAAPS ndings from the SFA data form the basis for identifying and\n\nMarch/April 2019 15\n\nCoaching Engaged Listening\n\nEmpowered\n\nQuestioning & Feedback\n\nEquipped Thinking & Re ecting\n\nElevated\n\nAccountability for Actions & Student Outcomes\n\nSFAs\n\nData Informed Observed Researched Feedback Informed Veri ed\n\nE4\n\nEngage Empower Equip Elevate\n\nP:18\n\n16\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nbuilding on school strengths that will foster progress and for naming priority improvement needs that drive change strategies in LSI\n\nPhase 3, Intentional Intervention. Continuing coaching conversations create a systematic process for assessing and planning to remediate or prevent an educational or developmental problem. ese conversations lead to action steps.\n\ne coaching process continues in LSI Phase\n\n3, Intentional Intervention, to further develop plans into strategic action and open systematic avenues for relationship building, mutual understanding, and commitment to implement well-de ned, communicated, and intentional interventions for strategies aimed at (1) educator and school performance improvement to increase the achievement of all and (2) continuous progress monitoring, strategy assessment, and transparent reporting among faculty, sta , and community members.\n\nDuring Phase 3, Intentional Intervention,\n\na coach engages the school or program leader and leadership team to ensure continuation of the coaching relationships, building for mutual understanding, schedule adjustments, observations, and coaching conversations around collegial intervention processes and strategy delivery methods and e cacy of progress monitoring for e ective improvement.\n\nEducators from preschool through grade 12 and early childhood education providers in beta groups representing four states provided critical feedback on the LEEAAPS coaching model. Participants repeatedly commented that most coaching models do not o er comprehensive follow through over time to sustain positive leadership impact of change and improvement on behalf of students.\n\ney a rmed the value of LSI follow through for continuing with learner-centered, comprehensive coaching beyond intervention phases for education leadersâespecially for new and novice leaders and veteran leaders who are moving to new site settings or levels. e impact, integration, and sustainability\n\nof successful interventions often depend\n\non how well intervention is strategically âfollowedâ to ensure progress is monitored and results-based adjustments are collegially made and communicated school wide and in the community. e purpose of continued coaching in LSI Phase 4 is supporting leaders to build and apply re nement capacity for sustained change, e ectiveness, and forward envisioning, to address the needs, potential, and possibilities of current and prospective individual students and collective student populations.\n\nLSI Phase 4: Follow rough allows review\n\nof what is happening with the intervention that has been determined. is is similar to progress monitoring, where adjustments are made when needed. Lack of follow through and mid-course adjustments lead to potential failure of intervention implementation and improvement. Follow through provides a continuous cycle of review, revision, planning, and implementation.\n\ne process of LSI Coaching uses the E4 framework mentioned above and describes\n\nthe actions used by the coach and coachee: Engaged listening, Empowered questioning and feedback, Equipped thinking and re ecting, and Elevated accountability for taking action toward realizing goals and ultimately impacting student outcomes. e LEEAAPS coaching de nition and methods align with other recognized education, business, and executive coaching models. Notably and uniquely, the LEEAAPS model extends support for leaders beyond assessment, priority, and intervention and includes comprehensive coaching to ensure support for leaders during the follow through phase that is essential to ensure regular and fused observation and adjustments for sustained, e ective improvement.\n\nIn review of the LEEAAPS assessment and coaching model, leaders identify school performance indicators and analyze data to guide action planning in the SFA continuous improvement process. Leaders use the SFA indicators (see Figure 2) to re ect and\n\nP:19\n\ndetermine if the essential components of a highly e ective school operation exist in\n\na school site. A fully functioning school includes all SFAs. However, leaders can choose to begin with any one of the\n\nSFAs and build out to all other SFAs to complete the LEEAAPS process.\n\nDuring the coaching component, an\n\neducation leader is guided through\n\nthe four phases of LSI using the SFAs. However, school leadership teams and\n\ndistrict personal also use the SFAs to\n\nelevate educators to address challenge\n\nareas or areas of needed support after\n\nassessing school performance indicators. rough the process of leadership coaching conversations, LEEAAPS results from the SFAs provide the basis for identifying and building on school strengths that foster progress. A coach emphasizes identi ed strengths for beginning and sustaining work on areas needing improvement. Leaders and teams are learner-centered and learner-focused, working toward continuous and sustained e ectiveness improvement. Coaches encourage leaders\n\nto see that earnestly envisioning success is more than half the battle. School leaders must inspire excellence by helping sta to envision the ultimate. e LEEAAPS Model for e ective school improvement is a form of Education Diplomacy that uses a cooperative, collaborative, and collegial systemic approach to solve educationâs greatest challenges at school and district levels using a positive, impactful means of intervention.\n\nA leadership team at an American International School in Asia chose to work on SFA One: Vision, Mission, and School Values after complaints from the parent community that the American families living overseas were not choosing to send their children\n\nto the school due to lack of public school vision and leadership.

Murphy\n\nChildhood Education International\n\nWithin the context of 2030 development agenda and the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), school leaders are critical stakeholders for development. Achievement of the SDG agenda requires collaboration and partnership across all stakeholders and sectors. As a focal point for collaboration within their schools and stewards\n\nfor education among families and communities, school leaders need a new set of diplomacy skills that allows them to better meet the challenges they face and ensure inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning for all.\n\nMarch/April 2019 21\n\nP:24\n\n22\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nFostering and developing e ective school leaders has become an important part of education reforms worldwide.1 A critical element of e ective school leadership is the ability to forge and maintain collaborative working relationships within schools as well\n\nas across the wider community. is requires both an intellectual approach to positioning school leaders within the broader policy-setting for education and development and a practical e ort to develop and strengthen partnerships.\n\nWhile the renewed focus on the need to support school leaders with training programs, at both pre-service and in-service levels, that incorporate coaching and mentoring2 is commendable, increased attention should also be directed to the content of these training programs. Are school leaders being provided with intellectual and practical guidance that will help them understand and execute their roles in the education and development system? When designed correctly, school leadership training programs can enhance the e ective practices\n\nof leaders.3 Education Diplomacy, a concept developed by the Association for Childhood Education International (ACEI), provides\n\nboth a conceptual and practical framework\n\nfor helping school leaders understand and develop the collaborative competencies to more e ectively complete their work.\n\nis article recognizes school leaders as critical stakeholders for development and proposes that Education Diplomacy is a useful approach for understanding as well as facilitating\n\nschool leadership within the paradigm of global sustainable development. Education Diplomacy is an innovative approach to education sector advancement that has two key goals: 1) promoting and positioning education as having key intrinsic and instrumental\n\nvalue, and 2) fostering e ective and e cient cooperation, coordination, and collaboration for managing and solving education challenges. Education Diplomacyâs focus on collaboration as a key strategy for achieving education outcomes matches the imperative for school leadership to embrace collaborative approaches, particularly in a development setting that\n\nemphasizes partnerships and engagement within and beyond the education sector.\n\nSustainable Development and Education Leadership\n\nEducation Diplomacy played an important role in placing education as a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the inclusion of Education SDG 4,\n\nwhich identi es a set of targets for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning. Adopted by world leaders in 2015, the SDG agenda is a broad and comprehensive framework that attempts to structure the multiple and interconnected elements that contribute to a better quality\n\nof life for all. e new agenda calls for\n\nbalance among the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of development and asserts that they should be jointly considered and pursued in all initiatives. Education SDG 4 has 10 targets covering di erent aspects of education, and education is also mentioned\n\nin the context of health (SDG 3), economic growth and employment (SDG 8), and climate change (SDG 13). Although not explicitly mentioned in the other SDGs, education is also central to the alleviation of poverty and achieving gender equality, reduced inequalities, and peace and justice.\n\nA key feature of the SDG agenda is its emphasis on viewing development as a\n\nholistic undertaking that requires input\n\nand involvement from all stakeholders and sectors. is perspective re ects a rejection\n\nof the single-sector or âsiloedâ approaches to development that characterized the framework of the Millennium Development Goals,\n\nthe development agenda that preceded the SDGs from 2000-2015. Such approaches were deemed to be ine ective, as they did not account for the impact one area of policy has on other policy sectors, they did not involve the full range of stakeholders necessary to build a complete picture of the development problem and craft an appropriate and feasible solution, and they did not fully account for the ways in which actions taken at one level of governance are shaped by other levels.\n\nP:25\n\nFor More Reading . . .\n\nPracticing Community-Based Leadership\n\nBy Kathryn Fishman-Weaver\n\nSix strategies administrators can\n\nuse to encourage everyone from students on up to be leaders in their schools and districts.\n\nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/ practicing-community-based- leadership\n\nIn contrast, the 2030 SDG framework emphasizes that the goals, targets, and means of implementation are âuniversal, indivisible and interlinkedâ (Article 71). e new\n\nagenda enshrines this indivisibility through a speci c goal for partnerships at all levels and across all sectors (SDG 17). is has renewed consideration of which actors need to work with whom, and in what ways, to successfully achieve the vision of the agenda. It also invites consideration of new and di erent spaces and opportunities for interaction and collaboration.\n\nIn response to the integrated imperative of\n\nthe new sustainable development agenda, it is proposed that education leaders understand an âintegrated planningâ approach to education and development.4 In this framework, integration can be viewed âhorizontally,â meaning how di erent policy sectors work together (e.g., education, health, and social protection); âvertically,â meaning how di erent levels of government are coordinated (e.g., national level actors with district-level and school-level actors); and âlaterally,â meaning how di erent types of stakeholders collaborate (e.g., state and non-state actors, or schools with private, business, or community-based entities). An integrated planning approach prompts consideration of how all three\n\nThe One Thing Innovative School Leaders Should Do Before School Ends\n\nBy Jason Green\n\nLearn about the strategy called âgenerativityâ (and four simple associated steps) that can lay the groundwork for growth.\n\nhttps://www.gettingsmart. com/2018/06/the-one-thing-innovative- school-leaders-should-do-before- school-ends/\n\ndimensions of integrationâhorizontal, vertical, and lateralâinteract, and invites education stakeholders to consider their roles and positions within this integrated platform.\n\nFrom the perspective of education leadership, each of us, in our di erent capacities within the education sector, must consider how we can work together to contribute to this joint project of sustainable development. As we do so, we will need to develop the appropriate skills and competencies to reach across boundaries and sectors and forge e ective relationships and partnerships as we pursue joint approaches.\n\nSchool Leadership and Collaboration\n\nWithin the education ecosystem, school leaders are recognized as critical for ensuring inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning within the institutions they build\n\nand shape. While the extent and nature of responsibilities falling to school leaders varies across education systems and contexts, the expectations are immense in any setting. School leaders are tasked in many cases with both system management and instructional leadership. Collaboration is a key element that underpins many of these responsibilities of school leadership.\n\nMarch/April 2019 23\n\nP:26\n\n24\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nWithin the schools they manage, school leaders are expected to foster collaborative work\n\nand relationships among sta , and between sta and students. Creating collaborative frameworks and strong working relationships among sta is considered a key strategy for improving instructional leadership.5 Such\n\na relationship requires a common vision and goal for success, and the structures to share resources, ideas, and provide coherent approaches to instruction. is type of collaborative approach and culture has been linked to gains in school e ectiveness and student achievement.6\n\nSchool leaders are responsible for setting\n\nthe tone and vision of the school and are\n\nheld accountable for student learning and outcomes.7 e type of school leadership provided in uences the entire organizational culture of the school environment.8 School leaders are also responsible for overseeing administrative functions and the maintenance upkeep of schools. Models of âcollaborative leadershipâ within schools point to the bene ts of expanding the notion of leadership from one focusing on a sole principal or head- teacher to a networked approach that views vice-principals, or deputies, and heads of department and teachers as contributors\n\nto a form of âdistributed leadership.â9 Collaboration among school leaders in such a way is another indication of the need to work together.\n\nLooking beyond the school, school leaders are expected to view students holistically and, in recognition of the diverse student supports needed, to collaborate with other community stakeholders, including those involved in health, nutrition, and welfare. School leaders forge relationships with many di erent types of actors, including parents and community organizations or other entities that can help create a system of support around students that extends beyond academics. Working with di erent stakeholders is also important in fortifying the schoolâs resource base, building its relationship with the community and contributing to its sustainability. Building connections between schools and communities has been a key focus of school leadership;\n\nwith a sustainable development agenda lens, it becomes even more important to consider the schoolâs linkages to both its local and global environments.\n\nIn many countries, decentralization e orts, and associated increases in school autonomy, have augmented the roles and powers of school leaders. In discharging their roles and responsibilities, school leaders operate within varied organizational settings as well as a nested governance framework, with policies and di erent tiers of government shaping\n\ntheir autonomy, accountability, and access to resources. School leaders navigate relationships with school-level bodies, such as boards and Parent-Teacher Associations, district education\n\nSchools can leverage their own resources and those of other sectors to create synergies that can improve education delivery and development as a whole. This highlights the need for school leaders to think widely\n\nand creatively about potential collaborative stakeholders.\n\nP:27\n\nauthorities, local governments, and national education actors. ese various entities and individuals require di erentiated strategies and approaches for successful engagement, highlighting the need for school leaders\n\nto acquire the appropriate skill set and competencies to forge e ective relationships across multiple stakeholders.\n\ne SDG agenda augments this already considerable portfolio of school leaders by opening space for school leaders to renew their consideration of how they work with others to achieve outcomes, and to re-consider their role in supporting the wider agenda of sustainable development. e focus on learning outcomes in the SDG education agenda creates pressure on school leaders to embrace âlearning- centered leadershipâ10 and re-examine their role in creating the conditions that support strong student achievement.\n\nAttention is also being paid to the ways\n\nin which the education sectorâand schoolsâcan leverage their own resources and those of other policy sectors to create synergies that can improve education\n\ndelivery and development as a whole. is highlights the need for school leaders to\n\nthink widely and creatively about potential collaborative stakeholders who may not be part of the traditionally de ned âeducation sector.â For example, schools face the challenge of maximizing use of physical school infrastructure in rapidly urbanizing environments where space is a premium and sustainability is a key consideration.11 Schools also must accommodate increasing numbers of students, while being mindful of their roles in providing a space for inclusion, cohesion, and engagement with wider sustainability issues in urban settings. ese multiple considerations bring schools, and school leaders, into relationships with a number of di erent sectors and stakeholders, including urban and municipal planners, architects,\n\nor environmental interest groups. Clearly, the sphere of school leadership is rapidly expanding within a dynamic and increasingly interconnected development paradigm.\n\nIn uences on the Abilities of School Leaders to Lead\n\nis articleâs brief consideration of the\n\nwide array of school leadersâ important responsibilities supports the contention that an e ective school leader must be of superhero status to manage the multiple competing demands for strong direction and leadership.\n\nHowever, the ability of school leaders to provide e ective leadership is mediated by\n\na number of factors, including personal characteristics, political in uences, institutional contexts, and socio-cultural settings. e nature of school leadership varies across di erent social and cultural contexts, and across and within countries. In particular, resource-constrained settings in the global South are often characterized by limited autonomy or autocratic leadership tendencies that can undermine e orts at collaboration.12 In such cases, the uncritical transfer of Anglo- centric ideas and concepts may not be useful.13\n\nSchool leaders across the world operate in vastly di erent settings related to policies, budgets, responsibilities, school and student characteristics, expectations, and available resources. e understanding and practice of âleadershipâ di ers in important ways across di erent cultures and contexts.14\n\nResearch on how to build cohesive systems that support school leadership points to the need for well-coordinated policies and initiatives that address leadership standards, training,\n\nand conditions faced by principals (Augustine et al., 2009). Strategies identi ed that help to build this cohesion include developing trust, creating networks, fostering communication, exerting pressure and in uence, promoting quality of leadership policies, building capacity, identifying strong leaders, and connecting to other reform e orts.15\n\nIt is clear that many elements and in uences contribute to the outcomes of collaborative ventures, but this article advances the critical role of the individuals who are part of and lead these processes. e management and\n\nMarch/April 2019 25\n\nP:28\n\n26\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nSchool leaders will nd Education Diplomacy to be a helpful guide in creating both an analytical and operational approach to stakeholder engagement.\n\nleadership skills required of individuals who are increasingly being tasked with moving out of traditionally hierarchical structures\n\nto spearhead and manage cross-sector collaborations are complex.16 Focusing on the skill set and competencies that school leaders have for discharging their responsibilities is a critical element in providing e ective school leadership.\n\nEducation Diplomacy and Its Value for Supporting School Leaders Education Diplomacy, as the name suggests, incorporates perspectives and practices from the eld of diplomacy into the advancement of the education sector. e âdiplomacyâ dimension of Education Diplomacy asserts\n\nthe need for greater cooperation within the education sector and across the sector, urging consideration of education sector issues as important ideals to be shared, communicated, and promoted. is aligns with a key responsibility of school leaders to promote their schools and the education sector at large as important features of development to be valued and supported by external stakeholders within the community. School leaders in many ways act as ambassadors for their schools and students, working to identify how they can advance education priorities and leverage\n\nresources through collaboration with other sectors and actors. ey understand the need to build partnerships and balance diverse perspectives and needs.\n\nSchool leaders who currently work within the system to pursue these objectives understand very clearly how challenging it is to build and maintain these partnerships. Many challenges will be encountered during collaboration, including the time it takes, establishing open lines of communication, overcoming inherent and organizationally cultivated territorialism, managing di erent expectations, navigating varying organizational structures and values, and working with di erent personalities.\n\nEven when collaboration is agreed upon, implementation of a collaborative initiative or working relationship can be stymied by poor decisions related to the collaborative structure, procedures, and practices.\n\nIntegrated Planning and Education Diplomacy\n\nWorking together to achieve outcomes, at the school and other levels, requires a carefully developed approach and skill set. Education Diplomacy is rooted in the study and practice of the diplomatic eld and provides a framework within which school leaders can understand and practice collaboration.\n\nConceptually, it is useful to recall the horizontal, vertical, and lateral dimensions\n\nof the integrated planning approach, which school leaders can use to locate the role of school leadership in the wider development setting. Education Diplomacy, then, helps to position school leaders within the integrated framework of sectors and actors working together across various levels. Education Diplomacy prompts education stakeholders\n\nto analyze their own positionality, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as to map the opportunities provided from other stakeholders and sectors for collaboration toward common goals. School leaders will nd Education Diplomacy to be a helpful guide in creating both an analytical and operational approach to stakeholder engagement.\n\nP:29\n\nFurther, the Education Diplomacy model provides a practical approach to building the skills and competencies of individual school leaders, enhancing their ability to analyze and solve education challenges that incorporate multi-sector and multi-stakeholder dimensions. e Education Diplomacy â5Lâ framework (www.educationdiplomacy.org/)developed by ACEI provides a comprehensive and process- oriented approach for applying Education Diplomacy principles. Key Education Diplomacy skills and competencies that\n\nare embedded into this framework include: communication, building trust and mutual respect, exploring in uence and persuasion, managing power dynamics, fostering consensus and compromise, and negotiation techniques. ese are some of the most important skills that education practitioners need to e ectively solve complex problems and create strong and e ective partnerships with di erent sectors and multiple stakeholders at local, national, and international levels.\n\nIt is not enough to encourage school\n\nleaders to forge collaborative relationships without adequate attention to whether or not they have the abilities to e ectively\n\ndo so. Education Diplomacy is built on a recognition of diverse cultures, perspectives, and settings, and is customizable to di erent contexts. e Education Diplomacy skill\n\nset provides a structure for thinking about individual school leadership settings and\n\na skill set for school leaders that facilitates development of unique collaborative approaches to problems.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Schleicher, A.

The goal of inclusion is complex, and so it is critically important to prepare teachers to lead organizational change that will increase engagement and achievement of children with diverse learning abilities.\n\nEmer Ring and Lisha OâSullivan\n\nMary Immaculate College, Limerick University, Ireland\n\nMarch/April 2019 29\n\nP:32\n\nTeacher education for inclusion from preschool and beyond continues to challenge education systems globally and prompts us to consider innovative solutions to ensure the diverse learners in our early childhood settings are enabled to achieve their full potential. e success of teacher education for inclusion will be measured by the extent to which diversity is considered the norm rather than the exception in our preschools and schools. e literature suggests that e ective inclusion is complex\n\nand is associated with a strong government commitment, adequate resourcing, inter- governmental collaboration, a responsive teacher education continuum, ongoing stakeholder consultation, an understanding of the complexity of inclusion, and consistent internal and external evaluation processes.1\n\nIn 1994, Ireland was one of 92 governments and 25 international organizations subscribing to the Salamanca Statement, which asserted that access to mainstream schools must be provided for all children with special educational needs.2 e Salamanca Statement also identi ed a\n\nneed for investment in early identi cation\n\nand intervention, in addition to systemic change in teacher education. Critically, it was noted that the success of the inclusive school\n\nwas dependent to a large degree on early identi cation, assessment, and stimulation of young children. A presumption in favor of providing for all children in inclusive elementary and high school settings was subsequently a rmed in a wide range of legislation.\n\nAccess to preschool education for children with diverse needs in Ireland, while clearly in uenced by international developments, is also characterized by economic, political, and social factors distinctively related to the Irish context. Ireland is a relatively ânewâ state in historical terms, having achieved its independence only in 1922. Compulsory elementary school starting age in Ireland is 6 years old; however, due to a custom and practice legacy, children in Ireland may start elementary school as young as 4 years old.3\n\nFrom the foundation of the state until very recently, government investment focused almost exclusively on elementary education, to the detriment of preschool education. is led to the emergence of a costly and primarily private preschool system. In January 2010, concerned about alleviating the costs of preschool for parents, the government introduced a universal free preschool scheme for all children from age 3\n\n30\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nFigure 1. National Framework of Quali cations in Ireland\n\nP:33\n\nto 6 for one year, subsequently adding a second free year in 2016.1 In order to ensure that all children were provided with access to preschool, the government also introduced the Better\n\nStart Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) in 2016.4 Twenty-four years after the governmentâs articulation of a commitment to inclusion\n\nin the context of the Salamanca Statement, these principles are nally beginning to inform policy and practice at the preschool level through combining a universal and targeted approach to inclusion. A central element of this universal approach is providing for quali ed and competent early childhood teachers.\n\nis article reports on the Better Start\n\nAIM and an innovative, award-winning, competency-based blended continuing professional development (CPD) learning program, the Leadership for INClusion in\n\nthe Early Years (LINC) program, initiated in 2016, to be delivered to 4,000 early childhood teachers over a four-year period, as an integral element of the universal component of the AIM. e current data emerging from an interim evaluation of the LINC program suggest that this innovative model of teacher education presents extensive possibilities in relation to teacher education for inclusion in the early years globally.\n\nNecessity for a Continuing Professional Development Learning Program in Inclusion\n\nResearch, both internationally and nationally in Ireland, con rms that high-quality early intervention for children with diverse needs, provided by quali ed and competent teachers, is critical. However, until recently, successive governments in Ireland had failed to prioritize the targeting of resources for the development of initial early childhood teacher education programs and supportive inclusive preschool services. A recent report commissioned\n\nby the government indicates that while improvements in the quali cations of early childhood teachers are evident, considerable scope for development remains.5 e National Framework of Quali cations in Ireland (NFQ)6 (see Figure 1) provides an overview\n\nof quali cations (e.g., a level 7 quali cation indicates an ordinary bachelor degree and\n\na level 8 quali cation indicates an honorâs bachelor degree).\n\nAll elementary school teachers in Ireland are required to hold a Level 8 quali cation. At\n\nthe preschool level, managers are required to hold a minimum Level 7 quali cation and sta working with children are required to hold a minimum Level 5 or 6 quali cation, depending on their assigned role in the setting. is has led to a diversity of quali cations\n\nheld by sta who are working directly with preschool children (see Figure 2).\n\ne diverse pro le of educators working\n\nwith children at the preschool level therefore presents challenges in relation to ensuring that all educators have the requisite knowledge(s), practices, and values7 to ensure the e ective inclusion of children with diverse abilities at\n\nthe preschool level. âKnowledge(s)â is used\n\nto capture the nature of knowledge as wide- ranging, rather than a single entity, which continues to emerge through a process of co-construction with children, families, communities, early childhood teachers, researchers, and policymakers. Practices are more complex than skills, due to their purposefulness and the requirement for the educator to\n\nengage in ongoing critical re ection prior\n\nto, during, and after practice. Finally, values\n\ngo beyond attitudes in requiring articulation\n\nby the educator. e government, therefore,\n\nwas concerned about ensuring all preschool educators were provided with an opportunity\n\nto develop the requisite knowledge(s), practices, and values to provide e ectively for children with diverse needs at the preschool level. In that context, the Better Start AIM was launched in 2015, and the innovative teacher-education LINC program is an integral part.\n\nThe Better Start Access and Inclusion Model\n\ne Better Start AIM is based on national and international research evidence related\n\nto ensuring that all children with additional needs can access inclusive preschool education.\n\nMarch/April 2019 31\n\nP:34\n\nyear and 11% in 2015/16. The year-on-year changes in respect of sta quali cations are presented in Figure 7.10.\n\nFigure 7.10 Sta working directly with children â percentage by highest level of quali cation in 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1.3%\n\n12%\n\n5%\n\n13%\n\n14.2%\n\n6%\n\n6.4%\n\n38%\n\n43%\n\n43.1%\n\n32%\n\n29%\n\n28.6%\n\n11%\n\n7%\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n.4%\n\nNFQ Level 9/10 NFQ Level 8 NFQ Level 7 NFQ Level 6 NFQ Level 5 NFQ Level 4\n\nNo EY quali cation\n\n32\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\n2015/16\n\n2016/17\n\n2017/18\n\n5\n\nFigure U2.nQdeurathli ecCahtioldncsaoref (pEraerslcy hYoeaorlseSdeurcviacetos)rsRwegourklaintigondsireActtl(y2w01it6h)c, ahlildsrtea n working\n\ndirectly with children must hold a minimum of a NFQ Level 5 quali cation, as of December 31st 2016. The legislation exempts those who signed the so-called Grandfather Declaration (as discussed in Section 7.10.4). The introduction of the legislation continues to have an impact on the level of sta quali cations, as the proportion of sta with an NFQ Level 5 quali cation or above has continuously risen (see Figure 7.11).\n\nFigure 3. The Access and Inclusion Model8\n\ne cross-government model in Figure 3 was developed following extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including the parents of children with additional needs. In accordance with best practice, the seven- level model adopts a child-centered approach by focusing on identifying and responding\n\nto each individual childâs developmental level, abilities, and needs, rather than relying exclusively on formal diagnoses.\n\ne seven levels of support range from universal (Levels 1-3) to targeted supports (Levels 4-7) based on the needs of the individual child. While each of the levels is presented in the model separately, they are inextricably linked, and this deliberate linkage emerges as a key strength of the model. Level 1 is considered the foundation for the model and advises that a strong culture of inclusion be fostered and embedded in order to optimize\n\nP:35\n\nWorking in partnership with parents and outside agencies\n\nPrinciples of an Inclusive Culture\n\nActively promoting equal opportunities for all families and children\n\nAdhering to the universal and targeted principles of support in the AIM\n\nRecognizing and valuing the uniqueness of each child\n\nRe ecting on your own attitudes and values\n\nHaving robust inclusive policies and procedures\n\nFigure 4. Principles of an inclusive preschool culture9\n\neach childâs learning and development. e concept of inclusion underpinning the model is described as a process involving a program, curriculum, or educational environment,\n\nwhere each child is welcomed and included\n\non equal terms, feels they belong, and can progress to achieving his/her full potential in all areas of development.9 In essence, inclusion is conceptualized as creating a space for children, families, and sta where diversity is the norm. e principles of an inclusive culture are speci cally identi ed (see Figure 4).\n\ne e ectiveness of Level 1 is closely related to the provision of information for parents and providers at Level 2 and the necessity\n\nof developing a quali ed and competent workforce that can con dently meet the needs of all children at Level 3. Levels 4 to 7 of the Better Start AIM are concerned with the provision of targeted support. A team of early years specialists, based in the Better Start\n\nNational Early Years Quality Development Service, has been appointed to provide expert advice, mentoring, and support to ensure inclusion of children with additional needs. Levels 5-7 allow for preschool settings to secure equipment, therapeutic intervention, and additional assistance.\n\nConcerned about progressing Level 3, in tandem with the launch of the Better Start AIM in 2015, the government issued a\n\nrequest for tenders, inviting proposals for the development and delivery of a blended CPD program that would provide educators with the requisite knowledge(s), practices, and skills to e ectively include children with diverse needs in preschool settings. A consortium\n\nled by Mary Immaculate College (MIC), University of Limerick, and including Early Childhood Ireland (the national membership organization for early childhood education and care [ECEC]) and Maynooth University,\n\nActively engaging children in decision- making that affects them\n\nMarch/April 2019 33\n\nP:36\n\n34\n\nChildhood Education: Innovations\n\nwas subsequently awarded the contract for the LINC program. Successful graduates of the program are awarded a Level 6 quali cation on the NFQ and qualify to be appointed as INclusion COordinators (INCOs) in their preschool settings. All preschool settings where an INCO has been appointed are entitled to increased government capitation for each child in the setting.\n\nThe Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years Program: An Overview e LINC program commenced in September 2016 and provides for 900 students each year over a four-year period. Delivered in nine regional centers by expert tutors through\n\na blended format, comprising face-to-face classroom-based sessions and online delivery, the program is aligned with national and international early childhood curricula and is embedded in the indicators of high-quality early childhood summarized in Figure 5. e program rejects the concept of âdisorderâ in favor of âdi erence,â conceptualizes diversity as the norm rather than the exception, promotes\n\nchild agency, and maintains a focus on listening to, and responding to, the voice of the child.\n\ne LINC program equips early childhood teachers with the knowledge(s), practices, and values to support participation of children with additional needs in the early years. In particular, the program focuses on preparing participants to adopt a leadership role within preschool settings to help them support and lead other sta in the setting to plan for, implement, and review inclusive culture, practice, and pedagogy. Prior to developing the program modules, the consortium identi ed key competencies (see Figure 6) associated with cultivating e ective inclusive culture, practices, and pedagogy. ese competencies emerged as inter-connected rather than mutually exclusive.\n\ne principles articulated in Figures 4 and\n\n5 and the competencies identi ed in Figure\n\n6 underpin six program modules: Child Development, Inclusive Concepts and Strategies, Curriculum for Inclusion, Leadership for Inclusion, Promoting Collaborative Practice,\n\nKnowledge of How Young Children Learn\n\nKnowledge and Understanding of Curriculum\n\nand Professional Portfolio. e online interface incorporates best practice in instructional design related to cohesive program structure, the identi cation of clear learning objectives, e ective learning theory, academic excellence, and pedagogical strategies designed to optimize engagement in a multi-media environment.\n\nA multi-faceted approach\n\nto assessment is adopted throughout the program and includes an exploration of practice-based case studies, multiple-choice questions, essays, and a portfolio. All students\n\non the program also receive a mentoring visit from their expert tutor, who supports them in re ecting on the competencies for inclusion as outlined in Figure 6. ese re ections\n\nSupporting\n\nChildren in Resolving Con icts\n\nAssisting Parents in\n\nProviding Learning Interactions at Home\n\nQuality of Adult-Child Verbal Interactions\n\nFigure 5.

While students in the program are, most likely, highly motivated to engage\n\nin CPD, which will support their e orts to lead inclusive culture, practice, and pedagogy, motivation alone is unlikely to sustain engagement. e design and delivery of the program are critical if students are to remain engaged as they progress on their learning journey with LINC. e design and delivery of the LINC program incorporates those aspects of CPD programs previously identi ed as improving early years education quality: active participation, focus on theory and its application, opportunities for feedback and re ection, and opportunities for classroom observations and feedback.13 e content of the program engages students with up-to-\n\ndate national and international theoretical perspectives and places a strong emphasis on the application of theory to practice. rough on-line and face-to-face platforms, students have numerous opportunities to receive feedback from the expert team of LINC tutors. Re ective practice is an integral component of the program and the on-site visit from LINC program tutors provides an all-important opportunity to receive feedback on practice. A key aim of the LINC program is that graduates will be equipped to lead inclusion as INCOs in their preschool settings. So far, data from the evaluation suggest that graduates feel the programâs content and process of learning is equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to lead organizational change that\n\nThe success of teacher education for inclusion will be measured by the extent to which diversity is considered the norm rather than the exception\n\nwill increase engagement and achievement of children with diverse learning abilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the LINC evaluation is still in an initial stage, emerging ndings suggest that the program presents an opportunity to make a real di erence for society, families, children, and teachers. Critically, the high levels of satisfaction articulated by teachers indicate that blended learning programs that take cognizance of professional competencies for e ective inclusive practice can contribute signi cantly to teacher education for inclusion globally.\n\nHigh-quality preschool education is associated with a range of positive outcomes for all learn- ers, and initial teacher education (ITE) and CPD are recognized as being strong predictors of high-quality programming.10 ITE and CPD have previously been associated with adult-child interactions that promote emotional warmth and security in addition to appropriate learning challenge.13, 14 At the policy level, measures such as raising minimum quali cation levels in early childhood education to bachelorâs degree requirements are often seen as impera- tive to continuing improvement of preschool education quality. Degree level training, how- ever, may not be accessible to those already working in early childhood education, is costly, and can serve to further rise the cost of early childhood education.14 Moreover, initial bachelorâs level programs may not adequately equip graduates for highly skilled and com- plex roles, such as leading inclusion. High-\n\nP:41\n\nquality CPD programs play an important\n\nrole in improving quality, particularly when such programs emphasize active participation, focus on theory and its application, provide opportunities for feedback and re ection,\n\nand incorporate opportunities for classroom observations and feedback.13 Given its po- tential to improve the quality of program culture, practice, and pedagogy, LINC o ers an empirically based, cost-e ective approach to improving early childhood education ex- perience for all children and contributes to the creation of early childhood spaces where diversity becomes the norm. It also presents a powerful path to truly achieving the equality and inclusion which, 24 years ago, when sub- scribing to the Salamanca Statement, was but an aspiration.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Ring, E., Daly, P., & Wall, E.

Children have abundant online âfriends,â yet they rarely truly engage\n\nin meaningful dialogue. Despite these\n\nvirtual connections and ready access to news through Internet sources, many students learn about people of other cultures only through textbooks or headlines and not through direct discussion. Given recent refugee crises and talk of building walls, it seems crucial that we encourage children to engage fully in dialogue across cultures and borders with an aim to building a more global citizenry.\n\nFor the past few years, children from all over the world have been able to participate in a global dialogue fostered by a technological innovation called Portals. Using a network of gold shipping containers placed in schools, colleges, refugee camps, and city squares, children and young adults enter these spaces and use an Internet video connection to meet face to face, in real timeâtalking, dancing, singing, eating, painting, drawing, and even âdabbingâ with one another.\n\nDuring the fall of 2016, Greenwich Academy in Connecticut became the rst K-12 school to host a Portal, an experience that was transformative for students and faculty alike. Portals is the brain child of entrepreneurs Amar Bakshi and Michelle Moghtader, both of whom spent years as reporters in the Middle East. Seeking to capture in real time the poignant moments they experienced when the cameras and microphones were turned o , they created the multi-disciplinary arts, design, and technology collective Shared_Studios. Bakshiâs other motive was to create a space where his Pakistani grandmother, who longed for simple conversations with people in the land she ed after Partition, could chat about nothing in particularâe ectively having a cup\n\nKristen Erickson\n\nGreenwich Academy\n\nof tea with a friend in a foreign land. With\n\nthe goal of creating âwormholesâ through the Internet, Bakshi created the rst Portal in his Washington, D.C., backyard. Unfortunately, his grandmother died before the Portal was realized, and so the rst connection was actually to Iran. When he put up a sign reading âPortal to Tehran,â his neighbors called the FBI. Nevertheless, Bakshi was undeterred.\n\nToday, the Portal network has expanded into dozens of locations around the globe, fostering thousands of conversations. With the help of on-site curators and translators in countries as far ranging as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Mexico, Honduras, Rwanda, Myanmar, and the United States, Portal connections have quietly fostered that most elusive of goals: empathy. Itâs no wonder these gold boxes have been described by one journalist as âempathy infrastructure.â1\n\nAt Greenwich Academy, we chose to place\n\nthe gold shipping container adjacent to our oldest building, a former Rockefeller mansion with a Greek-revival portico. e e ect was a disruption in our traditional school dayâas children passed the âgold boxâ on their way into school, their curiosity was piqued. rough the Portal, we e ectively invited strangers to engage virtually in our campus space.\n\ne power of Portals lies in the immediacy\n\nof the connection and the simplicity of the medium. Visitors step inside a shipping container to nd a grey, carpeted interior and face someone thousands of miles away in a similar space, thus eliminating external context and creating a sense of being in the same room. A Portal connection can initially feel uncomfortable, because it is so direct; facing\n\na stranger in another country, one develops a heightened awareness of non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, facial expressions, and stance.\n\nA traditional Portal engagement lasts for 20 minutes and begins with a universal prompt: âWhat would make today a good day for you?â Few exercises create such an immediate sense of the di erent scale of values that exist around the world.\n\nMarch/April 2019 41\n\nP:44\n\n42 Childhood Education: Innovations\n\nW"
