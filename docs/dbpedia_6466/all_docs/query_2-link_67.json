CONTRIBUTIONS TO A MORE EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATRACHIA. No. iii. Bt J. J. Fletcher. This third small contribution records the collections which have come to hand since June last. The subject is not by any means exhausted ; but as there is no immediate prospect of further supplies of material, the results so far gained may presently be briefly reviewed ; and with this, for the time being, one must be coutent. (ii.) The inland division of N,S. W. ( West of the Dividing Rcmge). (r) From Lucknow, near Orange (collected by Mr. W. W. Fioggatt). Limnodynastes tasmaniensis ffyperolia niarmorata dorsalis Pseicdophryne bihronii Uyla ewingii, var. B. Only one species in this collection calls for comment, namely //. eivtngii, var. B (eleven 8|)ecimena), characterised, as to most of the Rpecimens, by the presence of even more spots and markings on the flanks and elsewhere than in var. A (calliscdis) and than I have ever previously seen. This is the first time, too, that the s})ecies has occurred in any of the collections from the inland division, and it is probably to be regarded as a straggler from the coast. Further references to these specimens will be found below. (s) From Wellington Caves (collected by Mr. W. W. Froggatt). Limnodynastes tasmaniensis Pseudopkryne bibronii OEOQRAPIIIC .

Livinodynasies t(zsmaniemi€ Paevdophryne coriacea Crinia ngni/era Hyla lesueurti Uyperolia marmorata latopalmata Fifty-seven living specimens were kindly forwarded in an ingeniously contrived vivarium by Mr. A. J. Ewen, through the kind mediation of Mr. R. Etheridge, junr., of the Department of Mines. In this collection the burrowers are conspicuously absent ; and there are no peculiar Queensland species ; but it is noticeable how inland, as well as on the coast, in about this latitude, P. coriacea seems to have more or less completely replaced P, bibrofiii, so common further south (recorded by me from eight inland stations, besides Bonalla and Ballarat in the southern colony) : otherwise, as far as it goes, it is a fairly typical inland collection. A somewhat more extended and definite knowledge of the geographical distribution of Australian Batrachians appearing to be desirable, the best way of making a beginning seemed to be to obtain from as many localities as possible, more particularly «xtra-co«stAl ones, as complete collections as could be got together, and then to record them. Thanks very largely to a number of friends, to whom I freely acknowledge my indebtedness, a start for N.S W. has been made. Collections from seven coastal stations (in this case rather districts), and from seventeen inland stations — besides four others from which single specimens or specimens of a single species are recorded, circumstances not allowing of collections being made — have been got together, comprising several hundred individuals, and in some cases form- ing good series. Collections from stations on the South Coast, on the Northern Tablelands, and especially on the Darling, and still further west, are, however, still desiderata ; and I should be very glad indeed to receive such, or promises of co-operation in obtaining them. 10 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATRACHIA, Every collection recorded, doubtless only more or less, and some- times even very, incompletely represents the batrachiau fauna of the particular locality whence it came. More particularly was this the case when the collectors were unprepared for burrowers, and when the collecting was not continued over a sufficiently long period, preferably over several seasons. In an interesting paper on \" The Distribution of Fresh- water Fishes *'* in Amei ica, Professor Jordan says : \" It is easy to ascertnin the more common inhabitants of any given streamT. It is difficult, however, to obtain negative results which are really results. You cannot often say that a s|iecies does not live in a certain stream. You can only affirm that you have not yet found it there ; and you can rarely fish in a stream so long that you can find nothing that you have not taken befora\" If in this extract for the words \" stream \" and \" fish,\" wherever such occur, we substitute the words ** district\" and \"collect,\" we shall have the case not le^s admirably stated as regards Batrachians. In spite of the difficulties in the way of getting even approxi- mately complete collections, and in acquiring negative evidence of value, and though many desirable localities are still untouched, already certain conclusions, which further knowledge may extend but cannot otherwise very materially alter, may at this stage quite legitimately be drawn. It is quite evident that batrachians are to be found in the interior wherever the conditions allow of their existing, not only near the rivers, but at a distance from these wiierever there are lakes, lagoons, or swamps, even though these are not always absolutely proof against frequent or long continued droughts. A newspaper reporter qui^e recently accompanying a Minister of the Crown on a journey to the Bogau just after the breaking-up of a dry season thus describes what he saw between Warren and Coonamble, N.S.W. : \"The scenery was of the monotonous order peculiar to the plain country. There were great bare patches of miles in extent without a living thing to be seen except a few * Trans. American Fisheries Society, 1888, p. 4. BT J. J.

The country is indented here and there with shallow depressions in the earth, which are filled with water after the rains, and sometimes form chains of ponds across the counti-y.\" At Emu Plains, some eighteen miles from the Murrumbidgee, Mr. Sloaiie has been good enough to collect for me ; in this locality there are swamps, but they dry up every year about December, or ezce|)tionally a month or two later ; in fact there is no perma- nent water except in the station dams ; nevertheless frogs are not scarce ; and though my friend is a busy man, and natural history tastes in quite another direction occupy his leisure, yet just about the homestead he has been able to collect seven species — only one less than the number at present recorded from Tasmania (Ilyla verreaiixii not being regarded as a distinct species). Here, as elsewhere, provided only that the frogs cnn live out the more or less lengthy perif ds of aestivation, in some years more trying than in others, the ponds after rain, wherever the soil is not too sandy, are at times sufficiently |>ermanent and sufficiently numerous, formin? chains of ponds across the country as quoted above, to afibrd a means whereby batrachians may be enabled to migrate from places where they have become established, and so to gain new stations ; or to re-people the old haunts should excessively dry seasons prove utterly disastrous. The possibility of spawn *>eing carried to distant localities on the feet of aquatic birds need not be left out of consideration ; but I imagine the means of «Hs{>ersal mentioned to be of j)rime importance, and that the great river-system of the interior of the colony is the main source of distribution and refdenishment. Secondly, whenever anything at all like a fairly characteriKtic collection is obtained, it will be found to comprise representatives of all three dominant Australian families. This is exemplified over and over again in the larger collections recorded. Out of about fifty-four kiiowu Australian species New South Wales may be credited with about thirty-four, of which four [l^jfla jervisetisis, II, dimolops^ II. nasuta, and Hylella bicolor\\ 12 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATRACHIA, all from the coastal division, are not represented in my collections^ but as a set-off to this two species [Hyla groLcilenta and Phaneroti8\\ have been added to the coastal fauna, and one [H, rubella] to the inland fauna. Of the thirty species met with, twenty-five belong to the coastal division, and eighteen\"^ (not including Limnodyn<Mte9 Jleicheri, for reasons given below) to the inland division, fourteen species being common to both. The fauna of the coastal division, the conditions being very favourable, is rich for the relatively small area, and is tolerably well known, not many new species in all probability remaining to be discovered : its members may be roughly divided into four groups : (1) the species frequenting the semi-tropical brushes of our northern river districts, or the seques> tered gullies of the Blue Mts., or the Illawarra Range, such as MixophyeSy Phanerotisj Cryptotisy Limnodynastes peronii, Hyla graciltrnta, //. phyllochroay and H. leaueurii : (2) the swamp and river frogs, such as most of the species of LinmodynasteSy Crinia signiferay and Hyla aurea: (3) the largely terrestrial tree-frogs which at least have recourse to water for breeding purposes, such as H. ewingiiy H, cceruleay H. dentatay and H, peronii : and (4) the terrestrial batrachians par excelkncey mostly toads, frequenting damp places, but avoiding water, such as the species of Fseudo- phrjne, and probably also Hyperolia marmorata. The restriction of some species to the coastal division is explicable on the ground there only are to be found the natural conditions under which they flourish ; on the other hand we find some species inhabiting both regions under conditions of humidity, (kc, and amid surroundings widely different. One of the most marked differences between the coastal and inland faunas arises from the absence from the latter of the brush and gully-haunting frogs ; the balance is made up of three elements: (1) cosmopolitan species, (2) several peculiar species, of which two [I^otaden and Chiroleptes platycephalus] seem to be characteristic of the plain country, for neither of them has occurred in collections * Excluding also Pseiulophryne coriobcea, Waroo being just a little north of the northern border of N.S.W.

Here, as elsewhere, provided only that the frogs cnn live out the more or less lengthy periods of aestivation, in some years more trying than in others, the ponds after rain, wherever the 8oil is not too sandy, are at times sufficiently permanent and sufficiently numerous, formin? chains of ponds across the country as quoted above, to afiford a means whereby batrachians may be enabled to migrate from places where they have become established, and so to gain new stations ; or to re-j>eople the old haunts should excessively dry seasons prove utterly disastrous.

IcUopcUmaia^ though this miy l)e a widely distributed northern inland species at about its soutliem limit. In any case, the distribution of some of our species cannot be satisfactorily dealt with until more is known of the distribution of Queensland species. That the Dividing Range does not separate two more widely divergent faunas than, as far as present knowledge goes, have been met with, is not surprising when the faunas of the east and west coasts are contrasted, for it then appears that of fourteen species recorded in the B.M. Catalogue from W. Australia, seven, or 50 per cent., are members of our coastal fauna, and eight (including HeliopontH albo-punctatuSf recorded from the Murray) of our inland fauna. And it may be said generally of any and every colony, that its batrachian fauna consists of an admixture of more or less cosmopolitan forms and of a small number of others characteristic of the region. I/yla ewingii, Dum. k Bibr., was described in the Erp^tologie Geu^rale (T. viii. p. 597, published in 1841), the habitat being Tasmania ; the description adds, '* les parties sup^rieures offrent un gris verd&tre.\" It is figured in Voy. au Pdle Sud, Batrc. pL I. fig. 3, of which Dr. Giinther in the first edition of the B.M. Catalogue of Amphibia says, \"figure not good.'' The localities given in the second edition of the same work are Tasmania, HoVjart, Melbourne, and Australia, var. A {H. calliscelis) being recorded from King George's Sound. Dr. GUnther (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (3), xx. (1867), p. 57) also records B, ewingii from N. £. Australia. 14 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATRACHLA, Mr. Krefil (P.Z.S. 1863, p. 389) includes H, ewingii among the Batracliians occurring in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and says : '* This pretty little Uyla is rather a rare species, and I do not think that I ever found more than six or eight specimens of it generally under stones during the cold season/' In the same paper he says of H, verreavacii: \"A rather rare frog, which I have occasionally taken from under the bark of the Tea-tree, and from under rocks in moist localities ; never taken during the summer. No specimens from other parts of Australia have as yet come under my notice.\" In his paper on \" Australian Verte- brata, Recent and Fossil\" (Industr. Prog. N.S.W. [1871], p. 747), we have a slightly different version : for it is there stated of H, ewingii that the Sydney '* Museum is in possession of specimens from almost every part of Australia, the west coast excepted,\" while H. verreauxii is said to be \" very common almost everywhere on the eastern border.\" One of our commonest frogs in the County of Cumberland, equally common also in the three adjacent countien, though I have not seen it from any inland localities, until it occurred in two of Mr. Froggatt's collections noted above, is a little -fly/a, of which Mr. Boulenger kindly named specimens for me as H. ewingii var. calliscelis, Peters. It is the little frog whose shrill twee^ twee, Itvee, repealed from half-a-dozen to a dozen times or more, may he heard in damp weather even during the winter months, as I have pointed out elsewhere. From its common occurrence Mr Kreflft was no doubt familiar with this frog ; but as Peters' description was published only in 1874, Mr. Krefft could not have referred to it under this name in the papers quoted above. II. dentataj Kef erst., is a Sydney frog, and was described in Archiv fiir Naturgesch., for 1868, but it is not mentioned in the latest of Mr. Kreffl's papers published in 1871. It seems to me therefore very probable that when Mr. Kiefft leferred to H, ewiiiyii and II. verreauxii as species occurring in the neighbour- hood of Sydney and elsewhere on the east coast, he meant to denote the two frogs now known as 11, ewingii var. calliscelia^ Peters, and H. dentaia, Keferst. BT J. J. FLBTCHER. 15 To Mr, W. W. Froggatt I am vf»ry much indebted for thirtj-one specimens of the typical form of U. ewingii from the neighbour- hood of Ballarat, Victoria. I do not know this frog from any locality in N.S.W., though I have oue specimen of a Hyla obtained bj me under the bark of a tree in a gully on the Blue Mts., which I am inciineii to refer to this species : it is larger (52 mm. from snout to vent) than any specimen of H, kreffti or B. ewingii I have seen, it has the fingers insufficiently webbed to be referred to the former, and is too long in the legs, the tibio-tarsal joint of the adpressed limb reaching beyond the level of the tip of the snout, to quite satisfactorily be placed in H, ewingii, with which otherwise it has most in common ; if it may correctly be regarded as a very large and unusually long-legged individual of the typical form of //. ewingii, then it is the only specimen from N.8.W. known to me ; while if it should not strictly be referable to this species, then, as far as my experience goes, H, ewingii is repre- sented in N.S.W. only by var. calliscelis. H, ewingii var. calliscelis from ELing George's Sound differs from the typical form \" in having the hinder side of thighs with large purplish-black spots on yellowish ground ; a purplish-black spot in the groin \" (B.M. Cat. 2nd ed. p. 407). In specimens from the County of Cumberland and from the three adjoining counties, the presence of s|K)t8 seems quite constant either in the groin or on the flanks, frequently they are absent on the hinder surface of the thighs : the concealed surfaces of the legs in living specimens and in such as have not been long in spirits, are of a bright orange ; while the dark inguinal s}>ots in the living animal appear on a buck ground tinged with light yellow. Some of Mr. Froggatt's H|)ecimens from Lucknow are much more spotted and blotched even than Sydney examples, in six of them '*the large well-defined dark spot commencing between the eyes and covering the middle of the back \" of the descriptions being not merely a darker shade of the groundcolour ^'speckled all over with blackish/' but partially edged or to some extent invaded by a dark tint like that of the orrlinary inguinal spots : none of them have spots on the hinder surface of the thighs, and some of them are not more blotched than Sydney specimens. 10 fiEOCMiAi>l[li:\\L DISTllIBDTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATttACIlIA, 'I'lii' hpautifiil little Hyla brought mo alive from Ballarat by .M r, l''ro;;.t'iitt, rt-tVi-red to in my last paper (p. 264), has puzzled d nor :i little: wicli tlie general cbaraclera of ff.etvingii, it presented iviii'ii alivi; ;i Iihi.ilI bright green dorsal band edged by a dark ij:ii i'i>u' li;niil, .mil with also B lateral linear dark band, in which ii-.|M-,ts ii ,liil..r, fro ^|.<>.'l.i>.'iis fmuj Lach Fro_i;^iiU, who likewise (ihin sjii'i-iiiLrii, likt eve I I liiL tilK).

In other words, but that the head is not much depressed and the snout not shorter than usual, some of these specimens might be referred to X. pUUycephaluM ; while if the fingers and toes were but pointed, some of them might very well be referred to L. JUieherL Of four specimens from Wentworth three have crimson spots, all have a distinct basal webbing, but in two of them the tarso-metatarsal joint of the adpressed limb does not reach beyond the level of the nostril ; they have three metacarpal tubercles, but in none of them is there a recognisable outer metatarsal tubercle. From Urana Mr. Sloane, whom I had asked to look out for i^>ecimens with crimson palpebral spots, kindly sent me two specimens alive, of which he wrote, '* I send you a couple of remarkably robust specimens of L, taamani&nsia ; I have seen several specimens with reddish markings on the upper eyelids, but the two sent do not show it so strongly marked *' ; one of these, 60 mm. from snout to vent, is the largest specimen of the species I have seen ; they agree substantially with the specimens from Wentworth, but are both a little duskier on the throat and sides of chest ; and more spotted on the undersurface of the calf and foot. Of eighteen specimens from Waroo, some have crimson palpebral spots, some have two metatarsal tubercles, while others appear to have but one, and some appear to have but two meta- carpal tubercles, some of them are much spotted on the throat, sides of chest and even of the abdomen, and on the undersurface of legs ; one specimen is of quite the typical form. From Gunta- wang, with specimens of the typical form, together with specimens of what might be called L. fletcheri if the fingers and toes were 2 18 QEOORAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN BATRACHIA« pointed, I have two specimens of the same batch as the two type specimens of the latter sent to Mr. Boulenger ; these have the fingers and toes pointed as Mr. Boulenger describes, but I cannot help thinking that there is something abnormal about them — possibly they may, when collected, have been put into too strong spiiit, — and that they are of the same species as the speci- mens without pointed fingers and toes, and that both are simply a variety of Z. tasmaniensis, Mixophyes fasciolatits, Gthr., the type specimens of which came from the Clarence River (two specimens appearing to be in the Collection at the time the second edition of the Catalogue was published), is said to have the tibio-tarsal articulation reaching to the tip of the snout, and the ** toes two-thirds webbed, so that the three outer phalanges of the fourth toe remain free.\" I have before me a fine series of seven large specimens, of which fi?e were obtaiued for me by Mr. Helms on the Richmond River, and two others subsequently a little further to the north on the Tweed : in all these the tibio-tarsal articulation of the ad pressed limb reaches well beyond the level of the snout (say from J to 1 inch), while as to the webbing, several may be said to agree with the description, others have a little more webbing, it is thicker, and intensely pigmented, the maximum being reached in a very fine specimen from the Tweed : the difference in size between the type, of which measurements are given by Dr. Giinther, and this specimen is very well indicated by the following: in Dr. GUnther's specimen length of body (from snout to vent) 33 lines, length of hind limb 54 lines : in my specimen the corresponding measure- ments ^re 3-J-l inches, and 8 inches (to the tip of the fourth toe along the straightened leg) : now in this specimen every toe, even the fourth, is webbed to almost the very tip on at least one side (of the toe), but the toes cannot be said to be fully webbed, because toes 2-4 are not equally webbed on both sides (of the toe). There is in the Macleay Museum from the Richmond River a still larger and finer example than mine, — the largest Australian frog I have yet seen — which is more or less similar BT J. J. FLBTOHBB. 19 in regard to the more than usuaUj copious webbing ; it is not accessible at present, and I cannot give further particulars about it, but it is the frog exhibited by Mr. Masters at the meeting of this Society in March, 1886 [Proceedings (2), I. p. 238]. Specimens of this species from the Blue Mts. are normally webbed, but are longer in the legs than the type, like my northern river specimens. In endeavouring to find a place in our systematic lists for such specimens as the above, one has choice of two alternatives ; either to consider that they are representatives of new species and to deal with them accordingly, or, as I think the more desirable course, to treat them as varietal forms, and to note them as such. With the advantages which residence in the country naturally gives in the way of acquiring some knowledge of certain species in their natural haunts, and of obtaining with greater facility perhaps larger series of specimens of other species than naturalists abroad can very often have at their disposal, it has ceased to cause me surprise that I sometimes meet with individuals whose characters refuse to come [lerfectly and exactly into the line as laid down in the text-books ; or that characters which seem to be of more or less considerable specific importance when only a few specimens have been available, should sometimes turn out to be variable when larger series of specimens are examined.

Woolls. Ph.D., F.L.8. Some time since I forwarded to the linnean Society, with Notes, 38 specimens of plants collected at King Gorge's Sound by the Rev. R. Collie, F.L.S., and in so doing I endeavoured to explain, by the assistance of my late friend Mr. C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., the probable reason why the flora of Western Australia difTers so much from that of the eastern portion of the contiuent. That eminent geologist was of opinion that, during the Miocene period, the condition of Australia was very different from what it now is, as probably the ocean occupied all that low country between Spencer^ 8 GtU/and Western Australia; whilst during the Cretacean period about two-thirds of Australia must have been under the ocean. Supposing, therefore, that Eastern and Western Australia at some very remote period were separated by water, and that, in the course of many generations, the conditions of soil and climate have been considerably modified in both regions, it may be presumed that the western or purely Australian plants became very much localised, whilst the eastern flora, in addition to the few species which have immigrated to it from the west, has been mixed with plants of an Asiatic or Polynesian type. An examination of 35 species, which have recently been collected at King Gorge's Sound, will show how few have travelled eastwards : — (1) DiLLBNIACBiE. 1. Hibbertia fur/uraceti, Benth.

Whatever may be the cause, it is a fact that in the great orders Leguminosse, Myrtacese and Proteacese, many of the western genera are either wholly unrepresented or only partially represented in tbe ea^t For instance, the large genera Gcutra- lobium and Jaeksonta have very few species out of Western i^ustralia, whilst at least four genera are not represented in any other pHrt of Australia. In tbe Myrtacese, also, a similar unequal distribution appears. The large genus V&rticoi'diaf with the exception of one species in Queensland and Northern Australia, is exclusively western ; and CcUycolhrix, with its numerous species, has only two representatives in N. S. Wales. Actinodium^ PUe- anthtUj WehliOf Astariec^ Hypocalymma, BcUaustionf Conothamnuif Regeliay Phymatooirpus^ CalothamnuSy Lamarchea and Eremma are limited to the west ; and in Eucalyptus not more than six or seven species are common to both regions. Again, in the Proteacee, SimnOy Synaphea, Franldandia, and the large genus Dryandra^ no species have migrated eastward ; whilst in Petrophila, laopogon^ and Bankna, the eastern species are few. In the large order of the Compositse, 206 occur in the west and 296 in N. 8. Wales. Only three genera, with one species each, viz., Piihocarpa^ Decazesia and TrichocU/ie, are peculiar to W. Australia. It must be remarked in reference to this order that the species ure more widely dis- tributed than any other, being easily conveyed by the nature of their seeds, and being in many instances mere weeds suited to all climatOH. Notwithstanding these considerations, however, many of the western species are truly local, whilst the number of the eastern composites has l>een augmented by plants from Asia, Australasia and Polynenia. In the Epacride», Oligarrhena, Needhamia^ Conosiephium^ Coleanthtra, Lysiaema^ Cosmelia^ Sphenotoma and the large genus Anderaonia, nine of the species occur in the East ; whilst amongst Monocotyledonous plants, all the species of the Hfemodoracese, with the exception of very few, are strictly limited to the west.

Pnruix is a genus of the Araliacese, several species of which or.itT are more or less acrid or aromatic. But the recorded instancen of gum or resin being found in any of them are extremely few. and in no case, so far as I am aware, has the composition of the exudation been dealt with, much less an analysis given. In the common English ivy ( Hedera h^Jix), there is stated to >>e contained ** the gum-resin called Hederine, used by varnish- niakern, and said to be depilatory and emmenagogue.\" (Liiidley, Medictd and (EcoywmiccU Botany.) *' An aromatic gum-iesin comes from Aralia racemoaa, spinosa, and hispida. (Lindley, Vegetable Kingdom,) Aferyta Sinclairiiy Seem., of New Zealand, \"is charged with a )>eculiar resin in all its parts.\" (Kirk's Forest Flora of New Ztafand,)* All the above quotations refer to resins or gum-resins. We now come to gutns in the Araliacepe, and the two references I give are all I can find of gums in this natural order, aud they l>oth refer to PanaXy the genus to which all the gums I have been able to obtain up to the present also belong. \" Panax Colenaoi exudes a gum very similar to gum arabic, and occasionally used for adhesive purposes. \" ( Report New Zealand Exhibition, 1865.) * Since the above was written I have received from Mr. W. W. Froggatt a quantity of a gnm-resin from AiUrotriche Jloccosa, DC., belonging to thia natural order. It has a very pleasant perfume, and appears to be an interesting substance.

My sample has the appearance of an inferior gum arabic ; it breaks with a dull conchoidal fracture; the colour varies from amber to colourless. After 24 hours in cold water a portion of the gum remained undissolved, and had swollen a good deal. After separating the solution, this insoluble substance was treated with very dilute potash ; it readily dissolved, and on acidifying with acetic acid and adding alcohol, arabin was precipitated, showing the insoluble portion to have been metarabin. The gum soluble in cold water was proved to be arabin. The composition of this sample of gum is : — Arabin ... ... ... ... 68*8 Metarabin... ... ... ... 16*1 (by difference) ^^jsn ... ... ... ...

It was collected in January, 1892, and was analysed a month later. This gum is brittle, like that of P. sambivci/olius, var. anguata, and not viscous like that of F, elegans. Its taste is not pleasant ; it has not much odour, not resembling P. elegans in this respect. It is fairly light in colour, although portions are as dark as ordinary glue. In cold water it wholly dissolves to a clear transparent liquid, not opalescent like that of P. aamhuci/olius, var.

The gum of P. nwrrayi woald form a valuable substitute for gum arabic, and it would be a valuable minor industry for this country if it were procurable in large quantities. All the gums possess some odour, obtained from the barks, and isolation of the odoriferous bodies could be best carried out by analysis of tlie bark. This odoriferous principle in the Araliaceee, and reminding one of the Umbellifene, has long been known. *' Most of the species have a very strong smell of aniseed and celery, — whence the name of < Oelery-tree ' is given to Panax (JfatKopanax) elegans by the Queensland colotiists.\" (Seemann, Flora vUiensiSy 114). The ash of Panax gums principally consists (in my samples) of lime, magnesium, and potassium, with a trace of iron, and although the bases were present principally as carbonates, both sulphuric and phosphoric acids were found. Quantitative deter- minations of the different constituents of the ash were not made, with the exception of phosphorous pentoxide, the percentage of P, O5 in the ash of P. eUgana being '969. The gums may therefore be considered as principally the calcium, magnesium and potassium salts of arabic acid. .SOUIKI referred to - Cii/.fi ;« MlUMli, the N iiLoi, with th ivards « addixl to tl Mr. Fletclier exM the D ue Mouutain* Also li -iiig adult am part 1)1 11 oDectinn ( moKtIi on the Blue : aniouii inji to nt leas — H flowering spcciineua ol rianf/io, R.Br., both from )D that tbey might aftcr- li interentiiig plunls from U liwl kindly determined. of Pefipatua — t\\ia formet' jd specimena obtained lut or part of bbeir pragenj, t least two hundred specimens, stibsequently horn in ciiiitivity ; also tlie iiremntuifly burn young of iiii aocideiitiilly injiiivil ft^tiialu, advanced onibiyoa extrmleii ilnrin^' llii' drowning of th.! moll.ers, and dissccti-.l female^ sihoMing (liu oviduuia era led with embryos.

No. v.— NOTES ON THE SUBFAMILY BROSCINI (CARABIDiE), WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES. By Thomas G. Sloane. In a former paper (P.L.S.N.S.W., 1890 (2), v. p. 189) I divided the Australian Broscini into two main divisions, viz. : — i. With temporal ridge very indistinct. ii. With temporal ridge distinct Further consideration and study of the subfamily induces me to think this grouping misleading. To arrange the genera of any subfamily into natural groups one requires a knowledge of at le^t all the important genera constituting such sulifamily found in all parts of the world. I have only a knowledge of the Australian genera. These genera have very different values from a classificatory point of view, a circumstance which occurs in all branches of Entomology ; this is a difficulty in the way of drawing up tables of genera, especially partial ones, because the genera must theoretically be considered as of equal value, though practically they may not be so. Taking the Australian Broscini, we find three distinct types, represented by the genera Promeco- denuj Eurylychmis, and Percosoma respectively. The genera of the first group, or type, have been arranged by me (I.e. p. 190) in a table that may be taken as useful as far as it goes. These genera, with Eurylychnus^ are differentiated from the others by the presence of a setigerous puncture in the scrobe of the mandibles. The Percosoma group (Percosoma^ Lychnus and 'IKS ly ACBTRALtAN GNTOHOLOQT, iliDutn puncture in tliesorobenrUiPiuaudiblM.* ii)ipeAra to be wsntiug in the Kew Zealand p!i[ier I take the genus Promecoderug first, ri'jidy treated of it ; the other genem I take in If th\" n^i\" n* tu^if BlUnity as lending from NAl'I, n.sp.

I received both $ and $ from Mr. Musson, who took them at NHirabri, and formerly I had a J taken by myself in the Warialda district. I believe this to be the insect to which de Castelnau lefers when he says, under the name P, striato-punctcUus, he I.HS a specimen from the Darling River* ; however, apart from the inappropriateness of the name stricUo-jmnctcUv^j I hardly think this species will be found to extend to Victoria. I have already expressed the belief that P, atriato-punctatus^ Casteln., = P. uiyricornis^ Casteln. t This species is allied to P. comes, SI., from which it differs in its narrower form, in the prothorax being proportionately broader in comparison with the elytra, in its larger head, blacker colour, and in the marginal border of the elytra not being entire on the base, «fcc. Promecoderus concolor, Germ. When reviewing the genus Promecoderus two years ago I followed de Castelnau, who had been followed with doubt by M. Putzeys in his B^.vision des Broscides de VAustralie, and main- tit ined P. hoiritlif Casteln., as a species distinct from P. concolor, Germ. Since then I have obtained a larger series of specimens from different localities, which convinces me that they must be regarded as one species, and that P. aiithracinus, Mad., and P. fHjIiius, SI., must also be placed as synonyms of P. concolor, I further sink P. lucidicoLlis, Casteln., to the rank of a variety, and regard P. oblony^ts, Casteln., as a synonym of P. lucidicollis. M. Putzeys gives the dimensions of P. oblongns, Castoln., as 12 x 4^ mm. The synonymy will, therefore, be: — P. co7icolor. Germ., = P. Buturalis, Casteln.; P. lucidiis, Putz., (these agree with the typical form of P, concolor) ; P. liowitti, Casteln.; P. anthracintis, MacL; /'. polUus, SI. (the last three are identical, but do not seem to me ♦ Trang Roy. Soc.

The last ventral segment has one puncture on each side of the anus (therefore I believe it to be the ^), and the anterior tibiae are without spongiose tissue below. In these respects, and in the form of the posterior trochanters it resembles F, distincttis^ SI., which is its nearest ally among previously described species.

In his note on this species, Mr. Bates says : — \" If the male prove to have the soles of the dilated joints of the anterior tarsi furnished with a hair-pad, the species will belong to Eurylychnus, from which it differs only in the elytra having a scutellar striola\" I took a number of specimens of both sexes under logs in the brashes at Burrawang in Nov., 1890, and am able to state with certainty that the male has no \" hair-pad \" on the lower side of the joints of anterior tarsL The tarsi are ho much alike in both sexes that I cannot determine the sex by their means ; neverthe- less, I do not consider a new genus necessary for its reception. So-called genera which i*est on a single character of doubtful yalue, appertaining to only one sex, seem to me too artificial for practical workers in zoology ; though, no doubt, rigid cabinet specialists may find them indispensable. This species has been very carefully desciibed by M. Putzeys, but to complete my notice of the genus Eurylychmbs^ I append the following description founded on specimeos from Burrawang. Form robust, convex. Black, legs reddish. Head large, with strong transverse impression behind eyes ; frontal impressions strong, curved, diverging backwards, widening internally at clypeal suture, — this well marked, — a raised space between frontal impressions and lateral channel on each side ; eyes round, promi- nent.

It appears to me that M.

I have a S|)ecimen from the north of Tasmania which seems undoubtedly to be Z. 8trangtU€Uus, Bates ; it agrees thoroughly with M. Pntzeys' description of L. ater (apart from the transverse impression at back of head). I therefore think the names synonymous, and in this belief have united them. The puncturation of the elytral striae mentioned by M. Putzeys in his description of L. aier, and referred to by Mr. Bates in his remsrkf*, is to my mind of no value, being, in all probability, caused by long immersion in spirits of wine.
