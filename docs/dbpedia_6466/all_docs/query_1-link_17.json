Parts of the formation are covered by Main\n\nSouth Road, and other parts are now a bikeway.\n\nCheck your street directory. My Gregory's (from last year) shows virtually the\n\nwhole line as a \"Disused Railway\" apart from the sections of bikeway (and the\n\nsection through Seaford which has been completely built over).\n\n> Also, another dismantled railway appears heading south from the Ascot Park\n\n> area to the Mitsubishi Motors factory - but the stations are still shown!\n\n> (Tonsley, Clovelly Park, Mitchell Park).

I only travelled on\n\nthat section on an ARHS tour on the then recently restored locomotive 621\n\naround 1972.\n\n\n\nPeter Homann wrote in message\n\n<39855EA5...@SPAM.ME.optushome.com.au>...\n\n>Bradley Torr wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> Hello,\n\n>>\n\nSnip\n\n>\n\n>> More map errors - what appears to be a railway marshalling yard is shown\n\n>> just north of Port Adelaide on Grand Trunkway. There seems to be a line\n\n>> heading south, but its stubbed out just before Francis Street - did this\n\n>> ever meet up with the Port Adelaide to Adelaide line?\n\nMy UBD of Adelaide, 16th edition (which refuses to admit to its age but was\n\ncertainly not up to date in 1979(?) when I first visited Adelaide) shows\n\nextensive rail sidings all the way from No 3 Dock (silos near Moonta Rd) to\n\nthe Victoria Road bridge. All these lines fed into a triangular junction\n\nwith the Dry Creek to Port dock line, between Bedford St and Lee Terrace.\n\nThe west leg split immediately at another triangular junction serving Port\n\nDock and Adelaide via the Outer Harbour line. The east leg ran to the local\n\nmarshalling yard at Gillman, just west of the Eastern Parade crossing.\n\nPassenger trains from Dry Creek to Port Dock turned out to the south at this\n\ncrossing and ran through Rosewater station, then parallel with the Outer\n\nHarbour line under Grand Junction Road. East of the Eastern Parade crossing\n\nwas a connection to the Finsbury line which rejoined the Outer Harbour line\n\nat Woodville.\n\nOn the western side of the harbour was a line running in a loop from\n\nGlanville to Osborne, with numerous sidings shown near the power station.\n\nOn my visit in 1979(?), there were passenger services to Port Dock via Dry\n\nCreek, Finsbury Stores and ICI Osborne.\n\n>>\n\n>> And is the Port Adelaide-Dry Creek line still used for passenger\n\nservices?\n\n>> Stations are shown, but I couldn't imagine there being many passengers\n\n>> wanting to use such a service......\n\n>>\n\n>> Thanks in advance for any information which could enlighten me.\n\n>>\n\n>> Regards,\n\n>> Bradley.\n\n>\n\n"
