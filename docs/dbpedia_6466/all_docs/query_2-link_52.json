By the Rev. H. Kempe, of the Mission Station, River Finke, Corr. Memb. [Read December 2, 1890.] PREFACE. The result of an attempt to analyse a language of which the people speaking it have only a colloquial knowledge, and who are consequently incapable of answering or even understanding gram- matical questions, must be in many respects imperfect. The difficulty is increased by the wandering habits of the people, making it impossible to maintain that constant communication with them which is necessary for the attainment of a complete knowledge of the structure of their language. It is only with the help of the boys grown up on the station, and who have become less nomadic than their elders, that the knowledge now gained has been established. There still remain mysterious phrases, incapable as yet of being traced back to their origin, awaiting solution. The following pages, therefore, do not profess to contain a complete vocabulary, nor one which would satisfy the learned philologist. Even up to the present day expressions crop up for things it was thought the natives had no words. The difficulty is increased by the olose proximity of another tribe, for south of the Finke the natives speak a different language alto- gether, as their words terminate in i and u and au, whilst the others terminate all in a. As they have frequent intercourse with each other, it is very easy to understand that the natives to the north must have adopted many of the words and phrases of those to the south. Concerning the vocabulary, it may be mentioned that it has been carefully compiled and revised several times with diflerent natives, so that the words may be relied upon as correct. These pages are submitted in the hope that they will prove interesting to the philologist, as exhibiting the peculiar structure of the language spoken by a people generally considered among the lowest in the scale of mankind, and will contribute a little towards perpetuating the knowledge of a language of one of the Australian tribes of natives before their probable entire extinc- tion at a no very remote period. The vocabulary is that of the tribe inhabiting the River Finke, 2 and is also, with only slight variations in the dialect, that of the tribes in the MacDonnell Ranges eastward to Alice Springs, but not far westward of the River Finke, and extending southward to the Peake. GRAMMAR. CHAPTER I. Of the Characters taken to Represent the Sounds of the Language, and their Pronunciation. VOWELS. A a, like a in father, are O o, like o in more E e, like e in there, were U u, like u in dull, or o in more. I i, like i in tin Ai ai, like i in light Au au, like ow in now B b, like b in be D d, like d in do G g, like g in go H h, like h in here J j, like y in year K k, like k in king L 1, like 1 in long M m, like m in more These are the primitive sounds, to which for the sake of the pronunciation of the Scriptural names, were added — - F f, like f in far Z z, like z in zero. S s, like s in so The vowels and diphthongs are to be considered as always short. In order to make the number of written characters as few as possible, the elongation of the syllable is indicated by a small stroke over the letter, as, lada, \"the paint,\" in which the a is to be pronounced long, as in far. When two or three vowels occur, they form a dipthong ; if not, they are separated by the mark of diaeresis ( • • ), as, leoika. CHAPTER II. Of Substantives and their Cases, and of Prepositions. Substantives have three numbers ; singular, dual, and plural, but T10 distinctive mark for gender either by the use of an article ■or otherwise. There is no article All words terminate in «, with the exception of the vocative of .substantives, and the imperative mood of verbs which terminate in ai. diphthongs. Oi oi, like oi in oil. consonants. N n, like n in near Ng ng, like ng in ring P p, like p in pipe R r, like r in roam T t, like t in to Tj tj, like g in gentle W w, like w in wife 3 Tlie dual is formed by adding tlie termination utatcrd to tlie word, as, ataa, \" the man,\" (Uuankttera, \"tlie two men.\" Besides this there is a particular form of dual, which is only used personally by annexing the particle nauf/a, as, wora, \"the boy ; toorananya, \" the two boys ;\" kwara, \" the girl ;\" kwavti- nmiga^ \" the two girls.\" Tlie plural is formed by adding irbera ov arUirhem, as, nra(//Uja, \"the woman,\" cmigiitj irbera or arayntjantirbcra, \"the women.\" This form cannot be used in the neuter gender, but tlie form iitatera can also be used personally. There are six cases — nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, and vocative. a. The nominative is expressed in a double manner. The word is unchanged, if connected with an intransitive verb, fis, at'ua inda7na, \"the man sleeps,\" or hatjia lima, \"the child goes ;\" but it is formed by adding the particle \" /«,\" when it is uncon- nected with a transitive verb, as, worala gama, \" the boy cuts,\" &c., or apmala utnama,^^ tkc, \" the snake bites,\" kc. b. Thegenitive is formed byadding>^«, as kataka, \"of the father.\" By the genitive is expressed either possession, as, tvora kataka, \"the son of the father;\" or it shows to whose advantage or dis- advantage anything is done, as, ta irbunga inaka kniribata ka, \"I fishes caught old man for,\" i.e., \" I caught tishes for the old man.\" It also expresses the purpose of any action, as, arayuf^a inkuka laka, \"the woman went for bullrushes,\" i.e., to fetch bullrushes. c. The dative terminates in na, as, ata katjiana ntema, \" I give to the child.\" d. The accusative is always unaltered, as, ta kwatja rijuma, \" I drink water.\" e. The ablative terminates in \" nya,\" and shows the direction whence a thing comes, as ta kwatja nanjinga inama, \" I fetch water from the well ;\" or it signifies the material from which a thing is made, as era ulba'inja ititjinya erbuma, \" he a boomerang of mulga makes ;\" or it signifies the cause for which a thing is done, a,sjinya worinya tarama, \" I laugh for the sake of the boy.\" f. The vocative terminates in ai, as, katjiai, \" child ! \" The declension of the substantive may be seen by the following table : — Sinyular. Nom. atua, or atula, the man. Gen. atuka, of the man. Dat. atuana, to the man. Accus. atua, the man. Abl. atuanga, from, for the man. Too. atuai ! man ! 4 Dual ( Perso7ial J. Nom. atuananga, the two men. Gen. atuanangaka, of the two men. Dat. atuanangana, to the two men. Accus. atuananga, the two men. Abl. atuananganga, from the two men. Yoc. atuanangai ! you two men ! Dual ( Neuter ). Nom. lunjantatera, the two huts. Gen. lunjantateraka, of the two huts. Dat. lunjantaterana, to the two huts. Accus. lunjantatera, the two huts. Abl. lunjantateranga, from the two huts. Plural. Nom. atuirbera or antuantirbera, the men. Gen. atuirberaka or antuantirberaka, of the men. Dat. atuirberana or antuantirberana, to the men. Accus. atuirbera or antuantirbera, the men. Abl. atuirberanga or antuantirberanga, from the men. Other substantives are formed — (a.) by adding to primitive substantives the particle ringa,^^ signifying something pertaining or belonging to a certain, thing or place, as, arila, \" sand a7'ilaringa, \" a man belonging to or being at home in a sandy country or aputa, \" hills or ranges aputaringa, \" men whose home is in the ranges.\" This particle is also affixed to names of places, and expresses the place at which one is at home, as mbarata, \" a place ;\" mharataringay \" men who are at home at mharata.^^ (h.) Out of the roots of verbs, as, gama, \" to cut gananganay \" a cutting thing, a knife;\" indama, \"to sleep;\" indanin- dana, \"a sleeping thing, i.e., a bed ;\" tuma, \"to beat ;\" tunatunay \" a man beating, i.e., a beater ;\" ntema, \" to give ;\" ntenantenaj \" a giving man, i.e.. a giver.\" OF PREPOSITIONS. There are two classes of prepositions, one class consisting of separate words and the other consisting only of small particles, annexed to the substantives, to which they belong as suffixed. As the prepositions, consisting of separate words, are placed at the end of the word to which they belong, they should be rather called postpositions. The majority always govern a certain case. a. Those taking the ablative case are nine in number, viz. : — I. ulara, \" in front,\" as, era atunga idara tiuuna. \" he of man in front stands.\" 5 Ulara also <^overns tlie ji^eiiitive case wlien used in the s(;iise of against \" either friendly or hostile, as, era tjiiiakatjina nukanaka ulara 7iama, \" lie friendly me against is,\" i.e., \" He is friendly towards me.\" II. topala, \" behind,\" as, era tooranga topala nama, \" he boy behind is, i.e., \" He is behind the boy.\" III. gatala, \" outside,\" as, katjia iltanga gatala nama, \" child from house outside is,\" i.e., \" He is outside the house.\" IV. mhohula, \" between,\" as, kwara worateranga mhohula tnama, \" girl boys two between stands,\" i.e., ^' the girl stands between two boys.\" V. ntuara, \" other side \" (Latin, trans ), as, erila ulhaimga ntuara lima, \" man river otherside goes,\" i.e., \" the man goes on the other side of the river.\" VI. nunkara, \"this side\" (Latin, citra), as, ilta nuka ulhaiinga nunkara tnama, \" house my river this side stands.\" i.e., \"my house stands on this side of the river.\" VII. nkelala, \"beside\" (hs^AXi, juxta), as, era nkelala katunga nama, \" he besides father sits.\" i.e., \" he sits besides the father.\" VIII. itinjawara, \" close by,\" as, iltanga iti^ijawara, \" from house close by.\" i.e., \" close by the house.\" IX. 7ituari7itjirka, \" through,\" as, nana ta altjuranga ntuai^intjirka iwuma, \" this I hole through throw.\" i.e., \" I throw this through the hole.\" h. Those with accusative case are four in number, viz. : — I. katningala, \" upon,\" as, jinga aputala katningala tnama, \" I hill upon stand.\" II. katningalagana, \" over,\" as, ngapa hira katningalagana ilhanama, \" crow tree over flies.\" i.e., \" the crow flies over the tree.\" 6 III. kwcmakala, \" clown,\" as, jinga apiita kwanakala Inlunia, \" I hill down climb.\" i.e., \" I climb cloAvn the hill.\" IV. kwanaJa, \" inside,\" as, katjia iUahvanala nama, \" child house inside is.\" c. Prepositions annexed to nouns as suffixes are nine, viz. : — I. una, \"on, upon, into,\" as, kvmtjuna, \"to the water;\" I) in ma, \" upon the tree ; \" nanjuna, \" into the well.\" II. lela, signifies the instrument with which or the person by v/liom anything is made or accompanied, as, ilupahla, \" with the axe ;\" erilahJa, \" by the man;\" jinga erinalela lama, \"I go wdth him.\" III. Ioj, signifies the place where anyone is, as, ajmtala, \"on the- hili ;\" it is therefore annexed to all names of places, as, tjoritjala,. \" at Alice Springs ;'' tungala, \"at Henbury.\" IV. gata, \"with\" (Latin, cum), as, atua tjatagata bitjima, \" the man spear with comes.\" V. 7'aba, \" without,\" as, era gararaha alhuma, \" he meat without goes back.\" i.e., \" he goes back without meat \" VI. gitjala, \" for, in exchange,\" as, ta mana ntitjinanga irhungagitjala, \" I bread will give fishes for.\" i.e., \" I shall give bread for fishes.\" VII. kaguia, \" for the sake of,\" as, unkwangakagiiia ta tarama, \" your sake for I laugh.\" -i.e., \" I laugh for the sake of you,\" VIII. kieka, \" on, to,\" as, ta i^oepa iltakieka kantatuma, \" I paper house on nail.\" i.e., \" I nail the paper on the house.\" or, erinakieka ta kumilaka, \" him on I have sinned.\" i.e., \" on him I have sinned.\" or, nilknamhakieka ta ngana numerilama \" thief to I you count.\" i.e., \"I count you a thief.\" IX. ibera, ibena, \" from, out of,\" as, iltibera, \" out of the house ;\" kwafjibena, \" from the water.\" CHAPTER [IT. Of Adjectives and tiieih T)e(;i{ees of CoMPAinsoN ; of Numbers. adjectives. Adjectives may receive the same ))article as the noun, to which I hey belong; the particle is generally omitted in one of the words, the substantive as a rule, for only the last word is de- clined, as, ta katjia tera marana mana ntenia^ \" I child two good to bread give.\" i.e., \" I give bread to the two good children.\" Besides these primitive adjectives, otliers are formed — ■ a. From substantives, by annexing the particle karinya, as, hiuatja, \"water;\" hcatjakaringa, \"watery;\" or, arila, \"sand;\" arilakaringa, \"sandy;\" or the particle as, j)uta, \"stone;\" jnitahuta, \"stony;\" or the particle as, kankinja, \"love;\" kankiiijamata, \"loving;\" njirkna, \"hate;\" njirknamata, \"spite- ful ;\" kata, \"father;\" katamata, \"fatherly.\" h. From the roots of verbs by adding the particle ntjalkua, as, tnima, \"weep;\" tninfjcdkua, \"disposed to cry;\" ankama, \"speak;\" ankantjalkua, \"talkative.\" Of the degrees of comparison — • a. Comparative of equality : nana tera mala knira naramajiga, \" these two equal large are.\" b. Comparative of superiority is formed by adding the particle alkura, as, nana wora maralkura nama, nana ngetjina, \" this boy good more is, that than.\" i.e., \" this boy is better than that.\" c. The superlative can only be expressed either by repetition of the word, as, kunakuna, \" very bad ;\" or by adding the word, indora, \" very,\" to an adjective, as, tjenja, \"high;\" tjenjindora, \" very high.\" d. Diminutive:i are formed by adding the particle kotjirka to tlie word, as, piitctkotjirka, Si very iimall stone;\" kurkakotjirka, \"a very small one.\" numbers. There are primitively only numbers up to four, viz. :■ — ninta, \"one;\" tera, \"two;\" teramininta, \"two by one,\" ^'.e., \"three;\" teramatera, \"two by two,\" i.e., \"four.\" These numbers are declined in the same way as nouns when standing in place of one. All higher numbers are expressed by :—~i(rbnfja, \" some ;\" 8 arinahula^ ov arungalura, \"a few;\" \" many ; \" njarakmra, \" very much.\" CHAPTER IV. Of Pronouns, possessive pronouns. The possessive pronouns are the only class of pronouns whose declension is perfect (all others are more or less defective as re- gards declension). They must therefore be taken first as in many instances they supply the deficiencies of other pronouns. All pronouns, if declinable, are with only slight alterations de- clined as substantives, as the following table, giving the de- clensions of the possessive pronouns, shows : — Singular. First Person. Nom. katjia nuka, my child. Gen. katjia nukanaka, of my child. Dat. katjia nukana, to my child. Accus. katjia nuka, my child. Abl. katjia nukananga, from my child. Second Person. Nom. kwara unkwanga, thy girl. Gen. kwara unkwanganaka, of thy girl. Dat. kwara unkwangana, to thy girl. Accus. kwara unkwanga, thy girl. Abl. kwara unkwanganga, from thy girl. Third Person. Nom. kata ekura, his, her, its father. Gen. kata ekuranaka, of his father. Dat. kata ekurana, to his father. Accus. kata ekura, his father. AbL kata ekuranana^a, from his father. Dual. First Person Nom. maia ilinaka, the mother of us two. Gen. maia ilinakanaka, of the mother of us two. Dat. maia ilinakana, to the mother of us two. Accus. maia ilinaka, the mother of us two. Abl. maia ilinakananga, from the mother of us two. Second Person. Nom. kalja mbalaka, the elder brother of you two. Gen. kalja mbalakanaka, of the elder brother of you two. Dat. kalja mbalakana, to the elder brother of you two. Accus. kalja mbalaka, the elder brother of you two. Abl. kalja mbalakanaka, from che elder brother of you two. 9 The tliird person dual, ehiraiera^ \" their two,\" <and all persons of plural, as, anuiiaka^ \"ours;\" araganka, \"yours;\" and etnika, theirs ;\" arc treated exactly like those above. Besides these there are other possessive pronouns, which have both a reflective and a reciprocal sense, acting however as posses- sive pronouns as well ; in this case their meaning is, pertaining or belonging to any person. They are only used in the nominative case, and are undeclin- <able. nukara, mine. unkwangara, thine. ekui-ara, his, hers, it. ilinakara, our two. mbalakara, your two. ekuraratera, their two. anunakara, ours. aragankara, yours. etnikara, theirs. The following double forms have the same meanings : — nukiltja and nukaringa, \" mine ;\" unkwangiltja and unkwangaringciy \" thine,\" etc., but these two are like the first-named, regularly declined. Nearly all pronouns may be connected with all specified prepo' sitions in Chapter II — katjia nukanauna, \" to my child ;\" katjia 7mkalela, \" with or by my child,\" &c, PERSONAL PRONOUNS. a. First Person Singular. — There are two pronouns for \" I,\" I.e., ata or, the first a being dropped, ta. This is alwa^ys used when connected with a transitive verb, as, ta tuma, \" I beat,\" ta ilkuma, \" I eat ;\" whereas connected with an intransitive verb, there is usedjm^a, asjinga lima, \"I go,\" ov jinga indama, \" I sleep ;\" ta is indeclinable, but when, for instance, they say, \" God gives me life,\" where give is a transitive verb, they use jinga, and say, Altjirala jingana etata ntema. \" God to me life gives.\" But supposing they say, \" he died for me instead of me,\" this is f^xpressed by the possessive pronoun nuka, as, era nukanga iluka, \" he for me died,\" because is only used in the nominative and dative cases. h. Second person, unta, \" thou, you.\" This stands also only in nominative case ; where necessary they take for declension the possessive pronoun unkuKinga, \" thy.\" This is sometimes in genitive and dative cases abbreviated, viz.. 10 imkaiiganaka to ngaka, unkwangana to ngana, unkwaiiganf^a to nganga, as, ta nana ngana ntema, \" I this you to give,\" i.e., \" I give this to you.\" c. The third persons singular, dual, and plural are regularly declined, like possessive pronouns. List of personal pronouns : — ta or jinga, I eratera, they two. unta, thou anuna, we. era, he, si e, it arankara, you. ilina, we two etna, they, mbala, you two In connection with these is also used the suffix, arpa, \" self,\" by annexing it to the personal pronouns, ta, unta, era, etc., ta arpa, contracted tarpa, I, myself, unta arpa, contracted untarpa, thou, thyself, era arjDa, contracted erarpa, he, himself, and the others the same. This form is also used in the sense of \"not ordered,\" \" not compelled,\" as, ta erina ntankatjimakana, erarpa hitjima, \" I him called have not, he self comes,\" i.e., \" I have not called him ; he comes himself.\" Another form of emphatic sense is utara in singular, as, unta kala rula tiikala, tautara tuiai, \"you enough wood have cut, I shall cut,\" i.e., \" you have cut wood enough ; I shall cut.\" This is altered in dual and plural to umtera, as, ilinaivatera, mbalawatera. Besides those above-mentioned, there are the following Reflec- tive and Reciprocal Pronouns, viz. : — nukara, mine, unkivangara, \"thy,\"&c. Ex. reflective, ta nukara tulama, \" I myself beat.\" Ex. reciprocal, etnikara turirama, \" they beat each other.\" The only sign whether a pronoun is reflective or reciprocal is shown in the form of the verb — vide Chapter YIII. There are only two Demonstrative Pronouns — nana, this, nanatera, these two. nanirbera 1 , , , -these, nanankanaj tana, that. tanatera, those two. tanirbera ^ , , , , y those. tanankana j 11 Instead of tana is «also used, nakuna Jind arina, \"that.\" Declined in the same manner as possessive pronouns. There are also only two Interrogative Pronouns. nguna, \" who ?\" awl iwuna, \" what ?\" Dual and plural formed like those in tlie demonstrative piY>- nouns. The only difterence in the declension of these two is that the terminations of genitive, dative, and ablative cases, dual and plural, are inserted between the root and termination of the word, as — Dii,al. Gen. ngukatera 1 of which two ? Dat. ngunanatera ? to which two ? Abl. ngunangatera ? from which two ? Phi7xd.

The questions, nguna unta nama ? \" who are you 1 \", nouna nana nama ? \" what is that ? \", or nana, iwuna, ntitja ? \" this, what is if?\", are answered, jinga nama, \"I am;\" and nana, tana ntitja, \" this, that is it.\" RELATIVE AND INDEFINITE PRONOUNS. a. There are no Relative Pronouns in the language ; they are expressed either by repetition of the demonstrative pronouns,. nana and tana, as, atiia nala, nana tmurka alhuka, worana tukala, \" man this, this yesterday went away, the boy has beaten,\" i.e., \"the man who went away yesterday has beaten the boy ;\" or else by the participle of verb corresponding with the English participle, as, iluija tera, iltala mha^katnarakala, jiraka, \" axes two, on house were leaning, disappeared.\" i.e., the two axes, which were leaning on the house, disappeared.\" b. The Indefinite Pronouns are the following :— 12 arbuna and tueda, another, arbunatera, two others, arbunirbera and arbunankana, others, urbutjarbuna, some others, nkarba, a few others, tuedakatueda, others, nintamintnta, one by one, each. The declension of these is regular. There are three pairs of Correlative Pronouns, used only the nominative case : — ntakina 1 how, or in what way ? lakina, thus, this way. ntakinja ? how many ? lakinja, so many, ntakata ? how big ? nakakata, so big. CHAPTER V. Of Adverbs, of Conjunctions and Interjections. Derived adverbs, corresponding with English adverbs in \" h ;are formed by adding the particle \"la\" to adjectives, as '^ekaltala erguma^ \" he holds fast.\" Others are — a. adverbs of time. lata, now. lilika, soon, tmurka, yesterday, tmurkarbuna, the day before yesterday, ingunta, to-morrow, imanka, long ago. anma, by and by. ilangara 1 what time ? kuta, always. Others will be found in the vocabulary. h. OF PLACE. nana, here, itinja, near, longa, far. ntala ? where ? ntauma ? whither ? ntananga 1 whence 1 jthither. arinuna, j arina, there. 13 C.

The majority are combined with the verb. There is not even a proper word for the copula, and the following are the only ones found : — tuta, \\too, also, urungara, J ' etalinja, y^t. bula, but. wara, only, ngetjina, as, than, gurunga, then, nta (suffix), only. 14 Interjections. aai ! \" hear ! \" apu ! \"I am sorry.\" erai ! \" behold ! \" tjikai ! \" Ah ! \" calling attention, tjikabai ! \" woe.\" nturbai ! \" indeed, it is true.\" CHAPTER VI. Of Tenses, Voices, Number, and Moods of Verbs. There are three tenses. The present tense is indicated by the ter- mination \" ma \" added to the root of the verb, as, tiuna^ \" to ])eat.\" Tu is the root of the verb, but laa is the termination. This also represents the Infinitive of the verb, there being no other form to indicate it, so that the meaning is, \" I do beat,\" or \" I beat.\" The perfect tense is formed by adding the particle ka, or kala to the root of the verb, as, Uika, or tiikala, \" I have beaten.\" The first probably corresponds to the Imperfect and the latter to the Perfect, though the natives themselves cannot explain the difference. There is still another form for the perfect tense, viz., tjita, as, tutjita, \" I have beaten,\" which is very likely the Preterite, though it is difficult to determine the difference, as they have very little notion of time, and use often for remote time both forms, ilkukaJa and ilkutjita, which both mean \" I have eaten,\" but leaves it undecided whether yesterday or a long time ago. The future tense is formed by adding tjina to the root of the verb, as, tntjina, \"I shall beat;\" or, ilkutjina, \"I shall eat.\" OF VOICES. The Active Voice signifies always an action executed by a subject, but this may be : — a. Intransitive when it signifies an action remaining with the subject, as, antata alkncmhuma, \"the flower blooms;\" or, era lima, \" he goes.\" h. Transitive when it signifies that the action is or may be transferred to an object in the accusative case, as, ta kwatja njuma, \" I drink water;\" or, ta wora tukala, \" I have beaten the boy.\" The Middle Voice signifies an action which the subject exe- <3utes directly upon himself, as, ta nukara tulama, \" I beat my- self ;\" ta nukara tulaka, \"I have beaten myself;\" ta nukara tulitjina, \" I shall beat myself.\" As will be seen, the sign of the middle voice form is inserted in the middle of the verb, con- sisting of the particle la or li. 15 The reciprocal form, wliicli, of course, can only be with dual and plural, is known by the termination rania for dual and rirama for plural, as, ilina tarama, \" we two beat each other anuna tarinuua, \"we beat each other,\" A proper form for the Passive Voice does not exist, and it is •expressed by putting the subject in active form and the object in the dative case, as, atula ivorana iukala^ \"by the man to the boy is beaten.\" z.e., \" the boy is beaten by the man.\" > OF NUMBER. There are, as with nouns and pronouns, three numbers, i.e.^ singular, dual, and plural. These can be distinguished by the termination of tlie verb, if unconnected with a pronoun. The pronoun being used the plural foi-m of the verb may be omitted, as not being necessary to a clear understanding. There is no inflection on account of gender or persons, the latter being ex- pressed by the pronoun. The termination of the dual of in- transitive verbs is rama^ of plural rirama ; as, jinga lama, \" I go;\" ilina larama, \"we two go;\" annna larirama, \"we go.\" With transitive verbs the dual and plural are formed by using the intransitive verbs, •nciwa, \"to be;\" and ?am«, \"to go;\" as <iuxillary verbs, as, ta ilguma, \" I eat ;\" ili7ia ilgula narama, \" we two eat;\" etnct ilgula narirama, or etna ilgulta nama, \"we eat.\" The two expressions signify the same ; but the latter is very likely a form of participle, so that the meaning would be \" we are eating.\" It will be seen by this that the only difference is in using the participle, la, added to the root of the main verb. The dual and jDlural in the Middle voice double the particle, la, as, ilinakara tulala narama, \" we two beat ourselves ;\" ununakara tulala narira^na, \" we beat ourselves.\" OF THE MOODS OF VERBS. There are three chief moods — Indicative, Conditional, and Imperative. The form of the Indicative has been given already. The Conditional is formed by adding the termination, \" mara,\" to the root, as tn ilkumora, \"I should eat.\" The Imperative is formed by the particle, ai, added to the root, as, turri.' \"beat;\" ilgula nnrai ! \"you two eat!\" ilgula narirai ! \" eat you ! \" Another form, signifying an order to do it quickly, is composed of the repetition of the root of the verb and the insertion of the particle, \" /6(7,\" as tulbntuai ! \" beat quickly ! \" Also belonging to the Imperative may be reckoned the follow- ing form : — ta tui'ii I \" let me beat ! \" anuna ilkula narireui ! \"let us eat ! \" 16 These chief moods, as well as the accessory ones, have almost all a double form — one for a positive and one for a negative sense — as, Positive. Negative. ta tutjikana, I beat not. ta tuma, I beat, ta njuka, I drunk, ta gatjina, I shall cut. ta njutjimakana, I have not drunk. ta gatjigunia, I shall not cut. The other accessory moods are — -I. The Participle, meaning doing, as doing, while doing, &c., formed by the particles : \" manga^^ for present, \" mala^'' for perfect, and \" tjinanga^^^ for future tense, as, tumanga, while beating, tumala, after beating, tutjinanga, shall be beating. II. The Supine is formed by the particle, tjika, as, ta tutjika, to beat, or I must beat, ta tutjika bitjima, I came to beat, negative, ta tutjika nitjika, I to beat must not, i.e.^ I must not beat, There is another similar form, difficult to designate, formed by the particle, \" mitja or kutja,^' added to the root of verbs, as, tumitja or tiikutja, probably an abbreviation of tuma and itja, \" not,\" and of tuka and itja. The meaning of it is, lai I ta ngana tumitja, go ! I you not beat ! i.e., go, that I do not beat you ! Connected with the participle perfect is another form, tumal katana, meaning seeming to be so, as, Alinga airima limalakatana, \" Sun sees, going as if,\" i.e., \" the sun seems as if he were going ;\" or, Porpala livianga hira limalakatana, \" quickly when going, tree seem to go,\" i.e., \" When quickly going, the trees seem to go.\" CHAPTER YII. Of Auxiliary Verbs. Pure auxiliary verbs, as, to he, to have, may, can, kc, are not used as such, for the verbs in use for auxiliary verbs are not treated in the same way as in English. They act as absolute verbs as well; for example, nama, \"to be,\" means also \"to sit down.\" There are only two used as auxiliary verbs proper : nama, \" to be;\" and lama, \"to go.\" • 17 In addition to these, there is a class of verbs used for different purposes, and in various manners. I. To make out of intransitive verbs transitive ones, as, homerama, \"to arise or awake,\" is intransitive, but by omitting erama, and instead of tliis adding lilama, kumililama is formed, and it becomes transitive, with the meaning, \" to wake or call up or again, ntanknmn, \" to call,\" by adding the verb lelnma, \" to promise,\" it becomes a transitive verb, meaning \" to save, to redeem.\" II. To form verbs from substantives and adjectives, as, inguia, \"old,\" by adding to this erama, \"to see,\" it becomes an intran- sitive verb, \" getting or becoming old \" ( inguiermna), though erama is originally a transitive verb ; or to ntua., \" man,\" add erama, it becomes atuerama, \"becoming a man;\" or tjeba, \"a piece,\" to this add gama, \" to cut,\" thus, tjehagnma, \" to cut in pieces, to tear,\" &c. In similar ways are also used wuma, \" to hear;\" ilnma, \" to say ;\" ankama, \"to speak;\" albuma, \" to go back;\" arinama, \"to put;\" ntema, \"to give;\" indama, \"to sleep;\" anbuma, \"to touch;\" and many others. Before passing to the original or main verb, a table showing the conjugation of an auxiliary verb will be given in full, as it occurs so frequently. The present tense is given in full, but further on only the first person of each number is taken. See Table I., Appendix. In the same way are treated all intransitive verbs. CHAPTER YIII. Of Transitive Verbs and their Conjugation. The conjugation of the transitive verb is easy to comprehend,, as it needs only the proper pronoun to be put in its proper place. Instead of further explanation it will be best to give a table showing the conjugation of the transitive verb fuma, \"to beat,\"^ because it takes all tenses, moods, and voices, whilst others are more or less defective. As will be seen by Table IT., Appendix, only the first person has been given showing the conjugation of the reciprocal form. This is sufficient as the others are regular. Where the negative conjunction gunia (meaning \"no\" or \" none\") occurs, there is no particular form used ; neither is there one for the Participle future negative, the future of the Indica- tive negative being employed — vide Table I., Appendix. This is only the case with the regular conjugation of the simple verb. There are, however, an almost endless number of secondary no- tions connected and combined with the verb, which it is difficult to designate by any term. The natives combine almost everything B 18 Avitli the verb, wliich in English are expressed by adverbs of place, of time, of quality, of quantity, ct-c. These combinations make the use of the verb a sort of laby- rinth, through which it is a difficult task to follow or keep the €lue. The following chapters will be devoted to putting these into classes, so as to render the subject as simple as possible. CHAPTER IX. Verbs Combined with the form \"Tula.\" This form \"tula\" is used with the conjugation of the absolute verb in the active as well as in the middle voice, but whether as a, kind of supine or not, it is always used as a main verb. The other forms combined with this form act as auxiliary verbs, and most of them are treated as in Table I., Appendix. They iire the following : — uma or wuma, \" to hear ; \" noma, \" to be ; \" laiiii, \" to go ; \" albuma, to return ; \" ngama, \" to carry.\" Then there are several others where only tlie form tida is either altered or elongated ; these cannot be considered combined verbs, although they are contracted with particles or fragments of other words. For the sake of a more distinct arrangement both will be con- sidered in di-ferent paragraphs. VERBS COMBINED AVITII \"TULA.\" I. Tula nnma, \" to beat for a certain time constantly,\" wliich is expressed by the auxiliary veib naiua, \"to be\" or \"sit down;\" so that the meaning of it is \" I beat constantly or continually.\" This verb is conjugated in all the moods and voices of Table I., Appendix, except Middle and Reciprocal, which adopt the con- jugation of the absolute verb tuma, \"to beat.\" II. Tula lama ; the literal translation is, \" T go to beat,\" and it signifies an action in which the subject is in course of executing 4ind has not yet iinished, similar to the present participle. This verb can also be treated as i. As, however, the auxiliary verb lama cannot have a reciprocal form, the termination of this must be added or ratlier inserted for reciprocal meanings, as, nnuna kara tiirirala lamn, \" we are beating each other ;\" aniuiakara turirala litjina, \" we shall beat each other,\" &c. III. T?da tula lama ; a reduplication of the former verb, and therefore meaning \" to beat sometimes ({uickly or hastily.\" Treat- ment, the same as the foregoing. IV. Tula um'i : the literal translation would be, \" T hear to beat,\" but the usual meaning is, \" I beat once.\" This verb also takes all moods and voices of Table II., Appendix. The conjuga- tion of these verbs can easily be formed, for the main verb, here iuln^ remains unchanged, and after omitting the termination m i 19 of the swoiulary \\ erb, uma oi' n'/t/iur, tlio tcnninations of tlio uioods and ^'oiees are added to the root of the secoiidai y verb, a.-i shown in Table 1., Appendix, Only two slight alterations exist, one in the reciprocal form, which runs thus, Uinakdra turnla /varama, \"we two beat each other once;\" (iiutnakara tarala fvurirania, \" we beat each other once and the other witli the future positive as well as negative, where the form is not f/tda afji yuiiia, but ta tAilaJinja f/uniff, \" F shall not beat once i/ina tnhi wurinja c/auia, \" we two shall not beat once,\" Sic. Middle Voice: nuhara tulmcnjn (/miia, \"I shall not beat my- jself once;\" Uinakara tula iimririnja giinia, \" we two sliall not beat ourselves once.\" Reciprocal : annnakara t^irnla ■nmririnja gnmri^ \" we shall not bejit each other once.\" v. Tula albuiua or tulalhuina, meaning, \" arrived at anot!ier place beating,\" or \" arrived I beat.\" Conjugation similar to iv. VERBS COMBINED WITH OTHER VERBS OR FRAGMENTS OF VERBS. I. Tulie7iama : a peculiar form used before a following Supine, as, ta tulienaka, eriita ilutjika, \" I have beaten, that he died.\" Active Voice: Ta tulieii'ima, \"I beat;\" ilina tuliehi narauia, we two beat ;\" annua tuliela nariraiua, \"we beat.\" Middle Voice : nukara tulalienama, \"I beat myself;\" Hitia- kara tulaliela narama, \"we two beat ourselves;\" miunakdrri f.uhiliela narirama, \" we beat ourselves.\" Reciprocal : Uinakara turalienama, \" we two beat each other.\" (3ther forms obtained by annexing the terminations of Table II., Appendix. II. Tulabniiia, \" beating by walking about.\" The complete form for \" to walk about \" is hala noma ; hence tulabunia is only an abbreviation of tula and hala nama. These abbreviations are very common in this language, and make it difficult to under- stand the real meaning of a phrase where this and other similar abbreviations are used. The conjugation is the same as in Table I. Appendix, for huma acts as an auxiliary verb. III. Tulinja nyama, meaning, \"to beat always.\" Conjugation as in Table I., Appendix. The termination of Middle and Reciprocal Voices are inserted in or rather added to tula, as, Middle : nukara tulalinja ngnma, \" I beat myself always ;\" Uinakara tulalirija Qigarama, \" we two beat ourselves always.\" Reciprocal : ilinaknra turalinja ngama, \" we two beat each other always;\" anunakara turiralinja ngama, \" w^e beat each other always.\" 20 CHAPTER X. Forms of Verbs Combined with the Supine. In some of these combinations the Supine is easily distin- guished, whereas in others it is abbreviated, the meaning showing- its existence nevertheless. Again, it is sometimes combined with a simple verb, whilst in other cases it contains other particles. The literal translation is not in many cases absolutely correct,, but still sufficiently so to lead to a right interpretation. As there are only a few of these forms they will be considered seriatim. I. Tutjikalnma, evidently consisting of the Supine, tutjika,, and the auxiliary verb, lamo, \" to go,\" literal translation would be \"I go to beat,\" but the usual meaning is \"I beat from above to beneath\" — i.e.^ downward. II. Tutjinjama, where the termination ha of the Supine is omitted, and also the secondary verb is abbreviated from intitjinjoma into injama, \" to rise or ascend.\" The meaning of it is \" I beat from beneath to above or upwards.\" However, this meaning is often altered in other veibs, as, for instance, ilkuma^ \" to eat,\" where ilkutjikalama means \" to eat in the evening, tO' sup,\" and ilkutjiyijama means to eat in the morning, to break- fast.\" The conjugation of both is the same as shown in Table I., Appendix ; and the Middle and Reciprocal forms are treated as tulinja ngama (see chapter ix.) III. Tutjika ma nitjikana, or Tutjikamanitjikana. The particle ma receives a very extensive use in this language, as, for in- stance, aJtamnlta, \"day by day\" or \"daily;\" nintamininta,. \"one by one ;\" jmtamnjmta, \"hill by hill\" or \"every hill.\" In the present case it means \" again,\" so that the meaning is \"I beat again not being\" — i.e., \" I shall not beat again.\" The posi- tive phrase \"I shall beat again\" they ex-press hy tutjik antenna, where ntema means \"again.\" Conjugation similar to above. IV. Tiitjikerama, \" going to beat,\" is treated also in the same manner, as are also the two following : — V. Tntjilhitiiima, \" come to beat,\" and, VI. TiUjalbuma, \" returned to beat. VII. Tutjigunula, a somewhat different form, meaning \"to beat by and by, not now.\" It is different, because, firstly, it is only a form of future tense ; and secondly, its conjugation differs, as- will be seen l)y the following : — tn tutjignnnJa, \" I shall beat by and by;\" ilina tula norinja gunaln, \"we two shall beat;\" aniiiin fiila n(n'irinjn gunaJa, \" we shall beat.\" Middle : nnkara ttdala ninja gnnaJa, \" I shall beat myself ; \" ilinakara tulala 7inri7ija giinnla, \" we two shall beat ourselves.\" Reciprocal: etnikara turirivja gnnnla, \"they shall beat each other.\" 21 VIII. There remain only two more of tliese forms to consider, jind tliey are not really forms of verbs, but consist only of a particle annexed to the Supine, which then gives the verb an- other meaning. The lirst is tiifjiknt/jilala, \"that T may beat (juite alone,\" as, arhuna i7iknrnkn ta jainama, miJaira ilhnilif/jikat- jilnlrj, \"the others all T send away, that I may wash myself quite alone.\" The other is tutjikatjora or fAitjikntnnga., both meaning \" tliat I may beat. Ex. : era erina kwatjuna retimjaka, ekurara ilknilitji- \" he him to the water led that he may wash hntjora or tang a. himself.\" Neither can be brought into other forms. CHAPTER XI. Some other Forms of the Imperative. Two of these have been seen already in Chapter VII., whicli can consequently be omitted here. But there are still some others, which have to be considered, but as there is neither any irregularity as regards conjugation, nor any difficulty in the form, they need only be specified as follows : — I. tulatana ! beat ! tula naratana ! beat you two I tula nariratana ! beat you ! II. tula nalgurai ! beat a little or slowly ! tula naralgurai ! beat you two a little ! tula nariralgurai ! beat you a little ! III. tualgurai ! beat quickly ! turalgurai ! you two beat quickly ! turiralgurai ! you beat quickly ! IV. tuarpa ! beat for certain ! tula nararpa ! you two beat for certain, tula narirarpa ! beat you for certain ! CHAPTER XII. Verbs combined with \"tutna,\" and Derivations therefrom. There are only two expressions with the original form \" tutna,\" which seems to correspond to the Greek optative mood, for it means to wish or desire to beat. The first is, ta tutna, \" I wish to beat,\" and the other, ta tutna nama, \" I would beat, being angry.\" There is no difficulty as regards conjugation, and they are treated in the same way as other verbs, the only differences being — 22 I. In the negati\\ e form, which runs thus : ta tutna gunia,. \"I do not wish to beat ilina tula naratna gunia, \" We two do not wish to beat whilst in the other verbs it runs, ta iutna nitjikana, \" I would not beat.\" II. In tlie form of Middle and Reciprocal, where the first % erb, \" tutna,''^ takes the general form : iiuhara tulatnn, ilina kara tula naratna, tfec, but the other verb, \" tiUna noma,'' is treated as shown by Table I., Appendix, viz., nul'ara tulatna noma, ilinakara tulatna narama. Reciprocal : ilinakara turatna nama, etc. Another verb belonging to this class is, \" ta tuatnama,^^ mean- ing, / heat only a little. Other verbs are altered similarly, as, ta ilkuvia, \" I eat ta ilkutna, \" I wisli to eat ta ilhwatnama, \" I eat a little.\" It is treated like the last-mentioned one, the negative form only being slightly altered, namely, from tuatnitjikaiia into tuat- ninja gunia, however, it is scarcely in use, for they express them- selves then positively and say \" I beat very much.\" All other tenses and moods of these are formed regularly. From this last verb there are derived a number of other forms of verbs, which, as they present no difficulty as regards conjuga- tion, being mostly treated like those above, need not be con- sidered especially, but it will be enough to enumerate them and give the translation. They are the following : — I. ta tuatna lama, \" I beat arrived at another place.\" II. ta tnalbn nama, \" I beat sometimes arrived at another place.\" III. ta tuatnitnima, I beat continually.\" IV. ta tualbuntama^ \" I beat running away.\" V. ta tnatnanma, \" I beat some.\" VI. ta tuntal album, ta tulhatuntnama, ta tuatilhuma, all three meaning \" returning homeward, I beat on the road\" or \"between another place and my home.\" VII. ta tuatnalbuma, \"come here\" or \"hither, I beat,\" mean- ing, of course, from the point or place the speaker is standing. MIL ta tuatnilhitnilalhuma, \" returning come near my home, I beat\" — i.e., \"almost returned I beat.\" Of the two forms, tuatilhuma and tuatilhitnima , it is to be re- marked that they are changed in the Middle voice into tulatulalhuma and tulatulilbitiiima, and in the Reciprocal form into turntnralhuma and turaturilhitnima. The particle of the Dual and Plural, however, is inserted, as is usual, in the auxiliary verb, nama or ninia. There are, a<a:aiii, three other verbs which .ue coimeeted with these, as will be seen by the translation - I. ta tunnjomay \" returning I beat on the road,\" which is in Dual and Plural of the Active as well as of Middle and Reciprocal connected with the auxiliary verb lama, as, ilin i tiV'iitja Jfirnnn, ilinahara tiiHnja lirtntin, ka. II. ta til injilhitninii, \"I beat shortly after started on road going home.\" III. ta tuanjiJfnuna, \" almost arrived at home 1 beat.\" Both are regularly conjugated; the particle of the Middle la or li is added to the root of the verb, as nukara tulinjilbitninia and tiilijalhiuna. There remain only two more forms to be mentioned, which have both one meaning, only the latter is augmented — I. ta tunama. ilina tunerama. anuna turira nama. Middle : nukara tula nama. Reciprocal : ilinakara tura nama. II. tnlhatunama, \" I beat going away quickly.\" Corresponding with the latter is tiiatilhnnnma ov ill walhilbani mi , \" I beat or eat going away on the road. CHAPTER XITI. Sundry Moods and Forms not mentioned in Chapter VI. There are some conditional forms which have to be mentioned here, as they are of frequent occurrence — I. ta tumalamihana namara, I should not have beaten ; ii. ta tumaranga or tnmalanga, \" I should have beaten ;\" as, for example, unta nala namanga, kaija nulla ihimalamihana namara, \" if you would have been here, my brother would not liave died,\" i.e., \" if thou had'st been here my brother had not died.\" The first can also be expressed by putting before the conditional mood the negative word itja, \" no,\" as, ifja iluinara, \" had not died ;\" or by tumalikananga, as, unta hitjimalika7ianga, kalja nuka ilumara, \" if thou hads't not come here, my brother would have died.\" Again, the first form can be used without the conditional, namara, then meaning, \" 7iot beaten,\" or \" because not beaten ;\" as, era namalamihana, mandera inimalamihaiia, \" because he was not here, he got no shirt.\" When a question is put to anyone else, the verb takes another form, as, ivoka unta tuikana ? \" Why you have beaten not 1 \" 24 The same form can also have a conditional meaning, as, for example, era ntaineikannnga, ta ntaiiiakala, \" because he has not speared, I have done so.\" The same form without the termination of the participle, \" nga,^' \" tuikana,\" has again another meaning, as, rula jinga entai, ta tuikana, \" give me a stick that I may beat,\" which is rather a form of optative. Another form is moka unta tumnrpa, or perfect ruuka unta tukarpa ? which is a prohibitive form, meaning, \" what for you beat ? \" at the same time expressing, it is not right to do so, and also that the speaker himself saw it, which we cannot express in one word at all. Finally, there are still to be specified some forms which are only either reduplications of the verb, or else augmentations. Such are — I. \" Tufjinahuta tutjinahuta,^^ or \" tutnahutatunabnta^^ both meaning, \" I shall beat again.\" II. Tulinja tulindama „ \" to beat always /\" tvulinja tvrdin- dama, \" to hear always /\" lalinja lalindama, \"to go always.\" III. tulinja mhura, also signifying, \" to beat always.\" IV. tulatulauma, \" to beat seldom;\" rualilalauma, \"to run seldom \" (water in creeks), as, mbonta rualilalauma \" The Finke runs seldom.\" v. tuma, \" I have finished beating ;\" ilkuma, \" I have finished eating.\" The Negative is expressed by tuni- kana and ilkunikana, \" I have not finished beating or eating.\" VI. bitjima, \" to come,\" but bitjiinalalhura, \" just arrived.\" CHAPTER XIV. Conclusion. It is evident from the foregoing that the language of these Australian natives is by no means as simple as many are in- clined to think. Certainly, as jompared with the languages of other more intelligent races, it is to be called poor ; but the chief cause of this is, according to my opinion, their isolation. Owing to the localities capable of supporting human life being so far distant from each other, it necessitates a division into very small fragments of tribes, each often consisting only of a few families. However, for objects that they can see and hear of in their daily life, they have words and expressions enough. Take for instance the verb, how many different forms they can obtain from a single verb ! As seen by Table II., Appendix, they can form not less than 300 different phrases. 25 Now there are many forms, wliicli liave been considered in tlio foregoing chapters, which can be brought into all the moods and voices of Table II., Appendix. There are 30 at the least which can be thus regularly conjugated, that means, from one mood can be made 9,000 ditlerent plirases. There are others again which can only be used in some moods and tenses, forming about GOO phrases, so that 9,600 expressions may be derived from one mood, Certainly there are some verbs which cannot be conjugated regularly, but are more or less defective. For instance, \"to eat\" cannot have either a Middle or a Reciprocal form ; but the tran- sitive verbs generally can be brought into all moods and voices. Those mentioned do not embrace all, but they are those mostly used. These pages do not profess to give a complete grammar of the language, but merely such an outline as may give a general in- dication of its structure. There are many expressions related herein which would require a philologist to classify or properly arrange, and any hints in this direction would be thankfully re- ceived by the writer. Though it is scarcely worth while learning the language of these tribes, as their number is small, and it would be mucli easier at once for a missionary to teach them the English language, yet how can this be done unless first their language is understood ? For every English word must be first translated to them, if they are to properly understand it. Experience has shown that many of these natives can speak more or less English, but when questioned as to the meaning of words, they either are unable to answer, or else they give a wrong translation. For instance, a young man, who gave to all questions put to him the same stereotyped answer, \" All right, my boy,\" most likely heard this expression once from a white man, and thought it would answer upon all occasions. This only shows how ignorant they often are about the expressions they use, and how necessary it is to learn first their language, though it demands a great expendi- ture of labour, which, however, carries its own reward in a better mutual understanding between teacher and pupil. •26 APPENDIX.
