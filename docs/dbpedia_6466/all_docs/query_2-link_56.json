TROLLEY WIRE FEBRUARY 2010 SYDNEY’S UNLUCKIEST TRAMBy Ian Saxon One of Sydney’s newest trams at the time only lastedone day in service before being destroyed in anaccident.

The accidentoccurred on 9 May 1952 and a report of the accident inSydney’s Daily Telegraph newspaper stated: “At Petersham, a new steel corridor type tram wascompletely burnt out after colliding with a motor lorryin Crystal Street. “The front of the tram smashed through the petroltank of the lorry.
