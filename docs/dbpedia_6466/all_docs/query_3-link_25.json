To make\n\nmatters worse, whereas\n\nthe 218F buses from the\n\ncity bypassed Flinders\n\nMedical Centre during\n\npeak-hour, according to\n\nthe new timetable all\n\nbuses, except two 212X\n\nbuses, will now detour\n\ninto Flinders Medical\n\nCentre extending the\n\njourney by several\n\nminutes."
