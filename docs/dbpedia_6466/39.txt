When will Torrens

Transit and Trans-

Adelaide (the body which

I understand must

approve all bus timetable

changes) get the bus

service to Aberfoyle Park

and Flagstaff Hill right?

The introduction of a

212 service is welcome

(Hills & Valley

Messenger, January 9).

However, just over a

year ago the heavily

patronised peak-hour

express 218 service was

discontinued.

Now they have introduced

a peak-hour

express 212X service.

Unfortunately it is

express in name only; it

is no faster than the 218F

buses running at about

the same time! To make

matters worse, whereas

the 218F buses from the

city bypassed Flinders

Medical Centre during

peak-hour, according to

the new timetable all

buses, except two 212X

buses, will now detour

into Flinders Medical

Centre extending the

journey by several

minutes.
