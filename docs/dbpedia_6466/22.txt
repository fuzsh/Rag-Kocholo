Tonsley Railway Line is a rail route in Adelaide, South Australia, that stems off the Noarlunga Centre railway line to end in Mitchell Park opposite Science Park and close to the Flinders University and Medical Centre. There have been many proposals to extend the line so that it ends closer to the Flinders Campus, but nothing has eventuated. The line was constructed in 1965 to serve the former Chrysler/Mitsubishi plant at Clovelly Park, which closed in March 2008 [cite web | title = Mitsubishi could announce Adelaide closure today | publisher = Australian Car Advice | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/10032/mitsubishi-could-announce-adelaide-closure-today/ | accessdate = 2008-04-28 ]

The line is single track for its entire length from the junction near Ascot Park to the terminus at Tonsley, with two intermediate stations. Services operate hourly on weekdays with trains operating slightly more regularly in peak periods.

ervices

No services operate after at night after 6pm or on weekends [cite web | title = Noarlunga & Tonsley line timetable | publisher = Adelaide Metro | url = http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/routes/timetables/Noarlunga_ttable.pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-28 ] , and were only extended to operate during weekday off-peak periods in 2004. Stations between Woodlands Park and Adelaide are also serviced by services on the Noarlunga and Belair lines.

Bus route 297 services the areas surrounding Tonsley, Clovelly Park and Mitchell Park stations 7 days a week, operating more frequently than train services [cite web | title = Route 297 Map | publisher = Adelaide Metro | url = http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/ttsearch.php?searchtext=297&action=search | accessdate = 2008-04-28 ] . Various bus routes also operate past the terminus at Tonsley which run frequently to Westfield Marion, Flinders University and other destinations, however few rail passengers transfer to these services.

None of the stations on the line are staffed, have any ticketing facilities or upgraded lighting, having not had any substantial upgrades since initial construction [cite web | title = (Photospam) A line still travelled (or aiding the enemy!) | publisher = Railpage Australia | url = http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11340450.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-28 ] . Most services are operated by 3000 class railcars, except for one peak service which is operated with a 2000 class railcar [cite web | title = South Australian Railways - F.A.Q | publisher = Railpage Australia | url = http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t12600.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-28 ] .
