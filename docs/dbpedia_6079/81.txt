Description

The Merry Wives Of Windsor is a German opera written by Otto Nicolai in 1845 based on the Shakespearean comedy of the same name. Nicolai had achieved great success with his Italian operas, but this became a German favorite. The Overture is a success in its own right, and even inspired a short film produced by conductor Johnny Green that won the Oscar for Best Short Subject in 1954. This energetic grade 4 arrangement contains many themes from the overture and will make a great concert opener. Duration 3:40.
