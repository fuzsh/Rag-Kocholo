        "text": "Few opera overtures afford as much pleasure as the one German composer Otto Nicolai wrote for “Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor,” his adaptation of Shakespeare’s “The Merry Wives of Windsor.” It sings; it dances; it makes you want to hear the rest of the opera. But you hardly ever do. So kudos to Boston Midsummer Opera for presenting it, with John Moriarty’s English translation, at the Tsai Performance Center.\n\nThere are, it’s true, fewer of the Bard’s comic characters in the opera than in the play. Salomon Hermann Mosenthal’s libretto dispenses with Nim, Bardolph, Pistol, Shallow, Sir Hugh Evans, Mistress Quickly, and Shakespeare’s first act. But the core of the play remains. Falstaff, at liberty (some would say on the loose) in Windsor, is wooing Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, two wives said to have control of their husbands’ purse strings. He might be having greater success if he hadn’t sent each woman the same love letter. (They compare the letters, of course.) Meanwhile, Page and his wife are at odds over who should marry their daughter, Anne. Page favors rich, feckless Slender; his wife’s choice is the equally rich and feckless Dr. Cajus. Anne, for her part, has fallen for young Fenton, and love wins out.\n\nThe three ladies dominate the opera even more than they do the play, and some of Mosenthal’s changes could be called improvements, as when Anne dupes her two unwanted suitors, both in disguise, into marrying each other. Nicolai tightropes between German and Italian models and seems always to have Mozart in mind. Falstaff, introduced with an ironic burst of martial glory, has a drinking song, “When I was young at my mother’s breast,” filched from “Twelfth Night.” Nicolai accords Fenton and Anne more romantic room than Shakespeare gives them; at the end, they dress up as Oberon and Titania, from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Fenton’s big aria, to burbling flute, is “Hear the lark”; Anne’s is “Well, then, I have made up my mind.”\n\nThe focal point of Stephen Dobay’s attractive set is Mistress Ford’s kitchen, a cozy affair with pots and pans hung over the hearth. The outdoor action is backed by a wooden palisade topped by a representation of the Windsor skyline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Friday’s performance had its disappointments. The 21-piece orchestra, under BMO music director Susan Davenny Wyner, struggled to shape the Overture and generally lacked snap. There were no supertitles, and most of what the women sang was unintelligible. The spoken dialogue was clear enough, but it bordered on banal and too often had nothing to do with either Shakespeare or Mosenthal. The beginning of the second act was cut (not the worst choice), and Slender was gratuitously added to the company drinking with Falstaff. Stage director Antonio Ocampo-Guzman pushed the opera’s portrait of clever women and clueless men toward one-\n\ndimensionality.\n\nThere was powerful singing, more earnest than characterful. Martha Guth and Stephanie Kacoyanis did make a gratifyingly chummy pair as Mistress Ford and Mistress Page. But Alex Richardson was, despite his full-throated “lark” aria, a stolid Fenton, and Sara Heaton’s Anne was standard-issue ingénue. Dean Elzinga and Ricardo Lugo brought limited life to Ford and Page; Elzinga in particular seemed flummoxed by his red patchwork jacket. Jason Budd was a blowhard of a Falstaff, but an authoritative, lovable blowhard. He gave the production its comic heart.\n\nJeffrey Gantz can be reached at jeffreymgantz@gmail.com."
