        "text": "Carl Otto Ehrenfried Nicolai\n\nCarl Otto Ehrenfried Nicolai was born in 1810 in Prussia. His father, Carl Ernst Daniel Nicolai taught him as a child, and Nicolai was recognized as a child Prodigy. When he was seventeen he went to Berlin to study with Carl Friederich Zelter. He wrote his first symphony in 1831 when he was twenty-one. He composed 5 operas all of which were in Italian except Die Lustigen Weiber Von Windsor or The Merry Wives of Windsor, which is based on Shakespeare’s play The Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nIn 1844 he was offered the position of Kapellmeister at the Berlin Cathedral, which had recently been vacated by Felix Mendelssohn. On May 11 1849 he died due to a stroke. This was only two months after the Premiere of The Merry Wives of Windsor and two days after his appointment as Hofkapellmeister at the Berlin Staatsoper. On the day he died he was elected to the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor – Overture\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor was very popular in the 19th century, and was one of the most popular. Unfortunately Giuseppe Verdi wrote a very similar opera forty years later (after Nicolai was dead) called Falstaff. Verdi was well known for his first Opera, called Nabucco which made him pretty famous. The Opera had originally been offered to Nicolai, but he thought it was ridiculous and not fit to be made into an opera. Later he angrily claimed that Verdi’s opera was “really horrible”. So in this way Giuseppe Verdi eclipsed The Merry Wives of Windsor and it never went on to success around the world.\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor, if you aren’t familiar with the story, it’s a comedy. It’s about Falstaff, who if you’re familiar with the play Henry IV, is the jolly knight who really only eats, sleeps, and drinks. In this play he is completely broke so his plan is to seduce Mistress Ford and/or Mistress Page, because they control their husbands money. He sends them identical letters asking them to meet. Unfortunately for him they are friends, so they tell each other about the letters. They are outraged that he sent them both identical letters. And that he want’s them to cheat on their husbands. That too.\n\nThe Wives decide to humiliate him to get revenge. And on top of this some of Falstaff’s “friends” decide to tell the Wive’s husbands. Master Ford is extremely jealous, and decides to get a little revenge of his own. Basically everyone decides they would like to get some revenge on Falstaff because by the end of the book the whole town is in on a plot to dress up as fairies and confuse (attack) him. At the ends he admits that he was wrong and everyone is happy. So, in case you are confused, here is a picture.\n\nAnd here’s Falstaff in case you were feeling bad for him."
