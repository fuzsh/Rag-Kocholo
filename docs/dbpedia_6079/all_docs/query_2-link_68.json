        "text": "JUST around the corner is the quadricentennial of Shakeapeare's birth. The record industry has done honorably by his plays and poems, as the discography on page 24 points out. But if the music of Shakespearean verse has been well‐served, the music inspired by it has not.\n\nSo far, the only contributions this year have been one complete and one abridged verson of Verdi's “Falstaff,” concurrent with the Metropolitan Opera's new production of the opera. These are important and welcome. The wish to snarl an ungrateful “It's about time” is tactfully repressed.\n\nFortunately, the recordings are admirable in their respective ways. The full‐length version comes from RCA. Victor (three disks, LM 6132; stereo LSC 6132); which also released the recording of the historic broadcasts under Toscanini. The new album, made in Rome last summer, was to be conducted by Fritz Reiner, but after his death was turned over to Georg Solti.\n\nIf Mr. Solti has not completely solved the problem of how to keep the score bubbling along and yet invest it with humanity at the same time, he is not alone in this predicament. Even the Toscanini interpretation has been accused of being little more than a “blueprint.” Mr. Solti sees to it that the music is impeccably and transparently played by the RCA Italian Opera Orchestra and that the almost breathless momentum of the opera is maintained.\n\nThe cast is excellent. It would be hard to imagine one that sustained a better average in vocal and dramatic ability, Geraint Evans, a highly regarded Falstaff in the opera house, makes all the points in his music with intelligence, taste and vocal discipline. The same can be said of Giulletta Simionato's Dame Quickly.\n\nRobert Merrill's Ford is luscious in sound, satisfactory as a characterization, and Ilva Ligabue is a delightfully well ‐ poised Mistress Ford. One suspects that the softness of Mirella Freni's high tones are obtained by distance from the microphone, but it does not diminish the effectiveness of her lovely singing as Nanetta. Alfredo Kraus is a properly lyric Fenton, vocally suave.\n\nThe remaining roles are expertly sung by Rosalind Elias, as Meg; John Lanigan, as Dr. Caius; Piero de Palma, as Bardolph, and Giovanni Foiani, as Pistol. With its brilliant engineering and sensible use of stereo, this is the best available recording of “Falstaff.”\n\nIt would be expected that this opera would defy abridgment and that it was a silly idea of London Records to issue a single‐disk version of the work (A 4154; stereo OSA 1154). And silly it is, in a way, since the recording's merit is in giving a sampling of other singers' interpretations—something that matters only to those who know the opera in its entirety already.\n\nHaving taken it on, London has fulfilled its responsibility shrewdly. It has managed to get about half the opera's total playing time of almost two hours on the disk, including all Of Act II, Scene 1, which features Falstaff, Dame Quickly and Ford. The excerpts are not in chronological order and some are cut off abruptly, but that is inherent in the nature of the idea.\n\nIn any case, here is Fernando Corena's Falstaff, fatter sounding than Mr. Evans because he has a darker, bluffer voice and because he has a lip‐smacking way with the Italian text. Also earthier is Regina Resnik's Dame Quickly. Rénato Capecchi's Ford is vocally dry but conveys brilliantly the many levels on which the character's mind is operating in his visit to Falstaff.\n\nMiss Ligabue repeats her Performance as Mistress Ford. Lydia Marimpietri and Luigi Alva sing charmingly as the young lovers. Férnanda Cadoni (Meg), Robert Bowman (Bardolph) and Michael Langdon (Pistol) complete the cast satisfactorily. Edward Downes leads the New Symphony Orchestra of London in a bright, competent performance.\n\nSo we have one and a half versions of “Falstaff” to honor Shakespeare's 400th birthday. The fact leads inevitably to the collectors' old and well‐loved game of, “Why doesn't someone record suchand‐such a work?” It is assumed, sensibly, that most of the important scores inspired by Shakespeare's plays are available, but that does not stop indulgence in some fine flights of fancy.\n\nIf we have Verdi's “Falstaff” and Nicolai's “The Merry Wives of Windsor” on disks, we do not have Holst's “At the Boar's Head” or Vaughan Williams's “Sir John in Love,” not to mention other operas derived from the same sources by Adam, Balfe, Dittersdorf, Ritter, Pacini (“Il Gioventú di Enrico V”) and Philidor (“Herne le chasseur”). (Unbelievably, Elgar's fine symphonic study on “Falstaff” is currently out of the catalogue, although it was once available in superior performances.)\n\n“Romeo and Juliet” has, perhaps, been the biggest inspiration for composers, and there is accordingly a greater number of these works on disks.\n\nThey include the Berlioz choral symphony, the Gounod and Zandonai operas, the Prokofiev ballet, the Tchaikovsky fantasy‐overture and duet, a set of musical sketches by Kabalevsky. But where are the operas by such composers as Bellini, Malipiero and Sutermeister, not to mention those by Dalayrac (banally called “Tout pour l'amour”), Ivry (“Amants de Vérone”) and Zingarelli, to mention just a few.\n\n“Hamlet” has fascinated composers less for purposes of opera — understandable considering the nature of the play, although both Berlioz and Bizet toyed with the idea—than as the basis of orchestral pieces. Yet even here there are recordings only of Tchaikovsky's fantasyoverture and excerpts from Ambrose Thomas's opera.\n\nSecondary composers who have turned their hands to overtures, symphonic discourses and ballets on the subject have not had a chance on disks — Blacher, Frank Bridge, Gade, Edward German, Joachim, Constant Lambert, Lekeu and our own Edward MacDowell.\n\nVerdi's “Macbeth” can fortunately be heard on records as well as in the opera house, but it should not cost much to record a piano solo by Smetana called “Macbeth and the Witches.” This might be included with a recording of a piano duet called “Timon of Athens” by Odön Peter József de Mihalovich.\n\nIf there is a recording of Berlioz's “Beatrice et Bénédict” there is none of Mojsisovics's “Viel Lärm um Nichts,” which derive from “Much Ado About Nothing.” If there are recordings of Verdi's “Otello” and Dvorak's “Othello” Overture, there is none of the Rossini opera.\n\nThe magical qualities of “The Tempest” have tempted almost as many composers as “Romeo” into transmuting it into musical form. As an opera it is known variously as “Stormen,” “Sturm,” “Geisterinsel,” “Zauberinsel” and “Tempesta.” The composers go literally from A to Z—Kurt Atterberg to Johann Zumsteeg.\n\nConsider the case of Mario Castelnuovo‐Tedesco, who has written at least seven overtures based on Shakespeare plays, 12 books of settings of the songs from the plays, and an opera, “The Merchant of Venice,” that won $8,000 in an Italian contest. Except possibly for some of the songs, none of these has been recorded.\n\nA genuine service might be performed by recording Wagner's “Das Liebesverbot, oder Die Novize von Palermo,” his third opera, based on “Measure for Measure.”\n\nLondon Records, which has recorded so much of Benjamin Britten's music, has to date indicated that it will not do so in the case of his “A Midsummer Night's Dream.”\n\nNone of this takes into account the thousands of settings of Shakespeare's songs and poems or the hundreds of incidental musical scores composed for productions of the plays."
