This short film can be watched here: Overture to The Merry Wives of Windsor (1953)

The classical music in this short film is fine--good even, but there is nothing really special or noteworthy about it filmwise. In fact, the actual camera work lacks any innovation or creativity. The whole film is basically one wide angle shot with some panning. An opportunity to really feature the instrument groups was lost. As far as its contribution to the arts, this film and short film like it did help to bring orchestra and music to those who might not have access to performances in a concert hall.

This short film was the winner of the Academy Award for Short Subject, One Reel for 1953.

Oscar-winning short from MGM was one of their earliest examples of showing off their Symphony Orchestra led by the talented Johnny Green. Otto Nicolai's "The Merry Wives of Windsor" has the one-hundred plus piece orchestra doing some of their best work as the unknown director sits back and delivers one of the best looking visual shorts out there.

This short was shot in Cinemascope and goes to about 2.55:1 and is a real treat on the eye. Green calmly leads the group and the camera goes in, out and side to side as it tries to capture the beauty of all the instruments. The music itself is great and Green perfectly handles everything and delivers a fine performance of the song. This is the fourth or fifth short I've seen featuring him and he's been impressive each time out. The beautiful visuals and wonderful music make it easy to understand why this thing walked away with an Oscar.
