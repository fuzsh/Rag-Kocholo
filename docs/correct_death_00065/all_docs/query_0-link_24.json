        "text": "In this article, drawing on works of Jan Kieniewicz, I address the question of the status of Central and Eastern Europe, with a focus on Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. I tackle questions of ethnicity, nation-building and overall characteristics of the region in both historical and anthropological perspectives. Can you speak about any common identity of the region or it is rather a peripheral area constituting a collection of states gravitating in multiple directions towards more powerful (former) hegemons? How historical changes affected ethnic and national identities in the region? Can you write a common history of CEE? To what extent the national histories in the region have been shaped internally, and not by external actors? I argue that writings of Kieniewicz provide an original insight into these problems and I supplement his findings with some personal observations.\n\nContents Mysterious knocks, flying potatoes and rebellious servants: Spiritualism and social conflict in late imperial Russia Julia Mannherz The Ukrainian Stundists and Russian Jews: a collaboration of evangelical peasants with Jewish intellectuals in late imperial Russia Sergei Zhuk “Forebears”, “saints” and “martyrs”: the politics of commemoration in Bulgaria in the 1880s and 1890s Stefan Detchev Celebrating the nation: the case of Upper Silesia after the plebiscite in 1921 Andrzej Michalczyk Three states, one common past: chance or malediction? The role of history and historiography for the formation of collective identities and mutual relations in Belarus, Lithuania and Poland Rüdiger Ritter The Bulgarian monarchy: a politically motivated revision of a historical image in a post -socialist transitional society Markus Wien Emerging institutional order? National Investment Funds in Poland Maria Aluchna\n\nIn February 1990 a major conference dedicated to the recent history of the East of Europe was organised at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey. The revised papers, edited by Joseph Held, compriseThe Columbia History of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century. It is the first major Western-language compendium discussing a broad region of Europe which brings together the talents of prominent specialists and exhibits thorough familiarity with the latest scholarship. Such an undertaking was predestined to yield a volume of significance. The kaleidoscopic developments over the last few years make this work extraordinarily timely and important beyond its obvious scholarly merits."
