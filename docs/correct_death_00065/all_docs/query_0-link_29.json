NOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY 269 INDEX 297 PREFACE HEN, many years ago, the writer of this book first began to interest herself in the problem of the Court Jew, she was still convinced that Jewish history gave evidence of a steady course of progress. Though she was acquainted with the seesaw nature of human history periods of enlighten- ment being followed by periods of political conservatism and religious intolerance and though she was aware of the dark, irrational elements in human nature ever in revolt against spirit and civilization, she was nevertheless certain that reason and humanity would win in the end. Sharing in two differing cultural heritages, the Jewish and the German, she did not feel the tension of such a relationship as a perplexing inner conflict and contrast; this dual heritage served rather to enrich her being and to broaden her LebensgefuehL She was therefore in a position to study, from a positive historical standpoint, the chief problems that interested her, namely, the emancipation of the Jews, that is, the process of their becoming an integral part of the political, economic and social life of the State, and the assimilation of the Jews, that is, the process of their self- adaptation to the culture and spirit of their surroundings. She was particularly intrigued by the history of the Court Jews because of their colorful and adventurous careers. Her imagination was excited by the story of their sudden rise to power and their even more sudden fall. Her human and psychological interest was aroused by the peculiar character of these strong-willed men who, through their intelligence and energy, through their money and importance, through chance and good fortune, were able to rise above their coreligionists. She was even more concerned with the problem of the Xll PREFACE economic and social progress of these men, whose progress was closely connected with the development of the German States away from their medieval patrimonial character and towards fully developed legal and economic structures. Thus many Jewish financiers, whose interests coincided with those of the princes and their states, were among the most prominent advisors to the princes and helped prepare the way for the new State over the opposition of the patriciate and the nobility. The other aspect of this process of assimilation was the reac- tion of Christian society to the entrance of the Jews into its ranks, that is, the attitude of the various classes, corporations and organizations to a group which, until that time, had not been admitted into their circle. But the writer felt that the problem of the Court Jews merited attention not only in its political and social aspects. They were for her a typical and symbolic phenomenon of general Jewish historical development. By understanding their fate one could at the same time understand the fate of the European Jew who attempted to create a synthesis of two different worlds, without surrendering his identity. One could watch his efforts to become integrated into the economic and civil life of the people of which he had become a part. The Court Jews appeared to her to be forerunners of emancipation and their history to represent the early period of this movement. The world in which we live has changed in the meantime and with this change our historical Wdtbild wdt view of how our world has come into being has also changed. The sudden transformation of all our conditions of life has given us a new perspective and enables us to understand more clearly than formerly, not only the inner connection between the changing form of a State and its changing economy and society, but also the close connection between Jewish fate and such historical developments. We have realised how the changing of a democracy into a dictatorship, a free economy into a planned economy, a humanitarian and liberal conception PREFACE Xlll of the world into a medieval caricature, can drastically affect the position of the Jews. This new experience and awareness has made us revise our old historical standpoint so that we no longer look upon emancipation as the end of a long process which led to a kind of symbiosis between two national groups. Even if we remain cognizant of the far-reaching results of this process by which ghetto Jews became European Jews, we tend to look upon the era of emancipation as only one of the many decisive periods in Jewish history. Since we no longer see any principle of gradual progressive development in the course of history, we begin to believe that the very basis of historical life is continuous change . . . that everything is in flux, that everything dies in order that it may be reborn. This dying and rebirth is more marked in some epochs than in others, usually in periods of revolution and radical political, social and economic change. Such periods have not only transformed the life of nations, but also deeply influenced the fate of the Jews. Examples of such periods are the era of the German Reformation, and of the English, American and French Revolutions. The Period of Absolutism was also a time of radical change. It marked the transition from feudalism to absolutism, from Imperium to national State, from medieval economy to a money and credit economy, from traditionalism to early capitalism, from scholastic theories and canonical law to natural law, from a corporative society to one composed of autonomous individuals. We attempt in this study to investigate the effect of changing historical relationships on the Jews, because we believe that this will make it possible for us better to understand the institution of the Court Jew, who was a product of that period of transition and transformation. Only that particular his- torical conjuncture, namely, the period of Court Absolutism and of mercantilism or early capitalism a period in which XIV PREFACE people had lost faith in old institutions and had not yet developed a new way of life and a new conception of things could have given rise to a phenomenon like the Court Jew who combined in himself certain traits characteristic of the Middle Ages with others characteristic of modern times. The Jew of the nineteenth century represented a mature and well-developed type. The processes of emancipation and assimilation had gone as far as they could under the circum- stances, and the Jew had absorbed the spiritual and cultural values of the world around him. The Jew of the baroque period had a more difficult task and a harder destiny. No one led him; no school or university guided him; there was no mighty spiritual movement, such as existed at the time of Moses Mendelssohn, to carry him along. The doors of educa- tion and culture were still closed to him. He was plunged, without any preparation or period of transition, into a com- pletely different culture that was fundamentally stranger to him than the culture of the period of Enlightenment or of the nineteenth century was to his descendants. While he still was not in a position to absorb all the spiritual values of his century and to work out a synthesis between them and the values of the ghetto, he was, on the other hand, able to devote all his energies to economic activity and to make a full contribution in this sphere. In this way the Jew created for himself the material basis on which the struggle for political, social and spiritual emancipation could be waged. It has been said that social and economic revolutions pre- cede intellectual ones, that the material situation of a society must be changed before men are ready for a spiritual revolu- tion. This was the very task the Court Jews accomplished. By transforming the economic situation of the Jews, they shattered the social foundations of the ghetto and made their coreligionists of the following generations receptive to the new ideas of their time- If there had been no Moses Benjamin Wulff, Court Jew in Dessau, there would have been no Moses PREFACE XV Mendelssohn; if there had been no Juspa von Geldern, Court factor in the Palatinate, there would have been no Heinrich Heine; if there had been no Baruch Simon, Court Jew in Cologne, there would have been no Ludwig Boerne. Ephraim and Itzig, the Berlin mint-masters, prepared the way for the Jewish Enlightenment in the eighteenth Century; Oppen- heimer, Wertheimer, Eskeles and d'Aguilar, Court purveyors in Austria, made the famous Viennese salons possible. Each generation sees its nation's past in a different light, for the historical concepts and personal experiences of each genera- tion are different. Our generation was destined to review, revise and reinterpret our past once again, not only because we have uncovered new historical sources which have enriched our knowledge, or because we could use better methods of historical and psychological research than previous generations, but because we have gone through experiences which no Jew in the last two hundred years had known. This experience should not make us in a kind of escap- ism romanticize the past and become sentimental about the \"good old days/* On the contrary, the tragedy and inexorable- ness of our present experiences should lead us to view our past more objectively than before, so that we may understand those forces of our history which once formed and eventually transformed us. We shall then perhaps recognize which of these forces have still remained alive in us and have continued until this very day to exist in us as invigorating and creative elements. An awareness of these forces cannot change our destiny, but an attempt to understand our road through the centuries can make our destiny easier to bear. A wise man once said: \"What one can understand he can endure.\" This work is based principally on studies made during the years 1920-1938 in the archives of almost everyone of the German Staats- and Stadtarchiven, in Ansbach, Berlin, Breslau, Danzig, Darmstadt, Duesseldorf, Frankfort on the Main and XVI PREFACE Frankfort on the Oder, Halberstadt, Heidelberg, Karlsruhe, Koblenz, Koenigsberg, Magdeburg, Muenster, Nuernberg, Stettin, Stuttgart, Tuebingen, Wolfenbuettel and Wuerzburg. With a deep sense of loss I wish to pay tribute here to the memory of Dr. Otto Hirsch, one of the noblest martyrs of German Jewry. He made untiring efforts, even though he was continuously persecuted and often in jail, not only to pre- serve the life of the German Jews, but their cultural and spiritual heritage as well. With an almost prophetic insight into the future, he asked me as far back as in the spring of 1935 to collect, in all the Prussian State Archives, as many Jewish documents as possible in order that the generations to come may remain aware of the thoughts, the deeds and the fate of their ancestors. At his suggestion, Dr. Leo Baeck, then the President of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, carried this idea into effect despite the restric- tions the Nazi government imposed on Jewish research. I owe it to the heroism and idealism of those two great men and to the unselfish assistance and encouragement of Dr. Jakob Jacobson, then the Director of the Gesamtarchiv der deutschen Juden^ that I could fulfill my task in that most critical period. First and foremost this book belongs to my husband, Eugene Taeubler, who, more than any other academic teacher, has profoundly influenced my historical concepts and methods and guided me through the many stages of research and writing ever since the time he founded the Forschungsinstitut of the Akademie fuer die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin, Without his constructive counsel, his wise comments, his countless criticisms, his inspiration and collaboration, this volume would not have been written in its present form. I wish to take the opportunity of expressing my great obliga- tion to Dr. Jacob R. Marcus at whose suggestion this mono- graph was undertaken. Though I had planned for a long time to utilize the material I was happy to have saved from certain PREFACE Xvil destruction, the tragic fate of German Jewry was so stunning as to inhibit me from stirring up the memories of the past. Dr. Marcus' interest in my work, and especially in the history of the German Jews, encouraged me at last to continue my studies. His kindness and aid and the generosity and courtesy of the Jewish Publication Society and of Dr. Maurice Jacobs, until recently the Society's Executive Vice-President, made possible the publication of this book, even as they made pos- sible the appearance of my historical novel, The Spirit Re~ turneth) some years ago. I am grateful to Dr. Ralph Weiman for the exacting pains he took in translating the difficult German text, and for his patient and understanding cooperation. I am also indebted to Dr. Solomon Grayzel who read, reread and revised the English manuscript, carefully and methodically checking many details in the text and the notes, and giving me out of his wide knowledge invaluable and efficient assistance in seeing the book through the press. I record my sincere thanks to Dr. Franz Landsberger for helpful information regarding matters of art and my deep gratitude to the officials and employees of the Library of the Hebrew Union College: especially to Miss Frieda Englander and Mr. Moses Marx, who also read part of the galley proofs, for their courteous assistance in facilitating my use of the Library's books and magazines. I wish to thank Mrs. Berta Lauter, secretary to the American Jewish Archives, for her kind and ever willing help in reading the first translation and the galley proofs, as well as Miss Pauline Kolsky, secretary to Dn Marcus, who also readily assisted in translating and proofreading. THE COURT JEW INTRODUCTION JL H E period which we designate as the epoch of court abso- lutism and early capitalism and which extended from the end of the Renaissance until the period of Enlightenment created a new Weltanschauung, a new type of individual, new economic and political views and new forms of social organization. No longer was there a unified political and religious world, pro- tected by the secular sword of the Emperor and the religious sword of the Pope. In place of a universal monarchy and a universal Church there arose strong individual, autonomous states, each contending with the other, and independent reli- gions and sects, each struggling against the other. For the all- dominating idea of supporting and defending the Church which alone had the power of granting salvation, there was substi- tuted the idea of supporting and defending the European balance of power. The universal conception of an absolute, positive law was superseded by the belief in natural law. The belief in Revelation was replaced by the belief in Reason. The ideal of poverty gave way to the lust for possessions* The moral conception of the State, founded on the teachings of the Church Fathers, was supplanted by the conception of the power of the State, the welfare of the State, the interest of the State, that is, by the Staatsraison. This idea of Staatsraison, which during the succeeding cen- turies separated ethics and politics and endowed the State with an importance it had never possessed until then, became the most revolutionary force of the period. Princes and peoples, philosophers and publicists, officials and economists, all subor- dinated themselves to it. It controlled the economy and domi- nated society. It made the ruler as mighty as God, free of any l 2 THE COURT JEW restrictions and endowed with absolute powers. It subjected the people, a unified, unprivileged mass, to the stern will of the head of the State. It compelled him to demonstrate his own power and greatness, which was identified with the power and greatness of his State, by expanding and enlarging his terri- tory and to demonstrate his might and glory again and again by conquering other states and subjugating their populations. For the sake of this conception of Staatsraison endless wars were fought during that century, wars of reunion and succes- sion, of coalition and devolution. Because of this conception of Staatsraison, kingdom was played off against kingdom, lands and cities were exchanged or sold, colonies were disposed of, inheritances were pawned, treaties made and broken. For the sake of political power the whole nature of the State had to be changed and reshaped. The prince had to put an end to the religious, cultural and economic independence of the various units in his country, units governed by an aris- tocracy or a patrician class, and he had to consolidate them into a unified State. One of the first tasks was to reorganize the entire adminis- trative system. With the help of devoted officials who believed in the Roman legal theory of the unrestricted power of the State and were well acquainted with the contemporary concepts of natural law, he had to take away the sovereign rights pos- sessed by the separate governments of the various estates of the realm and to place all these prerogatives under his own direct control. The break with the Middle Ages was most marked in the economic sphere. An economic system based on the Bible, the Church Fathers and Canon Law gave way to an active and ruthless State capitalism which attempted to control trade and business from above by means of laws, regulations, concessions and protective measures. Mercantilism, which was closely bound up with absolutism, was a bold attempt to solve, not only economic problems, but also problems of domestic and INTRODUCTION 3 foreign policy and of governmental organization and constitu- tion. At no other period had economic theory, which was at the same time political theory in the fullest sense, been so closely connected with practical politics; and, conversely, never had the actual administration of the State been so governed by the principles of economic theory. Mercantilism has been called a system of national agricul- ture, national trade, national industry and national fiscal pol- icy. This description is meant to emphasize the struggle of the State for power and external and internal independence: external independence in that it formed a separate economic and political unit; internal independence in that it substituted strong, unified economic bodies for loosely connected corpora- tions, organizations and estates. In order to achieve this independence for the State mercan- tilism needed to increase the wealth of the nation. For this reason trade and industry were encouraged, the number of inhabitants was increased, the financial system was improved, taxes were made higher, the monetary system was reorganized and domestic industry was protected from foreign competition, that is to say, the export of raw materials and the import of finished products were prohibited and all forces that were in a position to produce wealth were aided the merchant, the tradesman, the manufacturer, the banker. This new attitude towards money, this desire for gold as a means of making the State strong and prosperous, was the chief characteristic of absolutism. The amassing of wealth became the guiding principle in political economy. The theor- ists of mercantilism taught that the duty of princes was to secure wealth, gain money and to keep it in the nation. The Ministry of Finance, they explained, was the heart of the State; the circulation of money was the bloodstream of the political body. The problem of population played an equally important role. The proponents of absolutism wanted the State to en- 4 THE COURT JEW courage immigration and called attention to the close relation- ship between population and production and between the number of a State's inhabitants and its might. This complete change in the political and economic structure of the State led, not only to a new conception of the Jew, but also to a complete transformation of his political and economic position. As soon as trade was no longer condemned, as it had been in the Middle Ages, taking interest no longer prohibited and the merchant no longer compared to a thief and a pirate, it was natural that the Jewish money-changer and tradesman should be looked upon in a different light. If one considered the persecution of religious groups and sects as a measure harmful to trade and believed, as many of the mercantilists did, that the decline of Spain was due to the expulsion of the Jews and that Holland owed her superiority in trade to the immigration of Jews, then it became self-evi- dent that in order to create a flourishing trade and a sound economic structure one should encourage the settlement of Jews and practice tolerance towards them. The medieval feudal State, which was subordinated to the Church and dependent on its canons, had excluded a group which was, in its opinion, composed of infidels. Their position in medieval law was that of foreigners. Medieval society ex- cluded them from almost all professions. As property of the ruler they were in need of his personal protection, for which they had to pay heavy taxes. They provided, as did the other regalia, an indispensable source of revenue ever at the ruler's command which he could at his discretion also sell to other feudal powers or give as security to his creditors* In the period of absolutism the great importance of the Jewish problem was recognized. It was transferred from the religious to the political sphere and in this way secularized* It became, for the first time in the history of the diaspora, a political problem. For by favoring public as against private interests^suppress- INTRODUCTION 5 ing the nobility and organizing a new officialdom, creating a standing army in place of a mercenary force and centralizing the administrative government, the absolutist ruler dissolved the old ties of society and replaced them with new ones which were more desirable from the viewpoint of state administration. The Jew, too, found the factors of absolutism and mercantil- ism acting as powerful reagents upon the ties and bonds of his life. For the first time the State, in bringing all its sub- jects into direct relationship with itself, made a place for the Jews in the complicated order of its social structure* By taking away from the feudal lords the Judenregal, placing the Jews under the state officials and specifying the rights and duties of the Jewish taxpayers, the absolutist ruler changed his medieval relationship to the Jews. They ceased to be ap- purtenances of the ruler, serfs of the chamber (Kammer- knechte)) just as they ceased to be dependent on the favor and caprices of the feudal powers. The mercantilist economic policy had a similar influence. By considering the Jews as important factors in its commercial policies, by drawing them into the financing of trade compa- nies and colonies, by entrusting them with factories, banks, agencies and monopolies and by using them to stimulate im- port and export, the State made the Jews important pillars of the expanding economy. These tendencies which led to the emancipation of the Jews in Holland, their return to England and to a more favorable position in France were realized to the fullest extent in Ger- many. Here we can see the most striking change in the policy toward the Jew. The western countries, under the leadership of monarchs and statesmen like Richelieu and Colbert in France, William of Orange in Holland and Cromwell in England, became power- ful unified states and their economic life was stimulated and intensified by the discovery and founding of overseas colonies. Germany, on the other hand, was left weakened by the Thirty 6 THE COURT JEW Years' War. The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which had once theoretically and actually been the center of Europe, was now only a concept or, as it has been described, a chimera, a skeleton whose parts were joined together, not by nerves, but by wire threads and were not capable of movement. The Emperor, who had once been the powerful and undisputed ruler of the Empire, was now only titular head of this strange structure that could be called neither a republic nor a mon- archy. Through the treaty of Westphalia the two hundred and forty territories of various sizes that comprised the Empire had received full liberty and full sovereignty and were given the power of concluding treaties with other rulers, of waging war and of conducting negotiations. The Thirty Years' War had devastated their territories, de- populated the cities, impoverished the inhabitants, destroyed the monetary system and interrupted trade relations with for- eign countries. The Empire's enemies were in possession of all her outlets to the sea: Sweden had gained the Baltic region and Lower Pomerania and dominated not only the Baltic but also the mouths of the Oder and Weser; Holland controlled the mouth of the Rhine; Poland held the Vistula, France the Upper Rhine and Denmark Holstein and Oldenburg. Despite all this the German princes sought to reorganize their States in the spirit of absolutism and mercantilism, to unify the separate regions that they had inherited, annexed, gained in war or through exchange, to create a standing army and a modern governmental apparatus and to transform their Courts into little Versailles in imitation of the Court of Louis XIV. With this goal in mind they paid special attention to the Jewish problem and, with a German sense of system and or- ganization, they attempted to find as thorough and fundamen- tal a solution as the period permitted. Jewish competitors had been expelled from the German commercial centers and from most of the larger territories in INTRODUCTION 7 the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They had settled in the villages and towns of the knights, bishops and barons, where they eked out an existence as pawnbrokers, money-changers and peddlers. Only in some of the larger cities, like Frankfort, Worms, Fuerth, Vienna and a few others, were they granted the right of domicile. German Jews had no part in the commercial and financial undertakings which contributed to the development of the cities in Upper Germany. These enterprises were almost without exception in the hands of Christian merchants. The situation was radically altered in the seventeenth cen- tury. Jews were accepted in larger numbers and under more favorable conditions in most of the German states and cities, and were granted the right to found their own communities and to practice their religion without hindrance. Ideas of tolerance played a very small role. The motives which compelled the princes to accept Jews were of a finan- cial nature: to increase the population of their lands and to gain an additional number of productive taxpayers. They hoped at the same time to be able with the help of the Jews to combat the guilds and to establish the modern monetary and credit systems. Still, whatever the motives may have been, this attitude on the part of the princes helped make the position of the Jews more secure. The German prince of that period, however, needed more than someone to educate his subjects in the economic field and to serve as a means of carrying out his commercial and fiscal policies. This was a period in which there was not as yet a science of political economy, in which there was no public credit, in which Court and State economy had not yet been separated, in which the tax system and budget were disor- ganized and the State revenue was pledged as security. The princes needed, therefore, capable and experienced financiers and organizers who could procure the sums of money necessary to carry out experiments in the field of politics and econom- 8 THE COURT JEW ics, to wage wars and to maintain the army and the Court budget. In the sixteenth century the South German merchants, in particular the Fuggers, had lent the Emperor large sums of money. They had constituted an independent power and for a period of time had influenced the destiny, not only of Ger- many, but of Europe as well. With their financial help Charles V was able to have himself elected German Emperor and de- feat Francis I of France. They supplied money to the Euro- pean princes and to the Popes and cardinals. They owned mines and factories and their commercial activity extended to all parts of the world. This bold, enterprising type of merchant no longer existed in the seventeenth century. As a result of the religious distur- bances and conflicts and especially in consequence of the change in the trade routes from the Mediterranean, Italy and Southern Germany to the Atlantic Ocean and the West, German commerce was rapidly declining and no longer in a position to compete with the western States. The proud, high- spirited patrician of the Free Imperial Cities, who had helped determine the outcome of wars and the fate of the Reforma- tion, had become a spiritless and penniless bourgeois who feared to take any risks, who spent his energy in petty intrigues over who should receive various town posts, and who bitterly op- posed the economic and political innovations of the mercan- tilist State. But a large section of the other citizens also regarded the penetration of the authoritarian State into their spheres of interest with mistrust and animosity. While the mercantil- ist writers and the liberal officials praised the experiments of absolutism, the representatives of traditionalism and anti- capitalism refused to take part in State enterprises* They believed in the theological and scholastic theories of the Middle Ages or in the Lutheran ethical doctrine of economics. They saw in the natural organization of \"estates^the system in which INTRODUCTION 9 every class found the work assigned to it by God and protected by the ruling body. They still thought that money was un- productive, that taking interest should be forbidden, that credit should not be extended, and they therefore fought against monopoly, free initiative and the free professions. The prince who wanted to rescue his State from its pre- carious financial position had consequently to seek an entre- preneur who was free of corporative and religious connections and who could, as a result, regard economic and political problems with as sober and unprejudiced an attitude as he himself did. The entrepreneur also had to be a man who knew the international money market, who was acquainted with the most important European financiers and who therefore was in a position to obtain the necessary sums of money. The Emperor had rewarded the Fuggers for their loans by granting them titles of nobility, giving them the right to coin money and to exploit mines, so that they gained a monopoly over the silver mines in Hungary and the mercury mines in Spain. The Jew who lent money to the princes could be satisfied by less expensive rewards. It was sufficient to im- prove his oppressed political position by giving him economic concessions and by granting him special privileges and exemp- tions. In this way the banker and financial agent became the army contractor, the Court purveyor and the commercial entrepreneur. Nor was this all. His financial activity, which was at that time closely bound up with diplomatic affairs, brought him into contact with higher politics. He was used in secret missions, political councils, armistice negotiations and military operations. Through his personal mediation, lands and positions were bought and sold. Through his finan- cial transactions, electorates and crowns were acquired, and through his agents the latest news and most reliable informa- tion could be obtained. In this way the Court Jew took over the functions of a secret agent and spy, of a reporter, consul and diplomatic courier. 10 THE COURT JEW The loans he made to the State treasury brought him into close contact with the inner government of the countries. The financial adviser soon came to draw up budgets, administer the treasury, collect taxes, coin money, plan all sorts of proj- ects and promote domestic production. If we today wonder how it was possible for one man to supply the Court with luxury wares which he bought in France, Italy, Holland or at the fairs in Germany; to provide the army with munitions which he obtained in Poland, Bohemia, Mo- ravia, or the Ukraine; to procure money from the various banks and bourses of Europe; to keep up an extensive corre- spondence with his business friends and agents; to calculate the expenses of the princely treasury; to draw up projects for increasing the State revenues; to establish factories and to import and export all kinds of goods, we must remember that the wholesale and retail trade, moneylending and manufac- turing, importing and exporting had not yet become differen- tiated and specialized. The great Renaissance merchants in Italy and Upper Germany had in the same way united banks, factories, mines and trading companies in single firms, and at the same time served as financial and political advisers to the princes. That the Court Jew was an indispensable innovation, just as the officialdom and the standing army had been, and served to complete the unified state and the mercantilist system, is shown by the fact that we find him in practically every Court and in practically every country. In a century in which JesuitvS fought against Jansenists, Puritans against Anglicans, Luth- erans against Calvinists, in which France drove out the Huguenots and Austria the Protestants, and in which a destruc- tive war was waged for thirty years for religious reasons, the religion of the Court Jews played a subordinate role* Austria had expelled all its Jews, but it became the land of Qppen- heimer, Wertheimer, Sinzheimer, Hirschel and d'Aguilan Saxony, which from an early period had fought for one of the INTRODUCTION 11 most intolerant forms of Protestantism in Germany and which allowed Jews to remain there only during the period of the Leipzig Fair, was forced to receive Lehmann, Levi and Mayer. It was in Lutheran Wuerttemberg, from which Jews had been banned centuries earlier, that Jud Suess played his famous role. It was in East Prussia, once the land of the Teutonic Order, that Israel Aron, the Court purveyor of the Great Elec- tor of Brandenburg, began his activity. Mecklenburg, Bruns- wick and Hanover, which had formerly been closed to the Jews, witnessed the rise of Hinrichsen, Hagen and Behrens. Jews are found at Courts like Munich and Vienna which were ruled by Jesuits; they served enlightened and tolerant princes like the Great Elector and Karl Ludwig of the Palatinate, rigidly orthodox Calvinists like Frederick William of Prussia, mild Lutherans like the Counts of Hesse, fanatical Catholics like the Wittelsbacher in Bavaria, warlike prelates like the Bishop of Muenster, indifferent and frivolous princes like Ernest Augustus of Hanover and Frederick Augustus of Saxony, and zealous converts like John Frederick of Brunswick- Luneburg and Queen Christina of Sweden. Though the Court Jew was a product of his time, a product of the particular combination of Court absolutism, mercan- tilism and baroque culture, he was nevertheless not merely an automaton created by the ruler and blindly carrying out his will. He was an individual with clearly marked features and definite characteristics, the first fully recognizable personality to emerge in modern Jewish history. He differed from the Court Jew of the earlier period not only in that his activities were of a more varied nature and embraced finance, diplomacy, commerce and politics, but also in that he possessed a remark- able degree of industriousness and restlessness, a great interest in speculation and action, a strong desire for success, a lust for money and profit, an ambition to climb higher and higher and to assimilate as completely as possible to his environment in speech, dress and manners. He differed from the Court Jews 12 THE COURT JEW of the Age of Rationalism and of the nineteenth century who were no more than bankers and financial advisers to their princes and fulfilled their tasks in a very level-headed and business-like manner in that he feared no danger and took plenty of risks, sharing the bizarre love of adventure of his time, traits which remind us of the condottieri of the Renais- sance period or of the early American pioneers. Capitalism has been described as the dominance of capital over man and the economic function over the human heart. The Court Jew was never a homo capitalisticus in this sense. He constantly identified himself with his work and he placed his capacity for sacrifice and devotion at the service of his prince. This very personal relationship between the prince and the Court Jew, which rested on the complete trust of the prince and the complete loyalty and fidelity of the Court Jew, was strengthened not only by the interests they had in common. There was something else which made their very fates simi- lar. Despite the great differences in social position, culture, racial background and tradition which separated them, they both lived in the same isolation: the prince because of his omni- potence and inaccessibility and the Court Jew because of his birth and religion, which caused him to be isolated from all classes of society and to be avoided by them all. One finds in the Court Jew traits which characterize the modern entrepreneur and distinguish him from the merchant of the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, he remained a Ghetto Jew, whose experience and fate bound him to his community and kept him confined within its religious and social organization* He could therefore utilize his privileged position at Court to serve as the good advocate and protector of his people, to or- ganize and lead their communal life and to prepare new dom- iciles for them. He could use the political experience which he had gained in the service of the state to fight for universal rights for all Jews in place of the special rights granted to a few privileged Jews. INTRODUCTION 13 These noble traits of the Court Jew could at times be replaced by pride and arrogance, by a desire to dominate, by a spirit of vindictiveness; but even this combination of good and evil traits, this lack of stability and balance, are characteristic of the Jew of that period who combined in himself the Jew of the Ghetto with the Jew of the emancipation, the religious belief of the Middle Ages with the nascent rationalism of modern times. The tragic fate, l a however, 'which befell many of the Court Jews and plunged them into poverty and despair was caused not by any fault of their own but by the chaos of the period in which they lived. They fell because they were bearers of a new and revolutionary political and economic conception which was bitterly attacked by the old legitimatist powers. CHAPTER I THE COURT JEW AS COMMISSARY T HE epoch of Court absolutism that extends from about 1640 to 1740 has also been called the epoch of Louis XIV, 1 since the theory of the divine right of kings and the identifica- tion of the ruler with the State found its clearest expression and fullest development in this French monarch. Most of the European states were modeled after the French form of gov- ernment: French culture and the French language became the culture and language of all the European Courts; and the eti- quette and ceremony of the Court at Versailles became the pattern for practically every prince* The period of Louis XIV is, however, also the period during which France sought to win a position of hegemony over almost all the other states and turned Europe into a battlefield during the course of decades. These long fa-ars were for the first time fought with standing armies whose training, maintenance, provisioning and equipping with newly invented weapons, involved the expenditure of huge sums of money. France's interest in these struggles lay in her desire to break the power of the Hapsburgs, who since the time of Charles V had ruled in the Old and New Worlds. The European princes fought at times on one side, at times on the other, depending on the amount of money they were promised for their aid and on the size of the booty. The head of the House of Hapsburg was Leopold I. He was ruler of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and a part of Hun- gary, and from 1658 on had been Emperor of Germany. The early death of the Crown Prince had suddenly and unexpec- 15 16 THE COURT JEW tedly, and at a most crucial point in Austria history, placed the government in the hands of this eighteen-year-old prince who had been destined for the clergy. The young monarch felt himself entirely unprepared for the difficult task of com- bating powerful internal and external enemies. His internal enemies consisted of the German princes who, aided by France, the guarantor of German liberty, sought more and more to limit the power of the Emperor in the Reich, and of the Hun- garian Magyars who year after year rose in rebellion against Hapsburg domination. His external enemies were the Turks in the south who renewed their attacks, and Louis XIV in the west who threatened the Austrian and South German posses- sions on the Rhine. The great question of Leopold Fs reign was whether he could protect the vital interests of his own State as well as those of the German Empire against both their powerful ad- versaries whether he would be able to defeat the one with- out having the other attack him, or resist one without having the other destroy him. The victory of the Turks would have meant the loss of the southeast corner of Austria, the important Donauraum; the victory of the French would have resulted in the loss of the mouths of the Meuse and the Rhine and would have led to the complete hegemony of Louis XIV in Europe. Despite the gravity of the situation the weak and irresolute Emperor, who had a propensity for evading issues, hesitated a long time before making up his mind to go to war. For whereas Louis had at his disposal excellent diplomats and generals, the resources of a sound financial system and a flour- ishing economy, Austria was almost in a state of disintegra- tion. The Hapsburg monarchy was a federation in which the various countries and provinces, each with its own government and constitution, were loosely bound together only through their common ruler. In the ministry, official opposed official, intrigue followed THE COMMISSARY 17 intrigue. The State finances were in hopeless confusion, crown domains had been leased and the crown jewels pawned. The officials were unreliable and positions could be obtained only by bribery. When, therefore, Louis XIV attacked the Low Countries in 1666 and, at the same time, the Turks moved against Hun- gary, the Emperor remained neutral as far as France was concerned and tried to drive the Turks only from his own territory. A decisive change in Leopold's attitude occurred only in the year 1673. Louis XIV entered into an alliance with several German princes and renewed his attack on Holland. He quickly overran a number of provinces and seized control of the right bank of the Rhine. If the Emperor did not want still further to weaken his position in the German Empire he had to take some effective action. He allied himself with Spain, Holland and Denmark, thus forming the first great coalition of European nations designed to stem the expansionist tenden- cies of France and to maintain the European balance of power. It was at this period that the Emperor decided to entrust the task of provisioning the army and supplying it with muni- tions to Samuel Oppenheimer of Heidelberg, \"Jew of Haydel- berg,\" as he signed himself. We must suppose that Leopold did not reach this decision easily and that the counsels of his generals and the \"Court Chamber\" (Hof hammer), as the Finance Ministry was then called, must havej finally prevailed. For Leopold was almost fanatical in his adherence to the Catholic Church and was constantly surrounded by Spanish Jesuits and bigoted priests. Only three years earlier he had driven the Jews from Vienna and Lower Austria and from then on had not allowed a single Jew to reside in the capital of the Empire. If Leopold now entrusted the important task of War Com- missary to a Jew, he did so because there was no Christian 18 THE COURT JEW merchant who was prepared to assume this difficult position. The Thirty Years* War had ruined many of the large commer- cial houses, severed their business relations with the other countries, destroyed their capital and discouraged the mer- chants from embarking on risky enterprises. The roads in the Empire had become unsafe, wagons were often plundered by soldiers and wares frequently spoiled during the long journey from one country to another and from one front to another. These facts as well as the countless customs barriers and the disorganized state of currency and weights all made business ventures unattractive. There were in addition various psychological factors which dissuaded many merchants from engaging in the business of furnishing army supplies. The war commissary was every- where an object of great mistrust. He was the scapegoat who was held responsible for the mistakes of the generals, the failure of the State machinery and the depletion of the State treasury. If the soldiers were given poor food, insufficient pay or inferior equipment, the war contractor was blamed. If the harvest was poor and the peasant did not have enough to eat, the large grain purchases of the State purveyors were re- sponsible. If a general was defeated in battle, the fault lay with the war commissary who had not supplied food and munitions in time. It was, therefore, much easier to obtain a Jewish contractor than a Christian one. The Jew could be attracted by the promise of titles and privileges and, since he possessed no rights, the State could bring various kinds of pressure to bear upon him. Moreover, the Jew seemed to be better qualified for the position of war commissary than the Christian. He was in close contact with his coreligionists throughout Europe. He was therefore able to maintain agents and correspondents in all countries and could receive through them necessary goods and important news. For example, the Jews in Poland, Russia and Lithuania could buy in their countries the mass THE COMMISSARY 19 products which were indispensable for the army and deliver them to the purveyor at the Breslau and Leipzig fairs. The many Jews who lived in the villages of the Empire were like- wise in a position to obtain various foodstuffs and to send them to him. In the wars during the period of Reformation the services rendered by a Prague Jew to Maurice of Saxony had become well known. The famous intercessor for the Jews, Josel of Rosheim, received a royal letter of protection in the year 1548 because he had procured for the king money and provisions in France, During the Thirty Years' War the Jewish contractors had made themselves indispensable to the Swedish and Impe- rial armies. \"All Jews are commissaries and all commissaries are Jews\": so we read in Moscherosch's Gesichten des Phil- anders von Sittenwald, which describes the Thirty Years' War. When the army leaders first became aware of Samuel Oppen- heimer, he was a finance agent and army contractor in the service of Elector Karl Ludwig of the Palatinate. He was then forty-four years old and came from an old and respected Frank- fort family. He was known for his honesty and good credit; the fact that he had close connections with Christian firms was a point in his favor. When the director of the imperial supply commissariat commissioned him at the very beginning of the war against France (1673-1679) to provide the imperial troops with food and ammunition from permanent depots, he joined with several Christian firms into a consortium, a so- called trading company. He seems to have carried out his commission to the satisfaction of the generals and officials. The High Commissioner of the Imperial Army reported to Vienna that his prices were reasonable and that his terms were fair. On another occasion he praised him as being a Jew of means and good credit. He called attention to the valuable services which Oppenheimer had rendered in these campaigns when several years later he supported Oppenheimer's claims on the treasury. 20 THE COURT JEW Oppenheimer's first connection with the House of Hapsburg ended, however, in bitter disappointment for him. He was, it is true, named Kriegsfactor, but no one in Vienna thought of paying his or his partner's claims which amounted to 200,000 florins, or of compensating him for the money he had advanced. The paymaster of the War Ministry declared bluntly that he did not have a kreuzer in jhis pocket. The credit of the Court treasury, which had never been too strong, had been completely exhausted by the demands of the long war. An attempt was made to put Oppenheimer off with worthless promissory notes on State revenues, while he himself had to pay his subcontractors in cash. His creditors began to press him, some even threatening to confiscate his personal property. In this difficult situation Oppenheimer, in 1681, wrote the Emperor a personal letter. This letter, the first of many similar ones, reveals the man's personality. It is written in an urgent and dramatic style, pleading and demanding at the same time, but without any servility and not without a certain pride in the important services he had rendered. He asks the Emperor not to leave him in the lurch, to see that the money owed him is paid, because otherwise he will be ruined and will surely be forced to go into bankruptcy. For three years he has unsuccessfully tried to collect money due to him and his partner, who had in the meantime died of grief. One of his business associates in Frankfort had already failed. His entire credit, the foundation of his enterprises, was at stake. Far wealthier bankers and merchants would ridicule him and his business associate who, at a time when no one was willing to lend the Emperor a kreuzer, offered him every- thing they possessed in order to save the army from certain defeat. Even though the Department of Finance responded to his request by giving him only a small sum of money and a few promissory notes on State taxes, Oppenheimer offered, only a year later, to take over the whole supply commissariat of the THE COMMISSARY 21 Empire and to manage it at his own expense. He was in a position, he explained with proud optimism, to deliver 100,000 hundredweights of flour and any desired quantity of oats anywhere they were needed. No other contractor was able to make these deliveries on as favorable terms as he could. He would supervise everything himself and would not give full authority to a representative as he had formerly done. He was now aided by the turn of events. Just as the French- Dutch war had given him his start, so the new war with the Turks now enabled him to reach the pinnacle of success. In the same year (1683) in which Kara Mustapha overran the Austrian territories and appeared before the gates of Vienna, frightening the entire West, the Viennese government changed its attitude to its former contractor. Whereas at the beginning of the year he had been held in strict arrest as the result of a denunciation, he was now given the task of supplying a mighty army which was being recruited from all parts of the Empire. Once again the Christian contractors had refused to help. A Bavarian Count had to be turned down because he asked ex- orbitant prices. Oppenheimer, however, the Department of Finance reported to the Emperor, had offered the best terms. Despite his open satisfaction at this commission and despite the praiseworthy and almost humble attitude of the Court treasury, Oppenheimer requested with a calm firmness that he first be paid the money due him before he signed the new contract. Now that the thunder of the Turkish cannons could be heard in the city, his demands were met by transferring to him the subsidies from the Empire as well as the proceeds from various sources of State revenue. The Emperor, who had fled to Passau before the advancing Turks, approved the con- tract, though he felt it was dangerous to give so important and responsible a position to a Jew. There now followed a period of intense activity. Oppenhei- mer was able to deliver, immediately after the signing of the contract, 80,000 hundredweights of flour to the garrison at 22 THE COURT JEW Linz, but had to work day and night to obtain as great a quan- tity of oats as possible so that the cavalry might not be en- dangered by a lack of fodder. When, after the liberation of Vienna, the Austrian and imperial troops began to pursue the fleeing enemy, Oppenheimer arranged to have handgrenades, gunpowder, pistols and carbines sent on ships and rafts down the Danube and by means of wagons and horses on the roads. At the same time he secured rafts to move troops from the Empire, transported an army from Hungary to Cracow, trans- ferred cavalry regiments from Brunswick to Bohemia, and supplied all the fortresses in Hungary, Albania, Transylvania and Serbia. His chief problems were besieged Ofen, whose army had to be supplied with provisions, munition, clothing, tobacco, linen and brandy, and newly conquered Belgrade to which he sent a hundred large ships, hospital and camp equip- ment and materials for shipbuilding. When, in 1688, Louis XIV began the War of the Palatinate, Oppenheimer again undertook to supply the troops on the Rhine, Main and Danube. At the same time that he was sug- gesting the construction of a Danubian fleet, he was fortifying the fortress of Philippsburg which was frequently attacked and which was still constantly being threatened by the French. Nothing escaped his observation. He followed political ma- neuvers, the formation and dissolution of coalitions, kept himself informed about methods of provisioning armies and about the geographical position of garrisons, watched with close interest the military movements of generals and calmly calculated the economic difficulties of the government* He drove his numerous agents, business friends and correspon- dents throughout Europe, his son and his employees to ever greater efforts. Whether he was ordering gunpowder and cloth from Holland, wool and saltpeter from Bohemia, arms and munitions from Carinthia, spices from Hamburg or grain from Bamberg, he appeared as one driven to restless activity, but also as one who refused to acknowledge defeat and for THE COMMISSARY 23 whom no obstacles were insurmountable. His ships were often wrecked, his goods were confiscated or damaged, his transports were delayed, shipments of money were lost, his funds were depleted, his creditors pressed and even threatened him; yet he never lost courage. He was attacked and reviled, \"mali- cious, unscrupulous, impassioned people,\" as he describes them, tried to harm him. His home was plundered, his business papers destroyed, his employees, his son and he himself spent months in prison, his goods were disapproved, his accounts were checked and payments were withheld from him; yet his will was never broken. If anything, these difficulties only served to strengthen his determination. At the Court he was the center of heated debates. The Emperor, whose conscience was troubled, tolerated him against his will. He openly admitted that Oppenheimer had always served him faithfully, that he was a reliable army contractor, that he was always ready to cooperate and that the army would have been lost without him. Still he would have pre- ferred to see a Christian rather than a Jew entrusted with the task of serving his troops. The general who praised Oppenheimer's work most warmly was Margrave Louis of Baden, the most honest and, next to Prince Eugene, the most talented military man of his time, In 1693 he assumed general command of all the troops on the Rhine. Oppenheimer's support was indispensable to him, for unless supplies reached him in time his small army could never withstand an enemy so superior to his in numbers and equip- ment as was the French. The Margrave had had unfortunate experiences with small tradesmen who wanted to be paid as soon as they had delivered their goods; he kept emphasizing at the Court of Vienna that only important and well-established merchants like Oppenheimer, who had sufficient capital or unlimited credit, could be used as contractors. He requested repeatedly that Oppenheimer be commissioned to set up a warehouse from which the army could purchase supplies for 24 THE COURT JEW cash, since he furnished better goods on more favorable terms than the merchants in the towns. Whereas the latter in most cases declined to supply goods, Oppenheimer accepted every commission even when it meant, as it often did, a loss to him- self. Without his help everything would have been lost. He deserved therefore to be awarded the contracts. The officials of the Department of Finance, who had in 1670 opposed the expulsion of the Jews from Vienna since they feared that the resulting loss in revenue and the disruption of Jewish activity would cause irreparable harm to the State a$d the economy, also tried to protect Oppenheimer against every attempt to slander him. They urged the Emperor to pay him more promptly and warned him against listening to the innu- endoes of those in his Court who were prejudiced against Jews. Those who wanted to destroy Oppenheimer and this meant destroying his Christian subordinates as well were break- ing faith with the Emperor. It was perhaps regrettable that Oppenheimer should have secured the commission of supply- ing all the needs of the army. Still, as long as Christians did not possess the ability or the desire to do the like, one had to accept the services of whomever was able and willing to help. While the generals and the high officials were trying to make things easier for Oppenheimer, his position became highly crit- ical when, in 1692, Cardinal Kollonitsch, the persecutor of Protestants and Jews, became president of the Department of Finance. Convinced that the Jews were a harmful weed which had to be uprooted, he made immediate preparations to break Oppenheimer's monopolistic position and to replace him with other suppliers. At the very time when Oppenheimer was experiencing the greatest difficulty in procuring foodstuffs owing to the fact that the princes in various parts of the Empire had forbidden the peasants to sell their rapidly dwindling grain supplies, Kollonitsch commissioned several purveyors, principally a certain Vogel, to provision the Margrave of Baden's army on the Rhine. This measure was dictated not THE COMMISSARY 25 only by the Cardinal's enmity towards the Jews; certain mili- tary and political points of dispute between him and the Mar- grave also played their role. It was an attempt to injure not only the Jew but also his friend and protector to whom the Emperor had granted full power to make agreements with Oppenheimer. Margrave Louis of Baden, of whom the English ambassador once said that he always spoke like a dictator, was not a man to let such a challenge go unanswered. He immediately placed his own credit at Oppenheimer's disposal and threat- ened in his bold and forthright manner to give up his command and enter the service of the English if his Jewish contractor were replaced. Oppenheimer had always carried out his com- mitments efficiently and punctually, whereas Vogel only caused confusion and disunity and was not capable of bringing an undertaking to completion. In 1697 Kollonitsch made another attempt to remove the Jews from this sphere by proposing all sorts of reforms in the obtaining of supplies. He turned over the provisioning of the army to the Bishop of Wuerzburg, whose activity, the Emperor was told, could save him 100,000 florins. In this way, the Cardinal wrote, purchases would no longer be made through Jews and untrustworthy officials, but through Christians and reliable contractors. Oppenheimer, who in these very weeks had to pay some 70,000 florins in cash, at the Leipzig Fair, was informed of the suspension of his contract. This time he did not wait for others to go to his defense. His credit, the cornerstone of his widespread enterprises, his honor and his good name were all at stake. He reminded the Court treasury of its pledged word. He protested bitterly against the scoundrels who were trying to ruin him. He hurried to his friends in the government and implored them to save him from disaster. But neither the imperial officials nor Margrave Louis had to intercede for him. Only five days later his old privileges 26 THE COURT JEW were restored. The Bishop of Wuerzburg had been unable to carry out the agreement since he could not deliver the supplies until he received cash. The Department of Finance, however, was not in a position to advance him the money. The years between 1697 and 1703, the year of Samuel Oppenheimer's death, were for him, as has been said, a period of teetering on the brink of the abyss. The peace treaty of Ryswick, which in 1697 ended the War of the Palatinate, and the peace treaty of Karlowitz, which in 1699 ended the war with the Turks, were merely a prelude to a new and longer war, wider in scope and more decisive in its effects, namely the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the Emperor fought for thirteen years with Louis XIV over the Spanish and Italian inheritance, that is to say, whether the Habsburgs or the Bour- bons would rule Europe in the future. The army general who won the greatest distinction on the Austrian side was the most brilliant hero of the eighteenth cen- tury, the celebrated Prince Eugene of Savoy. In the years 1701-1703 he had to defend Austria against the French in North Italy, but was almost defeated because his troops lacked the most essential supplies lead and powder, horses and wagons, food and pay. The long wars had plunged the Austrian State into such great debt that it was often impossible to send couriers because there was not enough money for their travel- ing expenses. The officers spent the small pay they received to buy shoes and stockings for the soldiers; but these officers were themselves so poor that, as Prince Eugene wrote to Vienna in 1702, many beggars did not lead so wretched an existence. At another time he prophesied that the Emperor would lose his crown; if things continued this way, the scepter would fall from Leopold's hand and the monarchy would be destroyed. Once again, as in the War of the Palatinate and the war against the Turks, it was Oppenheimer to whom one turned in the hour of crisis, after England, Austria's ally, had refused to continue paying the promised subsidies. Oppenheimer was no THE COMMISSARY 27 longer the man he had been. The Department of Finance owed him millions. The promissory notes which he had been given on taxes and uncertain revenues and which he had to collect himself he had, he complained, to collect it in driblets were far from covering the payments he had to make. He often did not have the money to pay his suppliers or to pay for the transport of his goods, or even to meet his household expenses. He asked the Emperor again and again not to consider him whefi further supplies were needed, since he was plagued with debts and had to keep out of the way of his creditors. An ugly intrigue he was accused of having tried to overthrow Car- dinal Kollonitsch in order that he himself might become pres- ident of the Department of Finance had, it is true, ended in his acquittal. However, the imprisonment of the most famous merchant of the time, the confiscation of his corre- spondence and personal possessions had not only caused great uneasiness in business circles throughout Europe, but had weakened his credit which for many years had been strained to the limit and further affected his health which had already suffered from his feverish activity. Despite all this he now put forth every effort to supply the armies in Italy, the Tyrol, on the Rhine and on the Danube. \"Everything came under his control,\" field reports of the time relate, \"the organization of supply wagons, the delivery of grain, gunpowder and projectiles, the supplying of draft horses, etc.\" Oppenheimer's success was in the final analysis doubtlessly due to his own personality, his great business ability, his rare talent for organization and his inexhaustible energy. He had indeed, as one reads in one of his petitions, often done the superhuman for his Emperor. 2 But these qualities would after all not have amounted to much if he had not known how to organize around him a network of reliable agents, officials and suppliers. They were located in all the most important trade centers in Europe and supplied him with news and goods, 28 THE COURT JEW while in return he secured for them charters and passes, con- tracts and monopolies, and obtained for them permission to settle in cities from which Jews had been excluded for centuries. To a certain extent the members of his own large family served him as aids and representatives. His oldest son, Emanuel, who had from his earliest youth aided his father in all his business affairs, served as his general representative in the Empire. In Frankfort on the Main, which served as the intermediary trading center between England, Holland, the Baltic countries, Switzerland, Austria and Hun- gary and as a center for military supplies, he used as his agents his two sons-in-law, Emanuel Drach and Loeb Deutz, his grand- son Moses Samuel Oppenheimer and his cousin Hertz. In Heidelberg, he employed his brother Moses, the Court Agent of the Elector of the Palatinate; in Hanover, his relative Leffmann Behrens and his own son Wolf; in Italy, his grandson Loew Oppenheimer, in Amsterdam and Cleves, members of the Gumperts family, which was related to his. He was also helped by well-known Court Jews: like the Resident Aron Beer in Frankfort; Loew Sinzheim, the Court Purveyor of the Elector of Mayence; Moyses Isaac, the Court Jew of Bamberg; Lazarus Hirschel, the Imperial Mint-Pur- veyor; the Model family, the Ansbach Court agents; Samuel Ullmann, the Court Purveyor in Bavaria, whom he called his most important correspondent and for whom he managed to obtain the right of domicile in the Free City of Augsburg which had until then been closed to Jews. Samuel Oppenheimer's death in 1703, after a short illness, led to a serious catastrophe for the Austrian State. That year was certainly the most critical in the reign of Leopold, filled though that entire period was with crises and dangers. For the credit of the State, which was closely bound up with Oppenheimer's credit, was gravely affected, especially since the Emperor was blind enough to choose just this moment to throw Oppenheimer's estate into bankruptcy. THE COMMISSARY 29 In the judgment of the clear-sighted Gundacker of Starhemberg this was so terrible a blow that the Emperor's enemy, France, could not have devised anything as harmful. The death of Oppenheimer, complained Prince Eugene, meant new confu- sion. All the merchants were so involved in this affair that none of them wanted to sign any contracts. He himself would rather eat black bread in a Hungarian village than continue this sort of life. The bankruptcy of Oppenheimer, grumbled Margrave Louis of Baden, made it impossible for one to obtain money or credit anywhere. Nothing reveals the lack of inner consolidation of the Aus- trian State apparatus and the economic chaos of this period of transition better than the fact that in this time of greatest crisis the task of supplying and paying troops scattered over Europe should have been entrusted to a single individual and not to a governmental organization. On the other hand, noth- ing reveals the importance of the position which Oppenheimer had held and his indispensability better than the fact that immediately after his death the Austria government was thoroughly reorganized. That is to say, an attempt was made to eliminate the lack of organization in the army and in the economy, and to reorganize the two highest administrative authorities, the War Commissariat - and the Department of Finance. Prince Eugene, who was as talented a statesman and politician as he was a general, became the head of the War Commissariat, which had charge of the entire military organi- zation. The reorganization of the highest administrative authorities did not entirely eliminate the need for army contractors. On the contrary, during the War of the Spanish Succession, which extended over a greater territory than any other war of that period, it was necessary to supply not only the army and the troops of the Empire but also the contingents of the Electors of the Palatinate, Mayence, Treves and Saxony, and to subdue rebellious princes like the ambitious Bavarian ruler Max 30 THE COURT JEW Emanuel and his brother, the Archbishop of Cologne, who had closely allied themselves with Louis XIV. Oppenheimer, who had controlled all the operations himself and had made his agents and subcontractors personally depend- ent upon him, was replaced by a number of suppliers who were to some extent united in a company and to some extent inde- pendent of one another. Samuel's oldest son, Emanuel, who had already given proof of his ability, and his younger brother, Wolf, took over the management of the Oppenheimer firm. The Court Treasury time and again praised the Oppenheimers' honesty and punctuality, while Margrave Louis of Baden praised Wolfs tireless zeal. But Emanuel, a calm and mild-mannered man, lacked the boldness and the self-assurance of his father. It is not sur- prising that the martial Margrave Louis of Baden gave his friendship to Samuel, whereas the gentle and humane Prince Eugene was more drawn to Emanuel. Samuel Oppenheimer had, in his autocratic manner, used his subcontractors only as instruments of his will and had therefore been able to defeat all his competitors at every turn. Emanuel, however, treated them as equal partners and often entered into joint ventures with them. During the War of the Spanish Succession and in the last war with the Turks (1716-1719) he frequently under- took to deliver supplies by himself; but for the most part, especially in the provisioning of the armies on the Upper, Middle and Lower Rhine, on the Danube and in Hungary, he joined to himself former subcontractors like Simon Michael, Lazarus Hirschel, Emanuel Drach, Wertheimer, Schlesinger and Spitzen Christian merchants, like the antisemitic State Councillor Mohr von Mohrenfeld, began more frequently than before to take part in the provisioning of the army. The mo- nopoly of the Oppenheimer firm was thus broken. Some of the suppliers who had cooperated with Emanuel became more and more independent and formed their own companies with rel- THE COMMISSARY 31 atives of theirs, while new men also entered the field and joined one or another company. For example, in the year 1709 Lazarus Hirschel supplied th^ armies in Hungary, Italy and Transylvania; Herz Lehmann, a brother of the Saxon Resident, Bernd Lehmann, joined with his partners, Abraham Spitz and Isaak Nathan Oppenheimer, in delivering large amounts of provisions to the army in Hungary; Abraham Ulm of Pfersee cooperated with Loew Sinzheim to obtain horses and provisions for the regiments in Catalonia. As the Department of Finance itself confirmed, Simon Michael of Pressburg, in spite of a dangerous rebellion in Hungary and the very great shortage of wagons, delivered 12,000 hundred- weights of flour to the besieged fortresses of Raab, Ofen and Komorn and charged a very reasonable price. Had he not done so, the armies in the fortresses would have had to surren- der to the Turks. 3 In addition to the Imperial Court Jews, the factors of the smaller German princes also provided supplies for the armies of the Empire. The Wuerzburg Court Jew, Seckelin, was the purveyor to the Bamberg contingent of the Imperial troops and to the entire district of Franconia. In Frankfort on the Main, whose Jewish community had close connections with the Jew- ish community in Vienna, the firm of Isaak Loeb Goldschmidt, and the brothers Isaak and Samuel Stern, supplied the fortress of Philippsburg in the years 1703, 1709 and 1711, while the Court factor of the Elector of Pfalz-Neuburg, Lazarus von Geldern, the ancestor of Heinrich Heine, supplied the troops in the Empire in his capacity as representative of the Imperial Court Jew Marx Schlesinger. It would lead us too far afield to describe in detail the role which the Court Jews played in each of the remaining German states. In every case it was very similar to that which they played in Austria. Israel Aron, the first Jew to be admitted to East Prussia and 32 THE COURT JEW Brandenburg, served efficiently and diligently as army sup- plier to the Great Elector, who took part in all the European wars of the period. The banker Elias Gumperts of Cleves also helped the Great Elector by equipping the long-neglected fortresses along the Rhine; he furnished stone, wood, palisades and obtained uniforms, munition, food and money for the Brandenburg troops. 4 His son, Ruben Elias, continued his father's work and helped at the same time to provision the troops of the Elector of Saxony and the Archbishop of Cologne. Abraham Isaak Auerbach of Cresfeld delivered supplies to the restless and contentious Bishop of Muenster, Christoph Bernhard von Galen, who fought on the side of England, Hol- land and France as well as against them, and who attempted to attack the Netherlands with his few troops. The Duke of Wuerttemberg, Karl Alexander, at the outbreak of the Polish-French War, commissioned Joseph Suess Oppenheimer, the famous Jud Suess, to furnish war material and grain and to obtain tents for the infantry and cavalry. During the War of the Austrian Succession, the two Silesian and the Seven Years' Wars we find Jewish purveyors with the Bavarian army that at one moment fought on the side of and the next moment against the Prussians, with the Prussians who fought against the Austrians and with the Austrians and Saxons who fought against the Prussians. In Munich Abraham Maendle of Kriegshaber provided the Bavarian Electors for decades with practically all of the cavalry supplies, and also procured for them tents, cartridges, flour, oats, hay, straw and wood. Mayer Elias, the Court factor of the Elector Palatine, and in particular Seligmann Loew and Anschel Levy of Schnaittach, Court agents of the Upper Palatinate, had the thankless task of provisioning the underfed, underpaid and poorly equipped soldiers of the German armies of the Empire. 5 In every case it was the same story as in Austria. Attempts THE COMMISSARY 33 were continually made to replace the Jews by the Christians* The Jews were held responsible for difficulties which actually arose from the fact that the supply system was disorganized and that the state officials were unreliable and corrupt* In Bavaria it was decided in 1758 to entrust the supplying of provision and munitions to a nobleman who was given the title of General Director of Provisions. But it was necessary to replace him after a short time because he had embezzled money advanced to him. His successor had to be dismissed for incompetence. However, because of the complaint that there were too many Jewish purveyors, a Christian was made nomi- nal head of supplies and given the title of Hauptadmodiateur (Chief of Supplies) while the actual work was done, principally in the years 1760-1762, by Anschel Levy and Seligmann Loew of Schnaittach. Lieutenant-Colonel von Seyboldsdorff requested the Bavar- ian Elector, in the name of the officers and men of his contin- gent, to commission the two Jews to supply his troops with bread and forage since they were the most reliable purveyors to be found. The Commander of the Imperial Army, Norawitzky, testified in 1760 that Anschel Levy and Seligmann Loeb de- livered their supplies in a most satisfactory manner despite the fact that they were paid less than any of the other con- tractors. And whereas other suppliers had left the troops in the lurch during critical moments, the two Jews had accom- panied the army into enemy territory at great personal risk. The historian whose task it is to weigh the facts of the past in an unbiased manner, sine ira et studio^ has to answer the question: Was the Jewish commissioner, as many of his con- temporaries and some of his later critics have described him, the hardhearted exploiter who took advantage of the poor soldiers to reap exorbitant profits? Or was he, as others have maintained, an indispensable aid to the rulers whom he served unconditionally? Had he unselfishly saved the State from ruin and decline, while the proper supporters of the throne, 34 THE COURT JEW the noblemen and the clergy, shamelessly deserted their princes? Whatever was disreputable and unhealthy in the supply business lay in the nature of the activity itself. Even Christian contractors like Mohr von Mohrenfeld, the Saxon Count of Bolza and Heinrich Schimmelmann, Prussia's most important purveyor in the Seven Years' War, did not escape the contempt of the masses. It is noteworthy that the most prominent Court Jews, like Leffmann Behrens, Samson Wertheimer and Moses Benjamin Wulff, very rarely and then only very re- luctantly, took part in this business and made no profit out of it. Even in times of peace, trading in wholesale wares such as grain was considered a very risky affair, since one either made a good deal of money or lost a good deal. In times of war vic- tory in the field was to a great measure dependent upon the food and equipment of the troops, and the skill and prudence of the supplier, therefore, played almost as great a role as the strategic genius of the general. If the army leader, as often happened, was dependent upon the ability and dependability of the commissary, the latter was able to fix whatever prices he deemed best. On the other hand, the supplier stood as much chance of losing as he did of making money. The contracts that he made with the general staff usually required him to put up his entire fortune as security for the fulfilment of the agreement. Yet he ran any number of risks. The enemy often seized his entire shipment. His perishable wares were often ruined through flood, fire or the chicanery of customs officials. He often suffered heavy losses because of the disorganization of the currency system in the Empire, which led to countless law- suits, a fluctuating rate of exchange and the need to exchange money every time one crossed a border. Josef Suess Oppenheimer time and again bitterly complained about the great difficulties he had to face. Instead of profit, THE COMMISSARY 35 all he could look forward to was loss, vexation and harm. 6 The business of furnishing supplies had been so difficult for him that, in consequence of an intrigue on the part of his superiors, he lost 185,000 gulden. Another important factor responsible for the bad reputation of army contracting was the corruption of the State officials. It was the practice to pay them a bribe in order to receive a contract. Before concluding a contract Samuel Oppenheimer once had to pledge himself not to have anything to do with dishonest officials. It often happened that competitors would bid for a contract as at an auction, or one commissary would replace another by offering more money for a contract than had been asked. The masses knew little about the intrigues, hatreds, set- backs and discouragements to which the war contractor was subjected. They saw only despised Jews, who only a short time before had been expelled from the country, now return- ing as distinguished gentlemen, speaking the language of the country, wearing the clothes of the time, dealing with minis- ters, politicians and generals, living in beautiful homes in which they imagined there must be fabulous treasures. They themselves were burdened with heavy taxes and duties, their business had declined to the vanishing point, their fields lay waste, their houses had been destroyed by the weapons of the enemy, their soldiers suffered hunger and cold, went without uniforms and were seldom paid. The absolute ruler who planned and carried out the wars, who levied and collected the taxes and who was little con- cerned about the lot of his soldiers, was far removed from his subjects. He was as infallible and as unapproachable as God Himself. To him they owed blind obedience. The Jew who lived in their midst, however, could be reached. He was a man like themselves, only weaker and more vulnerable. He might possess a title, but he held no position. He served the powerful, but he held no power himself. He might possess some special 36 THE COURT JEW rights, but not the full rights of the ordinary citizen. Was it any wonder then if the full rage of the masses was loosed against the man whom they believed responsible for all their burdens and sufferings; or if they did not content themselves with threats and oaths, but at times attacked and robbed and even murdered him? The following incident in the life of Samuel Oppenheimer reveals how dangerous was the position in which war com- missaries found themselves. The incident took place in the year 1700, shortly after the end of the great war with the Turks and several months before the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, at a time therefore when the masses were in an extremely tense state. For an entirely insignificant reason a chimney-sweep had made fun of a friend of Samuel Oppenheimer's a wild mob plundered Oppenheimer's house on the Bauernmarkt in Vienna. In their rage they broke windows and doors, destroyed the costly furnishings, looted everything they could carry away and tore up or stole almost all the business papers and ledgers, contracts and correspondence. Many persons were wounded and several killed. Samuel and his family had the good luck to escape from the raging mob by hiding in an underground passageway. The police succeeded several hours later in sup- pressing the riot and restoring order by hanging the chief inciters of the riot a chimney-sweep and a swordcutler from an iron railing at the entrance to the house. An official announcement issued the next day ordered the return of all the stolen property. But the damage done was too great to be compensated for in this way, for besides the material dam- age which amounted to some 100,000 florins, there was the enormous loss caused by the destruction of the business documents and ledgers. We may now attempt to answer the second question: What importance, from the standpoint of historical development, did the activity of the war commissary have for the polit- THE COMMISSARY 37 ical growth of the State at whose disposal he placed his services? It has been said of the Portuguese Jews in Holland that the supplies they furnished the Netherlands in their struggle for existence against France saved her from ruin, Fernando Antonio Carvajal, who supplied Oliver Cromwell's armies, was regarded by his contemporaries as \"the great Jew\" and has lived in the memory of succeeding generations. Salomo Medina, the war commissary of William of Orange was hon- ored as the \"great contractor'* and elevated to the nobility by his grateful ruler. 7 Apart from a few worthless titles, Samuel Oppenheimer received no reward from the Emperor. His contemporaries did not honor him nor did succeeding generations even remem- ber his name. Still he deserves to be ranked with the famous commissaries of his time and he himself might properly have boasted that, in a period when no one else came to the rescue of the Emperor, he had helped maintain armadas and fort- resses and helped conquer countries and provinces. For if it is true, as Frederick the Great's maxim has it, that in building an army the stomach is the foundation and food the compass, then one may justly claim that the Jewish contractors, in particular Samuel Oppenheimer, helped to strengthen this foundation and save it from ruin. CHAPTER II THE COURT CONTRACTOR JL H E princes who, during the period between the end of the Thirty Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, ruled over the two hundred and forty territories of the Holy Roman Empire were restless, overbearing and ambitious men, burning with a desire to perform great deeds and experience colorful adventures. It was a hard and reckless generation whose violent natures knew no bounds and whom no divine or human laws could restrain. They often ruled territories no larger than a middle-sized provincial town of today. But many of them were convinced that they rightfully held complete sway over the lives and possessions of their subjects and that they were, as it has been put, little Jehovahs on earth. The prince was the sun about which the planets had their orbits; his land was the universe which his will had brought into being and whose destiny was subject to his whim. His Court was the heart from which the blood circulated through the body of the State. Or else it was the center which like a magnet irresistibly drew everything to it. In this solemn and aristocratic century, in which the citizens of the once flourishing free cities had lost their political power and the universities lacked vital force, the Court became the real bearer of culture, the source of social life and refinement, \"the only and indeed the best school to stimulate and awake the minds of the men,\" or as Mosche- rosch described it, \"a compendium of life and human activity/' 1 But in order that a Court might possess splendor and gain a reputation, \"the chief means of statesmanship in those days/ 1 38 THE CONTRACTOR 39 it was necessary to make it a showplace such as had never been seen before. And so one built huge castles with high stairways, fluted columns, winding halls, colorful ornaments and decora- tions, fagades and long arcades, filled them with precious fur- niture, oriental carpets, gilded or brocaded tapestries, and priceless vases, laid out wide gardens with rich fountains and cascades and with bronze statues, and collected paintings by the most famous masters and manuscripts of bygone centuries. One arranged noisy feasts and banquets, operas and comedies, sledding parties in the summer and hunting parties in the win- ter, brought singers from Italy, dancers from Spain, actors from France, filles dejoie from Turkey, planted tropical flowers and trees in the mountains, made artificial hills on level ground, built Greek temples and Indian pagodas or turned towers and summer houses into Turkish seraglios. The Court not only became the social and intellectual center of the country but its ceremony and etiquette and the manners of its officials served as models which the subjects eagerly tried to imitate. To have the least connection with the Court was a source of pride, whether it meant serving as court musician, court painter, court poet or court physician, or even merely as court baker, court shoemaker or court tailor. This unhappy and apathetic generation, depressed by the events of the time, had lost all sense of self-respect and dignity. It was weary of controlling its own destiny and wanted to have someone guide it. If a young man wants to serve his country, a contemporary writer advised, he must try to gain the esteem and favor of the princes and nobles; thus the way will be open for him to obtain a position. Is it any wonder then that active, clever and ambitious Jews should have been filled with the desire to share some of this splendor and to win the recognition of princes and noblemen? Is it any wonder that they tried to adapt themselves to the spirit of their epoch, in which title and rank had become ends in themselves, in which the important thing was not one's ac- 40 THE COURT JEW complishment or character but one's social position and con- nections with the Courts, and in which even Christian mer- chants were overjoyed to receive a patent of nobility or a coat of arms from the Emperor or a prince? Is it any wonder that the Jew should long to escape from the narrow Jewish quarter where nothing ever changed, where his horizon was bounded by his home and his business, the synagogue and the commu- nity, or that he should wish to free himself from the social, economic and political restrictions which segregated him from the people around him ? For the political status of the Jew was not very different at the end of the Thirty Years' War from what it had been in earlier times- Most of the free cities still would not admit him, and in order to reside in the few territories which did accept him he had to pay heavy taxes and secure expensive letters of protection. Most of the professions were closed to him and the various merchant and trade guilds excluded him. Christian society was just as prejudiced against him as it had been in the Middle Ages. While a strict and intolerant orthodoxy ruled the masses, the belief in demons, witches and devils was still rampant. As in the Middle Ages, the old accu- sations against the Jews were repeated: they blasphemed Christ and Christ's name, desecrated the Host, poisoned wells, used the blood of Christian children and brought on plagues. Almost every day Jews walking in the street would be followed and mocked. A Jewish peddler riding on a pig was a stock figure in the caricatures of the time; the petty Jewish dealer greedy for money or the crafty war contractor were stock figures in the novels and plays of the period. The attitude of a number of the princes was, however, quite different. Many had been influenced by the French-Dutch culture of the time and the new doctrine of religious tolerance and spiritual freedom. 2 At the Court of Hanover, where the philosopher Leibniz was endeavoring to unite the Christian THE CONTRACTOR 41 denominations, people read the writings of Descartes with ex- treme interest and were enchanted by the philosophy of Spinoza. If the ideas of Spinoza were followed, wrote Sophie, the wise Princess of Hanover, then all the Christian sects would soon become united. 2 * 1 Her brother, Karl Ludwig of the Palatinate, the same prince under whom Samuel Oppenheimer served his apprenticeship as Court agent, earnestly endeavored to persuade Spinoza to come to the University of Heidelberg. His declaration of full religious freedom attracted French Huguenots, Dutch Anabap- tists, Polish Socinians and German and Portuguese Jews to Mannheim, which he had newly founded on the basis of self- government of the citizens and economic independence of the individual. 3 The Great Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William, 4 who during his youth had lived in Holland and been influenced by the spirit of religious tolerance, opposed the belief held in his day that there must be only one denomination in a State. Convinced that the essence of tolerance is tolerance of every- one without exception, he held the modern view that religion must be separated from politics and the Church from the State. He accordingly accepted Arians and Socinians, Men- nonites, Huguenots and the Jews who had been expelled from Austria. He assisted Catholics, corresponded with Jesuits and considered founding a university in which all those who were persecuted because of their religious or political convictions could find freedom of religion and conscience. The Jew who wanted to achieve a certain standing at Court could feel encouraged by this tolerant attitude of the princes. There was also another factor which could aid his efforts* The Courts during this century needed all sorts of luxury wares, precious stones, pearls, silk, velvet, damask, brocades, carpets* paintings, tapestry and porcelains. 5 They needed rare spices for their tables pepper, ginger, nutmeg the so-called 42 THE COURT JEW colonial wares, which were difficult to procure and which were extremely costly. It did not matter who furnished these luxuries, whether Christian or Jew, native or foreigner, they were ready to reward generously anyone who was able to obtain them. To the clever and ambitious Jew who was familiar with this development it seemed not impossible to satisfy the wishes and caprices of these luxury-loving princes who were fascinated by the gleam of rare and precious stones. The trade in jewels, which had never been forbidden by the guilds, had been for a long time one of the main business activities of the Jews who were considered the best gem experts. As in the field of army contracting, their family and business connections in various countries proved of great help to them. Holland, for example, 6 where relatives of the Gumperts of Cleves and of the Berlin, Frankfort and Viennese Court Jews lived, was then the trad- ing center for gems and pearls which were brought there by Portuguese sailors and sold to Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews who sold them in turn to their coreligionists in Germany. Amsterdam was at that time the center of the diamond industry which was almost entirely in Jewish hands. The same was true of the luxury goods for which Holland set the fashion. Fine Leyden cloth and spices from the colonies were disposed of by the Jews at the fairs in Brunswick and Leipzig, in particular at the fair at Frankfort on the Main, which has been called the chief staple market between Western and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the Jew could buy at the Leipzig Fair choice products manufactured in Italy, Switzer- land, Bohemia, Silesia, France and Spain, as well as goods produced in Nuremberg, Augsburg or Saxony. 7 Moreover, many governments actually forced the Jews to take the products of the luxury industries which had recently been founded by religious exiles, the Huguenots and the Belgian Protestants, and to sell them both in the domestic and foreign markets. As a result, the warehouses of the Jews were filled THE CONTRACTOR 43 with brocades, velvet, silk, clothes embroidered with gold and silver, gilded laces and other costly goods, and thus offered the prospective purchaser a wide choice. 8 Trading in wares of this sort also entailed trading in money. Ever since the great trading companies of the Middle Ages had become the bankers of the English and French kings, and the North German firms of the Renaissance had begun to finance the German emperors and princes, moneylending re- mained a branch of business conducted by merchants. 9 Even at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, when public banks arose like those in Hamburg, Am- sterdam and Vienna, and when stock exchanges were founded in many cities, the private banker was still indispensable. In fact, in this period he became even more necessary, since trade and traffic were increasing, international relations we"
