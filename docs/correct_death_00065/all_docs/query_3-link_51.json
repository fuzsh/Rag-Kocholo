        "text": "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n\n1646-1716\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German polymath, was born in 1646 and died in 1716. He was one of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of his time. He independently invented the mathematical discipline now known as the calculus, sharing that distinction with Sir Isacc Newton. Leibniz also made important contributions to many other fields of science, philosophy and mathematics. He made contributions to geology, historiography, physics, and library science among other disciplines. Leibniz also worked as a diplomat for such employers as the Elector of Hanover and the Elector of Mainz. He combined his work as a diplomat with his interest in mathematics by considering problems in encryption and ciphering. Among the results was the ciphering machine on display.\n\nLeibniz as Cryptographer features the only working model ever constructed of the cryptography machine conceived of in the late 17th Century by Leibniz. This machine uses certain structures and methods similar to his calculating machine, versions of which were built in his lifetime. One of the most important elements in the mechanical functioning of the machine was the staffelwalze or stepped drum. There is a short digital film that illustrates the functioning of the stepped drum on the Multimedia page.\n\nNicholas Rescher with the cipher machine that was constructed as part of his research into Leibniz''s interest in Cryptography and the mathematics of cryptography."
