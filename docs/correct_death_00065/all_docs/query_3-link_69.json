        "text": "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig, Germany in July 1646 to a mother and father who were both in academia. His father died when he was six years old and his relatives gave him access to his father’s extensive library. It was at this young age that Gottfried learned to love reading and took in all kinds of topics like philosophy, law, and literature. Throughout primary school, Leibniz’s teachers tried to keep him occupied on topics appropriate for his age, so he began teaching himself, using his father’s library. He taught himself Latin and foundations of philosophy. At age 15, he enrolled in the University of Leipzig where the classics were taught but there was little science being taught. After two years, he attended the University of Jena where he was given his first introduction into geometry by Erhard Weigel. He finished his doctorate at the University of Altdorf in 1666. His thesis in university combined law, philosophy, and mathematics.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate he was offered a position at the University of Altdorf but decided he was going to travel Europe. He worked on many diplomatic pursuits through Europe with his law background under the service of Johann Philipp. In particular, in the early 1670s, he mediated between England, France, and Germany to direct the French government to pursue Egypt instead of countries in Europe. Through his travels he was put in contact with both the Royal Society in London and the Paris Academy of Sciences as well as many practicing mathematicians. In 1673, Gottfried presented his calculating machine to the Royal Society in London and was inducted into the society. The machine was designed to do multiplication and division using repeated addition or subtraction (http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102649684).\n\nIn 1676 he came in the service of Johann Friedrich, duke of Brunswick-Luneburg. It was in his service, that Leibniz was exposed to many fields beyond those he had previous been a part of. He worked as Friedrich’s librarian and advisor, planned new schools, as well as an engineer on mining projects for Friedrich. In 1680, Leibniz was tasked with finding the complete genealogy of the House of Brunswick. This job gave Leibniz the opportunity to travel Europe once again and meet more scholars and mathematicians. He completed his genealogy study in 1690 being able to prove the exact results Friedrich was looking for. He returned to Hannover and continued to advice on political and religious reforms in Germany and Europe. In 1700, the Berlin Academy was created on his recommendation.\n\nThe mathematical advances that Leibniz is most famous for are in the creation of Calculus. There is much debate about who actually created Calculus first, Newton or Leibniz. In 1676, Leibniz received a letter from Newton through the Royal Society stated what he had determined about calculus but it was written in code. Leibniz had been working on similar concepts and wrote Newton back but Newton never responded. In 1684, Leibniz released his theories on calculus and was backed by the Bernoulli family. Twenty years later Newton published his theories on calculus and made a note that Leibniz stole the ideas from him. In 1714, the Royal Society was given the chance to look through the evidence and determine who rightfully discovered calculus first and the honor was given to Newton.\n\nThe scope of Leibniz work reached far beyond mathematics. Another large focus of his was science. The Dictionary of Scientific Biography added a separate section for the scientific works of Leibniz after his original biography had been written. Along with his work in physics, he also did work in chemistry, biology, geology, and ethnography.\n\nLeibniz was well rounded, as his interests were vast from philosophy to invention to mathematics to law to science. He died in Hannover, Germany on November 14, 1716 at age 70 with little acknowledgment of his life.\n\nSources:\n\n“Leibniz: Mathematics.” Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Vol. 8.
