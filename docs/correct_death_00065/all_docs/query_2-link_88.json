        "text": "The ranks of the polymaths are only very sparsely filled in our times. Rather, whoever claims in the 21st century to be at the forefront of multiple scientific discipline, is likely to receive nothing more than a sympathetic smile by his contemporaries. Too complex and too diverse are the many various fields of today's science, and it can almost be considered a characteristic of late modernity that scholars and geniuses are solely experts in a respective rather limited of science. A philosopher is hardly a gifted physicist, mathematician will not attend to the questions of geology, and chemists follow no questions on metaphysics. This was quite different only 300 years ago: A gifted thinker was able to contribute equally to philosophy, mathematics, physics, informational science, history, and other fields and thereby follow his ambition to reach the intellectual forefront in each discipline. Such was Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, whose 370th birthday we just celebrated (July 1) and whose 300th death anniversary we will commemorate this year, as well (November 14). Leibniz was the leading scientist in almost all fields of knowledge of his time, which occasionally make people entitle him \"the last universal scholar of history\" today. He was led by the desire to capture the unity in all diversity, to discover the deeper harmony in nature, a motivation that has constituted an essential driving force in scientific research until today. At the same time Leibniz always endeavored to apply his theoretical thinking into realm of practice. The latter we recognize in his famous credo \"theory cum praxi\".\n\nWhat makes Leibniz particularly important for modern science, is that he is one of the very first scholars who devoted his philosophical thinking to the question of what gives natural laws their very validity. His goal was to overcome the metaphysical justification dilemma of all empirically based laws of nature. The Kepler-Galilean reference to the apparent mathematical precision of the natural laws, which only God would have been able to set up initially, softened the tensions between scientific skepticism and theological revelation certainty and kept it from fully unfolding for some time. But with Leibniz (and right before him René Descartes) the shift to the modern scientific view of nature eventually received its philosophical underpinning.\n\nLeibniz gave a clear answer to this difficult question: God created an ideal world, which finds its articulation in the laws of nature itself. When he created the world, according to Leibniz, many possible worlds were available to him. And of those God chose the best. We note that the Leibnizian image of God is here rather deistic than theistic. Little of the Christian religion of revelation was left in it. As speculative as this of Leibniz’s thoughts appears to us, it finds a surprising correspondence in modern theoretical physics. Here we encounter a principle, which ultimately dictates the very laws of nature that certain physical quantities take on optimum values. These are the so-called \"extremal principles\" (a well-known example the reader might remember from high school physics classes is the path of light when passing from one medium to another, such as from air to water). For Leibniz this is nothing but a consequence of the optimal constitution of the world. He would claim that in the best of all possible worlds extremal principles must apply, and inversely the fact that such principles apply in the real world shows that this world is the best of all worlds. A prevailing principle of Leibniz's argument is the \"principle of sufficient reason\". In brief, it says: Nothing happens without reason. This principle should also apply to the laws of nature and constitute in the end their form, i.e. explain why they are the way they are.\n\nHis deep faith in rational logic and mathematics went so far that Leibniz was convinced that next to the world also God can be calculated. With all the criticism and mockery Leibniz found himself confronted with already by his contemporaries facing the obvious imperfection of the world and all suffering in it we should know: Leibniz did not primarily have today's world in his mind when he referred to the best of all worlds but a possible future one. The world cannot be seen as perfect, because it already is, but because it has the potential to develop towards perfection. His philosophy is therefore a call for an improvement of the world, which can still claim validity today.\n\nThe modern observer of the fragmentation of science into countless subdivisions makes the Leibnizian desire for a unity of all science appear quite romantic. But based on this view Leibniz developed a scientific oeuvre which covered and advanced not only the entire knowledge of his time but furthermore provided significant impetus to future developments. Best known is his contribution to modern mathematics, where he laid the foundations of calculus, not only in computational terms, but also by providing a proper formal mathematical framework for it. This distinguished him from his competitor Isaac Newton who developed calculus in parallel but by other methods and forms (resulting in the most famous originality dispute in the history of mathematics). With the introduction of the binary number system, Leibniz can also be considered the ancestor of modern computer algorithms. He furthermore made his name as an inventor: He developed improvements of door locks, created plans for a submarine, and invented a device to determine the speed of wind. But his most significant invention was a stepped drum for a mechanical calculator, with which he created an earliest precursor of today's computers.\n\nOnly a very deep and extensive study of his widespread writing (which did not happen until the 20th century) reveals the significance of Leibniz’s thoughts for today’s sciences. He developed (thus contradicting Newton) a concept in which time and space are given solely by relational order connections which find their representations in the material world and are thus not given absolutely and independent of all matter. In other words, space and time should be determined by relationship structure, by relations and properties of material things such as causal connections, and not vice versa the causal connections by a pre-structured time and space. This idea would find its completion not before the 20th century in Einstein's theory of relativity. Furthermore, modern neuroscience finds in Leibniz’s writing a first reference for the so-called \"qualia\" problem which he described in his famous mill parable: “Moreover, we must confess that perception, and what depends upon it, is inexplicable in terms of mechanical reasons, that is through shapes, size and motions. If we imagine that there is a machine whose structure makes it think, sense, and have perceptions, we could conceive it enlarged, keeping the same proportions, so that we could enter into it, as one enters a mill. Assuming that, when inspecting its interior, we will find only parts that push one another, and we will never find anything to explain a perception. And so, one should seek perception in the simple substance and not in the composite or in the machine. (GP VI, 609/AG 215). A third example that illustrates how far Leibniz was ahead of his time is his treatment of infinitely small numbers and their sums (which led to the mathematical concept of the integral). Leibniz said that a difference between two sizes is \"infinitesimally\" small, if it can be made smaller than any given positive number. That is the modern mathematical approach to the understanding of the infinitely small, which was not develop before the mid-19th century by Augustin-Louis Cauchy. And Leibniz derivation of the integral as the sum of an infinite number of infinitely small areas underneath a function curve, as we know it from high school mathematics, was also only formalized within the field of analysis in the 19th century by Bernard Riemann. Thus the last universal scholar whose birth and death anniversary we celebrate this year was in many ways a grandfather of all today's scientists.\n\nOn my web page: http://larsjaeger.ch/?p=1219&lang=en"
