        "text": "Appendix 2 THREAT-LISTING INFORMATION AND QUESTIONNAIRE Date Dear Specialist group: In 2002, the <strong>Department</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Conservation</strong> developed a new system for classifying organisms according to their risk <strong>of</strong> extinction (Molloy et al. 2002). This system allows the classification <strong>of</strong> conservation status/risk <strong>of</strong> extinction <strong>of</strong> all organisms known to occur in a wild state in New Zealand. Endemics, non-endemic natives, migrants, vagrants, and introduced and naturalised species are all included, as are taxa which have not been formally described. This is not a priority-setting system in the way that the listing <strong>of</strong> Molloy & Davis (1992, 1994) was, so does not include information on taxonomic distinctiveness, or on human values. It is an accurate, constantly-updatable database that is a resource for priority setting, among other functions, rather than a priority list in itself. The lists are available for use by anyone interested and are accessible through the DOC web-site: http://www.doc.govt.nz/Publications/004~Science-and-Research/Biodiversity- Recovery-Unit/Occasional-publications.asp#Threat%20Classification In order to provide the most accurate information, the list is to be fully reviewed and updated every 3 years. The time has come to undertake this process and as such we now wish to gather data to begin the reclassification <strong>of</strong> species under this system. We would therefore be very grateful if you would provide information in response to the attached questionnaire on species or lower-level taxa in your specialist group that you consider to be threatened, or potentially threatened but lacking data on their status. We are aware <strong>of</strong> your expertise in the groups named at the head <strong>of</strong> this letter, but if you have expertise in other taxa, you are welcome to complete questionnaires for those also. Taxa need not be formally described to be included, but those not formally named, and named taxa <strong>of</strong> disputed validity will be listed with a “Taxonomically indeterminate” tag to distinguish them from those with widely accepted, published scientific names. This does not mean that they will receive lower priority for action. In some groups some data, such as those for population trends, may be unknown, but these species are still worth listing. A Data Deficient classification is useful for highlighting needs for research or survey. The most endangered species will be classified as Nationally Critical, those with very restricted distributions as Range Restricted, and those with very low population densities as Sparse even in the absence <strong>of</strong> trend data. All classifications can be tagged Data Poor if necessary. 135"
