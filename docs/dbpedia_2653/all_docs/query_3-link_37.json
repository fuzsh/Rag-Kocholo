        "text": "by Piter Kehoma Boll\n\nA flatworm again, at last! Not a land planarian, but a flatworm nonetheless.\n\nIf there is a group of flatworms that may put land planarians in second plan regarding beauty, those are the polyclads. Living in the sea, especially in coral reefs, polyclads are colorful and curly and may be mistaken by sea slugs.\n\nThe species I’m introducing here today is Pseudobiceros bedfordi, commonly known as the Persian carpet flatworm or Bedford’s flatworm. It is about 8 cm long and lives in coral reefs along Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and adjacent areas. See how beautiful it is:\n\nThe colorful pattern of this and many other polyclad species is likely a warning about their toxicity, although there are few studies regarding toxicity in these animals. Being active predators, polyclads may use their toxins as a way to subdue prey as well.\n\nBut the most interesting thing regarding the Persian carpet flatworm is its sexual behavior. As with most flatworms, they are hermaphrodites, so when two individuals meet and decide to have sex, they have to choose whether they want to play the male or the female role (or both). Unfortunately, most individuals prefer to be males, so those encounters usually end up in a violent fight in which both animals attack the partner with a double penis, a behavior known as penis fencing.\n\nAt the end, the winner spurts its sperm onto the partner and leaves. The horrible part is yet to come, though. The sperm appears to be able to burn like acid through the receiver’s skin tissue in order to reach the inner tissues and thus swim towards the eggs. In some extreme cases the sperm load may be high enough to tore the receiver into pieces! If that’s not a good definition of wild sex, I don’t know what is.\n\nSee also: Gender Conflict: Who’s the man in the relationship?\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nWhitfield, J. (2004).

In fact, Canna indica is the first plant named in the book, so it could be seen as the first life form to receive a valid binomial name.\n\nDespite being called Indian shot or African arrowroot, this species is actually native from the Americas, especially South America, although it may be found as far north as the southern United States. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant and several varieties exist. It is also naturalized in many parts of Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and many Pacific islands.\n\nThe subterranean rhizomes of the Indian shot are edible and were a food crop cultivated by the original inhabitants of the Americas, although is much less used nowadays. The rhizomes may be eaten raw or baked or cooked. The seeds, which are small, globular and black, are very hard and dense and can even be used as bullets, hence the name Indian shot.\n\nThe Indian shot is sometimes used to remove nutrients from wastewaters, being cultivated in constructed wetlands where the wastewaters are kept for purification. There are also some studies pointing to its use as an inhibitor of the activity of the protein reverse transcriptase of HIV.\n\nIsn’t it a nice fellow, after all?\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nCui, L., Ouyang, Y., Lou, Q., Yang, F., Chen, Y., Zhu, W., & Luo, S.

Not because they are less interesting to me, but because I cannot find good information available. But I try to do my best to show all aspects of our amazing biodiversity.\n\nToday I’m introducing another alga, one of the most complex ones, the common stonewort, scientifically known as Chara vulgaris.\n\nFound worldwide in freshwater environments, especially marshes and swamps, the common stonewort may actually be a complex of species. Its name “stonewort” comes from the fact that the plant may become encrusted in calcium carbonate, giving it a stony appearance. Growing up to 120 cm in length/height and having a central articulated stalk with several branches coming out from each node, it may look similar to a horsetail, but its structure is much simpler.\n\nIf you look closer, you’ll see that the stalk is formed by a simple mass of chained cells, but very big ones. Actually, the cells of species in the genus Chara are among the largest known plant cells. And having such large cells, stoneworts have become experts in cytoplasmic streaming, a phenomenon by which organelles and fluids flow throughout the cytoplasm guided by an interaction of myosin molecules that slide along actin molecules. And in case you didn’t know, myosin and actin are also the molecules responsible for muscular contractions in animals.\n\nThe common stonewort is very common in rice fields and serves as a substrate for nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Thus, although usually considered a weed in the fields, the presence of the common stonewort may actually help to increase the soil fertility in rice fields.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nAriosa, Y., Quesada, A., Aburto, J., Carrasco, D., Carreres, R., Leganes, F., & Fernandez Valiente, E.

So let’s try to make 2017 better by starting this year with a tough Friday Fellow, actually the toughest of them all: Conan the bacterium, or Deinococcus radiodurans.\n\nA relative of Taq, Conan the bacterium is a rather large bacterium, measuring 1.5 to 3.5 µm in diameter and usually forming groups of four organisms sticking together, a formation known as tetrad. It is an extremophilic bacterium, able to resist to very harsh environments. Actually, Conan the bacterium is one of the most radiation-resistant organisms known to date and can also resist extremes of cold, dehydration, vacuum, and acid. Its popular name was based on the character Conan the Barbarian.\n\nConan the bacterium was discovered in 1956 during an experiment that tried to sterilize canned food using high doses of radiation. One bacterium survived the high doses of gamma radiation and was identified as a new species.\n\nLater, a group of scientists suggested that the high degree of radioresistence was an adaptation to the Martian environment, so this could be an alien bacterium! But that’s actually bullshit. Conan the bacterium has nothing significantly different from other lifeforms on Earth, but how did such a resistance to radiation evolve? Background radiation on Earth is very weak, so it could not appear by natural selection.\n\nThe results of some experiments published in 1996 revealed that strains of D. radiodurans that are susceptible to desiccation are also susceptible to radiation. Thus, the most likely explanation is that the high resistance to radiation is simply a side-effect to the resistance to desiccation, a condition much more common in the bacterium’s environment.\n\nThe mechanism that allows Conan the bacterium to withstand radiation is very complex, but includes an ability to rebuild DNA strains from fragments, which is helped by the fact that each cells contains four copies of the bacterial chromosome, so that a partially-damaged strain can serve as a model to repair another partially-damaged strain.\n\nOur tiny fellows are always full of amazing surprises!\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nMattimore, V., & Battista, J.

I guess many of you reading this article fit in this category. You may be a housemaid, a lawyer, a taxi driver, or simply a young student, but you have a big interest in science.\n\nWell, what if you could help science from home? That’s actually possible in several ways. There are plenty of programs, applications or websites in which you can help to do research on several different areas. Here, I’ll focus on biological research, since biology is the subject of this blog.\n\nSo, let’s start! See below how you can help.\n\n1. Take photographs of wildlife and make them available online\n\nA lot of people love to take photographs of wildlife. Some websites, such as flickr, are crowded with amazing images of all kinds of lifeforms. Unfortunately, most people protect their work under copyright laws that prevent the photographs to be used without direct permission from the author or by buying it.\n\nBut you can be more generous and distribute your work under a creative commons license. This makes sure that you have to be mentioned as the author of the work while still allowing others to use it. There are several different creative commons licenses. Choose the one that suits you! The important thing is to allow your works to be used on other websites, on books, scientific articles, etc, and thus helping to spread scientific knowledge.\n\nYou can upload your photographs on flickr, Wikimedia Commons, or even on your own website, as long as you indicate the right creative commons license. Be generous!\n\n2. Record the lifeforms you see\n\nMore than only sharing your pictures, you can record the location where you found the species. Thus, you will help the scientific community to improve the knowledge on species distribution around the world. A wonderful place to do that is the website iNaturalist.org. Even if you don’t know the identity of the species you found, you may upload your records there and someone will eventually identify the species for you. Likewise, you may help identify records from other users.\n\n3. Share your bibliographic research on Wikipedia and EOL\n\nIf you are an undergraduate or graduate student, an academic researcher, or simply someone who loves science, and you read a lot of scientific articles, books, encyclopedias, etc, do not lock your knowledge within yourself. Make it available to others! And a wonderful way to do that is by editing Wikipedia.\n\nI guess everyone knows Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If you have been reading about the sexual behavior of earthworms, or the use of a plant extract in the tratment of cervical cancer, just check the Wikipedia’s article on the subject and, if the information is not there already, do not hesitate and add it and, of course, cite the source! Wikipedia may be a little confusing to handle at first, but once you understand it and get excited, no one can stop you!\n\nFurthermore, if you information on a subject that does not have an article on Wikipedia yet, simply start a new article!\n\nAnother project that you can help is the EOL (Encyclopedia of Life), a website that aims to gather information on all lifeforms and let them available in a single place. After you have registered, you will have some limited freedom to add new content, but eventually you may ask for a higher position that will give you access to a greater number of features.\n\nDo you know other ways to help biological research from home? Let a comment to share it with us!\n\nby Piter Kehoma Boll\n\nA fascinating group of animals that has not yet joined the Friday Fellows are the sponges. Different from all other animals, sponges have a unique body structure that behaves more like a plant or fungus. They grow in irregular or radial ways and are usually branched. More than that, they have thousands of small mouths along their bodies, called pores, that suck water from the environment in order to filter food from it.\n\nBut let’s talk about our species. Living in the Caribbean Sea, its name is Callyspongia vaginalis, commonly known as branching vase sponge. Its usual shape is that of a tube or set of tubes, sometimes branched, that may reach several centimeters in length and usually abour 3 cm in diameter. The color may vary from pink or lavender to duller colors, such as brown or gray.\n\nAs most sponges, the branching vase sponge feeds on small particles and microorganisms that it filters from water. As the concentration of particles in the water increases with depth, organisms growing deeper usually grow faster due to the higher food availability.\n\nThe main predators of the branching vase sponge are fishes. They actually act more like herbivores eating plants, as they don’t eat the whole sponge and usually do not kill it, but bite its surface, taking off pieces.\n\nBristlestars, especially of the genus Ophiothrix, such as Ophiothrix lineata, are frequently found living inside the main cavity of the sponge. There, these animals find shelter from predators and, at night, when the environment is safer, they extend their arms outside and clean the sponge from large organic particles, feeding on them. It’s a mutually benefitial association.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nEOL – Encyclopedia of Life. Callyspongia vaginalis. Available at <http://eol.org/pages/1163688/overview&gt;.

It is called giant for a good reason, since it can grow up to 50 m in length and form real forests in the sea. Being able to grow 60 cm in a single day, it has the fastest linear growth of any organism on Earth.\n\nThe giant kelp is a brown algae, so it is not related (at least not closely) to green or red algae, but it is a relative of the tiny diatoms that cover the ocean. It grows in cold waters along the Pacific Coast of the Americas and close to the coast of the countries near Antarctica, such as Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThis amazing organism is composed by a thallus that branches at the base and then continues as a single and very long stalk from which blades develop at regular intervals on only one side. At the base of each blade, there is a gas bladder that helps the whole organism to stand in a more or less upright position.\n\nThe huge kelp forests in the oceans are an important ecosystem and many species depend on them to survive, including other algae. Humans also use the giant kelp either as a direct food source or as a source of dietary supplements, since the alga is rich in many minerals, especially iodine and potassium, as well as several vitamines.\n\nIn the last decades, the kelp populations are decreasing rapidly. This is most likely caused by climatic changes, as this alga cannot develop in temperatures above 21°C. The giant kelp is, thus, just one more victim of global warming. And if it goes extinct, a whole ecosystem will be gone with it.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nFoster, M. (1975).

But what could scary a spider? Well, a web bug!\n\nWe usually think of spider webs as an astonishing evolutionary achievement of this group of arachnids and a very efficient way to capture prey without having to pursue them. Webs are sticky, resistant, and only spiders themselves can move freely through them. The only problem is that this is not true.\n\nA group of bugs that conquered the spider world are the so-called thread-legged assassin bugs, which comprise the subfamily Emesinae of the assassin bugs (family Reduviidae). As the name implies, the assassin bugs are a group of true bugs (suborder Heteroptera) that are expert killers of other creatures.\n\nDuring their evolution, the thread-legged assassin bugs seem to have acquired a special taste for spiders and throughout the world they are usually associated with this eight-legged predators. In many cases, such as the one seen in the picture above, the bugs prey on the spiders, having developed the ability to move through the webs. They usually produce vibrations on the web that attract the spiders. Those, thinking that they caught a prey, are lured directly to their death in the legs and proboscis of the terrible bug.\n\nSome thread-legged assassin bugs have, however, found another way to harass spiders: by stealing their food. In the latter scenario, the bugs usually wait close to or on the spider’s web and, when an insect is caught, they steal it from the spider by ripping it off the web. This kind of behavior is called kleptoparasitism, which means “parasitism by stealing”.\n\nBut how can spiders avoid this bug nightmare?\n\nUntil recently, it was thought that spiders were safe inside caves. Although emesinid bugs do occurr in caves, their association with spiders seemed to be weaker or non-existent there. But new findings are revealing that they pursue our arachnid fellows even to the deepest abysses of Earth.\n\nThe earliest cave-dwelling thread-legged assassin bug known to prey on spiders is Bagauda cavernicola, from India. Its spider-eating habits are known since the first decades of the 20th century.\n\nThe second species, Phasmatocoris labyrinthicus, was found almost a century later, in 2013, in Arizona, USA. More than only preying on spiders, such as the species Eidmanella pallida that lives in the same cave, P. labyrinthicus seem to have developed the ability to manipulate abandoned spiderwebs and use them to detect and capture prey for their own consumption. Only a single instance of such a behavior has been recorded and the species’s behavior needs further studies.\n\nNow, only 3 years later, there are new evidences of more thread-legged assassin bugs molesting spiders in caves. And this time the observations were made in Minas Gerais, Brazil. One individual of the bug species Emesa mourei was seen standing on the web of a recluse spider (Loxosceles similis) while the spider was at the web’s edge. Another specimen of E. mourei was seen feeding on a fly near the web of a pholcid (cellar spider). The fly and the legs of the bug had vestiges of silk, indicating that the bug stole the fly from the spider. Another bug species, Phasmatocoris sp., was observed on a web of the cellar spider Mesabolivar aff. tandilicus. If this species of Phasmatocoris manipulates spider webs the same way that P. labyrinthicus seems to do is something yet to be investigated.\n\nWith three different and very distant records of thread-legged assassin bugs associated with spiders in caves, it is clear that the poor arachnids cannot get rid of those bugs even if they run down into the bowels of the Earth.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nPAPE, R.

And every time we notice it, we get upset, because it means that something we were supposed to eat is now spoiled. Its name is Rhizopus stolonifer, or black bread mold.\n\nHaving a worldwide distribution, the black bread mold is mainly saprotrophic, growing on decaying fruits and bread. During its reproductive phase, it can be noticed as a black and hairy mold, as in the photo above. Eventually, this species can also cause an infection in human face and oropharynx, but most commonly it can be a pathogen of many plant species, thus being of economic concern.\n\nThe black bread mold is a fungus of the order Mucorales, known as pin molds because their sporangia (the structures that contain the asexual spores) remember a pin. These sporangia, which are black, are what one usually notice growing on decaying food. When the sporangia are mature, they release spores of two kinds that germinate and originate two kinds of hyphae (known as + and -) and when two hyphae of opposite type come into contact, they fuse and create a zygospore, which then grows to originate new sporangia.\n\nDue to its importance as an economic pest, there are many studies trying to find ways to get rid of it and very few studies trying to understand the fascinating things that it hides. What a pity.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nEOL – Encyclopedia of Life: Rhizopus stolonifer. Available at <http://eol.org/pages/2944808/overview >.
