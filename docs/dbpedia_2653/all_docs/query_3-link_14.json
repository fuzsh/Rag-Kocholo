This Scientific Opinion covers the plant health risks posed by 2‐year‐old grafted bare rooted plants for planting of Juglans regia imported from Turkey, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Turkey. The relevance of any pest for this Opinion was based on evidence following defined criteria. Two EU quarantine pests, Anoplophora chinensis and Lopholeucaspis japonica, and three pests not regulated in the EU, two insects (Garella musculana, Euzophera semifuneralis) and one fungus (Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae), fulfilled all relevant criteria and were selected for further evaluation. For these pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Turkey were evaluated by considering the possible limiting factors. For these pests, an expert judgement was given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pests, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. While the estimated degree of pest freedom varied among pests, Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae was the pest most frequently expected on the commodity. The expert knowledge elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that 9,554 or more grafted bare rooted plants per 10,000 will be free from Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae.\n\nKeywords: European Union, grafted plants, plants for planting, rootstocks, walnut\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1. Background and Terms of Reference as provided by European Commission\n\n1.1.1. Background\n\nThe new Plant Health Regulation (EU) 2016/20311, on the protective measures against pests of plants, has been applied from December 2019. Provisions within the above Regulation are in place for the listing of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ (Article 42) on the basis of a preliminary assessment, and to be followed by a commodity risk assessment. A list of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ has been published in Regulation (EU) 2018/20192. Scientific opinions are therefore needed to support the European Commission and the Member States in the work connected to Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, as stipulated in the terms of reference.\n\n1.1.2. Terms of Reference\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/20023, the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinions in the field of plant health.\n\nIn particular, EFSA is expected to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in the relevant Implementing Acts as ‘High risk plants, plant products and other objects’. Article 42, paragraphs 4 and 5, establishes that a risk assessment is needed as a follow‐up to evaluate whether the commodities will remain prohibited, removed from the list and additional measures will be applied or removed from the list without any additional measures. This task is expected to be on‐going, with a regular flow of dossiers being sent by the applicant required for the risk assessment.\n\nTherefore, to facilitate the correct handling of the dossiers and the acquisition of the required data for the commodity risk assessment, a format for the submission of the required data for each dossier is needed.\n\nFurthermore, a standard methodology for the performance of ‘commodity risk assessment’ based on the work already done by Member States and other international organisations needs to be set.\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, the Commission asked EFSA in December 2019 to provide scientific opinion in the field of plant health for Juglans regia from Turkey taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical dossier provided by Turkey.\n\n1.2. Interpretation of the Terms of Reference\n\nThe EFSA Panel on Plant Health (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel’) was requested to conduct a commodity risk assessment of Juglans regia from Turkey following the Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019).\n\nThe EU quarantine pests that are regulated as a group in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/20724 were considered and evaluated separately at species level.\n\nAnnex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 lists certain pests as non‐European populations or isolates or species. These pests are regulated quarantine pests. Consequently, the respective European populations, or isolates, or species are non‐regulated pests.\n\nAnnex VII of the same Regulation, in certain cases (e.g. point 32) makes reference to the following countries that are excluded from the obligation to comply with specific import requirements for those non‐European populations, or isolates, or species: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canary Islands, Faeroe Islands, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia (only the following parts: Central Federal District (Tsentralny federalny okrug), Northwestern Federal District (SeveroZapadny federalny okrug), Southern Federal District (Yuzhny federalny okrug), North Caucasian Federal District (Severo‐Kavkazsky federalny okrug) and Volga Federal District (Privolzhsky federalny okrug), San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland5). Those countries are historically linked to the reference to ‘non‐European countries’ existing in the previous legal framework, Directive 2000/29/EC6. Consequently, for those countries, any pests identified, which are listed as non‐European species in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 should be investigated as any other non‐regulated pest.\n\nPests listed as ‘Regulated Non‐Quarantine Pest’ (RNQP) in Annex IV of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, and deregulated pests (i.e. pest which were listed as quarantine pests in the Council Directive 2000/29/EC and were deregulated by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) were not considered for further evaluation.\n\nIn its evaluation the Panel:\n\nChecked whether the provided information in the technical dossier (hereafter referred to as ‘the Dossier’) provided by the applicant (Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry – MAF) was sufficient to conduct a commodity risk assessment. When necessary, additional information was requested to the applicant.\n\nSelected the relevant EU quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (as specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, hereafter referred to as ‘EU quarantine pests’) and other relevant pests present in Turkey and associated with the commodity.\n\nDid not assess the effectiveness of measures for Union quarantine pests for which specific measures are in place for the import of the commodity from Turkey in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 and/or in the relevant legislative texts for emergency measures and if the specific country is in the scope of those emergency measures. The assessment was restricted to whether or not the applicant country implements those measures.\n\nAssessed the effectiveness of the measures described in the Dossier for those Union quarantine pests for which no specific measures are in place for the importation of the commodity from Turkey and other relevant pests present in Turkey and associated with the commodity.\n\nRisk management decisions are not within EFSA's remit. Therefore, the Panel provided a rating based on expert judgement regarding the likelihood of pest freedom for each relevant pest given the risk mitigation measures proposed by the MAF of Turkey.\n\n2. Data and methodologies\n\n2.1. Data provided by MAF of Turkey\n\nThe Panel considered all the data and information (hereafter called ‘the Dossier’) provided by MAF of Turkey, including the additional information provided by MAF of Turkey in April 2021, after EFSA's request.

The IPPC provides an international framework for plant protection that includes developing International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs) for safeguarding plant resources. Available online: https://www.ippc.int/en/core-activities/standards-setting/ispms/\n\nJournals and other sources\n\nJournals and bibliographic database containing research articles on plant pests were used to complete the pest list and required relevant information on pest. National and EU legislations were used to determine pest status in Turkey and in EU, respectively.\n\nAdditional information used by MAF of Turkey to compile the Dossier and details on literature searches along with full list of references can be found in the Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1.\n\n2.2. Literature searches performed by EFSA\n\nThe following general searches were combined: i) a general search to identify pests of Juglans regia in different databases and ii) a general search to identify pests associated with Juglans as a genus. The general searches were run between 6 August and 1 September 2020 using the databases indicated in Table . No language, date or document type restrictions were applied in the search strategy.\n\nThe search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each database listed in Table , according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and the CABI keyword thesaurus.\n\nFor Web of Science, the literature search was performed using a specific, ad hoc established search string (see Appendix B). The string was run in ‘All Databases’ with no range limits for time or language filters.\n\nFinally, the pest list assessed included all the pests associated with J. regia and all EU quarantine pests associated with Juglans as a genus.\n\nAdditional searches, limited to retrieve documents, were run when developing the Opinion. The available scientific information, including previous EFSA opinions on the relevant pests and diseases (see pest datasheets in Appendix A) and the relevant literature and legislation [e.g., Regulation (EU) 2016/2031; Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2018/2019; (EU) 2018/2018 and (EU) 2019/2072; Commission Implementing Decision 2012/138/EU7 were taken into account.\n\n2.3. Methodology\n\nWhen developing the Opinion, the Panel followed the EFSA Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019).\n\nIn the first step, pests associated with the commodity in the country of origin (EU‐regulated pests and other pests) were identified. The EU non‐quarantine pests not known to occur in the EU were selected based on evidence of their potential impact in the EU. After the first step, all the relevant pests that may need risk mitigation measures were identified.\n\nIn the second step, the overall efficacy of the proposed risk mitigation measures for each pest was evaluated. A conclusion on the pest freedom status of the commodity for each of the relevant pests was achieved and uncertainties were identified. Pest freedom was assessed by estimating the number of infested/infected plants out of 10,000 exported plants. Further details on the methodology used to estimate the likelihood of pest freedom are provided in Section 2.3.4.\n\n2.3.1. Commodity data\n\nBased on the information provided by the MAF of Turkey the characteristics of the commodity were summarised.\n\n2.3.2. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nTo evaluate the pest risk associated with the importation of J. regia from Turkey a pest list was compiled. The pest list is a compilation of all identified plant pests associated with J. regia based on information provided in the Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1 and on searches performed by the Panel. In addition, all EU quarantine pests associated with any species of Juglans were added to the list.\n\nThe scientific names of the host plants (i.e. Juglans regia and Juglans) were used when searching in the EPPO Global Database and CABI Crop Protection Compendium. The same strategy was applied to the other databases excluding EUROPHYT and Web of Science.\n\nEUROPHYT was investigated by searching for interceptions associated with J. regia commodities imported from Turkey from 1995 to May 2020 and TRACES‐NT was used for interceptions from May 2020 to January 2021.\n\nThe search strategy used for the Web of Science Database was designed combining English common names for pests and diseases, terms describing symptoms of plant diseases and the scientific and English common names of the commodity and excluding pests which were identified using searches in other databases. The established search string is detailed in Appendix B and was run on 6 August 2020.\n\nThe titles and abstracts of the scientific papers retrieved were screened and the pests associated with J. regia were included in the pest list.\n\nFinally, the list was complemented by those pests mentioned in the Dossier if they were not found using the source of information listed above.\n\nThe compiled list (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix D) includes all agents reported in association with J. regia, potentially including natural enemies of insects and not harmful microorganisms, and all quarantine pests that use Juglans as their host. The list was eventually further compiled with other relevant information (e.g. EPPO Codes, taxonomic information, categorisation, distribution) useful for the selection of the pests relevant for this Opinion.\n\nThe evaluation of the compiled pest list was carried out in two steps: first, the relevance of the EU quarantine pests was evaluated (Section 4.1); and second, the relevance of any other plant pests was evaluated (Section 4.2).\n\nPests for which limited information was available on one or more criteria used to identify them as relevant for this Opinion are listed in Appendix C (List of potential pests not further assessed).\n\n2.3.3. Listing and evaluation of risk mitigation measures\n\nThe proposed risk mitigation measures were listed and evaluated for the commodity. When evaluating the potential pest freedom of the commodity the following types of potential infection sources for J. regia plants in export nursery and relevant risk mitigation measures were considered (see also Figure ):\n\npest entry from surrounding areas,\n\npest entry with new plants/seeds,\n\npest spread within the nursery.\n\nThe risk mitigation measures proposed by MAF of Turkey were evaluated.\n\nInformation on the biology, likelihood of entry of the pest to the export nursery, of its spread inside the nursery and the effect of the measures on the specific pest on the commodity were summarised in pest sheets for each pest selected for further evaluation (see Appendix A).\n\n2.3.4. Expert knowledge elicitation\n\nTo estimate the level of pest freedom of the commodities, a semi‐formal expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) was performed following Annex B.8 on semi‐formal EKE of the EFSA Opinion on the principles and methods behind EFSA's Guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scientific Assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018). The specific question for the semi‐formal EKE was defined as follows: ‘Taking into account i) the risk mitigation measures listed in the Dossier, and ii) other relevant information, how many of 10,000 J. regia plants will be infested with the relevant pest/pathogen when arriving in the EU?’. The EKE question was common for all the pests that were assessed.\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the EKE (expert judgements) on the pest freedom of the commodity for each pest were taken into account and quantified in the probability distribution applying the semi‐formal method described in Section 3.5.2 of the EFSA PLH Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018). Finally, the results were reported in terms of the likelihood of pest freedom. The lower 5% percentile of the uncertainty distribution reflects the opinion that pest freedom is with 95% certainty above this limit.\n\nThe risk assessment uses individual plants as the most suitable granularity. The following reasoning is given:\n\nThere is no quantitative information available regarding the clustering of plants during production.\n\nFor the pests under consideration, a cross‐contamination during transport is not likely.\n\nThe walnut plants are delivered to fruit producers or nurseries.\n\n3. Commodity data\n\n3.1. Description of the commodity\n\nThe commodity to be exported to the EU are 2‐year‐old Juglans regia (common name: walnut; family: Juglandaceae) grafted bare rooted plants for planting referred to as saplings, without leaves (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1). Juglans regia is bud grafted on J. regia rootstock. The production of plants is carried out in soil in production plots in open air. Before export, the roots are washed to remove soil. At the moment of export, the diameter at the collar of saplings is 1.5–2 cm and the height of the sapling is 120–150 cm. Walnut saplings are delivered to fruit producers or nurseries (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1).\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 1.0 the following J. regia varieties registered in Turkey can be exported: ‘Adilcevaz 13’, ‘Akça’, ‘Altınova‐1’, ‘Altınova‐2’, ‘Balaban’, ‘Bayrak’, ‘Bilecik’, ‘Chandler’, ‘Darende 1’, ‘Diriliş’, ‘Fernette’, ‘Fernor’, ‘Franquette’, ‘Gültekin‐1’, ‘Hartley’, ‘Hilal’, ‘Howard’, ‘Kaman 1’, ‘Kaplan‐86’, ‘Kazankaya’, ‘Kozdere’, ‘Maraş 12’, ‘Maraş 18’, ‘Midland’, ‘Niksar 1’, ‘Oğuzlar 77’, ‘Pedro’, ‘Potamia Erdin’, ‘Şebin’, ‘Şen ‐ 1’, ‘Şen ‐ 2’, ‘Sölöz’, ‘Sütyemez 1’, ‘Tokat‐1’, ‘Uğur 1’, ‘Yabani ceviz’, ‘Yalova‐1’, ‘Yalova‐2’, ‘Yalova‐3’, ‘Yalova‐4’, ‘Yavuz‐1’, ‘Yivlik77’, ‘Zengibar’ and ‘15 Temmuz’.\n\nThat list may increase with addition of those varieties for which an application process for registration has been completed (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n3.2. Description of the production areas\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 1.0, walnut saplings are produced in 36 provinces in Turkey, although the production is mainly concentrated in Balıkesir, Bursa, Denizli, İzmir, Samsun and Yalova provinces. Balıkesir ranks first in the production of walnut saplings, see Figure .\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 3.1, walnut production in Turkey is certified and the same standards are applied for domestic and international trade. Certified walnut saplings are officially checked annually during production, and all certified walnut saplings have export potential. In 2020, certificates were issued for 8,500,000 walnut saplings grown by 162 sapling producers. Manufacturers and production sites for export to the EU are currently unknown due to the ban imposed by the EU (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nBased on the above information, the Panel considers in its assessment all 36 provinces where walnut saplings are produced as potential places of production of walnut saplings to be exported to the EU.\n\nThe production areas are surrounded by wire or stone wall or left empty (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nAccording to the rules described in Table , a distance of at least 20 m is left between the nurseries and other woody plants (Dossier Section 3.1). There is no information on the species composition of the woody plants in the surroundings.\n\nTable 4\n\nWALNUTInsect and miteWalnut moth (Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana)During the vegetation period, a general examination is performed by visual inspection at least once; shoot, branch samples are examined under binocular.BacteriumBacterial blight of walnut disease (Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis)Visual inspection at least once during vegetation period; if in doubt, laboratory analysis is performed.Bacterial crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens)At the time of harvesting, the roots are examined for the presence of bacterial crown gall; if in doubt laboratory analysis is performed.NematodeRoot knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.)Analysis is done in the spring or autumn once before planting, if the soil analysis and harvesting from the area to be produced is not in place, then analysis is done as a maximum every 4 years.

Annual production is 8–10 million walnut saplings in Turkey (see Figure ). In addition to the production of walnut saplings, only a few producers also produce other fruit saplings in different plots and leave at least 8 m distance between the production plots of walnut and other species.\n\nAccording to Köppen–Geiger climate classification, the main climate present in Turkey belongs to the classes B, C, D and E (Yılmaz and Çiçek, 2018). Tropical climate zone (A) is not present in Turkey and the polar climate (E) is restricted only to high mountain areas. The temperate climate (C) is the most widely distributed in Turkey (Yılmaz and Çiçek, 2018).\n\n3.3. Production and handling processes\n\n3.3.1. Growing conditions\n\nThe production of plants is carried out in the soil in production plots in the open air.\n\nAfter a 2‐year break in the sapling production plot (i.e. rotation for the first year cultivation of cereals and fallow for the second year after the saplings are pulled), the same plot can be used as a production parcel (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1).\n\nThe isolation distances for sapling production plot and for mother blocks (i.e. an area that includes the plants from which the propagation materials are obtained) from gardens are specified in Table .\n\nTable 3\n\nPlant groupBreeding No. 1 (preliminary basic production material)Breeding No. 2 (basic production material)Breeding No. 3 (certified production material)Nursery gardens (preliminary basic/basic/certified sapling production)WALNUTIt must be in screenhouse or at least 500 m away from non‐certification materialIt must be at least 100 m away from the material outside certification.\n\nIf the required isolation distance cannot be provided, reproduction should be made in screenhouse.It must be at least 20 m away from the material outside certification.It must be at least 8 m away from outside certification.\n\nWalnut saplings to be exported to the EU fall into the category ‘Nursery gardens’ (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nSoil samples are taken from the area where mother blocks will be established and if free from nematodes (root knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp.), saplings with basic certificate must be planted in the mother block facility.\n\nThe maximum and the minimum plant densities are six and four saplings per m2 in nurseries (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\n3.3.2. Source of planting material\n\nThe propagation material is obtained from the producer's own or another producer's mother block (Dossier Section 1.0). Ninety‐one per cent of the certified walnut sapling production are made by using the buds obtained from the saplings producer's own mother plants (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nMost producers purchase certified seeds from a few producers. Less than 4% of the rootstocks are produced via tissue culture methods (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nIf the production materials used, namely buds, seeds, seedlings and clonal rootstocks, have been previously certified by the Ministry, they can be used in sapling productions. It is forbidden to use non‐certified material in sapling production. If uncertified materials are used, the saplings produced with these materials cannot be certified, and they are destroyed, and the producer is penalised by the Ministry (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nThe mother plants are approximately 10 years old, but they can be used up to an age of 25 years in accordance with the Phytosanitary Standards Instruction in Fruit and Vine Saplings and Propagation Materials. Plants used for seed production are mostly 20–25 years old (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\n3.3.3. Management of mother plants\n\nBefore establishing the mother block, soil samples are taken by the official inspector and officially analysed to confirm the absence of quarantine organisms. Phytosanitary inspections are carried out on mother plants by Ministry experts three times per year in spring, summer and autumn. Certificate and labels are issued by the MAF of Turkey and sent to the producer for the buds to be taken from the mother plants that meet the requirements of the Phytosanitary Standards Instruction. The producer either uses the certified buds in his own sapling production or sells them to another sapling producer (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nThe walnut mother plants should be at least 20 m away from other orchards or plants. If the isolation distance is sufficient, the mother plants are visually inspected for the presence of harmful organisms specified in Table and if in doubt samples are taken and analysed in the laboratory. If the isolation distance is not sufficient, samples are taken from 1/5 of the mother plants every year and analysed in the laboratory (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nMother plants that produce seeds are officially inspected in the same way as mother plants that produce buds (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nIf plants are free from the organisms specified in Table , the Ministry issues certificates and labels for the propagation materials to be taken from plants in the mother blocks (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n3.3.4. Production cycle\n\nBefore sapling production, officer takes soil samples from the parcels. The samples are analysed for nematodes by the Ministry Quarantine Agency. If it is found that the growing medium is free from nematodes, the production of saplings is started (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nBefore the rootstock planting, burnt animal manure or worm manure is applied to the growing area. In November, seeds or clonal rootstocks of J. regia are sown/planted in the sapling production parcel or growing medium. Peters brand 30.10.10 fertiliser is given by drip irrigation after the seeds germinate and the seedlings start to sprout in the spring and, if needed, spraying against thrips is done. However, no further information was provided on these treatments (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 3.1, in the production of walnut saplings, seedlings are mostly used as rootstocks. The seeds are sown in the sapling production plot in November. Rootstocks produced by tissue culture methods, which are rarely used in sapling production, are planted in the plot at the beginning of spring. Clonal rootstocks are rootstocks produced by tissue culture methods and the rate of use in total walnut sapling production is lower than 4%. Only producers authorised by the Ministry can produce rootstocks via tissue culture methods. In the propagation of rootstocks via tissue culture methods, producers transfer the shoot tips or buds taken from their mother plants to the in vitro culture. The productions made by these producers are also under the control and inspection of the Ministry. As a result of the official inspections, certificates and labels are issued by the Ministry for rootstocks that are true to type and that meet the requirements of the phytosanitary legislation. After the rootstocks are certified, they can be sold to sapling producers.\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 3.1, in the vast majority of walnut sapling production, patch bud grafting is used. Patch bud grafting is made in August–September the following year. At the time of grafting, the rootstock is 9–10 months old (the duration between sowing and grafting time). The graft wound is protected against infections by using copper solutions. Then, the graft is wrapped with grafting tape. Tools are disinfected with chemical compounds containing 10% chlorine prior to grafting. The period between patch bud grafting and the export of walnut saplings is 16 months (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nChip budding is rarely used in the production of walnut saplings and it is performed in April–May. At the time of grafting, rootstock is 5–6 months old. Grafted bud will burst in the spring following the year of grafting (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 3.1, drip irrigation system is used in almost all of the nurseries. No treatment is made to the irrigation water. During the vegetation period, irrigation is generally done every 4 days (Dossier Section 3.1).\n\nIn May, spraying against fungal diseases is made with copper products twice with an interval of 10 days. The same fertilisation as described above is repeated in June and potassium nitrate is used in fertilisation from July. Spraying is done against Empoasca spp. and red spider mite (Panonychus ulmi) 2 times from July [according to Dossier Section 3.1 using 80% sulfur (400 g/100 litres of water), which is licensed for fruit trees]. In August, potassium nitrate and, if necessary, Empoasca spp. and red spider mite spraying is continued. If there is a micro element deficiency, fertilisation is made for it. When 50% of the leaves are lost in autumn, the copper spraying is repeated. In the spring, the fertilisation and spraying schedule of the previous year is applied exactly.\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 1.0, the general rules on productions of walnut sapling/production material in Turkey are specified as follows:\n\na)\n\nThe producer must obtain a ‘Sapling Producer Certificate’ from the MAF of Turkey before starting production. Afterwards, with this certificate of authorisation, operator registration is made to the plant passport system.\n\nb)\n\nProduction, certification and marketing in Turkey are only permitted in registered varieties.\n\nc)\n\nIn the event that analysis results are determined as being clear in terms of quarantine factors (see Table ) in production area/environment, it is permitted to produce sapling and materials only in this area.\n\nd)\n\nAt the beginning of the production process, the producer applies to the Provincial Directorate of the MAF of Turkey. After official inspections conducted by the Ministry experts, an approval of ‘certificate and certification label and plant passport can be issued’ shall be made for sapling and materials that are healthy and at certain growing standards. ‘Sapling Certificate’, ‘Production Material Certificate’ and ‘Certification‐Plant Passport Label’ are issued by the Ministry only for these productions and sent to the producer.\n\ne)\n\nCertificates and labels shall not be issued for the productions to which the Ministry experts have not given an approval and marketing of them is not permitted in Turkey and abroad.\n\nf)\n\nProduction may not be permitted for a certain period in the area containing productions that are detected as having quarantine factor contamination, possible risks are prevented by making controls and analyses with survey researches at productions made in the area that is within in a certain distance from the area detected as having contamination.\n\ng)\n\nThe certification system is subject to the same conditions as the EU certification system. In this system, following the provisions of the Instruction on Plant Health in Fruit and Vine Sapling and Propagation Materials, isolation distances rule from other areas of preliminary basic, basic and certified productions in walnut species are given in Table .\n\nh)\n\nPermission is given by the Ministry to export sapling and propagation materials that are allowed to be sold in Turkey, namely having a ‘Sapling Certificate’ or ‘Production Material Certificate’ and ‘Certification‐Plant Passport Label’; in cases for which there are no certificate and label, marketing of them domestically and abroad is not permitted. If any production is performed without the stated requirements, these productions are seized and destroyed by the Ministry. This Certificate is a ‘Marketability’ certificate showing that the sapling and the material are healthy and accurate for its name and issued by the Ministry organisation DSRC (Directorate of Seed Registration and Certification) or SSTD (Sapling and Seedling Test Directorate). ‘Certificate of Origin’ and ‘Plant Health Certificate’ are also issued in the export of saplings and materials.\n\ni)\n\nFollowing the Certification Regulations, breeding No. 1 is installed with plant breeder material by variety holder that is authorised by DGOPP (Directorate General of Plant Production) or authorised organisations in variety. Preliminary basic productions are made from that breeding. Health controls are performed with macroscopic and mostly laboratory analyses in terms of factors (quarantine factors and harmful organisms affecting the quality, see Table ) subject to certification in these productions, the amount that can be certified is determined, production material certificate and certification‐plant passport label are obtained from DSRC or SSTD, then the materials can be sold domestically and abroad.\n\nj)\n\nIn the basic and certified productions, variety control is performed in breeding No. 2 and 3 by the organisation expert given authority by the Ministry, a ‘Breeding Variety Identification Report’ is issued for approved breeding ones.\n\nk)\n\nIn standard sapling production in the Certification Regulations, if production material (rootstock‐slip) is purchased, then submission of material certificate is mandatory.\n\nl)\n\nIf the producer uses the production material obtained from his own breeding in sapling production in standard class, there is no requirement for the material to have a certificate. However, this does not mean that the material has not been inspected in terms of plant health. In these cases, there is no risk from this type of sapling in terms of plant health as breeding by the producer has been inspected in terms of quarantine factors (see Table ) by inspections performed annually for plant health and by experts of Provincial/District Directorate of Agriculture in the operator production areas.\n\n3.3.5. Pest monitoring during production and official inspections\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 3.1, annual inspection on saplings and mother plants are carried out by the Ministry inspectors. If the isolation distances specified in Table are provided, inspections are done visually. If required by the Ministry, additional laboratory analyses are performed. Plants around the production areas are also annually inspected by the Ministry experts in terms of quarantine organisms. If these plants are contaminated with harmful organisms subject to quarantine, plants and saplings in this area are destroyed. According to Dossier Section 3.1, the inspections focus on the list of harmful organisms listed in Table , which also includes a description of the methods of detection of relevant pests.\n\n3.3.6. Laboratory methods of detection and identification used for different categories of pests\n\nThe Dossier Section 3.1 specifies the laboratory methods for detection and identification used for different categories of pests as follows:\n\n–\n\nFor insects and mites: visual macroscopic and microscopic analyses are conducted by the entomology experts.\n\n–\n\nFor nematodes identification: morphological diagnosis under a microscope and PCR test are used when necessary. In particular, before establishing new nurseries, soil samples are collected and analysed for the presence of Meloidogyne spp.\n\n–\n\nFor quarantine organism: there is a guideline on standard diagnostic protocols for analysing quarantine pests in Plant Health Diagnostic Laboratories under the MAF of Turkey. The protocols in this guideline have been prepared based on EPPO Standard diagnostic protocols and if there were no EPPO protocols on any of the pests concerning walnut, diagnostic protocols were prepared using IPPC or other well‐known scientific methods.\n\n–\n\nFor other pests, e.g. regulated non‐quarantine pests:\n\na)\n\nFor bacteria: generally, standard isolation process and plating on semi‐specific or general artificial medium are used (NA, YDCA, KingsB, etc.). Suspicious colonies are then selected and purified. After that biochemical, serological, biological or molecular methods (PCR, real‐time PCR) according to target pathogens are used. Finally, pathogenicity tests on the concerned hosts or on the host proposed are performed.\n\nb)\n\nFor viruses: enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods based on serology are used. In case of suspicious results or any positive results, the result is confirmed using molecular biology methods (RT‐PCR).\n\nc)\n\nFor fungi: symptoms on plants are checked visually. After that isolation procedures for fungi, morphological and microscopic identification are performed. If needed, molecular methods (PCR) for fungi are used. Pathogenicity test on host may also be performed.\n\n3.3.7. Post‐harvest processes and export procedure\n\nSaplings are removed from the soil after shedding their leaves in November – December (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1). Then the saplings are transported to the warehouses by trailers. Roots are washed in the washing areas, which are near the warehouses, cleaned from the soil and taken to the warehouses. High pressure water is not used for washing to avoid damaging the roots.\n\nRoots are sprayed with fungicides, traditionally with Thiram, although this fungicide is no longer usable (Dossier Section 3.1). No further information is provided on whether Thiram has been replaced with other fungicides. Finally, roots are wrapped in gelatine (Dossier Section 3.1). Official inspections before export are carried out by the Ministry quarantine inspector. A phytosanitary certificate is issued to the saplings if found suitable.\n\nSaplings to be exported are grouped in bundles of ten (Dossiers Sections 1.0 and 3.1). Before export, bundles are wrapped in plastic sheets and loaded into crates. After packaging, they are kept in storage at 2–4°C and 85% relative humidity until the date of export. In general, after packaging for export, the saplings are immediately loaded onto trucks immediately. Saplings are transported under conditions suitable for the buyer's request and the sales agreement. Generally, transportation is carried out in refrigerated trucks. The moisture of the loaded trailer must be between 85% and 95%. Trailers temperature must be between 2°C and 4°C.\n\nThe export takes place from November to March.\n\n4. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nThe compiled pest list (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix D) including all agents associated with J. regia and all EU quarantine pests associated with Juglans yielded 704 pests. This list also included 27 RNQPs and 3 deregulated pests that were subsequently excluded from the evaluation as indicated in Section 1.2.\n\n4.1. Selection of relevant EU‐quarantine pests associated with the commodity\n\nThe EU listing of Union quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) is based on assessments concluding that the pests can enter, establish, spread and have potential impact in the EU.\n\nTwenty‐six EU‐quarantine pests that are reported to use J. regia or Juglans as a host plant were evaluated (Table ) for their relevance of being included in this Opinion.\n\nTable 5\n\nNPest name according to EU legislationa EPPO codeGroupPest present in Turkey Juglans regia/Juglans confirmed as a host (reference)Pest can be associated with commodityb Pest relevant for the Opinion1 Anastrepha fraterculus ANSTFRInsectsNoYes(CABI, online)Not evaluatedNo2 Anastrepha ludens ANSTLUInsectsNoYes(EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo3 Anoplophora chinensis ANOLCNInsectsYesYes, as Juglans (EPPO, online)YesYes4 Aromia bungii AROMBUInsectsNoYes(CABI, online; EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo5 Bactrocera tryoni DACUTRInsectsNoYes(CABI, online)Not evaluatedNo6 Cnestus mutilates as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanXYLSMUInsectsNoYes, as Juglans nigra (EPPO, 2020)Not evaluatedNo7 Euwallacea fornicatus as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanEUWAWH, EUWAKUInsectsNoYes, as Juglans (EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo8 Euwallacea validus as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanXYLBVAInsectsNoYes, as Juglans (EPPO, 2020)Not evaluatedNo9 Geosmithia morbida GEOHMOFungiNoYes(CABI, online; EPPO, online; Farr and Rossman, online)Not evaluatedNo10 Gymnosporangium libocedri as Gymnosporangium spp.GYMNLIFungiNoYes, as Juglans (Farr and Rossman, online)Not evaluatedNo11 Hypothenemus erectus as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanHYOTERInsectsNoYes (Wen‐tian, 2001)Not evaluatedNo12 Lopholeucaspis japonica LOPLJAInsectsYesYes(García Morales et al., online)YesYes13 Monarthrum mali as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanMNTHMAInsectsNoYes(EPPO, 2020)Not evaluatedNo14 Oemona hirta OEMOHIInsectsNoYes, as Juglans (EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo15 Phymatotrichopsis omnivora (synonyms: Phymatotrichum omnivorum)PHMPOMFungiNoYes(CABI, online; Farr and Rossman, online)Not evaluatedNo16 Pityophthorus juglandis PITOJUInsectsNoYes(CABI, online; EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo17 Popillia japonica POPIJAInsectsNoYes, as Juglans (EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo18 Rhagoletis suavis RHAGSUInsectsNoYes(EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo19 Scolytus nitidus as Scolytidae non‐European–InsectsNoYes(Sharma et al., 2012)Not evaluatedNo20 Spodoptera frugiperda LAPHFRInsectsNoYes(EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo21 Thaumatotibia leucotreta ARGPLEInsectsNoYes(EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo22 Thaumetopoea processionea THAUPRInsectsYesYes(Robinson et al., online)Noc No23 Xiphinema americanum sensu stricto XIPHAANematodesNoYes(CABI, online)Not evaluatedNo24 Xiphinema rivesi (non‐EU populations)XIPHRINematodesNoYes, as Juglans (Ferris, online)Not evaluatedNo25 Xyleborinus artestriatus as Scolytidae non‐EuropeanXYBIARInsectsNoYes(EPPO, 2020)Not evaluatedNo26 Xylella fastidiosa XYLEFABacteriaNoYes(EPPO, online)Not evaluatedNo\n\nThe relevance of an EU‐quarantine pest for this Opinion was based on evidence that:\n\nthe pest is present in Turkey;\n\nJuglans regia or other species in the genus Juglans are hosts of the pest;\n\none or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity.\n\nPests that fulfilled all three criteria were selected for further evaluation.\n\nOf the 26 EU quarantine pests evaluated, two pests (i.e. Anoplophora chinensis and Lopholeucaspis japonica), present in Turkey and known to be associated with the commodity were selected for further evaluation (see Table ).\n\nTable 6\n\nNCurrent scientific nameEPPO codeName used in the EU legislationTaxonomic informationGroupRegulatory status1 Anoplophora chinensis ANOLCN Anoplophora chinensis Coleoptera\n\nCerambycidaeInsectsEU Quarantine Pest according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/20722 Garella musculana ERSHMU–Lepidoptera\n\nNolidaeInsectsNot quarantine in the EU3 Euzophera semifuneralis EUZOSE–Lepidoptera\n\nPyralidaeInsectsNot quarantine in the EU4 Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae ––Botryosphaeriales\n\nBotryosphaeriaceaeFungiNot quarantine in the EU5 Lopholeucaspis japonica LOPLJA Lopholeucaspis japonica Hemiptera\n\nDiaspididaeInsectsEU Quarantine Pest according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072\n\n4.2. Selection of other relevant pests (not regulated in the EU) associated with the commodity\n\nThe information provided by MAF of Turkey, integrated with the search performed by EFSA, was evaluated to assess whether there are other potentially relevant pests of J. regia present in the country of export. For these potential pests not regulated in the EU, pest risk assessment information on the probability of introduction, establishment, spread and impact is usually lacking. Therefore, these pests that are potentially associated with J. regia were also evaluated to determine their relevance for this Opinion based on evidence that:\n\nthe pest is present in Turkey;\n\nthe pest is (i) absent or (ii) has a limited distribution in the EU and either official phytosanitary measures are in place in at least of one EU MS or there is evidence of a recent introduction of the pest;\n\nJuglans regia is a host of the pest;\n\none or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity;\n\nthe pest may have an impact in the EU.\n\nPests that fulfilled all five criteria were selected for further evaluation.\n\nBased on the information collected, 678 potential pests not regulated in the EU, known to be associated with J. regia were evaluated for their relevance to this Opinion. Pests were excluded from further evaluation when at least one condition listed above (1–5) was not met. Details can be found in the Appendix D (Microsoft Excel® file). Of the evaluated pests not regulated in the EU, two insects (i.e. Garella musculana and Euzophera semifuneralis) and one fungus (Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae) were selected for further evaluation because they met all of the selection criteria. More information on these three pests can be found in the pest datasheets (Appendix A).\n\n4.3. Overview of interceptions\n\nData on the interception of harmful organisms on plants of J. regia can provide information on some of the organisms that can be present on J. regia despite the measures taken.\n\nAccording to EUROPHYT online (accessed on 1 September 2020) and TRACES‐NT online (accessed on 5 February 2021), there were no interceptions of plants for planting of J. regia from Turkey destinated to the EU Member States due to the presence of harmful organisms between 1995 and January 2021.\n\nThe walnut saplings planned to be exported to the EU in 2020 were 2,250,000 pieces.\n\n4.4. List of potential pests not further assessed\n\nFrom the list of pests not selected for further evaluation, the Panel highlighted seven pests (see Appendix C) for which there was uncertainty about at least one criterium to select them for further evaluation. The detailed reason is provided in Appendix C for each species.\n\n4.5. Summary of pests selected for further evaluation\n\nFive pests reported to be present in Turkey while having potential for association with the commodity destined for export to the EU are listed in Table . The effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures proposed for the commodity by Turkey was evaluated for these selected pests.\n\n5. Risk mitigation measures\n\nFor each of the selected pests (see Table ), the Panel assessed the possibility that it could be present in the exporting nurseries and assessed the probability that pest freedom is achieved by the proposed risk mitigation measures.\n\nThe information used in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures is summarised in a pest data sheet (see Appendix A).\n\n5.1. Possibility of pest presence in the export nurseries\n\nFor each relevant pest, the Panel evaluated the likelihood that the pest could be present in the export nurseries by assessing the possibility that J. regia saplings are infested either by:\n\nintroduction of the pest (e.g. insects, spores) from the environment surrounding the nursery,\n\nintroduction of the pest with new plants/seeds,\n\nspread of the pest within the nursery.\n\n5.2. Risk mitigation measures proposed by MAF of Turkey\n\nWith the information provided by the MAF of Turkey (Dossier Sections 1.0, 3.1 and 3.5), the Panel summarised the risk mitigation measures (see Table ) proposed by MAF of Turkey for J. regia plants designated for export to the EU.\n\nTable 7\n\nNumberRisk mitigation measureImplementation in Turkey1Registration of the nursery and Phytosanitary managementAll nurseries producing J. regia plants for planting are required to respect the ‘Regulation on the plant passport system and registration of operators’, ‘Regulation on the certification and marketing of young fruit plants and propagation materials’ and ‘Instructions on plants health in fruit and vine saplings and propagation material’, where the phytosanitary standards for fruit saplings and propagation materials are described (Dossier Section 3.5).2Physical isolationThe production areas are surrounded by wire or stone wall or left empty (Dossier Section 3.1).3Soil analyses Target pest species: Xiphinema diversicaudatum.\n\nTiming of the treatment: Spring or autumn one time before planting\n\nSpecification for Xiphinema diversicaudatum: Before the nursery is established, soil analysis is done in terms of X. diversicaudatum in vine almond, plum, apricot, cherry, cherry peach and olive fields.\n\nSoil analysis: Analysis is done in the spring or autumn once before planting, if the soil analysis and harvesting from the area to be produced is not in place, then analysis is done at maximum of every 4 years.\n\nTarget species: Meloidogyne spp.: In particular before establishing new nurseries, soil samples are collected and analysed for the presence of Meloidogyne spp. (Root Knot Nematodes). Soil samples are taken from the lands where nurseries will be established. Sampling is performed by using a soil probe up to 10–30 cm deep. Sub‐samples taken from 60 different points representing 1 ha of area are mixed and one single sample is taken from this mixture and the final sample is formed. One sample contains 1 kg of soil. The sample coming to the laboratory is mixed homogenously in the laboratory and 200 cm3 of soil is taken and analysed. With regard to the extraction method in the quarantine laboratories and nematology laboratories in research institutes, a combination of methods has been used. All laboratories use the same methods found in EPPO diagnostic protocols (PM 7/119) and a modified Baermann Funnel Method is used in soil analysis (EPPO, 2013) (Dossier Section 3.1).4Cleaning and disinfection of facilities, tools and machinery Target pest species: Anoplophora chinensis, Epidiaspis leperii, Pseudaulacaspis pentagona, Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana and Quadraspidiotus perniciosus\n\nTiming of the treatment: Not provided\n\nSpecification: Roguing and pruning tools and equipment should be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite.5Roguing and Pruning Target pest species: Anoplophora chinensis, Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana and Quadraspidiotus perniciosus.\n\nTiming of the treatment: All year\n\nSpecification for Anoplophora chinensis : All the trees infested with the pest were marked and cut into chips and then destroyed by burning. Various trees species such as maple, willow, poplar were destroyed within the scope of eradication work. In the period between May and October, when the adults of the pest are active, trees with adult emergence are marked. In the period from November to March when the pest is inactive, trees previously marked are cut down. The root parts of the trees with dishes were destroyed.\n\nSpecification for Quadraspidiotus perniciosus :\n\n– Soil cultivation, irrigation, fertilisation, pruning and other cultural measures should be done in a timely and duly manner in orchards contaminated with San‐Jose scale.\n\n– Fruit trees that are heavily contaminated with San Jose scale should be pruned shortly before the buds awaken, and the leftovers from pruning should be put away from the orchard for parasitoid emergence.\n\nWhile establishing an orchard, certified and clean saplings should be used.\n\nSticks taken from infested trees should not be used as support for healthy trees.\n\nBud eye and scions should not be taken from contaminated trees.\n\nIf other host plants are contaminated with pests at the edge of the garden, it should be sprayed.\n\nInfested fruits should be destroyed.\n\n6Biological control and behavioural manipulation Target pest species: Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana, Epidiaspis leperii, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus and Pseudaulacaspis pentagona.\n\nTiming of the treatment: April to September\n\nSpecification for Epidiaspis leperii (Sign.):\n\nPredators:\n\nChilocorus bipustulatus L.

(Acarina: Hemisarcoptidae)\n\nNatural enemies of mulberry scale alone cannot control the pest. The efficiency rates of parasitoids are 2–40% depending on the regions.\n\nIn order to protect natural enemies and increase their effectiveness, alternative methods to chemical control should be prioritised to control other pests, if chemical control is required, plant protection products with the least side effects against natural enemies should be preferred. Encarsia berlesei may be reared and released.\n\nSpecification for Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana :\n\nThe natural enemies of E. musculana may play an important role in regulation of its populations. 16 species belonging to Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Pteromalidae, Torymidae, Trichogrammatidae, Carabidae, Raphidiidae and Formicidae are recorded as either parasitoids or predators of the pest. The most frequent of these are Trichogramma sp. and Pimpla instigator. Sometimes, caterpillars are infected by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis or the fungus Beauveria bassiana.\n\nSpecification for Pseudaulacaspis pentagona :\n\nBiological control method by releasing of Encarsia berlesei is effective. Parasitoids and predators are effective enough.7Physical treatments on consignments or during processing Target pest species: Quadraspidiotus perniciosus and Pseudaulacaspis pentagona.\n\nTiming of the treatment: All year\n\nSpecification for Pseudaulacaspis pentagona :\n\nPseudaulacaspis pentagona Mulberry scale is easily visible on trees in winter with the naked eye. Good cleaning can be done using hard brushes during pruning. However, care should be given not to damage the buds. Especially in small gardens, first of all, mechanical control (cleaning) should be applied.\n\nSpecification for Quadraspidiotus perniciosus :\n\n– Tillage, irrigation, fertilisation, pruning and other cultural measures are done in a timely and duly manner in orchards infested with San Jose scale.\n\n– Fruit trees heavily contaminated with San Jose scale are pruned short before buds wake up, the left branches from pruning are removed from the orchard after the parasitoid emergence.\n\n– While establishing an orchard, certified and clean saplings are used.\n\n– Infested fruits are destroyed.8Pest surveillance and monitoring during production and official inspectionsAccording to Dossier Section 3.1 annual inspection on saplings and mother plants are carried out by the Ministry inspectors. If the isolation distances specified in Table are provided, inspections are done visually. If required by the Ministry additional laboratory analyses are performed. Plants around the production areas are also annually inspected by the Ministry expert in terms of quarantine organisms. If these plants are contaminated with harmful organisms subject to quarantine, these plants and saplings in this area are destroyed.\n\nSpecification for the surveillance of target pest species:\n\nTiming: April to October\n\nAnoplophora chinensis and Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana are included in the official surveillance programme of the Ministry.\n\nSpecification for inspection and trapping of target pest species:\n\nTiming: All year\n\nSpecification for Anoplophora chinensis:\n\nIn places where the pest's presence is unknown, surveys should be carried out at least once a year, at any time of the year. September – October months can be preferred. During the surveys, pupae are expected to be seen in April – May, young larvae in June – July and mature larvae in September – October.\n\nPlants that host this insect are examined by visual inspection method. This insect is difficult to detect on plants. However, if the larvae cause severe damage to the plants, it may be noticed. The presence of the pest can be detected more easily by seeing the exit holes formed by the adults exiting the tree trunk after they are mature or by the adults. Adult exit holes can be 10 – 15 mm in diameter. The appearance of feeding signs and sawdust residues in the shoots of the larvae may indicate the presence of the pest. If in doubt, a branch of the tree on the ground or below is cut and the galleries formed by the larvae are viewed. If the larva is present, a sample is taken and sent for diagnosis.\n\nSpecification for Erschoviella musculana/Garella musculana:\n\nFor the early count, a total of 100 shoots from at least 10 trees selected randomly in the garden of 100 trees, 10 shoots each, are checked by eye examination method. If there are more than 100 trees or saplings in the garden, the same process is repeated for each additional 100 trees/saplings. If there is no larva infestation in the early period or if it cannot be detected, the fruit contamination should be checked. For fruit count, a total of 100 fruits are visually inspected in a garden of 100 trees from at least 10 trees chosen by chance and 10 fruits from different directions and heights. Since tree yellow worm and fruit damage can also be confused with apple jerky worm damage, if in doubt, shoot and fruit samples should be taken and sent to the relevant Institute for diagnosis. Newly established nurseries and gardens with seedlings and trees grafted with foreign varieties should be examined. In new shoots, it should be checked if there is an opened gallery, especially in the parts where the petiole is located. Corrugated cardboard should be used as a trap tape against the larvae of the pest. The pupae of the pest that have gathered under the shell should be checked. Spilled fruits and pruning residues should be examined. Especially by transplanting plants, scions and pruning residual branches, pests can be transmitted to new areas. For this reason, especially the scions consisting of foreign varieties should be examined carefully.9Weed managementWeeds are controlled by mechanical means once a month from March to September–October (Dossier Section 3.1).10Chemical treatments during productionIn May, spraying against fungal diseases is carried out with copper products twice with an interval of 10 days.\n\nSpraying is carried out against Empoasca spp. and red spider mite twice from July using 80% sulfur (400 g/100 litres of water), which is licensed for fruit trees.\n\nIf needed, spraying against thrips is carried out.\n\nThe graft wound is protected against infections using copper solutions.11Washing the rootsBefore exporting, the roots of the saplings are washed so that no soil remains. High pressure water is not used for washing to avoid damaging the roots.12Official inspections before exportOfficial inspections before export are carried out by the Ministry quarantine inspector. A phytosanitary certificate is issued for saplings found suitable (Dossier Section 1.0).13Chemical treatments before exportBefore loading, the roots of seedlings are sprayed with fungicide (Dossier Section 1.0). According to Dossier Section 3.1, in Turkey since 31 July 2020 Thiram is no longer used. No further information is provided in the Dossier on whether Thiram has been replaced with other fungicides.\n\nThe descriptions of the risk mitigation measures in Table are fully consistent with the original wording used in the Dossier. The target species in the table are those indicated in the Dossier Sections 1.0, 3.1 and 3.5. While most of the target species are not relevant, the Panel assessed the risk mitigation measures described in the table with reference to the pests retained for further evaluation in this Opinion in the Appendix A.\n\nWith regard to the risk mitigation measure No 6 the Panel noted that some parts were taken from EPPO (2005).\n\n5.3. Evaluation of the current measures for the selected relevant pests including uncertainties\n\nThe relevant risk mitigation measures acting on the selected pests were identified. Any limiting factors on the effectiveness of the measures were documented.\n\nAll the relevant information including the related uncertainties deriving from the limiting factors used in the evaluation are summarised in a pest datasheet provided in Appendix A. Based on this information, for each relevant pest, an expert judgement is given for the likelihood of pest freedom of commodity taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest and their combination.\n\nAn overview of the evaluation of each relevant pest is given in the sections below (Sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.3.5). The outcome of EKE on pest freedom after the evaluation of the proposed risk mitigation measures is summarised in Section 5.3.6.\n\nThe explanation of pest freedom categories used to rate the likelihood of pest freedom in Sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.3.5 is shown in Table .\n\nTable 8\n\nPest freedom categoryPest free plants out of 10,000Sometimes pest free< 5,000More often than not pest free5,000 to – < 9,000Frequently pest free9,000 to – < 9,500Very frequently pest free9,500 to – < 9,900Extremely frequently pest free9,900 to – < 9,950Pest free with some exceptional cases9,950 to – < 9,990Pest free with few exceptional cases9,990 to – < 9,995Almost always pest free9,995 to – 10,000\n\n5.3.1.

Anoplophora chinensis is reported to be ‘transient and under eradication’ in Turkey. In İstanbul, A. chinensis was detected first in 2014 in nurseries producing ornamental plants. Anoplophora chinensis was detected in İstanbul mostly in public parks, home gardens and recreation areas, which are all environments rich in potential host trees. Both males and females can fly up to 2 km. Juglans regia is a host of A. chinensis, although it is not listed as a preferred host. As walnut saplings intended to be exported to the EU are produced in 36 provinces including İstanbul, it cannot be excluded that populations of A. chinensis are present in the neighbouring environment of export nurseries. Plants are grown in open fields and adult A. chinensis can enter from the surrounding environment. Oviposition occurs in the bark in the lower part of the stems with diameter larger than 1 cm making the commodity a pathway.\n\nMeasures taken against the pest and their efficacy\n\nThe relevant applied measures are: (i) regular inspections in the nurseries (at least 1 inspection per year); (ii) export inspections; (iii) surveillance at national level. Eradication (Roguing) is also performed.\n\nInterception records\n\nIn the EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT database, there are no records of notification of J. regia plants for planting neither from Turkey nor from other countries due to presence of A. chinensis between the years 1995 and January 2021 (EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT, online).\n\nShortcomings of current measures/procedures\n\nEradication through roguing is unlikely to involve asymptomatic plants. Therefore, the measure will not be fully effective. There is no clear indication of other risk mitigation measures in place in the exporting nurseries and surrounding environments, effective against A. chinensis.\n\nMain uncertainties\n\nThe pest prevalence in the surrounding environment is unknown.\n\nIn general, the information provided was either poorly detailed or not specifically adapted to nurseries.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether the risk mitigation measures indicated by Turkey are mandatory or only general recommendations.\n\n5.3.2. Overview of the evaluation of Garella musculana\n\nOverview of the evaluation of Garella musculana for grafted bare rooted plants Rating of the likelihood of pest freedom Extremely frequently pest free (based on the Median).

Garella musculana is reported to be introduced in Turkey in the Bartın area, where it is abundant in walnut orchards. The pest can fly, and as walnut saplings intended to be exported to the EU are produced in areas close to Bartın it cannot be excluded that populations of G. musculana could enter the export nurseries. Oviposition occurs on the shoots and the larva is a shoot miner while the pupa is formed on the bark making the commodity a pathway.\n\nMeasures taken against the pest and their efficacy\n\nThe relevant applied measures are: (i) regular inspections in the nurseries (at least 1 inspection per year); (ii) export inspections; (iii) surveillance at national level. Roguing is also performed.\n\nInterception records\n\nIn the EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT database there are no records of notification of J. regia plants for planting neither from Turkey nor from other countries due to presence of G. musculana between the years 1995 and January 2021 (EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT, online).\n\nShortcomings of current measures/procedures\n\nRoguing is unlikely to be applied on recently infested plants. Therefore, the measure will not be fully effective. Except for biological control there is no clear indication of other risk mitigation measures in place in the exporting nurseries and surrounding environments, effective against G. musculana. The biological control strategy is superficially described hampering a thorough assessment.\n\nMain uncertainties\n\nAs long as the walnut is the main host of the pest, there is an uncertainty on the frequency of walnut orchards in the surrounding environments.\n\nIn general, the information provided was either poorly detailed or not specifically adapted to nurseries.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether the risk mitigation measures indicated by Turkey are mandatory or only general recommendations.\n\n5.3.3.

The pest is reported from the provinces of Adana and Osmaniye on pomegranate. Due to its polyphagous nature the pest can be present in the surrounding environment of the nurseries, especially if pomegranate is present. Plants are grown in the open field. The pest can enter the production fields by flying. Juglans regia is reported as host. Euzophera semifuneralis overwinters as mature larva in a typical white silken cocoon under the bark. Young trees and saplings may also be infested.\n\nMeasures taken against the pest and their efficacy\n\nThe relevant applied measures are: (i) regular inspections in the nurseries (at least 1 inspection per year); (ii) export inspections.\n\nInterception records\n\nIn the EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT database, there are no records of notification of J. regia plants for planting neither from Turkey nor from other countries due to presence of E. semifuneralis between the years 1995 and January 2021 (EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT, online).\n\nShortcomings of current measures/procedures\n\nThere is no clear indication of a pesticides scheme or any other risk mitigation measure in place in the exporting nurseries and surroundings, effective against E. semifuneralis on J. regia.\n\nMain uncertainties\n\nThe presence of the pest in the surrounding environment of the nurseries is uncertain.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether the risk mitigation measures indicated by Turkey are mandatory or only general recommendations.\n\n5.3.4.

The pathogen normally enters the plant through wounds (usually by pruning) which is the main way of spreading, although as for other fungi in the family Botryophaeriaceae endophytic stages are also reported. While pycnidia are produced on diseased plant tissues, conidia are spread by wind, rain or insects. Pathogen inoculum could also be spread by contaminated pruning and grafting tools. The presence of host species in the environment of the nurseries is an important factor for the possible migration of inoculum into the nursery. The pathogen overwinters in diseased twigs or in plant debris in the soil. Juglans regia is a host and plants for planting are pathway.\n\nMeasures taken against the pest and their efficacy\n\nThe relevant applied measures are: i) regular inspections in the nurseries (at least 1 inspection per year); ii) export inspections.\n\nInterception records\n\nIn the EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT database, there are no records of notification of J. regia plants for planting neither from Turkey nor from other countries due to presence of L. pseudotheobromae between the years 2008 (year of description of the fungus) and January 2021 (EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT, online).\n\nShortcomings of current measures/procedures\n\nDue to the potential dormant phase, the visual inspection is insufficient. There is no clear indication of a pesticides scheme or any other risk mitigation measure in place in the exporting nurseries and surroundings, effective against L. pseudotheobromae.\n\nMain uncertainties\n\nThe presence of the pathogen and suitable hosts in the surroundings of the nurseries is uncertain. The infection potential of the fungus in its endophytic stage is not known.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether the risk mitigation measures indicated by Turkey are mandatory or only general recommendations.\n\n5.3.5.

Juglans regia has been reported as host of L. japonica. Lopholeucaspis japonica is present in the Black Sea region of Turkey where some of the nurseries producing J. regia are located. Due to its polyphagous nature, the pest can be present in the surrounding environment of the nurseries. Plants are grown in the open field. The pest can enter the production fields as crawlers either with air currents or transported accidentally by human activities or hitchhiking on animals. Females adhere to the bark of trees including plants for planting.\n\nMeasures taken against the pest and their efficacy\n\nThe relevant applied measures are: (i) regular inspections in the nurseries (at least 1 inspection per year); (ii) export inspections.\n\nInterception records\n\nIn the EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT database, there are no records of notification of J. regia plants for planting neither from Turkey nor from other countries due to presence of L. japonica between the years 1995 and January 2021 (EUROPHYT/TRACES‐NT, online).\n\nShortcomings of current measures/procedures\n\nThere is no clear indication of a pesticides scheme or any other risk mitigation measure in place in the exporting nurseries and surroundings, effective against L. japonica on J. regia.\n\nMain uncertainties\n\nThe presence of the pest in the surrounding environment of the nurseries is uncertain.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether the risk mitigation measures indicated by Turkey are mandatory or only general recommendations.\n\n5.3.6.

Conclusions\n\nThere are five pests relevant for this Opinion that are associated with grafted bare rooted plants of Juglans regia: Anoplophora chinensis, Garella musculana, Euzophera semifuneralis, Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae and Lopholeucaspis japonica.\n\nFor these pests, the likelihood of the pest freedom after the evaluation of the proposed risk mitigation measures relevant for the commodity of J. regia designated for export to the EU was estimated.\n\nFor Anoplophora chinensis, the likelihood of pest freedom for grafted bare rooted plants following evaluation of proposed risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘extremely frequently pest free’ to ‘almost always pest free’. The EKE indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,907 and 10,000 plants per 10,000 will be free from A. chinensis.\n\nFor Garella musculana, the likelihood of pest freedom for grafted bare rooted plants following evaluation of proposed risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘extremely frequently pest free’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘very frequently pest free’ to ‘pest free with few exceptional cases’. The EKE indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,817 and 10,000 plants per 10,000 will be free from G. musculana.\n\nFor Euzophera semifuneralis, the likelihood of pest freedom for grafted bare rooted plants following evaluation of proposed risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘extremely frequently pest free’ to ‘almost always pest free’. The EKE indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,916 and 10,000 plants per 10,000 will be free from E. semifuneralis.\n\nFor Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, the likelihood of pest freedom for grafted bare rooted plants following evaluation of proposed risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘very frequently pest free’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘very frequently pest free’ to ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’. The EKE indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,554 and 10,000 plants per 10,000 will be free from L. pseudotheobromae.\n\nFor Lopholeucaspis japonica, the likelihood of pest freedom for grafted bare rooted plants following evaluation of proposed risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘extremely frequently pest free’ to ‘almost always pest free’. The EKE indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,908 and 10,000 plants per 10,000 will be free from L. japonica.\n\nGlossary\n\nControl (of a pest)\n\nSuppression, containment or eradication of a pest population (FAO, 1995, 2017).\n\nEntry (of a pest)\n\nMovement of a pest into an area where it is not yet present, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled (FAO, 2017).\n\nEstablishment (of a pest)\n\nPerpetuation, for the foreseeable future, of a pest within an area after entry (FAO, 2017).\n\nImpact (of a pest)\n\nThe impact of the pest on the crop output and quality and on the environment in the occupied spatial units.\n\nIntroduction (of a pest)\n\nThe entry of a pest resulting in its establishment (FAO, 2017).\n\nMeasures\n\nControl (of a pest) is defined in ISPM 5 (FAO 2017) as ‘Suppression, containment or eradication of a pest population’ (FAO, 1995).

PRA information Pest Risk Assessments available:\n\n– Pest risk analysis, Anoplophora chinensis (van der Gaag et al., 2008),\n\n– Scientific Opinion on the commodity risk assessment of Robinia pseudoacacia plants from Turkey (EFSA PLH Panel, 2021). Other relevant information for the assessment Biology Anoplophora chinensis is a longhorn beetle native to China, Japan and Korea (CABI, online).\n\nAnoplophora chinensis life history includes four stages: egg, larvae of various instars, pupae and adults.\n\nOviposition occurs at the base of the trunk or on emerging roots, whereas the eggs are laid rarely on higher parts of trunks and main branches (van der Gaag et al., 2010).\n\nAccording to temperature, larvae hatch about 10 days after oviposition. First and second instar larvae feed in the phloem and later deeply into the wood. The minimum diameter of the branches/trunks to become suitable for infestation and larval development is 1 cm (EPPO, 2013). Larvae develop deeply downwards in the trunk of the host tress and many also reach the roots (Hérard et al., 2005), where about 90% of the population can be found (Hérard et al., 2006). Both in the native countries (Adachi, 1994) and in southern Europe (Hérard and Maspero, 2019), larvae need 1 or 2 years to complete their development. In colder regions, however, A. chinensis has a longer life cycle (van der Gaag et al., 2008).\n\nPupation occurs in late spring – summer inside the wood, usually in the upper part of the feeding areas of larvae (CABI, online).\n\nAfter metamorphosis, adults’ emergence occurs between April and September, in relation to latitude and local temperature, and they may survive from 30 (recorded in China) to 70 days (recorded in Japan) (CABI, online). Adults emerge through circular holes with a mean diameter of 10–15 mm, usually smaller in males than in females, and located about 25 cm below the oviposition site (Haack et al., 2010).\n\nAfter emergence and before copulation, tender adults need a maturation feeding carried out for about 10–15 days on twigs and leaf petioles (Haack et al., 2010). However, adults continue nutritional feeding for their whole life, making the egg laying homogenously distributed over spring and summer (Haack et al., 2010).\n\nReached sexual maturation, both males and females mate polygamously. Mating occurs in summer (from May to August) on trunks and main branches, usually at least 60 cm from the trunk collar (CABI, online).\n\nAnoplophora chinensis spread capacity is reported to be low, and the distance covered naturally by adults falls generally within a few hundred metres from the tree from which they emerged (Adachi, 1990). Most adults are assumed to disperse by walking and remain near their natal tree unless conditions are unfavourable, although some adults were shown to be able to travel distances of 2 km (Adachi, 1990). In Lombardy, Italy, the maximum distances between infestations in urban and agricultural areas were calculated to be about 500 and 663 m, respectively (Cavagna et al., 2013). However, 97.0% and 99.2% of new cases were found within 200 and 400 m, respectively (Cavagna et al., 2013). EFSA (2019) estimated the maximum distance of natural spread in one year to be approximately 194 m (with a 95% uncertainty range of 42–904 m), for a population with a 2‐ year life cycle.\n\nConcerning the human‐assisted spread, the main pathway for A. chinensis dispersal was identified in the international trade of woody plants for planting (including bonsai), with a stem or root diameter > 1 cm, which are infested in the nurseries during the production process (Haack et al., 2010; EPPO, 2013; CABI, online). Larvae of A. chinensis were intercepted also in wood packaging material (WPM) arriving from Asia, although this is a less common pathway of dispersal (Haack et al., 2010; Hérard and Maspero, 2019).\n\nSymptoms Main type of symptoms Most symptoms caused by A. chinensis are mainly due to the feeding activities of the larvae within the wood, although a few characteristic symptoms are produced also by adults during maturation feeding and oviposition. Detailed descriptions of A. chinensis symptoms specific on Juglans regia are not available in literature. Nevertheless, symptoms induced by A. chinensis colonisation are similar in most hosts (CABI, online).\n\nThe main symptoms caused by newly emerged adults on plants are foliage wilting and discoloration, twig deformation and bark erosion (EFSA, 2019). Females engrave into the bark characteristic ‘T shape’ oviposition pitches, which is a very characteristic symptom of tree colonisation by A. chinensis (Hérard and Maspero, 2019). Furthermore, in the first weeks after the oviposition it is possible to observe the sap coming out from the freshly cut slits (EPPO, 2016).\n\nThe main symptoms caused by feeding larvae are gradual and progressive canopy decline, desiccation of the main branches due to the larval tunneling activity concentrated at the lower part of the stem (EFSA, 2019), galleries under the bark, frass at the base of the tree and exit holes (Hérard and Maspero, 2019; CABI, online). The exit holes are large, circular, with an average diameter of about 10–15 mm, smaller for males and larger for females (Haack et al., 2010). They can be seen mainly around the lower trunk, on emerging roots, or below‐ground level (EFSA 2019; CABI, online). Presence of asymptomatic plants Although there is no specific report of asymptomatic infested plants, introductions that occurred in the past through plants for planting may support that early infestation associated with little symptoms could be present and go undetected. Confusion with other pests Crown wilting, stem discoloration and branch desiccation are non‐specific symptoms of infestation, common to many wood‐boring beetles (Haack et al., 2010).\n\nSymptoms produced by A. chinensis (frass emission, emerging holes, maturation feeding) may be confused with those of other longhorn beetles of similar size, especially for the species belonging to the same subfamily Lamiinae such as other Anoplophora species (Pennacchio et al., 2012).\n\nPosition and size of the emerging holes may help in distinguish those of A. chinensis (larger and located on the lower part of the trunk) from those of other Lamiinae species (Topakci et al., 2017).\n\nHost plant range Anoplophora chinensis is a polyphagous pest and can infest plants of more than 108 host species, from 73 genera in 20 families (Sjöman et al., 2014), many of them widespread in the EU (EFSA, 2019; EPPO, online_d).\n\nJuglans regia is also reported as a host of A. chinensis (Ge et al., 2014).\n\nSpecifically, A. chinensis has been found to complete its life cycle on species belonging to the genera (in alphabetical order): Acer spp., Aesculus spp., Alnus spp., Betula spp., Carpinus spp., Citrus spp., Cornus spp., Corylus spp., Cotoneaster spp., Crataegus spp., Fagus spp., Juglans spp., Lagerstroemia spp., Liquidambar spp., Malus spp., Platanus spp., Populus spp., Prunus spp., Pyrus spp., Quercus spp., Rhododendron spp., Rosa spp., Salix spp., Sorbus spp. and Ulmus spp. (Haack et al., 2010).\n\nIn Turkey, A. chinensis has been recorded on Acer sp., Salix caprea, Fagus orientalis, Aesculus hippocastanum, Platanus orientalis, Populus nigra, Salix babylonica and Lagerstromia indica (Dossier Section 3.1). Reported evidence of impact Anoplophora chinensis is listed as EU Quarantine pest (Annex II, Part B of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072). Pathways and evidence that the commodity is a pathway Plants for planting: The main pathway for the A. chinensis dispersal was identified in the international trade of woody host plants for planting (including bonsai) with a stem or root diameter > 1 cm (Haack et al., 2010; EPPO, 2013; CABI, online).\n\nLarva of A. chinensis was intercepted in 2015 in the Netherlands and wood packaging material imported from Asia (Hérard and Maspero, 2019). Haack et al. (2010) also reported interceptions of a few A. chinensis larvae extracted from wood packaging materials. Surveillance information Anoplophora chinensis is recorded in the Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.1 as pest occurring in Turkey and reported in the list of pests potentially associated with walnut plants for planting in Turkey.\n\nAnoplophora chinensis is included in the official surveillance programme of the Ministry and it is under the national survey and monitoring programme in the last 5 years. Survey instruction was prepared, and control and eradication measures were applied in İstanbul, Antalya and Ba"
