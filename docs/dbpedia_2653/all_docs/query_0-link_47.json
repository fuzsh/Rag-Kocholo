However, when attempting to formulate ciprofloxacin, particularly when formulating it as an emulsifiable concentrate, one can encounter difficulties because the only thing that the formulation has on storage is poor stability. It has been shown that dicyclopropyl ester may be partially decomposed.\n\nCypermethrin is another known insecticide. Cypermethrin can also degrade or decompose during storage.\n\nIn order to be able to store and use both propiconazole and cypermethrin together in one formulation, there is a need for formulations in which both classes of compounds are stable.\n\nThis object has been achieved by a formulation comprising:\n\na) the two-propylene-cycle worm ester is prepared,\n\nb) cypermethrin, such as alpha-cypermethrin,\n\nc) at least one organic solvent S, at least one organic solvent,\n\nd) at least one alkanol-substituted amine D,\n\ne) at least one alkylarylsulfonic acid E or a salt thereof,\n\nf) at least one organic tricarboxylic acid F or a salt thereof,\n\ng) at least one nonionic surfactant G which is different from the components c) to f) and h),\n\nh) optionally additional components.\n\nPreferably, the formulation of the invention comprises:\n\na) the two-propylene-cycle worm ester is prepared,\n\nb) cypermethrin, such as alpha-cypermethrin,\n\nc) at least one organic solvent S, at least one organic solvent,\n\nd) at least one alkanol-substituted tertiary amine D,\n\ne) at least one alkylarylsulfonic acid E or a salt thereof,\n\nf) at least one organic tricarboxylic acid F or a salt thereof,\n\ng) at least one nonionic surfactant G which is different from the components c) to f) and h),\n\nh) optionally additional components.\n\nThe amount of dicyloproxyfen contained in the preparation of the present invention is 0.1 to 15% by weight, preferably 1 to 10% by weight, more preferably 1 to 5% by weight, based in each case on the preparation.\n\nThe term \"cypermethrin\" refers to the synthetic pyrethroid (pyrethiid) (1RS) -cis-trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (R, S) - Î± -cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester, which consists of a mixture of 8 isomers, each present in approximately the same amount. Because of the discovery and commercialization of cypermethrin, products have been developed that contain increased amounts of certain isomers. As used herein, the term \"cypermethrin-rich\" refers to the following:\n\nalpha-cypermethrin, which is a racemate comprising (S) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1R) -cis-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (R) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1S) -cis-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate;\n\nbeta-cypermethrin which is a mixture comprising (S) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1R) -cis-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (R) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1S) -cis-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (S) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1R) -trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (1S) -trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, a reaction mixture of two enantiomeric pairs of (R) - Î± -cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate;\n\ntheta-cypermethrin which is a 1:1 mixture of the enantiomers (1S) -trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (R) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester and (1R) -trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (S) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester; and zeta-cypermethrin, which is (1RS) -cis-trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (R, S) -alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester enriched in 1R-cis-S and 1R-trans-isomers ].\n\nThe specific form of \"zeta-cypermethrin\" is (R, S) - Î± -cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1RS) -cis-trans-3- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, which is enriched in the 1R-cis-S and 1R-trans-S isomers according to the methods disclosed in patents us patent No. 5,164,411, us patent No. 5,028,731 and us patent No. 4,997,970, the most preferred form of \"zeta-cypermethrin\" is a mixture of cypermethrin isomers, which is prepared by the method disclosed in us patent No. 4,997,970, starting with a mixture of 55/45 cis/trans of cypermethrin with a catalytic amount of trioctyl ammonium chloride (S) (2, 2-dichlorovinyl) -2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate 336 Aldrich Chemical Co.) and sodium carbonate in n-heptane. This process and subsequent separation process results in zeta-cypermethrin containing a small amount, typically 0.6% to 1.3% of catalyst. The presence of this catalyst adds complexity to the formulation which is stable when diluted with process water.\n\nPreferably, the cypermethrin used in the formulation of the invention is alpha-cypermethrin.\n\nCypermethrin, preferably alpha-cypermethrin, is included in the formulation according to the invention in an amount of 0.1 to 15 wt.%, preferably 1 to 10 wt.%, in each case based on the formulation.\n\nThe organic solvent S may be essentially all organic solvents capable of dissolving all other components of the formulation at room temperature.\n\nThe solvent typically has a boiling point below 200 â at atmospheric pressure (1013mbar), or is a vegetable or animal oil or derivative thereof.\n\nIn the context of solvent miscibility, \"water miscible\" or \"water soluble\" means that the solvent that is \"miscible\" with water has a solubility in water of at least 1% by weight at 20 â.\n\nAn organic solvent S having a water solubility of less than 1% by weight at 20 â comprising:\n\nmineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point, such as kerosene, internal combustion engine oils;

plants, plant propagation material, for example seeds, or the soil or water in which the plants are grown, from attack or infestation by animal pests. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for plant protection which comprises contacting crops, plants, plant propagation material, for example seeds, or the soil or water in which the plants are grown, which are to be protected from attack or infestation by animal pests, with a pesticidally effective amount of the formulation of the invention.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention are also suitable for combating or controlling animal pests. Thus, the present invention also relates to a method of combating or controlling animal pests which comprises contacting the animal pests, their habitat, breeding ground or food supply or crop plant, plant propagation material, such as seeds or soil, or the area, material or environment in which the animal pests are growing or are likely to grow, with a pesticidally effective amount of a formulation of the present invention.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention are effective by both contact and ingestion. Furthermore, the formulations of the present invention may be applied to any and all developmental stages, such as eggs, larvae, pupae and adults.\n\nThe formulations of the invention may be used as such or in the form of compositions comprising them. Furthermore, the formulations of the present invention may be applied together with a mixing partner as defined above or in the form of a composition comprising said mixture. The components of the mixture can be applied simultaneously, jointly or separately, or in succession, i.e. one immediately after the other and thus producing the mixture \"in situ\" on the desired locus, for example a plant, in the case of separate applications, the sequence generally having no effect on the outcome of the control measures.\n\nApplication can be carried out both before and after infestation of the crop, plant propagation material, such as seeds, soil or areas, materials or the environment by pests.\n\nSuitable application methods include in particular soil treatment, seed treatment, in-furrow application and foliar application. Soil treatment methods include drenching the soil, drip irrigation (onto the soil), drenching the roots, tubers or bulbs, or soil injection. Seed treatment techniques include seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, and seed pelleting. In-furrow application typically includes the steps of creating a furrow in the field, seeding the furrow, applying an insecticidally active formulation to the furrow, and closing the furrow. Foliar application means the application of the pesticidally active formulation to the foliage of the plant, for example by means of a spraying device. For foliar applications, it may be advantageous to modify pest behavior by using pheromones in combination with the formulations of the present invention. Pheromones appropriate for particular crops and pests are known to the skilled person and are publicly available from databases of pheromones and information compounds, such as http:// www.pherobase.com.\n\nThe term \"contacting\" as used herein includes both direct contact (application of the formulation/composition directly to the animal pest or plant, typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (application of the formulation/composition to the locus of the animal pest or plant, i.e., habitat, breeding grounds, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which the pest is growing or may grow).\n\nThe term \"animal pests\" includes arthropods, gastropods and nematodes. Preferred animal pests according to the invention are arthropods, preferably insects and arachnids, in particular insects. Insects particularly related to crops are commonly referred to as crop insect pests.\n\nThe term \"crop\" refers to both growing and harvested crops.\n\nThe term \"plant\" includes cereals, such as durum and other wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats, rice or maize (silage and sweet/sweet maize and field maize); sugar beets, such as sugar or fodder beets; fruits such as pome, stone or berry, for example apples, pears, plums, peaches, nectarines, almonds, cherries, papayas, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as oilseed rape (oilseed rape), brassica campestris, mustard, olive, sunflower, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palm, peanut or soybean; cucurbits, such as cucurbits, squash, cucumber or melon; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or tangerines; vegetables, such as eggplant, spinach, lettuce (e.g., cabbage lettuce), chicory, cabbage, asparagus, cabbage, carrot, onion, garlic, leek, tomato, potato, cucurbit, or bell pepper; laurel plants, such as avocado, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as corn, soybean, rapeseed, sugarcane or oil palm; tobacco; nuts, such as walnuts; pistachio nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; grapevines (edible grapes and grapes for wine brewing); hops; stevia rebaudiana (also known as Stevia (Stevia)); natural rubber plants or ornamental and forest plants, such as flowers (e.g. carnation, petunia, geranium/geranium, pansy and impatiens), shrubs, broad-leaved trees (e.g. poplar) or evergreens, e.g. conifers; eucalyptus; turf; lawn; grasses, for example animal feed or for ornamental use. Preferred plants include potato, sugar beet, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, maize, cotton, soybean, rapeseed, legumes, sunflower, coffee or sugarcane; fruits; grape vines; an ornamental plant; or vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or winter squash.\n\nThe term \"cultivated plant\" is understood to include plants which have been modified by mutagenesis or genetic engineering in order to provide the plant with a new trait or to alter an already existing trait.\n\nMutagenesis includes techniques for random mutagenesis using X-rays or mutagenic chemicals, and also techniques for targeted mutagenesis to generate mutations at specific loci in the plant genome. Targeted mutagenesis techniques often use oligonucleotides or proteins (e.g., CRISPR/Cas, zinc finger nucleases, TALENs, or meganucleases) to achieve the targeting effect.\n\nGenetic engineering typically uses recombinant DNA techniques to produce modifications in the plant genome that cannot be readily obtained by hybridization, mutagenesis, or natural recombination in nature. Typically, one or more genes are integrated into the genome of a plant to add or improve a trait. These integrated genes are also referred to in the art as transgenes, and plants comprising such transgenes are referred to as transgenic plants. The process of plant transformation typically results in several transformation events that differ in genomic locus, in which the transgene is integrated. Plants that contain a specific transgene at a specific genomic locus are often described as containing a specific \"event,\" which is referred to by the specific event name. Traits that have been introduced into plants or modified include, inter alia, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, increased yield and tolerance to abiotic conditions, such as drought.\n\nHerbicide tolerance has been established through the use of mutagenesis and genetic engineering techniques. Plants that have been made tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor herbicides by conventional mutagenesis and breeding methods are included by the name Commercially available plant varieties. However, most herbicide tolerance characteristics are produced through the use of transgenes.\n\nGlyphosate (glyphosate), glufosinate (glufosinate), 2,4-D, dicamba (dicamba), benzonitrile (oxonil) herbicides (e.g., bromoxynil and iodoxynil), sulfonylurea herbicides, ALS inhibitor herbicides, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors (e.g., isophenylpyruvate) Fluroxypyr (isoxaflutole) and mesotrione (mesotrione)) produce herbicide tolerance.\n\nTransgenes that have been used to provide herbicide tolerance traits include: tolerance to glyphosate: cp4epsps, epsps grg23ace5, mepsps, 2mepsps, gat4601, gat4621, and goxv247, tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium: pat and bar, tolerance to 2, 4-D: aad-1 and aad-12, dicamba tolerance: dmo, tolerance to benzonitrile herbicides: bxn, tolerance to sulfonylurea herbicides: zm-hra, csr1-2, gm-hra, S4-HrA, resistance to ALS inhibitor herbicides: csr1-2, tolerance to HPPD inhibitor herbicides: hppdPF, W336 and avhppd-03.\n\nTransgenic maize events comprising herbicide tolerance genes are for example but not exclusively others: DAS40278, MON801, MON802, MON809, MON810, MON832, MON87411, MON87419, MON87427, MON88017, MON89034, NK603, GA21, MZHG0JG, HCEM485, and, 676. 678, 680, 33121, 4114, 59122, 98140, Bt10, Bt176, CBH-351, DBT418, DLL25, MS3, MS6, MZIR098, T25, TC1507, and TC 6275.\n\nTransgenic soybean events comprising herbicide tolerance genes are for example but not exclusively others: GTS40-3-2, MON87705, MON87708, MON87712, MON87769, MON89788, A2704-12, A2704-21, A5547-127, A5547-35, DP356043, DAS44406-6, DAS68416-4, DAS-81419-2, GU262, GU 872, and the like, W62, W98, FG72 and CV 127.\n\nTransgenic cotton events comprising herbicide tolerance genes are for example, but not exclusively, the other: 19-51a, 31707, 42317, 81910, 281-24-236, 3006-210-23, BXN10211, BXN10215, BXN10222, BXN10224, MON1445, MON1698, MON88701, MON88913, GHB119, GHB614, LLCotton25, T303-3 and T304-40.\n\nTransgenic brassica events comprising herbicide tolerance genes are for example, but not exclusively, the other: MON88302, HCR-1, HCN10, HCN28, HCN92, MS1, MS8, PHY14, PHY23, PHY35, PHY36, RF1, RF2, and RF 3.\n\nInsect resistance is mainly produced by transferring bacterial genes of insecticidal proteins into plants. The most commonly used transgenes are the toxin genes of Bacillus species (Bacillus spec.) and synthetic variants thereof, such as cry1A, cry1Ab, cry1Ab-Ac, cry1Ac, cry1A.105, cry1F, cry1Fa2, cry2Ab2, cry2Ae, mcry3A, ecry3.1Ab, cry3Bb1, cry34Ab1, cry35Ab1, cry9C, vip3A (a), vip3Aa 20. However, plant-derived genes have also been transferred to other plants. Particularly genes encoding protease inhibitors, such as CpTI and pinII. Another approach uses transgenes in order to produce double stranded RNA in plants to target and down regulate insect genes. An example of such a transgene is dvsnf 7.\n\nTransgenic maize events comprising a gene or double stranded RNA of a pesticidal protein are for example, but not exclusively, the other: bt10, Bt11, Bt176, MON801, MON802, MON809, MON810, MON863, MON87411, MON88017, MON89034, 33121, 4114, 5307, 59122, TC1507, TC6275, CBH-351, MIR162, DBT418, and MZIR 098.\n\nTransgenic soybean events comprising the gene for a pesticidal protein are for example, but not exclusively, the other: MON87701, MON87751, and DAS-81419.\n\nTransgenic cotton events comprising genes for insecticidal proteins are for example but not exclusively others: SGK321, MON531, MON757, MON1076, MON15985, 31707, 31803, 31807, 31808, 42317, BNLA-601, Event1, COT67B, COT102, T303-3, T304-40, GFM Cry1A, GK12, MLS 9124, 281-24-236, 3006-.\n\nYield can be increased by increasing ear biomass using transgene athb17 (present in corn event MON 87403), or by enhancing photosynthesis using transgene bbx32 (present in soybean event MON 87712).\n\nBy using a transgene: gm-fad2-1, Pj.D6D, Nc.Fad3, fad2-1A and fatb1-A, have produced cultivated plants containing improved oil content. Soybean events comprising at least one of these genes are: 260-05, MON87705 and MON 87769.\n\nBy using transgenic cspB and soybean event encompassed by corn event MON87460 The transgenic Hahb-4 involved has already developed tolerance to abiotic conditions, in particular to drought.\n\nTraits are frequently combined by combining genes in transformation events or by combining different events in the breeding process. Preferred combinations of traits are herbicide tolerance to different types of herbicides, insect tolerance to different types of insects, in particular tolerance to lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, one or several types of herbicide tolerance to insect resistance, increased herbicide tolerance and a combination of herbicide tolerance and tolerance to abiotic conditions.\n\nPlants comprising single or stacked traits and genes and events that provide these traits are well known in the art.

These effects may involve changes in growth behavior or resistance to biotic or abiotic stress factors. Such effects may include, inter alia, increased yield, enhanced resistance or tolerance to insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, mycoplasma, viruses or viroid pathogens, as well as early vigour, early or delayed maturation, cold or heat tolerance and altered amino acid or fatty acid profile or content.\n\nIt has surprisingly been found that the pesticidal activity of the formulations of the present invention can be enhanced by modifying the pesticidal properties of plants. Furthermore, it has been found that the formulations of the present invention are suitable for preventing insects from developing resistance to insecticidal traits or against pests that have developed resistance to insecticidal traits in modified plants. Furthermore, the formulations of the present invention are suitable for combating pests for which their insecticidal traits are not effective, so that complementary insecticidal activities can be advantageously employed.\n\nThe term \"plant propagation material\" refers to all reproductive parts of plants, such as seeds, as well as vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e.g., potatoes) that may be used to propagate plants. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, subterranean stems, shoots, buds and other plant parts. Seedlings and young plants transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil may also be included. These plant propagation materials can be treated prophylactically with plant protection preparations at the time of or before planting or transplanting.\n\nThe term \"seed\" includes all kinds of seeds and plant propagules, including but not limited to true seeds, seed sections (seed pieces), shoots, bulbs, corms, fruits, tubers, grains, cuttings (cut shoots), and the like, and in preferred embodiments refers to true seeds.\n\nGenerally, a \"pesticidally effective amount\" refers to the amount of active ingredient required to obtain an observable effect on growth, including necrotic, dead, retarded, prophylactic and ablative effects, destructive effects or effects that reduce the appearance and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount may vary for the various formulations/compositions used in the present invention. The pesticidally effective amount of the composition will also vary depending on the prevailing conditions such as the desired pesticidal effect and duration, the climate, the target species, the locus, the mode of application and the like.\n\nIn the case of soil treatment, in-furrow application or application to a pest habitat or nest, the amount of active ingredient is from 0.0001 to 500g/100m2Preferably 0.001-20g/100m2ã\n\nFor use in treating crop plants, for example by foliar application, the application rate of the active ingredients of the invention may range from 0.0001g to 4000g per hectare, for example from 1g to 2kg per hectare or from 1g to 750g per hectare, ideally from 1g to 100g per hectare, more ideally from 10g to 50g per hectare, for example from 10 to 20g per hectare, from 20 to 30g per hectare, from 30 to 40g per hectare or from 40 to 50g per hectare.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention are particularly suitable for treating seeds to protect the seeds from pests, particularly from soil borne pests, and to protect the roots and shoots of the resulting seedlings from soil and foliar insects. The invention therefore also relates to a method for protecting seeds from insects, in particular soil insects, and for protecting the roots and shoots of seedlings from insects, in particular soil and foliar insects, which comprises treating the seeds with a formulation according to the invention before sowing and/or after pregermination. Preferably, the roots and shoots of the seedlings are protected, more preferably the shoots of the seedlings are protected from piercing and sucking mouthparts insects, chewing mouthparts pests and nematodes.\n\nThe term \"seed treatment\" includes all suitable seed treatment techniques known in the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, seed pelleting, and in-furrow application methods. Preferably, the seed treatment application of the active compounds is carried out by spraying or dusting the plants before sowing and before emergence of the plants.\n\nThe invention also includes seeds coated with or containing the active agent. The term \"coated and/or containing\" generally means that the active ingredient is mostly on the surface of the propagation product at the time of application, but that a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the propagation product, depending on the method of application. When the propagation product is (re) planted, it may absorb the active ingredient.\n\nSuitable seeds are, for example, seeds of cereals, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals, for example durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (silage and sweet/sweet and field maize), soybean, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sunflower, banana, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugar beet, fodder beet, eggplant, potato, grass, turf, pasture, tomato, leek, squash/squash, cabbage, kohlrabi, pepper, cucumber, melon, Brassica (Brassica) species, melon, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuber plants such as potato, sugarcane, tobacco, grape, petunia, geranium/pelargonium, pansy and impatiens.\n\nThe invention therefore also relates to seeds to which the formulations according to the invention have been applied. The amount of active ingredient of the formulations of the invention or of their agriculturally acceptable salts varies generally between 0.1g and 10kg per 100kg of seeds, preferably between 1g and 5kg per 100kg of seeds, in particular between 1 and 1000g per 100kg of seeds. For particular crops such as lettuce, the application rates may be higher.\n\nThe formulations of the invention may also be used to improve plant health. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for improving the health of plants by treating the plants, plant propagation material and/or the locus where the plants thereof are growing or are to grow with an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of a formulation according to the invention.\n\nAs used herein, an \"effective and non-phytotoxic amount\" refers to an amount of the formulation that allows for the desired effect without causing any symptoms of phytotoxicity to the treated plant or to plants grown from the treated propagules or treated soil.\n\nThe terms \"plant\" and \"plant propagation material\" are as defined above.\n\n\"plant health\" is defined as the condition of a plant and/or its products, determined by several aspects, alone or in combination with each other, such as yield (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), quality (e.g. improved content or composition or shelf life of certain ingredients), plant vigor (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves (\"greening effect\"), tolerance to abiotic (e.g. drought) and/or biotic stress (e.g. diseases) and production efficiency (e.g. harvest efficiency, processability).\n\nThe plant health indicators determined above may be interdependent and may result from each other. Each index is defined in the art and can be determined by methods known to the skilled person.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention are also suitable for use against non-crop pests. For use against such non-crop pests, the formulations of the invention may be used as bait compositions, gels, general insect sprays, aerosols, ultra low volume applications and mosquito nets (impregnated or surface applied). In addition, a saturation and spray bar method may be used.\n\nThe term \"non-crop pest\" as used herein refers to pests specifically related to non-crop targets, such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, ticks, mosquitoes, crickets, or cockroaches.\n\nThe bait may be a liquid, solid or semi-solid formulation (e.g., a gel). The bait used in the composition is a product that is attractive enough to stimulate insects such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitoes, crickets, etc. or cockroaches to eat it. The attraction can be controlled by the use of feeding stimulants or sex pheromones. Food stimulants are for example not exhaustively selected from animal and/or plant proteins (meat-, fish-or blood meals, insect parts, egg yolk), fats and oils of animal and/or plant origin or mono-, oligo-or polyorganosaccharides, in particular sucrose, lactose, fructose, dextrose, glucose, starch, pectin or even molasses or honey. Fresh or decaying parts of fruits, crops, plants, animals, insects or specific parts thereof may also be used as feeding stimulants. Sex pheromones are known to be more insect-specific. Particular pheromones are described in the literature (e.g., http:// www.pherobase.com) and are known to those skilled in the art.\n\nFor use in bait compositions, typical levels of active ingredient are from 0.001% to 15% by weight, desirably from 0.001% to 5% by weight of the active compound.\n\nThe formulations of the invention and their corresponding compositions may also be used in mosquito and fumigant coils, chimneys, vaporization panels or long-term vaporizers, and also in moth papers, moth pads or other heat-independent vaporizer systems.\n\nMethods of controlling infectious diseases transmitted by insects (e.g., malaria, dengue and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) with the formulations of the present invention and their corresponding compositions also include treating surfaces of sheds and houses, air spraying and impregnating curtains, tents, clothing, mosquito nets, tsetse flies nets, and the like. The insecticidal composition applied to the fibers, fabrics, knits, nonwovens, nets or foils as well as tarpaulins preferably comprises a mixture comprising an insecticide, optionally a repellent and at least one binder.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention and compositions thereof can be used to protect wooden materials such as trees, guard rails, crossties, frames, artwork, etc., as well as buildings, but also building materials, furniture, leather, fibers, vinyl articles, wires and cables, etc., from ants and/or termites, and to prevent ants and termites from damaging crops or humans (e.g., when pests invade houses and public facilities).\n\nCustomary applications in the protection of materials are, for example, from 0.001 to 2000g or from 0.01 to 1000g of active compound/m2The material to be treated is preferably 0.1 to 50g active compound/m2The material to be processed.\n\nThe insecticidal composition used for material impregnation typically comprises 0.001 to 95 wt%, preferably 0.1 to 45 wt%, and more preferably 1 to 25 wt% of at least one mosquito repellent and/or insecticide.\n\nThe formulations of the present invention are particularly suitable for effective combating animal pests such as arthropods, gastropods and nematodes, including but not limited to:\n\ninsects from the order Lepidoptera (Lepidoptera), such as the wax moth (Achroia grisella), the species hemiptera (Acleris spp.), such as the macular hemiptera (a. fimbriana), the west blackhead hemiptera (a. glovarana), the blackhead hemiptera (a. variana);
