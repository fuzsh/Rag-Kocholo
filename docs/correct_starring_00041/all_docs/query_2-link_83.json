(Two men were convicted of the killings and were sentenced to life in prison; a third was found guilty of robbery and assault.)\n\nIn 1984, Italy and the Vatican signed an accord under which Roman Catholicism ceased to be the state religion of Italy.\n\nIn 1988, Anthony M.

(Hanssen later pleaded guilty to espionage and attempted espionage and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.)\n\nIn 2003, an arson attack involving two South Korean subway trains in the city of Daegu claimed 198 lives. (The arsonist was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2004.)\n\nIn 2012, a star-studded funeral service was held for pop singer Whitney Houston at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, a week after her death at age 48.\n\nIn 2017, Norma McCorvey, whose legal challenge under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\" led to the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision that legalized abortion but who later became an outspoken opponent of the procedure, died in Katy, Texas, at age 69.\n\nIn 2018, \"Black Panther,\" the Marvel superhero film from the Walt Disney Co., blew past expectations to take in $192 million during its debut weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump commuted the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for political corruption; Blagojevich left prison hours later and returned home to Chicago. (Trump also issued pardons or clemency to former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, financier Michael Milken and a long list of others.)\n\nIn 2023, former President Jimmy Carter entered home hospice care. The charity created by the 98-year-old former president said that after a series of short hospital stays, Carter \"decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.\" (Carter remains alive a year later).\n\nToday's birthdays: Singer Yoko Ono is 91.
