        "text": "One of the rare pleasures of something like Netflix, because of its ceaseless attempts to grab public attention with something ‘new’ is managing to find the older films on the platform worth watching. Well, I say ‘old’, but in the case of The Contract, which I stumbled upon by chance/vagaries of the Netflix algorithms, I have to wonder what qualifies as old: is 2006 as ancient as current-centric platforms like Netflix might suggest, and where does that leave all the films of the 1970s and (especially) the 1980s that I grew up with? Bad enough working with colleagues who weren’t even born when I was a lad in the Odeon Cinema watching Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. As for films of the 1940s or 1950s…\n\nAnyway, maybe I’m just too forgiving but The Contract proved something of a surprise. Not just that it was actually better than I’d expected (you know, set your sights low enough and anything can surprise), but also that it was a film I’d never heard of, despite featuring both Morgan Freeman and John Cusack (particularly the latter, as he’s one of my wife Claire’s favourite actors). It was directed by Bruce Beresford, and seeing his name got my attention as I remembered his Driving Miss Daisy (another Morgan Freeman vehicle (sic)) which was a big success at the time, albeit possibly quite forgotten today, as films tend to be, attention-spans such as they are. Mind, I’d actually mistakenly thought Beresford had directed Harry and the Hendersons but it turns out I was wrong on that score, proving that my memory is getting fuzzy.\n\nThe Contract was hardly going to set the cinematic world afire back when it came out in 2006, and indeed it was actually a straight to video release in most markets, but its a reasonably solid effort, predictable in places but none the worse for that- there is something rather comforting watching something like this, a fairly low-key drama/thriller depicting ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Well, maybe not all that ordinary, but this is Hollywood. I guess this is the kind of mundane film that oddly ages quite well considering the over-the-top, noisy extravaganzas we tend to get these days.\n\nCusack plays Ray, a widower who has a fractious relationship with his teenage son, Chris (Jamie Anderson) and takes him on a hiking trip out in the woods to try fix their issues. Meanwhile, following a chance car accident assassin Frank Carden (Freeman) has been caught by the FBI whilst recovering in hospital and is being transported to headquarters when Frank’s hitmen associates try to free him. The attempt goes astray, the car Frank is being driven in plunges off the road into a river sweeping him downstream to where Ray and Chris are hiking. The FBI agent handcuffed to Frank dies, but fortunately not before telling Ray who he and Frank are and the need to get Frank to the authorities. Frank’s team, of course, are soon on the chase.\n\nThe narrative is spoiled by a few of the usual tropes- Ray is a small-town teacher now but he used to be a cop, so is better qualified than might be expected to protect his son, mind Frank’s attempts to abscond and thwart the mercenaries on their trail, and the film can’t avoid providing a young romantic interest for Ray when they stumble upon a young couple and the annoying boyfriend catches a bullet to remind us that Frank’s team aren’t completely useless. A welcome treat is Alice Krige, who plays a duplicitous Intelligence chief with an agenda that requires Frank to be killed rather than possibly reveal agency plots about a contract on a reclusive billionaire- its all very daft but kind of fun. Its one of those films in which nobody’s wardrobe ever seems to get dirty or creased despite days spent in the wilds (Frank’s tailored outfit is practically the stuff of sorcery). Freeman, of course is quite brilliant, effortlessly playing this cold assassin with a moral compass; his natural charisma assures us he’ll do the right thing eventually (especially when he realises his boss has turned on him and he’s now a target). Its almost bewildering how Frank’s team of mercenaries are oddly inept rather than the coldly ruthless killers they purport to be, but that’s part of the fun of the film. Its very much a Sunday afternoon film, really, and possibly none the worst for that- but yeah, maybe I’m too forgiving. I’ve seen much worse.\n\nIs Amazon’s reboot of Utopia the perfect drama for our uncertain times? Maybe the world wasn’t ready for the Channel 4 original back in 2013. Maybe the world needed a crisis in the real world to mirror that of the fiction, or the world to get just a bit shittier regards global warming and a world pandemic and all its other problems. Indeed, maybe its all a little too close now- each episode opens with a disclaimer that the series is a work of fiction and its depicted pandemic in no way is intended to reference any real pandemic:\n\n“This program is a work of fiction, and not based on any actual pandemic or related events. It contains scenes that some viewers may find disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.”\n\nWhich might seem a little heavy-handed or overly cautious, but considering what Utopia reveals as the origin and purpose of its pandemic, and what the series then warns about a certain vaccine being utilised as a solution to that pandemic, well, lets just suggest even I was taken aback at what was being suggested and lord knows there’s enough anti-vaxxers in the world causing plenty of trouble without arming them with another conspiracy theory to jump upon.\n\nThe sense of timing is possibly considered incredibly fortuitous by Amazon, as its difficult to refute some of Utopia‘s madness when it seems to mirror the real world in disturbing ways, but its almost scarily well-timed (or ill-timed, depending on one’s point of view). HBOs Watchmen limited series was possibly six months ahead of world events regards racial tensions, Utopia is possibly six months behind, or maybe possibly bang-on, regards world events with the Covid-19 pandemic. Possibly its genius, possibly its crassly exploitive. Maybe its all a conspiracy.\n\nTo be sure, Utopia is ultimately daft, Gillian Flynn (writer of Gone Girl) having created a deliriously excessive, nutty motherload of conspiracy dramas so wild it borders on farce. Its conspiracy piled upon conspiracy, in which characters suddenly realise their whole lives, romances, wives/careers are all part of a finely orchestrated conspiracy so intricate its mind-bogglingly mad. Mind, for all the silliness, there are sobering reminders of the power of social media to shape opinion and how the Internet can be misused to lie and misinform and manipulate. As violent as it is off the rails nutty, in some ways it could be described as Watchmen by way of Fargo (minus the superheroes, naturally). John Cusack’s Dr Kevin Christie has a solution to world over-population and pollution as crazy as Adrian Veldt’s scheme to save the world, and its a reminder of how the very best villains seem to think they are the heroes saving the world.\n\nRegards tone, well I guess you could describe the UK original as being very Quatermass, and this new one as, well, 24. I’m pretty sure this will be enjoyed by those unfamiliar with the Channel 4 series, while fans of the original may be horrified. They are chalk and cheese. This thing is slick and fast-paced and twisty and bloody… its very modern, very streaming/binge-worthy (heck, I’ve watched all eight episodes over this weekend). It has everything to say and nothing to say. Its got plot-holes that are huge and skirted over in a heartbeat. It takes the sudden twists and illogic of 24 and the surprise deaths of Game of Thrones and takes it to some other level, ultimately getting too daft to be taken seriously, undoing much of the good that it does early on. It just tries to layer too many surprises and twists. To be sure, its an easy target and can be easily ridiculed, but like the best conspiracies, like Kubrick filming the moon landing, Utopia may be a conspiracy series that lingers, that refuses to lie down. And its sure to resonate with some viewers, too. Its just too timely to avoid it.\n\nPerhaps for my part, my biggest grievance is how it ultimately panders to inevitable economic realities- it ends teasing the possibility of a second season, when I would have absolutely adored it had it had the nerve to end with a decisive ending- ideally the End of the World ending it possibly deserves. I suppose had it ended that literal way it would indeed have returned to the Quatermass sensibility of the UK original, whereas, as I have noted, this thing is really more 24. It doesn’t escape my notice that 24 became a victim of its own success, and eventually a parody of itself in later seasons, and maybe Utopia would have been best left alone to one season, a self-contained whole. As an eight-part, continuously twisting, surprising drama it works like an efficient fine-tuned machine, but for awhile there, I really thought this thing could have gone dark.\n\nAlthough, in these uncertain times outside of that television screen, maybe that would be just too much.\n\nQuite how it had taken so many years for me to finally watch this film is quite beyond me. Its not as if I never read Stephen King stories or watch the movies based on them- quite the contrary. And yet it has taken so many years- Stand By Me was released back in 1986, which is what, 34 years ago, now. I suppose its nice that even after watching so many films over the years, there are still some genuinely good ones waiting for me to catch up with them. Films are patient. There’s great ones waiting for all of us.\n\nThat length of years is frightening, though. For instance, does anybody else think its scary that the length of time since the film came out is more than the distance in time between the films original release and when it was set, in 1959- a gap of just 27 years. So the narrator looking back and telling his tale is looking back 27 years, and me, I’m now 34 years distant from when the film came out. I imagine viewers in 1986 thinking that the films period setting was a distant time ago, and yet here I am now…. crumbs.\n\nIt just lends the film a certain feeling, seeing some of those actors -Will Wheaton, Richard Dreyfuss, Corey Fieldman, Jerry O’Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack- all looking so young, not to mention the added poignancy of seeing River Phoenix. Just on the evidence of this one film, its clear that he was an actor of considerable merit and screen charisma, destined to be a future star possibly as great as Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or Johnny Depp… who knows where his future might have lead? As it turned out, he didn’t have that future, because he died of a drug overdose just 7 years after Stand By Me was released.\n\nSo Stand By Me is like some kind of impossible bubble of spacetime with those actors so incredibly young, the kids with their whole lives ahead of them… and me, sitting here in 2020 watching it for the first time. Suddenly appreciating why people have praised the film and sometimes remarked to me “what? You’ve never seen that yet?” in disbelief. The realisation that I have only watched it now because of something of a whim, having noticed the 4K UHD edition in a sale for £9.99 and thinking, maybe its worth a punt, maybe its as good as people say, and the film might cheer me up. We all need cheering up in these uncertain times. Chalk up one more positive to Covid19 then.\n\nIts a lovely little film. Hardly perfect but still, very good, and certainly one of the better Stephen King adaptations. Naturally it reminded me of American Graffiti, not just because Richard Dreyfuss features in both: the films are cinematic cousins, really, both period films about growing up, and how they used Rock n’Roll songs to form a soundtrack. I thought Jack Nitzche’s score and its use of the Ben E. King song was particularly fine, delicately done. Hey, American Graffiti– now there’s a film I really should find time to watch again.\n\nMe, now, wondering what in the world I was doing back in 1986 that meant I was too busy to go watch this film or catch it on VHS rental or watch it on television showings over the years since. 1986 was the year Aliens came out, wasn’t it. And The Mission, and Day of the Dead, Poltergeist 2, Big Trouble in Little China… and Howard the Duck. Those were the films I watched at the cinema that year. Its funny how I remember years by what films I saw, sometimes its the only sense of perspective of time that I have now.\n\nBut that’s how films trick you, and release dates in particular- Stand By Me may have been released in late summer of 1986 in America, but digging around a little I discover that the film wasn’t released over here in the UK until early 1987. We forget it was a bigger world back then, and releases of films were spread across several months over International Territories.I remember one of the most exciting things about having a region-free DVD player when they came out in the late nineties (mine was an American machine with a transformer the size of a house brick) was that we could see films at home that still hadn’t even been released in the cinemas over here. So sure, Stand By Me was released back in 1986 in America but for us in the UK it was 1987, the year I went to watch other films like The Fly, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Innerspace instead. That’s just how I count the years.\n\n2016.64: The Paperboy (Film Four, HD)\n\nI haven’t the foggiest. It suckered me in with the cast and by the time I realised what I was watching I decided to just grit my teeth and see it out to the bitter end. One of the most bizarre films I have seen in many a moon, this seedy tale of southern guilt/ pleasures/ secrets is told by Macy Gray (!) in flashbacks to 1969. Trailer trash Nicole Kidman (!) has fallen in love with prison pen pal John Cusack (!) and enlists the help of idealistic journalist Matthew McConaughey (!) to find evidence to ensure the wronged convicts release from his trumped-up murder charge before he fries on the electric chair. The journalists younger brother Zac Efron (!) insists on wearing very little other than tight undies and becomes infatuated with Kidman. McConaughey isn’t bothered by Kidman’s sultry charms as he’s more interested in black men, a particular guilty secret that leads to no good as even as late as 1969 the swinging sixties haven’t really arrived in the Deep South. Oh, did I mention that McConaughey’s sidekick is David Oyelowo? Or that there’s a beach scene in which Kidman pisses over Efron to save his life?\n\nReally, this is one of those brilliantly bad film disasters that has you wondering if it will be quickly forgotten or maybe turn into a cult classic in twenty years. I remember I used to think LifeForce was terrible- well it is a bad film but it’s turned into one of my favourite guilty pleasures, so maybe The Paperboy will work similar magic on audiences over the years.But not me, I’m sure.\n\nIt’s a bewildering, crazy film. A drinking game in which you take a shot whenever Efron slips down to just his indies would have you unconscious midway through the film. Not being judgemental, but I bet this film has a huge gay following. I guess I should think it’s novel and refreshing to see a film that is more interested in a guys body rather than that of its female star, but it’s really quite surreal.\n\nIndeed it’s weird how the film turns from an investigative mystery, into a coming of age story, then a social commentary on racism in the South, then a film about sexual guilt, then finally a full-on horror slasher flick in its finale. Its clearly a sign of a film that doesn’t know what it is. All I know is it is truly, truly bad, but strangely worth watching if only for the bizarre experience of watching something just so thoroughly odd with such an A-list cast slumming in it. Utterly mad."
