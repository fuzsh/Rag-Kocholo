        "text": "Following a Screening of High Fidelity\n\nTHE JANUARY 14TH 7PM PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN POSTPONED. A NEW DATE WILL BE ANNOUNCED SHORTLY.\n\nWE THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING.\n\nJoin us for an evening with John Cusack and special screening of the movie High Fidelity. Stay after the film for a Q&A with John Cusack! Meet & Greet package available.\n\nWith an impressive body of work spanning the course of three decades, John Cusack has evolved into one of Hollywood’s most accomplished and respected actors of his generation, garnering both critical acclaim as well as prestigious accolades for his dramatic and comedic roles.\n\nCusack was most recently seen in the Amazon’s SciFi series, “Utopia,” in which he stars as Dr. Kevin Christie, a charismatic, media-savvy, and brilliant biotech mind who wants to change the world through science. “Utopia” is based on Dennis Kelly’s British series of the same name and highly acclaimed author Gillian Flynn served as executive producer and showrunner.\n\nCusack first gained the attention of audiences by starring in a number of 1980’s film classics such as “The Sure Thing,” “Say Anything” and “Sixteen Candles.” Following these roles, Cusack successfully shed his teen-heartthrob image by demonstrating his ability to expand his film repertoire by starring in a wide range of dramas, thrillers and comedies including “The Grifters,” “Eight Men Out,” “Being John Malkovich,” “High Fidelity” and “Grosse Pointe Blank.”\n\nIn recent years, Cusack starred in Bill Pohland’s “Love and Mercy,” in which he played iconic Beach Boys songwriter and musician Brian Wilson. Cusack starred opposite Paul Dano, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti as Wilson in the later years of his life. Cusack also starred in David Cronenberg’s, “Maps to the Stars” alongside Julianne Moore, Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The satirical drama is an analysis of the entertainment industry's relationship with Western civilization as a whole.\n\nCusack also appeared in a supporting role in Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq,” alongside Teyonah Parris, Nick Cannon and Samuel L. Jackson, Lee Daniels’ drama, “The Paperboy,” opposite Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron and Matthew McConaughey and in James McTeigue’s independent thriller “The Raven,” where he portrayed the infamous author, Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nAdditionally, in 2009 he starred in Roland Emmerich’s apocalyptic thriller, “2012.” Released by Sony Pictures, the international blockbuster went on to gross more than $766 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2001, Cusack was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical for his role in the feature version of Nick Hornby's English novel, \"High Fidelity,\" for Touchstone Pictures. In addition to starring in the film, Cusack also co-produced and co-wrote the script with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis. The film also stars Jack Black, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Joan Cusack.\n\nIn 1999, Cusack starred in the dark comedy \"Being John Malkovich\" for USA Films. Cusack’s performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Actor.\n\nSome of his other feature film credits include: “The Frozen Ground”, “Hot Tub Time Machine”, “War Inc.”, “Grace Is Gone”, “The Ice Harvest”, “Runaway Jury”, “Identity”, “Max”, “Cradle Will Rock”, “The Thin Red Line”, “Con Air”, “City Hall”, “Bullets Over Broadway”, “The Road to Wellville”, “True Colors”, “Broadcast News”, “Serendipity”, “Better Off Dead” and “Stand By Me.”\n\nIn April 2012, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce presented Cusack with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star, honoring his long, ground-breaking career in film."
