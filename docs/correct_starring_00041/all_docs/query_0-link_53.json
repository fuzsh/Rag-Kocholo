        "text": "Looks like one of the stars of Con Air is heading skyward once again. Variety reports that John Cusack is in talks to lead a new aerial action thriller called Airspace, with Roger Avary in talks to direct. Most film nerds should instantly recognize that name, but in case you're unfamiliar, Avary co-wrote Pulp Fiction with Quentin Tarantino and directed an adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Rules of Attraction. Airspace is being described as \"Duel in the sky,\" and follows a workaholic pilot (Cusack) flying home to reunite with his family when he discovers a mysterious briefcase on his plane and is attacked by a MiG fighter jet. Read on!\n\nBriana Hartman (Brother's Keeper) wrote the original screenplay based on an idea from Michael B. Chait, but Avary has already come aboard to take a pass of his own, so his deal to direct should come through smoothly. Cusack did solid work in tight spaces in the mostly-forgotten suspense film 1408 (and he's working with Stephen King material again in Cell), so it should be fun to see him work inside the confined environment of a cockpit while trying to figure out who's chasing him and why. It's an interesting reversal from Cusack's upcoming role in Grand Piano, in which he's the one who plays the tormentor to Elijah Wood's character, so it looks like the actor was in the mood to switch things up a bit. Sounds good to us, and we'll be looking forward to this one."
