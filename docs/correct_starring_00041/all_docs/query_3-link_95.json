        "text": "To this day, we’re still holding out hope that one day, we’ll look outside our window to our very own Lloyd Dobler, boombox in tow — But until that day comes, we can look back fondly on the 1989 cult-classic Say Anything, led by a cast we still adore.\n\nThe film tells the story of young love between two recent high-school graduates from different worlds. Lloyd, played by John Cusack, is a notorious underachiever who lives with his sister, played by Joan Cusack, free of any solid plans for his future aside from his interest in kickboxing.\n\nDiane, played by Ione Skye, is valedictorian and plans on continuing her education in a prestigious program in England. Lloyd is fond of Diane despite never really getting to know her, and when he invites her to join him at a party for their graduation, she accepts.\n\nAs the two spend more time together, their attraction grows, much to the dismay of Diane’s father, who feels it’s best if she focuses on herself and the future ahead. Say Anything remains a classic, and you probably can’t hear Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” without shedding a tear of nostalgia — here, take a look at the cast of the beloved film today.\n\nJohn Cusack as Lloyd Dobler\n\nJohn Cusack led the cast in his beloved role of Lloyd, but prior to the film, he was already making a name for himself in movies like Sixteen Candles (1984), Stand by Me (1986) and Eight Men Out (1988). Later films that he earned recognition for were those including Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), High Fidelity (2000), Serendipity (2001), 1408 (2007) and 2012 (2009). His most recent roles were in Pursuit (2022) and the television series Utopia in 2020.\n\nIn an interview with TODAY, Cusack was asked if it ever gets old being asked about the boombox, to which he replied, “Yeah, but they come up about other things too.” He continued, “And then, I figure, you know, that’s kind of a champagne problem, right? I think if that’s as tough as it’s going to get for me, I’m a pretty lucky guy.”\n\nIone Skye as Diane Court\n\nIone Skye continued acting in the aftermath of her Say Anything success in both movies and various TV shows. You could later find her in Wayne’s World (1992), Covington Cross, Four Rooms (1995), Fever Pitch (2005) and Zodiac (2007). Recently, a majority of her roles have been in television series, those including Beef, Barons, Immoral Compass, Good Girls, Arrested Development and Camping, to name a few.\n\n“People relate to the characters because they’re both unusual, outcast characters,” Ione Skye said about Say Anything on an appearance on TODAY. “A man will say, ‘I was Diane Court’ or just I think just having these outcast kind of characters people really related to them. It’s nice to be in something that people who’ve seen the film seem so close to.”\n\nJohn Mahoney as Jim Court\n\nAfter his role as Diane’s scheming father in Say Anything, John Mahoney went on to have a wildly successful career, known by most for his role of Martin Crane in Frasier. Before Frasier and after Say Anything he made appearances in series like H.E.L.P, The Human Factor, Screenplay, Cheers and more. After Frasier, he could be seen in series like In Treatment, Burn Notice and Hot in Cleveland. Mariette in Ecstasy (2019) was his last credited role, as he sadly passed away in 2018.\n\nLili Taylor as Corey Flood\n\nLili Taylor played Lloyd’s close friend Corey in the film. Taylor too continued to enjoy a successful career in the wake of her Say Anything role both in television and in film. Before Corey, you might recognize her for her role in Mystic Pizza alongside Julia Roberts.\n\nAfter Say Anything, some of her significant roles were in I Shot Andy Warhol (1996) and later in series like Mad About You, Deadline, Six Feet Under, Almost Human, Hemlock Grove and more. Her most recent role was in the series Outer Range with Josh Brolin and Imogen Poots.\n\nLoren Dean as Joe\n\nLoren Dean played the role of Joe in Say Anything and continued making appearances on the big and small screen over the years. His significant TV roles after Say Anything were in series such as As the World Turns, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, The Bronx Is Burning, Bones, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Terriers and Grey’s Anatomy. His most notable movies have been Appollo 13, The Mule and Ad Astra, alongside Brad Pitt.\n\nPamela Adlon as Rebecca\n\nPamela Adlon has built herself a lengthy resume after her role in the Say Anything cast, but less for her parts in front of the camera. Throughout the 90s and into present day, Pamela Adlon began working steadily as a voice actor, and you can hear her voice in shows like Pete the Cat, Devil May Care, Bob’s Burgers, Milo Murphy’s Law and WordGirl. However, in front of the camera, you can find her in series like Californication, Better Things, This Is Us, The Big Bang Theory and Louie.\n\nJeremy Piven as Mark in the Say Anything cast\n\nYou may recognize him as Ari Gold from Entourage, but long before those days, Jeremy Piven was bringing the character of Mark to life in Say Anything. Other notable roles have been in films like Serendipity (2001) and Grosse Point Blank (1997), both in which he starred alongside John Cusack. For his work in Entourage, he won a Golden Globe and three Emmys.\n\nJoan Cusack as Constance in the Say Anything cast\n\nJoan Cusack played a small role in Say Anything as Constance — Lloyd’s sister — and she also happens to be John Cusack’s real-life sister. Cusack is another actress apart of this cast who went on to have success as both a screen actor and a voice actor, recognized for her roles in shows and movies like Shameless, Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), What About Joan, School of Rock (2003), the Toy Story film series and much more.\n\nEric Stoltz as Vahlere in the Say Anything cast\n\nEric Stoltz played Vahlere in Say Anything, and later went on to act in films like Pulp Fiction (1994), Little Women (1994) and The Butterfly Effect (2004). You could also find him in series like Caprica, Grey’s Anatomy, Chicago Hope and Mad About You.\n\nWant to see more of your favorite movie casts?
