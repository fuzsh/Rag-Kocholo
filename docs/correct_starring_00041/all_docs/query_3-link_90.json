        "text": "If you’re the type who gets all their movies from late night cable, you might think John Cusack is just a fun-teen-movie kind of guy. You couldn’t be more wrong. John Cusack is the real deal and very worthy of paying attention to. Whether you knew that already, or you’re someone who is ready to learn something, you’re going to love the shit out of this weekend-long John Cusack film festival. Rent your DVDs, download from iTunes or Amazon Instant, Queue up Netflix and get Locked In with John Cusack.\n\nCheck out our interview with John Cusack about his upcoming film The Raven, and then add The Raven to your list, opening this Friday, April 27.\n\n***\n\nThe Sure Thing\n\nIt’s in the tradition of the ” We have to get laid”, 80’s style teen comedy movies, but directed by Rob Reiner and it’s closer in in tone to Harry met Sally than to Porkys. It’s Cusak’s first starring role and he shows a real leading man’s moral center. It was easy to look at this film and know this kid had a future in films. It’s also an easy light hearted start to your John Cusack film festival.\n\n***\n\nSay Anything\n\nSorry John Hughes but Cameron Crow and John Cusack made the best teen film of the 80s. Cusack plays the high school outsider that every outsider wants to be. He doesn’t want to be popular he doesn’t want to want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. “I don’t want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed.” He just wants the smart girl, Diane Court. If you were born after this 80’s great, and never caught it on tv, lucky you, you get to see it for the first time. Everyone else can just enjoy it again.\n\n***\n\nGrifters\n\nCusak steps out of his comedy persona in this dark film by Stephen Frears. This is a film for adults. It’s a dark look at Grifters, Con Men, who go from town to town looking to make short, fast money. Angelica Huston plays his mother with incestuous undertones. Annette Benning plays his amazingly sexy but untrustworthy girlfriend. It’s a dark tense film and a huge leap from teen films.\n\n***\n\nHigh Fidelity\n\nCusak teams up successfully again with with Stephen Frears. The film is based on the 1995 British novel from Nick Hornby but the setting moves from London from Chicago. Cusak plays the post slacker audiophile brilliantly, so brilliantly that many fans feel that Cusak is playing himself. It’s a home run and hard to imagine any other actor in this role.\n\n***\n\nBeing John Malcovich\n\nDirected by Spike Jones and written by Charlie Kauffman. This time Cusak plays someone with a strong immoral center. A puppeteer who wants nothing but fame and fortune, even if he has to take from someone. It’s hard to remember what a shock this was when it came out or the fact that it was a little seen film in theaters. It’s a landmark film, and a great culmination for the weekend.\n\n***\n\n***"
