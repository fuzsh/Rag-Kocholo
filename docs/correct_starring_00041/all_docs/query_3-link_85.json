        "text": "John Cusack is most fondly remembered for roles that required him to be tortured by matters of the heart—as a trench-coat-clad teenager in Say Anything, a nostalgic assassin in Grosse Pointe Blank, and even a greasy-haired street puppeteer in Being John Malkovich—but in his new thriller, The Raven, Cusack is tortured by matters of the mind. Cusack plays Edgar Allen Poe, who, in a dramatic re-imagining of the writer's last days, tries to solve a series of crimes, with Poe's macabre stories brought to life as a grisly backdrop.\n\nIn anticipation of the film, which opens today, we sat down with the 45-year-old actor in a markedly less macabre setting—at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills—and heard about his streak of tortured-soul roles, his visceral reaction to the Say Anything anthem, and his place in the Hollywood food chain.____\n\nJulie Miller: Were you in the market for especially tortured characters when you took on Edgar Allen Poe? Because you filmed The Raven back to back with two other very dark projects, Frozen Ground and The Paperboy.\n\nJohn Cusack: Not in the market, but [roles like these] kind of find you. And you find them. I didn’t plan it, but I just went into the underworld for a whole year. With Poe, I think the idea of playing such an iconic character was really exciting and would be a real challenge. You’d have to go on a real bender to portray him right.\n\nWhat was your bender like?\n\nWell, we were in Hungary and Serbia in the winter, and we were shooting at night. It was pretty spooky and I didn’t sleep a lot. I got really thin and it got to be trippy, like I was on a fast or something. When I came home for Christmas—I remember that I came home the 24th and my family saw me and said, “What the hell happened to you?!” I looked pretty skeletal. I weighed less than what I weighed in high school.\n\nHow did you find that you related to Poe from all of your research?\n\nCarl Jung, the psychologist, said that we all have a shadow. And people who are literary, or in music, or in film—anyone that is that kind of the artistic archetype—we kind of represent that part of ourselves. I think that Poe is so resonant because he represents that part of us that is in misery or sorrowful or wants to explore the darkness. He wrote a great story called “The Imp of the Perverse” about the instinct towards self-destruction. Poe is the godfather of Goth literature and that whole movement. I think that he represents that part in all of us because we relate to him. You always want to go to places you’ve never been before, get yourself in trouble, and then try to find your way out. Also, he was an addict, and he really battled his demons. So I think that everyone can relate to that. Everyone has demons that they have to fight back.____\n\nThe Ravenis a dark thriller, but you’ve managed to dabble in every film genre. And unlike other leading men, you’ve managed to play all types of characters, from a nerd to a hit man, to a puppeteer, to the romantic lead. How have you avoided being pigeonholed in either a genre or a character type?\n\nYou just try to get the best jobs that you can get. Sometimes I produce my own movies, so that’s your own sort of vision. That helps things. I don’t know what it is. Probably just circumstance. I’ve definitely been aware of the fact that I want to do different things. That’s what I’ve tried to do, but I was just really lucky to get certain parts, like The Raven. This is a part that would usually just go to Johnny [Depp] or Robert [Downey Jr.], who have made bigger box-office movies. Some days you’re higher up on the food chain than others, and sometimes you’re not. I was glad that it was my turn to get lucky.\n\nDo those food-chain fluctuations affect you these days?\n\nYeah, but I’ve come in and out of vogue so many times in my career now that I just feel lucky that I can keep going. There are probably 20 of us in play, though.\n\nNot many actors can say that they were part of an iconic film scene, but you can, with the Say Anything boom-box sequence. Given how much it has been parodied and referenced in pop culture, though, has that scene reached its saturation point with you?\n\nIf it was a movie that I did not like or that was something that I was embarrassed over, maybe. But that one worked out. [Smiles.] People liked it. I had a great collaboration with [the film’s writer and director], Cameron Crowe, and a special relationship with the actors. That was a great marker for me in my life, as a young man and an actor. Having people remember something that you did 25 years ago doesn’t suck. There are some cult-y movies, though, that people remember now, and will talk about to me, and I’ll kind of go [scowls]. But Say Anything was actually a good film. We tried to make it good, at least.\n\nSay that you walk into a store and hear “In Your Eyes” . . . what is your instinctive reaction?\n\nProbably to hide a little bit. [Covers his face with his elbow.] I remember that I talked to Peter Gabriel [who wrote and sang the song that played during the boom-box scene], though, once and he said, “You know we’re linked together forever, right?” And I said, “I know. I hope that’s O.K. with you.” [Laughs.]\n\nDo you remember the turning point when you realized that you were recognizable enough to have to hide your face in the first place?\n\nI was probably about 18. I don’t know if there was a turning point, but I remember pretty early on thinking that I wasn’t going to get a Tuesday off. I don’t think that actually hits you until you are already in that place and people recognize you. You think that it might be cool to get to meet so many people, and it’s really great; I’ve been really lucky—but I remember pretty early on thinking that this just doesn’t stop. It’s heavy.\n\nA lot of people can pinpoint their favorite John Cusack scene, but can you pinpoint yours?\n\nNo. I definitely have a few least favorite but I won’t tell you just because I don’t want to hurt the other actors. I do have scenes, though, when I helped to write them, in Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, and High Fidelity, that I remember as being some pretty cool moments. Like writing a monologue for Sir Ben Kingsley to shoot in a garbage truck in Bulgaria for War, Inc.—I realized then how special that was. Or I’m doing a scene with Paul Newman. Or I’m working with Al Pacino. Or how did I get to write comedy for Dan Aykroyd [in Grosse Pointe Blank]? Those are the moments that I look back on and think, “God, you are so lucky.”"
