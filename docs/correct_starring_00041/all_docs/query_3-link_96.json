        "text": "To me, there are fewer more iconic film roles from my lifetime than John Cusack‘s Lloyd Dobler in Cameron Crowe‘s fantastic tale of late 80’s high school love Say Anything. While his role as Lane Meyer in Better Off Dead will always be my favorite of his, Cusack‘s portrayal of Dobler is what earned him his most acclaim as an actor up the point of Say Anything‘s release and launched him as a bona fide leading man. Cusack is somewhat of a Hollywood enigma, almost known more for turning down famous roles than for the eclectic roles he has chosen. For example, he turned down Bill Paxton‘s role in Apollo 13, Woody Harrelson‘s role in Indecent Proposal, Greg Kinnear‘s role in As Good As it Gets, and most recently, the role of Walter White in the TV scorcher Breaking Bad (among many others). Few have seen his turns in cult classics like the bizarre, yet oh-so-wonderful Tapeheads (one of my all-time faves) or Hellcab. But Lloyd Dobler people have seen and really connected with.\n\nLloyd is the son of a Lt. Col in the Army. He lives with his sister (played by real life sister and frequent collaborator, Joan Cusack) and her son while he finished out high school in Seattle. On the cusp of graduation, he, a man whose interests are loud music and kickboxing, decides to ask out Diane Court (Ione Skye), his school’s valedictorian and a girl he has convinced himself that he had a first date with already (they ate across from one another at a mall). When she decides to go with him to the annual graduation bash held at the same guy’s house (an almost unrecognizable Eric Stoltz), he has pulled off a major coup. When asked how this “happened”, Diane says,”He made me laugh.” See boys, every girl, even smart ones who are hot love a sense of humor.\n\nThe two hit it off and Lloyd makes it his task to be with Diane as much as a he can before she leaves for England on a prestigious fellowship. This, of course, rubs her father (John Mahoney) the wrong way as he wants her thoughts to be on the fellowship and accomplishing what she has set out to do with her life since she was 5 – BE GREAT. Lloyd, to him, is just a distraction.\n\nWhen Mr. Court finds out he is under investigation by the IRS for tax fraud, her attention is clearly not on her studies and fellowship, so Lloyd provides much needed distraction from her problems at home. Of course the two have sex and it christens their relationship. Even Lloyd’s best friends, Cory (Lily Taylor) and D.C. (Amy Brooks), believe they are destined for greatness. Since Diane and her father are so close, she tells him everything and she lets him know they slept together. But sneaky as he is, he finds a way to get them to break up, which devastates Lloyd who, in turn, goes searching for answers. Figuring he needs to spend more time with guys, he finds them…at the Gas & Sip:\n\nHe clearly doesn’t find what he’s looking for and flips out leading to perhaps the funniest part of the whole film:\n\n“Lloyd, Lloyd, all null and void…” – is there a better opening to a rap song ever (well, besides Wu Tang‘s “Triumph”)? Lloyd struggles to understand why she cut him loose…and left him with only a pen.\n\nDespite his best efforts to keep from doing so, he pursues Diane in an attempt to win her back. Without a doubt, this pursuit created the most iconic image and scene of the film – Peter Gabriel‘s “In Your Eyes” and a boombox at dawn. You know what I’m talking about – it’s been aped and repurposed a million times over by now. Damn it. Cusack and Crowe, you bastards. Not only did you create arguably the most romantic scene of 80s high school films, but you set expectations of women for the next one hundred years so high that no one man possibly reach them. Every Jane, Amy and Jenny now expect grand gestures such as these when, at no fault of our own, men wish to win our loves back after some hasty break-up caused by the girls’ shifty, criminal fathers. Shame on you. Get on the same team.\n\nCouple this with Cusack‘s subsequent role in 2000’s High Fidelity where Rob Gordon, via Nick Hornby‘s novel and Cusack and friends who wrote the script, allows women behind the curtain of the male psyche giving away nearly all of our secrets. You’re killing me, Johnny.\n\nAll that aside, Say Anything is one of the few films I ever watched with my grandma because it has that broad of an appeal. And she loved it. I could break down how it all plays out, but that shorts you from watching it for the first time or revisiting it, which is still a treat. Cusack made the leap from goofball king from his time in the Savage Steve Holland films Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer to bona fide beau hunk in one film. He seemed to come back from time to time to tap this well over the course of his career (which has all but ended to me with High Fidelity), he had chosen more obscure fare for the most part (Being John Malkovich, anyone?). Now, it just seems like he’s drawing a paycheck. Like I said, your all-American boy.\n\nNevertheless, Say Anything remains one of the more cherished films, for it’s sentiment more than anything, of my high school/teen years. You would do well to watch it. Cusack demonstrates why he was once one of the more sought after young actors in the biz. Fair play to you, John.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nJohn Hughes would have been 63 today. His death in 2009 shocked me even though he had been out of the public eye for years and hadn’t directed a film since Curly Sue in 1991. Hughes was the absolute MAYOR of the 80s. His youth/teen films raised the bar for the genre and, in my opinion, have yet to be eclipsed. But he was more than just a teen film director. His adult comedies were as pertinent as anything he did in the teen realm, echoing the same themes of acceptance and understanding all while bringing the funny sprinkled with moments of levity.\n\nHughes‘ films are important to me. I hold them as dear to my heart as any film(s) that I’ve ever seen. I saw Weird Science at the Rivoli Theater in downtown Muncie, Indiana, when my parents were in court over visitation rights. I couldn’t imagine a better way to have staved off the nervousness I felt that day. I happily recall watching Sixteen Candles with friends, rewinding about a hundred times the scene where Anthony Michael Hall is dancing with Molly Ringwald and farts, laughing equally hard each time. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off may or may not have been the inspiration for my own two-week school skipping streak in 7th grade. These films helped me with the rough road through adolescence, showing me that insecurity, dysfunction and all of the other problems of youth were the norm, not the exception. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling that and I believe that’s why his films resonated so well then and continue to do so to this day.\n\nI have been trying to rack my brain and I can’t think of another filmmaker that had a run of success in such a short time as John Hughes did from 1983-1987. As prolific as Rainer Werner Fassbinder was (is this the first time Hughes and Fassbinder have been mentioned together, I wonder?), I don’t think he even put up the resume that Hughes has. Woody Allen has had some good runs in his life, but none quite so strong as Hughes. Let’s take a look at the the films that Hughes either wrote or wrote/directed in this time period:\n\nMr. Mom (1983) – wrote\n\nNational Lampoon’s Vacation (1983) – wrote\n\nNate & Hayes (1983) – wrote (I had never heard of this one)\n\nSixteen Candles (1984) – wrote and directed\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1984) – wrote and directed\n\nNational Lampoon’s European Vacation (1984) – wrote\n\nWeird Science (1985) – wrote and directed\n\nPretty in Pink (1986) – wrote\n\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) – wrote and directed\n\nSome Kind of Wonderful (1987)- wrote\n\nPlanes, Trains & Automobiles (1987) – wrote and directed\n\nBy my count, that’s 11 films, eight of which represent some the most well-known and iconic films of the decade. Hughes only directed three other films past this period – She’s Having a Baby, Uncle Buck and Curly Sue – all fair films, I suppose, but none match the beloved status of the bulk of the list above. While he continued to write mostly family films (Home Alone series, Beethoven series) for years after pulling his best Keyser Söze (And like that, poof. He’s gone), he never quite captured the magic he had from 83-87. That’s a pretty tall order in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAs is the norm, here are my 5 (cheated, really 6) favorite works to which John Hughes contributed and why they still rock:\n\n5) Mr. Mom (tie)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal just declared the caricature of inept stay-at-home dads depicted in Mr. Mom dead just a couple of weeks ago. However, the appeal of this movie still endures. Michael Keaton‘s portrayal of Jack Butler, the former GM engineer who lost his job and now stays home with the kids, is incredibly funny and I believe was probably pretty spot on for the time. I was raised by my father and I can certainly say that he was far more able to raise three kids than poor Jack, but this would seem more the exception rather than the rule. I think that’s why this is so enjoyable for me as it gives me an insight to what my childhood could have been like with a more maladroit father. Keaton is loveable despite his cringe worthy displays. For example:\n\nAll this aside, this film was pretty groundbreaking. Showing a woman, Caroline (played magnificently by Terri Garr), who is out in the workforce while the children are at home, succeeding and moving up the corporate ladder? I can’t recall a single film like it at the time. And as is typical, Hughes gives his characters some really great, memorable lines:\n\nIf Mr. Moms are indeed dead, then I’m glad we will always have this record to remind us of their haplessness. For that, John Hughes, I say thank you.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\n5) National Lampoon’s Vacation (tie)\n\nThe first in the Vacation series by National Lampoon, and undoubtedly the best, Hughes adapted a short story he wrote while working for advertising/public relations firm Leo Burnett (you can read it here) to start the journey of the Griswolds on-screen. Hughes seems to be especially hard on fathers in his films, and this one is no exception. Released in the same year (1983) as Mr. Mom, they seem to be perfect companion pieces to one another.\n\nAs most everyone knows, this movie follows the Griswold family – Clark (Chevy Chase), Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo), Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) – as they traverse the country from Chicago to California on their way to Wally World, America’s Favorite Family Fun Park. Convinced that driving is the only way to travel, the Griswolds stop at roadside attractions as well as seeing some family. Randy Quaid makes his first appearance as white trash Cousin Eddie and is in fine form. After a series of car breakdowns, getting lost in the ‘hood of St. Louis, nearly getting arrested for animal cruelty, a dead aunt, and a near adulterous encounter, Clark glides the finally happy family into the parking lot of Wally World…only to find out that it’s closed for two weeks. The final punctuation on a road trip where not much else could have gone wrong. So, he takes matters into his own hands…\n\nAn homage to all shitty family road trips, National Lampoon’s Vacation hits the proverbial nail on the head. Even as stupid as Clark seems, he still has a the biggest heart and wants nothing but the best for his family. Unfortunately, he fucks it up every time, a motif that plays itself out over the course of the three other films in this series – European Vacation (without a doubt the absolute worst of the bunch – that Hughes had anything to do with this one makes me sad), Christmas Vacation and the awful Vegas Vacation, whose only saving grace is the appearance by Wayne Newton.\n\nFar and away the best part of this movie, I still laugh hysterically each time I see it:\n\nThe edited version for TV is nearly as funny: What I look like – Christopher Columbo?\n\nSo if you’re preparing to take the kiddos to Disney (as I am in May – God help me) or any other long road trip, give this one a watch and learn what not to do.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n4) The Breakfast Club\n\nThe quintessential 80s angst film, The Breakfast Club has comedic moments, but this one hits a closer to the bone than the rest of his films. Set in Saturday detention, five seemingly different high school students – a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), a freak (Ally Sheedy), a popular rich girl (Molly Ringwald), a popular wrestling star (Emilio Estevez) and a hood (Judd Nelson) – are charged with writing an essay telling the tyrannical Assistant Principal Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleeson) who they think they are. As the day progresses, the group of teens go back and forth, attacking one another, reconciling, telling each other their tales of why they are there. The more time they spend together, the more they realize they are alike.\n\nThis was one of the two films (St. Elmo’s Fire being the other) that spawned the term The Brat Pack and solidified Molly Ringwald‘s short-lived status as Hollywood’s “it-girl.” This of all of Hughes‘ films still seems to resonate the most, ring as the most timeless. These characters still exist in today’s high schools (watch Nanette Burstein‘s documentary American Teen for easy examples), so it’s no wonder why Hughes is/was the teenager’s poet laureate. Its anti-authoritarian message certainly helps.\n\nThe ending sequence is pretty unforgettable (pun intended), as Vernon reads the essay that the five left behind, Anthony Michael Hall narrating. That Simple Minds’ “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” plays over it (flush with a Truffaut-like freeze frame) really is the perfect accompaniment, an anthem that all high schoolers echo just wanting to be noticed.\n\nI always adored this moment. Even though I was only in fifth grade when this came out, it struck a chord. While I couldn’t know the rough waters I’d have to tread when in high school, this was a nice primer and one of the many reasons I cherish Hughes‘ oeuvre. I think it was this film that Hughes found his full voice as a writer. You could see traces his craft coming together in his previous films, but this is a fully realized work that melds the comedic and serious perfectly.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n3) Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\n\nIt doesn’t get much more iconic than Ferris Bueller. This movie drips cool, well…with the exception of Cameron’s (Alan Ruck) stupid ass Detroit Red Wings jersey. That sucks. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick‘s signature role) is the guy everyone wants to know in high school – friend to all, big and small, cool or not.\n\nWhen Ferris decides to fake being sick (who can be expected to go to school on a day like this?), an elaborate process that dupes his clueless parents, but not Vice Principal Edward R. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), Rooney decides to catch Ferris and make him an example, in order to show other students that the path Ferris has chosen is wrong. Thus unfolds an epic game of cat and mouse between Rooney, Ferris and Ferris’ girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara),best friend Cameron and his sister Jeanie/sometimes Shawna (Jennifer Grey).\n\nCameron is actually sick, but Ferris cons him into driving Ferris around for the day. Cameron is also a tight ass (if you stick a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you get a diamond) who needs to have some fun. So they embark on a journey for the ages, taking in the sites of Chicago and breaking through some barriers for each of the characters.\n\nIf you didn’t want to be Ferris Bueller in 1986, then I don’t know what to say about you. Who didn’t want to sing Wayne Newton and The Beatles on a float in a German parade through the streets of Chicago?\n\nIncidentally, I lost a bet to my mother on whether the person singing “Danke Schoen” was a man or a woman watching this movie the first time.\n\nThis is one of the most fun movies I’ve ever seen and may well be Hughes‘ finest creation. I think it, along with The Breakfast Club, is probably the most enduring as its themes are also universal. As Polonius said to Laertes in Hamlet: “This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.” I think Ferris followed this advice better than anyone. He never misrepresents himself to anyone he’s with, even to Rooney, and I think that’s why he’s such a relatable character. This was Hughes‘ biggest strength as a writer. It is evident in every film discussed here and why we are still talking about these films.\n\nShout out to Joshua Budich for the badass poster and Maxim Dalton for the killer board game image.\n\nI hope The rebelliousness of Ferris is alive and well among the youth of today. If not, you must be a bunch of boring bastards…\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n2) Sixteen Candles\n\nI’m not sure how I originally stumbled upon Sixteen Candles when I was a kid. I can’t remember if we just happened to pick it up at the video store (yes, kids, there used to be actual stores where you could go rent videos, not DVDs) or if we had seen some preview for it. I wasn’t exactly following certain directors’ work back when I was 9. Or was I? Nonetheless, this movie floored me with its humor, its depiction of family as insanely fucked up, and the hope that things you wish for may actually come true.\n\nThe story centers around Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald in her first real starring role) who turns 16. However, her birthday happens to fall on the day before her older sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) is getting married. Since her family is up to their eyes in wedding details, they forget that it’s Sam’s birthday. An obvious nightmare for anyone, let alone a girl on her sweet sixteen. The scene when she realizes this is perfection, truly setting up each of the family member’s characters in a short 45-second scene. Watch:\n\nSam has one more big issue in this film as well, and that’s Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). She has a crush on him, but he is the most popular guy in school, very rich and is dating the hottest girl in school, Caroline Mulford (Haviland Morris). When she passes a note that falls to Jake accidentally, he finds out about this. As she tries to make things happen with Jake, she is followed around by a geek and self-professed “king of the dipshits” named Ted (Anthony Michael Hall), who incessantly tries to pick her up. Couple all of this with being saddled with taking her grandparents foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe), to the school dance where Jake will be, and she’s got a lot on her plate.\n\nOne of the biggest successes of this film is that it is also Anthony Michael Hall‘s coming out party. He really established himself as a quality comedic actor in this film. He had obviously worked with Hughes material in National Lampoon’s Vacation before, so perhaps that was to his advantage. His character is so slimy, yet so endearing that you feel sorry for him. Also, he is the chief architect of a few of the film’s funniest scenes, e.g. when he and his friends (one being a young John Cusack) meet Long Duk Dong for the first time at Jake’s party, the aforementioned dance sequence, and when he takes a drunken/passed out Caroline to meet his friends in the middle of the night.\n\nBut ultimately, this is Samantha’s journey. We ride the roller coaster with her, and at times, it is difficult. The talk she has with her father (Paul Dooley) after he realizes they forgot her birthday was very real and quite spot-on. Or I imagine it is as I’ve never had this talk with a teenage girl or been a teenage girl, but Hughes situated it where I could empathize. Not an easy task. While this film has its share of juvenile humor (it is a film about high school after all), it has a heart and certain characters end up showing this even when you think that they aren’t able.\n\nThis is for you ladies:\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\n1) Weird Science\n\nSo this is number one. With a bullet. This may be one of the three funniest movies I’ve ever seen. A absolute riot from start to finish, this was kind of a surprise from Hughes who with Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club had added more drama to each film leading up to Weird Science. It’s juvenile, filled with raunchy humor and is a departure from the prior formula he employed. And it works. WELL. At least in my opinion. It is far and away the Hughes film that I watch most and that it why it grabbed spot #1 on this list.\n\nThe basic premise is two losers, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall in his finest role) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), can’t fit in. Picked on, abused by cooler kids, and ignored by all girls, they decide to build their own woman using Wyatt’s souped up computer while his parents are away for the weekend. They cull the most beautiful images from Playboy magazines, give her genius intelligence and finish the job by harnessing the electricity from a thunderstorm to give her life a la Dr. Frankenstein all while wearing bras on their heads (ceremonial). And BOOM! They have Lisa (Kelly LeBrock).\n\nSo it becomes Lisa’s mission to help make the guys transition from being nerds to cool. Not an easy process considering what she has to work with. She starts off with them in a night on the town, which quickly goes from bad to worse. But then, Gary hits his stride amid the funniest scene in the entire film. Watch:\n\nFats, man…let me tell you my story, man. Were funnier opening words to a story ever uttered? Methinks not.\n\nAnd let’s credit Hughes for maybe the best part of this film – the creation of Chet (Bill Paxton), Wyatt’s older brother and caretaker while his parents are away. Abusive and gross in every sense of the word, Chet represents what these two are up against every day of their lives. And Wyatt, chicken shit that he is, takes everything Chet has to give, served in a dirty ash tray. Chet extorts him and abuses him verbally and physically. But when Lisa enters the story, things start to change even with Chet. All that aside, I would argue that Chet is the second best movie character next to Reg Dunlop (Paul Newman) in Slap Shot. And Paxton‘s performance pretty much rules. Who else can say, “But first, I’d like to butter your muffin…” any slimier than he does? I dare you to find someone. DARE YOU.\n\nThe guys have their eyes on two girls, Deb (Suzanne Snyder) and Hilly (Judie Aronson) at school, but they happen to be dating Gary and Wyatt’s arch nemeses, Ian (a very young Robert Downey, Jr.) and Max (Robert Ruslan). Lisa decides to help the guys out and throw a BIIIIG party at Wyatt’s house and invite everyone. When the guys stay in bathroom, Lisa does what she can to coax them out and prove their meddle so Deb and Hilly will see them for who they are. This of course yields two of the funnier parts of the film, but it’s here they make their final transition from nerds to being not necessarily cool, but noticeable, shall we say.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have quite the same touching ending that both Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club have, Weird Science earns its ending. While Hughes moved on to more adult and family friendly fare after this (with exception of maybe Uncle Buck which treads some of the same water here), I’m so glad he squeezed this one in.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nSo as I said before, Hughes left a mark on my childhood – his films helped me navigate the unsteady times of adolescence. These films are signposts that me and many of my friends can point to as we continue to try and make our way through this world. Hughes‘ passing in 2009 was tragic because he gave voice to my generation. While he hadn’t spoken for it in quite some time, he still held that title when he died and I believe he continues to do so. There are rumors that one of his unproduced scripts in moving into production. PLEASE DON’T. Let the man rest. There is a reason that project went unproduced.\n\nI try to be as selective as I can be when watching movies. Between work and my family, my time is pretty well-occupied. I sacrifice a few things, mostly sleep, to watch as many films as I do and try as I may, a few shitty ones still make their way into my watching schedule. Here are what I feel are the five worst films I saw which were released in 2012. Now, I make it a point to not watch most of the wide-released studio fare, so you will not see the likes of Wrath of the Titans or Taken 2 or any of their kind on here. Not that I don’t believe that they are shitty, because they probably are. I saw the first of each of those series and they were awful, but I chose to stop the bleeding of my eyes there and not watch the new incarnations. So while it may not be an exhaustive list, it is nonetheless informed by my bulletproof opinion.\n\nSo here we go:\n\n5) Chronicle\n\nOne of the biggest problems I had with this film is that it had so much promise. Its premise, three high school kids gain superhuman powers after encountering an alien substance in a cave and struggle with what to do with the new power they wield, is extremely fertile ground for an interesting film. However, it quickly devolves into some moral battle between good and evil that is cliched and overdone. Perhaps its biggest issue is the faux found footage/documentary-style that was employed to show us the happenings of these character was so out of place and nonsensical, it was hard watch. As my colleague on this blog wrote, Chronicle “absurdly demands the audience to reconcile how some unnamed person found snippets of footage from dozens of mobile phones, TV news outlets and security cameras and edited them all together” to tell this story. In an effort to seemingly jump on the success of the Paranormal Activity films, the filmmakers of Chronicle overplayed their hand destroying any hope of a watchable film. The heavy-handedness in its comment on our society today being overly fascinated with itself enough to film every move we make, reflecting what we see in “reality” television (fucking Kardashians) was too much. Just let the kids destroy shit with their new powers. Is that too much to ask?\n\nI know Rotten Tomatoes has this film at 85% Fresh, but it just didn’t work for me. Bad choices by director Josh Trank (who is currently in production on the Fantastic Four reboot and rumored to be making the Spider-Man spinoff of Venom), sunk this film from its outset. Shame really. It had all the appearances of something interesting.\n\n4) Savages\n\nWhere do I begin with this one? I should have known better than to see anything with John Travolta in it. SIGH. Someday, I will learn. Once again, this storyline is tired with a little twist that is intended to make it not seem so: two guys, one a war vet another a business/botany genius, make the classic brains and brawn combo is running a marijuana growing and distribution business. They share a girlfriend together and when they are asked to join forces with a cartel from Mexico and refuse, the girl is kidnapped and used as leverage to make the men join. Obviously, the men fight to get her back and make the cartel pay for their transgressions. YAWN. A bad script taken from Don Winslow‘s novel of the same name doesn’t help things. Here’s Ophelia (Blake Lively) describing sex with Chon (possibly the worst f-ing character name ever – it is pronounced with a hard CH-, btw), the war vet (played by Taylor Kitsch) – “I had orgasms. He had wargasms.” SIGH. It’s no wonder Kitsch headlined a triumvirate of box office bombs this year (John Carter, Battleship and Savages) – the guy really can’t act. The plain awful ending seals the deal. Why it was chosen given the events leading to it I will never know. Supremely ineffective. I will say that Salma Hayek is delicious as drug kingpin, Elena, but this role was no stretch for her. This is Oliver Stone‘s worst film that I’ve seen.\n\n3) Friends with Kids\n\nThis one just sucked. I love Adam Scott and was blinded by his participation in this, but I should have known that since Jennifer Westfeldt was involved it was going to be bad. Her work in Kissing Jessica Stein (wrote and starred) was unfunny. Friends with Kids was no better. With most of the cast of Bridesmaids appearing, one might have thought this would be better. Nope. The story goes as this: two people who have been best friends forever decide to cut all of the bullshit out that goes into a marriage and have a kid together (because all of their friends are) but not be romantically involved. Of course, Julie (Westfeldt) falls for Jason (Scott) and he doesn’t feel the same. SIGH (that’s three now in this post). That is until he realizes he does love her and has to be with her. Not even Scott, who plays a loathable character undeserving of anyone’s respect, can save this one. Just bad all around. Chris O’Dowd and Maya Rudolph are this films only saving grace, but they seem to be nothing more than a device to level out everyone else’s assholishness in the film. If anyone who watched this wanted to become a parent or get married afterward, I would be shocked. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for either institution.\n\n2) Red Dawn\n\nI have already written extensively on why this movie is complete trash. Without a clear villain for the Unites States to have at the time of its making, this remake is superfluous fluff looking to capture heat from a few young stars (Josh Hutcherson and Chris Hemsworth) rather than give commentary on times in which we live. When the original Red Dawn was released in 1984, we were still in the thick, albeit the tail end, of the Cold War with a clearly defined enemy in the Communist nations of Russia and Cuba. It reflected thoughts and attitudes of the time. Does anyone really think the North Koreans are capable of not only invading the US, but wiping part of it out and controlling other parts? The motivation of the characters and the arc of their relationships with one another from the original are so watered down in this version it makes it nothing but laughable. The inclusion of the love story between Matt (Josh Peck) and Erica (Isabel Lucas) whores the intent of the its predecessor – that nothing is above duty to country in a time of war. The slapdash inclusion of Matt’s journey from selfish BMOC to paramilitary leader is its worse transgression and that speaks volumes. This is a 0 out of 10 if I’ve ever seen one. There is not one redeeming quality about this film. Not one.\n\n1) The Paperboy\n\nAfter watching this turd pile, I can only hope that many of the folks who were involved (Matthew McConaughey, John Cusack and even Nicole Kidman of whom I have never been a fan), needed a big paycheck. Otherwise, I see no reason that they participated. I understand why Zac Efron did it – he wants to shed his High School Musical innocent boy type-casting. Note to Zac: Stop trying. It isn’t going to work.\n\nDirector Lee Daniels, whose previous film Precious won two Academy Awards, proves that he is as inept as any director in the business. This film was so muddled and choppy, it was nearly impossible to follow. He has no touch for nuance and subtlety which is clear by the usage of the overexpository, annoying-ass voice over by the grossly miscast Macy Gray (stick to the music, honey). The performances are all weak, including Kidman‘s, which makes me wonder what the hell the Golden Globes and SAG saw in it. Her hyper-stretched, Joker-like face is getting tougher to watch. Her southern accent was worse. Nothing in this film worked on any level with me – the editing, score, the setting, the timeframe, the scene where Kidman pisses on Efron (well, that was kind of unintentionally amusing). Even why it was such an injustice that Van Wetter (Cusack) was convicted and in prison, a VERY vital point to the film, remains a mystery to me. This film is a mess and is very deserving of getting my Worst Film of 2012 Award.\n\nThere you have it. I hope that 2013 yields far less shitty films for my watching. May you also be blessed with only quality watching. Something tells me we’ll be back here pow-wowing again, describing what tripe we suffered our way through. Until then…\n\n“I just got off the phone with a very unsatisfied customer,” says Martin Blank’s (everyone’s lovable All-American guy John Cusack) secretary Marcella (played by Cusack‘s hilarious sister Joan). This is refrain you will become familiar with while watching George Armitage‘s dark comedy Grosse Pointe Blank. From the opening credits , we can see one thing about our protagonist – he is inept at what he does. And what does he do, you ask? Well, he is a liquidator, hatchet man, iceman. An assassin. And when I say inept, I don’t mean he can’t pull off the work. Martin is able to kill his marks, but the devil is in the details and this is where he fails most.\n\nAfter killing the target (another assassin) in the opening credits, the man he was protecting and his bodyguards are riddled with bullets shortly thereafter by Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), another rival assassin and Blank’s nemesis. This is the first glaring example of why Blank is so bad at his job. And make no mistake, this incident opens the film for a reason. It takes less than the opening credits for us to see that he is a fuck up. But he remains a fuck up in demand.\n\nIn addition to this bungled hit, in the first ten minutes we learn of or see two more colossal mistakes by Martin – accidentally killing a dog while trying to kill its master and his inability to make a hit look like the target died in his sleep (supposed to poison the target, but ended up shooting him). The latter incident prompts the unsatisfied customer comment above from Marcella. Because of this botched hit, Blank is dispatched to make amends and take out a federal witness in his almost hometown of Detroit. He hails from Grosse Pointe, which is an affluent suburb of The D…and is there the same time as his 10-year high school reunion.\n\nBlank returns home to attend the reunion and take care of some work at the same time. His skittish psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who pleads with him not to kill anyone for a while to see what it feels like. Martin has a dilemma. This is conplicated further when Martin reaches out to and rekindles his long lost romance with local radio DJ Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) whom he unceremoniously dumped her on Senior Prom Night to enlist in the army. With this revelation, we know Martin is flawed, exceedingly flawed, and it shows in every aspect of his life, but mostly in his work. After all, he is seeing a shrink and this was well before we ever saw Tony Soprano with his or those ridiculous Analyze This movies.\n\nSince Blank has “snaked the Detroit job” from under him and has refused to join his new guild of assassins (“more pay, less work”), Grocer colludes with federal ATF agents (Hank Azaria and K. Todd Freeman) to take Blank out of the picture. He gives them details of the hit he is supposed to undertake. They are to wait him out until he he does the deed so they can catch him in the act, but he uncharacteristically waits against the urgings of his assistant Marcella. So they are hung out to dry…for the time being. That Grocer even wants to do business with Blank at all is a miracle. He repeatedly mentions the Boudreau-blunder (the dog Martin accidentally killed) throughout the film, constantly highlighting and joking about Blank’s ineptitude. Are his advances towards Martin genuine? They seem to be, which makes us believe all killers-for-hire are really suckers. “That’s what I’m talking about, kid, we could be working together again, for God’s sake! You know, making big money, killing important people!” This is another reason why this film is so successful – it takes familiar conventions of a type of film and really does spin them. Who would hire either of these clowns?\n\nAs the nostalgia washes over Martin from being in his hometown, he gets soft. Or should I say softer. He lets his guard down, is more vulnerable than ever before (or so we can surmise). Is this a good thing? As far as business goes, no. On top of Grocer being in town as well as the ATF agents, another assassin, a Basque whacker from the Pyrenees, Felix LaPubelle (Benny Urquidez), has also been hired to take Blank out. After one explosive run-in at the Ultimart that was built where his childhood home used to be, their paths cross again at the reunion, almost immediately after Blank and Debi have re-consummated their relationship (in the nurses office to boot). One hell of a fight commences, it is only the pen that his friend Ken (the ever-awesome Carlos Jacott) gave him that saves his life after burying it in LaPubelle’s throat. So after being caught off guard, it is only the pen that saves him. Sloppy.\n\nThat Debi and his buddy Paul (Jeremy Piven when he was awesome) find out that Martin has killed Felix is another strike against him. Even though he is able to dispose of the body, with Paul’s help of course, there are still witnesses…and they live to possibly tell the tale. You can’t do that in this particular line of work, right? That Blank throughout the film tells people that he’s a professional killer, and no one believes him is funny and an indication of where we as a society stand with regards to this notion that people kill other people for a living.\n\nHere, check it (also one of my favorite parts of the movie):\n\nSo, at the end, the target of Martin’s hit (SPOILER) is Debi’s father (Mitch Ryan). So Martin has a choice – bury Mr. Newberry or give up the game. What do you think he does?\n\nEver since I saw Jean-Pierre Melville‘s Le Samouraï, I hold Jef Costello (Alain Delon) up to be the perfect archetype of a hitman. Blank clearly doesn’t fit the same mold. He has scruples, falls in love, undergoes existential crises – none of which you expect from a hitman who seem so immune to these realities we all face as humans. I love this movie and have since I saw it in the theater when it first came out. John Cusack is one of my all-time favorite actors (well, up to his work in High Fidelity) and he is very good in this film. Even though his character is just plain bad at his job, and we are told this over and over, I think that’s why this film works so well. I expect, like many probably do, a hitman to be a Jef Costello/cold-hearted killer and I’m pleasantly surprised when I get a Martin Blank who is a bundle of idiosyncrasies instead. While it all goes wrong for Blank in most cases, in the end it all goes right, for us as viewers and for him as a character. Is he the most inept film hitman of all-time? Maybe, maybe not. He certainly isn’t the most effective, but his story makes for a fun watch.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nAnd as of now, the entire film is available here for free:\n\nWatch. Enjoy.\n\nAs I was thinking about this list, I was surprised that I couldn’t really think of any dramas that were as quotable as comedies, specifically those of those of my youth. Perhaps it’s because we watched the comedies at least 10 times before we had to return the videotape back to the video store. You remember what those look like, right? Rewinding them was a bitch.\n\nWe all know that Casablanca has 145 incredibly famous, quotable lines. We can take This Is Spinal Tap and Slap Shot as a givens. Films like these are in the canon of quotable movies and will be passed over here. My wife said this list is more about me and people I hang out with than anything about quotable movies, and that if I really wanted to list quotable films, I would list things like When Harry Met Sally or other fluffy nonsense. While that she may be correct about this list, that ain’t happening, my love. You may be smarter than I am, but no one I know quotes movies like WHMS and the like so they will also be absent from this list of triple-delicious quotedom as well.\n\nI know there are many that would include Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy on this list. I can’t understand why people like it. I thought it was a piece of shit. I posted about it here if you’re interested in my one sentence review.\n\nSo, that said, here are the five films that I believe to be the most quotable from my vast movie watching experience:\n\n5. Clerks\n\nKevin Smith‘s raucous and raunchy debut Clerks was a revelation at the time of its release. At least to me. Living in southern Indiana at the time, we were only used to getting big blockbuster fare and romantic comedies. So when I talked three friends into going to see it with me (reluctantly), we were all bowled over by its expletive-laden dialogue and its, truth be told, frank portrayal of the lives of two convenient store-working slackers, Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). Perfect combination for the time it was released. One of the funniest theater experiences of my life. Say what you will about Smith and his films, but I love this one.\n\nThe Quotability Factor (QF) on this film is pretty high. Some of the highlights:\n\nDante: “My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks” Customer: “In a row?”\n\nRandal: “I’m a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.”\n\nJay (Jason Mewes): What’s up babes? What’s up, sluts?\n\nDante: “Are there any balls down there?” Jay: “About the biggest pair you’ve ever seen, dingleberry!”\n\nDante: “I’m not even supposed to be here today!”\n\nJay: “I don’t care if she’s my cousin or not, I’m gonna knock those boots again tonight.”\n\nRandal: “I don’t appreciate your ruse, ma’am.” Customer: “I beg your pardon?” Randal: “Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nIt’s raw, low-budget and flawed, but it’s still wonderful and continues to make me laugh this very day.\n\n4. Better Off Dead\n\n1985, the year of “The Super Bowl Shuffle” and Gorbachev’s ascendency, might have been the best year ever for quotable films, three of which appear on this list. The Goonies, Fletch, and The Breakfast Club were all released in 1985 and don’t make this list. Better Off Dead also was released in 1985, the first of the ’85ers to hit my list at #4.\n\nBetter Off Dead is pure 80s goodness. Completely bizarre and super depressing if you think about what Lane Meyer (played by John Cusack at his absolute finest) puts himself through. BoD follows Lane as he falls from being a mid-level ski jock at his high school in Vermont, dating a hot girl whom he loved very much, only to have it all come crashing down when the aptly named Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier) comes to the school, steals his girl Beth (Amanda Wyss) and his spot on the ski team. Lane then tries to kill himself in various different ways to cope with the pain, stopping before the act is committed. All that changes when French foreign exchange Monique (Diane Franklin) moves into the house next door.\n\nThis movie has a supporting character that easily rivals all other supporting characters in quotability and general awesomeness – Charles De Mar (played by Curtis Armstrong also known for his role as Booger in the Revenge of the Nerds movies).\n\nThe QF for this film rates high, chock full of memorable moments. The great quotes come from a range of folks, from the main players to even the most ancillary characters. Here’s a taste:\n\nMailman (Taylor Negron): Hey Badger, your book on how to pick up trashy women came today. What’s a little boy like you doing with big boy smut like this?\n\nCharles De Mar: “The K-12 dude. You make a gnarly run like that and girls will get sterile just looking at you.”\n\nTree Trimmer (Steven Williams): “Now that’s a real shame when folks be throwin’ away a perfectly good white boy like that.”\n\nAl Meyer (David Ogden Stiers): “I know it’s bacon… but what have you done to it?”\n\nCharles De Mar: “Do you have any idea what the street value of this mountain is?”\n\nLane Meyer: “No, tentacles. N-T. There’s a big difference.”\n\nRoy Stalin: “You’d make a fine little helper. What’s your name?” Charles De Mar: “Charles De Mar.” Roy Stalin: “Shut up, geek.”\n\nJohnny Gasparini (Sebastian Dungan): “I want my two dollars!”\n\nCharles De Mar: “Man, you’re the hottest thing since sunburn!”\n\nLane Meyer: “Which is better, speaking no English at all, or speaking Howard Cosell?”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nBetter Off Dead is a tasty 80s treat. It hasn’t aged as well as some films and the humor probably is a little goofy compared to today’s standards. However, if taken as an artifact, it’s incredibly insightful, funny and wonderful. And the soundtrack is INCREDIBLE. All the Howard Jones you can get your hands on.\n\n3. Weird Science\n\nWhere do I begin with this one? This is my favorite of the John Hughes films, which is a large statement given the run of absolute comedy/quotable gold he was on in the middle to late 80s. The first time I saw Weird Science was at the Rivoli Theater in Muncie, IN – a magical theater that is long gone unfortunately. Another ’85er on the list.\n\nWeird Science tells the story of two high school losers, Gary Wallace (played by Hughes all-star Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), guys who are picked on, ridiculed and bullied. Since they are the anti-Spanish Fly with women, they decide to make their own woman when Wyatt’s parents are out of town. When they are successful, Lisa (played by Kelly LeBrock who undoubtedly caused massive amounts of carpal tunnel for young men in the mid-80s) tries with all of her powers to make them cool. Wyatt’s prickish older brother Chet (Bill Paxton in a game changing role, one of the absolute best in any Hughes film) does his best to thwart their attempts.\n\nThe QF for this film is off the charts. Age plays a role in this one falling to #3, but, truth be told, it can hold its own on any given day in quoteworthiness. Gary Wallace could sneak to the top of the list of most quotable characters should one ever surface. Take that Rick Blaine! The other star of the show is Chet. Just an amazingly awful, gross, loathsome character, but one I cherish to this very day.\n\nTake a look:\n\nGary: “There are chicks outside and you’re dropping wolf bait!”\n\nChet: “You’re stewed, buttwad!”\n\nThe absolute best scene in the entire film, all of it quote worthy:\n\nWyatt: Gary, don’t you feel like a chicken? Gary: Wyatt, if I could shoot an egg out my ass right now, I would! Look we can deal with shame, death is a much deeper issue.”\n\nGary: “Why don’t you shut up, bitch?”\n\nChet: “But first I’d like to… butter your muffin.”\n\nGary: “Then bang! We hit the city baby, dead on! For a little drinks, a little night-life, dancing.”\n\nAl Wallace (Brit Leach): “Soir-what?”\n\nLisa: “This is a Pershing missile, Chip!” Chet: “It’s Chet…my name is Chet! And I didn’t think it was a whale’s dick, honey!”\n\nChet: “The boozehounds return. What a joke!”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nJohn Hughes had a talent that is hard to match. I miss him everyday. Watch this movie and laugh your ass off. You won’t regret it.\n\n2 Swingers\n\nI still recall when my older brother called me out of the blue and said no matter what I do, I can’t miss Swingers should it play near me. He said there was one part, he didn’t need to tell me which, that he knew I would literally be on the floor laughing when it happened. I had never heard of it and kept my eyes peeled, and when it did come to my college town, I jumped all over it. It was an amazing experience, and one that I will give full credit to my brother for keying me into. More about that incredible scene in a few.\n\nSwingers is a tale that revolves around a group of friends who have moved to LA to try and make it in Hollywood. Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the script), Trent (Vince Vaughan in his breakout role), Rob (Office Space‘s Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn) and Charles (Alex Desert) all vie for various acting jobs and try to portray the cool of the Rat Pack at the same time. Mike, however, is still trying to get over his girlfriend dumping him six months prior. His friends rally around him to get him back in the game…with mixed results. Written with crackling dialogue, Swingers rewrote cool for the 90s.\n\nThe QF for Swingers is second only to one other film in my opinion. Here are plenty of examples as to why that is:\n\nMike: “You ever been to the Ha-Ha Hole?”\n\nTrent: “Baby, we’re going to be up five hundy by midnight!”\n\nRob: “You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi. The natives look restless.”\n\nMike: “And it’s like I’m supposed to be all happy ’cause she’s wearing a backpack, you know?”\n\nTrent: “Look, you take yourself out of the game, you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course its going to end up on the friendship tip.”\n\nMike: “Haven’t you seen Boyz in tha Hood? Now one of us is gonna get shot!”\n\nCharles: “This place is dead anyway.”\n\nTrent: “Hey! What’re you kicking me for? You want me to ask? All right, I’ll ask! Ma’am, where do the high school girls hang out in this town?”\n\nMike: “Well…we’re not in Kansas anymore…”\n\nThis is the scene of which my brother was speaking:\n\nAs soon as the organ music from Sega’s NHL ’94 started, I immediately was in tears because I knew what was coming. One of the best scenes in any movie. EVER. My cousin’s special ladyfriend even made this for me recently:\n\nTrent: “Baby you are so money and don’t even know it.”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nTrent is clearly the star of the show. He is responsible for probably 85% of all quoteworthy moments in the film. It’s a shame that Vaughan hasn’t been able to recapture the magic from this film in any of his others. Nonetheless, Swingers is one of the finest comedies of its day and will remain quotable for years to come.\n\nAnd now the drum roll….\n\n1. The Big Lebowski\n\nSo here it is – the Holy Grail of all quotable movies: The Coen Brothers‘ The Big Lebowski. For a film that did very modestly at the box office, especially in contrast with their prior release Fargo, The Big Lebowski has one of the biggest followings of any movie in history. Outside of sci-fi franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek, how many films have spawned their own yearly festival? Can’t be that many.\n\nI doubt many don’t know what The Big Lebowski is about, but for those of you who are not privy to all the new shit, here’s the story: Arguably the laziest man alive, Jeff Lebowski, more widely known as The Dude (Jeff Bridges), is confused for another Jeffrey Lebowski by a pair of thugs. The other Jeffrey Lebowski is a well respected businessman and millionaire whose wife owes the thugs’ boss, porn-king Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), money and they have come to collect mistaking The Dude for the rich Lebowski. After rolling his apartment and roughing The Dude up, Woo (Phillip Moon) pisses on the rug in The Dude’s living room, which really tied the room together. The Dude decides, after consulting his cohorts, the high strung Vietnam veteran Wlater Sobchak (John Goodman) and the more docile Donnie (Steve Buscemi), to approach the other Lebowski to be remunerated for the pissed-on rug in the case of mistaken identity. After being thrown out and taking a rug from the residence, The Big Lebowski and his toady Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) call The Dude and ask him to help them find The Big Lebowski’s wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), as she’s been kidnapped. Hijinks, misunderstandings, accidents and interpretive dances occur as The Dude tries to figure out what really happened with Bunny and at the same time keep his johnson intact.\n\nThe QF for The Big Lebowski is immeasurable since nearly every line has probably been said in thousands of different situations in every corner of the world. The Coen Brothers have always been known for their incredible writing talent, but it’s clear that this is their greatest triumph…at least when it comes to being quoted. Many of their films could make this, but Lebowski is the one that rules them all.\n\nThere are so many quotes I’d like to list here, but I will drop only a small handful. Enjoy them:\n\nThe Dude: “Nice marmot.”\n\nWalter: “Saturday, Donny, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest. That means that I don’t work, I don’t drive a car, I don’t fucking ride in a car, I don’t handle money, I don’t turn on the oven, and I sure as shit *don’t fucking roll*!\n\nThe Dude: “He thinks the carpet pissers did this?”\n\nWalter: “Is this your homework, Larry?”\n\nBunny: “Uli doesn’t care about anything. He’s a nihilist. The Dude: “Ooh, that must be exhausting.”\n\nThe Dude: “Careful, man, there’s a beverage here!”\n\nThe Jesus (John Turturro): Let me tell you something, pendejo – you pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I’ll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger ’til it goes Click!”\n\nWalter: “Smokey – this is not ‘Nam, this is bowling. There are rules…”\n\nThe Dude: “Nothing is fucked here, man.”\n\nMaude (Julianne Moore): “Don’t be fatuous, Jeffrey.”\n\nThe Dude: “How are you gonna keep ’em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus?”\n\nDonnie: “They were Nazis, Dude?” Walter: “Oh come on, Donnie – they were threatening castration. Are we gonna split hairs here?”\n\nThe Dude: “You mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.”\n\nWalter: “Oh, please, dear? For your information, the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!”\n\nKarl Hungus (Peter Stormare): “My name is Karl. Ich bin Expert.”\n\nThe Dude: “Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man.”\n\nWalter: “Hell, I could get you a toe by 3 o’clock this afternoon…with nail polish.”\n\nThe Dude: “Well…that’s just, like uh, your opinion, man.”\n\nWalter: “You are entering a world of pain.”\n\nI could actually keep going on and on and on. The Big Lebowski is a cornucopia of quotations applicable in almost any situation (“This aggression will not stand, man!” and that is why it rests atop Quotable Mountain.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\nIf you have a Netflix account, you are blessed with being able to watch this film as many times as your heart desires as it’s available through their streaming service. And do so. It will make you a better person in the end.\n\nSo that wraps up the official list. Five great films, as quotable as any of the classics. Sally forth and quote away!\n\nBelow, I have listed three films that didn’t quite make the list, but have quote values that are still high.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nThis film covers the trials and tribulations of high school life in a California community. Written by Cameron Crowe, this is one of the more quotable 80s comedies. Jeff Spicoli (played by a young Sean Penn) is a quotable powerhouse: “This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there.” and “My dad’s a tv repairman. He has an ultimate set of tools. I can fix it.” are among his finest.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nMenace II Society\n\nThe only drama to appear on any part of this list, Menace II Society is a serious observation on the tough life of inner city kids living in the projects and the decisions that they have to make each day to survive. I saw this film when I was a senior in high school and equate it to hearing N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton for the first time. It opened an entire world to me of which was previously unknown. Unflinching in its portrayal, the dialogue was key to the understanding of the characters’ situations. “I had the dope ride, but I was sittin’ on some bullshit. I needed rims bad…and I knew just how to get ’em” So as people took to quoting The Godfather and Scarface, my friends and I took to quoting Menace.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nReal Genius\n\nReal Genius would likely have been #6 on my most quotable films list. Val Kilmer plays one of the all-time best movie characters in super-genius Chris Knight, who takes super-nerd Mitch (Gabriel Jarret) under his wing as he arrives at Pacific Tech University after leaving high school early. They clash with Prof. Gerry Hathaway (William Atherton) and his toady Kent (Robert Prescott) while working on a secret project for the military. When they find out what they were working on, they decide to exact revenge with the help of all their brainy friends.\n\nThe QF of this film is extremely high. The Knight character just kills it:\n\n“In the immortal words of Socrates…I drank what?”\n\n“Was it a dream where you see yourself standing in sort of sun-god robes on a pyramid with a thousand naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you?”\n\nAnd then there is Prof. Hathaway’s all-time great quote: “You’re laborers, you’re supposed to be laboring. That’s what you get for not having an education.”\n\nAnd last but not least, let’s not forget perhaps the best line of the film:\n\nSusan Decker (Deborah Foreman): “Can you hammer a 6-inch spike through a board with your penis?” Chris: Not right now. Susan: A girl’s gotta have her standards…\n\nAn incredibly funny film chock full of quotable moments. It is another of the ’85er films, cementing it as the greatest year in quotable film.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\nEveryone has their own list of these films. Watch them, enjoy them, pass them along to your friends. This is the great thing about watching movies – nearly everyone can relate to something in them."
