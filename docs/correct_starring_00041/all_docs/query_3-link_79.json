Well, it is now being reported that John Cusack is set to star in the film which finally has a finished screenplay.\n\nScreen Daily is reporting that John Cusack (2012, Hot Tub Time Machine) has signed up for presumably the lead role in the long gestating adaptation of Cell. According to the site, \"New York and LA-based Cargo Entertainment arranged financing on Cell and president of distribution Mark Lindsay will introduce what is expected to become one of the buzz titles of the AFM to international buyers.\" Many fans of Stephen King have been left unhappy with how the various adaptation of his work have been altered during their transition to the big screen, so it should come as a relief to learn that he co-wrote the screenplay alongside The Last House On The Left's Adam Alleca. \"I’m thrilled to be working with Stephen and John again,\" said Dimension Films president of production Richard Saperstein. \"Cell is an intelligent psychological thriller that delivers on both a visceral and emotional level.\"\n\nArtist Clayton Riddell had been in Boston negotiating a successful deal to sell his comic book project. His joy at finally hitting it big is shattered by an event called The Pulse which causes all those who were using their cell phones at the time of The Pulse to become zombies attacking and killing anyone in their way. Fortunately for Clay, he does not own a cell phone. In the panic to get out of Boston and find his way home to his wife and son in Maine, he is joined by Tom McCourt, a man he meets in the meleé immediately following The Pulse and a young girl, Alice, who they rescue from being killed by one of the \"crazies.\" The story follows their terrifying journey, avoiding capture—and worse—by the \"crazies\" who are beginning to \"flock\" and are led by one they call Raggedy Man as they attempt to reach Maine and a place called Kashwak which they hope will be their salvation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: ComicBookMovie.com is protected under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and...
