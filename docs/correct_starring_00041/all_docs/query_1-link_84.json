        "text": "Watching movies on trains is a beautiful experience. Actually, doing just about anything on trains is a beautiful experience. By anything, I obviously don’t mean your basic bodily functions, but things that make you think, things that make you feel. And also doing them alone. So meeting people on trains, and sharing an experience with them, though admittedly enjoyable for some, seem forced to me. You don’t compulsively need to talk to the people around you to kill time. Okay, maybe you do ‘kill’ time that way, but I have no qualms with time so I’d rather spend it with myself.\n\nWhich is what I’m doing right now. I finished watching two incredibly romantic movies, and I’m quietly reflecting on them having drawn the curtains and completely isolated myself. Watching Sleepless in Seattle and Serendipity back to back alone on a train wouldn’t seem normal to a lot of people. In fact, they might think I’m a tub of chocolate ice-cream and a couch away from being a depressed, wishful old maid or fat girl – who’s just broken up. But no, I’m a guy, at a more-or-less stable state in life, who’s watched two very good movies. So why’d I watch them back to back? I don’t know, something came over me.\n\nSo I love both the movies, in a lot of different ways and a lot in the same. Sleepless in Seattle is a movie of touching innocence, carried through by two actors who could spend an entire 3 hours just peeling bananas on a kerb while talking and we would still enjoy it. On the other hand, what makes Serendipity enriching is the concept behind it: A series of fortuitous accidents that leads us to our destiny. And it is a happy destiny, this. Both movies are set in New-York, both the movies make unsubtle references to stars all through, both the movies have fate-finding-your-love as the central driving force, both movies have very romantic soundtracks (featuring Louis Armstrong) and both the movies have very charming supporting actors who guide the leads in their quest for the one true love.\n\nLets start with Sleepless in Seattle. There have not been two other actors in the history of American cinema more adored than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. He is the single-most prolific actor of the 21st century, while she seems to have been made for rom-coms. The perfect blend of goofiness, wit, dramatic chops and utter cuteness make her a safe bet for any movie in that genre. Remember When Harry Met Sally? Yes, we adore Billy Crystal, but she was the real star of that movie. And she shines through this one, making us empathize for her character, as she acts as irrationally as a woman in love, would. And hey, don’t chastise me for being sexist, that’s the movie! Directed by Nora Ephron, it takes countless shots at women’s idea of romance, what with the scenes where the girls in the movie cry over An Affair to Remember and the men just gape. And other ones where Meg Ryan is the one embarrassedly bonking her way from place to place spying Tom Hanks. But that is justified, as the initial efforts from Mr. Hanks’ ends are made by his son in the movie, Jonah, essayed heart-warmingly by Ross Malinger (who now works as an Automotives manager!). He makes for a wonderful supporting act, lending the movie with just the right amount of innocence. His presence makes the story more believable, and it is a strategically well-written part. And his conversations with his father make for some of the funniest lines as well, you really do laugh out loud! As everyone knows, the most endearing part about the movie is the absolutely negligible contact the leads have prior to their finally meeting on top of the Empire State building. And even then, they just hold hands to supplement the longing-feeling that the audience feels by this point. It is a complete love story, mind you, but we feel the love, we don’t see it. No other movie has achieved this to the degree that this one does.\n\nNow on the other side, Serendipity evokes mixed reactions in the audience. Some find the idea behind it appalling, and some say it depicts romance exactly how it should be. No, it is not a very realistic story but is that the point? The fact that such a story translated to the big screen would mean that there is something special about it, and it is not meant to be compared to the rigors of daily life. It is a unique proposition, therefore it is a movie. I, for one, find the idea that destiny leads you to your ‘soulmate’ through a series of happy accidents as one that I want to believe in, and not necessarily one I do. But there is not much substantive difference there, I admit. The movie engaged me primarily because of three reasons – John Cusack (one of my favourites), Jeremy Piven (who I think is the prefect on-screen best friend) and yes, you guessed it, the serendipity involved! The funniest part of the movie is one where all three of these combine to a rollicking effect. The scene outside the bridal shop right beside the café, despite being played over-the-top by Cusack and Piven, made me laugh like I hadn’t in a long time. Cusack has all but given up hopes of finding his soulmate, and Piven has to convince him that he still must go on.\n\nJonathan: It’s not a clue. It’s a sign.\n\nDean: What’s the difference?\n\nJonathan: A clue is what a detective uses to find a suspect.\n\nThe receipt, the warehouse, that French guy—those are clues. This is a sign. Me never finding the book, that’s a sign. Sara never finding the $ bill, that’s a sign.\n\nDean: How could something not happening be a sign?\n\nJonathan: Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.\n\nIsn’t it?\n\nDean: That’s lucid.\n\nIt is traditional rom-com fare, yes. But it approaches the idea with such sincerity, that you’re willing to forgive that. It is a movie full of nice people, doing nice things (actually, both of them are. Wow!) Maybe sometimes, you want your movies to be made of such people and moments? Kate Beckinsale plays ‘nice’ very well. This movie differs from the one above through the fact that the endeavour to reach each other is made equally by the two leads. Both of them keep looking out for the book and dollar-bill containing each others’ contact numbers. He runs around for her in the beginning, and she, in the end. It is a team effort! Look at me, mocking the movie when I would actually root for it when someone takes a dig. But no, I sincerely do like the movie, in all its respects. It’s a wonky one to write about, is all. It flows well when you watch it, I assure you.\n\nSo, bottom line, can only hopeful romantics enjoy these movies? More importantly, are only girls allowed to be hopeful romantics? Nah. And Nah. But it does help, yes! Maybe my experience of watching them was supplemented by being on a lonely train to the point that I extolled them to point of idiocy. Or maybe I had watched both these movies twice before and still enjoyed them, as I yearned for the now-forgotten titillation that comes with prolonged attraction. Who can tell!\n\nA Note: This is only the first part of the list, containing my thoughts about ten of the twenty movies I picked. I intend to publish the second list in 2 weeks time. And over time, to write more on each of these gems.\n\nAlso, 5 of the movies listed below originally appeared in my contribution to the Hindu column, ‘My Five’ : http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article3555361.ece\n\nRob: …I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like… Books, records, films – these things matter. Call me shallow but it’s the fuckin’ truth.\n\nLaura: So you’ve got a list here of 5 things you’d do if qualifications and time and history and salary were no object.\n\nRob: Yeah.\n\n1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: From the brilliant mind of Michael Gondry came this brilliant sci-fi/ romantic movie where the director pulled off a coup of sorts casting such diametrically opposite actors as Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in the title roles. Fans of Carrey are bound to be stunned by their favourite actor’s turn as a solemn, brooding character in this very memorable film about forgetting people. An estranged couple attempt to erase each other from their memories but begin to cherish their relationship during the process of their loss. It’s a passionate flick with some brilliant writing by Charlie Kauffman, the eclectic writer who was earlier criticized of churning up synthetic characters. But in this movie, he gets the emotional quotient just right. Ultimately, the fervent cinematographic style of Gondry synthesizes with his aberrant screenplay to form my single most loved movie of all time.\n\n2.Milk: “How did he do it? How, for so many years, did Sean Penn get all those awards playing straight men?” This is what Robert De Niro had to say when the Academy Award nominations were being announced. And it was a fair question. Sean Penn is a prodigious actor and he gave an absolute powerhouse performance in this breakthrough 2008 movie about the first openly gay politician in the American legislature. Gus Van Sant had famously worked on this one project for more than a decade. What finally came off was a stunningly beautiful movie with a most endearing narrative. Needless to say, the film delights and emotes in equal measure.\n\n3. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: Robert Downey Jr. seems to share the best of chemistries with his male co-stars. Cases in point being the Sherlock Holmes films and this capricious ’05 movie which starred Val Kilmer and Downey Jr. as a private eye and a thief masquerading as an actor respectively. It’s a movie filled with insane one-liners and some seriously funny exchanges amongst it’s leading men. Generally categorized in the crime/ dark comedy genre, it subtly parodies a number of American noir conventions. It has a categorically unique script and undoubtedly perfect casting but what makes this movie truly spectacular is one simple thing: the banter; throughout.\n\n4. Up: This gem of a movie by Pixar remains the only animated movie which brought tears to my eyes; and that too during it’s initial montage scenes. In a film that is widely considered to have one of the most moving screenplays ever written, Ed Asner’s voice is brilliantly employed for the grumpiest of lead characters who finds himself again during the course of this slickly timed film. Needless to say, a story about a man who ties thousands of balloons to his house in order to fly away and fulfill his dream of having a home next to the Paradise Falls could only have been brought to life sincerely by those amazing people over at Pixar.\n\n5. The Informant!: Matt Damon has been celebrated as a good actor with a keen eye for great scripts. He proves this point yet again in this 2009 comedy/ drama that chronicles the life of a man struggling with bi-polar disorder as he attempts to blow the whistle on his own company’s price-fixing tactics.A brilliant work of writing; it moulds the character’s stream of consciousness with an increasingly random style of commentary. It also boasts of some fine acting by the lead as well as the supporting actors. This is that sort of movie that you will want to rush back to watch again and comprehend in a wholly different light.\n\n6. High Fidelity: Nick Hornby’s classic High Fidelity finds a masterly adaptation in this 2000 movie directed by Stephen Frears. Starring one of my favourite actors of all time, John Cusack, it tells the story of an audiophile who recounts his ‘top-five breakups’ and tries to cope with the one in progress. Jack Black provides for some of the more laugh-out-loud moments in the movie where the real hero is the ingeniously assembled soundtrack. Like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this is the kind of movie I feel like going back to all the time. My 2nd most loved movie ever.\n\n7. Unbreakable: Twist endings, done right, are mind boggling. M. Night Shyamalan proves this point yet again with his follow up to the Sixth Sense. An eerily different take on the superhero concept, it stars Bruce Willis as a man who discovers that he has superpowers. Roger Ebert articulately described the theme of this movie as one dealing with the question, ‘What if Superman was on earth, and did not know he was Superman?’ Sam Jackson, as the other critical actor proves that he can be as cool as ever even outside The Matrix, when he’s falling down a flight of stairs and breaking all his bones, repeatedly.\n\n8. In Bruges: Troubled actor Collin Farrell finds his footing in this delightfully witty and wicked story about two professional killers sent to hide out in Bruges. It also stars Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes in marvelously felicitous roles, with the latter at his funniest best. The mood and serenity of the medieval city are captured beautifully in this highly underrated and nuanced film. Films like this one, and a few of the others listed really emphasize just how much genuinely well-cast actors can contribute to making a movie legendary.\n\n9. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off: John Hughes is generally regarded as one of the best makers of teenage movies, and he shows us why with this absolute masterpiece. Funny, witty and thought-provoking, Ferris Bueller takes us on a great ride, as it cheerfully mocks the fallacies of the educational system and explores the psyche of the youth. Matthew Broderick in the titular role makes for an immensely charming protagonist as he breaks the fourth wall continually. It may not be as sombre and path-breaking as The Breakfast Club but its wealth of sweet, innocent charm sweep you off your feet. How can you help but not fall in love with Sloane and Cameron, Ferris’s friends, when they wonder about what the future holds for all of them and decide that Ferris would ‘become a fly-cook at Venus’, just as he breaks into Twist and Shout amidst a parade.\n\n10. Glengarry Glen Ross: Who thought a sales related movie could generate so much suspense? Starring such veteran actors as Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin, this is one movie that refuses to let go of your guts till the last minute. It depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen as their corporate office ‘motivates’ them with threats of firing all but the top two salesmen by the end of the week. What ensues is a foray into the grimy world of real estate. And all the laurels heaped on Alec Baldwin for his portrayal of the foul-mouthed, vicious and pernicious corporate boss are thoroughly well deserved."
