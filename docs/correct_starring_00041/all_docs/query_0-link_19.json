        "text": "It would be nice to be able to say that the critics had taken a wrecking ball to Roland Emmerich's latest CGI disaster-fest with as much gusto as the German film-maker joyously destroys world famous landmarks like the Sistine chapel in his new offering. But after nigh on three hours of being blasted here, blown there and generally pummelled into drooling submission by the on-screen mayhem, most reviewers don't seem to have the energy to pull out the knives.\n\nReactions to 2012 tend to range from tepid surrender to the spectacular if eventually repetitive special effects work being done, to a sort of resigned horror at the sheer brazenness of the Hollywood blockbuster in 2009. Few are prepared to really shoot Emmerich's vision to smithereens: it seems that there's a grudging respect for a man who has found his niche, whether or not you appreciate his brutal, bullheaded corner of celluloid creativity.\n\nThe film, as you'll no doubt have read, focuses on the destruction of the world, as predicted by the Mayans and (apparently) various other ancient cultures since time immemorial, in December 2012. John Cusack plays pseudo-philosophical writer and limousine driver Jackson Curtis, who, believing devastation to be imminent, rushes to rescue his ex-wife and children so that they can escape from LA in a rented plane before the entire world turns upside down. It turns out that the authorities have known about the Earth's destruction since at least 2010, and a number of arks are being built in China in an effort to save the best (and richest) of humanity to allow civilisation to start all over again. The Curtis clan therefore set out for the far east in an effort to join the exodus.\n\n\"Emmerich tosses off towering infernos by the dozen in single shots, throws Poseidon-like ocean liners (and aircraft carriers) into maelstroms like toys in a bathtub, has entire cities levelled by quakes or swept away by tidal waves,\" writes Empire's Kim Newman. \"[2012 is] fundamentally terrible, but almost irresistibly entertaining. Its horrors get a tad monotonous in the mid-section, but it's still a value-for-money hoot.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is: The movie gives you your money's worth,\" opines Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. \"Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it one of the year's best? No. Does Emmerich hammer it together with his elbows from parts obtained from the Used Disaster Movie Store? Yes. But is it about as good as a movie in this genre can be? Yes.\"\n\n\"This is a wildly over the top anthology of disaster pictures old and new, and Emmerich isn't above recycling other people's ideas,\" writes out own Peter Bradshaw. \"But it's enjoyable and the opening CGI thrill-ride through the collapsing streets of Los Angeles is undeniably good.\"\n\n\"Thanks to a Â£160 million budget, the special effects are initially breathtaking,\" writes The Times' Kevin Maher. \"The destruction of Los Angeles, in particular, is rendered in terrifyingly precise detail. Unfortunately, the laws of diminishing returns soon set in, and by the time St Peter's Basilica crashes down on a thousand pious worshippers you can only gasp at the fact that there's still an entire interminable hour of increasingly empty spectacle yet to unfold.\"\n\n2012 is the kind of film where all the actors look like they've accidentally taken a stomach churning ride on a particularly vicious rollercoaster, and where people constantly say things like: \"This is going to sound crazy but here's what you have to do.\" In years to come it would not be surprising to find it studied in film school as the apotheosis of Hollywood big budget movie-making. It is certainly the archetype of style over substance: everyone on screen is a mirror of a mirror of a mirror of a character we've seen in the movies one hundred times before, but it matters not a jot as you sit in the cinema with your senses being enjoyably battered by ridiculously over-the-top spectacle upon spectacle. Emmerich should retire now as he has perfected his aesthetic."
