John Cusack leads the cast of the new film penned by Roland Emmerich and Harald Klose. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Glover, Peet and Platt – all of whom have been active on Broadway in the past few seasons – will co-star with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton. "2012" refers to the end of the Mayan calendar, which some believe may signify the coming of the apocalypse and the onslaught of various natural disasters. Cusack portrays a man attempting to better his life, while Peet has been cast as his ex-wife.

In addition to writing the screenplay, Emmerich directs and executive produces the film that is aiming for a July 2009 release.
