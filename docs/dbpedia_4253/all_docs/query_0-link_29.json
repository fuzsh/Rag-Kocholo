        "text": "In recent years, national governments in developed and developing countries have often sought to optimise their science systems, for example, by invoking large-scale reforms (Huang et al. 2015), by implementing research assessment programmes (Weingart 2005), or by changing mechanisms of funding to incentivise priority research areas (Roco 2011). At the same time, national science policies have increasingly pursued goals to target frontier or emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology or synthetic biology, that promise new economic and competitive advantages and new capabilities to meet societal and environmental challenges (Hullmann 2006; Shapira and Wang 2010).\n\nPolicy ambitions to simultaneously improve efficiency and performance yet also to address emerging research areas present major challenges for science systems. This is particularly the case when emerging research areas require not only additional resources but also new methods and interdisciplinary collaborations. From an evolutionary perspective (Dosi and Nelson 1994), the relative performance of reforms and policy initiatives on emerging technologies depends on current as well as past features of the system. Rapid and visible change is frequently demanded by policy makers, yet research systems and their constituent scientific institutions and practices are typically slow, or even resistant, to give up established ways. Path dependence—where institutional forms and practices formed in earlier periods persist and disproportionately influence current activities and trajectories—is potentially an underpinning factor that not only shapes change, but which can also inhibit progress through lock-in and negative feedback loops (Nelson and Winter 1982; Schienstock 2007). In this paper, we study the influence of path dependencies on the development of an emerging technology in a transitional economy. We use this case to examine the path-dependent factors that limit research system change and subsequent performance.\n\nOur focus is the development of nanotechnologyFootnote 1 in Russia from 1990 to 2012. Following the disbanding of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has experienced a series of political and economic crises that profoundly impacted its research capabilities. From the 1990s through to the present, Russian scientific research has remained severely underfunded: over the last decade, R&D spending as a share of the Gross Domestic Product has plateaued at the level of about 1.1 % (UNESCO 2015). This has been accompanied by high rates of scientific out-migration (Graham and Dezhina 2008), when Russia lost nearly one-quarter of its authorship share of the world’s scientific articles between 1996 and 2008 (The Royal Society 2011). Nevertheless, Russia has well-established capabilities in nanoscience and its underlying disciplines (including physics, chemistry, materials science, and electronics). By encouraging nanoscience research, the Russian government hoped to leverage Russia’s position back to the top and join the leading countries in terms of nanotechnology research and commercialisation. This was also expected to bolster the indigenous science, technology and innovation system.\n\nRussia has been reforming its research system throughout the post-Soviet period, including ambitious projects to build a more effective system of innovation (OECD 2011). However, Soviet-style institutional models (Fortescue 1992), especially within the Academy of Sciences, have persisted. In fact, although the organisation of science was broadly perceived as inefficient within Russia, government-led science system reforms did not start in earnest until the late 2000s. To date, Russia’s nanotechnology initiatives have not yielded the desired results. Whereas China is lauded as a successful case of using emerging technologies to catch up with the leaders in terms of publication outputs (Arora et al. 2013), Russia has lagged. Russia ranked sixth in annual nanotechnology publication outputs in 1990, but dropped to tenth place by 2010 (Terekhov 2012). In the 1990s and 2000s, the growth of nanotechnology papers and patents was significantly lower in Russia than in China and India (Liu et al. 2009).\n\nResearch objectives\n\nIt has been suggested that Russia’s efforts in leveraging its science and technology outputs have been hindered by ‘stubborn path-dependencies’ (Klochikhin 2012). Russia’s recent designs to build a competitive basis for nanotechnology research provide a lens through which we can examine the extent to which the Russian science system has (or has not) developed. This research is based on bibliometric analyses to identify path-dependent practices, patterns, and institutions in Russian nanoscience, that appear to be resistant to reform. We build on a line of work that includes an earlier overview of Russia’s profile in nanotechnology in the post-Soviet period (Karaulova et al. 2014) and comparative research, which examines post-Socialist developments in science and innovation in China and Russia (Klochikhin 2013; Klochikhin and Shapira 2012).\n\nThe main objective of this study is to link bibliometric performance indicators of Russian nanoscience and nanotechnology with path-dependent elements of the institutional set-up of its research system. Previous studies suggest that institutional constraints have an impact on science indicators, for example, international collaboration (Wagner and Leydesdorff 2005). In order to further elucidate this, we employ a country-report framework of bibliometric analysis of nanotechnology performance: main actors (institutional and individual), publication outlets, co-authorship patterns, quality of research outputs, geography of research, and the structure of international collaboration (Glanzel 1996; Moed et al. 1995; Tang and Shapira 2011). Structural changes over time are important for tracing sustained systemic features as well as institutional rigidities.\n\nWe first consider the main institutional actors of Russian nanotechnology and find among them a seemingly overwhelming domination of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) in terms of the quantity of outputs, but also in terms of the concentration of collected citations and top performing scientists. Further, we consider the persistence of journal gateways, where publications are issued in translated versions of Russian, rather than internationally published, journals. We then examine the on-going geographic centralisation of Russian nanotechnology research and its multi-layered qualities. It is shown that Moscow and the Moscow region are foremost in publications over other previously strong centres of St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. We find that leading research in terms of star scientists is also centralised within RAS. We then turn to institutional diffusion, highlighting how Soviet-era practices of organisational segregation of researchers from different institutes and disciplinary traditions have persisted in more recent Russian domestic research. Finally, we examine the structure of internationally collaborated publications of Russia, highlighting the plateauing trend of collaboration rates with the USA alongside with the increasing role of other post-Soviet states.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: The next section provides a background review, highlighting literature on the concept of path dependence and discussing what available bibliometric and other research says about the Russian science system and the development of nanotechnology. The following section focuses on methodology and data. A results section provides an updated overview of the Russian research system and then focuses on elements of nanotechnology research that highlight path-dependent elements of scientific knowledge production in Russia. The conclusions outline the main findings and policy recommendations, as well as limitations and directions for future research.\n\nPath dependence\n\nIn discussions of technological choices, path dependence has been used to characterise circumstances where a system or an object of analysis was at a point of divergence and chose a particular technological trajectory which has persisted even as more efficient technologies emerged (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995). We use path dependency to also encompass institutions and practices—as a “social process” that refers to “causal relevance of preceding events in a temporal sequence” (Pierson 2000). Not switching to a more favourable alternative is a signal of path dependence, although how these situations emerge in social and innovation processes is problematic (Martin and Sunley 2006). The temporal dimension is also important: institutional evolution needs to be seen in long-term perspective.\n\nDemonstrating persistent path dependencies in scientific activities and performance is a challenging task: although it can be aided by the use of bibliometric tools, only a few bibliometric research papers have used the concept explicitly. Path dependence is usually interpreted in terms of trajectories, regimes or historically inherited advantages or disadvantages, which condition dynamics of publication and patent outputs (Radosevic and Yoruk 2014). These notions are deeply rooted in the evolutionary tradition of scientometric analysis (Leydesdorff 2013). Such an approach reveals trajectories (paths) pursued by regions, countries, institutions, organisations or individuals. Being path-dependent for each unit of analysis in this context means being locked in a particular track or line of development.\n\nWe suggest that examination of key events and policy interventions provides further opportunities for bibliometric study to offer insights and hints as to causation of path-dependent systems. In the Russian case, a succession of major system-wide events could be expected to have influenced the direction and performance of the science system. These include the breakup of the Soviet Union, innovation system-building activities in the early-to-mid 2000s, and efforts to reform science in the late 2000s. The example of nanotechnology research in Russia allows us to see what has changed in terms of institutional roles and practices during this tumultuous period, revealing both specific and broader insights about path dependence in the Russian science system.\n\nRussian science, technology, innovation and nanotechnology\n\nFrom the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, there were few explicit policy implementation linkages in Russia between technology and economic growth. During this period, Russia was engaged primarily in large-scale economic transformation and institutional building (Gianella and Tompson 2007). Russian policy interest in the potential of nanotechnology to drive new technology-based growth followed some years after the establishment of national nanotechnology programmes in the United States and other developed and developing countries. In particular, China was starting to challenge US domination in science and technology by using nanotechnology as leverage (Kostoff 2008). In Russia, nanotechnology was identified as a priority research area for the first time in 2004 (The Government of Russia 2004), while in 2007 the Russian government launched its own national nanotechnology initiative. The announcement of plans to invest about $11 billion in nanotechnology in Russia through to 2015, and the formation of Rusnano—a government company charged with commercialising nanotechnology, generated much interest, hope, and some scepticism the domestic and international observers (Nature 2009; Schiermeier 2007, 2009). For Russia, the national nanotechnology initiative was a political as well an economic, scientific and technological project. Russia emerged as one of the global leaders in government-led nanotechnology investment, reaching about $1 billion per year (Lux Research 2013).\n\nIn tandem, the Russian government accelerated its efforts to reform the science, technology and innovation system. A recent policy iteration emphasises ‘Institutes of Development’ (Ministry of Economics of Russia 2015), which are designed to act as ‘innovation lifts’ in scaling up emergent companies and science-intensive start-ups. Nanotechnology is one of the components of this programme, with Rusnano, now reorganised as a venture company, designated as one of the ‘Institutes of Development’. However, implementation issues have emerged. It has been argued that the Russian government over-estimated the ability of the Russian science system to deliver commercialisable research (Terekhov 2013). Studies have suggested limited evidence of progress by Russian agencies and industries in creating domestic markets for nanotechnology, in making Russian nanotechnology products internationally competitive (Gokhberg et al. 2012) or in meeting expectations (European Commission 2013). Other science system reforms, such as the transition to a grant-based funding procedures and the reform of the Academy of Sciences, were not launched until 2012.\n\nRussian nanotechnology: national and international comparative perspectives\n\nNanotechnology has gathered significant interest from bibliometric research since the early 2000s after the United States and China adopted large-scale policy and funding programmes to invest heavily, to stimulate scientific development and interdisciplinary research (Shapira et al. 2015). China’s position as an emerging county and its significant increase in research outputs has made it a frequent focus for analysts (Appelbaum et al. 2011; Bhattacharya and Bhati 2011). However, Russia has received less attention by the international research community. Some studies compare the performance of Russia in nanotechnology in the context of other emerging economies, such as China, India or Brazil. Russia is depicted as a country that invested much in nanotechnology, but lost momentum in publication and patent outputs, effectively growing relatively slowly and with fewer scientific, innovation, and economic returns (Liu et al. 2009, 2011; Wong and Wang 2015). Other studies reported similar results for scientific outputs in general: Russia has been reported to be the worst-performing BRICS country in terms of expected contribution of top-cited papers (Bornmann et al. 2015).\n\nWith regard to its national features, Russian science remained very closed until the breakdown of the Soviet Union. After 1990 the country opened to the world, which resulted in the explosive growth of international collaborations (Glänzel et al. 1999). Russia also maintained an important position in international collaboration networks of Eastern European countries (Kozak et al. 2015). Within its national borders, however, the institutional setting of Russian science was relatively unchanged: the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), the successor of the Soviet Academy, remained the main research performing organisation across the sciences, second only to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in its gross annual publication output (Kostoff et al. 2008). The science funding system remained highly centralised, and universities maintained mainly teaching specialisation until mid 2000s (Graham and Dezhina 2008). The domination of RAS is maintained across most fields and disciplines of Russian science, with an exception of clinical medicine, in terms of the volume of outputs and collected citations (Markusova et al. 2009a, b; Mokhnacheva and Kharybina 2011). Some authors equate RAS research outputs with overall research outputs of Russia (Markusova et al. 2009a, b).\n\nThe entire system has remained heavily skewed towards natural sciences, mainly, physics, where leading research is concentrated (Glanzel 2001; Kotsemir 2012; Pislyakov and Shukshina 2014; Wilson and Markusova 2004). Zitt and Bassecoulard (2004) report weak involvement of Russia and other post-Soviet countries in life sciences. Russian nanotechnology maintains the focus on physics (Liu et al. 2011). Existing bibliometric research indicated several commonly reported strengths and weaknesses that Russian nanotechnology shares with other disciplines. These are: underdeveloped nanoscience infrastructure (Connolly 2013), bureaucracy (Yaminsky 2006), aging research-performing personnel and other human resource issues (Terekhov 2011), and problems with political priorities in nanotechnology research and commercialisation (Terekhov 2012). At the same time, existing scholarship notes the relative strength of Russian nanotechnology in terms of fundamental approaches and strong legacy of Soviet research (Andrievski 2003), and identifies areas where Russia is not only internationally competitive, but also has the potential to become a world leader, such as fullerenes and nanodiamond research (Terekhov 2015).\n\nThe domestic nanotechnology strategy of Russia has therefore differed from strategies of other developing countries due to its unique situation. Instead of relying on internationalisation and attracting leading researchers from abroad like China (Klochikhin and Shapira 2012), the Russian government put its stakes on supporting existing competitive nanotechnology areas and investing heavily in infrastructure of research and development (Terekhov 2013). However, this has not yielded the desired results, and Russia’s international standing in nanotechnology has deteriorated throughout the first decade of the twenty-first century. Relatively few internationally authored bibliometric papers delve more deeply to investigate the issues behind this apparent systemic failure. In contrast, work by Russian researchers has been mostly focused on a domestic critical discourse.\n\nWe note that recent reforms to the Russian science system (initiated from 2013) were partly in reaction to the underperformance of Russia’s flagship national nanotechnology initiatives. In this paper, we not only provide an up-to-date bibliometric analysis of nanotechnology research in Russia, but also link this to an analysis of structural aspects of the Russian science system. As nanotechnology is not a cohesive research field, but rather spans across the disciplines, encompassing leading and interdisciplinary research areas, the findings of this study are important to understand systemic problems within best-performing areas of Russian research. This addresses the necessity of further reflection on the challenges posed by deeply embedded path-dependent inefficiencies in the Russian science system.\n\nA review of the publication records broadly indicates trends in the types of Russian nanotechnology publications. The annual output of Russian nanotechnology publications steadily increased between 1990 and 2012. In 1998, there was a considerable jump in the number of publications. This probably reflects the inclusion of additional Russian journals in the WoS. Growth rates for domestic and international publications are almost identical starting from 1999 until 2012 and are about 1.1 % per year. On average, domestic publications grow 2 % faster than internationally collaborated publications (Fig. 1).\n\nPhysics is the dominant subject category in the disciplinary structure of nanotechnology output, constituting over a half of all publications, but decreasing from 72 % in 1991 to 52 % in 2012. Two-thirds of publications are written by authors affiliated with RAS, university authors are associated with around 40 % of publications, and around 10 % of publications include authors from public research organisations (Table 1). Around 43 % of publications include a non-Russian author. The internationalisation of publications as measured by percentage of publications across different organisations including a non-Russian affiliation does not greatly vary from this mean for all nanotechnology publications.\n\nThe Academy of Sciences, 15 universities and four State Research Institutes are the leading organisations in terms of publication output. Some 68 % of domestic publications are produced by the Russian Academy of Sciences and another 12 % by Moscow State University (MV Lomonosov). The top five organisations together produced 80 % of all publications in 1990–2012 (Fig. 2). While RAS is dominant overall in nanoscience publications with 68.5 % share, there is also high stratification among the 261 RAS institutes that publish nanotechnology papers. The dominant RAS institute, the Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology, co-authored 20.6 % of all RAS nanotechnology publications and 14 % of overall Russian publications. Authors from the top ten RAS institutes wrote 56.7 % of RAS and 38.5 % of Russian nanotechnology publications. Universities have been catching up with RAS in nanotechnology publishing in the past decade. Moscow State University—the oldest university in Russia—outperformed the biggest RAS organisation in 2009–2012. Nevertheless, the domination of the Academy as a whole persists with a 62.3 % share of all Russian nanotechnology publications in 2012. A bibliometric map of co-authorships in Russian nanoscience confirms the dominant organisations and also depicts publishing interactions in Russian nanotechnology research (Fig. 3). The Russian Academy of Sciences dominates the publication landscape as a strong authority as it is located at the centre of the network graph (Fig. 3a) While there is no other authority in the map, other hubs are also minor compared to RAS. The vast majority of main national and international collaboration links go through RAS. The network of co-publishing organisations looks entirely different if RAS is eliminated from the picture (Fig. 3b). The network becomes much more scattered and some international organisations completely disappear from the network diagram as they solely collaborate with RAS.\n\nThis general outline of Russian nanotechnology research gives an initial indication of patterns and trends. The following analysis probes the legacy and the current influence of interconnected path-dependent features of the system by examining publication pathways of Russian papers, the geographical distribution of publications, institutional diffusion (intra-national collaborations) in the system, and international collaboration patterns.\n\nJournal gateways\n\nThere is a reported trend among Russian researchers to publish outputs in journals that are edited and published by Russian organisations (Oleinik 2012). The most prominent of these journals are simultaneously translated into English, which grants exposure to the authors without the necessity to adapt to the rules of ‘foreign’ peer review. The Russian Academy of Sciences assumes the role of a ‘gatekeeper’ as it publishes the majority of these journals, thus possessing the ability to block domestic and international publications of nonconformist authors and research groups.\n\nThe data for journals in which Russian co-authored publications can be found, is available for 32,844 publications, which constitutes 97 % of the data. The majority of Russian publications in English were published in translated journals. The time of publication (simultaneously or with a lag) and the translation (done by the author or by the English-language publishing house) vary from journal to journal. Of the top ten journals, containing more than one quarter of all publications, seven are translated versions of Russian journals (Table 2). Of the top twenty journals, 15 are translated (35.3 % of the dataset). The translated versions of Russian journals are identified not by the publishing body (the rights to publish in many cases are owned by Springer), but by the contents of the journal and the editorial board. We visited the Russian language web pages for selected top translated journals. In most cases, there is an explicit statement that the Russian and the English versions of the paper are identical. For example, Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters (JETP Letters), edited by V.T. Dolgopolov of the Institute of Solid State Physics RAS states that, for Russian and English versions of each article, “they are essentially the same paper” (JETP Letters 2015). The (Springer) English edition appears two months after the original Russian paper. Similarly, Springer publishes The Physics of the Solid State. The description on the website says “The journal Physics of the Solid State presents the latest results from Russia’s leading researchers in condensed matter physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences and other prestigious institutions” (Springer 2015). An analogous journal, called Phyzika Tvyordogo Tela (The Physics of the Solid State) is published in Russian by the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg (Ioffe Physical Technical Institute 2015). The Chief Editor of both journals is A.A. Kaplyanskii. All members of the editorial board are affiliated with institutions located in Russia or the former Soviet Union. The editorial boards of the both journals as well as the tables of contents of issues are identical.\n\nThis system implies that a paper, after having undergone domestic peer-review, is published in the English version of the journal and is then indexed by the Web of Science. Approval of the domestic academic community, therefore, becomes crucial for any Russian researcher to establish and maintain a successful publication record. The Russian Academy of Sciences, including through the Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology, issues the majority of the top journals in the dataset. RAS assumes a gatekeeping role over publication routes of Russian publications. Editorial boards mainly consist of members of RAS. This status quo is grounded in history as many of these journals were founded during the Soviet Union to inform the world of the achievements of Soviet science.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, these established publication pathways and journals have been maintained without much impetus for change. While Russian scientists can and do publish in international journals, publishing in a Russian journal with a simultaneous translation into English offers a double benefit. It is an opportunity to write in their own language and gain domestic readership and recognition, which is necessary for promotion within domestic hierarchies. Russian researchers are trained to write publications according to the well-understood criteria for the domestic peer-review. The competition for space in a Russian journal is typically smaller than the competition in a high-impact English-language journal. At the same time, a simultaneous translation into English grants international exposure. Often the publisher carries out the translation, so researchers need not be proficient in a foreign language to publish.\n\nThis may partially explain why, after an initial burst in the early 1990s, more Russian WoS publications have been coming from the translated versions of Russian journals. Until 1998 there were more contributions from Russian authors in international journals, but after that point an increasingly large amount of nanotechnology research was published in the translated Russian journals. In 2011, Russian authors published 2.74 times more publications in translated Russian journals than in international journals (1170 and 426 accordingly).\n\nSuch a trend in publication pathways has two main implications. First, for Russian researchers, domestic recognition matters more than publishing internationally. Second, the Academy of Sciences, which dominates publication gateways, can exercise various forms of influence over (translated) international, as well as domestic public nanoscience, such as lexicology, structural elements of research papers, and the scope of published research areas.\n\nA comparison is provided by experience in China. Zhou and Leydesdorff (2006) report on the gatekeeping role of Chinese-language journals in the internationalisation of Chinese science. Initially, few Chinese-language journals were indexed by the Web of Science. However, since the enactment of reforms that tied career progression and salaries of researchers to publishing directly in journals catalogued in the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the late 2000s (Cao et al. 2013), the situation has changed, with more Chinese-based journals indexed in WoS but also an increase in Chinese researchers publishing in international SCI journals. A similar focus on SCI publication has recently been emphasised by the Russian Government (Ogorodova 2014). However, this may not lead to the same growth effect as in China as the most reputable RAS journals are already catalogued in the SCI.\n\nCentralisation\n\nRussian nanotechnology research is highly centralised geographically, as well as institutionally. RAS has institutes in all 83 regions of Russia, and the 261 RAS institutes publishing on nanoscience are located in 40 of these regions. However, Moscow, Moscow Region, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk published the bulk of 1990–2012 Russian nanotechnology papers, contributing over 80 % of the total output. Moscow is the leader with almost 35 % of all RAS publications. Together with the Moscow Region, the agglomeration produced 45.2 % of all RAS nanotechnology publications.\n\nWhile issues of RAS centralisation have long been observed, these trends have intensified in recent years. The Academy of Sciences’ geographical expansion in the Soviet Era, which produced a network of institutes, many remotely located with low productivity (Graham 1998), has contracted back to three main regional locations: Moscow and the Moscow Region, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. In nanotechnology, RAS institutes in Moscow surged upwards in the mid 2000s, producing almost twice as many publications in 2012 as the research cluster in St. Petersburg (Fig. 4). Moscow boasts several emerging RAS institutes, while the Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology in St. Petersburg, with several small satellites, is the other large and respected RAS in nanotechnology.\n\nGeographical centralisation is accompanied by persistence in the locations of high quality research in Russian nanoscience. Therefore, we assess the nanotechnology-specific excellence of Russian research organisations. Bornmann et al. (2011) bibliometrically define scientific excellence in terms of rates of concentration of high performing authors who collect high numbers of citations. To investigate whether quantity translates into quality in RAS publications, we assessed the performance of the Russian domestic research system according to the criteria of (1) average citations (both nominal counts and normalised by publication years) by affiliation and (2) affiliations of the most cited researchers and publications. Out of all domestic actors, RAS publications collect the highest number of citations: 4.39 average citations per publication.Footnote 2 Publications of public research organisations (PROs), albeit being much smaller in number, collect 3.84 citations. Universities collect on average 3.22 citations, and publications produced by corporate actors collect on average 2.44 citations. The RAS co-authored 81 out of the 100 most highly cited publications in Russian nanoscience.\n\nThe domination of RAS stretches beyond quantity of publications: it also retains the best performing personnel, and co-authors the most cited publications in Russia. Further inquiry in the peak research focuses on top performing scientists in the Russian nanotechnology in terms of the number and the quality of publications (Meyer 2006; Zucker and Darby 1995). The top 10 most cited researchers demonstrate homogeneity in the affiliation structureFootnote 3 (Table 3). The majority of these ‘star’ scientists are, or have been, affiliated with RAS Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology in St. Petersburg. The Institute itself has an average citation of 6.13.\n\nThe publication activity of the most productive scientists peaked between 1998 and 2000, after which it declined. The Post-Soviet period saw the ascendance of scientists trained in the latter years of the Soviet Union. A drop in productivity coincides with the completion of the active research phase of their careers. There is a lack of new ‘rising stars’ in the system, which explains the decline of the overall performance. This data relates back to concerns of the ‘generation gap’ in nanotechnology where the average age of the researcher leans to mid-50s (Terekhov 2011).\n\nThe most productive periods of the most productive Russian nanoscientists coincides with the most productive periods of Russian nanoscience: the contribution of “star” scientists was above 9 % in 1996–2001, reaching a peak of 11.5 % in 1998. A second and smaller peak was reached in 2006, after which the decline aggravated. ‘Star’ scientists are an extremely important element of high performing national and regional science, technology and innovation systems (Heinze et al. 2009). For example, Zucker and Darby (1996) link the research, knowledge transfer and entrepreneurial activities of US ‘star’ scientists with product development, commercialisation and enterprise employment growth. While no commercialisation increase was reported after the star scientists’ outputs peaked, Russian ‘stars’ did collaborate with corporate actors on average twice as actively as RAS, where they all have been employed, in general: 8.4 % versus 4.4 %. One of the ‘star’ scientists left RAS to be employed in a German company, but the rest have demonstrated little or no mobility throughout their careers.\n\nThe network analysis also reinforces the bibliometric results presented above (Table 4). The network of co-publishing author affiliation organisations is very dense. The most direct way of measuring this is the graph density measure which indicates the level of co-publications relative to the total possible value (Cherven 2013). In terms of individual organisations, RAS is central to the network in all periods, according to a number of different measures. At the same time, RAS collaborates to a very limited degree with other research organisations in the domestic system. The most straightforward measure for this is normalised degree centrality, which shows number of connections from RAS as a percentage of all possible connections. This measure has been around 70 % in all three periods, which implies that RAS contributed to around 70 % of all co-publications. Similarly, betweenness centrality for RAS (i.e. how often RAS lies on the shortest path between two other nodes) is also around 70 % and is stable across the three periods of our study.\n\nInstitutional diffusion\n\nIncreasing attention has been given to the growth of inter- as well as intranational scientific collaboration networks in recent years (Glänzel and Schubert 2004). To explore institutional collaboration and associated knowledge exchange and diffusion in the Russian case, we investigate (1) whether each organisation preferred to publish on its own; (2) if research was done through the collaboration of authors in one organisation; (3) whether the organisation engaged in collaborative activities with other organisations of the same type; (4) if organisations preferred to collaborate nationally; and (5) whether organisations preferred to collaborate internationally.\n\nThe results of this analysis demonstrate various patterns of domestic collaboration (Table 5). For instance, corporate publishers rely on collaborations with other types of domestic research organisations: in collaborated papers, they demonstrate very low rates of collaboration within the organisation, or with other corporate actors, publishing over a half of papers with domestic research organisations. An asymmetric relationship among the system actors once again reflects the institutional domination of RAS. Collaboration links between the Academy of Sciences and other institutions are weak. About two-fifths of academic publications are written either by a single author, or by a group of authors within RAS, and only 19 % are collaborated with other Russian organisations than RAS. An international orientation is evident for PROs: over 46 % of publications are internationally collaborated, but only 1.5 % of publications are collaborated with other domestic PROs. Higher rates of international collaboration among PROs reflects their highly specialised nature: mainly nuclear or particle physics, fields where such strategies are a norm. University organisations stand in the middle and have larger share of nationally collaborated publications than the Academy or PROs. Leading RAS institutes have the most pronounced international orientation. For instance, the Landau Institute of Theoretical Physics in the Moscow Region has collaborated in only 11.6 % of its publications with domestic actors, preferring to search for international partners.\n\nNetwork analysis also supports our finding that institutional diffusion is very limited. The average clustering co-efficient (i.e. average level at which the organisations are grouped together) is low (around 74 % of all organisations cluster together) and it is sustained throughout the period. Similarly, the number of weakly connected components (around 5 % of all nodes) has not changed over time (Table 5).\n\nInternationalisation of research\n\nRussia has a Eurocentric orientation in its international nanotechnology scientific collaboration patterns: Russian authors published 2.3 times more nanotechnology papers with the leading European countries—Germany, France and the UK—than they did with the USA in 1990–2012. Germany is the leading research partner for Russian authors (Table 6). At the same time, in concert with previous research on international scientific cooperation (Kozak et al. 2015), we found that Russia maintains the network of research links with countries of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe initial analysis of collaborated publications highlights the prevalence of domestic collaborations over international collaborations. This is also congruent with the findings on the general Russian scientific collaboration pattern beyond nontechnology (Marshakova-Shaikevich 2010). Among the internationally collaborated publications (ICP), the share of European countries (Western, Central and Eastern Europe) is the highest—about 75 %—followed by North America (20 %) and Asia (16 %). 8.3 % of ICP were collaborated with the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which comprises nations of the former Soviet Union, with an exception of the Baltic states—Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia; and Georgia since 2009.\n\nIn terms of research performance, nanotechnology publications with only Russian authors are cited on average 2.5 times per publication. The average number of internationally cited publications is 4.33 times: international collaboration increases average citation by a factor of 170 %.\n\nEurope has remained the largest collaboration partner of Russia throughout the post-Soviet period. The United States has been actively expanding its collaboration links with the developing countries and became China’s largest collaboration partner in nanotechnology (Shapira and Wang 2010; Tang and Shapira 2011). With regard to this trend, the nature of Russia-US collaboration patterns has fluctuated between 18 and 22 % share in the total ICP output (Fig. 5). Russia’s collaboration with China, the largest national publisher in nanotechnology, has also been very weak throughout the observation period. Furthermore, the links of Russia with CIS countries have been strengthening in recent years. Former Soviet countries have experienced extensive brain drain to Europe, America and Russia, and as well as systemic problems across the region. Such practices imply the existence of older networks in the current system, and research takes place through these interactions. At the same time, average citation rates for papers co-written with CIS based authors (8.3 % of all ICP) are significantly lower than for other countries with the same collaboration intensity.\n\nQualitative insights from the interviews we conducted to complement the bibliometric data hint that the international collaboration patterns of Russia mirror old path dependencies. The Russian Academy of Sciences maintained a network of research institutes across the post-Soviet countries, so institutional and personal links sustained post-breakdown. It is also known that Russia experienced extraordinary rates of brain drain throughout the post-Soviet period. The largest shock was in the 1990s, when a large number of first generation researchers left the country, taking up positions in Western Europe and North America (Borjas and Doran 2014; Ganguli 2014). Yet, Russian researchers abroad often maintain links with colleagues at home. As one of our interviewees with expertise in the area of international scientific collaboration noted, many of Russia’s collaborations with Western Europe occur between Russian scientists and their émigré colleagues."
