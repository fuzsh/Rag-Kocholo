It is small – 35MW.\n\n\"We plan to go further: to go to 650-700MW, and maybe even to gigawatts in our region, if wind measurement will allow.\"\n\nAccording to RAWI, Morozov said investments would need to reach €1 billion to reach its target.\n\nLast month, state-owned nanotechnology investor Rusnano signed an agreement with Finnish developer Fortum to install up to 200MW in Russia in the next few years, including a 35MW project in Ulyanovsk.\n\nIn September 2016, Chinese turbine manufacturer Dongfang signed an agreement with the local government of Ulyanovsk and the Ulanotech research centre to build a blade production facility in Russia."
