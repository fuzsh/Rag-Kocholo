        "text": "​\n\nRussian pharmaceutical company NovaMedica (investment project of Rusnano), Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation and Government of the Kaluga Region have concluded Special Investment Contract (SPIC). Denis Manturov, Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Anatoly Artamonov, Governor of the Kaluga Region, and Alexander Kuzin, General Director of NovaMedica, signed the contract. Arkady Dvorkovich, Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, and Anatoly Chubais, Chairman of the Executive Board of Managing Company “RUSNANO”, were present during the ceremony. SPIC envisages creation of a greenfield facility for manufacturing of sterile injectable dosage forms in the Kaluga region. During its implementation NovaMedica will invest more than three billion Rubles in the creation of the facility. Today this SPIC is the biggest one in the Russian pharmaceutical industry in terms of the amount of investments.\n\nState-of-the-art pharmaceutical complex of NovaMedica will be constructed in the Industrial park Vorsino in the Kaluga region. Large portfolio of EDL products of Pfizer, strategic partner of NovaMedica, will be localized there and the facility will produce drug products developed within the own R&D program of NovaMedica as well. The facility will be created in full compliance with the strictest international and Russian standards of quality including GMP EU. In future this will allow NovaMedica to export part of the manufactured products to international markets which is one of the conditions of the SPIC. In the frameworks of the investment project implementation the company will create about 300 high-tech working places.\n\n“Implementation of the investment project of NovaMedica will help to significantly increase for the Russian patients availability of contemporary, effective and safe drug products the majority of which are included into the EDL list and the price of which is controlled by the state”, the Minister concluded.\n\nAs per the data of the MIT Russia, within implementation of the SPIC more than 9.3 bln RUR of investments were attracted into the Russian pharmaceutical industry in total taking into account the SPIC of NovaMedica.\n\n***\n\nRUSNANO Joint-Stock Company was founded in March 2011 through reorganization of state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies. JSC RUSNANO contributes to implementation of the state policy on the development of the nanotechnology industry by investing directly and through investment funds of nanotechnology in financially effective high-technology projects providing the development of new production facilities in the Russian Federation. Its primary investment focus is in electronics, optoelectronics and telecommunications, healthcare and biotechnology, metallurgy and metalwork, energy, mechanical engineering and instrument making, construction and industrial materials, chemicals and petrochemicals. 100 percent of shares of JSC RUSNANO are owned by the state. Thanks to investments RUSNANO currently opened 95 factories and R&D centers in 37 regions of Russia.\n\nManagement of assets of RUSNANO JSC is carried out by Limited Liability Company RUSNANO Management Company, established in December 2013. Anatoly Chubais is the Chairman of its Executive Board.\n\nWork to establish nanotechnology infrastructure and carry out educational programs is fulfilled by RUSNANO’s Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs, which was also established during the reorganization of the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies.\n\nMore information at www.rusnano.com\n\n***\n\nNovaMedica is a modern Russian pharmaceutical company founded in 2012 by Domain Associates LLC, leading U.S. venture capital firm, and RUSNANO, JSC. NovaMedica's strategy is aimed at search, registration and localization in Russia of intellectual property rights for innovative pharmaceuticals products and technologies, as well as at development and implementation of own R&D projects and creation of a modern GMP manufacturing facility. NovaMedica possesses a well-developed infrastructure for promotion and sales of pharmaceutical products. In April 2017 NovaMedica launched its R&D Center with state-of-the-art technological capabilities which were previously unavailable in the Russian pharmaceutical industry.\n\nEnd 2017 R&D Center of NovaMedica received a manufacturing license and Russian GMP certificate from the MIT of Russia. This center is already working under 8 R&D projects. NovaMedica became key partner of Pfizer in Russia in 2016. Partners agreed on localization in Russia of more than 30 EDL products from the Pfizer portfolio and following this aim on construction of a contemporary plant for manufacturing of injectable drug products in the Kaluga region. The ground-breaking ceremony took place on May 30, 2017. In December 2017 Interdepartmental Commission approved NovaMedica’s application for SPIC to create new pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in the Kaluga region.\n\nMore information at www.novamedica.com\n\nPrint"
