Unfortunately, there are no details about the artistic performances or the talks.\n\nListening to a protein fold itself\n\nThis May 20, 2024 news item on ScienceDaily announces new work on protein folding that can be heard,\n\nBy converting their data into sounds, scientists discovered how hydrogen bonds contribute to the lightning-fast gyrations that transform a string of amino acids into a functional, folded protein. Their report, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [PNAS], offers an unprecedented view of the sequence of hydrogen-bonding events that occur when a protein morphs from an unfolded to a folded state.\n\n…\n\nThis video (courtesy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) is “A sonification and animation of a state machine based on a simple lattice model used by Martin Gruebele to teach concepts of protein-folding dynamics,” Note: Also embedded in April 1, 2022 posting, “Sonifying the protein folding process,”\n\nThe latest work is in a May 20, 2024 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign news release (also on EurekAlert) by Diana Yates, which originated the news item. It provides more information about the researchers’ work and about the use of data sonification, Note: Links have been removed,\n\n…\n\n“A protein must fold properly to become an enzyme or signaling molecule or whatever its function may be — all the many things that proteins do in our bodies,” said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign chemistry professor Martin Gruebele, who led the new research with composer and software developer Carla Scaletti.\n\nMisfolded proteins contribute to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, cystic fibrosis and other disorders. To better understand how this process goes awry, scientists must first determine how a string of amino acids shape-shifts into its final form in the watery environment of the cell. The actual transformations occur very fast, “somewhere between 70 nanoseconds and two microseconds,” Gruebele said.\n\nHydrogen bonds are relatively weak attractions that align atoms located on different amino acids in the protein. A folding protein will form a series of hydrogen bonds internally and with the water molecules that surround it. In the process, the protein wiggles into countless potential intermediate conformations, sometimes hitting a dead-end and backtracking until it stumbles onto a different path.\n\nSee video: Protein Sonification: Hairpin in a trap\n\nThe researchers wanted to map the time sequence of hydrogen bonds that occur as the protein folds. But their visualizations could not capture these complex events.\n\n“There are literally tens of thousands of these interactions with water molecules during the short passage between the unfolded and folded state,” Gruebele said.\n\nSo the researchers turned to data sonification, a method for converting their molecular data into sounds so that they could “hear” the hydrogen bonds forming. To accomplish this, Scaletti wrote a software program that assigned each hydrogen bond a unique pitch. Molecular simulations generated the essential data, showing where and when two atoms were in the right position in space — and close enough to one another — to hydrogen bond. If the correct conditions for bonding occurred, the software program played a pitch corresponding to that bond. Altogether, the program tracked hundreds of thousands of individual hydrogen-bonding events in sequence.\n\nSee video: Using sound to explore hydrogen bond dynamics during protein folding [embedded just above this excerpt]\n\nNumerous studies suggest that audio is processed roughly twice as fast as visual data in the human brain, and humans are better able to detect and remember subtle differences in a sequence of sounds than if the same sequence is represented visually, Scaletti said.\n\n“In our auditory system, we’re really very attuned to small differences in frequency,” she said. “We use frequencies and combinations of frequencies to understand speech, for example.”\n\nA protein spends most of its time in the folded state, so the researchers also came up with a “rarity” function to identify when the rare, fleeting moments of folding or unfolding took place.\n\nThe resulting sounds gave them insight into the process, revealing how some hydrogen bonds seem to speed up folding while others appear to slow it. They characterized these transitions, calling the fastest “highway,” the slowest “meander,” and the intermediate ones “ambiguous.”\n\nIncluding the water molecules in the simulations and hydrogen-bonding analysis was essential to understanding the process, Gruebele said.\n\n“Half of the energy from a protein-folding reaction comes from the water and not from the protein,” he said. “We really learned by doing sonification how water molecules settle into the right place on the protein and how they help the protein conformation change so that it finally becomes folded.”\n\nWhile hydrogen bonds are not the only factor contributing to protein folding, these bonds often stabilize a transition from one folded state to another, Gruebele said. Other hydrogen bonds may temporarily impede proper folding. For example, a protein may get hung up in a repeating loop that involves one or more hydrogen bonds forming, breaking and forming again — until the protein eventually escapes from this cul de sac to continue its journey to its most stable folded state.\n\n“Unlike the visualization, which looks like a total random mess, you actually hear patterns when you listen to this,” Gruebele said. “This is the stuff that was impossible to visualize but it’s easy to hear.”\n\nThe National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Symbolic Sound Corporation supported this research.\n\nGruebele also is a professor in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and an affiliate of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper,\n\nHydrogen bonding heterogeneity correlates with protein folding transition state passage time as revealed by data sonification by Carla Scaletti, Premila P.

PNAS 121 (22) e2319094121 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319094121 Published: May 20, 2024\n\nThis paper is behind a paywall.\n\nJosh Smalley (Great British Bake Off Finalist) discusses the parallels between chemistry and baking\n\nIt’s known as the Great British Bake Off (GBBO) in Britain and, elsewhere, as the Great British Baking Show. This latest tv season (or series as they call them in Britain) featured a chemist as one of the contestants, Josh Smalley who has written a commentary about the experience for Call Chemical Biology,.\n\nFrom a June 20, 2024 news item phys.org, Note: A link has been removed,\n\nLast year [2023] on a Friday evening, chemical biology researcher Josh Smalley was in the lab when he received a call inviting him to appear on the 14th and latest season of “The Great British Bake Off.” Starting as one of a group of 12 amateur bakers, Smalley made it all the way to the final round, where the top three contestants compete for the winning spot.\n\nIn an essay published in the journal Cell Chemical Biology on June 20 [2024], Smalley describes the overlap between chemistry and baking and how his training in one has improved his performance in the other, and vice versa.\n\nA June 20, 2024 Cell Press news release on EurekAlert, which originated the news item, delves further into Smalley’s experience as a baker and as a PhD candidate, Note: A link has been removed,\n\n“Baking and science have always been my two great passions,” says Smalley (@joshpsmalley). “I find immense joy in combining my culinary creations with an insight into the science behind them just as much as I love to translate my methodical approach and precision from a chemistry research lab to the kitchen.”\n\nJust a few months before Smalley received the call to be on the show, he finished his PhD at the University of Leicester developing proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the selective degradation of histone deacetylase enzymes. Now post-Bake Off, he’s a postdoctoral research associate there where he develops peptidomimetic sulfinamide foldamers.\n\nSmalley says that his training in the lab is what helped him handle the pressure of baking in the tent. He was determined to showcase his interests in his bakes, like in his chemistry-themed chocolate celebration box. “Some of my proudest moments from the whole experience were when an issue occurred during a bake and I was able to find a way to overcome it without getting flustered or allowing it to compromise my performance,” he says.\n\nSmalley also speaks of the transferable skills between the two areas. “I have come to learn over the years in both scenarios how things like temperatures and clean glassware are essential for perfect results and that the order of addition can have big implications on the product,” he says.\n\nNow that he is progressing in his career as a baker, he sees himself specializing just like he has as a researcher. “I have evolved from a baker that tried their hand at everything to honing my skills and finding my own unique style in the decoration, presentation, and storytelling of my bakes,” he says. “Moving forward, I am looking to continue in academia as a chemical biology researcher but divide my time between research and a public-facing role, promoting science through the art of baking and hopefully inspiring the next generation of scientists.”\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for Smalley’s essay,\n\nThe culinary chemist: Out of the lab and into the tent by Joshua P. Smalley. Cell Chemical Biology Volume 31, ISSUE 6, P1032-1035, June 20, 2024 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2024.05.011 Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights are reserved, including those for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n\nWeirdly, they’ve put the article behind a paywall but fear not.\n\nIf you can’t access the Cell article and don’t mind a spoiler or two, there’s a December 11, 2023 University of Leicester news release written in the form of an interview but I didn’t include them in this excerpt.\n\n…\n\nHow do you feel now that the final show has been broadcast?\n\nA big relief now I don’t have to keep any secrets anymore! I’m so proud of my achievements on the show, what an incredible array of bakes to look back on, especially the showstoppers.\n\nWhat were your favourite moments from the show?\n\nBaking highlights are the showstoppers, I had such joy putting those together, being really creative with the designs. The biscuit burger received the first delayed [Paul] Hollywood handshake ever and the sunflower pies and mille foglie were described as ‘perfect’ and ‘I can’t fault that’ by Prue [Leith]. ..\n\nPaul Hollywood and Prue Leith are judges for the Great British Bake Off. Enjoy!\n\nNanostrings that vibrate for a long, long, long time at ambient termperatures\n\nIt was the ‘ambient temperature’ that caught my attention, from a May 22, 204 news item on Nanowerk, Note: Links have been removed, Note: Much exciting work has to be conducted at very, very cold or very, very hot temperatures, so, ambient or room temperature is a big deal,\n\nResearchers from TU Delft [Delft University of Technology] and Brown University have engineered string-like resonators capable of vibrating longer at ambient temperature than any previously known solid-state object — approaching what is currently only achievable near absolute zero temperatures. Their study, published in Nature Communications (“Centimeter-scale nanomechanical resonators with low dissipation”), pushes the edge of nanotechnology and machine learning to make some of the world’s most sensitive mechanical sensors.\n\n…\n\nA May 21, 2024 Delft University of Technology news release (also on EurekAlert but published May 22, 2024), which originated the news item, explains why the research is considered exciting,\n\nA 100 year swing on a microchip\n\n“Imagine a swing that, once pushed, keeps swinging for almost 100 years because it loses almost no energy through the ropes,” says associate professor Richard Norte. “Our nanostrings do something similar but rather than vibrating once per second like a swing, our strings vibrate 100,000 times per second. Because it’s difficult for energy to leak out, it also means environmental noise is hard to get in, making these some of the best sensors for room temperature environments.\n\nThis innovation is pivotal for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena at room temperature—environments where such phenomena were previously masked by noise. While the weird laws of quantum mechanics are usually only seen in single atoms, the nanostrings’ ability to isolate themselves from our everyday heat-based vibrational noise allows them to open a window into their own quantum signatures; strings made from billions of atoms. In everyday environments, this kind of capability would have interesting uses for quantum-based sensing.\n\nExtraordinary match between simulation and experiment\n\n“Our manufacturing process goes in a different direction with respect to what is possible in nanotechnology today,” said Dr. Andrea Cupertino, who spearheaded the experimental efforts. The strings are 3 centimetres long and 70 nanometres thick, but scaled up, this would be the equivalent of manufacturing guitar strings of glass that are suspended half a kilometre with almost no sag. “This kind of extreme structures are only feasible at nanoscales where the effects of gravity and weight enter differently. This allows for structures that would be unfeasible at our everyday scales but are particularly useful in miniature devices used to measure physical quantities such as pressure, temperature, acceleration and magnetic fields, which we call MEMS sensing,” explains Cupertino.\n\nThe nanostrings are crafted using advanced nanotechnology techniques developed at the TU Delft, pushing the boundaries of how thin and long suspended nanostructures can be made. A key of the collaboration is that these nanostructures can be made so perfectly on a microchip, that there is an extraordinary match between simulations and experiments – meaning that simulations can act as the data for machine learning algorithms, rather than costly experiments. “Our approach involved using machine learning algorithms to optimize the design without continuously fabricating prototypes,” noted lead author Dr. Dongil Shin, who developed these algorithms with Miguel Bessa. To further enhance efficiency of designing these large detailed structures, the machine learning algorithms smartly utilised insights from simpler, shorter string experiments to refine the designs of longer strings, making the development process both economical and effective.\n\nAccording to Norte, the success of this project is a testament to the fruitful collaboration between experts in nanotechnology and machine learning, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of cutting-edge scientific research.\n\nInertial navigation and next-generation microphones\n\nThe implications of these nanostrings extend beyond basic science. They offer promising new pathways for integrating highly sensitive sensors with standard microchip technology, leading to new approaches in vibration-based sensing. While these initial studies focus on strings, the concepts can be expanded to more complex designs to measure other important parameters like acceleration for inertial navigation or something looking more like a vibrating drumhead for next-generation microphones. This research demonstrates the vast array of possibilities when combining nanotechnology advances with machine learning to open new frontiers in technology.\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper,\n\nCentimeter-scale nanomechanical resonators with low dissipation by Andrea Cupertino, Dongil Shin, Leo Guo, Peter G.

How do we turn our science into moneymaking businesses?\n\nIt’s all about the cellulose and the graphite: using fallen leaves as the basis for medical and laboratory sensors\n\nA May 9, 2024 news item on phys.org announces work which makes use of fallen leaves, Note: A link has been removed,\n\nFabrication of sensors by 3D printing combines speed, freedom of design, and the possibility of using waste as a substrate. Various results have been obtained in a circular economy mode, whereby residues usually thrown away are instead used as low-cost resources.\n\nA highly creative solution involving the printing of electrochemical sensors on fallen tree leaves has now been presented by a team of researchers in Brazil led by Bruno Janegitz, a professor at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) and head of its Laboratory for Sensors, Nanomedicines, and Nanostructured Materials (LSNANO), and Thiago Paixão, a professor at the University of São Paulo (USP) and head of its Electronic Tongues and Chemical Sensors Lab (L2ESQ).\n\n…\n\nA May 8, 2024 Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) press release (also on EurekAlert but published May 9, 2024) by José Tadeu Arantes, Note: Links have been removed,\n\n…\n\nThe initiative was supported by FAPESP and highlighted in an article published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.\n\n“We used a CO2 [carbon dioxide] laser to print the design of interest on a leaf by means of pyrolysis and carbonization. We thereby obtained an electrochemical sensor for use in determining levels of dopamine and paracetamol. It’s very easy to operate. A drop of the solution containing one of these compounds is placed on the sensor, and the potentiostat to which it’s coupled displays the concentration,” Janegitz said.\n\nSimply put, the laser beam burns the leaf in a pyrolytic process that converts its cellulose into graphite [emphasis mine], and the graphite body is printed on the leaf in a shape suited to functioning as a sensor. During the fabrication process, the parameters of the CO2 laser, including laser power, pyrolysis scan rate and scan gap, are systematically adjusted to achieve optimal outcomes.\n\n“The sensors were characterized by morphological and physicochemical methods, permitting exhaustive exploration of the novel carbonized surface generated on the leaves,” Janegitz said.\n\n“Furthermore, the applicability of the sensors was confirmed by tests involving the detection of dopamine and paracetamol in biological and pharmaceutical samples. For dopamine, the system proved efficient in a linear range of 10–1,200 micromoles per liter, with a detection limit of 1.1 micromole per liter. For paracetamol, the system worked well in a linear range of 5-100 micromoles per liter, with a detection limit of 0.76.”\n\nIn the tests involving dopamine and paracetamol, conducted as proof of concept, the electrochemical sensors derived from fallen tree leaves attained a satisfactory analytical performance and noteworthy reproducibility, highlighting their potential as an alternative to conventional substrates.\n\nSubstituting fallen tree leaves for conventional materials yields significant gains in terms of cost-cutting and above all environmental sustainability. “The leaves would have been incinerated, or at best composted. Instead, they were used as a substrate for high value-added devices in a major advancement for the fabrication of next-generation electrochemical sensors,” Janegitz said.\n\n…\n\nThere’s also this, “The Agency FAPESP licenses news via Creative Commons (CC-BY-NC-ND) so that they can be republished free of charge and in a simple way by other digital or printed vehicles.”\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper,\n\nGreen Fabrication and Analytical Application of Disposable Carbon Electrodes Made from Fallen Tree Leaves Using a CO2Laser by Rodrigo Vieira Blasques, Jéssica Rocha Camargo, William Barros Veloso, Gabriel Negrão Meloni, Fernando Amaral Fernandes, Beatriz Fernandes Germinare, Luiz Ricardo Guterres e Silva, Abner de Siervo, Thiago Regis Longo Cesar Paixão, and Bruno Campos Janegitz.

There are also some well documented problems with the batteries including the danger of fire. With the proliferating use of lithium-ion batteries, it seems fires are becoming more frequent as Samantha Murphy Kelly documents in her Mach 9, 2023 article for CNN news online, Note: Links have been removed,\n\nLithium-ion batteries, found in many popular consumer products, are under scrutiny again following a massive fire this week in New York City thought to be caused by the battery that powered an electric scooter.\n\nAt least seven people have been injured in a five-alarm fire in the Bronx which required the attention of 200 firefighters. Officials believe the incident stemmed from a lithium-ion battery of a scooter found on the roof of an apartment building. In 2022, the the New York City Fire Department responded to more than 200 e-scooter and e-bike fires, which resulted in six fatalities.\n\n“In all of these fires, these lithium-ion fires, it is not a slow burn; there’s not a small amount of fire, it literally explodes,” FDNY [Fire Dept. New York] Commissioner Laura Kavanagh told reporters. “It’s a tremendous volume of fire as soon as it happens, and it’s very difficult to extinguish and so it’s particularly dangerous.”\n\nA residential fire earlier this week in Carlsbad, California, was suspected to be caused by an e-scooter lithium battery. On Tuesday [March 7, 2023], an alarming video surfaced of a Canadian homeowner running downstairs to find his electric bike battery exploding into flames. [emphasis mine] A fire at a multi-family home in Massachusetts last month is also under investigation for similar issues.\n\nThese incidents are becoming more common for a number of reasons. For starters, lithium-ion batteries are now in numerous consumer tech products,powering laptops, cameras, smartphones and more. They allow companies to squeeze hours of battery life into increasingly slim devices. But a combination of manufacturer issues, misuse and aging batteries can heighten the risk from the batteries, which use flammable materials.\n\n“Lithium batteries are generally safe and unlikely to fail, but only so long as there are no defects and the batteries are not damaged or mistreated,” said Steve Kerber, vice president and executive director of Underwriters Laboratory’s (UL) Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI). “The more batteries that surround us the more incidents we will see.”\n\nIn 2016, Samsung issued a global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 in 2016, citing “battery cell issues” that caused the device to catch fire and at times explode. [emphasis mine] HP and Sony later recalled lithium computer batteries for fire hazards, and about 500,000 hoverboards were recalled due to a risk of “catching fire and/or exploding,” according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration [emphasis mine] banned uninstalled lithium-ion metal batteries from being checked in luggage and said they must remain with a passenger in their carry-on baggage, if approved by the airline and between 101-160 watt hours. “Smoke and fire incidents involving lithium batteries can be mitigated by the cabin crew and passengers inside the aircraft cabin,” the FAA said.\n\nDespite the concerns, lithium-ion batteries continue to be prevalent in many of today’s most popular gadgets. Some tech companies point to their abilities to charge faster, last longer and pack more power into a lighter package.\n\nBut not all lithium batteries are the same.\n\n…\n\nKelly’s Mach 9, 2023 article describes the problems (e.g., a short circuit) that may cause fires and includes some recommendations for better safety and for what to do in the event of a lithium-ion battery fire.Her mention of Samsung and the fires brought back memories; it was mentioned here briefly in a December 21, 2016 post titled, “The volatile lithium-ion battery,” which mostly featured then recent research into the batteries and fires.\n\nMore recently, I’ve got an update of sorts on lithium-ion batteries and fires on airplanes, from the May/June 2024 posting of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Insider,\n\nA smoke, fire or extreme heat incident involving lithium ion batteries takes place aboard an aircraft more than once per week [emphases mine] on average in the U.S., making it imperative for operators to fully understand these dangerous events and to prepare crews with safety training.\n\n…\n\nAt any given time, there could be more than 1,000 Li-ion powered devices on board an airliner, while an international business jet might easily be flying with a few dozen. Despite their popularity, few people realize the dangers posed by Li-ion batteries.\n\nHazards run the gamut, from overheating, to emitting smoke, to bursting into flames or even exploding – spewing bits of white hot gel in all directions. In fact, a Li-ion fire can begin as a seemingly harmless overheat and erupt into a serious hazard in a matter of seconds.\n\nFAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] data shows the scope of the threat: In 2023, more than one Li-ion incident occurred aboard an aircraft each week. Specifically, the agency said there were 208 issues with lithium ion battery packs, 111 with e-cigarettes and vaping devices, 68 with cell phones and 60 with laptop computers. (The FAA doesn’t offer incident data by aircraft type.\n\nThankfully, the data shows the chances of encountering an unstable mobile device aboard a business aircraft are small. But so is the possibility of a passenger experiencing a heart attack – yet many business aircraft carry defibrillators.\n\n…\n\nThe threat with lithium ion batteries is known as thermal runaway. When a Li-ion battery overheats due to some previous damage that creates a short circuit [emphasis mine], the unit continues a catastrophic internal chain reaction until it melts or catches fire.\n\n…\n\nShort circuits, lithium ion batteries, and the University of Alberta\n\nA July 31, 2024 Canadian Light Source (CLS) news release (also received via email) by Greg Basky announces the University of Alberta research,\n\nLithium-ion batteries have a lot of advantages. They charge quickly, have a high energy density, and can be repeatedly charged and discharged.\n\nThey do have one significant shortcoming, however: they’re prone to short-circuiting. This occurs when a connection forms between the two electrodes inside the cell. A short circuit can result in a sudden loss of voltage or the rapid discharge of high current, both causing the battery to fail. In extreme cases, a short circuit can cause a cell to overheat, start on fire, or even explode. Video: Thin layer of tin prevents short-circuiting in lithium-ion batteries\n\nA leading cause of short circuits are rough, tree-like crystal structures called dendrites that can form on the surface of one of the electrodes. When dendrites grow all the way across the cell and make contact with the other electrode, a short circuit can occur.\n\nUsing the Canadian Light Source (CLS) at the University of Saskatchewan (USask), researchers from the University of Alberta (UAlberta) have come up with a promising approach to prevent formation of dendrites in solid-state lithium-ion batteries. They found that adding a tin-rich layer between the electrode and the electrolyte helps spread the lithium around when it’s being deposited on the battery, creating a smooth surface that suppresses the formation of dendrites. The results are published in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces [ACS is American Chemical Society]. The team also found that the cell modified with the tin-rich structure can operate at a much higher current and withstand many more charging-discharging cycles than a regular cell.\n\nResearcher Lingzi Sang, an assistant professor in UAlberta’s Faculty of Science (Chemistry), says the CLS played a key role in the research. “The HXMA beamline enabled us to see at a material’s structural level what was happening on the surface of the lithium in an operating battery,” says Sang. “As a chemist, what I find the most intriguing is we were able to access the exact tin structure that we introduced to the interface which can suppress dendrites and fix this short-circuiting problem.” In a related paper the team published earlier this year, they showed that adding a protective layer of tin also suppressed the formation of dendrites in liquid-electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThis novel approach holds considerable potential for industrial applications, according to Sand. “Our next step is to try to find a sustainable, cost-effective approach to applying the protective layer in battery production.”\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the latest paper,\n\nDual-Component Interlayer Enables Uniform Lithium Deposition and Dendrite Suppression for Solid-State Batteries by Xiang You, Ning Chen, Geng Xie, Shihong Xu, Sayed Youssef Sayed, and Lingzi Sang.

Using stem cells taken from human blood, Wenzel was able to create a tiny artificial organ – roughly three millimetres across and resembling visually what Wenzel described as a piece of chewed gum someone has tried to smooth out again.\n\nThese “mini-brains” are built by creating stem cells from a blood sample, and then transforming these stem cells into functioning brain cells. Using small synthetic organoids for research is not a novel concept – but the “mini-brains” developed in Wenzel’s lab are unique. As outlined in Wenzel’s recent published article in Frontiers of Cellular Neuroscience, the brains from Wenzel’s lab are comprised of four different types of brain cells while most brain organoids are comprised of only neurons.\n\nIn testing, Wenzel’s “mini-brains” more accurately reflect a fully-fledged adult human brain, so they can be used to more closely examine neurological conditions of adult patients, such as Alzheimer disease.\n\nAnd for those “mini-brains” created from the stem cells of individuals who have Alzheimer’s, Wenzel determined that the artificial organ displayed the pathology of Alzheimer’s – just on a smaller scale.\n\n“If stem cells have the capacity to become any cell in the human body, the question then came ‘could we create something that resembles an entire organ?’” Wenzel said. “While we were developing it, I had the crazy idea that if these truly are human brains, if a patient had a disease like Alzheimer’s and we grew their ‘mini-brain,’ in theory that tiny brain would have Alzheimer’s.”\n\nWenzel said this technology has the potential to change the way health services are provided to those with Alzheimer’s, particularly in rural and remote communities. This groundbreaking research has already received support from the Alzheimer Society of Canada.\n\nIf Wenzel and his colleagues can create a consistent way to diagnose and treat neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s using only a small blood sample – which has a relatively long shelf life and can be couriered – instead of requiring patients to travel to hospitals or specialized clinics, it could be a tremendous resource savings for the healthcare system and a burden off of patients.\n\n“In theory, if this tool works the way we think it does, we could just get a blood sample shipped from La Loche or La Ronge to the university and diagnose you like that,” he said.\n\nThe early proof-of-concept work on the “mini-brains” has been extremely promising – which means the next step for Wenzel is expanding the testing to a larger pool of patients.\n\nThe researchers are also interested in trying to expand the scope of the “mini-brain” research. According to Wenzel, if they can confirm the “mini-brains” accurately reflect other brain diseases or neurological conditions, they could potentially be used to speed up diagnoses or test the efficacy of drugs on patients.\n\nAs an example, Wenzel pointed to the substantial wait times to see a psychiatrist in Saskatchewan. If the “mini-brains” could be used to test which antidepressant works best on a patient suffering from depression, it could dramatically reduce the time required to see a doctor and receive a prescription.\n\nA former high school science teacher who made the move into the world of research and academia, Wenzel said it’s the “nature of research” to come up with a hypothesis and hit close to the mark in an experiment that excites him his work.\n\nThe astounding success of the early “mini-brains,” however, has been so staggering that Wenzel admitted he still struggles to wrap his own brain around it.\n\n“I’m still in disbelief, but it’s also extremely motivating that something like this happened,” Wenzel said. “It gives me something that I think will impact society and have actual relevance and create some change … it has a strong potential to shift the landscape of medicine.”\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper,\n\nBrain organoids engineered to give rise to glia and neural networks after 90 days in culture exhibit human-specific proteoforms by Tyler J.

A July 30, 2024 University of British Columbia (UBC) news release (also on EurekAlert and received via email) announces the discovery of a technique for making super-black wood,\n\nThanks to an accidental discovery, researchers at the University of British Columbia have created a new super-black material that absorbs almost all light, opening potential applications in fine jewelry, solar cells and precision optical devices.\n\nProfessor Philip Evans and PhD student Kenny Cheng were experimenting with high-energy plasma to make wood more water-repellent. However, when they applied the technique to the cut ends of wood cells, the surfaces turned extremely black.\n\nMeasurements by Texas A&M University’s department of physics and astronomy confirmed that the material reflected less than one per cent of visible light, absorbing almost all the light that struck it.\n\nInstead of discarding this accidental finding, the team decided to shift their focus to designing super-black materials, contributing a new approach to the search for the darkest materials on Earth.\n\n“Ultra-black or super-black material can absorb more than 99 per cent of the light that strikes it – significantly more so than normal black paint, which absorbs about 97.5 per cent of light,” explained Dr. Evans, a professor in the faculty of forestry and BC Leadership Chair in Advanced Forest Products Manufacturing Technology.\n\nSuper-black materials are increasingly sought after in astronomy, where ultra-black coatings on devices help reduce stray light and improve image clarity. Super-black coatings can enhance the efficiency of solar cells. They are also used in making art pieces and luxury consumer items like watches.\n\nThe researchers have developed prototype commercial products using their super-black wood, initially focusing on watches and jewelry, with plans to explore other commercial applications in the future.\n\nWonder wood\n\nThe team named and trademarked their discovery Nxylon (niks-uh-lon), after Nyx, the Greek goddess of the night, and xylon, the Greek word for wood.\n\nMost surprisingly, Nxylon remains black even when coated with an alloy, such as the gold coating applied to the wood to make it electrically conductive enough to be viewed and studied using an electron microscope. This is because Nxylon’s structure inherently prevents light from escaping rather than depending on black pigments.\n\nThe UBC team have demonstrated that Nxylon can replace expensive and rare black woods like ebony and rosewood for watch faces, and it can be used in jewelry to replace the black gemstone onyx.\n\n“Nxylon’s composition combines the benefits of natural materials with unique structural features, making it lightweight, stiff and easy to cut into intricate shapes,” said Dr. Evans.\n\nMade from basswood, a tree widely found in North America and valued for hand carving, boxes, shutters and musical instruments, Nxylon can also use other types of wood such as European lime wood.\n\nBreathing new life into forestry\n\nDr. Evans and his colleagues plan to launch a startup, Nxylon Corporation of Canada, to scale up applications of Nxylon in collaboration with jewellers, artists and tech product designers. They also plan to develop a commercial-scale plasma reactor to produce larger super-black wood samples suitable for non-reflective ceiling and wall tiles.\n\n“Nxylon can be made from sustainable and renewable materials widely found in North America and Europe, leading to new applications for wood. The wood industry in B.C. is often seen as a sunset industry focused on commodity products—our research demonstrates its great untapped potential,” said Dr. Evans.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to this work include Vickie Ma, Dengcheng Feng and Sara Xu (all from UBC’s faculty of forestry); Luke Schmidt (Texas A&M); and Mick Turner (The Australian National University).\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper (and hat’s off to the writers for an accessible introduction),\n\nSuper-Black Material Created by Plasma Etching Wood by Kenneth J. Cheng, Dengcheng Feng, Luke M. Schmidt, Michael Turner, Philip D. Evans. Advanced Sustainable Systems DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202400184 First published: 16 June 2024\n\nThis paper is open access.\n\nI can’t resist; this is such a good introduction, keeping in mind it’s written for an academic journal, from Super-Black Material Created by Plasma Etching Wood.\n\nSuper-black materials have very low reflectivity due to structural absorption of light.[1] They are attracting considerable scientific and industrial attention because of their important applications in many fields: astronomy,[2, 3] photovoltaics,[4, 5] and optical science,[6] among others. In these applications, super-black materials minimize unwanted reflection of light enabling devices to operate more accurately or efficiently.[6] In other fields, for example art and design, the attraction of super-black materials lies in their ability to create bizarre visual effects because of huge contrast between black and adjacent colored objects or surfaces.[7] This artistic application of super-black materials is analogous to the juxtaposition of super-black and brightly colored courtship display patches in birds and peacock spiders.[8, 9] In birds, super-black patches have been defined as those having less than 2% directional reflectance at normal incidence.[8] Reflectance values of super-black patches in 32 bird species ranged from 0.045 to 1.97% with an average of 0.94% (300–700 nm).[8] Other studies have associated super-blackness with reflectance values of 1%[10] or 0.5%.[3] Far lower reflectance values have been achieved with materials containing aligned carbon nanotubes (CNT), for example a low-density CNT array (0.045%),[11] the coating Vantablack (0.035%)[7] and a CNT-metal foil (0.005%).[12] The current holder of the “record” for a low reflectivity material (<0.0002%) is an ion-track micro-textured polymer with anti-backscatter matrix.[13]\n\nThe low reflectivity of materials such as Vantablack is due to the high absorption of light by graphene and the ability of vertical arrays of CNT to lower surface reflection.[6, 7] In the case of a low-density CNT array, its low reflectivity was ascribed to its random surface profile and presence of a loose network of entangled nanotubes, in addition to vertically oriented nanotubes.[11] Other structures can also be used to reduce reflectivity of synthetic materials including nanopores, and microcavities.[6] Even more diverse structures are found in natural super-black materials, including complex barbule microstructures in birds,[1] cuticular micro-lens arrays in peacock spiders,[9] and polydisperse honeycomb configurations in the wings of butterflies.[14] The structural features of butterfly wings have been used as biomimetic models to create super-black polymer films.[4, 10] This biomimetic route to creating super-black materials has the advantages that “the films are thinner than known alternatives and can be fabricated at lower temperatures via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, instead of being grown from CNT.”[4, 14]\n\nBiomimicry of nature’s structural material par excellence, wood, is being used to create lightweight stiff and tough composites,[15, 16] but wood is not a model for the creation of super-black materials because even the darkest woods such as ebony (Diospyros spp.) or African blackwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon Guill. & Perr.) lack structural features that reduce reflectivity. Nevertheless, there is interest in using wood in applications where blackness is advantageous such as solar steam generation and desalination of water,[17-20] because wood is widely available, inexpensive, sustainable and can be fabricated into panels and objects. In these applications, wood is carbonized and retains its porous microstructure creating a black material with reflectivity of 3%.[18] The creation of additional porosity by micro-drilling the wood prior to carbonization further reduced reflectivity to 2%.[18] We serendipitously created a super-black wood during undirected investigations into the use of plasma etching to “machine” novel microstructures at basswood (Tilia americana L.) surfaces. We called this material Nxylon, a neologism created from Nyx (Greek goddess of the night) and xylon (Greek for wood materials). One of us published the reflectivity data for Nxylon in 2020.[21] Here we report on the structural features responsible for the super-blackness of Nxylon, describe how it is made and discuss its possible practical uses. During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of a novel approach to creating super-black wood involving high temperature carbonization of delignified balsa wood (Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. ex Lam.) Urb.).[22] This material is produced using “mature processing technologies” and can be used to create solid wood products with complex geometries. The surface plasma process we describe is liquid free, generates little waste and is more suited for the creation of super-black veneer which can be used on a small scale to manufacture luxury consumer products. Therein lies the novelty and significance of our work.\n\n…\n\nThe most comprehensive piece I’ve published on the topic of the ‘really, really black’ is in a December 4, 2019 posting, “More of the ‘blackest black’.” At that point, some new work on creating the blackest black (up to 99.99% and 99.995% light absorption, respectively) had come from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I also included the latest about an artistic feud over Vantablack (mentioned in the paper’s introduction) and its 99.8% light absorption and provided a link back to my earliest stories on Vantablack."
