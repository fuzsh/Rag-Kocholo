        "text": "AK&M 15 July 2024 12:58\n\nRUSNANO has completed its financial recovery ahead of schedule and is launching a new investment cycle with private investors. The company has paid off to creditor banks about 80% of the \"historical\" debt accumulated until 2021. The discount amount was 20%, taking into account savings on interest on debt with early repayment â€“ 40%, the company said.\n\nThe company noted that, originally conceived as a state corporation for the accelerated commercialization of scientific developments, it has become the object of experiments on the introduction of market tools and integration into the global technological community. As a result, the company's equity was replaced by Sberbank financing, and the investment portfolio was placed mainly in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nIn 2024, agreements were reached and implemented with banks on a significant discount for early fulfillment of obligations, which made it possible to interrupt an inorganic \"credit scheme\" for venture business with a service cost of more than 12 billion rubles per year.\n\nThe company has paid off most of the debt from its own funds earned from the lucrative sale of a portion of the portfolio brought to an acceptable level of maturity. At the same time, the competence centers allocated after spectral analysis of assets and reassembly, supporting projects at early stages of development, will become assembly points for further integration into industry structures in the field of water treatment, energy, new materials, ecology and telecom.\n\nThe damage identified during the audit and anti-crisis measures will be recovered in the near future within the framework of criminal cases or restored in the process of peaceful settlement, including with foreign partners.\n\nIt is planned that the new investment cycle will be based on the scientific and technical achievements of both RUSNANO itself and partner scientific and educational organizations. The goals of the transit phase of the strategy are fully correlated with national goals and are already being implemented in joint projects with Norilsk Nickel, Rostec, Gazprom Neft, Rosatom and international partners in a number of the most technologically advanced regions, such as the Nizhny Novgorod Region, the Republic of Tatarstan, the federal territory of Sirius and others.\n\nThe prospective phase (2025-2030) also involves the formation of prototypes of new intersectoral industries, the creation of alternative technologies, the restoration and creation of new scientific schools, and the encouragement of mass invention and innovation. The main partners in the prospective phase will be the Kurchatov Center, ITMO, the Foundation for Advanced Research and Skoltech.\n\nIt is planned to use mainly private investments and own funds of managing partners as a source of financing. Partnerships will be based on the principles and in the form of investment partnership agreements or on the basis of traditional equity instruments. In the future, it is planned to pilot new forms, for example, DAO. In the early stages of Death Valley projects, the company will serve as a controlling shareholder and managing partner with a gradual exit in favor of management and mass investors as they mature and integrate into the industry.\n\nIntangible assets such as intellectual property, a depersonalized brand, the reputation of a revamped team and platform will be reassessed during 2024-2025. In addition, capital will be adjusted at the end of the five-year cycle. If successful, management partners will be offered options for shares in businesses, provided they share risks proportionally with investors at all stages of the project.\n\nRecall that RUSNANO recently announced the risk of bankruptcy. The Company informed that, based on the assessment of the liquidity status of the issuer's group, additional financing from the shareholder will be required in the near future to ensure timely and full fulfillment by the issuer of its obligations to creditors.\n\nJSC RUSNANO (TIN 7728131587) was established in March 2011 through the reorganization of the state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnology. RUSNANO contributes to the implementation of the state policy on the development of the nanoindustry, acting as a co-investor in nanotechnology projects with significant economic or social potential."
