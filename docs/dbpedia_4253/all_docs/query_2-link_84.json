        "text": "Article Type: Industry news From: Microelectronics International, Volume 27, Issue 1\n\nThe order from the Russian Academy of Sciences, more exactly the Institute of Semiconductor Physics in Novosibirsk, Siberia, is Obducat's first order in Russia. The system is scheduled for delivery during the third quarter and will primarily be used in the R&D of nanoelectronics and photonics. The institute in Siberia has more than 200 persons doing research in micro and nanoelectronics, photonics, and information technology.\n\nDuring the Spring of 2009, the Russian Academy of Sciences evaluated a number of potential suppliers. In the purchasing process that followed, Obducat was chosen. The choice means that the Russian institute's research will in future be conducted by the use of Obducat's patented IPS® – STU® process technology.\n\n“Getting an early foothold in the Russian market is of vital importance seeing that it will allow us to create connections with this customer's partners, i.e. institutions and companies that may be future customers,” says Patrik Lundström, CEO, Obducat AB.\n\n“In the light of the investments that RUSNANO, the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies, is planning in areas such as LED and solar cells, there is a clear possibility of strong growth potential in this market in the years to come,” says Patrik Lundström, CEO, Obducat AB.\n\nRUSNANO was established in 2007 for the purpose of supporting the development of the Russian nanotechnology-based industry towards the global market, and the establishment of partnerships with leading nanotechnology centres in the world."
