        "text": "Sergey Alexandrovich KULIKOV is the Chairman of the Board of Management Company RUSNANO LLC and Member of the Board of Directors of Rusnano JSC, as well as the First deputy Chairman of the board of the Military Industrial Commission. Rusnano LLC is a Russian innovation development institution created in the framework of a Presidential Initiative called \"Strategy for Development of Nanotechnology Industry\". Sergey Kulikov is therefore involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation. On 24 February 2022, in the aftermath of the initial stages of Russian aggression against Ukraine, Sergey Alexandrovich KULIKOV, along with other 36 businesspeople, met with President Vladimir Putin and other members of the Russian government to discuss the impact of the course of action in the wake of Western sanctions. The fact that he was invited to attend this meeting shows that he is a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin and that he is supporting or implementing actions or policies which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as well as stability and security in Ukraine. It also shows that he is one of the leading businesspersons involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of Russia, which is responsible for annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of Ukraine."
