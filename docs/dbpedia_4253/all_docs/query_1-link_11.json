The MoU was signed in relation to St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and seeks to strengthen Vestas and Rusnano’s position in the growing Russian sustainable energy market.\n\nSigning the MoU, Anders Runevad, Vestas President and CEO, said: “We continue to strengthen our leading position in Russia together with RUSNANO and today’s Memorandum of Understanding underlines our long-term commitment to leading the sustainable energy expansion in Russia. The memorandum furthermore exemplifies how Vestas works with partners such as RUSNANO to develop solutions that benefits local communities through investments and jobs, while also driving the green energy transition”.\n\nToday’s MoU follows Vestas’ role as technology partner in the Wind Energy Development Fund, which is the joint investment fund established by RUSNANO and Fortum, a leading Finnish clean energy company.
