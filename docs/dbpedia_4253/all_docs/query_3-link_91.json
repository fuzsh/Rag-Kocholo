        "text": "Danish manufacturer Vestas will also consider the potential for using technology developed by Rusnanoâ€™s subsidiaries as part of the agreement.\n\nRusnano, in a joint venture with Finnish utility Fortum, has been awarded just over 1.8GW of capacity in Russia across two auction rounds.\n\nVestas is the preferred supplier for this capacity, and so far, nearly 350MW of this capacity has been converted to firm and unconditional orders, a spokesman for the manufacturer told Windpwer Monthly.\n\nIt aims to supply the full 1.8GW over the next five years, he added.\n\nVestas opened a blade factory in Ulyanovsk in December, and plans to set up a nacelles assembly plant in Nizhny Novgorod and a tower factory in Rostov, all in western Russia.\n\nWind farms must include 65% local content, and 44% of turbine components must be sourced locally in Russia, according to the Russian Association of the Wind Industry (RAWI)."
