        "text": "​\n\nMay 30, 2017, Kaluga region, IP Vorsino - Russian pharmaceutical company NovaMedica, a portfolio company of RUSNANO, announces the start of construction of a plant for the production of sterile injectable drugs as part of its long-term strategy to localize innovative medicines and technologies of their development and production in Russia. The plant will be built in the industrial park “Vorsino” in the Kaluga region.\n\nThe key partner of Russian company in this project is Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, a partnership agreement with which NovaMedica and its shareholders signed in December 2016. Pfizer becomes an investor in the construction of the plant and transfers NovaMedica the rights to manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of more than 30 vital medicines (injectable dosage forms), one third of which is currently not manufactured in Russia. The portfolio includes drugs for the treatment of severe bacterial and fungal infections, cardiovascular, inflammatory and cancer diseases. Most of them are in the list of vital and essential medicines (VED), some are also included in the Russian list of essential drugs (RLED) and in the “7 Nosologies” program.\n\nThe plant will be built in the Industrial park “Vorsino” in the Kaluga region. NovaMedica concluded an agreement with the Government of the Kaluga region and the Kaluga City Administration to acquire a land plot for the construction of a pharmaceutical plant in the region in 2013.\n\nThe project of the plant is created by the company “M+W Group”, which is one of the world leaders in the market of complex industrial facilities designing. Planned capacity of the plant is more than 38.5 million units of production (ampules and bottles) per year. The total area of production and auxiliary buildings and structures will be about 23,000 square meters. The lines will be equipped with technological equipment of the leading European manufacturers: Bosch, Ziel, GEA-lyophyl, Bausch+Ströbel, Belimed, Seidenader, Optima, Mediseal, Uhlmann and others.\n\nThe production unit of the plant is represented by sites for production of sterile injectable preparations: lyophilized and solutions in bottles and ampules. There is also a possibility of further expansion of production under demanded forms of injection products: pre-filled syringes, bottles, disposable packages for infusion. The project includes creation of isolated blocks for production of standard and cytotoxic drugs.\n\nThe company is planning to complete plant construction and equip it with equipment, having prepared for operation, in 2020. The plant will meet the requirements not only Russian, but also European and Eurasian standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP), which will allow NovaMedica to export its products to international markets in future.\n\n…………………………………………………………............................................................................................................\n\nNovaMedica is a modern Russian pharmaceutical company founded in 2012 by Domain Associates LLC, leading U.S. venture capital firm, and RUSNANO, JSC (RUSNANO controls 50% of NovaMedica shares through the venture fund RusnanoMedInvest).
