        "text": "All of Brentano's students recall the burning sense of a mission to render philosophy a science that permeated the core of their mentor's being and teaching, but what kind of science does Brentano defend for philosophy in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874) and new science of descriptive psychology which he subsequently elaborated in his lectures in philosophy at the University of Vienna in the 1880s? Brentano would like us to believe that he is continuing the perennial science of philosophy as inaugurated by the ancient Greeks, and by Aristotle in particular, into the nineteenth century. This article, however, argues that once Brentano accepts the status of the newly emerging natural science of psychology and adopts in the 1870s a Humean philosophical approach to the mind and its contents, he cannot, despite his best efforts, establish the continuity of philosophy as philosophia perennis that exists before and after the modern conception of natural science. He thus defends for the science of philosophy instead, a psychology from an empirical standpoint that is fully modern in temperament, yet one that is neither fully empirical or rational in Hume or Kant's sense nor a capitulation to the method of the natural sciences in general and fledgling natural science of empirical psychology in particular.\n\nThe Polish branch of analytic philosophy, the Lvov-Warsaw School, was initiated by Kazimierz Twardowski, a student of Franz Brentano. Twardowski's aim was to vaccinate Brentano's spirit into Polish philosophy. He succeeded and Brentano's impact on Polish philosophy was deep and versatile. Moreover, for few decades, Brentano's ideas were much more popular among members of the Lvov-Warsaw School than in other centers of analytic philosophy. The paper provides an overview of Brentano's direct and indirect impact on representatives of the Lvov-Warsaw School. Various spheres of infuence, including the conception of philosophy , logic, methodology, ontology, and ethics as well as teaching philosophy are taken into considerations. This overview is preceded by some distinctions on the concept of inluence.\n\nIn this article we present and compare two early attempts to establish psychology as an independent scientific discipline that had considerable influence in central Europe: the theories of Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776—1841) and Franz Brentano (1838—1917). While both of them emphasize that psychology ought to be conceived as an empirical science, their conceptions show revealing differences. Herbart starts with metaphysical principles and aims at mathematizing psychology, whereas Brentano rejects all metaphysics and bases his method on a conception of inner perception (as opposed to inner observation) as a secondary consciousness, by means of which one gets to be aware of all of one’s own conscious phenomena. Brentano’s focus on inner perception brings him to deny the claim that there could be unconscious mental phenomena — a view that stands in sharp contrast to Herbart’s emphasis on unconscious, ‘repressed’ presentations as a core element of his mechanics of mind. Herbart, on the other hand, denies any role for psychological experiments, while Brentano encouraged laboratory work, thus paving the road for the more experimental work of his students like Stumpf and Meinong. By briefly tracing the fate of the schools of Herbart and Brentano, respectively, we aim to illustrate their impact on the development of psychological research, mainly in central Europe.\n\nI provide a survey information about the Czech philosophy after 1989. I describe briefly the historical situation and the institutional background, as well as the main topics of discourse and groups of cooperation. Then, I describe briefly the main figures of the post-1989 Czech philosophy, dividing them into five groups, namely the people of continuity (who were professionals in the 1970's and 1980's and remained in the profession after 1989), the people of discontinuity (the victims of the purges around 1970 who returned to the profession after 1989), the underground people (who were educated mainly in the underground philosophy circles), the people of exile, and the young blood. Finally, I introduce figures who do not belong to philosophy professionally but whose work is of philosophical relevance.\n\nThis essay compares the evolution of the “Prague doctrine” described in Ondřej Sládek’s “The Metamorphoses of Prague School Structural Poetics” (2015) with similar developments in literary theory in Eastern Europe (from Russian formalism to the Tartu-Moscow School of Semiotics). The author proposes a transnational approach to the study of the typology and history of literary theories and outlines, in partial agreement with Sládek, several cross-cultural transfers of theoretical concepts and research tools from linguistics to literary theory and structural anthropology and further to semiotics and cultural studies. As an addition to Sládek’s overview of the evolution of structural poetics, this essay points to facts that serve as evidence for a parallel, sometimes interrelated, development of structural poetics and cultural semiotics in the former Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn the last few years understanding of the history of the Prague Linguistic Circle (PLC) has been essentially enriched. They also now allow us to transform texts, linguistic problems and personal stories, usually studied under the term ‘the Prague School’, into the paradigm of relations between modern science and culture and explore them on the diverse and controversial cultural and political background of interwar Czechoslovakia. In the following paper, I present the digest of articles on the PLC published in the Prager Presse between 1929–1938. This rich source of information on PLC and practice of science in interwar Europe has not been taken into account in either the published documentation of the Circle, or in any published book. I also present the editor of the culture section of the Prager Presse Antonín Stanislav Mágr and his ties to the Circle."
