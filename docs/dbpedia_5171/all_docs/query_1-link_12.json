        "text": "Carl Stumpf (1848-1936) was a German psychologist. He was also an accomplished violinist, master of five additional instruments, and a composer.\n\nIt is not surprising that when Stumpf turned to science and psychology, his research interests would focus on acoustics, and he became a major pioneer in the psychological study of music. His most influential writing was the two-volume work, The Psychology of Tone (1883, 1890). Stumpf, along with Helmholtz, became the recognized leaders in the field of acoustics."
