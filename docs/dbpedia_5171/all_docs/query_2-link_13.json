From Bolzano to the school of Brentano, Prague philosophers from the nineteenth and early twentieth-century contributed decisively to the project of a scientific philosophy, characteristic of Austrian philosophy.

Brentano&rsquo;s early students, Carl Stumpf (1848-1936) and Anton Marty, were appointed professors in Prague as early as 1879 and 1880 respectively. Thomas Masaryk, also a student of Brentano, was appointed there in 1882, followed by further students of Brentano (Christian von Ehrenfels in 1892, Alois H&ouml;fler in 1903 and Oskar Kraus in 1909) who all contributed decisively to the philosophical and scientific programme of Franz Brentano.
