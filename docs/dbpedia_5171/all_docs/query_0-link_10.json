        "text": "Phenomenology, philosophy illuminating the dawn.\n\nEdmund Husserl(1859-1938), a German philosopher, is widely regarded as the founder of phenomenology, a philosophical movement that aims to study structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. His development of phenomenology was influenced by his background in mathematics, as well as his studies in philosophy and psychology.\n\nMathematical Background\n\nHusserl initially studied astronomy and mathematics, receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics. His mathematical training influenced his philosophical work, leading him to value precision and clarity in thought.\n\nStudies in Philosophy and Psychology\n\nHusserl studied under Franz Brentano, a philosopher and psychologist, who introduced him to the idea of “intentionality” — the concept that consciousness is always consciousness of something. He was also influenced by Carl Stumpf, another student of Brentano, and later by the work of Bernard Bolzano, a logician and philosopher.\n\nLogische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations)\n\nPublished in 1900-1901, this work is considered Husserl’s first major philosophical work, where he critiques psychologism (the idea that logical truths are based on psychological laws) and argues for the necessity of a pure phenomenology, separate from empirical psychology.\n\nDevelopment of the Phenomenological Method\n\nHusserl’s phenomenology started as a method of philosophical inquiry that sought to describe the structures of consciousness from a first-person perspective. He emphasized the importance of “phenomenological reduction,” a process of bracketing or setting aside one’s preconceived beliefs and biases to directly observe the phenomena of consciousness.\n\nTranscendental Phenomenology\n\nOver time, Husserl’s work evolved into a form of transcendental phenomenology, where he argued that all consciousness is intentional and directed toward objects, and that to understand this intentionality, one must study consciousness from the first-person perspective.\n\nLater Works"
