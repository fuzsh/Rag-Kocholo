        "text": "Abstract\n\nHydrological changes of the Irtysh River were analyzed concerning the changes of annual runoff and its distribution features within a year measured by coefficient of variation and concentration degree. Abrupt changes were detected by the heuristic segmentation method. Possible causes of the hydrological changes were investigated considering climate changes and human activities (especially the reservoir operation). The Mann-Kendall method was applied to estimate whether the temperature and precipitation was changed. The increased precipitation in winter may increase the runoff of April. The increased temperature and the decreased precipitation in the flood season may decrease the runoff. At the middle reaches, the impact of the reservoirs at the upper reaches is significant and may be the main factor leading to the abrupt decreases in annual runoff and its intra-annual variability and concentration. The increased water surface area of the reservoirs aggravates the evaporation and leads to annual runoff reduction. The reservoirs regulate runoff by storing water in the flood season and releasing water in the dry season. While at the lower reaches, the annual runoff remained steady and its intra-annual variation and concentration were reduced gradually because the impact of the reservoirs is relative small and the climatic impact may be more relevant."
