        "meta_description": "Data on the species diversity and distribution of pteridophytes (lycophytes and ferns) in the Urals and adjacent areas are presented. The dataset includes 13,742 observations of two classes Lycopodiopsida and Polypodiopsida. In total, the dataset contains information on 16 families, 28 generas, 65 species, four subspecies and nine interspecies hybrids. All records are for lycophytes and ferns collected over 170 years between 1853 and 2021. The dataset presented is based on herbarium specimens, published data and field research conducted by the authors. This dataset is the first and important step towards generalising information on the current diversity and geographical distribution of pteridophytes in the Urals and adjacent areas.The dataset contains 13,742 records of 65 species of pteridophytes occurrences in the Urals and adjacent territories: Udmurt Republic (42,100 km2); Perm Krai (160,600 km2); Sverdlovsk Oblast (194,800 km2); Chelyabinsk Oblast (87,900 km2); Republic of Bashkortostan (143,600 km2); Tyumen Oblast (160,100 km2); Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (769,300 km2); Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (534,800km2) and Kurgan Oblast (71,500 km2). Each record includes a geographical description of the place of discovery and habitat, year of discovery, author of the finding and determination, as well as a link to a literary source (if the data were published) or the place of storage of the herbarium specimen. The presented dataset supplements the information on the occurrence of pteridophytes in the Russian Federation as a whole and clarifies their distribution in the Urals.",
