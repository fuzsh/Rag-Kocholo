The study of a debris covered glacier – Lirung glacier (28.241 N, 85.556 E), Lantan sub-basin of Gandaki river, Nepal through remote sensing and field survey reveals the glacier dynamics. The glacier recession is active and glacier thinning is seriously observed in Lirung glacier. A proglacial lake formed at the evacuated historical terminus of the glacier bounded by the lateral moraines. The glacier broken as two separate bodies; the accumulation zone and ablation zone are separated. This activity is mentioned here as “One-By-Two” phenomenon. As the glaciers not receiving any ice mass from accumulation zone, the mass balance will be always negative. Many supraglacial activities such as formation of large supraglacial lakes, exposing ice cliffs initiated in the broken ablation zone of the glacier. The supraglacial lakes and the exposed ice cliffs of the lakes receive more solar radiation and fasten the melting of glacier ice. Finally the ablation part melts faster and disappears. The accumulation area turns to become a “glacieret” with no dynamics. This type of activity is getting more prevalent in the Himalayan cryosphere due to change in the precipitation and temperature increase. Such breaking of glacier will have pronounced impact on the hydrology of rivers originating from the Himalayan cryosphere.\n\nAdditional contents\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 132 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-66 - Current state of the Kolyma and Chukotka glaciers and projection of glacial systems of the Chukchi highlands’ evolution\n\nAnanicheva, Maria D. (1); Karpachevsky, Andrey (2) 1: Institute of Geography RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation; 2: Lomonosov MSU, Moscow, Russian Federation\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe aim of this work is to assess the current state of the highlands’ glaciation by the high resolution satellite images, to compare with the Glacier inventory data at the background of climatic parameters, such as temperature and precipitation trends over the last 50 years, as well as assessment of the evolution of glacier systems in the near future.\n\nA recent study, done by a group of authors presents a generalization and systematization of the information on glaciers of the Chukotka and Kolyma highlands, which was given by the Magadan researcher R.V. Sedov.\n\nGlaciers of the Kolyma highlands consist of two groups: five are located on the eastern slope of the Kolyma highlands near the western shore of the Sea of Okhotsk, the equilibrium line altitude (HELA) is from 700 to 1500 m a. s. l., and 14 cirque glaciers are located in the northern part of the Taigonos Peninsula, the equilibrium line altitude (HELA) from 700 to 1000 m.\n\nGlaciers of the Chukchi Highlands, according to R.V. Sedov, are represented by five groups: in the Teniany Range in the Lavrentiya Bay, the mean HELA is 500 m a.s.l. in the Providenskiy Mountain Massif, the HELA is from 400 to 550 m, in Iskaten Ridge, HELA from 500 to 1000 m, on the Pekulney Ridge, the mean HELA was 740 m, in the Amguema River basin with an average HELA 1400 m. (Kotlyakov et al, 2011).\n\nTo determine the parameters of glaciers the high-resolution satellite images have been used dated by August 2012, which cover the glaciers of these regions, courtesy of program AMAP (Arctic Monitoring Assessment Program), as well as LandSat-7 for the same period, which are in the public access.\n\nWe were able to detect and decipher 27 glaciers in the area of the Iskaten Range, Cross Bay , 16 glaciers in the Providenskiy Massif, 6 in the Lawrence Bay, 5 - on the Pekulnei Range and 19 - in the Kolyma Highlands (the same number as was the specified of R.V. Sedov). In general, the trend is clear: the glaciers have decreased in size as compared to the estimates of late 1980s. Particularly small glaciers of Pekulnei Range “suffered” most, there are not more than 7% of the area remained from that of indicated by R.V. Sedov. The rest of the glacial systems reduced much less, the proportion of the remaining area is of 66% (Kolyma Highlands) to ~ 40% (Iskaten Range).\n\nMethod for estimating glacier systems evolution was described in our papers (Ananicheva and Krenke, 2007, Ananicheva et al, 2010); in this work we had to make some changes, caused by the climate scenario features. In order to project future changes in the morphology and regime of the Chukchi Highlands glacier systems the output data (temperature and precipitation), calculated by the ensemble models A-31 (Kattsov, Govorkova 2013) were used.\n\nThe glaciers of the Chukchi Highlands in 2030, based on chosen climatic scenario (A-31) will reduce in size in different way. Small glaciers will completely disappear from Pekulnei Range, so far НELA has shifted upward maximum (410 m) among other studied systems, and a glacier area remained is just 0.1 km2. Glaciers of Iskaten Ridge (the Cross Bay) and Providence Bay Massif by 2012 have saved more than 40% of their area, and by 2030 they will lose a large part of it which will remain only 6.1%, and 13, 6%, respectively, offset by the time НELAreach 350 m. The best preservation of glaciers belongs to Amguema River basin, located in northeastern Chukotka (~ 60%), but there are small glaciers there, and up to 2030 only ~ 0.7 km2 covered by ice will \"survive\". In total, on the basis of our constructions and the scenario ~ 11.5% of glaciation will remain to 2030. Ablation-accumulation at the НELAto that time will vary from 230 to 680 mm from system to system.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 136 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-130 - The reaction of permafrost of adjacent regions of the Russian Arctic to climate fluctuations of past decades\n\nElsakov, Vladimir Institute of biology Komi Sc UrD RAS, Russian Federation\n\nShow abstract\n\nObjectives of presentation are demonstrate results of D-InSAR technology testing for ongoing changes estimathions in the permafrost research area for terrestrial North Eurasia Arctic ecosystems. As was early illustrated for North Canada (Short et all., 2011) and Central Siberia (Chimitdorziev et.all., 2010; 2011; 2013) the D-InSAR technology can be selected as a one of the most informative monitoring systems, which demonstrate seasonal and interannual changes of Earth surface related with dynamic of active layer depth in present. Few different adjacent cryolitozone regions was taken to account as models. Among them: European North-East (EN), Western (WS) and East (ES) Siberia. Contiguous model areas were selected, since we assume that the characteristics of permafrost East European tundra areas with more ocean-oriented climate and \"weak, warm\" permafrost (Astakhov, Svensen, 2011) are more vulnerable than Urals ecosystems of Siberia. More dry and harsh climatic conditions of the Trans-Urals located in the continental regions are less affected by climate change. We focused on the development of D-InSAR methodology for assessing the thawing permafrost dynamic, since we have compiled a database of land instrumental observations for the period 2000-2015 years in several monitoring sites within the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program. The combination of satellite and field observations extend and improve the D-InSAR technique for estimating the active layer. As a result We develop methodology for large-scale mapping of features of cryolitozone on local (effects of landscapes, geomorphology, glacial sediments and late Pleistocene/Holocene history) and regional (zonal climate specific, permafrost types) levels with satellite data. Possibility of estimates for the relatively warm (2007) and cold (2010) year is the basis for developing a model permafrost changes with effects on the native climatic changes in gradients of latitude-longitude scale and anthropogenic (reindeer grazing system, coal, oil and gas system) effects.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 137 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-219 - Sea Ice thickness in the Northwest Passage\n\nHowell, Stephen (1); Haas, Christian (2) 1: Environment Canada; 2: York University\n\nShow abstract\n\nRecently the feasibility of commercial shipping in the ice-prone Northwest Passage has attracted a lot of attention. However, very little ice thickness information actually exists. We present results of the first-ever airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys over the Northwest Passage carried out in April and May 2011 and 2015 over first-year and multi-year ice. Results show modal thicknesses between 1.8 and 2.0 m in all regions. Mean thicknesses over 3 m and thick, deformed ice were observed over some multiyear ice regimes shown to originate from the Arctic Ocean. Mean ice thickness and deformation decrease with decreasing northern latitude. Thick ice features more than 100 m wide and thicker than 4 m occurred frequently. Although likely thinner than some 20 or more years ago, ice conditions must still be considered severe. These results have important broad implications for the prediction of ice break-up and summer ice conditions, and the assessment of sea ice hazards during the summer shipping season.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 168 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-146 - TanDEM-X Across-Track Interferometry over Snow Covered Terrain: Spatio-temporal Consistency of Scattering Phase Centre Elevation and Interferometric Coherence\n\nPanagiotopoulou, Dimitra; Brown, Ian Anthony Stockholm University, Sweden\n\nShow abstract\n\nBistatic TanDEM-X interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data were used to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) over winter, dry snow conditions in a sub-Arctic site in Norway. Interference patterns were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Open fields and forest stands (slope < 20%), were analysed. Interferometric phase uncertainty and spatio-temporal consistency were analysed by means of scattering phase centre elevation accuracy and coherence degree, γ with respect to hydro-meteorological conditions. Open fields displayed absolute height errors of < 1m. The sole approximation was to consider volume decorrelation effects as main source of elevation ambiguities and coherence decay. Principal Component Analysis was conducted to identify the combined influence of variables describing the radar response and scattering centre. The major findings were that coherence was strongly related to snowpack parameters, and local incidence angle for all land cover classes, while backscatter intensity was related to the coherence degree for the open fields and to forest parameters such as diameter at breast height and stand density for the forest stands. However the derived DEMs attained high vertical accuracy, the sub-meter height errors might relate to snowcover effects. Coherence was strongly influenced by snowpack parameters suggesting TDM coherence inversion may enable snow cover monitoring\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 170 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-229 - Understanding the Interactions Between Arctic Sea Ice and Clouds Using Satellite Data\n\nLiu, Yinghui (1); Key, Jeffrey (2); Letterly, Aaron (1) 1: CIMSS, UW-Madison, United States of America; 2: NOAA/NESDIS\n\nShow abstract\n\nThere have been dramatic changes in the Arctic in the past three decades. One major change is the accelerated declining in the sea ice especially in the summer. Ice-free Arctic summers are predicted by climate models for the coming decades. The cause of the accelerated sea ice decline and its impact on other components of the Arctic climate system is intriguing and under investigation. The cloud feedback is the primary source of uncertainty in model simulations, especially in the Polar Regions. A better understanding of the interaction between sea ice and clouds will provide valuable insight into the Arctic climate system and may ultimately help in improving climate model parameterizations.\n\nSpace-based observations play a critical role in polar climate research. Here we use a variety of satellites to monitor and study the Arctic climate system. Visible, infrared, passive microwave, lidar, and radar altimeter data from Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), Aqua and Terra, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), CryoSat-2, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and NOAA satellites are used individually and collectively to examine the influence of sea ice on cloud cover and vice versa. Two major findings are presented. Results show that a 1% decrease in Arctic sea ice concentration leads to a 0.36 – 0.47% increase in cloud cover, suggesting that a further decline in sea ice cover will result in an even cloudier Arctic. This relationship implies a positive feedback between sea ice and clouds. Results also demonstrate that Arctic wintertime surface cloud forcing can contribute to summer sea ice variations. In particular, winter cloud forcing anomalies in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and East Siberian Seas explain approximately 30% of the variance in late summer sea ice concentration over the period 1982-2014.\n\nOne case study on the application of multiple satellite products in studying the cloud and sea ice interaction is presented. In September 2012, Arctic sea ice extent reached a record minimum for the satellite era. The following winter the sea ice quickly returned, carrying through to the summer when ice extent was 48% greater than the same time in 2012. Using five different satellite products, two climate reanalysis, aircraft data, and a simple ice growth model we show that another factor, below average Arctic cloud cover in January - February 2013, resulted in a more strongly negative surface radiation budget, cooling the surface and allowing for greater ice growth. Areas of ice growth estimated from the negative cloud cover anomaly and advected from winter to summer with ice drift data correspond well with the September ice concentration anomaly distribution.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 172 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-27 - Simulating microwave backscattering through the application of a numerical model to CryoSat-2 data\n\nSlater, Thomas (1); Shepherd, Andrew (1); Arthern, Robert (2); Armitage, Thomas (3) 1: University of Leeds, United Kingdom; 2: British Antarctic Survey, United Kingdom; 3: University College London, United Kingdom\n\nShow abstract\n\nSatellite radar altimetry over ice sheets provides elevation measurements which reveal important properties and behaviours, including fluctuations in mass balance and in the hydrological connections between subglacial lakes. The reliability of these measurements is affected by topographical and sub-surface properties of the snowpack, which exhibit high spatiotemporal variability across Antarctica and Greenland. Of particular note is the observation of temporally correlated fluctuations in elevation and power, which impact radar altimeter range measurements. A numerical model of microwave backscattering is presented which, when applied to satellite waveforms, determines the extent and variation of backscattering across the Antarctic ice sheet, and allows the mapping of sub-surface features. This model is applied to CryoSat-2 data to develop an improved understanding of the variation of scattering properties within the snowpack. In addition, the incorporation of a firn evolution model is explored in order to investigate the source of observed backscatter variations.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 173 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-55 - Fractals in fluctuation of surface elevation in the Antarctic ice sheet\n\nVasiliev, Leonid Nikolaevich; Kotlyakov, Vladimir Mikhailovich; Kachalin, Andrei Borisovich; Moscalivsky, Maxim Yurievich; Tyuflin, Alexander Sergeevich Institute of Geography Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federation\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe reliability of Surface elevation change in Essential Climate Variables in CCI has been analyzed. A complete analysis of ICESAT laser altimeter data between 2003 and 2008 improved understanding of snow drifting. Elevation change of the surface on the Centre part of Antarctic ice sheet with ice velocity about 20 cm/year depends mostly on snow drifting. This process is described as scaling phenomena in order to form a basic understanding provided by the fractional calculus. This non-stationary process is characterized by spatial frequencies in the range 1.5 – 22.5 km. Our data show that short-term changes in drifting snow are common throughout the Central part of the Antarctic ice sheet. Local elevation changes may be in the range ±20 cm. The crucial feature of the process is elevation changes along the repeat ICESAT tracks. They exhibit specific kind of fractal-like behavior and self-similarity in the range of 70 km. An analytical description is difficult to do. Consequently, drifting snow has no characteristic scale length spatial heterogeneity. It became apparent that not just static structures of ice surface especially above subglacial lakes are fractal, but the dynamics are fractal as well including their statistical fluctuations of the actual surface which are Gaussian. The fractal dimension provides an indication of how rough a surface elevation change is. The Hurst exponent directly related to the fractal dimension. Note that all track processes are characterized by Gaussian one-dimensional distribution. The association between seasons and intensity of drifting snow reflects the contrast in fractal dimension and scaling range. Snow drifting is driven by fluctuating velocity wind fields which are fractal statistical process. Spatial frequency of elevation change due to snow drifting was calculated by using wavelet transform. This provided the spatial frequency about 5.5 km and frequency location. There is evidence that the Center part of the Antarctic ice sheet is in the state of dynamical equilibrium.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 186 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-151 - A case study to estimate albedo in Antarctica based on Pleiades satellite images\n\nStaub, Guido; Arriagada, Andrés University of Concepcion, Chile\n\nShow abstract\n\nAlbedo is defined as diffuse reflectivity calculated by the directional integration of reflectance over all sun-view geometries. It can be interpreted as the ratio of solar irradiance reflected from the surface and can be expressed on an interval that ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%). The average albedo of the earth is around 0,31, whereas the albedo of snow and ice ranges from 0,6 to 0,9. During the last centuries climate change and global warming are major concerns as polar ice caps are shrinking and glaciers are retreating. While more ice is melting, more energy irradiated by the sun is absorbed at polar regions and albedo diminishes. As one consequence, ice melt accelerates. The so called positive feedback occurs.\n\nA couple of scientific studies and monitoring programs have revealed that West Antarctica is one of the fastest warming regions globally. Analysis of ground based and satellite observations recorded during the last 50 years show a warming trend of 0,17°C per decade. Significant warming during austral summer period was reported recently, which might result in extensive surface melt with more frequency.\n\nOne possibility to estimate changes in glaciers, ice shelves, etc. is through remote sensing and satellite image processing and analysis techniques. Calculating the albedo of an exposed surface based on remote sensing has repeatedely generated reliable results, which were used in climate change research. We propose to calculate the albedo in Antarctic polar regions by the use of data gathered by optical high resolution remote sensing sensors, more specifically the Pleiades mission. In literature nothing can be found about albedo calculation based on Pleiades satellite imagery. Ground Sampling Distance of panchromatic observations is 50cm and of the 4 spectral bands (R, G, B, NIR) for multispectral imagery it is 2m.\n\nIn particular, we carried out a case study that shows how to calculate the albedo on the northern edge of the George VI ice shelf. In this study we developed an algebraic formula to calculate the albedo. This formula is a linear equation, which comprises the four spectral bands R, G, B and NIR, and 4 coefficients, one for every spectralband. These coefficients have been determined from samples of different snow and ice types. A comparison of the albedo values calculated in this study with those derived from other experiments that can be found in literature indicate that they almost coincide. Statistical significance was analysed based on Fisher's exact test and at 99% level of confidence the test did not fail. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed methodology allows to achieve a high degree of plausibility to calculate albedo from Pleiades high resolution satellite imagery.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 189 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-99 - Extraction of glacier outlines and surface stripes using high-resolution SAR\n\nHuang, Lei; Yang, Yan; Li, Zhen RADI, CAS, China, People's Republic of\n\nShow abstract\n\nSynthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is hardly influenced by weather conditions (such as cloud and precipitation) and solar illumination, provides strong support for glacier change monitoring. SAR is also sensitive to ground moisture and roughness, which enables it to monitor glacier surface changes. For high-resolution SAR, it is found that it presents more details on glacier surface which are invisible on low-resolution or optical images. In this paper, the phase congruency method is applied to extract glacier outlines and stripes using X-band high-resolution SAR imagery in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau collected by the TerraSAR satellites. The phase congruency method, which is independent of the image illumination and magnification, performs excellently in glacier outline and stripe extraction. Two kinds of stripes can be observed and extracted. The first type which is basically parallel to the glacier center axis, is eroded by surface melting water. The second type which is basically perpendicular to the glacier center axis, is the crevasses originating from the tension inside the ice body. In cloudy glacial regions, the SAR-derived outlines are essential tools for yearly glacier mapping. By contrast, the extracted stripes on high-resolution SAR image may provide new long-term indicators of the glacier changes.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 197 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-104 - Exploring the Potential of Polarimetric Circular SAR for Glacier Monitoring: the Findel Glacier Case Study\n\nParrella, Giuseppe (1); Ponce, Octavio (1); Hajnsek, Irena (1,2); Moreira, Alberto (1) 1: German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany; 2: ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nShow abstract\n\nPolarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) sensors represent, nowadays, an established tool for the observation of glaciated areas. Being active microwave systems, SAR systems can operate in nearly all-weather conditions, during the long and dark polar winters. Moreover, exploiting the synthetic aperture concept, they are able to perform large scale and high-spatial resolution observations. At dry conditions, they combine the penetration capability of microwaves into snow/ice and the sensitivity of polarimetry to different scattering mechanisms. Therefore, PolSAR measurements are sensitive to glacier surface as well as near-surface features, especially at lower frequencies (e.g., L-band).\n\nIn the past few years, Circular SAR (CSAR) has become of increasing interest due to its enhanced (sub-wavelength) spatial resolution and 3-D reconstruction capability allowed by multi-angular measurements over 360° [1]-[3]. In this sense, CSAR has the potential to provide a better characterization of the imaged scene, compared to the conventional linear imaging modes, such as stripmap. In fact, the circular trajectory of the sensor allows to observe the scene from a number of different directions and to mitigate the dependency of the backscatter on the imaging geometry (i.e., flight direction and incidence angle).\n\nThe objective of this study is to provide a physical interpretation of L-band polarimetric CSAR (Pol-CSAR) measurements of the Findel Glacier, a temperate glacier located in the Swiss Alps. The data collection took place in October 2014 and March 2015, when two airborne campaigns were flown by the airborne F-SAR sensor of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Data analysis and interpretation are performed applying, for the first time, a polarimetric scattering model to Pol-CSAR data. For this, the model proposed in [4] is employed to retrieve snow and firn parameters of the shallow glacier subsurface [5], of relevance for the estimation of surface mass balance. Validation of the results is performed by means of ground measurements (i.e., GPR profiles, snow depth) collected in coordination with the SAR campaigns.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Ponce, Octavio, et al. \"Fully polarimetric high-resolution 3-D imaging with circular SAR at L-band.\" IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 52, no. 6, pp. 3074-3090, 2014.\n\n[2] Ponce, O., Prats-Iraola, P., Scheiber, R., Reigber, A. and Moreira, A. \"Polarimetric 3-D reconstruction from multicircular SAR at P-band.\" IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 11, no. 4, pp. 803-807, 2014.\n\n[3] Ponce, O., Prats, P., Scheiber, R., Reigber, A. and Moreira, A. \"Polarimetric 3-D Imaging with Airborne Holographic SAR Tomography over Glaciers”, Proceedings of IGARSS 2015, Milan, Italy.\n\nAdditional contents\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 202 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-172 - SAR analysis of the Terra Nova Bay ice gyre of summer 2015.\n\nMoctezuma, Miguel (1); Parmiggiani, Flavio (2); Fragiacomo, Corrado (3); Guerrieri, Lorenzo (4) 1: Dept.

Thanks to the ESA Third Party Mission program, Cosmo-SkyMed and Radarsat-2 image acquisition were ordered for the period 20 February – 20 March, 2015; in addition, available Sentinel-1images over TNB for the same period were retrieved from the ESA Scientific Data Hub. The first inspection of the images revealed the presence of a prominent gyre of surface ice, probably produced by the wind blowing from the continent. Our first goal was to investigate the correlation between gyre area and wind field. Wind data were obtained from the AWS ‘Eneide’ located in proximity of the Italian Antarctic base “Mario Zucchelli Station” at TNB.\n\nA processing scheme was developed for measuring the gyre area; it consists of the following blocks: 1. Non-linear filtering [1]; 2. Segmentation based on the Markov Random Field theory [2-3] and using a contextual approach which considers both the original and the filtered image; 3. Extraction of the gyre parameters, area and perimeter, by means of an active contour detection algorithm which works in an iterative fashion [4].\n\nThe correlation between gyre area and wind field was analysed by means of the running correlation coefficient function Ri which can reveal the consistency between the two variables. Ri attained high values in the period 20February – 15 March; after this date, a powerful katabatic wind completely disrupted the surface ice gyre by displaying a well-defined polynya.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Perona, P., and Malik, J.

In the European Arctic however, these ice charts only get delivered in the late afternoon, and not in the weekends, whereas ships and (mobile) oil rigs are out there around the clock all year round. The ice situation can change rapidly, so that even the 7-8 hours it takes to create a detailed ice chart from satellite images can lead to outdated information and possibly dangerous situations. Accurate, fast information about the ice situation is necessary. KSAT can deliver information about the ice edge in NRT.\n\nAs ships and oil rigs operate near the ice edge, they can rely on this ice edge to get fast, accurate and frequently updated information about its location and plausible movement.\n\nThe ice edge developed by KSAT, delivers accurate, high resolution information within 15 minutes after image acquisition. This ice edge can be created from several sources of SAR imagery, such as RADARSAT-2, COSMO-SKYMED or TerraSAR-X. Moreover, it works on fine scales, since it is automatically drawn with the resolution of the satellite image. In case of Wide Swath imagery, often used in the Arctic, the resolution is 100 meters.\n\nThe ice edge has been tested and approved so far in the Barents Sea, the Fram Strait and the Kara Sea, and has proven to be of use for fishing vessels and oil companies operating in or near the ice edge. KSAT has internally verified the accuracy of the line against the manual ice charts produced by leading meteorological institutes and is continually working to evaluate the statistical performance and to identify areas of relative strength and weakness.\n\nIn short, KSAT’s ice edge gives everyone who is working in ice-infested waters, near the ice edge, consistent, accurate and near-real-time information about the situation near the ship or oil rig.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 218 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-173 - Analysis of the methods of Arctic sea ice freeboard retrieval using ICESat data\n\nKhvorostovsky, Kirill NERSC, Norway\n\nShow abstract\n\nSea ice freeboard derived from satellite altimetry is the basis for estimation of sea ice thickness using assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore a high accuracy of altimeter measurements and freeboard retrieval procedure is required. Currently two approaches for estimation of the freeboard using laser altimeter measurements from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), referred to as tiepoints (Kwok et al., 2007) and lowest-level elevation methods (Zwally et al., 2008), have been developed and applied in different studies. We reproduced these retrieval algorithms in order to assess and analyze the sources of the differences between freeboard estimates for the Arctic sea ice. It was found that approach for determination of sea level references applied in the lowest-level elevation method for some ICESat observation periods underestimates freeboard estimates over thickest part of multy-year ice locally by up to 15 cm. In contrast, tiepoits method tends to underestimate freeboard over vast areas of thin first-year ice by 3-5 cm when using original retrieval algorithms, and by less than 2 cm if applying improvements proposed in this study. Also the effects of different along track resolutions and geoids used in the freeboard retrieval process are found to contribute to the difference between the estimates. In addition, in the studies where freeboard estimates are retrieved by tiepoints method they are corrected for snow depth and presence of ice within the ICESat footprint of samples used to determine sea surface references. An applying of these adjustments can explain a large part of the observed difference in the available products of the Arctic sea ice thickness.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 219 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-38 - A surface elevation changes of the Greenland ice sheet from SARAL/AltiKa satellite radar altimeter\n\nKhvorostovsky, Kirill (1); Simonsen, Sebastian Bjerregaard (2) 1: NERSC, Norway; 2: DTU, Denmark\n\nShow abstract\n\nRadar altimeter measurements from ERS, Envisat and Cryosat-2 ESA’s satellites have been used for study of the ice sheet elevation changes for more than two decades. The follow-on SARAL ISRO/CNES mission with the radar altimeter AltiKa on board was launched in February 2013 on the same orbit as Envisat. However, in contrast to the previous Ku-band radar altimeters, AltiKa operates in Ka-band (36.8 GHz) resulting in smaller footprint, better vertical resolution and decreased penetration of the signal in the snowpack. This work presents Greenland ice sheet surface elevation changes (SEC) derived from the first years of SARAL/AltiKa operation as part of the ESA’s Climate Change Initiative program, which addresses the GrIS as one of the Essential Climate Variables. Seasonal changes in elevation and radar altimeter waveform parameters are estimated using crossover and stacking methods and compared with those derived from ERS, Envisat and CryoSat data.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 231 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-197 - Baltic Sea Ice Concentration Estimation Using SENTINEL-1 SAR\n\nKarvonen, Juha Finnish Meteorological Institute, Finland\n\nShow abstract\n\nSea ice concentration (SIC) is an essential sea ice parameter e.g. for ice navigation, offshore actions, weather forecasting models and climate studies. We have studiedthe use of SENTINEL-1a (S-1a) SAR Extra Wide Swath (EW) mode dual-polarized data with HH/HV polarization combination for estimating SIC over the Baltic Sea. For this purpose we have used the available EW mode HH/HV S-1a data over Baltic acquired during the winters 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The data used in our study are S-1a level 1 GRDM (medium resolution) data, i.e. the pixel spacing is about 40m.\n\nThe data are first calibrated and rectified to Mercator projection, which is also used in the Baltic Sea nautical charts, to ensure compatibility of the SIC product with the on-board navigation systems. Before using the SAR data for automated SIC estimation, an incidence angle correction is performed for both the channels. For HH-channel we apply a linear correction defined experimentally for sea ice. Over open water SAR backscattering is dependent, in addition to the incidence angle, on the local 2-dimensional wave spectrum (local water surface roughness), and correction can not usually be performed as the exact wave spectrum information is missing. For HV-channel the incidence angle and wave spectrum dependence is smaller than for the HH-channel. However, for the HV channel a noise floor correction (equalization)\n\nis necessary, because the S-1a noise floor significantly varies as a function of the range and with respect to the HV signal strength. We perform the noise floor equalization either by using a self-defined statistical equalization (for the season 2015-2015 imagery), or using the noise floor data provided by ESA (for the season 2015-2016 imagery). The reason for using the self-defined statistical correction is that ESA did not provide proper noise floor data until summer 2015.\n\nAfter the calibration and noise floor equalization, georectification and necessary corrections a SAR segmentation is applied. This segmentation is applied to Principal Component (PC) image of the two channels. SIC estimation is performed for each segment produce by the segmentation, i.e. our SIC estimates are segment-wise.\n\nTwo SIC estimation approaches have been studied: a linear and a nonlinear method.\n\nThe inputs for the estimation methods are the HV backscattering coefficient complemented by texture measures (including auto-correlation, entropy, and segment-wise corner pixel count for both the SAR channels) computed for HH and HV channels separately. Also cross-correlation between the two SAR channels has been used as an input. The input features are computed for each segment. For the study the data is divided into training and testing data sets. Training data set is used for defining the estimation parameters and test data set as an independent valuation\n\ndata set. The linear estimation is based on the least-squares fit of the training data set. Because it is in practice very difficult to model the nonlinear relationship between the multiple inputs and SIC, we have used a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network for the nonlinear estimation.\n\nWe also study the joint use of AMSR-2 radiometer data with S-1a data. This can also be seen as preparation for the SENTINEL-3 MWR data (23.8 GHz and 36,5 GHz).\n\nThe digitized FMI ice chart SIC fields have been used as training ground truth and reference data sets for the algorithm evaluation. The estimation results for test data sets from the two seasons will be presented and compared to earlier estimation results (winter 2012-2013) for RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized data. To evaluate the estimation results they will be compared to SIC of FMI ice charts and the 3.125 km ASI AMSR-2 radiometer SIC algorithm.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 232 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-174 - Singular Value Decomposition analysis of Cloud Fraction Cover and Sea Ice Concentration over the Arctic region, 1982-2009.\n\nBoccolari, Mauro (1); Parmiggiani, Flavio (2) 1: Dept.

This is particularly true over the Arctic where the signals of cloudiness alteration result stronger. In this study, the coupled spatial and temporal variability between the monthly anomalies of Cloud Fraction Cover (CFC) and Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) – one of the most important components of Arctic climate – is presented. CFC and SIC data collected from SAF-CM [1] and NSIDC [2], respectively, for the period 1982 – 2009, are analysed using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method [3].\n\nCorrelations between both variables and NAO [4], AO [5] and PNA [6] indices are estimated. The second and the third mode are significantly correlated with the NAO, the major mode of atmospheric variability affecting the Arctic [7]. A deepest seasonal analysis detects higher correlation in the first mode during winter and summer. The spatial patterns of the first mode show areas with the maximum covariance for SIC and CFC located over the Barents Sea and the Beaufort Sea, respectively.\n\n[1] Karlsson K.G., A. Riihelä, R.

Current study is focused on Gulf of Riga that is located in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea. Previous studies have shown that the ice conditions in Gulf of Riga can vary significantly from year to year depending on the weather conditions. Depending on the year the ice cover season starts between late November and middle January. The length of the ice season which can last until late April is in the range of 3-5 months. In addition to interannual ice cover variations there are significant spatial variations between different Gulf areas.\n\nThe use of remote sensing methods enables to monitor ice extent during different winter scenarios. Although during the last years the emphasis in operational ice remote sensing has been on exploiting the capabilities of active sensors (e.g. SAR) the optical imagery can provide valuable information as well. Data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used for ice extent monitoring and for characterization of average winter conditions. We used MODIS data from visible range channels of spectrum with 250 m resolution (620 – 670nm ; 841 – 876 nm) to detect ice extent in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea). In total 366images were used for ice extent detection.\n\nAfter processing all the 366 images the average ice cover maps for different months and years were calculated. The ice cover probability maps were calculated which showed the percentage of time that each pixel was covered by ice. Based on the negative degree days, calculated from the data obtained in Kihnu meteorological station, the winter scenarios were defined. In case the sum of negative degree days (ºC day) is above 400 the winter was considered as severe (2003, 2006, 2010 and 2011). In case of medium (2004 and 2005) winters the corresponding value was between 200 and 400 and for mild (2007, 2008 and 2009) winters the sum of negative degree days was below 200.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 283 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-211 - Comparison and validation of four Arctic Sea ice thickness products of the EC POLAR ICE project\n\nMelsheimer, Christian (1); Mäkynen, Marko (2); Rasmussen, Till (3); Rudjord, Øystein (4); Similä, Markku (2); Solberg, Rune (4); Walker, Nicholas Philip (5) 1: University of Bremen, Germany; 2: Finnish Meteorological Institute; 3: Danish Meteorological Institute; 4: Norwegian Computer Centre; 5: eOsphere Limited\n\nShow abstract\n\nSea ice thickness is a key parameter for understanding changes taking place in polar regions and also for ship navigation and planning of off-shore operations in ice infested waters. In addition, the ocean-atmosphere heat, momentum and gas exchanges are controlled by the sea ice thickness distribution in the polar oceans. As in situ measurements of sea ice thickness are sparse and only represent points in time and space with limited spatial and temporal connections, it is important to have more frequent observations/models and to be able to estimate the uncertainties of these through intercomparison with the ground truth.\n\nCurrently Arctic sea ice thickness information is operationally available mainly as WMO ice type classification in ice charts provided by national Ice Services and as estimates by various ocean-sea ice models. The EC FP7 POLAR ICE project distributes in 2014-2016 three new sea ice thickness products for the Arctic based on satellite data for operational usage: (1) daily thickness map of thin sea ice in the entire Arctic (up to about 0.5 m) retrieved from brightness temperature measurements of the L-band microwave radiometer on the SMOS satellite, with a resolution of 30 to 40 km; (2) daily thickness maps of thin sea in the European Arctic (up to about 0.5 m) derived from VIIRS thermal imagery (subject to cloud cover) with resolution of 750 m, and (3) daily sea ice thickness maps (detected thin ice, and ice thickness 30 to 250 cm) of the Barents and Kara Seas derived from multisensor (AMSR2, SENTINEL-1) data and TOPAZ ocean-sea ice model at resolution of 1 km. All three thickness products are restricted to cold winter conditions (dry snow cover), roughly October to May in the Arctic. Within POLAR ICE, a state-of-the-art coupled ocean and sea ice model (ocean: HYCOM , sea ice: CICE, coupler: ESMF) runs twice a day in an operational mode and produces a 5 day forecast with a resolution of 10 km. Among other parameters, the model also predicts sea ice thickness. POLAR ICE integrates these ice thickness products with other sea ice information products derived from satellite and sea ice model data, so that end-users can readily visualise products, received in near real time, in synergy with one another.\n\nHere we intercompare the three satellite-based ice thickness data sets and the output of the coupled ocean-sea-ice model, and validate them with available in-situ ice thickness data. The aim is to see how well the four sea ice data sets agree, and to find out where and under which conditions mismatches typically occur. The intercomparison of the SMOS and VIIRS thickness maps also allows to compare thin ice thickness estimations based on two different physical relationships; ice thickness vs. microwave emission for SMOS, and ice thickness vs. surface temperature for VIIRS. Comparison to validation data gives estimations of the absolute accuracy of the POLAR ICE thickness charts which is the main information required by end-users.\n\nThe intercomparison is conducted over the Barents and Kara Seas where all three products overlap. In addition, in the Barents Sea, East of Svalbard, a sea ice campaign was conducted in March 2014 (joint ESA SMOSIce campaign and test cruise of German IRO2 project) where sea ice thickness was measured with ship- and helicopter-borne electromagnetic induction (EM) instruments.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 284 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-216 - Sea ice around – Classification of sea ice zones around polynias from multiple sensor data and sea ice dynamics.\n\nHollands, Thomas; Dierking, Wolfgang Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Germany\n\nShow abstract\n\nCoastal polynias are open water areas in the sea ice cover. They are often caused by strong katabatic winds that push the ice offshore. While the ice around the polynia is deformed, new ice formation takes place in the polynia itself. The new ice consolidates at the border to the surrounding pack ice. This highly dynamic regime manifests itself by a high variability of sea ice characteristics. Since the variations of ice characteristics have a strong influence of the heat exchange with the atmosphere as well as on brine release and ice export, it is important to understand atmosphere - sea ice – ocean interactions close to the polyias in a more comprehensive way.\n\nOne major goal of this project is to study the potential of the upcoming Sentinel satellites for polynia research. While not all characteristics of the sea ice can be monitored in a direct way, the combination of satellite sensors and derived products can contribute to a better understanding and reduction of uncertainties. Temperature sensors such as Envisat AATSR can provide implicitly information on the ice thickness or at least thermal conductivity: thin ice and open water will show higher surface temperatures than thick ice. SAR images offer insights into the structure of the sea ice: ridges and deformation zones are highlighted in the ALOS PALSAR L-band image; Envisat ASAR C band images produce a better representation of the individual floes. Optical images from RapidEye, Modis or Landsat provide an impression in natural color, which might allow identifying snow covered regions and help to improve the interpretation of data from the other sensors. By taking into account sea ice drift derived from a satellite image time series it is possible to identify e.g. fast ice regions where the ice does not move. We present a hierarchical classification based on Envisat ASAR, ALOS PALSAR and Envisat AATSR and compare it to an unsupervised ISODATA classification. We demonstrate the effect of drift information on the classification and its advantage for the separation of sea ice regimes with different dynamic characteristics. As an example we present a polynia event in the Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica.. The classification is supplemented by sea ice drift fields derived from SAR time series, wind data from AMPS model simulations from the State University of Ohio, and AWS measurements from the Italian Antarctic research program (PNRA) and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nIn order to extend our studies on sea ice dynamics in and around polynjas we acquired extensive time series of TerraSAR-X images over two test sites in Antarctica during austral spring 2014. Those observations were supplemented by data of other SAR-Satellites and by images of optical sensors on Terra, Aqua, Landsat and RapidEye. Based on our anaylsis of the 2009 data we will present first results for the time series acquired 2014.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 293 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-240 - Semi-automatic coast line determination for the Chilean Antarctic Territory\n\nStaub, Guido (1); Báez, Juan Carlos (2); Gatica, Cesar (3); Hervias, Carla (3); Toledo, Leonardo (3) 1: University of Concepcion, Chile; 2: University of Chile, Chile; 3: Dirección Nacional de Fronteras y Limites (DIFROL), Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Chile\n\nShow abstract\n\nA coastline can be interpreted as the line where land and water bodies are in contact. Due to its dynamic nature it is not static and worldwide coastlines are rapidly changing due to natural physical processes and human activities. In addition, global climate change and glacial isostatic adjustment have huge impacts on coastline variability. Therefore, an exact delineation of the coastline is required to describe the physical form of the coastal zone where interaction processes happen.\n\nIn case of the Antarctic continent this task is not very simple due to its huge variablity the whole year round. Ice-cover, snowmelt, very low temperatures, day night cycle and other considerations have to be kept in mind when mapping has to be carried out. Navigation and exploration depend on information about position, shape and orientation of the Antarctic coastline. Furthermore, to understand the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change, an accurate coastline map is essential.\n\nExcept the relevant cartographic products for navigation, map products for the baseline of the Chilean Antarctic Territory are obsolete. Therefore we carried out an extensive study aiming coastline estimation based on SAR observations and Digital Surface Models (obtained from TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X stereo pairs). Furthermore we considered in-situ field surveying and ground control points determination by GNSS technologies and high resolution spaceborne optical imagery. The combination of all these techniques allow us to extract a complete coastline, with adequate precision for modern global geodetic datums, like WGS84, which are compatible with global navigation based on artificial satellites.\n\nIn particular, we studied a combination of the 2013/2014 SAR observations acquired during summer months, for 15 specific study sites between 53°W and 90°W of the Chilean Antarctic Territory with special attention on outermost islands. Our semi-automatic approach is based on a sequence of modern techniques for image enhancement and edge detection. In particular, image segmentation and classification are applied to differentiate between ice bodies (continental or floating) or rock exposures and open water. The segmented images are then transformed into vector based products to define the final coastline. Finally we compare the extracted coastline with the in-situ observations and the high resolution optical images. Unfortunately acquisition times of optical images and SAR differ. Nevertheless, the comparison lets us assume that the results are consistent as horizontal mean difference between DSM and optical images is less than 100m (except Charcot Island where horizontal accuracy was about 200m). This processing chain allows straightforward processing of DSM for coastline extraction, which is almost independent of the study area.\n\nIn conclusion, all of the results fully comply with technical aspects in relation to map generation. For cartographic and scientific applications, the Ground Sampling Distance (10m) of the SAR observations is adequate. Procedures and methodologies were adjusted which are in state of the art of geodetic surveying and modern image processing. This DSM based, and supported by high resolution optical imagery and GNSS observations, coastline allows to describe with high level of confidence the geometric shape of the study area and the boundary between the continental ice or rock exposures and the ocean.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 295 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-224 - Colour tables and sea-ice information products and forecasts: flexibility versus consistency. Allowing polar mariners to understand multiple ice products within a common visualisation system\n\nBerglund, Robin (1); Walker, Nicholas P (2); Seitsonen, Lauri (1) 1: Technical Research Centre of Finland, Finland; 2: eOsphere Limited\n\nShow abstract\n\nIn order to interpret ice information products correctly and efficiently, it is important to have the information presented in a consistent way. There are standards and recommendations for some ice parameter (like ice concentration), but not for all (e.g. ice thickness). In a system where the user can access many kinds of Near-Real-Time sea-ice related products from different providers, this issue is prominent. The challenge is how to present these products in a way that is consistent and non-confusing, thus fulfilling the requirement that the colour scheme should be harmonised per physical parameter. Also different physical parameters should preferably use different colour schemes so that the user immediately recognises which parameter is displayed on the screen. Taking into account different production environments on the producers’ side, an adaptive mechanism has been implemented to ingest the products in a flexible way. The principle adopted is to use a layered approach where the values in the raster products are mapped to either explicit categories or to ranges of physical values. The physical values are then mapped to colour ranges thus ensuring that the same physical value is shown in the same colour independent of the origin. The approach also enables changing of the colour mapping for all products showing the same physical parameter, in a simple and consistent way. Changing of the colour mapping is needed for optimal display of values in subareas or varying seasons, when – for example – the ice thickness range differ.\n\nThe paper concentrates on the visualisation issue when dealing with products from multiple providers but also describes the architecture of the Polar Ice system which is designed and implemented as part of the ongoing FP7 Polar Ice project . The building blocks, interfaces and the general principles of the user interface in Polar Ice are presented as well as feedback gathered from the users of the system during focused demonstrations.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 302 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-84 - Investigating the unusual dynamics of the Flade Isblink Ice Cap, NE Greenland, using satellite radar observations\n\nPalmer, Steven John University of Exeter, United Kingdom\n\nShow abstract\n\nIce caps and glaciers are important present‐day indicators of the ongoing global climate change, and they are the component of the cryosphere currently making the largest contribution to sea level change (Vaughan et al., 2013). Arctic ice caps are of particular interest as air temperatures at high northern latitudes are increasing more rapidly than elsewhere (Serreze & Francis, 2006).\n\nThe Flade Isblink Ice Cap (FIIC) is situated in Kronprins Christian Land, Eastern North Greenland (Figure 1). With an area of 8 500 km2, it is the largest independent ice cap in Greenland (Kelly and Lowell, 2009). The northern part of the ice cap is drained by two main outlet glaciers flowing to the Northwest, which have experienced several cycles of advance and retreat. While previous remote sensing studies of the FIIC outlet glaciers have observed temporal variations in ice velocity and anomalous changes in surface elevation, the mechanism behind the changes remains unknown. Using results from satellite InSAR, Joughin et al. (2010) reported that the two largest FIIC outlet glaciers slowed to sometime between 2000 and 2005. Rinne et al. (2011) showed that while the average surface elevation change rate of the FIIC was near zero (0.03 ± 0.03 m yr-1) between 2002 and 2009, rates of ice thickening in the NW part of the ice cap were up to 3.4 ± 0.7 m yr-1 during the period 2004 to 2008.\n\nAdditional observations are required to improve our understanding of the unusual dynamics exhibited by the FIIC, and to better predict the future contribution of Arctic ice caps to global sea level.\n\nTo measure past ice flow velocities, InSAR data acquired by ESA’s ERS satellites during the Tandem mission phase during winter 1995 were used (Palmer et al., 2010). The time series of ice flow observations was extended to the present by using the MEaSUREs dataset (Joughin et al., 2010) and ESA Sentinel-1 data. These results are shown in figure 1; changes in the direction as well as speed of ice flow can be seen.\n\nWhile the data presented above helps to describe the changes in the dynamics of the outlet glaciers, they do not reveal the underlying mechanisms of change. The presence of subglacial water can profoundly alter the dynamics of ice flow, and changes in the configuration of the hydrological system at the bed are likely to have played a role in the change in ice flow between 2000 and 2005. Evidence that water flows periodically at the bed of the ice cap is provided by recent satellite observations (Willis et al., 2015) which have revealed the presence of a surface collapse basin near the summit of the ice cap. This feature has been interpreted as being the surface expression of a drained subglacial lake, examples of which have also been observed recently beneath the main Greenland Ice Sheet (Palmer at al., 2013). Given the relatively thin ice (max 535 m) and low annual mean air temperature, it is unlikely that temperature at the ice base reaches the pressure melting point, so the subglacial lake must be fed by surface meltwater.\n\nAlthough the mechanism behind the observed change in ice dynamics is not yet known, ESA’s Sentinel satellites have the potential to provide the high resolution geophysical data required to improve our understanding of the FIIC and other Arctic ice caps.\n\nReferences\n\nJoughin, I., et al (2010).

Its primary payload is a radar altimeter that operates in different modes optimised depending on the kind of surface: Low resolution mode (LRM), SAR mode (SAR) and SAR interferometric mode (SARin). This radar is named SIRAL: Synthetic aperture interferometer radar altimeter [1].\n\nTransponders are commonly used to calibrate absolute range from conventional altimeter waveforms because of it characteristic point target radar reflection. The waveforms corresponding to the transponder distinguish themselves from the other waveforms resulting from natural targets, in power and shape.\n\nESA has deployed a transponder available for the CryoSat project (a refurbished ESA transponder developed for the ERS-1 altimeter calibration). It is deployed at the KSAT Svalbard station: SvalSAT. Another transponder has been deployed by Technical University of Crete for the Sentinel 3 calibration in the island of Crete.\n\nWe are using the transponder to calibrate SIRAL’s range, datation, and interferometric baseline (or angle of arrival) to meet the missions requirements [2]. In these calibrations, we are using 3 different type of data: the raw Full Bit Rate data, the stack beams before they are multi-looked (stack data) in the Level 1b processor, and the Level 1b data itself [3].\n\nIdeally the comparison between (a) the theoretical value provided by the well-known target, and (b) the measurement by the instrument to be calibrated; provides us with the error the instrument is introducing when performing its measurement [4]. When this error can be assumed to be constant regardless the conditions, it will provide the bias of the instrument. And if the measurements can be repeated after a certain period of time, it can also provide an indication of the instrument drift.\n\nThis poster presents the analysis and results of this calibration with the Baseline C. The work presented here was initially carried out under an ESTEC/ESA contract, to calibrate CryoSat-2 during the Commissioning phase. It was later extended with an ESRIN/ESA contract, for continue monitoring and including further analysis.\n\n[1] C.R.

Gravitational deflection of the local vertical in flat Arctic areas with irregular gravity attains 10’’ and the horizontal component of surface gravity is characterized by an acceleration of 0.5 mm/s². This persistent forcing induces low-level air movements towards the centre of positive gravity anomalies, or away from the centre of negative anomalies (see Annex). Under calm weather conditions lasting for several hours the velocity of centripetal flows can reach 3-4 m/s, which is close to the threshold wind speed for snow drifts. Air convergence at the Earth’s surface leads to upward vortex motion of air masses with subsequent cooling, condensation of water vapour, cloud formation and local precipitation, e.g. in the form of snow, and centripetal transport of loose snow along the solid surface may result. The adjacency of negative anomaly facilitates the effect of air uplift and gradient precipitation in the area of positive gravity anomaly. The whirling movement of the near-surface air about the centre of positive gravity anomalies is responsible for the regular shape of ice caps emerging on the flat ground and enhances snow accumulation on top of them. This provides some hints on the spatial asymmetry in the distribution of insular ice caps, their changes and ice flow pattern in the Eurasian Arctic regions with synoptically similar conditions.\n\nThe gravigenic non-orographic concept of gradient precipitation and ice cap evolution has yet to be verified and, in the present paper, we try to provide more substantial EO-based evidence to justify the hypothesis about the directional dynamics of Arctic ice caps in anomalous gravity fields. ERS, TDX and Sentinel-1A SAR interferometric models calibrated with ICESat and CryoSat-2 altimetry data were successfully applied to mapping and quantifying glacier elevation changes and ice flow on fifty insular ice caps in the northernmost region of the Eurasian Arctic ranging from Svalbard in the west to the De Long Islands in the east. The resultant maps were collocated and compared with available data on the Arctic gravity field and 25-year long records of daily precipitation obtained from 57 coastal meteorological stations. Free-air gravity anomalies were graphically represented in the reference model geometry using Russian gravimetric maps 1:1000000 (1980s), ArcGP grid (2008) and GOCE gravity field data (Release 3, 2009-2011 and Release 5, 2009-2013).\n\nThe main interrelationships determined for topographically smooth and open areas with a very cold, dry climate were summarized as follows. Lateral variations of gravity directly influence the ambient lapse rate, thereby modulating the atmospheric stability and increasing the intensity and frequency of heavy snowfalls over the areas with positive gravity anomalies. Most ice caps are situated within or in the close vicinity of positive gravity anomalies, while the majority of glacier-free islands and peninsulas with relatively large surface areas and significant top heights are situated in areas of low gravity. The main loss of land ice of up to 3.1 km³/a occurred in the seaward margins of ice caps, especially at the fronts of fast-flowing tidewater outlet glaciers and in the area of ice tongues or bridges. The highest rates of positive elevation changes of about 1 m/a were observed in the accumulation areas of large slow-moving ice caps in the vicinity of strong positive gravity anomalies. Passive ice caps were typically found in the areas with normal gravity.\n\nOn most ice caps with a regular shape on a flat bed the orientation of the ice flow pattern generally followed the directions of the maximum gravity gradient, and main ice divides were nearly parallel to anomaly isopleths. Sometimes, depending on the mutual configuration of gravity anomaly and glacier morphology, outlet glaciers flowed towards centres of positive gravity anomalies. The elongated areas of snow drift detected in radar coherency images were located within 50 to 80 kilometres distance from the centre of the dominant positive gravity anomaly and were oriented towards the anomaly’s centre. No snow drift was observed between the ice caps. The correlation between the gravity gradient and glacier dynamics decreased in mountainous and humid areas, as e.g. in the south-western part of Svalbard. The aggregate of EO-based indications and contraindications on glacioclimatic trends in Arctic regions with anomalous gravity derived with the aid of satellite gradiometry, altimetry and interferometry (GAIN method) is a meaningful contribution to the theory of glacial isostasy, retrospective glaciological reconstructions and long-term climate projections as it provides a better understanding of the physical relationships between the Earth’s gravity, glaciation and climate.\n\nAdditional contents\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 316 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-254 - Remote oil spill detection and monitoring beneath sea ice\n\nPolak, Adam Tomasz (1,2); Marshall, Stephen (2); Ren, Jinchang (2); Hwang, Byongjun {Phil} (3); Hagan, Bernard (3); Stothard, David J.

This poses very significant challenges to any extenuating activities until well after the emerging oil has been located. This project employs cutting edge technology to 'see' the oil beneath the ice and to monitor its spread. This will allow mitigation technologies such as floating restraint barriers and clean-up operations to be ready precisely at the point the oil emerges.\n\nOur study presents results of lab-based trials that eventually leads to the field deployment of hyperspectral imaging technology (HSI) in Polar Regions to detect the oil seepage underneath sea ice.\n\nHyperspectral imaging is an emerging technology which uses a new type of camera to capture the spectral signature of a scene. It is the next stage in the logical extrapolation of the technology development which took us from monochrome (black and white) imaging to colour imaging. However, whereas these two image types can be viewed by the human eye, hyperspectral images contain detail beyond human vision.\n\nIn monochrome imaging each pixel has a single brightness value, in colour imaging each pixel has three values (red, green, blue) associated with it, but in hyperspectral imaging each pixel has a whole spectrum of values. With the correct processing this spectrum can provide valuable information about the subject being viewed such as its moisture, temperature and even chemical content. Each material reflects a different spectrum or 'spectral signature'. It is well known that the spectral signature of oil is very different from the spectral signature of sea ice.\n\nThere are several different types of hyperspectral imaging technology and application of each of them may be beneficial for different tasks. Depending on the type of underlying technology, the cameras can 'see' a different depth into the ice and determine different properties of objects. Within our study we focus on quantifying the limits of detection of oil beneath ice with two technologically and spectrally different hyperspectral imagers. The goal of this research is to answer the questions of what is the maximum thickness of ice that hyperspectral imaging can detect oil and what is the minimum concentration of oil that can be detected with different HSI systems.\n\nEquipped with state-of-the-art facilities, equipment and signal processing tools, this study provides reliable overview of HSI capabilities for oil spill detection beneath sea ice and by understanding the limits of this detection we will have the knowledge to design a system to be deployed in the field.\n\nAdditional contents\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 335 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-232 - Current status of ice shelves in Dronning Maud Land, East-Antarctica.\n\nvan Oostveen, Jelte (1,2); Deschamps-Berger, César (1,3); Moholdt, Geir (1); Kääb, Andreas (2); Lee, Ian (4); Matsuoka, Kenichi (1) 1: Norwegian Polar Institute, Tromsø, Norway; 2: University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; 3: Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France; 4: University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA\n\nShow abstract\n\nRetreat and thinning of Antarctic ice shelves triggers acceleration of tributary glaciers and can potentially cause a significant mass deficit of the Antarctic Ice Sheet with a consequent influence on global sea level. Our current understanding of these processes is largely developed based on observations in the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, which may not be applicable to East Antarctica.\n\nDronning Maud Land (DML, 30W – 45E), the Atlantic and Indian Sea sector of East Antarctica, is characterized by many, relatively small ice shelves distributed along its ~1500-km-long coast. Many of these are punctuated by grounded features (ice rises and rumples) that have a significant impact on the ice shelf stability, but details of this mechanism remain poorly known. Possible dynamic coupling between adjacent ice shelves further complicates their sensitivity to climatic and oceanic changes.\n\nIn autumn 2014 we started a new project utilizing a range of satellite observations to document the current status (calving positions, surface features, flow speeds, freeboard heights) of the DML ice shelves and estimate their current and past mass balance. We first analyzed Radarsat-2 ScanSAR data collected in the central DML (15W-40E) and compared the ice shelf edge positions with other datasets. It was found that the calving front of most ice shelves appears to be stable over the past decade. Only 8 out of 31 fronts retreated considerably due to calving of icebergs larger than 10km2. Using a Radarsat-2 Fine Wide campaign dataset collected between November 2014 and January 2015, visible features are mapped as proxies of flow stripes, rifts, and crevasses. These images also form the main dataset for a current effort to develop a semi-automated speckle-tracking scheme to extract flow fields of the DML ice shelves. As the vast majority of the coastal DML is subject to movement, we make use of outcrops, ice-divides and slowly moving ice (< 5m/yr based on Rignot et al. 2011) to facilitate accurate co-registration. Once robustness of this scheme is assessed, we will apply the same scheme for ERS, Envisat and ALOS data to retrieve ice flow fields from the past decade(s). The scheduled semi-annual Sentinel 1 campaigns over DML will bring an excellent opportunity for us to continue monitoring the ice flow in the years to come. Ultimately, we will be using our ice flow products together with IceSAT/Cryosat altimetry data and surface mass balance model runs to calculate mass balance of the DML ice shelves.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 344 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-101 - Glacier Dynamics of George VI Ice Shelf Tributary Glaciers from SAR Feature Tracking\n\nBhattacharya, Atanu (1); Buchroithner, Manfred (1); Staub, Guido (2) 1: TU Dresden, Germany; 2: University of Concepcion, Chile\n\nShow abstract\n\nGlaciers and ice sheets or caps are sensitive indicators of global climate change. Together with thermal expansion it is responsible for sea level rise.At present, ice bodies cover approx.10 % of the Earth’s land surface, majority of which is present inthe polar regions, which is equivalent to three quarter of the world’s total fresh water resources. The retreat of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, as well as that of glaciers worldwide, is a major consequence of global warming.During the last three decades various ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have retreatedand disintegrated. The Larsen B Ice Shelf, which disappeared in 2002 in just over 30 days, is only one example.Several studies around the globe have also been indicated disintegration of differentice shelvesof Antarctic Peninsula such as Prince Gustav Channel (1995), Larsen A (1995), Larsen Inlet (1999), Larsen B (2002) and the Jones Ice Shelf (2003).In 2009the ice bridge which connected the Wilkins Ice Shelf and Charcot Island collapsed.\n\nOn the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, George VI Shelf is embedded in George VI sound, surrounded by Bellingshausen Sea. Recent observations have shown that the northern and southern boundaries of the George VI Ice Shelf suffer under constant retreat for decades. Therefore a systematic analysis of George VIice shelf and its tributaryglaciersis a paramount interest in order to understand theirbehaviour and environmental interaction.\n\nIce dynamics,and in particular, glacier velocity is an important control on ice discharge rate. Deriving surface velocity fields of glaciers and ice shelves using satellite images is an efficient,low-costmethod, which has been used since the mid 1980s.\n\nRemote sensing techniques provide an efficient way to collect dataofremoteregions due to its large spatial coverage.Fieldsurveys, time-lapse camera surveys, satellite image feature tracking of optical and SAR data and SAR interferometry (InSAR) are techniques by which velocity of the motion may be determined. However, due to the positional disadvantage of glaciers,fieldsurvey commonly results in sparse spatial coverage. Moreover due to loss of coherence and unavailability of finer resolution DEM, velocity measurements by InSARcannot produce high accuracies. On the contrary, offset tracking in SAR imagery is more useful for measuring flow velocities over longer periods.\n\nTherefore, in this study an attempt has been made to derive the velocity field of some tributary glaciersof George VI ice shelfby SAR feature tracking technique using ERS-2 C-band data. Velocity fields have derived within 35 days temporal interval over the period from 2002 to 2011. The SAR data have been selected during the ablation period. Before feature tracking, both SAR images have been co-registered within an accuracy of 1/5th of a pixel usingcross correlation intensity algorithm.After the co-registration the estimation of the shift between displaced features have been estimated. Velocity in the range fromapprox. 10 to 70 meter during 35 days have been obtained for some of the tributaries of George VI sound. However, unrealistic velocity profile has been observedalong the main George VI sound dueto the unavailability of sufficient displaced features.Though this technique has gained its reliability but due to the presence of ionospheric disturbances sometimes erroneous offset estimation in azimuth direction can be identified. It has been observed that longer wavelength radar signals are mainly affected by such ionospheric disturbances. It is thus assumed that the velocity estimate can be refined by using TerraSAR-X data which are less affected by ionospheric disturbances.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 359 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-206 - Sea ice drift from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery using open source feature tracking\n\nMuckenhuber, Stefan; Korosov, Anton; Sandven, Stein Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, Norway\n\nShow abstract\n\nSea ice motion strongly influences the distribution of sea ice on different spatial and temporal scales. The coverage and quality of high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images has strongly improved during the last years, which allows to derive sea ice motion with high spatial (1 km) and temporal resolution. Such high-resolution ice drift data are not yet provided. The approach is to exploit recent improvements in computer vision by using state of the art feature tracking algorithms. A computational efficient, open source feature tracking algorithm, called ORB, is adopted and tuned for sea ice drift retrieval from Sentinel-1 SAR images. The best suitable setting and parameter values have been found using four representative Sentinel-1 image pairs. A new quality measure for feature tracking algorithms is introduced utilising the distribution of the resulting vector field. The performance of the algorithm is compared with two other feature tracking algorithms (SIFT and SURF). Applied on a test image pair acquired over Fram Strait, the tuned ORB algorithm produces the highest number of vectors (6920, SIFT: 1585 and SURF: 518) while being computational most efficient (66s, SIFT: 182s and SURF: 99s using a 2,7GHz processor with 8GB memory). For validation purpose, 350 manually drawn vectors have been compared with the closest calculated vectors and the resulting root mean square distance is 609.9m (equivalent to 7.5pixel). All test image pairs show a significant better performance of the HV channel. On average, around 4 times more vectors have been found using HV polarisation. All software requirements necessary for applying the presented feature tracking algorithm are open source to ensure a free and easy implementation. Comparison with a pattern matching algorithm from AWI has shown the respective advantages and upcoming work will include the combination of the 2 algorithms.\n\nAdditional contents\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 373 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-176 - Sea ice monitoring using scatterometers\n\nGirard-Ardhuin, Fanny IFREMER, France\n\nShow abstract\n\nMicrowave sensors onboard polar orbit satellites are commonly used for sea ice monitoring at high latitude : radiometers are routinely used for this application and scatterometers have also shown they can contribute significantly to it. Since 1991, numerous scatterometers data at C and Ku-bands are available since ERS-1 with NSCAT, QuikSCAT, OSCAT, HY, and ASCAT sensors. Here, we will show how the scatterometers sensors could be used to build Earth Observation data time series for sea ice monitoring for both Arctic and Antarctic areas.\n\nBackscatter data enable to discriminate sea ice from open ocean areas, in particular scatterometers are useful to detect new ice, even at the early stage of growth which is not possible using radiometers.Backscatter data from scatterometer can also be used for sea ice type detection (first year from multi-year sea ice in the Arctic), results and differences between C-band and Ku-band sensors results will be presented.\n\nMoreover, sea ice displacement maps can be built in central Arctic from backscatter data, examples will be shown using the merging of scatterometer and radiometer data. We will also focus on the benefit of the use of the two ASCAT sensors that are presently available (onboard MetOp-A -since 2007 and -B, since 2012), in particular for the Antarctic area.\n\nThis presentation will enhance i) the need of scatterometer data for sea ice application with many examples of the inferred parameters in particular from the U.S. QuikSCAT/SeaWinds and the E.U.

The ASCAT calibrated reprocessed data (2007-2014) are now available and have been processed at IFREMER/CERSAT, added to the SeaWinds/QuikSCAT dataset (1999-2009), they will provide an exceptional basis for future analysis and synthesis of long-term variations of the sea ice in both Arctic and Antarctic polar areas.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 388 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-15 - Cryosat2 insights in the Mediterranean Circulation through wavelet multi-resolution analysis and selective filtering\n\nVergos, Georgios S.; Natsiopoulos, Dimitrios A.; Tziavos, Ilias N. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nShow abstract\n\nModeling the Dynamic Ocean Topography (DOT) and determining the circulation pattern of the ocean currents has always been a challenging task in the Mediterranean Sea. This is mainly due to a) the limited number of satellite altimetry data in the area, given land intrusion by the isles and islands, b) the limited number of gravity-related data, so that the geodetic determination of the DOT was deemed as low-accuracy and c) the nature of the Mediterranean circulation itself, being mainly the result of small-scale gyres and eddies as well as cyclones and anti-cyclones. The only satellite altimetry missions that offered a deeper insight to the Mediterranean DOT and circulation where the Geodetic Missions (GM) of GEOSAT and ERS1, which offered dense cross-track resolution, but with lower-accuracy compared to today’s altimetric standards. To tackle the aforementioned limiting factors, two pillars need to be addressed, i.e., improved representations of the long and medium wavelength geoid information and higher accuracy and resolution satellite altimetry data. The mission of GOCE treats the first part of the equation, offering a 1-2 cm geoid accuracy to harmonic degrees 220-240 (~82-90 km). At the same time, ESA’s Crysosat2 mission, given its orbit characteristics and measurement modes, offers a very dense (~7-8 km) cross-track resolution with an accuracy of ~1.5-2 cm for the LRM. Cryosat gives a 5.7-5.8 cm std differences at the crossovers, which is at the same level as that of ENVISAT and Jason2, therefore it can be used for sea level anomaly, geoid and DOT modelling, especially in closed seas like the Mediterranean. The main scope of the present study is to utilize the satellite altimetry data of Cryosat2, from mission start in July 2010 up to the end of 2015 (Cycles 4 to 73) and the latest DIR-R5 and TIM-R5 GOCE-derived global geopotential models in order to determine the DOT and circulation for the Mediterranean Sea. For the DOT determination, filtering is first investigated to model and remove/reduce the effects of the geoid omission and commission errors. Spatial filtering is based on Gaussian, Wiener, cosine arch and boxcar filters, while the spectral filtering was carried out with wavelet (WL) Multi-resolution analysis (MRA). Based on the spectral properties of each WL level relative to a ground-truth DOT, some of these levels were omitted while others have been filtered based on selective filtering. Within the entire DOT evaluation, the RIO_MED synthetic DOT model for the Mediterranean was used as ground-truth, both for the WL-MRA filtering and in order to assess the GOCE-derived DOT models. Other DOT models, like the standard SMDT-MED-2014 and MDT_CNES-CLS13 used for the reduction of altimetric observations by AVISO/CNES have been validated as well.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 391 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-100 - Re-Processing of SAR Data for Derivation of Glaciological Parameters on the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nFriedl, Peter (1); Braun, Matthias (2); Höppner, Kathrin (1); Lorenz, Rainer (1); Seehaus, Thorsten (2); Diedrich, Erhard (1) 1: German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany; 2: Friedrich-Alexander Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is one of the world`s most affected regions by Climate Change. Long-term remote sensing time series enable to study changes and to reveal information on the underlying processes of the cryosphere as well as the interlinkages with the atmosphere.\n\nThe German Antarctic Recieving Station (GARS) at O'Higgins operated by the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD/DLR) has acquired data from the two European Space Agency (ESA) European Remote Sensing satellite mission (ERS-)1/2 between 1991 and 2011. Data of other space borne SAR sensors such as ESA`s ENVISAT ASAR, JAXA`s (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) ALOS PALSAR, RadarSat-1, DLR`s TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X or the European mission Sentinel-1 will complement to a dense time series of SAR measurements from the 1990s until today for several regions of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nDifferential interferometric synthetic radar (DInSAR) methods and intensity tracking are applied inorder to derive important glaciological parameters such as grounding line positions, glacier velocities, surface elevations, ice mass fluxes and glacier mass balances. Additionally, calibrated SAR amplitude images as well as images taken by optical sensors (e.g. Landsat) are used to map glacier extends and to compute changes of glacier areas.\n\nWe represent first results of a case study at the Wordie Ice Shelf, located at the south-western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. This ice shelf disintegrated in a series of events during the 1970s and 1980s, so that already in the beginning of the 1990s only disconnected and retreating tidewater glaciers remained. Due to the loss of the buttressing effect of the ice shelf, an increased ice mass discharge has been observed. An increase of flow speeds and elevation decrease have been reported by previous studies – mainly on a bi-temporal basis. However, how long and how exactly in time this process of adaption to the new boundary conditions will last as well as how much ice mass loss and sea level rise is caused by this process is yet not well known. Thus we use dense SAR time series in conjunction with data on surface elevation from photogrammetry and laser/radar altimetry, ground penetrating radar as well as surface mass balance simulations to target more precise estimates as well as data sets that can be better compared with large-scale observations by the GRACE gravimetry mission.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 400 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-177 - On producing sea ice deformation data sets from SAR-derived sea ice motion\n\nBouillon, Sylvain (1,2); Rampal, Pierre (1,2) 1: Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, Norway; 2: Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research\n\nShow abstract\n\nWe propose a method to reduce the error generated when computing sea ice deformation fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived sea ice motion. The method is based on two steps. The first step consists of using a triangulation of the positions taken from the sea ice trajectories to define a mesh on which a first estimate of sea ice deformation is computed. The second step consists of applying a specific smoother to the deformation field to reduce the artificial noise that arises along discontinuities in the sea ice motion field. This method is here applied to RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) sea ice trajectories having a temporal and spatial resolution of about 3 days and 10 km, respectively. From the comparison between unfiltered and filtered fields, we estimate that the artificial noise causes an overestimation of about 60 % of opening and closing. The artificial noise also has a strong impact on the statistical distribution of the deformation and on the scaling exponents estimated with multifractal analysis. We also show that a similar noise is present in the deformation fields provided in the widely used four-point deformation RGPS data set. These findings may have serious implications for previous studies as the constant overestimation of the opening and closing could lead to a large overestimation of freezing in leads, salt rejection and sea ice ridging.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 401 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-142 - Modeling of Boreal Forest Canopy Effects in Satellite Snow Mapping – a Multisensor Analysis\n\nCohen, Juval (1); Lemmetyinen, Juha (1); Pulliainen, Jouni (1); Heinilä, Kirsikka (2); Montomoli, Francesco (3); Seppänen, Jaakko (4); Hallikainen, Martti T.

Optical and active microwave sensors are commonly used when estimating snow covered area, whereas passive microwave satellite sensors are suitable for snow water equivalent retrieval in dry snow conditions. A large portion of areas which experience seasonal snow cover are located in the boreal forest region. Without considering the effects of forest canopy on the observed signal, snow retrieval results with all sensor types in these areas would be biased. Various models describing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the forest canopy have been developed, but many of these are overly complex with high computational and ancillary data requirements. For operational snow retrieval purposes, simple, invertible models are preferred.\n\nThis work aims at increasing the understanding of the effect of forest canopy on remote sensing observations of snow-covered terrain for both microwave and optical regimes, and at quantifying the capability of simple, zeroth-order models in simulating these effects. To achieve these goals, a spatial analysis of various remote sensing data in the northern boreal forest region of Finland was performed. The forest contribution was first analyzed for an airborne optical sensor, then for X- and Ku-band airborne active microwave sensors, an X-band space borne sensor, and finally for airborne passive microwave sensors ranging from X- to Ka-bands. Model parameters for vegetation transmissivity as well as the properties of the underlying surface were optimized by utilizing LiDAR- and Landsat based simplified proxy parameters describing forest canopy closure and stem volume.\n\nThe results of this study demonstrated that despite using these relatively simple forest proxies, an optimized zeroth-order model can estimate the extinction properties of electromagnetic signals in a forest canopy to a high degree of accuracy. In particular, model estimates showed a high degree of correlation against HUTRAD passive microwave and AISA airborne optical data, with r2 values ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 depending on the observation spectral band and the day of observation (not including 10 GHz band in passive microwave and NIR band in optical). Moreover, in all sensor types, the model estimate for ground/snow contribution was very close to the values observed for open terrain. The SAR model successfully estimated the median of the observations i.e. bias was small, but compared to the optical and passive microwave models, a larger scatter of the observations, typical to SAR sensors, was reflected by higher RMSE and lower correlation with the model.\n\nForward models applied in retrieval algorithms need to be relatively simple in nature due to both computational and ancillary data restrictions. Compared to higher order models, the presented zeroth order models satisfy both of these requirements. Furthermore, it was shown that a single parameter or proxy value describing the forest properties (stem volume or canopy closure) provided the necessary correlation with the observed signal dynamics, required to fit the models to the observations. This is particularly encouraging as it implies that forest canopy effects can be regulated in retrieval algorithms even if complex multiple scattering effects are neglected. Furthermore, compensation for canopy effects can be made using data which is already available, or can be retrieved from other remote sensing observations.\n\nUploaded poster contents (QRCode)\n\n[Authors] [ Overview programme] [ Keywords]\n\nPaper 426 - Session title: Cryosphere Posters\n\nCRYO-8 - Porting of CryoSat-2 Mission Control System to new Operating System and Hardware\n\nMaestroni, Elia (1); Colein, Fabrizio (2); Mardle, Nic (1); Martin, Sebastian (1) 1: European Space Agency, Germany; 2: Serco Services GmbH, Germany\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Mission Control System (MCS) in use to operate the CryoSat-2 satellite from the European Operation Centre (ESOC) since launch (April 2010) is based on the ESOC develop Spacecraft-Operations-System release 4 (SCOS 2000 or S2K).\n\nThis software was initially designed to run on a SUN-Solaris platform and in particular on a Solaris-8 Operating System.

Two areas in particular: the progressive loss of expertise specific to the CryoSat-2 MCS and the rapidly decreasing availability of hardware replacements, on stock and on the market, as well as a problematic situation with the maintenanc"
