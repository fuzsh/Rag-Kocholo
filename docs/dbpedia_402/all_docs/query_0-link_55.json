        "text": "The study of the Mongol Empire has made enormous strides in the past two decades, and its most notable impact is the shift of seeing the Empire not only in national or regional terms but from a holistic perspective, in its full Eurasian context. This focus, credited mostly to the works of Thomas T. Allsen, also means that the scholarly literature now gives more space to topics that interest world historians such as the cultural, economic, religious and artistic exchanges that prevailed in Mongol Eurasia, or the legacy that the Mongol Empire left for the early modern empires. Simultaneously, the Mongols' image begins to shift from the barbarian warriors obsessed with massacres and plunder, to the Mongols as active promoters of cross-cultural connections, who even brought about the transition from the medieval to the modern world. The paper reviews the major trends in the study of the Empire from world history perspective and argues that the nomadic civilization of the Mongols should be taken into account in world history surveys.\n\nSince their thunderous arrival on the doorstep of Europe in the thirteenth century, the Mongol Empire has fascinated both students and historians alike as the exception to so many rules in world history. How did a nomadic, famously religiously-tolerant, primarily de-centralized people forge the single largest contiguous land empire in all of world history? In his most recent work, The Mongol Empire, Timothy May answers these questions as well as a multitude of others regarding the political, social and at times military history of the Mongol civilization. May is the Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Letters at the University of North Georgia, and a professor of Central Eurasian history, who specializes on the Mongol Empire. The current editor of Mongolian Studies: The Journal of the Mongolia Society and a prolific author of seven books and over 30 articles on the Mongol civilization, Mayâ€™s expertise on the history, traditions, and people of the steppe is on full display once again in this book.\n\nDrawing upon research carried out in several different languages and across a variety of disciplines, The Mongol World documents how Mongol rule shaped the trajectory of Eurasian history from Central Europe to the Korean Peninsula, from the thirteenth century to the fifteenth century. Contributing authors consider how intercontinental environmental, economic, and intellectual trends affected the Empire as a whole and, where appropriate, situate regional political, social, and religious shifts within the context of the broader Mongol Empire. Issues pertaining to the Mongols and their role within the societies that they conquered therefore take precedence over the historical narratives of those societies. Alongside the formation, conquests, administration, and political structure of the Mongol Empire, the second section examines archaeology and art history, family and royal households, science and exploration, and religion, which provides greater insight into the social history of the Empire-an aspect often neglected by traditional dynastic and political histories. With 58 chapters written by both senior and early-career scholars, the volume is an essential resource for all students and scholars who study the Mongol Empire from its origins to its disintegration and legacy."
