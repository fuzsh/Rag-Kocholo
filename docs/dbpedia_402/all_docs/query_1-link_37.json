However, measurements are scarce because of the remoteness. We present a robust and portable device to fill this gap. Test campaigns have demonstrated its utility in a range of environments during winter and summer. The measured temperatures show a great variability within and across locations.

We use a physically based model and field measurements to study the interactions between forests, permanently frozen ground and the atmosphere. We find that forests exert a strong control on the thermal state of permafrost through changing snow cover dynamics and altering the surface energy balance, through absorbing most of the incoming solar radiation and suppressing below-canopy turbulent fluxes.\n\nA synthesis dataset of permafrost-affected soil thermal conditions for Alaska, USA\n\nKang Wang, Elchin Jafarov, Irina Overeem, Vladimir Romanovsky, Kevin Schaefer, Gary Clow, Frank Urban, William Cable, Mark Piper, Christopher Schwalm, Tingjun Zhang, Alexander Kholodov, Pamela Sousanes, Michael Loso, and Kenneth Hill\n\nEarth Syst.

To better understand the changes, we need a comprehensive dataset across various sites. We synthesize permafrost-related data in the state of Alaska. It should be a valuable permafrost dataset that is worth maintaining in the future. On a wider level, it also provides a prototype of basic data collection and management for permafrost regions in general.\n\nThe new database of the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P)\n\nB.

It describes the operability of the Data Management System and the data quality. By applying statistics on GTN-P metadata, we analyze the spatial sample representation of permafrost monitoring sites. Comparison with environmental variables and climate projection data enable identification of potential future research locations.\n\nBrief communication: Testing a portable Bullard-type temperature lance confirms highly spatially heterogeneous sediment temperatures under shallow bodies of water in the Arctic\n\nFrederieke Miesner, William Lambert Cable, Pier Paul Overduin, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2603–2611, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe temperature in the sediment below Arctic lakes determines the stability of the permafrost and microbial activity.

Vegetation type, soil moisture and redox conditions, weathering and hydrologic transport, and mineral solubility were all found to be the primary drivers of the existing spatial variability of some soil pore water solutes.\n\nConsequences of permafrost degradation for Arctic infrastructure â bridging the model gap between regional and engineering scales\n\nThomas Schneider von Deimling, Hanna Lee, Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen, Sebastian Westermann, Vladimir Romanovsky, Scott Lamoureux, Donald A. Walker, Sarah Chadburn, Erin Trochim, Lei Cai, Jan Nitzbon, Stephan Jacobi, and Moritz Langer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2451–2471, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2451-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2451-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate warming puts infrastructure built on permafrost at risk of failure. There is a growing need for appropriate model-based risk assessments. Here we present a modelling study and show an exemplary case of how a gravel road in a cold permafrost environment in Alaska might suffer from degrading permafrost under a scenario of intense climate warming. We use this case study to discuss the broader-scale applicability of our model for simulating future Arctic infrastructure failure.\n\nVariability of the surface energy balance in permafrost-underlain boreal forest\n\nSimone Maria Stuenzi, Julia Boike, William Cable, Ulrike Herzschuh, Stefan Kruse, Luidmila A. Pestryakova, Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Sebastian Westermann, Evgenii S. Zakharov, and Moritz Langer\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 343–365, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-343-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-343-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoreal forests in eastern Siberia are an essential component of global climate patterns. We use a physically based model and field measurements to study the interactions between forests, permanently frozen ground and the atmosphere. We find that forests exert a strong control on the thermal state of permafrost through changing snow cover dynamics and altering the surface energy balance, through absorbing most of the incoming solar radiation and suppressing below-canopy turbulent fluxes.\n\nA distributed temperature profiling method for assessing spatial variability in ground temperatures in a discontinuous permafrost region of Alaska\n\nEmmanuel LÃ©ger, Baptiste Dafflon, Yves Robert, Craig Ulrich, John E. Peterson, SÃ©bastien C. Biraud, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, and Susan S. Hubbard\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2853–2867, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2853-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2853-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a new strategy called distributed temperature profiling (DTP) for improving the estimation of soil thermal properties through the use of an unprecedented number of laterally and vertically distributed temperature measurements. We tested a DTP system prototype by moving it sequentially across a discontinuous permafrost environment. The DTP enabled high-resolution identification of near-surface permafrost location and covariability with topography, vegetation, and soil properties.\n\nA synthesis dataset of permafrost-affected soil thermal conditions for Alaska, USA\n\nKang Wang, Elchin Jafarov, Irina Overeem, Vladimir Romanovsky, Kevin Schaefer, Gary Clow, Frank Urban, William Cable, Mark Piper, Christopher Schwalm, Tingjun Zhang, Alexander Kholodov, Pamela Sousanes, Michael Loso, and Kenneth Hill\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 2311–2328, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-2311-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-2311-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGround thermal and moisture data are important indicators of the rapid permafrost changes in the Arctic. To better understand the changes, we need a comprehensive dataset across various sites. We synthesize permafrost-related data in the state of Alaska. It should be a valuable permafrost dataset that is worth maintaining in the future. On a wider level, it also provides a prototype of basic data collection and management for permafrost regions in general.\n\nDetecting the permafrost carbon feedback: talik formation and increased cold-season respiration as precursors to sink-to-source transitions\n\nNicholas C. Parazoo, Charles D. Koven, David M. Lawrence, Vladimir Romanovsky, and Charles E. Miller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 123–144, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon models suggest the permafrost carbon feedback (soil carbon emissions from permafrost thaw) acts as a slow, unobservable leak. We investigate if permafrost temperature provides an observable signal to detect feedbacks. We find a slow carbon feedback in warm sub-Arctic permafrost soils, but potentially rapid feedback in cold Arctic permafrost. This is surprising since the cold permafrost region is dominated by tundra and underlain by deep, cold permafrost thought impervious to such changes.\n\nImpacts of microtopographic snow redistribution and lateral subsurface processes on hydrologic and thermal states in an Arctic polygonal ground ecosystem: a case study using ELM-3D v1.0\n\nGautam Bisht, William J. Riley, Haruko M. Wainwright, Baptiste Dafflon, Fengming Yuan, and Vladimir E. Romanovsky\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 61–76, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-61-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-61-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe land model integrated into the Energy Exascale Earth System Model was extended to include snow redistribution (SR) and lateral subsurface hydrologic and thermal processes. Simulation results at a polygonal tundra site near Barrow, Alaska, showed that inclusion of SR resulted in a better agreement with observations. Excluding lateral subsurface processes had a small impact on mean states but caused a large overestimation of spatial variability in soil moisture and temperature.\n\nPresence of rapidly degrading permafrost plateaus in south-central Alaska\n\nBenjamin M. Jones, Carson A. Baughman, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, Andrew D. Parsekian, Esther L. Babcock, Eva Stephani, Miriam C. Jones, Guido Grosse, and Edward E. Berg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2673–2692, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2673-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2673-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combined field data collection with remote sensing data to document the presence and rapid degradation of permafrost in south-central Alaska during 1950–present. Ground temperature measurements confirmed permafrost presence in the region, but remotely sensed images showed that permafrost plateau extent decreased by 60â¯% since 1950. Better understanding these vulnerable permafrost deposits is important for predicting future permafrost extent across all permafrost regions that are warming.\n\nModeling the spatiotemporal variability in subsurface thermal regimes across a low-relief polygonal tundra landscape\n\nJitendra Kumar, Nathan Collier, Gautam Bisht, Richard T. Mills, Peter E. Thornton, Colleen M. Iversen, and Vladimir Romanovsky\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2241–2274, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2241-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2241-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrotopography of the low-gradient polygonal tundra plays a critical role in these ecosystem; however, patterns and drivers are poorly understood. A modeling-based approach was developed in this study to characterize and represent the permafrost soils in the model and simulate the thermal dynamics using a mechanistic high-resolution model. Results shows the ability of the model to simulate the patterns and variability of thermal regimes and improve our understanding of polygonal tundra.\n\nEffect of soil property uncertainties on permafrost thaw projections: a calibration-constrained analysis\n\nD.

Permafrost thaw projections are simulated using a thermal hydrology model forced by a worst-case carbon emission scenario. The uncertainties associated with active layer depth, saturation state, thermal regime, and thaw duration are quantified and compared with the effects of climate model uncertainty on permafrost thaw projections.\n\nThe new database of the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P)\n\nB.

It describes the operability of the Data Management System and the data quality. By applying statistics on GTN-P metadata, we analyze the spatial sample representation of permafrost monitoring sites. Comparison with environmental variables and climate projection data enable identification of potential future research locations.\n\nUsing field observations to inform thermal hydrology models of permafrost dynamics with ATS (v0.83)\n\nA.

Improved understanding of polygonal tundra thermal hydrology processes, of thermal conduction, surface and subsurface saturation and snowpack dynamics is gained by using measured field data to calibrate and refine model structure. The refined model is then used identify future data needs and observational studies.\n\nPermafrost soils and carbon cycling\n\nC. L. Ping, J. D. Jastrow, M. T. Jorgenson, G. J. Michaelson, and Y. L.

This review highlights permafrost characteristics, the influence of cryogenic processes on soil formation, organic carbon accumulation and distribution in permafrost soils, the vulnerability of this carbon upon permafrost thaw, and the role of permafrost soils in a changing climate.\n\nA new data set for estimating organic carbon storage to 3 m depth in soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region\n\nG.

Limbrock, Christin Hilbich, Clemens Moser, Andreas Kemna, Elisabetta Drigo, Umberto Morra di Cella, and Christian Hauck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3383–3414, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3383-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3383-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we apply an electrical method in a high-mountain permafrost terrain in the Italian Alps, where long-term borehole temperature data are available for validation. In particular, we investigate the frequency dependence of the electrical properties for seasonal and annual variations along a 3-year monitoring period. We demonstrate that our method is capable of resolving temporal changes in the thermal state and the ice / water ratio associated with seasonal freeze–thaw processes.\n\nSpatially distributed snow depth, bulk density, and snow water equivalent from ground-based and airborne sensor integration at Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA\n\nTate G.

We combined high-spatial-resolution snow depth information with ground-based radar measurements to solve for snow density. Extrapolated density estimates over our study area resolved detailed patterns that agree with the known interactions of snow with wind, terrain, and vegetation and were utilized in the calculation of SWE.\n\nAssessing the key concerns in snow storage: a case study for China\n\nXing Wang, Feiteng Wang, Jiawen Ren, Dahe Qin, and Huilin Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3017–3031, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3017-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3017-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work addresses snow storage at sports facilities in China. The snow pile at Big Air Shougang (BAS) lost 158.6 m3 snow (6.7 %) during pre-competition and Winter Olympic competition days in winter 2022. There were no significant variations in the snow quality of the snow piles at BAS and the National Biathlon Center except for in the upper part of the snow piles. The 0.7 and 0.4 m thick cover layers protected half the snow height over the summer at Beijing and Chongli, respectively.\n\nSea ice melt pond bathymetry reconstructed from aerial photographs using photogrammetry: a new method applied to MOSAiC data\n\nNiels Fuchs, Luisa von Albedyll, Gerit Birnbaum, Felix Linhardt, Natascha Oppelt, and Christian Haas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2991–3015, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2991-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2991-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMelt ponds are key components of the Arctic sea ice system, yet methods to derive comprehensive pond depth data are missing. We present a shallow-water bathymetry retrieval to derive this elementary pond property at high spatial resolution from aerial images. The retrieval method is presented in a user-friendly way to facilitate replication. Furthermore, we provide pond properties on the MOSAiC expedition floe, giving insights into the three-dimensional pond evolution before and after drainage.\n\nObservations and modeling of areal surface albedo and surface types in the Arctic\n\nEvelyn JÃ¤kel, Sebastian Becker, Tim R.

We found a seasonally dependent bias between measured and modeled surface albedo for cloudless and cloudy situations. The strongest effects of the albedo model bias on the net irradiance were most apparent in the presence of optically thin clouds.\n\nIce plate deformation and cracking revealed by an in situ-distributed acoustic sensing array\n\nJun Xie, Xiangfang Zeng, Chao Liang, Sidao Ni, Risheng Chu, Feng Bao, Rongbing Lin, Benxin Chi, and Hao Lv\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 837–847, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-837-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-837-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeismology can help study the mechanism of disintegration of floating ice plates. We conduct a seismic experiment on a frozen lake using a distributed acoustic sensing array. Icequakes and low-frequency events are detected with an artificial intelligence method. Our study demonstrates the merit of distributed acoustic sensing array in illuminating the internal failure process and properties of the ice shelf, which eventually contributes to the understanding and prediction of ice shelf collapse.\n\nBrief communication: Alternation of thaw zones and deep permafrost in the cold climate conditions of the East Siberian Mountains, Suntar-Khayata Range\n\nRobert Sysolyatin, Sergei Serikov, Anatoly Kirillin, Andrey Litovko, and Maxim Sivtsev\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4601–4608, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4601-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4601-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost conditions of the East Siberian Mountains are poorly known because of the severe climate, extreme terrain, and farness and scarcity of data. The ground temperature regime plays a key role in mountainous regions, influencing the environment, slope stability, geomorphological processes and hydrological processes. We present the results of recent examinations of the permafrost thickness variations, temperature regime of thaw zones (taliks) and permafrost of the Suntar-Khayata Range.\n\nMonitoring glacier calving using underwater sound\n\nJarosÅaw TÄgowski, Oskar Glowacki, MichaÅ CiepÅy, MaÅgorzata BÅaszczyk, Jacek Jania, Mateusz Moskalik, Philippe Blondel, and Grant B.

Understanding their dynamics and developing models for their attrition has become a matter of global concern. Long-term monitoring of glacier frontal ablation is very difficult. Here we show for the first time that calving fluxes can be estimated from the underwater sounds made by icebergs impacting the sea surface. This development has important application to understanding the response of glaciers to warming oceans.\n\nBrief communication: Measuring and modelling the ice thickness of the Grigoriev ice cap (Kyrgyzstan) and comparison with global datasets\n\nLander Van Tricht, ChloÃ« Marie Paice, Oleg Rybak, and Philippe Huybrechts\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4315–4323, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4315-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4315-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed a field campaign to measure the ice thickness of the Grigoriev ice cap (Central Asia). We interpolated the ice thickness data to obtain an ice thickness distribution representing the state of the ice cap in 2021, with a total volume of ca. 0.4 km3. We then compared our results with global ice thickness datasets composed without our local measurements. The main takeaway is that these datasets do not perform well enough yet for ice caps such as the Grigoriev ice cap.\n\nA field study on ice melting and breakup in a boreal lake, PÃ¤Ã¤jÃ¤rvi, in Finland\n\nYaodan Zhang, Marta Fregona, John Loehr, Joonatan Ala-KÃ¶nni, Shuang Song, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, and Zhijun Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2045–2058, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2045-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2045-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are few detailed studies during the ice decay period, primarily because in situ observations during decay stages face enormous challenges due to safety issues. In the present work, ice monitoring was based on foot, hydrocopter, and boat to get a full time series of the evolution of ice structure and geochemical properties. We argue that the rapid changes in physical and geochemical properties of ice have an important influence on regional climate and the ecological environment under ice.\n\nBrief communication: Combining borehole temperature, borehole piezometer and cross-borehole electrical resistivity tomography measurements to investigate seasonal changes in ice-rich mountain permafrost\n\nMarcia Phillips, Chasper Buchli, Samuel Weber, Jacopo Boaga, Mirko Pavoni, and Alexander Bast\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 753–760, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-753-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-753-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new combination of temperature, water pressure and cross-borehole electrical resistivity data is used to investigate ice/water contents in an ice-rich rock glacier. The landform is close to 0Â°C and has locally heterogeneous characteristics, ice/water contents and temperatures. The techniques presented continuously monitor temporal and spatial phase changes to a depth of 12 m and provide the basis for a better understanding of accelerating rock glacier movements and future water availability.\n\nGeophysical measurements of the southernmost microglacier in Europe suggest permafrost occurrence in the Pirin Mountains (Bulgaria)\n\nGergana Georgieva, Christian Tzankov, and Atanas Kisyov\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4847–4863, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4847-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4847-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe southernmost microglacier in Europe is Snezhnika in the Pirin Mountains, Bulgaria. We use geophysical methods to investigate its thickness and the subsurface structure beneath it. While its size has been well monitored for more than 20 years, information about its thickness is poor. Our results show the presence of ice-rich permafrost near Snezhnika, which was observed in 3 consecutive years. Our results provide important information on the extent and the state of permafrost in Bulgaria.\n\nThickness of multi-year sea ice on the northern Canadian polar shelf: a second look after 40 years\n\nHumfrey Melling\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3181–3197, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3181-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3181-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Canadian polar shelf has the worldâs thickest old sea ice. Its islands impede ice drift to warmer seas. The first year of data from up-looking sonar viewing this shelfâs ice reveal that thick (> 3 m) old ice remains plentiful here, in contrast to its growing scarcity elsewhere. Arctic circulation continues to pack ice against the islands and during storms to create by ridging the very thick ice found here. This study reveals the importance of ridging to the mass balance of Arctic sea ice.\n\nSpectral induced polarization imaging to investigate an ice-rich mountain permafrost site in Switzerland\n\nTheresa Maierhofer, Christian Hauck, Christin Hilbich, Andreas Kemna, and AdriÃ¡n Flores-Orozco\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1903–1925, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1903-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1903-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe extend the application of electrical methods to characterize alpine permafrost using the so-called induced polarization (IP) effect associated with the storage of charges at the interface between liquid and solid phases. We investigate different field protocols to enhance data quality and conclude that with appropriate measurement and processing procedures, the characteristic dependence of the IP response of frozen rocks improves the assessment of thermal state and ice content in permafrost.\n\nContrasting geophysical signatures of a relict and an intact Andean rock glacier\n\nGiulia de Pasquale, RÃ©mi Valois, Nicole Schaffer, and Shelley MacDonell\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1579–1596, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1579-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1579-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe presented a geophysical study of one intact and one relict rock glacier in semi-arid Chile. The interpretation of the collected data through different methods identifies geophysical signature differences between the two rock glaciers and characterizes their subsurface structure and composition. This is of great importance because of rock glaciers' relevant role in freshwater production, transfer and storage, especially in this area of increasing human pressure and high rainfall variability.\n\nRapid and accurate polarimetric radar measurements of ice crystal fabric orientation at the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core site\n\nTun Jan Young, Carlos MartÃ­n, Poul Christoffersen, Dustin M. Schroeder, Slawek M. Tulaczyk, and Eliza J. Dawson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 4117–4133, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4117-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4117-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIf the molecules that make up ice are oriented in specific ways, the ice becomes softer and enhances flow. We use radar to measure the orientation of ice molecules in the top 1400 m of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide. Our results match those from an ice core extracted 10 years ago and conclude that the ice flow has not changed direction for the last 6700 years. Our methods are straightforward and accurate and can be applied in places across ice sheets unsuitable for ice coring.\n\nGround-penetrating radar imaging reveals glacier's drainage network in 3D\n\nGregory Church, Andreas Bauder, Melchior Grab, and Hansruedi Maurer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3975–3988, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3975-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3975-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this field study, we acquired a 3D radar survey over an active drainage network that transported meltwater through a Swiss glacier. We successfully imaged both englacial and subglacial pathways and were able to confirm long-standing glacier hydrology theory regarding meltwater pathways. The direction of these meltwater pathways directly impacts the glacier's velocity, and therefore more insightful field observations are needed in order to improve our understanding of this complex system.\n\nEvaluating a prediction system for snow management\n\nPirmin Philipp Ebner, Franziska Koch, Valentina Premier, Carlo Marin, Florian Hanzer, Carlo Maria Carmagnola, Hugues FranÃ§ois, Daniel GÃ¼nther, Fabiano Monti, Olivier Hargoaa, Ulrich Strasser, Samuel Morin, and Michael Lehning\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3949–3973, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3949-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3949-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA service to enable real-time optimization of grooming and snow-making at ski resorts was developed and evaluated using both GNSS-measured snow depth and spaceborne snow maps derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2. The correlation to the ground observation data was high. Potential sources for the overestimation of the snow depth by the simulations are mainly the impact of snow redistribution by skiers, compensation of uneven terrain, or spontaneous local adaptions of the snow management.\n\nA portable lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box for ice and snow analysis\n\nHelle Astrid KjÃ¦r, Lisa Lolk Hauge, Marius Simonsen, Zurine Yoldi, Iben Koldtoft, Maria HÃ¶rhold, Johannes Freitag, Sepp Kipfstuhl, Anders Svensson, and Paul Vallelonga\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3719–3730, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3719-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3719-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce core analyses are often done in home laboratories after costly transport of samples from the field. This limits the amount of sample that can be analysed. Here, we present the first truly field-portable continuous flow analysis (CFA) system for the analysis of impurities in snow, firn and ice cores while still in the field: the lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box. LISA is demonstrated in Greenland to reconstruct accumulation, conductivity and peroxide in snow cores.\n\nDownhole distributed acoustic seismic profiling at Skytrain Ice Rise, West Antarctica\n\nAlex M. Brisbourne, Michael Kendall, Sofia-Katerina Kufner, Thomas S. Hudson, and Andrew M. Smith\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3443–3458, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3443-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3443-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow ice sheets flowed in the past is written into the structure and texture of the ice sheet itself. Measuring this structure and properties of the ice can help us understand the recent behaviour of the ice sheets. We use a relatively new technique, not previously attempted in Antarctica, to measure the seismic vibrations of a fibre optic cable down a borehole. We demonstrate the potential of this technique to unravel past ice flow and see hints of these complex signals from the ice flow itself.\n\nImplications of surface flooding on airborne estimates of snow depth on sea ice\n\nAnja RÃ¶sel, Sinead Louise Farrell, Vishnu Nandan, Jaqueline Richter-Menge, Gunnar Spreen, Dmitry V. Divine, Adam Steer, Jean-Charles Gallet, and Sebastian Gerland\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2819–2833, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2819-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2819-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent observations in the Arctic suggest a significant shift towards a snowâice regime caused by deep snow on thin sea ice which may result in a flooding of the snowpack. These conditions cause the brine wicking and saturation of the basal snow layers which lead to a subsequent underestimation of snow depth from snow radar mesurements. As a consequence the calculated sea ice thickness will be biased towards higher values.\n\nDeciphering the evolution of the Bleis Marscha rock glacier (Val d'Err, eastern Switzerland) with cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating, aerial image correlation, and finite element modeling\n\nDominik Amschwand, Susan Ivy-Ochs, Marcel Frehner, Olivia Steinemann, Marcus Christl, and Christof Vockenhuber\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2057–2081, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2057-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2057-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe reconstruct the Holocene history of the Bleis Marscha rock glacier (eastern Swiss Alps) by determining the surface residence time of boulders via their exposure to cosmic rays. We find that this stack of lobes formed in three phases over the last ~9000 years, controlled by the regional climate. This work adds to our understanding of how these permafrost landforms reacted in the past to climate oscillations and helps to put the current behavior of rock glaciers in a long-term perspective.\n\nFirst investigation of perennial ice in Winter Wonderland Cave, Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA\n\nJeffrey S. Munroe\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 863–881, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-863-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-863-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigated a cave in Utah (USA) that contains a deposit of perennial ice. Such ice caves are important sources of information about past climate and are currently threatened by rising temperatures. The origin (precipitation), thickness (3 m), and age (several centuries) of the ice were constrained by a variety of methods. Liquid water recently entered the cave for the first time in many years, suggesting a destabilization of the cave environment.\n\nA low-cost method for monitoring snow characteristics at remote field sites\n\nRosamond J. Tutton and Robert G. Way\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1–15, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow cover is critical to everyday life for people around the globe. Regular measurements of snow cover usually occur only in larger communities because snow monitoring equipment is costly. In this study, we developed a new low-cost method for estimating snow depth and tested it continuously for 1 year at six remote field locations in coastal Labrador, Canada. Field testing suggests that this new method provides a promising option for researchers in need of a low-cost snow measurement system.\n\nSoil respiration of alpine meadow is controlled by freezeâthaw processes of active layer in the permafrost region of the QinghaiâTibet Plateau\n\nJunfeng Wang, Qingbai Wu, Ziqiang Yuan, and Hojeong Kang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2835–2848, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe active layer, a buffer between permafrost and the atmosphere, is more sensitive and responds more quickly to climate change. How the freeze–thaw action at different stages regulates carbon emissions is still unclear. We conducted 2-year continuous in situ measurements in an alpine meadow permafrost ecosystem in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and found the freeze–thaw process modified the Rs dynamics differently in different stages. Results suggest great changes in freeze–thaw process patterns.\n\nThe RHOSSA campaign: multi-resolution monitoring of the seasonal evolution of the structure and mechanical stability of an alpine snowpack\n\nNeige Calonne, Bettina Richter, Henning LÃ¶we, Cecilia Cetti, Judith ter Schure, Alec Van Herwijnen, Charles Fierz, Matthias Jaggi, and Martin Schneebeli\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1829–1848, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1829-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1829-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring winter 2015–2016, the standard program to monitor the structure and stability of the snowpack at Weissflujoch, Swiss Alps, was complemented by additional measurements to compare between various traditional and newly developed techniques. Snow micro-penetrometer measurements allowed monitoring of the evolution of the snowpack's internal structure at a daily resolution throughout the winter. We show the potential of such high-resolution data for detailed evaluations of snowpack models.\n\nOn the Green's function emergence from interferometry of seismic wave fields generated in high-melt glaciers: implications for passive imaging and monitoring\n\nAmandine Sergeant, MaÅgorzata Chmiel, Fabian Lindner, Fabian Walter, Philippe Roux, Julien Chaput, Florent Gimbert, and AurÃ©lien Mordret\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1139–1171, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1139-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1139-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores the capacity to apply ambient noise interferometry to passive seismic recordings in glaciers. Green's function between two seismometers represents the impulse response of the elastic medium. It can be approximated from cross-correlation of random seismic wave fields. For glaciers, its recovery is notoriously difficult due to weak ice seismic scattering. We propose three methods to bridge the gap and show the potential for passive seismic imaging and monitoring of glaciers.\n\nGlacier algae accelerate melt rates on the south-western Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nJoseph M. Cook, Andrew J. Tedstone, Christopher Williamson, Jenine McCutcheon, Andrew J. Hodson, Archana Dayal, McKenzie Skiles, Stefan Hofer, Robert Bryant, Owen McAree, Andrew McGonigle, Jonathan Ryan, Alexandre M. Anesio, Tristram D. L. Irvine-Fynn, Alun Hubbard, Edward Hanna, Mark Flanner, Sathish Mayanna, Liane G. Benning, Dirk van As, Marian Yallop, James B. McQuaid, Thomas Gribbin, and Martyn Tranter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 309–330, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-309-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-309-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMelting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a major source of uncertainty for sea level rise projections. Ice-darkening due to the growth of algae has been recognized as a potential accelerator of melting. This paper measures and models the algae-driven ice melting and maps the algae over the ice sheet for the first time. We estimate that as much as 13 % total runoff from the south-western GrIS can be attributed to these algae, showing that they must be included in future mass balance models.\n\nRevisiting Austfonna, Svalbard, with potential field methods â a new characterization of the bed topography and its physical properties\n\nMarie-AndrÃ©e Dumais and Marco BrÃ¶nner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 183–197, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-183-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-183-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe subglacial bed of Austfonna is investigated using potential field methods. Airborne gravity data provide a new bed topography, improving on the traditional ground-penetrating radar measurements. Combined with airborne magnetic data, a 2-D forward model reveals the heterogeneity of the subsurface lithology and the physical properties of the bed. Our approach also assesses the presence of softer bed, carbonates and magmatic intrusions under Austfonna, which contribute to subglacial processes.\n\nMeasurement of specific surface area of fresh solid precipitation particles in heavy snowfall regions of Japan\n\nSatoru Yamaguchi, Masaaki Ishizaka, Hiroki Motoyoshi, Sent Nakai, Vincent Vionnet, Teruo Aoki, Katsuya Yamashita, Akihiro Hashimoto, and Akihiro Hachikubo\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2713–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe specific surface area (SSA) of solid precipitation particles (PPs) includes detailed information of PP. This work is based on field measurement of SSA of PPs in Nagaoka, the city with the heaviest snowfall in Japan. The values of SSA strongly depend on wind speed (WS) and wet-bulb temperature (Tw) on the ground. An equation to empirically estimate the SSA of fresh PPs with WS and Tw was established and the equation successfully reproduced the fluctuation of SSA in Nagaoka.\n\nThe evolution of snow bedforms in the Colorado Front Range and the processes that shape them\n\nKelly Kochanski, Robert S. Anderson, and Gregory E. Tucker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1267–1281, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1267-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1267-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWind-blown snow does not lie flat. It forms dunes, ripples, and anvil-shaped sastrugi. These features ornament much of the snow on Earth and change the snow's effects on polar climates, but they have rarely been studied. We spent three winters watching snow move through the Colorado Front Range and present our findings here, including the first time-lapse videos of snow dune and sastrugi growth.\n\nSupraglacial debris thickness variability: impact on ablation and relation to terrain properties\n\nLindsey I. Nicholson, Michael McCarthy, Hamish D. Pritchard, and Ian Willis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3719–3734, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3719-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3719-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGround-penetrating radar of supraglacial debris thickness is used to study local thickness variability. Freshly emergent debris cover appears to have higher skewness and kurtosis than more mature debris covers. Accounting for debris thickness variability in ablation models can result in markedly different ice ablation than is calculated using the mean debris thickness. Slope stability modelling reveals likely locations for locally thin debris with high ablation.\n\nPore morphology of polar firn around closure revealed by X-ray tomography\n\nAlexis Burr, ClÃ©ment Ballot, Pierre Lhuissier, Patricia Martinerie, Christophe L. Martin, and Armelle Philip\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2481–2500, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2481-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2481-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThree-dimensional imaging of the pore network of polar firn from Antarctica was realized in order to relate the morphological evolution of pores with their progressive closure with depth. Evaluating the closed porosity was found to be very dependent on the size of samples and image reconstructions. A connectivity index, which is a parameter less dependent on such issues, was proposed and proved to accurately predict the close-off depths and densities of two polar sites.\n\nEstimating the snow water equivalent on a glacierized high elevation site (Forni Glacier, Italy)\n\nAntonella Senese, Maurizio Maugeri, Eraldo Meraldi, Gian Pietro Verza, Roberto Sergio Azzoni, Chiara Compostella, and Guglielmina Diolaiuti\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1293–1306, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1293-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present and compare 11 years of snow data measured by an automatic weather station and corroborated by data from field campaigns on the Forni Glacier in Italy. The methodology we present is interesting for remote locations such as glaciers or high alpine regions, as it makes it possible to estimate the total snow water equivalent (SWE) using a relatively inexpensive, low-power, low-maintenance, and reliable instrument such as the sonic ranger.\n\nSnowmobile impacts on snowpack physical and mechanical properties\n\nSteven R. Fassnacht, Jared T. Heath, Niah B. H. Venable, and Kelly J. Elder\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1121–1135, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1121-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1121-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted a series of experiments to determine how snowpack properties change with varying snowmobile traffic. Experiments were initiated at a shallow (30 cm) and deep (120 cm) snow depth at two locations. Except for initiation at 120 cm, snowmobiles significantly changed the density, hardness, ram resistance, and basal layer crystal size. Temperature was not changed. A density change model was developed and tested. The results inform management of lands with snowmobile traffic.\n\nIn situ nuclear magnetic resonance response of permafrost and active layer soil in boreal and tundra ecosystems\n\nM. Andy Kass, Trevor P. Irons, Burke J. Minsley, Neal J. Pastick, Dana R. N. Brown, and Bruce K. Wylie\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2943–2955, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2943-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2943-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeophysical methods have wide applications to permafrost studies. We show that borehole nuclear magnetic resonance is a valuable geophysical tool to rapidly characterize the liquid water content and unfrozen pore space in warm permafrost through simulation and field study. This technique is also sensitive to the ice nucleation process in situ. This method, which is applicable in a variety of soil types, can be used for single observations or for time-lapse monitoring of permafrost changes.\n\nClimate change threatens archaeologically significant ice patches: insights into their age, internal structure, mass balance and climate sensitivity\n\nRune Strand ÃdegÃ¥rd, Atle Nesje, Ketil Isaksen, Liss Marie Andreassen, Trond Eiken, Margit Schwikowski, and Chiara Uglietti\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 17–32, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-17-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-17-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite numerous spectacular archaeological discoveries worldwide related to melting ice, governing processes related to ice patch development are still largely unexplored. We present new results from Jotunheimen in central southern Norway showing that the Juvfonne ice patch has existed continuously since ca. 7600 cal years BP. This is the oldest dating of ice in mainland Norway. Moss mats along the margin of Juvfonne in 2014 were covered by the expanding ice patch about 2000 years ago.\n\nDrifting snow measurements on the Greenland Ice Sheet and their application for model evaluation\n\nJ.
