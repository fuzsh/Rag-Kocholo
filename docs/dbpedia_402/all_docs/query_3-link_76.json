        "meta_description": "Abstract. The Arctic marine climate system is changing rapidly, which is seen in the warming of the\nocean and atmosphere, decline of sea ice cover, increase in river discharge,\nacidification of the ocean, and changes in marine ecosystems. Socio-economic\nactivities in the coastal and marine Arctic are simultaneously changing. This\ncalls for the establishment of a marine Arctic component of the Pan-Eurasian\nExperiment (MA-PEEX). There is a need for more in situ observations on the\nmarine atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, but increasing the amount of such\nobservations is a pronounced technological and logistical challenge. The\nSMEAR (Station for Measuring EcosystemâAtmosphere Relations) concept can be\napplied in coastal and archipelago stations, but in the Arctic Ocean it will\nprobably be more cost-effective to further develop a strongly distributed\nmarine observation network based on autonomous buoys, moorings, autonomous\nunderwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These have to\nbe supported by research vessel and aircraft campaigns, as well as various\ncoastal observations, including community-based ones. Major manned drifting\nstations may occasionally be comparable to terrestrial SMEAR flagship\nstations. To best utilize the observations, atmosphereâocean reanalyses need\nto be further developed. To well integrate MA-PEEX with the existing\nterrestrialâatmospheric PEEX, focus is needed on the river discharge and\nassociated fluxes, coastal processes, and atmospheric transports in\nand out of the marine Arctic. More observations and research are also needed\non the specific socio-economic challenges and opportunities in the marine and\ncoastal Arctic, and on their interaction with changes in the climate and\nenvironmental system.

        "text": "Numerous processes are acting in the marine Arctic climate system: in the ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere. Many of these processes act on a subgrid scale, and they accordingly need to be parameterized in Earth system models and operational NWP, ocean, and sea ice models (Vihma et al., 2014). However, there is also a strong need to better understand synoptic- and hemispherical-scale processes (Zhang et al., 2004; Overland et al., 2016), which, among others, link the marine and terrestrial Arctic. Process understanding is hampered by the sparsity of observations from the marine Arctic. This is related to the high cost of observations, difficult accessibility to the measurement sites, and the harsh environment for instruments. Below we first introduce some of the most important multidisciplinary observation systems in the marine Arctic (Sect.Â 2.1). Then we describe the key processes in the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, as well as the observations available to understand and quantify them (Sect.Â 2.2 to 2.5).\n\n2.1 Multidisciplinary observation platforms\n\nMultidisciplinary observations of the coupled atmosphereâsea-iceâocean system are mostly based on coastal stations, drifting ice stations, and research cruises. The primary coastal stations in the MA-PEEX domain include the Villum Station Nord in Greenland, Ny-Ã lesund and Barentsburg in Svalbard, Cape Baranova at the coast of the Kara Sea, and Tiksi at the coast of the Laptev Sea. Providing long time series of key climate variables at fixed locations, these stations are cornerstones of the coastal Arctic observation system. The coastal station data have been applied in numerous studies addressing the Arctic atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, described in Sect.Â 2.2 to 2.5.\n\nDownload\n\nConsidering the central Arctic Ocean, drifting ice stations have played a major role in the history of observations. The first in the series of the Soviet Union âNorth Poleâ stations was operated in 1937â1938, followed by 30 stations during 1950â1991. In this century, Russia has continued to perform the comprehensive monitoring of the natural environment of the central Arctic and studies of the physical processes that determine its state. These studies are especially important in terms of improving climate models. To obtain the new data about the above-mentioned processes, complex hydrometeorological observations had been organized at the drifting stations North PoleÂ 32 to North PoleÂ 40 in 2003â2014 (Fig.Â 3). The most important western drifting stations have been the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) in 1997â1998 (Uttal et al., 2002), the Tara expedition during the International Polar Year in 2007â2008 (Gascard et al., 2008), and the Norwegian N-ICE expedition in the European marginal ice zone in winter 2015 (Granskog et al., 2016). The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) will be the next major international experiment in 2019â2020, where the focus is studies of Arctic climate and ecosystem processes (http://www.mosaicobservatory.org/, last access: 4 February 2019). Drifting stations provide unique possibilities to study the ocean, sea ice, snow, and atmosphere in the central Arctic.\n\nAnalogously to drifting ice stations, research vessels collect multidisciplinary observations from the marine Arctic. These are, however, restricted to monthly timescales and biased towards summertime. Important cruises in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic have been carried out above all by Russian; Norwegian; German; Swedish; and, more recently, Chinese and Japanese research vessels.\n\nDownload\n\nRegular observations on the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean are also collected by drifting buoys deployed above all by the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP). The present (November 2018) distribution of buoys is shown in Fig.Â 4. The buoy observations on sea-level pressure are important to detect the synoptic-scale pressure field, which is needed for initialization of NWP models (Inoue et al., 2013, 2015), atmospheric forcing for ocean and sea ice models, and for climatological and meteorological research. The buoy network is, however, often too sparse in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean (as in Fig.Â 4). Various buoy applications are described more specifically in Sect.Â 2.3 and 2.4, as well as in AppendixÂ A.\n\n2.2 Marine atmosphere\n\nThe most important atmospheric processes over the marine Arctic can be divided into the following categories: (a)Â atmospheric boundary layer turbulence and exchange processes at the airâice and airâwater interfaces, (b)Â aerosol and cloud physics, (c)Â synoptic-scale cyclones and polar lows, (d)Â orographically and thermodynamically driven processes over coastal regions, (e)Â circumpolar heat and moisture budgets, (f)Â stratosphereâtroposphere coupling, (g)Â local- and large-scale processes affecting air quality, and (h)Â Arcticâmid-latitude linkages affecting weather and climate. In addition to process studies, there is need for climate-scale monitoring of key variables, which requires long-term observations taken at coastal stations or numerous consecutive drifting ice stations and buoys.\n\nSmall-scale processes over the sea, such as (a)Â and (b)Â above, can be best studied on the basis of observations from drifting ice stations (Sect.Â 3.1), research cruises, and research aircraft, but the spatial and temporal coverage of the data available is limited. Good temporal coverage over recent years is achieved at coastal observatories, which gather plenty of valuable data on small-scale atmospheric processes over the coastal zone of the Arctic Ocean, including cloud and aerosol physics, radiative transfer, and atmosphereâsurface exchange processes (Makshtas and Sokolov, 2014; Uttal et al., 2016; Grachev et al., 2018). Atmospheric observations taken at drifting stations and research cruises have been crucial to better understand small-scale processes related to the vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere (Serreze et al., 1992; Palo et al., 2017), surface fluxes (Jordan et al., 1999; Persson et al., 2002; Andreas et al., 2010a,Â b), cloud physics (TjernstrÃ¶m et al., 2012; Shupe et al., 2013; Sedlar and Shupe, 2014), and aerosols (TjernstrÃ¶m et al., 2014). Coastal radiosonde sounding observations have been applied in studies of meteorological processes over the ocean (Maistrova et al., 2003; Tetzlaff et al., 2013). Research aircraft observations have been an important source of information on airâice momentum flux and aerodynamic surface roughness (LÃ¼pkes et al., 2013); atmospheric boundary layer physics, in particular the evolution of stable boundary layer during on-ice flows (BrÃ¼mmer and Thiemann, 2001; Tisler et al., 2008) and the growth of convective boundary layer during off-ice flows (Chechin and LÃ¼pkes, 2017); and mesoscale processes, such as low-level jet formation, during flows parallel to the ice margin (Guest et al., 2018). Moreover, aircraft observations have been applied to study the radiative and microphysical properties of the Arctic clouds (Ehrlich et al., 2008; SchÃ¤fer et al., 2015), the optical characteristics of the sea ice surface (Tschudi et al., 2001), and surfaceâatmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases as well as latent and sensible heat (Kohnert et al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2018).\n\nMeso- and synoptic-scale processes, such as (c)Â and (d)Â above, can be studied on the basis of distributed observations but, due to their sparsity, in most cases observations have to be supplemented by model and/or reanalysis products. Among others, coastal mesoscale processes, such as wind channelling, katabatic and barrier winds, tip jets, and gap flows, have been studied on the basis of high-resolution model products and observations (Reeve and Kolstad, 2011; Moore et al., 2016). Presently most studies on Arctic cyclones are based on model and/or reanalysis products (Sepp and Jaagus, 2011; Rinke et al., 2017), and this is the case also for large-scale processes, such as (e)Â to (h)Â above. Model and/or reanalysis products are available in a regular grid and are therefore much more convenient to analyse than irregularly spaced observations. There is, however, a strong need for observations to evaluate the model and/or reanalysis products (Condron et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2013).\n\nA common problem for research on all processes (a)Â to (h)Â is the limited amount of in situ data on the vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere. Satellite remote sensing on the vertical profiles of air temperature and humidity provides an attractive source of information. However, the vertical resolution of satellite remote sensing products is too coarse to study small-scale processes and the role of the atmospheric boundary layer in larger-scale processes, and problems remain in remote sensing of cloud water and ice contents over sea ice. In situ observations on vertical profiles are needed for more accuracy and better resolution. In the marine Arctic out of the coastal zone, radiosonde soundings up to the altitudes of 15â30âkm and tethersonde soundings up to 1â2âkm are restricted to research cruises (LÃ¼pkes et al., 2010; Brooks et al., 2017) and manned ice stations (TjernstrÃ¶m and Graversen, 2009; Vihma et al., 2008; Jakobson et al., 2013). In addition, lidars, sodars, cloud radars, and scanning microwave radiometers have been used to observe the vertical profiles of wind, temperature, humidity, cloud properties, and aerosols, but such data are restricted to a few campaigns (TjernstrÃ¶m et al., 2012; Mielke et al., 2014).\n\nIn situ observations in the marine Arctic include several technical and environmental challenges, such as riming of instruments, darkness of the polar night, instability of sea ice as a measurement field (leads may open within the field, causing danger for instruments and people), tilting of weather masts due to sea ice motions, low clouds and fog hampering airborne (research aircraft; unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs; and tethered balloon) operations, polar bears' interest towards the measurement devices, and disturbance of the airflow caused by ships and other constructions on ice stations (largest in conditions of stably stratified boundary layer typical of the Arctic). Despite these challenges, there is a strong need for more in situ observations to better understand and quantify atmospheric processes and their interactions in the marine Arctic.\n\n2.3 Sea ice\n\nThere are several dynamic and thermodynamic processes that need to be better understood to sufficiently quantify the state and change in the Arctic sea ice cover. Considering sea ice thermodynamics, the key processes are (a)Â sea ice formation and growth, including snow accumulation on top of sea ice and formation of granular ice types; and (b)Â sea ice and snowmelt, including processes affecting ice and snow albedo, aerosol deposition on snow and ice, and evolution of melt ponds. Possibilities to observe the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of sea ice, snow, and melt ponds in the Arctic Ocean have recently improved due to better satellite remote sensing methods (Spreen and Kern, 2017), airborne electromagnetic mapping methods (Haas et al., 2009), sea ice mass-balance buoys (Perovich et al., 2014), and community-based observations (Eicken et al., 2014; example at https://arctic-aok.org/, last access: 4 February 2019). In remote sensing, challenges still remain, among others, in distinguishing between melt ponds and leads under cloudy skies, as well as between surface snow and clouds. Layers of granular ice, formed due to refreezing of flooded or partly melted snowpack, on top of columnar ice may be detected using mass-balance buoy data supported by thermodynamic modelling (Cheng et al., 2014). Such layers may become more common due to thinning sea ice and increasing precipitation, favouring heavier snow load on top of thin ice, which increases the occurrence of flooding (Borodkin et al., 2016; Granskog et al., 2017). Under present conditions of decreased ice concentration and thickness, the influence of the ocean heat on the ice cover is increasing, providing positive feedback on a seasonal timescale (Ivanov et al., 2016). This effect is particularly important for the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean, where inflowing warm waters facilitate an upward heat flux towards the ice base. This has occurred in recent winters in the Nansen Basin, reducing sea ice formation (Polyakov et al., 2017). However, there is also a negative feedback that plays a role in winter, because thinner ice grows faster (Petty et al., 2018).\n\nObservational data on ice concentration and extent are satisfactory since the advent of passive microwave satellite remote sensing data in 1978 with a daily temporal resolution. Information on the evolution of ice thickness is, however, less accurate, with the data consisting of submarine observations from several decades before year 2000 and satellite remote sensing data during the last two decades. Passive and active microwave instruments provide information on multiyear ice coverage, which can be used as a proxy for ice thickness (Comiso, 2012). Since about 2004, more accurate information is available from satellite altimeters applying lidars and radars at a resolution of about 25âkm (Kwok et al., 2009). From the point of view of the atmospheric response to changes in sea ice cover, the most important sea ice variables are ice concentration and fraction of thin (less than 0.5âm) ice. Passive microwave L-band data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite have shown a unique capability to measure thicknesses of thin ice less than 0.5âm (Kalescke et al., 2012). Ice concentration is particularly important in conditions of a compact ice cover (>90â% ice concentration) in winter (LÃ¼pkes et al., 2008). Also the flaw polynyas along the Russian shelf in winter are important. They open and close repeatedly during the winter, depending on wind direction and speed, and causing new ice formation during opening and ice rafting and ridging during closing (Dmitrenko et al., 2001).\n\nInformation on different ice types, floe size distribution, leads, and the snowpack on top of sea ice is collected during research cruises, ice stations, and aircraft campaigns, as well as by satellite remote sensing methods. Considering exchange processes at the airâsnow, airâice, snowâice, and iceâwater interfaces, such as surface and basal fluxes of momentum, heat, freshwater, CO2, and CH4, direct observations are very limited, mostly restricted to specific field campaigns based on manned ice stations. However, data collected with sea ice mass-balance buoys allow possibilities for indirect estimation of the heat exchange at airâsnow/ice and iceâwater interfaces (Lei et al., 2018). The surface albedo is critical for the snow and sea ice mass balance during the melt season. It can be observed via remote sensing methods (RiihelÃ¤ et al., 2013), but in situ observations are needed to develop better model parameterizations for the dependence of albedo on physical properties of snow, ice, and melt ponds (Perovich and Polashenski, 2012). Further, better observations are needed on light penetration through snow and ice, which is important for the ecosystems in and below the ice (Kauko et al., 2017).\n\nConsidering atmospheric and oceanic forcing on sea ice dynamics, the best source of process-level information is simultaneous observations on the vectors of wind, ocean current, and sea ice drift (LeppÃ¤ranta, 2011). In lieu of such data, sea ice drift observations, based on buoys or satellite remote sensing, combined with reanalysis products for the wind and ocean currents yield valuable information at least on regional scales (Spreen et al., 2011; Vihma et al., 2012). Small-scale processes of sea ice dynamics, including deformation, rafting, ridging, and breaking of ice flows, are more difficult to observe, but advances have been made using ice-station observations on the internal stress of the ice field (Weiss et al., 2007) as well as seismometer (Marsan et al., 2012) and ice radar observations (Karvonen, 2016). Radar observations are good for detection of leads and ice ridges in areas where high-resolution (<10âm) synthetic aperture radar images are obtained. To cover larger areas, satellite remote sensing observations are needed, but challenges remain in the detection of ice ridges. Large-scale evolution of the ice field results from a combination of thermodynamic and dynamic forcing, with storms representing extreme cases of the latter (Itkin et al., 2017). Quantification of their relative contributions is still a challenge. This is partly related to the inaccuracy of sea ice thickness data. Also, the thermodynamic- and dynamic-forcing factors may often support each other, for example when strong winds advect warm, moist air masses to the over-sea ice, simultaneously generating melt and ice advection away from the study region (Alexeev et al., 2017).\n\nIn further development of sea ice observations, MA-PEEX should give a high priority to sea ice thickness and snow cover on top of sea ice, which are of a high climatological importance, as well as to sea ice drift and ridges, whose occurrence and properties are important for navigation.\n\n2.4 Ocean physics\n\nUnderstanding the ocean heat and freshwater budgets is important for understanding the entire Arctic climate system and ecosystems, in particular their inter-annual and decadal variations. Most physical, chemical, and biological processes in the Arctic Ocean are influenced by the quantity and geochemical quality of freshwater. However, the uncertainties in the heat and freshwater budgets of the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas are not well quantified (Carmack et al., 2016). Different studies have yielded different results, but it is challenging to distinguish between differences originating from the lack and uncertainty of observations and those originating from temporal variations on inter-annual and decadal scales.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean stratification is characterized by a stably stratified low-salinity surface layer, which results from positive net precipitation and freshwater inflow from the Arctic rivers, Greenland ice sheet, and the Pacific through the Bering Strait (Rudels, 2012). The thickness of the surface layer is limited by a strong halocline underneath and varies on seasonal-to-decadal timescales and across the basin. The freshwater stored in the Arctic Ocean surface layer is either accumulated in the Beaufort Gyre or transported out of the basin via the Fram Strait and, in smaller amounts, via the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Warm and saline Atlantic water flows into the Arctic Ocean mainly through the Fram Strait in the West Spitsbergen Current and St.Â Anna Trough. Formation of different water masses, characterized by combinations of temperature and salinity, in various parts of the Arctic Ocean takes place via heat loss to the atmosphere and freshening via precipitation and mixing with meltwater and riverine water (Ivanov and Aksenov, 2013; Rudels et al., 2014). Tides and wind waves in the Arctic Ocean are important for the climate, coastal erosion, and navigation. Tides contribute to the mixing of water masses, further affecting sea ice melt (Luneva et al., 2015) and the thermohaline circulation with potential impacts on the Arctic and global climate (Holloway and Proshutinsky, 2007). Other small-scale processes important for climate include the exchange of momentum, heat, and salt at the iceâocean interface, brine formation (Bourgain and Gascard, 2011), diapycnal mixing (Rainville et al., 2011), double diffusive convection (Sirevaag and Fer, 2012), and (sub-)mesoscale eddies and fronts (Timmermans et al., 2012).\n\nDownload\n\nMultidisciplinary in situ data in the Arctic Ocean are collected mainly during icebreaker expeditions, aircraft surveys, and manned drifting platforms. However, these activities are irregular in time, very expensive, biased to the summer season, and hence poorly suited for providing regular long-term monitoring data. Moorings have been deployed at key locations in the gateways and rims of the Arctic Ocean (Fig.Â 5), but they mainly deliver physical parameters from fixed depths in a delayed mode (Beszczynska-MÃ¶ller et al., 2011). Nevertheless, observations have allowed the documentation of Atlantic water warm pulses in this century (Polyakov et al., 2011) and the revelation of the strong seasonal cycle in the intermediate Atlantic water layer deep below the ocean surface, which was not directly measured before (Ivanov et al., 2009; Dmitrenko et al., 2009). The sea surface temperature (SST) field over the open ocean is fairly accurately known during the satellite era. Decadal and inter-annual changes in wind wave fields in the Barents and White seas in the period 1979â2010 have been estimated on the basis of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis and numerical models. Information on the wave statistics and validation techniques applied is provided by Medvedeva et al.Â (2015), Myslenkov et al.Â (2015, 2017), and Korablina et al.Â (2016). The maximum of significant wave height reaches 15â16âm in the Barents Sea and 4â5âm in the White Sea. Model experiments for storm surges in the Barents and White seas have shown that most of the highest surges are formed after a passage of a polar low (Korablina et al., 2016). The Onega Bay in the White Sea and the Haipudyr Bay in the Barents Sea were found as areas of the most frequent formation of surges over the last decades.\n\nConsidering spatial differences, the availability of oceanographic data is comparatively good in the Barents Sea, Bering Sea, and Greenland and Norwegian Sea, whereas there are far fewer data from the less accessible central and eastern parts of the Arctic Ocean and Russian shelves. Extended spatial coverage of the upper Arctic Ocean observations is provided by the ice-tethered profilers (ITPs), which allow high-resolution profiling in the uppermost 800â1000âm layer and straightforward transmittance of data via satellite.\n\nTo understand the hydrography of the Arctic Ocean, it is important to have good observations of the river discharge. In the Eurasian Arctic, the number of monitoring stations for river discharge reached its maximum during the 1980s, when about 74â% of the total non-glaciated pan-Arctic was monitored (Shiklomanov and Shiklomanov, 2003). Later, there was significant decline in gauges in Russia mostly due to population decreases in high-altitude areas, loss of qualified personnel, and insufficient financial support (see Sect.Â 4). The total pan-Arctic area monitored decreased by 67â% from 1986 through 1999, and in Russia the decrease was 79â% (Shiklomanov et al., 2002). More recently, the situation has been improved by the Arctic-RIMS (Rapid Integrated Monitoring System, http://rims.unh.edu, last access: 4Â FebruaryÂ 2019), which allows the characterization of water budgets across the pan-Arctic drainage region. In addition, the historical archives of the Global Runoff Data Centre and R-ArcticNET (A Regional, Electronic Hydrometeorological Data Network for the pan-Arctic Region) allow monitoring of changes in the hydrological cycle.\n\nAs a summary, process understanding and quantification of the state and changes in the Arctic Ocean circulation, heat and freshwater budgets, and small- and mesoscale processes are limited by the insufficient amount of observations. A specific challenge for in situ observations of the ocean is that only a part of the data are available in real time, whereas a lot of data can only be gathered when the instruments are recovered from the ocean.\n\n2.5 Ocean chemistry and ecosystems\n\nWith increasing CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere, the capacity of the world oceans to uptake CO2 continues to decrease as the reaction of CO2 dissolution gradually tends to saturation. Under such conditions, the planetary greenhouse effect is enhanced. In turn, the ensuing surface ocean temperature growth leads to a shift in dissociated calcite, CaCO3, to its solid phase (Chen and Tang, 2012). Thus, the actual balance between dissociated and suspended phases of CO2 becomes an issue of paramount importance (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). Shifts in the exchange of CO2 between the aquatic medium and the boundary layer above are highly consequential also in terms of the acidification of seas. In combination with the co-occurring external forcings, both processes are conducive to a variety of alterations in marine hydrobiological processes. Among the latter are the formation of nutrients uptakable by phytoplankton, rates of intracellular metabolism, primary production, and reshufflings in phytoplankton species composition and abundance (Bates and Mathis, 2009).\n\nDownload\n\nBecause of immense sizes (up to millions of square kilometres) of E.Â huxleyi bloom areas (Fig.Â 6) and their active spatio-temporal dynamics, only satellite observations are capable of providing adequate information on this phenomenon and its consequences. Due to recently developed methodologies and image processing algorithms, space-borne means are highly efficient in quantification of many parameters characterizing the features and properties of E.Â huxleyi blooms, such as the (i)Â bloom area, (ii)Â duration of blooming (exact dates of bloom outburst and disappearance), (iii)Â content of the alga-produced inorganic carbon within the bloom, (iv)Â increase in partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) with regard to its background values, and (v)Â increase in CO2 content in the atmospheric column over the bloom. For such purposes Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) satellite data yield reliable information, from which quantification of the above parameters (iâiv)Â is feasible, whereas Orbiting Carbon ObservatoryÂ 2 data are better for quantification of parameters (v). Satellite OC-CCI data permit the retrieval of the time series of parameters (i)â(iv) since 1998 for all marine environments where the phenomenon occurs. Moreover, the employment of data from various other optical and microwave satellite sensors permits the enrichment of the data on parameters (i)â(v)Â with supplementary data on a number factors that can condition the development of the phenomenon, such as water surface temperature, water salinity, near-surface wind speed and direction, ice edge and ice-free area, cloud fraction, and downward solar radiation in the PAR spectral range. This allows us to reveal the major bloom-forcing environmental factors and prioritize them and, with the application of climate models, to predict the phenomenon dynamics in the forthcoming several decades (Kondrik et al., 2017, 2018a,Â b,Â c).\n\nNitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and silicon are indispensable in primary production processes. Organic carbon is the principal forage for heterotrophic bacteria. Thus, the balance in input of the above substances controls the net carbon dioxide content in marine ecosystems. Allochthonous dissolved organic matter (ADOM) is also highly important in establishing the status quo of the light regime in such waters. The input and spread of the above elements are ultimately important for the marine ecosystem workings not only within the outfall of the major Eurasian rivers and adjacent shelf zones but across the entire Arctic Ocean.\n\nObservations on the surface fluxes, carbonate system, other biogeochemical variables, and food chain are mostly restricted to scientific cruises and sparse coastal observations. However, bio-optical sensor suites are developed for ITPs for ecosystem monitoring (Laney et al., 2014). In moorings, biogeochemical sensors are still very limited; only in the Fram Strait, the key region for ArcticâAtlantic exchanges, a multidisciplinary moored observatory has been implemented for long-term ecosystem monitoring (Soltwedel et al., 2005).\n\n2.6 Linkages between the marine Arctic and Eurasian continent\n\nThe linkages between the marine Arctic and Eurasian continent can be broadly divided into three groups: (a)Â large-scale atmospheric transports and teleconnections, (b)Â river discharge, and (c)Â atmospheric and oceanic mesoscale processes in the coastal zone. Considering (a), there is continuous atmospheric transport of heat, moisture (Dufour et al., 2016), pollutants (Bourgeois and Bey, 2011; Law et al., 2015), and other aerosols (Ancellet et al., 2014; Popovicheva et al., 2017) between the Eurasian continent and the marine Arctic. Most of the transport is carried out by planetary waves and transient cyclones, but also the mean meridional circulation, related to the polar cell, contributes to the transports. Planetary waves include both propagating and quasi-persistent features in the atmospheric pressure field, such as the Siberian high-pressure pattern (Tubi and Dayan, 2013). Heat and moisture are transported both northwards and southwards, but the net transport across latitudes 60 and 70ââN is northwards over most of Eurasia. However, southward net moisture transport occurs in summer in the belt between 40 and 140ââE (Naakka et al., 2019). In addition to transports, planetary wave patterns generate teleconnections from the marine Arctic to the Eurasian continent, as far as southern China (Uotila et al., 2014). Due to the Arctic amplification of climate warming, individual cold-air outbreaks from the central Arctic to mid-latitudes have become less cold on the circumpolar scale (Screen, 2014). However, several studies suggest that Arctic changes, in particular the sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara seas, favour a more frequent occurrence of winter cold-air outbreaks in central and eastern Eurasia (Mori et al., 2014; Kug et al., 2015; Jaiser et al., 2016; Vihma, 2017). The sea ice loss from the Arctic Ocean has also resulted in increased evaporation from the Arctic Ocean (Boisvert and Stroeve, 2015), and some studies suggest that this has caused increased snowfall in Siberia (Cohen et al., 2014).\n\nConsidering the coastal and archipelago zone of northern Eurasia, the atmospheric processes include coastal effects on the wind field, which are driven or steered by orographic and thermal effects (Moore, 2013). A remarkable change during recent decades is the intensification of the summertime frontal zone along the Siberian coast (Crawford and Serreze, 2016). In summer the terrestrial Arctic has warmed much faster than the marine Arctic (Fig.Â 1), increasing the northâsouth temperature gradient. However, the Arctic coastal frontal zone is not a region of cyclogenesis, but favours intensification of cyclones formed over Eurasia (Crawford and Serreze, 2016).\n\nVia river discharge, freshwater, and dissolved and particulate matter are transported from the Eurasian continent to the Arctic Ocean. River discharge impacts the sea ice and ocean, including the water quality (Sonke et al., 2018), water column light climate (Pozdnyakov et al., 2007; Carmack et al., 2016), storm surges (Wicks and Atkinson, 2017), and coastal erosion (Overduin et al., 2014). The degradation of permafrost has recently led to increased runoff, erosion, and associated transport of total suspended matter and nutrients and refractory organic carbon release, which has a significant impact on both regional and global carbon and biochemical cycles (Shakhova et al., 2007). The interaction of these processes in the changing climate system is complex, but we expect to see that increasing primary production and water turbidity will result in heat accumulation in the upper layers of the coastal ocean, the strengthening of the thermal the stability, and the shallowing of the thermocline. This will also cause some increase in alkalinity and buffering against CO2-driven ocean acidification (Lenton and Watson, 2000). Considering sediment and water quality components, only approximately 10â% of the catchment area is monitored. The main datasets are based on regional studies recently performed in the Lena (HÃ¶lemann et al., 2005), Ob (Shakhova et al., 2007), and Amur rivers (Levshina, 2008; Chudaeva et al., 2011) and summarized in reviews (Savenko, 2006; Bagard et al., 2011; Pokrovsky et al., 2015). The existing datasets underestimate the fluxes of particulate heavy metals from the Siberian rivers to the Arctic Ocean due to sampling infrequency and uncertainties in sampling procedures (Chalov et al., 2018). To improve estimates of fluvial export, multiyear chemical datasets from a coordinated sampling programme have been collected since 2003 under the ArcticGRO programme at the six largest Arctic rivers (Holmes et al., 2012; McClelland et al., 2016). Since 2018 under the PEEX umbrella, the ArcticFLUX project has provided estimates of dissolved and particulate organic matter, nutrients, and metals fluxes based on unprecedented dense river cross-section samples at the outlets of the four largest Siberian rivers (Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and the Kolyma) multiple times per year (Fig.Â 7).\n\nDownload\n\nCoastal erosion processes in the Arctic Ocean lead inter alia to inundation of the terrestrial coastal zone, which is due to the wind-driven breaking of the fast ice and exposure of the coast to marine wave action (Sect.Â 2.4), destruction of coastal forefront soil, and formation of a sloping bank. As a result, extensive areas of terrestrial permafrost become submarine permafrost. Because of ensuing warming, submarine permafrost starts thawing. The bottom thermal conditions thus change, and the processes of release of CO2, methane, and other volatile substances from thawing submarine permafrost start developing on very large scales (Overduin et al., 2016). Despite the importance of this process, we have limited knowledge on submarine permafrost distribution, its thermal state, and rates of greenhouse gas liberation and transport up into the atmosphere (Ping et al., 2011). Karlsson et al.Â (2016) suggest that terrestrial matter dominates in both the water column and surface sediment of Arctic rivers compared to marine matter released from the sea floor.\n\nAs a summary, the present observation network is sufficient to detect synoptic-scale processes in the atmosphere, but improvement is needed to detect coastal mesoscale features and to better quantify the magnitudes, vertical profiles, and trajectories of atmospheric transports. Considering river discharge, due to the dominating role of largest rivers, only 12 hydrologic gauges are sufficient to capture 91â% of the total monitored area and 85â% of the total monitored discharge. However, for a detailed description of the state of Arctic land surface hydrology and its effects on the ocean, it is necessary to record the discharge also from much smaller sub-basins. There is also a strong need for more observations on coastal erosion and its consequences.\n\nAlexeev, V. A., Walsh, J. E., Ivanov, V. V., Semenov, V. A., and Smirnov, A.
