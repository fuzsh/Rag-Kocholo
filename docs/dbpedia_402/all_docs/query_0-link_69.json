My ﬁrst river journey in association with this work was a memorable trip down the Amazon that Bob Meade made possible. Cheng Liu helped arrange the trip upstream through the Chang Jiang’s Three Gorges. My journeys through the Murray-Darling and Ganges basins were made many years before I conceived the idea of this book, but numerous Australian and Indian colleagues helped make those travels possible. Colleagues who work on rivers were also generous in providing their time and talents to read drafts of the river chapters and help to reduce errors or omissions in the text. Bob Meade provided extensive commentary on the Amazon chapter, Klement Tockner reviewed the chapter on the Danube, Jürgen Runge reviewed the Congo chapter, and Gary Brierley reviewed the chapter on the Murray-Darling basin. Bob Meade, David Galat, and Martin Reuss thoroughly reviewed the Mississippi chapter. Andrew Goudie, Meg Lowman, three anonymous reviewers for Yale University Press, Nicole Gasparini, and an anonymous reviewer for the University of Chicago Press each provided many useful suggestions. I was unfortunately not able to visit every one of the river basins proﬁled in this book, but photographs provided by Jürgen Runge for the Congo basin and by Victor Baker and Pavel Borodavko for the Ob-Irtysh basin greatly enhanced the chapters on those rivers I could not visit. The enthusiasm shown for this book by Jean Thomson Black of Yale University Press and Christie Henry of the University of Chicago Press provided important encourvii\n\nPREFACE\n\nagement. Finally, my mother, Annette Wohl, shared my river journeys on the Mississippi and the Mackenzie and patiently and carefully read the early drafts of the river chapters and the connecting interludes. The concern that my mother and my late father felt over human alterations of the world’s ecosystems continues to shape my worldview and my life’s work.\n\nviii\n\nONE\n\nA Round River Contemplating the lace-like fabric of streams outspread over the mountains, we are reminded that everything is ﬂowing.\n\nJOHN MUIR\n\nAlong the networks of the world’s rivers lives a disproportionate richness of plants and animals, all adapted to the rivers’ yearly pulsing and occasional outbursts. Change either of the vital components—the supply of water or sediment—by altering the climate, by cutting the forests that stabilize the soil, or by damming the river, and the river itself changes in a cascading effect that inﬂuences all the rich life linked to the river corridor. We humans have been learning this fundamental yet highly complicated lesson over and over for millennia. People too often view constantly changing rivers as inconveniences. We try to stabilize them by conﬁning them in single straight channels that do not spill across the ﬂoodplain or migrate from side to side across the valley bottom. This conﬁnement diminishes the complexity and diversity of habitat that nourish abundant and varied species of plants and animals. Where rivers regularly overtop their banks, ﬂoodwaters carry sediment and nutrients that rejuvenate the wetlands and forests of the ﬂoodplain. Fish disperse from the main channel across the newly ﬂooded lands, where the warmer, shallower, slower-ﬂowing waters that nourish the growth of microbes, algae, and insects also provide food and nursery habitat for vulnerable young ﬁsh. Floodwaters receding to the main channel carry organic matter that helps supply the river’s food web. 1\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nEcologists identify this “ﬂood pulse” as one of the primary contributors to river health. In addition to spreading water, sediments, and nutrients across the valley bottom, ﬂoods can also reconﬁgure the river channel. Their greater energy enhances bank erosion, shifting channels across the ﬂoodplain and leaving depressions that become ponds or lakes, as well as secondary channels that are fully connected to the main channel only during ﬂoods. The presence of swift, deep ﬂow in the main channel, slower ﬂow in the partially connected secondary channels, and still water in the ﬂoodplain depressions creates a variety of habitats. Animals that live primarily in upland environments also spend time in these riverine corridors where resources are abundant. When dams reduce the annual ﬂood pulse and channelization eliminates the diverse habitats of the river corridor, the complexity that supports abundant life is lost. Jürg Bloesch, president of the International Association for Danube Research, refers to uniformity as the illness of rivers, not only because of lost complexity and abundance, but also because of lost function. The ﬁltering effect of riverside vegetation and ﬂoodplains is reduced or lost when the microbes inhabiting water and soil lose habitat. In consequence, the river is more likely to pass downstream any contaminants that it receives, from excess sediment and nutrients to pesticides and PCBs, rather than storing them or breaking them down into biologically less harmful compounds. Contaminants passed downstream reduce water quality along the length of the river and into the coastal environment. The physical buffering provided by rivers is also lost to increasing uniformity. Rather than spreading across broad ﬂoodplains and moving slowly downstream, ﬂoodwaters remain concentrated in the main channel and create destructively large and fast-moving ﬂoods that are more likely to damage structures and communities near the river. This book explores how the changes humans impose can impoverish the rivers, and by extension impoverish all the many creatures that rely on them. To illustrate the nature of rivers, I have chosen ten of the world’s largest. Among these the Amazon, Congo, and Mackenzie remain relatively unaffected by humans. The Ganges and Chang Jiang exemplify rivers undergoing rapid change as a result of increasing human alterations. The Ob-Irtysh, Nile, Danube, Mississippi, and MurrayDarling represent the variety of heavily altered rivers present in the world today. These ten also exemplify the climatic, topographic, and biological variety present among the world’s largest river basins.

Darker gray shading indicates basins strongly affected by ﬂow regulation as of 2005; lighter gray indicates basins moderately affected. The table at right lists rivers in the order they are discussed in this book, with drainage area in thousands of square kilometers, length of the mainstem river in kilometers, and approximate number of ﬁsh species in the drainage basin.\n\nregions drained by the Amazon and the Congo pump enormous volumes of water and sediment into the adjacent oceans, whereas the Nile and the Murray-Darling emit only a comparative trickle from their arid drainages. The Amazon drops precipitously from the heights of the Andes, then meanders broadly for more than three thousand kilometers across an immense, nearly ﬂat basin before reaching the Atlantic. The Ganges drops from the roof of the world in the Himalaya, then gradually turns and runs beyond the base of the mountains before making its way to the Bay of Bengal. The Congo traces a broad arc around its central depression before breaking through the Crystal Mountains along its lower course and tumbling down a series of cascades to the Atlantic. The Danube begins in gentle, hilly mountains, then alternates downstream between multiple channels as it ﬂows across broad basins and through a single narrow gorge punched through the mountain ranges that cross its path to the Black Sea. The Amazon supports a tremendous diversity of ﬁsh species, whereas the Mississippi is particularly rich in 3\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nspecies of mussels. Freshwater dolphins swim in the Amazon and the Ganges. What the rivers share, besides their great size, is their crucial role in shaping the surrounding landscapes and biological communities. Rivers sculpt the lowlands they ﬂow across by governing where sediment is removed through erosion and added through deposition. They also indirectly control the shape of adjacent uplands. Geologists working along the Indus River in Pakistan, for example, demonstrated that when the Indus cuts down rapidly, the neighboring valley sides become oversteep and unstable, triggering landslides that ﬁll the valley bottom with sediment and temporarily slow the rate of downcutting. Relative to the percentage of the landscape they occupy, river corridors host a disproportionately large number of plant and animal species. Rivers almost entirely dominate the transport of sediment to the oceans, with headwater regions producing most of the sediment. Biochemical processes along rivers and adjacent wetlands govern the amount of nitrogen, carbon, and other nutrients reaching coastal areas and thus strongly inﬂuence coastal and oceanic productivity. Rivers and wetlands also strongly inﬂuence groundwater storage by providing recharge zones where surface waters inﬁltrate to greater depths or by draining groundwater as channels cut downward and intersect the water table. Despite the wealth of vital services and resources supplied by the world’s rivers, human activities have impoverished most of the largest river basins. An assessment of fragmentation and ﬂow regulation by dams published in 2005 indicates that of the ten large rivers proﬁled in this book, ﬁve (Mississippi, Nile, Danube, Chang Jiang, and MurrayDarling) are strongly affected catchments in which a substantial portion of the ﬂow is regulated or the main channel and tributaries are highly fragmented by dams that effectively break the channel up into shorter segments. The remaining ﬁve rivers proﬁled here are moderately impacted catchments. Only 120 of the 292 catchments assessed for the study were judged to be unaffected as a result of fragmentation or ﬂow regulation by dams, and most of these are smaller rivers. Environmentalists sometimes quote John Muir, who wrote, “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we ﬁ nd it hitched to everything else in the Universe.” Interconnections are particularly apt for describing rivers. Precipitation, windblown sediments, and atmospheric contaminants enter them from the air. Flying insects emerge from the river, and river water evaporates. Water carrying dissolved elements and compounds percolates down through the streambed to the groundwater, 4\n\nA ROUND RIVER\n\nand groundwater seeps into river channels. Microscopic organisms and aquatic insects move back and forth between the river and the shallow subsurface, as do water and dissolved chemicals. Water, sediment, nutrients, and organisms ﬂood across valley bottoms, then recede into river channels. Sediment and organic matter move from adjacent hill slopes and uplands into river corridors. And water, sediment, contaminants, and organisms moving downstream, as well as other organisms moving upstream, stitch together the uplands and oceans along the seams of rivers. Aldo Leopold wrote of the functioning of an ecosystem as a “round river” to emphasize the cycling of nutrients and energy. This phrase could also aptly describe the planet, including the atmospheres, oceans, landmasses, and groundwater. I emphasize the importance of these global connections among seemingly individual river basins in the short “interludes” between river proﬁles. This book begins with precipitation over the headwaters of the Amazon. Following the river downstream across South America, chapter 2 ends where the Amazon enters the Atlantic. The intervening interlude traces the pathway of a hypothetical water droplet leaving the mouth of the Amazon until that droplet falls as precipitation on the headwaters of the Ob-Irtysh river system in Siberia. Each succeeding pair of chapters follows this format, tracing the path of the same water droplet down another river basin and then following it to the next one. In the interludes that trace pathways between river basins I have tried to estimate realistic rates of travel for a droplet moving with speciﬁc ocean currents and atmospheric circulation patterns. The travel times between river basins are underestimates, however, because many of the droplets moving down a river take much more circuitous pathways, with long periods of storage in groundwater, glaciers, or deep ocean currents. Polar waters take approximately a thousand years to circulate, for example, then hundreds of years more to surface at the equator, where they rise slowly from the ocean depths at only two to ﬁve meters a year. But water droplets do circulate around the entire globe, and contaminants, windblown sediment, and a wide variety of organisms, from microbes to whales, travel with them. It is this sometimes slow but always inexorable mixing that makes it ludicrous to think of any river basin in isolation. What people in the United States do in the Mississippi River basin does make a difference in the basins of the Congo, the Ob-Irtysh, and the MurrayDarling, and vice versa. We are all a part of one round river. The following chapters discuss some of the details of that river’s ebb and ﬂow using ten great rivers as pathways of learning and exploration. 5\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nMy purpose in writing this book is to explore the natural history of some of the world’s largest rivers and the history of human alterations to these river ecosystems by taking readers on a journey down each river and along the pathways that connect seemingly far distant rivers. My focus is on the science underlying our understanding of each river. Although I am fascinated by the approach of environmental historians, I do not explore the social history of people living in each river basin. The book is written to be accessible to nonspecialist readers interested in natural and environmental history, but the bibliographic sources for each chapter also provide reference material for those who wish to delve further into the topics discussed. Every river discussed here is the sole subject of several other books, as well as numerous scholarly articles. If the people of the world continue to impoverish the functioning of the greatest rivers, we cannot plead ignorance of the effects of our actions.\n\n6\n\nTWO\n\nThe Amazon: Rivers of Blushing Dolphins The Andes Mountains form a wall more than six thousand meters high in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. The mountain wall separates two of the most different regions on Earth by only eight hundred kilometers. To the west of the divide, the absence of water deﬁnes a landscape with jagged edges of rock and topography. Across the continental divide, the mountains drop abruptly into a vast green plain. Elevation drops from more than six thousand meters to approximately three hundred meters over a distance of three hundred kilometers. The plain is contoured by immense rivers that wind back and forth across it, and the abundance of water deﬁnes the landscape. Water sifts down onto the high peaks as snowﬂakes that feed glaciers and iceﬁelds, and as snowmelt in the mountain streams. The Amazon River heads in a small spring that seeps from spongy grassland high on Mount Huagra. This spring grows into a small stream called the Huarco. As other streams fed by melting snow and ice join the river, it becomes the Rio Toto, then the Rio Santiago, followed by the Rio Apurimac. (Spanish-speakers use an accent on Río.) By this point the river has dropped down into cloud forest, moist and cool, but below the frost level. The name Apurimac comes from an Indian language in which it means “Great Speaker,” for the steep Apurimac is ﬁlled with rapids and waterfalls. The downstream point where the rapids end marks the boundary between the\n\n7\n\nCHAPTER TWO 4000\n\nElevation 3000 (meters) 2000\n\nLongitudinal profile 300\n\n1000\n\nAmazon River at Obidos\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nMean monthly discharge (thousands of cubic meters per second)\n\n250\n\n3000 4000\n\nDistance from source (kilometers)\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\nAmazon drainage basin\n\nFeb\n\nAN DE S\n\nManaus\n\nIquitos\n\n.\n\nyali Uca\n\nn ano Mar\n\nLima\n\nJu\n\ni ta\n\n.\n\ns ru Pu\n\na ru Ju\n\ngu Xin\n\nntins\n\n.\n\nNegro\n\nPutumayo\n\n.\n\nJun\n\nAug\n\nOct\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN equator\n\nBelem\n\nra ei ad M\n\n10°S\n\nPACIFIC OCEAN 0\n\n70°W 2.1\n\nDec\n\nToca\n\nNa po\n\njos\n\n.\n\nApr\n\nMarajó Island\n\nTa pa\n\nQuito\n\n0\n\n60°\n\n830 km\n\n50°\n\nMap of the Amazon drainage basin in South America, showing principal tributaries and cities. The entire drainage basin is represented by the shaded area in the inset ﬁgure; the shading in the main ﬁgure represents the Andes Mountains. The ﬂooding season in different parts of the Amazon basin is indicated by gray lines (June–August) and black lines (January–May) along the river courses (after Goulding et al. 2003, The Smithsonian Atlas of the Amazon, “The Flooding Season,” 36). The hydrograph at upper right shows monthly average ﬂow at Obidos, Brazil.\n\ncrystalline rocks of the Andes and the younger sediments of the Amazon basin. The noisy Apurimac becomes the Rio Ene, then the Rio Tambo, which ﬂows into a main tributary of the Amazon, the Rio Ucayali. The Peruvians begin calling the river Amazonas at the conﬂuence of the Ucayali and the Marañon. Amazonas remains the river’s local designation until it enters Brazil, where it is known as the Rio Solimões until it reaches the conﬂuence with the Rio Negro, when it is known once more as the Rio Amazonas. (Portuguese-speaking Brazilians neither accent 8\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nnor capitalize rio.) Victorian naturalist Henry Walter Bates coined the name the Rivers Amazon in recognition of the different local names given to the great river. The plural seems particularly apt in this land of rivers. By the time the ﬂowing water reaches the Ucayali, rains are abundant. Torrential “male” rains cascade from thunderheads over the feathery stands of palm trees. Gentler “female” rains moisten the leaves of the enchanted broccoli forest where hundreds of tree species create an undulating canopy of varied shapes and sizes. Water seeps into the ground and collects in the stream channels, swelling them to rivers that overﬂow their banks and ﬂood for tens of kilometers across the surrounding lowlands, creating vast lakes and ﬂooded forests. The water’s force cannot be contained, and the rivers continually shift within their channels, eroding banks here, depositing sandbars there, jumping abruptly to a new channel. Each river sweeps back and forth in extravagant loops, doubling on itself, trailing secondary channels, chute cutoffs, and oxbow lakes in its wake. The city of Iquitos, Peru, rises abruptly within the dense forest and network of rivers, without a gradual buildup of rural areas and suburbs. Iquitos remains unconnected by the network of roads so ubiquitous elsewhere at the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Two hundred thousand people live in Iquitos, and everything they do not make themselves comes in by airplane or by boat. During the ﬂood season, water rises up the stilts of houses on the ﬂoodplain. Each year the river can rise and fall here by nine meters vertically. Many structures are built on ﬂoating rafts. People have been living in Iquitos since at least the ﬁfteenth century, but the settlement became a city with the rubber boom that brought both intense suffering and lavish prosperity to the Amazon basin early in the twentieth century. Rubber has not boomed in Iquitos in many decades, but other resources can be extracted. The city has large sawmills where the giant kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra) that rear like massive umbrellas above the surrounding canopy are peeled to make plywood. A more limited harvest now occurs following a decade of intense logging that created a scarcity of kapok trees, but recent oil discoveries suggest to some residents the promise of another resource extraction boom. Downstream from Iquitos the river alternately narrows and then widens into a broad inland sea. Birds screech loudly along the riverbanks. The turbid water resembles café au lait. The river surface holds a complicated topography of wrinkles and calms, and upwellings where 9\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nbig boils rise off submerged dunes. The water is not uniformly opaque. Particles of silt and clay churn within it like split pea soup being stirred, and the sediment forms subtle and complex honeycomb patterns in shades of brown and golden brown. The depths remain inscrutable. The river ﬂows dirty with the fecundity of life. Grasses, water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes), reeds, twigs, logs, and clumps of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) ﬂoat by like bouquets dropped on the water. Herons and egrets perch on ﬂoating islands of grass. Butterﬂies form scraps of color on the breeze. Parrots pass overhead screeching loudly, their blunt-beaked silhouettes and short wingbeats as distinctive as their harsh cries. Along the banks, the globular nests of oropendola (Psarocolius spp.) colonies hang down from bare trees. Ribereños paddle small homemade dugouts that ride low in the water. The ribereños are river people, as their name implies. Of mixed Indian and European ancestry, many of them are descended from people who migrated into the Amazon during the rubber boom and remained here after the boom ended. The ribereños live in isolated huts and small villages, supporting themselves through a mixture of ﬁshing, hunting, gathering, small-scale agriculture, and trade. The ribereños live within a landscape of impressive power, where oceans of air collide and precipitate huge quantities of water that in turn fuel the river’s vast seasonal ﬂoods. The Amazon basin lies beneath the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the great meeting point of air ﬂowing equatorward from both Northern and Southern hemispheres. As the warm, moist air masses collide the air rises upward, sending rain down from ﬁerce, mobile convective storms. The annual migrations of the ITCZ induce wet and dry seasons that are out of phase in the northern and southern sides of the Amazon basin. Flood season is January to May in the southern portion of the basin and June to August in the northern basin. Peak ﬂows from northern tributaries lag those of southern tributaries by three months because of these seasonal differences in rainfall, as well as the large volumes of water that are stored and slowly drained from the basin’s vast ﬂoodplains. All the water falling over the basin originates in evaporation from the Atlantic Ocean. The water is then continually recycled, falling as precipitation and evaporating from water bodies or transpiring from plants. More than half of the rain falling on the interior parts of the basin has fallen at least once elsewhere in the Amazon. The cycling of water among myriad pathways deﬁnes the world of the Amazon: atmospheric ﬂows of water vapor coming inland from the Atlantic; river ﬂows back to the ocean; overbank ﬂows from channels across the 10\n\n2.2\n\nAbove, Canoa along the margin of the Amazon in Peru. The immense height and mass of vegetation, as well as the huge size of the river, dwarf humans, yet ribereños conﬁdently paddle these dugouts with only a few centimeters of freeboard above river waters rushing along at more than a meter per second. Below, Ribereño house along the Amazon in Peru. The hut is roofed with palm thatch, and the house is built on stilts. The interior is simple, with cheap aluminum cooking pots and utensils, a table, and hammocks. A papaya tree may grow next to the house, and red peppers may grow in an old canoa ﬁlled with soil.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nadjacent lowlands; and ﬂows of soil moisture into plant roots, up stems, and out of leaves into the surrounding air. The quantities contained in these ﬂows dwarf those of other river basins. At Iquitos the Amazon ﬂows with two times the average discharge of the Mississippi River. Even the Amazon’s tributary Rio Negro and Rio Madeira each ﬂow at about two times the Mississippi’s volume. Unlike other large rivers that are fed primarily by snowmelt in their headwater mountains, by the time the Amazon reaches Iquitos, more than 95 percent of the ﬂow is fed by rain falling below the mountains. This tremendous volume of rainfall results in the river’s carrying approximately 15 percent of all the river water that is discharged into the world’s oceans, or a ﬂow equal to twelve Mississippi Rivers. The huge volume is the ﬁrst of the Amazon’s outstanding characteristics. The relentless forces of this water have carved and deposited a ﬂat landscape. Nothing but the tall trees lining the banks is visible from the river. In satellite imagery, the texture of the ﬂoodplain appears as intricate as the grain of wood where the river has repeatedly shifted back and forth to create secondary channels, oxbow lakes, backswamps, and long islands. Some of the islands are rimmed by natural levees, with depressions that form lakes in the center. Slight differences in surface elevation, and differing histories of deposition and erosion, equate to differences in subsurface grain size and moisture retention that in turn support different water levels throughout the period of low water and thus different plant and animal communities. The ﬂoodplain preserves a historical record of river dynamics that creates diverse habitats, but to the untrained eye the landscape beyond the river looks like an undifferentiated mass of greenery. During ﬂood stage, the Amazon may spread to a width of ﬁfty kilometers as it spills across the adjacent ﬂoodplains. Where the ﬂoodwaters are turbid with sediment, the Brazilians call the ﬂooded forest zone várzea. Where the ﬂoodwaters are clear and black, the ﬂooded forest is igapó. Together these forests make up 2 percent of the total Amazon rain forest, an area of approximately a hundred thousand square kilometers. During his 1848–52 explorations in the Amazon, English naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace adopted the local Indian practice of distinguishing whitewater, blackwater, and bluewater (which later became known as clearwater). This usage can be confusing to those in North America, where whitewater commonly refers to turbulent ﬂow over rapids. In the Amazon basin whitewater is the brown, sediment-laden water of rivers such as the tributary Rio Madeira and the Amazon itself. The 12\n\n2.3\n\nAbove, ﬂoodwaters from the Amazon backﬂooding the lower reaches of the tributary Rio Napo to form a várzea. Grama dulce extends above the water surface at right. Below, ﬂooded forest (igapó) along the Rio Jutai. This site is more than a kilometer from the main channel of the Amazon, but the water is several meters deep.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nwhitewater is relatively rich in nutrients and solutes, as well as sediment, and of a nearly neutral pH. Whitewater rivers head in the Andes and mainly occupy the western and southwestern portions of the Amazon basin. If the Andes are a wall, then Robert Frost’s line “Something there is that doesn’t love a wall” describes erosion. Glaciers, plants, wind-driven sand grains, ﬂowing water, and the daily cycle of solar heating and cooling all break down the rocks of the Andes into sediment that eventually enters the rivers of the Amazon. Most of the sediment in the whitewater rivers comes from the Andes. The mainstem Amazon drains the Peruvian Andes, and the tributary Rio Madeira carries huge loads of sediment from the Bolivian Andes. During the wet season, the turbid water of the main river mixes with clearer water coming down some of the tributaries and off the ﬂoodplain. More than 95 percent of the particulate material carried by the Amazon consists of tiny grains of silt and clay traveling suspended in the river water. The greatest amount of silt and clay movement occurs about midway through the rise of the annual ﬂood. As the turbid waters of the main channel ﬂood across the bottomlands during the wet season, the water velocity decreases and sediment settles from suspension onto the ﬂoodplain. The ﬂoodplain thus decants sediment from the river water, returning clearer water to the main channel. As the annual ﬂood recedes, the river water cuts at the exposed channel banks, returning some of the sediment to the ﬂow. When Leal Mertes studied the dynamics of sediment along the Amazon, she found that more sediment is deposited on the ﬂoodplain than moves downstream with the river water. More than 80 percent of the suspended sediment that ﬂows onto ﬂoodplains from the main channel or tributaries settles from the water and remains on the ﬂoodplain at least temporarily. Sediment eventually returns to the main channel through bank erosion. Of the approximately 1.5 billion tons of sediment eroded annually along a two thousand kilometer reach of the Amazon, more comes from bank erosion than from tributaries or from transport down the channel. Most sediment thus repeatedly cycles between the ﬂoodplain and the main channel. Although how long the sediment stays on the ﬂoodplain is unknown, it probably is on the order of many hundreds to a few thousand years, with the longest residence times at sites farthest from the main river channels. Nonstop movement of water or sediment from the Andes to the Atlantic in the main channel would take only about two months, but such direct movement probably involves only a small proportion of the sediment particles being transported. 14\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nThe Amazon is one of the few major rivers of the world where water and sediment are allowed to move through their own circuitous paths. On this great river engineers have not yet channelized and leveed the channels or regulated the ﬂow. Not a single bridge constricts the river. Ship captains navigating the river annotate their charts as they proceed because the channel is continually changing. Water and sediment still surge across the ﬂoodplains of the Amazon each wet season, driving the life cycles of plants and animals, and the waters drain slowly back into the channels each dry season. The continued existence of natural rhythms of water and sediment movement, as well as the adaptations of plants and animals to these rhythms, is the second outstanding characteristic of the Amazon. Above the level of the annual ﬂood rise the uplands of terra ﬁrme, or solid earth. Many of these uplands are the remnants of a great wedge of sediment deposited along the eastern margin of the developing Andes. With time this wedge has been dissected by rivers and worn down, and the soil of the remaining areas is now colored burnt red from iron oxides. The constant heat and high precipitation of the tropics produce rapid mineral weathering. Mobile ions such as calcium and magnesium are quickly leached from the soil downward into the groundwater or taken up by plants and animals. Microbes and other organisms rapidly decompose any twigs or leaves shed by plants, freeing the nutrients for use by all the layered plant and animal life of the rain forest. Only stable oxides of iron and aluminum remain to form a soil that quickly loses fertility once the forest and its nourishing rain of plant litter are removed. Winter provides a rest period in the temperate regions. During this rest more organic matter is added to the soil than is used by living organisms. Through centuries and millennia, dark, organic-rich layers accumulate in the upper few meters of temperate soils. There is no rest period in the tropics and no subsurface soil organic layer. Plants have shallow roots because there is no need to reach deep for nutrients. Yet from these shallow roots many trees grow exceptionally tall, developing buttress roots or stilt roots to increase stability, although there is still much treefall in the tropics.\n\nLife in the Várzea The plants and animals of the Amazon basin have adapted to the seasonal ﬂuctuations present where the whitewater rivers overﬂow their banks and spread across the adjacent forest. Várzea like that along the 15\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ntributary Rio Napo downstream from Iquitos hold a stunning diversity of life. Plants are densely layered, growing on and over and through one another in intense competition for sunlight. Although people of the temperate zones commonly regard deserts as a challenging environment for plants, the periodic superabundance of water, the limited nutrients, and the competition among individual plants in the tropical rain forests can present equally intense challenges. Woody vines hang like ﬂattened, twisted ﬁre hoses from tall trees in the várzea. Epiphytes sprout from the vines in little feathery tufts. Epiphytes, named for the Greek epi, “on top of,” grow on host plants. Epiphytes such as bromeliads and orchids take nothing from the host plant, but their weight can break the host’s limbs. Hemiepiphytes such as lianas grow on other plants but remain rooted in the ground for water and nutrients. The vines and leaves may grow ﬂat along the trunk of a host tree to avoid being eaten by caterpillars or other herbivores, then fan out wherever the plant encounters a patch of light ﬁltering through the canopy. Strangler ﬁgs start high in the canopy from a bird-deposited seed and grow downward. Some trees have evolved peeling bark as a defense against strangler ﬁgs. The sloughing bark sheds the ﬁgs like Houdini wriggling out of chains. Aechmea and Streptocalyx bromeliads bloom in bursts of red high among the branches of kapok and other tall trees along the Napo. Trees leaning out across the water host their own aerial gardens thick with mosses, fungi, and epiphytes. Tufts of feathery palm fronds erupt in the canopy. Bulbous maroon fruits hang down like half-ﬁlled water balloons from the bare branches of false kapok trees (Pseudobombax mungaba). Spiny black palms (Bactris maraja) grow along the riverbanks. More than thirty thousand species of vascular plants live in this world of intertwined greenery along the Amazon. By comparison, approximately eighteen thousand species are present in the United States. The Amazon also hosts at least thirty thousand species of fungi and an unknown quantity of mosses, lichens, and algae. Trees are the most diverse type of plant, with the greatest number of species per hectare. Studies record approximately 300 species within a one-hectare plot near Iquitos, and 186 tree species at a plot near Manaus, midway down the Amazon. Instead of the limited number of species, each represented by large numbers of individuals, that can occur in higher latitudes, the tropics typically have large numbers of species with fewer individuals of each. The off-the-chart numbers of species of plants, ﬁsh, and other organisms are the third outstanding characteristic of the Amazon basin. 16\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nA three-toed sloth hangs like a hammock high in the crook of a bare tree along the Napo. Much of the sloth’s diet here consists of leaves of the Cecropia tree, a fast-growing gap specialist common along the edge of rivers. Tiny poisonous Azteca ants protect the Cecropia by nesting in the extensive hollows of the trunk and branches among colonies of small insects that secrete a sugary substance the ants eat. The ants also obtain nutrients from special growths at the base of the leaf stalks. In return, the ants vigorously attack any animal other than a sloth that approaches the tree, thus limiting herbivory, and kill climbing plants that might otherwise strangle the Cecropia. This symbiosis between ant and plant is only one of many ingenious strategies Amazonian plants have evolved to limit herbivory. Some trees produce dense wood by incorporating silica compounds into their tissue as a protection against wood borers and termites. Other plants sprout leaves that look unappetizing because, although perfectly healthy, they are splotched with yellow as though diseased, or lacy with holes as though some other herbivore had already eaten them. Elsewhere in the várzea, ants boil up out of partly submerged logs at the slightest touch. Ant nests and termite nests form dark bulges among the tree trunks and limbs. Like other invertebrates, the termites move seasonally from nests in the soil during the dry season to nests among the tree branches during ﬂooding. Scientists have described about 150 termite species from Amazonian forests, although many other species remain undescribed. Floodplain forests have about ﬁve times fewer species than terra ﬁrme forest, but the total number of termites is approximately equal in the two environments. The turbid brown depths of the várzea, which appear inscrutable from the surface, also hold wonders. Tiny neon tetra ﬁsh (Hyphessobrycon innesi) swim among fruit-eating giants as big as a human. Plant parts plop into the water and roll downstream with the current. At least some of the plant parts will be eaten by ﬁsh, for the Amazon basin is unusual in that ﬁsh are the major dispersers of seed in the ﬂooded forest. Many of these ﬁsh have large molars and jaws specialized for cracking hard seeds. In these turbid waters the ﬁsh have evolved specializations such as electroreception and the barbels of catﬁsh to ﬁnd their way about in the darkness of a world only centimeters below the intense sunlight. Plants crowd in everywhere along the margins of the water, and thick stalks of grama dulce protrude above the water surface. This so-called ﬂoating vegetation is actually composed of many species of rooted grass, including Paspalum repens and Echinochloa polystachya, 17\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nwhich can be twelve meters long but protrude less than a meter above the water. Scientists studying Echinochloa have found that the grass uses a type of photosynthetic pathway common among plants in arid or semiarid regions but unusual in wetter areas. The high productivity of this type of photosynthesis allows the grass to keep pace as water levels in the Amazon rise approximately eight meters during each year’s ﬂood season. New shoots form at the nodes of old stems during low water levels, and these shoots root in exposed sediment. Each shoot forms a new plant when the old stems rot and die, and the stems of the new plants grow rapidly upward as rising water levels cover the sediment in late November or December. The rates of vegetative growth associated with this annual feat are among the highest values ever observed for a natural plant community. Nutrients traveling attached to ﬁne sediment in the whitewater rivers also promote this rapid growth. River waters carry dissolved nitrogen leached from the uplands down to the ﬂoodplains, where microbes and plants consume the nitrogen. The organic matter from these microbial and plant producers then fuels animal consumers in the water, river sediments, and ﬂoodplain soils. Although the ﬂoodplain composes only about 3 percent of the Amazon basin, the extremely high rates of grass productivity indicate that ﬂoodplain vegetation forms a critical part of the nutrient cycle. Scientists studying Echinochloa conservatively estimate that the grass occupies ﬁve thousand square kilometers of the basin and consumes about seventy thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. Much of this carbon is released back to the atmosphere as the stems and leaves die and decompose, and this contributes to the high ﬂuxes of carbon gases measured in the ﬂoodplains. The stands of grass also absorb large quantities of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen during the ﬂood season, slowing the ﬂow of nutrients through the river system. When the plants die and decompose during the dry season, the nutrients are released to the ﬂoodplain sediments. As long as the grass stands remain intact, nutrients within the ﬂoodplain system are conserved and enriched. When people burn the grasses during the dry season so they can plant the ﬂoodplain with short-lived food crops or use it as temporary pasture, the life cycle of Echinochloa is disrupted. After repeated burning the grass community may be lost, and with it the ability to store and recycle nutrients in the ﬂoodplain. The ﬂoating meadows formed by grama dulce can be up to a kilometer long and several hundred meters wide. The meadows support 18\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nshrubs, trees, and other plants as well as grasses, and a rich animal community lives among the plants. More than a hundred species of ﬁsh are specialized to live within the root mats of the meadows, which also provide good nursery habitat for ﬁsh and habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Among the animals living in the darkness below the plant roots are green knife ﬁsh (Eigenmannia virescens), which transmit an electrical discharge and have a modiﬁed vertebral column that transmits sound in freshwater. Ten to twenty species of electricity-generating ﬁsh can be present in a single ﬂoating meadow, creating what must be a chaos of electricity for those organisms sensitive enough to detect it. Water monkeys (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum) or silver arowana, another common name, also live beneath the ﬂoating meadows. While young, these insect-eating ﬁsh are brooded in the male’s mouth, venturing out to eat and then returning to papa’s mouth when danger threatens. This specialized care of the vulnerable young is a response to the large numbers of predators waiting hungrily in the ﬂooded forest. Insects, crustaceans, mollusks, birds, and at least a hundred species of frogs also thrive in the dense vegetation of the ﬂoating meadows. As the water level drops following the annual ﬂood season, the ﬂoating meadows move downstream like arks carrying both plants and animals, until they eventually break apart. The insect sounds forming a background to the varied birdcalls grow progressively louder as the light fades along the Rio Napo. Thousands of hidden frogs join the chorus. Of the four thousand species of amphibians known worldwide, sixteen hundred live in the Amazon. This region has the most diverse frog fauna in the world, and biologists regularly ﬁnd new species here. Frogs of the Amazon occupy every conceivable niche. They live in the water, on the forest ﬂoor, and in the trees. They eat insects, ﬁsh, other frogs, snakes, and rodents. Some species lay their eggs on branches overhanging the water so that the tadpoles can drop in when ready. Others are carried to the water by a parent or grow up in puddles within hollow bamboo stems. Poison dart frogs eat ants and use the formic acid, along with other compounds, to produce the alkaloid poisons the frogs are famous for. Francisco de Orellana was the ﬁ rst European to hear these sounds of insects and frogs along the Napo. Orellana was one of the conquistadores accompanying Gonzalo Pizarro in his conquest of the Incan empire west of the Amazon. Orellana left the main expedition in what is now eastern Ecuador and traveled down the Rio Napo to the Amazon with a smaller group in December 1541, intending to bringing provisions from downstream settlements back to the starving expedition. Neither 19\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nOrellana nor Pizarro accurately estimated the difﬁculties of traveling downstream on the Napo, let alone the impossibility, as it turned out, of returning back upstream. Amid much difﬁculty, Orellana and his men traveled the length of the great river. As they approached the conﬂuence of the Amazon and the tributary Rio Madeira, they heard stories of women warriors. The Spaniards immediately called these women “Amazons,” taking the name from an old Greek story of warrior women in ancient Scythia. The tales of the Amazon warriors held a place of particular fascination among all the stories coming out of Orellana’s adventures, and eventually Europeans came to know the main river and its entire drainage basin by this name.\n\nForest Tea Farther downstream along the Amazon, tributaries such as the Rio Ampiyacu form an igapó, or blackwater wetlands, during the wet season ﬂoods. Blackwater in the Amazon is clear and slightly to strongly acidic, more the color of strong tea: as geologist Bob Meade describes it, “tea brewed from the forest litter.” Ions of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals that are dissolved in and buffer the whitewater are absent from the blackwater, having long ago been leached from the forest soils through which this water moved as groundwater before entering a river. White beaches of quartz sand that invite swimming are prominent only along the blackwater rivers, which occur mainly in the northern part of the Amazon basin around the Rio Negro. The Amazon river basin is depauperate in mussels in part because the blackwater rivers lack enough calcium to support their shell building. Lack of calcium has also been hypothesized to explain the lack of large herbivores in the Amazon forest, where the tapir is one of the largest at 1.8 meters long. Dozens of species of birds enliven the igapó. Yellow-rumped male caciques (Cacicus cela) call loudly as they display outside their funnelshaped nests. The vivid yellows and blacks of the birds’ plumage contrast sharply with the green vegetation. Greater kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus) and lesser kiskadees (Pitangus lector) utter the characteristic calls that give them their common name. Various members of the ﬁve species of kingﬁshers dart above the water, many uttering their own volley of sound as they move. Amazonian umbrella birds (Cephalopterus ornatus) sport a distinctive feathery headpiece like a pompadour. The staccato knocking of a lineated woodpecker (Dryocopus lineatus) sounds 20\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nfrom the top of a dead tree. The highest bird diversity along the river corridor occurs at the meeting of the Andes and the Amazon. Some one thousand to ﬁfteen hundred bird species are known in the Amazon; North America has seven hundred species. The variety of birds is an index of the richness of ﬂooded forest habitat. An area of less than a hectare is used during the year by an average of 125 bird species. Most species favor one or two of the four vertical levels of the forest. When the three lower levels of ground, lower, and middle tiers are inundated during the ﬂood season, birds migrate to the upper level or to adjacent terra ﬁrme forest. Birds also migrate elsewhere during the dry season. Most of the bird species in the Amazon are migratory, and less than half are endemic species that are found only here. Part of the richness of igapó habitat stems from the abundance of fruit. Most trees of the ﬂooded forest have an intense fruiting period between the start and the peak of the annual ﬂoods. This abundance of fruit attracts monkeys and birds from adjacent upland areas and ﬁsh from the river channels. The dense veining of rivers across the basin means that only ﬁfty to a hundred kilometers separate individual patches of ﬂooded forest, aiding animal migration between patches. Although the várzea and igapó host a variety of animals, the annual outpouring of water from the river challenges plants. Water in the ﬂooded forest can reach nine meters deep, and individual sections of forest can be ﬂooded for three months to eleven months at a time. Botanists still do not fully understand how trees can survive the absence of oxygen in the root zone created by this prolonged deep ﬂooding, yet trees here can be up to forty meters tall and several hundred years old. Many trees grow mainly during periods of low water, then drop their leaves during periods of inundation. Other plants time their life cycles differently with respect to ﬂooding. Floating algae known as phytoplankton living in ﬂoodplain lakes throughout the Amazon grow rapidly after river water enters the ﬂoodplain and supplies nutrients. Most of the Amazon lakes are isolated during low water, merging into nearby ﬂowing rivers or side channels during high water. Aquatic animals that spread into the ﬂooded forest during high water migrate back into the lakes or river channels during low water, but many of the lakes do not provide good low-water habitat. The lake water is too muddy or poor in nutrients to support much phytoplankton, and low levels of dissolved oxygen can make breathing difﬁcult. Many of the ﬂoodplain lakes are stratiﬁed, with an oxygen-depleted lower layer 21\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nin which anaerobic bacteria accelerate the decomposition of organic matter. The surrounding waters of the ﬂooded forests are also low in dissolved oxygen. As plant litter and other organic materials decay in these oxygen-poor waters, they release methane. The Amazon ﬂoodplains and lakes release 5 to 10 percent of the total global methane ﬂux from wetlands during the annual inundation. In response to low levels of dissolved oxygen in the lake and ﬂoodplain waters, South American lungﬁsh, swamp eels, electric eels, catﬁsh, and pirarucu—in total at least twenty ﬁsh species—surface periodically to breathe atmospheric oxygen. Predators from piranhas and caimans to vultures and cormorants also concentrate in and around the lakes during the dry season. Along the edges of the ﬂoodplain, the mixing zone between the clear waters of the Ampiyacu and the main channel is abrupt as a fence, though churned by large vortices. Flashes of pink appear and disappear, revealing the presence of botos (Inia geoffrensis), freshwater dolphins that are pink because subcutaneous blood vessels expand with exertion, making their color more vivid. This is one of the wonders of the Amazon: pink dolphins up to 2.5 meters long and 160 kilograms in weight, often swimming upside down, clicking as they go to echolocate their prey in the murky water. And some of the prey is hard to eat: the back teeth of botos are commonly badly worn and ground down, probably by the tough coverings on the armored catﬁsh. These freshwater dolphins may be one of the species remnant from the time when the Amazon basin was a shallow ocean. The geologic provinces of the Brazil Shield and Guiana Shield, in the southern and northern portions of the Amazon, respectively, were once highlands from which rivers ﬂowed westward. As the Andes began to rise to the west about ﬁfteen million years ago, the region between the Andes and the highlands became a shallow ocean. Continuing uplift of the Andes established the present eastward drainage approximately ten million years ago, but dolphins and rays living in the shallow ocean apparently evolved to remain in the freshwaters that replaced the sea. Five of the world’s great rivers have or recently had their own species of freshwater dolphin: the Amazon, the Chang Jiang, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Mekong. The Amazon is unique in having two species; botos divide up the river habitat with smaller tucuxi (Sotalia ﬂuviatilis), gray dolphins up to 1.8 meters long. Stories about the boto are numerous. Legend has the dolphin as a male seducer of humans who comes ashore at night, and some birth certiﬁcates along the Amazon still list the father as a boto. Real botos, however, are declining in number as a result of the combined effects of 22\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\naccidental dolphin kills during commercial driftnet ﬁshing and use of dolphin parts for medicine and ceremony by people living along the lower Amazon. Dams on some of the tributaries restrict the distribution of dolphins, and pesticides washing into the rivers from agricultural ﬁelds accumulate in their tissues. Mercury moving downstream from placer gold mining in the northern Amazon also poisons the dolphins.\n\nCaboclos The Amazon enters Brazil downstream from the riverside city of Leticia, Colombia’s only port on the Amazon. This city of thirty thousand people, with its dock full of boats, jet aircraft ﬂying in, and clearings in the forest spreading up and downstream, interrupts the otherwise largely unbroken expanses of forest along the river downstream from Iquitos. Occasional clearings for small cattle ranches lie along the river below Leticia, always on the burnt red uplands of the terra ﬁrme. The name terra ﬁrme provides a nice distinction from the watery, changeable world just a few meters lower in elevation. The distribution of terra ﬁrme controls the distribution of people, for only seasonal, temporary camps exist beyond the terra ﬁrme. Although most of the cattle ranches along the main river are small, family-run operations, ranching is the biggest threat to ﬂoodplain ﬁsheries and overall biodiversity in the Amazon and is the main economic force behind destruction of primary forest. Small palisades of wooden ﬁsh traps protruding above the water along the river’s edge create a technological contrast with the motorboats docked upstream. The traps are used for subsistence ﬁshing by the ribereños, who are known as caboclos in Brazil. Technologies more advanced than those they use overshadow the life of the caboclos in many ways. The size of individual ﬁsh and the numbers of ﬁsh caught are declining with time, for example, perhaps as a result of commercial driftnet ﬁshing. Manatees have also been heavily hunted here and are now rare. Turtles and land tortoises are declining because both adults and eggs are heavily hunted. The giant Amazon river turtles in particular once laid hundreds of millions of eggs each year, but now the turtles are nearly gone. The word caboclo has many connotations, including non-Amazonian ones, but it is widely used to describe indigenous, rural inhabitants of Amazonia who are not tribal peoples. The caboclos practice small-scale, diversiﬁed agriculture, using manioc as a staple crop. Fish caught with 23\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nbow and arrow or small nets and traps form their major protein source, but the caboclos’ diet is deﬁcient in vitamins because they lack fruits and vegetables. Manioc provides a starchy staple. Like the plants and animals around them, the caboclos adjust their lives to the rivers that dominate the Amazon region. As the ﬂoodwaters recede during the dry season, the caboclos cultivate beans or corn on the newly exposed river margins. Zebu cattle and water buffalo introduced from India stand in water up to their chests as they graze on emergent vegetation. During rising and high water the caboclos remove their cattle to terra ﬁrme or keep them on rafts or elevated corrals and feed them grass. Most caboclos live along the whitewater rivers, because blackwater rivers lack the rich alluvial soil that can support crops and because fewer ﬁsh live in blackwater rivers. Although contemporary Brazilians and people living elsewhere commonly think of the Amazon basin as a huge wilderness unaltered by humans, soils across the basin record a long history of land use. Archaeologists estimate that the river corridor was already well populated\n\n2.4\n\n24\n\nFloating cowboy along the Rio Guajará during the annual ﬂood. Corrals built on platforms above the level of the yearly ﬂood appear in the background. Water buffalo introduced to areas such as this one churn up the ﬂoodplain mud and prevent some of the native plants from germinating.\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nwhen Orellana journeyed downriver in 1541; more than three million Indians lived in the Amazon basin in 1500. The indigenous peoples had altered the ecology through the use of ﬁre and selective cultivation. Some scientists hypothesize that repeated burning released sufﬁcient nutrients to the soil to create rich, dark soils known as terra preta do Indio (Indian dark earth), which are still present on the terra ﬁrme. Others have hypothesized that anthropogenic burning beginning eleven thousand years ago altered forest ecology and regional climate sufﬁciently to cause the otherwise unexplained band of lower average rainfall through the central Amazon basin. Terra preta typically occurs in small patches of a few hectares on low hills overlooking rivers, the kind of terrain favored by Indians. Together these small patches cover about 10 percent of the Amazon, an area the size of France, reﬂecting the extent and stability of human communities in the Amazon before contact with Europeans. The black soils are typically half a meter deep and full of broken ceramics. The oldest terra preta soils, in the central and lower Amazon, date back more than two thousand years. Contemporary farmers prize terra preta for its great productivity, and scientists have recently become intrigued by its existence. Fertile patches of terra preta exist under the same conditions of warm, wet climate that create adjacent red and yellow soils of low fertility. Warmth and rainfall leach nutrients and organic material from most tropical soil once it is cleared of vegetation. The terra preta, however, has more phosphorus, nitrogen, calcium, and other nutrients that are available to plants, as well as more organic matter. It retains moisture better and is not rapidly exhausted by agricultural use when managed well. Somehow, the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon were able to continue farming for centuries, creating and maintaining soil fertility in a manner that modern farmers have not been able to mimic. Traditional knowledge was lost with the massive population decline caused by diseases brought by Europeans. Only about ﬁfty thousand Indians remain in the Amazon today. Contemporary slash-and-burn farmers shift from one plot to another, newly cleared plot every two to four years. Archaeologists hypothesize that clearing the rain forest with stone tools was so difﬁcult that such rapid movement among farm plots would have been impractical in the past. Instead, the ancient farmers learned to practice slash-and-char by burning the forest only partially, creating charcoal that was then stirred into the soil. Nutrients from excrement and waste such as turtle, ﬁsh, and animal bones were added to the charcoalrich soil, and these nutrients helped to support a richer diversity and 25\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nabundance of soil microorganisms. In addition, the ancient farmers practiced a type of agroforestry, growing at least thirty species of useful trees as well as annual crops. Scientists now hope to mimic some of these ancient techniques to help Amazonian soils support crops.\n\nManaus Ranches and towns become more common along the riverbanks approaching Manaus, and swaths of the dense native vegetation are cleared for grazing lands and banana groves. The cuts of roads form reddish scars on the terra ﬁrme, and soon high-rises, jet aircraft, huge oil tankers, and smoke rising from ﬁres on the bank are visible along the river. Moving from the headwaters downstream is a progression forward in time and downward in ecosystem degradation as a result of human impacts. Manaus is a city of a million and a half people incongruously located in the middle of the jungle. The city is a major industrial and manufacturing center established with the status of an international free-trade zone in part because the Brazilian government fears losing sovereignty over the Amazon basin if the region is internationalized as a biosphere reserve. The Portuguese established Manaus in 1660, calling it São Jose do Rio Negro. The name subsequently changed to Manáos to recognize an Indian tribe that used to live here. Many of the cities along the Amazon experienced a period of growth and prosperity associated with the rubber boom, but Manaus is the preeminent boom city. People have used Amazonian rubber for as long as written records of the region exist; early European visitors describe indigenous peoples coating their feet in sticky sap, then drying the sap over a campﬁ re to create temporary waterproof footwear. The English-language name rubber comes from early use in pencil erasers, but Europeans were quick to appreciate the versatility of the substance derived from the sap of Hevea brasiliensis. More than three hundred million of these trees grow in the Amazon, mostly singly rather than in groves, and mostly south of the main river. The tree’s natural geographic distribution is restricted to the Amazon basin. The rubber boom of 1880 to 1912 represented the meeting of the Amazon and the Industrial Revolution. All of the industrial world’s rapidly growing demand for rubber came from trees in the Amazon that were tapped for latex by incising the bark. The Amazon boom ended when the British successfully cultivated rubber trees in Asia 26\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nand developed large commercial plantations. The economy of Manaus slumped when the rubber boom ended, remaining stagnant until the free-trade zone was declared in 1967. Now the city manufactures electronics, Honda motorcycles, jewelry, and watches as well as processing locally derived raw materials such as rubber and timber and reﬁning oil from Peru. Roads built during the 1970s link Manaus to Venezuela and to southern Brazil, but the city’s most important connection to the outside world remains the Amazon and, twenty-three hundred kilometers downstream, the Atlantic Ocean. The ﬁsh market in Manaus hints at the fecundity of the surrounding waters. Gleaming bodies striped and speckled with the colors of the sun-dappled ﬂooded forest lie stilled on the counters. Fish in the markets are smaller than they were in the 1970s, owing to commercial ﬁshing. Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) formerly reached more than 140 kilograms and nearly three meters long, but now such big specimens are rare. These fruit-eating ﬁsh are among the largest freshwater ﬁsh in the world. Because they breathe air, pirarucu must surface every ten to twenty minutes, which makes them vulnerable to ﬁshermen. Other species are caught en masse in driftnets.\n\nFish and the Flood Pulse In an age when a few keystrokes can call up detailed lists from electronic databases, we do not know how many ﬁsh species live in the Amazon basin. Approximately three thousand are known thus far, including about eighteen hundred endemic species that are found only here. This total is about ten times the number of ﬁsh species in Europe and two to three times the number in the Congo River. Some ﬁfty new species are identiﬁed in the Amazon each year. Ichthyologists are just now beginning to access the ﬁsh of the deepwater channels as new technologies become available for catching them. The Amazon basin supports high ﬁsh diversity in part because it is so large. Some of the diversity of ﬁsh species in the Amazon also derives from the ﬁfty million years during which South America remained an island after separating from Africa approximately sixty-ﬁve million years ago. This long isolation allowed species to evolve to ﬁll all the specialized niches of river and ﬂoodplain. The Amazon basin does not just have catﬁsh, for example: it has more than twelve hundred species of catﬁsh. These include ﬁsh that can “walk” on their ventral ﬁns between patches of water; piraíba 27\n\n2.5\n\nFish of the Amazon. Above, a fruit eater.

Some species of piranha are specialized to feed on the ﬁns of other ﬁsh, thus ensuring a continuing food supply without killing their prey.\n\n(Brachyplatystoma ﬁlamentosum) up to 1.8 meters long and weighing more than ninety kilograms; ﬁsh that change their diet between high- and low-water periods; and ﬁsh that disperse seeds by eating fruits dropping from trees in the ﬂooded forest. Other species of catﬁsh, including those known as the piramutaba (Brachyplatystoma vaillantii) and dourada (Brachyplatystoma ﬂavicans) in Brazil, migrate ﬁve thousand kilometers upstream to spawn, more than the east-west span of the continental United States. Amazonian catﬁsh have the broad, ﬂattened head and barbels characteristic of catﬁsh, but otherwise they defy expectations with their sleek, muscular bodies striped like a tiger or gleaming silver. The catﬁsh need strong muscles to hunt in the swift waters of the main channels; the Amazon basin has more predatory 29\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ncatﬁsh species larger than seventy-six centimeters long than any other freshwater system in the world. The catﬁsh also need senses other than eyesight to ﬁnd their prey in the murky depths. Their main competitors, botos and tucuxi, use sonar. The catﬁsh use a highly developed organ that links the inner ear and swim bladder to let them hear underwater, as well as olfactory cells on their barbels and bodies. Although most of the ﬁsh species in the Amazon are less than ten centimeters long when mature, the catﬁsh actively seek out the larger species for their prey. The ﬁsh found in catﬁsh stomachs also indicate that they are hunting throughout the entire water column rather than just remaining near the riverbed. The turbid waters of the Amazon present special challenges for ﬁsh navigation and communication. Approximately sixty types of “electric” ﬁsh are present, ﬁnding their way through the murky waters by sending out electrical pulses that they receive back as signals bouncing off surrounding objects. Catﬁsh use barbels as sensitive as a cat’s whiskers. Lateral lines on bony ﬁsh help them sense changes in pressure, allowing them to school. Stridulation with hard structures, a process akin to crickets’ “calling,” aids communication among some ﬁsh species. Using these adaptations for communication, the ﬁsh school at tributary mouths. Here predators such as botos gather too, and the pink ﬂash of a boto breaching to breathe provides a brief hint of all the activity going on below the surface. Some of the Amazon ﬁsh are anadromous, spending a portion of their lives in the Atlantic Ocean but ascending rivers for breeding. Steep rapids and waterfalls punctuate the Amazon’s headwaters where the rivers rush down from the Andean foothills to the vast lowland basin, or where the lowland tributaries ﬂow off the edge of the Guiana Shield in the northern Amazon basin or the Brazilian Shield in the southern basin. Migrating ﬁsh jump up these rapids and falls as energetically as salmon migrating up the rivers of western North America. The river’s ﬂood pulse sets the tempo for the life of most species of ﬁsh. More than two hundred species have evolved to eat fruits dropping into the waters of the ﬂooded forest. These ﬁsh eat well and build up stores of fat that may see them through the dry season. Another hundred species of ﬁsh specialize in grazing on the algae, protozoans, and ﬂoating organic matter that collect around the ﬂooded tree trunks. Many ﬁsh species spawn on the ﬂoodplain edges, and the currents carry the young ﬁsh into ﬂoodplain nurseries. The young ﬁsh feed well in the warm, shallow, nutrient-rich waters of the ﬂoodplain, gaining size and strength before retreating with the falling water back to the 30\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nmain channel and the perils of botos and other predators. In parts of the Amazon with a single dominant high-water season, ﬁsh species spawn once a year. In parts of the basin with two rainy seasons, some ﬁsh have more than one breeding season each year. Most important, the ﬂoodplains are a critical source of primary production, the base of an ecosystem’s food web, where plants transform the sun’s energy into a form that animals can use. In the Amazon, primary production occurs in the ﬂooded forests, in the ﬂoating meadows, and through plankton growth in ﬂoodplain lakes. Because limited sunlight penetrates the muddy whitewater rivers, primary production is minimal, and the rich ﬂush of organic detritus, plankton, ﬂoating meadows, and newly grown ﬁsh that returns to the main channels from the ﬂoodplain during falling water is critical to supporting the catﬁsh and other predators of the larger rivers. Primary production on forested blackwater rivers starts with plant parts falling from into the water overhanging vegetation. In other Amazonian environments, rising water levels trigger growth of plants, including the Paspalum and Echinochloa grasses. Invertebrates, ﬁsh, and other animals feed on the plants and in turn provide food for predatory species. Decades of work on the plant dynamics of the Amazonian ﬂoodplains, and the exchanges of ﬁsh and other organisms between the main channels and the ﬂoodplains, led German ecologist Wolfgang Junk to develop the concept of the ﬂood pulse. This now forms a powerful conceptual model for understanding the dynamics of large ﬂoodplain rivers around the world. Tropical South America, and especially the Amazon basin, provides the perfect location for developing this conceptual model. Junk estimates that the ﬂat landscape and pronounced periodicity of a large amount of annual rainfall result in 20 percent of tropical South America being covered in wetlands, with most of these wetlands lying on river ﬂoodplains.\n\nPlus or Minus One Mississippi The large scale of everything on the Amazon makes it a challenging place for scientists to conduct ﬁeld measurements. Geologist Bob Meade described the specially designed sediment sampler scaled up for the Amazon and carefully lowered over the side of a research vessel using a strong steel cable. The surging currents of the Amazon’s depths broke the cable, and the sampler the geologists had named “the jolly green giant” was lost forever on its inaugural deployment. 31\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nObidos is the farthest downstream point where the discharge of the Amazon can be gauged with any accuracy. At Obidos the Amazon ﬂows at approximately ten times the Mississippi’s ﬂow rate. Striving for plus or minus 10 percent accuracy in their measurements of river discharge at Obidos, U.S. Geological Survey scientists and their Brazilian colleagues would unwind with cold beers at the end of a successful day, congratulating one another on measuring the Amazon’s ﬂow to plus or minus one Mississippi. Downstream from Obidos, the corridor of the Amazon remains a vast watery world, but the margins appear more ﬁrmly bounded by terra ﬁrme uplands. Water hyacinths bloom in feathery clusters of white and pale lavender along quietly ﬂowing tributaries. Each blossom lasts only a day and wilts after sunset. This apparent fragility is deceptive, however, for water hyacinths are superplants in other ways. Once a mother plant is established, it quickly sends stolons branching out in all directions. On the tip of each stolon new plants rapidly form and send out stolons of their own. The stolons can break away or decay when the young plants become established, but they can also remain to form a huge mat of interconnected plants within a few months. Petioles on the plants swell into spherical bladders that keep the mat ﬂoating. Water hyacinths also propagate rapidly by seed. Each seed can remain dormant for up to twenty years and then give rise to sixty-ﬁve thousand new plants in a single season. In its native Amazon, the water hyacinth is a lovely but limited addition to the ﬂooded forest. Elsewhere in the world, the superplant is an invasive exotic that chokes waterways. The Amazon divides into many narrow distributary channels as it approaches the ocean. Low tide exposes clay cutbanks riddled with crab holes. This portion of the Amazon is a depositional area of many small islands separated by narrow creeks. As the daily rise and fall of the ocean tides affect water level and current speed here, sediment drops from suspension, creating the start of the Amazon’s delta zone. The river does not build a classic delta into the ocean, in the manner of the Mississippi or the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system. Instead, about three-quarters of the sediment plume from the Amazon is carried onto the continental shelf, and another quarter is carried north by ocean currents to join the sediment plume coming off the Orinoco River. Even this contribution is enough to overwhelm the Orinoco sediment, and there is more Amazon sediment than Orinoco sediment on the continental shelf off the Orinoco River. The Amazon remains fresh rather than saline all the way to the Atlantic. Five hundred years ago the Spanish explorer Vicente Pinzón en32\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\ncountered a spot where the sea tasted fresh as he traveled up the coast of Brazil. He named the spot the sweet sea, or mar dulce. Despite this plume of fresh Amazon water intruding into the ocean, the tidal inﬂuence on water level ﬂuctuations equals that of the annual ﬂood pulse from upstream at this point along the river. This daily tidal cycle extends a thousand kilometers up the river, although the water level rises and falls by only a few centimeters that far upstream.\n\nExploiting the Amazon Among the islands in the Amazon’s delta is Marajó, one of the world’s largest river islands at approximately ﬁfty-two thousand square kilometers. The approximately forty thousand people of the city of Breves, at the western end of the island, are mostly involved in the lumber industry and in commerce. The clear-cuts around Breves create an exception: the deforestation of the Amazon, which has received so much international attention, is mostly not apparent along the river corridor. The most extensive deforestation at present occurs on a southsoutheast axis along the existing highways, and Brazil is colonizing the Amazon from the south. Future construction of roads will likely determine the pace and location of deforestation and settlement. Road construction is partly driven by pressure for land as people migrate from other regions of Brazil. The population of Brazil currently doubles approximately every ﬁfty years, although at 170 million people the country still has a much lower population density than the United States. Those 170 million people and their descendants, however, seek higher living standards and more space. Approximately 85 percent of the 3.6 million square kilometers of the Amazon basin in Brazil are forested, and approximately 80 percent of that forest is intact. This forest stores the equivalent of about twenty years of industrial output of carbon dioxide, so its role in global climate, as well as its biodiversity, is of international concern. A 2005 study based on computerized climate modeling, for example, predicts that Amazonian deforestation will shift patterns of tropical air circulation, allowing summer moisture to travel farther north and strengthening the summer monsoon in the southwestern United States. The potential local effects of deforestation on hydrology and soil fertility also are worrisome. Reasoning by analogy from the history of land use in river basins of temperate regions, scientists predict that the severity and frequency of ﬂoods will increase in the Amazon lowlands 33\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nas a result of deforestation. The mechanisms of such changes are well documented in more densely settled regions, where removing trees leads to erosion of hill slopes. Eroding hill slopes cause sedimentation in river channels, which then lose capacity to transport large volumes of water and ﬂood overbank more frequently. Deforestation also results in loss of hill slope inﬁltration capacity and consequent increases in rapid delivery of precipitation from hill slopes to stream channels, further exacerbating ﬂooding. Reduced transpiration as plant roots extract less moisture is also likely to be an important contributor to higher, faster rises in ﬂoodwaters within the Amazon basin. Water and sediment rushing off hill slopes carry carbon and nitrogen along with them. The secret to sustaining life in the Amazon basin is that nutrients that elsewhere are stored in the soil are here stored in the organisms of the forests and rivers. One of the tragedies of contemporary deforestation in the Amazon is that it releases these stored nutrients to be carried down the intricate network of rivers and released into the sea. Other human enterprises besides deforestation now affect the Amazon basin. Development of oil and gas reserves has enhanced road building and caused spills of crude oil into the Amazon’s tributary, the Urucu River. Principal gold mining areas form a belt through the south-central Amazon to the southwestern headwaters and along the northern margins of the basin. Mercury was used to process placer gold in some of the headwater streams, and the highly toxic mercury gradually made its way down tributaries and into the main Amazon. Somewhere between nine hundred and twelve hundred tons of mercury were released into the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin during the 1990s as part of gold processing. Water, sediment, ﬁsh, and the people who eat ﬁsh along the Tapajós and Madeira rivers now show increased levels of mercury. Although the main river remains undammed, twenty dams on tributary rivers fragment the connectivity of the river ecosystem and regulate the downstream movement of water. More than 1 percent of ﬂow in the river basin is regulated, which is enough to earn the Amazon a moderately impacted rating on a 2005 evaluation of ﬂow regulation on rivers around the world. As of 2003, seven hydropower dams existed in the basin, primarily on southern tributaries. By 2008, the Brazilian government proposed to build ten more dams within a few years, including some extremely large ones. One of the world’s largest hydroelectric plants, the Tucuruí, was inaugurated on the Tocantins River in 1984. Power generated by this dam has enabled large-scale industrialization in the eastern Amazon. Brazil also proposes to build what would be the 34\n\nT H E A M A ZON: RI V ER S OF BLUSH ING DOLPH INS\n\nworld’s second largest hydroelectric dam along the Xingu. The primary purpose of this dam is to provide electricity for Chinese companies involved in metal mining and manufacture in the eastern Amazon. Brazil is at present the third or fourth largest producer of hydroelectric power in the world, although only 4 percent of its hydropower potential is developed (compared with 24 percent development of potential hydropower sources in the United States). Study after study has demonstrated how dams have impoverished the diversity and health of rivers in the United States. Studies of Brazil’s Tucuruí Dam show a 50 percent reduction in ﬁsh diversity downstream, yet the Brazilian government continues to support the construction of new dams. Plans to divert water from the Tocantins basin into Brazil’s semiarid Nordeste region largely ignore the potential for regional water shortages in the Amazon. This potential exists, however. By December 2005, the worst drought to occur since records began to be kept nearly a century ago had evaporated ﬂoodplain lakes, resulted in forest ﬁres and the deaths of ﬁsh and crops, and stranded caboclos who rely on boat travel along smaller rivers. Scientists attributed the drought to the rise in water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean that also triggered the devastating hurricane season of 2005. More ominously, they speculated that if global warming is involved, this may be the start of more severe and frequent droughts in the Amazon basin. Thus, although less altered than most of the world’s large rivers, the complex world of the Rivers Amazon has been altered and continues to change in response to human actions.\n\nThe Ultimate River The immensity of water ﬂowing down the Amazon represents the world’s ultimate river: the largest drainage area, the greatest volume of discharge, and according to some geographers, the longest channel. This river creates its own world. Every living thing within the ﬂoodplains of the Amazon basin must adapt to the rise and fall of the great river’s seasonal ﬂoods. Trees grow buttresses and stilt roots to remain upright in the waterlogged soil and send seeds ﬂoating out on the currents. Fish migrate thousands of kilometers to reach the abundance of the ﬂooded forest, feasting on the fruit and seeds dropped by the inundated plants, then fasting during the dry season. Other ﬁsh time their spawning so their young can use the ﬂooded forest as nursery habitat. Freshwater sponges in the ﬂooded forest ﬂourish during the wet season, 35\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nthen become dormant through the dry season. Spiders, centipedes, ants, and other small creatures move up the trees of the ﬂooded forest as available habitat contracts with the rising of the waters, then move back down as the waters ebb. Forty species of monkeys and more than nine hundred species of birds move between the terra ﬁrme uplands and the ﬂooded forest to take advantage of food and habitat as they become available. The river world overﬂows with abundance. Some thirty thousand species of ﬂowering plants grace the ﬂooded forest, the terra ﬁrme, and the ﬂoating meadows. This is three times the number found in Europe. The rivers contain the greatest variety of predatory ﬁsh of any freshwater system on Earth. The tributary Rio Negro alone contains an estimated seven hundred ﬁsh species, six to seven times as many as in all of North America. In all, the region contains at least two million species of living organisms, relatively few of which have been studied or are well understood by scientists. This environment that is so poor in nutrients is nonetheless rich in life. Now, unfortunately, the Amazon is also unique for the limited degree to which humans have altered the dynamics of the river basin. The Amazon still ﬂoods thousands of square kilometers each year, creating a complex topography of levees and secondary channels and carrying vast quantities of sediment down to the ocean. Countless ﬁsh still migrate up and down the river corridor. The Amazon provides a glimpse into the way many of the world’s great rivers functioned before they were dammed, diverted, and polluted. But now the Amazon basin approaches a critical point in history. Commercial utilization of the uplands, the ﬂooded forest, the power of the seasonally ﬂooded rivers, and the abundance and diversity of the ﬁsh fauna will inevitably alter the Amazon. It remains to be seen whether this alteration takes the form of impoverishment, leaving the Amazon basin drained of the complexity that makes it such a wonderland at the start of the twentyﬁrst century, or whether the alteration represents a milder loss of abundance. The evolutionary fate of hundreds of thousands of species, and of an entire river ecosystem, is in human hands. If in the future people in the Amazon can no longer hear the soft whoosh of botos surfacing to breathe, or see squirrel monkeys ﬂinging themselves across gaps in the forest canopy like trapeze artists, or follow green tunnels into the secret world of the ﬂooded forest where submerged microphones record the crackling and buzzing of electric ﬁsh beneath mats of grama dulce, we may have to begin children’s fairy tales with, “Once, long ago, there was a world full of wonders. . . .” 36\n\nInterlude After a journey of nearly four months down the Amazon River, the water droplet that fell on the upper basin as late winter rain reaches the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon enters as a gushing, uniﬁed ﬂow with enough mass and momentum to lower the salinity more than a hundred kilometers out into the Atlantic. The ﬂoating islands of grass carrying insects and larger creatures, the big logs, the masses of sediment suspended in the warm brown water— everything gets rushed into the open ocean to mix with the warm surface current in the Atlantic that has ﬂowed westward across the ocean south of the equator and then turned north and accelerated up the east coast of South America. Approximately one-third of the mass of sediment brought down by the river enriches the delta of the lower Amazon. Another one-sixth is carried northwestward by the North Brazil Current and deposited along the coastlines of French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana. The remaining half accumulates on the continental shelf adjacent to the Amazon’s mouth at a rate that scientists estimate at half a billion tons each year. This tremendous accumulation has created the Amazon Fan, a wedge of sediment with a surface area larger than the state of Florida (more than 700 kilometers long and 250 kilometers wide) and eleven thousand meters thick that has sufﬁcient mass to cause local ﬂexure of Earth’s crust. Sediment accumulating at the upper part of the fan periodically reaches an unstable mass and abruptly fails, ﬂowing down the steeper offshore topography and out on to the abyssal plain of the deep 37\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nocean. These abrupt failures known as turbidity currents are the submarine equivalent of a debris ﬂow on a terrestrial hill slope, and as they ﬂow downslope at speeds of two to four meters per second they carve a canyon into the submarine fan. This canyon is the lesser known remainder of the great river. The terrestrial portion of the Amazon River is approximately sixty-three hundred kilometers long. The submarine portion of the river’s channel extends another nine hundred kilometers beyond the edge of the continental shelf and has a much steeper gradient than even the Andean headwaters of the terrestrial portion of the river. When the Amazon is ﬂowing high, as it is in early June, intense vertical mixing enriches the water in its estuary with radium-228. Scientists use this distinctive isotopic signature to trace the Amazon water as it moves north and west along the coast of South America as part of the North Brazil Current. The naturally occurring radioactive isotope of radium that provides a tracer for the Amazon water is overshadowed by the many artiﬁcial radionuclides measured in low concentrations throughout the global oceans as a result of discharges from nuclear facilities and weapons testing. Fallout from weapons testing is the single largest source of radionuclides in the ocean, but industrial plants and military activities create locally high concentrations. As the Amazon’s freshwater mixes with the seawater, the uniﬁed ﬂow separates into lobes. The lobes in turn separate into freshwater lenses three hundred kilometers in diameter that are twenty to ﬁfty meters deep. These lenses of freshwater move like rafts within the North Brazil Current, beyond the border of Brazil to the coast off French Guiana. Here some of the water separates from the coastal ﬂow and doubles back to the east and then south in the North Equatorial Countercurrent. The rest of the North Brazil Current continues northwestward past Suriname to form the Guiana Current. In company with the rest of the Guiana Current, the Amazon water droplet enters the Caribbean between the Windward Islands and the coast of South America. The nutrients leached from the lush rain forests of the Amazon and Orinoco basins nourish a rich Caribbean ecosystem of giant corals and sponges. The Guiana Current can extend ﬁve hundred kilometers offshore during spring, but the highest velocities occur along the edge of the continental shelf. By September the current slows considerably as the Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts north. This atmospheric shift weakens the winds along the French Guiana coast of South America, which change from northeasterly to southeasterly. Combined with the decrease in Amazon discharge after 38\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nJune, these changes also weaken the Guiana Current. But in June the Guiana Current is strong, and the Amazon water droplet is rushed into the Caribbean. Here, ﬁfteen hundred kilometers from its source, the Guiana Current still retains the unique radium signature generated in the Amazonian estuary, despite being diluted by the discharge of the Orinoco River. Inﬁnite possibilities exist for the water droplet that has moved northward from the Amazon. It could be recycled among the reef communities many times, taken up by a zooxanthella, one of the millions of tiny, single-celled plants within a coral; ingested by a parrotﬁsh grazing on the coral; passed on to a barracuda that eats the parrotﬁsh and then to a large shark that in turn eats the barracuda; expelled by the shark and taken up by a tiny plankton; and so on. But in early September the water droplet is evaporated and moves into the upper atmosphere as part of the Hadley cell. This portion of the equatorial circulation pattern was described in 1735 by English lawyer and amateur meteorologist George Hadley (1685–1768). Warm, moist air converges at the equator, where the Coriolis force is negligible and the air moves primarily upward. This is the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which mariners know as the doldrums, because wind-driven ships often made little progress among the light, constantly shifting breezes near the equator. Much of the upward movement in the doldrums occurs through thunderstorms that transport heat and moisture through the troposphere to the boundary with the stratosphere at twelve to ﬁfteen kilometers above Earth’s surface. At this point the air stops rising and ﬂows either northward or southward. Air moving toward the poles at these heights is acted on by the Coriolis force, creating a clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and a counterclockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere. As the air moves toward the poles it loses heat and moisture and eventually descends back toward the surface at about 30° north and south of the equator. The descending air is compressed and warmed, and twisted by the Coriolis force. Well over a kilometer above the surface, the dry, subsiding air enters the boundary layer and ﬂows back toward the equator at the surface in the form of the trade winds. When the trade winds reach the equator they once again rise, completing the Hadley cell. The water droplet from the Amazon, having moved northward in the Hadley cell, descends toward the surface in the subtropical highpressure belt at 30° north, where it is incorporated into the Ferrel cell, named for William Ferrel (1817–91). Ferrel developed a model of global atmospheric circulation based on three cells: the Hadley cell at low 39\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nPolar Cell Ferrel Cell\n\nPolar easterlies 60° sub pol ar\n\nHadley Cell\n\nlow\n\n30° Westerlies\n\n0°e qua tor ial low\n\ns ude atit subtropical high - horse l\n\nNE trade winds\n\nms doldru\n\nHadley Cell SE trade winds\n\nFerrel Cell I.1\n\nIdealized illustration of the three-cell model of wind patterns on a rotating Earth.\n\nlatitudes, the Ferrel cell at intermediate latitudes, and the polar cell at the highest latitudes. Air descending at the subtropical high-pressure belt can return toward the equator at the surface as part of the Hadley cell, or it can ﬂow toward the pole at the surface as part of the Ferrel cell. Surface ﬂow in the Ferrel cell extends to the subpolar lows, which are large bands of low pressure at 50° to 60° north and south, where the air rises again as a result of convergence with the polar cell. As it rises, the air diverges. Some returns to the subtropical high-pressure belt and descends once more, completing the Ferrel cell. Some air moves toward the poles before descending and ﬂowing back at the surface as the polar cell. Despite the intuitive appeal of the three-cell model of global air patterns, the Hadley cell is the only portion of the circulation that is well deﬁned. Land-ocean interactions and the effects of surface topography distort the Ferrel and polar cells so dramatically that they are only vague abstractions superimposed on the complexities of real circulation patterns. Scientists use the Ferrel and polar cells almost as shorthand for the general patterns of movement in the higher latitudes. Moving with the Ferrel cell, the Amazon water droplet travels across 40\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nthe Atlantic toward the low-pressure zone between 50° and 60° north, where its path is skewed east over Europe by the polar front jet stream. Climatologists describe the subtropical and polar front jet streams as rivers of air. Nothing could be more appropriate. Like a river of water, the jet stream branches and rejoins yet remains a distinct entity nine to twelve kilometers above Earth’s surface. Moving along at speeds of 110 kilometers an hour during winter and 50 kilometers an hour in summer, turbulent currents roil its ﬂow. And, like a river of water, a variety of substances other than air and water travel with the jet stream. POPs are one of the travelers riding the jet stream, the Hadley cell, and other circulation systems around the globe. POPs sounds rather cute, and even the full phrase—persistent organic pollutants—doesn’t sound too bad, thanks to that “organic” in the middle. In this case, organic can be very misleading, because it simply means that these compounds include carbon atoms. Indeed, POPs are among the most toxic materials synthesized by chemists. POPs include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and other compounds that, although originally developed for purposes such as insulating or cooling transformers and capacitors, have proved to be both highly persistent in the environment and extremely toxic to nearly all forms of life. From their primary sources in urban areas, the POPs are spread globally through both local transport and deposition and long-range oceanic and atmospheric transport that mainly deposits them at high latitudes. The Amazon water droplet moving across Europe with the jet stream is joined by a variety of POPs released from European cities, growing more sullied with each kilometer of its journey. As the water droplet moves toward Siberia, it is passed by a counterﬂow of migratory ducks, geese, and birds of prey returning to lower latitudes for the winter. The POP concentrations in these birds will depend on their gender (males usually have higher concentrations than females) and on what and where they eat. The air mass carrying the water droplet moves across the vast ﬂat, watery expanse of Siberia. Only the lines of rivers that have not yet frozen create perspective within the gray-and-white plains. The air mass and all its freight—water, dust, PCBs, mercury, and so forth—moves northeast across Siberia until it collides with the polar front. The Amazon water droplet falls as snow on the headwaters of the Ob-Irtysh River late in the autumn.\n\n41\n\nTHREE\n\nThe Ob: Killing Grandmother On a map, the channels of the Ob River basin look like the generic drainage network used in textbooks to illustrate river catchments. Dozens of smaller channels that spread across the broad upper basin join as they gradually concentrate into the slender lower basin. The rivers follow irregular, twining paths on even a very small map, and their sinuous traces join like the branches of a tree to form the perfect dendritic channel network. Except that the Ob network seems upside down. By convention, illustrations show rivers funneling down toward an outlet at the bottom of the drawing. The Ob ﬂows north from the Altai and Ural mountains into the long Gulf of Ob that eventually opens into the Arctic Ocean. Rivers in the Ob drainage form a dendritic pattern in part because most of the basin is ﬂat and homogeneous. Once the rivers leave the Ural and Altai headwaters, they cross nearly a thousand kilometers of vast Siberian plains. No outcrop of resistant bedrock or rising landmass interrupts their course. This ﬂat land is nonetheless a region of harsh extremes. Air temperature can drop to –55°C along the Ob in January but rise above 40°C in July. Much of the treeless plains of the middle and lower drainage is underlain by permanently frozen ground, so that winter snows melt into waters that form vast marsh complexes rather than soaking into the ground. Small portions of the drainage receive a hundred centimeters of precipitation each year, but most of the Ob’s catchment averages only 42\n\nTHE OB: KILLING GR ANDMOTHER\n\n70° E\n\n80°\n\nSa lek ha rd\n\nGulf of Ob\n\nARCTIC OCEAN\n\nN\n\nMO UN TA INS\n\n.\n\nArctic Circle 35000\n\nOb River at Salekhard\n\n65° N\n\n.\n\nUR AL\n\nSurgut\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOb\n\n10000\n\n.\n\nk sibirs Novo Irty\n\nJun\n\nAug\n\nOct\n\nDec\n\nTomsk\n\n.\n\nsh\n\nIsh im\n\n..\n\nb\n\nOmsk\n\nApr\n\nm To\n\nTo bo l\n\n15000\n\nFeb\n\nKuznetsk\n\ntun Ka\n\na Biy\n\n. .\n\nSemipalatinsk\n\n3.1\n\n20000\n\n0\n\nTyumen\n\nChelyabinsk\n\n0\n\n25000\n\n5000\n\nTobolsk\n\nO\n\n.\n\nMonthly mean discharge (cubic meters per second)\n\n30000\n\nUst Kamenogorsk\n\nALTAI MOUNTAINS\n\n670 km Schematic map of the Ob drainage basin, showing the major stream channels and cities mentioned in the text.

When averaged over a century, portions of the Ob’s headwaters are in drought nearly half of the time. Much of the precipitation that does fall on the Ob drainage comes as summer rain because a high-pressure zone dominates Siberia from November to March in response to strong cooling of the ground surface. This cooling occurs each year as snow cover increases reﬂectivity of Earth’s surface and inhibits heat ﬂow from the ground. Fronts of moister air coming off the North Atlantic periodically bring winter snowfalls to the Ob basin, and moist, warm air coming from the tropics will occasionally make it as far northeast as the Ob estuary. But mostly winter is dominated by cold, dry air ﬂowing across Siberia from the Arctic Ocean and northern Europe. In summer, solar heating of the ground allows absorbed energy to be returned to the atmosphere, promoting turbulent heat and moisture exchanges that give rise to rainfall.
