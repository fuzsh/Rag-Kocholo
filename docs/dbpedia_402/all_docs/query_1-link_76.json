A simple numerical model of essential SOC and ICE dynamics, developed and integrated north of 50Â° N for 125,000 years since the last interglacial, reconstructed the history and 1Â° distribution of SOC and ICE consistent with current knowledge, together with successful demonstration of climatic and topographical controls on SOC evolution.\n\nLinks between annual surface temperature variation and land cover heterogeneity for a boreal forest as characterized by continuous, fibre-optic DTS monitoring\n\nKazuyuki Saito, Go Iwahana, Hiroki Ikawa, Hirohiko Nagano, and Robert C.

This instrumentation illustrated characteristics of temperature variations and snow pack dynamics under different land cover types.\n\nPast, present and future biomes in Beringia: Comparison between simulations and pollen analysis\n\nKazuyuki Saito, Amy Hendricks, John Walsh, and Nancy Bigelow\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2018-29,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2018-29, 2018\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation in Beringia, between Alaska and Eastern Russia, were simulated for a glacial (LGM) and warm past (mid-Holocene), the modern, and the end of this century. Modern and mid-Holocene biomes were simulated consistent with observations. Pollens indicate cold tundras covered the Bering Land Bridge almost entirely at the LGM, but the simulations show large variations, with the majority producing northern forests at southeastern. The future results show a general northward shift of biomes.\n\nAssessment of model estimates of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange across Northern Eurasia\n\nM. A. Rawlins, A. D. McGuire, J. S.

Model estimates were assessed against independent ground and satellite measurements. We find that the models show a weakening of the CO2 sink over time; the models tend to overestimate respiration, causing an underestimate in NEP; the model range in regional NEP is twice the multimodel mean. Residence time for soil carbon decreased, amid a gain in carbon storage.\n\nLast Millennium Volcanic Forcing and Climate Response using SO2 Emissions\n\nLauren R. Marshall, Anja Schmidt, Andrew P.

We explore this mismatch using the latest models and find a better match to tree-ring reconstructions for some eruptions. Our results show that the way in which eruptions are simulated in models matters for the comparison to tree-rings, particularly regarding the spatial spread of volcanic aerosol.\n\nAssessment of the southern polar and subpolar warming in the PMIP4 Last Interglacial simulations using paleoclimate data syntheses\n\nQinggang Gao, Emilie Capron, Louise C.

However, when only forced by orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentrations during that period, state-of-the-art climate models do not reproduce the magnitude of warming. Here we show that much of the warming at southern mid-to-high latitudes can be reproduced by a UK climate model HadCM3 with a 3000-year freshwater forcing over the North Atlantic.\n\nHighly stratified mid-Pliocene Southern Ocean in PlioMIP2\n\nJulia E.

The CO2 concentration and the smaller Antarctic Ice Sheet both have a similar and approximately equal impact on the Southern Ocean. The conditions of the Southern Ocean in the mid-Pliocene could therefore be analogous to those in a future climate with smaller ice sheets.\n\nAntarctic climate response in Last-Interglacial simulations using the Community Earth System Model (CESM2)\n\nMira Berdahl, Gunter R.

Using a global climate model, we investigate climate conditions near the AIS during the Last Interglacial (129 to 116 kyr ago), a period with warmer global temperatures and higher sea level than today. We identify the orbital and freshwater forcings that could cause ice loss and probe the mechanisms that lead to warmer climate conditions.\n\nSurface mass balance and climate of the Last Glacial Maximum Northern Hemisphere ice sheets: simulations with CESM2.1\n\nSarah L.

We provide a detailed analysis of surface mass and energy components for two time periods that bracket the LGM: 26 and 21 ka BP. We use an earth system model which has been adopted for modern ice sheets. We find that all Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have a positive surface mass balance apart from the British and Irish ice sheets and the North American ice sheet complex.\n\nMulti-model assessment of the deglacial climatic evolution at high southern latitudes\n\nTakashi Obase, Laurie Menviel, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Tristan Vadsaria, Ruza Ivanovic, Brooke Snoll, Sam Sherriff-Tadano, Paul Valdes, Lauren Gregoire, Marie-Luise Kapsch, Uwe Mikolajewicz, Nathaelle Bouttes, Didier Roche, Fanny Lhardy, Chengfei He, Bette Otto-Bliesner, Zhengyu Liu, and Wing-Le Chan\n\nClim.

We find that atmospheric CO2 changes and AMOC changes are the primary drivers of the major warming and cooling during the middle stage of the deglaciation. The multi-model analysis highlights the model’s sensitivity of CO2, AMOC to meltwater, and the meltwater history on temperature changes in southern high latitudes.\n\nThe hydrological cycle and ocean circulation of the Maritime Continent in the Pliocene: results from PlioMIP2\n\nXin Ren, Daniel J.

Besides, the fresh and warm water transfer through the Maritime Continent was stronger. In order to avoid undue influence from closely related models in the multimodel results, we introduce a new metric, the multi-cluster mean, which could reveal spatial signals that are not captured by the multimodel mean.\n\nEnvironmental controls on observed spatial variability of soil pore water geochemistry in small headwater catchments underlain with permafrost\n\nNathan Alec Conroy, Jeffrey M.

Vegetation type, soil moisture and redox conditions, weathering and hydrologic transport, and mineral solubility were all found to be the primary drivers of the existing spatial variability of some soil pore water solutes.\n\nLegacyClimate 1.0: a dataset of pollen-based climate reconstructions from 2594 Northern Hemisphere sites covering the last 30 kyr and beyond\n\nUlrike Herzschuh, Thomas BÃ¶hmer, Chenzhi Li, Manuel Chevalier, RaphaÃ«l HÃ©bert, Anne Dallmeyer, Xianyong Cao, Nancy H.

We present pollen-based reconstructions of mean July temperature, mean annual temperature, and annual precipitation from 2594 pollen records from the Northern Hemisphere, using three reconstruction methods (WA-PLS, WA-PLS_tailored, and MAT). Since no global or hemispheric synthesis of quantitative precipitation changes are available for the Holocene so far, this dataset will be of great value to the geoscientific community.\n\nUnraveling the mechanisms and implications of a stronger mid-Pliocene Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in PlioMIP2\n\nJulia E.

The mid-Pliocene was about 3 million years ago and had a similar CO2 concentration to today. We show that the stronger AMOC during this period relates to changes in geography and that this has a significant influence on ocean temperatures and heat transported northwards by the Atlantic Ocean. Understanding the behavior of the mid-Pliocene AMOC can help us to learn more about our future climate.\n\nCalendar effects on surface air temperature and precipitation based on model-ensemble equilibrium and transient simulations from PMIP4 and PACMEDY\n\nXiaoxu Shi, Martin Werner, Carolin Krug, Chris M.

With the use of multiple model outputs, we found that such a bias is non-ignorable and should be corrected to ensure an accurate comparison between modeled results and observational records, as well as between simulated past and modern climates, especially for the Last Interglacial.\n\nEvaluating the large-scale hydrological cycle response within the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2) ensemble\n\nZixuan Han, Qiong Zhang, Qiang Li, Ran Feng, Alan M.

Our study implies that an imbalance in interhemispheric atmospheric energy during the mid-Pliocene could have led to changes in the dynamic effect, offsetting the thermodynamic effect and, hence, altering mid-Pliocene hydroclimate cycling. Moreover, a robust westward shift in the Pacific Walker circulation can moisten the northern Indian Ocean.\n\nReduced El NiÃ±o variability in the mid-Pliocene according to the PlioMIP2 ensemble\n\nArthur M.

It is an interesting period to study, as it saw similar atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to the present day. We find that the El NiÃ±o events were less strong in the mid-Pliocene simulations, when compared to pre-industrial climate. Our results could help to interpret El NiÃ±o behaviour in future climate projections.\n\nMid-Pliocene West African Monsoon rainfall as simulated in the PlioMIP2 ensemble\n\nEllen Berntell, Qiong Zhang, Qiang Li, Alan M.

Though previous studies of future projections show a west–east drying–wetting contrast over the Sahel, these results indicate a uniform rainfall increase over the Sahel in warm climates characterized by increased greenhouse gas forcing.\n\nConsequences of permafrost degradation for Arctic infrastructure â bridging the model gap between regional and engineering scales\n\nThomas Schneider von Deimling, Hanna Lee, Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen, Sebastian Westermann, Vladimir Romanovsky, Scott Lamoureux, Donald A.

We use this case study to discuss the broader-scale applicability of our model for simulating future Arctic infrastructure failure.\n\nMid-Pliocene Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation simulated in PlioMIP2\n\nZhongshi Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Chuncheng Guo, Odd Helge OtterÃ¥, Kerim H.

However, our current multi-model intercomparison shows large model spreads and model–data discrepancies, which can not support the previous hypothesis. Our study shows good consistency with future projections of the AMOC.\n\nNumerical model to simulate long-term soil organic carbon and ground ice budget with permafrost and ice sheets (SOC-ICE-v1.0)\n\nKazuyuki Saito, Hirokazu Machiya, Go Iwahana, Tokuta Yokohata, and Hiroshi Ohno\n\nGeosci.

The latest PMIP4-CMIP6 models all simulate this decrease, consistent with reconstructions. However, neither the models nor the reconstructions agree on the possibility of a seasonally ice-free Arctic. Work to clarify the reasons for this model divergence and the conflicting interpretations of the records will thus be needed.\n\nLarge-scale features of Last Interglacial climate: results from evaluating the lig127k simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)âPaleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4)\n\nBette L.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), when the CO2 level was comparable to today. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in the model simulations and imply that we must be careful when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.\n\nThe Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2: large-scale climate features and climate sensitivity\n\nAlan M.

The PlioMIP2 ensemble average was ~ 3.2 °C warmer and experienced ~ 7 % more precipitation than the pre-industrial era, although there are large regional variations. PlioMIP2 broadly agrees with a new proxy dataset of Pliocene sea surface temperatures. Combining PlioMIP2 and proxy data suggests that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 would increase globally averaged temperature by 2.6–4.8 °C.\n\nLarge-scale features and evaluation of the PMIP4-CMIP6 midHolocene simulations\n\nChris M.

Our geological data and climate models show that global mean sea-surface temperatures were 2.3 to 3.2 ÂºC warmer than pre-industrial climate, that the mid-latitudes and high latitudes warmed more than the tropics, and that the warming was particularly enhanced in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nN2O changes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the preindustrial â PartÂ 2: terrestrial N2O emissions and carbonânitrogen cycle interactions\n\nFortunat Joos, Renato Spahni, Benjamin D.

Modelled and reconstructed emissions increased strongly during past abrupt warming events. This evidence appears consistent with a dynamic response of biological N fixation to increasing N demand by ecosystems, thereby reducing N limitation of plant productivity and supporting a land sink for atmospheric CO2.\n\nA distributed temperature profiling method for assessing spatial variability in ground temperatures in a discontinuous permafrost region of Alaska\n\nEmmanuel LÃ©ger, Baptiste Dafflon, Yves Robert, Craig Ulrich, John E.

We tested a DTP system prototype by moving it sequentially across a discontinuous permafrost environment. The DTP enabled high-resolution identification of near-surface permafrost location and covariability with topography, vegetation, and soil properties.\n\nThe penultimate deglaciation: protocol for Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) phase 4 transient numerical simulations between 140 and 127 ka, version 1.0\n\nLaurie Menviel, Emilie Capron, Aline Govin, Andrea Dutton, Lev Tarasov, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Russell N.

To better understand the changes, we need a comprehensive dataset across various sites. We synthesize permafrost-related data in the state of Alaska. It should be a valuable permafrost dataset that is worth maintaining in the future. On a wider level, it also provides a prototype of basic data collection and management for permafrost regions in general.\n\nThe penultimate deglaciation: protocol for PMIP4 transient numerical simulations between 140 and 127 ka\n\nLaurie Menviel, Emilie Capron, Aline Govin, Andrea Dutton, Lev Tarasov, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Russell Drysdale, Philip Gibbard, Lauren Gregoire, Feng He, Ruza Ivanovic, Masa Kageyama, Kenji Kawamura, Amaelle Landais, Bette L.

Modern and mid-Holocene biomes were simulated consistent with observations. Pollens indicate cold tundras covered the Bering Land Bridge almost entirely at the LGM, but the simulations show large variations, with the majority producing northern forests at southeastern. The future results show a general northward shift of biomes.\n\nThe PMIP4 contribution to CMIP6 â Part 1: Overview and over-arching analysis plan\n\nMasa Kageyama, Pascale Braconnot, Sandy P.

Parazoo, Charles D. Koven, David M. Lawrence, Vladimir Romanovsky, and Charles E. Miller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 123–144, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon models suggest the permafrost carbon feedback (soil carbon emissions from permafrost thaw) acts as a slow, unobservable leak. We investigate if permafrost temperature provides an observable signal to detect feedbacks. We find a slow carbon feedback in warm sub-Arctic permafrost soils, but potentially rapid feedback in cold Arctic permafrost. This is surprising since the cold permafrost region is dominated by tundra and underlain by deep, cold permafrost thought impervious to such changes.\n\nImpacts of microtopographic snow redistribution and lateral subsurface processes on hydrologic and thermal states in an Arctic polygonal ground ecosystem: a case study using ELM-3D v1.0\n\nGautam Bisht, William J.

Simulation results at a polygonal tundra site near Barrow, Alaska, showed that inclusion of SR resulted in a better agreement with observations. Excluding lateral subsurface processes had a small impact on mean states but caused a large overestimation of spatial variability in soil moisture and temperature.\n\nComparing proxy and model estimates of hydroclimate variability and change over the Common Era\n\nPAGES Hydro2k Consortium\n\nClim.

We review how proxy records of past climate and climate model simulations can be used in tandem to understand hydroclimate variability over the last 2000 years and how these tools can also inform risk assessments of future hydroclimatic extremes.\n\nThe PMIP4 contribution to CMIP6 â Part 3: The last millennium, scientific objective, and experimental design for the PMIP4 past1000 simulations\n\nJohann H.

Evaluating these simulations using paleoenvironmental data will provide direct out-of-sample tests of the reliability of state-of-the-art models to simulate climate changes.\n\nThe PMIP4 contribution to CMIP6 â Part 4: Scientific objectives and experimental design of the PMIP4-CMIP6 Last Glacial Maximum experiments and PMIP4 sensitivity experiments\n\nMasa Kageyama, Samuel Albani, Pascale Braconnot, Sandy P.

Ground temperature measurements confirmed permafrost presence in the region, but remotely sensed images showed that permafrost plateau extent decreased by 60â¯% since 1950. Better understanding these vulnerable permafrost deposits is important for predicting future permafrost extent across all permafrost regions that are warming.\n\nScaling-up permafrost thermal measurements in western Alaska using an ecotype approach\n\nWilliam L.

In this paper we show that classifying the landscape into landcover types is an effective way to scale up permafrost temperature data collected from field monitoring sites. Based on these results, a map of mean annual ground temperature ranges at 1 m depth was produced. The map should be useful for land use decision making and identifying potential risk areas.\n\nTwo Interglacials: Scientific Objectives and Experimental Designs for CMIP6 and PMIP4 Holocene and Last Interglacial Simulations\n\nBette L.

Differences in simulated airâsoil temperature relationships and their modulation by climate conditions are found to be related to the snow model physics. Generally, models with better performance apply multilayer snow schemes.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere storminess in the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-M)\n\nErlend M. Knudsen and John E. Walsh\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 2335–2355, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-2335-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-2335-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, two global climate models (NorESM1-M and CCSM4) are compared to an observational-based data set (ERA-Interim) for their ability to simulate historical Arctic storminess in autumn. With this in hand, the models are run through the 21st century. We find an overall significant increase in precipitation expected, with generally fewer and weaker storms in midlatitudes and partly more and stronger storms in high-latitudes. The tendencies are strongest in areas of Arctic sea ice retreat.\n\nArctic sea ice simulation in the PlioMIP ensemble\n\nFergus W. Howell, Alan M. Haywood, Bette L.

Ensemble variability in sea ice extent is greater in the mid-Pliocene summer, when half of the models simulate sea-ice-free conditions. Weaker correlations are seen between sea ice extent and temperatures in the pre-industrial era compared to the mid-Pliocene. The need for more comprehensive sea ice proxy data is highlighted, in order to better compare model performances.\n\nThe Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) Phase 2: scientific objectives and experimental design\n\nAlan M.

We outline the way in which climate models should be set up in order to study the Pliocene – a period of global warmth in Earth's history which is relevant for our understanding of future climate change. By conducting a model intercomparison we hope to understand the uncertainty associated with model predictions of a warmer climate.\n\nEffect of soil property uncertainties on permafrost thaw projections: a calibration-constrained analysis\n\nD.

Model estimates were assessed against independent ground and satellite measurements. We find that the models show a weakening of the CO2 sink over time; the models tend to overestimate respiration, causing an underestimate in NEP; the model range in regional NEP is twice the multimodel mean. Residence time for soil carbon decreased, amid a gain in carbon storage.\n\nTwelve thousand years of dust: the Holocene global dust cycle constrained by natural archives\n\nS. Albani, N. M.

It is important to understand whether such predictions are consistent among different models, especially in warm periods of relevance to the future. We use input from 15 different climate models to run one ice sheet model and compare the predictions over Greenland. We find that there are large differences between the predicted ice sheets for the warm Pliocene (c. 3 million years ago).\n\nReconstruction of recent climate change in Alaska from the Aurora Peak ice core, central Alaska\n\nA.

The ice core age was determined by annual counts of Î´D and seasonal cycles of Na+. Here, we show that the chronology of the Aurora Peak ice core from 95.61 m to the top corresponds to the period from 1900 to the summer season of 2008, with a dating error of Â±3 years. Our results suggest that temporal variations in Î´D and annual accumulation rates are strongly related to shifts in PDO Index.\n\nModeling Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet distribution during MIS 5 and MIS 7 glacial inceptions\n\nF.

Major differences among the two terminations are that the ice sheets retreat earlier and the Atlantic oceanic circulation is more prone to collapse during the penultimate termination. However, for both terminations the pattern of ice retreat is similar, and this retreat is primarily explained by orbital forcing changes and greenhouse gas concentration changes.\n\nLast Glacial Maximum climate and atmospheric circulation over the Australian region from climate models\n\nYanxuan Du, Josephine R.

We present a climate model simulation using MRI–CGCM2.3 to elucidate the impact of insolation changes over the past 450 kyr. We find that EASM precipitation is influenced by insolation changes through alterations in atmospheric circulation caused by the intensification of the North Pacific High and the North Pacific subtropical high.\n\nUncertainties originating from GCM downscaling and bias correction with application to the MIS-11c Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nBrian R.

Past, 20, 211–235, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-211-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-211-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was the most recent period with large ice sheets in Europe and North America. We provide a detailed analysis of surface mass and energy components for two time periods that bracket the LGM: 26 and 21 ka BP. We use an earth system model which has been adopted for modern ice sheets. We find that all Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have a positive surface mass balance apart from the British and Irish ice sheets and the North American ice sheet complex.\n\nA transient coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulation of the past 3Â million years\n\nKyung-Sook Yun, Axel Timmermann, Sun-Seon Lee, Matteo Willeit, Andrey Ganopolski, and Jyoti Jadhav\n\nClim.

This study could stimulate future transient paleo-climate model simulations and perspectives to further highlight and document the effect of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the broader paleo-climatic context.\n\nAtmosphereâcryosphere interactions during the last phase of the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) in the European Alps\n\nCostanza Del Gobbo, Renato R.

We analysed the climate south and north of the Alps, using a detailed map of the Alpine equilibrium line altitude (ELA) to study the mechanism that sustained the Alpine glaciers at 21 ka. The Genoa low and a mild Mediterranean Sea led to frequent snowfall in the southern Alps, thus preserving the glaciers and lowering the ELA.\n\nSummer surface air temperature proxies point to near-sea-ice-free conditions in the Arctic at 127 ka\n\nLouise C.

Evaluation against sea ice markers is hampered by few observations. Here, an assessment of 11 climate model simulations against summer temperatures shows that the most skilful models have a 74 %–79 % reduction in LIG sea ice. The measurements of LIG areas indicate a likely mix of ice-free and near-ice-free LIG summers.\n\nOn the importance of moisture conveyor belts from the tropical eastern Pacific for wetter conditions in the Atacama Desert during the mid-Pliocene\n\nMark Reyers, Stephanie Fiedler, Patrick Ludwig, Christoph BÃ¶hm, Volker Wennrich, and Yaping Shao\n\nClim.

The aim is to uncover the atmospheric processes that are involved in the enhancement of strong rainfall events during this period. We find that strong upper-level moisture fluxes (so-called moisture conveyor belts) originating in the tropical eastern Pacific are the main driver for increased rainfall in the mid-Pliocene.\n\nModeled storm surge changes in a warmer world: the Last Interglacial\n\nPaolo Scussolini, Job Dullaart, Sanne Muis, Alessio Rovere, Pepijn Bakker, Dim Coumou, Hans Renssen, Philip J.

We employ a novel combination of paleoclimate modeling and global ocean hydrodynamic modeling. We find that during the Last Interglacial, about 127 000 years ago, seasonal sea level extremes were indeed significantly different – higher or lower – on long stretches of the global coast. These changes are associated with different patterns of atmospheric storminess linked with meridional shifts in wind bands.\n\nNo changes in overall AMOC strength in interglacial PMIP4 time slices\n\nZhiyi Jiang, Chris Brierley, David Thornalley, and Sophie Sax\n\nClim.

We focus on the deep overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. We show that there are no robust changes in the overall strength of the circulation. We also show that the circulation hardly plays a role in changes in the surface climate across the globe.\n\nThe role of ice-sheet topography in the Alpine hydro-climate at glacial times\n\nPatricio Velasquez, Martina Messmer, and Christoph C.

We perform sensitivity simulations of up to 2 km horizontal resolution over the Alps for glacial periods. The findings demonstrate that northern hemispheric and local ice-sheet topography are important role in regulating the Alpine hydro-climate and permits a better understanding of the Alpine precipitation patterns at glacial times.\n\nSimulating glacial dust changes in the Southern Hemisphere using ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3\n\nStephan KrÃ¤tschmer, MichÃ¨lle van der Does, Frank Lamy, Gerrit Lohmann, Christoph VÃ¶lker, and Martin Werner\n\nClim. Past, 18, 67–87, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-67-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-67-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an atmospheric model coupled to an aerosol model to investigate the global mineral dust cycle with a focus on the Southern Hemisphere for warmer and colder climate states and compare our results to observational data. Our findings suggest that Australia is the predominant source of dust deposited over Antarctica during the last glacial maximum. In addition, we find that the southward transport of dust from all sources to Antarctica happens at lower altitudes in colder climates.\n\nClimate and ice sheet evolutions from the last glacial maximum to the pre-industrial period with an ice-sheetâclimate coupled model\n\nAurÃ©lien Quiquet, Didier M.

Past, 17, 2179–2199, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2179-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2179-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we discuss results obtained with a set of coupled ice-sheet–climate model experiments for the last 26 kyrs. The model displays a large sensitivity of the oceanic circulation to the amount of the freshwater flux resulting from ice sheet melting. Ice sheet geometry changes alone are not enough to lead to abrupt climate events, and rapid warming at high latitudes is here only reported during abrupt oceanic circulation recoveries that occurred when accounting for freshwater flux.\n\nThe role of land cover in the climate of glacial Europe\n\nPatricio Velasquez, Jed O. Kaplan, Martina Messmer, Patrick Ludwig, and Christoph C. Raible\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1161–1180, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1161-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1161-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study assesses the importance of resolution and land–atmosphere feedbacks for European climate. We performed an asynchronously coupled experiment that combined a global climate model (~ 100 km), a regional climate model (18 km), and a dynamic vegetation model (18 km). Modelled climate and land cover agree reasonably well with independent reconstructions based on pollen and other paleoenvironmental proxies. The regional climate is significantly influenced by land cover.\n\nSimulated stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nFrerk PÃ¶ppelmeier, Jeemijn Scheen, Aurich Jeltsch-ThÃ¶mmes, and Thomas F. Stocker\n\nClim. Past, 17, 615–632, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-615-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-615-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) critically depends on its mean state. We simulate the response of the AMOC to North Atlantic freshwater perturbations under different glacial boundary conditions. We find that a closed Bering Strait greatly increases the AMOC's sensitivity to freshwater hosing. Further, the shift from mono- to bistability strongly depends on the chosen boundary conditions, with weaker circulation states exhibiting more abrupt transitions.\n\nLarge-scale features of Last Interglacial climate: results from evaluating the lig127k simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)âPaleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4)\n\nBette L.

We present a multi-model ensemble of 17 climate models, most of which have also completed the CMIP6 DECK experiments and are thus important for assessing future projections. The lig127ksimulations show strong summer warming over the NH continents. More than half of the models simulate a retreat of the Arctic minimum summer ice edge similar to the average for 2000–2018.\n\nEvaluation of Arctic warming in mid-Pliocene climate simulations\n\nWesley de Nooijer, Qiong Zhang, Qiang Li, Qiang Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Zhongshi Zhang, Chuncheng Guo, Kerim H.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), when the CO2 level was comparable to today. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in the model simulations and imply that we must be careful when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.\n\nSimulating Marine Isotope Stage 7 with a coupled climateâice sheet model\n\nDipayan Choudhury, Axel Timmermann, Fabian Schloesser, Malte Heinemann, and David Pollard\n\nClim.

We find glacial inceptions to be more sensitive to orbital variations, whereas glacial terminations need the concerted action of both orbital and CO2 forcings. We highlight the issue of multiple equilibria and an instability due to stationary-wave–topography feedback that can trigger unrealistic North American ice sheet growth.\n\nComparison of past and future simulations of ENSO in CMIP5/PMIP3 and CMIP6/PMIP4 models\n\nJosephine R.

This study compares the strength and spatial pattern of ENSO in a set of climate model simulations in order to explore how ENSO changes in different climates, including past cold glacial climates and past climates with different seasonal cycles, as well as gradual and abrupt future warming cases.\n\nAn empirical evaluation of bias correction methods for palaeoclimate simulations\n\nRobert Beyer, Mario Krapp, and Andrea Manica\n\nClim.

Correcting model biases is therefore essential for creating realistic reconstructions of past climate that can be used, for example, to study long-term ecological dynamics. Here, we evaluated three widely used bias correction methods by means of a global dataset of empirical temperature and precipitation records from the last 125 000 years.\n\nHypersensitivity of glacial summer temperatures in Siberia\n\nPepijn Bakker, Irina Rogozhina, Ute Merkel, and Matthias Prange\n\nClim.

We show that the region is also exceptional in climate models. As a result of subtle changes in model setup, climate models show a strong divergence in simulated glacial summer temperatures that is ultimately driven by changes in the circumpolar atmospheric stationary wave pattern and associated northward heat transport to northeastern Siberia.\n\nDistorted PacificâNorth American teleconnection at the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nYongyun Hu, Yan Xia, Zhengyu Liu, Yuchen Wang, Zhengyao Lu, and Tao Wang\n\nClim.

The results suggest that ENSO would have little direct impact on North American climates at the LGM.\n\nUnderstanding the Australian Monsoon change during the Last Glacial Maximum with a multi-model ensemble\n\nMi Yan, Bin Wang, Jian Liu, Axing Zhu, Liang Ning, and Jian Cao\n\nClim.

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21000 years before present) is known to be dustier. We investigated the impact of plausible dust distribution on the climate of the LGM using an Earth system model and found that the higher dust load results in less cooling over the polar regions. The main finding is that radiative perturbation by the high dust loading does not necessarily cool the surface surrounding Antarctica.\n\nThe role of regional feedbacks in glacial inception on Baffin Island: the interaction of ice flow and meteorology\n\nLeah Birch, Timothy Cronin, and Eli Tziperman\n\nClim. Past, 14, 1441–1462, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1441-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1441-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the regional dynamics at the beginning of the last ice age, using a nested configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a simple ice flow model. We find that ice sheet height causes a negative feedback on continued ice growth by interacting with the atmospheric circulation, causing warming on Baffin Island, and inhibiting the initiation of the last ice age. We conclude that processes at larger scales are needed to overcome the regional warming effect.\n\nQuantifying the influence of the terrestrial biosphere on glacialâinterglacial climate dynamics\n\nTaraka Davies-Barnard, Andy Ridgwell, Joy Singarayer, and Paul Valdes\n\nClim.

This analysis shows that over the whole period the biogeophysical effect (albedo, evapotranspiration) is dominant, and that the biogeochemical impacts may have a lower possible range than typically estimated. This emphasises the temporal reliance of the balance between biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects.\n\nIntra-interglacial climate variability: model simulations of Marine Isotope Stages 1, 5, 11, 13, and 15\n\nRima Rachmayani, Matthias Prange, and Michael Schulz\n\nClim.

Seasonal surface temperature anomalies can be explained by local insolation anomalies induced by the astronomical forcing in most regions and by GHG forcing at high latitudes and early Bruhnes interglacials. However, climate feedbacks may modify the surface temperature response in specific regions.\n\nA GCM comparison of Pleistocene super-interglacial periods in relation to Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Arctic Russia\n\nA.
