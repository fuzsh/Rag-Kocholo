        "text": "A) Oymyakon is not a \"village\", It's a fairly sizeable town.\n\nB) Oymyakon is NOT a tourist attraction. It's just a normal town where people are going about their lives. It mosty lacks tourist infrastructure.\n\nC) Oymyakon is a pretty EXTREME destination, with a climate that (air pressure aside) is routinely compared to MARS. In fact, Martian flimsy athmosphere actually makes its climate better — it's not that cold in winter.\n\nGiven that, it's most emphatically NOT RECOMMENDED for people who just heard about it and wanted to experience the extreme condition. It's a pretty hardcore expedition destination, and for a DIY tourist not knowing what they are doing it can be a literal death sentence. The frozen bodies of _locals_ found in Spring are a pretty mudane occasion. That said, except the closed borders due to COVID travel restrictions, there exactly zero things preventing anyone from visiting it.\n\nEdited: 3 years ago\n\nit sounds like you have never really experienced winter before, so i would strongly suggest you go for a test run first. not sure what would you gain from going to oymyakon other than bragging rights. as long as temperature outside is solidly below 0C, the snow doesn't melt and you can experience 100% of winter attractions.\n\nDo you have adequate clothing? Do u know how much you need for a given weather conditions? It is highly individual, especially for those who have never experienced this kind of weather. I've been to some cold and hot climes throughout my life, but even then I often miss it, if I travel to a destination with a drastically different weather. It's just hard to wrap your mind around it when it's +30C what you need to take with you to feel comfortable at -5C.\n\nif you want to experience a \"real\" winter, you will have a much more memorable experience at one of the northern spots with developed tourist infrastructure. no shortage of those throughtout russia and the rest of the world. when it comes to non-european part of russia, altai mountains, amur river region, tyumen, khanty-mansijsk, baikal, etc. should fit the bill.\n\nto be sure, all of these are very remote areas, but they've beend eveloping tourist infrastructure, so you can spend time there with meaning. you still need to come well prepared to spend time outside in the winter. Even driving from point a to point b on a highway just outside of a town could easily turn deadly in the winter, so you should not take it lightly, but you will have reasonable options how to spend your time there safely and with a lot of fun. i'll try to post below some tidbits to give you a sense of what to expect in some of these regions from my earlier post.\n\nall of the regions above typically have sustained snowy winters. in fact, right now temperatures in many of them may be lower than that in oymyakon a month from now--there's a very cold spell going on right now in much of russia e of ural mountains.\n\njust read a news story today in a major ru newspaper about winter travel in russia. i'll paste below a google translation of a random selection of excerpts. i'm guessing many of the locations mentioned there should be in the aurora borealis zone.\n\nwhile all of these are e of urals, many of them are by no means \"close\" to baikal, but they may be worth the effort of getting there and they should have reasonable connections and infrastructure (e.g., khanty-mansijsk). in some others you may be the only tourist in a thousand-mile radius, which may also be a memory of a lifetime. don't know what's your style of travel and preferences.\n\nin short, just a sampling of leads to explore if any of them further catches ur eye.\n\nRecently, they actively promote regional tourism in Russia. Much of this is aimed at the domestic tourists, yet I'm sure there should be some English-language sites with basic info about the locations and links to regional tourist agencies, where you can get some specific info in English.\n\nhttps://iz.ru/1062243/aleksandra-polianskaia/lvy-zimoi-chem-rossiiskie-regiony-budut-udivliat-turistov-s-dekabria-po-mart\n\nKhanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug Yugra has prepared many winter offers for its guests. According to Vladislava Vishnevskaya, head of the tourism competence center of the Ugra Development Fund, they take into account the tastes, wishes and budgets of different categories of travelers.\n\n“One of the brightest annual event projects is“ Khanty-Mansiysk - New Year's capital of Siberia ”. Tourists will be able to see the only \"Christmas tree residence\" in the country, walk along Chumovaya Street, where instead of houses there are chums, immediately ride dog and reindeer sleds. By the way, the local Santa Claus is called Ishki-Iki, ”Vishnevskaya said.\n\nTourists will be able not only to ride a reindeer sled, but also to learn how to harness a reindeer at a real ethno-camp. Here you can also get acquainted with the culture of the Khanty and Mansi, their traditions, way of life, taste traditional cuisine and even live in a chum.\n\nFor lovers of outdoor activities, Vladislava Vishnevskaya advises snowmobile tours to the mountains of the Subpolar Urals.\n\n“We look forward to a successful upcoming season. Our region receives about 600 thousand tourists a year, of which 1/3 of the volume falls on the winter period, ”says Vishnevskaya.\n\n===============\n\nThey are counting on good results for the winter season in the Tyumen region. “Tyumen is a year-round destination. In winter, tourists are offered numerous entertaining excursions, ecotourism, hunting and fishing, and, of course, relaxation at the thermal springs. We expect to end the current year with a tourist flow of 2 million tourists. At the end of 2019, the region received 3.2 million tourists, ”says Maria Trofimova, head of the Agency for Tourism and Promotion of the Tyumen Region.\n\n================\n\nBig plans for the winter season and Buryatia. According to the Minister of Tourism of the Republic of Buryatia, Maria Badmatsyrenova, 1422 tourists flew there on charters in the summer, which is a very high figure by regional standards. The plans of the tour operator serving the direction are to repeat the successful experience in the summer season-2021 and open a winter charter program to Baikal.\n\n=================\n\n“Mountains, meter-long snow, transparent ice-floes refracting light, waterfalls in the form of giant frozen icicles, blue lakes - such landscapes will not leave anyone indifferent. Tourists love to watch the beauty of Altai from the panoramic windows of rented cottages, and they enjoy walking even more. There are many admirers in Altai and among mountain skiing fans, ”Sazhaeva says.\n\nThe expert says that at the start of the winter season, Altai traditionally organizes mass events, for example, \"Altai wintering\" with the arrival of swans to non-freezing lakes. Celebration of the New Year (Chaga Bayram) in the traditions of the indigenous Altai people is especially popular with tourists.\n\n“It is not possible to make forecasts now, we can only believe that tourists will actively come to Altai in winter. There are grounds for positive hopes: the predictable behavior of tourists who are accustomed to travel in the winter season, preferential transportation and a tourist cashback campaign, ”Sazhaeva argues.\n\n============="
