In/ormation available Substitution of coal for oil is likely to be negligible for at least a decade; as c~/'20 August 1982 even if large-scale interfuel substitution were possible, the Soviet coal was used in this report. industry is poorly equipped to increase production. The USSR's coal output fell to 704 million metric tons in 1981-marking the third consecutive annual decline and the sixth consecutive year in which production has fallen far short of plan. Production in the Soviets' largest coal-producing region (the Donets basin) is falling faster than Moscow anticipated, and production in many other basins is stagnating. Even in basins where output is increasing (such as Ekibastuz), expansion has been much less than planned. Four major problems are hampering the Soviet coal industry: ? Mining conditions in underground operations are deteriorating rapidly. ? The amount of new capacity coming on stream is too small to offset the stagnation or decline of production in older coal basins. ? Shortages of labor and declines in labor productivity are becoming more acute, especially in the basins of the western USSR. ? Development of the large basins east of the Urals is constrained by the poor quality of these deposits, slow research progress on coal enrichment, lack of transportation capacity, and/or unresolved technical problems in transmitting electricity produced at mine-mouth power stations. These problems have boosted the real cost of coal investment and production. During the 1970s, Soviet policymakers held a series of discussions to review the coal industry's problems and the advantages of increased oil and natural gas supplies to the economy. The sharp curtailment in the share of investment available to the coal industry reflects the outcome of these energy policy meetings. Advocates of oil and gas appear to have won with their arguments that the coal industry is not a reliable energy supplier because coal quality is declining and the energy return on investment is much less for coal than for the other two fuels. Soviet plans call for coal production to increase to 775 million tons by 1985-a lower goal than was once planned for 1980, but still impossible to achieve. As a result of further research and the developments of the past two years, we have lowered our estimate of output for 1985 from 775 Confidential SOV 82-10134 September 1982 Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 million tons to a midrange estimate of 720 million tons. Even this estimate must be discounted, because coal output expressed in terms of standard fuel would not increase until the mid-1980s at the earliest due to the continuing decline in energy content of the coal being mined. Practically all of the estimated increase in coal output in the 1980s will come from eastern basins-primarily from expanded operations at Ekibas- tuz in northern Kazakhstan, but also from Kansk-Achinsk in eastern Siberia. Difficulties in transporting Siberian coal (or electricity produced from that coal) to the main energy-consuming areas of European Russia, as well as technical problems in developing a combustion system that can burn it satisfactorily, will delay a major expansion at Siberian basins for at least a decade. In the 1980s, tight coal supplies will sharply curtail Soviet plans to build large coal-fired thermal power plants, undercutting plans to use more coal (and less oil) as fuel for power plants. To limit the use of oil, the Soviets will have to place more reliance on natural gas as fuel for power production. Moreover, we project that Soviet production of coking coal will be 30 to 40 million tons below the level needed to support the target for steel output and other industrial uses (including export commitments) in 1985. The shortfall in domestic production of coking coal will force the Soviets to either: (a) reduce targets for steel production, (b) substantially increase coal imports, (c) reduce coal exports, or-more likely-(d) adopt some combina- tion of these options.

Unless otherwise indicated; the production figures used in this report refer to raw coal. Because of differences~in raw coal quality (heat value) over time or between basins, our comparisons refer to output converted to standard luel units-the amount of coal necessary to obtain the, heat equivalent of 7,000 kilocalories per kilogram or 12,600 BTU per pound.

Output increased by about 3 percent annually, and production goals were consistently met or overfulfilled. Nevertheless, the USSR, like other industrialized countries, was moving away from coal as a primary energy source in favor of oil and natural gas, which burn more efficiently and are easier to transport. As a result, coal's share of Soviet primary energy production dropped from over 50 percent in the mid-1950s to roughly 25 percent in 1980 Small annual production gains continued until 1978, followed by three years of decline. Raw coal output rose to a peak of 724 million tons in 1978 but by 1981 had slipped to 704 million tons. The 1980 output was 90 million tons short of the original target for that year. The USSR's production of coal, expressed as standard fuel,Z fell relatively even more, because average coal quality declined in all major basins and because low-grade Ekibastuz and Kansk-Achinsk coal made up an increasing share of the total output. This development is illustrated by the increasing gap be- tween the output trend lines in figure 1 Figure 1 Soviet Coal ?utput Trends in Terms of Raw Coal and Standard Fuel Equivalent Raw coal Standard fuel With the notable exception of the Ekibastuz basin in northern Kazakhstan, coal production at most of the major Soviet coal basins (shown in figure 2) is now stagnant or in decline. Production in the Donets basin-the country's largest producer-has dropped by 21 million tons since its 1976 peak, to 204 million tons in 1980. Production in the Kuznetsk basin, the country's second largest, is declining as well. Output there fell to 144 million tons in 1980; this was Note: The output trends are based on comparisons at five-year intervals; therefore annual variations are not shown. 5 million tons less than the peak output achieved in 1978 and 18 million tons short of the original 1980 target.

The original plan for 1976-80 called for production to increase at the Donets basin by 10 million tons and at the Kuznetsk basin by 25 million tons, while produc- tion at the Moscow and Karaganda basins was to be stabilized. The plan succeeded only at Karaganda. The Soviets clearly hoped that declines in the aggre- gate production of the older coal basins could be forestalled at least until the late 1980s, when the new coal basins of the eastern USSR would start to play a major role in production The Ekibastuz coal basin is the only large basin where production has increased substantially since 1975. Production rose from 46 million tons in that year to Hard coal(anthracite and bituminous) Railroad 0 500 1000 Kilometers 1 i i~ 0 500 1000 Miles 68 million tons in 1981. In the case of Ekibastuz, however, raw coal production figures must be heavily discounted. Ekibastuz coal has a low heat content (only 60 to 70 percent that of Donets and Kuznetsk coals), and none of it is suitable for coking.

Future coal invest- ment decisions will become more difficult. While outlays per unit of output are rising for both the costly underground mining and the less expensive surface mining, costs at surface mines are rising faster be- cause of growing outlays for support facilities (equip- ment maintenance, for example), housing, and com- munity services (such as schools and stores) Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 At the Donets basin, mining conditions are among the worst in the world.? In terms of mine depth, seam thickness, and methane concentrations, most of the Donets mines would no longer be considered in the category of proved reserves by Western standards. The average depth of the Donets mines was almost 600 meters in 1980-eight times as deep as the average US coal mine-and double the average depth of other Soviet coal mines. The average thickness of Donets coal seams was less than 1 meter in 1980- three-fourths as thick as the seams being worked a decade earlier and about one-half as thick as average coal seams in the United States and West Germany. Moreover, most of the Donets mines have dangerously high concentrations of methane, which require the installation of costly methane drainage equipment. As mining conditions worsen and unit costs of production rise, Soviet planners have found it increasingly diffi- cult to justify additional investment and labor inputs. Similar problems, albeit somewhat less severe, under- lie the declining production at other old Soviet coal basins, such as Kuznetsk, Karaganda, and Moscow. this, the Soviets are attempting to develop technology for improving the quality of the coal prior to ship- ment. In addition, they are working on long-distance electricity transmission systems which could provide industrial areas in European Russia with power gener- ated at mine-mouth stations located east of the Urals. Because there have been no research breakthroughs on these problems and only slow progress since the early 1970s, production at the new basins is now largely confined to supplying regional needs. Major expansion of Ekibastuz and Kansk-Achinsk will be delayed until the technologies are ready for commer- cial use and their construction is funded by major investment. Increased investment in the coal industry is needed not only to develop new coal basins but also to forestall production declines in older basins. Never- theless, the coal industry share of energy investment has been in decline for some years. From the mid- 1960s to 1980, Soviet investments in oil and gas rose by about 300 and 400 percent, respectively, but 25X1 investment in the coal industry rose by only 50 percent. As a result, coal's share of investment in all fossil-fuel industry fell from about 35 percent in the mid-1960s to about 20 percent in 1980 (see table 2). Development of the large, new basins east of the Urals, notably Ekibastuz and Kansk-Achinsk, is con- strained by a number of factors. Although Soviet estimates of reserves in these two basins are large, totaling 120 billion tons, their quality is poor. Both low coal quality and distance from the central indus- trial region make large-scale rail shipment from Eki- bastuz and Kansk-Achinsk uneconomic. Realizing `Although, as shown in the tabulation, the depth of mines in some West European countries exceeds that of the Donets basin, the West European seams are thicker, permitting a greater degree of substitution of machinery for labor at these extreme depths.

The sharp curtailment in the growth of investment available to the coal industry reflects the outcome of key Soviet policy debates of the past two decades concerning the ques- tion of whether primary emphasis should be on coal or on oil and gas.s These debates were inevitably colored by the fact that energy industries generally require large investments that do not provide substantial returns until after many years. Soviet policymakers faced the task of setting priorities among the follow- ing: expanded oil and gas production in Siberia, increased coal production (especially surface mining in eastern regions), rapid growth in nuclear power, and conservation of energy.

Coal advocates held that development of coal would enable savings in oil and natural gas, fuels that could be used more efficiently as exports and chemical feedstocks. They also argued that the Kansk-Achinsk basin was the key to an expanded role for coal. Unlike other basins, Kansk-Achinsk has coal reserves large enough to yield annual production of up to a billion tons, an accessible location along the Trans-Siberian railroad, and the high labor productivity typical of surface mining. In their view, Kansk-Achinsk coal was among the cheapest fuels available. Advocates of oil and gas asserted that the coal industry was not a reliable energy supplier because coal quality was declining and the energy return on investment was much less for coal than for the other two fuels. The proposal was rejected because the Politburo considered the costs to be excessive. Development of Kansk-Achinsk was delayed for 20 to 25 years- unless abreakthrough in transportation technology should occur in the meantime. Thus, in the early 25X1 1970s, adoption of acoal-centered energy strategy was rejected. An intense examination of energy production policy followed, however, in the Academy of Sciences, the State Committee for Science and Technology, and the State Planning Committee (Gosplan), and by 1975 public statements by spokesmen for these organiza- tions showed that a strong consensus had crystallized among top-level energy advisers favoring accelerated development of coal production and advanced technol- ogies for electricity production. After heavy lobbying, this o inion was incor orated in the 1976-80 Plan. 25X1 Implementation of a new policy line on coal was very slow. A fundamental problem was (and is) how best to use the potential energy of Kansk-Achinsk coal. Some of the coal is to be burned in mine-mouth generating plants to supply power for local needs. On the use of Kansk-Achinsk coal to supply energy to other areas, however, differences in opinion have persisted. There have been proposals to build: ? Large mine-mouth generating stations and ultra- high-voltage lines for transmitting the electric pow- er to the European USSR. ? A special broad gauge coal railway from Kansk- Achinsk to central Russia. In 1969-70 the Minister of Coal and energy experts from the Academy of Sciences concluded that in the long term oil and gas would be inadequate to meet energy needs. During the drafting of the 1971-75 Plan, this group reportedly submitted a paper to the Politburo, arguing the case for Kansk-Achinsk devel- opment and the substitution of coal for oil and gas.b ? Facilities for coal liquefaction, gasification, or the production of thermocoal (dried coal) or semicoke (similar to charcoal). The product would be either shipped west or used as an enriched fuel for power generation Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 The controversy over whether coal or, alternatively, oil and gas should be the centerpiece of Soviet energy policy appears to have been resolved, at least for the 1981-85 period. In the current Five-Year Plan, gas industry investment, mostly in West Siberia, is planned to double. It appears that the Soviets now consider increased gas production the answer to grow- ing domestic energy requirements and the need to bolster hard currency earnings. With much larger investments required just to maintain output in the oil industry and to carry out the ambitious nuclear power program, the share of energy investment allocated to coal is likely to continue to decline during the 1980s. The inadequacy of Soviet investment in the coal industry has resulted in more rapid depletion of older mines, especially in the coal basins of the western USSR. Even so, because an increasing share of the coal industry's limited investment is needed to main- tain capacity in existing mines, the commissioning of new capacity has also slowed. Ffgure 3 Labor Productivity in the Soviet Coal Industry, 1960-80 I I I I I 0 1960 65 70 75 80 Attempts To Deal With the Labor Constraint. Short- ages of labor and falling labor productivity have become increasingly serious at both underground and surface mines.' The abrupt falloff in labor productivi- ty since 1975 is illustrated in figure 3. The steady deterioration in the work environment, especially in the older Soviet coal basins, and the austere living conditions in the newer basins in the eastern USSR have made it difficult to find enough miners, despite relatively high wages. To attract additional workers, the average workweek in the Donets basin, for exam- ple, has, been cut since 1976 to 30 hours, compared with 36 to 38 hours in other basins. Shortening the workweek has not increased recruitment, however. Instead, it has forced mine managers to transfer manpower from maintenance to production activities, Note: Productivity of Coal Ministry workers is shown here. The Coal Ministry produces more than 99 percent of Soviet coal. according to Soviet press interviews with mine work- ers and supervisors.e They are more likely to meet short-term output goals in this way, but failure to maintain equipment properly will eventually cut into production. In 1982 Moscow raised the average wage for coal miners by as much as 27 percent, with additional premiums for especially difficult conditions. Nonethe- less, local coal industry officials indicate that without ?

At the same time, annual mine depletion increased to about 15 million tons, up from about 7 million tons a decade earlier. In other words, Soviet data suggest that more than 80 percent of gross annual commissionin snow simply offset mine depletion.' 25X1 The 1981-85 Plan hinges on achieving rapid increases in production at Ekibastuz and small increases at the Donets and Kuznetsk basins. Ekibastuz may perform as planned (substantial increases in production are 25X1 likely there), but there is little chance of an increase at the others. Indeed, we expect out ut in these two basins to fall at least until 1985 25X1 25X1 Labor productivity is also reduced by frequent and lengthy breakdowns of open pit mining machinery and growing shortages of underground mining equip- ment. Millions of tons of output were lost in 1979, for example, because one of the largest excavators at Ekibastuz was out of service for about one-third of the year. shortages o ongwall mining equipment, safety gear, and specially designed underground excavating ma- chinery are hampering production, especially in the Donets and Kuznetsk basins.' Production Outlook Coal production is slated to increase to 728 million tons in 1982. This goal will not be achieved. The industry produced 704 million tons in 1981, and to fulfill the plan would require an increase in produc- tion larger than any the Soviets have achieved in almost 20 years. Data for the first seven months of 1982 indicate that production rose above the de- pressed level of the same period in 1981, ending the decline that began in 1979. Production in 1982 will probably be 710-715 million tons-marking the sev- enth consecutive year that output has fallen far short The 1981-85 Plan calls for coal production to increase to 775 million tons by 1985. If our estimates of annual mine depletion are reasonably accurate, gross annual commissionings of coal-mining capacity would have to increase to about 26 million tons per annum during 1981-85 if that goal is to be achieved. (The increase was 18 million tons per annum during 1976-80.) The Soviets have never commissioned new coal-mining capacity at this rate. Taking into account lagging production in older coal basins and less-than-hoped-for increases at basins in the eastern USSR, we estimate that Soviet coal production could reach only 715-725 million tons by 1985. We expect that the Soviets will accelerate yearly increases in Ekibastuz output, raising total output to between 735 and 760 million tons by 1990. We think 745 million tons is the most likely figure. This estimate for 1990 assumes not only that the Ekibastuz output grows at an increasing rate but also that technical problems involved in transporting Kansk-Achinsk coal are overcome, that boilers adapt- ed to this coal are developed, and that investment in the coal industry is large enough. Soviet failure in any one of these areas would lower our rojection substan- tially. 25X1 All of the gain in raw coal production through 1985, however, will be offset by the continuing decline in the average energy content of the coal being mined.'Z We believe that coal production-expressed as standard \" We define depletion as the amount of operating capacity lost because of mine exhaustion and the decreased roductivity of older i h il m nes t at are st l operating Sotsialisticheskaya industriya, 8 July 1981, p. 2, discusses worker ~= Coal users in the metallurgical and power industries have strongly reactions to the lack of housing and community services at Ekibas- objected to falling coal quality and energy value.

CIA estimates. fuel-will stagnate at about 480 million tons through the mid-1980s, then possibly increase to about 490 million tons by 1990 (table 3). Consequently, coal's contribution to Soviet primary energy production would continue to decline from the 25- ercent share posted in 1980. The key Soviet coal basins during the 1980s will be Donets, Kuznetsk, Ekibastuz, and Kansk-Achinsk. Practically all of the increase in coal output during the decade will come from expanded operations at Ekibastuz, with Kansk-Achinsk providing the rest. After 1985 these two basins will account for 20 to 25 percent of total Soviet coal production (they produced about 14 percent in 1980). Little, if any, increase is likely from other basins during the 1980s.\" The \"The Neryungrinsk mine in the South Yakutiya coal basin will increase output during the 1980s. Most of its output will be exported to Japan under long-term contract and thus will have no significant effect on domestic supply outlook for production at major basins during the 1980s is presented below. I2onets basin. Coal production in the Donets basin, which declined from a peak of 225 million tons in 25X1 1976 to 198 million tons in 1981, will continue to fall during the 1980s. After more than two centuries of mining, the easily exploitable reserves in this basin have been exhausted. We believe that production will drop to 190 million tons by 1985 and to 175-180 million tons by 1990. Mine depletion is running at about 3.5 million tons per annum (up from about 2.2 million tons a decade ago). At this rate, the Soviets would have to put about 18 million tons of new coal-mining capacity on line during 1981-85 just to maintain Donets output at the Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 Confidential present level. Moscow has announced plans to com- mission 20 million tons of new capacity in the basin by 1985, but work on the new mines is lagging. At best, seven to 12 years elapse between the decision to build a new coal mine and that mine's reaching full capaci- ty; therefore none of the planned new Donets mines will come into production until the late 1980s at the earliest. 25X1 On balance, we believe that production in the Donets basin will decline by an average of almost 3 million tons annually during the 1980s. This estimate as- sumes (perhaps optimistically) no further declines in labor productivity. The coal industry probably hopes that the 1982 wage hikes will attract more labor to Donets mines. However, a slowdown in growth of the labor force and poor working conditions of the mines will limit recruiting possibilities The Soviets originally hoped to produce 160-175 million tons in the Kuznetsk basin by 1985, but this goal has been reduced to 154 million tons. We believe, however, that lags in commissioning of new capacity will prevent them from reaching even the revised goal. Production in the Kuznetsk basin will probably hover at about 140 million tons through the mid-1980s and then increase gradually toward the end of the decade as new capacity begins to come on stream Ekibastuz Basin. Soviet plans call for coal production from the Ekibastuz open pit mines to increase from 66 million tons in 1980 to about 84 million tons by 1985 and possibly 124 million tons by 1990. Although production has grown rapidly, Ekibastuz still has serious problems. Mining techniques there are slip- shod even by Soviet standards and the coal-as noted above-is of poor quality.'S 25X1 Kuznetsk Basin. Production in the underground and open pit mines of the Kuznetsk basin has been lagging since 1975 because of labor shortages and delays in commissioning new coal-mining capacity. After reaching 149 million tons a year in 1978, output fell to 144 million tons in 1981-5 million tons below plan. Soviet officials reported that no new coal mines were commissioned in the basin in the last 10 years. This stagnation is due in part to bureaucratic fighting between agricultural and coal-mining interests over the best use of land in the open pit mining area.14 Also clouding the outlook for Kuznetsk production is the failure to improve the productivity of the existing underground mines by modernizing and reconstruct- ing them. 25X1 Fragmentary evidence suggests that mine depletion in the Kuznetsk basin was on the order of 750,000 tons per annum in the 1970s. If this estimate is essentially correct, the Soviets will have to commission about 4 million tons of capacity during 1981-85 merely to prevent further declines in production. This they cannot do. Construction of new mines at the basin was not due to begin until 1984, but work was started in 1982 as concern over production shortfalls mounted. Despite the speedup, the new mines will not produce until after 1985 at the earliest Ekibastuz coal has been blamed for numerous shut- downs of power plants. According to a Pravda article, 46 percent of the basin's output consists of rock or useless debris. The report concluded that a coal washing plant could reduce the debris content to 38 percent-still about double the maximum acceptable standard for coal used in US power plants. Work on a washing plant to clean the coal is under way but has been proceeding slowly; the plant probably will not be completed until the mid-1980s. Even then it will process only about one-fifth of the basin's output. 25X1 Most of the Ekibastuz coal will be used at five coal- fired thermal power plants to be built in Kazakhstan. Each of these plants is to have a capacity of 4,000 megawatts, and together they will consume 85 million tons of coal per year. The first plant is half completed and could become fully operational in the next two years. The second plant is under construction and may be half completed by the mid-1980s. The Soviet goal to complete four of the five planned plants by 1990 is probably unrealistic. Full utilization of the mine- mouth power plants also depends on the completion of 1,150-kilovolt (kV) and 1,500-kV power lines to the 25X1 \" For descriptions of Ekibastuz mining techniques and Soviet comments on Ekibastuz coal quality, see Sotsialisticheskaya indus- triya, 11 May 1980, p. 2, and Current Di est 4f the Soviet Press vol. 31, No. 9, 28 March 1979, p. 11.

However, the 1,150-kV line was not completed during 1976-80 as originally planned, and construction delays since 1980 are likely to postpone electricity transmission to the Urals until after 1985. The 1,500-kV power line is only scheduled for partial construction and testing by 1985; it is unlikel to be used commercially until the late 1980s. If coal production at Ekibastuz were geared only to the needs of the four power plants in Kazakhstan, maximum output of the mines would not be reached until the 1990s. It is more likely, however, that the Soviets will push for production at Ekibastuz substan- tially in excess of the local power plant requirements The long-distance power transmission option depends to help offset the decline in coal production elsewhere. on the Soviets' achieving research breakthroughs on a However, if Ekibastuz coal is not burned locally using combustion system for Kansk-Achinsk coal and an specially designed equipment, then its shipment will ultra-high-voltage (UHV) power transmission system. further burden the rail system and its low qualit will The variable physical and chemical properties of raw reduce power plant performance in other areas~Kansk-Achinsk coal require development of special Kansk-Achinsk Basin. The Soviets decided to proceed with development of the giant Kansk-Achinsk coal basin in eastern Siberia in the late 1970s. But they still have not settled on a long-range development strategy.16 Like Ekibastuz coal, the Kansk-Achinsk coal has a low heat content-65 percent that of Donets coal-and none of it is suitable for metallurgi- cal coke. Soviet scientists, engineers, and economists have devoted much attention over the past 10 to 15 years to developing an economical technology for exploiting Kansk-Achinsk coal. Variable physical and chemical properties make its direct shipment to power plants in the western USSR highly uneconomical; Kansk-Achinsk coal is subject to spontaneous com- bustion in storage and transit and will freeze in cold weather. Proposed solutions have involved two general approaches: ? Extracting the energy content of the coal in power plants near the mines in central Siberia and trans- mitting the power to the western USSR over very- high-capacity lines. 16 Absence of a consistent Kansk-Achinsk development strategy is evident in the recent overview of the power industry edited by A. M. Nekrasov and A. A. Troitskiy, Moscow, 1981, Energetika SSSR v /981-1985 godakh, pp. 120-122.1 ? Upgrading the coal quality through processing in facilities near the mines and transporting the result- ing semicoke, thermocoal, or liquid fuel to the western USSR.\" Present plans for Kansk-Achinsk call for a mix of these two options-two or three mine-mouth power plants are scheduled for completion by 1990, and research and future expansion are to be concentrated on technologies for upgrading coal. This strategy for Kansk-Achinsk development is a considerable depar- ture from plans of the mid-1970s, which envisioned 10 mine-mouth power plants connected by ultra-high- voltage power lines to the European USSR and no 25X1 commercial exploitation of upgraded coal. coal-handling equipment, while the economics of pow- er plant construction specify that the combustion system be very large to avoid the additional costs that constructing and operating multiple smaller plants would entail.'g No satisfactory solution has been found for coping with the equipment-fouling characteristics of Kansk-Achinsk coal, althou hit has been tested in small boilers since 1975. A more important limitation on mine-mouth power generation is the lack of a UHV transmission system. Soviet researchers state that power lines of 2,200 to 2,500 kV are needed to link Kansk-Achinsk power plants to the central industrial regions. No system now in operation in the USSR has power lines with 25X1 125X1 25X1 Robert W. Campbell, 1980, Indiana University Press, Soviet Energy Technologies, pp. 170-184.0 \" We are using the term \"combustion system\" to indicate the many technologies needed to burn coal to generate steam for power generation. These technologies must cope with problems of: (1) transportation of the coal from mines (via railcars, pipelines, large- capacity vehicles, or conveyer belts) to power plants, (2) coal pulverization and grinding, (3) design, construction, and operation of boilers to provide enough steam to run 800-megawatt turbines, (4) formation of slag deposits on boiler heat-exchange surfaces (which reduce heat transfer, lower output, and increase mainte- nance), and (5) air and water pollution caused b ash residue in boilers and smokestacks. l0 25X1 Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 C?nfident?a- voltages higher than 800 kV; 1,150-kV and 1,500-kV systems are only in the commercial demonstration phase of testing. The Soviets have not yet shown more than asmall-batch production capability for the auxiliary equipment that would be required for a 1,500-kV line on which construction began last year. They estimate that this line will require a construction period of six to eight years, plus several more years to achieve normal operation. We estimate, therefore, that a transmission system of 2,000 to 2,500 kV is at least 12 to 15 years (and probably closer to 20 years) away from implementation To accelerate Kansk-Achinsk development, some So- viet planners have proposed sending electricity from mine-mouth power plants to the Urals, some 1,200 kilometers closer to Kansk-Achinsk than the central region. Such proposals are attractive because they could cut development time for Kansk-Achinsk. Pow- er lines of 1,150 and 1,500 kV could be constructed as much as a decade earlier than the higher voltage systems that now are only in early phases of research. However, plans to develop Kansk-Achinsk as a source for Urals electricity ignore the growing power needs of the central region and other planned projects for increasing electricity transfers to the Urals. Accord- ing to existing goals for the 1980s, the Urals would receive major increases in electricity from both Eki- bastuz and Tyumen'. If additional power is transmit- ted from Kansk-Achinsk to the Urals, then the region would not be able to use this electricity without substantial industrial expansion or a major substitu- tion of electric power for other energy sources. Nei- ther of these programs is contemplated in existing plans. 25X1 Conversion of the low-quality Kansk-Achinsk coal into upgraded products-semicoke, thermocoal, or synthetic liquid fuels-would make it transportable over long distances and usable in a variety of boilers. However, processes for drying, pyrolysis, and hydro- genation of Kansk-Achinsk coal are only in the pilot- plant stage of development. These processes must be further perfected in pilot-plant testing, then re-engi- neered for aoommercial-scale facility. Commercial output will become available only after production plants are built and operating. The most advanced of the coal-conversion processes (semicoke production) is still eight to 10 years from commercial operation. The Soviets' difficulties do not end here, however, because the enriched solid or liquid product must be transported thousands of kilometers to the European USSR. Transportation of more than 45 million tons annually by rail would require considerable invest- ment (perhaps as much as 5 billion rubles) in an expanded rail network and coal cars-plus additional operating costs of 100 million rubles per year. Various types of pipeline shipment (slurry lines, capsule pipe- lines)are under study, but large-volume, long-distance transfers are beyond current Soviet capabilities. The slurry pipelines operated to date have been on the 25X1 order of only tens of kilometers. Capsule pipeline transport is undergoing laboratory-scale trials, but Soviet researchers have stated that the technique is being considered only for short distances (5 to 20 kilometers) 25X1 Because of delays already encountered in developing the technologies needed for any of these strategies (to transport Kansk-Achinsk coal, to build boilers adapt- ed to burning it, to transmit UHV power over vast distances), we rule out the possibility that Kansk- Achinsk will be a significant factor in Soviet energy plans until the 1990s at the earliest. We expect, however, that raw coal production in the Kansk- Achinsk basin will increase from 35 million tons in 1980 to about 48 million tons by 1985 and possibly 65 million tons by 1990. Even this modest progress may be slowed if Soviet authorities heed the warnings of environmental specialists that the currently planned25X1 development of Kansk-Achinsk would cause serious air and water pollution problems. ?tdeer ~asans. Little if any increase in production is likely at other Soviet coal basins during the 1980s. The Soviets hope to maintain output at about 50 million tons at Karaganda and 28 million at Pechora. They originally planned to begin phasing out opera- tions at the Moscow coal basin after 1985 and to stop entirely by 1990. The Moscow basin will probably stay in operation longer, however, to help offset declines elsewhere. The 1Veryungrinsk mine in the South Yakutiya coal basin is scheduled to increase production to 12 million tons during the 1980s.

Geological survey and exploration work has located new coal- fields in the Kazakh SSR, the Turgay basin, and along the Baikal-Amur Mainline railroad (BAM). However, these new coal deposits are neither close to consumers in the European USSR nor of high quality. The new coal finds merely assure the Soviets of coal availability in the very long term. Production Costs. Coal production and investment costs have risen steadily in the last two decades, driven upward by deteriorating conditions in under- ground mines and by growing infrastructure outlays for major open pit mines. Both average costs of current production and marginal costs for gaining an additional ton of output grew during the 1960s and 1970s. Average mining costs (including charges on plant and equipment) in the Donets basin were 17.7 rubles per metric ton of standard fuel in 1980- almost double the cost of open pit mining at Kuznetsk and about four times the cost of surface-mined coal at Ekibastuz (table 4). Even after adding transportation charges, the cost of Ekibastuz coal delivered to Mos- cow, for example, is still 15 percent less than the delivered cost of Donets coal. Expansion of the open pit mines of Ekibastuz, Kuz- netsk, and Kansk-Achinsk will be less costly overall than expansion of western basins, by a wide margin. However, the Soviets expect the cost advantage to narrow somewhat during the 1980s, because marginal costs of production at the large open pit mines will rise faster than those at Donets (table 5).

No. 8, 1980, p. 11, and Elektricheskiye stantsii, No. 10, 1979, p. 8. capacity in the underground mines of the Donets, Moscow, and Pechora basins will increase by roughly 30 to 80 percent, mainly because mines will be deeper and coal seams thinner. At Ekibastuz and Kansk- Achinsk open pit mines, however, an additional ton of output will double in cost by the mid-1980s. Although operating costs per ton of coal produced by open pit mines at Ekibastuz are falling as a result of economies of scale, the total cost of new production is rising because the Soviets are adding a major share of infrastructure expense to the direct mining costs. In 1980 an additional ton produced at the basin with the highest costs (Moscow) was 6.5 times the cost of a ton produced at Ekibastuz. An additional ton produced at the highest cost basin of the mid-to-late 1980s (Pecho- ra) will be 4.5 times the cost of new production at Ekibastuz mines. In terms of incremental investment costs, the picture is much the same. Investment per ton of standard fuel (excluding infrastructure) for new mines is 70 to 80 rubles at the Donets basin and 90 to 95 rubles in the Moscow basin, while it is about 12 rubles at Ekibastuz and 10 rubles at Kansk-Achinsk. In terms of the energy return on investment, Ekibastuz or Kansk- Achinsk would supply more energy per ruble invested than any other coal basin. Roughly calculated, the investment now needed to achieve a 1-ton increase in standard fuel at the Donets basin would yield an additional 5 to 7 tons at Ekibastuz or Kansk-Achinsk. 25X1 When outlays for construction of support facilities are added to the direct investment costs of Kansk- Achinskcoal, investment per ton of standard fuel rises by nearly 40 percent-from 10 to nearly 14 rubles. Inclusion of such indirect mining costs reduces the cost advantage of Kansk-Achinsk coal so that the investment needed in the 1980s to achieve a 1-ton increase in standard fuel at the Donets basin would only yield an additional 4 tons at Kansk-Achinsk (figure 4) The advantages of developing the Ekibastuz and Kansk-Achinsk basins are not as clear cut as their relatively low production and investment costs appear to indicate. Other coal basins and other fuels can be more attractive energy investments. The low quality of Ekibastuz and Kansk-Achinsk coals and the high infrastructure costs associated with production in these basins offset to a considerable extent their low extraction costs. In addition, because of limited trans- portation capacity, movement of supplies from these two basins to the industrial heartland of European Russia (including the Urals) is constrained. Even if the technical problems for converting low-quality coal into enriched fuel products and into electricity could be overcome, the additional capital and operating outlays may result in a cost per delivered unit of energy on a par with that of the established basins Although a general discussion of comparative costs for fossil-fuel production is beyond the scope of this paper, we can compare coal extraction costs to a key alternative, Tyumen' natural gas. Soviet data for 1980 show that gas from Tyumen' is roughly equal in production cost to either Ekibastuz or Kansk-Achinsk Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 Figure 4 Estimated Increase in Coal Supply Per Thousand Rubles of Investment Table 6 Fuel Consumption at Electric Power Plants a 1975 Actual 1980 1985 Plan Plan Actual foal 45 46 37 40 Oil 30 28 36 26 Gas 22 22 24 32 Other 3 4 3 2 a Data shown are for fuel consumption at power plants under direct control of the Ministry of Electric Power (about 90 percent of Soviet thermal power stations). production. The production of these two-electric power and steel-accounts for about three-fourths of coal. For equivalent amounts of energy, Tyumen' gas investment requirements are slightly greater than those for either Ekibastuz or Kansk-Achinsk coal, while operating costs for Tyumen' gas recovery are somewhat lower than operating costs at either coal basin. The resulting inconclusive indications for policy have contributed to the continuing tension between advocates of coal development and advocates of other fuels Impact of Coal Shortages Tight supplies of coal will severely undercut Soviet plans to increase the use of coal in the production of electric power during the 1980s. Moreover, coking coal production will become a major bottleneck, sub- stantially limiting the possibility for gains in steel Soviet coal consumption. Edectric Power. Soviet energy policy has recently stressed the reduction of the share of oil in the total amount of fossil fuels consumed at power plants. According to the guidelines of the 1976-80 Plan for the Ministry of Electric Power, the share of oil was to drop and the share of coal was to rise. As shown in table 6, the hope was not fulfilled. Partly because coal supplies were tight, the share of coal in power plant fuel fell, while the share of oil rose substantially. The 1981-85 Plan calls for a marked drop in the oil share. The Soviets hope to replace oil in electric power production by increasing the use of both coal and gas. Because coal production will lag, we believe the share of coal in power plant fuel consumption is more likely to continue to decline. Therefore, the Soviets must boost gas consumption above the already sizable increase targeted for 1985 if power lant oil use is to be limited. Tight coal supply has not stopped the Electric Power Ministry from planning and constructing substantial new capacity in coal-fueled power stations. The Power Ministry has 16 large coal-fired thermal power plants Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 Confidential in the building or planning stages and expects them to be completed during the 1980s. At capacity these 16 plants would require 172 million tons of low-grade raw coal-equivalent to about 86 million tons of standard fuel. In 1980, the last year for which complete data are available, the power industry con- sumed (in terms of standard fuel) 508 million tons of fuel, of which coal provided 189 million tons. If all of the new coal-fired power plants were to come on stream, coal demand in electric power production would increase by nearly half, to 275 million tons per annum in standard fuel units.19 Meeting the increased needs of the power industry- while maintaining allocations to all other industrial sectors and to exports at the 1980 level-would require total Soviet coal production to grow to about 523 million tons of standard fuel by 1985, equivalent to almost 785 million tons of raw coal. As indicated above, we believe that this level of output is beyond Soviet capabilities until the 1990s at the earliest. In this circumstance, the Soviets probably would not push construction of new coal-fired power plants but rather stretch it out to balance coal supply and demand.

(These are illustrated in table 8, with details in the appendix.) 25X1 25X1 If the needs of the electric power industry were to be fully met and if our projection of Soviet coal produc- tion is correct, the availability of coal for all other uses would drop by about 15 percent by 1985 and 30 percent by 1990 compared with 1980. Table 7 shows this projection. Decreased coal supplies would exacer- bate the Soviets' energy problems, given their require- ments for coal in high-priority sectors like iron and steel, nonferrous metals, and petrochemicals, all of which use coking coal as a chemical reactant. Steel. Supplying an adequate quantity and quality of coking coal to the steel industry will also challenge Soviet planners during the 1980s.20 On the basis of \"Some existing coal-fired power plants will be retired during the 1980s (about 5,000 MW of capacity), but planned construction of small coal-fueled plants would more than offset these retirements. Therefore coal demand at power plants would probably be more than 275 construction proceeded as planned. If the Soviets try to meet their planned 1985 crude steel production goal of 168 million tons and also to meet the demand of all other consumers at or near the 1980 levels, including export commitments, they will need nearly 150 million tons of clean coking coal (215 million tons of raw coking coal). As indicated in the table's scenario A, this would require a huge increase in coking coal imports. Given declining coal produc- tion at the Donets and Kuznetsk basins, we estimate that Soviet production of raw coking coal will drop25X1 from about 178 million tons in 1980 to about 170 million tons (119 million tons, clean basis) in 1985 and to 168 million tons in 1990 (table 9) Falling coking coal production will force the Soviets to choose among several alternatives. They could change the pattern of domestic allocations, trim their plans for steel production, substantially increase cok- ing coal imports, or eliminate exports-or, more 25X1 likely, adopt some combination of these options. Al- though we cannot predict the Soviets' choice, we can describe the size of their problem. 25X1 25X1 Approved For Release 2007/01131 :CIA-RDP83T00853R000100170002-6 Table 8 Soviet Requirements for Clean Coking Coal in 1985 Under Alternative Scenarios (A) (B) (C) Increased Cuts for Nonsteel Cuts for Steel Imports Industries Industry Note: Because of rounding, components may not add to the totals shown. All data are expressed as clean coking coal (to convert raw coking coal to clean coking coal, multiply by 0.7). Coking coal imports adjust in scenario A and are fixed at estimated 1980 levels in Band C. The allocations of coking coal to industries other than steel shown in scenarios A and C are estimated from 1980 regional data; they are adjusted downward in B. Steel production adjusts in scenario C. A constant 5-percent transport loss is assumed in shipments to the steel industry. Moscow could cut allocations of coking coal to indus- tries other than steel to help ensure that the needs of ferrous metallurgy are fully satisfied. We estimate that about 40 percent of total Soviet coking coal supply is used in the nonsteel applications, primarily in the production of petrochemicals, nonferrous met- als, and electric power. Of this coal, about two-thirds is burned as boiler fuel and the balance is coked. If coking coal imports were held constant and the requirements of ferrous metallurgy were fully met, allocations of coking coal to other domestic industries in 1985 would have to be held about 25 percent below 1980 levels (scenario B). Soviet sources indicate that such a policy would create supply imbalances in the electric power, petrochemical, and nonferrous metal industries.Z' This option is therefore probably not a z1 M. V. Golitsyn, 1980, Sovetskaya geologiya, No. 4, pp. 11-29, provides information on the importance of coking coal to electric realistic choice; the power industry, which has the 25X1 highest civilian fuel priority, would face about a 3-percent cut in its coal supply Alternatively, if coking coal imports and the needs of all other consumers (including exports) were held at 1980 levels, the supply of clean coking coal available for ferrous metallurgy would drop about 4 percent (from 75 million tons in 1980 to 72 million tons in 1985, as shown in scenario C). Reduced allocations of coking coal would severely reduce pig iron production and thereby wreck Soviet plans to increase crude steel production. We estimate that crude steel production in 1985 with such a reduction in coal allotment would be about 150 million tons. This would be a 2-million- ton increase over production in 1980, but only 10 percent of the planned increase.

The total does not include output at Neryungri in the South Yakutiya coal basin. (Coking coal production there is scheduled to increase to 6 million tons by 1985 and 13 million tons by 1990, but all of it will be exported to Japan under along-term contract and thus will have no effect on domestic supply.)

The Soviets could try to import more coking coal, to help balance supply and demand for that commodity; but such a policy will be unpalatable in a time of increasing hard currency stringencies. To fully meet all needs (scenario A), the Soviets would have to increase annual imports of clean coking coal to over 30 million tons by 1985, compared with annual imports of about 4 million tons in 1980. At current market prices-$60 per metric ton-imports would cost roughly $1.8 billion per year. The Soviets could also trim exports, especially to Eastern Europe, to help offset part of the domestic coal production shortfall. This policy could be imple- mented without causing disruptions in Eastern Europe only as long as increased Polish coal exports were available.

Polish coal production during 1981 was down about 16 25X1 percent from that of 1980, and exports were off 50 percent. Both production and exports rebounded in early 1982, but neither Moscow nor Warsaw can be confident that this trend will be sustained D Some reduction in Soviet sales to hard currency countries is likely, but such reductions cannot help much, because of the comparatively small amounts involved-less than 3 million tons per year. Moreover, nearly all Soviet coking coal exports to hard currency countries are under long-term contracts. Although we cannot rule out the possibility, we doubt that the Soviets would renege on long-term agreements exce t under the most extreme circumstances.

Ferrous metallurgy will account for some 140 million tons of the 1985 requirement for raw coking coal. About 11 percent of the coke consumed in ferrous metallurgy will continue to be used outside the blast furnace for iron ore preparation and other production activities. Our estimate for coking coal use in ferrous metallurgy includes projected consumption of 125 million tons of raw coking coal for the smelting of iron ore. This is based on the following assumptions: ? Production of 1 ton of pig iron requires 0.53 ton of coke. ? Production of 1 ton of coke requires about 2 tons of raw coking coal (a standard conversion). ? The Soviets plan to produce 118 million tons of pig iron in 1985. Thus, the production of 1 ton of pig iron requires 1.06 tons of raw coking coal, and the production of 118 million tons of pig iron requires 125 million tons of raw coking coal. Other industrial uses, together with exports, are esti- mated to continue at the 1980 level of about 70 million tons. Transportation losses are estimated at 5 percent of the total coke demand for use in ferrous metallurgy. Losses for 1985, accordingly, would be 7 million tons.
