        "text": "In recent years, with the rapid growth of economy and sharp rise of motor vehicles in China, the pavement skid resistance in tunnel portals has become increasingly important in cold region. However, the deicing salt, snow removal with machine, and other antiskid measures adopted by highway maintenance division have many limitations. To improve the treatment effect, we proposed a new snow-melting approach employing electric heat tracing, in which heating cables are installed in the structural layer of road. Through the field experiment, laboratory experiment, and numerical investigation, structure type, heating power, and preheating time of the flexible pavement heating system in tunnel portal were systematically analyzed, and advantages of electric heat tracing technology in improving the pavement skid resistance in tunnel portal were also presented. Therefore, such new technology, which offers new snow-melting methods for tunnel portal, bridge, mountainous area, and large longitudinal slope in cold region, has promising prospect for extensive application.\n\nIn order to design a road de-icing device by heating, we consider in the one dimensional setting the optimal control of a parabolic equation with a non linear boundary condition of the Stefan-Boltzmann type. Both the punctual control and the corresponding state are subjected to a unilateral constraint. This control problem models the heating of a road during a winter period to keep the road surface temperature above a given threshold. The one-dimensional modeling used in this work is a first step of the modeling of a road heating device through the circulation of a coolant in a porous layer of the road. We first prove, under realistic physical assumptions, the well-posedness of the direct problem and the optimal control problem. We then perform some numerical experiments using real data obtained from experimental measurements. This models and the corresponding numerical results allow to quantify the minimal energy to be provided to keep the road surface without frost or snow.\n\nIn order to design a road de-icing device by heating, we consider in the one dimensional setting the optimal control of a parabolic equation with a nonlinear boundary condition of the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann type.

To realize optimal salting, a thorough understanding of the snow melting performance of salt is required. This understanding can then be used to develop optimal salt application rates, providing potential reductions in material usage and cost. This paper presents the results of a three-year field study focused on developing optimal salt application rates that apply an understanding of the physical snow melting process on empirical evidence. During the field tests, snow melting performance data, along with maintenance and weather data, were collected in the winter seasons of 2011-2014. With the collected data, a mechanistic-empirical model was developed to determine the recommended application rates for parking lots and sidewalks. The model developed through this study is the first of its kind and is a valuable tool for effective snow and ice control in parking lots and sidewalks. This research also outlines a solid framework to develop optimum application rates for other kind of transportation facilities, such as the road sector.\n\nHydronic snow melting on pavement has been used as an alternative to the conventional chemical method based on chloride salts. In the present work, dynamic snow-melting experiments were performed on a hydronically-heated inclined pavement. The effects of design parameters including the idling time, the fluid temperature and the tilt angle on the snow-melting time were analyzed. Further, the snow thickness profile during the snow-melting process was obtained. Experimental results showed that the symmetry of the snow-melting process around the hydronic pipes was destroyed on the inclined pavement, which is different from the case on the horizontal pavement. Because a part of melted slurry drained out of the snow-melting region, the capillary effect in the snow layer tended to be weakened, thereby prolonging the total snow-melting time. The phenomenon of critical free-area ratio was still found during the snow-melting process on the inclined pavement. The optimization of the layout of hydronic pipes and the idling time is a major approach to improving the performance of practical hydronic snow-melting systems."
