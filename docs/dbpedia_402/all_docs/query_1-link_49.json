        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nLong-term changes of climatic conditions are accompanied by year-to-year variability of temperature and precipitation depending on a periodic change in the prevailing type of atmospheric circulation processes (quasi-biannual cyclic recurrence) (Reference Fallot, Barry and HoogstrateFallot and others, 1997; Reference LokoshenkoPopova and Krenke, 2004); this variability often exceeds the value of trend changes during 10–15 years. In the second half of the 20th century, the increasing temperature trend of the cold period in northern Eurasia due to climatic changes was 0.032˚Ca–1 while the amount of winter precipitation increased on average by 0.8 mma–1 (Reference Popova and KrenkeRazuvaev and others, 1995). The mean values of year-to-year variability during this period were 1.5˚C for temperature and 10mm for precipitation, and maximum values of the anomalies were 3˚C and 30 mm, respectively. The trend and year-to-year temperature and precipitation variability determine correspondingly the distribution and structure of the snow cover (thickness, peculiarities of stratigraphy, intraseasonal distribution, duration, water storage, etc.). The increase of temperature and precipitation amounts in the second half of the 20th century led to an increase of snow-cover thickness by 0.12 cm a–1 (Reference Kominami, Endo, Niwano and UshiodaKrenke and others, 2000) while the average year-to-year thickness variability was 2 cm, and the maximum value of anomalies was 7 cm. The ratios between values of temperature, precipitation amount and snow-cover thickness are close by the order of values and this allows year-to-year anomalies to be considered as an analogue of a possible snow-cover reaction to the existent and future climatic changes.\n\nAnalysis of changes in spatial and temporal distribution of snow cover in northern Eurasia during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 winter periods and modelling of typical stratigraphy columns of snowpack in different physical-geographical regions were carried out on the basis of standard meteorological information from 38 network weather stations. Data on real stratigraphy of snowpacks in different regions were used to verify the modelled columns.\n\nDuring the winter periods (November–March) of 2004/05 and 2005/06, the deviations of average temperature and precipitation values as well as thickness and distribution of snow cover in northern Eurasia from average long-term values for the period 1961–90 were within the limits of standard variability.\n\nFigure 1 shows anomalies of the average winter temperatures (Fig. 1a and b), the amount of winter precipitation (Fig. 1c and d) and the difference between the winter periods under consideration in terms of the temperature and precipitation regimes (Fig. 1e and f ). Most of northern Eurasia was characterized by positive temperature anomalies during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 winter periods compared with the mean long-term values, while the highest anomalies were observed on the Arctic Ocean coast. Areas where no deviations were recorded in these years, or a decrease in the temperature was registered, are situated in the East European Plain, in western and central Siberia and in the Far East; they alternate with vast areas of warming, so it is possible to speak of a certain stability of longitude sectors, within each of which the trends of climatic conditions changes are opposite.\n\nIn the winter of 2004/05 the positive anomalies of the mean winter temperature in the sectors of warming did not exceed 1.5–2.0˚C on average, increasing up to 4–8˚C only in the north of eastern Siberia. In the sectors of temperature decrease, the negative anomalies were about 1˚C, but decreased to 2˚C on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka and Chukchi peninsulas. In winter 2005/06, areas of temperature increase and decrease were in the same regions. However, areas with negative anomalies increased several-fold, the temperature decrease in comparison with the average longterm value was 1.5–2.0˚C, and in central Siberia and in the Far East it reached –2.5˚C. The zones where warming tendencies remained were reduced by nearly half in size, and the average value of positive anomalies decreased to 1.0–1.5˚C. The area of maximum positive anomalies was in the north of eastern Siberia as before, but its extent and the anomalies also decreased.\n\nDuring these winter periods the positive anomalies of the precipitation amount were related to the sectors of warming (European Russia and eastern Siberia), while the negative anomalies were related to the sectors where temperature decreased (the western part of northern Eurasia, central Siberia, Primorye and the Far East). In 2004/05, maximum values of positive anomalies (up to 60 mm) were recorded in the East European Plain and in the northern part of European Russia as well as in the southern Urals and eastern Siberia and on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk; the decrease of the winter precipitation amount in ‘cold’ sectors did not exceed 30–40 mm. In 2005/06 the average decrease of the winter precipitation amount by 30–60mm was recorded in almost the whole territory of northern Eurasia. Positive anomalies were observed only on the coast of the Arctic Ocean and in the piedmont surrounding the mountains of southern Siberia.\n\nIn characterizing year-to-year changes of average winter temperature and precipitation values, it should be noted that the whole winter of 2005/06 was colder and less snowy than the winter of 2004/05. Year-to-year changes were also of a sectoral character: the temperature decreased by 0.5–4.0˚C in European Russia as well as in western and central Siberia, Primorye and the Far East, while the amount of winter precipitation decreased by 25–100 mm. The areas of some rise in temperature and the winter precipitation amount lie on the coast of the Arctic Ocean and in the piedmont of the southern parts of Siberia and the Far East.\n\nThe anomalies of snow-cover thickness compared with the average long-term values and year-to-year changes in the analyzed years are shown in Figure 2. The increase of snow-cover thickness by 10–30cm by the end of the 2004/05 and 2005/06 winter periods was recorded in the middle latitudes of northern Eurasia from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baltic Sea, with some maxima in the sectors of the East European Plain, western and eastern Siberia. The zones where the snow-cover thickness decreased by 10–20cm were situated in the sectors of central Siberia and the Baikal region, and in the northern part of the Far East, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Sea of Okhotsk. In 2005/06 the areas of the zones where the snow-cover thickness decreased were more than twice those observed the previous winter. The distribution of the sectors with positive and negative snow-thickness anomalies and especially a decrease of thickness in the northeastern part of Eurasia, where the most significant warming was recorded, shows that the changes of the snow-cover thickness depend not only on the amount of precipitation but also on temperature. The snow compaction rate grows exponentially with temperature rise (Golubev and Guseva, 1987; Reference KolomytsKominami and others, 1998) and, in particular, this is the cause of the decrease of the snow-cover thickness by 10–30cm in the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean coast, in spite of the precipitation increase by 30–50 mm while the average winter temperature increases by 2.5–4.0˚C.\n\nThe snow-cover stratigraphy develops in the process of snow accumulation and can be characterized by such parameters as the number of snowfalls leading to the formation of horizons, the total duration of periods with precipitation, and the average intensity of snowfalls measured in water equivalent of fresh snow.\n\nFigure 3 shows the number and intensity of snowfalls in 2004/05 and 2005/06 and the year-to-year difference. The maximum quantity (up to 24) and intensity (up to 30 mm) of snowfalls were observed in the zones of intensive cyclonic activity (regions of Kamchatka and the Far East, the northern part of the East European Plain and the southern part of western and central Siberia). In the zones of steady atmospheric processes (regions of central and northeastern Siberia) the number and intensity of snowfalls decreased by half. The number of snowfalls important for stratigraphy can both increase and decrease with year-to-year changes of temperature and precipitation amount; as a result, it is difficult to establish a certain correlation between the number of snowfalls and changes in winter precipitation amount. Thus, in the zone where the amount of precipitation decreased by 20–50mm, the number of snowfalls decreased from 16–18 to 10–12 in western Siberia, whereas in the Ural region the number increased from 12–14 to 20. Nevertheless, it is highly probable that within the zones where temperature and amount of winter precipitation decrease from year to year, snowfalls become less intensive, though the number can increase.\n\nThe formation of heterogeneous texture elements inside the snow cover, such as crusts of different genesis and loose-snow horizons, is associated with the processes developing inside the snow cover during the post-sedimentation period. The most essential transformation of the snowpack with the emergence of secondary foliation is caused by a diffusive mass exchange at a significant (10–20˚C) temperature drop within the snowpack or during recurrent thaws accompanied by the melting of surface snow layers.\n\nIf the temperature gradient within the snow cover is 20 Km–1 or more, an intensive recrystallization of snow and the formation of depth-hoar horizons occur; during a microwave survey this phenomenon is recorded as difference increase in brightness temperature and correlates with thicker snow cover. During the winter periods analyzed, both the amount of precipitation and the snow-cover thickness decreased (by up to 50 mm and by 10–50 cm, respectively) in a part of northern Eurasia in spite of a rise in temperature (by 0.5–2.5˚C) in relation to the average longterm values. The most obvious were year-to-year changes. The winter of 2005/06 in almost the whole of Russian Eurasia, excluding the Arctic Ocean coast and the mountain surrounding Siberia from the south, was characterized by a simultaneous fall in temperature, amount of precipitation and snow-cover thickness as compared with winter 2004/ 05; this led to intensive recrystallization of snow, and resulted in overestimation of snow-cover thickness during the microwave survey.\n\nAreas with an increased number of thaws are usually related to the belt of cyclonic vortex movements and can encompass several sectors. There is a somewhat unexpected regularity in the distribution of thaws: in most cases, thaws in the ‘cold’ sectors occur 1.5–4.0 times more often and are more intensive than in the ‘warm’ sectors (Fig. 4). Thus in the winters of 2004/05 and 2005/06 the thaws occurred more often (up to 8–10 times during the winter period) and were more intensive (≥5 degree-days) in the western and southern regions of the East European Plain, in the south of western and central Siberia, as well as in the Far East and Kamchatka. Under conditions of year-to-year falls in temperature and precipitation, the amount and intensity of thaws increases in ‘warm’ sectors and decreases in ‘cold’ sectors, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of thaws.\n\nThe possible amount of ice crusts within the snowpack and the degree of its regelation transformation can be characterized by such parameters as the ratio between the amount of thaws and the amount of snowfalls as well as the ratio between the total amount of meltwater (in mmcm–2) emerging during thaws and the amount of precipitation (Fig. 5). The amount of meltwater emerging during thaws is estimated on the basis of regularities of snow-cover heat exchange with the atmosphere according to the number of degree-days of positive temperature. If the amount of meltwater exceeded 20% of precipitation and the number of thaws was more than or equal to the number of snowfalls, the snow cover underwent an intensive infiltration recrystallization even to the point of formation of an infiltration layer on the surface of the underlying ground and the flow of a part of meltwater into the ground. Where the meltwater portion was <20%, but the amount of meltwater exceeded the water-retaining capacity of snow equal to 12%, and the ratio between the number of thaws and the number of snowfalls ranged from 1.0 to 0.3, most snow-cover horizons were represented by coarse- or middle-grained freezing snow with ice layers usually on horizon boundaries. If the ratio between the number of thaws and the number of snowfalls is 0.3–0.1 and the meltwater portion ranges from 0.05 to 0.12, the snow cover can contain porous ice crusts, the number of which should correspond to the number of thaws. If the ratio between the number of thaws and the number of snowfalls is less than 0.1 and the meltwater portion is <0.05, the snow cover is made up of horizons of grained snow with rare regelation crusts.\n\nWind crusts are exceptions among heterogeneous texture elements of the snow cover as they are formed during or soon after sedimentation as a result of snow compaction due to drifting. A large number of wind crusts and the compaction of snow cover up to 300–400 kgm–3 are typical of vast open spaces in tundra or steppe zones. In other landscape zones wind crusts do not influence significantly the thermal properties and the integral density of the snow cover. At the same time, changes in thermal properties at the boundaries of wind crusts contribute to the formation of loose-snow horizons inside the snow cover and thus can play a determining role in the processes of emergence of avalanche hazards on mountain slopes."
