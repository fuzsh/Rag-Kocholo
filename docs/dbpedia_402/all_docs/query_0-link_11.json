        "text": "The author has presented functional dependences to determine the distribution of the average annual temperature and annual insolation alog an Earth latitude. Introduction. The Sun illuminates the Earth and, depending on the quantity of heat, its surface temperature sets in: in the equational latitudes, it is the highest, and at the polar latitudes, it is the lowest. Since the parameters of orbital and rotational motion of the Earth evolve, the distribution of solar heat on its surface changes with time. According to the new astronomical theory of climate [1], these changes are such that in some historical periods, at high latitudes, the quantity of heat received in the six summer months is greater than that at the equator now. Then a warm period begins, the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica melt, and the sea level rises. In other times, at high latitudes (from 90 to 55 o), there is less heat received in summer that it is the case at the poles now. The snow fallen in winter does not have time to melt and a glacier is formed, i.e., a glacial period sets in. Water accumulates in the polar glaciers, and the sea level drops. The distribution of heat along an Earth latitude in the said periods can be estimated accurately. Therefore, if we know the dependence of the Earth surface temperature on the quantity of solar heat, it can be used to calculate the Earth surface temperature in other periods too. In the astronomic theory of climate change, consideration is given to the distributions of heat quantities along an Earth latitude during the six summer and winter months and for the whole year. They vary in time intervals of tens of thousands of years. In time intervals counted in years, the Earth insolation does not change, in practice. Temperatures of half-year periods and annual temperatures vary from year to year within fairly narrow limits. Therefore, their mean values for several decades are calculated. In this investigation, consideration is given to the distribution of the Earth average annual temperature along its latitude and the relation of this distribution to the distribution of the annual Earth insolation. There are methods to estimate paleotemperature [2, 3] using various assumptions that do not have such a rigorous quantitative basis as insolation of the Earth. Therefore, a number of investigators have attempted to fi nd the functional dependence of the temperature of the Earth on its insolation. M. Milankovich used the physical laws of radiative heat transfer as a basis for creating a theory that makes it possible to use Earth insolation to determine the distribution of the temperature of the Earth along its latitude during the summer and winter half-year periods and for the whole year [4]. He established that in the case of the atmosphere at rest and a homogeneous Earth surface, the Earth temperature varies from 32.8 o C at the equator to-34.8 o C at the poles. However, it is diffi cult to determine the temperature of the real Earth in such a way. Therefore, attempts have been made to establish a correlational dependence between arrays of data on the observed temperature of the Earth and its insolaiotn [5]. The change in the average annual temperature of the Earth near-surface layer along its latitude is called meridional distribution of zonally averaged temperature, zonally averaged temperature, normal temperature, or midlatitude temperature. In this investigation, this temperature is considered as a mathematical function of the latitude φ; therefore, it is mentioned as a latitude-distributed quantity or midlatitude temperature. Determination of the Earth temperature distribution along its latitude t(φ) is a complex problem complicated by many circumstances [5, 6]. During the past 170 years, investigations aimed at the analysis of temperature rows and determination of the midlatitude Earth temperature have been conducted by many investigators [6-23]. G.
