        "text": "It has been quite a surreal week and half- full of ups and downs and a real spectrum of emotions. In this post I shall talk about the two most memorable parts of the week and a half (not sure as of yet if they’re highlights or lowlights though), ‘Nefteparty’ and ‘Iskra’.\n\n‘Нефтипарты’ (Neftiparty) is a twice yearly student night organised by the University. Despite being told by numerous people that it wouldn’t be a good night, we decided to go.\n\nWe hadn’t been out properly in two weeks, the Hostel was rapidly becoming a prison and cabin fever was definitely starting to set in. Utterly bored of the same, tedious meals (think poor quality sausage, eggs and pasta in a variety of terrible combinations) and the same scenery, we all got far too excited and decided to buy a large bottle of vodka. We may have drank a little too much…\n\nI woke up the next day and had absolutely no memory of the night.\n\nComparing the night to The Hangover is probably quite fair: Numerous people have since added me on V Kontakte (Russian Facebook), rang me and, far more embarrassingly, stopped me in the street and had a chat. Normal behaviour I agree, however, I have absolutely no idea who these people are. One guy asked me when we will go bungee jumping together. Another asked me when am I going to invite him to Manchester.\n\n2pm the day after the party Rob woke me up, ‘What happened?!’, he had no idea either, nor did Charlie or Iona. I woke up to discover a number of strange things. Firstly, for some reason we had decided to cook a pan of tomatoes, yet we didn’t eat it. My coat had a large mud patch on the back, as did my jeans (still no idea how or why). At least I had my coat though… Charlie woke up without his coat and, of course, his memory of when he lost had it. In utter bits the next day he managed to call a taxi (ridiculously hard to do here) and go back to the club. Sadly there was no sign of a jacket and so the ‘mystery of Charlie’s jacket’ continues…\n\nThe picture which, for me, sums up the night is one of Charlie. Dishevelled, vodka stains on his T-shirt and yet utterly triumphant, for some reason he has forbidden me from putting this photo on here…\n\nThe second ‘highlight’ since the last post was ‘Iskra’, a youth club. What went on in the hour whilst we were there still hasn’t sunk in. To set the scene: It’s 7pm Friday night; tired, hungry and grumpy (I get very grumpy when I don’t eat), we arrived at a concrete monolith of Soviet Architecture. About 20 of us sat in a large circle, then a man started playing the guitar – desperately trying not to burst out laughing, I started to become worried that we had joined a Soviet youth movement. I wasn’t too far off the truth.\n\nAfter introducing ourselves and after I, once again, had to play the bloody guitar, we had to talk about how we ‘share energy’. After understanding next to nothing, we had to play charades in groups (see video for Charlie being a hoover LOL). It was an utterly absurd, surreal experience, and I can safely say that I will never go back.\n\nIn other news I think that Charlie is soon going to be enlisted into the Chechen army after deep talks with a soldier from Chechnya. Iona has been ridiculously cultural – she saw two ballets in two days and Rob celebrated his 21st birthday last night – details of which to come in next week’s blog.\n\nThe most disgusting looking meal ever?:\n\nAnd it snowed here too, winter is coming… It’s not normally as grim as this picture I promise.\n\nFirstly, apologies for not posting sooner, the last two weeks have sped by. Far too much has happened to tell everything so I’ll write about the highlights.\n\nFor the past two weekends we have explored the varied nightlife of Tyumen. Our first club was ‘Gorky’, and we happened to go on their ‘dirty dancing’ night, oh boy. I didn’t actually realise that this event was taking place until a bunch of strippers started getting their kit off on stage (see club pictures for proof: http://anrelax.com/files/gallery/2383gorky1509_2012photo/060.jpg ) and yep, they were all pretty bloody disgusting. The actual club was good fun and as we are the only foriengers for 500km we were given free VIP passes and a bottle of disgusting Russian Champagne, lucky us! The highlight of my clubbing experience in Tyumen so far, however, has been watching how Russian men dance (no homo). Comparing them to Gorillas on heat is probably a better description. It seems, unlike in England, the quicker and more vigorously one moves, the better. For example, in one club we went to the Russian man who was jumping the highest and waving his hands the most had the most girls around him. Watch out ladies, I’ll be bringing this type of dancing back to Bristol…\n\nThe Monday after we went to Gorky Club, still slightly hungover, we were taken to see the University ‘Prorektor’- the equivalent of a Deputy Vice-chancellor in UK Universities. The people who were looking after us failed to mention this until 5 minutes beforehand so, looking slightly dishevelled and in some badass tracksuit bottoms, I set off to see one of the most serious men in the world. Not only did we meet half of the University’s management, but a photographer and press officer were there. For half an hour we chatted about the differences in the Universities (eg. in one people study a variety of topics, in the other the only degree is Oil and Gas…) and had our photos taken. 2 days later, we were big news in the University: http://www.tsogu.ru/news/university/obmen-jazykoznaniem/\n\nLife in the Hostel is progressing: I still don’t have proper internet after a month (still using Hussein’s), Iona has a mouse in her room and Charlie is still afraid to ask his Chechen roommate about politics. Our lessons are comprised of grammar, comprehension and pronunciation. According to our teachers our Russian accent is so bad that almost every word is incomprehensible. Hence, during the lessons we spend much of our time shouting one word ten times over with differing stresses, none of which is apparently correct.\n\nThe following weekend we went to an event situated 30 miles from Tyumen, where it turned out we were to perform in front of 200 people. We were part of ‘Interklub’, a University society comprised of foreigners that we were forced to join (the vast majority of which are from Tajikistan…), and as English we were the main attraction. We were all supposed to catch the bus at 9am on the Sunday morning, a time we felt was optimistic to say the least and, surprise surprise, Charlie and I both missed it. Horrifically hungover we managed to arrive at the place 3 hours late.\n\nNevertheless, we took part in the show and came Second. Charlie told a terrible joke that got far too many laughs and I played Wonderwall on the guitar whilst Iona sang. After the show had finished the three of us were mobbed by throngs of girls asking to have their picture taken with us. As Andy Warhol famously said, ‘everyone will have 15 minutes of fame’ – this was ours, and it was bloody awkward.\n\nContinuing the update on how Charlie and I are progressing on our quest for a Russian girlfriend: We have met a lot of girls. Girls here are much more forward and yet much more traditional than girls in England and it has taken us a bit by surprise, however the tricky part is narrowing down. Both Charlie and I currently have a favourite so we shall see. It is a far cry from Bristol…\n\nMoscow proved to be everything we expected. It is a city that never sleeps, never stops drinking and never, ever lets pedestrians cross the road. It is bloody mental. Whilst we were there (2 days, 2 nights) we saw four car crashes and a drunkard get run over. Nearly every road has over six lanes, and cars (mainly the Oligarchi) drive at insanely high speeds. Our two nights spent there were very different: the first was a crazy night out at ‘Propaganda’, a deep-house underground club that only served double shots, we got to bed at 10am. No surprises, the next day was spent part nursing the hangover in Gorky Park and part dreading the internal Russian flight to Tyumen…\n\nMuch to our amazement (disappointment?) the flight was better than most short-haul European flights.\n\nWe had arranged to meet ‘Dmitri’, the head of international students for the University , at arrivals in Tyumen. We arrived, we waited. And waited. After 45mins we managed to find his number and rang him- it turns out that he had ‘forgotten we were arriving’. Not only were we arriving but we didn’t have a clue where we were or where we were going. A great start…\n\nMy first impression of Tyumen was pretty much what I had expected: the majority of buildings are deeply average, some are very modern for the 1990’s and some are literally wooden shacks with corrugated iron roofs (just think Borat.) The shops here are all very similar- on every street, without fail, is a supermarket, a chemist and a shoe shop. All very strange.\n\nOur accomodation is the best available and yet, in our initial room, the taps either didn’t work or wouldn’t turn off, the bed mattresses would have been considered moderately comfortable when Stalin died, and the shower (calling it that is quite the compliment- a tin box on legs is more appropriate) is a surprisingly difficult balancing act at 8 in the morning. After 6 nights in the ‘luxury rooms’ we moved into nicer rooms with fluent Russian speakers: Iona is with ‘Ninja’ from Mongolia, Charlie is with Mohammed from Chechnya (LOL) and I am with H.\n\nOur Russian, however, is progressing nicely, helped by some very enthusiatic conversations with bonkers Ruski’s on the street/ in shops/ in the accomodation. On the plane to Tyumen I read the latest Russian FHM and learnt a number of incrdibly useful words (naked, worthless, trench coat, loo seat and ROFL- sadly yet to use any of them in conversation).\n\nCharlie and I have set each other the challenge of getting a Russian girlfriend (Elena, our lecturer in Bristol, said that it is the best way to learn), I will be updating this challenge on the blog as it progresses. So far?…Not so good. The girls here are very hot indeed, however until we start our lectures getting to meet them is proving difficult. Tonight may help though- it’s our first night out in Tyumen. All very excited to see what the Big T has to offer but after a few people have asked ‘Are you not scared?’ we’re a bit more apprehensive than we would normally for a night out…\n\nI still don’t have internet here properly (Russian bureaucracy) but it will hopefully be sorted soon so I can Skype everyone (Hi mum) and start putting pictures up."
