The interconnectedness of the Arctic is demonstrated when a single change sends ripple effects throughout the marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, socioeconomic, and global systems. Participants at the Arctic Forum discussed how such changes may be \"tipping points\" that represent new, unknown, and potentially irreversible vanguards of arctic and global change.",

Participants at the Arctic Forum discussed how such changes may be \"tipping points\" that represent new, unknown, and potentially irreversible vanguards of arctic and global change.\n\nFocus questions included:\n\nDo changes in the Arctic represent tipping points with global consequences?\n\nHow is climate change affecting economic and social activity?\n\nWhat actions should we take to improve our ability to respond to observed and predicted changes?\n\nThe 2008 Arctic Forum was co-chaired by Martin Miles, Environmental Systems Analysis Research Center in Boulder, Colorado, and Craig Fleener, Gwich'in Council International.\n\nReception at Finnish Embassy\n\nOn Tuesday, 13 May 2008, 7:00 â€“ 9:00 p.m., the opening reception of the 2008 Arctic Forum was held at the Finnish Embassy in Washington DC.\n\n2008 Arctic Forum Volume\n\nThe volume of abstracts from the 2008 Arctic Forum are available below in PDF format."
