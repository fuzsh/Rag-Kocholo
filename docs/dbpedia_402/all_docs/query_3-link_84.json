        "text": "Climate Change Impact on Saudi Arabia Climate change is already having devastating effects in Saudi Arabia. Below are a brief summary of some points: • Climate : significant temperature increases by 2050, ranging from 1.6°C on a low carbon pathway to a concerning 2.6°C on a high carbon pathway. • Sea : predictions of a 1.6°C increase by 2050 under a high-emission scenario. This warming could severely damage marine ecosystems, increase ocean acidification and reduce fish populations by up to 30%. • Costal : Rising sea levels, erosion, and storms due to climate change could put 210,000 people at risk of flooding by 2050. • Economy: The report predicts a potential loss of 12.2% of GDP by 2050 if no action is taken. #sustainability #environment #climatechange #saudiarabia #ksa #ClimateAction #future #economy #GDP #climaterisk\n\nClimate Change Impact on Saudi Arabia Climate change is already having devastating effects in Saudi Arabia.

The simple truth is we cannot. Take a look at these three examples from the past few weeks. Margate, South Africa: An extreme precipitation event saw 250mm fall in 24hrs. Take a look at the path of devastation from the ensuing flash flood https://lnkd.in/dH2KJz7e Russia’s Kurgan and Tyumen regions and swaths of northern Kazakhstan: Extreme heat rapidly melts snow and ice causing a sea of water to force 100’s of thousands of people to abandon their homes. Take a look https://lnkd.in/d3X6Exsx Gulf States: An extreme weather system moved over Oman and the UEA. Here are images from Dubai after receiving 259mm in a day. https://lnkd.in/d7YFg5vx Here is the IPCC’s comments regarding extreme precipitation events: “Precipitation events – including those associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) – increase with GSAT[Global Surface Air Temperature]. For GWLs [Global Warming Levels]_[ >2°C very rare (e.g., 1-in-10 or more years) heavy precipitation events more frequent and more intense over all continents (virtually certain) and nearly all AR6 regions (likely). Likelihood lower at lower GWLs and for less-rare events. At the global scale, intensification of heavy precipitation generally follows Clausius–Clapeyron (about 6–7% per °C of GSAT warming; high confidence). Increase in frequency of heavy precipitation events accelerates with warming, higher for rarer events (high confidence), with approximately a doubling and tripling frequency of 10-year and 50-year events, respectively, at 4°C of global warming.” Our infrastructure is not designed for this new reality. We urgently need to understand the impacts of a world rapidly approaching 1.5°C of warming. Do you know what to expect in your area as we continue to heat? #climateliteracy #climatecrisis #adaptation"
