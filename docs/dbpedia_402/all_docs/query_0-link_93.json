        "text": "Please follow the URL link to view this work: http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/32421/ The ethnohistorical record of the Eurasian steppes points to the long-term predominance of extensive herding economies, associated with low population densities and high levels of geographic mobility. Consequently, investigations of early forms of complex socio-political organization in this region have thus far been primarily focused on Bronze Age (ca. 3500 - 1000 BC) funerary and ceremonial monuments, which presumably served as aggregation points for dispersed populations. When it comes to settlement pattern evidence, researchers claim that traditional models of regional-scale demographic organization, developed in the context of settled societies, cannot be applied to the early complex communities of the steppes. In order to learn more about the underlying social forces that were behind the independent emergence of larger more complex social formations in different world regions, this research focuses on the Sintashta (2050 - 1700 BC) development of southern Russia, which commanded particular attention of archaeologists due to the identification of more than twenty nucleated fortified settlements. Chiefly communities associated with these settlements have been considered odd in comparison to other early complex societies due to their small demographic size, lack of supra-local organization, a fairly short chronological span, and an apparent lack of local antecedents. Regional-scale investigation of the demographic and spatial parameters of Bronze Age communities, conducted in the context of this dissertation, indicates that the fortified settlements were centers of larger districts and therefore represented regional organization that was typical of other chiefdoms. Moreover, supra-local settlement organization and demographic centralization prevailed in the study area for another 300 years after the presumed Sintashta ‘collapse’. Such continuity in material correlates of social complexity took place in the context of substantial demographic growth. These results counter some of the previously held notions about the unusualness of the Sintashta trajectory. The novelty of this research stems from the employment of a survey methodology that relied on systematic sub-surface testing, which has never been utilized in the region before. Perhaps more interestingly, by reaffirming the unusually small demographic scale of Sintashta societies, the results of this dissertation support the notion that small scale societies are capable of complex socio-political organization.\n\nInterpretations of tells have traditionally been linked to questions about the relationships between different types of sites. It is usually assumed that tells had the highest rank and most central role within a regional settlement hierarchy. The tell-building regions in Bronze Age Europe do indeed provide evidence of a particular settlement system, one in which there must have been various kinds of differentiations between the settlements. This much is unambiguous and generally agreed upon. It is not clear, however, what these differences meant. Nor is it obvious how to reach data-informed interpretations of the socio-political as well as economic dimensions of the co-existence of such diverse forms. The differences between various sites would have affected how people lived within them. They would also have informed fundamental aspects of life such as how people related to each other, their sense of generational time, and notions of belonging within a particular place. The core question about the nature of the relationships between these sites remains, however, as challenging and as unanswerable as ever. Sufficiently fine-grained comparative data from the range of sites, from small one-layered households to the densely settled long-duration tells, are still missing from our archaeological ‘data reservoir’.\n\nWhat degree of authority do mobile pastoralists demonstrate during the emergence of complex settlement systems? Archaeology has historically marginalized mobile populations or ignored their contribution to the development of social complexity. This research employs isotopic analyses on human skeletal remains in context with mortuary practice to explain how mobile pastoralists integrated into the emerging complex settlement centers of the Middle Bronze Age (2400-1500BC) South Caucasus in the Sǝrur Valley of Naxçıvan, Azerbaijan. Small, fragmentary groups of mobile pastoralists and trace evidence of small- scale settlements characterize the Middle Bronze Age (2400-1500BC) in the South Caucasus (Smith, 2005a). However, at the Qızqala settlement complex in the Aras River Valley of Naxçıvan, Azerbaijan, the Middle Bronze Age features major political transformations and dense settlements on a scale that precedes traditional chronologies of the emergence of complex settlements in the Late Bronze Age (1500-1150 B.C) (Ristvet et al., 2012; Smith, 2012). Unlike most emergent Near Eastern urban societies, where the development of states and urban centers was predicated on control of agricultural production and sedentism, this region presents a case where the development of sociopolitical complexity relied on a regional population hypothesized as depending primarily on mobile pastoral subsistence (Smith, 2003). While the lack of long-term settlement across most the region supports seasonal and recurrent mobility patterns during the Middle Bronze Age, little is known about the specific modes of mobile subsistence in the earliest fortified complex settlements and how mobility functioned in emergent complex settlement contexts. How the administrative system of the fortress and these mobile populations negotiated space and power is thus a key consideration in unraveling the development of polities in the South Caucasus and expanding on traditional models of social complexity (Arbuckle, 2012; Frachetti, 2012; Honeychurch, 2014; McCorriston, 2013; Porter, 2012; Szuchman, 2009). How do pastoralists engage in mobility in emerging polities? How did changing mortuary practices generate and/or reflect negotiations of mobile people in a new political landscape? This dissertation tests the hypotheses of seasonal highland mobility and dynamic negotiations between mobile and sedentary factions at the Qızqala cemetery to investigate how mobile pastoral mobility, mortuary space construction and funerary ritual changed in this region during the emergence of complex polities. Strontium (87Sr/86Sr), oxygen (δ18O), and carbon (δ13C) isotopic analyses on sequentially sampled human dental enamel provide data on seasonal diet and water sourcing behaviors over dental development to track degree of individual mobility across the regional landscape and shifting dietary habits. The heterogeneity in intra-individual and intra-tooth isotopic values for all isotopes studies supports the hypothesized intensive pastoral mobility that characterizes the Middle Bronze Age populations of the South Caucasus. Results reveal a range of residential and seasonal mobility patterns, which support that the Qızqala population continued reliance on nomadic lifeways even during the emergence of complex settlement. Most individuals fluctuate between lowland and highland zones, which correspond to periods of increased C4 millet consumption, a highland summer crop. This dissertation examines how individual mobility behaviors relate to local and individual expressions of funerary ritual in order to reflect on how pastoralist communities shaped their political landscape through reproducing, transforming, and/or resisting political and economic conditions of power through manipulations of funerary objects and spaces. The location, orientation, style, and elaboration of each individual’s burial context provide data to examine distribution of economic resources available to mobile pastoralists in emerging complex settlement systems. Results suggest mobility patterns closely relate to placement in the cemetery, supporting the importance of mobility in maintaining social cohesion around elite individuals.By taking a bioarchaeological approach that includes details from the human skeleton as well as mortuary archaeology, this dissertation offers an encompassing perspective on interactions between mobile pastoralists and political institutions, elucidating the subject’s perspective on mobility and power that has otherwise been overlooked.\n\nThe earliest historical records of Mesopotamian states of the last centuries of the third millennium BCE document their close interaction with peoples and polities in the hills and mountains of the Zagros and Trans-Tigridian region. The origins and sociopolitical organization of these peoples remain poorly understood largely due to the limited archaeological fieldwork undertaken in this region. However, numerous Mesopotamian administrative records, literary sources, and archaeological evidence for exchange document a long history of a symbiotic, but frequent antagonistic, relationship between the lowland states and highland peoples. Surveys and excavations in the Zagros and Trans-Tigridian region have struggled with identifying the material culture of the Early Bronze Age, giving the impression of a largely abandoned landscape perhaps inhabited by a few pastoral nomadic tribes. New fieldwork at the site of Kani Shaie in Iraqi Kurdistan conducted in the context of this dissertation between 2012-16 and an analysis of the unpublished survey and excavation records of the Mahi Dasht Survey Project undertaken between 1975-78 in Kermanshah, Iran, by L. Levine of the Royal Ontario Museum, has revealed previously unrecognized Early Bronze Age local material culture, especially in the form of indigenous painted ceramic traditions and administrative practices. This allows a reevaluation of the Early Bronze Age in the Zagros region, which demonstrates that the region remained densely inhabited throughout the third millennium BCE albeit with significant shifts in the organization of interregional interaction. Following the collapse of the Late Chalcolithic directional interaction network that had connected distant settlements and allowed the spread of the “Uruk” material culture throughout the fourth millennium BCE, the first centuries of the Early Bronze Age saw the emergence of distinct cultural zones occupying different altitudinal-ecological regions (plains; hills; intermontane valleys). These different societies formed an interaction sphere in which intersocietal exchange of resources, ideas, and perhaps people, occurred periodically at border sites located in the interstitial zones between different landscapes. Finally, in the second half of the third millennium, Mesopotamian states again sought to establish direct contact with distant lands to obtain resources, thereby establishing a new directional network that profoundly changed power relationships and indigenous social structures.\n\nThe Eurasian steppe is a land of sharp contrasts and frequent environmental change that can take place unexpectedly. The variability of the steppe zone fosters a romanticized perception of “nomadic” peoples who make this place home. For many, nomads are \"stoic\" figures that are the product of a long life lived in isolation, always moving as the natural environment dictates. This popular sentiment is in large part due to a historical understanding of the nomad as a peripheral entity that seems to exist outside the sociopolitical process. The flaws in these generalizations minimize the indigenous political process and neglect how local and regional levels of sociopolitical process intersect large-scale forms of sociopolitical organization. With these discrepancies in mind, the current research raises the question: what does community-scale political development look like in its earliest stages among steppe nomads? To address this question, this research explores the “bottom-up” processes at play in the local acceptance, configuration, and enactment of political changes that led to the first regional scale polity of Mongolia–the Xiongnu. Working in the Tarvagatai River valley of north central Mongolia, data from the Early Iron Age period will comprise (1) trends in exchange relationships as revealed by neutron activation analysis of ceramics, (2) trends in settlement patterns, and (3) changes in mortuary practices prior to and during the Xiongnu period. This data will be contextualized by previous archaeological research done in the 1990s in the neighboring Egiin Gol Valley. It is the goal of this project to assess external interactions (represented archaeologically at the household/campsite level) as a way to determine if individual households within a community would have been free to maintain external contacts within a larger regional area or whether such contacts were controlled by a local elite. Out of this research will come a better understanding of the potential capacity for political action by households within a community. A clear understanding of the role of smaller forms of political associations will benefit alternative forms and trajectories of sociopolitical complexity. The distinctiveness of the pastoral nomadic lifeway also presents a fascinating case study in the transformation of political systems and holds promising lessons for other parts of the world (including Mesopotamia, East Africa, and the Central Andes).\n\nIn this exploratory attempt I examine social dynamics in the North Central European Plain, 500–1000 CE. My analysis is limited to archaeological data on spatial distribution and hierarchy of settlements, emergence of defensive settlements, distinction in social statuses and concentration of power, and indirect evidence on group action, cooperation, management of common pool resources, and warfare. The key method employed here to assess changes in social complexity is to identify the density of networks of interdependence. The data suggest that the 500-year period comprised four phases of social change each of various duration and intensity. I especially focus on the characteristics of authority, which I review as socially approved mode of governance that range from participatory polycentric to centralized decisionmaking scheme. In order to explain my findings I introduce a concept that refers to governance and levels of its organization. The rule systems of governments are commonly viewed as structures, whereas governance relates to transient social functions or processes. Rule systems whether formal or informal constitute spheres of authority (SoA) to generate compliance within territorial organizations of different scale. What follows is a conceptualization that affairs of social complexities are governed by a bifurcated arrangement: the centralized and structured government system, and a multicentric system of diverse types of collectivities that constitute a complementary source of authority with actors that cooperate, or sometimes compete, but constantly interact with each other."
