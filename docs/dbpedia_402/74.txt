Brief communication: Testing a portable Bullard-type temperature lance confirms highly spatially heterogeneous sediment temperatures under shallow bodies of water in the Arctic

Frederieke Miesner, William Lambert Cable, Pier Paul Overduin, and Julia Boike

The Cryosphere, 18, 2603–2611, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

The temperature in the sediment below Arctic lakes determines the stability of the permafrost and microbial activity. However, measurements are scarce because of the remoteness. We present a robust and portable device to fill this gap. Test campaigns have demonstrated its utility in a range of environments during winter and summer. The measured temperatures show a great variability within and across locations. The data can be used to validate models and estimate potential emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

Boreal forests in eastern Siberia are an essential component of global climate patterns. We use a physically based model and field measurements to study the interactions between forests, permanently frozen ground and the atmosphere. We find that forests exert a strong control on the thermal state of permafrost through changing snow cover dynamics and altering the surface energy balance, through absorbing most of the incoming solar radiation and suppressing below-canopy turbulent fluxes.

Short summary

Short summary

Ground thermal and moisture data are important indicators of the rapid permafrost changes in the Arctic. To better understand the changes, we need a comprehensive dataset across various sites. We synthesize permafrost-related data in the state of Alaska. It should be a valuable permafrost dataset that is worth maintaining in the future. On a wider level, it also provides a prototype of basic data collection and management for permafrost regions in general.

Short summary

Short summary

This study combines field observations, non-parametric statistical analyses, and thermodynamic modeling to characterize the environmental causes of the spatial variability in soil pore water solute concentrations across two Arctic catchments with varying extents of permafrost. Vegetation type, soil moisture and redox conditions, weathering and hydrologic transport, and mineral solubility were all found to be the primary drivers of the existing spatial variability of some soil pore water solutes.

Short summary

Short summary

Climate warming puts infrastructure built on permafrost at risk of failure. There is a growing need for appropriate model-based risk assessments. Here we present a modelling study and show an exemplary case of how a gravel road in a cold permafrost environment in Alaska might suffer from degrading permafrost under a scenario of intense climate warming. We use this case study to discuss the broader-scale applicability of our model for simulating future Arctic infrastructure failure.

Short summary

Short summary

We propose a new strategy called distributed temperature profiling (DTP) for improving the estimation of soil thermal properties through the use of an unprecedented number of laterally and vertically distributed temperature measurements. We tested a DTP system prototype by moving it sequentially across a discontinuous permafrost environment. The DTP enabled high-resolution identification of near-surface permafrost location and covariability with topography, vegetation, and soil properties.

Detecting the permafrost carbon feedback: talik formation and increased cold-season respiration as precursors to sink-to-source transitions

Nicholas C. Parazoo, Charles D. Koven, David M. Lawrence, Vladimir Romanovsky, and Charles E. Miller

The Cryosphere, 12, 123–144, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-123-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Carbon models suggest the permafrost carbon feedback (soil carbon emissions from permafrost thaw) acts as a slow, unobservable leak. We investigate if permafrost temperature provides an observable signal to detect feedbacks. We find a slow carbon feedback in warm sub-Arctic permafrost soils, but potentially rapid feedback in cold Arctic permafrost. This is surprising since the cold permafrost region is dominated by tundra and underlain by deep, cold permafrost thought impervious to such changes.

Impacts of microtopographic snow redistribution and lateral subsurface processes on hydrologic and thermal states in an Arctic polygonal ground ecosystem: a case study using ELM-3D v1.0

Gautam Bisht, William J. Riley, Haruko M. Wainwright, Baptiste Dafflon, Fengming Yuan, and Vladimir E. Romanovsky

Geosci. Model Dev., 11, 61–76, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-61-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-61-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

The land model integrated into the Energy Exascale Earth System Model was extended to include snow redistribution (SR) and lateral subsurface hydrologic and thermal processes. Simulation results at a polygonal tundra site near Barrow, Alaska, showed that inclusion of SR resulted in a better agreement with observations. Excluding lateral subsurface processes had a small impact on mean states but caused a large overestimation of spatial variability in soil moisture and temperature.

Presence of rapidly degrading permafrost plateaus in south-central Alaska

Benjamin M. Jones, Carson A. Baughman, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, Andrew D. Parsekian, Esther L. Babcock, Eva Stephani, Miriam C. Jones, Guido Grosse, and Edward E. Berg

The Cryosphere, 10, 2673–2692, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2673-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2673-2016, 2016

Short summary

Short summary

We combined field data collection with remote sensing data to document the presence and rapid degradation of permafrost in south-central Alaska during 1950–present. Ground temperature measurements confirmed permafrost presence in the region, but remotely sensed images showed that permafrost plateau extent decreased by 60â¯% since 1950. Better understanding these vulnerable permafrost deposits is important for predicting future permafrost extent across all permafrost regions that are warming.

Modeling the spatiotemporal variability in subsurface thermal regimes across a low-relief polygonal tundra landscape

Short summary

Short summary

Microtopography of the low-gradient polygonal tundra plays a critical role in these ecosystem; however, patterns and drivers are poorly understood. A modeling-based approach was developed in this study to characterize and represent the permafrost soils in the model and simulate the thermal dynamics using a mechanistic high-resolution model. Results shows the ability of the model to simulate the patterns and variability of thermal regimes and improve our understanding of polygonal tundra.

Effect of soil property uncertainties on permafrost thaw projections: a calibration-constrained analysis

Short summary

Short summary

This paper investigates the uncertainty associated with permafrost thaw projections at an intensively monitored site. Permafrost thaw projections are simulated using a thermal hydrology model forced by a worst-case carbon emission scenario. The uncertainties associated with active layer depth, saturation state, thermal regime, and thaw duration are quantified and compared with the effects of climate model uncertainty on permafrost thaw projections.

Short summary

Short summary

Development and calibration of a process-rich model representation of thaw-depth dynamics in Arctic tundra is presented. Improved understanding of polygonal tundra thermal hydrology processes, of thermal conduction, surface and subsurface saturation and snowpack dynamics is gained by using measured field data to calibrate and refine model structure. The refined model is then used identify future data needs and observational studies.

In this study, we apply an electrical method in a high-mountain permafrost terrain in the Italian Alps, where long-term borehole temperature data are available for validation. In particular, we investigate the frequency dependence of the electrical properties for seasonal and annual variations along a 3-year monitoring period. We demonstrate that our method is capable of resolving temporal changes in the thermal state and the ice / water ratio associated with seasonal freeze–thaw processes.

Short summary

Short summary

Snow water equivalent (SWE) is a critical parameter for yearly water supply forecasting and can be calculated by multiplying the snow depth by the snow density. We combined high-spatial-resolution snow depth information with ground-based radar measurements to solve for snow density. Extrapolated density estimates over our study area resolved detailed patterns that agree with the known interactions of snow with wind, terrain, and vegetation and were utilized in the calculation of SWE.

This work addresses snow storage at sports facilities in China. The snow pile at Big Air Shougang (BAS) lost 158.6 m3 snow (6.7 %) during pre-competition and Winter Olympic competition days in winter 2022. There were no significant variations in the snow quality of the snow piles at BAS and the National Biathlon Center except for in the upper part of the snow piles. The 0.7 and 0.4 m thick cover layers protected half the snow height over the summer at Beijing and Chongli, respectively.

Melt ponds are key components of the Arctic sea ice system, yet methods to derive comprehensive pond depth data are missing. We present a shallow-water bathymetry retrieval to derive this elementary pond property at high spatial resolution from aerial images. The retrieval method is presented in a user-friendly way to facilitate replication. Furthermore, we provide pond properties on the MOSAiC expedition floe, giving insights into the three-dimensional pond evolution before and after drainage.

Short summary

Short summary

The results of the surface albedo scheme of a coupled regional climate model were evaluated against airborne and ground-based measurements conducted in the European Arctic in different seasons between 2017 and 2022. We found a seasonally dependent bias between measured and modeled surface albedo for cloudless and cloudy situations. The strongest effects of the albedo model bias on the net irradiance were most apparent in the presence of optically thin clouds.

Short summary

Short summary

Permafrost conditions of the East Siberian Mountains are poorly known because of the severe climate, extreme terrain, and farness and scarcity of data. The ground temperature regime plays a key role in mountainous regions, influencing the environment, slope stability, geomorphological processes and hydrological processes. We present the results of recent examinations of the permafrost thickness variations, temperature regime of thaw zones (taliks) and permafrost of the Suntar-Khayata Range.

Short summary

Short summary

Receding tidewater glaciers are important contributors to sea level rise. Understanding their dynamics and developing models for their attrition has become a matter of global concern. Long-term monitoring of glacier frontal ablation is very difficult. Here we show for the first time that calving fluxes can be estimated from the underwater sounds made by icebergs impacting the sea surface. This development has important application to understanding the response of glaciers to warming oceans.

Brief communication: Measuring and modelling the ice thickness of the Grigoriev ice cap (Kyrgyzstan) and comparison with global datasets

Short summary

Short summary

We performed a field campaign to measure the ice thickness of the Grigoriev ice cap (Central Asia). We interpolated the ice thickness data to obtain an ice thickness distribution representing the state of the ice cap in 2021, with a total volume of ca. 0.4 km3. We then compared our results with global ice thickness datasets composed without our local measurements. The main takeaway is that these datasets do not perform well enough yet for ice caps such as the Grigoriev ice cap.

Short summary

Short summary

There are few detailed studies during the ice decay period, primarily because in situ observations during decay stages face enormous challenges due to safety issues. In the present work, ice monitoring was based on foot, hydrocopter, and boat to get a full time series of the evolution of ice structure and geochemical properties. We argue that the rapid changes in physical and geochemical properties of ice have an important influence on regional climate and the ecological environment under ice.

A new combination of temperature, water pressure and cross-borehole electrical resistivity data is used to investigate ice/water contents in an ice-rich rock glacier. The landform is close to 0Â°C and has locally heterogeneous characteristics, ice/water contents and temperatures. The techniques presented continuously monitor temporal and spatial phase changes to a depth of 12 m and provide the basis for a better understanding of accelerating rock glacier movements and future water availability.

Geophysical measurements of the southernmost microglacier in Europe suggest permafrost occurrence in the Pirin Mountains (Bulgaria)

Short summary

Short summary

The southernmost microglacier in Europe is Snezhnika in the Pirin Mountains, Bulgaria. We use geophysical methods to investigate its thickness and the subsurface structure beneath it. While its size has been well monitored for more than 20 years, information about its thickness is poor. Our results show the presence of ice-rich permafrost near Snezhnika, which was observed in 3 consecutive years. Our results provide important information on the extent and the state of permafrost in Bulgaria.

The Cryosphere, 16, 3181–3197, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3181-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3181-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The Canadian polar shelf has the worldâs thickest old sea ice. Its islands impede ice drift to warmer seas. The first year of data from up-looking sonar viewing this shelfâs ice reveal that thick (> 3 m) old ice remains plentiful here, in contrast to its growing scarcity elsewhere. Arctic circulation continues to pack ice against the islands and during storms to create by ridging the very thick ice found here. This study reveals the importance of ridging to the mass balance of Arctic sea ice.

Theresa Maierhofer, Christian Hauck, Christin Hilbich, Andreas Kemna, and AdriÃ¡n Flores-Orozco

The Cryosphere, 16, 1903–1925, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1903-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1903-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

We extend the application of electrical methods to characterize alpine permafrost using the so-called induced polarization (IP) effect associated with the storage of charges at the interface between liquid and solid phases. We investigate different field protocols to enhance data quality and conclude that with appropriate measurement and processing procedures, the characteristic dependence of the IP response of frozen rocks improves the assessment of thermal state and ice content in permafrost.

Giulia de Pasquale, RÃ©mi Valois, Nicole Schaffer, and Shelley MacDonell

The Cryosphere, 16, 1579–1596, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1579-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1579-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

We presented a geophysical study of one intact and one relict rock glacier in semi-arid Chile. The interpretation of the collected data through different methods identifies geophysical signature differences between the two rock glaciers and characterizes their subsurface structure and composition. This is of great importance because of rock glaciers' relevant role in freshwater production, transfer and storage, especially in this area of increasing human pressure and high rainfall variability.

Rapid and accurate polarimetric radar measurements of ice crystal fabric orientation at the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core site

Tun Jan Young, Carlos MartÃ­n, Poul Christoffersen, Dustin M. Schroeder, Slawek M. Tulaczyk, and Eliza J. Dawson

The Cryosphere, 15, 4117–4133, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4117-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4117-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

If the molecules that make up ice are oriented in specific ways, the ice becomes softer and enhances flow. We use radar to measure the orientation of ice molecules in the top 1400 m of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide. Our results match those from an ice core extracted 10 years ago and conclude that the ice flow has not changed direction for the last 6700 years. Our methods are straightforward and accurate and can be applied in places across ice sheets unsuitable for ice coring.

Ground-penetrating radar imaging reveals glacier's drainage network in 3D

Gregory Church, Andreas Bauder, Melchior Grab, and Hansruedi Maurer

The Cryosphere, 15, 3975–3988, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3975-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3975-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

In this field study, we acquired a 3D radar survey over an active drainage network that transported meltwater through a Swiss glacier. We successfully imaged both englacial and subglacial pathways and were able to confirm long-standing glacier hydrology theory regarding meltwater pathways. The direction of these meltwater pathways directly impacts the glacier's velocity, and therefore more insightful field observations are needed in order to improve our understanding of this complex system.

Short summary

Short summary

A service to enable real-time optimization of grooming and snow-making at ski resorts was developed and evaluated using both GNSS-measured snow depth and spaceborne snow maps derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2. The correlation to the ground observation data was high. Potential sources for the overestimation of the snow depth by the simulations are mainly the impact of snow redistribution by skiers, compensation of uneven terrain, or spontaneous local adaptions of the snow management.

A portable lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box for ice and snow analysis

Helle Astrid KjÃ¦r, Lisa Lolk Hauge, Marius Simonsen, Zurine Yoldi, Iben Koldtoft, Maria HÃ¶rhold, Johannes Freitag, Sepp Kipfstuhl, Anders Svensson, and Paul Vallelonga

Short summary

Short summary

Ice core analyses are often done in home laboratories after costly transport of samples from the field. This limits the amount of sample that can be analysed. Here, we present the first truly field-portable continuous flow analysis (CFA) system for the analysis of impurities in snow, firn and ice cores while still in the field: the lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box. LISA is demonstrated in Greenland to reconstruct accumulation, conductivity and peroxide in snow cores.

Downhole distributed acoustic seismic profiling at Skytrain Ice Rise, West Antarctica

Short summary

Short summary

How ice sheets flowed in the past is written into the structure and texture of the ice sheet itself. Measuring this structure and properties of the ice can help us understand the recent behaviour of the ice sheets. We use a relatively new technique, not previously attempted in Antarctica, to measure the seismic vibrations of a fibre optic cable down a borehole. We demonstrate the potential of this technique to unravel past ice flow and see hints of these complex signals from the ice flow itself.

Implications of surface flooding on airborne estimates of snow depth on sea ice

Anja RÃ¶sel, Sinead Louise Farrell, Vishnu Nandan, Jaqueline Richter-Menge, Gunnar Spreen, Dmitry V. Divine, Adam Steer, Jean-Charles Gallet, and Sebastian Gerland

The Cryosphere, 15, 2819–2833, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2819-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2819-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Recent observations in the Arctic suggest a significant shift towards a snowâice regime caused by deep snow on thin sea ice which may result in a flooding of the snowpack. These conditions cause the brine wicking and saturation of the basal snow layers which lead to a subsequent underestimation of snow depth from snow radar mesurements. As a consequence the calculated sea ice thickness will be biased towards higher values.

Deciphering the evolution of the Bleis Marscha rock glacier (Val d'Err, eastern Switzerland) with cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating, aerial image correlation, and finite element modeling

Dominik Amschwand, Susan Ivy-Ochs, Marcel Frehner, Olivia Steinemann, Marcus Christl, and Christof Vockenhuber

The Cryosphere, 15, 2057–2081, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2057-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2057-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

We reconstruct the Holocene history of the Bleis Marscha rock glacier (eastern Swiss Alps) by determining the surface residence time of boulders via their exposure to cosmic rays. We find that this stack of lobes formed in three phases over the last ~9000 years, controlled by the regional climate. This work adds to our understanding of how these permafrost landforms reacted in the past to climate oscillations and helps to put the current behavior of rock glaciers in a long-term perspective.

First investigation of perennial ice in Winter Wonderland Cave, Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA

Jeffrey S. Munroe

The Cryosphere, 15, 863–881, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-863-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-863-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

This study investigated a cave in Utah (USA) that contains a deposit of perennial ice. Such ice caves are important sources of information about past climate and are currently threatened by rising temperatures. The origin (precipitation), thickness (3 m), and age (several centuries) of the ice were constrained by a variety of methods. Liquid water recently entered the cave for the first time in many years, suggesting a destabilization of the cave environment.

A low-cost method for monitoring snow characteristics at remote field sites

Rosamond J. Tutton and Robert G. Way

The Cryosphere, 15, 1–15, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Snow cover is critical to everyday life for people around the globe. Regular measurements of snow cover usually occur only in larger communities because snow monitoring equipment is costly. In this study, we developed a new low-cost method for estimating snow depth and tested it continuously for 1 year at six remote field locations in coastal Labrador, Canada. Field testing suggests that this new method provides a promising option for researchers in need of a low-cost snow measurement system.

Soil respiration of alpine meadow is controlled by freezeâthaw processes of active layer in the permafrost region of the QinghaiâTibet Plateau

Junfeng Wang, Qingbai Wu, Ziqiang Yuan, and Hojeong Kang

The Cryosphere, 14, 2835–2848, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

The active layer, a buffer between permafrost and the atmosphere, is more sensitive and responds more quickly to climate change. How the freeze–thaw action at different stages regulates carbon emissions is still unclear. We conducted 2-year continuous in situ measurements in an alpine meadow permafrost ecosystem in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and found the freeze–thaw process modified the Rs dynamics differently in different stages. Results suggest great changes in freeze–thaw process patterns.

The RHOSSA campaign: multi-resolution monitoring of the seasonal evolution of the structure and mechanical stability of an alpine snowpack

Neige Calonne, Bettina Richter, Henning LÃ¶we, Cecilia Cetti, Judith ter Schure, Alec Van Herwijnen, Charles Fierz, Matthias Jaggi, and Martin Schneebeli

The Cryosphere, 14, 1829–1848, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1829-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1829-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

During winter 2015–2016, the standard program to monitor the structure and stability of the snowpack at Weissflujoch, Swiss Alps, was complemented by additional measurements to compare between various traditional and newly developed techniques. Snow micro-penetrometer measurements allowed monitoring of the evolution of the snowpack's internal structure at a daily resolution throughout the winter. We show the potential of such high-resolution data for detailed evaluations of snowpack models.

On the Green's function emergence from interferometry of seismic wave fields generated in high-melt glaciers: implications for passive imaging and monitoring

Amandine Sergeant, MaÅgorzata Chmiel, Fabian Lindner, Fabian Walter, Philippe Roux, Julien Chaput, Florent Gimbert, and AurÃ©lien Mordret

The Cryosphere, 14, 1139–1171, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1139-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1139-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

This study explores the capacity to apply ambient noise interferometry to passive seismic recordings in glaciers. Green's function between two seismometers represents the impulse response of the elastic medium. It can be approximated from cross-correlation of random seismic wave fields. For glaciers, its recovery is notoriously difficult due to weak ice seismic scattering. We propose three methods to bridge the gap and show the potential for passive seismic imaging and monitoring of glaciers.

Glacier algae accelerate melt rates on the south-western Greenland Ice Sheet

Short summary

Short summary

Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a major source of uncertainty for sea level rise projections. Ice-darkening due to the growth of algae has been recognized as a potential accelerator of melting. This paper measures and models the algae-driven ice melting and maps the algae over the ice sheet for the first time. We estimate that as much as 13 % total runoff from the south-western GrIS can be attributed to these algae, showing that they must be included in future mass balance models.

Revisiting Austfonna, Svalbard, with potential field methods â a new characterization of the bed topography and its physical properties

Marie-AndrÃ©e Dumais and Marco BrÃ¶nner

The Cryosphere, 14, 183–197, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-183-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-183-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

The subglacial bed of Austfonna is investigated using potential field methods. Airborne gravity data provide a new bed topography, improving on the traditional ground-penetrating radar measurements. Combined with airborne magnetic data, a 2-D forward model reveals the heterogeneity of the subsurface lithology and the physical properties of the bed. Our approach also assesses the presence of softer bed, carbonates and magmatic intrusions under Austfonna, which contribute to subglacial processes.

Measurement of specific surface area of fresh solid precipitation particles in heavy snowfall regions of Japan

Satoru Yamaguchi, Masaaki Ishizaka, Hiroki Motoyoshi, Sent Nakai, Vincent Vionnet, Teruo Aoki, Katsuya Yamashita, Akihiro Hashimoto, and Akihiro Hachikubo

The Cryosphere, 13, 2713–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

The specific surface area (SSA) of solid precipitation particles (PPs) includes detailed information of PP. This work is based on field measurement of SSA of PPs in Nagaoka, the city with the heaviest snowfall in Japan. The values of SSA strongly depend on wind speed (WS) and wet-bulb temperature (Tw) on the ground. An equation to empirically estimate the SSA of fresh PPs with WS and Tw was established and the equation successfully reproduced the fluctuation of SSA in Nagaoka.

The evolution of snow bedforms in the Colorado Front Range and the processes that shape them

Kelly Kochanski, Robert S. Anderson, and Gregory E. Tucker

The Cryosphere, 13, 1267–1281, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1267-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1267-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

Wind-blown snow does not lie flat. It forms dunes, ripples, and anvil-shaped sastrugi. These features ornament much of the snow on Earth and change the snow's effects on polar climates, but they have rarely been studied. We spent three winters watching snow move through the Colorado Front Range and present our findings here, including the first time-lapse videos of snow dune and sastrugi growth.

Supraglacial debris thickness variability: impact on ablation and relation to terrain properties

Lindsey I. Nicholson, Michael McCarthy, Hamish D. Pritchard, and Ian Willis

The Cryosphere, 12, 3719–3734, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3719-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3719-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Ground-penetrating radar of supraglacial debris thickness is used to study local thickness variability. Freshly emergent debris cover appears to have higher skewness and kurtosis than more mature debris covers. Accounting for debris thickness variability in ablation models can result in markedly different ice ablation than is calculated using the mean debris thickness. Slope stability modelling reveals likely locations for locally thin debris with high ablation.

Pore morphology of polar firn around closure revealed by X-ray tomography

Alexis Burr, ClÃ©ment Ballot, Pierre Lhuissier, Patricia Martinerie, Christophe L. Martin, and Armelle Philip

The Cryosphere, 12, 2481–2500, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2481-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2481-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Three-dimensional imaging of the pore network of polar firn from Antarctica was realized in order to relate the morphological evolution of pores with their progressive closure with depth. Evaluating the closed porosity was found to be very dependent on the size of samples and image reconstructions. A connectivity index, which is a parameter less dependent on such issues, was proposed and proved to accurately predict the close-off depths and densities of two polar sites.

Estimating the snow water equivalent on a glacierized high elevation site (Forni Glacier, Italy)

Antonella Senese, Maurizio Maugeri, Eraldo Meraldi, Gian Pietro Verza, Roberto Sergio Azzoni, Chiara Compostella, and Guglielmina Diolaiuti

The Cryosphere, 12, 1293–1306, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1293-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

We present and compare 11 years of snow data measured by an automatic weather station and corroborated by data from field campaigns on the Forni Glacier in Italy. The methodology we present is interesting for remote locations such as glaciers or high alpine regions, as it makes it possible to estimate the total snow water equivalent (SWE) using a relatively inexpensive, low-power, low-maintenance, and reliable instrument such as the sonic ranger.

Snowmobile impacts on snowpack physical and mechanical properties

Steven R. Fassnacht, Jared T. Heath, Niah B. H. Venable, and Kelly J. Elder

The Cryosphere, 12, 1121–1135, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1121-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1121-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

We conducted a series of experiments to determine how snowpack properties change with varying snowmobile traffic. Experiments were initiated at a shallow (30 cm) and deep (120 cm) snow depth at two locations. Except for initiation at 120 cm, snowmobiles significantly changed the density, hardness, ram resistance, and basal layer crystal size. Temperature was not changed. A density change model was developed and tested. The results inform management of lands with snowmobile traffic.

In situ nuclear magnetic resonance response of permafrost and active layer soil in boreal and tundra ecosystems

M. Andy Kass, Trevor P. Irons, Burke J. Minsley, Neal J. Pastick, Dana R. N. Brown, and Bruce K. Wylie

The Cryosphere, 11, 2943–2955, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2943-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2943-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Geophysical methods have wide applications to permafrost studies. We show that borehole nuclear magnetic resonance is a valuable geophysical tool to rapidly characterize the liquid water content and unfrozen pore space in warm permafrost through simulation and field study. This technique is also sensitive to the ice nucleation process in situ. This method, which is applicable in a variety of soil types, can be used for single observations or for time-lapse monitoring of permafrost changes.

Climate change threatens archaeologically significant ice patches: insights into their age, internal structure, mass balance and climate sensitivity

Rune Strand ÃdegÃ¥rd, Atle Nesje, Ketil Isaksen, Liss Marie Andreassen, Trond Eiken, Margit Schwikowski, and Chiara Uglietti

The Cryosphere, 11, 17–32, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-17-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-17-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Despite numerous spectacular archaeological discoveries worldwide related to melting ice, governing processes related to ice patch development are still largely unexplored. We present new results from Jotunheimen in central southern Norway showing that the Juvfonne ice patch has existed continuously since ca. 7600 cal years BP. This is the oldest dating of ice in mainland Norway. Moss mats along the margin of Juvfonne in 2014 were covered by the expanding ice patch about 2000 years ago.
