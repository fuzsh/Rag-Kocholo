        "text": "Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin were political theorists of the first rank whose impact on the study of political science in North America has been profound. A study of their writings is one of the most expeditious ways to explore the core of political science; comparing and contrasting the positions both theorists have taken in assessing that core provides a comprehensive appreciation of the main options of the Western tradition.\n\nIn fifty-three recently discovered letters, Strauss and Voegelin explore the nature of their similarities and differences, offering trenchant observations about one another's work, about the state of the discipline, and about the influences working on them. The correspondence fleshes out many assumptions made in their published writings, often with a frankness and directness that removes all vestiges of ambiguity. Included with the correspondence are four pivotal re-published essays—\"Jerusalem and Athens: Some Preliminary Reflections\" (Strauss), \"The Gospel and Culture\" (Voegelin), \"Immortality: Experience and Symbol\" (Voegelin), and \"The Mutual Influence of Theology and Philosophy\" (Strauss)—and commentaries by James L. Wiser, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Stanley Rosen, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Timothy Fuller, Ellis Sandoz, Thomas L. Pangle, and David Walsh.\n\nPeter C. Emberley is Associate Professor of Political Science at Carleton University and editor of By Loving our Own: George Grant and the Legacy of Lament for a Nation (1990).\n\nBarry Cooper is Professor of Political Science at the University of Calgary and author of several books, including The End of History (1984) and Action into Nature: An Essay on the Meaning of Technology (1991)."
