        "text": "The History of Political Ideas by the German-American philosopher Eric Voegelin (1901-1985) is a monumental work of around 2,600 pages. It remained unpublished during his lifetime, and it came to light through the American edition (1997-1999) and the now completed Portuguese edition (2012-2018). Being the author of the first world edition of an abridged version of the History of Political Ideas ; the translator of the first three volumes of the 2012-2018 Portuguese edition; and the author of The civil philosophy of Eric Voegelin (my 1990 Ph. D diss.) I consider that the History of Political Ideas challenges the present climate of opinion: it subverts the dominant corrosive forces of moral relativism, intolerant neo-positivism, end-of-history obsessions, postmodernist deconstructions, agnosticism, nihilism, new age religions, and the all-pervasive ideology of money. Eric Voegelin achieves all this leading his readers from Antiquity to Modern Age. His monumental work begins with the “...\n\nThe article briefly presents Eric Voegelin, the Austrian-American political philosopher who is not well known in Poland. Voegelin radically questioned the methods and practices used in modern social sciences. The great development of exact sciences in the time of the scientific revolution led to a belief that their methods could be successfully employed social sciences. In due time, this view eliminated other methods and acknowledges experience, inductive reasoning and mathematical logics as the only acceptable methods in scholarly research. Positivism made the methods the only criteria of scholarship. For Voegelin science requires methods that are adequate to the nature of scientific examination. Individual wants to know and acquires knowledge not as an external observer but as a participant, through internal consciousness and meditation. History is a process of “attunement” of human cognition to the existing order of existence. The consciousness of the transcendent source of existence has always been in man and woman. At first cosmological civilization reflects this order. A leap in being towards the source of being takes place in Ancient Israel and finishes in Christianity. This leap makes individuals abandon their myth and begin life in history. Science is to help in the attunement to the order of existence and its transcendent source.\n\nIndependence Lost: Lives on the Edge of the American Revolution. By Kathleen DuVal.
