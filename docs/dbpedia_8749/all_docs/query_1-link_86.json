        "meta_description": "Originally published in German in 1966, Anamnesis was first available in English in 1978. The translated version includes Voegelin's \"Reason: The Classic Experience,\" as well as a new first chapter that was written by Voegelin especially for this translation. Anamnesis pulls together those materials that focus most sharply upon the development of Eric Voegelin's philosophy of consciousness. Voegelin is considered one of the most influential and profound philosophers of our time and has had an enormous impact on contemporary intellectual life.",
