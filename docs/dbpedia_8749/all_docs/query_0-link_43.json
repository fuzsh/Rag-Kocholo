        "text": "As history and semiotic begin their formal rapprochement, evidenced by numerous articles in Semiotics during the 1980s on semiotics and history -- including special issues in 1982, 1984, and one planned for 1989 -- and a session on history and semiotics at the American Historical Association Convention in 1987, it is worthwhile to call attention to the immensely learned works of the Austrian- American thinker Eric Voegelin (1901–1985). To call him a philosopher, historian, or political scientist is to diminish his stature: his thought linked these disciplines much as semiotics claims to offer a methodology unifying the realms of knowledge. Moreover, Voegelin’s lifelong concern with the symbols through which societies have understood themselves and through which thinkers have sought to interpret human experience foreshadowed modern semiotics. His enquiries were in part inspired by his early encounter with the works of Charles Peirce, William James, George Santayana, and John Dewey - the last of whom was his teacher at Columbia in the 1920s. I therefore treat Voegelin here as a semiotician of history, and invite scholars in both disciplines to benefit from his exciting, if by no means unexceptionable, approach to history as the creation, questioning, and development of certain symbolisms to represent the fundamentals of human experience."
