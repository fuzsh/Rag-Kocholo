        "text": "Our Western Predicament\n\nA Voegelinian Perspective on Modernity\n\nBy\n\nEllis Sandoz\n\nMoyse Distinguished Professor Political Science & Director, Eric Voegelin\n\nInstitute, Louisiana State University\n\nPrepared for Delivery at the Annual Meeting of the Philadelphia Society,\n\nApril 24, 1999, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe \"iron curtain of the future\" (as Arnold J. Toynbee called it) that\n\nabsolutely bars specific understanding of the human future blocks any\n\nattempt to forecast the twenty-first century. In fact, one of the\n\nprinciples of Eric Voegelin’s thought, and distinguishing marks of a\n\nphilosophy of history and politics-as opposed to an ideological\n\ndeformation of historical reality-, is a recognition of the deepening\n\nmystery of human existence as it opens toward the horizon of the unknown\n\nand unknowable future. Not only don’t we know what may happen in the next\n\nhundred years, we don’t even know what may happen next week or this\n\nafternoon. Moreover, to ask a philosopher’s appraisal of a question is to\n\nrisk transformation of the debate.\n\nThus, to declare (or to pretend to know) what the future holds is a\n\nspeculative derailment into ideology or modern gnosticism–the very Gnosis\n\nitself. The sole exception is genuine eschatological visions of the\n\neternal human destiny known in faith, hope, and love, and imparted through\n\nrevelatory experiences, a destiny to be achieved in a transcendental\n\nbeyond of present existence. The attempt to effectuate fulfillment in the\n\nhere and now of history, through the transformation of man and the world\n\nin time, lies at the very heart of radical modern rebellion, deformation\n\nof reality, and our Western predicament-and not the West’s only!\n\nOn the other hand, as some of you may remember since he participated in\n\nPhiladelphia Society meetings himself on at least three occasions and\n\nwrote widely on the subject, much of Voegelin’s work as a philosopher and\n\npolitical scientist addressed the plight of contemporary mankind. Thus,\n\nhis analysis of the present predicament of Western civilization and of\n\nhumanity more generally may shed its flickering light on the future. A\n\ngreat part of this work of decades revolved around Voegelin’s attempt (a)\n\nto understand the present crisis of the West, (b) to diagnose its most\n\nvirulent aspects, and (c) to find remedies for present conditions before\n\nthe rampant epidemic of radical modernity and social amnesia proved lethal\n\nfor civilization. I shall limit my remarks this morning mainly to these\n\nthemes, then conclude with some comments on the human prospect. In\n\ngeneral, I should say that Voegelin’s outlook is often rather like that of\n\nphysician facing a gravely ill patient, one whose chances of full recovery\n\nare dim at best. I, of course, want to be more hopeful and so remind you\n\nthat it was a famous economist (representative of the dismal science) who\n\nremarked that in the long run we’re all dead! More than once, Voegelin\n\nexplicitly called for personal resistance to present evils, and he sounded\n\nthe alarm with life and death urgency that action based on understanding\n\nis needed if catastrophe is to be averted. On one occasion, he went so far\n\nas to evoke the words of the Watchman in Ezekiel in giving warning of\n\nimpending disaster. Thus, while the situation is dire, our human liberty\n\nis meaningful and the propaganda of historical determinism is just that\n\nand is flatly to be rejected.\n\nI. Advancing and Declining at the Same Time: the Modern Crisis\n\nIn his best known book, The New Science of Politics (1952), Voegelin\n\nponders the question of how it is possible for society to advance and\n\ndecline at one and the same time. The experience of progress is all around\n\nus, yet there is the pervasive sense that all is not well: why? His answer\n\nis to notice that human reality is not monolithic but highly complex and,\n\nlike the single human personality, a mixed bag-a stratified reality that\n\nranges from the material, sentient, and biological through a consciousness\n\nthat is uniquely intellectual and spiritual. Somewhat like the\n\nstereotypical football player who is a physical specimen of breathtaking\n\nperfection but can’t read, modern society excels in science, technology,\n\nand the abundant life but has allowed its philosophical and spiritual life\n\nto atrophy. The nub of the disorder is a crisis of the mind and spirit.\n\nIts cardinal attribute is a closure against the divine ground of being, a\n\nforgetfulness of the God of our fathers, one assuaged only by the hollow\n\nmen who cry up Autonomous Man and beckon us to bow down before this Golden\n\nCalf of radical modernity. This set of circumstances Voegelin analyzes\n\nwith an array of terms as a affliction of the soul, or pneumopathology,\n\nthat includes spiritual amnesia, intramundane religiousness, diseased\n\nmetastatic faith (magic)-thus as a cancer in the souls of contemporary\n\nhuman beings and our deculturated societies. While far from being some\n\nkind of monistic explanation of the crisis in which we live, the\n\ndespiritualization of existence on one side– and the dogmatomachy or\n\nwarfare among contending dogmatic religions and ideologies on the other\n\nside-are leading symptoms of the present crisis. It so disorients and\n\ndegrades the splendor of civilizational achievement by natural science as\n\nto make, not the conquest of nature through human ingenuity for the good\n\nof all, but the enormity of the Gulag and of Auschwitz the great monument\n\nof our epoch.\n\nII. Stages in Disintegration of the West: Virulent Modernity\n\nHow did all of this come about, one may ask? Voegelin always stresses that\n\nthe radical epidemic of ideological or Gnostic modernity is a growth\n\nwithin modern human existence and not by any means the whole of it; that\n\nthere are reserves of opposition and resistance to the ideological\n\nperversion of reality that continue in train with the foundations of our\n\ncivilization in the homonoia or like-mindedness of the biblical faith\n\ninstitutionalized in the Mediterranean world of Judaism, Christianity,\n\nGreek philosophy, Roman law, and nurtured in the great medieval synthesis.\n\nThese civilizing forces were brought together as a triumph of mind and\n\nspirit that glorified the truth of being enduringly institutionalized as a\n\ncommunity of church and empire before forces of dissolution powerfully\n\nemerged, and it began to unravel. To be sure, the unraveling remains a\n\nwork in progress, one incomplete to this day. Voegelin identifies the\n\nprincipal historical stages of crisis in terms of the Reformation, the\n\nFrench Revolution, and the radical third wave of especially the German\n\n(Nazi), Russian (Bolshevik), and Italian (fascist) revolutions of this\n\ncentury. Islands of opposition to nihilism and virulent destructiveness\n\npersist and continue to exert influence into the present-the Philadelphia\n\nSociety among them-and especially the British and American institutional\n\norders, founded in comparatively sound philosophical ground and\n\ntraditionally ingrained political habits, are identified as stabilizing\n\nforces in modern existence. One is reminded of Edmund Burke’s observation\n\nin surveying the French Revolution that two things are essential for a\n\npolitics of moderation: religion and gentlemen.\n\nWhat of the forces of virulent modernity? Even the most effective agents\n\nof destruction ape the truth and forms of sound existence. Thus, everyone\n\nwill remember the catchy cry \"Don’t let them immanentize the Eschaton!\"\n\nSome of you may still own campaign buttons and sweatshirts with this\n\ndefiant slogan emblemized thereon. The eschaton (meaning the end of the\n\nworld) designates the congeries of Christian faith symbols of final things\n\nsuch as Christ’s Second Coming, Last Judgment, Eternal salvation or\n\nBeatitude and punishment, end of the age, and the Millennium. Behind the\n\nslogan lies Voegelin’s argument that the various ideologies (or Gnostic\n\nvariants, in his words) are ersatz religions for persons too weak for\n\nfaith. Such dogmatic creeds seize upon one or another aspect of the\n\nChristian eschatological faith symbolism and apply it to the desired goal\n\nof revolutionary transformation of the world so as to achieve, in one form\n\nor another, perfection in the here and now. They run the gamut from the\n\nfairly benign secularism of the liberals to the radical immanentism of\n\nMarx. The life of faith-experienced in loving response to divine grace, as\n\nthe pilgrim’s progress toward beatitude, union with God, and the hope for\n\nfulfillment of life in the bliss of eternal salvation-, is replaced by the\n\nideologue’s desire for worldly fulfillment in some sort of heaven on\n\nearth: the transformation of men and the world through revolutionary\n\naction is embraced and assumed to lie within the scope of human control.\n\nVoegelin identifies progressivism, utopianism, and revolutionary activism\n\nas the three basic types: the first stresses the movement toward\n\nperfection without clarity about the goal itself; the second stresses the\n\ngoal without a clear notion of how it might be attained; and the third (as\n\nin Marxism) combines both the teleological and axiological elements into a\n\ncomprehensive assault on reality that evokes the superman and so-called\n\nRealm of Freedom. (NSP, 119-21) As Ludwig Feuerbach had exclaimed, the\n\nhighest being for man is Man himself; to which Marx himself added, all I\n\nneed is new men! Henri de Lubac wrote of this in terms of \"the drama of\n\natheist humanism.\"\n\nAt the end of the Gnostic-ideological century one would suppose human\n\nbeings would by now have had quite enough of this sort of thing. After\n\nall, Voegelin gave the detailed diagnosis nearly a half-century ago, and\n\neven Time magazine was sufficiently impressed as to devote its thirtieth\n\nanniversary issue to it in an essay by Max Ways entitled \"Journalism and\n\nJoachim’s Children.\" Since then the powerful voices of Aleksandr\n\nSolzhenitsyn and Václav Havel have reiterated and elaborated in their\n\ninimitable ways much the same diagnosis of the age Voegelin had presented\n\nphilosophically. Truth derails into the Lie systematically elaborated:\n\nphilosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is\n\nto change it (Marx)! The one true reality is deformed into Second\n\nRealities of dreamworld fascination, and the dream becomes reality by\n\ndefinition through psychological mass management and socially enforced\n\ncoercion of the comprehensive kind we call totalitarian. The great\n\nhistorical theophanies are eclipsed by the egophany of the libidinous\n\nself. Mein Kampf supplants the Bible on the altar, the Word of Marx and of\n\nLenin forms the new Koran of the party faithful, and the spiritually\n\nhungry file endlessly past the mummified remains of the great vozhd Lenin.\n\nI use the present tense. To the warfare or dogmatomachy among partisans of\n\ncontending ideologies must be added the ancient but persistent old-style\n\nfundamentalist dogmatomachy of ethnic-religious fanatics that continues as\n\na curse to day to day existence in the Middle East, Balkans, Northern\n\nIreland, China, Africa, and India.\n\nSpiritual and intellectual disintegration proceeds not only through the\n\ndestruction of transcendentalism in religion but also through the\n\ndestruction of philosophy, in a process Voegelin sees beginning as early\n\nas the generation after Aristotle. To be succinct and mindful of recent\n\ntimes, Voegelin argues that all good philosophy is based on common sense:\n\nAristotle is a good philosopher and Hegel is not, and one must be very\n\nhighly educated indeed to misunderstand (and deform) reality as thoroughly\n\nas did Marx and Nietzsche. Ideology (modern gnosticism in its several\n\nvariants) operates with the truncated \"reason\" of the Enlightenment,\n\nrather than with the differentiated Nous of Plato and Aristotle. It is\n\nintrinsically irrational because of that: as Alfred North Whitehead\n\nremarked the philosophes were not philosophers! Philosophers start from\n\ncommon sense and seek to illuminate reality through noetic inquiry into\n\nthe truth of being, unto its origins in the eminent Being of the divine\n\nGround. The philosophes (and their soul-mates: the sophists in antiquity,\n\nthe ideologues today) so deploy instrumental reason as to obscure rather\n\nthan illuminate reality and ruthlessly decapitate eminent Being, in\n\nintentional closure against truth. Only the outlines can be sketched.\n\nClosure is effected by several means, including: (1) the reduction of\n\n\"reason\" to analysis or its instrumental, calculative aspect thereby\n\nleaving out as irrational the decisive noetic (intuitive) aspect through\n\nwhich first principles are grasped; (2) the procedure or trick of\n\nphilosophizing in closed \"systems\" where the errors can be concealed in\n\npremises that routinely go unexamined as postulates or assumptions; and\n\n(3) in expressly or implicitly prohibiting the asking of questions. The\n\nsystem blinds the mind to any inquiry into the truth of reality not\n\nanalytically comprehended in the premises of the system itself; and the\n\nprohibition against asking pertinent questions about these basic premises\n\n(regarding the nature of man and source of being itself, for instance)\n\nslams the door shut: Denke nicht frage mich nicht! Marx’s formulation can\n\nhardly be improved upon: Don’t think, don’t ask me! If you insist on\n\nquestioning anyway, bad things may happen to you-especially if you should\n\nlive in some politically correct paradise.\n\nI hope my drift at least is clear. Suppression is ongoing and did not die\n\nout with Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. This \"cold war\" seems to be very\n\nfar from over. One particularly poignant trait of ideological deformation\n\nof reality is this: at least the leading protagonists know that and why\n\ntheir systems are flawed-but they stick to their positions anyway.\n\nVoegelin oddly argues that a person of common sense would say that if a\n\ndoctrine is false (say Marx’s account of the human condition, or Auguste\n\nComte’s of history-this is a multicultural enterprise), if it purposely\n\nand systematically falsifies the facts as experienced and truth of\n\nreality, and if the advocate of such a false doctrine knows this-then\n\nanybody with common sense would suspect that the advocate is a fraud. But\n\ncommon sense is not the hallmark of the academy nor of our age, it seems.\n\nMarx wrote: \"Don’t think, don’t ask me!… A rational man does not ask\n\nsuch questions!\" How does Voegelin respond to these statements by this\n\nfamous mover and shaker of the modern world? He writes:\n\n[Marx’s] prohibition now induces us to ask, Was Marx an intellectual\n\nswindler? Such a question will perhaps give rise to objections. Can one\n\nseriously entertain the idea that the lifework of a thinker of\n\nconsiderable rank is based on an intellectual swindle? Could it have\n\nattracted a mass following and become a political world power if it rested\n\non a swindle? But we today are inured to such scruples: we have seen too\n\nmany improbable and incredible things that were nonetheless real.\n\nTherefore, we hesitate neither to ask the question that the evidence\n\npresses upon us, nor to answer [it:] Yes, Marx was an intellectual\n\nswindler. (SPG, 19)\n\nAnd why ever might any man, even a Marx, do such a thing? The answer is\n\nfound in Nietzsche: because of his lust for power-libido dominandi-, the\n\nwill to secure and maintain domination whatever the cost.\n\nIII. Therapy? Is there a Jonas Salk in the house?\n\nMarx is a representative case, especially if the academy is considered,\n\nand will serve our purposes of illustrative analysis of the wider problem.\n\nSolzhenitsyn’s earthy, commonsensical, comment at Harvard comes to mind:\n\nWestern intellectuals believe Marx to be a living lion (the Soviets just\n\ndidn’t do it right!), but we know he is a dead dog! The ideological\n\nperversion of philosophizing is not merely a question of \"ideas\" but of\n\nactions with lethal consequences. Thus, in the same lecture where he\n\npronounced Marx to be a swindler, to the accompaniment of gasps from the\n\naudience and headlines in the newspapers the next day, Voegelin provoked\n\nfurther indignation by drawing a further comparison. He said:\n\nWhoever asks questions about the nature, calling, and destiny of man may\n\nbe temporarily ignored; later, after the system of positivism has\n\nprevailed in society, such persons will have to be silenced by appropriate\n\nmeasures [Comte]. And the prohibition of questions is not harmless, for it\n\nhas attained great social effectiveness among men who forbid themselves to\n\nask questions in critical situations. One thinks of the observation of\n\nRudolf Höss, the [Nazi] commandant of the extermination camp at Auschwitz.\n\nWhen asked why he did not refuse to obey the order to organize the mass\n\nexecutions, he replied: \"At the time I did not indulge in deliberation: I\n\nhad received an order, and I had to carry it out…I do not believe that\n\neven one of the thousands of SS leaders could have permitted such a\n\nthought to occur to him. Something like that was just completely\n\nimpossible.\" This is very close to the wording of Marx’s declaration [in\n\nthe 1844 Paris Manuscripts] that for \"socialist man\" such a question\n\n[about the Ground of being, the divine source of order in reality]\n\n\"becomes a practical impossibility.\" Thus, we see delineated three major\n\ntypes for whom a human inquiry has become a practical impossibility:\n\nsocialist man (in the Marxian sense), positivist man (in the Comtean\n\nsense), and national-socialist man. (SPG, 18)\n\nIn what I have said to this point we have been looking at past and present\n\nevidence. What of the future, you may still want to know? Is there no\n\nencouraging word, prudent counsel, or only disheartening reports on a dead\n\nend? Are we dead men walking after all?\n\nThe starting points for any answers one finds in Voegelin throw us back on\n\nthe intellectual and spiritual resources of our tattered and beleaguered\n\ntraditions. If we are to resist, the means must be found there and\n\nrevived. One need not expect from him novelties in principle, only in\n\ndetail, as he stressed in the words: \"The test of truth, to put it\n\npointedly, will be the lack of originality in the propositions.\" (CW12,\n\n122) His scholarly life consisted of a long meditation on our predicament\n\nand the vivifying illumination of it, and of the human condition more\n\ngenerally to be found (if it is to be found at all), through an open quest\n\nof truth. Voegelin, by his own admission a mystic philosopher, is equally\n\na philosopher of common sense, as I have tried to stress: from this\n\nperspective it is rudimentary that, if you know death and disaster lie in\n\none direction, then you must turn around and go in the opposite direction\n\nas fast as you can. This is recognizably not only common sense but, also,\n\nthe principle of Plato’s periagoge and of the Christian’s metanoia. It is the conversion of the whole man away from the shadows on the wall, the\n\nconventions of the world and its spiritually lethal climate of opinion,\n\ntoward the truth of being within the limits of one’s capacities in\n\ncooperatively following the attractive pull of the Beyond. Dream and\n\nreality must be separated. The uncertain truth we know must be embraced in\n\npreference to the certain untruth of ideology socially enforced and run\n\namuck. (SPG, 75) \"No one is obliged to take part in the spiritual crisis\n\nof a society; on the contrary, everyone is obliged to avoid this folly and\n\nlive his life in order.\" (SPG, 15)\n\nThe spiritual crisis of the West and eclipse of transcendent divine\n\nReality lie at the heart of the problem of recovering truth in the lives\n\nof persons and for the order of society, by Voegelin’s reading. That truth\n\nand the ways to it–whatever their imperfections as imposed by human\n\nperspectives and limitations-remain the fruits of philosophy as ever the\n\nlove of wisdom (not its definitive possession) and of faith as ever the\n\nsubstance of things hoped for, the assurance of things not seen (not the\n\nembrace of an exclusive and unreflecting dogma).\n\nVoegelin’s favorite prophet was Jeremiah, he said, and there is something\n\nof the jeremiad about his work. But when it came time to conclude his\n\nMunich lecture on the \"The German University and German Society\" he\n\ninvoked the persona of the Watchman from Ezekiel (33:7-9):\n\nSo you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel;\n\nwhenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from\n\nme.\n\nIf I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die; and you do not\n\nspeak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked man shall die\n\nin his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.\n\nBut if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from\n\nhis way; he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your soul.\n\n(CW12, 35)\n\nEpilogue\n\nIf one inquires about Voegelin’s more explicit understanding of the\n\nWestern predicament and human prospect, then something like the following\n\nmight be added to the foregoing comments.\n\n1. Western civilization is in the late stages of disintegration. It\n\nreached a climax in the thirteenth century and has endured a series of\n\nincreasingly damaging blows against its spiritual order and institutional\n\ncohesion in the seven hundred years since the great efflorescence in the\n\nChristian philosophy of man and society of Thomas Aquinas. This began\n\nalready with the authoritarian derailment of the church at the hands of\n\nBoniface VIII a bare generation later, compounded in the next century by\n\nthe nominalist-fideist split in philosophy and religion; it was further\n\nexacerbated by the \"civilizational disaster\" of the Reformation, and by\n\nthe waves of rebellion and onslaught against the spiritual integrity of\n\nthe West effected in complex ways already mentioned since the sixteenth\n\ncentury. The rise of natural science in the seventeenth century imbalanced\n\nthe understanding of reality through a tilt and eventual radical closure\n\nagainst the divine Ground of being. Science became the seed bed, not only\n\nof great intellectual achievements, but also for destructive scientism,\n\nphenomenalism, positivism, gnosticism, magic, alchemy, Heremeticism, and\n\nother esoteric movements. These and other manifestations of reductionist\n\negophany have so deformed and afflicted the life of the mind and spirit as\n\nto leave contemporaries with little more than a \"hopeless hope\" for some\n\nrenewal and revival that alone promises to stem the slid of civilizational\n\ndecline. A hopeful precedent is the Second Reformation of John and Charles\n\nWesley and the accompanying Great Awakening that revitalized Britain for a\n\ntime and laid the groundwork for the American founding in the eighteenth\n\ncentury. To this otherwise stark appraisal we may attach the question: Is\n\nany comparable renaissance presently underway?\n\n2. The notion of the West facing other civilizations in a shootout at the\n\nOK Corral for ecumenic hegemony is simplistic and overlooks the factual\n\nsituation.\n\n(a) The West has significantly disintegrated already and (unless it again\n\nrecaptures its vitality through spiritual renewal) may cease to be a major\n\nplayer in world affairs in the next millennium. Ever the spiritual\n\nrealist, Voegelin observes, invoking the Kohelet and Anaximander, that:\n\n\"What comes into being will have an end, and the mystery of this stream of\n\nbeing is impenetrable.\" (NSP, 167; EA, 174; Ecclesiastes. 3:1-11)\n\n(b) The disintegration of the West has been accompanied by a process of\n\n\"westernization\" of the rest of the world to such a degree that all other\n\nextant civilizational societies have absorbed through their dominant\n\nelites many of the nonessential ideological and technological attributes\n\nof the disintegrating West itself: one thinks of a Marxist-Leninist\n\nquasi-Christian Orthodox Russia and a Marxist-Leninist quasi-Confucian and\n\nBuddhist China as prominent illustrations, with the several Islamic,\n\nHindu, and other Buddhist societies yet to be accounted for at the level\n\nof hegemonic power. Toynbee dealt with the generally subversive\n\ncommunication of western influence in terms of \"radiation\" and the \"law of\n\ntrivia,\" and Voegelin thought his account meritorious.\n\n(c) Thus, as the West abandons its own distinctive intellectual and\n\nspiritual identity to become more thoroughly relativistic and amorphous at\n\nits core, it finds treacherous common ground with other progressive\n\nsocieties in scorched earth positivism, scientism, antiphilosophical and\n\nantireligious phenomenalism and nihilism. The Western dissolution radiates\n\na spiritual and intellectual epidemic infecting contemporary mankind.\n\n3. Voegelin ultimately rejects, however, Toynbee’s dissolution of the\n\nhistory of mankind into the rise and fall of civilizations as empirically\n\nfalse; and he also rejects the notion (one that Toynbee also abandoned)\n\nthat a civilization is an intelligible unit or field of historical study.\n\n(a) Civilizational societies are no more than secondary or tertiary\n\nphenomena. They are products of religions (not religions of civilizations)\n\nor more adequately of \"spiritual outbursts,\" and of libidinous power\n\ndrives resulting in imperial conquests that tend to capture such events so\n\nas to legitimize what otherwise would be naked exercises of power.\n\nReligions, moreover, tend not only to constitute but to spill over\n\nmultiple civilizations; and empires, too, are often multi-civilizational.\n\nIn addition to the spiritual visions and concupiscential drives that\n\nculminate in conquests in the creative process of societal formation,\n\nVoegelin finds that a third factor of philosophical-theological\n\nhistoriography typically emerges to evoke the raison d’être of empires as\n\npolitical constellations organized for action in world affairs. Thus, a\n\ntriadic structure appears to be characteristic, if the ecumenic empires\n\nare taken as paradigms.\n\n(b) There still remains the spectacle of a universal mankind–strewn from\n\ndistant antiquity and, even, archeological prehistory down to the\n\npresent–whose commonality of shared humanity reaches beyond the unique\n\npeculiarities of a pluralistic ethnic, cultural, or power field of any\n\nparticular civilization or any discrete religious entity. How explain the\n\napparent fact that underlying all the differences is a palpable unity of\n\nmankind, past, present, and future? We readily acknowledge that the\n\nancient Egyptian, and less ancient Athenian, share common ground as human\n\nbeings with a contemporary American. This commonality is expressed\n\nphilosophically (Aristotle) in terms of a synthetic or composite nature\n\npotentially present in every human being that is, thereby, the epitome of\n\nbeing, crowned with what the old Greeks called Nous that is paradoxically\n\nboth essential nature and tensional participation in the divine Nous\n\nexperienced as Ground. The commonality is expressed pneumatically\n\n(Genesis) by characterizing the human being as imago Dei, the Christ in\n\nevery man. After diligent search of what is universal about mankind,\n\nVoegelin states that \"mankind is not constituted through a survey of\n\nphenomena by even the most erudite historian, but through the experience\n\nof order in the present under God.\" (WP, 16) Later on he adds:\n\nUniversal mankind is not a society existing in the world, but a symbol\n\nwhich indicates man’s consciousness of participating, in his earthly\n\nexistence, in the mystery of a reality that moves toward its\n\ntransfiguration. Universal mankind is an eschatological index. (EA, 305)\n\n4. If we recur to Western categories to express ourselves it is because,\n\nVoegelin argues, the differentiation of truth through faith and reason\n\nachieved a reflective depth or differentiation not matched elsewhere in\n\nhistory: if the language of philosophy were to be abandoned, there would\n\nno other language of reflective discursive rationality that could take its\n\nplace. (WP, 22) The universal becomes articulate only in the concrete\n\ndivine-human events that occur as experiences in the concrete\n\nconsciousness of some particular person at some specific time and place.\n\nAll such experiences are inevitably conditioned by a particular language\n\nand ethnic culture. \"Man\" or \"human being\" is strictly speaking no where\n\nto be found except in specific individual human persons. Yet one reality\n\nand one mankind are affirmed amidst these particularities; they are\n\ndiscernible in equivalent symbolizations of man’s participation in\n\ndivine-human reality throughout history; and they are convincingly\n\ntraceable in an evidentiary trail of equivalent symbols back to the stone\n\nage. Thus, Voegelin observes, what is true for one man also is true for\n\nall men.\n\nBehind every equivalent symbol in the historical field stands the man who\n\nhas engendered it in the course of his search as a representative of a\n\ntruth that is more than equivalent. The search that renders no more than\n\nequivalent truth rests ultimately on the faith that, by engaging in it,\n\nman participates representatively in the divine drama of truth becoming\n\nluminous. (CW12, 132-33)\n\nA further consequence is that faith and reason are not the opposites\n\ngenerally assumed but equivalent symbolisms reflecting the truth of being\n\narising in the participatory experiences of spiritually sensitive men\n\nlodged in the different ethnic horizons of Israel (prophets) and Hellas\n\n(philosophers): Reason (as divine Nous, Plato’s third God in the Laws\n\n713c-714b; EA, 227) is every bit as much a revelation as is the encounter\n\nwith Yahweh in faith by the prophets of Israel. There is, strictly\n\nspeaking, no such thing as merely \"natural\" Reason-contrary to the\n\nScholastics and their continuators.\n\nSuch reflections inform Voegelin’s admiration of Jean Bodin’s bold\n\nmeditative resolution in Colloquium heptaplomeres (1588-?) of the\n\nmurderous religious strife of France in favor of peace through the\n\nmystic’s plea for toleration grounded in awareness of the essential\n\nsameness of God experienced, whatever the creedal differences. The same\n\ntruth is expressed in different languages and symbols-each word, syllable,\n\nand gesture of which may be precious to votaries of the respective creed,\n\nnevertheless-the differences among them are not worth the life of a single\n\nhuman being. The divine reality (the theotes of Col. 2:9) beyond all\n\ndogmatic formulation is experienced as the universally true common\n\ntranscendent Ground nurturing by the divine-human encounter of the\n\nIn-Between (metaxy) the essential humanity of every person. It is above\n\nall else this that is the source of our sense of universal mankind,\n\narising as it does out of the paradox of participation in the ineffable\n\nthat becomes effable in divine-human experiences in myriad modes, in all\n\ntimes, and places. (OH5, 103) In Voegelin’s words:\n\nThe truth of existence…does not emerge from one single spiritual\n\nevent…but assumes the historical form of a plurality of movements\n\nspringing up in Persia and India, in Israel and Hellas. The\n\ndifferentiation of the one truth of existence, thus, is broken in a\n\nspectrum of spiritual eruptions each bearing the mark of the ethnic\n\nculture in which it occurs….The human responses to the divine irruptions\n\nrather tend to accentuate different aspects of the one truth of man’s\n\nexistence under God, such as the Greek noetic or the Israelite-Jewish\n\npneumatic revelations of divine reality.\n\nThis is \"history\" as it was experienced by the more sensitive participants\n\nin the process down to the time of Paul. (EA, 301)\n\nIt is, after all, right that we should end on a hopeful note regarding the\n\nWestern predicament and the human prospect, even if it may not be exactly\n\nthe note we anticipated hearing when we first set out on our discussion.\n\nIt is also right to give Voegelin a last summarizing say in order to put\n\nhis great work into the Christian perspective he steadfastly claimed for\n\nit, despite his sometimes intemperate and self-righteous critics. He\n\nreminded one of these of the following:\n\nThere were always Christian thinkers who recognized the difference between\n\nexperiences of divine reality and the transformation of the insights\n\nengendered by the insights into doctrinal propositions. The tension\n\nbetween theologica mystica and theologica dogmatica goes as far back as\n\nthe patres. It dominates the work of Origen; and its dynamics is the\n\nliving force in such noteworthy successors as Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius,\n\nScotus Erigena, Anselm of Canterbury, and the mystics of the fourteen\n\ncentury….I am equally conscious of not going beyond the orbit of\n\nChristianity when I prefer the experiential symbol divine reality to the\n\nGod of the Creed, for divine reality translates the theotes of Colossians\n\n2:9. The theotes, a neologism of the time, is a symbol arising from\n\nexperiential exegesis; its degree of generality is so high that it can be\n\napplied, not only to the specific experience of divine reality becoming\n\nincarnate in Christ and the Christian believers (the experiences analyzed in Colossians 2), but to every instance of theotes experienced as present\n\nin man and forming his insight into his nature and its relation to the\n\ndivine ground of his existence. Moreover, I am very much aware that my\n\ninquiry into the history of experience and symbolization generalizes the\n\nAnselmian fides quaerens intellectum so as to include every fides, not\n\nonly the Christian, in the quest for understanding by reason. Even this\n\nexpansion of the fides, however, to all the experiences of divine reality\n\nin which history constitutes itself, cannot be said to go beyond\n\n\"Christianity.\" For it is the Christ of the Gospel of John who says of\n\nhimself: \"Before Abraham was, I am\" (8:58); and it is Thomas Aquinas who\n\nconsidered the Christ to be the head of the corpus mysticum that embraces,\n\nnot only Christians, but all mankind from the creation of the world to its\n\nend. In practice this means that one has to recognize, and make\n\nintelligible, the presence of Christ in a Babylonian hymn, or a Taoist\n\nspeculation, or a Platonic dialogue, just as much as in a Gospel.\n\n… It is the guilt of Christian thinkers and church leaders of having\n\nallowed the dogma to separate in the public consciousness of Western\n\ncivilization from the experience of \"the mystery\" on which its truth\n\ndepends. The dogma develops as a socially and culturally necessary\n\nprotection of insights experientially gained against false propositions;\n\nits development is secondary to the truth of experience. If its truth\n\n[pretends] to be autonomous, its validity will come under attack in any\n\nsituation of social crisis, when alienation becomes a mass phenomenon; the\n\ndogma will then be misunderstood as an \"opinion\" which one can believe or\n\nnot, and it will be opposed by counter opinions which dogmatize the\n\nexperience of alienated existence. The development [in the fourteenth\n\ncentury] of a nominalist and fideist conception of Christianity is the\n\ncultural disaster, with its origins in the late Middle Ages, that provokes\n\nthe reaction of alienated existence in the dogmatic form of the\n\nideologies, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The result is the\n\nstate of deculturation with which we are all too familiar from our daily\n\ntalks with students who are caught in the intellectual confusion of a\n\ndebate that proceeds, not by recourse to experience, but by position and\n\ncounter position of opinion. Once truth has degenerated to the level of\n\ntrue doctrine, the return from orthodoxy to \"the mystery\" is a process\n\nthat appears to require as many centuries of effort as have gone into the\n\ndestruction of intellectual and spiritual culture….\n\n…[Complaint is heard] that I neglect the thought and science of the\n\ntwentieth century…. I consider representative, by the side of the work\n\nin theoretical physics, the magnificent work of the historians. They have\n\nbrought to light the background of modernity in gnosticism, hermeticism,\n\nalchemy, and magic; they have restored our knowledge of ancient and\n\nmedieval philosophy; they have provided a solid basis for our\n\nunderstanding of the Israelite-Judaic-Christian experiences; they have\n\nextended our knowledge of the Indian, Chinese, pre-Columbian, and African\n\nsocieties; and they have expanded our historical horizon by the\n\nprehistoric millennia. [The cumulative effect is to demonstrate the\n\npitiful inadequacy of] the ideological systems of the eighteenth and\n\nnineteenth centuries, nothing to say of their epigonal aftermath [as]\n\nobsolete interpretations of reality, for reasons both empirical and\n\ntheoretical. [However, this] marvelous advance of science which\n\ncharacterizes the twentieth century has not yet affected the notorious\n\n\"climate of opinion\" which [still today] dominates the public debate. But\n\nI do not believe the end of the world has come, if it does not come to the\n\nend the ideologists have projected for it. The world will go on, and the\n\nrestoration of the intellectual and spiritual culture in the sciences will\n\nultimately affect an ideological climate that by now has become a\n\nreactionary force. To assist in this process in one of the motives of my\n\nwork.
