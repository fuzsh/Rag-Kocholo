        "text": "Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin were political theorists of the first rank whose impact on the study of political science in North America has been profound. A study of their writings is one of the most expeditious ways to explore the core of political science; comparing and contrasting the positions both theorists have taken in assessing that core provides a comprehensive appreciation of the main options of the Western tradition.In fifty-three recently discovered letters, Strauss and Voegelin explore the nature of their similarities and differences, offering trenchant observations about one another's work, about the state of the discipline, and about the influences working on them. The correspondence fleshes out many assumptions made in their published writings, often with a frankness and directness that removes all vestiges of ambiguity. Included with the correspondence are four pivotal re-published essays \"Jerusalem and Athens: Some Preliminary Reflections\" (Strauss), \"The Gospel and Culture\" (Voegelin), \"Immortality: Experience and Symbol\" (Voegelin), and \"The Mutual Influence of Theology and Philosophy\" (Strauss) and commentaries by James L. Wiser, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Stanley Rosen, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Timothy Fuller, Ellis Sandoz, Thomas L. Pangle, and David Walsh.\"\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nReview:\n\nIt would be difficult to find a more profound and stimulating book covering the whole history and understanding of faith and reason in Western intellectual history.... In so many ways, the correspondence itself... is simply gripping. One has to lack a soul not to realize that here we approach, haltingly, the ultimate things.... The book, in short, is exciting and profound.... This correspondence is a trumpet call from the political philosophers to theologians, scientists, philosophers, and historians to wake up, to attend to the real origins and meanings of the disorders of modernity that have arisen from a failure to understand reason and revelation.-Review of Metaphysics; \"\"Faith and Political Philosophy is an unusual book: not only does in introduce the reader to the highly original and exciting world of Leo Strauss's and Eric Voegelin's thought, the study of which, it is justly claimed, 'is one of the most expeditious ways to explore the core of political science,' but it also provides an intimate glimpse into the personal side of their scholarship.\"\"-Muslim World Book Review; \"\"This book serves well to initiate its readers into a lively and provocative exchange between two of the best contemporary political philosophers and their respective legacles.\"\"-Canadian Journal of Political Science\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nPeter Emberley is Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. He is the author or editor of numerous books, including Divine Hunger: Canadians on a Spiritual Walkabout. Barry Cooper is Professor of Political Science at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, and Director of the Alberta Policy Research Centre at the Fraser Institute. He is the author or editor of numerous books, including Eric Voegelin and the Foundations of Modern Political Science and New Political Religions, or an Analysis of Modern Terrorism, both available from the University of Missouri Press.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
