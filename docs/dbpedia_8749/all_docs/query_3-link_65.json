        "text": "Foundations\n\nOf American Liberty And Rule Of Law [1]\n\nBy\n\nEllis Sandoz\n\nProfessor of Political Science & Director\n\nEric Voegelin Institute for American Renaissance Studies\n\nLouisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803-5466\n\nThey\n\nconstantly try to escape\n\nFrom the darkness outside and within\n\nBy dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.\n\nBut the man that is will shadow\n\nThe man that pretends to be.\n\nChoruses\n\nfrom ‘The Rock’ (VI), T. S. Eliot\n\nThe argument I wish to offer\n\nregarding the foundations of American liberty and rule of law (or constitutionalism,\n\na word invented by Americans at the time) stresses the debt of the founders to\n\ntheir civilizational past.[ii]\n\nWhether, or to what degree, the Anglo-American constitutional and\n\nphilosophical past was and is unique is largely a matter for another day.\n\nAnd I must confess my prejudice in favor of American exceptionalism,\n\nas the historians call it: i.e., for all the debts to the general legacy of\n\nWestern civilization, and to Graeco-Roman civilization and to Israel, American\n\nconstitutional democracy is unique.[iii]\n\nSo, I will have it both ways: it\n\nis a product of a common European, even Mediterranean, past; and it is something\n\nstartlingly different from anything else that has ever happened in the history\n\nof the world.\n\nCritics will doubtless take pleasure in exploiting the contradiction.\n\nFor how can one and the same thing be both profoundly old and profoundly\n\nnew at one and the same time? Elementary\n\nlogic has something forceful to say about that.\n\nI shall seek to find some answers to this most reasonable question in the\n\nnext few minutes. But at the outset\n\nit should be noticed that our subject involves complex series of events and\n\narrays of symbolisms scattered over millennia, and not merely a discrete entity\n\nnor even a single series. Rather,\n\nit forms a texture of polyphonic intricacy.\n\nMoreover, I am shamelessly ready if truth demands it and when all else\n\nfails, to take refuge behind Ralph Waldo Emerson’s defiant maxim, heedless of\n\nthe prescribed stature: \"A\n\nfoolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen\n\nand philosophers and divines. With\n\nconsistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.\n\nHe may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall.\n\nSpeak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak\n\nwhat tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you\n\nsaid today.\"[iv]\n\nBut perhaps a synthesis will emerge as the discussion proceeds.\n\nMy remarks address\n\nthree principal questions: what is old, what new, about American liberty and\n\nconstitutionalism? What\n\nmaladies most threaten liberty and aspirations to rule of law regimes, in\n\nAmerica and elsewhere?[v]\n\nI.\n\nThe radical break with the past characteristic of the French Revolution\n\nwas not overtly part of the American Revolution and its rhetorical\n\njustification. The contrasts can\n\nmost forcefully be seen from a brilliant page in Edmund Burke’s 1796 Letters\n\non a Regicide Peace where he identifies Regicide, Jacobinism and Atheism\n\nas the hallmarks of the former. By\n\nthis he meant: (1) sanctioning the murder of the king merely because kingship is\n\nby definition usurpation, this being done with impunity in the name of Democracy\n\nas the sole legitimate form of government; (2) wholesale confiscation of private\n\nproperty from its owners who might freely be killed whether they struggled\n\nagainst the taking or not, in the name of Liberty; and\n\n(3) rejection and unrelenting persecution of Christianity and its\n\nministers, along with the defacement and destruction of its churches, as matters\n\nof public policy done in the name of Reason.[vi] However\n\none might wish to qualify Burke’s analysis, the intent of the French\n\nrevolutionaries of 1789 to wipe the slate clean and effect a total destruction\n\nof the hated ancien régime of their country so as to establish a new\n\norder of their own devising seems beyond debate.\n\nIn short, then, neither in spirit nor substance was American Whig liberty\n\nat all the same as French Jacobin liberty.\n\nThe American founding generation’s resistance to tyranny and claim to\n\nliberty as free men echoed themes as old as the civilization itself and\n\nconstantly recurred to that tradition. Coming\n\nduring the Golden Age of the classics, the American appeal was grounded in\n\nphilosophy as expressed in Aristotle, Cicero, Aquinas, Harrington, Locke, and\n\nThomas Reid; in Protestant Christianity in the form of a political theology that\n\nmingled religious revival, keeping the faith and fighting the good fight,\n\nprovidential purpose, and a palpable sense of special favor or choseness; and in\n\na constitutionalism that recapitulated all of the arguments seventeenth-century\n\nEnglishmen had thought valid in resisting the tyranny of Stuart kings by\n\ninvoking common law liberty back to Magna Carta and the ancient constitution,\n\nespecially as this tradition had been authoritatively propounded by Sir Edward\n\nCoke (d. 1634) in his eleven volumes of Reports (1601-1615) and four\n\nvolumes of Institutes (1628-1644). Coke’s\n\nbooks formed the legal and constitutional mind of America down to the 1770s when\n\nSir William Blackstone’s Commentaries (four volumes, 1765-1769)\n\nsupplanted them as the basis of legal education on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAs Thomas Jefferson wrote James Madison in one of his last letters:\n\nYou will recollect that\n\nbefore the Revolution, Coke Littleton was the universal elementary book of law\n\nstudents, and a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the\n\northodox doctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English\n\nliberties. You remember also that\n\nour lawyers were then all Whigs. But\n\nwhen his black-letter text, and uncouth but cunning learning got out of fashion,\n\nand the honeyed Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the students’ hornbook, from\n\nthat moment, that profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into\n\ntoryism, and nearly all of the young brood of lawyers now are of that hue.\n\nThey suppose themselves, indeed, to be Whigs, because they no longer know\n\nwhat Whigism or republicanism means.[vii]\n\nIn\n\nsum, John Locke (read as a Christian philosopher, even as an Aristotelian in his\n\npolitical theory), the Bible, and Coke’s version of the Lancastrian constitution\n\nof England formed the heart of the political, theological, and constitutional\n\ntheory pervasive in America during the founding era.\n\nWhat does this come down to? The\n\nbrief answer is that American founders–revolutionaries and constitution-makers\n\nalike–laid claim to their heritage out of a profound veneration for it\n\ninstilled from many quarters. \"In\n\na sentence, the founding was the rearticulation of Western civilization in its\n\nAnglo-American mode.\"[viii]\n\nEmphases shifted, to be sure, even gyrated wildly, as the several stages\n\nof the founding unfolded from the Declaration of Independence (1776), to the\n\nArticles of Confederation (1781), the conclusion of the war (1783), the framing\n\nof the Constitution (1787), and the ratification of the Bill of Rights\n\n(1791)–to mention some of the principal landmarks.\n\nUndergirding all of the \"events\" lay a concerted education of\n\nthe general populace of America in the political theory and jurisprudence of\n\nliberty and rule of law that created the civic consciousness of\n\ncitizenship essential to the formation of civil community or society and to the\n\nfoundation of the nation.\n\nIt seems likely to me that the origins of a national American\n\ncommunity with a special destiny in world history lay in the work of George\n\nWhitefield and other itinerant preachers who crisscrossed the country for\n\ndecades, bringing the Great Awakening to America from 1739 onward, sporadically\n\nright into the Revolutionary and constitutional periods.\n\nReligious and political corruption were readily viewed as two sides of\n\nthe same coin, whether decried as sin and apostasy or as corruption and\n\nRobinarchy. By 1783, in the flush\n\nof triumph over Britain, President Ezra Stiles of Yale College could preach a\n\nnearly apocalyptic election sermon entitled The United States Elevated to\n\nGlory and Honor proclaiming the rise of American Zion.\n\n\"We have reason to hope,\" Stiles said, \"that God has still\n\ngreater blessings in store for this vine which his own right hand hath planted,\n\nto make us high among the nations in praise, and in name, and in honor.\"[ix]\n\nA historical jurisprudence as well as a natural law jurisprudence were\n\nbasic in America, unlike England. The\n\npolitical and constitutional preoccupation had begun in earnest in the early\n\n1760s soon after the succession of George III to the throne.\n\nIt reached fever-pitch with enactment of the Declaratory Act\n\nof 1766 by which parliament laid claim to a power over the colonies \"to\n\nbind [them] in all matters whatsoever.\"\n\nThe contrast between rule of law–and rule by law,\n\nannounced by Hobbes and basic to the legal positivism of the modern Rechtsstaat–comes\n\nto view in this connection.[x]\n\nBy the former, there is an appeal to a higher standard of law and justice\n\nthan the merely mortal or, at the least, than the enacted law of merely\n\ncontemporary rulers.\n\nIt is tempting to summarize by saying that the constitutional\n\nsplit between Britain and America at the time of the Revolution is explainable\n\nin considerable degree in terms of a preposition.\n\nLaw must be just and reasonable as arising from a source superior to the\n\nstate.[xi]\n\nThus, law does not rest merely on will, even if the will of a duly\n\nconstituted authority or sovereign, whether it be a sovereign king or a\n\nsovereign parliament; as Coke had said earlier, sovereignty is no\n\nparliamentary word. From the common\n\nlaw perspective of Coke and his American disciples, the argument is from\n\nimmemorial usage of the prescriptive ancient constitution, and the liberties of\n\nfree men. In the words of Magna\n\nCarta of 1225 (c. 1), which became through Edward I’s statutory confirmation in\n\n1297 the first English statute, \"all the free-men of our realm [omnibus\n\nliberis hominibus regni nostri]\" are granted \"forever, all of the\n\nunderwritten liberties.\" According\n\nto Coke’s famous dictum in Doctor Bonham’s Case (1610), \"when an act\n\nof parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to\n\nbe performed, the common law will controul it and adjudge such act to be\n\nvoid.\"[xii]\n\nHerein lies the root of judicial review and the remarkable empowerment of\n\nthe federal judiciary in the United States after Marbury v. Madison (1803).\n\nBut in the America of the founding period, the appeal went equally to\n\nhigher law, to the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God\" as the\n\nDeclaration of Independence averred. The\n\nclassical and medieval conceptions endured as commonplace: human law must\n\nconform with higher law, for as Augustine had written over a millennium before\n\n(and Aristotle had implied still earlier), an unjust law is no law at all.\n\nWhile English jurisprudence shied away from entangling common law and\n\nnatural law, it was a legitimate inheritance from Fortescue and Coke\n\nnonetheless, as can be seen from the latter’s report of Calvin’s Case\n\n(1610) where he wrote in summary: \"[The]\n\nlaw of nature is part of the laws of England…the law of nature was before any\n\njudicial or municipal law in the world…the law of nature is immutable, and\n\ncannot be changed….\" Coke\n\nthen quaintly explained that the law of nature is that\n\nwhich God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart,\n\nfor his preservation and direction; and this is Lex aeterna, the moral\n\nlaw, called also the law of nature. And\n\nby this law, written with the finger of God in the heart of man, were the people\n\nof God a long time governed before the law was written by Moses, who was the\n\nfirst reporter or writer of law in the world…. And Aristotle, nature’s\n\nSecretary Lib. 5. Aethic. [7. 1. 1334b20] saith that jus naturale est,\n\nquod apud omnes homines eandem habet potentiam [natural justice is that\n\nwhich everywhere has the same force and does not exist by people’s thinking this\n\nor that.] And herewith doth agree\n\nBracton lib. 1. cap. 5. and Fortescue cap. 8. 12. 13. and 16. Doctor and\n\nStudent cap. 2. and 4.[xiii]\n\nAmericans\n\nof the time would readily have embraced Aquinas’ teaching that, if positive or\n\nhuman law departs from the law of nature, it is no longer law but perversion of\n\nlaw.[xiv] The\n\nflavor is captured in James Otis’ Rights of British Colonies Asserted and\n\nProved (1764) where he echoes Cicero:\n\nThe law of nature was not\n\nof man’s making, nor is it in his power to mend it or alter its course.\n\nHe can only perform and keep or disobey and break it.\n\nThe last is never done with impunity, even in this life, if it is any\n\npunishment for a man to feel himself depraved, to find himself degraded by his\n\nown folly and wickedness from the rank of a virtuous and good man to that\n\nof a brute, or to be transformed from the friend, perhaps father, of his country\n\nto a devouring lion or tiger.[xv]\n\nWhat comes to view in the foregoing paragraphs is the Great Chain or\n\nhierarchy of being with man’s place in it an intermediary one between God and\n\nbrute, obliged to obey natural and divine law, to be obedient to human authority\n\nas divinely ordained unless to do so violates God’s law, in which circumstance\n\nat least passive resistance is demanded if not an appeal to heaven that may end\n\nin the deposition of the tyrant. Government,\n\nso conceived, rests on the consent of free men.\n\nIn fact, liberty in one of its principal meanings\n\nduring the founding meant to live under laws consented to by the people either\n\ndirectly or through their representatives, whence the term free government.[xvi]\n\nThe stress comes much earlier, however.\n\nThus, the hallmark of English rule (as Sir John Fortescue in the\n\nfifteenth century insisted and Coke and American Whigs subsequently believed),\n\nis not merely regal (as in France) but political and regal (dominium\n\npoliticum et regale). By this\n\nis especially meant that the king cannot legislate solely by his own will but\n\nonly with the consent of the realm as given through Parliament: \"a king of\n\nthis sort is obliged to protect the law, the subjects, and their bodies and\n\ngoods, and he has power for this end issuing from the people, so that it is not\n\npermissible for him to rule his people with any other power.\"[xvii]\n\nThe close approach to the later notion of popular sovereignty is to be\n\nobserved. In Richard Hooker’s\n\nelegant summation: \"Laws they are not therefore which public approbation\n\nhath not made so.\"[xviii] But\n\nthis was so at least as early as De laudibus (ca. 1470) when Fortescue\n\nlaid it down that royal power in England (in sharp contrast to the lex regia\n\nof Roman law as institutionalized as dominium tantum regale in the France\n\nof Louis XI) is limited by law and that law could neither be made nor altered\n\nwithout consent of parliament, perhaps the first direct assertion of\n\nparliamentary authority as a constitutional limit on the king’s power.\n\nThus, England as a mixed monarchy of double majesty found\n\narticulation. Behind the words lay\n\nalso the political tradition (capable of being revived over centuries as crises\n\ndemanded) of an independent baronage with power to confront the king and insist\n\nupon his observing the limits imposed through covenant and law upon his great\n\noffice–as had in fact been done on that memorable June 15 in 1215 at Runnymede\n\nwhen Magna Carta was signed by King John.\n\nFour hundred years later, by the time of the crisis leading to the\n\nPetition of Right (1628), Coke found that Magna Carta had been confirmed no less\n\nthan thirty-two times by English monarchs.\n\nThat \"princes are bound by and shall live according to their\n\nlaws\" as a matter of natural law was concluded by the Bolognese monk\n\nGratian in about 1140, in his great work entitled A Concordance of Discordant\n\nCanons (Decretum); this had been asserted earlier by Ivo (1040-1115)\n\nbut was not to be found in Roman or German law.[xix]\n\nThe principle took on new life, however, with Henry de Bracton (d. 1268)\n\nin De legibus, written in the wake of the signing of Magna Carta and the\n\nGreat Charter’s having been confirmed four times by Henry III (1216, 1217, 1225,\n\nand 1251).\n\nBracton’s words were aptly recalled at a climactic moment in\n\nthe great seventeenth-century struggle between crown and parliament that had\n\nbeen led at earlier stages by Coke and John Selden before civil war ensued.\n\nIn 1649, John Bradshaw, the Puritan parliamentary prosecutor addressed\n\n\"Charles Stuart,\" after the court had condemned him for murder,\n\narbitrary rule, and tyranny but before the sentence of death by beheading was\n\npronounced, as follows: \"The\n\nking has a superior, namely, God. Also\n\nthe law by which he is made king. Also\n\nhis curia, namely, the earls and barons, because if he is without bridle,\n\nthat is without law, they ought to put the bridle on him.\"\n\nBradshaw explained the political theory in his own words:\n\n\"This we learn: the end of having kings, or any other\n\ngovernors, it is for the enjoying of justice; that is the end.\n\nNow, Sir, if so be the king will go contrary to the end of his\n\ngovernment, Sir, he must understand that he is but an officer in trust, and he\n\nought to discharge that trust; and they are to take order for the punishment of\n\nsuch an offending governor. This is\n\nnot law of yesterday, Sir, but it is law of old.\"[xx]\n\nII.\n\nWith the old medieval representative assemblies of France and Spain gone\n\nunder before the rising tide of absolutism, Britain alone among the major\n\nnations avoided absolute kingship–the vanguard of modernity whereby\n\npolitical rulers claim to be mortal gods entitled to exercise dominion without\n\nrestraint. By this reading royal absolutism\n\nprefigures Bonapartism, proclamation of the Uebermensch, and\n\ntotalitarianism as quintessential modernity.\n\nThat absolutism was avoided in Britain, and that supremacy of the law in\n\nits medieval guise came to be applied to modern states–the legacy claimed by\n\neighteenth-century Americans as their birthright–was no accident.\n\nAs the premier historian of English legal history wrote:\n\n\"It is largely owing to the influence of [Coke’s] writings that\n\nthese medieval conceptions have become part our modern law…. They preserved\n\nfor England and the world the constitutional doctrine of rule of law.\"\n\nThey formed \"the turning-point in English\n\nconstitutional history.\"[xxi]\n\nConstitutionalism or rule of law (to use the terms as equivalents) means\n\nthat the power of rulers is limited and that the limits can be enforced through\n\nestablished procedures. It means\n\ngovernment that is, at once, devoted both to the public good of the entire\n\ncommunity and to the preservation of the liberties of individual persons as far\n\nas that is consistent with public good. In\n\nJohn Selden’s formulation during the Petition of Right debate, salus populi\n\nsuprema lex, et libertas popula summa salus populi [the welfare of the\n\npeople is the supreme law and the liberty of the people the greatest welfare of\n\nthe people].[xxii]\n\nBecause the most precious liberties of free men are preserved in law\n\nconceived to be just, reasonable, and immemorial as the fundamental law or law\n\nof the land (Magna Carta’s lex terrae), Coke gives the primary meaning of\n\nlibertates as used in Magna Carta as \"the Laws of the Realme, in\n\nwhich respect this Charter is called, Charta libertatum.\"[xxiii]\n\nThis understanding of liberty is akin to the philosophical one\n\nthat only the man whose reason governs base passions, therewith to live justly,\n\nis truly free and, thus, capable of happiness conceived as a life lived in\n\naccordance with virtue. The\n\nopposite type is the banausic or materialistic man who is routinely governed by\n\nhis desires and, in extreme cases, by libido with such compulsion that\n\nreason becomes merely instrumental as the means of finding ways to\n\ngratification: so to be enslaved by passion is to be radically unfree.\n\nAristotle’s \"slave by nature,\" approximates Thomas Hobbes’\n\ntypical man who, devoid of sensitivity for summum Bonum, is consumed by\n\nself-love (amor sui, in the Augustinian sense).[xxiv] Pride\n\nin such men can only be broken by the complete therapy prescribed in Leviathan,\n\na work perhaps ironically intended by its author.\n\nLiberty is experienced in its primary sense only through willing\n\nacceptance of truth or reason’s dictates as a matter of free choice which rises\n\nin maturity into becoming an eager seeking after the transcendental Good for its\n\nactualizing attractiveness. This\n\naspect blends philosophical and biblical teachings as symbolized by New\n\nTestament statements: \"You\n\nshall know the truth and the truth shall make you free\" (John 8:32); and,\n\nby verses dear to Americans during the Revolution: \"So, then, brethren, we\n\nare not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.\n\nStand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\n\nand be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage\" (Galatians 4:31-5:1).[xxv]\n\nIn other words, liberty and license were clearly distinguished by\n\nAmericans of the period, even if this may no longer be the case.\n\nAnd there are two other vital dimensions of liberty to be noticed: liberty\n\nand private property and freedom of conscience.\n\nWith a Revolution fought whose motto (if it had one) was \"No\n\ntaxation without representation,\" the connection of freedom and property\n\ndeserves emphasis. John\n\nWitherspoon, president of the College of New Jersey at Princeton–and, as the\n\nteacher there of eight of the 55 eventual participants in the Constitutional\n\nConvention of 1787 (including James Madison), probably the most influential\n\nprofessor in American history–stressed the indissoluble link between personal\n\nand property rights as part of the divine, natural, and civic order.\n\n\"If we take tradition or Revelation for our guide,\" Witherspoon\n\nwrote, \"the matter is plain, that God made man lord of works of his hands,\n\nand puts under him all the other creatures…. Private property is every\n\nparticular person’s having a confessed and exclusive right to a certain portion\n\nof the goods which serve for the support and conveniency of life.\"\n\nAnd in the face of the depredations of the British ministry Witherspoon\n\nasserted in the Continental Congress that \"[t]here is not a single instance\n\nin history in which civil liberty was lost, and religious liberty preserved\n\nentire. If therefore we yield up\n\nour temporal property, we at the same time deliver the conscience into\n\nbondage.\"[xxvi] In\n\nhis mighty last-ditch appeal of March 1775 to avoid war, Edmund Burke in the\n\nHouse of Commons reminded members that\n\nthe people of the colonies\n\nare descendants of Englishmen. England,\n\nSir, is a nation which still, I hope, respects, and formerly adored her freedom.\n\nThe colonists…are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty\n\naccording to English ideas and on English principles.\n\nAbstract liberty, like other mere abstractions, is not to be found.\n\nLiberty inheres in some sensible object…. [T]he great contests\n\nfor freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly upon the\n\nquestion of taxing…. On this point of taxes the ablest pens and most eloquent\n\ntongues have been exercised, the greatest spirits have acted and\n\nsuffered….They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle,\n\nthat in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves, mediately or\n\nimmediately, possess the power of granting their own money, or no shadow of\n\nliberty could subsist…. [I]n order to prove that the Americans have no right\n\nto their liberties, we are every day endeavoring to subvert the maxims which\n\npreserve the whole spirit of our own….As long as you have the wisdom to keep\n\nthe sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred\n\ntemple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of\n\nEngland worship freedom, they will turn their faces toward you…. Slavery they\n\ncan have anywhere. It is a weed\n\nthat grows in every soil.[xxvii]\n\nIII.\n\nWith freedom of conscience we may sidle in the direction of what is new\n\nin American liberty and rule of law. The\n\nline is hard to draw. Burke in the\n\nplace just quoted has much to say about the fierce American devotion to liberty\n\nand the centrality of their dissenting Protestant beliefs to that cast of mind.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s would remind his readers that it\n\nshould never be forgotten that religion gave birth to America, that Christianity\n\nwas as ubiquitous as the air we breathe, and he saw Anglo-American civilization\n\nas the \"product\" of two elements most often at war with one another\n\nelsewhere but here to be found \"forming a marvelous combination.\n\nI mean the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom.\"\n\nThe \"main reason\" for this happy state of affairs, Tocqueville\n\nconcluded, and \"for the quiet sway of religion over their country was the\n\ncomplete separation of church and state.\"[xxviii]\n\nFreedom of religion in America at the time under discussion was\n\noverwhelmingly a freedom to be religious according to one’s own lights.\n\nAs the conflict with Britain intensified from the 1760s\n\nonward the terror swept the colonies that a bishop would be sent to America to\n\nsecure conformity of worship and submission to the Church of England.\n\nGeorge Whitefield himself sounded the alarm as early as 1764 when he\n\nwarned two New Hampshire ministers: \"There is a deep laid plot against both\n\nyour civil and religious liberties, and they will be lost.\n\nYour golden days are at an end.\"[xxix]\n\nThe Methodists were buoyed when John Wesley in 1774 supported the\n\ncolonial cause, but the satisfaction turned to horror when Wesley changed sides\n\na year later and chose to explain himself in a pamphlet partly plagiarized from\n\nSamuel Johnson.\n\nThis went through nineteen printings and was widely\n\ncirculated by the British government but seized and burnt by American Methodists\n\nwherever they could find copies, trying to keep them out of the country where\n\nthey and Wesley were vilified.[xxx]\n\nReverend James Madison, cousin of the statesman and an Anglican priest\n\nwho later became bishop, as president of William and Mary became captain of\n\nmilitia and led his students in battle during the Revolution; he was said to\n\nhave been so intense in his patriotism as to emend the Lord’s Prayer, on\n\noccasion, by intoning \"…Thy\n\nRepublic come.\"[xxxi]\n\nAmericans during the Revolution were called to their houses of worship\n\nfor public days of prayer, fasting, humiliation (or thanksgiving, as suited) at\n\nleast sixteen times by formal Proclamation of the Continental Congress, a\n\npractice that continued during the early administrations under the Constitution\n\nand of which the modern observance of Thanksgiving Day is a relic.\n\nWith completion of the new capitol in the District of Columbia, church\n\nservices regularly were held for the Congress and officials of government,\n\nincluding the president and cabinet members, in the House of Representatives\n\nchamber on Sundays, a practice that continued until well after the Civil War.[xxxii]\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson attended these, arranged for the newly-formed\n\n(1800) United States Marine Corps Band to play on occasion to help with the\n\nmusic. When the band’s playing\n\nturned out not to be the best, Jefferson (himself a violinist and the best\n\nmusician ever elected president) is said to have connived with the band director\n\nto recruit some eighteen Italian musicians into the band so as to improve it.\n\nThe log cabin and dirt street capital of the United States was a major\n\nculture shock for the Italians.[xxxiii]\n\nThus, the separation between church and state was never so absolute as\n\nTocqueville thought. Much of the\n\nmoral basis of the Revolution came from the religious communities, with the\n\npreachers playing a vital, perhaps decisive role in forming the resolve of the\n\ncountry for independence and sustaining courage to see the war through to the\n\nend. As Perry Miller summarized the\n\nmatter: \"A pure rationalism such as [Jefferson’s] might have declared the\n\nindependence of these folk, but it could never have inspired them to fight for\n\nit.\"[xxxiv]\n\nThe role of the dissenting religious communities–Baptists,\n\nPresbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers, plus Jews and Catholics–was equally vital in\n\narriving at the unique American solution to the vexed problems of religious\n\nconflict and persecution so admired by Tocqueville and, indeed, so worthy of\n\nadmiration. For the solution turned\n\non the matter of disestablishment, so that public money was not devoted to\n\nreligious entities, thereby favoring one sect over another; and side-by-side\n\nwith this was the requirement that freedom of religion not be tampered with by\n\npublic officials. The major victory\n\non these grounds was won in Virginia shortly before the calling of the Federal\n\nConvention and prefigured the form to be taken in the initial clauses of the\n\nFirst Amendment which read: \"Congress\n\nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the\n\nfree exercise thereof….\" The\n\nleadership in both instances came from James Madison, whose interest in matters\n\nreligious was profound. He\n\npersonally defended jailed Baptist ministers at the beginning of a public career\n\nthat next saw him helping to frame the Virginia Declaration of Rights, defending\n\nhis state against the advocates of religious establishment through authorship of\n\nthe Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, securing passage of\n\nThomas Jefferson’s long dormant Bill/Statute for Religious Freedom (January\n\n1786), leading the drafting and passage of the federal Bill of Rights in the\n\nFirst Congress under the Constitution, enforcing it as President, and never\n\ndeviating throughout his lifetime in devotion to liberty of conscience.\n\nHe regarded securing the enactment of the Virginia Act Establishing\n\nReligious Freedom as his most gratifying legislative achievement.\n\n\"We now give full credit to the contribution of James Madison,\n\nmediating with consummate skill among Baptists, Presbyterians, and liberal\n\nAnglicans, putting through the Statute while Jefferson was in Paris,\" Henry\n\nF. May writes. \"The troops\n\nwere Baptists and Presbyterians and the tactics were Madison’s, but the\n\nwords…were Jefferson’s. These\n\nwere and are wholly representative of the Revolutionary Enlightenment.\"[xxxv]\n\nA hallmark of American liberty, the Bill of Rights deserves\n\nfurther special comment at this juncture.[xxxvi]\n\nThe Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution consists of the\n\nfirst ten amendments taken together, especially the first eight of these which\n\nidentify specific individual rights. These\n\nwere proposed in 1789 by Representative James Madison who was solidly backed by\n\nPresident George Washington during the First Congress.\n\nTen of the twelve congressionally approved amendments were ratified by\n\nten states so as to take effect on December 15, 1791.\n\nTheir general tenor is to protect individual personal,\n\npolitical, and religious liberties against infringement by government,\n\nprincipally by the national government in the original conception and down to\n\n1925 when a process of \"nationalization\" gradually began that has\n\nbrought protection against invasion by the states of most of the rights listed\n\nand of a number only implied by (or \"penumbral\" to) the rights\n\nspecified. The philosophical\n\nfoundation of the Bill of Rights is set forth in the Declaration of\n\nIndependence’s first sentences, especially the announcement of \"certain\n\nunalienable rights\" grounded in the \"laws of nature and nature’s\n\nGod.\"\n\nThe effectiveness of the provisions of the Bill of Rights in\n\nprotecting fundamental personal liberties through American law is uniquely\n\ndependent upon the power of judicial review as exercised by the Federal\n\njudiciary, with a last resort in the Supreme Court of the United States. The\n\njudiciary determines with finality, on a case by case adversary basis, the\n\nmeaning and force of laws under the Constitution considered as the Supreme Law\n\nof the Land (Art. VI).\n\nThe origins of the liberties protected and general theory of rights\n\nundergirding that protection are of great antiquity and grounded in immemorial\n\nusage (or prescription) and natural right, although meaning and\n\nimportance were sharpened by the debate leading to American independence and\n\nRevolution and gained impetus from the eighteenth-century Enlightenment with its\n\nemphasis upon reason and the individual. It\n\nremains generally true, however, that the rights protected substantively were\n\npart and parcel of an inherited tradition of common law liberty and rule of law\n\nthat emerged in medieval England from the time of King Edward the Confessor (d.\n\n1066), last of the Saxon kings, to Magna Carta as developed in the jurisprudence\n\nof Henry de Bracton, refined in the Lancastrian constitutional jurisprudence of\n\nSir John Fortescue (Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor under Henry VI, d.\n\n1479-?). This tradition was\n\nrecovered, vivified, and perfected in seventeenth-century England especially by\n\nSir Edward Coke (1584-1634) in the House of Commons during the long contest\n\nbetween parliament and the Stuart kings memorialized in the Petition of Right\n\n(1628), the beheading of Charles I (1649), and eventuating in the Glorious\n\nRevolution of 1688, Settlement of 1689 and parliamentary enactment of the\n\nDeclaration of Rights as the English Bill of Rights of the same year, thus\n\ngiving its name to the genre. The\n\nconstitutional form authoritative at the time of the American founding, was\n\npowerfully shaped by Coke, former Attorney General and Lord Chief Justice of\n\nEngland, who led a successful resistance against extension of the royal\n\nprerogative and the attendant establishment of absolutism and rule by divine\n\nright that saved rule of law and constitutionalism for England and the modern\n\nworld, as Sir William Holdsworth emphasized.\n\nDecisive for the continuity of this vision of liberty through law and\n\nlimited government was the education of subsequent generations of lawyers,\n\nincluding the American revolutionary generation and beyond, by Coke’s Institutes\n\nand Reports. There is, thus,\n\nthis international or ecumenic dimension that, while the bill of rights concept\n\nmay primarily be American, the liberties protected, and institutional modes\n\ndevised for their protection, are deeply moored in Anglo-American political and\n\nconstitutional history, especially in those passages of it in which the\n\nabsolutism was narrowly averted that swept over almost all of Western\n\ncivilization in the seventeenth century with consequences into the present.\n\nIndeed, the securing of personal liberty and free government through rule\n\nof law is a legacy quite self-consciously reaching back to distant antiquity, to\n\nCicero in Rome and Aristotle in Hellas.\n\nWell before 1789 when, under heavy political pressure from the\n\nAntifederalists and public sentiment fearful that personal liberties might be\n\nimperilled by the new Constitution, Madison proposed his amendments, virtually\n\nall of the rights to be included in the Federal Bill of Rights already had\n\nbeen set out in bills of rights ratified by eleven of the original thirteen\n\nstates plus Vermont. The inventory\n\nof such rights already adopted by one or another of the new American states,\n\nthus, included the following: no establishment of religion, free exercise of\n\nreligion, free speech, free press, assembly, petition, right to bear arms, no\n\nquartering of soldiers, searches and seizures protection, requirement of grand\n\njury indictment, protection against double jeopardy and self-incrimination,\n\nguarantee of due process of law, just compensation, a public trial, jury trial,\n\naccusation and confrontation, witnesses, guarantee of counsel, protection\n\nagainst excessive bail, fines, and punishment.\n\nThe only major provision not found in the earlier state documents is the\n\nretained rights provision of the Ninth Amendment.\n\nThe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (1780), drafted by\n\nJohn Adams, even included a reserved powers clause (Art. IV) analogous to the\n\nTenth Amendment’s provision. The\n\nMassachusetts document also had the merit of partly replacing the admonitory\n\nlanguage of ought used by George Mason in drafting the 1776 Virginia\n\nDeclaration of Rights (the model for eight other states’ bills of rights), with\n\nthe imperative shall of legal command found (along with shall not)\n\nin Madison’s Bill of Rights.\n\nWith a glance at developments since the founding, it can be noted that\n\nthere was virtually no judicial construction of the meaning of the various\n\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights until well after adoption of the Civil War\n\namendments, numbers thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen.\n\nA voluminous litigatory process of \"absorption,\"\n\n\"selective incorporation,\" and identification of liberties occupying a\n\n\"preferred position\" (First Amendment rights), or as being\n\n\"fundamental rights\" has accelerated, however, since the Adamson\n\ncase in 1947 which results in applying the Bill of Rights to state governments\n\nand even private actions, no less than to actions of the Federal government.\n\nToday the liberty protected against invasion by the states under\n\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embraces all\n\nprovisions of the First Amendment and nearly all provisions of the Fourth,\n\nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments.\n\nThe principal exceptions are the Fifth Amendment’s right to a grand jury\n\nindictment in criminal cases and the Seventh Amendment’s guarantee of a jury\n\ntrial in civil cases. In addition,\n\nthere is a substantial expanse of additional personal liberty, especially\n\nrace-related \"civil rights,\" protected\n\nby the Equal Protection Clause, and as strictly extra-constitutional\n\nrights (such as privacy and the right to travel) that an activist judiciary has\n\ndiscovered in \"penumbras\" of the express rights, or has construed as\n\nbeing included in the Retained Rights Clause of the Ninth Amendment and,\n\nperhaps, even in the Blessings of Liberty phrase of the Preamble to the\n\nConstitution.[xxxvii]\n\nIV.\n\nMuch remains that is new and remarkable about the American founding, but\n\nthe occasion does not allow for a fuller statement.\n\nThe most noteworthy structures of the Constitution, the separation\n\nof powers and attendant system of checks and balances organizing the central\n\nbranches of the national government, and the division of powers between\n\nthe national government and the several states in the intricate web constitutive\n\nof the federal system especially deserve mention, of course.\n\nIn the spirit of this presentation, I would be remiss if I did not stress\n\nthat the theory of human nature that underlies the separation of powers and\n\nchecks and balances mechanism is its secret.\n\nTrue enough, it is an old secret, one going back to Aristotle’s Politics\n\nwhere the philosopher weighs the argument that \"the rule of law…is\n\npreferable to that of any individual…. Therefore he who bids the law rule may\n\nbe deemed to bid God and Reason alone rule, but he who bids the\n\nman rule adds an element of the beast; for desire is a wild beast and\n\npassion perverts the minds of rulers, even when they are the best of men.\n\nThe law is reason unaffected by desire…. [A] man may be a safer ruler\n\nthan the written law, but not safer than the customary law.\"[xxxviii]\n\nThe question so strikingly answered by the American founders was\n\nhow to arrive at a government of laws and not of men when there were only men\n\navailable to rule. Their estimate\n\nof human nature was as well informed as was Aristotle’s, and they understood\n\nwhat Acton would later express in the maxim that \"Power corrupts and\n\nabsolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Publius\n\nin The Federalist Papers writes of the fallibility of men, of their\n\ntendency to favor their own causes, and in a famous passage asks:\n\nwhat is government itself\n\nbut the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\n\nIf men were angels, no government would be necessary.\n\nIf angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on\n\ngovernment would be necessary. In\n\nframing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great\n\ndifficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the\n\ngoverned; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\n\nA dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the\n\ngovernment; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary\n\nprecautions.[xxxix]\n\nPrimary\n\nreliance is upon a virtuous and civic-minded people–but \"prudence\"\n\nrequires something more than this, Publius wrote.\n\nThe \"system\" is not so perfect that no one will have to be\n\ngood; the system is a back-up, expressly an \"auxiliary\" precaution.\n\nNo utopian expectations here! Its\n\nmechanism takes seriously the understanding of human nature as it comes from the\n\nclassic philosophers and is enriched with Christian teaching about the willful\n\nselfishness of human beings in their fallen sinful state.\n\nMan is viewed as capable of virtue but inclined to vice and to favoring\n\nhis own cause whenever he has the opportunity to do so.[xl] The\n\nmechanism addresses just this fallible human material,\n\nby pitting rival ambition against rival ambition in persons occupying\n\neach of the three major branches of government which overlap, Legislative,\n\nExecutive, and Judicial. This major\n\ninnovation is an entirely new conception of separation of powers. It is one\n\ndirectly to be contrasted to that found in the French Constitution of 1791 where\n\nthe separation is adopted without the checks and balances, thereby making the\n\nlegislature supreme (rule by law) and cutting-off possibility of judicial review\n\nas it developed in America as a key to rule of law as a practical matter.[xli]\n\nUnder our Constitution, the ambitiously striving persons, then, are given\n\nthe constitutional means in each instance of resisting encroachments overweening\n\nambition is inclined to seek on others’ authority.\n\nIt is in the interest of each to repel encroachment or suffer the\n\ndiminishment of one’s own power and authority: thereby, \"the private\n\ninterest of every individual [becomes] a sentinel over the public rights.\"\n\nThrough these checks of ambition counteracting ambition, a three-way\n\ncancellation process is effected in the normal operations of the machinery of\n\ngovernment.\n\nThe \"rival interests,\" Publius wrote, supply the\n\n\"defect of better motives.\"\n\nEspecially ambition (John Adams called it the desire for emulation)\n\ndrives political man, and this lends vigor to the institutions of government,\n\nbut control is requisite.[xlii]\n\nBecause of the ingenuity of institutional design channeling adversarial\n\ninterplay, a noble residue of reason and justice is the outcome of normal\n\noperations. Passion is sufficiently\n\nblunted that a government of laws under moderately favorable circumstances\n\nbecomes a realistic possibility. The\n\nconstitutional equilibrium achieved by the mixed constitution of rival estates\n\nin Britain is supplanted in potentially egalitarian America by a new set of\n\nequivalences that function to similar purpose.\n\nIn Edward S. Corwin’s words, the \"opposition…between the desire of\n\nthe human governor and the reason of the law lies, indeed, at the foundation of\n\nthe American interpretation of the doctrine of separation of powers and so of\n\nthe entire system of constitutional law.\"[xliii]\n\nBorn of a philosophically sound view of man, society, and history that\n\nmaintained a clear vision of the tension structuring reality toward transcendent\n\ndivine Being, the civic consciousness whose long experience in self-government\n\nand robust common sense made possible the American founding seems, in many\n\nrespects, a unique growth. And it\n\nis both fragile and perishable, as was known from the beginning.\n\nWe have a republic, but can we keep it?–to recall the question asked\n\nBenjamin Franklin as he left the Convention after its work finally was done.\n\nUrgent questions impose themselves.\n\nIs the American founders’ political vision so exceptional as to be\n\nimpossible to propagate today in alien soil, especially in a world paradoxically\n\nhungry for the blessings of liberty and rule of law but bafflingly plagued by a\n\nnihilistic disdain for the hard-won insights of faith, history, and reason?\n\nWill Jacobinism yet carry the day?\n\nHas virulent social amnesia at long last so overwhelmed the mind of\n\nAmerica today as to make it forgetful of its very self?\n\nThe blunt question a Czech friend recently asked must give us pause:\n\n\"Are you going to win the Cold War and lose your own country?\"\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1]*\n\nCopyright (c) 1993 by Ellis Sandoz.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n[i]\n\nQuoted from T.
