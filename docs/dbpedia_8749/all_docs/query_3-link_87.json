        "text": "Introduction\n\nMichael Franz\n\nEric Voegelin (1901-1985) is widely regarded as one of the greatest political philosophers of the 20th century, yet adequate understanding of his writings is not a standing accomplishment but rather a challenge for current and future generations. Voegelin’s thought continued to develop at a rapid pace during the last two decades of his life, and as Ellis Sandoz has written, his work found not only its final but its most profound expression during this period. Voegelin’s standing as a philosopher was based mostly on his many books and the laudatory review articles published in response to them, but he was preeminently an essayist, as Sandoz observed. The meditative analyses and essays written in the culminating phase of Voegelin’s career not only expand and deepen his work as a whole, but also revise central components of it in ways that compel reconsideration of even his most widely read texts.\n\nVoegelin’s books gave rise to a vast secondary literature that continues to grow, yet the exceptionally impactful late essays and meditative works have never received the scholarly commentaries they deserve. These writings were published originally as journal articles or chapters in edited collections, and unlike books, such publications are almost never reviewed in scholarly journals, regardless of their quality or importance. This volume remedies that shortcoming in the secondary literature with 14 critical analyses that elucidate the late essays while also addressing their implications for the entirety of Voegelin’s thought. We believe these commentaries will prove quite valuable to students and scholars in political science, philosophy, history, theology, and other disciplines, serving as a companion piece to the singularly important Vol. 12 of Voegelin’s Collected Works, Published Essays 1966-1985.¹\n\nThat volume was edited by Ellis Sandoz, a friend to many contributors to this book, who passed away just as this manuscript was going to the printer. In addition to editing Vol. 12, Sandoz also wrote a concise but profound Editor’s Introduction summarizing Voegelin’s thought during this final phase of his work. Because our collaborative volume is a companion piece to that volume of the Collected Works, I shall simply direct readers to Sandoz’s Introduction without undertaking a second summary of Voegelin’s late work here, though I will address several questions prompted by points raised by Sandoz below. He chose not to address the Voegelin essays included in Vol. 12 in any detail, which is precisely our objective in the chapters that follow, so the complementary nature of the two books should be evident.\n\nAn account in this Introduction that might be helpful to readers of this book as well as Voegelin’s Published Essays 1966-1985 is one addressing the ongoing challenges posed by his writings as a whole. This will help illuminate why the late essays and meditations are so important, and why critical commentaries on them can prove essential for understanding the entirety of Voegelin’s work.\n\nA first challenge of obvious importance is the sheer breadth of Voegelin’s oeuvre. The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin (hereafter, CWEV)—consisting of 34 volumes—have already been published in their entirety. Some books in the collection are rather compact, whereas others run to nearly 1,000 pages. Similarly, some of the writings are admirably accessible, but many require painstaking study even by readers who are accustomed to working with demanding philosophical texts and who have already familiarized themselves with a sizeable portion of Voegelin’s writing. Much of the material in the Collected Works required translation from the original German, and much of it was not published before appearing in the collection, including some writings of lofty importance that Voegelin simply left in his wake as he pressed ahead to new writings employing developing approaches or new source materials. Completion of the Collected Works publication project was an achievement that is invaluable for anyone wishing to access Voegelin’s philosophizing, yet accessing the writings is hardly the same as understanding them adequately.\n\nA related challenge is that the scope of Voegelin’s work cannot be grasped by simply counting published pages or volumes. He read and worked in nine languages across many different disciplines while addressing historical and philosophical materials ranging from the Neolithic period to the late 20th century. His erudition was astonishing—even to his few true peers—and it is hardly surprising that specialists of all sorts have strained to cope with the sheer scope of his work and the multiplicity of its wellsprings.\n\nA third source of difficulty is that Voegelin’s books and articles are filled with neologisms, as he experimented constantly with different concepts and terms drawn from his sources or simply invented outright. This peculiarity poses great difficulties for newcomers, and the caliber of the problem can be appreciated when one learns that the editors of Voegelin’s Collected Works elected to provide a glossary in the final volume—one that runs for 37 pages.\n\nA final factor of great importance is that Voegelin’s body of writings is highly variegated internally, with at least two major transformations in his thinking producing breaks in his publishing program. Exactly how major these breaks should be considered is a matter for dispute between reasonable and well-informed observers,² but the fact of the first break is clear, and Voegelin’s characterizations of the second one are quite striking.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1954, he wrote a massive History of Political Ideas, but then abandoned the manuscript (published posthumously in 8 volumes) due to shifts in his thinking and advances in his methodology. Voegelin’s new approach informed the first three volumes of his magnum opus, Order and History, published in 1956 and 1957, with an Introduction promising three more volumes to come.\n\nHowever, Voegelin elected not to publish Volume IV, The Ecumenic Age, until 1974, and the first sentence of the book announced that it, \"breaks with the program I have developed for Order and History\" (CWEV, Vol. 17, p. 45). Both transformations in Voegelin’s work are quite tricky in the sense that, on one hand, much of the content and many of the principles underlying earlier writings remain valid in light of later works. Yet, on the other hand, Voegelin had very good reasons for abandoning (his term) his earlier approaches. The most important consequence of the two breaks for readers today is this: it is impossible for a reader to distinguish what remains valid in early works from what has been discarded without mastering all Voegelin’s writings, and this is true above all for writings from the last two decades (which, as we’ve seen, Sandoz characterized as the period when Voegelin’s work attained not only its final but its most profound expression).\n\nThe books that Voegelin published during his last twenty years were widely reviewed, but as noted above, this was not the case for book chapters or journal articles. Our lack of a secondary literature on Voegelin’s late essays and meditative writings would not stand as a major problem if they were mere side-projects of minor importance by comparison to the books. But that is not the case at all. Indeed, as Sandoz wrote in his Editor’s Introduction to Vol. 12, Voegelin was, Preeminently an essayist. . ..³ Similarly, Paul Caringella and Thomas Hollweck observe that, It can be argued whether Voegelin was a book author in the commonly used sense. His method consisted rather in working out problems in the form of reflective and meditative essays; only when the problems could be arranged in meaningful clusters would he organize them into a book.⁴\n\nSandoz, Caringella, and Hollweck are three of the four members of the Editorial Board to which Voegelin assigned his literary estate, so their authority seems well established. The passages just quoted not only emphasize the importance of essays as Voegelin’s primary mode of theoretical expression but also counsel against granting privileged status to his last books, which can be thought of as collections of essays regarding discrete problems that were published together only because they could be arranged in meaningful clusters.\n\nBy extension, this suggests that essays that didn’t fit with other writings were best published as freestanding journal articles or as chapters in edited collections. These writings from the final decades of Voegelin’s work are not categorically less important than the studies that were clustered into Voegelin’s last books, and indeed, some of them clearly hold greater salience regarding central problems or new directions in Voegelin’s evolving work than chapters in the last of the books he saw through to publication.\n\nFor example, with regard to Voegelin’s mature understanding of Christianity, the late essays, The Gospel and Culture, and, Immortality: Experience and Symbol are both arguably more illuminating than The Pauline Vision of the Resurrected, Chapter 5 from Voegelin’s The Ecumenic Age. This is not to disparage the chapter on The Pauline Vision, which fits with the other studies in The Ecumenic Age because it focuses on St. Paul and contributes to the meaningful cluster of essays in a book addressing a specific historical period. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the broader scope of The Gospel and Culture, and, Immortality: Experience and Symbol make them seem more important for those seeking a general understanding of the status of Christianity within Voegelin’s philosophy.\n\nA second example is in order. My commentary for this volume analyzes Voegelin’s essay, Wisdom and the Magic of the Extreme: A Meditation. This extended piece (60 pages in the Collected Works edition) is by far the most important diagnostic analysis of ideology and spiritual disorder published by Voegelin after The New Science of Politics. Its importance springs principally from how clearly it shows Voegelin breaking from the analysis and conceptual framework employed in The New Science, Voegelin’s single most famous book (to which Time magazine devoted a cover story on March 9, 1953).⁵\n\nIn the late Wisdom and Magic essay, Voegelin dispenses entirely with the general concept of Gnosticism that was central to his diagnosis of modern ideological violence and spiritual disorder in The New Science. Moreover, he discards the argument of The New Science that later gnostics arose by means of literary influence from earlier gnostic writers or the historical Gnostics themselves. He replaces this in the Wisdom and Magic essay with a much more sophisticated and compelling explanation of instances of spiritual disorder as largely independent outbursts of rebellion against perennial experiences and challenges posed by the human condition.\n\nThis Introduction is not the place to explain advances such as this one fully, as that challenge is taken up in the pages that follow, including my Chapter 13 on the Wisdom and Magic meditation. However, it is simple enough to indicate the importance of the advances pointed to in the preceding paragraphs. For example, writings about Voegelin’s theory of Gnosticism continue to be published under the sway of The New Science as though that book remains the last word in Voegelin’s analysis of personal and political disorders and ideologies (and their relation to modes of revolt against the political limitations of human existence from earlier eras). Yet the reality I seek to demonstrate in my commentary is that The New Science is not only not the last word from Voegelin on this complex of problems, but also an outmoded approach that is conceptually, methodologically, and theoretically inferior to the analysis in the Wisdom and Magic meditation.\n\nThis observation highlights another theoretical benefit provided by the commentaries assembled in this new collection, which is that they are mutually reinforcing. Voegelin’s late advances in epistemology and the theory of consciousness are vital underpinnings for the breakthroughs to be found in his Wisdom and Magic meditation, but these advances are mostly implicit in Wisdom and Magic, whereas they are powerfully illuminated by Voegelin’s, Equivalences of Experience and Symbolization in History, as Glenn Hughes shows in his commentary. Similarly, the developmental process that led to Voegelin’s work in the theory of consciousness is clarified greatly by the autobiographical account in Voegelin’s, Remembrance of Things Past, as Paul Kidder indicates by reference to Husserl and phenomenology in ways that contribute very importantly to his commentary while also bolstering my analysis of Wisdom and Magic. As a final example, Reason: The Classic Experience offers Voegelin’s clearest expression of the core of his thought in its most fully developed phase, and William Petropulos’s commentary on it can illuminate all the other chapters in this book while also enabling readers who are new to Voegelin’s work to advance quickly toward a substantial understanding of one of the 20th century’s most penetrating but notoriously challenging political philosophers.\n\nTo ward off any suspicions that I’m making extravagant claims for the commentaries in this volume, I’ll utilize a term already employed, hastening to emphasize that they are not intended to be the last word on the essays they analyze. I have already indicated my reservations about Sandoz’s assertion that there is \". . .no dislocating break in Voegelin’s thought. . .after publication of The New Science of Politics in 1952. . ., but rather than considering that issue resolved in my favor, my intention is to aid readers in exploring the issue for themselves. I believe this relatively modest intention is shared by all my colleagues in their contributions to this collection, even though some chapters include some rather bold assertions forwarded either by argument or implication. To place my own chapter in the crosshairs as a potential target once again, it offers a sustained and multi-faceted case that Sandoz was essentially mistaken when maintaining that . . .Voegelin refined but never abandoned the theory of gnosticism’s role in philosophy and history that he so powerfully advanced. . . .\"⁶ My case is forcefully stated and so too is Sandoz’s argument, but neither is forceful enough to simply blow down the other. Nor should such matters be determined by which view is stated most emphatically, as I’m confident Sandoz would have agreed, based on my many years of friendship with him. The point is to encourage readers to mine the riches contained in Voegelin’s late writings with critical perspectives and hypotheses in their tool kits, and if there are multiple and contending perspectives available to readers, so much the better.\n\nTo extend this notion one last time while relying on my friendship with Sandoz when addressing an issue on which we differ, I understand but still depart from his observation that, Voegelin was a very steady character, one can say. Sandoz was surely correct that one can find a continuity of intention across the last three decades of Voegelin’s life.⁷ However, when considering Voegelin’s particularities as a philosopher by comparison to other thinkers, I’m far less inclined to emphasize his steadiness than his relentlessness as a theoretical searcher and his remorselessness in being willing to change course when his searches revealed new approaches that were superior to past ones—even when his fame rested on the earlier approaches he abandoned. Above all else, it is this remarkable characteristic of Eric Voegelin as a philosopher that makes meticulous and critical consideration of his last writings an essential undertaking for anyone who wishes to do justice to him as a reader.\n\nWhen offering thanks to those who made this book possible, clearly my fellow contributors come immediately to mind, yet none of our chapters would have seen the light of day without the steadfast support of Benjamin Fingerhut of St. Augustine’s Press and his late father, Bruce Fingerhut. This project has taken far longer to complete than I anticipated when I first conceived of it, recruited collaborators for it, and proposed it to Bruce Fingerhut. His reply to my detailed proposal began with the exceedingly kind and relieving sentence, Of course, we will publish this work. Benjamin has been as resolute and enthusiastic about the project as his father, and all of us are gratefully indebted to both of them.\n\nThe book benefitted greatly from the assistance of Paulette Kidder, author of Chapter 11, who generously devoted much of a sabbatical to editorial work on the manuscript that involved much more than simply correcting typographical errors and moving commas around. Producing a reasonably consistent manuscript from chapter drafts submitted by contributors from multiple nations and academic disciplines who write in quite different styles is no small feat. Paulette commented on many matters of substance in her work with me, also fighting through the tedium of checking hundreds of quotations for accuracy. Any errors that remain are entirely my responsibility, but I might well have nothing for which to take responsibility if not for all her graciously contributed help. The total of her efforts is surely equal to what would have been required for her to write another entire chapter.\n\nThomas Heilke and Paul Kidder both stepped up to take on very sizeable writing assignments—after completing their initial chapters—when that became necessary because other authors encountered difficulties preventing them from completing their work. It may seem odd to liken them to defibrillators, but I’m certain that anyone who has had something they care deeply about jump-started by others will recognize this for the high compliment that it is. Amy Wolfson of Loyola University Maryland helped me with an unusually generous sabbatical that enabled me to tackle the most difficult phase of the project, and David Walsh slated panels at two meetings of the Eric Voegelin Society to permit contributors to work together and build momentum for this enterprise.\n\nOver the years I have been helped by so many people—and learned so much from so many scholars—that I cannot thank all of them here. Hopefully I’ve managed to express my appreciation along the way, but a few individuals deserve mention in any case. Reading this Introduction could lead one to believe that Ellis Sandoz and I were at odds regarding Voegelin’s work when almost nothing could be further from the truth. This will become apparent (even regarding matters such as continuity in Voegelin’s thought disputed here) to anyone who reads my Editor’s Introduction to Voegelin’s The Ecumenic Age, Vol. III of Order and History, which shows we agreed about most issues of prodigious importance (aside from but including our agreement that Hermitage from the Rhône Valley is the world’s finest wine for pairing with roasted goose). To his great credit and the benefit of all who contributed to this volume, Sandoz advanced and broadened appreciation of Voegelin’s thought in the English-speaking world more than anyone else. Special thanks are also owed to Sally Swift, James L. Wiser, Cathy Bruckbauer, Eugene Webb, Richard Boothby, Paul Caringella, Manfred Henningsen, Carsten Vala, Stephen A. McKnight, Barry Cooper, Klaus Vondung, and the late John A. Gueguen.\n\n1 Eric Voegelin, Published Essays 1966-1985, Vol. 12 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin (Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, Ellis Sandoz, ed., 1990). Hereafter cited as CWEV Vol. 12.\n\n2 For example, Sandoz wrote in his Editor’s Introduction that \"It is worth stressing that no dislocating break in Voegelin’s thought occurred after publication of The New Science of Politics in 1952; that work signaled the watershed in the philosopher’s thinking. . . .Voegelin was a very steady character, one can say (Editor’s Introduction,\" CWEV Vol. 12, xi-xxii, xiv). I do not share this view. Of course, I understand that what constitutes a full dislocation in a philosopher’s work is a matter of interpretation rather than a demonstrable fact, as when an orthopedic radiologist points to an x-ray showing bones disconnected from a joint socket. However, in my assessment, the change in Voegelin’s thinking in the wake of his immersion in the philosophy of consciousness and set forth in Anamnesis, manifested in The Ecumenic Age, and pursued in various ways in the late essays and meditations does indeed stand as a major shift from the foundation underlying The New Science of Politics. I will pursue this point more fully below.\n\n3 Ibid., xiii.\n\n4 Editors’ Introduction, Thomas A. Hollweck and Paul Caringella, in What is History? And other Late Unpublished Writings, CWEV Vol. 28 (Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1990), xi–xxxvi, here at xv.\n\n5 Journalism and Joachim’s Children, Time, March 9, 1953, 57–61.\n\n6 Sandoz, Editor’s Introduction, CWEV Vol. 12, xi.\n\n7 Ibid., xiv.\n\n1\n\nVoegelin’s The German University and the Order of German Society: A Reconsideration of the Nazi Era\n\nBarry Cooper\n\nOn two occasions, in the summer semester, 1964 and then two years later, Eric Voegelin delivered formal lectures to a German audience regarding Hitler. This paper deals chiefly with the second of these, The German University and the Order of German Society: A Reconsideration of the Nazi Era.¹ The contents of Voegelin’s lecture, however, presuppose a familiarity with the argument of the earlier series of talks, now published as Hitler and the Germans.² Accordingly, reference must be made to the 1964 series as well.\n\nThe central German experiential problem of our time, Voegelin said in 1964, was Hitler’s rise to power. How was it possible? What consequences does it have today?³ The theoretical approach was indicated by a term used in The New Science of Politics. Voegelin would apply Plato’s anthropological principle to the German problems in order to analyze what sort of persons the Germans were to have chosen an individual such as Hitler to represent them.⁴ Voegelin initially formulated the problem in terms of stupidity, or to use the more sonorous German term, Dummheit, with which, Schiller reminds us, even the gods struggle in vain.⁵\n\nVoegelin began his analysis by considering the response to a discussion by Albert Wucher in the Süddeutsche Zeitung of the attempt by Percy E. Schramm, a celebrated professor of medieval history, to present an account of Hitler in the pages of Der Spiegel.⁶ Wucher summarized Schramm’s effort as one of systematically excluding relevant facts and interpretations that would allow readers to understand Hitler’s personality. The journalist wondered why Professor Schramm proceeded in this fashion, which provoked a number of responses as letters to the editor of the Süddeutsche. Wucher was right, wrote Hilde Seitz, and Schramm was naïve: the real problem was that Hitler was elected and that he was popular. Voegelin agreed. That was the real problem. Wilfred Wiegand wrote that he did not consider millions of Germans to be stupid (Dummköpfen) but that is just what Wucher implied. Voegelin remarked: If Hitler was stupid or a criminal, and the people voted for him in droves, then they too must have been stupid and criminal. But that is not possible, so Hitler was not stupid and no criminal.⁷ Some other explanation therefore had to be found for Hitler’s success. Wiegand refused to consider seriously the possibility that Wucher was correct and that a very great number of Germans were in fact extraordinarily stupid and/or criminal. Voegelin called this resistance to considering such a question, let alone answering it properly, the Buttermelcher Syndrome named after a Munich street, Buttermelcherstrasse, where another letter-writer, Gerhard Hess, who made the same point, lived.\n\nA few weeks later Wucher reported on a panel discussion, which included Schramm, on the theme Hitler as Alibi, sponsored by the Congress for Cultural Freedom. Here the learned participants discussed several alternative explanations for Hitler’s success. Perhaps Hitler was just an accident, or perhaps he had a demonic personality. Perhaps a lot of other things, but one way or another, it seemed, the Germans had to be absolved from responsibility. One of the panelists, Wlademar Besson, a political scientist from the University of Erlangen, raised the possibility that Hitler was not so much a demonic personality as an idiot. To this possibility Schramm replied that it would be a frightening realization for 70 million Germans to learn they followed an idiot. Such resistance by Schramm, Voegelin observed, was a further manifestation of the Buttermelcher Syndrome. Moreover, there was something to Besson’s characterization, \"[f]or this problem of the idiot ultimately is related to the problem of the stultus, of the fool in the technical sense.\"⁸ The problem that caught Voegelin’s attention was how Hitler could be a stultus and a successful, even a brilliant, politician.\n\nThe Buttermelcher Syndrome shared by letter-writers Gerhard Hess and Wilfred Wiegand, and the distinguished historian, Percy Schramm, was said to be a particular example of the alleged unmastered past of the Germans. Voegelin then argued that this familiar term was a cliché designed precisely to avoid serious analysis. If one asks, for whom is the past unmastered? the problem is clarified in the sense that the past, specifically the Nazi past, was mastered by very many persons while it was still the present, since by no means did all those who experienced the period of National Socialism cheerfully cooperate with it.⁹ Some persons, Voegelin included, knew precisely what was going on so that the past was a completely masterable present for the people who lived at that time.¹⁰ Percy Schramm, employed by the Wehrmacht High Command and before that the incumbent of an important chair at the University of Göttingen and later chancellor of the order Pour le Mérite, was apparently unable to know what was going on. For Voegelin, however, there was a continuity between the cheerful cooperation of Schramm in the past with the National Socialist regime and his present position as an esteemed historian. Accordingly, \"we live in an unmastered present,\" the symptoms of which are the Buttermelcher Syndrome and other kinds of Dummheit.¹¹\n\nIn order to understand clichés such as the unmastered past or the concept of the Buttermelcher syndrome or the realities of an unmastered present and the political success of a stultus, these things must be examined in light of philosophical anthropology, or an idea of man, the most adequate accounts of which, Voegelin said, were discovered in Hellenic and Israelite societies. The reality of an unmastered present, for example, has to be considered in the light of its transcendent dimension, which Voegelin called the presence under God, and referred to the myths of judgment in the Gorgias and the Republic as adequate expressions of what he had in mind.¹² Voegelin then summarized the first three volumes of Order and History: \"In the Hellenic society, man was experienced by the philosophers of the classical period as a being who is constituted by the nous, by reason. In the Israelite society man is experienced as the being to whom God speaks his word, that is, as a pneumatic [spiritual] being who is open to God’s word. Methodologically, then, reason and spirit were the two modes in which human being was constituted. That seems to be the definitive discovery.\"¹³ Whether symbolized as reason or as spirit, human being experienced itself as a being that participated in the divine, whether zetetically or by an encounter with the Word. Such experiences, Voegelin said, constitute the basis of human dignity.\n\nIt followed that the loss of human dignity arose from the denial of human participation in the divine. And because such participation was essential to the constitution of human being, dedivinizing is always followed by dehumanizing, much as the speculative Gnostic murder of God has been followed by the activist Gnostic murder of human beings, as Voegelin argued on many occasions. Once a person had closed himself off from the noetically or pneumatically symbolized experience of the divine, and refused to participate, there occurs a loss of reality, insofar as this divine being, this ground of being, is indeed reality too.¹⁴ The typical manifestation of the loss of reality has been, historically, to substitute a diminished or shrunken human reality for the Divine Ground of Being.¹⁵\n\nA number of consequences followed. First, because of a loss of reality, a human being becomes unable properly to orient his or her action in the world. Accordingly, he acts stupidly. In the language of Psalm 14, \"the fool (nabal = stultus) hath said in his heart, There is no God.\" In the language of Plato, the stupid person was amathes (Rep., 350c; 409d; 467c). Because the fool acted on the basis of his defective image of reality, he caused disorder. Second, once having lost the experience of certain sectors of reality, such a person also has lost the language to characterize and evoke reality. That means that parallel to the loss of reality and to stupidity there is always the phenomenon of illiteracy.¹⁶ There followed Voegelin’s witty demonstration of the illiteracy of Schramm that relied on the literacy of their contemporary, Karl Kraus.\n\nVoegelin warned his audience that terms such as stupidity and illiteracy (along with ignorance, rabble, and several others) were not terms of abuse but of concrete description. He then turned to Musil’s 1937 essay, On Stupidity, which began with a commonsensical understanding of stupidity as an incapacity to perform a task that would, by normal expectations and conventions, be resolvable in a particular social and historical context. Thus, [w]hat in one society and one historical situation has to be considered as stupid, in another situation may perhaps be described as clever.¹⁷ Musil further distinguished between the simple, straightforward, or honorable stupidity of one who has what one calls a ‘dim wit’ and a higher or intelligent stupidity. Here the problem was not so much lack of intelligence as failure of intelligence for the reason that it presumes to accomplishments to which is has no right.¹⁸ With intelligent stupidity therefore one found a kind of spiritual arrogance or a disturbance in the equilibrium of the spirit of which the intelligently stupid one was never unaware.¹⁹ That is, intelligent stupidity was a pneumopathological condition.²⁰ This was why Voegelin several times insisted: there is no right to be stupid.\n\nWe need not consider the details of Voegelin’s delightful demolition of Schramm nor his account of how the German academics, church-personnel, and lawyers descended into a spiritual abyss by embracing the pneumopathological second reality embodied in Hitler.²¹ Rather, let us consider Voegelin’s remarks in Part II, Toward a Restoration of Order. Here his focus was on the more agreeable sectors of society, those very interesting Germans who did not cheerfully participate in crimes. The analytical tool for discussing this problem was the distinction between first and second reality, which he also borrowed from Musil. In commonsense language, Voegelin distinguished between the frame of human existence, as he put it in a letter to Robert Heilman, and ideology.²² Second realities may have been differentiated and identified by contemporary German-speaking thinkers, but the reality so indicated was both older and more general.²³\n\nVoegelin began his analysis not with Musil and Doderer but with an earlier example of an author responding to social disorder and disruption by evoking a fictional or at least a non-existent second reality. His first examples were from the early sixteenth to the seventeenth century, often referred to as the waning of the middle ages, to use the title of Huizinga’s great book. Voegelin identified Thomas More’s Utopia as an instance that contrasted the existing evil social conditions of England with the true moral order sketched in More’s book.²⁴ Rabelais’ Gargantua and Pantagruel belongs to this same period of transition and loss of reality, but Voegelin’s main discussion centered on Cervantes’ Don Quixote.\n\nThe overarching problem Cervantes addressed in his satire was the decay or obsolescence of chivalry under the new conditions created by the nation-state. He structured his novel in terms of Don Quixote’s three expeditions. In the first expedition the Don was a knight errant who in the spirit of chivalry sought, outside legal conventions, to assist the humble and humble the proud. He was alone and he retained more than a sense of justice: he wanted to rid the world of injustice. Moreover, he was indulged in his buffoonery as was illustrated by the tolerance of the innkeeper and his patrons. No one started a quarrel with the Don by challenging his fantasies of the basis of commonsense reality.²⁵ The Don’s world, as Voegelin’s friend Alfred Schütz said, contained all the elements of Greek theology at the time of Homer: the envy of the gods, their intervention in favor of their protégés, their struggle for power, the subjection under inevitable fate.²⁶\n\nThe second expedition, where the Don was joined by his squire, Sancho Panza, was more complicated because Sancho lived in first reality, commonsensical reality, or paramount reality as Schütz, following William James, called it. Accordingly, Sancho warned the Don that he was about to tilt at windmills, not giants, as the Don maintained. In order to communicate at all—because windmills were not in fact giants—Cervantes introduced a third party, the enchanters or transformers who could change windmills into giants for Don Quixote. And, of course, if they later turned out only to be windmills, this meant the magicians had been at work turning giants back into windmills. For Voegelin, the interesting aspect of this new situation explored by Cervantes was that commonsensical Sancho was willing to make concessions at least to the extent that, perhaps, magicians were involved after all. As the novel continued, Sancho lived increasingly in the second reality of the Don and thereby became increasingly imbecilic or stupid (blöd) as well as a fellow-traveler and collaborator in the Don’s enterprise.\n\nBy the time of the third expedition, detailed in the second volume of the novel, Cervantes’ audience had become familiar with his characters. Readers had come to expect a certain type of behavior from Sancho and the Don. This changed circumstance allowed Cervantes to introduce another ring of subscribers to the second reality. Sancho was persuaded to abandon his common sense because of the exalted social status of Don Quixote. On the third expedition, the two of them encountered a duke and a duchess who, as fictional readers of Cervantes’ fiction, knew all about these two characters. The two presumptively real readers of Cervantes’ real novel then entered into the second reality of the Don and made fun of him. By Voegelin’s interpretation, Cervantes was indicating that the bored, unemployed, and useless Spanish nobility made of his story a divertissement to entertain themselves. Voegelin used the Pascalian term to indicate how a real social class, the Spanish aristocracy, was prepared to enter the second reality because it was fun and was an alternative to the experiences of boredom and ennui that otherwise useless aristocrats would have to endure. Under later circumstances, Voegelin said, revolutionaries would likewise engage in intellectual stupidity because it constituted a divertissement from their otherwise boring lives.²⁷\n\nThe implications were clear enough. First, second realities, whether that of the Don or of a contemporary ideologue (think of the importance of environmentalism today) can become socially dominant. Then, as did the Don in his conversation with the canon (Part I, Ch. 50), one might introduce the argument from authority. After all, if what the Don said was repeated in books published under the king’s license, who would dare challenge that? Here Voegelin again referred to the Buttermelcher Syndrome. And then, in Part I, chapter 25 (p. 201), the Don declared: I imagine that everything I say is true, no more and no less. Thus does the second reality displace the first, which is followed necessarily by friction between the imaginary and the paramount.\n\nThe great challenge in the treatment of second reality from Cervantes to Musil and Doderer is the change from satire to farce (Burleske). The difference, for Voegelin, was that satire is still connected to reality whereas there is no connection to reality with the murderous imbecility (Mordsblödsinn) of latter corruption exemplified by National Socialism. By Voegelin’s interpretation, Karl Kraus certainly saw the problem of describing properly what social and spiritual corruption entailed, whereas Doderer and Musil go deeper, insofar as they represent the problem as farce. Politically speaking there existed a formal community who sought to live within the second reality. But such a society perpetuates the highest betrayal of humanity. And in this kind of society anyone who is not alienated from the first reality can only commit high treason.²⁸ Accordingly, the literary form best suited to imbecility, Blödsinn, which Voegelin later discussed in terms of a loss of reality, was farce, not satire.²⁹\n\nThe significance of these German-language novelists (and occasionally Voegelin added Broch, Gütersloh, Mann, and Canetti) is that they were perfectly capable of mastering the present by taking its measure either at the time or, in the case of Doderer, after the war. In this respect they were much more in touch with reality symbolized as reason and spirit than were the official guardians of Western culture in the churches and the legal and academic professions. Notwithstanding his achievements as a medievalist, Percy Schramm proved himself to be an ignoramus as well as the embodiment of Musil’s higher stupidity when it came to making sense of Hitler.³⁰"
