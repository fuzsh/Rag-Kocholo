A native of Louisiana whose family first came there from Switzerland in 1829, he was a United States Marine Corps veteran (1953-56). He was educated at LSU (B. A., 1951; M. A., 1953), the universities of North Carolina, Georgetown, Heidelberg, and the University of Munich where he completed his doctorate (Dr. oec. publ.)with Eric Voegelin in 1965, the only American to do so. He joined LSU’s faculty in 1978.\n\nProfessor Sandoz was a specialist in the field of political philosophy (American, European, and Russian), and he approaches problems of public policy from that perspective. President Ronald W. Reagan appointed him to the National Council on the Humanities in 1982 for a six-year term. The Board of Foreign Scholarships in 1987 named him a Fulbright 40th Anniversary Distinguished American Scholar to represent the United States in Italy and lecture on the Constitution during the Bicentennial.

He presented a series of lectures on the thought of Voegelin, ethics, and constitutionalism sponsored by the Graduate Program of Ethics of the University of Oslo and the Research Council of Norway in Trondheim in October 1995. He lectured widely in the U. S. and Canada on the contemporary crisis of civic consciousness, foundations of constitutionalism, and modern political philosophy. He was the first political scientist to be chosen LSU’s Distinguished Research Master and awarded the university’s Gold Medal; and “in recognition of high attainments in liberal scholarship,” in 1996 he became the first honorary member of LSU’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter. He was elected president of the Philadelphia Society in April 2000. In November 2002 Sandoz delivered the commencement address and was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor en Ciencias Políticasby the University Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala.
