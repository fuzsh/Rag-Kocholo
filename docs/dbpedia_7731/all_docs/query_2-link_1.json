Secretary General Kofi Annan, the pain of his passing is being felt intensely in St. Paul, where Annan got his start as a young student at Macalester College.\n\n“We are both shocked and deeply saddened. He seemed like one of those people that would go on forever,” said Brian Rosenberg, president of Macalester College, where Annan graduated in 1961.\n\nRosenberg first met Annan in 2004 and got to know the loyal alumnus and former Macalester trustee well as Annan returned several times over the years to speak at the college.\n\n“He was the clearest and most famous embodiment of our mission,” he said. “We feel like we’ve lost a little part of ourselves.”\n\nAnnan attended Macalester from 1959 to 1961, earning a degree in economics and setting a school track record in the 60-yard dash.\n\n“He was an outstanding orator,” Roger Mosvick, Annan’s former communications professor, told the Pioneer Press in 1998. “He was a very bright guy who had this ability to adapt to virtually any situation.”\n\nThis adeptness in speech contests, of which Annan won several, would serve him well as he went on to join the the United Nations’ World Health Organization in 1962 and later became the U.N.’s secretary-general — a post where he had to react to crisis situations, wars and controversy.\n\nBorn to a family of chiefs of the Fante tribe in Ghana, his father was a businessman and provincial governor and his mother was a homemaker. While studying at Ghana’s University of Science and Technology, Annan was offered a scholarship from the Ford Foundation’s Foreign Students Leadership Project. It was this opportunity that brought him to St. Paul. In 1959, he left Ghana to study economics at Macalester. This was his first trip out of Africa and into another culture.\n\nAnnan never forgot the warm welcome he received in the cold state of Minnesota.\n\nIn a speech in 1994, he described his feelings for Macalester: “We were not merely greeted with tolerance, we were welcomed with warmth.”\n\nAnnan returned to the college several times over the years to give commencement speeches. In May he was honored by the college when it renamed its Institute for Global Citizenship as the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship.\n\n“He was obviously an enormous source of pride for us,” Rosenberg said. “I’m really glad he was able to be here and celebrate that with us.”\n\nFellow student Jack Mason, who became a U.S. magistrate judge and passed away in 2002, was on the speech team with Annan in 1961.\n\nMason told the Pioneer Press in 1998 that the team would pile into a car and drive all over the state for contests, but the traveling and lack of sleep never seemed to bother Annan.\n\n“Kofi would get out of the car … and he’d be so eloquent and give these speeches that were really something,” Mason said.\n\nThat would be another quality Annan would retain throughout his career has he jetted all over the world to give speeches representing the United Nations.\n\nDavid Lanegran, a former professor of geography at Macalester and a member of the graduating class of 1963, said there was one thing Annan was not good at: American football.\n\n“He could not catch the football to save his soul,” Lanegran told the Pioneer Press in 1998. “I think he had one of the shorter football careers at Macalester.”\n\nIn 1984, Annan married Nane Lagergren, a Swedish-born attorney and abstract painter who is the niece of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat in Hungary who saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis. Together they had three children.\n\nBesides Annan’s abilities and accomplishments, what folks from Macalester remember most about him was his humility.\n\nRosenberg said the humble foreign student from Africa who grew up to become one of the most powerful men in the world never changed in character.\n\n“The most impressive thing about Kofi Annan was that he was even more impressive in private than he was in public,” Rosenberg said. “He never acted like he was more important than you.”\n\nWhen Annan and his wife visited in May, Rosenberg was reminded again of his friend’s humility when Annan asked for a member of the custodial staff who cleaned the guest house to come see him so he could thank him.\n\n“He took a picture with him,” Rosenberg said. “It really kind of captured the kind of person that he was.”\n\nAs the college processes the passing of its most famous son, Rosenberg has found himself thinking back over their many conversations through the years and still being inspired by Annan.\n\n“His faith in the future gives me faith in the future,” Rosenberg said. “He and I taped one interview that we have not yet released. One of the last things he talked about was that change is hard and change takes time. It takes persistence. Sometimes that’s difficult for all of us to remember. I would want to thank him for reminding me of that. If anyone had the right to be frustrated, it would be him. But he never gave up. He just kept working.”\n\nKofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations, on May 7, 2018, speaks at a reception celebrating the 30th anniversary of Books for Africa, a St. Paul-based nonprofit that collects and ships books to that continent.
