        "text": "The Beginning\n\nKofi Annan was a diplomat from Ghana who served as the secretary general of the United Nations. As a young child Kofi Annan loved to learn. He was born on April 8, 1938 in Kumasi, Gold Coast. There he attended Mfantsipim boarding school. Ironically he graduated in 1957 which is the same year the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain and changed their name to Ghana. After this point he attended Macalester in 1961 with a degree in economics. Even that wasn’t enough learning for Kofi so he traveled all the way to Geneva, Switzerland and from 1961 to 1962 he completed his graduate work. Later in 1972 he earned a Masters of Science in management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Biography.com).\n\nStart of His Career\n\nAlthough the immense education Kofi received is impressive, I believe his acts as a member of the UN speak volumes of what he stands for. His journey in the UN started in 1962 where he was placed as a budget officer for the World Humanitarian Organization (UN-Kofi Annan). From this point on all he could do is move up the ranks. From 1992-1996 he worked under the secretary general for peacekeeping. While in this position he aided with solutions to the Rwanda Genocide and Bosnia Massacre. Sadly, the Rwanda Genocide brought the deaths of around 800,000 women and children and the Bosnia Massacre where about 8,000 Muslim boys and men were slaughtered. This shaped a later action plan that was presented in 2004 by Kofi Annan to find better ways of preventing dreaded events of genocide and massacres (Agha Shashi).\n\nCrisis in Africa\n\nBy 1997 Kofi Annan officially became the 7th Secretary General of the United Nations. He placed at the foremost front on the importance of “human rights, the rule of law, the Millennium Development Goals and Africa, sought to bring the organization closer to the global public by forging ties with civil society, the private sector and other partners” (Kofi Annan Foundation). Some of his most notable work took place during the Aids and HIV crises in Africa. From that he established the global aids crisis and health fund. Through this he changed the US’s mere 1 Billion dollars in pledges and contributions to the AIDS/HIV crisis to a massive 7-10 Billion dollars. This was crucial to the 23.3 million people who had contracted HIV and at the time he stepped in around 3.2 million more Africans had been infected. As of now there are close to 21 million people on HIV treatment plans. The amount of lives he saved is incredible and through his persistence the Global Fund to Fight Aids was born and being funded.\n\nA Well Deserving Prize\n\nI could continue to list the many great solutions to crises that Kofi Annan has helped solve. However, rather than my word, Kofi being awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize says it all. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his peacekeeping work across the world. More specifically though his firm stance against international terrorism and the containment of the HIV epidemic. Although some could say this is the point where you retire, Kofi Annan’s work still wasn’t over (NPR). In 2007 he became a chairman of the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa. With a 150 million dollar grant from the US, Kofi Annan set off to help small scale farmers in Africa. This would help to make the sector more secure and address the issue of rural farmers struggling to feed their families (ZeeNews).\n\nA Legacy to Remember\n\nThe icing on the cake of his entire life has to be the Kofi Annan Foundation. Although he stepped down in 2007 from his position of UN Secretary General, he needed to do more. He always felt as if not only himself but as people we could do more. This is important in the foundation behind him starting his own foundation. When traversing their website on their homepage. Located at the bottom of the page is a section of all the partner organizations.

There are 20 organizations listed which ranges from Mexico across Africa to as far as Malaysia. Sadly, Kofi Annan passed away on August 18, 2018 in Bern, Switzerland. However even before he died when he got out of the hospital he went right back to working with his foundation. Kofi Annan truly was a man dedicated to the progress of humanity (Biography.com).\n\nFeatured Photo Courtesy of DNA\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLessons of the Rwanda and Bosnia genocides – jstor.org. (n.d.).
