The ongoing conflict has resulted in extensive damage to local agrifood systems, leaving the population grappling with critical to catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. This has exacerbated the violation of the right to food, essential for human dignity and the realization of other human rights. The new publication, titled \"Protecting the right to adequate food and saving lives in the Gaza Strip,\" provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation. It underscores the fundamental principle of food as a human right and outlines the obligations of states to safeguard this basic human right. The publication also explores the application of the right to food in contexts of armed conflict and occupation, evaluating the current conditions in Gaza against binding legal obligations and international precedents. A technical briefing, themed \"Protecting the right to adequate food in the Gaza Strip,\" will be held to present the findings of this publication. Scheduled for Thursday, July 18, 2024, from 16:00 to 17:30, the hybrid event will take place at FAO Headquarters and via Zoom. This technical meeting will provide a platform for in-depth discussion and reflection on the realization of the Right to Food in Gaza, following nine months of intense conflict. It will feature insights from June’s 2024 IPC report and offer policy recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of interventions. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the population and the necessary steps to address this critical issue. Event details: Date: Thursday, 18 July 2024 Time: 16:00-17:30 CEST\n\nOn Day three at the National Cassava Conference Expo 2023, we concluded by agreeing on Cassava as the WHITE GOLD IN KENYA. Our discussion focused on ways to maximize te production and consumption of cassava. Ways to incorporate the public to embrace intake of cassava, particularly blending an inititive called FBI( Flour Blending Initiative) is yet to see the light of the day. Communication strategies and development to senstitize the public on the nutritional value of cassava as a better food crop to improve food security in Kenya. We strive to address te Big 4 Agenda, on Food Security and Nutrition Security. There is a need to sensitize, educate and create awareness to the public on cassava production. It can not be achieved overnight, but gradually and with the support of the government, private sectors, investors, stakeholders and consumers. The journey begins now!"
