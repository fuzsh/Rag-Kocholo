        "text": "MIPAD is profoundly saddened and deeply affected by the news of the passing of Secretary-General Kofi Atta Annan.\n\nMr. Annan has been a wonderful example to all of us at MIPAD. He was a champion of internationalism and human rights for his entire adult life, from his university years at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota USA to his work at the United Nations and beyond. Secretary-General Annan was a global leader that many of us looked upon as an honorable man of integrity, gentleness, and grace.\n\nHe did so as a proudly Ghanaian man and kept the African continent at the heart of his humanitarian work.\n\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has been an inspiration and an example for a generation of Africans and People of African descent. His work and dedication to making the world a peaceful place will live forever says Kamil Olufowobi, CEO, MIPAD\n\nWe extend our most heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Nane Maria Annan and the rest of the family, including 2018 MIPAD Honoree Mrs. Shanthi Annan."
