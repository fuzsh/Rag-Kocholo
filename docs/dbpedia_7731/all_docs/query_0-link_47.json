        "text": "More Stories\n\nMy first trip to Macalester was in the middle of an April blizzard. Coming from South Florida, I had barely seen snow, let alone been walking around in a snowstorm, but the snow was exciting and fun! During breaks between events, I went around campus making tiny snowmen on benches and curbs, and people seemed to get a kick out of my obvious bewilderment. It was the coldest weather I had ever been in, but the free hot chocolate helped keep me warm.\n\nWhen I told my friends and professors that I was looking at Macalester college in Minnesota, they all asked me the same question: “Why would you ever want to go live in the snow?”, but it wasn’t only the seasons that I was looking for in my school. I was coming from a pretty small area, so I was focused on schools near or in cities. I also wanted a school with a good music program and plenty of things to do on the weekends.\n\nMost importantly, I wanted a college that could accommodate all of the different things I wanted to do. During college applications, I had an intricate plan with a major, minor, concentration, and pre-med track, and I needed a school where I could do all of it without being completely drained.\n\nAs my day of meeting people and learning about Macalester was coming to a close, I had one more stop to talk to an admissions counselor. I explained every detail of my very complicated college plan (I nicknamed it “The Plan”) and practically grilled him for information on how I could make it work at Mac. He sat with me for close to an hour answering all of my questions and giving me department contact information and listing professors I could talk to. At the end of the meeting, when I was finally satisfied that “The Plan” was all possible, he handed me a sticker. It said: “I chose Macalester” over a drawing of the school, and he said, “I think you’ll need this”.\n\nAs many people can tell you, things change when you get into college. I have already made many changes to “The Plan”, but I feel confident knowing Macalester can accommodate whatever it is I want to do.\n\nAnd I was right, I do love the winter.\n\nOpen Modal Close Video\n\nFinding your home away from home\n\nMeet Lily, a junior at Macalester.

She found support from professors and countless ways to meet people. Plus, everyone is on the same adventure!\n\nAfter matching with Macalester as a QuestBridge Scholar, I was finally scheduled to visit. I was going to get a feel for the college, get to know some of the people, actually be able to set foot on campus, and not just stare at its pictures through my computer. Then COVID hit. I felt alone.\n\nWhen the Spring Sampler was cancelled, I started worrying whether Macalester was actually a good fit for me. I spent weeks looking through its website over and over, and on paper it looked like a good choice. The glowing pictures of Mairs Concert Hall where I someday envisioned myself playing, and the limitless opportunities to do research with faculty on campus or in the Twin Cities kept me somewhat at ease. I just did not know if I would have a connection to the place or the people. Then came the Instagram follow requests from people that I did not know, but had “Macalester 2024” on their bio.\n\nI started messaging some of these people, asking random questions or sending memes to get to know them. Some ended up being one-line conversations, but others turned deeper. Originally, I thought the conversations about our ideologies and life hardships would be forgotten and that our conversations would end after that. But now every time I find a funny math meme they are some of the first people I send it to. Even though I had never met them in person, I started seeing these people as friends.\n\nWhen I arrived to Doty Hall, I was not nervous like I thought I was going to be. I knew I had friends I could soon meet. I knew I was not going to be alone.\n\nWhen I was looking at schools I looked at the East Coast, Midwest…schools that were pretty spread out. I didn’t have a specific school that I wanted to go to, but I wanted to go somewhere that was going to challenge me, but also not stifle my creativity. And I knew I wanted biology or psychology, and I’m now a neurosciences major here.\n\nIt’s a funny thing, but I think one of the things that drew me to Macalester was a logo that was an orange peel and it had a little globe inside. It just felt interesting and still quirky. And on that piece of mail, I got a quote by Kofi Annan, which was actually a good friend of my grandfather, who is from Ghana.\n\nSo I called my grandpa and he told me a little bit about Kofi Annan, about his schooling here. And my grandpa is a very quiet guy, doesn’t say a lot of words or give a lot of direct orders like do this, do that. But this was the first time he said, if you’re going to pick a school, pick a school like Macalester. And if out of all of them, my grandfather in Ghana is saying to pick a school in Minnesota, well, I chose Macalester. And it’s been amazing.\n\nWhen I came here my host was a sophomore. She told me all the best spots on campus and eased me into the transition. I am part of QuestBridge and I am a first generation student, so a lot of things were very new to me and kind of stressful at times. She was also first generation and she shared her network with me, which I think was great for getting different perspectives and feeling connected."
