Locating this building is sort of the gate weight off campus. It's where our center for study away is located, as well as our Civic Engagement Center, which helps students volunteer off campus. It also hosts the international round table that happens in the fall every year. This year it was just about mass incarceration, so that was very interesting. Oh, and right next to me is a bust of Kofi on on, um, the building's namesake right here."
