        "text": "Global Citizenship Student Award\n\nThe Global Citizenship Student Award (GCSA) is presented every April by Macalester College and the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship to the graduating seniors who best demonstrate a commitment to the ideals and practice of high academic performance, internationalism, multiculturalism, and civic engagement.\n\nDavis Projects for Peace\n\nDavis Projects for Peace is an initiative for all students at the Davis United World College Scholars Program partner schools to design their own grassroots projects for peace that they themselves will implement anywhere in the world. Through a nationwide competition, projects are selected for funding at $10,000 each and completed during the summer.\n\nAction Fund\n\nThe Action Fund supports civic engagement projects proposed and led by students in direct collaboration with local community-based organizations. The projects all have action components, fulfilling unmet needs of Twin Citiesâ€™ communities, as well as an education component that promotes reflection and sharing of lessons learned. Students may apply for up to $1,000 for their project."
