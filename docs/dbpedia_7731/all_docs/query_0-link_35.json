        "text": "Field Changers Fellows Program\n\nThe Field Changers Fellows Program is a new Macalester initiative intended to provide a community and support for students in the humanities whom faculty have noted as having particular potential to transform their disciplinary field. Each year, Macalester selects up to four talented sophomores to participate in the program.\n\nDuring fall and spring semesters, Fellows will convene regularly to discuss issues of diversity and equity in the humanities; attend fall and spring colloquia featuring faculty, alumni and outside speakers offering advice about how to challenge disciplinary norms; and receive guidance about applying to graduate school, including funding for a GRE preparatory course and the GRE exam."
