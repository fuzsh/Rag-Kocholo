        "text": "​\n\nKofi Atta Annan (born 8 April 1938) is a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize . He is the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders , an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela.\n\nBorn in Kumasi, Annan went on to study economics at Macalester College, international relations from the Graduate Institute Geneva and management at MIT . Annan joined the UN in 1962, working for the World Health Organization’s Geneva office.\n\nHe went on to work in several capacities at the UN Headquarters including serving as the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping between March 1992 and December 1996.\n\nHe was appointed as the Secretary-General on 13 December 1996 by the Security Council , and later confirmed by the General Assembly , making him the first office holder to be elected from the UN staff itself.\n\nHe was re-elected for a second term in 2001, and was succeeded as Secretary-General by Ban Ki-moon on 1 January 2007.\n\nAs the Secretary-General, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy; worked to combat HIV , especially in Africa ; and launched the UN Global Compact\n\nEarly years and education\n\nKofi Annan was born in the Kofandros section of Kumasi in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) on 8 April 1938. His twin sister Efua Atta, who died in 1991, shared the middle name Atta , which in the Akan means ‘twin’. Annan and his sister were born into one of the country’s Ashanti and Fante aristocratic families; both of their grandfathers and their uncle were tribal chiefs .\n\nFrom 1954 to 1957, Annan attended the elite Mfantsipim school, a Methodist boarding school in Cape Coast founded in the 1870s. Annan has said that the school taught him “that suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere”. In 1957, the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim, the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain and began using the name “Ghana”.\n\nIn 1958, Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology, now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana .\n\nHe received a Ford Foundation grant, enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies in economics at Macalester College in St. Paul , Minnesota , United States, in 1961, Annan is fluent in English, French, Akan, some Kru languages and other African languages.\n\nAppointment\n\nOn 13 December 1996, the UN Security Council recommended Annan to replace the previous Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt , whose second term faced the veto of the United States. Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly, he started his first term as Secretary-General on 1 January 1997.\n\nHe was reelected for a second term in 2001, which was unusual since this meant a third term for Africa. The Asian states did not protest, although it should have been their turn, because Annan was so popular among the UN member states and UN staff.\n\nOn 31 January 2006, Kofi Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK . The speech, delivered at Central Hall , Westminster , also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the General Assembly and Security Council.\n\n7 March 2006, he presented to the General Assembly his proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat. The reform report is entitled Investing in the United Nations, For a Stronger Organization Worldwide .\n\nIn March 2000, Annan appointed the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to assess the shortcomings of the then existing system and to make specific and realistic recommendations for change. The panel was composed of individuals experienced in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The report it produced, which became known as the Brahimi Report, after Chair of the Panel Lakhdar Brahimi, called for:\n\n1. renewed political commitment on the part of Member States;\n\n2. significant institutional change;\n\n3. increased financial support.\n\nEstablishment of The Global Fund\n\nTowards the end of the 1990s, increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda. In April 2001, Annan issued a five-point “Call to Action” to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Stating it was a “personal priority”, Annan proposed the establishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund , “dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases” [36] to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis. In June of that year, the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to the creation of such a fund during a special session on AIDS, and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in June 2002.\n\nFarewell addresses\n\nOn 19 September 2006, Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York, in anticipation of his retirement on 31 December. In the speech he outlined three major problems of “an unjust world economy, world disorder, and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law”, which he believes “have not resolved, but sharpened” during his time as Secretary-General. He also pointed to violence in Africa, and the Arab-Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention.\n\nKofi Annan Foundation\n\nIn 2007, Kofi Annan established the Kofi Annan Foundation, an independent, not-for profit organization which works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer, more peaceful world.\n\nThe story still continues\n\n#GLteaM\n\n# Agbasah E.Elizabeth.\n\n#Robert Nana Obiri Okyere\n\n#Bernard Aboagye\n\n#Esther Nkansah\n\n#NAna Yaa"
