        "text": "We are delighted to present the 2023-2024 cohort of Kofi Annan scholars of the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann graduate programme at Mansfield College, Oxford.\n\nThese fully-funded scholarships have been named in honour of Kofi Annan, a figure whose name provides inspiration and honour to those in receipt of it, and which reflects the intended purpose of the scholarships – educating people to make the world a better place. Through these scholarships, Mansfield College aims to inspire and transform the worldview of the recipients in a similar way to Kofi Annan’s recounting of his experience as a student at Macalester College.\n\n“With Kofi Annan’s deep commitment to education for the benefit of international peace, collaboration and development, and our proud link with him, we could think of no better name to achieve that intention.”\n\n– Helen Mountfield QC, Principal, Mansfield College.\n\nThe Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholarships and Leadership Programme aims to provide outstanding university graduates and professionals from developing and emerging economies with the opportunity to pursue studies at the University of Oxford. In addition to their studies, the graduates participate in a tailor-made leadership programme that gives them practical skills and opportunities.\n\nCorinne Momal-Vanian, Executive Director of the Kofi Annan Foundation, shared, “I was so moved by my discussion with this year’s cohort of Kofi Annan scholars. Each of them has a powerful story, unique skills and an inspiring determination to make a change. They truly honour Kofi Annan’s legacy.”\n\nThe 2023 – 2024 Kofi Annan Scholars\n\nThe first cohort of Kofi Annan scholars was announced in 2020. Learn more about the recipients of the Kofi Annan scholarship.\n\nThe Kofi Annan Scholarships of the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Programme have been made possible thanks to the generosity of Mansfield alumnus Mr Jan Fischer of Germany."
