He graduated in 1961.\n\nHe served as secretary-general of the U.N. from 1997-2006 and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001. In 2007, he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting better global governance and strengthening the capacities of people and countries.\n\n“He’s remained very involved in important world affairs,” Rosenberg said. “At Macalester, we have a mission that speaks to internationalism and multiculturalism and service to society, and we think that the career of Kofi Annan embodies that, and it’s important for us to honor that career.”\n\nThe school honored Annan in 2006, when he was an inaugural speaker at the school’s newly created Institute for Global Citizenship, and in 2009 when a life-sized bronze bust of him was unveiled.\n\nThe institute “fosters global citizenship by advancing scholarship, reflection, and ethical action in our local, national, and international communities,” according to Macalester’s website.\n\nAnnan and former Vice President Walter Mondale co-chair the Jack Mason Law and Democracy Initiative of Books for Africa, the world’s largest shipper of books to Africa.\n\nAnnan will speak to invited attendees about about law, democracy, the initiative, and the program as a whole.\n\n“He’s been a great champion over the years of the rule of law and is well-known for advancing democracy and governance in Africa. In addition to the initiative, he’s also very supportive of our overall mission,” Director of Books for Africa Patrick Plonski said.\n\nTO ATTEND\n\nAt 11:15 a.m. Monday at Macalester College’s Institute for Global Citizenship at Markim Hall, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Macalester President Brian Rosenberg will speak at the dedication of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship.\n\nOriginally Published: May 4, 2018 at 11:02 a.m."
