        "text": "Peter Higgs is best known as the theoretical physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson.\n\nThe boson explains why other elementary particles - the basic building blocks of the Universe - have mass.\n\nHiggs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1929, the son of a BBC sound engineer.\n\nHis family later moved to Bristol, and the young Peter Higgs proved a brilliant student, winning many prizes at Cotham Grammar School - though not any in physics.\n\nBut it was here that he was first inspired by the work of Paul Dirac, one of the physicists who helped lay the foundations for quantum mechanics.\n\nThis led him to study for his PhD at King's College London. After finishing, he applied for a lectureship at the London university, but lost out to a friend. He headed for Scotland instead.\n\nIt was here that Higgs proposed his famous mechanism.\n\nOther researchers were working independently on the same idea, publishing papers at the same time as Peter Higgs.\n\nThese other theorists included the Belgians Francois Englert, who shared the 2013 physics Nobel with Higgs, and Robert Brout (now deceased); and later the Americans Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and Briton Tom Kibble.\n\nYet by the early 1970s, it was Higgs who was being associated most in academic papers and conferences with the theory. This led to the particle acquiring his name - informally at first, but it soon stuck.\n\nHowever, whilst well known in academic circles, Higgs was not yet a household name. He continued to write and teach; he married, but split from his wife a few years after his two children were born.\n\nFriends feel he did not have the impact in his career expected of a scientist of his calibre.\n\n\"I wouldn't say he was shy. I might say that he was a little too retiring perhaps for the good of his own career,\" said Prof Michael Fisher, now at the University of Maryland, US.\n\nAttention on the Higgs boson increased in recent decades, especially after scientists behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern in Geneva made discovering the particle a key priority.\n\nFailure to detect the Higgs at the LHC's predecessor - the LEP - had elevated it to one of the most sought-after prizes in science.\n\nHiggs had never been completely comfortable with the attention it brought - or the association of his name with it. But he came to be more accepting as the years rolled on.\n\nIn July 2012, physicists at Cern announced the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. He was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as scientists made their announcement.\n\nThe news immediately led to calls for Prof Higgs to be knighted and for him to be awarded a Nobel Prize - perhaps along with others who had come up with the theory in the early 60s.\n\nReacting to the discovery, Peter Higgs told reporters: \"It's very nice to be right sometimes.\""
