        "text": "Works\n\nHe was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for predicting the existence of the Higgs boson, the \"most sought-after particle in modern physics\".[2][3] Higgs shared the prize with FranÃ§ois Englert.[4] Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2013.[5][6]\n\nIn the 1960s, he proposed broken symmetry in electroweak theory. This explains the origin of mass of elementary particles in general. It also shows the origin of the W and Z bosons. The theory known as Higgs mechanism was proposed by several physicists at the same time. It proposes the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson. On 4 July 2012, CERN announced they had found a new particle much like the Higgs boson in experiments,[7] but that more work was necessary to analyse its properties and see if it had the properties expected from the Standard Model Higgs boson.[8]\n\nThe Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics, without which particles would have no mass.[9]"
