        "text": "I rarely do reposts but think that this is relevant. Peter Higgs, who won a Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, passed away recently at age 94. He mentioned to The Guardian below that he wouldn't have gotten an academic job in the academic climate in the 2010's since he wasn't seen as \"productive\" enough. In fact, he recalled being seen as an embarrassment at work when he had no publications to report during research assessment exercises. More importantly, he also felt that he wouldn't have enough peace and quiet to have discovered in the Higgs Boson particle in the academic climate in the early 2010's Unfortunately, if things were bad in 2013, it ain't any better in 2024. I think more places in the West, especially, are trying to recognize research with impact, and not just reward people with massive numbers of publications. Don't get me wrong, journal publications have a major place in academia. But I wonder what am I doing wrong when I manage to only publish 2 or 3 papers in a year, while others publish 40, 50 or even more than a 100 papers per annum! ü§Ø More importantly, can you adequately contribute to each and every paper to warrant authorship on the journal article? ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't know. ü§î You be the judge. #academia #publication #higgs #integrity\n\nüéá I'm getting academically \"attacked\"? How exciting! In a recent Discussion Article, Steinkrauss & Slotnick (https://lnkd.in/eQ6z2mbG) argue that existing studies on hippocampal involvement in implicit memory are all biased and not convincing. One of those studies was my dissertation project (https://lnkd.in/egyrSihB) I was invited to comment, which I did: https://lnkd.in/ee98M2Cx I believe their critique falls into special pleading, but this is what the scientific process is all about: claim, challenge, and defend. Dive into both sides and see what you think!"
