Higgs was born in Elswick, Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1929. I1 was born nearby in Jesmond, near Newcastle University, a few years later.\n\nFor schooling, Higgs with his parents, was moved to Bristol. His father was employed as a BBC engineer1,2. At Bristol, Higgs’s left arm was broken by a fall into a crater left by a German bomb1,2. Higgs read Physics at Imperial College, London, where he progressed to a Ph.D. in Physics with Distinction. This led to Higgs’s appointment at Edinburgh University in the Physics Faculty1,2. From its Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics, in October 1964, Higgs published a brief communication, “Broken Symmetries and the Masses of Gauge Bosons”3.\n\nIn 1965-1966 Higgs spent a sabbatical year at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill1,2,4. Higgs expanded upon his1964 publication3, and in November 1965 from Chapel Hill submitted his paper, “Spontaneous Symmetry Breakdown without Massless Bosons” to Physical Review5. Higgs sent simultaneous copies to colleagues he thought would be interested in a pre-publication reading1,4.\n\nCERN: HIGGS FIELD AND THE HIGGS BOSON:\n\nThe Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, was established with an initial Resolution at a December 1951 meeting of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris. In June 1953 the CERN Convention was signed by twelve Member States, and in 1955 construction of CERN’s Geneva Research Facility began6. At present membership has grown to twenty-three Member States along with Associate Members and Observers7.\n\nThe Higgs field causes elementary particles to attain mass8. CERN originally defined the Higgs boson as “a particle predicted by theory. It is linked with the mechanism by which physicists think particles acquire mass9”. Proof of the predicted particle, it was thought, would complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics developed during the second half of the last century8,9,10,11,12. Higgs’ 1966 paper5 and what followed was a crucial turning point in understanding this model for all matter1,4, 8,10,11,12.\n\nForty-seven years after publication of his 1966 paper, submitted from Chapel Hill, Peter Higgs ( ) was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Professor François Englert of the Free University of Brussels. The Nobel Citation states: “For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS [A Toroidal LHC Apparatus] and CMS [Compact Muon Solenoid] experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider”13,14,15.\n\nGEORDIES VISIT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, CHAPEL HILL\n\nIn March 1966, while a Clinical Associate in Anaesthesia at Harvard University, I was invited to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to advise changes needed in the leadership of Surgical Departments. Welcomed with Southern hospitality, I was introduced to my “fellow Geordie”, Peter Higgs. Our dinner host told me that ‘Wykehamist’ Professor Freeman J. Dyson16,17,18 at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey had insisted that the following week, on March 15, 19661,4,there should be a Higgs lecture at IAS on the acquisition of mass by subatomic particles.\n\nFREEMAN J. DYSON: IAS, PRINCETON\n\nFreeman J. Dyson was born at Crowthorne, Berkshire, in 1923, the son of Sir George Dyson, Composer, and Director of Music at Winchester College from 1924, and his lawyer wife, the former Mildred Atkey16,17,18,19,20. He was elected a “Scholar” at Winchester College. These select seventy boys lived within the College18. Freeman Dyson was awarded prizes in Mathematics and Science. He also distinguished himself in Athletics and became a Shakespearean Scholar18.\n\nIn 1941, Dyson proceeded as Scholar to Trinity, Cambridge16,18,19,20. Paul Dirac was Dyson’s Physics Professor21, as was Arthur Eddington22. Dirac was a Fellow of St. John’s College and winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics for “the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory”21. He was also Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (1932-1967), the chair held by Newton (16631696), and Stephen Hawking (1979-2009)23. Dyson studied Mathematics with the legendary G.H. Hardy24. World War II interrupted Dyson’s Cambridge education and from 1943-45 he was Civilian Scientist for the R.A.F.17,19,20,25. He later elucidated his rationale for civilian scientific work in critiques of nuclear and other warfare26. He returned to Cambridge to complete his B.A. in the Mathematics Tripos in 1945. Dyson entered Cornell University’s Physics Department under future 1967 Physics Nobelist Hans Bethe in 194627. At Cornell Dyson developed a collegial friendship with Richard P. Feynman, Professor of Theoretical Physics, and 1965 Winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics1,19,28,29. While Dyson contributed to the mathematics of theories of quantum electrodynamics, he did not share Feynman’s Nobel Prize17,19.\n\nWhile Dyson never received his Doctorate, he taught at Cornell from 1949-195217. Professor Dyson accepted a Permanent Position offered by Director J. Robert Oppenheimer30( ), at the (IAS), Princeton, New Jersey, as a colleague of Einstein19 ( ). Dyson was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 195220. Dyson held his Professorship at IAS for the remainder of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s directorship (1947-1966) and throughout Dyson’s career17,19,25 ( ). Dyson’s original contributions to mathematics, physics and cosmology led to a long list of publications19,31,32,33. While he was never awarded the Nobel Prize, he received many honours including the Max Planck Medal (1969), the Harvey Prize34(1977), the Wolf Prize in Physics (1981), and twenty-one honorary doctorates20.\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nDirectorIn OfficeAbraham Flexner1930-1939Frank Aydelotte1939-1947J.

Griffiths1991-2003Peter Goddard2004-2012Robbert Dijkgraaf2012-2022David Nirenberg2022-\n\nFOUNDING AND DIRECTORSHIP OF IAS IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY\n\nThe IAS was founded in 1930 with an initial endowment of five million dollars (just over one million pounds, or 62.5 million pounds in 201935), the gift of renowned Newark, New Jersey Department Store innovator and philanthropist, Baltimore-born Louis Bamberger and his sister, Mrs. Felix (“Carrie”) Fuld36. Bamberger was acquainted with Harry Gordon Selfridge from Selfridge’s early career at Chicago’s Marshall Field’s. They corresponded for many years37. After selling his sixteen-story department store to the owners of Macy’s at peak before the October 1929 Stock Market Crash, Bamberger and his sister considered endowment of a medical school in Newark. They consulted their legal and financial advisors, Herbert Maass and Samuel Leidesdorf, to select the individual they considered most astute and knowledgeable: Dr. Abraham Flexner, author of the eponymous 1910 Report on Medical Education36,37,38. Dr. Abraham Flexner was a brother of Dr. Simon Flexner who served as the first Director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, later renamed Rockefeller University, from 1911-193539. The Flexners were acquainted with and assisted by President Theodore Roosevelt37,39. Louis Bamberger and Carrie Fuld met with Dr. Abraham Flexner in New York City37.\n\nAbraham Flexner advised against establishing a medical school in Newark, New Jersey. Abraham Flexner advocated instead for the foundation of an independent educational institution to support and encourage creative scholarship in multiple disciplines. The Bamberger siblings were inspired by the potential of Abraham Flexner’s proposal and agreed, with the stipulation that Flexner serve as the new Institute’s first Director30,37 Dr. Flexner served from 1930-1939 ( ). Bamberger and Flexner’s appointees to the initial 1930 Board of Trustees included 1912 Nobel Prize Winner in Physiology and Medicine Alexis Carrel40, Johns Hopkins Professor of Pathology and Bamberger cousin Florence R. Sabin, and former Johns Hopkins Medical School Dean Lewis Weed37. A suitable site was acquired in Princeton, New Jersey, and Fuld Hall, named for Bamberger’s late business partner and brother-in-law Felix Fuld, was built36,37,41 ( ). Louis Bamberger supported the lease of Princeton University space for the new Institute until separate facilities were available37. Abraham Flexner developed a close and collegial friendship with Louis Bamberger, who maintained an active role in the academic and administrative affairs of the (IAS), and continued his financial support. Upon Bamberger’s death in 1944, IAS was the beneficiary of the greater part of his estate37.\n\nIn October 1932 the Institute announced the appointment of its first two Professors of Mathematics, Oswald Veblen and Albert Einstein36 ( ). In 1933, Einstein surrendered his German passport at the German Consulate in Antwerp. He proceeded to England where he considered other offers of academic positions. In October 1933, while still a “Research Student” at Oxford41 Einstein arrived in Princeton, New Jersey to begin what would become a lifetime tenure36,42.\n\nIn February 1966, shortly before Peter Higgs’ March 15, 1966 guest lecture at Professor Dyson’s invitation, the IAS publicly announced the upcoming retirement of its director, J. Robert Oppenheimer who would be succeeded by Harvard’s Littauer Professor of Economics, Carl Kaysen43,44,45 ( ).\n\nProfessor Kaysen had been President J.F. Kennedy’s Deputy Special Assistant for National Security Affairs from 1961-1963, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, before his appointment to the Economics Faculty at Harvard. During World War II, Kaysen had served the U.S. Air Force as an Intelligence Officer at High Wycombe, where officers were quartered in Wycombe Abbey, a school for young ladies. At IAS, Kaysen and Dyson became close colleagues and friends who shared reminiscences of their wartime experiences17,45,46. J. Robert Oppenheimer died of throat cancer on February 18, 196719,43. Kaysen continued as Director of IAS until 1976, when he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts to accept a Professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here he served as David F. Skinner Professor of Political Economy46.\n\nPETER HIGGS AT HARVARD\n\nEarly in the morning after being dined with Peter Higgs at Chapel Hill, I phoned Prof. Fred Mosteller47,48,49,50,51,52 with whom my Harvard boss Henry K. Beecher53,54 ( ) had me working on non-parametric statistical problems47,51. I recounted my meeting with Peter Higgs. I learned that Fred Mosteller, who had received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1946 and maintained strong academic ties throughout his career, was acquainted with Professor Dyson, as well as with Harvard’s Professor Kaysen ( ). After my telephone call to Professor Mosteller, Peter Higgs was invited to speak at Harvard on March 16, 1966, the day after his visit to the IAS1,2,4. Peter Higgs gave his lecture and then by request was asked to continue in symposium mode. The reported attendees included future 1979 Nobel Prize Winner Sheldon Glashow of Harvard and later University Professor at Boston University55, long-time distinguished Harvard Professor of Physics Sidney Coleman56, Harvard Associate Professor of Biophysics Walter Gilbert, later Winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry57, and Professor Fred Mosteller of Harvard, best known at that time for establishing the authorship of the Federalist Papers58. In his 2013 Nobel Prize Acceptance Lecture, Higgs credited his 1966 Harvard invitation to Stanley Deser of nearby Brandeis University, who became Ancell Professor of Physics and later Visiting Professor at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena59,60.\n\nCERN\n\nThe proofs for validation of Higgs’ work came from two parallel experiments of CMS and ATLAS at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) beneath Geneva, Switzerland2,10,12,61,62,63. Geordie Peter Higgs’ 2013 Nobel Prize was shared with Professor François Englert of the Free University of Brussels13,64. Higgs’ brief communication to Physical Review Letters, received on 31 August 1964 and published on 19 October 19643 had, at the request of the Editor4,59 referenced Englert and Brout’s similar communication to the same journal published on 31 August 196464. Englert’s colleague, Robert Brout, had predeceased65.\n\nAt the July 4, 2012 CERN press conference honouring Peter Higgs, Queen’s University Belfast-educated Director of Accelerators and Technology, Stephen Myers was among the CERN leadership62. Also present were Professors Gerald Guralnik of Brown University, Providence, RI66,67, and Carl R. Hagen66,67of the University of Rochester, New York State, whose parallel efforts4, along with those of Thomas Kibble, FRS 1980, Knighted 201468,69, had contributed to understanding of the Higgs mechanism and boson characteristics. After the CERN Press conference, Peter Higgs took the next flight back to Edinburgh with colleague Alan Walker2.\n\nSTEPHEN MYERS: BELFAST AND GENEVA\n\nPhysics Review published Peter Higgs’ landmark paper submitted from Chapel Hill on May 27,19665. Higgs returned from Chapel Hill to Edinburgh in the autumn of 19661,2,4. Belfast-born Stephen Myers was then a student at QUB. He received his BSc Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with First Class Honours in 1968 and his PhD in 197270. Late in 1972, he began his career at CERN as Engineer-in-Charge for the operation of the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR)70. In 1983 he coauthored preliminary performance predictions for a Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP)70. Myers was given responsibility for commissioning the LEP, and oversaw its preparation. During the 1990s Myers was appointed Project Leader of the LEP upgrade. QUB awarded Myers an Honourary DSc (Eng) in 200370,71.\n\nCERN released the details of the September 19, 2008incident which disabled the LHC. Reports state that “…a fault occurred in the electrical bus connection in the region between a dipole and a quadrupole, resulting in mechanical damage and release of helium from the magnet and cold mass into the tunnel. Proper safety measures were in force, the safety systems performed as expected and no-one was put at risk”72,73.\n\nIn October 2008, Myers was nominated CERN’s Director of Accelerators and Technology. In the aftermath of the September 19, 2008 incident, Myers organized the repair of the LHC and directed its continued operation from 2010 through 2012. Under his direction, in 2012, the LHC received approval for two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS, to confirm the Higgs boson74,75. Myers was named Head of CERN’s Office of Medical Applications from January 1, 201474,76.\n\nOn April 2, 2014, Myers returned to QUB to lecture on “The Large Hadron Collider and the Discovery of the Higgs Boson”77,78.\n\nWork continues at QUB with the development of new particle accelerators. Dr. Gianlucca Sarri, who received his Ph.D. from QUB in 2010, has reported on proposals to build a powerful yet compact particle accelerator at QUB as part of ongoing work by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures79,80. Plasma, ionised gas broken down to its basic components, can provide much higher accelerating power than a solid-state accelerator. The proposed accelerator is designed to use lasers to move the plasma particles in waves. Dr. Sarri reports that the space required for a plasma-based particle accelerator will be reduced ten-fold from 400 by 400 meters to 40 by 40 meters. Potential medical applications include enhanced images of biological samples and early detection of tiny cracks or defects in medical instrumentation79.\n\nThe proposed accelerator at QUB would be used to produce accelerated particles used for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures is expected to shortly reach their decision on the report79,80,81.\n\nCERN AND MEDICAL PROGRESS\n\nThe history of subatomic particle therapy goes back at least a century82,83,84,85. In recent years, investigators at CERN and with affiliations to many universities and hospitals worldwide have investigated a broad array of technologies and applications. CERN’s medical endeavors continue76,86,87.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nShortly after my return from Chapel Hill to Harvard, on March 17, 1966, Fred Mosteller told me that, “Peter Higgs’ lecture-cum-symposium was convincing and well-received. A Nobel Prize will follow.” That award, and others, did follow. On November 15, 2013, the City of Edinburgh, granted its Freedom of the City to Professor Peter Higgs88. Geordie Higgs’ birthplace, as well as mine, granted Freedom of Newcastle-upon-Tyne on April 2, 201489.\n\nOn April 17, 2014, Higgs’ Nobel Prize co-winner, Professor François Englert, delivered the David M. Lee Historical Lecture in Physics at Harvard. He recounted the formulation of the theory known as the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism3,64. Professor Englert discussed the role of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at CERN, and “the implications for unknown universal structures that might be revealed at even higher energies”90.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors thank Laura Earley, Records Management Officer of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, for their permission to reproduce the portrait of Sir Peter Higgs.
