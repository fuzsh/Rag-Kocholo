        "text": "He’s had a scientific tiff with Stephen Hawking, dislikes the ‘God particle’ nickname for his Nobel prize winning theory and thinks fame is a bit of a nuisance.\n\nSo who is Peter Higgs?\n\nIs Peter Higgs a Geordie?\n\nTechnically, yes, by birth any way. He was born in Elswick, Newcastle in May 1929, the son of a BBC sound engineer.\n\nAny chance that people might have rubbed shoulders with him at the Gallowgate end?\n\nSadly not. His family soon moved down south and he was brought up in Bristol.\n\nPresumably he did well at school?\n\nFunnily enough because of asthma for a period he was home taught. However, he made it to university and graduated with First Class Honours in Physics from King’s College, University of London, in 1950.\n\nAnd his big idea was..?\n\nThe Higgs boson, the so-called God particle (cue cries of anguish at the name, including Prof Higgs, more of which later), which provides mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. Without it, the Standard Model theory that combines all the fundamental forces and particles of the universe would have fallen down. Higgs predicted the existence of the particle while working at Edinburgh University in 1964.\n\nAnd how did the scientific fraternity react back then?\n\nThe idea was initially met with suspicion and even ridicule in certain circles. His first paper was rejected by a journal, and some peers accused him and some colleagues of failing to grasp the basic principles of physics.\n\nDidn’t he have a bit of a to-do with Prof Stephen Hawking about it?\n\nHe did indeed. Back in 2002, before his theory had been proved, Prof Higgs launched what appeared to be a deeply personal attack on Professor Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair and speaks through a voice synthesiser. Hawking had said the Higgs boson particle would never be found and put a bet, believed to be $100, on it. Higgs was quoted as saying: “It is very difficult to engage him (Hawking) in discussion, and so he has got away with pronouncements in a way that other people would not.”\n\nHe also reportedly said: “His celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have.”\n\nAnd when was his theory proved?\n\nIt was in 2012 after two years of smashing protons together, CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.\n\nHow did Prof Hawking react to the news?\n\nHe was effusive in his praise of Prof Higgs though lamented the loss of his $100.\n\nWhen did Prof Higgs get the Novel prize?\n\nIt was in 2013 he got the Nobel prize for physics which he shared with François Englert of the Free University of Brussels who had independently come up with a model explaining why particles are not massless and this model requires the existence of the Higgs boson.\n\nSo why is it called the God particle?\n\nThe name was the invention of Leon Lederman, himself a great physicist, who used it as the title of a popular book in 1993. It was said he actually called it the ‘Goddam particle’ because it was so difficult to find. The ‘God particle’ tag has stuck because the Higgs boson isn’t so catchy.\n\nWhat did Prof Higgs made of the nickname?\n\nScientists like Prof Higgs and clerics almost uniformly say they dislike it. Prof Higgs said he wished Lederman hadn’t done it. “I have to explain to people it was a joke,” said in a rare interview with The Guardian in 2007. “I’m an atheist, but I have an uneasy feeling that playing around with names like that could be unnecessarily offensive to people who are religious.”\n\nAnd how has Prof Higgs reacted to his celebrity?\n\nAsked how he feels about being stopped in the street now and asked for his autograph, he said: “It’s a bit of a nuisance sometimes, frankly.”"
