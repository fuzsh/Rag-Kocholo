He was 94.\n\nHe died on April 8 at his home, according to the University of Edinburgh, where he was professor emeritus. Higgs “was a remarkable individual — a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,” said Peter Mathieson, the university’s principal and vice chancellor."
