        "text": "Due to the diminutive size of individual atoms and molecules, often spanning only an Angstrom, or approximately (10^-10 meters), it follows that transitions and alterations occurring within these entities, which are predominantly driven by the behavior of electrons, can transpire within a timespan equivalent to the distance traversed by light in vacuum, divided by the speed of light, which is approximately 3 √ó 10‚Å∏ meters per second. This calculation yields durations on the order of attoseconds, with a solitary attosecond constituting a mere 10^-18 seconds. The capacity to capture visual data on such an exceptionally short timescale is indeed attainable, provided we are capable of generating laser pulses of sufficient brevity. This extraordinary achievement in ultrafast imaging has been acknowledged through the awarding of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L‚ÄôHuillier. The subsequent elucidation delves into the scientific underpinnings of this remarkable advancement. Read this üëáüëáfor a deeper understanding of the 2023 Nobel Prize work. #nobelprize2023 #scientificbreakthroughs #quantum #attosecond #atomicinsights #physicsnobellaureates\n\nThey said that #Wolfgand Pauli, a great Austrian #theoretical physicist and one of the pioneers of #quantum physics, caused all experimental equipment to break down simply by being in its vicinity... üòÄ Pauli was best known for formulating the Pauli #exclusion principle, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. In 1945 Pauli received the #Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle\". In 1930, Pauli was trying to explain why energy appeared not to be conserved in certain radioactive decays (beta decay), where electrons were being emitted, and he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton. He originally called it a #neutron, but that name was given to another particle, the one which of course we still call ‚Äúa neutron‚Äù. Enrico #Fermi, a great Italian physicist, called it then ‚Äú#neutrino‚Äù, which in Italian means ‚Äúlittle neutral one‚Äù. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan, two and a half years before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: \"Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli.\" Today, on the occasion of the 124th anniversary of Wolfgang #Pauli‚Äôs birth, let me encourage you to listen to my conversations with prof. Art McDonald and prof. Takaaki Kajita, two outstanding scientists awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for for the discovery of neutrino #oscillations and demonstrating that neutrinos have mass. You will find the links in the #COMMENT section.\n\nIn 1924 Albert Einstein predicted a new state of matter, the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) on the basis of quantum formulations by the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. Ever since, physicists tried to achieve this new fundamental state of matter. Seventy years passed before it finally happened on 5 June 1995. Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell at the University of Colorado Boulder NIST-JILA lab proved the phenomenon when they produced the first gaseous condensate in a rarefied gas of rubidium atoms at an extremely low temperature. They received the Nobel Prize in 2001.

The graphic shows three-dimensional successive snap shots in time in which the atoms condensed from less dense red, yellow and green areas into very dense blue to white areas.\n\nIn 1924 Albert Einstein predicted a new state of matter, the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), on the basis of quantum formulations by the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose.

It portrays a true dream team. I would like to know if there is a photo like this with contemporary scientists (with a capital \"S\"). I doubt it has the same relevance as this one. If you take a look at my LinkedIn profile, you will see that Mme Curie is my inspiration to be a better professional. I hope that my granddaughters have the opportunity to see, at the end of this century, an old photo with great Scientists, but with many more women than this one. #science #innovation #scientists"
