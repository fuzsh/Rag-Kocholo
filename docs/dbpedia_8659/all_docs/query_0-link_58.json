        "text": "On April 8 of this year, British physicist Peter Higgs died in Edinburgh, Scotland. He had redefined our entire understanding of the universe. His theories have led to a multitude of new discoveries along with giving a reason to fund and create the largest scientific experiment in history, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Specifically, Peter Higgs produced the theory which predicted a new fundamental particle called the Higgs Boson along with its associated field the Higgs field.\n\nPeter Higgs was born on 29 May 1929 Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. For his university education, he attended the University of London. In 1950, Higgs graduated with a bachelor’s degree with First Class Honors in Physics. He was awarded with a PhD four years later for a thesis on some of the problems with the theory of molecular vibrations. Peter Higgs married a lecturer named Jody Williamson and they had two children together, Christopher and Johnathan Higgs. After the theory which predicted the Higgs Boson gained attention, many physicists started to believe in the Higgs Boson and Peter Higgs was honored. He has won multiple awards and has received multiple honorary degrees. However, the most important award that Higgs ever won was the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 after the Higgs Boson was discovered in 2012 at CERN.\n\nPeter Higgs’ Nobel Prize win begs the question of what exactly his discovery was? Basically, Peter Higgs discovered what gives particles their mass. Specifically, he discovered the Higgs field. Fields, in the context of particle physics, are continuous fluid-like substances which are spread throughout the entire universe. The Higgs boson, and any particle associated with a field, is a wave in its associated field. Particles interact with the Higgs field and thus gain their mass. However, not all particles interact with the Higgs field with the same strength. For example, a proton, which has more mass, interacts more with the Higgs field than the electron, which has less mass. Ironically, Peter Higgs did not want the particle which he discovered to be named after him, a common trend in science which often leads people to think that scientists are egotistical.\n\nPeter Higgs truly was a physics revolutionary. He greatly expanded our understanding of the universe and brought new ideas to the forefront of physics. His ideas have inspired so many that they cannot be counted. Therefore, let us remember Peter Higgs as a devoted, talented, and humble scientist.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/peter-higgs-a-giant-of-particle-physics-dies-at-94\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/higgs/biographical\n\nhttps://royalsociety.org/people/peter-higgs-11615\n\nhttps://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/peter-higgs-a-giant-of-particle-physics-dies-at-94"
