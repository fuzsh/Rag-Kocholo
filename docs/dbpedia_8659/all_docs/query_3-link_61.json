(University of Edinburgh)\n\nProfessor Peter Higgs has died at the age of 94, the University of Edinburgh confirmed yesterday, adding that he passed away peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness.\n\nProfessor Higgs earned global acclaim for his prediction in 1964 that theorized the existence of a previously unknown particle, later known as the Higgs boson. This pioneering insight paved the way for a new understanding of particle physics.\n\nThe theoretical existence of the Higgs boson remained unproven for nearly 50 years, until 2012, when its presence was finally detected through sophisticated experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider, operated by CERN. This discovery provided empirical validation of Higgs’ theoretical framework, marking a significant milestone in the field of physics.\n\nIn recognition of his seminal contribution to physics, Professor Higgs, alongside Francois Englert, was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013. Beyond his contributions to theoretical physics, Higgs is celebrated for his role as an educator and mentor, having nurtured and inspired countless young scientists throughout his career. His ability to convey complex scientific concepts and ignite a passion for discovery in his students has left an indelible mark on the scientific community.\n\n“Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual – a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us. His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come,” said Professor Sir Peter Mathieson, Principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh."
