        "text": "British scientist Peter Higgs, the man behind the concept of the Higgs boson particle, passed away at the age of 94. He was honoured with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 for his groundbreaking research elucidating the role of the boson in the cohesion of the universe.\n\nEdinburgh University, in a statement, announced his demise in the city on Monday (April 8), praising him as an exceptionally talented scientist whose innovative ideas have expanded our understanding of the world.\n\nProf Brian Cox paid tribute to Higgs on X (formally known as Twitter): \"I was fortunate enough to meet him several times, and beyond being a famous physicist - I think to his embarrassment at times - he was always charming and modest.\n\n\"His name will be remembered as long as we do physics in the form of the Higgs Boson.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Higgs and fellow physicists developed a theory to clarify why the fundamental components of the Universe possess mass.\n\nIt sparked a hunt for the ultimate particle to explain three fundamental forces. In 2012, the Large Hadron Collider found it and named it the Higgs boson.\n\n\"From the mind of Professor Higgs came ideas which have had a profound impact on our understanding of the Universe, of matter and of mass,\" said Alan Barr, Professor of Physics at University of Oxford, in reaction to the news.\n\n\"He proposed the existence of a field that pervades the entire universe, that mass to particles from electrons to top quarks.\"\n\n\"He was also a true gentleman, humble and polite, always giving due credit to others, and gently encouraging future generations of scientists and scholars,\" he added.\n\nAlso read | US, China, Australia identified as hotspots for harmful ‘forever chemicals’, says news study\n\nQuiet man behind the Boson: Peter Higgs' simple life\n\nOriginally from Newcastle upon Tyne, he is survived by two sons, Chris and Jonny, and his daughter-in-law Suzanne, along with two grandchildren. His wife, Jody, passed away in 2008.\n\nHe also felt uneasy about the particle being solely associated with his name, expressing that the recognition overlooked the contributions of others involved.\n\nParticle physicist Brian Cox, a professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester, said Prof Higgs' name \"will be remembered as long as we do physics,\" as cited by Sky News."
