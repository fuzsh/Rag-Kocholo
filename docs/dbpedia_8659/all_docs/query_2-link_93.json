        "text": "He shares the prize with colleague Francois Englert.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the two scientists for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles.\n\nThe physics prize announcement was delayed by one hour, which is highly unusual. The academy gave no immediate reason, other than saying on Twitter that it was still in session at the original announcement time.\n\nThe academy decides the winners in a majority vote on the day of the announcement.\n\nNewcastle-born Professor Higgs, 83, gave his name to the Higgs boson, which scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - the Â£2.6bn Big Bang atom-smasher near Geneva, Switzerland - believe they discovered in July, having hit on the concept in the 1960s.\n\nThe quiet physicist, now retired from the University of Edinburgh, has become a global celebrity as creator of the theory behind the 'God particle'.\n\nProf Higgs, 83, wrote two scientific papers - the second of which was initially rejected and then finally published in the respected journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nProf Higgs' groundbreaking proposal was that particles acquire mass by interacting with an all-pervading field spread throughout the universe. The more they interact, the more massive and heavy they become.\n\nA ''boson'' particle was needed to carry and transmit the effect of the field - the Higgs boson.\n\nDr Frances Saunders, president of the Institute of Physics, said: \"The work undertaken to discover the Higgs - from the original theories to the construction of the worlds most powerful particle-smasher - has led to a very exciting and productive period in physics research. It has been a long journey but one that has inspired a generation to engage with the subject.\n\n\"With the existence of the Higgs boson confirmed, explaining why the fundamental building blocks of nature acquire mass, we can now move on to the next challenges to our understanding such as the phenomena of dark matter and quantum gravity.\"\n\nProfessor Michael Duff, chair of theoretical physics at Imperial College London, said the Higgs boson theory will remain part of human understanding for centuries.\n\nHe said: \"I am delighted to hear that Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, which is richly deserved. Their seminal contributions, along with those of Tom Kibble here at Imperial College, explaining how elementary particles acquire a mass, form a vital part of the Standard Model of particle physics, pioneered by Imperial Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam."
