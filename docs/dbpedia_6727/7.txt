INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTERWORLD A Fortnightly November 1-15, 1995, Vol. 1, No. 1. Rs. 15/copy WINDOWS 95: 100,000 Win 95 users within one year! Close to over two months of its “official” launch, Windows 95 is finally with its three Indian dis¬ tributors and 600 resellers. And Microsoft’s plans for the product are ambitious to say the least. While the company is not committing on numbers, the ex¬ pectations are that “Windows 95 will ship in the thousands.” “Our hope is that within the next 12 months, we should have at least as many as 1 ,00,000 to a quarter of a million users of Wmdows 95 in the country. These will include our retail shipments as well as PC ship¬ ments that will go with the new op¬ erating system,” informed Rajiv Nair, country manager, India, Microsoft Corporation. “Product availability is going to be the key” and the primary USP for Microsoft. The company hopes to achieve this goal on the strength of its channel partners that are currently present in virtu¬ ally every nook and cranny of the country. “We are providing cus¬ tomers product availability in al¬ most all parts of the country— whether in a small city like Gangtok, or large city like Bom¬ bay. Our resellers are not only sell¬ ing, but also supporting the cus¬ tomers.” According to Microsoft the idea behind having a mammoth listing of resellers and distributors is that the “user gets the best pos¬ sible price.” “There is such a competitive spirit. The user always benefits from this. The user gets a product at the floor price. In cases where there is a single distributor, the pricing levels are different and in fact dictated by the distributor. It is virtually a monopoly situation,” Nair added. WINDOWS 95, page 6 Will Windows 95 Kill OS/2? SOUND OFFS See IN-DEPTH, page 115 Yes! Says, Vinod Chopra, Director, MicroMpi Pvt, Ltd. No!

MICROSOFT’S savvy and hype laden launch of Windows 95 has ensured that Windows 95 will be foremost in the minds of IS managers and other end users as they work out their IT strategies. “We do see a number of clients enquiring about Windows 95,” said Abhishek Mukherjee, country manager in India for Compaq Computer Corp. “The amount of noise generated by the world media on the launch of this product has been phenomenal, which has also had its impact here. We expect almost all our customers to take a long hard look at the benefits of migrating to Windows 95 before the end of the year.” Vendors are however not expecting a groundswell of demand for Windows 95 based systems any time soon. ^ The Window Opens It's been something of a festival for users across the world, and in particular in the U.S. The much- awaited launch of Windows 95 — the new “evolutionary/revolution¬ ary” operating system from soft¬ ware juggernaut, Microsoft Corp. — has truly been an affair to remember. The carnival atmos¬ phere, the gaitey surrounding the debut, the unbelievable hype, the gala launch — inside a gigantic tent in Microsoft’s Redmond, Wash¬ ington campus — the company made commercially available its 32-bit operating system, which ef¬ fectively does away with MS DOS and gives Windows features comparable to the Mac. Across the US, computer stores stayed open to accommo¬ date potential buyers. Some even held events to build on the frenzy surrounding the system. In India, meanwhile, the jam¬ boree was kept at a more modest staggering support from Microsoft’s vendor partners, have all made Windows 95, the hottest prod¬ uct to ever make an appearance on the show-windows of companies this cen¬ tury. Starting out with a mark — the decibels were lower and the orchestra played more so¬ ber tunes. For starters, Microsoft India did not have any “beta” pro¬ gram to speak of for Indian users. Even as users across the globe went through “eight-Betas” — es¬ sentially close encounters of the Win-kind that created an excite¬ ment of their own — Indian users remained largely untouched by the new generation software. Any copies of Win 95 that were avail¬ able in the country were with soft¬ ware developers/exporters to give them a chance to get cracking on the new OS. The “launch” essentially was a series of press and user meets in late August in New Delhi, Bom¬ bay, Madras, Calcutta and Hyderabad, which announced the “arrival” of Windows 95. The ac¬ tual “date of shipment,” however was fixed for mid-September, thereby killing off any chance of a post-launch hysteria arising out of actually having the product in hand. “The original Windows launch had more significance for the IT industry than Windows 95. Windows changed the way each one of us worked. Windows 95 will not. There is actually nothing earth shaking about the new features in Win¬ dows 95.” Hari Balasubramanian, General Manager, MIS, Modi Xerox Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 News “We have Windows 3.1 running on aii our machines and would prefer to shift to Windows 95 en-masse and not in parts. We will therefore wait for another six months until our machines are suitably upgraded.” S.R. Baiasubramanian, General Manager, IT, Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Limited. While Microsoft India at¬ tempted to create a stir — with its advertisement campaign on Doordarshan, and sneak-peeks for the press — it has been nowhere close to the frenetic marketing and brand building activity taking place in the Western world. And in a certain way, this has probably led to the slightly luke¬ warm response for Windows 95 from the IS community in the country. While the Window 95 launch seminars across the met¬ ros elicited a highly satisfactory response — ranging from 4,000 us¬ ers in Bombay to 1,000 attendees in Calcutta — IS managers, by and large have been less than passion¬ ate about the software and in fact are adopting a “wait and watch” attitude before taking what might be the inevitable plunge. Hari Baiasubramanian, gen¬ eral manager, MIS, Modi Xerox Limited, felt the product was good and “when the initial version bugs are fixed, will be a pleasure to use.” “It is expected to make the lives of 70 million users world¬ wide easier, though it has been sort of late in coming. The 2600 util¬ ity software which will run on Win 95 is not 32-bit software and hence the full potential of Win¬ dows 95 will be evident only in good time. The original Windows launch had more significance for the IT industry than Windows 95. Windows changed the way each one of us worked. Windows 95 will not. There is actually nothing earth shaking about the new fea¬ tures in Windows 95,” Baiasubramanian added. The issue of upgradation seems to be the key. “While the minimum RAM requirement for Win 95 is not a constraint for us, as far as the hard disk goes, we may have some problems. We will have to upgrade the disk and an upgrade will need at least Rs. 3,000 per system. As we have a very large number of PCs on our premises, this amount will work out as slightly unreasonable. What we were hoping for was that Microsoft would have a slightly more reasonable pricing arrange¬ ment, particularly for the large corporate houses,” said R.R. Singh, director of Income Tax, (Systems). “Windows 95 seems to be an excellent product, but moving over to it, overnight will not be possible. The need to upgrade the hard disk is a big problem as against the need for 16 MB RAM. While Microsoft is claiming that Win 95 will run on 8 MB RAM, we believe that for the kind of ap¬ plications we have, 16 MB will be a must,” commented K.S. Mukherjee of Compaq expects that the increased requirements of hardware to run Windows 95 will act as a deterrent to most corporations in the short term. “ In the medium term we expect almost ail large accounts to migrate out of Windows into either Windows 95 or NT,” said Mukherjee. “Our estimate is that we will see significant shipments of systems preconfigured with Windows 95 by the end of the next quarter. By the first quarter of next year, we should see almost all new PC shipments preconfigured with Windows 95.” Other vendors too are cautiously optimistic. “We feel that the launch of Windows 95 has been a very high visibility one, and has aroused a lot of excitement among customers,” said Samir Kumar, marketing manager at Wipro Acer Limited. “How much of this translates into product sales is to be seen. However the public statements of the Microsoft personnel indicate that they are optimistic of good volume shipments.” L.P. Suresh Babu, group product manager of Digital Equipment (India) Limited’s PC Business Unit expects segments such as software exporters, developers, multinational business houses will be among the early adopters of Windows 95. ISVs developing software for markets outside India are already ordering Windows 95. Indeed uncertainty about demand for Windows 95 has renewed optimism in the OS/2 Warp camp that end users and ISVs may migrate to either Windows 95 or OS/2 Warp. Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 News News 8 News “Yes, there will be some demand for Windows 95, but I don’t see a groundswell. My estimate is that about 30,000 boxes may ship with Windows 95 in the next 12 months,” said Naren Ayyar, general manager of Tata Informa¬ tion System Limited’s Personal Systems Division. The controversy surrounding the map of India in the software may prove to be more conten¬ tious than was earlier expected. One ISV, Peutronics, the developers of the Tally accounting software, announced plans that it will release only the OS/2 and Mac versions of its next version of Tally. “We had the Windows 95 beta, and we also have a prototype of Tally on Windows 95, but we decided against releasing the software until the map issue gets resolved,” said Bharat Goenka, Director of Peutronics. Although they do not have a definite fix on the size of the Windows 95 market, vendors are gearing up to meet the demand when it builds up. Compaq will start preloading all its systems with Windows 95 from this month. Mukherjee said that Compaq would do a dual install of both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 on PCs shipped by it. At time of installation, the customer has the option of choosing which OS will get installed, while the other OS will be automatically wiped off. Wipro Acer too plans to ship its Windows 95 models from this month. Digital worldwide has started shipping dual factory installed software of Windows For Workgroup and Windows 95. Suresh Babu of DEIL said his company too would adopt a similiar ^ Microsoft blitzkrieg IF you were a techno-dweeb who never really grew up and you ate too much ice cream before falling asleep, imagine what your dreams would be like. How about a a giant Windows 95 box sail¬ ing into Sydney Harbour in Australia with musicians and dancers? Cool, dude. Or maybe you suddenly find yourself in Toronto, and one day a giant letter ‘O’ appears on the top of the city's tallest building. Then every day thereafter, another letter mysteriously appears until the letters spell “Win¬ dows 95” on a banner 300 feet tall. Or you dream you’re a journalist in Poland being taken down beneath the ocean in a sub¬ marine “to show them what the world would be like without Windows.” Or you snap on the TV in the Philippines and see the presi¬ dent, Fidel Ramos, receiving the first copy of Windows 95. But wait, this is no dream. These are all events that have taken place as part of Microsof Corp.’s worldwide launch of Windows 95. In fact, as Microsoft rolled out its new desktop operating sys¬ tem, the hype and hoopla were intense. • In New Zealand, TV stations carried live the sale of the first copy of Windows 95 at midnight. • In Paris, a Windows 95 Car from Citreon, with logos on the side, was to pick up Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates at the Paris airport and take him to an event in the Palais des Congres. • In Italy, Microsoft distributed Windows 95 and Office 95 demo disks in railway stations and airports. Gates launched the product on Lake Como on a boat fly¬ ing the Windows 95 flag. Talk about a blitz! Chandra (CC&C), SAIL. Some users are also of the opinion that Microsoft should have made known the hardware demands of Windows 95, much before its actual release. “In our organisation, for instance, we re¬ cently acquired many PC/386 ma¬ chines (with 8 MB RAM and 210 MB HDD). These would need an upgrade now. If we had known this requirement, we would have prepared in advance. Moreover, we have Windows 3.1 running on all our machines and would pre¬ fer to shift to Windows 95 en- masse and not in parts. We will therefore wait for another six months until our machines are suitably upgraded,” said S.R. Balasubramanian, of Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Limited. The obvious inference is also that Win 95 will drive the hard¬ ware market. “We are likely to see fresh buyers and a feverish move towards upgrades to the existing hardware. This will spell an im¬ mediate demise of the 386 proc¬ essor-based PCs,” added S.R. Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 9 News Win-some, lose some? Rajiv Nair, Country Manager, India, Microsoft Corp., on the Windows 95 phenomenon. On Windows 95 marketing strategy The product is being sold through our distributors and 600 resellers in the channel today. It is also be¬ ing licensed to hardware manu¬ facturers such as HCL HP, Acer, Olivetti, PCL and most of the major companies in the country. People who buy these machines will also have the option of buy¬ ing the machine with Windows 95. Users can also go to the retail market. We are catering to the home market by making available Windows 95 in bookstores, in de¬ partment stores, computer outlets, etc. We want to make sure that no matter what comer you turn in your neighbourhood, Win 95 and Office 95 are available. Product availability is going to be the key. On User Response to Win 95 People think Windows 95 and Office 95 are great, great products. That has become very clear. We have seen it in the launches. We have covered close to 50,000 peo¬ ple and they’ve been very excited about Win 95 and Office 95. On Windows 95 Pricing I think the pricing is good, and the pricing is right for the Indian market, I think that in itself will be a key contributor to the prod¬ uct selling very well. On What’s New in Windows 95 Vis-a-Vis OS/2 and Mac I agree that some of the features are common, but a lot depends on how you implement these fea¬ tures. I think Windows 95 takes the best in the Mac and the best in OS/2, combines them, adds more and, makes it even more user friendly for the customer. 1 think Win 95 is IBM’s OS/2, plus Ap¬ ple’s Mac rolled into one with a lot more stuff like Microsoft’s plug-and-play technology, inter¬ active user interface and 32-bit ar¬ chitecture. The other advantage is that Win 95, unlike the Mac, rounds up a wide range of Intel clients. So the user does not have to go out and buy the hardware all over again or software, and invest¬ ments are preserved. On Upgrading Hardware for Windows 95 The design goal for Win 95 was that if you have a 4MB, 386DX machine today. Win 95 will give the same performance, the same robustness as you would get with Win 3.1. But the additional ben¬ efits you get are the user interface, the plug and play features, etc. Now obviously as the RAM in¬ creases, so does Win 95 ’s capa¬ bility and performance. But that does not mean that a person with 4MB RAM or 8MB RAM is de¬ bilitated. Really there are no costs in¬ volved unless you want to do more things like multimedia ap¬ plications or Internet connectivity with your PC. Only then do you have to upgrade. Impact On Corporate Buyers I think it will be huge. I won’t quantify it, because it is too early. But from what I am seeing right now, it is going to be huge. strategy for the Indian market when it starts shipping in September. A key issue determin¬ ing how quickly end users transition to Windows 95 is likely to be the cost of right sizing their investments for optimum use of Windows 95. Though the OS itself has been priced aggres¬ sively in most end users’ opinion, Windows 95, say analysts, will require larger memory and hard disk capacity, and a fast Pentium or at least high /lOR rDI 1 All that carries a large price tag. Mukherjee said Compaq has been shipping Windows 95 ready systems for most of the last 12 months. That said, most users with 4 MB systems will need to purchase additional RAM and storage space. But the number of users who have systems with 4 MB RAM are predominant, and only slowly moving to 8 MB, said Ayyar of TISL, and that may prove to be a disincentive. “TISL would as per our policy align with the announcements by IBM PC Co. in Asean/Asia Pacific for announcing any products bundles,” added Ayyar. “I am not the expert but I hear 16 MB is the best configuration for Win 95 though it can manage to run on 12 MB. Price depends on what the customer wants to do— whether he is using Win95 features or planning to run an application on top of it.” Vishwa Kiran, the chief executive of Delta Software Systems, said he expected most users would initially balk at the around Rs. 5000 or so needed to add 4 MB to their current 4 MB systems. “I feel they will try to manage with 4 MB and upgrade to 8 MB and 486 DX2 systems in three ^ Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 News News 10 News to four months if the applications are slow,” he added. Delta is one of the few ISVs that is already offering a Windows 95 version of its Flash financial accounting software. Peutronics’ Goenka said that though a large number of end users will eventually go in for Windows 95, it will not be the dominant PC environ¬ ment for these users. “Most applications are in- house, and very little development gets done on Windows in the first place. For example most financial applications get developed on DOS,” explained Goenka. Unlike in the US and other markets where the ISVs have made a beeline to offer Windows 95 applications, the ISV activity in India is generally low key, perhaps, say analysts because there are very few ISVs doing product software develop¬ ment for the local market.” What apps? There are no apps other than us and one or two others in other segments,” said Vishwa Kiran. “The only other apps have been MS Office and other similiar apps, mostly pirated. If the ISVs live up to their promise, we might see more competi¬ tion soon. Many of them have announced plans.” “Windows 95 runs all Windows apps. We expect that the first benefit of Windows 95 that users will see is the improved interface and multitasking,” said Mukherjee of Compaq. “This additional benefit of the speed of running a 32- bit implementation will come later, possibly as late as Q3 of 1996. So I don’t expect ISV activity to be a major factor in the success of Windows 95 in India or abroad in the short term.” H Balasubramanian. Neelam Dhawan, marketing manager, HCL-HP agreed. HCL- HP which has entered into a li¬ censing arrangement with Microsoft for reproducing Win¬ dows 95, has announced the avail¬ ability of the software with its ma¬ chines. The company is offering its users a choice between Win¬ dows for Workgroups and Win 95. “The hardware market will clearly be driven by Win 95. For one, CD-ROMs have become a default standard thanks to the launch of Win 95. In fact, follow¬ ing the Microsoft example, a number of other leading software vendors such as SCO, Novell, etc. have also introduced their soft¬ ware on CD-ROMs. Next, there is the issue of the memory. Most users are going to upgrade to 8 MB RAM. Together the memory and CD-ROM have hiked the sys¬ tem price by almost Rs. 17,000. Win 95 is obviously going to be good for vendors,” said Dhawan. In fact, HCL-HP is offering its users a “special upgrade kit for Win 95, including 4MB RAM, a CD ROM drive and Win 95” for Rs. 17,000. As yet HCL has received over 400 orders from users for Win 95 on their machines. The users are obviously not going mad. “It’s re¬ ally been a case of wait and watch,” Dhawan said. According to Rakesh Suri of DCM Data Systems, Win 95 will be responsible for increasing the per unit revenue of PCs shipped because of the optimum 8 MB/ 16 MB RAM and 540 MB HDD re¬ quirement. No matter what the vendors hope, Indian IS users are going to take their time before jump¬ ing on the Win 95 bandwagon. In fact, as PCL’s Sameer Kochar said, “Win 95 will be an issue in 1996 rather than ’95. This year has seen a surge in the sale of Win 3.1 and there are even a vast majority of users that are yet to graduate beyond DOS. If you look at it in totality, the cost of ownership of Win 95 is still high. Win 95 needs a 486 sys¬ tem with a recommended RAM of 8 MB. Not many users in In¬ dia have that kind of power. The initial base of Win 95 will per¬ haps come from the MNC brands. In the short term, Win 95 is unlikely to generate any substantial growth in terms of number of CPUs sold. Users will be driven by their application needs more than the need for the latest version of Windows.” “The IS community will need to ask a few basic ques¬ tions before subscribing to the Win 95 hype,” cautioned Hari Balasubramanian, Modi Xerox. “I think the IS users will have to show responsibil¬ ity and maturity in approach¬ ing such releases. Win 95 is good software — nothing more. It is being projected as some¬ thing more.” ?

But if you’ve missed ri¬ val Apple Computer, Inc.’s coun¬ terattack you probably just blinked. Although Graham Brown, managing director, India, of Ap¬ ple Computer International Ltd., is convinced that Windows 95 “has not caught up with the Mac by any stretch of the imagina¬ tion” and that the US based computer maker has several aces up its sleeve to promote the Mac OS, though not against Windows 95 — the efforts are barely visible compared to Microsoft’s mammoth media blitz. That could be a problem, despite the fact that according to some observers, Apple is reap¬ ing the kind of publicity money can’t buy, given the constant comparisons between Windows 95 and the Mac OS. While internationally Apple has been countering Windows 95 by barraging the media, industry analysts and the on-line world with daily releases touting the Macintosh’s advantages over Windows 95, the Mac counter¬ attack in India is expected to be more low-key. Indian users, unlike their US counterparts, are not likely to see T-shirts bearing the slogan “Been there. ..done that” that list the Mac’s technological advantages and the year these features were implemented. Apple in India will forsake gimmickry for a more focused assault featuring enhanced adver¬ tising budgets and more user awareness workshops. The com¬ of its own technology — its ben¬ efits and its applications — in¬ stead of attempting to take on the might of Microsoft in India. In a sense the company is moving against the tide. India is predomi¬ nantly Intel country and the Mac base is also extremely limited. Apple in India will be empha¬ sising more on extolling the vir¬ tues of the Mac, rather than in¬ dulging in any real Microsoft bashing. At the mo¬ ment the Apple man- pany for instance is organising “family computing workshops” to push its Performa — the solu¬ tion for the home segment. Simi¬ larly, the Apple Yatra has been tom-tomming the Apple cause in the publishing sector. Apple in¬ tends to highlight the strengths agement in the country is talking about Win¬ dows 95 as a tech¬ nology that’s catching up, rather than over-shooting the Mac OS. “Windows 95 is a good upgrade to the previous ver¬ sion Windows 3.1. We’ve been giving our users for years what Windows 95 is claim¬ ing to give today,” commented Brown. Indian users of the Mac too are not overly concerned about the Windows 95 versus Mac de¬ bate. Said Bhupesh Dang, of Flex India: “Windows 95 ’s features such as multimedia, animation facilities, etc., have been with the Mac for a long time. Dedicated users of Mac are not going to shift to Windows 95.” Flex India' is currently an owner of six Power Macs which are being used for graphic appli¬ cations. According to D.K. Bardhan, senior manager systems. Living Media India Ltd., “We will like to wait and see Windows 95 per¬ formance. I don’t think Windows 95 will affect the Mac following in India because Windows 95 has succeeded in copying the Mac OS, not superceding it.” Bradhan is currently on PowerPC sys¬ tems, which replaced the earlier base of Macintosh machines. Niyam Bhushan, Proprietor, Laughing Buddha Computers of New Delhi said: “The backlash has begun to occur. Firstly, one has to follow an extremely com¬ plicated and cumbersome proce¬ dure for installing Win 95. Sec¬ ondly, a significant number of us¬ ers worldwide have reported a vi¬ rus problem which makes instal¬ lation beyond disk 1 impossible. Thirdly, the long delays that a user faces in getting on-line sup¬ port from Microsoft is a major issue.” “A number of users have painfully upgraded their existing hardware in terms of expensive RAM, more storage disk and preferably more powerful proc¬ essors.

ANDY DlRECT/RP.27 16 News have dis¬ covered that their existing applications have yet to be optimised for Windows 95. Users have also complained about Win 95 saying that the software tends to conflict with their browsers and other Internet utilities,” Bhushan added. Another dedicated Mac user. Jay Kumar, senior DTP operator at CMG Graphics Delhi felt that he would remain a committed Mac user on account of the fact that the Mac provided better resolution of graphics. “IBM sys¬ tems are relatively difficult to use as is also the Windows environ¬ ment.” “We intend to keep pushing our technology and our innova¬ tions and will continue to give our users more and more differ¬ entiating features on the Mac, away from Windows 95,” said Graham Brown. The company is banking on the fact that the world is gradu¬ ally moving towards RISC, which will turn into a major ad¬ vantage for Apple. “At some stage a change will come into the Windows world or Wintel world, where they’ll have to move to RISC, they’ll have to get the op¬ erating systems to take advantage of it, they’ll have to get the ap¬ plications to take advantage of it. Today Apple has done all that. We have gone through that migration. That is going to be a significant edge we will have,” Brown added. “The second thing is that we are licensing our operating sys¬ tem. We have a number of licen¬ sees including companies like Radius, Power Computing, and Pioneer, etc. and we are begin¬ ning see the arrival of the Mac- compatibles in the market. At some stage these products will come to India as well. Further¬ more, another positive fact for us is that IBM has announced that it is going to have the Mac OS available on its hardware, which ought to give the OS a big boost,” Brown opined. According to K.K. Gupta, deputy general manager, Infor¬ mation Technology of Dabur In¬ dia Ltd., price and compatibility will remain the two key issues as far as the popularity of Mac in the country is concerned. “The installed base of PCs is growing and new users are going to opt for Windows 95. Since team computing has become the order of day, most corporate users will go for Windows 95,” said Gupta. “Even if Mac prices come down, Apple will not be able to cut into the PC market. Although it is a fact that what Windows 95 is providing today — like the GUI environment — Mac users were getting nearly a decade ago. The biggest problem with Mac users is that they cannot share their data with other users. While of late Apple has been promising that software for sharing files will be available to the custom¬ ers, it still remains an issue. At Dabur, we have over 350 PCs and just 25 Macintosh machines. The cost of the Mac is prohibi¬ tive, which is why most users today are preferring to go for PCs.” Compaq slashes PC prices to initiate new price war In a bid to consolidate its leader¬ ship of the PC market, Compaq Corp. announced aggressive price reductions of up to 25 percent across its commercial and con¬ sumer desktop product families. Analysts expect that the competi¬ tion will respond soon with price cuts of their own. Compaq also in¬ troduced nine new commercial desktop computers based on the 133 MHz Pentium microproces¬ sor, the fastest in the Intel range. It raised the standard minimum hard disk drive size from 270 MB to 630 MB throughout its com¬ mercial desktop families, and is leveraging its role as the lead systems partner for Windows 95 to lead the way in addressing Win¬ dows 95 market opportu¬ nities. “In India our aim was to announce the new prices within a few days of the announcement in the US,” said Compaq’s country manager for India, Abhishek Mukheijee. “This price reduction and product enhancement will en¬ able us to retain our leadership role among all international brands in India.” “By combining quality and useful innovation with aggressive prices, Compaq is aiming to recast the competitive PC landscape with a barrage of new aggressively priced products,” said Compaq president and chief executive officer, Eckhard Pfeiffer. ‘Compaq re-wrote the book in 1992 when it comes to value and performance, and with these aggres¬ sive price reductions, powerful new desktop PCs, and sweeping product enhancements, we’re adding a new chapter.” Building on its leadership po¬ sition in the worldwide PC indus¬ try and its strategic role as the Microsoft Lead Systems Partner for Windows 95, Compaq is mov¬ ing to further increase its market share. Analysts are positive about Compaq’s recent announcement. “In the second quarter, Compaq has outpaced all rivals by nearly 400,000 shipments and is well po¬ sitioned to lead the market at year end for the second consecutive year,” said a Dataquest analyst. Compaq has reduced prices in both its commercial and consumer PC lines by 15 to 25 percent. Price cuts on the Presario desk¬ top line range from about Rs. 6400 on the Presario CDS 744 to over Rs. 18,000 on the 100 MHz Pentium based Presario CDS 992. Nine new high performance 133 MHz Pentium based models with 16 MB of memory and 1 GB hard drives will be avail¬ able in volume by the end of the third quarter. Analysts said these large capacity machines, as well as Compaq’s decision to enhance the minimum hard disk capacity of its entire desktop range to 630 MB was aimed at grabbing a sig¬ nificant position of the Windows 95 market which is likely to de¬ mand PCs with large memory, storage, and speed. For the last 14 months Compaq has been shipping Win¬ dows 95 ready products and prod¬ ucts with plug-and-play capabili¬ ties. Compaq and Microsoft worked closely throughout the development of Windows 95, in¬ vesting more than 50 man years in joint testing and development.

Ltd. has delivered a storage management package that breaks through the Unix file system’s traditional limi¬ tations. SGS’s Irix Networker 4.11 backup and archiving applica¬ tion can theoretically support individual files as large as 17 terabytes and an overall file system as large as 17 million terabytes. Unix file systems have limits of 8 GB. “Today, the disk sizes are becoming larger and larger. In fact, the average size of databases has been doubling every six months. It is not un¬ common to see large compa¬ How high can you count? If there were such a thing as a one-petabyte disk drive, you could store more than 160,000 feature- length movies on it. A petabyte contains one quadreiliion bytes.

With the advent of 64-bit comput¬ ing, the major bottleneck of ability to address more than 2 GB of contiguous disk area has been raised to 17 million terabytes (this is more than the total disks produced so far). With this growth in database sizes, problems such as backup, archival and storage management have become an important function within the MIS department. This is ex¬ actly where a software like Irix Networker 4.11 comes handy,” informed Sundar Iyer of Silicon Graphics Sys¬ tems India. With major customers clamoring for rapid, random access to gargantuan data ar¬ chives, Silicon Graphics chose to roll its own storage manage¬ ment application because off- the-shelf packages couldn’t cut the mustard. But instead of starting from scratch, the com¬ pany — known for its digital graphics wizardry — trans¬ formed a 32-bit application into a 64 bit screamer. Under an OEM agreement, Silicon Graphics Inc., meta¬ morphosed Legato Systems, Inc.’s Networker backup and archiving application into Irix Networker 4.11. “Irix Networker 4.11 is available with various options with a basic price starting from Rs. 89,000 onwards, going up to Rs. 11 lakhs for more than 64 clients,” Iyer added. According to Iyer, any cus¬ tomer with a database larger than 2 GB is a potential cus¬ tomer for Silicon Graphics. ‘With our 64-bit file system called XFS, NFS V.3 and the highly scalable 64-bit Chal¬ lenge Servers, Silicon Graph¬ ics Systems is in an advanta¬ geous position to address the large database market.” ^ Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 Apart from crystal clear sound, DAKTMAIL can also handle colour images and page upon page of text.

New 32-bit versions of Word Pro (formerly Ami Pro) word processing software, 1-2-3 spreadsheet software and the Ap¬ proach desktop database will fol¬ low. The network-enabled Free¬ lance Graphics for Windows 95 was written from the ground up in 32-bit code and integrated with Notes. We would like to see a total domi¬ nance in the LAN market as far as suites are concerned. The com¬ ing five years belong to Lotus in the suite range,” said Rahul Nanda, country manager, Lotus India. Team computing essentially implies team reviews, document management, consolidation and productivity enhancement tools which allow people to work to¬ gether. Accord¬ ing to Lo¬ tus, this time around the company is ready for the new re¬ lease of Win¬ dows. “People will recall that Lotus was one of the last players to see a new price structure being offered by Lotus to the distribu¬ tor for the same software. This pricing structure will be much better than what is being offered by our competitors,” Rahul Nanda said. SmartSuite for Windows 95 will be available with Lotus India at the end of October and the price is expected to be the same as that for Win 3.1 applications. “Cur¬ rently we have launched a buyers assurance program in which us¬ ers have been offered a free li¬ cense to Smartsuite 96 on Win 95. We have also offered a free license for the next version of Smartsuite on Win 3.1 which is Smartsuite 4.0. So no user, who is making his investment today, even in a Win¬ dows 3. 1 environment lies unpro¬ tected,” Nanda informed. Lotus however is not expect¬ ing a clean sweep for Windows 95. “I don’t see a very large mar- Lotus Development Corp. has shot the Windows 95 version of SmartSuite out of the gate with team computing and productivity enhancements. It hopes these features will lure users to the applications portfolio and the Notes workgroup system. According to analysts the most enticing features in the new version are Team Computing and Content SmartMasters. “Lotus has built its suites strat¬ egy around team computing, which is going to become a real¬ ity in the Indian context. With the number of LANs growing in the market, suites with team comput¬ ing capabilities, are becoming a reality. Lotus is the first and cur¬ rently the only suite range which offers team computing facilities. enter the Windows market with its suite range the last time around. There is no such thing this time,” Nanda added. According to the company, Lotus Smartsuite offers users more software for the money that is spent. The positioning of the product is definitely not that of a low-priced offering. Instead the idea is to offer a client more soft¬ ware for the money that he spends. “However, India is an extremely price-conscious market and Lotus will be in line with the pricing trends. With Windows 95 you will ket in India for Windows 95 itself. In the event of there being a large market for Windows 95 we are positioned for a kill with the right products in place. In the event of Windows 95 succeeding, Lotus users will not feel let down by a Lotus non-presence in this mar¬ ket,” commented Nanda. Lotus Smartsuite users mean¬ while welcomed the arrival of the Windows 95 versions of the soft¬ ware. According to Gagan Setia, MIS manager, Samtel Corpora¬ tion: “Lotus SmartSuite provides a corporate user ease-of-working at an incredible price that ranges between Rs. 61,800 and Rs. 1,10 lakhs. The fact that SmartSuite 96 on Windows 95 is expected to be priced as reasonably, is going to be a big advantage for Lotus.” R. R. Singh, Director of In¬ come Tax Systems reiterated the sentiment that Lotus SmartSuite for Windows 95 would have an edge on price. “We have gone in for Lotus SmartSuite as it matched the specifications of our organi¬ sation. After doing technical analysis and commercial evalua¬ tion, we found that the Lotus SmartSuite range is the only rea¬ sonably priced and platform-inde¬ pendent software. All the GUI desktop platforms are supported by it. Ease-of-use features are what make SmartSuite a unique product.” “Lotus has been aggressively pushing its products to a wide range of customers. I don’t think this is true of Microsoft. The com¬ pany has failed to see the benefits of establishing a long term rela¬ tionship with its customers — in terms of concessional prices to large users and service support. Even MS Office — the Profesional version is highly priced,” com¬ mented R.R. Singh. Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 News 21 Lotus tries to put Organizer in order Lotus Development Corp. re¬ cently announced Organizer 2.1, a maintenance upgrade designed to correct the problems in Version 2.0. Organizer is a personal infor¬ mation manager that lets users maintain and, in a network envi¬ ronment, share calendaring and scheduling information. ‘Absolutely faster’ The most widespread complaint about Organizer 2.0 had been its speed and Lotus has fixed that problem. Version 2.0’s slowness is at¬ tributable to its file format, which is different from the earlier — and faster — Version 1 .0. A 250 K-byte file in Version 1 .x would grow to more than 1 M byte in Version 2.0, for example. Although Version 2.1 keeps the same file format, its speed has improved, but not to that of ver¬ sion 1.x. Version 2.1 is also more sta¬ ble. Version 2.0 crashed fairly of¬ ten, some users remarked. Other 2.1 enhancements in¬ clude the following: • Users can now print weekly and daily pages from the cal¬ endar as well as the Notepad’s table of contents. • File compression. • Better administration. For ex¬ ample, Version 2.1 offers a utility menu that lets admin¬ istrators reset or change user access. “Lotus has always tried for excellence in all its products. Or¬ ganizer 2.1 is another such effort to provide users with the best that technology can offer. Lotus feels that the strength of Organiser for personal productivity enhance¬ ment is immense. Further we feel that with the increasing usage of computers for personal productiv¬ ity, products such as Organizer will give Lotus a unique position¬ ing in the suite range. Once again the enhanced product is being of¬ fered in the market along with our suite range and individually at the same price which it was offered in the earlier version,” said Rahul Nanda of Lotus India. The new version of Organizer began shipping in September. Oracle support bonanza cheers users t Oracle Software (India) Private Ltd., the India operation of Ora¬ cle, the information management software company, has announced plans to expand the technical and support services from its National Support Center. In the first stage the three major Oracle offices in India, located at Delhi, Bangalore, and Bombay, will be connected by a 64 Kbps telecommunications link. This facility will establish di¬ rect access from the regional of¬ fices to Oracle’s National Technical Repository at Bangalore, as well as to the four worldwide Ora¬ cle Super Support Centers. Sources close to Oracle say the Red¬ wood Shores, Califor¬ nia-based company may down the line set up the Bangalore sup¬ port center as an interna¬ tional support resource for Oracle clients worldwide. The Oracle software AMC, said Dipankar Sanyal, general manager for marketing at Oracle Software (India), is aimed at tak¬ ing care of future needs of cus¬ tomers. Some of the support deliverables under the AMC are electronic remote support, free upgrades and updates of software, technical bulletins, patches and fixes, and value-added services such as manuals on CD-ROM. Customers have the option of tak¬ ing support from Oracle or from its business partners who offer the first level of support on their own. Oracle AMCs typically cost be¬ tween 17 percent to 30 percent of the cost of the software license, depending on the complexity of the software and the platform. KVR Somayaji, general man¬ ager for customer services at Ora¬ cle Software (India) said that “the high rate of problem resolution at the first instance within four work¬ ing hours is enabling our custom¬ ers to maintain high availability of Oracle database in business critical applications.” About 40 to 50 percent of Oracle clients have signed up for the AMC di¬ rectly with Oracle. Software (In¬ dia). Globally, technical support services revenues account for about 20 percent of Oracle Corp.’s revenues. In India, technical sup¬ port revenues are about 42 per¬ cent of the company’s net to Ora¬ cle revenues of Rs. 33.7 crores in the fiscal year ended March 31 this year. US based principal, Ora¬ cle Corporation posted revenues of US $ 3.0 billion in the last fis¬ cal year. NASSCOM Executive Direc¬ tor, Dewang Mehta said the fo¬ cus by Oracle on high quality sup¬ port was welcome. If more soft¬ ware companies beef up their sup¬ port in India, more users may now go for legal software if only to be entitled for support.

Even so the splintering is expected to have a positive fallout for the telecom giant. It seems only yesterday that the AT&T Globalyst range of multi- media systems was launched in India with great fanfare. However, the excitement of having AT&T join the desktop fray seems to have been extremely short-lived on account of the company pull¬ ing out of the global PC market, following a massive restructuring exercise. Public relations have called it a “bold strategic move.” AT&T Chairman Bob Allen has dubbed it “AT&T, Formerly AT&T,” and “Divestiture II.” No matter the label, AT&T is making a major change by di¬ viding itself into three independent companies reflecting telecommunications services, tel¬ ecommunications equipment and computers. These businesses go under the current names of Com¬ munications Services, Communi¬ cations Systems and GIS. Com¬ munications Services will retain the AT&T brand, the others must launch their own brands. The AT&T services company will be made up of Communications Services, AT&T Wireless Services, AT&T Solu¬ tions and AT&T Universal Card Services — with revenues of US $49 billion. The systems and tech¬ nology company will be comprised of Network Systems, Microelectronics, Global Busi¬ ness Communications Systems, Consumer Products, and the other businesses in the Multi-Me¬ dia Products Group — with rev¬ enues of US$20 billion. Reiterating that AT&T’s size and scope have become a burden limiting the growth of the business units, Allen stated that the sepa¬ rated companies will be worth more to shareholders and will be more accurately measured against their industry peer group. Following the move, AT&T is expected to lose approximately 8,500 employees, including some positions from the unit’s Dayton headquarters and some held by contract employees. Most posi¬ tions will be eliminated by the end of 1995. AT&T Global Information Solutions (GIS), as the unit is known, currently employs 42,800 people in 1 20 countries. AT&T GIS will continue to of¬ fer customers personal computers as part of total solutions, but will no longer develop and manufac¬ ture its Globalyst line of personal computers, nor sell them through value-added resellers and retail outlets. AT&T’s computer unit expects to announce a relation¬ ship with a new PC supplier soon. As announced, AT&T GIS will build on its strengths in three key industries — financial, retail and communications. In addition, AT&T GIS will also focus on en¬ terprise computers, worldwide services and Systemedia, which manufactures and markets paper receipt rolls, business forms, ink ribbons labels, etc. As far as the Indian market is concerned, AT&T’s announce¬ ment will affect its recently ap¬ pointed resellers including Bom- bay-based CMS computers which has been pushing the AT&T Globalyst range through its Chain Reaction retail outlets. S.K. Puri, vice president, CMS Computers Ltd., said: “AT&T has pulled out of the PC business because the company felt it really wasn’t its cup of tea. Be¬ ing a telecom company it has per¬ haps not been able to handle the cut-throat business in the PC mar¬ ket.” “CMS users need not worry at all on account of AT&T discon¬ tinuing the manufacturing and marketing of its PC range. CMS is a maintenance company and has been in the business for the last 1 9 years. We are very comfortable with the maintenance of interna¬ tional brands like IBM and Dig¬ ital and will successfully take care of the current Globalyst custom¬ ers in India. While this is a pain¬ ful development, we are ready to handle the situation,” Puri reas¬ sured. CMS claims to have sold a substantial number of AT&T’s Globalyst PC in the past few months to customers such as Swiss Airways, Ballarpur Indus¬ tries and Richa and Co. among others. Shanti Nag, General Man¬ ager, Computer Services, Ballarpur Industries Limited, which recently acquired Globalyst systems said: “This is a dynamic industry, and AT&T’s recent move truly proves it. Even before the company could prove its credentials in the PC segment it chose to move out. The image of AT&T has certainly gone down in the eyes of the cus¬ tomers. As a user of machines that have been withdrawn from the market, we are not very worried, as we expect CMS to be support¬ ing our systems in the future. At the same time we hope that the availability of spare parts does not become a problem for us.” Another Indian user, Swiss Airways, might well be facing a rough landing with its Globalyst plans. “A corporate decision” led to the airline office acquir¬ ing 24 Globalyst machines, “which are yet to be installed.” AT&T’s Globalyst: the disappearing act...

The major pressures include shrinking time to market, the need for product companies to run on very thin margins, the push toward fewer computing platforms, which means only the strong or highly specialized niche players survive, and you need to have it all work together right now,” com¬ mented an industry analyst. ^ Big Breakup AT&T (Communication services) As-yet unnamed (Network systems) Global Information Solutions (Computer systems) Revenue &49B $20B 8B CEO Robert Allen Richard McGinn Lars Nyberg Employees 121,000 137,000 43,000 • AT&T Universal • Global Business • Formerly NCR Card Services Communications Corp. • AT&T Solutions • Consumer products • AT&T’s current • AT&T Wireless • AT&T Paradyne computer unit • AT&T Laboratories • Microelectronics Confusion dogs Windows 95 pricing “Did I get the price right?” seems to be the gen¬ eral refrain of buyers reaching for Windows 95 off Indian distributors/resellers shelves. In what appear to be statistical snafus Windows 95 price tags have gone through some strange metamor¬ phoses. Look at this What started out at Rs. 6,770 — at the Windows 95 launch in Bombay in August — has gradually crept up to the Rs. 7, 100 mark. The Upgrade Pack, which initially carried a price tag of Rs. 4,300 is now available with distributors for Rs. 5,100. Customers that had booked the “attractively priced” Windows 95 package, following Microsoft’s launch in Bombay, were disappointed to learn that they needed to shell out extra moolah to actually land the package. In New Delhi, inspite of the extra hype, users actually cancelled orders following the price confusion. “The confusion was caused on account of the fact that Microsoft announced different prices of Windows 95 in Bombay and New Delhi. Further¬ more, the price of the dollar has gone up by 12 percent, leading to a hike in the shipment price of Windows 95 to the customer in India,” com¬ mented the rep of a key Microsoft distributor.

The company is currently op¬ erating in India directly as well as through a host of distributors and in fact managed to install around 6, 1 25 systems during last year for a revenue of Rs. 1 8 crores. Meanwhile, based on Intel Corp.’s Pentium chip, AST’s Bravo MS series will offer voice recognition and command naviga¬ tion, text-to-speech software that allows the computer to respond through speech, integrated virus protection software, integrated 16- bit audio and aggressive pricing. similar capability in its PowerPC desktops later this year. Observers perceive the latest Bravos as an attempt by AST to reposition itself as a desktop tech¬ nology leader. A series of seri¬ ously delayed product announce¬ ments forced the company to play catch-up with the rest of the in¬ dustry most of last year. The announcement comes at a time when AST has been des¬ perately fighting to run around a deeply troubled business with a series of initiatives, including lay¬ offs, the shutdown of a manufac¬ turing facility and senior manage¬ ment reorganizations. According to AST sources, the company’s ride along the technol¬ ogy curve will now feature more rapid product transitions and far shorter product life cycles.

Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 27 DEC refines software pitch Slammed by critics during the past year for its lack of a clear software strategy, Digital Equipment Corp. rolled out a business unit aimed specifically at client/server and internetworking applications. The Connectivity Software Business Unit will focus on meet¬ ing the user demand created by growth in the Internet and inter¬ est in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows NT for three-tiered client/server environments, said Robert Palmer, Digital’s chief executive officer. New software products will work with, but not depend on Dig¬ ital hardware. Digital will be looking at sell¬ ing software as a product to earn a profit and not to support its plat¬ form sales specifically. The announcement of a new division should signal to users that Digital executives have finally solidified their vision for the fu¬ ture. It is expected that the firm would continue to. support VMS- oriented products but could sell off some software lines to third par¬ ties as it has done in the past. Indian users of Digital prod¬ ucts did not seem unduly worried about the company abandoning VMS applications. It is expected that as the company develops new applications and technology, it will allow its customer to other operating systems such as NT. The creation of the new busi¬ ness unit will put more focus on the kinds of software products that Digital believes are important. The computer system division will also continue to support other software products, such as those developed for its proprietary Open VMS.

Information Systems Computerworld, November 1-15,1995 News Computer Industry 28 Computer Industry Compaq, Wipro top CW survey Fire Brands: ... Continued from page 1 It’s no wonder then that leading broad-based solu¬ tions providers in the country are paying so much attention to embel¬ lishing their micro show-windows. It’s usually a packed house, with indigenous micro brands rub¬ bing shoulders with luscious in¬ ternational offerings. The micro story is all about power play and punchy pricing. In a special survey, Computerworld looks at the lead¬ ing micro brands of 1994-95. These winsome wonders have made to the top of the charts on the strength of sheer grit, gump¬ tion, and great specs! The survey covers 162067 micros which were sold during the year. The Computerworld evalu¬ ation reveals that multinational of¬ ferings and the home spun indig¬ enous line are moving virtually neck-n-neck. While the national brands seem to have a slight edge at a 5 1 .42 percent marketshare, MNC brands are a hair’s breadth away at 48.58 percent. Super Genius At Work Even as the MNC brands are making an indelible impact, ironically, it is the national brands that have taken the lead in the consolidated micro chart. In fact, the premier three po¬ sitions in this chart belong to the “desi” brand names. It’s essen¬ tially a world of the Super Gen¬ ius, Busybee XL and PCL micros. Wipro Limited, a company which has hung on tenaciously to the “indigenous” label, blazed its way into the overall listing with its meteoric micro — the Super Genius. Until now, the Super Genius has been the fulcrum of Wipro’s PC strategy and business. In the Super Genius range, with some innovative features like field upgradability of the CPU, Wipro clearly has a good product. However there is likely to be a changeover in Wipro’s micro products profile in the year ahead, with the company tying the knot with Acer of Taiwan to manufac¬ ture the latter’s premium brand micros in India. For 1994-95, however Super Genius is the Number One brand, at a 15.34 percent market share followed by HCL’ s BusybeeXL, the other veteran in the micro mart. HCL’s Busybee: Feel The Sting The Busybee, as a brand name, is virtually a part of the New Delhi- based IT giant’s woodwork. The product which made an appear¬ ance much before HCL was rechristened HCL-HP, has gone through a series of technical upgradations and “features enrich¬ ment” programs, based on exten¬ sive R&D by the company. The Busybee XL bagged a market share of 12.84 percent during 1994-95. According to Rajiv Kaul, branch manager, ITC Information Systems Division, Busybee — targeted at the lower end of the micro spectrum — has made head way on account of its competitive pricing, high performance and brand image. “The service and support of HCL too has been good. If we rate support on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be pegged at 7,” Kaul said. Close on the heels of the Busybee is the PCL micro range, which came in at third place in the overall micro chart. PCL’s offerings, including the Orbit range of PC-compatibles have in fact been responsible for launching and sustaining Pertech Computers Limited in the IT industry. The runaway success of these machines rocketed PCL into the micro charts within almost two years of existence of the company. While Dell is the new blue¬ eyed kid on the PCL block, it was really the indigenously manu¬ factured line that set the company going on a path of fame and for¬ tune. Which is not to say that Dell hasn’t performed well. In fact, Dell systems cornered around 1 1 .09 percent of the micro mar¬ ket in terms of shipments. With Dell making an appearance at the fifth slot on the Premier Brands evaluation chart, PCL has the OVERALL BRANDS RANK BRAND NAME S.O.M. 1. SUPER GENIUS 15.34% 2. BUSYBEEXL 12.84% 3. PCL 12.02% 4. COMPAQ 11.28% 5. DELL 11.09% TOTAL 62.57% Out of the total brands, multinational brands have 48.58% of share in the market whereas national brands have 51.42% of share in the market in India. Table - 1 unique distinction of being the only IT vendor with both desi and imported products occupying best-seller slots. If one were to combine the strengths of PCL and the Dell brand, Pertech Comput¬ ers Limited (with a combined market share of 23.11 percent) becomes the unchallenged Number One PC-compatibles vendor in terms of units shipped. “Between PCL and Dell we have the largest mindshare and marketshare in the country. Dur¬ ing the last two years, we have totally re-engineered our com¬ pany, making it customer-centric,” said Sameer Kochhar, product manager, PCL. “PCL’s change in focus from merely selling boxes three years back to emerging as the largest PC-networking company and a leading enterprise-wide solutions provider has been in sync with the way the market is shaping up. And this has certainly yielded results,” Kochhar added. The fourth slot, meanwhile belongs to Compaq, the other MNC vendor to hit the “hot sell¬ ing micros” listing. Compaq — through its partners Unicorp., Microland and Tangerine — has managed to swamp all comers of the Indian market.

OLIVETTI 9.53% TOTAL 85.38% Table - 2 The Multinational Bonanza Compaq, Fourth on the overall best-selling micro charts, is clearly the Number One MNC brand in terms of units shipped. In the mul¬ tinational brands listing, Compaq heads the pack with a marketshare of 23.22 percent. Distributors Unicorp and Microland have been the significant pillars of the U.S.- based giant’s micro strategy. Both vendors have pushed Compaq on the strength of very aggressive pricing and product ca¬ pability. In fact, relying on extensive advertising, Unicorp. in particu¬ lar, has been able to build up a sig¬ nificant brand image for Compaq in the Northern region. The com¬ pany has a high visibility, in fact, more than any of the other MNC brands in the country. The next in line to Compaq is Dell with a marketshare of 22.82 percent of units shipped. Dell sup¬ port in fact has proved to be the big winner for PCL. Stated to be a function of product design and the complimentary support infra¬ structure, Dell support has been a major USP. According to the company, the success of Dell lies in the fact that the systems offer comprehensive bootless or floppy-based diagnos¬ tics which can zero down on to problems almost instantly. Fur¬ thermore, PCL’s tele-support cen¬ tres for Dell products work on a soft¬ ware called SPHINX, which has a database of all the problems faced on Dell systems worldwide and the solutions thereof. “With Dell tele¬ support, we are able to solve prob¬ lems over the telephone itself,” said Kochhar. Dell is followed by HCL-HP’s Vectra on the Best Selling MNC brands chart. While the Busybee is the staple offering at the lower and mid-rung on the micro spectrum, the higher end micros in¬ cluding 486/Pentium servers, etc. are the Vectras. The HP Vectra has also been positioned as a server in PC-based local area networks being imple¬ mented by the com¬ pany. Meanwhile Number 4 on the list is the IBM PC-com¬ patible, being cur¬ rently manufactured, marketed and support by Tata-IBM and the company’s distribu¬ tors across the country. TISL spent 1994- 95 in putting together a strategy for its PC business, which earlier used to piggyback on the company’s large systems sales. Apart from the di¬ rect sales, TISL also concentrated on its distribution channel which by the fourth quarter of 1994-95, was accounting for 48 percent of sales. The four tier channel, con¬ sists of distributors Zenith and Melstar selling to corporate clients in non-metro and semi-metro mar¬ kets, 23 value chain dealers sell¬ ing into small corporate and semi¬ corporate accounts in the metro markets, the company’s own ver¬ tical industry teams which sell the PCs into large TISL accounts, and three recently appointed regional distributors. Ranking among the bestseller micros is also Modi-Olivetti with PC-compatibles from the Italian giant. Olivetti’s micro range is ex¬ pected to get a major boost in the market, thanks to a major aware¬ ness and visibility drive being planned by the company for the year ahead. Modi-Olivetti is ex¬ pecting to undertake a significant brand building exercise to touch both the individual and corporate user community. The “Desi” display Finally on to the national brands. The winners in the pack include the SuperGenius at Number One, the BusyBeeXL at Number Two, and PCL, DCM and Unicorp at the third, fourth and fifth positions respectively. DCM, which is currently selling its indigenously pro¬ duced offerings, is expected to make waves in the coming year with a tie-up with U.S. -based Gateway 2000 for the latter’s micro range. The Gateway tie-up ought to position DCM among the big league micro sellers offering premium products. In Gateway, DCM is expected to have the MNC label, which it had desperately lacked all these years. Number Five on the bestseller national brands listing is Unicorp. which has really earned its spurs with the Compaq line. Like PCL, how¬ ever, Unicorp too established its credentials in the market with its indigenous micro range. These products not only launched Unicorp successfully in the Indian micro market, they also helped the New Delhi company make a foray into the global markets, particularly the Russian and Eastern Bloc countries.

KAMERAD-NEWS/BPL-800-95R Computer Industry 32 Computer Industry Hopelessly devoted to you... What makes users stick fiercely to one particular brand? Stay loyal to it through thick and thin — and keep going back. Again and again. Brand loyalties die hard among PC users. Despite Wipro’s plans to phase out its in-house designed Super Genius range in favour of joint branded Acer products, users still rate the Super Genius the most popular local brand in the Indian PC market. When it comes to the foreign brands that have launched advertising and promotion blitzkrieg in the Indian market, end user opinion clearly rates Compaq by far the brand leader. But the winning brands would be making a mistake if they take their current market standing as an excuse for complacency. “Very clearly Super Genius was suc¬ cessful because of the strong and solid im¬ age that Wipro enjoys vis-a-vis custom¬ ers, namely one of being trustworthy, offering products of exceedingly high value, and offering the best after-sale support,” said A.V. Sridhar, chief market¬ ing officer, and president of the In¬ tegrated Solutions Division at Wipro Infotech. N. Kailasanathan, deputy general manager — EDP & Systems at Asea Brown Boveri Limited added that until last year, his company was buying a number of Su¬ per Genius machines. “We found them to be comparable with international brands in terms of reliability, and they were also cheaper. We felt that it was value for money. Wipro also had a better reach as compared to some of the foreign brands.” Like Wipro, Compaq also made value for money its sales pitch. “The key factor behind Compaq’s popularity is the win¬ ning range of products. Compaq is easy to choose, buy, use and
