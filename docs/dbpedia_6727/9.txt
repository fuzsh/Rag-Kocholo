Texas K-12 Esports Teams Explode In Popularity (kxan.com)

ItsJustAPseudonym writes: "The number of Texas school districts with esports programs has exploded this school year, growing from about 20 to more than 300 in the span of a few months," reports KXAN-TV, citing the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA). "'It's been in colleges for the last few years, and now it's starting to move down into the high schools and in the middle schools,' said TCEA's executive director, Lori Gracey. 'Teamwork, cooperation, planning, problem-solving, thinking quickly,' Gracey explained, 'all of those are things we want our kids to be able to do. And you can do that through video games.'"

And, for the collegiate perspective on this: "High school is a really, really exciting place for esports to take root," said Austin Espinoza, president of Longhorn Gaming at the University of Texas at Austin. "Eventually, that's just going to trickle upwards into the college world." Yes, yes, it's VERY exciting. I'm sure the effect on grades will be *nothing* but positive, right? On the other hand, esports provides an opportunity for college students to earn some money to pay down their college debts, so that's a potential upside. Will colleges start recruiting and offering scholarships to esports competitors?
