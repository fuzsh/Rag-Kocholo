        "text": "Golden Avalanche (Unofficial)\n\nGold (Never Adopted)\n\nFrom 1954 to 1994 Marquette athletics nickname was officially the Warriors for all sports. Prior to that period, athletic teams were known as the Blue & Gold unofficially, then the Hilltoppers officially, but then eventually the Golden Avalanche was used for the Men's Football team only.\n\nIn 1993-1994 Father DiUlio, who was the president of the university at the time, outraged students and alums by deciding to change the team's athletic nickname. Inexplicably, the only choices given to stakeholders were “Lightning” and “Golden Eagles,” neither of which had any historical or logical connection to Marquette.\n\nSince that time, the name change has always bubbled near the surface of the emotions of a large number of Marquette alumni. In fact, at commencement in 2004, the issue gained renewed media attention when Wayne Sanders, who was the vice chair of Marquette's board of trustees, offered $2 million – $1 MM from himself and another $1 MM from an anonymous trustee – if Marquette would change it's nickname back to Warriors before joining the Big East Conference. The monetary gift was immediately declined, but Father Wild, the new president of the university, determined that the proposal would be considered.\n\nThe debate went on for a year from May 2004 to May 2005, during which time the board of trustees passed a resolution stating that “Marquette will prohibit the use of Native American references, symbolism or imagery in its athletics logo, nickname, or mascot ”. The university conducted a poll in which 92 percent of alumni respondents said they identified with the name “Warriors.” In the same poll, 62 percent of students also identified with “Warriors. The same survey listed the most common words used to describe “Golden Eagles” as boring (57%), weak (55%) and common (52%)."
