        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY – With the NHL officially announcing a new franchise in Utah for the upcoming season, fans were left with a lot of questions surrounding the team.\n\nThere are a lot of things that still have to be worked out. But, there are many questions we have answers to as well.\n\nWhat Will The Utah NHL Franchise Be Called?\n\nAlthough there is a lot of solid information out there for this question, no one really knows the answer. Not even the new ownership.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation on what the Utah NHL team would be called and Ryan Smith, owner of the franchise, fed into these talks on multiple occasions.\n\nSix trademarks for the new Utah NHL franchise were sent to the US Patent and Trademark Office this week.\n\nUtah Yetis was submitted for trademark a day after Utah Blizzard, Utah Venom, Utah Fury, Utah HC, and Utah Hockey Club.\n\nIt’s important to note that these trademarks were filed anonymously and are not finalized. The team name could be none of these six options.\n\nThey want to get the name right on the first try, even if that means going into year one without a name. This checks out with the Utah Hockey Club and Utah HC trademark applications.\n\nWhere Will The Utah NHL Team Play?\n\nThe new Utah NHL team will share the Delta Center with the NBA’s Utah Jazz for the next two seasons at least.\n\nDelta Center can support 12,000 people for NHL games and over 17,000 for NBA games.\n\nAlthough there is no official announcement on this topic, it is believed that Delta Center will undergo renovations over the next two years to increase that number to 17,000 for NHL games.\n\nSome have speculated that a new arena could be built in Utah for the NHL team. But, Smith confirmed that Delta Center will be a dual-sport arena.\n\nWho Is New NHL Team Owner Ryan Smith?\n\nSmith is an American businessman. Born in Eugene, Oregon, Smith attended Brigham Young University and lives in Provo, Utah, to this day.\n\nWhile attending BYU’s School of Business, Smith founded Qualtrics with his father Scott and brother Jared. Qualtrics is an experience management company that offers a subscription software platform.\n\nIn 2020, Smith bought a majority stake in the Utah Jazz from Gail Miller. Two years later, Smith and David Blitzer bought the Utah MLS team Real Salt Lake. Last year, Smith and Blitzer brought back the NWSL-side with Utah Royals FC.\n\nSmith is a hands-on owner and has clear intentions to compete for a title in the NBA, MLS, NWSL and now NHL. Smith has shown these intentions on multiple occasions. First, with the trades of NBA stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert in 2022. Then, with multiple high-profile MLS signings in 2023 like Chicho Arango.\n\nSmith has been adamant about the fact that Utah is ready for an NHL franchise and there is faith that he will do what is necessary to carry the team in the right direction.\n\nWhen Will The First NHL Game Be Played In Utah?\n\nThe NHL is drafting a schedule for the upcoming season (2024/25) that has the new franchise playing in Utah.\n\nRELATED: Coyotes Play In Utah On Version Of 2024-25 NHL Schedule Draft\n\nThere will be no grace period so when the 2024-2025 season begins in October, NHL games will be played in Salt Lake City!\n\nHow To Get Tickets, Watch New Utah NHL Team?\n\nShortly after the official announcement came down on Thursday, Delta Center shared that fans interested in season tickets could immediately place a $100 deposit (per seat) for the tickets.\n\nTicketmaster is the Official Ticket Marketplace of the NHL. Fans looking to attend games when the season rolls around can check there or on Delta Center’s website.\n\nFor fans looking to catch the action from home, there are a handful of options.\n\nNationally broadcast games are typically found on ESPN, ESPN+, TNT, and ABC. Regional games are shown on RSN, NHL Center Ice, and NHL Network.\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Scripps (a television company) will still have the local broadcast during a press conference in Arizona.\n\nSmith introduced Jazz+ as a method for Jazz fans to watch all games that aren’t nationally televised. There could be a similar platform introduced for Utah’s NHL games.\n\nRELATED: Utah Jazz+ Streaming Service Launches At $125.50 Per Year\n\nHow Will The New NHL Team Be Supported In Utah?\n\nSince 1979, the Jazz have been the only major-four sports league team in the state of Utah.\n\nFootball, baseball, and hockey fans in the state have been vouching for Utah sports seemingly since day one.\n\nUtah sports fans show out. Despite going through a rebuild the past two seasons, Jazz fans have sold out nearly 300-straight home games.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the NHL announcement was made, over 20,000 people put down deposits for tickets.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Utah will support its new NHL team from the very first puck drop.\n\nWhat Is The History Of Hockey In Utah?\n\nAlthough Utah has never had an NHL team, there is a pretty long history of hockey in the state.\n\nNamely, the ECHL’s Utah Grizzlies and the WHL’s Salt Lake Golden Eagles.\n\nSalt Lake Golden Eagles\n\nThe Golden Eagles’ first season was in the Salt Palace in 1969. At that time, they were in the Western Hockey League and were the farm club for the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nThey were also the only professional sports team in Utah at the time. In 1972, the team became the farm club for the California Golden Seals of the NHL.\n\nThe Golden Eagles’ impact on people’s lives went far beyond the Salt Palace. The fandom became a family tradition, leading to career and hobby choices.\n\nSeveral big names emerged from the Golden Eagles franchise – Joey Mullen, Ziggy Palfy, Derek Armstrong, Kevin Cheveldayoff, Theo Fleury, and Stu Grimson.\n\nThe Utah Jazz started playing in Utah in 1979, sharing the Salt Palace with the Golden Eagles.\n\nThe Eagles won back-to-back CHL Championships (Adams Cup) in 1979 and 1980 and back-to-back IHL championships (Turner Cup) in 1987 and 1988.\n\nLarry H. Miller sold The Golden Eagles franchise to Detroit in 1994. In their final game, they sold out the Delta Center.\n\nUtah Grizzlies\n\nThe Utah Grizzlies would play their first season in Utah in the same building the Salt Lake Golden Eagles played their last, Delta Center.\n\nAfter the Denver Grizzlies went all the way to the championship and won the Turner Cup in 1995, Colorado got an NHL team. This move resulted in the Denver Grizzlies coming to Utah.\n\nThe new Utah Grizzlies won their second championship in a row in 1996 by sweeping the Orlando Solar Bears in front of a sold-out Delta Center Crowd of 17,381 fans.\n\nThe IHL folded in 2001, and several teams were granted franchises in the AHL.\n\nThe Grizzlies were the farm club of the Dallas Stars from 2001-2004 and the Phoenix Coyotes for their final season in the AHL. In 2005, the Elmore group announced that they had purchased a then-dormant ECHL franchise, formerly the Lexington Men O’ War, and that the Grizzlies would be joining the ECHL.\n\nSince entering the East Coast league, the Utah Grizzlies have always put together an entertaining roster that is competitive and produces fan favorites and an occasional standout.\n\nThe Utah Grizzlies remain an affordable option for hockey fans to watch high-quality, professional hockey at the Maverik Center.\n\nAre you on Threads yet?
