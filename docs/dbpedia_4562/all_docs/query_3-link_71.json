Only 14 species can be found elsewhere, two in North America, nine in Central and South America and three in Australia. Gauntlet Birds of Prey is home to nine species of eagles, from the Bald Eagle of North America to the African Tawny Eagle from sub-Saharan Africa and India. Our eagles all have their own individual personalities and keep us entertained with their funny ways."
