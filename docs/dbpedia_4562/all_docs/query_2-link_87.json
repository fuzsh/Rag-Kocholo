I LEFT PECOS ON FEB. 15, 1975 AND LEFT A VERY SPECIAL PLACE AND SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE I HAVE KNOWN TO DATE. I RETURNED TO PECOS IN JULY 1995 AND FOUND MANY CHANGES. MY WIFE OF 18 YEARS AND TWO CHILDREN HAD NEVER SEEN MY HOMETOWN AND KNEW LITTLE OF THE PLACE I HAD GROWN UP IN. I GAVE THEM THE GRAND TOUR WITH THE FULL HISTORY OF EACH STOP ON THE TOUR. I HOPED TO SEE SOME OF THE OLD GANG STILL JUST AS IT USE TO BE. I HAD NO LUCK AND I RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE FACT THAT LIKE MYSELF THEY MUST HAVE MOVED ON.\n\nWE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE TOWN WHEN THE FAMILY VOTED TO EAT BEFORE WE HEADED BACK TO MY UNCLES HOME IN MIDLAND. WE STOPPED AT THE D. Q. ACROSS FROM PHS AND AS WE ATE I TOLD THE FAMILY ABOUT THE MANY PEOPLE WHO TOUCHED MY LIFE IN THIS SMALL TOWN THAT HAS COME TO MEAN SO MUCH TO ME. IN A LAST DITCH ACT OF DESPERATION TO SEE AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM MY PAST. I ASKED THE YOUNG WOMAN AT THE COUNTER IF SHE KNEW ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE: THOMAS BEECHAM, JIMMY EDWARDS, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN MEEK THE 3RD, \"SORRY BENJI,\" TOM MEUTH, JOHNNY ELLIOT, , ETC.\n\nTHEN I CAME TO TONY DOWDY AND SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS A SGT. ON PPD NAMED DOWDY. WE FINISHED OUR MEAL, I TOOK MY FAMILY TO MEET THE MVP OF THE HICKORY STREET ALL-STARS . WHEN WE GOT TO THE STATION SGT. DOWDY WAS NOT THERE. IT WAS HIS DAY OFF AND IN KEEPING WITH POLICY THEY COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE HE LIVED. SO I TOLD THE KIDS THEY WOULDN'T BE MEETING CROWBAR DOWDY THIS TIME. THEN A YOUNG OFFICER WHO HAD GROWN UP IN PECOS AND HAD AN OLDER BROTHER WHO PLAYED BALL WITH US.\n\nUPON HEARING ME CALL HIM CROWBAR TOLD THE DISPATCHER TO GIVE ME TONY'S ADDRESS. WE WENT TO TONY'S HOME AND WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR I WAS HOME AGAIN FOR THAT ALL TOO BRIEF MOMENT. THANK YOU PECOS. IT IS A POINT OF PRIDE FOR ME TO INFORM PEOPLE THAT I AM FROM PECOS, TEXAS.\n\nMARTIN M FIELDER (MARTY)\n\n(ALMOST) CLASS OF '76\n\nmmfielder@aol.com\n\nSubject: No Subject\n\nDate: Fri, 25 Feb 2000 23:34:44 EST\n\nFrom: Ndegan@aol.com\n\nHi!

Now this is a very nice and surprising site. I guess Ray Boulter has it right about marriages that last for Pecos people.\n\nPaula and I eloped (some of you will remember) then spent many many years overseas. 27 out of 32 to be exact. 20 with the US Army (Military Attache, Embassy) duties and then 12 with the US State Department overseas.\n\nCan't begin to tell you all about it here. Someday maybe. Our children keep tell us we need to write a book. Just might do that for them one of these days. For our precious grand children only of course.\n\nIt would be great to hear from any and all of you old timers from the class of '57. We didn't graduate with you but our hearts were always with you.\n\nMost of you will remember us as Eddie Roberts and Paula Morris. It will be 45 years for us this year. We are looking ahead to many more, our Lord willing.\n\nSubject: Greetings Gabbers!\n\nDate: Tue, 22 Feb 2000 22:22:17 -0600\n\nFrom: Randy Moss randy.moss.afa@worldnet.att.net\n\nJust wanted to say hello to everyone out there.

Maybe it was something in the water in Pecos. It just seems that many of those marriages are blessed and continue past the ones that seem to start and end within a year or two. But more than that each of these people continue to use the words \"still in love with\", or \"met my beautiful wife 30 or 40 years ago\".\n\nI have often said that nothing makes a woman more beautiful than a pair of cowgirl boots, jeans and a cowboy hat. Most of these unions began their courtship in school or college. Maybe we should rename Pecos High school and call it the fountain of youth for marriages because Pecos couples seem to stay together longer and be happier.\n\nHowever not only marriages but friendships that started in Pecos seem to go on and on and are more blessed each year. I am sure that the fact all of these wonderful people are from Pecos is only a coincidence and that you could find the same situation in hundreds of homes towns all over America. However it is nice to say, \"I met my wife in Pecos, Texas Or I married a perfect girl from Pecos Texas\".\n\nIt is always a great joy to read the messages that you continue to receive Joy. Again thanks for you work.\n\nRay Boulter\n\nboult@wcc.net\n\nSubject: Great Site\n\nDate: Wed, 16 Feb 2000 22:18:10 -0600\n\nFrom: Wayne Stringer ranger@abilene.com\n\nPeggy, I found the site after hearing from Joy Brown Ray. Gosh it was so great to get to hear from her and several others that I haven't seen or heard from in over 30 years. I'm looking forward to the 30 year class reunion in June. Even though I didn't graduate with the class I did go thru 1st (and some of them kindergarten) to the 10th grade. I married a boy from Mississippi that was working there in Pecos, we have been married 31 years now. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone. Thanks for the great work here on the Pecos Gab, its great.\n\nThanks,\n\nKathy Lukins Stringer\n\nSubject: Searching for old friends\n\nDate: Wed, 16 Feb 2000 18:32:17 -0800 (PST)\n\nFrom: Nativus Broke eightywest@yahoo.com\n\nDoes anyone know the whereabouts of Sue and Loui (class of 66ish), Pete Smyth, Bob Huckabee, Jesse James, Ed Painter, Barbara Tyler, Johnny Goodrich, Dave Evans, Herb Manning?

But I must admit this much: some of my happiest chapters in life were definitely in Pecos!! You know, I still remember whipping every school in football that school year except Andrews. Believe me, we were a tough flock of eagles - thanks to Coach Milsaps. At any rate, I'm writing to find out how I can get my hands on an annual of my senior year, since I lost it many years ago to vandalism. Does anyone know how? And if you do know how, please write me and let me know real soon. And, please, forgive me if I don't give out my name.

My name is Liz Sutton Dick. I have not been able to visit Pecos since I graduated in 1971, so I am REALLY out of touch with everyone. I would love to hear about any plans for a future reunion, or it would be great to hear from some of you and what you have been up to.\n\nI work for Phillips Petroleum Company as an executive secretary to a vice president. I've been married since 1972 and have 2 grown daughters. Life has been great, but it is flying by way to fast. It would be nice to get in touch with my past.

Old loyalties, you know. Finally got out of chamber of commerce work after 27 years and now and now am the asst. dir. for a community action agency here in Amarillo. Mostly I write, with 8 books done 6 still for sale and two under contract to come out this year.\n\nI ended up marrying my high school sweetheart some 30 years after we went together. Teresa has two kids and Bryan has one. I have two others via Saundra. Youngest is 3, oldest is 17.\n\nLike I say, I did chamber work for 27 years, then stayed home and wrote full time for three years. Often did things during the chamber years and even yet to help Pecos. Old habits and loyalties die hard. I've sold articles, poetry for greeting cards, and published four non-fiction books related to chamber work. Since I've started writing fiction I've written ten novels.\n\nTerry Burns\n\nEditor's note: Terry was chamber manager in the 70s when I was managing editor of the Enterprise. He brought me KFC as a bribe to write nice things about the chamber. He was also a great help in covering some events we couldn't get to.\n\nPeggy\n\nSubject: class reunion\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Jan 2000 21:44:19 -0600\n\nFrom: \"Johnny Davis\" scooter.57@gateway.net\n\nJust wanted to send a email as to if there is going to be a 25 year reunion for the class of 75 this year\n\nJohnny Davis class Of 75\n\nSubject: THIS GAP IS GREAT\n\nDate: Mon, 31 Jan 2000 20:19:13 EST\n\nFrom: LuzRdrgz@aol.com\n\nWELL, I'M WRITING AGAIN CAUSE A VERY DEAR FRIEND HAS WRITTEN TO ME.AND ALL BECAUSE OF THE PECOS GAP.

I am currently teaching in Odessa, Texas, but I am finishing up my master's degree in mid-management and hope to be a principal in the Fall. I spent two years teaching in Pecos and I got the chance to teach at my old Elementary(Pecos Elem.) and my old Jr. High. (Crockett) Despite all of the negative publicity, I think Pecos kids are great. I had the opportunity to teach these kids and I must admit that the majority were well mannered bright kids.\n\nI grew up in Pecos and have many friends there. I have a confession to make, however. I married a Monahans girl. Jessica and I have a six-year old boy named \"Bobby\" and he is attending Reagan Academic Magnet school in Odessa.

Just a quick hello to everyone at and from HOME. Yes I said home, it will always be that way. Most everyone knows what is going on with me but I'll tell a little about what some may not know.\n\nI married an older Pecos girl 11yrs ago. (Glenda Anderson...Lewis for awhile... now McLain). She had a wonderful son of 6 when we married, John Scott Lewis. John is a senior at Greenwood High School. Made All-State honorable mention this year in football and the greatest step-son a man could ask for. We have two girls, 9 and 10 years old. They are wonderful.\n\nI have been with Midland Police Department for 18+ years and will promote to Sergeant on January 31st, 2000. (First time in Patrol in 12 years). Glenda has raised the kidos until about 4 or 5 months ago. She is now gainfully employeed at the Greenwood Baptist Church.\n\nProbably by the time anyone reads this, I'll be off the web due to losing the computer due to the job change. I'll check in with Mitch periodically to see who got bored with this letter.

I have been reading the Pecos Gab and have found a lot of people that I would love to see. This is Connie Beckham Lott, a graduate of 1974. I now live in Grand Saline with my husband Frank Lott who was from the big town of Toyah.\n\nWe have two beautiful daughters Sallee', 17 and Abby, 14. Sallee' will be graduating in May and attending East Texas Baptist University majoring in marketing and playing on the girl's golf team. Abby is a freshman and loves playing varsity basketball. She does quite well for a shortie. Frank has worked for Delhi Gas Corporation for the past 25 years, now known as KOCH. I have been in education for 20 years and currently, I am the principal at the best little school in \"East Texas,\" Grand Saline Elementary. It is amazing how small our world really is, as Marilyn Neslony Smith is one of my greatest first grade teachers and lived right up the block from me when we were growing up.\n\nIf anyone lives in our area and has an early childhood degree, come by and see me. I am always looking for great, enthusiastic teachers when we have openings.\n\nMy mom and dad, Fred and Beverley Beckham live in Grand Saline too. Dad is still his humorous self and my mom works as an executive secretary at Austin Bank. Mike Beckham is my brother and lives in McKinney, Texas and Patti Beckham, my sister lives in Weatherford, Texas.\n\nIt is good to read and find out where everyone is living. Orla, well what memories we have to tell. Hello again to everyone back in Pecos and Orla and best wishes to all.\n\nConnie Beckham Lott\n\nSubject: Hello from Gilda Gutierrez Rodriguez\n\nDate: Thu, 20 Jan 2000 10:06:09 -0600 (CST)\n\nFrom: GildaGRodriguez@webtv.net (gilda rodriguez)\n\nI really enjoy reading Pecos Gab and think it's a great way to keep in touch with the home base. I am currently living in Texarkana, Tx with my family and am going to school. I would like to hear from any of my classmates of 1988 and try to set a little something up for a reunion since we didn't have our 10 year reunion. I spoke to a couple of the guys during Thanksgiving in Pecos who seemed interested in getting together so lets make an effort to do so. If anyone has e-mail addresses for Leslie Ontiveros and Elizabeth Patterson, please forward them to me. Hope to hear from you guys.\n\nGILDA\n\nSubject: Going Home!\n\nDate: Tue, 18 Jan 2000 21:21:01 EST\n\nFrom: CTaylo2050@aol.com\n\nGreetings from a very cold Pecos gal living in Jeffersonville, Indiana!

Just wanted to tell everyone that I hope you had a nice Christmas and wish you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year.\n\nMy mom and dad live in Midland and my mother-in-law still lives in Pecos. We get out that way some, but not as much as we would like.\n\nMy dad just recently had a triple bypass and I was in Midland during that time. I ran into Larry and Martha Fleming at the hospital. It was really good to see them. My dad is recovering slowly but thank the good Lord he is still with us.\n\nHope you are all doing well.\n\nGood to see that Joy is still writing in. Hi Joy!!\n\nTake care everyone and Peggy, keep Pecos Gab going. I still hear from long lost friends.
