        "text": "Crested Wood Partridge\n\nThe crested wood partridge, a predominantly ground-based bird, spends most of its time foraging on the forest floor. When faced with danger, these partridges prefer to walk quickly rather than fly. At night, they roost in bushes or low tree branches, finding safety from ground predators.\n\nListed as “Near Threatened” by the IUCN, the crested wood partridge faces significant challenges due to over-logging and habitat destruction. These threats have led to a decline in their natural habitat, putting pressure on their populations. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this species, which plays a unique role in the forest ecosystem.\n\nSouthern Tamandua\n\nThe tamandua is frequently referred to as a lesser anteater due to its difference in size relative to the giant anteater. This animal is both terrestrial and arboreal, meaning it dwells in trees and on land. The tamandua often builds its nest in hollow tree trunks during the day and is most active at night. Its eyes are small, which makes its vision poor, but what they lack in sight they make up for in hearing and smell.\n\nCalifornian Rabbit\n\nThis domesticated rabbit species is known for the dark markings found on its ears, nose, and feet.\n\nWhite-faced whistling duck\n\nBecause of their sociable nature, this bird often gathers in large flocks. Their cries are very loud and can be identified by their distinctive three-note whistling call, as their name suggests.\n\nMandarin Duck\n\nThe mandarin duck is a perching duck species that displays distinct sexual dimorphism. They can be found on several continents throughout the world.\n\nHimalayan Monal\n\nThe Himalayan monal is found in high altitudes of up to 4000 feet. It shows greater seasonal movements than other pheasants in the area, moving to much lower altitudes of 2000 feet in the wintertime.\n\nTemminck’s Tragopan\n\nTemminck’s tragopan are one of Earth’s five tragopan species. The males of this species are recognizable by their red-orange plumage and bright blue facial feathers.\n\nLady Amherst’s Pheasant\n\nThe Lady Amherst’s pheasant displays a great example of sexual dimorphism in animals. The male’s long, feathered tail makes up most of their length. They spend most of their time looking for food on the ground, but at night they sleep in trees.\n\nGolden Pheasant\n\nThe Golden Pheasant, also called the “Chinese Pheasant,” is a type of pheasant that lives in the mountainous forests of Western and Central China. It is one of the more popular species of pheasant, and is recognizable by the ruff on its face and neck which spread out during courtship.\n\nAlpaca\n\nAlpacas are the smallest of the domesticated camelid species. They have slender bodies, long necks, camel-like faces and medium-length fluffy tails. Our three alpacas at the zoo are known as huacaya alpacas as their fleece is crimped, compact, and soft. Suri alpacas have longer cylindrical locks resembling dreadlocks. Similar to sheep wool, alpaca fiber is used to make knitted and woven items, such as clothing and other textiles.\n\nSouthern Three-Banded Armadillo\n\nof Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia.The southern three-banded armadillo is an armadillo species native to South America. Their ability to curl up into a tight ball at the first sign of danger is one of the animal’s defining features. An armadillo’s shell is made of keratin, the same protein that makes up human hair and nails. Their long skinny tongues allow them to gather and eat various species of insects like ants and termites. While in captivity, they also enjoy eating fruits and veggies.\n\nMadagascar Hissing Cockroaches\n\nMadagascar hissing cockroaches are a large species of cockroach, measuring up to 3 inches long. These cockroaches are known for the hissing sound they make by exhaling air through their breathing holes, which is an unusual way for invertebrates to make sound. These wingless cockroaches are nocturnal and live in colonies. They play an important role in the ecosystem by breaking down debris on the forest floor to recycle nutrients. Like most cockroach species, they do not live in human dwellings and are not considered pests.\n\nEmperor Tamarin\n\nEmperor tamarins are small monkeys with long white sweeping whiskers that make them appear to have large mustaches. They are well known as an outgoing and boisterous species.\n\nReeves’s muntjac\n\nThere are eleven different species of muntjac and they are the oldest know deer species. Muntjacs fur ranges from reddish to brown with whitish markings. Only males have antlers, which can grow up to 4 inches and are shed annually. Females only have small bony pedicels, which are covered with tufts of hair. Males and females have canine teeth in their upper jaw and males have elongated tusks, which can be used against possible predators along with their loud barking calls.\n\nBrazilian Teal\n\nLowland paca\n\nLowland Pacas (also known as the spotted paca) are related to guinea pigs, capybaras, and agoutis. Their coat is reddish-brown to darker brown and covered in rows of white spots down each side. Pacas are tailless animals with short legs and feet and a large head. They are nocturnal so they forage at night, following established paths to feed on foliage, roots, nuts, seeds, and fruits. During the day, they remain in their 6 foot burrows built in banks, slopes, or among tree roots or rocks and located beside streams and ponds. When danger approaches, they use their excellent swimming abilities to escape predators, remaining underwater for several minutes. Predators include foxes, ocelots, maned wolves, cougars and jaguars.\n\nRed-footed Tortoise\n\nRed-footed tortoises get their name from their red, orange or yellow scales which are visible on their legs, head, and tail. Their shell colour can range from dark brown to black.\n\nThe biggest threat to Red-footed tortoises is being over hunted by humans. In much of their range, they and their eggs are considered a delicacy. They are also threatened by habitat loss.\n\nPlush-crested Jay\n\nThe Plushed-crested Jay is a South American species and part of the Corvidae family, which includes crows and ravens. These jays are found in various types of forest, where they forage at each level of the canopy. They are found from lowlands up to 1500m and are often found in groups between 10-12 individuals.\n\nScarlet Ibis\n\nScarlet ibises were named after their distinctive bright red plumage, which often has orange and pink hues. Males are larger than females and have a longer curved bill. Their large beak and long, thin partially webbed toes allow them to locate crayfish, crabs, frogs, fish and insects in water. As with flamingos, the brilliant red color of the bird comes from pigments in the bodies of crustaceans on which it preys on.\n\nScarlet ibises live, feed and nest in large groups that can include thousands of individual birds, which helps protect the flock against predators. Both parents participate in nest building as well as caring for the young. Baby ibis are born featherless and then slowly turn from grey to red as they age.\n\nSpotted Turtle\n\nSpotted turtles are named after their yellow spots on their black heads, shells, legs and tails. No two spotted turtles ever have the same pattern of spots. Spotted turtles have a carapace (top shell) length ranging from 3.5 to 5.4 inches. Male turtles have dark pigment on the hard portions of both jaws; females have yellowish coloration on their jaws. The sex of the hatchlings is determined by incubation temperatures. Cooler temperatures produce mostly males, while warmer temperatures produce females. Spotted turtles are diurnal, only active during daylight hours and spend the night under water relaxing on the pond bottom.\n\nLoss of habitat has been largely responsible for the major decline of the spotted turtle. They are very sensitive to pollution and toxins and disappearing rapidly with declining water quality.\n\nTwo-Toed Sloth\n\nTwo-toed sloths move so deliberately and slowly, they are considered one of the slowest animals on the planet. They range in length from 21 – 29 inches, giving them the size of a small dog. They have four long limbs of equal length, that each end in two curved claws; they use these to hang from trees, usually upside down, for most of their days.\n\nSloths sleep up to 15 hours a day, and are most active at night, which makes them nocturnal. Their metabolism is very slow as well, and they generally only need to defecate once a week!\n\nTwo-toed sloths have tiny molars that continuously grow, like a human’s hair or finger nails, but their growth is kept under control by the constant grinding and chewing of food.\n\nDesert Tortoise\n\nPatagonian mara\n\nPatagonian maras, also known as the Patagonian cavy, Patagonian hare, or dillaby, are large rodents that have physical characteristics similar to rabbits. They are known to bounce on all of their four legs, making a movement called ‘stotting’. Historically, maras have ranged from Argentina to the southernmost tip of South Africa, Tierra del Fuego. Unfortunately, maras have been greatly affected by hunting and habitat alteration. Argentinian agriculture continues to convert grasslands into pastures. Additionally, sheep farming has resulted in competition for resources among the two herbivorous species. In Buenos Aires Province, these threats have resulted in the local extinction of this species. As of 2008, Patagonian maras are listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They exist in at least 12 protected areas within their native range.\n\nNene\n\nAlso known as Hawaiian Geese, nene are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and are the world’s rarest goose. The Nene faced extinction in the 1960’s after invasive species were introduced to their habitat and were classified as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1967. With only 30 individuals recorded in 1960, aviculturists initiated a captive breeding program that allowed for the successful reintroduction of the Nene back to the Hawaiian islands. The initial captive breeding efforts were led by Dillon Ripley (1913-2001), founder of the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy. The first successful breeding of the Nene occurred at the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy in the 1960’s with additional aviculture facilities following suit in breeding Nene for reintroduction. Following the successful captive breeding and reintroduction program along with numerous other conservation efforts, the Nene were recently re-classified as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act as their wild population now reaches almost 3000 individuals.\n\nElmwood Park Zoo received our pair of Nene from the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy (now called the Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy) based on a recommendation from the Nene Species Survival Plan Coordinator.\n\nArgentine Black and White Tegu\n\nThe Argentine black and white tegu is the largest of all tegu species and native to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. These fast moving lizards are mainly ground dwellers and are active during the day. Tegus mainly occupy grassland or woodlands but can be found around forest clearings, fences, and roadsides. They winter in burrows or under cover in a hibernation-like state called brumation.\n\nBlack Bellied Whistling Duck\n\nBlack bellied whistling ducks are also known as the white-faced tree duck and the black-bellied tree duck. There are eight different species of whistling duck, named for their high-pitched whistling contact call. Unlike other ducks, black-bellied whistling duck spend a lot of time on the ground and in trees. Although they naturally nest in tree cavities, these ducks have been known to lay their eggs in barns or chimneys. Major threats for their survival are hunting, draining of wetlands, and pesticides polluting the water.\n\nPancake Tortoise\n\nThe pancake tortoise gets its name from its thin, flat, and flexible shell. The pancake tortoise is thought to be the fastest tortoise and the best climber, due to the lightness of its shell. When in danger, the tortoise uses its speed and flexibility to get away from danger by scurrying away and hiding in crevices. The pancake tortoise spends much of its time sheltered among the rocks. Pancake tortoises are very social and get along well in a group, as long as there is enough food for all. As many as ten tortoises have been found sharing the same crevice between rocks. The wild population of pancake tortoises is declining due to collection for the pet trade.\n\nReggie\n\nReggie came to us from the Raptor Education Group, Inc. (REGI – hence his name) in Wisconsin. He was brought into the rehab when he was an immature male in August of 2011. He was found in good physical condition other than he was injured due to a collision with a truck. He sustained a closed humeral fracture and a crushed metacarpal. Injures to the metacarpals resulted in amputation of the wing tip. The humeral fracture healed well, however movement of the left wing is limited making him non-releasable to the wild. Reggie was transferred to the Elmwood Park Zoo in 2011 where he initially joined the eagle flock in Eagle Canyon. The keepers noticed that because of his very docile and nice-guy demeanor he was often overshadowed by other dominate eagles. We felt he might be a great addition to the Eagle Ambassador team so we transferred him to our team in September of 2018.\n\nBirthdate: 2011\n\nWeight: 6 lbs\n\nWingspan: 5.5 feet\n\nBald Eagles – A Conservation Success Story\n\nIn 1980, the total population of bald eagles in Pennsylvania numbered only three pairs. In 2013, there were at least 271 active nesting pairs. Pesticides such as DDT often collect in fish and nearly eliminated the bald eagle population in the 1960’s. These chemicals weaken eggshells, limiting their ability to reproduce. DDT was banned in 1972, and since that time, eagle numbers have rebounded significantly. In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald eagle from the endangered species list. However, they are still protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n\nReggie is in possession of the Elmwood Park Zoo by the authority of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAZA Raptor Taxon Advisory Group\n\nThe AZA Raptor Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) works with the Elmwood Park Zoo in support and management of captive birds of prey. It is through this partnership that this eagle represents one of thousands of raptors that are housed at zoological institutions nationally. The TAG focuses its efforts on conservation of raptors both here in the United States as well as globally. The TAG is supportive of the use of this eagle as a means to further raise awareness as to the majesty of eagles and the need to continue to conserve them and all raptors. We are proud to work with the TAG, and share their support of eagle conservation and public awareness.\n\nPygora Goat\n\nPygoras are a breed of goat that have been crossbred with Pygmy goats and white Angora goats. They were first crossbred in Oregon City, Oregon in the 1980’s. They are fiber goats, meaning they are bred for their wool. Pygora fiber is often used for knitting, crocheting, weaving, and tapestries. It is also commonly used in clothing textiles. One Pygora goat will produce roughly 6 ounces to 2 pounds of fiber per shearing. Pygora goats have inherited the playfulness of the Pygmy goat, and the docile nature of the Angora goat. This makes them wonderful with kids.\n\nVelveteen Lop Rabbit\n\nUnlike popular belief, rabbits are not from the rodent family, but are from the Leporidae family. The difference between these two is that rabbits have four incisors (teeth) instead of two and they are completely herbivorous while many rodents also eat meat.\n\nVelveteen Lops are known to be an affectionate breed and have mild temperaments. These rabbits are fairly social and calm; although, they can also be very playful at times. Velveteen Lops are a mix of the Mini Rex and English Lop breeds.\n\nThree-Toed Box Turtle\n\nThe three-toed turtle differs from other box turtles because they have three toes on their hind feet. Other box turtles have four toes on their back feet. Their feet are not webbed for swimming, but are equipped with claws. They are mainly land dwellers and are most likely to be seen in the morning hours or right after rainfall. The box turtle has a unique hinged shell that allows it to enclose its body inside its shell to avoid predators.\n\nStella\n\nStella is a great horned owl, a species considered to be one of the largest and most powerful in North America. She is a voracious and efficient predator; she can grip her prey with up to 28 lbs of force. In the wild she would hunt rodents, rabbits, and snakes.\n\nStella was born in 2010 in Washington State. She arrived at Elmwood Park Zoo in August 2011 and has since served as an Education Ambassador, helping to teach people of all ages about wildlife conservation.\n\nBirthdate: 2008\n\nHeight: 2 ft\n\nWeight: 3 lbs\n\nWingspan:5 ft\n\nAZA Raptor Taxon Advisory Group\n\nThe AZA Raptor Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) works with the Elmwood Park Zoo in support and management of captive birds of prey. It is through this partnership that this owl represents one of thousands of raptors that are housed at zoological institutions nationally. The TAG focuses its efforts on conservation of raptors both here in the United States as well as globally. The TAG is supportive of the use of this owl as a means to further raise awareness as to the majesty of owls and the need to continue to conserve them and all raptors. We are proud to work with the TAG, and share their support of owl conservation and public awareness.\n\nNoah\n\nNoah was born in Maine. At just 8 weeks old, he suffered an 80 foot fall and landed on his head. Noah spent the first year of his life recovering from brain and eye injuries in the Hospital for Large Animals at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Deemed unfit to be released back into the wild, Noah was placed in a rehabilitation facility where he spent several years assisting humans with educational outreach programs. Elmwood Park Zoo acquired Noah in December 2008. As one of the Zoo’s Educational Ambassadors, he helps teach people of all ages about wildlife conservation.\n\nBirthdate: 07/06/2001\n\nHeight: 3 ft\n\nWeight: 9 lbs\n\nWingspan: 7 ft\n\nBald Eagles – A Conservation Success Story\n\nIn 1980, the total population of bald eagles in Pennsylvania numbered only three pairs. In 2013, there were at least 271 active nesting pairs. Pesticides such as DDT often collect in fish and nearly eliminated the bald eagle population in the 1960’s. These chemicals weaken eggshells, limiting their ability to reproduce. DDT was banned in 1972, and since that time, eagle numbers have rebounded significantly. In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald eagle from the endangered species list.

The TAG is supportive of the use of this eagle as a means to further raise awareness as to the majesty of eagles and the need to continue to conserve them and all raptors. We are proud to work with the TAG, and share their support of eagle conservation and public awareness.\n\nVirginia Opossum\n\nThere are more than sixty species of opossums, but the most common is the Virginia opossum. It is the only marsupial or animal with a pouch in North America. Opossums are known for their defense tactic of faking death. When threatened, they lay on their side with the intent to deceive predators into thinking that they are injured or dead. This reaction is sometimes involuntary, and triggered by extreme fear. It can also be used to convince large animals that they are not a threat to their young.\n\nStriped Skunk\n\nThe striped skunk is the most common skunk in North America and found right here in Pennsylvania. As a defensive system, skunks have the ability to emit a strong smelling fluid from the two glands located near its tail. Although they hold enough chemical for 3 shots, skunks prefer not to waste their spray. They will first confront an encroaching animal by flashing their white tail and stomping their feet. If the intruder persists, it can spray its yellow, oily liquid up to 12 feet with devastating accuracy. The spray doesn’t cause any real damage, but the smell is potent, uncomfortable and may linger for days.\n\nDomestic Ferret\n\nThe domestic ferrets are part of the same family as weasels, otters, skunks, badgers and mink. A common misconception is that ferrets are rodents, when in actuality they are a completely different scientific order. It is unknown when ferrets were first domesticated.\n\nFerrets are small, affectionate, playful and welcome human interaction. They tend to be very curious and will wiggle their way into tiny spaces. Ferrets are very social animals and enjoy company, as well as entertaining. However, they are known for their smell and will mark their territory with a distinctive burst of scent.\n\nChinchilla\n\nChinchillas are rodents that are native to the Andes Mountains in South America. Out of all land animals, the chinchilla has the thickest fur, containing 20,000 hairs on each square inch of its body. Fifty hairs grow from one follicle, where as humans only grow one hair per each follicle. Their dense fur prohibits flees and other skin parasites to feeding on their blood.\n\nTheir name derives from the Chichinas, an American Indian tribe who hunted chinchillas for their soft fur. Chinchillas were hunted nearly to extinction and are still listed as critically endangered species.\n\nAfrican Pygmy Hedgehog\n\nOut of all 17 species of hedgehogs on the planet, the most common is the African pygmy hedgehog. When an African pygmy hedgehog is introduced to a new or exceptionally strong smell, it sometimes creates a large amount of saliva, which it spreads onto its spines as a defense mechanism. Another, more common defense tactic is tensing all of the muscles and rolling into a ball to protect the head and limbs. It also sleeps in this defensive position. When frightened the hedgehog makes a variety of sounds, such as chirps, hisses, growls, and screams.\n\nSnowy Owl\n\nSnowy owls are equipped to survive in the frigid Arctic temperatures. The abundance of feathers on their body allows them to stay heavily insulated against the cold. The feathers covering their feet look a lot like fuzzy slippers, and provide extra warmth. Unlike most owls, snowy owls are diurnal. Snowy owls will hunt during the extended daylight of the artic summer. They are known to perch on a branch or lookout and wait for prey. Their acute sense of hearing allows them to locate prey hiding beneath the snow. Much of their diet consists of lemmings, but they can also use their talons, swoop down and grasp fish from the water.\n\nMoluccan Cockatoo\n\nMoluccan Cockatoos are vulnerable to extinction in the wild. Numbers have declined due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss. During the height of the trapping of this species, over 6,000 birds were being removed from the wild per year. Now only about 2,000 exist in the wild. Moluccan Cockatoos are the loudest parrot in the pet parrot trade. The Moluccan Cockatoo is widely considered to be the one of the most demanding parrots to keep as a pet, due to their high intelligence, large size, potential noise level, and need to chew.\n\nGreat Horned Owl\n\nThe great horned owl is named after its feather tufts above its ears that look like horns. The female is much larger than the male and has a higher pitched call. They get their nickname, “the tiger of the sky”, from their hunting skills and assortment of prey. They prey on a wide variety of animals- from tiny rodents to mammals and birds larger than the owls themselves. The soft, loose feathers of a horned owl allow it to fly very quietly without scaring away their prey. Paler plumage is found on those that inhabit desert areas or snowy areas.\n\nEastern Screech-Owl\n\nEastern screech-owls are equipped with great hearing, big eyes, and talented feathers. The screech owl can use its hearing to locate its prey, even if its prey is hidden underground or camouflaged. Their enormous eyes allow them to capture any small movements in the dark. Its plumage resembles the look of tree bark, which allows them to blend into their environment. Screech-owls can mimic the movement of branches by swaying back and forth. They have the ability to enlarge their appearance of their body by fluffing up their feathers. This tactic is used to scare away larger birds of prey.\n\nBlack Vulture\n\nBlack vultures have broad wings, tiny tails, and powerful wing strokes. Black vultures have a poor sense of smell, so they depend on their sight to search for food. Many times a black vulture will follow around a turkey vulture to lead them to a carcass. They are the only species of New World vulture, which preys on cattle. They have been known to swarm in groups and harass cows giving birth and their newborn calves. Black vultures can regurgitate as a self-defense method or to decrease weight before flying. Black vultures are also known for their high socialization and will even share a meal with relatives.\n\nAfrican Bullfrog\n\nThe African bullfrog is the largest amphibian located in South Africa. The frog has the ability to tolerate Africa’s harsh environment. Temperatures can rise to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and plummet below freezing in the winter. During this time the bullfrog will remain underground until the rainy season begins. Calls such as their recognizable loud, bellowing call is used to locate females during mating season.\n\nWood Turtle\n\nThe word turtle gets its name from its pyramidal scutes on its shell that resembles rings of wood. Wood turtles are highly intelligent and have unique homing capabilities. Experiments have shown that their ability to locate food in a maze is similar to that of a rat. They have also been shown to navigate back to a location after being displaced 1.5 miles away.\n\nPrehensile-Tailed Skink\n\nPrehensile-tailed skinks have numerous names. A few include monkey-tailed skinks, Solomon Island skinks and Solomon Island green tree skink. They are the only skinks with a prehensile tail, meaning it can be wrapped around branches for balance. They are the largest species of skink and the only completely herbivorous skinks. The skink will get most of its water intake from its diet of foliage, fruit, and vegetables, but may rarely descend to the ground for water.\n\nThe prehensile-tailed skink is a concern due to capturing for the pet trade and habitat loss from logging. The Solomon Islands government has regulated trade on these and other reptiles to help avoid decreasing populations. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the Prehensile-Tailed Skink Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nNelson’s Milk Snake\n\nThe nelson’s milk snake is one of the 24 different subspecies of milk snakes. It varies through its different colors and patterns. The snake is normally solitary and nocturnal. However, they are more common during the day when the weather is cooler and the ground is wet. Nelson milk snakes have the ability to consume venomous species including other snakes.\n\nGopher Tortoise\n\nGopher tortoises are named after their ability to dig large and deep burrows. This shelter provides year-round protection from extreme heat to frigid temperatures. Using its strong front legs, the tortoise can dig a burrow that is 10 feet deep and 40 feet wide. Many other species depend on the burrows dug by gopher tortoises for survival. As an herbivore, the gopher tortoise will forage for grasses and leaves. Populations of gopher tortoises are rapidly declining due to habitat loss.\n\nCorn Snake\n\nThe corn snake is also called the red rat snake, and gets its name from living near cornfields. They are known as constrictors, meaning the snake will coil up around its prey until it has suffocated. The corn snake can swallow its prey in one piece and only requires food once every few days. Corn snakes are very beneficial, especially to farmers, as they help to reduce rodent populations.\n\nChuckwalla\n\nThis wrinkly, skin folded lizard is diurnal and spends a vast amount of time basking in the sun. To prevent overheating, the chuckwalla will move into shady holes or crevices. It will also move in between rocks or squeeze into crevices in order to hide from predators. The chuckwalla is solitary meaning it spends the majority of its life alone. As a desert resident, the chuckwalla obtains almost all of its consumption of water directly from the plants it feeds on.\n\nRed-tailed Boa Constrictor\n\nThe boa constrictor, also nicknamed the red-tailed boa or the common boa is one of the largest snakes in the world. Boas are not poisonous, but have the ability to intensely suffocate prey. Boas will surprise their prey by coiling around them and squeezing them until death. The snake can swallow its prey entirely whole, which is later digested by its strong stomach acid. After a large meal, the boa constrictor can go weeks before consuming food again.\n\nBlue-Tongued Skink\n\nThe blue-tongued skink is a fairly small lizard that is recognizable by its blue tongue. The skink is a ground-dweller. It uses its powerful bite to feed on snails and other prey, sometimes refusing to release its mouth. When threatened the lizard will dart toward its prey, open its mouth and display its blue tongue. The lizard can also hiss and puff up its body to frighten enemies.\n\nBearded Dragon\n\nThe bearded dragon is thorny and scaly in appearance. It gets its name “bearded” dragon from the spikes around its head that are similar to a beard. When frightened or displaying, they will gape and expand the scales on the throat pouch to show off a dark beard. To communicate they will bob their heads, bow, and even wave their hands. Unlike most lizards, bearded dragons cannot regrow body parts such as their tail or legs.\n\nBall Python\n\nThe ball python is one of the smallest African pythons. In comparison to other pythons they are also non venomous. Since they are nocturnal, they rely on heat sensing pits around their mouth. Their eyes also adjust to low-level light levels. Like other snakes, the ball python doesn’t have movable eyelids. Since the snake doesn’t have to blink, it can stay hidden when camouflaged and waiting for prey.\n\nThe snake gets its name from its tendency to curl up in a ball when it feels threatened.\n\nGreen Iguana\n\nIguanas are some of the largest lizards found in the Americas. Iguanas are lizards identified by their stocky body and its spines that extend down its back and tail. Their long, sharp tail makes up about half the length of its body. They are manily spotted high up in the treetops and live near water. They are excellent swimmers and will plunge into the water below for safety if they feel threated.\n\nWestern Hognose Snake\n\nThe western hognose snake comes in an array of colors phases, patterns and varieties. It is known for its trademark pointy nose that is used to borrowing and hiding in sand and loose gravel. They are known for their many defense mechanisms. Most unique is their ability to play dead if they sense danger or a threat. The hognose snake will turn on its back, open its mouth and stick out its tongue. They can even bleed from the mouth and release a foul smell to assist in the act.\n\nGila Monster\n\nThe Gila is the largest lizard native to the United States and one of the few venomous lizards on the planet. The Gila monster uses its grooved teeth to release venom into its prey. Its bite is very strong and it can continue to clutch its prey, sometimes even biting down harder into the skin before releasing. A Gila monster will open its mouth and produce a hissing sound to warn off enemies. If a human endures a Gila bite they will not die, but may experience pain, swelling and shock.\n\nEastern Box Turtle\n\nAll 6 subspecies of box turtles are native to North America. Box turtles tend to be diurnal or active during the day. Box turtles can tuck their head, limbs and tail into their shell, giving them their name, box turtle. Their shell has a hinge that allows it to close tightly and shield them from enemies. They were once widespread and very common, but due to habitat loss, illegal pet trade and cars, box turtles are now vulnerable to extinction.\n\nWestern Rat Snake\n\nWestern, or “black” rat snakes, are one of the longest snakes located in North America. Since the snake doesn’t have venom, if it feels threatened, it will rustle its tail in dead leaves to mimic the sound of a rattlesnake. They can also produce a horrible odor to deter a threat. During colder temperatures the snake will share its den with other snakes such as the timber rattlesnake and copperhead. Due to this behavior rat snakes are also nicknamed pilot snakes.\n\nAmerican Alligator\n\nAmerican alligators are the largest reptiles in the United States. They are well-adapted swimmers, and use their powerful tail to propel through freshwater. However, alligators are generally slow when moving on land. An alligator can go through 3,000 teeth in its lifetime. Once its teeth become worn down, they are replaced. You can distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by its teeth. A crocodile’s mouth will expose two giant teeth when their jaw is shut. Also, alligators tend to have a wider and more rounded snout than crocodiles.\n\nWhite-Throated Woodrat\n\nThe woodrat is often referred to as a packrat because it hoards various items in its den. Their nest can be as big as 4 feet high by 8 feet wide, and filled with nesting materials and manmade objects. They are particularly fond of shiny objects.\n\nOnly one packrat resides in each den, unless a mother is caring for her young. During the day, the nocturnal woodrat will take shelter in its den or find a rock crevice or hallow tree. There are 22 known species of woodrats.\n\nWhite-Faced Saki Monkey\n\nWhite-faced saki monkeys are diurnal, meaning they are active during daylight and rest in the evening. They spend most of their time in the middle to lower canopy level of the forest, rarely walking along the ground. Their ability to jump 32 feet in the air and quickly leap from branch to branch earned them the nickname “flying monkeys.”\n\nWhite-faced saki monkeys are hunted for food, captured for the pet trade and suffer from habitat destruction. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the white-faced saki monkey Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nSouth American Coati\n\nSouth American coatis are closely related to raccoons and they share many common characteristics. They both have a distinctive ringed tail, which is used to balance on tree branches. The coati is nicknamed “hog-nosed raccoon” due to its long, pig-like snout. Coatis are arboreal animals, and have the ability to mate and build nests among the trees. The coati’s rotating ankle joints allow it to descend trees headfirst.\n\nRed Panda\n\nThe fluffy red panda is easily recognized by its adorable, small size and ringed tail. Almost half of the red pandas body length is in its large, bushy tail, which it depends on for balance and warmth during colder temperatures. As an arboreal species, the red panda is known for spending most of its time up in the tree branches. Bamboo makes up a huge portion of its daily diet, but the red panda also relies on other items to gain its essential nutrients. Just like a giant pandas, the red panda has an additional thumb, used for grasping bamboo sticks. A red panda can eat up to 200,000 leaves of bamboo each day.\n\nThe red panda is endangered in its native range due to habitat loss and poaching. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the Red Panda Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nOcelot\n\nAn ocelot is two times the size of an average housecat. Their coats have very distinct markings and a variety of unique patterns. Although ocelots are considered terrestrial, they are avid climbers and will ascend through trees. The cat is mostly nocturnal and very territorial. Their keen senses of hearing and good vision allow it to hunt in the nighttime. Instead of chewing its food the ocelot uses its blade-like teeth to tear the meat into pieces and swallow it whole. Like a domestic cat, its raspy tongue can successfully clean every piece of meat from a bone. Ocelots sometimes become the prey of harpy eagles, jaguars, and anacondas.\n\nNorth American River Otter\n\nThe playful North American river otter is well adapted for its semi-aquatic lifestyle. It’s equipped with thick fur, short legs, webbed feet and a narrow body. All of these features play a main role in allowing the otter to swim efficiently, even in frigid temperatures. Their thick fur is water-repellent and serves as an insulator against extreme temperature conditions. The slender and flexible shape of its body allows it to swiftly move through the water and through underground tunnels. A river otter can dive up to 60 feet and swim 7 miles per hour.\n\nNorth American river otters suffered great loss to their population, in the 20th century, due to habitat loss and water pollution. Conservation efforts were put in place and otters were reintroduced, increasing their population. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the American River Otter Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nNorth American Porcupine\n\nThere are almost thirty different porcupine species 0f porcupines. Their body is coated in about 30,000 quills. Its quills are used as a defensive mechanism. While they cannot shoot their quills, they detach quite easily and discourage predators. Porcupines are not very aggressive and will only use this tactic if they feel threatened. Surprisingly, porcupines are very good swimmers and regularly climb trees to build nests or find food.\n\nNigerian Dwarf Goat\n\nThe International Dairy Goat Registry first registered these adorable little goats in 1981. They are the only true miniature goat breed of the dairy type. They have features comparable to other dairy goat breeds, but are much smaller in size. The Nigerian dwarf is commonly used for its milk production as well as a companionship. They have easy going and playful personalities. Their gentle and calm nature makes them a great companion for children and disabled and elderly people. You can find the curious goats exploring and climbing on tree stumps, rocks, and other objects.\n\nJaguar\n\nJaguars are the third largest cat in the world and the largest cat in the Americas. A jaguar’s eye-catching spots resemble roses (also known as rosettes) and they help to distinguish them from other cats. Unlike breeds of cats, the jaguar enjoys water and has the ability to roar. They can vocalize a variety of sounds such as snarls, grunts, growls and roars. Out of all the cat family, the jaguar has the strongest bite and uses its muscular jaw to suffocate and crush its prey.\n\nJacob Sheep\n\nThe true origins of the Jacob sheep are unknown. The breed remains unchanged, which means it has not been commercially improved or selectively bred. Jacob sheep are outgoing, friendly, and intelligent. They welcome attention and love to be scratched and petted. They differ from other breeds of sheep by their spotted pattern and its multiple horns, in both male and female.\n\nHartmann’s Mountain Zebra\n\nA Hartmann’s mountain zebra has a distinctive black and white stripped pattern. As their name suggests, they exhibit amazing climbing abilities like scaling over mountains. Hartmann’s mountain zebras can be discovered 2000 meters above sea level. Unlike other members of the horse family, they have very hard, pointed hooves, which allow them to climb the rocky terrain. It is very common to find Hartmann’s mountain zebras chasing, play fighting, and racing.\n\nBecause of the demand for land for agriculture and grassland for livestock animals, the zebra’s habitat is being destroyed and leaves them to compete with cattle for grazing areas. Zebras are hunted, both legally and illegally, many times so landowners have more room to farm.\n\nGolden Lion Tamarin\n\nGolden lion tamarins are named after their distinctive mane and vibrant golden orange color. The tree-dwelling monkey has one hallux or a big toe as a nail, combined with long toes and fingers, which helps they monkey to grab onto branches. These features also allow the monkey to rip apart tree bark in search of insects and spiders. The thumbs of a tamarin are not completely opposable, which prevents them from gripping objects very easily.\n\nGolden lion tamarins are endangered due to deforestation and increased agriculture. It is estimated there are only 1,500 remaining golden lion tamarins in the wild. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the golden lion tamarins Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nGiraffe\n\nA giraffe’s long legs and towering neck qualifies it as the world’s tallest mammal. Their neck is composed of seven vertebras, which gives the giraffe’s neck plenty of flexibility and a wide range of movement. Its lengthy legs allow it to sprint short distances at 35 miles per hour. Its prehensile, black tongue is about 20 inches long and is used for grasping foliage, grooming and cleaning its nose. Just like a human fingerprint, a giraffe’s pattern of spots is unique and allows researches to identify them. Their coat also serves as great protection in the wild; it can be distracting to predators and gives them the ability to blend in well with its surroundings in Africa. Giraffe’s individual patterns of spots will appear darker as the giraffe ages.\n\nCheck out our Giraffe camera for a live look*\n\nGiraffes may not appear during winter/cold days\n\nElk\n\nAnother name for an elk is the “wapiti”. The Native American word means “light-colored deer”. Deer are close relatives, but the elk is much larger. A male elk’s antlers can reach 4 feet over their head. Their antlers can grow up to one inch each day, making it the fastest growing bone of any mammal. The antlers of a male will fall off every March and will regrow in the spring. New antlers are coated with fuzzy velvet, which allows the living tissue to be supplied with nutrients. Once the bone has completely developed the antler hardens and the velvet is shed.\n\nDonkey\n\nDonkeys are members of the Equidae family, which also includes zebras and horses. They look alike, but donkeys have bigger floppy ears, which are stockier than those of a zebra or horse. Their keen sense of hearing allows them to hear another call of a donkey over 60 miles away. Donkeys are social animals and form connections with other donkeys. They prefer to reside with other donkeys, goats, sheep or horses to keep them company. They are great guard animals and will alert the herd if there are predators nearby.\n\nDonkeys are notorious for their stubborn personality, which has been attributed to a strong sense of self-preservation. A stronger prey instinct and a weak connection with man make it difficult to force or frighten a donkey into a situation that it perceives to be dangerous. Usually dependable, donkeys are often used as work donkeys in other countries. They have the ability to go a long period of time without drinking water. They can loose up to 30% of their body weight in water, and regain it all back after 5 minutes of drinking.\n\nChacoan Peccary\n\nChacoan Peccaries are the largest and least common out of the three species of peccary. They have special adaptations such as their kidneys and two-chambered stomachs, which can break down cacti and digest tough foods. They use their snouts to remove cacti spines and forage succulent plants to stay hydrated. Their scent glands on their backs give off a strong, musky odor, used to mark territory and identify individuals.\n\nUntil 1971, the Chacoan peccary was thought to be extinct. Only about 3,000 currently exist in the world, making them very rare and highly endangered. Their formerly isolated habitat disappeared due to ranches and hunting. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the Chacoan Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nBobcat\n\nBobcats are the most common wildcats in North America. A bobcat, like other cats walk so their back feet always match the print of their front feet. This makes their footprints appear as if a two-legged animal created them. Putting their feet in the same spot helps to reduce noise when they are hunting. A bobcat has multiple dens, one of which will be used for hunting. They sit or crouch down in their den, relying on sight and sound to locate prey. Once discovered, they will creep up on their prey, and then attack by sprinting and pouncing on them. A bobcat’s legs and paws allow them to run up to 30 miles per hour. Because a bobcats back legs are longer than its front legs, it has a bobbing-like step. Its distinctive stubby and bobbed cut tail is where the cats name is derived from.\n\nBlack-Footed Ferret\n\nThe black-footed ferret once was believed to be extinct. Although still endangered, they are making a remarkable recovery. Before their downfall, black-footed ferret habitats included grasslands in 12 American states, 2 Canadian provinces and parts of Northern Mexico. Their population was in the tens of thousands, before it rapidly declined in the 1970s and 1980s. The prairie dog population also dropped, leaving black-footed ferrets with a limited supply of food. Prairie dogs make up 90% of a black-footed ferret’s diet. The ferrets can consume more than 100 prairie dogs in a year.\n\nThe black-footed ferret is still listed as one of North America’s most endangered species. Elmwood Park Zoo participates in the Black-footed Ferret Species Survival Plan, a shared conservation effort by zoos throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\nAmerican Bison\n\nThe massive American bison is the largest mammal in North America. Their shaggy, heavy winter coats are shed in huge lumps. Despite their enormous 800-2,000 pound weight, an American bison can run at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. When in danger or startled bison have the ability to run off, jump over objects, and swim. They also are equipped with arched horns that can grow to be two feet. Since they have very poor eyesight, they rely on their excellent sense of hearing and smell.\n\nIn 2016, the National Bison Legacy Act was put into action, which recognizes the American bison as the national mammal of the United States.\n\nAfrican Straw-Colored Fruit Bat\n\nThe African straw-colored fruit bat is the second largest bat on the African continent and the most widely distributed of the African fruit bats.\n\nTheir long, pointed wings are built for endurance and make them strong fliers. Their wingspan can reach up to three feet and this trait allows them to travel long distances. Colonies of African straw-colored fruit bats can range anywhere from thousands to even millions! Their large colonies can be found in many areas such as trees, rocks, and caves.\n\nRose Hair Tarantula\n\nThe rose hair tarantula is also called the Chilean fire tarantula, or the Chilean red-haired tarantula. The rose haired tarantula is a common pet due to its low maintenance and that it is not dangerous to humans. Their tiny bristles or hair-like structures on their body are used when the tarantula feels in-danger. As a defense mechanism, they have the ability to launch their bristles on a predator.\n\nTurkey Vulture\n\nTurkey vultures are one of the few birds of prey that use their smell to detect food. They are truly scavengers, as they feed off of the carcass of dead animals. Their digestive system has the capability to kill any viruses and bacteria.\n\nTurkey vultures have the tendency to over eat. At an extreme level they will be unable to fly and regurgitate their food before flying off. Their bacteria-covered skin prevents predators from thinking twice. Despite their unattractive appearance, vultures play an important role in our environment. They assist in removing animal remains and prevent diseases from spreading.\n\nRed-Tailed Hawk\n\nThe red-tailed hawk is North America’s most widely distributed hawk. Their large wingspan and plumage allow them to soar for excessive amounts of time. Red-tailed hawks can also discover prey from 100 feet up in the air. Its strong beak and talons allow the hawk to swoop down and grasp its prey. Their call sounds like a loud raspy, “kree-eee-ar”, piercing scream. The iconic eagle cry you hear in most TV shows and movies is actually the fierce cry of a red-tailed hawk.\n\nPeregrine Falcon\n\nPeregrine falcons are renowned for their speed. In its characteristic-hunting dive, it has been known to reach speeds of up to 242 miles per hour, earning it the distinction of being the fastest member of the animal kingdom. With their tightly packed feathers, chest muscles and long wingspan, the peregrine falcon was built for speed. They are also found throughout every region, except for Antarctica, making them the most widespread bird on the planet.\n\nMontezuma Quail\n\nEven though the Montezuma quail has a noticeable pattern, it can be difficult to see when hiding in forests and other landscapes. If the quail feels threatened it will remain motionless until the predator is in close proximity. If danger comes too close, the quail will leap up and spring into flight.\n\nGolden Eagle\n\nThe golden eagle is a huge bird of prey that belongs to the hawk and eagle family. They get their name from the noticeable golden brown plumage on their head and neck. It is the second fastest animal in the world, accelerating at speeds of 200 miles per hour. The golden eagle uses its piercing talons and speed to pray on hares, marmots, squirrels and other mammals. Golden eagles have been known to eat tortoises. They fly with the tortoise held in their talons and then drop it on a rock outcrop to break the shell open.\n\nChicken\n\nChickens are the most common bird in the world. There are over 150 different breeds of chickens, which range in color and size. Chickens are not capable of sustained flight, but they can fly short distances. Chickens have small heads, short beaks, wings and a round body covered in feathers.Researchers have discovered there is at least 24 unique vocalizations chickens can produce. Males will use a shrill call to assertively communicate territory to other roosters. Females will cluck after laying an egg and also cluck in order to gather their young. They also have vocals that indicate a predator and the predator’s location.\n\nBurrowing Owl\n\nBurrowing owls are one of the smallest owls in North America. Burrowing owls get their name due to living underground in burrows or holes that were dug out by small mammals, such as ground squirrels and prairie dogs. When it feels threatened, a young owl can produce a sound much like a rattlesnake. This sound scares away any predators that may be close in range.\n\nLike many birds of prey, the eyes of the burrowing owl are extremely large but lack any muscle to control movement. As a result, the owl turns its head (up to 270 degrees) in order to look around.\n\nBlue and Gold Macaw\n\nWith its vibrant colors, the blue and yellow macaw is easily one of the most recognizable parrots. While it is a popular companion animal due to its coloring and personality, macaws are known to be an incredibly loud species and require constant attention while in captivity. Due to their needs, macaws are generally better suited for the wild. While blue-and-gold macaws aren’t an endangered species at this time, they are still at risk due to habitat loss through deforestation, pet trade, hunting, poaching, and the spraying of pesticides.\n\nBarred Owl\n\nThe barred owl’s ears aren’t visible from the top of their head, so they appear to have no ears when viewing them. Its sharpened hearing allows the barred owl to find its prey in complete darkness. Due to its streamlined shape of its flight feathers, it can swoop down without making a sound. An immature barred owl can “climb” up a tree by using its bill and talons to grasp tree bark.\n\nBarn Owl\n\nThe asymmetrical placing of the barn owl’s ears allow for its acute hearing that can better detect sound position and distance. Its huge binocular eyes have exceptional low-light vision, which allows it to easily find prey at night by sight. But its skill to discover prey by just sound is the best of any animal. It can easily target and capture rodents with efficiency. Combined with its high metabolic rate, it is believed that the barn owl consumes more rodents than any other creature, and thus it is a valuable ally to the farmer working to protect his crops from pests.\n\nBald Eagle\n\nRecognizable by its white head, brown body, and yellow beak, the bald eagle has been the national symbol of the United States since 1782. Bald eagles were once on the verge of extinction, due to hunting and pollution. Major efforts were put in place to help protect the eagles and luckily, their population has increased over the last 40 years.\n\nRed-Eyed Tree Frog\n\nIt’s easy to recognize red-eyed tree frogs due to their bulging red eyes and bright green body. If awoken the frog will uncover his bright red eyes, frightening potential predators. Startling predators gives the frog a chance to jump away to safety. Red-eye tree frogs are arboreal, meaning they spend a lot of time in the trees. Their feet have strong suction cup pads that make them amazing climbers.\n\nPanamanian Golden Frog\n\nThe Panamanian golden frog is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it may be in fact extinct in the wild. The Elmwood Park Zoo is one of a small number of institutions located in both the Republic of Panama and the United States that are committed to preserving these frogs through education, study, fundraising, and breeding captive specimens.\n\nPanamanian golden frogs communicate with rivals and prospective mates by hand waving. This unique attribute is thought to have evolved as a result of their throat calls being drowned out by the noise of the fast moving streams located in their natural habitats.\n\nGreen & Black Poison Dart Frog\n\nThe green and black poison dart frog’s vibrant colors warn others that they are toxic and serve as a warning to stay away. The toxic compounds enter the frog’s skin after it consumes its prey, commonly ants. The indigenous Emberá people of Colombia are known for using darts soaked in poison from three specific poison dart frogs in\n\nthe genus Phyllobates. Those darts are then used to hunt and kill animals for food.\n\nBumblebee Poison Dart Frog\n\nBumblebee poison dart frogs are also referred to as yellow-banded poison frog and yellow-headed poison dart frog. Their black spots and stripes extend all over their yellow body. Compared to other poison dart frogs, the bumblebee poison dart frog is among the loudest. It emits a loud call to warn off enemies, which echoes in the distance.\n\nDyeing Poison Dart Frog\n\nDyeing poison dart frogs are considered one of the most toxic, or poisonous, animals on Earth. The are recognized by their distinctive colors, and different colors are presented in different “morphs” of the animal. The “azureus” morph has bright blue skin that is nice to look at, but the color also serves as a warning; alkaloids in the skin carry a potent toxin that can paralyze or kill potential predators. It’s speculated that poison dart frogs develop their toxicity from eating insects that have consumed different poisons from the plants they eat. When dyeing poison dart frogs are bred in captivity and fed a varied diet, their skin does not emit the same toxins that they would in the wild."
