        "text": "Name: Arizona State University\n\nLocation: Tempe, Arizona\n\nNickname: Sun Devils\n\nWhy \"Sun Devils?\" No one knows. Arizona State is on its third name as a school, and they're on their third nickname as well. When they were Arizona State Teachers' College, they were the Bulldogs, but somewhere along the way, someone started referring to them as the Sun Devils. It became a big enough deal that the student body voted and the nickname was officially changed in 1946.\n\nNotable Alumni: Fashion designer Kate Spade; legendary comedian Steve Allen; author Amanda Brown; actress Lynda Carter, most famous for her role as Wonder Woman; director John Hughes; comedian Jimmy Kimmel; every member of the band Kongos; sportscaster Al Michaels; actor Nick Nolte; singer Linda Ronstadt; comedian David Spade; golfer Phil Mickelson; mixed martial arts legend Dan Severn; Cain Velazquez, current UFC Heavyweight Champion; and Doug Ducey, governor-elect of Arizona and founder of Coldstone Creamery.\n\nLast Season: 21-12, with a 10-8 record in Pac-12 play. They lost their first round games in both the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments. Tuesday's game will make their second trip to Milwaukee in 2014, as that's where they played Texas in the NCAA tourney.\n\nThis Season: 6-3, with all six wins at home and all three losses to top 100 KenPom teams.\n\nKenPom Ranking: #69\n\nPoints Leader: Gerry Blakes, 6'4\", 195 lb., 12.2 ppg\n\nRebounds Leader: Eric Jacobsen, 6'10\", 255 lb., 8.0 rpg\n\nAssists Leader: Tra Holder, 6'1\", 180 lb., m2.6 apg\n\nHead Coach: Herb Sendek, who picked up his 400th career win against Pepperdine on Saturday. He's in his ninth season at ASU, where he has a record of 146-122. Including previous stops at North Carolina State and Miami (OH), he's 400-280.\n\nAll Time Series: Marquette leads, 2-1"
