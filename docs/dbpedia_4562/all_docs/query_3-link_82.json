        "text": "In light of a lot of comments about nicknames in general, I decided to rate the different nicknames for each state's main university.\n\nThe best nicknames represent their state or state history well and appear powerful.\n\nOn three of them -- Louisiana, Ohio and Pennslvania -- I'm going with Louisiana State, Ohio State and Penn State because they are generally considered their state's main univer ities. On New Jersey, I'm going with Rutgers because I can't find a University of New Jersey.\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide: D. Doesn't get an F only because everybody associates Crimson Tide teams with Alabama ... but that's putting the cart before the horse.\n\n*Alaska-Fairbanks Nanooks: A-plus. Fantastic nickname. Very Alaskan.\n\nArizona Wildcats: C. Too generic.\n\nArkansas Razorbacks: C. OK name. Different. But not great.\n\nCalifornia Bears: A. The bear has always been associated with California.\n\nColorado Buffaloes: B. Good solid nickname, good with the state.\n\nConnecticut Huskies: A-minus. It's a nickname you don't associate with Connecticut, but when you turn it into UConn it sounds like Yukon, and becomes extremely clever.\n\nDelaware Blue Hens: D. Awful name that would be an F if it wasn't associated with Delaware.\n\nFlorida Gators: A-plus. Powerful nickname and strongly represents the state.\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs: C. Too generic.\n\nHawaii Warriors: C. Would have been a B or higher had they kept Rainbow Warriors.\n\nIdaho Vandals: C-minus. Weird nickname, not very representative of the state.\n\nIllinois Illini: A. What other state would have Illini as its nickname?\n\nIndiana Hoosiers: C. Very representative of the state, but what's a Hoosier?\n\nIowa Hawkeyes: C. It's the Hawkeye state, but why?\n\nKansas Jayhawks. A-minus. Pretty representative of the state's history.\n\nKentucky Wildcats: C. Too generic.\n\nLouisiana State Tigers: D. Too generic and not representative of the state.\n\nMaine Black Bears: A-minus. Good name for the state. Better than Lobsters.\n\nMaryland Terrapins: D. Terrapins? Fear the turtle nickname.\n\nMassachusetts Minutemen: A-plus. Fantastic nickname for Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan Wolverines: A-minus. Powerful nickname and it's the Wolverine state.\n\nMinnesota Gophers: D. Minnesota may be the Gopher state, but is that something to be proud of?\n\nMississippi Rebels: C. That high because it represents Mississippi's history, that low because if you were African American, would you want to be proud of that history?\n\nMissouri Tigers: D. See LSU.\n\nMontana Grizzlies: A-plus. Same reason as Florida Gators.\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers: C. Representative of the state, but kind of weird.\n\nNevada Wolfpack. B-minus. Good name, but a little generic.\n\nNew Hampshire Wildcats: C. Too generic.\n\nNew Jersey -- Rutgers Knights: C. Too generic.\n\nNew Mexico Lobos: B. Good, solid nickname.\n\n*New York -- SUNY Great Danes: B-minus. Unique, but not very New Yorkish.\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels: A. Read some history about what Tar Heels means in North Carolina. Great name.\n\nNorth Dakota Fighting Sioux: A-minus. Great name, but I can think of even better tribes from North Dakota that are more worthy, such as the Mandans, the Arikara and the Hidatsa. If you're not PC, that is.\n\nOhio State Buckeyes: D-minus. It represents Ohio, but Buckeyes??? A nut???\n\nOklahoma Sooners: A-plus. Fantastic name for Oklahoma.\n\nOregon Ducks: F. Ducks???\n\n*Penn State Nittany Lions: A-minus. Great name and represents Pennsylvania, even though there may not have been mountain lions in the Nittany Mountains (from what I read).\n\nRhode Island Rams: C-minus. Generic name, and how does it represent Rhode Island?\n\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks: C. Solid name, but it's still a chicken.\n\nSouth Dakota Coyotes: B-minus. Like the Nevada Wolfpack, a solid name, but a little generic.\n\nTennessee Volunteers: B. Good name for the state.\n\nTexas Longhorns: A. Great name. Would be A-plus except for the fact that many Longhorns went on to become steaks.\n\nUtah Utes: A. Like the Illinois Illini, what other team would be called the Utes?\n\nVermont Catamounts: B-minus. Unique nickname, but maybe a little too unique.\n\nVirginia Cavaliers: B. Good, solid nickname with some historical ties.\n\nWashington Huskies: B. Good, solid nickname. Would be even better for a team in Alaska.\n\nWest Virginia Mountaineers: A. Very representative of the state.\n\nWisconsin Badgers: D. See Minnesota Gophers.\n\nWyoming Cowboys: A-plus. Powerful nickname and very representative of the state. So much so that there's a cowboy on the state's licene plate -- the same logo that adorns the university's football helmets.\n\n* Corrected from first post.\n\nOK, you requested it, you got it:\n\nBaylor Bears: B-minus. Too generic, but gets a slightly higher mark than a C for the illiteration.\n\nDavidson Wildcats: C. All Wildcats nicknames get Cs.\n\nEast Tennessee State Buccaneers: B-minus. Buccaneers in East Tennessee? That doesn't make sense to me, but I may be missing something.\n\nEastern Washington Eagles: B. Good nickname for Eastern Washington. Would be higher except Eagles is a bit generic.\n\nFlorida A&M Rattlers: Before I rate this, I need to ask: Are there many rattlesnakes in Florida? If so, then this gets an A. If not, then this gets a B-minus.\n\nGonzaga Bulldogs: C. All Bulldogs nicknames get Cs.\n\nLouisville Cardinals: D. Cardinals is hardly a powerful nickname, and you don't think of Cardinals when you think of the city of Louisville.\n\nMiddle Tennessee State Blue Raiders: B-minus. A powerful nickname, but doesn't say anything about Tennessee.\n\nOklahoma State Cowboys: A. Fantastic nickname. Powerful and very representative of the state. Doesn't get the A-plus that Wyoming got, but that's because Wyoming has the cowboy logo on its license plates.\n\nOregon State Beavers: A-minus. Great nickname for the Beaver State. Gets an A-minus instead of an A because a beaver isn't the most fearsome critter on the planet, and what do you call the women's teams?\n\nRutgers Scarlet Knights: Was mentioned in the first post.\n\nSouth Florida Bulls: B. Good nickname. Not a lot of colleges nicknamed Bulls. But does it represent South Florida?\n\nTennessee Tech Golden Eagles: B. See Eastern Washington. I could picture eagles in Tennessee, especially in the mountainous areas.\n\nTexas A&M Aggies: F. All Aggies nicknames get Fs, even if they are ag colleges. Horrible nickname. Might as well call them Plow Jockeys. I can think of a lot of better nicknames for ag colleges.\n\nTexas Tech Red Raiders: C. Powerful, but not representative of Texas.\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies: B-. OK, a hokie is just a turkey, but this is such a unique nickname that it deserves this high a mark.\n\nWashington State Cougars: B. Same rule applies as Eastern Washington."
