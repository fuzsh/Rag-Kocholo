        "text": "INDIANA (AP) — Students at Indiana University of Pennsylvania want the school to drop its \"Indians\" nickname, just as it abandoned the Indian sports mascot nine years ago.\n\nBut the university president and trustees say it probably won't happen because the matter was resolved two years ago.\n\nOne of two branches of the student government passed a resolution 21-7 Monday, urging the school to give up a nickname students say is racist.\n\n\"They need to make a better effort, either by consulting Native Americans or consulting the students,\" said Tim Golding, president of student congress. \"They changed things a couple years ago, but they only came halfway. They didn't finish the deal.\"\n\nIn 1998, the school adopted \"Cherokee\" the bear after six years without a mascot. But school officials said the name, which first appeared in the campus newspaper in 1928, would remain.\n\nThe campus bell tower and the letter \"I\" had proceeded the bear as school symbols.\n\nLawrence Pettit, the university president, said he most likely wouldn't support a name change. He said the school satisfied people who found the Indian mascot offensive while keeping a reference to American Indian heritage.\n\nThe university wanted to choose an animal that was sacred to the Woodland Indians who lived near the campus in western Pennsylvania, Pettit said. Its options were an eagle or bear, and because Clarion University has the Golden Eagles, Indiana chose the bear.\n\nPettit said he felt the problem was with the school's prior mascot, not the name \"Indians.\"\n\n\"Notre Dame is not being disrespectful to the Irish for using that nickname,\" the Fighting Irish, he said Wednesday.\n\nSome students say the ties between the bear and the \"Indians\" nickname is muddled.\n\n\"They changed the name to the Bears because bears are indigenous to the area, but they named it 'Cherokee' the bear,\"' Golding said.\n\n\"Cherokees have never been in this area. ... We also want to clear up the confusion. What are we? Are with the Bears or the Indians?\"\n\nSuzan Shown Harjo, the president of the Morning Star Foundation, an advocacy group for American Indians in Washington, D.C., said the school's argument is \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"You should remove all human beings from the naming game,\" Harjo said. \"If they want to do the right thing, they will quit honoring us by using us for recreation.\"\n\nSeveral universities changed nicknames in recent years. The Marquette Warriors became the Golden Eagles; Eastern Michigan's Hurons are the Eagles; and St. John's former Redmen are the Red Storm."
