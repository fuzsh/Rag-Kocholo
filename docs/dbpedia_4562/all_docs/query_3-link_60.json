        "text": "Joe D'Amodio | damodio@siadvance.com\n\nNicknames mean a lot\n\nWhen it comes to sports, team nicknames mean a lot. Clubs often try to fit the persona of a certain moniker, often reveling in its image.\n\nTake the Oakland Raiders, for example, enveloping themselves in the mystique of being the \"Bad Boys\" of the NFL, clad in silver and black with a one-eyed pirate on their helmet.\n\nSome nicknames, like the Celtics, Canadiens or Yankees, automatically conjure up thoughts of tradition and time-honored excellence.\n\nThe point here is that nicknames are inseparable from their teams. And when it comes to high schools, the entire student body, teachers and alumni become attached. Nicknames are symbols of their schools.\n\nWith all that in mind, we take a look at the nicknames of schools throughout Staten Island, with an emphasis on their origins.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nBEARS, St. John Villa\n\n\"Our school is named after St. John the Baptist,\" noted former school principal Sr. Lois Darold, now the head of the Villa convent.\n\n\"In the Gospels, he's noted as a man who went into the desert to prepare for his ministry ... and he lived on locusts and wild honey. Nobody thought being called the 'Locusts' was a very good idea,\" Sr. Darold said with a laugh.\n\n\"So we thought, 'What animal is most closely associated with eating wild honey?\" And that's how Villa got its nickname.\n\n\"The bear is an animal of great strength, and honey is something that's nurturing and nourishing,\" Sr. Darold added. \"It was adopted sometime before the 1960s. But it all comes back to the patron saint of the school, St. John the Baptist.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nCENTRAL COUGARS, New Dorp\n\nAccording to former football coach Joe Clark, the name \"Centrals\" was penned by the Advance back in the 1940s to differentiate between Tottenville on the South Shore and Port Richmond and Curtis on the North Shore.\n\nWhen he came to New Dorp from Curtis in 1948, legendary football coach Sal Somma wanted to change the nickname to \"Pioneers,\" but then-principal Mary McGuiness shot it down. \"What's a Central? What does it stand for?\" Somma had wondered.\n\nAfter several attempts through the years to make a nickname change, New Dorp became home to the \"Central Cougars\" in April of 2003.\n\n\"The kids wanted something they can relate to,\" principal Deirdre DeAngelis said at the time of the change. \"They didn't know what a Central was.\"\n\nThe transition was a two-year process that included surveys of the NDHS community – over 5,000 past New Dorp graduates and staff members – and a vote by the student body at the time.\n\n\"We didn't want to show any disrespect to the past, so we kept the Central name,\" said Ms. DeAngelis. \"We received over 30 suggestions, with the final four choices being Cougars, Coyotes, Jaguars and Bulldogs. Cougars beat Bulldogs out by some 100-200 votes.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nDRAGONS, CSI/McCown\n\nA few years ago, the College of Staten Island HS for International Studies and the McCown Expeditionary Learning School merged their resources to form the borough's newest sports program.\n\nWith that inception came the birth of the Island's latest high school nickname: the Dragons.\n\nHow that nickname came about wasn't only a matter of democracy in action, but asking students to contemplate what mascot and what colors would best reflect the program.\n\n\"During the first year of our school, in their advisories and through Student Parliament, students came up with suggestions for our mascot and it was then voted on by the students in our first class,\" noted former CSI/McCown principal Aimee Horowitz. \"We did a lesson in advisory on how our mascot and colors represent who we are as a school and how they reflect our mission.\"\n\nCSI/McCown currently has varsity programs for boys and girls in basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track; boys' soccer and wrestling; and girls' softball.\n\n\"I think it's something different,\" said former AD Dennis Barrett of the nickname. \"It represents the school and the students' choice. The vote was a few years ago, but today's class still likes the name Dragons. In fact, we have a Dragons dance team, and last year they bought a dragon costume – sort of something you might see during a Chinese New Year celebration. It must be 20 feet long. And they'll perform with it at various school functions.\"\n\nStaten Island Advance\n\nEAGLES, St. Peter's\n\nSome institutions have been around so long it's hard to find people who remember a nickname's true origin. Such is the case with St. Peter's. Everyone contacted said they remember the nickname always being \"Eagles.\"\n\n\"The Christian Brothers of St. John Baptist De LaSalle, in typical Latin tradition, named the school's athletic teams the Eagles to instill a sense of a team or tradition that flies high,\" said former school principal John Fodera, who is now the president of the school.\n\nMany athletic references to the school in the 1930s, including those in the Advance, called St. Peter's the \"Saints\" or the \"Blue and Gold\" after its school colors. It wasn't until 1935 that \"Golden Eagles\" described the school's athletic teams in this newspaper. But the school yearbook has always been named \"The Aquilan,\" Latin for \"eagle.\"\n\n\"As far as we can trace, since World War II, St. Peter's Boys High School has been referred to as the Eagles,\" Fodera said.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nFALCONS, Susan Wagner\n\nNo complex origins here, just good old-fashioned democracy at work.\n\nAccording to former athletic director Fred Hess, \"There was an open student contest back in 1968 (when the school opened) to choose the nickname. At the time, there were only 1,500 kids in the school. And it ended up being 'Falcons.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nGATORS, Notre Dame Academy\n\nThe school's original nickname was the \"Green Machine,\" a moniker which dated back to the mid-1970s.\n\nAccording to late athletic director and basketball coach Peggy Ryan: \"We had a particularly good basketball team at the time ... something like 106-5 in four years. They were a methodical group, technically sound. At the time, the Cincinnati Reds' 'Big Red Machine' was dominating baseball. It was the Advance that started calling us the 'Green Machine' ... I guess the paper likened us to that Cincinnati team.\"\n\nBut in 1997, \"the kids wanted a mascot, something to build on. There were a few nominations, the kids had an election and Gators won,\" Ryan had recalled. It took a few years, but Gators – a fitting choice, to go with the school's green and white colors – was recognized as NDA's official nickname in 2001.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nHILLTOPPERS, St. Joseph Hill\n\nAccording to former principal Sr. Charlotte, the derivation of the nickname is easy to trace.\n\n\"We're the Hilltoppers because we're on top of a hill,\" recalled Sr. Charlotte – who now resides in California – during a 1992 interview.\n\nBut the team mascot, a koala bear, has a different story. Apparently, the cuddled Aussie mammal has been the representative of the school since the mid-to-late 1980s. Why a koala?\n\n\"A lot of the animals had already been taken as mascots,\" reflected long-time Hill athletic director Janice Phillips. \"I think the girls at the time wanted something unique.\"\n\n\"When I got there my freshman year, it was already the unofficial mascot of the school,\" noted Tara Walsh, a three-time Advance All Star basketball player and the Student Council President during her senior year of 1991-92. \"The juniors and seniors used to have 'SJHA' keychains with a koala bear on them.\n\n\"One of my campaign promises was that I would get a koala bear suit for our basketball games,\" Ms. Walsh said. \"After I won, I started a collection for it.\" The school conducted a vote and the kaola was named Kiki. \"That first suit lasted a while,\" said Ms. Phillips. \"The koala suit we have now is about four years old.\" But Ms. Phillips points out the school's official nickname is still Hilltoppers.\n\nMs. Walsh remembered going to Sr. Charlotte about making the school's symbol something more tangible. \"We must have given Sr. Charlotte 1,000 different animals for a mascot, but she disapproved them all,\" Ms. Walsh said. \"She said they were all too violent.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nLIONS, Monsignor Farrell\n\nBeside being the nickname, it's also the school's seal. \"It comes from the coat of arms from Monsignor Joseph Farrell's family,\" according to MF's first principal, Monsignor John Considine.\n\nThe choice for the school nickname was left up to a vote by the school's first class, coming down to either \"Lions\" or \"Falcons.\"\n\n\"Falcons were big at the time because of the Air Force,\" Considine recalled. \"But Lions was overwhelmingly voted in.\"\n\nRumor has it, however, that even if the choice hadn't been \"Lions,\" the school already had everything set up for that choice anyway.\n\nA few years later, Susan Wagner came along and adopted the bird moniker. The Farrell-Wagner connection also is associated with the school's location.\n\n\"When Farrell was being built, the location of the school was either going to be where we are now in Oakwood, or where Susan Wagner is now,\" noted former Farrell principal Monsignor Thomas Bergin.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nMAVERICKS, Moore Catholic\n\nAfter becoming coed in September of 1969, the school's name was changed from Countess Moore to the present Moore Catholic by then-principal Monsignor Thomas Bergin.\n\n\"He thought the 'Countess' name had a stigma of being an all-girls school,\" the late Warren Fenley, the school's former dean of students, said in a 1993 interview.\n\nWith the influx of boys came an increase in athletics ... and a need for a nickname.\n\n\"We ran a contest, and 53 boys submitted both a name and a drawing of what the team name would be,\" recalled Fenley in 1993. The list was narrowed to three before the short-horned steer was chosen.\n\n\"I chose the term 'Mavericks' because of it being a maverick steer, plus I figured that this being the first boys' team, that they were 'mavericks' themselves,\" Fenley said in the interview. \"The maverick steer cuts away from the crowd. I felt it was appropriate.\n\n\"The toughest thing was to get it duplicated on uniforms. It was a tough emblem to copy,\" Fenley had added. \"Almost every time it appeared it was a little different. We usually had to settle for the closest replica.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nPANTHERS, Michael J. Petrides\n\nPetrides athletic director Michael Duffy said the school's nickname, the Panthers, came about by a vote of the students in the school in 1998, the first year of the high school's existence.\n\n\"As we where getting ready for Petrides to begin the sports program, (former principal) Mike Davino asked me to run a school-wide,\" explained Duffy. \"We had two choices, plus each student could write in a third choice if they wanted.\"\n\nMost of the choices were for the Panther and the Patriots, says Duffy.\n\nThe students voted overwhelmingly for the Panthers!\" said Duffy. \"Almost 20 years later I still think it was a good choice.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nPIRATES, Tottenville\n\nLittle is known how the Huguenot school — which came into existence in the 1930s in the town of Tottenville before its move in the early 1970s to Huguenot — got its nickname, but it probably had something to do with its proximity to the ocean in Tottenville and the legend that pirates once patrolled the waters in our area.\n\nAccording to former Tottenville HS product and football assistant Tom Gallahue, who is Chief Academic Officer of the Central Regional School District in South Jersey, the narrows and the Kill Van Kill were filled with pirates. According to his research, Capt. William Kidd shows up in stories and allegedly Blackbeard was famous for ruling the waters from New York Harbor to Long Beach Island, N.J.\n\nAccording to the Tottenville Historical Society, the Tottenville HS baseball team started using the Pirates name by 1948.\n\nThe Pirate logo, however, didn't start appearing on uniforms until 1955. Around that time, the school's newspaper was changed from The Trumpet to the Pirateer, according to the Tottenville Historical Society.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nRAIDERS, Port Richmond\n\nThe school nickname has changed twice in the past quarter century, both times due to cultural sensitivity.\n\nFrom the 1940s until 1984, Port Richmond's sports teams were named the \"Minstrels\" – a nickname which came about because of the school's dusty old football field, which gave the players a face full of soot, lending to the black-face or \"minstrel\" connotation.\n\nBut in 1984, former athletic director and football coach Joe Goerge said there was a consensus opinion among students, coaches and alumni to change the antiquated name.\n\n\"We brought it up to the student body who voted on it in homeroom,\" Goerge said. \"There were a couple of other nicknames on the ballot, but 'Red Raiders' was chosen.\"\n\nIt was a blast from the past, since Red Raiders had apparently been the school's nickname before Minstrels.\n\nUnfortunately, while those at the school didn't know this, the term \"Red Raiders\" was used to describe the undisciplined American Indian soldiers of the Confederate Army. And in April of 2001, State Education Commissioner Richard Mills urged all public high schools to drop the generations-old use of native American terms and symbols for school nicknames and mascots.\n\nFor Port Richmond, the transition was an easy one, as it simply dropped the first half of its nickname.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nSEAGULLS, McKee/Staten Island Tech\n\nIt comes from the alma mater school song, McKee's \"Harbor's Waters\" (based on the melody of Cornell University's fight song, \"Cayuga's Waters\"). There's a sea gull mentioned in the song, which was written by Frank Roantree, who taught plumbing shop at McKee.\n\n\"Far above the harbor's waters, Circling sea gulls' errie screaming\n\nSentinel by day, And the lighthouse bell,\n\nStands our noble Alma Mater, Whistling tug and throaty ferry\n\nLandmark on the bay. Sound her praises well.\n\nSing her praises, Sing her praises,\n\nSound her glories, Sound her glories,\n\nPledge your loyalty. Pledge your loyalty.\n\nHail to thee our Alma Mater Hail to thee our Alma Mater,\n\nHail! All Hail! McKee! Hail! All Hail! McKee!\"\n\nThe nickname usually appears as two words, although on some occasion, it has appeared as \"Seagull.\" The nickname itself gained acceptance in the late-1950s and early-1960s. During the 1930s and 1940s, the only nickname seen in the Advance was \"Vocationalists.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nTIGERS, Staten Island Academy\n\nTo the best of his recollection, former longtime Staten Island Academy athletic director Peter Rapp says the school's current nickname \"began to stick in 1962 or 1963.\"\n\n\"The Huus family (whose son, Bill, the former managing editor at the Advance who played sports at the school) came up with the name I believe,\" said Rapp, who is now the Dongan Hills school's athletic director emeritus.\n\nPrior to that, Rapp said the school went by the nickname of the Maroons, part of the school's maroon and gold colors.\n\n\"I did a lot of research ... and I don’t remember seeing the Tigers as part of our school nickname,\" said Rapp, who said the school opened in 1884 and is one of the oldest private schools in the country.\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nVIKINGS, St. Joseph by-the-Sea\n\n\"Before the school became co-ed, the Sea nickname was the 'High Tides',\" said former athletic director Bob Alegre. \"But when boys were admitted in 1974, the school decided on a stronger-sounding nickname, one that fit both the boys and girls teams.\"\n\n\"Both Viking men and women were strong and fighting people. And it also fit in with the school's location, its proximity to the water,\" explained Alegre.\n\n\"It demonstrates the spirit of strength and courage,\" added former late principal Monsignor Joseph Ansaldi.\n\nMonsignor Ansaldi came up with the school's logo: A modern-looking St. Joseph with sails in the back and the insignia, \"The sea belongs to the Lord.\"\n\nGerald Kane | gkane@siadvance.com\n\nWARRIORS, Curtis\n\nThe origin of the Curtis nickname isn't clear.The late Sal Somma once told the Advance that during the 1931 season, the football team was called the \"Dragons.\"\n\nBut the idea apparently died quickly.\n\nThe first mention of the current nickname in the school yearbook came in 1937 to describe the football team, the \"White Warriors\" -- white, for the color of their uniforms.\n\nBut the appearance of an Indian warrior in a couple of earlier yearbooks lends validity to the belief that the nickname existed before '37.\n\nIn time, the \"White\" part of the nickname was dropped, leaving just \"Warriors.\""
