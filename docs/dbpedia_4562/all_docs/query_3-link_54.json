        "text": "Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nUSA Today ran a story this week regarding a battle brewing between NC State and Loyola over the use of the nickname “Wolfpack”.\n\nApparently, NC State is not opposed to Loyola using the nickname in theory. Instead, NC State would like to prevent Loyola from using the nickname as a \"stand alone,\" therefore requiring them to only use it combined with their institutional name.\n\nIf this isn't acceptable, NC State would allow Loyola to “license the nickname for a fee.”\n\nThe report also details a similar incident that occurred between NC State and Nevada in 2008 which resulted in Nevada using the two-word nickname “Wolf Pack” as opposed to the one-word “Wolfpack.”\n\nMany universities share nicknames or mascots more amiably but what are the most popular of these shared spirit representatives?\n\nThe following slideshow presents the 18 most frequently used mascot/nicknames for institutions classified as Division One for sports competition.\n\nWe begin with nicknames that are used by at least four schools and work our way all the way up to the most commonly used mascot name in NCAA Division One athletics."
