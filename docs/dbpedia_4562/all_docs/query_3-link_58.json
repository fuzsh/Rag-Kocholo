        "text": "The controversy raged throughout the opening weeks of that inaugural school year as different factions argued over what symbol should represent the newest UC school. Many wanted a bear symbol that could compete with the Bruins of UCLA and the Bears of Berkeley, while others wanted to go in a completely different direction, demonstrating the independence and uniqueness of the school.\n\nA total of 67 nicknames were initially suggested by the student body. The names ran the gamut, from the wild (Bearcats, Rams, Bisons, Badgers, Gorillas) to the uninspired (Rovers, Ramblers, Possums, Chihuahuas, Valencias). There were colorful names (Red Raiders, Golden Eagles, Bluejays, Golden Beavers, Orangemen), names befitting the area’s heritage and environment (Caballeros, Friars, Vaqueros, Rattlers, Scorpions, Pioneers) and names that were, frankly, just weird (Aphids, Rocks, Bondsmen).\n\nAn election in November 1954 saw none of the proposed six nicknames receive a majority. While “Cubs” was the most popular of the six, many rallied against it because it showed the campus as a “little brother” to schools like UCLA and Cal. A write-in campaign, led by the men’s basketball team, was begun for the name “Hylanders,” a name suggested by freshman Donna Lewis. The name was changed to its current spelling and won easily. In recognition of her contribution to the university, Lewis received a lifetime pass to all athletic events.\n\n“Highlanders” fit the campus well for several reasons. The Box Springs Mountains, which stand behind the campus, were known as the Highlands. In addition, UCR is the highest elevation campus in the UC System.\n\nThe name proved to be a solid compromise. UCR Publicity Director Howard Cook had a friend create an aggressive little bear wearing a kilt for the school’s logo, and the campus took on a Scottish flare as buildings were named after Scottish regions. There was a brief uproar in 1988 when the athletics department proposed changing the mascot to a human figure in a kilt, a plan that was quickly scrapped.\n\nBut change was inevitable, and it occurred after the 1998 passing of the referendum that approved the move to Division I. Much as they had done years earlier, student-athletes took the lead, approaching the administration and saying that they “didn’t want a teddy bear in a dress” to represent them.\n\nThe change took time, money and input from New York based SME Design, Inc., a logo development company. Several logos were designed, including one with a bear featuring a half-blue face in homage to William Wallace, the Scottish hero and the subject of the movie Braveheart.\n\nIn 2011, the mascot was updated once again. Students voted online from 13 new designs and selected a new interlocking U and C logo as well as a streamlined version of the UCR mascot, featuring a roaring Scotty wearing a plaid Tam o' Shanter.\n\nEvery school in the University of California System has some combination of blue and gold as their school colors. The colors were selected for the university by a committee of students at what is now UC Berkeley in June 1873. Blue was considered because of the sky and the landscape, the student cadet uniforms, and the number of Yale graduates who were instrumental in the founding and administration of the university."
