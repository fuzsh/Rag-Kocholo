        "text": "To pass the time while flattening the curve of the coronavirus pandemic, minor league baseball teams have been taking to social media with a question.\n\nThey've been asking fans to go back in time to the team's creation and name the new club. The only catch was that the current name of the team isn't an option.\n\nSo we decided to take that same idea and apply it to New Jersey 's high school sports teams, where there is a lot of repetition. There are 27 nicknames used by by at least five different high schools in the state, led by Panthers, which has 15 different schools using the name.\n\nWith a fun spirit and some research into the history of these areas, here are some unique replacements for some New Jersey schools that use common sports nicknames.\n\nBergen Tech Knights\n\nNew nickname: Brigade\n\nThere are some high schools that use the Patriots name, but not nearly as many as those that use the Knights.\n\nBergen Tech is open to students from all 70 municipalities in Bergen County. The origin of Bergen County's name is disputed, but what isn’t argued is the importance the county held in the Revolutionary War.\n\nFrom the Battle of Fort Lee to the Baylor Massacre in River Vale, colonists ultimately retook Bergen County thanks to a strategic retreat through such towns as Englewood, Teaneck and Bergenfield.\n\nA brigade is a military term for a subdivision of an army, usually formed from a number of battalions coming together for a size anywhere between 1,500 to 4,000 troops. Bergen County technical schools consist of five schools and enroll 1,669 students, according to NJSIAA classifications.\n\nCliffside Park Red Raiders\n\nNew nickname: Rockets\n\nYou’d think a name like the Red Raiders would be pretty unique, but there are actually six schools that use it in New Jersey. There are more schools calling themselves the Red Raiders in the state than calling themselves the Bears, Hawks or Cardinals.\n\nThere has never been a rocket ship go into space in Cliffside Park, so what could this nickname possibly reference? Palisades Amusement Park, of course.\n\nThe popular amusement park called Cliffside Park home for more than 70 years until it closed in 1971 and featured five roller coasters, including the Cyclone long before the famous ride went to Coney Island.\n\nThe use of the name Rockets is a reference to the 1962 Freddy Cannon song about the park. In the song, Cannon says “my heart was flyin’ up like a rocket ship/down like a roller coaster”. Raritan is currently the only school in the state that uses Rockets.\n\nDover Tigers\n\nNew nickname: Ironhawks\n\nThe Tigers are the name for 12 schools in the state – 13 if you include Princeton being known as the Little Tigers.\n\nBut there’s too much history with this Morris County town to simply throw a generic name like the Tigers at it. Dover has incorporation dates going back to the 19th century, with work on the land that goes back even further. Stories from the 18th century believe that iron ore was so plentiful that it could be collected right off the ground in Dover.\n\nIn keeping with the history of iron in Dover, changing the logo over to a mascot made of iron would make for a unique name. An ironhawk doesn’t actually exist, but goes with the trend in some parts of the state of simply taking a name and adding a color to it, such as the Dwight Morrow Maroon Raiders and Pequannock Golden Panthers.\n\nA new silver and black color scheme would have made alumni Jacque MacKinnon proud, who played in the NFL for the Oakland Raiders.\n\nEgg Harbor Township Eagles\n\nNew nickname: Seagulls\n\nA dozen schools use the Eagles as a nickname, but none are more puzzling than Egg Harbor Township down in Atlantic County.\n\nThe town dates as far back as the 17th century and initially was incorporated with areas that are known today as Pleasantville, Longport and even Atlantic City. The town was named by Dutch explorer Cornelius Jacobsen May, who saw so many bird eggs when he came upon the inlet to the Great Egg Harbor River.\n\nA bird is clearly the right choice here, but an eagle? There are many different ways to go here and a seagull fits the bill, no pun intended. The only mention of a seagull throughout the state is Point Pleasant Beach, who are known as the Garnet Gulls. Not to mention, there is already a Gull and Seagull street in Egg Harbor Township.\n\nLodi Rams\n\nNew Nickname: Flames\n\nThere are 13 different schools in New Jersey that use Rams as a mascot, so there’s only so much creativity you can have with curved horns as a logo.\n\nNearby Ramsey also uses the Rams, but considering it’s basically a part of the town’s name, it’s understandable.\n\nLodi exists from now-defunct municipalities that were based in what is now South Hackensack and Saddle Brook.\n\nFor a new name, look no further than the town’s flag, with a flaming torch in the middle. What’s better is the school can keep their orange and blue color scheme, also used in the town’s flag. The Flames have stuck around with a name for Calgary (originally Atlanta) in the NHL, as well as by colleges such as Liberty and Illinois-Chicago.\n\nMidland Park Panthers\n\nNew nickname: Locomotives\n\nMidland Park was incorporated in 1894, during a boom that saw over two dozen new municipalities come to exist in the same year. The borough grew and expanded with land from Franklin Township, Ridgewood and Wyckoff among other neighboring areas.\n\nThe town’s name is said to be inspired by the New Jersey Midland Railway, which operated the railroad that passed through the area in the 1870s.\n\nA train-themed nickname would be a first for a New Jersey high school and could borrow from such prominent schools as Purdue or old logos like the Syracuse Chiefs before they became rebranded with the Mets.\n\nNot to mention, the term “loco” in the team name opens up countless ideas for the school’s student section.\n\nMorris Catholic Crusaders\n\nNew nickname: Foxes\n\nIf you think of a Catholic school in New Jersey known as the Crusaders, you probably think of Bergen Catholic first. That doesn’t bode well for Morris Catholic, which also uses the nickname.\n\nNon-public schools tend to go for a mascot that comes from some link to nobility. Let’s look at the history of where Morris Catholic calls home: Denville.\n\nDenville’s name comes from early settler John Hinchman in 1800. Hinchman stated that Denville’s name is traced back to dens of wild animals in the swampy regions along the Denbrook and Rockaway rivers.\n\nSo, if you're looking for animals that live in dens and have ties to nobility, the fox checks both boxes. Foxes are swift and cunning, and travel in groups.\n\nThere’s only one school using foxes as a nickname in the state: Moorestown Friends.\n\nPassaic Indians\n\nNew nickname: Turtles\n\nNine schools in New Jersey still use the term Indians as a nickname, and it periodically gets brought up to change the name with respect to Native Americans.\n\nThe name of Passaic derives from a Lenape word for valley, but that wasn’t the city’s original name.Settled in 1678 by Dutch traders, Passaic was originally Acquackanonk Township, named for a group within the Lenape tribe.\n\nWhile the name ended up being changed, Passaic could show honor to the people they originally were named for by using the turtle, featured on the totem of their tribe.\n\nTurtles are unassuming, but can withstand attacks in their shell and aren’t afraid to snap at a predator if provoked. It’s unique and makes for some unique mascot choices.\n\nRobert Aitken is a high school sports reporter for NorthJersey.com.
