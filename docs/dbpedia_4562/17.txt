OK, I still need two more squadron names.

I need the mascot or nicknames for HMM161 and HMM162 for the predominate UH34D era in Viet Nam for a challenge coin.

The patch I have for 161 is a blue flying horse. What's the squadron's name?

The patch I have for 162 is an eagle. What's the squadron's name?

hmm-162

Was in HMM-162 at New River in Aug-Oct 66 just out of flight school to get H2P certified prior to going WestPac. Patch was an eagle with searchlight-like beam from one eye and stretcher slung from claw. Name [ at that time to the best of a feeble memory ] was Golden Eagles. Joined HMM-263 [ Blue Eagles ] Nov 66 at Marble. Hope this helps. Joe H.

Re: Squadron Nick Names

Bill,

If you want to double check all your information, try Wikipedia and I should apologize, but perhaps you might use "The Greyhawks" for 161 but I believe that those that went into country May of 1965 would stick with "The Pineapple Squadron"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMM-161

hope this doesn't mess up your list of information.

To my knowledge, 161 did not have a nickname until 1965 when it deployed to Viet Nam. In Hawaii we called ourselves the "Pineapples" and when we deployed a pineapple was painted on the nose of each aircraft (and on almost anything else). When we flew ashore from the Princeton and later the Iwo Jima, pineapples were painted all over the ships. Other aircraft that landed at Phu Bai also were subject to have a pineapple painted somewhere.

Quote from Wikipedia

"HMM-161 deployed in May 1965 to Phu Bai, Republic of Vietnam[6] and attached to MAG-16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. It then relocated in January 1966 to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa to receive its new Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight. By April 1966, the Greyhawks had redeployed to Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam with a move to Phu Bai that June. The Squadron relocated once again in November 1966 to Futenma, Okinawa, where it was attached to Marine Aircraft Group 15(MAG-15), 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade. A month later the Greyhawks returned to CONUS, as they were attached to Marine Aircraft Group 26(MAG-26), 2d MAW at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. HMM-161 then redeployed in May 1968 to Quang Tri, Republic of Vietnam and attached to provisional Marine Aircraft Group 39(MAG-39), 1st MAW. The Squadron finished its Vietnam Years with its final deployment to Phu Bai in October 1969 while attached to MAG-16, 1st MAW."

I believe they are off by a year--I was assigned to HMM-161 from 7-66 to 10-66 at Phu Bai flying H-34s, then went to VMO-2.

HMM161 and HMM162

HMM161 was located at Hue-Phu Bai on 3 Aug 1966 when I joined; the squadron was flying the H-34 at the time. On 30 Oct. 1966 the squadron loaded aboard LPH Iwo Jima off the coast of Phu Bai; on 1 Nov 1966 the squadron offloaded from Iwo Jima to DaNang for the night and on 2 Nov. 1966 loaded aboard the Valley Forge; on 8 Nov. 1966 the squadron went ashore at MCAS Futenma, Okinawa where we remained until 16 Dec. 1966 when the squadron personnel were disbanded and the squadron returned to MCAF New River; almost all of us were sent, however, back to Vietnam to finish our tours.

The squadron call sign, until returning to the US, was BARRELHOUSE.

When I joined HMM-162 at MCAF New River in September, 1967, the callsign was HAIRCUT, and was flying the H-46.
