        "text": "The Universe as created by God has man and other spirits residing in it. Spirits are believed to be possessing and tormenting people and they can only be exorcised by the exorcists. The rate at in which exorcists blossom in carrying out their activities clearly posed a big challenge to doubt the genuine of sources of their power. Thus, the paper is concerned with unraveling a comparative analysis for a reflective rediscovery of genuine sources of power for exorcism in Africa Traditional Religion and Islam. The research made use of comparative, prescriptive and analytic methods. Data were collected from the field through selected interviews and consultation of relevant books. The paper discovered that, exorcists exaggerate their roles and exploit their clients in order to acquire quick material and social firm. They also worsen people’s health due to erroneous examination of non possession elements to means spiritual attacks. There is doubt been cast in most exorcists due to concealm...\n\nIn the Holy Bible, we are face with some evil creatures that are considered as enemies of God, Jesus Christ, and Christians. Perhaps, the most significant and tangible declaration of presence of these creatures is in possessing human beings, and on the other hand, the role of Jesus and his apostles in the expulsion of them. In this article, we have first dealt with the concept of possession and exorcism, then, exemplums and implications existing on this subject in the Old Testament and New Testament have been mentioned in detail, and the subject is thematically classified. And at last, a brief chronicle of exorcism in the history of the Christianity has been presented This query indicates that, unlike religions such as Islam, in which issues such as exorcism fit within the realm of the popular and informal religion, in Christianity, especially Catholicism, the approach towards this issue, in the normative religion and the popular religion, is intertwined, and it is almost impossible to separate them. In fact, exorcism is the junction, sharing point, and even the rivalry between the normative and the popular religion. Therefore, the Catholic Church insists on monopolizing the rituals associated with it.\n\nExorcism, a much valued, rational and sensible ministry as far as many African Christians are concerned, is frequently not appreciated in the West. This results from linguistic naivety, and the West’s concealment of their own religious history to undergird secular ideologies. Both African faith in God, and indigenous languages, must be taken seriously in Western scholarship. A case study considering the use of the term “spirit” in Western English (that is misappropriated into African discourse) graphically illustrates errors being made when considering deliverance ministries in African Christian churches. There is an urgent need to overcome linguistic naivety and secular hegemony in this regard. Careful exploration of the literature on gift-giving, in light of African people’s affinity for ministries of exorcism, reveals the means by which “material” and “spiritual” are, in Africa, not mutually exclusive.\n\nThere have been a lot of debates about whether witchcraft is real or is just based on superstition among African communities (Bond and Diane 2001:6, 7). Different scholars in the area of anthropology and philosophy who have studied the phenomenon have established varied views based on ethnographic studies they conducted among different African people groups over the years. Based on such studies, Bond and Diane suggest four positions that have been established by such scholars on witchcraft: These include: “[1] Witchcraft [beliefs] are real, [2] There are no witches, only the belief in them, [3] Witches may or may not be real, and further research may shed light on the issue, [4]. For the study of witchcraft the above positions are irrelevant” (Bond and Diane 2001:6). This divide has created a never-ending discussion about the reality of witchcraft manifestations among African communities. For instance, early anthropologists like Wilson (1951), Middleton (1960), and Marwick (1965) vi...\n\nThe subject of witchcraft accusations once used to be a major discourse all around the world; especially in Europe and its colonies in North America (Jennings 2015:1). During that era, which curiously continued through the period of the Enlightenment and the Reformation, notable men like Martin Luther and John Calvin are reported to have believed in the existence of witches and spoken forcefully in support of their extermination (Kors and Peters 2001:262-262). Indeed, Luther is reported to have stated concerning witches, “There is no compassion to be had for these women; I would burn all of them myself, according to the law, where it is said that priests began to stone criminals to death” (263). In the succeeding centuries this phenomenon was eclipsed by the success of the missionary endeavor, which resulted in Africa, Latin America, and Asia emerging as collaborators on the global mission stage. However, in recent times, the subject of Witchcraft accusations has again resurfaced on..."
