        "text": "Some scholars have rightly observed that the center of gravity of Christianity is shifting from the West to “the two-third world,” that is Asia, South America and Africa.1 The reasons for this shift are varied and complex. However, the reasons for the growth of Christianity in Africa significantly include the way the Africans have attempted to deal with their threatening fears, especially witchcraft. Witchcraft has been a prevailing belief in African cultures and has continually posed problems for the African people groups.\n\nThis paper attempts to address the current approach to healing among Ghanaian Pentecostal/Charismatic churches. It traces the origins of the approach to the Ghanaian traditional practices, links it with the African Initiated churches and demonstrates that its current position was strengthened by the impact of the ministries of some evangelists in Ghana. Since there are some major problems with the current approach, lessons are drawn from Jesus&#39;s healing methods in the gospel of Matthew for the Ghanaian situations.\n\nWhile an ideology of rupture is central to understanding Pentecostal Christianity in Ghana, not enough attention has been given to the moral relationships and ritual practices that help sustain a Pentecostal transformation and its situational application in different contexts. By comparing the experiences of members of the Church of Pentecost (CoP) in Ghana and London, I show how Pentecostal transformation provides church members with an ethical framework, that helps them cope with unhealthy relationships, witchcraft attacks, and migration, albeit differently. I argue that while promoting discontinuity, individuality, and positive change, Pentecostal trans- formation also raises concerns regarding continuity, communality, and negativity.\n\nThe book seeks to find ways to understand the Ghanaian belief in the activities of witchcraft and to quantify its impact on the socio-economic, religio-cultural and psychological development of Ghanaians. This book is based on research conducted by the Author to find out the effect of witchcraft belief on Ghanaian Society. The nine-chapter book would discuss the concept of witchcraft belief in Ghana, the acquisition of witchcraft and the living conditions of these accused witches in some selected witch camps in Ghana. The book also looks at the activities of witches and wizards from the Ghanaian perspective as well as the effects of their activities on the economy and social lives of the people. It finally discusses the biblical, anthropological and psychiatric perspectives of the belief and activities of witchcraft in Ghana."
