We have changed the title not only to better reflect the revised content of this edition but also to represent the expertise and interests of the voice of the new coauthor, Marie L. Radford. We owe a debt of gratitude to Ronald Powell for his vision as sole author of the first edition of this book, published in 1985, and subsequent updating in the second and third editions. He invited Lynn Silipigni Connaway to be his coauthor beginning with the fourth edition in 2004. Ron and Lynn collaborated on the fourth and fifth editions. Ron announced that he was stepping down for revision of the sixth edition, and Marie came on board. Previous editions of this book have had a strong focus on quantitative methods. Our collaboration on two major grant projects, beginning in 2005, has involved a blend of qualitative and quantitative research. We have had positive experiences in our collaboration during the past ten years and have been very productive in contributing to both the scholarly and professional literature. Our partnership provides a balanced view of research that embraces the entire spectrum of methods available in library and information science (LIS). In addition, we are excited to share our expertise and experiences in research design, data collection, analysis, the writing process, and dissemination of findings gained during our grant-­funded collaborations. We have designed this edition to feature more examples selected from research conducted by the authors and other LIS scholars. Approximately one-­third of the content of this edition is new. These changes include all original content in chapters 7 and 10, which are devoted to qualitative research methods and analysis. All the other chapters have been revised, including updates to the cited references, with an added emphasis on recent citations. Furthermore, this edition now provides practical strategies on topics\n\nxiii\n\nxiv Preface\n\nsuch as the writing process, overcoming writer’s block, time management, and strategies for collaboration. Discussions of technology enhancements for research have been updated, including a section on computer-­assisted software for qualitative data analysis. Also new to this edition are a series of text boxes and sidebars throughout the book, placed as appropriate to chapter topics. These include the following: • Voices of the Experts: researchers’ advice on particular methods, specifically what was most important or most valuable to them when using these methods. • Questions from LIS doctoral students, new faculty, and library professionals about research methods, answered by either the authors or other discipline-­specific experts. • Publish or Perish: expert research tips and strategies for increasing productivity. • Developing a Proposal: content and questions to be answered in theses, dissertations, or research projects. • Editors’ Advice: How to get work published in LIS journals and books. • Grant-­writing advice from experts and staff from granting agencies for writing more effective proposals. Specifically designed for LIS master’s and doctoral students, new LIS faculty, and professional librarians, this text explains both quantitative and qualitative research methods, with an emphasis on the power of their integration for a mixed method research design. It provides instruction and guidance to LIS scholars, professionals, and students who want and need to conduct research and publish their work. The inclusion of the principles, data collection techniques, and analyses of quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as discussion of the advantages and limitations of each method and updated bibliographies, provides a broad introduction to research design. The discussion of the scientific method, sampling, validity, reliability, and ethical concerns, along with experimental research design, ethnographic methods, and usability testing, offers a well-­rounded overview of these research methods and design. Not only will LIS students, scholars, and professionals consult the text for instruction on conducting research using this array of tools but they also will use it for guidance in critically reading and evaluating research publications, proposals, and reports. This text cannot be all-­inclusive, but it provides a broad view of the LIS research environment, with references to more in-­depth works on specific data collection and analysis methods. The authors would like to thank those colleagues who shared their expertise in writing short essays, text boxes and sidebars, and answers to questions from novice researchers. We also are indebted to Vanessa Kitzie and Stephanie Mikitish, doctoral candidates, and Matthew Bridgeman, MLIS student, all from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and Erin Hood of OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. for their assistance in the preparation of this revised edition. We appreciate the efforts of Paula Julien and Kem Lang at the OCLC library in providing quick access to requested materials, which greatly\n\nPreface xv\n\nhelped us to stay on target for deadlines. We also want to thank Blanche Woolls, Emma Bailey, and the staff at Libraries Unlimited, a subsidiary of ABC-­CLIO, for their editorial and production assistance. We are appreciative of our spouses, Jim and Gary, for their understanding of the time required to write this book. Their unconditional love, good humor, and vocal encouragement helped greatly to make this book a reality.\n\n1 Research and Librarianship\n\nINTRODUCTION Definition of Research When put on the spot and asked to define “research,” what would most people say? Many people in the library and information science (LIS) field may have naïve ideas or even misconceptions about the research process. Some of these misconceptions are grounded in the American system of undergraduate-­ and master’s-­level work, which regularly educates students to do a “research paper,” consisting of a literature review and discussion of a particular topic or issue. Usually these assignments are on topics students may not be particularly interested in, although if given a personal choice of focus, and if the student has sound writing ability, sometimes these reviews can become a joy rather than an onerous task. Views of what constitutes “research” are often shaped by students’ early efforts to search for, read, and summarize scholarly articles; work these into a coherent paper; and carefully cite them correctly. Master’s students delve more deeply into areas that are more relevant (and even exciting), but the “term paper” or “research paper” still is a standard assignment. Those educated in this system become accustomed to thinking of “search/synthesis” as being equal to “research.” Search does not equal research in the sense that is intended here. Those holding a master’s or doctoral degree in LIS, or in another subject area whose program’s curriculum offers a “research methods course,” will have a different idea of what research is, a more nuanced idea. This book may be an assigned text for such a course, or perhaps is being used as a refresher or primer for LIS practitioners who have not taken a research course (or at least not recently). This book is designed to be a comprehensive overview about research, in the sense of deep study of a particular phenomenon, in our\n\n1\n\n2 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\ncase, one that is related to the LIS field. It provides an overview of methods and theoretical foundations, as well as helpful resources for every stage of the research process. It also asserts that designing, conducting, and writing up research can be enjoyable and extremely satisfying, perhaps one of the most important and lasting contributions one can make as an LIS scholar and professional. Jaeger and Bertot wrote that much recent LIS scholarship has “examined various aspects of the difficulties faced by libraries driven by economic struggles and changing politics. While these are very practical real problems facing libraries, research in the field still can do a tremendous amount to help libraries navigate through the challenging waters in which they now find themselves.”1 They advocated stronger connections between research and practice and assert that libraries “truly need all of the help research can provide in terms of demonstrating their value, creating more effective services, using resources effectively, improving community outreach, advocating for support, providing inclusive services to their communities, and myriad other ways.”2 Of course research takes interest, knowledge, time, and effort. However, it definitely is worth the struggle and also can provide opportunities for adventure, discovery, and surprise that lead many to the conclusion that research can be pleasurable (dare we say fun?). Let’s start with the basics, considering research in the general sense. Merriam-­Webster Online Dictionary defined it as “studious inquiry or examination; especially: investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical applications of such new or revised theories or laws.”3 Cresswell defined research as “a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue,” and outlined three key steps, “1. Pose a question, 2. Collect data to answer the question, and 3. Present an answer to the question.”4 Mouly stated: “Research is best conceived as the process of arriving at dependable solutions to problems through the planned and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.”5 These general definitions suggest at least two major types of research, one of which is basic research. Also referred to as pure, theoretical, or scientific research, it primarily is interested in deriving new knowledge and is at most only indirectly involved with how that knowledge will be applied to specific, practical, or real problems. Or, as the American Association of University Professors stated, scientific research is “any activity designed to test a hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and thereby to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge expressed in theories, principles, and statements of relationships.”6 Basic research, particularly if quantitative in nature, usually is designed to produce new knowledge that is generalizable (meaning that the findings usually derived from a random and representative sample of cases have applicability to a larger population that the sample represents; more on this is found in chapter 6). The second major type of research is usually known as applied research, and it encompasses a variety of specific research techniques, such as systems analysis and operations research. In contrast to pure or basic research, applied research emphasizes the solving of specific problems in real situations. Much of the library‑related research has been applied research dealing with\n\nResearch and Librarianship 3\n\neverything from evaluating e-­collections, to assessment of reference services, to analyzing integrated library systems (ILS). (See chapter 12 for additional information on applied and action research.) But in spite of the fact that basic and applied research have tended to be done in isolation from one another, they are not necessarily dichotomous. As Shera noted, “Research is no less ‘pure’ for leading to useful results, though it most certainly does not have to possess immediate applicability to qualify as research.”7 In other words, basic research often leads to practical applications, while applied research frequently acts as a foundation for subsequent theoretical or basic research. Stokes also dismissed this dichotomous notion of the relationship between basic and applied research. When discussing Pasteur’s philosophy of research, Stokes described it as the integration of both basic research in his search for knowledge and applied research in his quest to solve practical problems.8 In addition to the distinctions described above, research can be further divided by type of method, usually seen as a dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative approaches, although this book takes the perspective that it is more of a continuum than a dichotomy. Quantitative research methods “use measurements and statistics to transform empirical data into numbers and to develop mathematical models that quantify behavior.”9 Qualitative research methods focus on observing events from the perspective of those involved and attempt to understand why individuals behave as they do. They involve “collection, analysis, and interpretation of interview, participant observation, and document data in order to understand and describe meanings, relationships and patterns.”10 Qualitative methods take a more naturalistic approach to the resolution of research problems, grounded in participant reports. Some research projects use a mixed methods approach (see Michelle Kazmer’s sidebar in chapter 2), including both quantitative and qualitative research methods to study and report behaviors and events. Mixed methods can complement one another and strengthen the research design by mitigating flaws or weaknesses that can be found in single-­method designs.11 The goal of this book is to provide you with a well-­stocked toolbox of methods to choose from, so quantitative methods are discussed in depth in chapters 3–6, and chapters 7–10 describe qualitative methods, with mixed methods being featured in chapter 2. Why is it important for LIS students, scholars, and professionals to become familiar with and well-­versed in research methods? Here are a few reasons to contemplate: • Understanding LIS research literature can improve library practice, management, and professional decision making.12 The American Library Association (ALA) promoted the need for the dissemination of research findings for support of professional practice and published “recommendations related to the effective dissemination of research.”13 • Increased research activity will lead to additional expansion and refinement of the profession’s theoretical underpinnings. Kumasi, Charbonneau, and Walster analyzed how theory was used in LIS research and recommend that theoretical application and development become more robust in published research articles.14\n\n4 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\n• Another benefit of having a reasonable mastery of basic research methods is that it should allow one to understand and critically evaluate the research reports of others. According to Swisher, “the reader who understands the process of research will question much more about the literature in general, and correctly identify the working limitations of the literature.”15 Some librarians, particularly special librarians, are expected to evaluate or screen research reports (i.e., serve as research intermediaries) for their clientele. • For those librarians who serve researchers, another reason to cultivate a basic knowledge of research methods is the greater understanding of scholars’ needs provided by this awareness. Only when the librarian knows the basic process a researcher utilizes can the researcher’s needs be fully anticipated and met. Or as Engle stated, “A thorough and continuing personal grounding in the experience of learning and research in an academic setting prepares us to join students and faculty in the creative act which bibliographic research can be.”16 In addition, the librarian’s status is likely to benefit from being knowledgeable about the researchers’ techniques and from being able to discuss them intelligently with his or her clientele. According to Clark, “An understanding of research can help improve the way in which librarians support researchers and encourage the use of small-­scale research projects to support their work.”17 • Perhaps most important among the benefits one could expect to realize from a study of research methods is gaining the ability to conduct research. For many librarians, especially in academic settings, research activities are not only desirable but a necessity. A number of academic institutions expect their professional librarians to meet the same requirements for promotion and tenure as do their regular teaching faculty, and these usually include research and publishing. If these librarians, and others, are to conduct the kind of rigorous research that they and their profession need, a thorough understanding of basic research methods is absolutely essential. • Research also can be both personally and professionally satisfying and enjoyable: “Work is play when it’s something you like.”18 McKnight asserted: “There are so many rewards for publishing! First, of course, is your personal feeling of accomplishment. You include your publications, not your submissions, on your resume and in your tenure material. Colleagues will read your work and carry on the conversation with their responses in person, or in print, citing your work. You can find your citations in major bibliographic databases. No one ever has to know how many reincarnations your manuscript had before it was published. The process often takes more time than expected, but if the subject really interests you and your co-­authors, you can enjoy the journey.”19 Hahn and Jaeger also listed additional personal rewards, including “gaining intellectual stimulation and fresh challenges—research is fun.”20 • An awareness of research methods and design also should prove helpful for those preparing proposals to obtain financial support for\n\nResearch and Librarianship 5\n\ntheir research activities (see also chapter 13). In addition, it has been pointed out that the study of research methods can improve one’s ability to think critically and analytically—competencies associated with leadership. A library’s involvement in research can even improve staff morale and enhance the library’s status in its community. • Recently there has been much discussion about evidence-­based research. This has been percolating in the K–12 and higher education literature for quite some time. Todd has been a leader in voicing the need for evidence-­based practice and research in school libraries.21 Evidence-­based decision making is another important focus within LIS, which requires collecting and analyzing relevant data to make informed decisions for services, policies, and so forth.22 It “incorporates a decision-­making framework based on the best available research evidence with professional knowing and experience to make professional decisions and take professional action, and to implement and continuously improve professional practice, as well as a framework for documenting evidence of outcomes.”23 Hernon and Schwartz proposed a managerial leadership research agenda that includes evidence-­ based decision making for assessing, evaluating, and managing.24 As stated by Bayley and McKibbon, two experts in the field of evidence-­ based decision making, “Many reasons exist to use research evidence in library practice. We need to make the most efficient and effective use of our services and resources, and research will help us plan and evaluate. We need to identify research evidence on which to base our funding proposals to ensure funding success and to produce usable evidence after completion of the process. We also must publish our findings both inside and outside librarianship to gain credibility.”25 Evidence-­based research and decision making is part of a larger movement that is overtaking libraries: the assessment imperative.\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT IMPERATIVE Sassen and Wahl referred to library assessment concerns as “hot button issues at campuses across the country.”26 Those concerned about the status of the LIS profession have commented on the need for more and better basic and applied research, which is seen as crucial for continued growth, especially in the current climate of budget tightening and the need for libraries to prove their worth. Connaway saw these realities as opportunities: “However, times of economic hardship can provide opportunity for libraries. Specifically, it can be an opportunity to assess current library services and systems and to develop new ones that better meet the needs of users and prospective users. . . . In order to accomplish this, LIS professionals must know how to assess the value and use of these services and systems.”27 The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) report Value of Academic Libraries stated: “Librarians are increasingly called upon to document and articulate the value of academic and research libraries and their contribution to institutional\n\n6 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\nmission and goals.”28 This reality is not only true for academic libraries but also increasingly for all types of libraries, and has resulted in a strong push for all types of assessment activities that “document and articulate” value for stakeholders and funders beyond the usual statistics to track quality.29 Library assessment can be defined as the process of defining, selecting, designing, collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and using information to increase service/program effectiveness.30 Assessment activities answer questions like the following: • • • • •\n\nWhat do users/stakeholders want and need? How can services/programs better meet needs? Is what we do working? Could we do better? What are problem areas?31\n\nAssessment can be formal or informal, and a research-­driven approach is necessary to underpin a formal assessment process. For an assessment to be recognized as valid and rigorous, it must use accepted quantitative and qualitative methods and be data driven and evidence based. Anecdotal, informal assessment, relying on casual observation and traditional data collection measures (e.g., use of statistics and gate counts), used to be the norm but is no longer adequate to show value. Output measures quantify the work done (e.g., number of books/e-­books circulated, number of articles downloaded, number of reference questions answered, and instruction or program attendance). However, by themselves, they do not holistically relate these factors to overall effectiveness. “Output measures suggest demand, performance efficiency, and customer satisfaction, but do not describe performance or identify the outcomes or benefits resulting from the use of library services and systems.”32 For example, a library can put on fifty programs in a year, but what is their quality? Are they on hot topics of interest to users? Input measures are counts and inventories of available resources (e.g., budget figures, numbers/ types of items/volumes in collections, amount of space, counts and types of equipment, and numbers of staff). These can be measured against standards but are not sufficient for overall assessment. For example, a library can have a large collection of books and other media, but how old is the collection? What condition are the items in? How accessible are they to users? One current trend that takes a different approach is to define and measure outcomes rather than inputs or outputs. These are defined as “the ways in which library users are changed as a result of their contact with the library’s resources and programs.”33 According to Kaufman and Watstein, “Libraries cannot demonstrate institutional value to maximum effect until they define outcomes of institutional relevance and then measure the degree to which they attain them.”34 An evolving assessment culture is driving all types of libraries to make a firm commitment to ongoing efforts to understand users and measure how well their needs are being met.35 Outcomes assessment centers on evaluating changes in service and resource use for clients. It uses a variety of methods to identify benchmarks, to discover best practices, and to corroborate\n\nResearch and Librarianship 7\n\nconclusions. It is best done as a continuous process, which need not address every aspect of service/collections, but can be focused on a small number of outcomes. Some examples of user-­centered outcomes are the following: • The user matches information need to information resources. • The user can organize an effective search strategy. • The user effectively searches the online catalog and retrieves relevant resources. • The user can find appropriate resources.36 Many academic libraries have included assessment activities as a major focus of their strategic plans and are seeking additional ways to measure impact and establish a clear connection between library activities and student/faculty success. One tool that enables a longitudinal comparison is LibQUAL+ (http://​www​.libqual​.org), which seeks to identify user needs and expectations, and reveal gaps in performance, as applied by Maciel37 and Kyrillidou, Cook, and Rao.38 Assessment takes dedicated human and budget resources and an ongoing effort. “Assessment takes time and effort to plan and a formal evaluation requires a financial investment from the organization. Formal assessment is data-­driven and evidence-­based and utilizes accepted research methods and data collection techniques. It is recognized as a rigorous, ongoing process.”39 Making the commitment is a difficult challenge; it is clear that librarians are busy with day-­to-­day work, and some feel that assessment can become another burden. Assessment tools involve research methods that are described in this book, including quantitative and qualitative methods such as analytics, survey research, interviews, focus group interviews, and structured observations.\n\nPublish or Perish: How to Boost Productivity Answered by authors What do experts recommend as practical suggestions for how to boost your research productivity? Research and writing can be enjoyable but also can be challenging. There are a multitude of responsibilities, ever-­ present and demanding deadlines, nonstop e-­mail, and numerous distractions that can keep us from writing. A book by Boice1 is highly recommended as one of the most useful resources on this topic. He offered ten suggestions for increasing research and writing productivity based on long years of research on publication productivity. Although this work is geared toward new academic faculty members, its content is highly relevant for library researchers. Here are Boice’s ten rules: 1. Wait (for inspiration, for the eureka moment, and curb impatience). “Waiting requires patience at holding back from impulsivity, rushing, and busyness.”2 2. Begin early (before you are ready). This can “foster early, informal beginnings at tasks we might rather avoid now and do under deadlines.”3\n\n8 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\n3. Work in brief regular sessions (do not wait until you have an entire day to write). Those who write in “brief, daily sessions write with less pain, with more productivity and quality, and with higher likelihood of acceptance in prestigious outlets.”4 4. Stop (pause). Boice recommends pausing at times for contemplation and reflection. Some people use a timer to interrupt for a five-­minute stretch every hour, if needed. Online tools, such as Workrave (http://​www​.workrave​.org) give frequent alerts to take breaks and has a restriction on daily time to help prevent Repetitive Strain Injury. Frequent breaks also prevent eyestrain. 5. Balance preliminaries with formal work. Boice recommends spending about the same amount of time on creating quick drafts and outlines as on actual writing. 6. Moderate overattachment and overreaction. Share drafts early and often. Seek and welcome editing suggestions. 7. Moderate negative thoughts (e.g., “This project is too big”; “I’m behind deadline”; “I will never get this done!”). Negative thinking is depressing and discouraging.5 8. Moderate emotions. Those who “work with constancy and moderation: Evidence unmistakable superiority in producing manuscript pages . . . [and] report more ease, satisfaction, and joyfulness.”6 9. Let others do some of the work. Boice7 argues that productivity is boosted for those who are not afraid to ask for help. He says pride usually stops us from asking for help and/or collaboration. 10. Limit wasted effort. Boice8 asserts that failure can come when one is on the brink of success, so take care that you pay attention to the follow-­through and finishing of projects.\n\nNotes 1.

Advice for Increasing Productivity Answered by authors Here are an additional ten recommendations for librarians and researchers wishing to boost productivity: 1. Be open to ideas (read publications and regularly attend research presentations). One question that aspiring researchers often ask is: “How do I find a topic for my research?” If you are fortunate, you may have a “burning question” that you want to answer/explore, but you also may struggle to figure out a research focus. Research ideas can be found by reading professional journals; by attending talks, conferences,\n\nResearch and Librarianship 9\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nand symposia that feature research; and in discussions with colleagues and friends. Review articles also can be helpful, such as one by Aharony,1 who conducted a content analysis of articles from the top ten LIS journals and compiled a list of the ten most frequently found key words. Published research agendas such as the one by Pomerantz2 on chat-­based reference service also offer research questions. Another approach is to browse online conference programs from related organizations, such as ACRL,3 the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE),4 the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T),5 the Library Research Seminar (LRS),6 and the ALA,7 to see what topics of interest are popular. Put first things first (prioritize). Time management wizard Stephen Covey8 suggested that we need to know what our priorities are. Once we have decided our top priorities, he argued that we schedule and commit our time for tasks like research and writing, which are not urgent but are important. Otherwise they become lost in the daily grind. Find your rhythm (What works for you?). So, if you are to schedule and commit time for writing, when and where does this work for you? Only you know if you are most productive in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Can you commit to writing for short periods of time every day? Or longer stretches twice a week? Are you able to work at home, or is a cybercafe or coffeehouse more conducive to your writing? Finding what works for you is essential to writing success. Synergize (work-­research connection; multipurposing your reports, newsletter articles, etc.). You may already have worked on several reports, projects, or class assignments that could be written up for publication. Ivins9 provided tips in her article “Upcycling Masters of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLS) Coursework into Publishable Content.” She noted that “new librarians can more rapidly generate publishable material by exploiting a rich mine of their own high-­quality writing: their MSLS coursework.”10 Your existing papers can be important starting points for research projects or can perhaps be inspirations for topics you want to pursue in more depth. Synergizing also takes the form of having one thing work for more than one purpose. For example, an assessment report of an information literacy pilot project (or program) at your library can be worked into a conference presentation and then into a paper for publication. Work to your strengths and interest (focus and enjoyment). Since you are going to be making an effort across a span of time to conduct research and write it up for presentation or publication, it makes sense that your topic should enable you to work to your strengths and both capture and sustain your interest. From our personal experience, if a topic for a writing project is not engaging, the time spent on it can be excruciatingly painful. If, on the other hand, the project is one that catches and holds attention, the piece can feel like it is writing itself. Knowing and playing to your strengths is equally important (e.g., you are gregarious and like to engage with people, so interviews and focus groups would be enjoyable; or you prefer to work in solitary, so perhaps surveys or work with big data sets would be more conducive to your style). Break the task into incremental steps (baby steps). Writing a journal article, research report, book, or dissertation can seem daunting, but any large project can be broken down into small steps. Sometimes getting started is the most difficult part, so starting with an outline is one way to work. Then you can select one part of the outline to work on. Suppose you decide to start by doing a literature review. This could be done in three steps: finding, reading plus note taking, and writing. First, devote several hours to searching the databases for pertinent articles and downloading these. The next day a goal could be to sort and read the ones that looked most interesting, taking notes as you go along. When all the articles have been read, you can draft\n\n10 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\na few paragraphs summarizing this work that will go into the literature review. Cited references from these articles may lead to more reading. 7. Set target dates (your personal deadlines). Setting target dates goes along with breaking the work into steps. If you have a firm deadline (e.g., for a conference paper submission), you can work backward from that date to set incremental targets for yourself. The tighter the deadline, the more important it is to have incremental target dates. In addition, if you are working collaboratively, you will have to have your assigned work done in ample time for your collaborator to read and revise it before submission. 8. Create a plan (get specific). Covey recommended “beginning with the end in mind.”11 Thinking through an entire research project is a way to get a good handle on your ultimate goal. The plan should have an overview of the timeline for the project, with specific steps and target dates. If you are working with a collaborator(s), tracking who will be responsible for what is important. Applications for grant projects can require a detailed timeline of activities tied to budget.12 9. Capture ideas (keep a writing notebook). One important way to bolster productivity is to keep track of your ideas. Many researchers keep a writing or research notebook in which they record incremental steps and target dates and due dates from calls for papers. This notebook also could be used to jot down ideas for your current project, or for future projects, so you do not lose them. A spiral notebook can be used, or you may prefer to use an online Word document or app (such as Evernote). 10. Find time! Sharpen your time management skills.

What resources do I have to overcome these barriers? What articles, topics, or books do I want to write? How could I organize myself to write more? What specific steps would I have to take in order to have more time to write?\n\nOther tips on overcoming writer’s block: • Do something routine (like checking references) and try again later. • Do something else (take a walk! or a shower!) and try again later. • Put your shoes on, if you previously were writing barefoot (this has benefits for some people). • Stop in the middle of a sentence next time; this technique helps some people get going again. • Use a carrot (a latte if you finish xyz) or a stick (no latte until you finish xyz).\n\nGETTING PUBLISHED It is never too soon to start thinking about publishing venues for the research at hand. Hahn and Jaeger assert that deciding “where to publish should not be left until you are done writing, as the intended outlet will shape the tone, length, audience, formatting, and focus of the piece.”40 They believe that the most important consideration about where to publish is the type of audience that one desires to reach, be it professionals, researchers, or a broader readership. Among scholarly journals they recommend: Library Quarterly, Journal of Academic Librarianship, portal, and College & Research Libraries. Practitioner-­oriented journals include Library Hi Tech, Information Technology and Libraries, and Journal of Library Administration. Professional magazines include American Libraries, Library Journal, and College & Research Libraries News.41 Hahn and Jaeger also provide a useful table of categories of publications, presentations, and service that build a publication record, which includes highly competitive and less competitive publications, unpublished presentations (such as conference papers and keynote addresses) and support/service/recognition (such as journal editing, editorial board membership, and book reviewing).42 It is worth mentioning here that considering highly competitive outlets for publishing usually involves a potentially long review cycle of blind peer review, which will involve rounds of revision on the author’s part. The result, however, is of higher quality and will be likely to have greater impact. For these journals, it is worthwhile to e-­mail the editor before\n\n12 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\nsubmission, to start a conversation about the work and to test the water to see if the piece to be submitted fits within the desired content. Perusing several issues of target journals also is important to get a sense of topics, length, tone, and type and frequency of citations. One pathway might be to start with a submission to a conference. Calls for papers come out months ahead of the event, and only may request an abstract, not a completed study. In this case, it is possible to project what can be accomplished by the conference date and write this up. The Librarian and Research Knowledge Space (LARKS) Web site includes a list of links to which to submit a research proposal for ALA conferences and meetings here (http://​ www​.ala​.org​/research​/larks​/present​-­­publish). This page also has aggregated information and links to publication opportunities in the top library journals. Several publications provide advice on getting published for librarians.43 McKnight recommends having multiple projects in the pipeline at once: “If you want to be prolific, use the convoy approach. At any given time have different projects at different stages. If one project has a breakdown that requires repairs or gets bumped back a few months, the others keep moving on. While you are always browsing and musing about professional issues, you can also be proposing a new piece of research, doing the research for something you have proposed, writing the draft about something else and responding to reviewers’ suggestions in the revision of a manuscript from an even earlier project. There will always be delays and wrong turns, but with several projects in process, they won’t be complete roadblocks to your productivity.”44 Another important way to increase productivity is through collaboration, which is explored below.\n\nCollaboration Working collaboratively with others can enable one researcher to draw on the strengths of others who may have complementary skills. Aharony45 finds that there is a growing tendency toward collaboration in articles published in the top LIS journals. Nall and Gustavson,46 as well as Lamothe,47 recommend collaboration to increase output quantity and quality. It is vitally important to choose collaborators wisely, since not everyone has similar ideas about expected norms for shared work. Often successful collaborations can result in multiple projects, presentations, and publications. Recognizing when collaboration is unsuccessful is best done at the beginning of a project, before both people have invested significant time and energy. It is highly recommended that an open and frank discussion about authorship and expectations (who will be lead author, who will do what and when) be held as soon as possible, and that there be clear understandings of roles, responsibilities, and deadlines. Once these deadlines have been set, one advantage that collaboration offers is that these deadlines with others become imperatives that hold one accountable. Disappointing or letting down others is a formidable reason to keep to deadlines. Janes asserts that collaboration yields better results than working as a single author and recommends increasing the amount of collaboration with teams that include academics and practicing librarians: “When our professional and scholarly communities come together\n\nResearch and Librarianship 13\n\nand understand each other and each other’s perspectives, the results of that research can be even more powerful in both venues.”48 Due to recent developments in technology, collaboration is no longer limited to those you are in close proximity to (including coworkers, colleagues, and classmates). Technical innovation has increasingly enabled teams of researchers in LIS to work effectively together regardless of their locations and time zones.49 According to Monzani, Ripoll, Pieró, and Van Dick: “Virtual work has become an increasingly central practice for the organization of the 21st century. While effective virtual workgroups can create synergies that boost innovation and performance, ineffective workgroups become a great burden.”50 A number of scholars in the LIS and communication fields have examined the role of virtual teams. Sonnenwald, Lassi, Olson, Ponti, and Axelsson found that virtual research environments (VRE) in LIS have several unique characteristics that offer opportunities to heighten research, education, and practice within the discipline.51 Kelly studied geographically dispersed teams of information specialists and provides insights into management issues, along with practical strategies for success.52 Similarly, Weimann, Pollock, Scott, and Brown provide recommendations for avoiding problems and ensuring greater effectiveness for virtual research teams.53 Knecht discusses the pros and cons of using virtual teams within libraries.54 Communication issues, including the development of personal relationships, have been found to be important to the success of virtual teams, according to Pauleen and Yoong, whose qualitative research found that some online channels are more effective in building these relationships.55 Bradley, Baur, Banford, and Postlethwaite found that the participation of “agreeable” members positively affects virtual team cohesion and communication.56 Monzani and colleagues warned that working virtually in teams over a long period of time, but infrequently participating in face-­to-­face (FtF) meetings, can have a negative effect, including development of perceptions of “loafing.”57 Yilmaz and Peña suggest that interpersonal communication dynamics can go wrong in virtual teams in instances when “in-­groups” and “out-­groups” form or when a teammate behaves negatively.58 They apply social identity models and social information processing theory in research with sixty-­four participants, divided into teams of four via a live chat platform. Shachaf and Hara assert that virtuality increases the complexity of relationships within the global virtual team environment (see also Karpova, Correia, and Baran).59 According to Scott, “Team members separated by time, distance, and culture often struggle with issues of trust, conflict, and potentially divisive subgroups. With global virtual teams becoming increasingly common in organizations, it is important to understand how to minimize such interactional difficulties.”60 Alavi and Tiwana have identified four major challenges within virtual team environments regarding knowledge integration, especially centering on contextual knowledge and difficulties in achieving mutual understanding. Performance also can be seriously affected by technical issues, including bandwidth and Internet availability.61 Connaway, Dooley, Houghton, Massie, and O’Neill provided a literature review on “distributed working” within a nonprofit organization, Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC), and discussed the benefits, challenges, and best practices for teams that are not colocated.62\n\n14 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\nRegardless of whether you collaborate with someone within your institution who is down the hall from you, or with someone across the country or the world, collaboration will enable you to accomplish more in the same amount of time. The next section discusses additional ways to leverage your time for greater research productivity.\n\nTime Management One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome for professional librarians, library students, and scholars alike is finding the time to think, do the research, and (most difficult of all) write. In a study of practices of Association of Research Libraries (ARL) member institutions, Smigielski, Laning, and Daniels found that one of the most important mechanisms to support publication and research for librarians is “protected time,”63 which includes dedicated work time/release time and sabbaticals. They note: “Librarians report difficulties in finding time for research and writing or having to resort to doing this work on their personal time, given the institutional needs that pressure them.”64 Sassen and Wahl confirm this finding and also call for more research into administrative support for research, asserting that few studies have investigated this issue. They provide an overview of the research that has been done and find that formal and informal mentoring also is important for productivity.65 Lee’s book, Mentoring in the Library: Building for the Future, provides an in-­ depth overview of recommended mentoring models and benefits.66 Fennewald studied librarians at Penn State and found that a significant factor in publication productivity was: “collegial support conveyed in formal and informal mentoring. . . . Suggestions for possible publications, leads to publications, willingness to collaborate reflected a well-­established camaraderie achieved among librarians engaged in research.” Furthermore, those lacking confidence found this culture to be supported. “As one librarian said: ‘No one indicated that [research] would be easy, but everyone indicated that it was doable and that they had every confidence that I would be able to do it.’ ” Besides a supportive environment and mentoring, other factors he found to be important to publication productivity were requirement for tenure and promotion, personal motivation, and formal research training.67 One suggestion for academic librarians, if you are in an institution that has release time for research, is to spend some time finding out about the process and talk to people who have been successful in obtaining time (generally one day per week for a semester, or a block of time that is to be devoted to research activities). If there is a faculty committee that makes the decisions on applications, volunteer to be on the committee so you can gain a better idea of what makes for a successful application, to inform your future submissions. Cabanac and Hartley68 write that protecting personal time and work-­life balance may be getting more difficult to achieve. In their study of Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIS&T) authors and editors, they found a rising trend for writing and editing activity on the weekends, indicating an expansion of the five-­day workweek for scholars. Sassen and Wahl agree: “Additionally, it may be time for university administrators to\n\nResearch and Librarianship 15\n\nconsider the applicability of research being done at their institutions on the impact of long work hours on workers, their families, their employers, and their communities with respect to their librarians and faculty.”69 Oud conducted a survey of librarians with three years of experience or fewer and found that time management and workload management were among the hardest things to learn in the academic setting.70 There are numerous articles and books on strategies for managing time for librarians.71 Technology is a boon as well as a challenge for time management. One often-­reported time trap for librarians and academics is e-­mail. Two suggestions for managing e-­mail are to (1) work on your top priority for fifteen to thirty minutes before opening e-­mail and (2) checking e-­mail at specified times, rather than continually, and setting a time limit. Technology also can offer some help with time management Web sites and mobile apps, which are becoming more abundant. Fourie and Fourie72 present a useful and extensive table of Web sites with addresses and descriptions, including task managers, to-­do ­lists, task-­tracking sites, collaboration aids, time management analytics tools, and brainstorming or idea generators. A good thing about time management efforts is that often just a bit of thought and small actions (such as finding a great app or taking a few minutes every day to prioritize work) can have a major impact.\n\nTop Time Management Tips for Social Media Answered by authors For some, social media has become a time sink. Here are some tips and tactics for managing your Facebook, Twitter, Tumbler, Pinterest, and other proclivities:1 • Get into a routine. Incorporate social media into your daily routine, such as checking your favorite site during your morning coffee. Having a routine will allow you to show up on sites consistently instead of spending three hours trying to catch up on what you missed and posting all at once. • Use mobile apps. The next time you are waiting at the airport or the doctor’s office, apps will allow you to check up on social media during time you otherwise would have lost. • Set a time limit. It is easy to get distracted by social media, so set a time limit for yourself for when you have to get on and off. Put in the amount of time you are comfortable with, but do not let it take over your life. Apps like Anti-­social (anti​-­­social​ .cc) can help. • Use a time tracker. Commercial trackers such as Rescue Time (www​.rescuetime​.com) or Time Doctor (www​.timedoctor​.com) track the amount of time you spend on various tasks—social media sites, work, online shopping, video watching, and so forth—giving you an accurate look at how you spend your time on your computer or mobile device. Plus, they are programmable to your needs and can send you notifications if you are spending too much time on these tasks. • Let automated tools assist you. There are plenty of tools available to help you schedule posts on various social media sites ahead of time. Use these to post at high-­traffic times when your post is more likely to be seen by others, rather than all at once.\n\n16 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\n• Know what you are good at and what you enjoy the most (which are often the same). Then, spend about 60 percent or more of your allotted social media time on that activity instead of wasting time on several social media sites that do not quite click with you. • Turn off notifications. Do not have your computer or phone ping every time you have a notification on a social media site. These notifications will interrupt you and decrease your overall productivity. • Find the right blend. Do not just stick to one activity (although you can have a primary one). Instead, experiment a little and find a good blend of publishing, sharing, and interacting on a few different social media sites. Do not spread yourself too thin, but do not put all your eggs in one basket, either. • Take a break. You do not always need to be on social media. Schedule periods of time when you are completely offline. Taking a step back can do wonders for your stress level.\n\nNote 1.

According to Connaway: These include reduced funding opportunities because of more restricted national, international, and federal research initiatives; difficulty of articulating the scholarly value of the research based on a theoretical framework; not making the connection between the implications of research results and findings to the practical profession of LIS; limited relationships with scholars and research in other disciplines; the communication of research and outputs to traditional dissemination channels such as scholarly and professional presentations and publications and limited utilization of blogs, social media, and webinars; and inconsistent quality of the research data collection methods and analysis.73\n\nThese challenges are indeed numerous and represent a long list of grievances many have had with LIS research in the past. The past research record for LIS is not exemplary.74 It has been easier to find criticism than praise of library research. Zweizig called for improvements in research methodologies,\n\nResearch and Librarianship 17\n\nespecially as they relate to users of library services.75 Busha and Harter stated that “a large proportion of librarianship’s research has been uneven in quality and demonstrably weak methodologically.”76 Shaughnessy has been even more critical, contending that traditionally the field has permitted much of what is not actually research to be called research.77 Cuadra identified shortcomings in the purpose of LIS research. He noted “a failure to ask the right questions and to establish a proper theoretical foundation for later research or application.”78 More recently, Julien, Pecoskie, and Reed conducted a content analysis of information behavior research and found that there still is a gap between the quality and quantity of research published by practitioners and academic faculty. However, they also discovered signs of improvement, including “an increasingly interdisciplinarity reflected in the information behavior research literature. This suggests a maturing field and may encourage scholars in the area to expand their explorations of literature outside LIS for relevant work and theory.”79\n\nResearch Methods in Library and Information Science What are the most used methods in LIS? This chapter highlights relatively recent record of trends in library research. Readers wishing to learn more about the history of library science research may want to consult Jackson’s brief history of research in librarianship in the United States and Canada80 or Busha’s review of the past status of library science research.81 According to Shera, Ralph Beals once categorized library literature into the tripartite classification of “Glad Tidings,” “Testimony,” and “Research,” and noted that there was little of the last.82 Goldhor, in his text on library research, proclaimed that it features one, a relatively small body of published research as defined in the narrow sense; two, a larger amount of published and unpublished services studies, or applied research; three, an even larger number of reports or descriptions of specific situations, or simply opinions; and four, original data.83 Most library‑related research prior to the 1980s has been characterized as applied in nature.84 In the early 1990s Losee and Worley stated: “There is a tendency among information professionals to write and publish in the ‘How I done it good’ genre, a genre that is very situation-­specific.”85 Bao analyzed the articles published in College & Research Libraries (C&RL) and the Journal of Academic Librarianship (JAL) between 1990 and 1999.86 The majority of the refereed articles addressed collections, services, staffing, and the Internet, indicating that some of the major research areas identified by the College Library Section of ACRL had not been studied by the authors included in the sample. Similarly, Hildreth and Aytac examined 206 randomly selected articles in twenty-­three LIS journals published between 2003 and 2005 using thirty-­five factors, such as authorship, topic, type of research, and data collection method. They concluded that “there is little difference in the quality and organization” between the published reports of practitioner and academic research. Not surprisingly, “practitioners conduct more library-­specific studies and academics conduct more use and user studies.”87 The authors confirmed that qualitative\n\n18 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\nresearch methods are being used but found that the numbers of such studies have “leveled off,” and they express concern about library practitioners’ limited use of qualitative research methods.88 Hider and Pymm analyzed journals within and outside of librarianship published in 2005 to identify the strategies and data collection techniques used in research-­related articles. They found that the survey was the most-­used strategy (30.5 percent) for all journals examined, and “the leading technique was questionnaire/interview” (32.5 percent). Experimental design (20.8 percent) was the second most-­used technique, and content analysis was “the only other specific technique with more than 10 percent.”89 Historical research only was very low (1.2 percent) and showed a “marked decline” when compared with the results reported for 1975 and 1985 by Järvelin and Vakkari90 and Kumpulainen.91 Thirty-­two percent of all the journals reported no empirical research (these were discussions and theoretical papers), and there was no significant difference between the librarianship and nonlibrarianship journals. In the 1985 analysis, 55.9 percent of the articles reported no empirical research, which may indicate that discussion and theoretical papers were less likely to be published in 2005. Hider and Pymm reported that “qualitative approaches including case studies and ethnography are now well established.” Bibliometrics still are “valuable tools of investigation,” and “the largely quantitative technique of transaction log analysis has grown rapidly to become a major instrument.” Approximately 26 percent of the articles in the librarianship journals used both quantitative and qualitative analyses, while 12.2 percent of the articles in the nonlibrarianship journals used both analyses.92 More recently, Julien, Pecoskie, and Reed reviewed 749 articles indexed in Library Literature and Information Science Full-­text from 1999 to 2008 and discovered that for information behavior research, the questionnaire was the most-­used method, followed by interviews, with nearly one-­third using mixed methods. Questionnaires and interviews were dropping in overall numbers but still very popular.93 Chu studied 1,162 articles from top tier LIS publications, including Journal of Documentation, JASIS&T, and Library & Information Research, from 2001 to 2010, and concluded that researchers no longer are limited to traditional approaches. She concluded: “The LIS field is maturing in terms of research method selection and application in that a greater number and wider variety of research methods are used in all the research publications this study examines. All the methods reported in the 1162 scholarly publications in a sense constitute a toolbox of research methods. Scholars are no longer limited to the research methods traditionally applied in LIS explorations (e.g., questionnaire and historical method). Researchers can instead choose research methods from this expanded toolbox according to their study objectives.”94 Research by Luo and McKinney reviewed research methods in the Journal of Academic Librarianship and found that questionnaires were by far the first choice of those publishing in that journal, being the largest proportion of the research methods used (47.6 percent), followed by content analysis (27.2 percent), with semistructured interviews in third place (14 percent).95 Recent work by Greifeneder examined JASIS&T, Information Research, Journal of Documentation, and the iConference Proceedings, with years varying by\n\nResearch and Librarianship 19\n\njournal, but all between 2012 and 2014. She discovered that the most-­often-­ used methods were, in order of frequency, interviews, surveys, and content analysis. These results echoed those of Luo and McKinney. Interestingly, Greifeneder found that nearly half of the published studies used a combination of mixed methods or a minimum of two methods; however, there were no instances of combined qualitative and quantitative methods.96\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE As Busha noted, past weaknesses of library‑related research can at least partially be explained by the fact that “research in librarianship is still relatively young. Clear conceptions of the goals, objectives, and methodologies of library science research are only now beginning to be solidly formulated.”97 It does appear clear, however, that it is becoming more and more “necessary to use the methodology of other disciplines—in particular, those of sociology, psychology, economics, linguistics, history—and to employ more generally applicable methodologies” to study the many problems facing librarianship today.98 Wiegand calls for the integration of a variety of scholarship and methodological approaches from outside of LIS to avoid continuation of a narrow perspective that has pervaded the field.99 But who is going to be qualified to conduct the kinds of research needed, how will he or she be educated, and how will practitioners be equipped to read and utilize this research? Shera provided at least one answer to these questions when he wrote, “Research is too important to be left to dilettantes and amateurs, and its pursuit should be reserved for those who are qualified for it by aptitude, education, and motivation.”100 Education appears to be one key to solving the problem. Not only can education provide the basic skills needed for conducting research, but it can help to shape attitudes and increase motivation. Logically, the major responsibility for imparting research skills to librarians must belong to the LIS education programs. As Shera pointed out, a specific part of the course of study for a graduate student in librarianship should be the acquiring of a “knowledge of the principles and methods of research as applied to the investigation of library problems, together with the ability to evaluate research results, especially research in librarianship.”101 And as Muller wrote, “Students should learn to appreciate the contribution of research and be urged to rid themselves of the notion that research is something esoteric, remote, or impractical.”102 Yet most students view LIS programs as primarily concerned with providing professional skills, not academic training,103 and “too few practitioners have education in the research or knowledge creating process.”104 Only 47 percent of the practitioners responding to a survey conducted in 2000 reported that they had taken a course on research methods at the master’s degree level, and 59 percent of them reported that their master’s degree programs had not adequately prepared them to conduct research.105 The track record of LIS programs regarding the teaching of research skills is not outstanding.106 O’Connor and Park reported that a research methods\n\n20 Research Methods in Library and Information Science\n\ncourse was not required in 38.5 percent of ALA accredited LIS programs and that “only half of the twenty-­four top-­rated programs required Master of Library Science (MLS) students to take research methods.”107 In 2003 Hernon and Schwartz referred to this as a crisis that should not be allowed to continue,108 but four years later they still had to conclude that graduates of LIS programs “might emerge with little or no understanding of the research process and how to gather and interpret evidence related to accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, or continuous quality improvement in programs and services.”109 Dimitroff found that special librarians identified the following as the top barriers to their involvement in research activities: the lack of management support for research, the lack of money/funding for research, the lack of personal interest in research, an insecurity of research skills, and a lack of research ideas.110 However, LIS programs do not have the entire responsibility for educating competent researchers. It also is the responsibility of professional associations and, in some cases, research organizations, to provide appropriate continuing education opportunities. If libraries and other employers expect librarians to equip themselves to do research, then they must be prepared to provide appropriate incentives, support, and rewards. For example, release time, special leaves, and sabbaticals can be arranged to allow more time for research. Administrative support can be provided through salary increases, in‑house training, and financial and clerical support for research projects.111 Relevant courses such as those in statistical analysis can be taken in departments outside the LIS program when desirable or necessary. Ultimately, of course, it is the responsibility of the would‑be researcher to take advantage of continuing education and staff development programs and to commit to a substantial program of self‑study. A statement made by Goldhor almost four decades ago still rings true: “Librarianship today is particularly in need of the generalized truths which scientific research is designed to uncover.”112 The research problems will ultimately direct the methodologies employed, which justifies the sustained development of research theories and models as described by Glazier and Grover in their multidisciplinary framework for theory building.113 If we are to realize the professional growth needed by the field of LIS, “Our attention must increasingly be devoted to research which is more basic and less applied.”114 “We must all raise our expectations and challenge the profession to value and use research.”115 Fortunately, there are promising signs. In an editorial in Research Strategies, the authors stated that “a new strain of thought has sprung up in the field of librarianship . . . an interest on the part of practicing librarians in conducting serious research.”116 The professional associations continue to establish more and more units concerned with research. As of 2009–2010, ALA’s Research and Statistics Assembly had twenty-­three member units. At the annual conferences of the ALA, a considerable number of programs and committee meetings deal directly with research and statistics. Both ACRL and the ALA Library Research Round Table (LRRT) have established research mentoring programs to help members with various aspects of the research process. ALA’s Committee on Research and Statistics (CORS) is charged with promoting research to answer questions about library services.\n\nResearch and Librarianship 21\n\nThe creation and dissemination of research is central to the vision statement of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T). The vision of the society includes the following: “Advancing knowledge about information, its creation, properties, and use; Providing analysis of ideas, practices, and technologies; Valuing theory, research, applications, and service; Nurturing new perspectives, interests, and ideas; and Increasing public awareness of the information sciences and technologies and their benefits to society.”117 McClure and Bishop asked twenty-­three leading researchers in LIS about the status of research in the field.118 They concluded that it had improved somewhat in the 1980s and expressed “guarded optimism” about the future status of research in LIS. At least two studies indicated that the number of published research articles is increasing (though there is some evidence that the proportion "
