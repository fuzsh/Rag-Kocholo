Both the bimonthly supplement and the annual cumulation are compiled from catalogues and acquisitions lists of existing libraries in Ghana, but the majority of the items are based on materials received under the Book and Newspaper Registration Act (Act 73) of 1961.\n\nThe bibliography includes everything about Ghana (no matter where published) and everything by Ghanaians. The adoption of the ISBD has resulted in international recognition of the bibliography."
