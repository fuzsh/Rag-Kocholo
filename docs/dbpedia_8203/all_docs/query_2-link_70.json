        "text": "Looking for L-Tryptophan API 73-22-3?\n\nDescription:\n\nHere you will find a list of producers, manufacturers and distributors of L-Tryptophan. You can filter on certificates such as GMP, FDA, CEP, Written Confirmation and more. Send inquiries for free and get in direct contact with the supplier of your choice.\n\nAPI | Excipient name:\n\nL-Tryptophan\n\nSynonyms:\n\nL-beta-3-Indolylalanine , L-Tryptophan , Trp , Tryptophan , W\n\nCas Number:\n\n73-22-3\n\nDrugBank number:\n\nDB00150\n\nUnique Ingredient Identifier:\n\n8DUH1N11BX\n\nAbout L-Tryptophan\n\nWhy are people looking for Tryptophan? An essential amino acid that is necessary for normal growth in infants and for nitrogen balance in adults. It is a precursor of indole alkaloids in plants. It is a precursor of serotonin (hence its use as an antidepressant and sleep aid). It can be a precursor to niacin, albeit inefficiently, in mammals.\n\nYou can ask the supplier about all relevant certificates for the product such as CoA, Safety Data Sheet and DMF.\n\nL-Tryptophan is a type of Amino acids\n\nAmino acids are an essential category of pharmaceutical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. These organic compounds are the building blocks of proteins and play a crucial role in various biological processes. With their increasing popularity and therapeutic potential, amino acids have become a focus of research and development in drug discovery.\n\nAmino acids can be classified into two main categories: essential and non-essential. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from dietary sources or through pharmaceutical supplementation. Non-essential amino acids, on the other hand, can be synthesized by the body itself.\n\nPharmaceutical-grade amino acids are produced through a variety of methods, including extraction from natural sources, fermentation, and chemical synthesis. They undergo rigorous quality control procedures to ensure purity, efficacy, and safety. The most common amino acids used as APIs include lysine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, among others.\n\nAmino acids have diverse applications in the pharmaceutical industry. They are widely used as ingredients in parenteral nutrition formulations, where they provide essential nutrients to patients who cannot consume food orally. Additionally, amino acids are utilized in the development of protein-based drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins. These pharmaceutical proteins often require specific amino acid sequences to achieve desired therapeutic effects.\n\nIn conclusion, amino acids are a vital category of pharmaceutical APIs, playing a significant role in protein synthesis, nutrition, and the development of protein-based drugs. With their extensive applications and growing demand, amino acids continue to contribute to advancements in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nL-Tryptophan manufacturers | traders | suppliers\n\nWe have 5 companies offering L-Tryptophan produced in 2 different countries.\n\nGet in contact with the supplier of your choice:\n\nSenova Technology Co., Ltd. from China, product country of origin China\n\nTianjin Tianyao from China, product country of origin China\n\nAmino GmbH from Germany, product country of origin Unknown\n\nAjinomoto from Japan, product country of origin Unknown\n\nWuhan Amino Acid Bio-Chemical Co Ltd from China, product country of origin China\n\nLet the supplier know whether you are looking for a product with a specific monograph such as EP (Ph. Eur.), USP, JP, BP or another quality. Or, whether you are looking for hydrochloride (HCl), anhydricum, base, micronisatum or a specific purity."
