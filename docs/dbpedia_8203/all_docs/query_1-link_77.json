        "text": "San Diego, CA /PRNewswire/ - Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (\"Aji Bio-Pharma\"), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing services, today announced it will soon open a high speed multi-purpose fill finish line in its state-of-the-art commercial manufacturing facility located in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe new fill line offers a range of configurations, including prefilled syringes, cartridges and vials, utilizing ready-to-use components, which minimize component preparation and packaging. Along with the line, the fill suite houses two formulation suites, one of which is capable of handling flammable (class H) compounds.\n\nThe fully contained and integrated OPTIMA line uses SKAN isolated barrier technology to ensure the required sterility for fill finish, while offering flexibility to meet cGMP clinical and commercial drug product manufacturing needs. The high-speed process is rated to move 22,000 syringes per hour through the line, with a batch capacity of over 200 thousand syringes. In addition, it has been designed to meet FDA and EMEA commercial compliance.\n\n\"This expansion provides a significant increase in our current aseptic fill/finish capacity and allows for additional scheduling flexibility, as well as component flexibility,\" says Paul Ruther, Director, Drug Product Manufacturing, Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services. \"Our continued investment in increasing capacity further enhances Aji Bio-Pharma's commitment in being a leading global and quality-driven CDMO with comprehensive service offerings.\"\n\nThe line will become fully operational in the summer 2021."
