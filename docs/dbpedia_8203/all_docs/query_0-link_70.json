        "text": "The large doses of sodium glutamate required for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy may result in dangerous alkalosis and hypokalemia ... important to keep close control on the electrolyte balance during therapy.\n\nReynolds, J.E.F., Prasad, A.B. (eds.) Martindale-The Extra Pharmacopoeia. 28th ed. London: The Pharmaceutical Press, 1982., p. 59\n\nInjections of sodium glutamate should be given with caution to patients with hepatic cirrhosis, impaired renal function, or liver disease not associated with hyperammonemia.\n\nReynolds, J.E.F., Prasad, A.B. (eds.) Martindale-The Extra Pharmacopoeia. 28th ed. London: The Pharmaceutical Press, 1982., p. 59\n\nFood and Environmental Agents: Effect on Breast-Feeding: Monosodium glutamate: None. /from Table 7/\n\nReport of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs in Pediatrics 93 (1): 142 (1994)\n\nGlutamate is absorbed from the gut by an active transport system specific for amino acids. This process is saturable, can be competitively inhibited, and is dependent on sodium ion concentration... . During intestinal absorption, a large proportion of glutamic acid is transaminated and consequently alanine levels in portal blood are elevated. If large amounts of glutamate are ingested, portal glutamate levels increase ... . This elevation results in increased hepatic metabolism of glutamate, leading to release of glucose, lactate, glutamine, and other amino acids, into systemic circulation ... . The pharmacokinetics of glutamate depend on whether it is free or incorporated into protein, and on the presence of other food components. Digestion of protein in the intestinal lumen and at the brush border produces a mixture of small peptides and amino acids; di-and tri-peptides may enter the absorptive cells where intracellular hydrolysis may occur, liberating further amino acids. Defects are known in both amino acid and peptide transport ... .. Glutamic acid in dietary protein, together with endogenous protein secreted into the gut, is digested to free amino acids and small peptides, both of which are absorbed into mucosal cells where peptides are hydrolyzed to free amino acids and some of the glutamate is metabolized. Excess glutamate and other amino acids appear in portal blood. As a consequence of the rapid metabolism of glutamate in intestinal mucosal cells and in the liver, systemic plasma levels are low, even after ingestion of large amounts of dietary protein. /Glutamic acid/\n\nWHO Food Additive Series 22; L-Glutamic Acid and its Ammonium, Calcium, Monosodium and Potassium Salts. Available from, as of March 20, 2007: https://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v22je12.htm\n\n... Intestinal and hepatic metabolism results in elevation of levels in systemic circulation only after extremely high doses given by gavage (>30mg/kg body weight). Ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) was not associated with elevated levels in maternal milk, and glutamate did not readily pass the placental barrier. Human infants metabolized glutamate similarly to adults.\n\nPMID:10736380 Walker R and Lupien JR; J Nutr 130 (4S Suppl): 1049S-52S (2000)\n\nOral administration of pharmacologically high doses of glutamate results in elevated plasma levels. The peak plasma glutamate levels are both dose and concentration dependent ... . When the same dose (1 g/kg b.w.) of monosodium glutamate (MSG) was administered by gavage in aqueous solution to neonatal rats, increasing the concentration from 2% to 10% caused a five-fold increase in the plasma area under curve; similar results were observed in mice ... . Conversely, when MSG (1.5 g/kg b.w.) was administered to 43-day-old mice by gavage at varying concentrations of 2 to 20% w/v, no correlation could be established between plasma levels and concentration ...\n\nWHO Food Additive Series 22; L-Glutamic Acid and its Ammonium, Calcium, Monosodium and Potassium Salts. Available from, as of March 20, 2007: https://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v22je12.htm\n\nAdministration of a standard dose of 1 g/kg b.w. MSG by gavage as a 10% w/v solution resulted in a marked increase of plasma glutamate in all species studied. Peak plasma glutamate levels were lowest in adult monkeys (6 times fasting levels) and highest in mice (12-35 times fasting levels). Age-related differences between neonates and adults were observed; in mice and rats, peak plasma levels and area under curve were higher in infants than in adults while in guinea pigs the converse was observed.\n\nWHO Food Additive Series 22; L-Glutamic Acid and its Ammonium, Calcium, Monosodium and Potassium Salts.
