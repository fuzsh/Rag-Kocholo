        "text": "TheracosBio recently received FDA approval for Brenzavvy™ (bexagliflozin), an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor\n\nPiramal supported TheracosBio with starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and oral solid dosage formulation\n\nIntegrated drug development & manufacturing program involved multiple Piramal sites in India and Europe\n\nMumbai /PRNewswire/ - Piramal Pharma Solutions, a patient-centric Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) and part of Piramal Pharma Ltd (PPL), (NSE: PPLPHARMA) (BSE: 543635), today announced that the company has completed the successful integrated development and manufacturing of drug substance and drug product for Brenzavvy™ (bexagliflozin), TheracosBio's recently approved treatment for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Brenzavvy, an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in January 2023. The FDA approval is based on results from a clinical program that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Brenzavvy in 23 clinical trials enrolling more than 5,000 participants.\n\nPiramal Pharma Solutions and TheracosBio began their bexagliflozin partnership at Piramal's Ahmedabad, India site, where the manufacturing process for the tablet form was first established. Next, the project shifted to the Morpeth, UK site for manufacture of the actual pill. The relationship grew from there, with Piramal's site in Ennore, India producing the regulatory starting materials and its Digwal, India site producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n\n\"The recent FDA approval represents a significant milestone for TheracosBio and provides an important treatment option to patients who suffer from type 2 diabetes. We are extremely pleased with the work the Piramal team has done to help make the approval possible,\" said Albert R. Collinson, Ph.D., President and CEO of TheracosBio. \"During the course of this program, we have developed an extensive relationship with Piramal. Working with different managers in different countries on various elements of the manufacturing process has turned out well.\"\n\nAccording to Peter DeYoung, Chief Executive Officer, Piramal Global Pharma, \"Our partnership with TheracosBio is an important example of how an integrated services offering can benefit a client. This program has been extensive, crossing continents over years of development. We're pleased that we've been able to support their needs every step of the way. We are very proud of the work we have done and we congratulate TheracosBio on reaching this important milestone.\"\n\nAbout Piramal Pharma Solutions:\n\nPiramal Pharma Solutions (PPS) is a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) offering end-to-end development and manufacturing solutions across the drug life cycle.
