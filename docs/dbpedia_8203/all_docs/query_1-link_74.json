        "text": "Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services recently broke ground on a new 8,500-square-meter (91,493 square feet) facility in Visakhapatnam, India. Construction on the site, which reportedly will add 60 new jobs, is expected to be completed mid-2022.\n\nJB Agnus, Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services’ vice president of sales, told Outsourcing-Pharma that the expansion will enable the company to boost production levels at the site.\n\n“The new small molecule manufacturing facility doubles the production capacity at the site to 310 m3 for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates and has dedicated equipment to manage OEB 4 high potency ingredients​,” Agnus said. “Further, the site has completed renovations on existing laboratory space to support additional R&D activities​.”\n\n“This site expansion allows us to optimize API production capacity across all sites, while delivering high-quality and cost-effective small-molecule manufacturing services to our customers,​” Agnus added.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved site (designed, constructed and managed based on the company’s GMP operating standards and quality systems) reportedly has successfully supported leading biopharmaceutical companies since its formation in 2011\n\n“We are very excited to be investing in this additional production capacity to continue delivering high quality, cost-effective small molecule manufacturing services for our customers​,” said K.V.V. Raju, head of site operations and CEO for Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma India Pvt. Ltd. “This expansion exemplifies our commitment to our vision statement of being a leading, trusted, innovative partner to our clients and our people​.”\n\nPeter Stuyck, senior vice president and head of European operations for Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services said the increased capacity at the Indian site will create a broader array of options for small-molecule customers.\n\n“This expansion optimizes capacity across all locations and further enhances Aji Bio-Pharma’s commitment in being a leading global and quality-driven CDMO with comprehensive service offerings​,” Stuyck said.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the pharma manufacturing industry, Angus told us the company is positioned to handle upcoming challenges.\n\n“The main change we have made to our operations is to introduce the AJILITY program to support flexible capacity to meet demand of COVID-19 and other programs that need fast-tracking to clinical trials​,” he said. “With increased business coming as these types of programs increase in number, we expect these operational changes can support the demand that may be placed on manufacturing operations​.”"
