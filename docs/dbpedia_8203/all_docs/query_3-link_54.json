        "text": "Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient CDMO Market Size\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient CDMO Market size was valued at USD 101.4 billion in 2023 and is growing at a CAGR of 6.6% between 2024 and 2032, driven by factors such as the rising prevalence of chronic disease such as cancer, cardiovascular disease diabetes and various other related disease that fuels the demand for novel drug therapies.\n\nTo get key market trends\n\nDownload Free Sample\n\nFor instance, as per the report published by International Diabetes Federation in 2021, it has been reported that, 537 million adults (20-79 years) are living with diabetes. This number is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. In addition, 541 million adults have Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), which places them at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic disease globally is expected to increase the demand for CDMO services for the development of novel drug therapies that propel the growth of the market in upcoming years.\n\nAPI CDMO are companies that specialize in providing services related to the development, manufacturing, and regulatory support of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). These organizations typically work with pharmaceutical companies that outsource these aspects of drug development and production, allowing them to focus on other areas of their business such as research, marketing, and distribution.\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient CDMO Market Trends\n\nThe rise in the demand and approval for generic drugs is one of the major factors that boost the growth of the market. Also, countries such as China and India are hotspots for developing and manufacturing generic drugs. For instance, as per the report published by Food and Drug Administration in 2023, a generic drug program by the U.S. FDA Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) approved 90 first generic medicines.\n\nIn addition, a generic drug costs 30% to 90% less than branded drugs because the cost and time required from developing to commercializing novel drugs are high. Therefore, the increasing demand for generic drugs worldwide, fueled by the expiration of patents on branded drugs, is driving the need for cost-effective API manufacturing that is expected to boost the market growth.\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient CDMO Market Analysis\n\nBased on the product, the global market is classified into chemical APIs, biological APIs, and high potent APIs. The chemical APIs segment dominated the market with revenue of USD 60 billion in 2023.\n\nThe rise in the prevalence of chronic disease, growing number of research and development activities by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies coupled with adoption of chemical synthetic APIs are some of the factors that boost the growth of the market.\n\nMoreover, the market demand is expected to be driven by the increasing tendency of major pharmaceutical companies outsourcing, especially in traditional contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMO) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API).\n\nBased on the indication, the global active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is classified into oncology, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hormonal disorders, infectious diseases, and other indications. The oncology segment dominated the market with market share of 28.3% in 2023.\n\nThe increase in prevalence of cancer cases globally is the major factor that raises the demand for novel cancer drug therapies. Also, continuous advancements in oncology research and drug development lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and molecules. This creates opportunities for API CDMOs to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the development and manufacturing of these innovative oncology drugs.\n\nBased on drug, the active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is classified into branded and generic. The branded segment is expected to exhibit 6.9% CAGR between 2024 - 2032.\n\nThe factors such as an increase in the number of U.S. FDA approvals for new molecular entities and an increased focus on research and development, are driving the growth of this segment.\n\nAlso, the extensive research & development activities have resulted in a pipeline that will likely contain many distinct compounds and be introduced throughout the projection period. Thus, widespread usage of APIs in the pipeline will spur the market growth during the analysis period.\n\nBased on workflow, the active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is classified into clinical and commercial. The commercial segment is expected to reach 108.4 billion by 2032.\n\nThe demand for CDMO operations producing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is rising globally due to rising rates of chronic disease and mortality. This continuous rise will advance in manufacturing technologies such as continuous manufacturing, process optimization, and automation to improve the efficiency and quality of API production, thereby driving the demand for CDMO services.\n\nFurthermore, it is expected that growing investments in research and development (R&D) aimed at improving API production techniques will fuel the growth of the market.\n\nBased on application, the active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is classified into human and veterinary applications. The human application segment is expected to exhibit 6.7% CAGR between 2024 to 2032.\n\nAs the incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes continues to rise globally, there's a growing demand for APIs used in the treatment of these conditions. Also, pharmaceutical companies are diversifying their supply chains and seeking cost-effective manufacturing solutions globally. Therefore, CDMOs offering competitive pricing, high-quality products, and reliable delivery timelines are favored partners for human API production, thereby augmenting the market growth.\n\nBased on end-use, the active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is classified into pharmaceutical & biotech companies, and academic & research institutes. The pharmaceutical & biotech companiesâ€™ segment accounted for USD 69.5 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 125.3 billion by end of 2032.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are increasingly outsourcing their API manufacturing processes to specialized CDMOs to focus on their core competencies such as drug discovery and marketing.\n\nMoreover, the various advantages offered by CDMO services such as regulatory compliance, customization and flexibility and cost reduction are the major factors that most of the pharmaceutical companies preferred to outsource the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process. Such advantages associated with outsourcing APIs will propel the growth of the market.\n\nThe active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market in U.S. is expected to exhibit 6.8% CAGR to reach USD 65.9 billion by 2032.\n\nThe rise in the demand for specialty & biologic drugs that often require complex manufacturing processes and expertise in API production, driving the need for specialized API CDMO services in U.S.\n\nAlso, the pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. strive to optimize manufacturing costs and achieve operational excellence to remain competitive in the global market. Outsourcing API production to CDMOs can help companies access specialized expertise and infrastructure while reducing overhead costs associated with in-house manufacturing.\n\nThus, aforementioned factors along with presence of prevalent population is expected to accelerate the market growth.\n\nGermany to experience the highest growth rate in the market, outstripping other countries in Europe in the assessment period.\n\nPharmaceutical companies in Germany increasingly outsource API manufacturing to CDMOs to optimize costs, mitigate risks, and focus on core competencies. This trend fuels the growth of the API CDMO market in Germany, as companies seek reliable and experienced partners for API development and production.\n\nThe Asia Pacific active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO market is expected to grow with a significant CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period.\n\nAsia Pacific boasts a large pool of skilled scientists, engineers, and technicians with expertise in chemical synthesis, process development, and analytical testing.
