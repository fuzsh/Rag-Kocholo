Harnesses Amino Acid Power to Improve Sleep\n\nGlysomâ¢, Ajinomoto Co., Inc.'s Nutraceutical Sleep Solution, Featured at Sleep 2011\n\nFORT LEE, N.J., May 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Ajinomoto Food Ingredients announced that Ajinomoto Co., Inc., a leader in the development of pharmaceutical-quality amino acids and safe, effective nutraceutical solutions, will showcase Glysomâ¢ (www.glysom.com) during Sleep 2011, the 25th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies to be held in Minneapolis, June 11-15, 2011.\n\nGlysomâ¢ is the latest breakthrough in amino acid and sleep research. Made from glycine, an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body, Glysomâ¢ is scientifically proven to promote deeper, sounder and more satisfying sleep for occasional sleeplessness without morning drowsiness.* Developed by a team of Ajinomoto Co., Inc. scientists led by Dr. Makoto Bannai, one of the foremost authorities on glycine and its applications to sleep, Glysomâ¢ is particularly effective in promoting the deep, non-REM sleep crucial to feeling refreshed and restored in the morning.*\n\n\"Since not all sleep is created equal, it's not enough to simply increase the number of hours at sleep,\" said Brendan Naulty, president of Ajinomoto Food Ingredients. \"Glysomâ¢ zeroes in on sleep quality, inducing the healthy deep sleep critical to optimal well-being.\"\n\nGlycine, the amino acid that is produced naturally in the body and present in many healthy foods such as fish, meat and bean, has been extensively researched. Dr. Bannai has led glycine research at Ajinomoto Co., Inc. since 2005. In the past decade, he has authored or co-authored over 20 studies examining various mechanisms of improving sleep and the critical connection between glycine and enhanced sleep quality and daytime performance. Among Dr. Bannai's key findings are an early appearance of slow wave sleep (SWS) and the reduction of deep (core) body temperature in early phases of sleep after glycine ingestion, all indicators of improved sleep quality.\n\nIntroduced in the US in May 2010, Glysomâ¢ is available exclusively through medical professionals. In the year since its introduction, approximately 70 medical establishments nationwide have begun recommending Glysomâ¢ to patients who experience occasional sleeplessness.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC), insufficient sleep is a public health epidemic, with an estimated 50-70 million US adults having difficulties with sleep or wakefulness.\n\nIn addition to Glysomâ¢, Ajinomoto Food Ingredients' safe, effective nutraceutical solutions include Capsiate NaturaÂ®, a patented, side effect-free dietary supplement with natural capsinoids shown to boost the body's metabolism*; and Natura Guard BPâ¢, a milk protein-derived nutraceutical to help maintain healthy blood pressure levels already within the normal range*. These products are backed by rigorous clinical studies and are available exclusively through medical professionals.
