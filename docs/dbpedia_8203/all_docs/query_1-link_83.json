        "text": "Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services, a biopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing services provider, announced in an Oct. 6, 2020 press release that the US FDA has approved the first commercial drug manufactured using the company’s proprietary Ajiphase production process. This proprietary synthesis technology was originally developed for peptide synthesis and has expanded to include oligonucleotide production.\n\n\"We are excited to be able to provide this drug to our partner and support them in their efforts to supply a lifesaving therapeutic,\" said Wataru Kurosawa, manager, Ajiphase Group, Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services, in the press release.\n\nThe Ajiphase platform is a hybrid of traditional solid-phase and solution-phase synthesis that uses an anchor in place of a resin for the development and manufacture of high quality and purity commercial quantities of oligonucleotides and peptides. The technology is highly scalable (µg to 200 kg). Compared to traditional solid-phase synthesis, the technology uses less solvents and reagents."
