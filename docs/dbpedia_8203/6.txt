Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (Aji Bio-Pharma), a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for biopharmaceutical drug products, announced the launch of Ajility, which is a flexible and agile drug product manufacturing platform that is designed to advance vaccines and therapies to market by minimizing time to production, the company said in a June 30, 2020 press release.

The platform is designed for novel therapeutics or vaccines and existing drug products with a new indication that can be used in COVID-19 trials, FDA Emergency Use Authorizations, or other programs. The goal of the platform is to minimize variables during tech transfer, manufacturing, and shipping processes.

"The AJILITY platform offers flexibility and time savings, which is an enormous boost for those clients with drug products that need to get to clinical trials quickly," said Dustin Campbell, associate director of commercial operations at Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services, in the press release.
