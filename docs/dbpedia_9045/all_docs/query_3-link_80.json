        "text": "Regular fundraisers\n\nSpirit Table: We sell Krispy Kreme Donuts and a variety of DSF spirit items at home football games.\n\nBrunswick Stew: The stew sale is the Boosters' signature fall fundraiser, usually occurring in October. More information will be posted on this site as the date approaches.\n\nRhythm & Brew Coffee: In 2019, we partnered with Two Labs Coffee, owned by a DSF grad. Coffee will be available through online ordering with set pick-up times.\n\nFreeman Band Boosters Mission\n\nThe Douglas Freeman Band Booster organization operates solely to support instrumental music students at DSF -- both band and orchestra -- and the Color Guard. The Boosters raise money to support expenses not covered by Freeman High School or the Henrico County Public School System. Band Booster fundraising benefits every participating student through the purchase of items such as musical instruments and repairs, equipment, sheet music, district assessments, uniforms, field show designs, and all costs associated with competitions, football games, and performances. Booster members assist the band director in the supervision of students and the logistics of competitions and performances. The Boosters are a valuable resource and aid to the success of your student's music program: participation from all parents/guardians is essential.\n\nPay fees by clicking on the DONATE button. Use the drop-down list and select PAY FEES.\n\nContributions are the Boosters' BEST FUNDRAISER. 100% percent of your contribution goes to the band's operating budget. The DSF Band Boosters is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, so your contribution is fully tax-deductible. Contributors will be noted in our programs for the Winter and Spring concerts. Donations are accepted online at the link on this site; choose Donation in the pull-down menu. Donations can also be made by mailing a check to Freeman High School at 8701 Three Chopt Road, Richmond, VA, 23229.\n\nBoosters also benefits from partnerships with Kroger and Amazon.\n\nKroger Card: Register online at www.krogercommunityrewards.com. Sign in with your card (free from Kroger customer service) and designate DSF HS Band Boosters as the beneficiary. Our organization number is 84908. Scan your card every time you shop! Once registered, Boosters will receive a percentage of all your Kroger purchases."
