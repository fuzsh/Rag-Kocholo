        "text": "Born with five fingers (no thumb) on his right hand, Brian Freeman developed and honed a unique flatpick/ fingerpick guitar style that is at-once blazing, at-once tender and always melodic. The solid rhythms and intricate melodies beautifully compliment his rich, warm vocals and fit his Celtic and original material like a well-worn glove.\n\nBrian has been performing folk music for the better part of forty years, primarily throughout the Northwest and California with occasional tours in Scotland, England and the New England regions. Traveling to Scotland 30 years ago to explore his family roots exposed him to the music of his heritage and soul, and he’s been performing it ever since.\n\nPraised as an accomplished instrumentalist, passionate singer and compelling storyteller, Brian sings songs that leave audiences feeling like they have just had a conversation with a good friend.\n\nBrian has shared the stage with many of folk music’s top performers including The Battlefield Band, Doc Watson, The Kingston Trio, John Renbourn, Pentangle, Norton Buffalo and Holly Near to name a few."
