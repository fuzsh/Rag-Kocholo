        "text": "Raised in Kansas and Texas, Tricia’s earliest memories of music go back to her mother’s love of jazz and blues, flooding the house with the likes of Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and her favorite, Dinah Washington.\n\nTricia Lives the Songs She Sings\n\nShe has toured Europe from Finland to Germany several times, with different line ups, performing songs from her own CDs and a blend of cover tunes that she makes completely her own with her bold original sound, that can only come from living the songs she sings.\n\nMovies, TV, and Janis Joplin\n\nHer studio work has brought her performance credits in 3 movies from Disney, Time Warner, and Indigo Films. She also appeared on the television show, “Your Big Break”, paying tribute to Janis Joplin.\n\nClassic Rock and Blues on Stage\n\nBesides Walter Trout, Tricia has also shared the stage with the likes of Spencer Davis, The Little River Band, Olivia Newton John, Missing Persons, Eric Burdon and The Animals, Eddie Money and in 2007, she opened for Al Green & John Fogarty at the Doheny Blues Festival in Dana Point, California.\n\nTricia is The Real Thing\n\nThis singer/songwriter puts on a great show, no matter what size the venue or the audience. You will always get the real thing with Tricia Freeman."
