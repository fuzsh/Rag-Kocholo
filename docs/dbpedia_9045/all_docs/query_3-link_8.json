        "text": "Raised on a Range of Music Styles\n\nRaised in Kansas and Texas, Tricia’s earliest memories of music go back to her mother’s love of jazz and blues, flooding the house with the likes of Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and her favorite, Dinah Washington. Her father loved it all, from the Latin American to classical. As she started developing her own taste in music, she began to lean more to the local country/bluegrass sound mixed with a rockin’ blues flavor that was prevalent in her college town of Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nSelf-Taught Blues Dynamo\n\nShe made the big move to California at the age of 19 and immediately bought a guitar and a “how to” chord book. The rest just came naturally, from singing those country / blues songs at the local saloons, to performing in the stage production of “Godspell”, to performing at all sizes of venues, from local taverns to major festivals up & down the coast.\n\nTricia Lives the Songs She Sings\n\nShe has toured Europe from Finland to Germany several times, with different line ups, performing songs from her own CDs and a blend of cover tunes that she makes completely her own with her bold original sound, that can only come from living the songs she sings.\n\nMovies, TV, and Janis Joplin\n\nHer studio work has brought her performance credits in 3 movies from Disney, Time Warner, and Indigo Films. She also appeared on the television show, “Your Big Break”, paying tribute to Janis Joplin.\n\nFrom Backup Vocals to Santana\n\nTricia traveled to Memphis several times to sing back up vocals on 2 CD’s of Walter Trout, the amazing blues guitarist from “Canned Heat”. While there, she worked with producer Jim Gains of Santana fame, as well as many other bands.\n\nClassic Rock and Blues on Stage\n\nBesides Walter Trout, Tricia has also shared the stage with the likes of Spencer Davis, The Little River Band, Olivia Newton John, Missing Persons, Eric Burdon and The Animals, Eddie Money and in 2007, she opened for Al Green & John Fogarty at the Doheny Blues Festival in Dana Point, California.\n\nThe “Bette Midler Appeal”\n\nMs. Freeman has a bold, humorous stage presence that will have you rolling with laughter between songs. This is why being compared to Janis Joplin, Stevie Nicks, Linda Ronstad, and Melissa Etheridge, among others, has been “trumped” with other fan’s and critic’s opinions that she is much more like the multi-talented Bette Midler. Indeed, Ms. Freeman has that “Midler” appeal.\n\nTricia is The Real Thing\n\nThis singer/songwriter puts on a great show, no matter what size the venue or the audience. You will always get the real thing with Tricia Freeman."
