        "text": "Tickets are $29+fees\n\nChildren 12 and under do not require a ticket and are free to attend.\n\nMuch more than just another tribute … Bruce In The USA is a high-energy, note-perfect, and visually accur-musical experience of a Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band show.\n\nMatt Ryan, from the World Famous “Legends In Concert” cast, began playing the Springsteen character in 2000, in Legends “full scale” Las Vegas show. The great success in the famous Las Vegas show brought him to performances across the world, eventually evolving his character into the Bruce In The USA show.\n\nThe Bruce In The USA Band consists of seasoned world-class professional musicians. The show has hosted musicians from such acts/bands as Queen/Paul Rogers, Meatloaf, Blue Oyster Cult, Hall and Oats, Joe Cocker, The Ojays, Aretha Franklin, David Cassidy, The Temptations, Slash and so many more.\n\nThis high-end, powerhouse, band has taken this genre of performance art to a whole new level, making it the World’s No. 1 Tribute to the E Street Band’s musical legacy.\n\nTo millions of die-hard fans around the world, it’s Springsteen’s marathon, party-like performances that have elevated him to hero status. Bruce’s legendary concerts (in the largest arenas) sell out within hours of their announced sale. For those even lucky enough to get a ticket, there was nothing that could fill the aching void in between Bruce’s long-awaited tours — until now!\n\nThe Bruce In The USA show was born on the Las Vegas Strip in the winter of 2004, with its debut at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino, in the majestic “V Theatre.” The show assaulted the senses in a fun-filled and exciting party atmosphere on the Vegas Strip while suspending disbelief for even the toughest skeptics. They’ve been met with critical acclaim, from the Stone Pony, large theaters, and Performance Art Centers across the country, as well as corporate events spanning across the globe for over a decade. Sell-out crowds are on their feet from the first song to the last.\n\nConnect with the Artist"
