        "text": "Benjamin Britten\n\nBenjamin Britten, (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976). 2013 was the centenary of his birth in Lowestoft to a dentist father and an amateur musician mother. Britten was educated at Old Buckenham Hall School in Suffolk and in 1927 he began private lessons in music that would be the beginning of his world-famous musical career.\n\nIn 1947 he and his partner Peter Pears founded the Aldeburgh Festival, an English arts festival devoted mainly to classical music. In 1976 Britten accepted a life peerage as Baron Britten of Aldeburgh but he died of heart failure soon after at his house in Aldeburgh, and is buried in the churchyard of St. Peter and St. Paul’s Church. The Red House in Aldeburgh, where Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears lived and worked together for almost thirty years, is now the home of the Britten-Pears Foundation which promotes their musical legacy.\n\nBob Hoskins\n\nBob Hoskins, 1942 – 2014, – well known and award-winning actor, Bob Hoskins, was famous for playing a great variety of roles in many films over a long period (his acting career began in the 1960’s and lasted until close to his death). He was particularly known for playing tough, Cockney gangsters – but was actually born in Bury St Edmunds in 1942! His mother was evacuated to Suffolk from London as a result of the heavy bombings, and the Hoskins family left Bury while Bob was just a baby. Star of The Long Good Friday, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and many more, he was diagnosed with Parkinsons disease and retired in 2012.\n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey\n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey (approx. 1471-1475 – 29 November 1530) – this historical political figure and Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church was born in Ipswich and attended Ipswich School. Wolsey came into great power as King Henry VIII’s chief adviser, and held Henry’s confidence until the King decided to seek an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn. Wolsey’s failure to secure the annulment is widely perceived to have directly caused his downfall and arrest. In 1529, Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property and accused of treason. Wolsey fell ill and died just before his hearing on 29 November 1530. See the Thomas Wolsey statue on our Heart of Ipswich trail.\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nEd Sheeran is a singer-songwriter who is currently signed to Asylum / Atlantic Records.

However, all hope of peace is soon shattered by murder. On his initial journey, the detective stops at Blythburgh church and enters ‘the cold silvery whiteness of one of the loveliest church interiors in Suffolk’. Covehithe is the setting for Death in Holy Orders, and in The Children of Men, a novel set in the future, Southwold is the centre for the compulsory suicide of the old! P. D.

It was one winter in 2004, when the couple were having lunch in a pub after one of their walks on the gusty beach, that she was spotted by Steve Sharp, the marketing executive for Marks & Spencer….the rest, they say is history. Read our guide to Southwold here.\n\nHe had the immediate idea of using her in the well-regarded M&S campaign. Twiggy says, “I’m very happy I went to that pub. It’s funny, when I think of all the times I’ve been to meet someone about a job, and worried about what to wear, and got changed a million times. And then there I am that day in Southwold in my woolly hat and anorak, and Steve spots me. It just shows, doesn’t it?”."
