The play was Waiting for Godot and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIn 1974 Peter made a film based loosely upon the book ‘Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village’ by Ronald Blythe. The book has been described as a work of rural realism and is based in East Anglia. The author himself appeared in the film, as did Sir Peter Halls’s father, and all other parts are played by real-life villagers who improvised their own dialogue.\n\nBenjamin Britten was expected to write the music for the film as a fellow Suffolk resident (see below), but unfortunately, he was unwell, so it fell to Michael Tippett, also from East Anglia, who produced his Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli which contributed significantly to the popularity of the film.\n\nBig fan of performing arts?

Covehithe is the setting for Death in Holy Orders, and in The Children of Men, a novel set in the future, Southwold is the centre for the compulsory suicide of the old! P. D.
