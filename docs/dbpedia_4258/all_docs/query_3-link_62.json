        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Benedict Nightingale frequently reports on cultural events in London. BY BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE\n\nLONDON\n\nIn Britain, Bob Hoskins is used to being a household - well, you can't quite say face, because that round head, squat body and stumpy legs are all essential to the total, inimitable effect. ''Five-footsix cubic,'' he calls himself, and five-foot-six cubic he is - a chunky, human bullet made of gristle and bone, and, since he played the sleazy sheet-music salesman in the original television version of ''Pennies From Heaven'' four years ago, well enough known to his fellow Londoners to be regularly accosted in park, subway and street. His fame has spread overseas as well - ''The Long Good Friday'' is playing in American film houses, and his most recent television venture, ''Flickers,'' is currently being shown on public television.\n\nMr. Hoskins's earthy, ebullient image helps, too. He's the local boy made good, an ordinary bloke with Falstaffian charisma: smaller than average, yet larger than life, and somehow the more approachable for being so. ''People behave as if they've known me for years,'' he said. ''A geezer came up to me the other day and said, 'Look, you've gotta talk to my Maureen. She don't listen to me, she'll listen to you.' Well, I was prepared to talk to Maureen, but then he suddenly realized he didn't actually know me, and got embarrassed and went away.''\n\nMr. Hoskins enjoys telling stories like that, especially if he's sitting in a pub at the time, and especially if that pub is in what he calls his ''manor,'' meaning Holloway and Finsbury Park, a mainly working-class stretch of northeast London. Indeed, he readily admits to enjoying most of the things he does. He enjoys the theater (''It's my religion''); he enjoys his fellow actors (''A real performance is as much a shock to the system as a minor road accident, and when I see some old guy acting his socks off, I'm proud to be in the same profession''); he enjoys being on stage or screen himself (''When it's really flying up there, really cracking between you, it's the most thrilling relationship in the world'').\n\nHe enjoyed New York when he visited it recently: ''Like the East End, only with taller buildings.'' And he most certainly enjoys the American success brought him by the film ''The Long Good Friday,'' in which he is a London gang leader, and the television series ''Flickers,'' in which he plays an aspiring entrepreneur in the embryonic movie industry of 1910: ''Yeah, here I am, sitting in a boozer in north London, and at this very moment in New York and L.A., people are talking about me. Me!''\n\n''Me'' looked destined for disaster a mere 15 years ago. At age 25 he was, he says, a bum and a drifter, ''totally, absolutely lost - everybody said I'd end up on the gallows.'' What happened next is already something of a legend. He was downing double whiskies in the bar of an amateur playhouse when someone mistakenly shoved a script into his hand, declaring, ''You're next''; he found himself blearily auditioning for the lead in the next production (''It was a yob, it was me''), got the part, and was seen by a theatrical agent; within weeks he was in professional out-of-town rep, and within three years was at London's prestigious Royal Court, playing a 40-minute scene in Charles Wood's ''Veterans'' with John Gielgud.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
