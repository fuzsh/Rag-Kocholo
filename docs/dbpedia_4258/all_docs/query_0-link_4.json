        "text": "By Mark Duell and Lizzie Parry\n\n+13\n\nDeath: Actor Bob Hoskins seen in September 2010\n\nBob Hoskins' daughter today paid an emotional tribute to him following his death last night, by revealing the 11 life lessons he taught her.\n\nRosa Hoskins, 30, said she loved her ‘darling’ 71-year-old actor father ‘to the ends of the earth and he loved me back just the same’.\n\nThe actress then listed the ‘advice that he tailor made just for me’, saying that he spoke ‘so often to encourage, comfort and reassure’.\n\nThey were: ‘laugh’; ‘be yourself’; ‘be flamboyant’; ‘don't worry about other people's opinions’; ‘get angry’; ‘whatever you do, always give it a good go'; ‘be generous and kind because you can't take it with you’; ‘appreciate beauty, take pictures and make memories’; ‘don't take yourself too seriously'; 'never, ever, ever, ever give up’; and ‘love with all your heart’.\n\nOn her website Haute Hoskins, she also says: ‘Bob has always been supportive of all Rosa’s work projects, although sometimes a little bemused by her tendency to overdress.\n\n‘When Rosa lived at home with her parents, Bob’s usual response to her fashion choices were “Got your acceptance speech ready love?”’\n\nMiss Hoskins, of Muswell Hill, north London, who stood 3in taller than her 5ft 6in father, is a costumer designer and has acted in TV dramas including Holby City and Midsomer Murders.\n\nHer father’s death following pneumonia comes two years after the much-loved actor announced he was retiring from showbusiness after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBob Hoskins's silver screen career spanned four decades and included Hollywood hits such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n+13\n\nTwitter tribute: Rosa Hoskins, 30, said she loved her 'darling' actor father 'to the ends of the earth'\n\n+13\n\nEleven lessons: Bob Hoskins with his daughter Rosa, 30, at a premiere in London in November 2005\n\n+13\n\nMarried: He had four children and lived in East Sussex with second wife Linda Banwell for more than a decade\n\nROSA HOSKINS: 11 LESSONS FROM MY DAD\n\nMy darling Dad has died. I loved him to the ends of the earth and he loved me back just the same. These are the lessons he taught me, I will keep them close to my heart and remind myself of them whenever I stumble or falter. They are his words; the words spoke so often to encourage, comfort and reassure. This isn’t general wisdom, rather advice that he tailor made just for me. I love you Dad.\n\nDaughter and father: Rosa and Bob Hoskins in 2006\n\n1) Laugh. There’s humour to be found everywhere, even your darkest days there’s something to have a joke about. Laugh long and loud and make other people laugh. It’s good for you.\n\n2) Be yourself. If someone doesn’t like you they’re either stupid , blind, or they’ve got bad taste. Accept who you are, you’ve got no one else to be. Don’t try to change yourself, there’s no point. Don’t apologise. Don’t make excuses. Be yourself and if anyone else doesn’t like it they can f*ck off.\n\n3) Be flamboyant, it’s who you are and always have been. Be eccentric and unique. Don’t try to adapt yourself to someone else’s view of normal. That belongs to them, not you. Like yourself as who you are.\n\n4) Don’t worry about other people’s opinions. Everyone’s a critic, but ultimately what they say only matters if you let it. Don’t believe your own press. People can just as easily sing your praises as they can tear you down. Don’t waste your time on things you can’t change. Let it slide off you like water off a duck’s back.\n\n5) Get angry, it’s ok to lose your temper now and then. If anger stays in, it turns to poison and makes you bitter and sad. Get angry, say your peace, then let it go.\n\n6) Whatever you do, always give it a good go. Don’t be afraid of failure and disappointment. If you fall flat on your face then get straight back up. You’ll always regret not trying. Disappointment is temporary, regret is forever.\n\n7) Be generous and kind because you can’t take it with you. When you’ve got something to give, give it without hesitation.\n\n8) Appreciate beauty, take pictures and make memories. Capture it, you never know when it’ll be gone.\n\n9) Don’t take yourself too seriously. People who take themselves too seriously are boring.\n\n10) Never, ever, ever, ever give up. Keep on punching no matter what your up against. You’re only defeated if you give up, so don’t give up.\n\n11) Love with all your heart. In the end, love is the only thing that matters.\n\nHis most recent appearance was in Snow White and the Huntsman, released in 2012 and starring Kristen Stewart. He had four children - Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack.\n\nAlong with his wife Linda, they said in a statement: 'We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia.'\n\nThe family also thanked well-wishers for their 'messages of love and support'. In 2012, Hoskins revealed his battle with the brain disorder several months after his diagnosis.\n\nDame Helen Mirren was among those paying her respects to the man she starred alongside in The Long Good Friday and Last Orders.\n\nShe said: ‘Bob was a great actor and an even greater man. Funny, loyal, instinctive, hard-working, with that inimitable energy that seemed like a spectacular firework rocket just as it takes off.\n\n+13\n\nHollywood hit: He played Eddie Valiant in the 1988 Touchstone Pictures film Who Framed Roger Rabbit\n\n+13\n\nRespected: He had an Oscar nomination for best actor for his lead role in Mona Lisa, with Cathy Tyson in 1986\n\n+13\n\nPirate: Hoskins played Smee in the 1991 Steven Spielberg film Hook, which also starred Robin Williams\n\n‘When I worked with him on his iconic film The Long Good Friday, he was supportive and unegotistic. He was never sexist, when many around at that time were. I had the honour of watching the creation of one of the most memorable characters of British film.\n\nPARKINSON'S: TREMORS, MUSCLE STIFFNESS AND MOVEMENT ISSUES\n\nParkinson's disease is a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively more and more damaged over many years.\n\nIt causes involuntary shaking and tremors, muscle stiffness and a slowing down of physical movements. It can also result in depression, daytime sleepiness and swallowing difficulties.\n\nParkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. This leads to a reduction in the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain. This plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body.\n\nActor Michael J Fox, 52, is one of the most well-known sufferers of the disease, which he has battled for more than 20 years.\n\nAnother high-profile sufferer is 72-year-old former boxer Muhammad Ali, who was diagnosed at the age of 42 in 1984.\n\n’I watched his brilliant Bosola in The Duchess Of Malfi, and then had the greatest of pleasures in playing again opposite him in the film Last Orders. Playing again with him was like playing a duet with a brother I had grown up with, which professionally I had.\n\n‘I personally will miss him very much, London will miss one of her best and most loving sons, and Britain will miss a man to be proud of.’\n\nCulture Minister Ed Vaizey paid tribute today, saying: 'For decades, Bob Hoskins has entertained television and film audiences of all age groups around the world. The British film industry has lost one of its true greats, and my thoughts and sympathies go out to his family and friends.'\n\nActor Stephen Fry said on Twitter today: 'Oh no, Bob Hoskins. Gone? That’s awful news. The Long Good Friday [is] one of the best British movies of the modern era. A marvellous man.'\n\nAnd actor Martin Kemp ‏added: 'RIP Bob Hoskins - Long Good Friday [is] one of the best movies ever made. You will be missed.'\n\nHoskins began his film career in the 1970s and found fame playing Harold Shand in the iconic 1980 gangster film The Long Good Friday alongside Mirren.\n\nAn Oscar nomination for best actor and further critical acclaim followed his lead role in another British film, Mona Lisa, in 1986.\n\n+13\n\nCouple: Actor Bob Hoskins and his second wife Linda arrive for a UK film premiere in London in May 2004\n\nReaction: Actor Martin Kemp said on Twitter that Long Good Friday is 'one of the best movies ever made'\n\n'Marvellous': Actor Stephen Fry also had praise for The Long Good Friday, saying it was 'one of the best British movies of the modern era'\n\n'A gentleman': Actor Samuel L Jackson described Hoskins as a 'truly gigantic talent', saying he was 'truly saddened'\n\nHe went on to play Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, and Smee in both Hook (1991) and Neverland (2011).\n\n'Bob was a great actor and an even greater man. Funny, loyal, instinctive, hard-working, with that inimitable energy that seemed like a spectacular firework rocket just as it takes off'\n\nDame Helen Mirren\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s he was also famous for his adverts for BT, and his ‘It’s good to talk’ catchphrase became well-known.\n\nHe lived in East Sussex with second wife Linda for more than a decade. Asked in May 2012 if acting was still a passion, Hoskins replied: ‘Acting is a lark but I’m trying to work less.\n\n'They say: \"Bob I know you’re trying to retire but we’ve got a little swan song here which is the business...\" and I get talked into it. The more you don’t want to work, the more work you get.\n\n'I want to be at home with the wife but she doesn’t want me to retire, she wants me out of the house.'\n\nBob Hoskins: How a nursery school teacher's son fell into a Hollywood career\n\nFrom circus worker and camel herder, actor Bob Hoskins rose to become a Hollywood giant.\n\nBorn in October 1942 in the Suffolk town of Bury St Edmunds, Hoskins was the son of Elsie, a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert, who drove a lorry and worked as a book keeper.\n\nHis mother gave birth in the market town after being evacuated from the capital during the heavy bombings of the Second World War.\n\nAs a child Hoskins grew up in north London leaving school at the age of 15.\n\n+13\n\nClassic: His career spanned four decades and included Hollywood hits such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit\n\n+13\n\nCo-stars: He appeared in Neverland in 2011 as Mr Smee alongside Anna Friel, who played Elizabeth Bonny\n\nBefore embarking on his acting career Hoskins had a string of unusual jobs including looking after camels in Syria and later packing fruit on a kibbutz in Israel.\n\n'A MARVELLOUS MAN': TRIBUTES TO HOSKINS POUR IN ON TWITTER\n\nTributes have poured in for Hoskins, with many taking to Twitter to express their disbelief at his death.\n\nActor and comedian Stephen Fry tweeted: ‘Oh no, Bob Hoskins. Gone? That's awful news. The Long Good Friday one of the best British movies of the modern era. A marvellous man.’\n\nHollywood actor James Woods, who starred with Hoskins in the 1995 drama Nixon, mourned his death by celebrating the Briton's acting talents. He tweeted: ‘Oh man, what a terrible loss. A great guy and a superb artist.’\n\nFellow Tinstletown legend Samuel L Jackson spoke of his sadness at the news, saying: ‘Truly saddened by the passing of Bob Hoskins! A truly Gigantic talent & a Gentleman. R.I.P.’\n\nThe League of Gentlemen actor Mark Gatiss, who starred in a production of The Wind In The Willows with Hoskins for the BBC, posted a photograph of the pair from the show.\n\nHe tweeted: ‘So sad to hear we've lost the great Bob Hoskins. A true gent & an inspiration. Happy memories of 'the Willows' in '06’.\n\nActor Nick Frost shared the silver screen with Hoskins when they appeared together as Nion and Muir, two of the seven dwarves in the 2012 film Snow White And The Huntsman.\n\nFrost tweeted: ‘Terribly sad news about Bob Hoskins. A pleasure to have shared the screen with you mate. An Actors actor and a gentleman to boot. RIP.\n\n‘If you want to see Bob in full flow watch The Long Good Friday. A tour de force. The long shot at the end of Bob in the taxi is amazing.’\n\nTheatre director and choreographer Matthew Bourne added simply: ‘RIP Bob Hoskins’.\n\nActor and Spandau Ballet musician Martin Kemp said: ‘RIP Bob Hoskins, 'Long Good Friday' one of the best movies ever made! You will be missed!’, while EastEnders star Shane Richie said: ‘Goodbye to a giant of British cinema RIP bob Hoskins x’.\n\nHis fellow soap star Danny Dyer said: ‘RIP Bob Hoskins.....gone but never ever forgotten. ‘\n\nThe Da Vinci Code and Spider-Man 2 actor Alfred Molina tweeted: ‘RIP Bob Hoskins. One of the great ones. True gentleman, gifted actor, you will be terribly missed’, while comedian Omid Djalili wrote: ‘RIP Bob Hoskins. Worked with him twice. Always a laugh’.\n\nShadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said: ‘Sad to hear that Bob Hoskins has died - great actor’, while sports presenter Gabby Logan tweeted: ‘If there was ever a man who personified Avuncular on screen and apparently in life it was Bob Hoskins. As in reassuring and trustworthy.’\n\nIrish Game Of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham, who starred with Hoskins in Jimmy McGovern drama The Street, tweeted of how he enjoyed filming with the diminutive actor.\n\nHe tweeted: ‘I filmed \"The Street\" with Bob Hoskins in 2010. Had copious amounts of wine with the man. It was a joy to work with him. RIP’.\n\nPop star Boy George wrote: ‘R.I.P Bob Hoskins’, while Jermain Jackman, winner of this year's talent show The Voice, said: ‘Rest In Peace Bob Hoskins! Who framed Rodger Rabbit is one of my favourite films! You will be missed!’\n\nFormer British children's laureate Michael Rosen tweeted: ‘Loved Bob Hoskins. First saw him in Ken Campbell's Roadshow in about 1970. Perf'd brilliantly my story “The Bakerloo Flea” on TV.’\n\nHe is also known to have worked as a porter, lorry driver and window cleaner and attempted a three-year accounting course but dropped out, before he discovered acting.\n\nBut a passion for language and literature inspired by his former English teacher, saw the teenager dream of a career path that would lead him on to the stage.\n\nHoskins stumbled into acting at the age of 26 when he accompanied a friend to watch a series of auditions at the Unity Theatre in 1969, only to be confused for one of the actors taking part.\n\nA script was pushed into his hands and Hoskins ended up being given the role.\n\nOn getting his first role, Hoskins, said: 'I was three parts pissed. We were going to a party. And this bloke comes around and says: \"Right. You're next. Have you seen the script?\"...And I got the leading part.'\n\nHe spent several seasons with the Royal National Theatre and the Old Vic Theatre in London, where his credits included everything from a range of Shakespeare to Chechov to Shaw.\n\nAfter some success on the stage, he moved to television securing roles in the series Villains (1972) and Thick As Thieves (1974).\n\nHe launched his film career in the mid-70s.\n\nHis first role was a stand-out performance alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Inserts (1974), followed by a smaller part in Richard Lester's Royal Flash (1975).\n\nHis big break came when in 1978 he stared in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Pennies From Heaven, playing the role of Arthur Parker a doomed salesman.\n\nThat performance secured Hoskins a string of film offers.\n\nHis debut in a major blockbuster came in 1980 when he secured the role of Harold Shand in gangster film The Long Good Friday, alongside actress Helen Mirren.\n\nAn Oscar nomination for best actor and further critical acclaim, including a BAFTA award, followed his lead role in another British film, Mona Lisa, in 1986.\n\nHe went on to play Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, and Smee in both Hook (1991) and Neverland (2011), and Nikita Khrushchev in Enemy At The Gates (2001).\n\nHis instantly-recognisable London accent did not stop him taking a role as FBI boss J Edgar Hoover in the 1995 film Nixon.\n\nDespite big-budget hits, he was more than happy to appear in low-budget movies such as the Shane Meadows-directed A Room For Romeo Brass.\n\nThe star - married to his second wife Linda for 30 years - also moved into directing with The Raggedy Rawney and Rainbow.\n\nDespite his flourishing big-screen career, Hoskins took a role in Jimmy McGovern's BBC1 series The Street in 2009, winning an international Emmy.\n\nHe was famously on standby to play Al Capone in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, until Robert De Niro agreed to take the role.\n\nThe director went on to send him a cheque for £20,000.\n\nHoskins said: 'I phoned him up and I said \"Brian, if you've ever got any films you don't want me in, son, you just give me a call\".'\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Hoskins also became known for his adverts for BT, and his ‘It’s good to talk’ catchphrase became well-known.\n\nHoskins announced his retirement after being diagnosed with Parkinson's in the Autumn of 2011 and his last film, Snow White And The Huntsman was released in 2012.\n\nSpeaking about the acting profession, Hoskins said: 'I came into this business uneducated, dyslexic, 5ft 6in, cubic, with a face like a squashed cabbage and they welcomed me with open arms.'\n\nIn 1988, he said the profession had become one of the great joys of his life.\n\nHe said: 'My life has taken off - my life, my career - everything. I can honestly say I've never been happier.

He is the son of Elsie Lillian (Hopkins), a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert William Hoskins, Sr., who drove a lorry and worked as a bookkeeper. Growing up, Hoskins received only limited education and he left school at 15, but with a passion for language and literature instilled by his former English teacher. A regular theatre-goer, Hoskins dreamed of starring on stage, but before he could do so he had to work odd jobs for a long time to make ends meet. His acting career started out more by accident than by design, when he accompanied a friend to watch some auditions, only to be confused for one of the people auditioning, getting a script pushed into his hands with the message \"You're next\". He got the part and acquired an agent. After some stage success, he expanded to television with roles in television series such as Villains (1972) and Thick as Thieves (1974). In the mid-'70s, he started his film career, standing out when he performed alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Inserts (1974) and in a smaller part in Richard Lester's Royal Flash (1975).\n\nHoskins broke through in 1978 in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Pennies from Heaven (1978), playing \"Arthur Parker\", the doomed salesman. After this, a string of high-profile and successful films followed, starting with his true major movie debut in 1980's The Long Good Friday (1980) as the ultimately doomed \"Harold Shand\". This was followed by such works as The Cotton Club (1984), Mona Lisa (1986), which won him an Oscar nomination as well as a BAFTA award, Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (Golden Globe nomination), Mermaids (1990), Hook (1991), Nixon (1995), Felicia's Journey (1999) and Enemy at the Gates (2001).\n\nHoskins has always carefully balanced the riches of Hollywood with the labor of independent film, though leaning more towards the latter than the former. He works at smaller projects such as Shane Meadows' debut Twenty Four Seven (1997), in which he starred as \"Allen Darcy\". Besides this, he found time to direct, write and star in The Raggedy Rawney (1988), as well as direct and star in Rainbow (1995), and contributing to HBO's Tales from the Crypt (1989) and Tube Tales (1999).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Thomas Beekers\n\nSpouse (2)\n\nLinda Banwell (1982 - present) (2 children)\n\nJane Livesey (1967 - 1978) (divorced) (2 children)\n\nTrade Mark (3)\n\nGravelly voice and strong cockney accent.\n\nFrequently plays grouchy short-tempered characters\n\nShort stature\n\nTrivia (27)\n\nRanked #97 in Empire (UK) magazine's \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\" list.

And this bloke comes around and says: 'Right. You're next. Have you seen the script?'...And I got the leading part.\"\n\n[speaking in 1988] \"My life has taken off - my life, my career - everything. I can honestly say I've never been happier. I'm walking around thinking any minute now, 25 tons of horse-shit is going to fall on my head.\"\n\n\"Most dictators were short, fat, middle-aged and hairless. Besides Danny DeVito, there's only me to play them\".\n\nWhen you get to my age, what you want is the cameo. You get paid a lot of money. You fly in for a couple of weeks. Everybody treats you like the crown jewels. It's all great and if the film turns out to be a load of shit, nobody blames you.\n\nMy own mum wouldn't call me pretty.\n\nI've watched films and even forgotten I'm in them.\n\nYou don't end up with a face like this if you're hard, do ya? This comes from having too much mouth and nothing to back it up with. The nose has been broken so many times.\n\nYou reach a point where the cameo is the governor. You go in there for a couple of weeks, you're paid a lot of money, everybody treats you like the crown jewels, you're in and out, and if the film's a load of shit, nobody blames you, y'knowwhadimean. It's wonderful.\n\nThe worst thing I ever did? Super Mario Bros. (1993). It was a f**kin' nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks, their own agent told them to get off the set! F**kin' nightmare. F**kin' idiots.\n\n[on Robert De Niro] De Niro has only shown me kindness. He's a real friend. He's helped me shop for my wife's and my kid's Christmas presents. He's invited me round to meet his granny and he's come to my house for a pot-luck diner. That really knocked my wife out. I think she was finally impressed with me.\n\n[on director Francis Ford Coppola] Coppola couldn't piss in a pot.\n\n[on Neil Jordan] I think Neil is a magician. And I believe in magic.\n\n[on the acting profession] I came into this business uneducated, dyslexic, 5ft 6in, cubic, with a face like a squashed cabbage and they welcomed me with open arms.\n\nI realized one day that men are emotional cripples. We can't express ourselves emotionally, we can only do it with anger and humor. Emotional stability and expression comes from women. When they have babies they say \"hello, you're welcome\" and they mean it. It is an emotional honesty.\n\n[on Method acting] Method is a load of bollocks.\n\nActing is a lark but I'm trying to work less. They say: 'Bob I know you're trying to retire but we've got a little swan song here which is the business...' and I get talked into it. The more you don't want to work, the more work you get. I want to be at home with the wife but she doesn't want me to retire, she wants me out of the house.\n\nFamily's all I've got. I've got money, yeah, but it's my family that I care about.\n\nIt's funny, going in a pub now and there's no smoke. It may be healthier but it doesn't feel right. Even the beer tastes different.\n\n[in his last-ever interview in August 2012] My greatest pleasure in life is a completely appointment-less day with nothing to do. It means I can read a book, listen to the radio and do exactly as I wish. If you are going to do a film properly you have to give yourself completely to it. You can't slip in and slip out again. You give it the business. My diary now is free, completely free. That's the way I like it. I only do what I want to do."
