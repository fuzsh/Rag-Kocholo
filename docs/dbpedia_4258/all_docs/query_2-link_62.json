        "text": "British actor Bob Hoskins, whose roles ranged from London gangsters to FBI chief J Edgar Hoover and who starred opposite a cast of cartoon characters in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, has died after a bout of pneumonia.\n\nHe was 71.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob,\" a statement issued on behalf of his wife Linda, the couple's two children, Jack and Rosa, and Hoskins's two children from his first marriage, Alex and Sarah, said.\n\n\"Bob died peacefully at hospital last night, surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia.\n\n\"We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.\"\n\nHoskins was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his role in Mona Lisa in 1986, in which he starred opposite Sir Michael Caine and Robbie Coltrane.\n\nHe announced his retirement from acting in 2012, saying at the time that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, an incurable muscular disorder.\n\nHoskins left school at the age of 15 and claimed he only got his break in acting by accident, after being mistakenly called for a theatre audition.\n\nHis career began in the 1970s on British television shows such as Thick as Thieves and Rock Follies of '77.\n\nMoving into big film roles, his turn as a mobster in 1980's The Long Good Friday shot him to stardom and defined his tough-guy persona.\n\n\"He was one of the nicest and best actors I have ever worked with,\" Caine told the BBC.\n\nThe Suffolk-born actor became a staple face in the British film industry, often playing Cockney-speaking characters in both comedy and drama genres with his trademark gravelly voice.\n\nHis big Hollywood break came in 1988 when he played Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a role for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. He then went on to play roles in 1990's Mermaids and 1991's Hook.\n\nHe portrayed Hoover in the 1995 movie Nixon, earning a Screen Actors Guild nomination.\n\nIn his later years he took on parts in smaller films, including a role in Made in Dagenham about women seeking equal pay with male workers at a car plant near London.\n\nHe also played the voice of the character Winston in the 2006 film Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties.\n\nMore recent success came with a Globe nomination for Mrs Henderson Presents with Dame Judi Dench, while his last role was one of the seven dwarves in the film Snow White and the Huntsman.\n\nFilm critic Nick James, who edits the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine, said Hoskins was one of the most recognisable British actors in British and American films of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\"He's that kind of character - very, very versatile, a huge range of emotions,\" James told Sky.\n\n\"His career really spans a great period in British work and he's all over it.\""
