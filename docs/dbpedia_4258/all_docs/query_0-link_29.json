        "text": "Scarlett Caminiti Bouder (’96) and her business partner have created a new philanthropic fund that will help young women and girls in Cleveland and across Ohio–particularly low-income and those of color–access reproductive services, build their capacity for public service, and afford higher education.\n\nThe Advocacy & Communication Solutions, LLC (ACS) Fund for Women & Girls was created by entrepreneurs Scarlett Caminiti Bouder (’96) and Lori McClung and their all-female company in honor of the firm’s 20thanniversary in business. ACS is an Ohio-based female- and minority-owned consulting firm that has grown into a national business with clients in nearly two dozen states. The firm provides advocacy, communication, strategy development, and capacity building services across the nonprofit, government, and philanthropic sectors, with a focus on early childhood, K-12 education, workforce, Medicaid, and health and human services fields.\n\nThe Fund is held at the Cleveland Foundation and will support the efforts of young women to achieve reproductive justice (including access to abortion or contraceptives, transportation, other health care procedures, and prescriptions); build their capacity for public service (such as training to become an elected official, seed funding for campaign planning, and supporting women in government leadership); and access to higher education (including assistance for first-generation applicants and students applying to or attending an institution of higher education with expenses such as application fees).\n\nBouder said the idea of the Fund was inspired by individuals, organizations, and communities they have served through their work and from their own personal experiences.\n\n“The ACS team knew that we could be a catalyst for change, and we plan to aggressively leverage the fund to support targeted and proven solutions that have impact,” said Bouder. “Young women and girls are resilient, creative and inspiring and when we invest in them, especially women and girls of color, everyone benefits.”\n\nA first-generation college graduate, Bouder, ACS president and co-founder, added, “Higher education is many times out of reach financially for first generation students, but we do know that when they receive direct support for things usually not covered by traditional grants and scholarships, they are more likely to persist and complete their degree.”\n\nThe entrepreneurs seeded the fund with an initial $20,000 investment in honor of their 20 years in business. The inaugural fundraising goal of $200,000 will fuel its first grants at the end of 2024.\n\nFor more information about the Fund and/or to make a contribution, visit the Cleveland Foundation donations page.\n\nMary Lynne Cleverdon of Springfield IL passed away peacefully on July 10, 2024 with her son Joseph by her side. Lynne was born on September 13, 1941 to Arne and Mary Larson in Concordia, KS. She grew up in Kansas, Montana, and New Jersey and attended The College of Wooster in Wooster, OH, 1959 – 1963. At Wooster, she was a member of Pi Kappa, aka “Peanuts.”\n\nLynne was a devoted mother and friend. While she was an active volunteer and single working mom, her children Carol and Joe came first. She always had time to make lunches, design Halloween costumes, drive carpools, and host sleepovers. She was close to her extended family, sending greeting cards and traveling to be with family whenever possible.\n\nShe also found time to be a friend to so many, helping however she could, always ready to listen and be present. Just days before her death, Lynne was still seeing friends, listening intently, and sharing her love and concern.\n\nShe was generous and philanthropic, supporting a wide range of causes including civil rights organizations, museums, performing arts, veterans, environmental organizations, food pantries, and children in need.\n\nAs a volunteer, Lynne held leadership roles with Westminster Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Women, the Illinois Presbyterian Home for the elderly, Church Women United, P.E.O., and the Academy of Lifelong Learning. She was President of the Board at Kemmerer Village, a residential treatment campus for young people sponsored by the Presbyterian Church.\n\nShe married David Cleverdon in 1962. During the summer of 1963, the couple traveled by motorcycle from Ohio to California to New Hampshire, finally settling in Chicago IL where David attended the University of Chicago and Lynne worked in the university’s library.\n\nLynne and David were involved in the Freedom Summer of 1964 in Mississippi focused on helping Black Americans register to vote. After Mississippi, Lynne taught at Reaves Elementary School on the South Side of Chicago. Her daughter Carol was born in 1968.\n\nLynne and David became active in Chicago and Illinois politics, including the campaign which brought Governor Dan Walker to office. They moved to Springfield IL in 1973 and a few months later their son Joseph was born. Lynne was a homemaker and David worked in the Walker administration.\n\nAfter her divorce in 1976, Lynne became the Director of Christian Education at Westminster Presbyterian Church where she was a member. In 1978 she became the Business Manager for the Medical Humanities Department at SIU School of Medicine.\n\nWhile at SIU, Lynne received a Masters degree in Counseling from University of Illinois Springfield. Her role expanded to include counseling individuals, teaching and evaluating medical students in interpersonal skills, and offering other electives as an adjunct faculty member. She also managed the SIU Pearson Museum. She retired from SIU in 2007.\n\nLynne dedicated herself to a life of service and will be missed by so many family members, friends, and everyone who knew her. May her memory inspire all of us to be more kind and generous.\n\nLynne is survived by her son Joseph Cleverdon, her daughter Carol Booth (David Booth), her grandchildren Joshua, Naomi, and Maytal Booth, and her siblings Arne Larson, Kristen Carlson, Timothy Larson, and Elise Sprague and their families. She is also survived by a large extended family of cousins, nieces, nephews and their children, all of whom she loved very much.\n\nThe memorial service for Lynne will be on Monday, August 26, 11:00AM, at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Springfield, IL.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Lynne’s memory may be sent to Kemmerer Village in Assumption, IL (www.kemmerervillage.org) or Contact Ministries in Springfield, IL (www.contactministries.com).\n\nMr. Kenneth Reid Harker, Jr. died on Sunday, June 16, 2024, at his home in Nashville, Indiana, about three months after the discovery of esophageal cancer that had spread throughout his body. He was 83 years old. Mr. Harker was born on April 23, 1941, at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was the son of Kenneth Reid Harker Sr. (1910-1979) and Anna Elizabeth (“Betty”) (Beckman) Harker (1915-2014).\n\nMr. Harker was the first of four children in the Harker family (followed by his brother Thomas, sister Sue, and brother Richard), all of whom grew up together in Indianapolis. He attended Henry Peter Coburn School Number 66 and Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, graduating from high school in the class of 1959. In addition to school, he took pride in working part-time and summer jobs, starting with a paper route at age 8. He also was active in the Boy Scouts and was a camp counselor at both Boy Scouts and Presbyterian church camps for several summers. His family was active in the Tabernacle Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis. In high school, he ran both track and cross country, but had stronger interests in academics. Following high school, he went to Wooster, Ohio, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the College of Wooster in 1963. While in college, he also had part-time jobs working food services at the college, as a carpenter, playing bass in a jazz band, and pitching logs in a paper mill. Deciding that he would prefer not to be a professional chemist or a chemistry teacher, he next attended the University of Michigan, School of Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in 1966.\n\nAfter a brief time in private practice as a lawyer with Kunz and Kunz in Indianapolis, Mr. Harker enlisted in the United States Navy’s Officer Candidate School in 1966. His first posting as an Ensign was aboard the USS Bennington (CVS-20) where he served during two combat periods as a Signals officer in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. During this time, he held an extraordinarily high security clearance, related to special duties to which he was assigned. While serving on the Bennington, he was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade. His second posting was aboard the USS Wright (CC-2) based in Norfolk, Virginia. While posted on the Wright, he was also given special duties of defense counsel for sailors facing courts martial or other disciplinary actions. During his time in the Navy, Mr. Harker was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Viet-Nam Service Medal, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n\nMr. Harker met his first wife, Erma Louise Shirk (1943-2004), in Long Beach, California while attending church on his first shore leave after returning from combat in Vietnam. They were married in Norfolk, Virginia, on September 27, 1969. After he was discharged from active military service at the end of his enlistment in October, 1969, they moved to Indianapolis where he resumed working as an attorney for Kunz and Kunz, making partner with the firm two years later. They had two children (Kenneth and Kathryn). Deciding that corporate legal work might provide a greater variety of experience, he left private practice and pursued a career as a corporate attorney for companies in the rapidly-changing telecommunications and high technology industries. His work resulted in moving the family from Indiana to Glen Ellyn, Illinois, then Edina, Minnesota, and finally to Garland, Texas. During this time, he and Erma were both active members and elders of Canyon Creek Presbyterian Church in Richardson, Texas, and they were both active with World Vision. In 2001, they funded the construction of a primary school in a rural village in Nicaragua, which was named honor of Mr. Harker’s mother Betty who accompanied them to the school’s dedication. After a more than 20-year tenure at Nortel, Mr. Harker was able to retire before the age of 60. Including some post-retirement side work, his legal career spanned over 50 years.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Harker had purchased land in Brown County, Indiana, just outside of the small town of Nashville. Shortly after he retired from Nortel, they began working with an architect and contractor to build their dream home in the woods. They moved there in 2002 and began enjoying life in the forest. Erma passed away unexpectedly from a heart condition in February 2004. They had been married for 34 years. After Erma’s passing, Mr. Harker met his second wife, Janet (“Jan”). Jan had moved to Nashville to take an executive leadership position with the Brown County YMCA, where they met. They were married on September 3, 2005 and enjoyed 17 years of married life before Jan passed away in April, 2022 from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. During his retirement, Mr. Harker enjoyed reading, enjoyed vacationing in Europe, was very active in Rotary International, was a supporter of Indiana Heritage Arts, and was an active member of both the Brown County Presbyterian Fellowship and later the Grace Reformed Church of Nashville.\n\nMr. Harker is survived by his son and daughter, Kenneth Harker (Jen) and Kathryn Tillman (Stuart). He had three grandchildren: Ryan Tillman, James Harker, and Anna Tillman. He also leaves behind two beloved brothers and a sister: Thomas Harker (Young), Sue Claphan (Michael), and Richard Harker. He is survived by brother-in-law Larry Shirk (Rita), nephews and nieces Lani Matthes (Rich), Daniel Claphan (Sara), Andrew Claphan (Jen), Linnea Roy (Jeremy), Dionna Baggaley (Christian), Richard Harker (Angela), and Kristin Harker. He is predeceased by his wives Erma Louise (Shirk) Harker and Janet Marie (Rickey) Harker, sisters-in-law Donna Jean Shirk, Jennifer Harker, Debra Ann (Thornton) Harker, and his nephew Todd Hardin.\n\nOn Friday, June 28, 2024 from 4:00 to 8:00 PM there will be a viewing at Bond-Mitchell Funeral Home, 1682 IN-135, Nashville, IN 47448.

He died peacefully in the early morning of May 19, after days of vigil by our daughter Susan and me, as well as visits from our sons, Rick and Milton, their wives Sadhana and Sara, and our grandchildren, Arjun and Julia. I know Fred was comforted by having his family with him during his final days.\n\nFred lived a full and adventurous life, always game to meet and overcome challenges. He leaves behind rich legacies. These include his deep commitment and service to the people of North East India, as well as his extensive contributions to theological education at the Eastern Theological College, in Jorhat (Assam, India), and at the United Theological College in Bangalore (Karnataka, India). He also made important contributions as a church historian, by helping to incorporate the history of Christianity in North East India into standard Indian Church History. Significantly, he was an early proponent of introducing and supporting doctoral level research among North East Indian students to study the history of Christianity in their region.\n\nFred’s humor, wit, and story-telling will be greatly missed. Once, Fred recalled a saying among the hill folk where he grew up in North East India, that “a tiger gives you a great ride…until you fall off!” It has been a wild ride for us in his final days and we managed to hang on … until now. Fred will live on in the lives of those he taught, and in the hearts of those who knew him well.\n\nA memorial service will be held on July 26, 2024 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (USA).

For a scientist, NAS membership is among the highest honors worldwide.\n\n“I was blown away, overjoyed, shocked and thrilled,” Major said about receiving the news on a morning call from the academy. “It’s a highlight of my professional life.”\n\nMajor is one of the world’s experts on the psychology of stigma. Her distinguished achievements in the field include research, writing and teaching about the psychological and physical impact of being a target of prejudice and discrimination. Traditionally, psychological research on prejudice focused on understanding its causes; why, for example, some people are disliked and discriminated against because of their race, gender or religion. Major took a different and initially unconventional approach, studying people on the receiving end of prejudice — how they perceive and cope with being a target of social stigma and discrimination and the impacts on their psychological well-being and physical health.\n\n“That has been the focus of my work throughout my entire career,” she said, adding that she has also written extensively about factors that shape perceptions of fairness more generally, as well as the psychological effects of practices to reduce discrimination, such as diversity initiatives and, more recently, anti-bias policies.\n\n“All of us at UC Santa Barbara join in congratulating professor Major on this well-deserved honor and milestone achievement,” said Chancellor Henry T. Yang. “Election to the National Academy of Sciences is a testament to Brenda’s renown among her colleagues, and affirmation of her pioneering research contributions. We could not be more proud of her accomplishments and career commitment to advancing scientific knowledge, notably in the areas of the psychology of stigma and psychological resilience.”\n\nMany of Major’s theoretical and empirical contributions have become seminal works in the field, noted Shelly Gable, department chair and professor. “Her work is noted equally for its intellectual rigor and societal importance. We are thrilled to have her as a colleague, and the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences is incredibly proud to congratulate her. This prestigious honor recognizes her scientific contributions and commitment to making our society a better place.”\n\nEstablished as an Act of Congress signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, the NAS is a private nonprofit institution. Its members serve as pro bono advisors, “providing independent objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology [and] scientific advice whenever called upon by any government department.”\n\nMajor was among the 120 new domestic members added this year after a formal process of nomination, vetting and election by existing members. Overall, the academy consists of more than 2,600 U.S. citizens and more than 500 nonvoting international scientists. Counting living and deceased, Major is the 50th member of NAS affiliated with UCSB as their primary institution.\n\nMajor joined UCSB in 1995 and retired from teaching in 2023. She continues to write and is currently working on a paper about how anti-bias norms affect perceptions of the authenticity of praise to members of marginalized groups.\n\nRaleigh, NC – May 21, 2024 – LeadingAge North Carolina, a leading advocate for continuing care retirement communities in North Carolina, is pleased to announce the election of two new at-large members to its Board of Directors.

Libby completed evaluator training for the Continuing Care Accreditation Commission, and has served on community and association boards, most recently as Chair of LeadingAge Virginia. Libby attended the College of Wooster for undergraduate studies and received her master’s degree at the University of Maryland at the Erickson School.\n\nMarianne Ratcliffe is President and CEO of Carol Woods Retirement Community in Chapel Hill, NC. She joined Carol Woods in 2021 after a career in senior health services, most recently with Piedmont Health Services, Inc. where she developed Piedmont Health SeniorCare, a Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly. PACE is a full-risk model of care providing frail seniors with comprehensive medical and social services needed to age safely in their community. Prior to Piedmont Health, Marianne worked as a program manager for the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation and was a program officer for the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust. In both roles she focused on initiatives supporting healthcare access for vulnerable populations. Marianne is a graduate of Skidmore College and earned her master’s degree in healthcare administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. She is an adjunct professor at the UNC Gillings School of Public Health.\n\nLeadingAge North Carolina is an association of member retirement communities across North Carolina, including continuing care retirement communities (also known as life plan communities) and affordable housing providers. It serves as the state affiliate of the national LeadingAge, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nLeadingAge North Carolina leverages the collective voice of its members to advocate for the needs of older adults in North Carolina. Its mission is to catalyze the development of innovative communities dedicated to promoting healthy aging in society.\n\nA key aspect of LeadingAge North Carolina’s mission is linking expertise with communities to empower their members for success. Through collaborative efforts, LeadingAge North Carolina organizes continuing education opportunities to help staff of retirement communities maintain their professional licensure and certification. These efforts culminate in the Annual Conference and Expo held each May.\n\nIn addition to education, LeadingAge North Carolina fosters a statewide support network for staff through a leadership academy, leadership retreats, and other gatherings.\n\nRuth Woodruff England Mock died on April 28, 2024 with her husband of nearly 60 years by her side.\n\nShe was born in New Jersey on March 27, 1943. She married Gary N. Mock, her high school sweetheart and was a mother of three sons; Kevin Gary Mock (wife Frances, sons Jackson and Quince), Darin England Mock (wife Shannon, children Stephen and Martha Anne), and Brian James Mock (children Grady, Roman, and Peri). She is also survived by her sister, Carolyn Elizabeth “Carolib” Baughman (husband Jim).\n\nAn educator with a Bachelor of Music Education from the College of Wooster, she taught band and chorus for 27 years in public schools. Her last 20 years were as band director at Apex Middle School, building the band almost from scratch to an accomplished ensemble with Superior ratings (the highest) at competitions for 16 years. She also taught music education courses at Clemson University, UNC-CH, and Meredith College and taught oboe privately for over 45 years. With a Master of Music in Oboe Performance from Converse College, she played oboe professionally and for fun until age 80 including many years in the Second Wind Quintet. She loved conducting at Glenaire for ten years and would direct any choir that would let her.\n\nAs a member of White Memorial Presbyterian Church, she was an Elder, a member of the Sanctuary Choir, bell choir, founder and director of the brass choir for 25 years, pianist, Sunday School teacher, and general music stand mover. She volunteered to sing and play oboe for Transitions Life Care (hospice) patients for 12 years.\n\nHer athletic endeavors began by making the All-Star field hockey team in high school and included excelling at tennis in the Senior Olympics, whitewater canoeing, driving every manner of boats with precision, and water skiing every summer from the age of 5 to age 80.\n\nA woman of many talents, she could operate a backhoe, cook, bake, sew, knit, braid rugs, refinish furniture, re-cane chairs, paint, garden, and keep meticulous family records. She often took matters into her own hands, including getting a CDL to drive the activity bus for the Apex Middle School band.\n\nHer summers were spent on an island on the Delaware River (Thomas Island) where her family first camped over 100 years ago. Accessible only by boat, the family cabin was a retreat filled with endless projects, Hellgrammiting (catching a clawed centipede for fishing) and her dominating competitive games of Scrabble, Spades, Bridge, and Pinochle. When the day was done, her favorite pastime was to sit on the front bank with Gary and watch the sun set on the river.\n\nShe was a force of nature and the winds at Lake Gaston, Thomas Island, and Raleigh will surely be quieter without her.\n\nA Witness to the Resurrection service will be held at White Memorial Presbyterian Church, 1704 Oberlin Rd., Raleigh, NC 27608, on Thursday, May 9th. Special music will begin at 1:30 PM. The service will begin at 2 PM, with a visitation to follow at the church.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Transitions LifeCare, 250 Hospice Circle, Raleigh, NC 27607.\n\nArrangements by Brown-Wynne, 300 Saint Mary’s Street, Raleigh.\n\nJohn Francis Rudge, 80, of Cumming, died Monday afternoon, November 21, 2022, at his home following an extended illness.

Hydorn, 99, passed away peacefully on March 15, 2024, surrounded by her loving family. She was born on October 29, 1924, in Franklin, NJ, the daughter of Millard and Frances Goldsmith. She graduated from Newton High School in 1941 and the College of Wooster in Ohio in 1945. Margie’s love language was music. She would regularly gather her family together to sing around the piano and encouraged them all to make music a part of their lives. She had a lovely voice, played piano beautifully, and was the organist and music director at Grace Linn Methodist Church in Hartland for many years. Margie was a teacher all of her life. She taught her children to sew, to bake, to identify the birds and wildflowers, to garden (though she was always the best gardener of them all!), and to put food by. She led 4-H clubs, gave piano lessons, and taught 6th grade in public schools in New England and in New Mexico, including on the Navajo Reservation. In her later years she taught English as a Second Language and led a Bible study into her 90s. Margie had an abiding faith in God and expressed that not only through her music, but also in the generous support she and her husband Bill gave to many charitable organizations and by extending hospitality to anyone who needed a cup of tea, a meal, or a place to stay. So many have received this hospitality and all will remember her fondly. She is survived by her daughters: Mary Jane Sorensen and husband Earl, Elizabeth Gagnon, and Sarah Hydorn and husband Peter Armstrong; daughter-in -law Donna Farrell; 13 grandchildren; 22 great-grandchildren; nieces and nephews and many friends. She was predeceased by her loving husband, William Hydorn; her daughter Susan Hydorn; her son, Thomas Hydorn; her son-in-law, George Gagnon; and two sisters, Mary Struble and Amanda Farrell.

Johnson, Jr. died April 13, 2024, at Canterbury Place of heart failure following a stroke. He was 68. Born May 4, 1955, to Thomas E. and Dolores Johnson, he grew up in Wilkinsburg. His parents raised him with a strong belief in the power of education and sent him to Shady Side Academy, where he graduated in 1973. “At Shady Side,” he recalled, “I learned to read well, write well, speak well, and think well, all so that ultimately I could live well.” After his graduation from the College of Wooster in 1977, Reverend Johnson returned to Shady Side, where he served over the course of many years as an English teacher, coach, dorm parent, counselor, and trustee. As the head varsity boys’ lacrosse coach, Reverend Johnson instilled in his players a sense of sportsmanship, integrity, and other life lessons, and he led them in volunteering regularly at Rainbow Kitchen. His iconic pre-game rallying cry says it all: “Take care of yourself, take care of your teammates, and the rest will take care of itself!” With a looming presence and a booming voice, he continued to offer inspiring invocations and benedictions at Shady Side events until his death. Reverend Johnson later earned a Masters of Divinity degree from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. It was there that he formed his sense of vocation and met Jodie Moore, his partner and dearest friend, with whom he co-founded The Neighborhood Academy in 2001. Over the course of two decades, with their shared passion for educating underserved youth and breaking the cycle of poverty, they built the school from a small program for a handful of students in a renovated warehouse to a beautiful new facility in Garfield for more than 150 middle and high school students. “He and I were the most important people in one another’s lives,” says Mrs. Moore. “We believed that we were called to be together, not just to found the school but to complete one another in some way.” At his core, Reverend Johnson was a profound thinker, philosopher, and empathetic man with a deep and abiding faith formed in the crucible of African American struggle and spirituality. His faith and his relationship with God informed everything he said and did, whether he was preaching, teaching, coaching, or just talking with a friend. Never one to allow obstacles to get in his way, he was fond of saying, “God hasn’t brought us this far to kick us to the curb.” An ordained pastor in the United Church of Christ, he served at Allegheny United Church of Christ and East Liberty Presbyterian Church before turning his attention to become Head of School at the Neighborhood Academy. Even as he led the school, he continued to serve the congregation at the Community of Reconciliation. At the time of his death, Reverend Johnson was in the process of starting another school, the Mon Valley Boys’ Academy, where he had already worked with the first cohort of students in a summer academy and a subsequent tutoring and mentoring program. A transformational educator and leader, Reverend Johnson was recognized for his accomplishments with the Andrew Matheson Award from FAME, a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, the General Synod United Church of Christ Excellence in Teaching Award, the New Pittsburgh Courier’s Man of Excellence Award, and an honorary PhD from Bethany College. Reverend Johnson is survived by his partner and dearest friend, Jodie Moore, and her family, and by his cousin, Helen Ford, and her children John and Sonya Ford, along with the hundreds of individuals to whom he was a treasured pastor, teacher, coach, mentor, and friend. While he never married or had children of his own, he is also survived by countless students who cherished him as a father figure, from the summer programs he ran in the 1990s, to Shady Side Academy, the Neighborhood Academy, and the Mon Valley Boys’ Academy summer program that he launched in 2023. Friends will be received Wednesday, April 17 from 3:00 to 7:00 pm at John A. Freyvogel Sons Funeral Home at 4900 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh. A funeral service will be held Thursday, April 18 at 11:00 am at Third Presbyterian Church, 5701 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh. Following a private interment, friends are invited to a reception at The Neighborhood Academy, 709 North Aiken Avenue, Pittsburgh. Memorial contributions in Reverend Johnson’s honor may be made\n\nDavid M. MacMillin, 94, passed away peacefully while surrounded in the love of his family at RiverMead Lifecare Community in Peterborough, NH.\n\nDavid was the third of four children to Howard MacMillin and Corinne (Miller) MacMillin and was born and raised in Mt. Gilead, OH, later relocating to Wilmette, IL. He attended the College of Wooster in Wooster, OH where he met, Mary. He transferred to Northwestern University in Evanston, IL where he received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Dave and Mary were married in 1951.\n\nDave, Mary, and their children lived in Evanston and Wilmette, IL while he designed motion picture cameras at Bell & Howell. In 1966 they moved to Ridgewood, NJ when he worked for Becton Dickinson as a director of new product development until 1985. In the early 1970’s they began vacationing in New Hampshire in the New London area and built a second home near Twin Lake Village.\n\nAfter his retirement, Dave followed his passion for the design and construction of energy-efficient buildings. After training at Yestermorrow Design/Build School, he designed and built a new home on Cape Cod in Chatham, MA where he and Mary moved in 1986 and another home on Little Lake Sunapee in New London, NH where they lived full-time starting in 1998. He also designed and oversaw construction of buildings for the American Youth Foundation in Tuftonboro, NH and the New London Historical Society. Dave and Mary moved to RiverMead in Peterborough, NH in 2016.\n\nDave, along with Mary, was always deeply involved in the church, especially the choral music ministry, including church choirs at First Baptist and St. Andrew’s Episcopal churches in New London. Their love of singing also led them to participate in numerous other choruses. They enjoyed their devoted group of life-long friends from college, church, music, and tennis. Dave was also an accomplished woodworker and photographer, enjoyed golf, sailing, and being a DIY’er, and was an avid ping pong player.\n\nWhat brought Dave his greatest joy was the cacophony while being surrounded by his entire family at the beautiful homes he built on the Cape and in New London. He was affectionately known as “Mac” to his grandchildren. He had a wry sense of humor that he maintained until the very end.\n\nDavid is survived by Mary Billett MacMillin, his wife of 72 years. He is also survived by his son, Scott MacMillin (Kristine) of Plymouth, MA and his daughters, Martha MacMillin (George Plesko) of Sharon, MA and Katherine Thomas (Michael) of Springfield, NH. David had seven beautiful grandchildren including Eric MacMillin, Brian MacMillin, Stephen Plesko, Corinne Plesko, Dean Thomas, Clay Thomas, and Andrew Thomas and two great-grandchildren of whom he was very proud. He was predeceased by his sister and two brothers.\n\nA memorial service will be held in New London at a date to be determined in spring of 2024.\n\nDonations may be made in memory of David to the American Youth Foundation [ayf.com].\n\nRoy James McCorkel Jr died at home on February 3rd surrounded by family. He was 84. The third generation “Roy McCorkel,” he went by Jamie in his childhood and then by Jim. Jim was a lifelong sociologist both by hobby and by profession. He was fascinated with and delighted by people, often turning around to watch the audience instead of a movie, and attending the circus right into his older years. He made friends quickly and easily, and had a knack for letting his friends know how much he enjoyed and appreciated them.\n\nJim was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Swarthmore, PA. When he was one year old his parents bought a small woodlot in central Pennsylvania and named it the McCorkel Tree Farm. His family shared this Quaker summer community with family and lifelong friends. He spent time at the Tree Farm nearly every year of his life, in his later years devoting significant efforts towards removing invasive species. His children and grandchildren inherited his devotion to the Tree Farm, spending time every summer on the land that has been tended to by five generations of McCorkels.\n\nHis early life was shaped by exposure to other cultures. His father’s international non-profit work led Jim and the family to spend a year in Switzerland when he was in middle school and a year in India in high school. Jim attended the College of Wooster and spent his junior year of college in Ghana immediately following Ghana’s independence from Britain. He climbed mountains and whitewater rafted in Nepal, Tanzania, and North Carolina. His daughters’ childhoods were made richer by his stories (and slideshows) of his many adventures.\n\nJim became politically engaged while pursuing his PhD in medical sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he led the student organizing effort to repeal the Speaker Ban Law. He was also an active member of Students for a Democratic Society. He remained politically active throughout his life, particularly around feminist and environmental issues, attending marches in Washington DC and locally, donating to progressive political candidates, and keeping up on current events.\n\nEarly in his career Jim taught sociology at Lake Forest College (Lake Forest, IL) and at Meharry Medical College (Nashville, TN). He then focused his career on graduate medical education at teaching hospitals such as Mt Sinai Medical Center (New York, NY), Winthrop University Hospital (Mineaola, NY), Jersey Shore Medical Center (Neptune, NJ) and Inova Fairfax Hospital (Falls Church, VA). He was especially proud to be a pioneer in training doctors on how to talk to patients about sexuality.\n\nAfter Jim’s first marriage to Christine Hasenmueller ended in 1975, he married Jan Kline and they started a family together on Long Island, NY. Although he didn’t become a parent until age 45, becoming a dad brought out his youthful side. He was a wonderful, playful, and engaged dad. He entertained his daughters Charlotte and Hunter over long car rides with stories and songs, read them books, took them on adventures, and provided an example of gentle, steady, and tender parenting that they both model in their own parenting today.\n\nJim moved to central New Jersey after his divorce from Jan in 1995 and began to build the relationships that would define the final decades of his life. He worked on local environmental rights issues through Citizens for Informed Land Use, picketed for abortion access, helped preserve the famous Eero Saarinen Bell Labs building from demolition, and dug deep into many precious friendships. He was an involved member of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Monmouth County, at times chairing the Social Action Committee and the Dialog Committee. It was through UUCMC that he met his wife and the love of his life, Elizabeth Spellman Dean.\n\nLiz and Jim first lived together in a house that Jim passionately renovated, incorporating elements of his favorite architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. They then moved into Liz’s 1840s farmhouse in Holmdel, NJ, which they enjoyed together until they moved to Shadow Lake Village in Red Bank in 2015. In all of these homes they loved hosting friends and family, gardening, cooking, and bird watching.\n\nIn his retirement Jim started practicing qi gong and quickly decided to become an instructor. He credited qi gong with keeping him healthy through his 60s, 70s, and early 80s. He practiced every day, usually outdoors, and he loved sharing qi gong with friends and family. He taught for many years at senior centers, cancer survivor groups, parks, and around the pool at the McCorkel Tree Farm. During his treatment for stomach cancer in 2017, he practiced qi gong during his chemo infusions.\n\nHe loved visiting with family in Cape May Point, Maine, Nova Scotia, Boston, Vermont, Philadelphia, Central PA, Seattle, Pasadena, and Colorado. Vibrant and delicious family gatherings always included walks, arts, cooking, reading, spending time in nature, and doing qi gong together.\n\nFor all of his adventures, Jim was a creature of habit. He ate cereal with blueberries every morning for breakfast. He ate salad with lunch and dinner every day. He went for a long walk every day the weather allowed and often spent his walks catching up with his sisters or daughters over the phone. He had a predictable sweet tooth and a secret chocolate stash. He valued simple living. He had a relentless optimism that carried him through life’s challenges with a contagious upbeat attitude.\n\nJim was an exceptionally lovely man. We are fortunate to have had him in our lives.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Liz Dean; his sisters Mary Lou Rozdilsky and Betty Ann Jansson; his daughters Charlotte McCorkel and Hunter McCorkel; Liz’s children Debby Dean, David Dean, Abby Dean, and Libby Dean; and their families.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Monmouth County in Lincroft, NJ, on April 6, 2024, at 2pm.\n\nDr. Stephen “Steve” McClellan, 83, of The Villages, Florida, died peacefully on Saturday, July 15, 2023, under Hospice care with his wife, Jill, by his side. Steve was born February 12, 1940, in Fostoria, Ohio, to Charles and Faye McClellan. A stand-out student-athlete, Steve lettered in multiple sports at Fostoria High School and went on to play baseball and football at The College of Wooster. For many years, Steve was the all-time leading rusher for the Scots and was inducted into The College of Wooster Hall of Fame in 1974. It was in Wooster that Steve met the love of his life, Jill. They were married in 1962 and celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary in June. Steve completed his Doctorate in Higher Education at Michigan State University in 1967 and then began his first career working in University Administration at several higher education institutions, including Tulane University, University of Texas, and Florida State University. Steve and Jill returned to their Ohio roots and moved their family to Findlay in 1979 where they owned and operated Indian Lake Manor which began Steve’s second career in Health Care Administration. He would go on to work in a number of hospital systems including Mount Carmel in Columbus, Ohio, Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens, New York, and Kalida Health in Buffalo, New York. Steve and Jill initially retired to Apple Valley in Howard, Ohio, before moving to The Villages, Florida. For Steve, family was everything and he was the biggest fan of his children, Scott, Chad and Robyn; never missing an athletic game or dance recital. Regardless of the event, Steve was always there supporting and encouraging his kids. Steve was a lifelong learner and a voracious reader. From history to business, fiction to nonfiction, Steve could always be found with his beloved books and paper and pen by his side. He was a great writer of poetry, having many poems published in The Villages Daily Sun newspaper. Jill was his favorite muse and the inspiration for many of his poems and writings throughout his life. Left to forever cherish Steve’s memory are his wife, Jill; son, Scott (Melinda) McClellan of Hillard, Ohio; son, Chad (Melissa) McClellan of Tallahassee, Florida; daughter, Robyn McClellan of Seaford, New York; grandchildren, Devon McClellan, Kayla McClellan, Graham McClellan, all of Hilliard, Ohio; Cole Hennessy and Braden Hennessy both of Seaford, New York. Steve was preceded in death by his parents and sister Bonnie Mutzabaugh. A Celebration of Life will be planned for the near future.\n\nRobert (Bob) M. Weinberg passed away peacefully with loving family around him on June 17, 2022 in Seattle, Washington. Bob crept into retirement starting with his move to Seattle in 2003. While most of his Seattle time was spent in a volunteer capacity working on various civic issues, he could be referred to as the ‘Sentry’ for the universal public good. Bob was a man of extraordinary talent whose professional career, supported by his MBA and JD from Harvard, was primarily in Boston. He did however, begin his public service career working at the Executive Office of the President under the Johnson Administration. When that assignment was complete, he moved to Boston and became the head of the public policy staff of former mayor, Kevin White. Bob used his keen strategic instinct and progressive values to skillfully navigate between the political and business worlds of the city. He continued to serve Boston as the Founding Director of Public Management and professor at Boston University. Before leaving BU, Michael Dukakis appointed him as Chair of the Massport Board. But perhaps one of his most lasting legacies will be Post Office Square Park, an urban oasis for the enhancement of the urban public realm. The qualities that once made him one of the city’s most impactful civic leaders remain in abundance. If one visits Boston and “take(s) a walk downtown, through the Leventhal Post Office Square Park, to the concessions at the restored South Station and then across the Seaport District to the harbor, with Logan Airport in the distance, you would be experiencing the work of many people, but much of it exists because of the inspiration and drive of one man: Bob Weinberg”, as written by author, James Aloisi. Post Office Square could be thought of as Bob’s signature piece in his immense professional portfolio. Bob was the first president of Friends of Post Office Square, a position he held for 22 years. During that time, he became involved with the national organization, City Parks Alliance, and served in various Board positions. In recognition of his many years of service and his personal commitment to improving urban communities through parks and green space, the Alliance has created the Robert Weinberg Scholarship at City Parks Alliance for a graduate-level student majoring in urban policy with applicants drawn from universities through the US including HBCUs. This will make it possible for the scholarship recipient to attend the Greater & Greener 2024 conference in Seattle. It’s yet again, an example of his legacy living on. Bob is survived by his loving wife, Jeannie Butler, daughter Katy Weinberg, son David Weinberg, and daughter by marriage, Jill Butler. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him but his influence will be felt by many for years to come. A private Celebration of Life will be held in Boston at a later date.\n\nRachel Eby, 89, died in her sleep at the Wake Robin retirement community in Shelburne on Tuesday, June 20, 2023. She was born on July 28, 1933, in North Adams, Mass., to Edward Morris Collins and Francis Fairley Collins. She was the middle of three daughters who were followed by a son. Her father was a college professor who built a camp on Crescent Beach at Lake Willoughby the year she was born. Rachel was predeceased by her parents; her older sister, Ann; and Ann’s daughter, Susan. She is survived by her husband, John Eby; her younger sister, Mary Collins Eby (married to one of John’s brothers); her brother, Donald Collins; her five children, Kenneth Mitchell-Eby of Barton; Eileen Eby of Daventry, United Kingdom, Paul Eby of Powhatan, Va., Eric Eby of Amesbury, Mass., and Brian Eby of Haverhill, Mass.; five grandchildren; and numerous nieces and nephews. Rachel graduated from high school in Granville, Ohio, where her father was teaching at Denison University, and then entered Wooster College in Wooster in the Class of 1954. There she majored in biology and played French horn in the marching band where she met John Eby. They were married at the end of their junior year, taking advantage of married student quarters on campus, which were no longer in use by students in the GI Bill of Rights. The next year she was invited to the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated with high honors. Her graduation gown served well as a maternity outfit, and Kenneth was born in July. The next five years were spent in Rochester, N.Y., where John worked on a doctorate in physics and Rachel produced two more children. Then they rented a house in Marblehead, Mass., for a year while John went to work for Sylvania Lighting Products. They bought a house in Ipswich, Mass., the next year where they lived for 37 years. Two more children were born, the last on New Year’s Day in 1965. Rachel joined the church choir in Ipswich and started taking singing lessons from a local teacher. A little while later she joined the Tanglewood Chorus, the vocal music branch of the Boston Symphony. She was dropped after three years because her voice didn’t blend well with the other singers and was advised to study with a professional singer. So, she did, and she joined the Newburyport Choral Society, a large local community chorus, and Cantemus, a serious vocal ensemble. For the rest of her life singing was a passion and she was an outstanding member of community choruses and church choirs wherever the family lived. In Ipswich she also served as a Sunday school teacher and a group leader for Brownies as well as knitting and taking up quilting in a serious way. After enjoying the Collins family camp on Lake Willoughby almost every year of her life, in 1991 she fulfilled a long-time desire to own property in Vermont when a renovated farmhouse from the 1840s came on the market in Irasburg. This was used for weekends and vacations, particularly when Rachel joined the annual celebration of music at the Barton United Church. When John retired from Sylvania in 1997, the couple moved to Irasburg house, and in 1998 the house in Ipswich was sold. In 2006 the decision was made move to Wake Robin in Shelburne. The pattern for the next 12 years was six summer months spent in Irasburg, followed by six months as snowbirds in Wake Robin. In Irasburg, Rachel continued to participate in church work and choir at the Barton Community Church. She also worked with the Northeast Kingdom Chorus and the Old Stone House Museum as well as creating a torrent of knitting, quilt design and construction projects. At Wake Robin she joined the chorus, enjoyed English country dancing, took oil painting classes and worked with the fiber arts committee on knitting and quilting projects. On two occasions she had a show of her quilts on the walls of the Gentry Gallery. She also sang in the Shelburne Methodist Church choir and participated in worship and study there. The loss of her memory was a decades-long process and testing showed no medical causes other than senile dementia, with no path to recovery. Gradually she was stripped of the experiences of a lifetime and of her artistic outlets until all she had left was her voice and her memory of tunes that let her participate in singalongs. For the last four years of her life, she was confined to Wake Robin’s memory care unit where the constant care and attention of the staff was marvelous, particularly through the time of the COVID-19 epidemic. She died just three days before her 70th wedding anniversary and now is waiting, with her personality restored, for the remainder of the family to join her. Celebrations of her life will be held on Saturday, July 29, 2023, at 1 p.m. in the Barton United Church, as well as on Sunday, Aug. 6, 2023, at 2 p.m. in the meeting room at the community center of Wake Robin in Shelburne. All are welcome, and donations in lieu of flowers can be made to Doctors Without Borders.\n\nAnne Willson Eubank Jolliff\n\nFacilitator, Appreciator Extraordinaire!\n\nAnne Willson Eubank Jolliff was born on September 19, 1935 to missionary parents in Chefoo, China. Her family returned to the United States two years later and she spent her childhood as the daughter of a preacher in a series of West Texas towns including Coleman and Menard. She walked roof-tops with her brother, nailed her sundress to a sandbox, and spent her summers living on the Eubank family ranch in Brown County where she taught herself how to drive on the long, narrow dirt lane that led in from the highway. She wasn’t allowed to pull out onto the main road, so boy, could she drive backward!\n\nAnne (with an “e”) attended Brownwood High School for two years, and in 1951, at the age of 15 she took a solo train trip across the country to Massachusetts to attend boarding school at Northfield.\n\nShe went on to get a Bachelor’s degree in Geology from the College of Wooster in Ohio. While serving on the student council there, she met James Walter Jolliff, a theater major, who quickly switched majors to pre-med to be a more “eligible” suitor. The two married in 1957 and continued to live in Ohio where Anne got her Masters in Education from Case Western Reserve and taught 4th grade in Cleveland as Jim completed medical school training.\n\nThe couple moved to San Diego, California where Anne had their first son, David, in 1965. She almost, but didn’t quite, lose the stroller down the big hill that led to the ocean. Two years later, they moved to Waco, Texas to be near Anne’s parents, her brother, and their beloved family ranch near Brownwood.\n\nAnne had a second son, Rob, in 1967 and a daughter, Jenny, three years later. By then, she’d already become an active parent volunteer at St. Paul’s Episcopal School. She spent her spare evening hours sewing or perusing AAA maps and tour books, plotting out the two-week family driving vacations which took the Jolliffs to all but a handful of states over the course of a dozen years.\n\nWhen her children moved on to Vanguard Preparatory School, Anne’s energy went with them. She served on the board for many years, including as the head of the Chairperson. In her iconic green (and then yellow) Suburban, she became the much loved unofficial bus driver of countless soccer teams, the Lady Vikings basketball team, and the German Exchange Students.\n\nAnne was a genuine appreciator and supporter of Waco’s performing arts, regularly attending plays, musicals and symphony performances at MCC, the Civic Theater, and Baylor University. For more than two decades following Jim’s death in 1993, she volunteered as a docent at the Art Center Waco, The Mayborn Museum, and the Historic Village. She was also a “hard hat” supporter of the Cameron Park Zoo during many phases of its construction.\n\nAnne loved to travel. Her globe-trotting journeys with her family and friends took her to five continents and more than three dozen countries including England, India, Chile, Norway, Estonia, Morocco, Switzerland, and, of course, China. She came home with folk art and beads to decorate her walls, and filled album after album with collages of photos from her travels.\n\nMost summers, Anne attended a week-long field school dig sponsored by the Texas Archaeology Society. She delighted in conjecture and speculation, and especially loved to engage young people in mind-bending conversations about books, natural history, and the universal “what if?”\n\nWorking with complex spatial relationships came easily to Anne, and she gladly shared her architectural enthusiasm and skills with friends and family. In the 70’s she designed an addition to her own house on Chateau Avenue and remodeled every room to have tons of built-in cabinetry and shelving. She moved on to design a new second floor for her parents’ ranch house plus two remodels for her friends down the street. In the 80’s, she was a key figure in the designing of the Mayborn and Jaworsky Center buildings on the Vanguard campus, and when her son, Rob, built his house a decade later, she was right there, ready to pore over possible layouts with him.\n\nAnne prided herself on her ability to “whip around” and get things done. She mowed her own lawn, cleaned her own gutters, trimmed her own bushes, and used her carpentry skills to build both bookshelves and the attics in which to put them! She had an absolutely astounding ability to sew anything she could imagine. From curtains, bedspreads, pillows, and stuffed animals to tailored suits, formal dresses, Halloween costumes, and reupholstered armchairs, nothing was beyond her. In fact, only a few weeks before she passed, the two most precious things she wanted from her old apartment were her Singer Featherweight sewing machine and her bucket of tools!\n\nFamily was always Anne’s priority. She fully embraced her role as “Grannie Annie,” caring for her granddaughters, Emily, Brooke, and Rebecca, many days a week for years and visiting Springer, her grandson in Alaska, every chance she got. She became a second mother to many friends and neighbors as well. Children were always welcome in her yard, in her house, and in her cookie cans (which was a good thing because she had an insatiable sweet tooth and needed their help depleting the resources).\n\nAnne Jolliff died peacefully of natural causes Wednesday, January 3, 2024. We’ve all been so fortunate to have her facilitating and appreciating the good things in our lives. Let’s picture her now, off on her next great adventure, steering her celestial Suburban through the sky!\n\nAnne’s ashes will be strewn in the bluebonnets on the “Aunt Hill” at the family ranch this spring.\n\nAnne was preceded in death by her brother, Joseph Broocke Eubank last fall; and her husband, James Walter Jolliff. She is survived by her son, David Broocke Jolliff, his wife, Kerri (Missy) Bullard Jolliff, and granddaughter Brooke Bailey Jolliff; son Robert Bransford Jolliff, his wife, Michelle Myers Jolliff, and granddaughters Emily Anne Jolliff and Rebecca Marie Jolliff; daughter Jennifer Anne Jolliff, her partner, Ian Moore and grandson, Springer Fenn Moore; and her brother-in-law, David Llewellen Reed.\n\nPlease visit this link to see more photos of Anne and add some of your own!\n\nJudith (Judy) Cornell McFarland was born on December 10, 1942 in Glens Falls, New York and died on September 7, 2023 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nJudy was the only child of Richard (Doug) Walter Cornell and Ruth Colvin Cornell. Although her parents were not college educated, they worked in payroll management and bookkeeping and encouraged their daughter to pursue higher education. Her parents’ love of numbers and order rubbed off, and she graduated from the College of Wooster with a degree in mathematics. She met her husband, James (Jim) Thomas McFarland, at the College of Wooster, and they married on June 13, 1964.\n\nBefore she became a mother, Judy worked as a math teacher to support her husband’s graduate education. Once her children were of school age, she returned to part-time teaching as a substitute teacher, math lab coordinator, tutor, and adjunct university instructor. She loved helping people overcome the fear of math and gain confidence in their ability to calculate percentages, make sense of word problems, and solve for the value of x.\n\nWhen her husband of twenty-five years died in 1990, she went back to school to get a master’s degree in computer science. She built a second career for herself with ProServices, a medical billing firm. She retired early, at 63, and that second career provided her with financial security for the rest of her life.\n\nAs a mother, Judy nurtured, protected, and proudly loved her children. She helped them with homework, baked them the best chocolate chip cookies in the world, taught them to drive, and walked with them as they faced the ups and downs of their lives as adults. Judy considered her children to be her greatest legacy.\n\nJudy loved travel, particularly long adventures by train. She loved the beauty of the Oregon coast. She loved talking with her friends and entertaining acquaintances with her sharp wit. She loved to read and think. And as evidenced by her interest in everything from hybrid vehicles to sock knitting, she loved learning. She loathed bad grammar and the film The Wizard of Oz.\n\nJudy is survived by her daughter Colleen Rademaker and son-in-law Robert Rademaker of Bowie, Maryland; her son Kevin McFarland-Porter and daughter-in-law Theresa McFarland-Porter of Rochester, New York; and by three grandchildren David, of Denver, Colorado, Ross, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Elizabeth of Vienna, Virginia.\n\nHer family is particularly grateful for her companion and helper, Christa Runde, and for Susan Borkowsky at Alexian Village who helped her to maintain as much of her fierce independence as possible in her later years as she encountered more health challenges.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held on Saturday, October 28 at 11:00 AM at Immanuel Presbyterian Church, 1100 N. Astor St., Milwaukee, WI 53202. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial contributions to Immanuel Presbyterian Church or Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.\n\nRonald Edwin Youngberg, Jr., 55, of Phoenix, AZ, passed away unexpectedly at home on March 26, 2023. He was born in Chicago, IL, and grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago where he graduated from Carmel High School in Mundelein, IL, in 1985. He attended the College of Wooster in Wooster, OH, before heading west to Arizona in 1988. While in high school, one of his first jobs was working for a local catering company, and upon arrival in Arizona, he started his long career in the food and beverage industry where he made many life-long friends. Over the course of his career, he worked at many different establishments/companies around the Valley as well as in Nevada and California, including Minder Binders, Rockin’ Rodeo, R.T. O’Sullivan’s, Mickey’s Hangout, Iguana Mack’s, Coach & Willie’s, Kona Grill, SOL Mexican Cocina and Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar. Most recently, after a break from the industry during COVID, he was happy to be back doing what he loves with the opportunity at Bourbon and Bones.\n\nRon’s life-long passion was cooking; he was always trying new recipes or spice rubs or cooking techniques. He could take a taste of something and name what spices were in it or tell you what to add to improve it. In recent years, he added smoking meats and baking to his repertoire, though he still considered the original Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies the best dessert! If you were lucky enough to have Ron cook for you, you knew you were in for a treat. It wasn’t a family birthday celebration without “Ron’s perfect steak,” and his chimichurri sauce was a Christmas specialty. A family tradition was trying to stump Ron each year with a new Christmas cooking tool—he usually won!\n\nRon was a loyal friend and was always very focused on helping others. During his high school years, he volunteered at the local hospital, and he completed his service project to meet the requirements to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout from the Boys Scouts of America. He supported various causes over the years, including volunteering at food pantries, participating in walk-a-thons, and often raising funds for different charities, including various military causes to support our veterans.\n\nDespite living in Arizona since 1988, Ron was a die-hard Chicago sports fan, always rooting for Da Bears, Da Cubs, Da Bulls and Da Blackhawks, though he did enjoy attending a few Phoenix Rising matches with his friends.\n\nRon is survived by his sisters Carole Youngberg, Paula Webb (James) and Patricia Andrew (William), nieces Kathryn Andrew and Kelly Andrew, and nephew William Andrew Jr., as well as his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins. He was preceded in death by his parents Ronald and Rosalin Youngberg. Services will be private. A Celebration of Life will be planned in the future. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to one of the many charities Ron supported over the years, including: Breast Cancer Research Foundation (www.bcrf.org), Pat Tillman Foundation (www.pattillmanfoundation.org), or St. Mary’s Food Bank (www.firstfoodbank.org). And the next time you’re eating out at a local restaurant, please raise a glass to Ron. Godspeed, Ron.\n\nCynthia (Jean) Rice Chase, 82, of Laurel, Maryland, passed away peacefully at her home on June 11, 2023, after a long illness. Her devoted and loving husband and daughters were at her side.\n\nCynthia was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, to Mary Faber White and Kenneth William Rice on August 22, 1940, the oldest of two daughters. From age 11, she was raised by her father and his second wife, Mary Thelma Rice.\n\nIn 1962, Cynthia earned a degree in English from the College of Wooster in Ohio, where her future husband, Phillip John Chase, was also a student. They were married July 14, 1962, at Stone United Methodist Church in Meadville. Daughter Margaret Lucetta was born in 1963 in Pasadena, California. Daughter Rebecca Lynn was born in 1966 in Wooster, Ohio. In 1967, the family settled in Laurel, where Phil had taken a position with the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nIn 1981, Cynthia also joined NSA as a Japanese linguist, after amassing 60 credits of language and economics courses while caring for her young daughters. She served in that role for 25 years. In the 1990s, she joined St. Philip’s Episcopal Church, where she sang alto in the choir; volunteered for Winterhaven, a faith-based homeless shelter; taught Sunday school; helped organize and teach at Camp St. Philip’s; and assisted with the church’s annual Main Street Festival Book Sale and Holly Days Bazaar. She was also a dedicated volunteer at Laurel Advocacy and Referral Services (LARS) for many years. As a champion for the mentally ill, those with autism, and the most vulnerable in society, she supported many charities and causes throughout her life.\n\nCynthia and Phil were married for more than 60 years and were each other’s best friend and constant companions. They enjoyed walking their dogs, traveling, planting roadside flowers, Polka and square dancing, and playing Wordle together. They also often visited the Chase family farm to enjoy the beautiful surroundings, hiking, and reunions with relatives and friends. With their daughters’ families, they regularly celebrated family birthdays, special occasions, and holidays and vacationed in Lewes, Delaware and Maine. Cynthia was especially close to and spent a lot of time with her oldest grandson, Andrew, whom she often tutored after school.\n\nCynthia was a voracious reader and maintained detailed journals throughout her life. She loved to write letters, short stories, and poems including haikus, some of which were published. She maintained two blogs for years, “And Deliver Us from Meadville” and “Life in Merlin,” which had loyal followings. Her entries were filled with humor, wit, and interesting stories about everyday life. She also enjoyed playing the piano and was interested in almost everything, including history, current events, social justice, civil rights, environmental issues, folklore and culture, religion, politics, language and literature, and music. Her love of music included many types, from Appalachian folk and bluegrass to international, classical, and choral music (especially King’s College Choir).\n\nHer family and friends remember her as a thoughtful and private person, brilliant, funny and fun to be around, generous, and principled. She was known for her unusually clever puns and mastery of word games and puzzles but never one to “toot her own horn.” She was beloved and will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nCynthia is survived by her devoted and adoring husband, Phil, and daughters, Margo (Michael) Rice and Becky (Thomas) Fowler; grandchildren, Andrew Rice and Nathaniel and Mariel Fowler; sister, Barbara Rice (Ronald) Moline, and two half-sisters Cecilia (Azzam) Muhanna and Margaret (Russell) Taylor; sister-in-law, Cathryn (Stanley) Piekarski; numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins; and many friends.

A devoted father, grandfather, husband, friend, civil rights activist, and acclaimed professor of Sociology at St. Lawrence University passed away peacefully in Sarasota, FL on August 2, 2023 at the age of 90.\n\nOne of four children of the late Frederic and Mildred Hills, Stuart was predeceased by his wife of 61 years Wilma, and is survived by his sons Darrick (Mary Ann Schoenberger), Marc and Michael (Laura McDonald), five grandchildren: Samuel, Elizabeth, Bridget, Matthew, Zaeda, and one great grandchild, Piper.\n\nBorn and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Stuart spent most summers as a child with his beloved aunt and uncle in Vermont. After high school, Stuart found his way to Ohio where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from the College of Wooster in 1955. It was at Wooster where he first met Wilma during an orientation exam when he asked his future wife to borrow a pencil. Years later it was revealed to his boys that their father had purposely broken his pencil as a ruse to speak with the lovely Wilma Smith. Stuart would go on to earn his Master’s and PhD in Sociology at Indiana University. Stuart held part-time teaching positions at Central Michigan University and Indiana, and became a father for the first time.\n\nIn 1962, a full time position in the sociology department became available at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio where Stuart threw himself into his teaching, scholarly research, and raising three active sons. In 1971, Stuart accepted a faculty position at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York where he was honored with multiple teaching awards, wrote four books in the fields of Criminology and Sociology, and served both the St. Lawrence and Canton communities with distinction until his retirement in 1994. During his tenure at St. Lawrence, Stuart was able to bring his family on his sabbaticals, including memorable stays in Seattle and at the American University in Leysin, Switzerland where he shared with his wife and young sons many memorable experiences in the Swiss Alps, as well as in France and Italy. A lover of sports throughout his life, Stuart was a constant presence at St. Lawrence hockey, football, and basketball games, and was always willing to let his three sons tag along.\n\nStuart was at his best in the classroom where he thrived as a teacher and is still fondly remembered by his former students for his engaging lectures and for occasionally arriving to class in costume and beginning his lecture in full character.\n\nDuring Stuart’s time in northern New York, he was able to embrace his love of nature and the outdoors with frequent family snowshoeing, cross country skiing, sailing, canoeing, hiking, and camping trips in and around the Adirondack mountains. In retirement, Stuart focused his energies on wood carving and became a highly skilled carver with a special affinity for bird and holiday carvings. Stuart also took on the challenge of learning the craft of building wooden boats and successfully built a beautiful wooden Adirondack canoe and a sailboat that he affectionately named the Little Green Heron.\n\nAfter enduring the cold winters of the North Country for over two decades, Stuart and Wilma moved to Sarasota, FL to enjoy the sun and warmth on the Gulf Coast. Stuart was active with the Sarasota Sailing Squadron; he continued to enjoy his carving hobbies while also volunteering at the Pelican Man’s Bird Sanctuary and the Sarasota Audubon Nature Center where he served as a docent and authored “Birding Hotspots of Sarasota” so he could share his love of birding with the greater Sarasota community. Sarasota also proved to be a great starting point for the many cruises that he and Wilma enjoyed over their retirement years as well as a perfect vacation spot for visits by his children and grandchildren.\n\nStuart is greatly missed by his family, his former students and faculty colleagues, and the many friends that he made during his remarkably well-lived and impactful life. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be directed to the Sarasota Audubon Celery Fields Nature Center at sarasotaaudubon.org.\n\nMarie passed away early Monday morning July 10, 2023, at Harbor View Cottage, where she had spent the last 4 years. with the care givers who loved her. Her time with Alzheimer’s finally over.\n\nMarie’s career spanned 28 years with Time/Life, except time off to live in Greece for a time, from Researcher to Picture Editor of Life Magazine. A time she treasured.\n\nMarie loved animals, especially horses and her beloved cats, probably more than humans. However, her empathy and love of good friends and family was inspiring.\n\nIn the summer months she could always be found in her garden.\n\nWanting to give back in her retirement years she spent several years with Freedom Riders helping challenged children and adults to ride horses.\n\nEveryone Marie touched was made better for it. As her nephew said to me “Words fail to describe the beauty and joy Marie brought to all our lives, making us richer, happier and more fulfilled for knowing and loving her.”\n\nShe and Peter sailed together for many years, and both agreed it was one of the very best things they did. The times of pure beauty with sailing friends was priceless. In sailing they discovered Maine.\n\nMarie is survived her husband Peter, sister Nancy, Sister-in-law Anne and nephews Will, Brian and Gordon.\n\nNo memorial service is planned. Memorial contributions in her honor can be made in Marie’s name to the Alzheimer’s Association."
