        "text": "AKA Robert William Hoskins Jr.\n\nBorn: 26-Oct-1942\n\nBirthplace: Bury St. Edmund's, Suffolk, England\n\nDied: 29-Apr-2014\n\nLocation of death: London, England\n\nCause of death: Pneumonia\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: England\n\nExecutive summary: Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\n\nBob Hoskins quit school at 15, and to support himself he worked as a window cleaner, truck driver, steeplejack, merchant seaman, circus performer, ditch-digger, commercial artist, and accountant. He spent two years in Syria living amongst Bedouin tribes. He said that he became an actor accidentally, in 1968, after several drinks in a British pub.\n\nHis first marriage ended in divorce when Hoskins had an affair. When the divorce was finalized in 1978, Hoskins was left with nothing, and had a nervous breakdown. At rock bottom, he lived in his Jeep, but rock bottom didn't last long. His 1980 role as a British gangster in The Long Good Friday with Helen Mirren made him a star. His films include Mona Lisa with Michael Caine, and Terry Gilliam's classic nightmare Brazil. Hoskins has also earned good reviews playing J. Edgar Hoover, Nikita Khrushchev, Benito Mussolini, and Manuel Noriega, but he remains best known for co-starring with cartoons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.\n\nFather: Robert Hoskins Sr. (bookkeeper)\n\nMother: Elsie (German gypsy, nursery school teacher, d. 1995)\n\nWife: Jane Livesey (teacher, m. 1967, div. 1978, one son, one daughter)\n\nSon: Alex\n\nDaughter: Sarah\n\nWife: Linda Banwell (teacher, m. 1982, until his death, one daughter, one son)\n\nDaughter: Rosa (b. 1985)\n\nSon: Jack (b. 1986)\n\nHigh School: Stroud Green School, London (dropped out)\n\nNervous Breakdown 1978\n\nRisk Factors: Dyslexia, Parkinson's\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS DIRECTOR\n\nRainbow (7-Dec-1995)\n\nThe Raggedy Rawney (10-Sep-1988)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nSnow White and the Huntsman (30-May-2012) · Muir\n\nNeverland (4-Dec-2011)\n\nMade in Dagenham (2-Sep-2010) · Albert\n\nA Christmas Carol (3-Nov-2009) · Fezziwig, Old Joe\n\nDoomsday (14-Mar-2008)\n\nRuby Blue (Oct-2007) · Jack\n\nGo Go Tales (23-May-2007)\n\nOutlaw (24-Feb-2007)\n\nSparkle (9-Feb-2007)\n\nThe Wind in the Willows (18-Dec-2006) · Badger\n\nHollywoodland (31-Aug-2006) · Edgar Mannix\n\nGarfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (15-Jun-2006) [VOICE]\n\nParis, je t'aime (18-May-2006)\n\nStay (24-Sep-2005)\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents (9-Sep-2005)\n\nSon of the Mask (11-Feb-2005)\n\nUnleashed (2-Feb-2005)\n\nBeyond the Sea (11-Sep-2004) · Charlie Cassotto Maffia\n\nVanity Fair (1-Sep-2004) · Sir Pitt Crawley\n\nDen of Lions (13-May-2003) · Darius Paskevic\n\nThe Sleeping Dictionary (31-Jan-2003)\n\nMaid in Manhattan (13-Dec-2002) · Lionel Bloch\n\nWhere Eskimos Live (11-Jan-2002)\n\nThe Lost World (25-Dec-2001)\n\nLast Orders (10-Sep-2001)\n\nEnemy at the Gates (7-Feb-2001)\n\nDon Quixote (9-Apr-2000)\n\nNoriega: God's Favorite (4-Mar-2000)\n\nAmerican Virgin (11-Feb-2000)\n\nDavid Copperfield (25-Dec-1999)\n\nThe White River Kid (12-Nov-1999) · Brother Edgar\n\nA Room for Romeo Brass (23-Aug-1999)\n\nCaptain Jack (28-May-1999)\n\nFelicia's Journey (May-1999)\n\nParting Shots (18-Mar-1999)\n\nCousin Bette (12-Jun-1998)\n\nSpice World (15-Dec-1997) · Himself\n\nTwentyFourSeven (31-Aug-1997)\n\nMichael (25-Dec-1996)\n\nThe Secret Agent (7-Sep-1996) · Verloc\n\nBalto (22-Dec-1995) · Boris [VOICE]\n\nNixon (20-Dec-1995) · J.
