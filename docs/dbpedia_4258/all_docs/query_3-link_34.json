        "text": "Robert “Bob” Hoskins was born to Joe and Eva Mae (Lattimore) Hoskins on July 7, 1931. He was preceded through heaven’s gates by his wife of 62 years, Catherine D. (Jones) Hoskins, and his parents and siblings—Joe, Al, Donald, Hazel, Delores and Edith.\n\nBob, a skilled athlete, attended Dunbar High School, where, along with his teammates, he led their school to numerous victories. His athletic prowess earned him a place in their Athletic Hall of Fame, as well as a full athletic basketball scholarship to Southern University in Baton Rouge, LA, where he also pledged Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. His greatest college feat was capturing the heart of a beautiful young woman named Catherine D. Jones, who became his best friend, wife and lifelong partner of 62 years. Following his graduation, he was called to active service in the United States Army, where he faithfully served from 1953 to 1956, achieving the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Upon his honorable discharge, he returned home to his adoring wife, “Cat,” whom he happily loved and served.\n\nTogether, this dynamic duo travelled the Midwest and beyond, visiting family, vacationing with friends, and attending local high school and college sporting events. With fondness, Bob recently recalled his many adventures with Cat: “We did everything together.” They not only played together but they prayed and served together at Wayman AME church in Dayton, OH, where Bob also served as a deacon. Bob’s heart of service extended beyond his home and church into his professional career, where he worked as the Athletic Director and baseball coach at Central State University and enjoyed a longtime career as an administrator within the YMCA of Dayton, OH, until he retired in 1989.\n\nBob’s life is replete with numerous athletic, civic and professional accomplishments, but his most important accomplishment is the countless lives he touched and the enduring legacy he leaves. Proverbs 22:1 reminds us that a good name is to be more desired than great wealth and also states that favor is better than silver and gold. No one exemplified kindness, generosity, service and a good name better than Bob. His niece said, “Uncle Bob is the only person in the world who ends every sentence with a chuckle!”\n\nThe Hoskins home will always be remembered as a home of Christian love and respite from the cares of life—a home whose sole purpose was to celebrate the accomplishments, milestones and precious moments of others. All who entered felt welcomed and special— the sojourner felt restored and those in need never left empty-handed.\n\nUncle Bob completed his earthly assignment and joined Cat in heaven on October 15, 2020, in Alton, IL, where had recently relocated. He leaves to cherish his memory special nephews and nieces, numerous relatives and lifelong friends. We will all miss Bob’s distinctive smile, one-of-a-kind laugh, sports-related conversations, breakfasts at Bob Evans and his love. There will never be another Uncle Bob.\n\nIn an effort to curtail the spread of COVID-19, a private family committal service will be held at Woodland Mausoleum.\n\nTo further celebrate his legacy, the family is creating a special memorial video. Please share your favorite photo or upload a brief video of your favorite “Bob” memory. This will make an unforgettable gift to those who loved him dearly.
