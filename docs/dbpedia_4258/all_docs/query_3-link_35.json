        "text": "A child star at 13 in Steven Spielberg’s soaring war story ‘Empire of the Sun’, Christian Bale’s career seemed to be petering out before he was perfectly cast as the preening, murderous anti-hero of ‘American Psycho’. The lead role in Christopher Nolan’s ‘Dark Knight’ trilogy has made him a huge international star.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Empire of the Sun’, ‘American Psycho’, ‘Batman Begins’\n\nNeed someone to pop their clogs midway through your megabudget fantasy adventure? Call Sean Bean! Whether it’s dying in a hail of arrows in ‘The Lord of the Rings’, by an executioner’s blade in ‘Game of Thrones’ or clinging to life as a half-man, half-honeybee mutant in ‘Jupiter Ascending’, Sheffield’s finest never disappoints.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring’, ‘Caravaggio’\n\nWith high-cringe docu-comedies like Borat and Bruno – not to mention Da Ali G Show, which began on Channel 4 in the UK before moving to HBO in the states – Cohen turned pranksterism into art, disappearing into utterly ridiculous characters yet committing to them so fully he’s managed to fool everyone from Donald Trump to Rudy Giuliani. (Okay, not the highest of bars there, but still: impressive.) But in films like Hugo and The Trial of the Chicago 7, he’s proven that his acting chops translate to more traditional features. If he’d stuck with Bohemian Rhapsody, he’d have an Oscar by now. No worries, though: he’ll probably get one soon enough.\n\nYears active: 1990s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Borat’, 'Bruno', ‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’\n\nIt’s depressingly rare for an actress to find a bounty of great roles in their forties. Happily, Olivia Colman has had just that. From her fabulously capricious, gouty queen in ‘The Favourite’, to an altogether more reserved monarch in ‘The Crown’, to her gut-punch dementia drama ‘The Father’ and motherhood memoir ‘The Lost Daughter’, the roles keep getting better – and so does she. The awards will keep coming too, which is fine by us. Her acceptance speeches are magnificent.\n\nYears active: 2000 to now\n\nKey films: ‘Tyrannosaur’, ‘The Favourite’, ‘The Lost Daughter’\n\nFrom Glasgow milkman to one of the biggest British actors in the known universe, Sean Connery succeeded through sheer determination and bolshiness. Still the fans’ favourite James Bond, he exuded predatory sexiness in the role – but balanced such flashy blockbusters with ‘serious’ performances in the likes of ‘The Hill’ and Hitchcock’s ‘Marnie’.\n\nYears active: 1950s to 2010s\n\nKey films: ‘The Untouchables’, ‘Dr No’, ‘Marnie’, ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade’\n\nThere are few actors who can communicate genius-level abstraction with as much believability as Benedict Cumberbatch. The Londoner has IQ-ed up everything from the BBC’s ‘Sherlock’ and ‘The Current War’ to ‘The Imitiation Game’ and ‘Doctor Strange’. But his range extends far beyond playing brainboxes, as his visceral turn in Jane Campion’s ‘The Power of the Dog’ amply demonstrates. He’s magnetic as the dissolute ‘Patrick Melrose’ in Showtime’s limited series, too. Like Sherlock himself, there’s not much he can’t wrap his head around.\n\nYears active: 2002 to now\n\nKey films: ‘The Imitation Game’, ‘Doctor Strange’, ‘The Power of the Dog’,\n\nThe London-born thesp (and sometime DJ) made his international breakthrough with a decidedly un-British role: as Baltimore drug lord Stringer Bell on HBO’s epochal crime drama ‘The Wire’. Since then, he’s personified calm authority on screen, whether fighting kaiju in ‘Pacific Rim’, portraying Nelson Mandela (and earning a Golden Globe nomination) in ‘Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom’ or representing the other side of the law as DCI John Luther in another acclaimed series, ‘Luther’. He’s also the only person on this list to also have their name appear on a Coachella line-up poster. He really can do it all – and he would have made a great James Bond if they’d gotten around to casting him earlier.\n\nYears active: 1990s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom’, ‘Pacific Rim’\n\nA hardworking actor for many years, Hugh Grant found unprecedented fame as the floppy-haired hero of mega-hit ‘Four Weddings and a Funeral’ – then almost threw it all away in a parked car on Sunset Boulevard. Still, fiery performances in ‘Cloud Atlas’ – and during the press hacking enquiry – show he’s still got fire in his belly.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Four Weddings and a Funeral’, ‘Notting Hill’, ‘Cloud Atlas’\n\nArguably the greatest of all British screen actors, Alec Guinness exploded onto the screen playing eight different members of the aristocratic Dashwood family in the satirical ‘Kind Hearts and Coronets’. But he always resented the fact that his best-known role was as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original ‘Star Wars’ trilogy.\n\nYears active: 1930s to 1990s\n\nKey films: ‘The Bridge on the River Kwai’, ‘Kind Hearts and Coronets’, ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, ‘Star Wars’\n\nIt’s hard to remember a speedier rise to fame than Tom Hiddleston’s: from his microbudget British debut ‘Unrelated’ to the lead villain in Marvel blockbuster ‘Thor’ in just four years. It’s been a fast track onto the Hollywood A-list that happily hasn’t taken him too far from the West End stage or passion projects like Ben Wheatley’s stiletto-sharp ‘High-Rise’. It doesn’t hurt that he’s a damn fine actor, and a thoroughly nice chap to boot.\n\nYears active: 2000s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Only Lovers Left Alive’, ‘Avengers Assemble’, ‘Archipelago’, ‘High Rise’, ‘Loki’\n\nBreaking through with ‘Bend it Like Beckham’ at the tender age of 17, Keira Knightley found fame with the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ movies before she turned 20. But she hasn’t rested on her laurels, taking tricky, confrontational roles in the likes of ‘A Dangerous Method’ and ‘The Imitation Game’.\n\nYears active: early 2000s to now\n\nKey films: ‘King Arthur’, ‘Bend it Like Beckham’, ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl’, ‘The Imitation Game’\n\nWhat a long, strange trip it’s been for the Oscar-winning Belfast native. Initially establishing himself as a serious-minded stage actor with an Arthurian presence – one of his first major screen roles was as Gawain in John Boorman’s Excalibur – over the last decade he’s effectively become the British Bruce Willis, appearing in a seemingly unending stream of shoot-’em-up action flicks where he plays a stoical dad with a certain set of skills who takes justice into his own hands. And y’know what? He’s damn good at that too.\n\nYears active: 1970s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Batman Begins’, ‘Schindler’s List’, ‘Michael Collins’, ‘Taken’\n\nOne of the most dashing British actors of the post-war period, David Niven’s pencil moustache and debonair dress sense have become legendary. But he always had a nod and a wink for the audience too, especially in self-parodying roles like the jewel thief in ‘The Pink Panther’.\n\nYears active: 1930s to 1980s\n\nKey films: ‘The Guns of Navarone’, ‘Bonjour Tristesse’, ‘The Pink Panther’\n\nOne of a gang of young British actors who rose to prominence in the post-punk years, Gary Oldman got his break playing Sex Pistols legend Sid Vicious. Three decades later he’s still a force to be reckoned with, even in nice-guy roles in the Batman and Harry Potter franchises. The excoriating ‘Nil By Mouth’ proved he was a fine director, too.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Dracula’, ‘Sid & Nancy’, ‘Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy’\n\nOne of the most versatile British actors, Miranda Richardson may be best known for her irrepressible, psychotic Queenie in TV’s ‘Blackadder’, but her impressive film CV ranges from the doomed anti-heroine of capital punishment drama ‘Dance with a Stranger’ to the Labour MP Barbara Castle in ‘Made in Dagenham’.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Dance With a Stranger’, ‘Damage’, ‘The Crying Game’\n\nAn actor and comedian famed for his unique ability to disappear into his roles, Peter Sellers may have been sidetracked by increasingly unrewarding turns as Inspector Clouseau in the ‘Pink Panther’ series. But his triple-header performance in atomic satire ‘Dr Strangelove’ remains one of the all-time pinnacles of screen acting.\n\nYears active: 1950s to 1970s\n\nKey films: ‘The Pink Panther’, ‘The Ladykillers’, ‘Dr Strangelove: Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb’\n\nAh, The Stath. Equally adored and mocked for his one-facial-expression action-man antics in the likes of ‘The Transporter’ and ‘Crank’, the Mockney bruiser has turned it around with memorable roles in ‘Hummingbird’ and ‘Fast & Furious 7’, and he even tries his hand at comedy in 2015's ‘Spy’.\n\nYears active: 1990s to now\n\nKey films: ‘The Transporter’, ‘Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels’, ‘Fast & Furious 7’\n\nPerhaps the most unpredictable and challenging British actors of them all, Tilda Swinton shattered expectations when she played the male lead in Sally Potter’s time-hopping ‘Orlando’. That fierce, determined sense of experimentation can be felt in every film she makes, from tiny avant-garde indies to major Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Only Lovers Left Alive’, ‘Orlando’, ‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’, ‘I Am Love’\n\nOne of the all-time icons of British cinema, Elizabeth Taylor’s rollercoaster private life often threatened to overshadow her skill as a performer. But take a look back at her breakthrough roles in fiery 1950s classics like ‘Giant’ and ‘Cat on a Hot Tin Roof’, and her remarkable talent shines through.\n\nYears active: 1940s to 1990s\n\nKey films: ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’, ‘National Velvet’, ‘Cat on a Hot Tin Roof’\n\nStarting out as a Cambridge comic alongside the likes of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson became part of the acting elite following buttoned-down roles in ‘The Remains of the Day’ and ‘Sense and Sensibility’ – for which she also won a screenwriting Oscar.\n\nYears active: 1980s to now\n\nKey films: ‘The Remains of the Day’, ‘Sense and Sensibility’, ‘Nanny McPhee’\n\nAnother fine British actor who made a late-in-life breakthrough, Tom Wilkinson was best known as a TV bit-player until he scored an unexpected Oscar nomination for moody American indie ‘In the Bedroom’ at the age of 53. Roles in everything from ‘Batman Begins’ to ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ have kept him squarely in the public eye.\n\nYears active: 1970s to now\n\nKey films: ‘The Full Monty’, ‘In the Bedroom’, ‘The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’\n\nWhen your international breakthrough is co-starring in literally the biggest movie ever, it’s usually only downhill from there. But Winslet wisely countered the career-overwhelming enormity of ‘Titanic’ by deliberately going small: re-establishing herself as a period piece staple (she’d previously won a BAFTA for 1995’s ‘Sense and Sensibility’); challenging herself with roles in the likes of ‘Revolutionary Road’, ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ and ‘The Reader’, for which she earned an Oscar; and only occasionally appearing in other blockbusters, like the ‘Avatar’ sequels. Her greatest achievement, though, may be her turn as a tough, troubled small-town American police detective in the HBO miniseries ‘Mare of Easttown’ – an astonishing performance she completely disappears into, not with make-up but a very specific regional Pennsylvania accent.\n\nYears active: 1990s to now\n\nKey films: ‘Titanic’, ‘Heavenly Creatures’, ‘Revolutionary Road’"
