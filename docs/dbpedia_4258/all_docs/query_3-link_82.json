        "meta_description": "IT'S a peculiarity of Bob Hoskins’ acting career that you can put a precise date on both the beginning and the end of it. It started in 1968 when he accompanied a friend to a theatre audition, was mistaken for one of the candidates and ended up being offered the lead. And it finished on Wednesday when the 69-year-old veteran announced his retirement following his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease.",

        "text": "He has described the intervening four decades, in which he played vicious gangsters, tender-hearted softies and real-life figures from J Edgar Hoover to Pope John XXIII or Mussolini, as having saved him from robbing banks, although he was actually a window cleaner when he got that first casting.\n\nHe says he fitted into the business like a sore foot in a soft shoe and he would be heartbroken if he were ever told – as he now has been – that he would never make another film.\n\nBut while the acting life has been good to the working-class lad from Finsbury Park in North London who could at one stage command ­£5million per film, Hoskins is no stranger to depression and heartbreak.\n\nBorn in Suffolk in 1942, he arrived in London when he was two weeks old. His father Bob was a van driver for Pickfords removals who then became a book-keeper. His mother Elsie, who taught him to believe that if anyone didn’t like him it was because they had bad taste, was a nursery school cook.\n\nI wasn’t mature enough for marriage. I ­married her because she’d had my son. We shouldn’t have been together. I was a romantic and she was an intellectual\n\nBob Hoskins\n\nHe suffered from dyslexia at school (although nobody called it that then) and left with just one O-level. He worked as a porter at Covent Garden market as well as a labourer, a steeple-jack and a lorry driver. He studied accountancy but couldn’t face the thought of office life and went travelling, ending up picking fruit on a kibbutz in Israel.\n\nSoon after he got back he met a teacher called Jane Livesey and they had a son, Alexander. After they married they had a daughter, Sarah, but they were not happy. “It was an awful relationship,” he has said. “I wasn’t mature enough for marriage. I ­married her because she’d had my son. We shouldn’t have been together. I was a romantic and she was an intellectual.” She was not a “cuddler”, he added, although he does not duck his own share of the blame.\n\n“I was concentrating on making my name as an actor. Every time I went home my children were six inches taller and I had missed great parts of their lives.”\n\nThe final straw was an affair he had in South Africa while making the film Zulu Dawn. The divorce was bitter and Jane accused him of being violent. He says they had “really bad, terrible rows” but denies hitting her. However, he has admitted that the experience “sent him off his rocker” and it took a psychologist to explain that he was having a breakdown.\n\n“It was the most awful time in my life. I had lost my children, everything,” he has said, adding that leaving them behind ripped his heart out.\n\nHis son and daughter are now 44 and 40 respectively and relations were repaired enough for Alex to work as assistant editor on Rainbow, a children’s film Hoskins directed in 1995.\n\nAs an only child Hoskins had invented an imaginary sister and he invented an imaginary friend to help him through his loneliness and anguish after his divorce. This creature became flesh on July 29, 1981, the day Prince Charles married Diana. “I made up this woman in my head and on the royal wedding day, when they kept the pubs open late, I walked into one place and there she was, Linda, sipping a G&T at the bar and I thought, you are mine.”\n\nBy that time he was famous, having starred in Dennis Potter’s TV drama Pennies From Heaven and played gangster Harold Shand opposite Helen Mirren in The Long Good ­Friday, the role for which he perhaps still remains most well-known. “It’s fantastic for road rage,” he once joked. “If anyone gets out of their car and wants to have a fight with me, they suddenly look at me and see themselves hanging up on a meat hook and soon bottle out.”\n\nBut he was so poor after his divorce that he was living in his Jeep, which he parked in Linda’s drive in the hope that she would invite him in. Somehow it worked.\n\nMore screen success followed. He was Oscar-nominated for his role in low-budget British film Mona Lisa, in which he played a driver for a high-class prostitute. In Hollywood he made The Cotton Club for Francis Ford Coppola, Brazil for Terry Gilliam and Super Mario Bros for a husband-and-wife team who he has described as such nightmares that their agent told them not to turn up on set.\n\nBut his greatest ordeal was acting opposite cartoon characters in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. “I had trained myself to hallucinate and in the end it screwed up my brain,” he recalled. “I would be sitting, talking normally and suddenly a weasel would creep out of the wall at me.” His doctors told him to take five months off but he didn’t work for a year.\n\nHe had a daughter and son, Rosa and Jack, with Linda and with this second family he always checked whether a film role fitted with school holidays and if not he turned it down. He and Linda live in Muswell Hill, not far from where he grew up but a world away in economic terms.\n\nH e is fiercely proud of his humble roots. A few years ago he was described by a journalist, the step-daughter of a New Labour cabinet minister, as “not the cheeky chappie he seems but the rudest, most dis­agreeable person I’ve ever interviewed”. She said he was chippy and made her wonder if he might go for her jugular with a broken bottle.\n\nGiven that she also expressed surprise that a working-class boy could have managed to read a book by Charles Dickens at the age of 15, she perhaps got off lightly. But most other people express nothing but praise.\n\n“He’s never afraid of expressing his opinion. I remember asking him if he liked the script and he said, ‘I wouldn’t be effing doing it if I didn’t like it,’” says Tom Hunsinger, who directed him in 2007 film Sparkle. “But he was very serious about the work and as long as he had his driver Sam with him, who is like another ­version of him, he wasn’t difficult at all. We had a lot of laughs on the set and he encouraged the younger actors. It’s a great loss to the business that he’s leaving it.”\n\nAn undiluted radical who hates Tony Blair even more than he hated Margaret Thatcher, he never wants to be Sir Bob Hoskins. As he puts it: “For me a knighthood is like a bowler hat. It looks great on other people, you know?”\n\nThe one career epitaph he doesn’t want is that he just played thugs. “People always think I play gangsters but God knows how many films I’ve made and I’ve played three gangsters in all that time.”\n\nHOLLYWOOD STAR FIGHTING PARKINSON’S\n\nBy Jane Warren\n\nHE WAS star of the Eighties’ Back To The Future trilogy but it was in 1998 while filming the third season of Spin City (a TV show that won him three Golden Globe Awards) that Michael J Fox announced to the cast and crew that he was suffering from early-onset Parkinson’s disease.\n\nFox, now 51, had started displaying symptoms in 1990 while shooting the movie Doc Hollywood but wasn’t diagnosed until the following year. During Spin City’s fourth season he announced his retirement from the show to focus on spending more time with his family. He met his wife Tracy Pollan when she played his girlfriend Ellen in the American show Family Ties.\n\nThey married in 1988 and have four children, aged 23 to 11.\n\nAn activist who has won plaudits for his commitment to Parkinson’s research and fundraising, Fox’s last major film role was in The Frighteners in 1996. More recently TV viewers have seen him in the legal drama, The Good Wife, opposite Julianna Margulies.\n\nHe created the Michael J Fox Foundation which aims to advance research into a cure. He curbs his own symptoms with the drug Sinemet and in 1998 had a thalamotomy, an operation to destroy the part of the brain responsible for tremors. “When I’m sleeping is the only time I’m absolutely still,” he told Oprah Winfrey in 2010. “The rest of the time I shake.”\n\nIn 2007 Time Magazine recognised the actor and activist as one of the 100 people “whose power, talent or moral example is transforming the world”."
