        "text": "In Suffolk, it's sometimes assumed by outsiders that Ed Sheeran is the only person from Suffolk to have achieved great things on the world stage.\n\nBut in truth, and while it's great that Sheeran is flying the Suffolk flag around the world, once you scratch beneath the surface you'll actually find that quite a lot of celebrities are linked to our county.\n\nFrom Nobel prize-winning chemists to Hollywood actors, the number of famous people with ties to Suffolk may surprise you.\n\nRead more:Morrisons, Asda and Shein products being recalled after urgent warning from Suffolk Trading Standards\n\nGranted, our area isn't as star-studded as other parts of the country, but it's still connected to plenty of famous faces.\n\nIf you've ever wondered if there are any celebrities who grew up near you, fear not, because The People Map of the UK has logged this very topic in a visually-appealing way.\n\nPredictably, Suffolk's biggest name on the map is Sheeran, but some others are surprising.\n\nYou can see the full map of the UK here or read on for Suffolk's most famous celebrities, other than a certain Mr Sheeran:\n\nBernie Ecclestone - Bungay\n\nArguably the most influential man in Formula One history, billionaire Bernie Ecclestone has been involved in the sport since the early 1970s.\n\nIn 2017, Ecclestone was removed from the Formula One Group, but it's fair to say that he made the sport the financial superpower which exists today.\n\nBut before he was rich and famous, it may surprise you to learn of the F1 tycoon's humble beginnings near Bungay.\n\nEcclestone was born in St Peter South Elmham, a few miles south of Bungay, in 1930.\n\nWhen he was eight, Ecclestone moved to South London.\n\nThomas Gainsborough - Sudbury\n\nBorn in Sudbury in May 1727, Thomas Gainsborough went on to be one of the most important British artists of the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWith a school named after him and his birthplace turned into a museum, Sudbury's connection to Gainsborough is as strong as ever.\n\nDuring his successful career, Gainsborough's work was particularly admired by King George III.\n\nRalph Fiennes - Ipswich\n\nActor Ralph Fiennes was born in Ipswich to Mark Fiennes and Jennifer Lash in December 1962.\n\nArguably best-known for playing Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films, Fiennes is one of the most successful actors of his generation.\n\nRead more:The perfect Autumn staycation locations less than 90 minutes from Suffolk\n\nHe and his family moved from Ipswich to Ireland in 1973, with Fiennes moving back to England in the early 1980s to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nBut by successfully pulling off Basil Brown's strong Suffolk accent in The Dig, Fiennes' performance in the film showed that he hasn't lost touch with his roots.\n\nDorothy Hodgkin - Beccles\n\nForget film stars and Formula One moguls, because Beccles-educated chemist Dorothy Hodgkin should be the most respected person in our list of Suffolk's famous people.\n\nIn 1964, Hodgkin became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry after determining the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12.\n\nShe studied at Sir John Leman School in Beccles and then Somerville College in Oxford.\n\nDuring her time at Sir John Leman, she was one of only two girls allowed to study chemistry.\n\nBob Hoskins - Bury St Edmunds\n\nBAFTA and Golden Globe-winning actor Bob Hoskins was born in Bury St Edmunds in October 1942.\n\nHis career began in the early 1970s and during his time performing he starred in many films, including Mona Lisa and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nDespite being diagnosed with dyslexia, Hoskins went on to have a long and successful career, right up to his death in 2014.\n\nBenjamin Britten - Lowestoft\n\nComposer Benjamin Britten, born in Lowestoft in 1913, is another Suffolk celebrity to have a school named after him.\n\nIn 1948, he founded the Aldeburgh Festival - an annual music celebration which is held at Snape Maltings to this day.\n\nHe spent much of his life in Aldeburgh, at The Red House, which is open to the public.\n\nMake sure you are following SuffolkLive on Facebook, Twitterand Instagram to ensure you stay up to date with the latest news in Suffolk."
