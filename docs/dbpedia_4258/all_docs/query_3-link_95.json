In addition to his Emmy, Rob won back-to-back Annie Awards in 1997 and 1998. “I absolutely love what I do and thank my lucky stars for twenty five years of full time employment in this business,” he admits.

During her five years on the series, she generated mass audience appeal, becoming one of the show’s most popular leading ladies. Priscilla then displayed her comedic talents in the box office smash The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, reprising her role in The Naked Gun 2½ and The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. In 1979, Priscilla became co-executor of the Presley Estate and has since brought the Presley Estate from a burgeoning entity into a phenomenally successful organization consisting of the famous Graceland Mansion, a worldwide licensing program, merchandising, music publishing, and television and video projects. Priscilla continues to be a steward of the Elvis Presley legacy. She served as an executive producer and was closely involved in the creation and development of two No. 1 Elvis Presley albums (If I Can Dream & The Wonder of You) and a sold out UK & European live concert arena tour. In keeping with Priscilla’s passion for keeping Elvis’ legacy alive and Memphis beautiful, she actively oversaw the design elements for The Guest House at Graceland. It is the new hotel which opened in Memphis in Fall 2016. The property marked the largest hotel project in Memphis in nearly 100 years. It has helped infuse additional economic prosperity in the city as well as offer a new immersive cultural experience for its visitors. Born in New York, her father’s career as an Air Force officer enabled the family to travel extensively. She attended high school in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where she met her future husband, Elvis Presley in 1959. Although Priscilla and Elvis divorced in 1973, they remained very close until the time of his death. For 25 years Priscilla has continued to serve as Ambassador to Dream Foundation, the only charity that grants final wishes to terminally ill adults. Most recently, she is an Executive Producer on the 2023 Sony/Neflix animated series Agent Elvis, fulfilling the dream of Elvis always wanting to be a Federal secret agent.\n\nBuy Photo Ops"
