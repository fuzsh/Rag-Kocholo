        "text": "Last year Bob Hoskins announced that he was retiring from acting due to the onset of Parkinson’s disease. Now it’s been revealed that he has died due to pneumonia and complications from his disease.\n\nHe is best known to many people for playing Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, however that was just a highlight in an illustrious career.\n\nBorn in Suffolk on October 26, 1942, Bob Hoskins started out as circus fire-eater (yes, really) and succeeded despite the fact that he never took an acting lesson in his life – something he prided himself on. He started acting on stage and in small television roles, before getting his breakthrough role with the classic 1980 gangster movie, The Long Good Friday.\n\nHe followed that with the likes of Pink Floyd’s The Wall, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Cotton Club and Mona Lisa. In Hollywood he also played Smee in Steven Spielberg’s Hook and Mario in Super Mario Bros. He also played an important role in the cult classic Terry Gilliam fantasy drama Brazil.\n\nHe always felt that his only real competition in Hollywood, in terms of physicality, was Danny DeVito. Indeed, DeVito was originally set to play Mario before Hoskins stepped in to assume the role.\n\nHe continued working through the 90s and 2000s in the likes of Son of the Mask, Jet Li’s Unleashed, Mrs. Henderson Presents and Made In Dagenham. His final movie role was in 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman.\n\nBob Hoskins is survived by four children from his two marriages, including his most recent wife of 32 years, Linda Banwell.\n\nActor Bob Hoskins, whose career spans more than 40 years, announced yestaerday that he is retiring from acting, after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nHere is part of the statement released by his representatives, “He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career. Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time.”\n\nBob Hoskins began his career in the 1970s with a string of guest-starring and recurring TV roles, but his breakthrough came with his role as Harold Sand in 1980’s The Long Good Friday. He went on to star in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil and A Prayer for the Dying before reaching international acclaim by playing Eddie Valliant in 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. Other notable roles include Smee in Hook, Bart in Unleashed, and Eddie Manix in Hollywoodland. He most recently starred in Snow White and the Huntsman as Muir.\n\nThe charity Parkinson’s UK also released the following statement, ‘We are sorry to learn that Bob Hoskins has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. He is joining 127,000 people in the UK currently living with the condition. Parkinson’s is a progressive condition that affects everybody differently, and can change on a daily, or even hourly, basis.\n\n‘Many people can live a full and active life with their diagnosis of Parkinson’s. However, it does affect some people quickly and severely. The important thing is that there is plenty of support available for those living with the condition. If anyone would like advice or support about Parkinson’s they can call our free, confidential helpline 0808 800 0303 or www.parkinsons.org.uk’"
