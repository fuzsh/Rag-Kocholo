His two defining film roles, as the flailing, defiant and doomed old-school gangster Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday (1980), who is helpless to prevent his empire crumbling before his eyes, and the rueful, innocent ex-con beguiled by a prostitute he has fallen in love with in Mona Lisa (1986), for which he won a Golden Globe and a Best Actor Award at Cannes, made him one of Britain's biggest (and most British) theatrical success stories of recent times.",

        "text": "His tough-guy looks (the Long Good Friday director John Mackenzie once remarked that for the whole film he looks like he has a stocking over his head) and gruff voice ready to erupt at any moment could easily have delivered him a steady but inflexible career playing rotters, but from the off Hoskins was just as impressive at conveying fragility, tender longing, and characterful buffoonery.\n\nHe was born in Bury St Edmunds in 1942, to where his mother had been evacuated; two weeks later he was brought home to Finsbury Park, North London. (Despite a little Romany blood, he remained in London for the rest of his life.) His father was a lorry driver and book-keeper, his mother a nursery school cook. He left school when he was 15 with one \"O\" level and zero ambition, and tried his hand as a window cleaner, porter and lorry driver before embarking on an accountancy course he dropped out of to work on a kibbutz.\n\nAccidentally becoming an actor, and going on to be such a successful one, has more than a whiff of fairy tale about it, and appropriately, Hoskins' second role was in a Palmer's Green production of Dick Whittington at the Intimate over Christmas 1967. That August he had accompanied his actor friend Roger Frost to the Unity Theatre, and had waited supping in the bar as Frost joined a queue there to audition for a new play, The Feather Pluckers. An hour or so later the director ushered him in, assuming he was part of the queue. \"I'd never acted before, but I was a bit pissed by then and I was a born show-off, so I went on stage and acted my socks off,\" he recalled. He got the part, and landed an agent off the back of his performance.\n\nHe felt at home in this strange new world, diligently cramming Stanislavsky and Strasberg, but found it all \"obvious\". He remained a creature of instinct, although self-deprecation had as much to do as experience with his insistence that \"an actor is just an entertainer, like a serious Bruce Forsyth\". In truth, his time as part of the company at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent was a baptism of fire: when a small part in Romeo and Juliet in which he resembled \"an Elizabethan pillar\" showed up his lack of stagecraft, he was sacked.\n\nHelp was at hand from Ken Campbell, who found a kindred spirit and loved Hoskins' energy and zany imagination. He recruited him as part of The Ken Campbell Roadshow, a travelling circus of tomfoolery that attempted to hold court over the hurly-burly in rough pubs and clubs, playing to uninterested, rowdy punters who were both demanding and frequently uninterested. This was Hoskins' dramatic training. He learnt how to capture an audience, and it gave him the courage to reattempt classical roles and stray well out of his comfort zone.\n\nReturning to London, he appeared more assured in Tony Richardson's production of Anthony and Cleopatra at the Bankside Globe Playhouse in 1973: having appeared alongside the Johns Mills and Gielgud in the notoriously sweary Veterans by Charles Wood at the Royal Court a few months earlier had probably boosted his mojo. The Royal Court had caught on to him quickly, using him in a Brecht double bill directed by Bill Bryden in 1971, and then chucking him in the deep end the same year by casting him alongside Penelope Wilton and Nigel Hawthorne in Edward Bond's Passion.\n\nIn John Dexter's production of Pygmalion at the Albery in 1974 his Alfred Doolittle was cherished as \"one of his best performances: he is an actor of power and resource, with a deep sense of individual character\". The triumphs continued: as the murderous Bosola in The Duchess of Malfi at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 1980, he \"made Iago look like a benevolent Sunday school teacher\", and in Charles Wood's comic expression of the trials of a battle-scarred writer, Has Washington Legs? at the National in 1978 he helped create \"one of the most hilarious experiences the National has offered us to date.\"\n\nHoskins hit the ground running with his television career: after a couple of obligatory cough-and-spits he was cast as one of the leads in LWT's ensemble anthology Villains (1972). A cracking series masterminded by one of the smartest producers of the age, Andrew Brown, the linked plays were the flipside of the police series, concerned not with the process of law but with offering an honest, objective look at the life of the criminal. Hoskins held his own alongside old pros William Marlowe and David Daker, and already-lauded new faces such as Martin Shaw. He got himself a sitcom, Thick as Thieves (1974), but despite good reviews it was doomed to a short life when the pilot for The Sweeney, starring his co-star John Thaw, was broadcast the same week as the first episode.\n\nHe bobbed up in single plays including the last broadcast work of former death row occupant Jimmy O'Connor, Her Majesty's Pleasure (1973) and Dennis Potter's Schmoedipus (1974), the latter an overture to the role that truly lifted him into the major league as a versatile, sensitive leading man. In Potter's Pennies From Heaven (1978), as the unsuccessful sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker, he carried Potter's small-screen epic across four episodes of magnificently crafted and emotional television. He emerged with shining honours (and a Bafta) as Arthur: \"a beautiful four-square piece of acting ... a wonderful subtle performance, every nuance of which commits us to caring for what becomes of this child-like soul\".\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1980) wasn't intended to be a major break into films: it had been made for Lew Grade's ITC, before Grade backed out nervously at the sight of IRA plot involvement. The film was left on a shelf until Hoskins met George Harrison at a party, and said, \"you must have made a fortune from Life of Brian – do you want to buy a movie?\" It's a film that has never lost its power, especially in the unforgettable final sequence, before which Mackenzie revealed to Hoskins that he was going to point the camera at his face for three minutes without cutting away. \"After I looked at the rushes ... that was when I realised that a camera can read your mind,\" he said.\n\nMackenzie miscast him in The Honorary Consul (1983) as an American cop, but he was rescued when Francis Ford Coppola telephoned out of the blue to ask him to appear in The Cotton Club (1984), simply saying \"can you act in my new film, and can you start on Monday?\" He was a fully-fledged movie star. He was great value in a cameo as a heating engineer in Brazil (1985) and worked hard as the boozy pursuer of Maggie Smith in The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987).\n\nFrom Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to playing J Edgar Hoover in Nixon (1995), he reliably drew the crowds and delivered the goods, but always found time to support independent gems such as Shane Meadows's 24:7 (1997) and good television such as his Emmy-winning contribution to Paul Abbot's The Street in 2009, one of the best performances of his career. However Hollywood lost its pull on him after the fiasco that was Super Mario Bros (1993).\n\nHe returned to the theatre a few times a decade, believing it was crucial for an actor to be thrown in front of a live audience every so often, from Guys and Dolls at the National in 1982 to his final stage performance, opposite Kristen Scott Thomas in As You Desire Me at the Playhouse in 2005. Whether it was as easy for him as he made it look and always claimed, Hoskins, who retired from acting in 2012 after contracting Parkinson's Disease, and died of pneumonia, was an exciting, masterful and unpredictable actor, and adored the world over.\n\nHe was married twice – in 1970 to Jane Livesey (they divorced in 1978, having had a son and daughter, and in 1982 to Linda Banwell (a union which also produced a son and daughter).\n\n© Independent"
