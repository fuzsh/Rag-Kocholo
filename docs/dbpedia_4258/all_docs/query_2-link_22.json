Super Mario Brothers. It was a fuckin' nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set! Fuckin' nightmare. Fuckin' idiots.”\n\n—Bob Hoskins, \"The Guardian\" interview\n\nRobert William \"Bob\" Hoskins, Jr. (October 26, 1942–April 29, 2014) was an Academy Award-nominated English actor born in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk. Hoskins is best known for playing the character of Eddie Valiant in the 1988 Disney film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Aside from said role, he starred in works like The Long Good Friday, Mona Lisa, Mermaids, and Pink Floyd – The Wall. He portrayed Mario in the 1993 live-action movie Super Mario Bros. He retired from acting in August 2012 due to Parkinson's disease (having been diagnosed with the disease in 2011) and died of pneumonia on April 29, 2014, at the age of 71.\n\nHoskins greatly regretted working on the Super Mario Bros. film, frequently calling it the worst work he had done.[1] His frustration with the filming led to him frequently drinking alcohol on set and playing various scenes while drunk; Hoskins broke his finger during filming when John Leguizamo's drunk driving led to Hoskins slamming his finger on the sliding door of the Mario Brothers Plumbing van.[2] Reportedly, Hoskins was not aware the Super Mario Bros. film was based on a video game until months into filming.[3]\n\nReferences"
