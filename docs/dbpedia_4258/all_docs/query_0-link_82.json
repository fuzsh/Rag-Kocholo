        "text": "Another unexpected find among the World War I draft registration cards — a native of England! (Maybe.)\n\nIn 1917, Frederick DeLisle Pike was living in Wilson at 412 1/2 East Green Street and working as a barber for Garfield Ruffin a block away at 504 East Nash. He reported that he was a resident alien born in Southampton, England, and had spent three years in an English military band. He also stated that he was married. I don’t know when Pike arrived in Wilson, but he is not listed in the 1916 directory. He did not stay long.\n\nIn 1918, Pike registered for the draft again, this time in Richmond, Virginia. He reported then that he was born in 1885 (not 1887); lived at 107 West Duval, Richmond; worked as a barber for W.C. Scott at 4 North 9th Street; and his nearest relative was mother Sarah Anne Pike, Port of Spain, Trinidad.\n\nPike’s whereabouts in 1920 are not clear, but he possibly was the Freeman F. Pike, 35, barber, who lodged in a home on Richmond’s West Clay Street and reported his birthplace as West Virginia.\n\nIn the 1923 Richmond city directory, barber Frederick Pike and wife Octavia Pike, a domestic, are listed at 615 North 6th Street. Their lives, though, were poised for dramatic change.\n\nThe 1927 city directory for Charlottesville, Virginia, shows this entry: Pike Fred L Rev (c; Octavia R) pastor Trinity Episcopal Church h 324 6th SW. How was Pike transformed from barber to Episcopal priest in that four years?\n\nThe change in Pike’s profession was permanent, even as other details shifted. In the 1930 census of Richmond, Virginia: at 116 East Leigh Street, Frederick D.L. Pike, 42, Episcopal clergyman; wife Octava, 31; and widowed mother-in-law Emma Robinson, 68. Pike reported that he was born in South America (!) and spoke Spanish as his first language.\n\nBy 1932, Pike was in northern Virginia. The 1932 city directory of Alexandria, Virginia, shows: Pike Fredk de L (c; Octavia R) pastor Meade Memorial Chapel h 818 Duke\n\nA history of Meade Memorial written by David Taft Terry, “Community, Service, and Faith: Meade Church in the mid-20th Century,” briefly mentions Pike:\n\nBeyond detailing Pike’s foundational role in developing lay leadership, this piece reveals he was trained at Petersburg, Virginia’s Bishop Payne Divinity School, graduating in 1930.\n\nEvening Star (Washington, D.C.), 28 April 1934.\n\nBy 1935, the Pikes had shifted west to Charles Town, West Virginia, where the reverend led Saint Phillip’s.\n\nWashington Tribune, 20 April 1935.\n\nBaltimore Afro-American, 11 April 1936.\n\nA marriage register column in the 3 May 1939 Northern Virginia Daily reported that “Frederick de Lisle-Pike, Charles Town, W.Va., Episcopal” had performed one of the ceremonies.\n\nAnd then another leap: by 1941, the Pikes were in Oklahoma, where Rev. Pike was pastor of Saint Phillip in Muskogee and Saint Thomas in Tulsa. In 1942, Frederick de Lisle Pike registered for the World War II draft in Muskogee. Per his draft registration, he was born 28 August 1886 in Richmond, Virginia; lived at 310 North 11th Street; his contact was William P. Green, 503 North 9th; and he worked as a minister in the Protestant Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Oklahoma years were trying. Per documents posted by the Episcopal Diocese of Oklahoma Archives, Rev. Pike’s debts (and debt collectors) followed him from West Virginia, and another priest was assigned to oversee his spending. Notwithstanding, he made rash expenditures that drew the ire of his bishop — and his congregants began to complain of his “Masonic activities.” Rev. Pike held on, however, until mandatory retirement in 1954 at age 68.\n\nMeanwhile, Rev. Pike’s wife Octavia found a position at Langston University, where she weathered her own storms.\n\nThe Black Dispatch (Oklahoma City, Okla.), 15 January 1949.\n\nAfter retirement, Rev. Pike lived in a cottage on Langston’s campus, where he worked as Dean of Men in the education and social work departments. When he retired from Langston in 1961, the Pikes moved to Guthrie, Oklahoma, where he died impoverished in 1967.\n\nWilson Daily Times, 22 September 1937.\n\n——\n\nOn 14 July 1895, Robert Taylor, 19, married Lenora Madison, 17, at Elm City, Toisnot township, Wilson County.\n\nIn the 1900 census of Toisnot township, Wilson County: farm laborer Robert Taylor, 25; wife Lenore, 20; and son Arthur, 2. All were reported as born in North Carolina.\n\nIn the 1910 census of Toisnot township, Wilson County: on Rock Quire [Quarry] Road, Rob Taylor, 36; wife Lenore, 29; children Arthur, 11, Willie, 7, Lonie, 5, Mavin, 3, and Kelley, 1; and nephew Freddie, 13.\n\nIn the 1920 census of Toisnot township, Wilson County: on Wilbanks Road, farmer Robert Taylor, 46; wife Lena, 39; and children Lonnie, 17, Marvin, 13, Kelley, 11, Robert, 8, Madie, 6, and Clarence, 11 months.\n\nIn the 1930 census of Toisnot township, Wilson County: farmer Robert Taylor, 55; wife Lenora, 48; children Robert, 19, Mattie, 17, Clarence, 12, and Clifton, 10; and adopted children Jessie, 11, and Marie, 6. Lenora’s birthplace was given as Tennessee.\n\nRobert Taylor died 19 June 1934 in Toisnot township, Wilson County. Per his death certificate, he was born in 1911 in Wilson County to Robert Taylor of Wilson County and Lenora Taylor, birthplace unknown; was married; and worked as a tenant farmer.\n\nIn 1940 census of Toisnot township, Wilson County: Robert Taylor, 55; wife Lenora, 50; sons Clarence, 20, and Clifton, 19; and granddaughter Mary Lee, 4.\n\nIn 1940, Clarance Taylor registered for the World War II draft in Wilson County. Per his registration card, he was born 21 May 1921 in Wilson; lived Route 2, Elm City, Wilson County, N.C.; his contact was mother Lenora Taylor; and he worked for L.C. Cobb, Elm City, Raleigh.\n\nRobert Taylor died 29 December 1942 near Elm City, Toisnot township, Wilson County. Per his death certificate, he was born 1 January 1880 in Wilson County to Rachel Mercer of Edgecombe County; was married to Lenora Taylor; and worked as a farmer. He was buried in Elm City Cemetery.\n\nIn 1942, Clifton Taylor registered for the World War II draft in Wilson County. Per his registration card, he was born 17 May 1920 in Wilson; lived near Raleigh, Wake County, N.C.; his contact was Lenora Taylor; worked as an assistant cook at River View Cafe, Raleigh.\n\nNashville Graphic, 23 September 1954.\n\nRocky Mount Telegram, 12 October 1954.\n\nLenora Taylor died 23 August 1959 in a car accident near Elm City, Wilson County. Per her death certificate, she was born 1 May 1887 in the West Indies to Laura Phshee; was a widow; lived near Elm City; and was buried in Elm City Cemetery. Willie Taylor, Richmond, Virginia, was informant.\n\nBlack Wide-Awake benefits from the largesse of so many, and J. Robert Boykin III is at the forefront of its benefactors. Recently, Bobby shared a box of photographs left in a sidewalk trash pile after the death of Wilton Maxwell Bethel in 1986. A native of the Bahamas, Bethel was a long-time salesman for North Carolina Mutual Insurance Company, son-in-law of John H. Clark, and a devoted Episcopalian.\n\nI pulled from the box several sleeves of loose sepia snapshots, several formal portraits mounted in cardboard folders, several large group photos, and a photo album. At first glance, no faces seemed familiar, but as I continue to sit with the box, it’s giving up its secrets. I’ll share them in groups, starting with the photo album.\n\nWilton M. Bethel’s photo album.\n\nFive year-old Wilton M. Bethel arrived in the United States on 6 April 1911 with his mother Phillis E. Bethel, 33, described as a widowed washwoman; his eight year-old brother Alfred M. Bethel; and his four year-old niece Flosie L. Bethel. The family’s last residence was Eleuthera, Bahamas, and their “nationality” was British West Indies. Their nearest relative in their home country was Phillis Bethel’s sister Sarah J. Gardner, Cat Island, Bahamas. The Bethels’ final destination was listed as Eleuthera, which suggests a return trip home, but the family appears to have remained permanently in Miami, Florida. Phillis Bethel reported being in possession of ten U.S. dollars and stated that the family had not visited the country before. They were headed to visit her son George Bethel in Miami.\n\nDetail of List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the United States Immigration Officer at Port of Arrival.\n\nIn the 1920 census of Miami, Florida: at 630 2nd Street, Philis E. Bethel, 57; sons Arvis, 20, hotel bellman, Alfred, 18, aviation camp laborer, and Wilton, 15, jewelry store porter; and daughter Jessie, 19. All reported arriving in the U.S. in 1911 from the Bahamas and were “aliens.”\n\nThis photo broke the code. On the reverse:\n\nIt’s the young Wilton M. Bethel, “a pal indeed,” in January 1924, when he was 18. His mother ordered four copies, it appears.\n\nSpeaking of Phillis E. Bethel, this may be her image. The shotgun houses at rear, as the palm tree at right discloses, are not in Wilson. Rather, they are the type built by early Bahamian immigrants in Miami neighborhoods such as Coconut Grove.\n\nWilton Bethel at right at the beach with a man, a child, and a woman in a cloche, pearls, stockings, and high-heeled mary janes.\n\nIn 1924, Bethel arrived in Raleigh, North Carolina, to enroll in the high school division of Saint Augustine’s College’s, which did not yet offer baccalaureate degrees. (Bethel was already 19 years old, but older students were not uncommon in an era in which childhood illness, family finances, and the scarcity of public high schools for Black students often delayed completion of secondary education.) He is listed in school catalogs from 1924-25 through 1928-29 as he progressed through four years of high school and a year in the College Department. His first two years, his hometown is listed as Miami; the latter three, as New York, N.Y.\n\nBethel’s scrapbook seems to span his late teens and early twenties, with most of the photos snapped at Saint Aug. The nearly one hundred pictures do not appear to be in chronological order, and none are labeled. Several, though, are stamped “Finished by Siddell Studio, Raleigh, N.C.,” and a handful bear inscriptions on the reverse. Bethel himself appears to have been the photographer for many.\n\nWilton Bethel sitting on a stump, holding a 3A Folding Pocket Kodak.\n\nOn the reverse: “With love Al.” Is this Bethel’s elder brother Alfred Bethel?\n\nBethel, top left, with pals, probably at Saint Augustine’s College in the late 1920s.\n\nUnidentified woman.\n\nUnidentified man skiing in tie and newsboy cap.\n\nOn the reverse: “Will arrives in Raleigh 5 40 Thurs after meet Train”\n\nAround 1929, Bethel took a position as an insurance salesman with North Carolina Mutual Insurance Company and moved to Wilson, where he first lodged with the Noah Tate family.\n\nIn the 1930 Hill’s Wilson, N.C., city directory: Bethel Wilton M (c) slsmn N C Mut Life Ins Co h 307 Pender.\n\nFlora Clark Bethel.\n\nOn 18 June 1930, Wilton M. Bethel, 21 [sic], of Wilson, son of Ernest and Phillis Bethel, married Flora Ruth Clark, 21 [sic], of Wilson, daughter of John H. and Ida R. Clark, in Wilson. Protestant Episcopal minister Eugene Leon Henderson performed the ceremony at Saint Mark’s in the presence of the Clarks and Percy Young. [Actually, Wilton Bethel was 24. Flora Clark Bethel was about 7 years older than her husband. She had also attended Saint Augustine’s College, graduating in 1924, when it was a junior college.]\n\nIn the 1940 census of Wilson, Wilson County: John Clark, 76; wife Ida, 65; son-in-law Wilton Bethel, 33, insurance agent for N.C. Mutual, and daughter Flora, 30, teacher at Darden High School.\n\nWilton Maxwell Bethel registered for the World War II draft in 1940 in Wilson. Per his registration card, he was born 5 September 1906 in Miami, Florida; was an American citizen; lived at 706 East Nash Street, Wilson; his nearest relative was wife Flora C. Bethel; and he worked for N.C. Mutual Life Insurance Company, Goldsboro, N.C.\n\nWilton M. Bethel died 14 January 1986 in Wilson.\n\nFlorida, Arriving and Departing Passenger and Crew Lists, 1898-1963, database on-line at http://www.ancestry.com.\n\nDaisy Unas, nee Battle, applied to the United States District Court in Boston to take an oath of allegiance to the United States on 28 March 1942. Per her application, she was born 12 April 1888 in Wilson, North Carolina; lived at 144 Worcester Street, Roxbury; had a dark complexion, brown eyes, and black/gray hair; was 5’7″, 180 pounds; married Henry Unas on 27 November 1908 in Boston; and believed she had lost her citizenship by marrying a subject of Great Britain. Daisy Unas took the oath of renunciation and allegiance on 6 April 1942.\n\n——\n\nIn the 1900 census of Portsmouth, Virginia: Lizzie Battle, 40, laundress, born in Virginia; children Charlie, 18, teamster, Lee J., 13, day laborer, Daisy, 11, and Sylvester, 8; and boarder Ross George, 32, day laborer. Sylvester was born in Virginia; the other children in North Carolina.\n\nOn 27 November 1908, Henry Unas, 22, resident of 1 East Lenox Street, seaman, born Barbuda, West Indies, to Thomas Unas and Frances Webber, married Daisy Battle, 23, resident of same, cook, born in Durham, N.C., to William Battle and and Sarah James.\n\nIn the 1910 census of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts: widow Elizabeth Battle, 38, born in Virginia, washing; daughter Daisey E.
