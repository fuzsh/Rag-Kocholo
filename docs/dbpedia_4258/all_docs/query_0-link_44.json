        "text": "The Olympic Games. Both summer and winter games. As there have been some famous Olympian’s that made sports history. In this list, there are three olympians from the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, three more from the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, two more from the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, one more from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Colombia, and one more from the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.\n\n10. Brian Boitano. Kicking off the start on the list, we’re looking at this figure skater; who happens to be Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s most favourite. And how they’ve mentioned him a few times in that “South Park” tv show + that 1999 movie. What made him famous, is how he won the gold medal at the 1988 Winter Olympics. In Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Once you see his outfits, he is very good looking than Ben Stiller as Derek Zoolander. And how he skates magnificently.\n\n9. Carl Ludwig Long. A German long jumper in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. He was a rival against Jesse Owens, but became a very kind friend right before the games were over. He won the silver medal for long jumping, and participated very well. He did his best for Germany before the Second World War was declared. He became a soldier for the German army after the games, right before he faced ‘Operation Husky’. The Allied invasion of Sicily, Italy.\n\n8. Peter Kirby. A Canadian bobsledder who participated in the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. He was at the back of the team, as he had to steer the sled. In a two man team, while participating in the 1964 Winter Olympics, they were in fourth place. But by going for the gold, close to the very end, he and his four man team won the gold medal. And really deserved it too. Canada was very pleased on he and his team. Although they wore some funny helmets in 1964, but were really not bad while participating. By looking at him, you probably think if he is in the air force. But no. He and his team were real bobsled Olympians in 1964.\n\n7. Louie Zamperini. He participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. He was a fast runner like Jesse Owens, but Jesse Owens had beaten him in track running for sure. He didn’t won any medals at that time. However, years after that, he got into the Second World War against the Japanese as a fighter bombardier until his plane crash landed in the sea. He survived for 47 days, until he was a POW at a camp where he faced the wrath of the Japanese. And after he and his friends faced the wrath of the Japanese, they were saved when the war ended in 1945. From his homecoming to how he missed the land of his hometown, he became a Christian Evangelist with a strong belief in forgiveness. In 1998, he ran and lit the torch of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was for sure a fast runner, but also a survivor of redemption.\n\n6. Eric Liddell. A Scottish Olympian who participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics, in Paris, France. They called him the ‘Flying Scotsman’ at some point, cause for how very fast he was. Pretty much as how that record breaking, two coal tendered green locomotive was, as it must’ve been his favorite thing. While participating in the games, his rival was Harold Abrahams. And both he and Abrahams at that time, were going for the gold. However for Liddell, he won two medals. One gold medal for the 400 meters, and a bronze medal for the 200 meters. And as the games were finished, they both gave up their rivalry before leaving in their separate ways. They had never forgot for what they did.\n\n5. Harold Abrahams. An English track and field Olympian who participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. He had only one coach to train him. Sam Mussabini. At the time when the games were on, his rival was Eric Liddell. However, the good part for him, was that he won only two medals. One gold medal for 100 meters, and a silver medal for a relay race. He did everything he can by winning those medals, and how he and Liddell gave up their rivalry when the games were over. Sam Mussabini must’ve been very pleased of him, and how Abrahams and Liddell will never forget for what they did. For he and Liddell were to ‘go for the gold’.\n\n4. Karen Percy. A Canadian alpine skier who participated in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. A very good one as she won two bronze medals, during her time at the games. One for super-G, and the other for downhill. She participated very well, and did her very best for Canada. She was also the flag bearer for Canada at the closing ceremonies when the games were over. The Canadians were very pleased of her. She was interviewed a few times, but not a lot. However, she was glad to deserve those bronze medals.\n\n3. Jesse Owens. The star of the 1936 Summer Olympics, in Berlin, Germany, and every man in Europe loved him. An African-American fast track runner. He won four gold medals and every member and Olympian were pleased of him. At home, he had to face racism cause for how he was as an African-American. But by hearing about the Olympics in Berlin, and how he trained for that event, he became a very fast runner. His coach was Larry Synder, as he became his heralded athlete. He had a homecoming to remember, right after the games were over as every African American were very pleased of him. He also got to sign autographs from Olympic fans who were grew fond of him.\n\n2. Michael David Edwards. A.k.a, Eddie the Eagle. The star of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. A British Olympic ski jumper as didn’t won any medals, but the fans really love him. Michael Edwards who wanted to be an Olympian, but he finally did it. He trained for a few months, by doing it the old fashioned way and how he really soared like an eagle. He didn’t had a coach to train him. He did it all by himself, before his debut in Calgary, Alberta. He was interviewed many times, as some people could relate to how Michael Edwards was. Although he was in last place, but they really loved for how the way he participated, and how he really soared in the sky while ski jumping like an eagle. He was outstanding as an Olympian.\n\n1. Daisuke Takahashi. Taking the number 1 spot on the list, is this bronze medalist in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. A Japanese skater who skated way better than Will Ferrell in “Blades of Glory”. And how he participated very well. The fans and Olympians were very pleased of him. An outstanding Olympic skater he was. And that’s not all folks. Cause after he had a successful homecoming to Japan, he did a skating tribute to that Studio Ghibli’s very final masterpiece, “When Marnie Was There”. Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, based on the novel by Joan G. Robinson, and Oscar nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. At the 88th Academy Awards ceremony, while Chris Rock was the host for that event. Unfortunately, if it weren’t for the academy cause for what happened, Studio Ghibli would’ve deserved that Oscar award.\n\nDo you agree with my picks? Which are your favourite top 10 Olympian’s?\n\nWhile reviewing movies & tv shows at home, and keeping an open mind, AGAIN, had trouble with my dad who is becoming a ski bunny, a woodchuck chucky, a pyromaniac, a terrible jokester, a chatterbox, and a tv addicted guru. Not to mention about how his chatterbox friend talks too much about D. Trump. And how he acts like Gilligan from “Gilligan’s Island”. Or that bald headed kid Caillou from the cartoon of the same name.\n\nMy grey haired mom in her case, STILL, happens to be nagging too much. While she hates the inflation issues ongoing today. Even as a big wine drinker. Not to mention smelling carbon monoxide from fires. And I do not, repeat NOT want to be her Norman Bates from Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho”. They together, can be peeping Toms too on anyone’s personal items or issues.\n\nAgain, none one of these are well entertaining. From June to near mid-July.\n\n“Golden Kamuy”, a 2024 live action film from Japan 🇯🇵 , that Netflix had, had gross bits. That I don’t think your kids will want to get into. That includes eating animals that are endangered species. My reaction? 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“Willie Wee Winkie” & “Curly Top”, with child actress Shirley Temple? Not much of musicals. Some scenes do make that poor little girl unhappy. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“The Death of Stalin”? More like the Russian version of “Weekend At Bernie’s” when the committee fiddles Stalin’s dead body. I like how Steve Buscemi makes a few jokes. But when this happens, I do not want to piss my pants like how Stalin did presumably. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“The Whole Nine Yards”? About a Canadian-American dentist with a wanted criminal as his next door neighbour? I don’t think so. Those French-Canadians didn’t give a grudge. Not to mention how Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan like to harass people. Matthew Perry, who’s in this with those two? What a twit! 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“Jabberwocky” from the UK? 🇬🇧 I don’t think so. They don’t show the monster very much. Cause when they showed it at the climax, not so horrifying at all. And the special effects? Lame. 😒 Not very much of ‘St. George and the Dragon’. And that Monty Python actor? He’s a real jackass. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\nThat 2023 animated movie, “Mummies”? No way Jose! Complete rip-off on ‘Beetlejuice’ when it comes to resurrected humans wearing mummy bandages, as they end up in modern-era London, UK. 🇬🇧 And the antagonist in which like Norman Bates from “Psycho”, has a grouchy mom who calls him too much by mobile phone. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“Mr. Peabody & Sherman”? Based on the cartoon by Ted Key? It’s really disarming if you ask me. Together, they mess up the space time continuum with many historical characters. Pretty much like a kids version of “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”. Only it’s not so excellent. And they don’t say “Be nice to each other” as well as “Party on dude!”. My reaction? 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“The Incredible Mr. Limpet” with Don Knotts? About a sky bookkeeper who turns into a fish in the ocean, by unexpected magic? And goes to war with America in the Battle of the Atlantic? I don’t think so. Too much WW2 crap. AND, it’s ridiculous for someone to turn into a fish, or a mermaid, or a mer-man. Complete rip-off both on “Ponyo” from Studio Ghibli, as well as the Hans Christian Anderson story, ‘The Little Mermaid’. 🧜‍♀️ Overall, 👎🏻👎🏻.\n\n“Tooth Fairy” from 2010, with Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Billy Crystal, Seth McFarlane, & Julie Andrews? Way, way ridiculous than Don Knotts as Mr. Limpet. And I would have to agree with Roger Ebert’s review, when he was alive. He didn’t liked it as how I did. 👎🏻👎🏻. Besides, I only saw it once. Worst movie night at home. I had a bad case of diarrhea while watching it. Burned like acid as I took many trips to the men’s room. 🚽\n\n“The Pajama Game” with Doris Day from 1957? Too much lovey dovey stuff in this musical. I like the dancing and singing when the people in this are so active. But it gets all slow when two workers have their touching affections. My reaction? 👎🏻👎🏻 Thank goodness it’s not a film adaptation of that “Bananas In Pajamas” kids tv show. If it did happened, I wouldn’t agree with it more. And if I were Eli Roth, and they’d get naughty, I’d beat the living daylights out of them. “Inglorious Basterds” style with a barbed wired baseball bat.\n\n“The Ballad of Josie” with Doris Day, George Kennedy, Peter Graves, & Andy Devine? Too dramatic if you tell me. About a cowgirl charged with manslaughter on her drunkard husband. Leading him to alcohol intoxication. I like the part where she devotes her life to protecting a ton of sheep 🐑. But the arguments are way too much for me to hear. 👎🏻👎🏻. On the other hand, after Doris Day retired from acting, she really devoted her life to becoming an animal lover.\n\nI liked the dragon 🐉 scenes in “Game of Thrones”. As well as those large white wolves 🐺. But the whole tv series is really messed up, including the ending. All rivalry kingdoms wanting to claim the iron throne. But they combine forces at the end, to fight against an icy undead king. While they took a phenomenon too far, 👎🏻👎🏻 is what I give.\n\n“Stranger Than Fiction” with Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman, Tony Hale, Tom Hulce, & Maggie Gyllenhaal? About an IRS agent who is being narrated by a cigarette smoking author? And no one believes him, but himself? Until he meets his creator at last? Forced to do a novel for her boss Queen Latifah? No way Jose! I found it too dramatic and too weird. Emma Thompson’s character should’ve scrapped that novel. Killing him. Big time. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“Enemy Mine” from 1985? With Dennis Quaid & Louis Gossett Jr? From director Wolfgang Petersen who did “The NeverEnding Story, a year ago? I like the art direction, where it was filmed, a sand pit monster, and special effects. But Louis Gossett Jr as an alien weirdo should’ve never gave birth to a baby alien 👽, while marooned on a distant planet in deep space. With a human astronaut like fighter pilot. 👎🏻👎🏻 is what I give. Roger Ebert didn’t liked it as how I did.\n\n“Rumble Through The Dark” with Aaron Eckhart in 2023, really made him go from big Hollywood star, to an underrated actor. About a prizefighter, haunted by his past, to deal with violent black people. And how crooks want his money 💵, that he needed to save his mom’s house. Very violent. All characters in this, don’t hold a grudge. 👎🏻👎🏻\n\n“Road House”, a 2024 remake with Jake Gyllenhaal had a lot of foul language. Only instead of taking place in Missouri, (where the original Patrick Swayze flick took place), they had this down south of Florida. Prizefighter Conor McGregor is off to an okay start. But it gets really messed up. I like how Jake Gyllenhaal fights. But for the whole story, I’m afraid that’s a pass for me. ❌❌\n\nAnother movie that is a pass for me. ❌❌ “The Shallows” from 2016 with Blake Lively. Too scary 🫣. Happened 6 months before Canadian filmmaker Rob Stewart drowned in his new ‘Sharkwater’ documentary. A female medical student turned surfer 🏄‍♀️, while mourning the death of her mom from cancer, goes to the beach to where her mom visited, while she was pregnant 🤰. But whats worse that getting hurt? Getting attacked by a killer great white shark 🦈, that’s why. She almost died. But got serious permanent wound marks in the aftermath. Where would Free Willy the orca/killer whale be when you need him, to rescue her?\n\nWhat’s also another pass for me? “Hook” from 1991. A direct sequel to the timeless tale by J.M. Barrie. With Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it comes to show you on ‘what if Peter Pan became a grownup?’. I would have to agree with Ebert & Siskel’s review on how they didn’t liked it very much. I admire the funny moments. But the errors in this are so wrong. So, pass for me on this one. ❌❌\n\nThis one, was close enough. But I’m afraid that this is a pass. ❌❌ “The Boston Strangler” from 1968. Tony Curtis is the murderer indeed. While Henry Fonda, Murray Hamilton, & George Kennedy were the good guys. But the ending was just so long. And Tony Curtis as the bad guy is such a terrible liar 🤥. He should’ve told the truth pronto. And then be sentenced to death row.\n\nSame thing to Shirley Temple (again), in “Bright Eyes”. ❌❌ That’s a pass for me unfortunately. It was good in the first half. But after she sings ‘On The Good Ship, Lollipop’, that’s when her mom tries to get to the airport. But is killed by an oncoming car in the middle of the street. So the second half gets dramatic. Sad story indeed.\n\nAnd that goes for “Heaven Can Wait” with Warren Beatty, James Mason, Charles Gordin & Buck Henry. I like for how he’s a player for the Los Angeles Rams. Determined to win in the Super Bowl Game. Sometime after his birthday. But if weren’t for the co-creator of “Get Smart”, pulling his soul away from his body, none of this ghost business would’ve happened. Pass on that, ❌❌\n\nThe only movie I’ll have to rewatch again would be “Hidden Figures”. About how African-American women as NASA engineers & mathematicians would work the problem and solve it. In the space race, on the Mercury program in the early 1960’s. The only jerk in it, that I don’t like, would be none other than Jim Parsons’ character. Kids will like him better if he portrayed John Chapman. A.k.a. Johnny Appleseed (1774-1845). 🍎🍎🍎🍎 An American pioneer nurseryman, who introduced us to apple orchards all across North America. 🇺🇸 Last time someone portrayed that guy, would be Canadian actor Martin Short. In “Shelley Duvall’s Tall Tales & Legends”. What do you think about that?\n\nNot to mention Liam Neeson in a 2025 remake of “The Naked Gun” in which will be bad as shit, no thanks to bad comedian Seth McFarlane, as well as a live action version of “Harold and the Purple Crayon”, but I’m not sure about doing a review on “Saving Private Ryan”. From director Steven Spielberg. Despite a kraut named after a retarded cartoon character, as well as violent scenes in it.\n\nTbh with you, Steven Spielberg deserved to make cinema history while he won those Academy Awards. And showed us on how D-Day was during the savage time. Besides, those two famous film critics Ebert & Siskel gave it two 👍🏻 for his war film. They were very pleased with him. I wonder if Steven still thinks about those two….\n\nIn this parody skit however in my case, made me entertained. Thanks to Seth Green. The creator of ‘Robot Chicken’. I wonder what Steven Spielberg’s reaction was, if he ever saw this….\n\nFortunately at last, there is this that is indeed, a 👍🏻👍🏻!!\n\nAnd It’s all thanks to the studio that did “Mary and the Witch’s Flower”. Or in Japanese, ‘Mary to Majo no Hana’. Studio Ponoc. ONLY ON NETFLIX.\n\nWhile I watched the first 5 minutes on Netflix, I realized that the audio on the English dub version was out of sync. Wasn’t following the lips, of the way that they talk in this. 👄 But the Japanese version, sure did. With English subtitles. Overall, I would recommend watching this in Japanese with English subtitles. That way, you can understand Japanese before heading to the Far East.\n\nIn this topic, it’s all about imaginary friends. Like how James Stewart had one, in the 1950 black and white comedy, “Harvey”. Cause when he had an imaginary friend, only he can see Harvey, that 7 foot tall white invisible rabbit. 🐰 But we can’t.\n\nPLOT:\n\nBased on the novel by A.F. Harrold, the whole story is set in a world where imaginary friends can live and be eaten. A little girl kept named Amanda, somewhere in modern era England, kept her imaginary friend alive. While her mom was closing down her kids bookstore. Because it was going out of business. Only she can see her imaginary friend, but adults cannot. Cause when a child who sees imaginary friends, has already gone into puberty and become an adult, they can no longer deal with their imaginary friend. And see them anymore.\n\nNot long when encountering a creepy imaginary friend, and a fat man who can see imaginaries, Amanda ended up in a coma after getting hit by a car. Sending her to the hospital. So her own imaginary friend, a blonde boy went out to explore on his own. Realizing that there are more like him, how they fade away slowly, they get together in a safe place. Rather than having them in a foster home. And to do that, he had to follow a stray feline with a that had heterochromia. Like following the white rabbit towards the hole that leads to a place. Similar to what kids author Lewis Carroll wrote.\n\nThe imaginative friend to Amanda however, didn’t want to lose her. So he had to figure out a way to see her one last time. Before she might disappear out of thin air. Just as long as that fat man and creepy imaginary friend don’t catch him.\n\nMy reaction?\n\nThis totally kicks John Krasinski’s butt who did that lousy “IF” movie. AND, Craig McCracken’s butt too, who did that cartoon tv show, “Foster’s Home For Imaginary Friends”.\n\nNot to mention how Frankie Foster would gain 6 pounds of weight, by eating so many cookies a day.\n\nTbh with you, I would have to agree with Carlos Aguilar who reviewed this on RogerEbert.com. He too, admired the Japanese version very much. And maybe the English dub version. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-imaginary-netflix-anime-movie-review-2024\n\nBut if that much means to the kids, who intend to watch Netflix, they can choose the English dub version. Besides, it would appear that Kal Penn, LeVar Burton, Ruby Barnhill, Hayley Atwell, and Jeremy Swift got themselves a second chance to be famous again in this. And, not bad for a start on these newcomer stars. Evie Kiszel, Sky Katz, Jane Singer and Louie Rudge-Buchanan.\n\nSo for a success, 8.1 out of 10 stars is what I give. The only three parts I didn’t liked were….\n\nHow that fat guy was a whirling void.\n\nHow creepy that bad imaginary friend was. (Similar to the creepy one in the first five minutes of “Knowing” from 2009).\n\nHow that blonde imaginative kid was asking too much questions. But not way, way too many like what Jason Clarke did in “Oppenheimer”.\n\nIn conclusion, while watching an animated flick like this one, it’s important to keep a close eye on the way that they talk. How the lips 👄 move. And make sure that the English audio doesn’t go out of sync.\n\nOtherwise if it did went out of sync, it would end up as a total flop like how this fictional movie did in “Singin’ In The Rain”. Or in other words, keep both your eyes & ears open. Lastly, watch closely.\n\nAs long as it has a very happy ending. Perhaps someday they’ll be a remake of that 1950 comedy movie. Until then, fans will be waiting.\n\nI know this is insane. But really. While filmmaking on movies and tv shows, all this Second World War crap really needs to come to a stop. 🛑🛑🛑🛑 PRONTO. Nothing more, nothing else. In this topic however, we’re looking at the very first tattooist.\n\nNow tattooists, give us awesome tattoos. Only if we feel like having one. But if it’s permanent, then they stay with us for a long time. And it would cost a lot of money to get one removed. Until there is nothing left of it.\n\nFor example, when Robert Shaw’s character in “Jaws”, reveals that he’s a survivor of the U.S.S. Indianapolis incident, Roy Scheider’s character as Chief Brody could tell by a tattoo of it. That Quint had removed on one of his arms. And that is when Quint told him and Richard Dreyfus as Matt Hooper, the oceanographer about the incident.\n\nAnother example, would be that in “The Hangover: Part II”, (that I gave a 👎🏻 on), would be that Ed Helms had a real one….on his face! Cost him a lot of money to get it removed. Worst comedy movie of 2011. No thanks to those three weirdos including Ed Helms.\n\nA third example, would be Pete Davidson in “The King of Staten Island”. Based on his childhood days, his character would be none other than a 24 year old high school dropout who wishes to be a tattooist. But kept getting himself into a lot of trouble.\n\nA fourth example, would be how Jack Nicholson’s character in “The Bucket List“, had always wanted to get a real tattoo. So after skydiving 🪂, he got that off the list, as well as getting a funny tattoo. Kept it until his obituary in the epilogue in that 2007 buddy comedy movie.\n\nFinally, as a fifth and final example, Welsh-born Canadian voice actor Richard Ian Cox, as a field hamster named Sabu. In the kids anime tv show, “Hamtaro”. No one knows how or where he got that eyepatch tattoo. In his early days of youth. On the other hand, he did kept it through his entire life. If his character really lost his eye, he would’ve ended up like Tom Cruise as Col. Claus Von Stauffenberg in “Valkyrie”.\n\nSo for now, let’s take a look at this tattooist. Who happens to be none other, than a Holocaust survivor.\n\nPLOT:\n\nLale Sokolov (or Ludwig Eisenberg) had his entire life changed when the Holocaust had begun. Shortly after Germany 🇩🇪 invaded Poland 🇵🇱 on September 1st, 1939. Igniting the Second World War.\n\nMillions of innocent Jewish people were terminated. While some have luckily fled from Europe, the rest who stayed, were rounded up and placed into those dirty death camps. The one in Auschwitz, deep in German occupied Poland, is the very worst one. Anyone who would dare to escape would be shot on sight. Or death by hanging. To those who stay in camp, while wearing those striped inmate outfits would face certain death….by poisonous gas chambers! 💀💀 Those damn sour krauts that eat sauerkraut (that is totally sour), would burn the dead bodies in a furnace! Even for pregnant woman 🤰 who still have their unborn child’s! And while those sour krauts have placed gypsies in this death camps, they’ve put up barbed wired electric fences!\n\nLale Sokolov’s job, was tattooing identification numbers on the arms of each inmate. His ID number was 32407. There, he remained for 3 years, since he entered in 1942. During in which, he met a lovely woman and fell in love. The only thing he didn’t liked, was being harassed by those sour krauts who eat too much sauerkraut. (Totally sour).\n\nUntil by the time the Soviets were advancing to Berlin in January of 1945, Lale and the love of his life escaped at last. After they were transferred to a concentration camp in Mauthausen. Both didn’t stop until they got to Slovakia.\n\nReunited at last, and married in late 1945, that was when they emigrated to Australia 🇦🇺 in 1948. Right before their first son was born. Settling in Melbourne, Australia, they opened up a clothing factory. And through the remaining years of his life, Lale Sokolov (or Ludwig Eisenberg) never again, returned to Europe. Not even with his wife, whenever she went on business trips.\n\nBy 2003, 3 months after his wife died, he was able to talk about his war-time experiences. That was when journalist Heather Morris wanted to hear his entire story, for three long years. During in which, he gets haunted by the people he met in the past, as hallucinations. All the way; until his obituary.\n\nLale Sokolov (or Ludwig Eisenberg) lived until he was 90 years old, on October 31st, 2006. As dead as Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders. Died in his sleep by dawn before Halloween night. 🎃 (I was living on 226 Sherwood Drive, behind the civic hospital, when they quietly announced his obituary). He was in his late 20’s when he was in that death camp. And then was 30 by the time he escaped.\n\nJournalist Heather Morris didn’t had her novel published, about his life story until 2018. Two years before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020.\n\nMy reaction?\n\nLike “Amadeus” & “Titanic”, the old guy tells the story to the person in front of him, while the rest is shown in flashback. Of what happened in the savage time. Throughout all six episodes. While reviewing this, had a little trouble with my tv addicted dad who deleted my personal recordings off the PVR on Thursday, May 30th, 2024. To make more room. I was gonna delete some recordings while they were asleep. But that 800 pound tv addicted gorilla got in the way, wouldn’t move, wouldn’t hand me the remote after I said ‘please’, and didn’t give a shit.\n\nThe reason why that this caught my attention, is that 84 year old Harvey Keitel is in it. A favourite to Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, & Quentin Tarantino. The pimp from “Taxi Driver”, Mr. White from “Reservoir Dogs”, Winston Wolf from “Pulp Fiction”, a CPO in “U-571”, and the cannibal dog leader from “Isle of Dogs”. He did a terrific job as that elderly Holocaust survivor.\n\nAnd so did he, on the original music score. Made by none other than German born American composer, Hans Zimmer. Won a Golden Globe Award & Academy Award for the first ‘Dune’ flick, as well as one more Golden Globe Award for his work on “Gladiator”.\n\nSo for a success, 7.7 out of 10 stars is what I give. The only parts I didn’t liked were the sex scenes, how a pregnant woman gave birth to a kid in Auschwitz, and how those krauts, both male & female, were totally sour. Before they could eat sauerkraut that is totally sour. So I recommend this for ADULTS ONLY.\n\nAs of today, new generation people today feel very bad for elderly ones who faced the savage time. Back when they were so young long ago.\n\nUntil by the 2020’s, while many veterans passed away one by one, artists and architectures built memorials, monuments, and museums of the Holocaust. That is until U.S. President Joesph Biden gave a powerful speech by 12 pm on May 7th, 2024. To honor those who perished, and to honor those who survived like how Lale Sokolov did. It was powerful and magnificent, thanks to him.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, other than that WW2 & Cold War crap, there are other stories on what happened in history, that need to be told. And be made into a tv show or movie like how they did. Nothing more, nothing else.\n\nFortunately there is this, that I found out. Newcomer American actor Dominic Sessa. I don’t like for what happened in “The Holdovers”. If it weren’t for those two shithead parents, portrayed by Tate Donovan and Gillian Vigman. Leaving that boy alone at college with a history professor and a chubby lunch lady for the Christmas holidays. It’s similar to what happened, to that young but sad & poor Ebenezer Scrooge in “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens. But do you know what Dominic Sessa reminds me of?\n\nJohn Luther ‘Casey’ Jones. That famous train engineer. While owning a black train locomotive named ‘The Cannonball’, he risked everything in the railroad business; until his tragic accident at age 37. And what happened to him?\n\nThe eve of April 30th, 1900. The darkest night of the year. While a new moon was in the dark night sky, he and African-American fireman Simeon T. Webb were aware of what was up ahead. Rain and fog were in the way.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, three trains were in the way. Due to their lack of communication. So while Casey Jones was going too fast and too furious, fireman Simeon T. Webb jumped out, just in time.\n\nCasey Jones however, was killed at 3:52 AM in the train crash. Right behind a brake van/caboose! BOOM!\n\nSimeon and many helpers pulled his dead body out, where they held his funeral on May 2nd, 1900. And after John Luther ‘Casey’ Jones was buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery, his story immediately became a legend.\n\nTrain engineer John Luther ‘Casey’ Jones was the very first, to be fast and furious. How do you like them apples, Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto? So if anyone could portray this historical character, it has to be Dominic Sessa. This here, has to be made into a motion picture or a TV show! Right away! No delay! And no excuses!\n\nThere have been famous people in tall tales and legends. Real people, as there has to be biographic motion pictures. About what someone did, and how they changed America forever. Actress Shelley Duvall in her case, did those direct to videotape series of the same name. And had Hollywood’s best of the best. To portray them. With the help of Lyrick Studios that did those “Veggie Tales” & “Wishbone” videos. Not to mention that ‘Barney’ guy.\n\nWhen storyteller Bil Lepp came into power, he did that tv show “Man VS History”, on the History Channel. And he too, talked about famous people in tall tales and legends. He did a terrific job.\n\nNow in the motion picture business, there’s been only two. That I rely on. Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley, in “Annie Get Your Gun” from 1950. Joining her would be Howard Keel as Frank Butler, Louis Calhern as Col. Buffalo Bill, as well as J. Carrol Naish as Chief Sitting Bull.\n\nAnd this from MGM with John Wayne, as he directed this in 1960. Portraying the most famous folk hero, soldier, politician, and frontiersman from Tennessee. Colonel Davy Crockett. A.k.a, ‘King of the Wild Frontier’. You can tell when he has that raccoon hat he wears.\n\nPLOT:\n\nThis shows the final days of Davy Crockett. For he and his Tennesseans join the Texans in the Texas Revolution. And they began to get ready, for the battle that would be their very last.\n\nThe battle of the Alamo. From February 23rd to March 6th, 1863.\n\nA ruthless Mexican generalissimo named Antonio López de Santa Anna, lead a massive army. His target was the Alamo. Only a handful of Texans and Tennesseans including Colonel’s David Crockett, Jim Bowie, & William Barrett Travis sacrificed themselves to save innocent homesteaders. Women and children mostly, including reliable Mexicans. They fought together at the Alamo, while only a widow, two children and a messenger portrayed by Frankie Avalon, survived.\n\nMy reaction?\n\nInstead of watching the same boring WWII & Cold War movies, (tv shows too), this really takes the kick. Besides, I always wanted to watch a movie about Davy Crockett, and learn about this event. Where I come from, we never had the time to learn about the Texas Revolution in history class. Or choose to do an historical character. Like Davy Crockett, or Johnny Appleseed, or Casey Jones, or John Henry, or Ponce De Leon.\n\nWhich is why I’ve given this 8.8 out of 10 stars. In fact, this deserved to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score- Motion Picture. AND, the Academy Award for Best Sound. All thanks to John Wayne.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, the next time someone makes a motion picture, or a tv show, based on what happened in history like this one, it would be interesting to tell us about this.\n\nA long lost battle that happened during the First World War. From August 27th to October 16th, 1916. The Battle of Transylvania!\n\nOnly for the Battle of Transylvania, it would be cool if they added in those big armoured trains….and these bad boys. Not vampires. But these with big black noses and furry tails….\n\nWhat do you think of that idea? That would be really something to see. Even in time for Halloween. 🎃\n\nI can see it now. The story of how the Battle of Transylvania takes an unexpected turn, when both sides are suddenly attacked by hostile clans of werewolves. All in which are big, furry, & vicious. So a group of Austrian, German & Romanian soldiers combine forces in order to survive. Just as long as no one wants to get mauled & murdered by one. Even worse: get bitten or scratched to become the next werewolf. Cause if that happens, one person can fight against monsters. But not the curse of lycanthropy…whenever there is a full moon 🌖 in the sky…\n\nAnd say ‘IYF Stephen King & R.L. Stine!’. So this idea has to be made into a motion picture (or a tv show) right away! No delay!\n\nAFTER the release of this new remake of “The Wolf Man”. Which marks the 2nd remake of that werewolf story. Coming soon on January 17th, 2025. Then filmmakers & tv show creators need to focus on other events on what happened in history, like “The Alamo” than this WWII & Cold War crap we see today.\n\nThat means you too Sir Steven Rodney McQueen! U can do your ‘Blitz’ movie, coming soon-ish on Apple TV. But no more WWII & Cold War crap RIGHT NOW. Nothing more, nothing else. That goes for the rest in Hollywood."
