        "text": "Bob Hoskins hated this movie. He told The Guardian in 2007 that it was the worst film he ever made. In another interview with the newspaper, he said it was the worst job he ever had, his biggest disappointment, and what he would edit out of his life if he were given the opportunity.\n\nSo, why am I reviewing this as my tribute to the late Mr. Hoskins instead of one of his better films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Mona Lisa (1986), or, heck, even Hook (1991)? Three reasons, the third of which I’ll get into later. One, I figured most people would be reviewing his more hailed work, and I wanted to do something a bit different. Secondly, Super Mario Bros. is probably the first Hoskins’s film I ever saw. My brother and I grew-up on Nintendo and the Super Mario games. We loved them. As a result, this little movie seemed to play quite frequently on our television. It holds a special place in my nostalgic, 90s kid heart is what I’m saying. The film isn’t great. Well, okay, it’s embarrassingly bad, but I can think of no movie more appropriate to showcase Hoskins’s gift as an actor.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. is obviously inspired by the hit video game. What’s important to remember is that the picture is a super loose adaption of its source material, and I can’t stress that ‘super’ part enough.\n\nThe dark, depressing cityscape of King Koopa’s New York is totally mismatched when compared to the games mostly light and nature based levels; the Goombas look nothing like they do in the game; Toad, Princess Daisy’s loyal companion, is also a Goomba in the film and not the little guy with a mushroom on his head that he is in the game; and let’s not forget how Koopa (Bowser) looks like a human being with weird hair instead of a dragon like creature that breaths fire and has spikes on the back of his big, green shell.\n\nIf you need further proof of the differences between the two versions of Mario’s world, here’s the story. Daisy (played by Samantha Mathis) is an archeologist investigating some dinosaur fossils that have been found in New York City. Unbeknownst to her (but knowst to us), she is being followed by two idiots that have such a bad fashion sense you’d think they’d stick out more easily. This is New York City we’re talking about, though. There are probably weirder things to see. So, what do I know. Her path eventually crosses with the Mario Bros.. Mario (played by Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (played by John Leguizamo) are plumbers whose business is not exactly booming. Luigi immediately falls for the young woman. After a fairly successful double-date with Mario and his girlfriend where the brothers find out Daisy is an orphan raised by nuns, Luigi and Daisy seem to be at the beginning of a beautiful romantic relationship.\n\nThen Daisy is kidnapped by the two morons and taken to the parallel dimension that is home to King Koopa (played by Dennis Hopper) and his dumb, small-headed but big-bodied Goomba minions. Here the people all look like people, the cars look mostly like cars, the buildings look like buildings, and everything else is pretty similar to how it is in our world. The locals are even nice enough to speak and write in English. The one big difference is the people are evolved from dinosaurs instead of primates, and they lay eggs instead of giving birth.\n\nOnce in this strange new place, Daisy finds out she’s a princess and that her dad is a giant fungus…No, seriously. Her dad has been devolved by Koopa into a fungus that has spread mushrooms throughout the dank, dimly lit city. The Mario Bros. are out to save Daisy before Koopa gets his hands on Daisy’s necklace, which was given to her by her late mother. The necklace contains a piece of the meteor that hit Earth 65 million years ago and didn’t wipe out the dinosaurs. It actually sent them to this alternate dimension made up of one small city and miles and miles of desert. If the meteor piece is placed back into the rest of the meteor in Koopa’s possession, the evil tyrant and his troops will be able cross over to the human world, taking over everything with the help of his devolution guns.\n\nIgnoring the gaping plot-hole of why Koopa doesn’t just get to the human world the same way Mario and Luigi got to his, this movie is still terrible. Mario and Luigi are so incompetent at almost every turn that if it wasn’t for the help of Daisy’s fungus father and his legion of mushrooms, the brothers wouldn’t have survived two minutes in Koopa’s world. Don’t believe me? Mario and Luigi spend an awful lot of time trying to get Daisy’s necklace back from the locals of the other dimension only to lose it to the enemy less than a minute after getting it back. It makes them look so bad and incapable of doing anything right that I wanted them to change their names to something that matched their characters more, because don’t remember the real Mario Bros. ever screwing up that spectacularly.\n\nMario and Luigi’s exploits as they try and find Daisy also lack any sort of thrill or sense of adventure. Instead the various run-ins and confrontations they have are more random and weird than anything else. Take one scene where the two get stuck in an elevator that slowly fills up with Goombas. What do they do? Shoot fireballs at them? Use a Bomb-omb? Jump on their heads? Nope. They start swaying their bodies from left to right until all the Goombas are dancing to the elevator music. The two brothers then make their hasty retreat through the ceiling.\n\nOdd scenes like this wouldn’t be so bad if they didn’t lack all forms of tension and danger. As is, our heroes merely stumble from lame action piece to lame action piece until they rescue Daisy and save the Mushroom Kingdom and New York City.\n\nThe strange choices of the two directors (Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel) leak into every other aspect of the film from its costume design to its sets. I’ve already mentioned the dark and serious city. Morton and Jankel have taken an inappropriate adult approach to the creation of Super Mario‘s universe. They turn what should be a bright and fantastical world into a murky and bleak place, almost like its Blade Runner (1982) or something. Its so against the spirit of the games, which could be dark in spots but were mostly light fun. Perhaps worst of all, the design that they went with is just plain dull. There’s nothing about it that grabbed my attention. Its a wonderful example of a movie city that you’ll forget almost every detail of ten minutes after the credits roll.\n\nWhen the movie does see fit to add in elements from the game, such as Yoshi or Bomb-omb or the classic Mario and Luigi red and green suits, they seem forced. They don’t come naturally. They feel like they’re there just to be there. Almost like the directors and writers knew there wasn’t much in common between game and film and so haphazardly threw in bits and pieces of the game in order to create some illusion of faithfulness. Why is Toad in this movie even called that? He has nothing in common with the game character other than having a good heart and being loyal to the princess. It comes off as the filmmakers grasping at straws, the directors and writers seeming desparate at times to appeal to the fans of the videogame while they are simultaneously changing almost every aspect of the game.\n\nEnough about all that, though. How are the actors? More importantly, how is Hoskins, the reason why we are here talking about this movie today. Hoskins and Leguzamo both later admitted to drinking a lot in order to get through the horrendous and rough shoot. They didn’t mind doing this because they thought the film was going to turn out badly anyway. It’s obvious Leguzamo is on autopilot. His lines are poorly delivered, a constant tinge of corniness accompanying each sentence. Hoskins doesn’t fair much better with his dialogue, but to be fair, the script is horrible. I’m not sure anybody could make the bad jokes and dialogue come off in a believable, entertaining way.\n\nThe actors may have been given very little to work with, but there’s still an element of charm to Hoskins’s performance. It’s no brilliant bit of acting that’s for sure. He wasn’t even trying his hardest, I don’t think. Every time Hoskins comes on screen, however, I can’t help but smile a little. That’s part of his magic. Even with awful material, he was capable of endearing himself to me. He could make me love him no matter how bad the rest of one of his lesser films might’ve had been. He was a great actor who radiated talent. That’s evident by all his great performances and all his okay ones that managed to work despite all the odds against it. That’s another reason why I picked this film. It shows how a wonderful actor can shine through even the most woeful of material.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. isn’t as good as the kid version of me thought it was. I’ve explained, probably a bit more meanly and sarcastically than is my norm, why I don’t like the film. It simply doesn’t understand Super Mario and why people liked the games so much, the film lacking all the light hearted fun of the game. It ended up so off the mark that the end product is hardly recognizable as a Mario product. Does it still hold a special place in my heart? Absolutely. Does Hoskins phoning in his performance make me appreciate him any less? Undoubtedly no. He was and is a shiny light in every movie he touched. Super Mario Bros. is no exception. Here’s to you, Sir, and your fine, fine body of work. May you rest in peace."
