        "text": "I was deeply saddened today to hear that the actor, Bob Hoskins has died.\n\nBob Hoskins was born on 26th October 1942 in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. His mother was a cook, his father a lorry driver. When Bob was just two weeks old, his family moved to Finsbury Park, North London, the area in which the future actor would grow up.\n\nTo me, Bob was the quintessential, working-class Londoner- a tough cookie with a gruff accent who, deep down, had a caring heart and a great sense of humour.\n\nDuring his career, Bob Hoskins made many great films, several of which were based around his home turf….\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1980)\n\nIn this controversial film, Bob Hoskins played ‘Harold Shand’, an old school-gangster who, through circumstances beyond his control, becomes unnervingly entangled with the IRA…\n\nIn the final, terrifying scene, Harold Shand exits the Savoy Hotel and blunders straight into a trap….realizing all too late that his car has been seized by two IRA assassins (one of whom is played by a very young Pierce Brosnan).\n\nAs the gunmen drive their captive along The Strand towards Trafalgar Square, Harold Shand’s face twists through many emotions, ranging from anger to total despair. Click the video below to view this masterful piece of acting:\n\nMona Lisa (1986)\n\nIn Mona Lisa, Bob plays George, a recently released convict who secures the job of chauffeuring Simone, a high-class prostitute (played by Cathy Tyson).\n\nBased around King’s Cross, when the area was a hellish red-light district, George and Simone soon form a close friendship. For this role, Bob gained an Oscar nomination; an accolade which he sadly never gained.\n\nThe film also features Sir Michael Caine, another wonderful London actor who is still thankfully very much with us.\n\nPlease click the video below to watch the opening sequence in which Bob Hoskins’ character, just out of prison, walks across Waterloo Bridge and back towards his estranged home.\n\nMade in Dagenham (2010)\n\nMade in Dagenham is based upon a true story in which female workers at the sprawling Ford car plant in Dagenham went on strike in 1968 in a call for equal pay. In the film, Bob plays Albert, a union rep who was very much in support of the women.\n\nPlease click below to view one of the film’s most moving scenes:\n\n*\n\nRest in peace, Bob."
