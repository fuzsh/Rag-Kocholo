        "text": "I got the the chance to chat with the sole operator of Krystof‚Äôs Cigars, Krys Bielski. As well as providing a sophisticated exploration of cigars, Jazz and great drinks ‚Äì I always take pride in getting to chat with people who live cigars.\n\nKrys‚Äô company provides premium cigars in Perth and he was good enough to chat with Vitola Magazine.\n\nCould you tell us a little about yourself and your company? How and why you got into Cigar Sales?\n\nI am the sole owner/operator of Krystof‚Äôs cigars, that started off in Feb 2015, to fill the void predominantly in the Perth market. Until I started operating, Perth only had 1 cigar retailer. I saw an opportunity to offer high quality products at a competitive price. Our No.1 priority is customer satisfaction. We will do everything in our power to satisfy our customers. We also recognize that not everyone is a cigar aficionado, so we are more than happy to spend time with our customers and help them choose what suits their style and appeals to their taste buds.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the tobacco industry in Australia?\n\nIn a sad state, I think there is too much regulation. Discouragement of consumption by the way of taxes has reached levels of absurdity. As a result, the selection of tobacconists that specialize in cigars has reduced to levels that can be counted on your fingers and toes. If taxes and import duties keep increasing it will drive most businesses to the wall and customers to shop overseas (which is already occurring). Unfortunately it‚Äôs no longer socially acceptable to be a smoker and we are easy targets. Won‚Äôt be long before those who drink spirits are the next victims. I get a little bit bitter and passionate when it comes to this topic as I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs up to the powers to be to choose what I do with my body, nor do they have the right to punish me for it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the plain packaging laws?\n\nThis is a bit of a crossover from the previous question. It has greatly impacted local business. I understand that there is a need to curb the take up of cigarette smoking, but Cigars are in a whole separate category, only associated by the word ‚Äútobacco‚Äù. While I agree smoking should be discouraged to those who are underage, those (of legal age) who choose to partake should not be treated as criminals; nor give the government an excuse to treat smokers as their surrogate purses. It‚Äôs a shame the nobility of enjoying a cigar among peers and like minded aficionados, in specialized bars/lounges, is prohibited. If it‚Äôs based on health reasons, why is social drinking an acceptable past time (which is costing the health system more than tobacco smokers). Additionally I‚Äôd highly doubt you‚Äôd see a non-smoker in a facility specifically designed for that purpose.\n\nAre you seeing changes in terms of the kinds of people that smoke cigars?\n\nCigar smoking has always been somewhat of a gentleman‚Äôs game, or at least it has been perceived that way, but I‚Äôm noticing a trend among the 20-45 year old demographic. Quite surprised to see the younger generation show interest. My clientele varies from the one off smoker to those who pair cigars with their favorite drink. Whatever the reason I often get overexcited discussing what cigar to choose, or what blend of cigar is best suited to their choice of alcohol. So far I‚Äôve received very good feedback üôÇ\n\nHave you seen any changes in your business now that the US has softened their relationship with Cuba?\n\nNot at this stage as they are limited to how much can be imported, but should those limits be removed I can foresee either a hike in prices from Habanos SA or a reduction in quality. Fingers crossed neither will happen and we can all enjoy what Cuba has on offer.\n\nDo you have a favorite cigar? What do you like to drink when you smoke cigars?\n\nThere are quite a few to be honest. They consist of:\n\nMontecristo Double Edmundo\n\nRyJ Wide Churchill\n\nIllusione Fume D‚ÄôAmour\n\nKristoff Brittania Reserva\n\nLiga Privada No.9\n\nCohiba Robustos Supremos LE 2014\n\nI‚Äôm a massive fan of scotch single malt, but do enjoy a nice quality rum too (i.e. Ron Zacapa). My favourite scotch at the moment is the Glengoyne cask strength.\n\nAs we also cover Jazz ‚Äì are you a fan? Do you listen to any particular artists? What do you like about them?\n\nThat‚Äôs one genre I‚Äôve not been able to get into unfortunately. I‚Äôm a man of symmetry and Jazz (to me) is the total opposite. The closest I‚Äôve come to liking any sort of Jazz related music is Michael Buble, but even then I haven‚Äôt exactly gone out and bought any of his music.\n\nWe wanted to thank Krys for talking with us, and we‚Äôd recommend any of our readers visiting his site here. Be sure to ‚Äòlike‚Äô his company on Facebook.\n\nGiven how drastically the world changes from decade to decade, you‚Äôd think there would be a generational shift away from particular hobbies. This however, doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case with Cigars, Drinking and Jazz (It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Drinking will never go out of style).\n\nAll three of these pastimes have had a connection to one another, whether culturally from particular countries or via their representation in popular mediums. Cigar smoking has diminished in light of a global trend away from tobacco products, and this is especially so after the market glut and sales craze of the 1990s ‚Äì known as the Cigar Boom.\n\nBut like all market crashes, this has a ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù effect on an industry. Good products survive and consumer attitudes change, letting the cream rise to the top. Cigar smoking has gone from an exclusive pastime to a more inclusive though niche hobby. Tobacco pricing and taxing has increased tremendously in the Western world, so consumers are far more picky with what they smoke.\n\nThere‚Äôs also been the cultural shift and birth of the ‚ÄúHipster‚Äù and ‚ÄúHip Hop‚Äù cultures. Both of which have introduced Cigar smoking to a new generation, albeit framed in different ways. Hipsters relate to smoking pipes and cigars as they are considered retro and old-world, whilst the Hip Hop culture sees Cigars as masculine and wealth affirming.\n\nDrinking culture has changed in numerous ways throughout Australia and abroad, but among people in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs boils down to two subsets: abusive and moderate. Abusive drinking culture is widespread in nearly any country, and has wide ranging social and cultural impacts. Policy changes and legislation is one way to combat this, but what really needs to happen is true cultural reform. The abusive drinking culture needs to eventually die out and be replaced with the moderate.\n\nThat‚Äôs not saying there isn‚Äôt a strongly growing positive drinking culture, thanks both to the wine sector and small bar scene. Moving away from ‚ÄúBeer Barns‚Äù is an increasingly positive move, as small bar establishments normally serve higher quality drinks and take their work seriously. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs any cheaper. Speciality venues normally stock and sell speciality drinks at a premium.\n\nJazz music is a ever changing creature, but Classic Jazz has survived primarily through a combination of nostalgia and popular entertainment mediums. As the art-form changed drastically in the late 60s to include far more exotics tastes and the sub-genre of Bebop took hold, Big Band, Crooners and Swing had to take a backseat. Jazz went from the kind of music where you‚Äôd dance and thump your glass at your table, to something more akin to visiting an art gallery. Like Satchmo said ‚ÄúIt it ain‚Äôt got that Swing, it don‚Äôt mean a thing‚Äù.\n\nClassic Jazz survives through a wide variety of mediums, but is especially brought to life via Jazz festivals and popular entertainment. I won‚Äôt spend a lot of time on it in this general overview article, as I really want to explore this at length later. Suffice to say, it‚Äôs incredible how popular entertainment mediums have brought about introducing Classic Jazz to a whole generation.\n\nFor more updates and info from Vitola be sure to ‚ÄòLike‚Äô us on Facebook.\n\nImage 1: Cozy Harris playing piano sheet music for ‚ÄòMother of Mine,‚Äô with cigar in his mouth, next to an unknown woman, c1950-1955.
