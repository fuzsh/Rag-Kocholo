        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Director , Executive Producer more\n\nBirth name Robert William Hoskins\n\nBritish nationality\n\nBirth October 26, 1942 (Bury Saint-Edmunds – England)\n\nDied April 29, 2014\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBob Hoskins had already tried his hand at several professions when he discovered theater at the age of twenty-six. He quickly established himself in the industry, then landed roles in television series. At the same time, he began to appear in the cinema in Up the front (1972) by Bob Kellett , or Inserts in 1974. He continued these back and forth between theater, television and cinema throughout the 1970s, establishing himself as a recurring and recognized figure in the British audiovisual landscape.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 1980s, the situation changed. He became known to the general public thanks to his role as a gangster in John Mackenzie ‘s Racket , which earned him a BAFTA nomination. He then took on important roles, appearing as a brutal manager in the experience The Wall , by the group Pink Floyd (1982), or in adaptations of great operas ( Othello ). These 1980s were a real boom for him, and as the rewards arrived, the big names called on him, and ambitious projects multiplied: Cotton club (1984, Francis Ford Coppola ), Brazil ( Terry Gilliam , 1985) and Mona Lisa (1987, Neil Jordan ), with whom he achieved ultimate recognition, obtaining an Actor Award at Cannes, a Golden Globes and an Oscar nomination. Although he excels in gravity, the actor does not hesitate to use his good-natured physique to take on lighter roles. He is a private detective in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988, Robert Zemeckis ) alongside great animated characters, then pirate in Steven Spielberg ‘s Hook . This peak allowed him to start work on his first production, The Raggedy Rawney , in 1988. Perhaps a little too sure of himself, he participated in the disaster Super Mario Bros , in which he played the main role. The film was a public and critical failure which somewhat calmed the euphoria around the actor. Aware of having slackened on his career choices, he returned to important roles, and played in turn Churchill ( World War II: When Lions Roared (TV) , 1994), Hoover ( Nixon , Oliver Stone , 1996) and Nikita Krutchev ( Stalingrad , Jean-Jacques Annaud , 2001). Finally, 20 years after having played Mussolini ( Mussolini and I\n\n, 1985), he once again lends his features to a great Italian figure in the person of Pope John XXIII ( Il Papa buono in 2003), always for television. Returning to a sort of balance, he then seemed to lead his career more effectively, diversifying genres, despite his attraction to the great figures of History, and continuing his career as a director, notably signing a segment of Tube Tales in 1999 During the 2000s, he even returned to light films and played in Love at First Sight in Manhattan (2002), Vanity Fair (2005) and Le Fils du Mask (id.).\n\nNow in his sixties, the actor continues to tour regularly, varying his career choices through notable supporting roles: boss setting Jet Li up for attack in Danny the Dog (2005), daring impresario in Madame Henderson Presents (id.) , with her friend Judi Dench , then a crooked politician in Doomsday (2008) by the polemicist Neil Marshall . He also reunited with Robert Zemeckis for the dubbing of Scrooge’s Funny Christmas (2009), relaunched the fight for women’s rights on the side of the bosses ( We Want Sex Equality in 2010), and finally stood, in 2012, alongside Willem Dafoe in the sulphurous Go Go Tales and Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman , a “dark” rereading of the famous Grimm tale.\n\nBob Hoskins has earned, during his more than 40 years of career, a place of choice in the ranks of great actors, through his wisdom and his very particular presence. Able to be the most horrible of characters as well as the kindest of men, he brilliantly exercises the multiple facets of his talent."
