        "text": "Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz, and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing,intonation, and a “horn-like” improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.\n\nElla Fitzgerald Personal Life\n\nAfter tumultuous teenage years, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Fitzgerald’s rendition of the nursery rhyme “A-Tisket, A-Tasket” helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start a solo career that would last the rest of her life.\n\nHer manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy, until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz, who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook.\n\nWhile Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced recognizable songs like “Dream a Little Dream of Me”, “Cheek to Cheek, “Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall” and “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)”.\n\nIn 1993, she ended her fifty-nine year career with her last public performance. Three years later she died at the age of 79, following years of decline in her health. Her accolades included fourteen Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThis Jazz Inspiration Profile of Ella Fitzgerald is sponsored by Sacramento Top 10, the best local list of Day Spas, Hair Salons, Restaurants, Home Improvement Services & more.\n\nFamous Quotes about Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“I never knew how good our songs were until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them.” – Ira Gershwin\n\n“She had the most beautiful voice I think I’ve ever heard.” – Barbra Streisand\n\n“Ella Fitzgerald was the greatest singer in the world.” – Frank Sinatra\n\n“Ella’s voice was so pure and honest, it could break your heart.” – Tony Bennett\n\n“Ella Fitzgerald was a master of her craft.

The Songbook albums were meant to showcase Fitzgerald’s vocal range and improvisational abilities, while also celebrating the rich history of American popular music.\n\nFitzgerald eagerly accepted the project and began recording the first Songbook album, which was dedicated to the music of Cole Porter. The album was released in 1956 and was an instant success, receiving critical acclaim and becoming one of Fitzgerald’s best-selling albums.\n\nEncouraged by the success of the first album, Fitzgerald and Verve Records went on to record a total of 9 Songbook albums, each dedicated to the music of a different composer or songwriting team. The series included albums dedicated to the music of George and Ira Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, and many others.\n\nThe Songbook albums helped to cement Fitzgerald’s reputation as one of the greatest interpreters of American popular music, and they remain a cornerstone of her discography. The albums also helped to elevate the status of American popular music and demonstrate its rich history and enduring legacy.\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book (1956) (Buddy Bregman)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Rodgers & Hart Song Book (1956) (Bregman)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book (1957) (Duke Ellington & Billy Strayhorn)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Song Book (1958) (Paul Weston)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book (1959) (Nelson Riddle)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Song Book (1961) (Billy May)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Song Book (1963) (Riddle)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book (1964) (Riddle)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings the Antonio Carlos Jobim Song Book (Ella Abraça Jobim) (1981) (Erich Bulling)\n\nElla Fitzgerald’s impact on jazz music is immeasurable, and her legacy as one of the greatest singers of all time continues to inspire and influence musicians around the world.
