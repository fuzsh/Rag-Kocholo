        "text": "Have you ever wondered what she actually meant by that? What was her personal life experience?\n\nHere’s a brief look at Ella Fitzgerald’s life in key transitions from poor to rich:\n\nShe had a tumultuous young life, but by the third grade was demonstrating a unique talent by dancing and singing at school, on the way to school with friends, and at church.\n\nHer mother suddenly died when she was 15, in a car accident.\n\nThis began a steady pattern of moving from home to home for Ella: first she lived with her stepfather for about a year, then her aunt. At this age she started working as a lookout for a bordello and with Mafia affiliated gambling rings in the Bronx. This led to placement into the Colored Orphan Asylum, and because of overcrowding, she was later moved to the New York Training School for Girls — a reformatory school.\n\nAt the age of 17 she went on stage at the Apollo theater during Amateur Nights."
