        "text": "I'm sure all of us who appreciate the great singers are mourning the loss of one of the greats -- in my opinion, *the* greatest female singer. Ella was known for her scat singing, and she was certainly a master at it. But I appreciated her ballad work just as much. Listen, for example, to her \"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" or her records with Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.\n\nShe also had a wonderful talent as an \"escape artist\". At times, especially when scatting, Ella would work her way into a corner, seemingly singing \"wrong\" notes. Then, she would manipulate those notes into something that seemed, in the end, absolutely logical. It was always thrilling to hear her do this.\n\nAs much as we'll miss her, we can be consoled that she's now free of the pain that's been with her the past few years, and she's finally at peace.\n\nRest in peace, Ella.\n\nFor me personally, Ella's death has cut more deeply than all the deaths of late of the finest performers in our nation's history. It was thru listening to Ella that I developed an appreciation for jazz. Without her, there would no Coltrane, Hartman, Vaughn, Holiday, Parker, etc for me. This is something so profound that I cannot begin to explain its depth. So, I have gone back to the basics over the past two days, taking in the Louis duets, the songbooks, yet another listen of Mack the Knife. I was thinking about the Sinatra TV special when they duet on Tramp and Frank just sits right down cross-legged to enjoy Ella's swinging. He was so damn excited and happy...just as I was. No one can sing 'Swonderful and Midnight Sun as Ella did. I just ordered the tickets for the Ella Fitzgerald tribute at Carnegie Hall in July. Until then, I intend to reread everything I have about her and go back and listen to EVERYTHING I have by her.\n\nEven though, I have never seen her, and she was not performing in her last few rather painful years, it was a comfort to share the same time-space continuum with her. She is missed.\n\nIt was May 23, 1996, when I found back the music in my life. Someone named Misty helps me to find back the romantic part, the music, the poetry! For six weeks all this is represented by Ella's Misty. Six weeks, day and night, the song comes out of the stereo or just sounds in my head, leading my life back to the greatest happiness I ever knew! June 13, 1996 my friend Misty says farewell, leaving me, not sad, but richer, happier and more complete, more than ever hopelessly in love with the beloved that shares my life ! On June 14, 1996 I write this poem:\n\nFrom another world, mist rolled into my bay,\n\nfrom far over the ocean, mist came my way.\n\nA blanket of fog, of confusion it brought,\n\nentering my mind, smothering every thought.\n\nJust for a moment, now the mist's gone away,\n\nbut the feelings it brought, forever will stay,\n\nMist was here for a moment only,\n\nleaving me here, feeling misty and lonely!\n\nJune 15, 1996 Ms. Fitzgerald dies, and I don't know! But that day brings one of the happiest moments in my life, thanks to six weeks of Misty in my mind!\n\nOnly on June 19, 1996 a friend, found thanks to all this, and unexpectedly a great fan of Ms. Fitzgerald, tells me about her death! Sometimes it's so damn hard to believe in coincidence rather than in destiny!\n\nYou're gone, forever, but I still hear,\n\nyou singing, whispering, Misty into my ear,\n\nThe sound, the lyrics, they touched my heart,\n\nand such sweet happiness became my part,\n\nI'll never again hear Misty without a tear,\n\nnever forget your voice, in memory you're still here!\n\nIn memory of Ella Fitzgerald, the sweetest voice of all times!"
