everything in between.\n\nAnd now tonight, we get to celebrate the music of a true icon, Ella Fitzgerald in an exact replica of her 1960 album, \"Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas\".\n\nI'm

ELLA: It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.\n\n♪♪ NARRATOR: Called \"The First Lady of Song,\" Ella Fitzgerald was the most popular female jazz singer in the United States for more than half a century.\n\nIn her lifetime, she won 13 Grammy awards and sold over 40 million albums.\n\nHer voice was flexible, wide-ranging, pitch perfect and ageless.\n\nShe could sing sultry ballads, sweet jazz and when she brilliantly scatted, could imitate every instrument in the orchestra.\n\n(Ella scatting).\n\nElla's talent was simply unparalleled and everyone wanted to work with her.\n\nHer collaborators included: Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Dizzy Gillespie and of course 'Satchmo', Louis Armstrong.\n\nBut her fame and success didn't happen overnight, in fact, it was her fraught history that would shape her art for the rest of her life.\n\nElla Jane Fitzgerald was born in Newport News, Virginia on April 25, 1917.\n\nElla and her mother Tempie made their way to Yonkers, New York, where they moved in with Tempie's longtime boyfriend, Joe Da Silva.\n\nIt was not an easy childhood for Ella, but still a happy one.\n\nShe enjoyed dancing and singing yet considered herself more of a tomboy, often joining in neighborhood games of baseball.\n\nOn special evenings her friends would take the train into Harlem and watch the variety show at the Apollo Theater.\n\nAfter her mother's tragic death in 1932, Ella became increasingly unhappy and plunged into a difficult period of her life.\n\nShe frequently skipped school and after getting into trouble with the police was taken into custody and sent to a reform school where she suffered beatings at the hands of her caretakers.\n\nWhen she was 15, Ella managed to escape from the reformatory, but found herself broke and alone during the Great Depression.\n\nSomehow, she endured and found salvation through music and dance.\n\nIn 1934, a weekly drawing gave Ella the opportunity to compete in the famous Amateur Night at the Apollo Theatre.\n\nShe arrived that night planning to dance, but when the frenzied Edwards Sisters closed the main show, Ella changed her mind.\n\n\"They were the 'dancingest' sisters around,\" Ella recalled, and felt her act would not compare.\n\nOnce on stage, and faced with boos and murmurs from the rowdy crowd, a scared and disheveled Ella made the last-minute decision to sing.\n\nShe asked the band to play Hoagy Carmichael's \"Judy,\" a song she knew well as it was one of her mother's favorite records by the Boswell Sisters.\n\nElla instantly captivated the audience and they demanded an encore.\n\nShe obliged and sang the flip side of the record, \"The Object of My Affection.\"\n\nIn the glare of the spotlight, Ella had finally found her home.\n\nShe said, \"Once up there, I felt the acceptance and love from my audience, I knew I wanted to sing before people for the rest of my life.\"\n\n♪ ELLA: Shout hallelujah, come on get happy!\n\n♪ ♪ We're goin' to the promised land.\n\n♪♪ (\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\").\n\n♪ DEE DEE: Have yourself a ♪ ♪ merry little Christmas.\n\n♪ ♪ Let your heart be light.\n\n♪ ♪

hear the unbridled celebration of what brings us all together around this time of year, and the joy we look forward to from the holiday season.\n\nAnd what more can we ask for of this time of year

fateful debut at the Apollo Theater, she met saxophonist and arranger Benny Carter.\n\nImpressed with her natural talent, he began introducing her to people who helped launch her career.\n\nElla entered and won every talent show she could find.\n\nThen in January 1935 she met drummer and bandleader Chick Webb, a meeting that would permanently alter her life and career.\n\nChick hired her to travel with the band for $12.50 a week.\n\nWith Webb, Ella delivered a rendition of the song, \"Mr. Paganini\".\n\nIt was one of the first times she experimented with scat singing, and her improvisations instantly dazzled Webb's fans, quickly becoming Ella's fan as well.\n\nThroughout her career, Ella would master scat singing, turning it into a special part of her performances, and spawn many imitators.\n\n(Ella scatting).\n\n♪ ELLA: A-tisket, a-tasket.\n\n♪ ♪ A brown and yellow basket.\n\n♪♪ NARRATOR: A little over a year later in 1938, at the age of 21 Ella recorded a playful version of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket.\"\n\nThe record sold over 1 million copies, was number one on \"Your Hit Parade\", and stayed on the pop charts for 17 weeks.\n\nSuddenly, Ella Fitzgerald was truly famous.\n\nAfter decades of singing every conceivable type of song, in 1960 Ella released 'Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas', to characteristically rave reviews.\n\nIt became the representative soundtrack of the holidays for millions of listeners always finding new fans along the way.\n\nThe album continues to be one of the all-time, best-selling Christmas albums and appeared once again on the Billboard charts, as recently as Christmas 2019.\n\n♪ ELLA: Jingle all the way.\n\n♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is in a one-horse, ♪ ♪ open sleigh.\n\n♪♪ (\"Winter Wonderland\").\n\n♪

International Center.\n\nStuart, thank you so much for having us at Meridian.\n\nI wondered if you could start by telling us a little bit about the history of these beautiful buildings that we're filming in.\n\nSTUART: Uh, Meridian is a very interesting place.\n\nUh, it started as a vision, an idea that if Americans and people from other countries shared ideas and culture and collaborated that we'd have a better world.\n\nLUKE: As part of our mission we focus exclusively on American music, but what I think makes American music so strong is the global influence.\n\nYou know, there are so many cultures that went into this music, and of course the icon, Ella Fitzgerald, draws so much of that, uh, influence into her music.\n\nSTUART: For me, at home, I put on her music during the holiday season, she's one of my favorite artist and uh, just makes me happy every time I hear her soothing tones.\n\nLUKE: And that's why it's fun to be recording this album, \"Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas\".\n\nSo Ambassador Holliday, thank you so much for having us, we're honored to be here.\n\nSTUART: Thank you, Luke.\n\n(\"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\") ♪ NOVA: Rudolph the Red-Nosed

press carried rumors that she would never sing again, but Ella proved them wrong.\n\nDespite protests by her family and concerned friends, Ella returned to the stage and soldiered on with an exhaustive schedule.\n\nOutside of the arts, Ella had a deep concern for child welfare, borne from her own early history.\n\nThough this aspect of her life was rarely publicized, she frequently made
