mountain track - Welcome to True North.\n\n(upbeat music) (mysterious music) - Good evening and welcome to Mainewatch (upbeat music) (projector clicking) Welcome to From the Vault, a celebration of 60 years of Maine Public Television.\n\nMaine Public has televised countless local concerts over the years, from community bands to world renowned groups and the occasional legend.\n\nAnd that's who we have tonight.\n\nTwo, in fact.\n\nWe will go back to 1989 for an episode of Live from the Maine Center for the Arts and a performance by the great Ella Fitzgerald with jazz guitarist Joe Pass.\n\nThe live broadcast of this concert is nearly two and a half hours long, so you will see a shortened version.\n\nNow let's join the First Lady of Song as we go back to 1989 for Live from the Maine Center for the Arts with Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n(gentle music) - [Announcer] The television and radio stations of the Maine Public Broadcasting Network present a special event, Live from the Maine Center for the Arts.\n\n(suspenseful music) Good evening.\n\nI'm Les Myers of MPBN Radio.\n\nWelcome to tonight's live simulcast on MPBN Television and Radio.\n\nWe are coming to you from the beautiful Hutchins Concert Hall in the Maine Center for the Arts, located on the University of Maine campus in Orono.\n\nTonight, we are proud to present the first event of the 1989-1990 Maine Center Season, with a performance by the greatest lady of Jazz, Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nElla will be joined on stage later by jazz guitarist, Joe Pass and a trio of splendid jazz musicians will contribute to the enjoyment of the evening.\n\nThey are Mike Woffard on piano, Earl Palmer on drums and Keter Betts on bass.\n\nElla Fitzgerald incredibly flexible, beautiful voice has overwhelmed musicians, critics, and audiences for more than five decades.\n\nThis gentle, shy woman who can take even the most trivial material and turn it into a memorable musical performance can be as afraid and unsure of herself privately as she must have been as an orphan teenager.\n\nWatching Ella Fitzgerald on stage or listening to her on records today, you hear a consummate artist totally sure of where she is and what she's doing.\n\nA singer who has sold more than 25 million records, who has been named Best Female Jazz Singer for four decades, who has been awarded everything from the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honors to Grammys and honorary degrees from Yale and UCLA, who's the favorite vocalist of practically every popular or jazz musician who ever played, from Louis Armstrong to Lester Young, from Count Basie and Duke Ellington, to Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra.\n\nIt was in the late 1920s that this junior high school student who wanted to be a dancer, heard the Boswell Sisters.\n\nShe was especially influenced by Connie Boswell.\n\nFitzgerald says, \"She was tops at the time.\n\n\"I was attracted to her immediately.\n\n\"My mother brought home one of her records, \"and I just fell in love with it.\n\n\"I tried so hard to sound just like her.\"\n\nElla Fitzgerald mixes scat and lyrical singing like a bilingual speaker, unconsciously sprinkling foreign words into an English sentence.\n\nShe doesn't need to speak English at all.\n\nWhile some scat singers sound like they're substituting sounds or syllables for words, Fitzgerald sounds like she's singing a foreign language, a beautiful, African language that can be understood universally, like a preacher singing in tongues.\n\nBut Fitzgerald also has a beautiful legato voice that can master standards from Lerner Lowe to Duke Ellington without having to rearrange them, and of course, Fitzgerald can barely contain herself from taking a song apart and putting it back together more creativity.\n\nShe has perfect intonation and the confidence in her musicianship to know that no matter how far she gets from the original melody, she'll always be able to find her way home.\n\nElla Fitzgerald probably could sing rock, if she wanted to, have apprenticed in the 1930s with Chick Webb, the progenitor of rhythm and blues.\n\nShe knows how to put a rough edge on a song, and make it move.\n\nThe music goes through her and when it comes out, it lights up the room.\n\n(audience applauding) The trio is coming on stage now, and in a moment, we'll hear from Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nThis is a live broadcast from the Maine Center for the Arts in Orono, Maine.\n\nAnd there she is, Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n(audience cheering) (audience applauding) (audience applauding) - Thank you.\n\n(audience cheering)
