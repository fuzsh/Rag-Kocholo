        "text": "Grace Chapel at Inglewood Park Cemetery, a more-than-century-old iconic landmark, reopened Monday, Oct. 28, after renovations kept it shuttered for six years.\n\nMayor James Butts, other Inglewood officials, Inglewood Park CEO Rick Miller and cemetery employees held a celebration in honor of the newly remodeled chapel.\n\nButts, whose parents are buried at the cemetery, called the hallowed ground there an integral part of the city. When the chapel first opened in 1907, Los Angeles and the surrounding area was just beginning to build its reputation as the entertainment capital of the world.\n\nInglewood Park Cemetery, on Florence Avenue at Prairie Avenue, is the final resting place for roughly 420,000 people, including celebrities Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Big Mama Thornton, Chet Baker and Edgar Bergen. A lot of L.A.’s founders and former leaders are also buried there, Miller said.\n\n“It’s such an institution,” Butts said. “It’s an honor to be here.”\n\nGrace Chapel, one of three chapels at the cemetery, was closed in 2013 to undergo seismic enhancements. It took about three years to develop a plan and about another three years to complete the project, Miller said.\n\nImprovements included refurbishing the original stain-glassed windows, adding about eight inches of concrete to the inside of the walls and installing audio-visual equipment. The chapel will not only be used for funeral services, but will also host weddings, receptions and various other functions.\n\n“Today, we are re-opening the doors to serve the past and future generations,” said cemetery board chairman Judge Robert Letteau. “We look forward to sharing this beautiful chapel with the community.”"
