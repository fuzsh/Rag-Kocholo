(NEW YORK) — The Jet has landed in Boston. According to Marc Spears of Yahoo, the Boston Celtics have agreed on a free agent contract with guard Jason Terry. The deal is reportedly for $15 million over three years.

Terry spent the past eight seasons with the Dallas Mavericks where he flourished in the role as a sixth man. He won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award back in 2009. He made over $11 million last season, so Terry is taking a big pay cut to go to another winning team.

Last season, the Celtics averaged 91.8 points per game which was just 26th in the NBA. The Celtics are hoping Terry can provide a spark off the bench for the team on any given night. Guard Avery Bradley is expected remain in the starting lineup next season.

Despite the signing of Terry, the team is still hoping to bring back guard Ray Allen even though there doesn’t seem to be much room for him. Boston is offering him more money than other teams like the Clippers and Heat, but Allen would have the opportunity to play more minutes and contribute on a larger scale then he would if he remains with the Celtics.
