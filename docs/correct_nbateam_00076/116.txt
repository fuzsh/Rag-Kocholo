The Boston Celtics have officially signed free agent guard Jason Terry, according to the Boston Globe. Boston will reportedly sign Terry with its mid-level exception.

The Celtics issued a statement to confirm the signing on Wednesday.

“Jason is one of the best sixth men in the NBA and his versatility in the backcourt is a great addition to our roster,” president Danny Ainge said.

“The Celtics have such a great tradition of winning and it was something that drew me to the team right away,” Terry said in the statement. “I look forward to getting out onto the court and helping this team in its pursuit of another banner.”

Terry, 34, steps into the two guard hole created when future Hall of Fame guard Ray Allen opted to sign with the rival Miami Heat.

The 2009 Sixth Man of the Year is entering his 14th NBA season. He spent the last eight in Dallas, where he was a member of the 2011 NBA champion Mavericks.

Known for his microwave scoring and fearless shot-making, Terry joins a backcourt that includes Rajon Rondo and Avery Bradley.

Dallas reportedly agreed to sign guard O.J. Mayo and traded for guards Darren Collison and Dahntay Jones to replace Terry and fellow departing guard Jason Kidd, who signed with the New York Knicks.

This offseason, the Celtics have also re-signed forwards Kevin Garnett, Brandon Bass and Jeff Green.

Boston advanced to the 2012 Eastern Conference finals but lost in seven games to the Heat.
