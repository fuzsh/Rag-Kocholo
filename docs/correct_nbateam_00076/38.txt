Spotlight on Jason Terry: In the eight games since Rajon Rondo’s knee injury, which sidelined him for the rest of the season, Jason Terry has stepped up his play to help cover for the all-star point guard’s absence. Terry has averaged 13 points per game, three above his season average, and has scored in double figures in seven of those games. He had scored in double figures only three times in the 13 games before that. In the meeting against the Nuggets on Feb. 10, just before the all-star break, Terry broke out for a season-high 26 points in the Celtics’ victory.

Notebook

• Celtics: Boston has won seven of its last eight games. … Boston has found tough going on the road of late, loser in four of its last five road contests. The Celtics are 8-15 on the road this season. … Boston has not beaten a Western Conference team on the road this season, but it is 5-0 in games against the Northwest Division. All of those games were played in Boston.

• Nuggets: Tonight’s game is expected to mark the return of two players who limped into the break with various ailments — forward Danilo Gallinari (sinus infection) and guard Andre Iguodala (right cervical strain). … Though the Nuggets dropped a 118-114, double-overtime decision at Boston before the all-star break, they have been better against the Celtics at home, winning three consecutive games against them at the Pepsi Center. … Ty Lawson has been on fire of late and scorching hot in his last three games, averaging 28 points, 9.0 assists, and 2.0 steals while shooting 62.3 percent from the field and 64.3 percent from 3-point range.
