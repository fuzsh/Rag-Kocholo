(BOSTON) — The Boston Celtics signed free agent guard Jason Terry. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.

“Jason is one of the best sixth men in the NBA and his versatility in the backcourt is a great addition to our roster,” Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said.

Terry spent the last eight seasons in Dallas and helped lead the Mavericks to the NBA title in 2011.

“The Celtics have such a great tradition of winning and it was something that drew me to the team right away,” said Terry. “I look forward to getting out onto the court and helping this team in its pursuit of another banner.”
