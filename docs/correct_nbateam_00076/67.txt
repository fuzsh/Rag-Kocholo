BOSTON (CBS) - Jason Terry is now officially a member of the Boston Celtics.

Terry signed his contract with the C's early Wednesday morning, according to a tweet from The Boston Globe's Gary Washburn.

The team officially announced the signing later Wednesday afternoon.

"The Celtics have such a great tradition of winning and it was something that drew me to the team right away," Terry said in the team's release. "I look forward to getting out onto the court and helping this team in its pursuit of another banner."

Celtics president of basketball ops Danny Ainge said Tuesday from Las Vegas the team would use their mid-level exception on Terry after failing to work out a sign-and-trade with the Dallas Mavericks for the 34-year-old guard.

Terry was also in Vegas for his daughter's AAU basketball team as the C's continued their summer league schedule out West.

Terry will make roughly $5 million annually over three years with Boston. Since the Celtics couldn't work out a sign-and-trade, they will only have the biannual exception and minimum contracts left to sign additional players.
