        "text": "Jason Terry seeks to add his veteran leadership to the young core of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nLast week it was reported that 17-year NBA veteran Jason Terry agreed to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks. During the free agency, the former Houston Rockets‘ guard reached out to multiple contenders, including top-tier teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nTerry also sought teams like the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers, of which he was “utterly declined” by new head coach Luke Walton.\n\nBut a phone call from former teammate Jason Kidd steered Terry in a new direction.\n\n“When some people call you just answer the phone. [Jason Kidd] is one of them,” Terry said in an interview with NBA.com. “I know what he’s trying to do here, and I just want to help in the process.”\n\nJason Kidd obviously need a decent veteran presence for his young roster. The Bucks are the youngest team in the NBA. Not one of the players in their starting lineup is over the age of 27. With the new addition of the 10th pick in the draft, Thon Maker, the team is getting even younger.\n\nTherefore, youth is an obvious characteristic that can be used to the team’s advantage. But it can also be a striking weakness. Last season the team’s youth proved to be more of a weakness than a strength as they finished with a record of 33-49. Kidd’s phone call to Jason Terry seems appropriate for the task at hand.\n\nKidd made the right call to the right person. Terry, who will be 39 this month, has proven to be a strong offensive force throughout his career, especially in his seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. He only averaged 5.9 points per game last season, and it is unlikely that he will contribute much to the team’s statistical output.\n\nHowever, Terry has a lot of experience under his belt to help guide the team’s young core. He has made it to the playoffs multiple times and has even won a championship with the Mavericks.\n\nJason Terry’s experience is everything that the Bucks need. He has proven himself to be a winner, and winning is something in which the Bucks need experience. Milwaukee finished last in their division and ranked 12th in the Eastern Conference last season. The highlight of their year was when they ended the Warriors’ big winning streak at the start of the season.\n\nThe Eastern Conference is likely to get more competitive this upcoming season. With significant changes to the rosters of the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers especially, the East has a shot at finally competing with the West. Milwaukee is among the few teams in the East that did not make a lot of noise during the offseason.\n\nThe Bucks have no choice but to utilize their young core as a strength. Hopefully Jason Terry’s experience and guidance can mold the team’s young roster into at least a playoff-caliber team.\n\nMore from Hoops Habit\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
