        "text": "LeBron James is happy he got a chance to embarrass Boston guard Jason Terry with a thunderous alley-oop dunk on Monday night.\n\nThe Heat forward said Wednesday he ranks that dunk (see video below) ranks as one of his best ever, in large part due to his history with Terry.\n\nLeBron's Dunk Kills Jason Terry on Wikipedia\n\n\"It's one of my better ones and the fact that it happened to J.T. makes it even that much sweeter because we all know J.T. talks too much sometimes,\" James said. \"I'm glad it happened to him.\"\n\nTerry tried to get under the skin of the Miami Heat in advance of their game against Boston on Monday. Last week, he told ESPN that the Heat's ongoing win streak (then at 20 games) did not impress him.\n\n\"Not really impressed with it or anything that they do,\" Terry said. \"So, for me, it's more about what our team is doing and how we're coming together as a unit.\"\n\nSports\n\nIt was not the first time Terry took a shot at the Heat. Before the season, he said of his goals, \"My mission is to kill; whether it's the Heat, whether it's the Lakers. Hopefully both.\" He also criticized Heat guard Ray Allen for leaving the Celtics (his former team) via free agency.\n\nThe Heat beat the Celtics Monday, bringing the streak to 23 straight wins. Miami looks to extend the streak on the road Wednesday, facing James' former team the Cleveland Cavaliers."
