        "text": "We’re profiling every player on the Celtics roster before the season begins. Today it’s Jason Terry.\n\nJason Terry\n\nReserve guard\n\n6-feet-2-inches, 176 pounds, 35-years-old\n\n2012/13 salary: $5 million\n\nStrengths: Terry is instant offense off the bench (15.1 points in a reserve role for the Mavericks last season). More than that, he can run an offense as a backup, which is something the Celtics haven’t had in a while. With the ball in his hands, Terry makes things happen. Experience and confidence are also strengths. Terry has been here for five minutes and has already established himself as one of the team’s leaders.\n\nRoom to improve: It will be interesting to see whether or not Terry can fill Ray Allen’s role at the end of games. While he should be a dynamite backup to Rondo, Terry’s real value could be as a closer. Allen was the perfect complement to Rondo in that he didn’t need the ball in his hands to be effective. Will Terry be able to run off screens and knock down the open 3-pointer in the clutch?\n\nProjections for 2012/13: 77 games, 12.1 points, 2.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists"
