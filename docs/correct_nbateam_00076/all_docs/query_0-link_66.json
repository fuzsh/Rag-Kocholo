        "text": "BOSTON – Jason Terry has brought his flair for the dramatic to Boston.\n\nWhen you are a 6-foot-2 guard who has spent much of your career coming off the bench, you need to develop something to stand out in this league, and Terry has done that through his penchant for big shots and his willingness to share his big personality.\n\nThe day the NBA schedule was announced this summer he declared that opening night in Miami would be a showdown between himself and former Celtic Ray Allen. He said on the eve of the season he was on a “mission to kill” the Heat and Lakers.\n\nNow he has similar words of warning for opposing defenses that lose track of him on the floor as they focus on Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo.\n\n“Good things can happen for me because guys like KG, Pierce and Rondo draw a lot of attention,” he said before Sunday’s preseason finale at TD Garden. “As soon as that defender leaves – if he chooses to – I’ll be there waiting to kill ‘em.”\n\nIt’s that type of attitude that has endeared Terry to fans and coaches throughout the league throughout his 13-year career. At age 35, his confidence is overwhelming and his words highly entertaining, but unlike many players of his stature in the league, he does it all with a keen sense of his role in the bigger picture.\n\nUnlike many players – including many who have worn a Celtics uniform in recent years and have been asked to come off the bench – Terry relishes the idea that he is the forgotten man on the court, simply so he can stick it in your face for forgetting about him.\n\n“I look for every opportunity in transition when the defense is not set on me,” he said. “Then when they are set, I could play well off the ball. That’s what’s kept me around in this league for this long.\n\n\"Not enough emphasis is put on being able to make plays without the ball in your hands. It’s a lost art. It’s something I pride myself on and it makes me very dangerous.”\n\nTerry’s brash statements and bold predictions would seem like a lot of bluster and bravado if he hadn’t spent so much of his career backing them up. He’s embraced his nickname of “Mr. Fourth Quarter” and has repeatedly said he takes more pride in finishing a game than he ever could starting one.\n\nHe said he is seizing his role as the leader of the Boston bench this season, and after starting a couple of early games, did it with his typical dazzle in preseason as he hit 18-of-26 3-pointers (69.2 percent), including nine of 11 in the final two games he played before Celtics coach Doc Rivers sat him out on Sunday.\n\n“I’m just a confident shooter and I look to take advantage of all my opportunities,” he said. “It’s a big difference shooting contested shots and shooting wide-open shots. I’m expected to make 85 percent of my shots when I’m wide open.”\n\nAnd, on this team, he may find himself wide open more often than anyone could fathom for a player with his credentials.\n\n“He’s just clever,” Rivers said. “We do run stuff for him. But he scores half the time when stuff’s run for somebody else. He’s just so smart. That’s why he’s still doing what he does at his size.”\n\n“Doc’s biggest emphasis is: ‘When the play is not for you, it is for you.’” Terry said. “The thing I can do in this offense when the play is not for me is act like it’s my play.”\n\nTerry said this summer the two biggest drawing cards for him coming to Boston for the mid-level exception were Rivers’ call at midnight – or perhaps (wink, wink) a second or two before – and the ability to play with Rondo. Terry called Rondo “the captain of this ship” on media day, and already in preseason has shown to be a beneficiary of the point guard’s ability to disrupt on the defensive end and break down defenses in transition.\n\n“Rondo does a great job penetrating,” he said, “but all the guys throughout the preseason have been making the extra pass. Maybe they are passing up a good shot, but they are giving someone else a great shot, and my makes are benefits of getting great shots.\n\n“We’re an opportunistic defensive team, which allows us to get out in transition and run. Having the ability to play different styles, whether it’s up-tempo or half court, is what gives us the advantage on any given night.”\n\nAnd one thing Terry’s shown throughout his career is the ability to take advantage of an advantage.\n\nHe’s certainly not shy about predicting he’ll do it, and he’ll take great satisfaction in reminding you of it when it’s done."
