Arenas is also a captain, leading the Enemies, coached by Rick Mahorn.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBibby is the captain of Ghost Ballers coached by George Gervin. Terry is the captain of Trilogy coached by Kenyon Martin.\n\nTerry was featured in a video published Thursday by The Players’ Tribune titled “Through a Father’s Eyes.” It details Terry’s strong bond with his daughters while he supports their dreams in volleyball, basketball and life.\n\nYou will notice in the video that Terry is wearing an ASU shirt and one of his daughters is wearing a Sun Devils sweatshirt.\n\nTerry has close a relationship with former ASU player Zylan Cheatham, whom he has given advice and helped develop over the last few years.\n\nTerry is still true to his Wildcat background, especially after earning a degree at Arizona and having his No. 31 recognized at McKale Center a couple of years ago.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nFOLLOW @JAVIERJMORALES ON TWITTER!"
