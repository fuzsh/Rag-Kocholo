Terry has reportedly agreed to a 3-year deal with the Celtics: “The Celtics will use their $5 million mid-level exception to sign Terry. The total value of the contract will be worth more than $15 million. Terry spoke with Celtics president Danny Ainge and coach Doc Rivers on the first day of free agency Sunday. Rivers said he hopes Boston can still re-sign Ray Allen, in addition to adding Terry. The Celtics have also already reached agreement with Kevin Garnett on a three-year, $34 million contract. Free agents can sign contracts on July 11.”"
