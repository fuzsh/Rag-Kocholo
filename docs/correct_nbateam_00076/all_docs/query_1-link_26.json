        "text": "Boston Celtics alumnus and coach of the G League’s Grand Rapids Gold head coach Jason Terry will reportedly join the staff of new Utah Jazz head coach (and fellow Boston alumnus) Will Hardy as an assistant according to reporting from The Athletic’s Shams Charania. Terry will also be united with Jazz CEO of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge, who led the Celtics in the same capacity during Terry’s tenure as a player in Boston before leaving the Celtics at the end of the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe former Celtics shooting guard has since gone into a successful coaching career most recently capped off by his leadership with the Denver Nuggets’ G League affiliate in Grand City but also included a stint at his alma mater Arizona.\n\nBefore that, the Seattle native served in a front office role at the G League level, having been the assistant general manager of the Texas Legends, the developmental affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Celtics Wire.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and check out the Celtics Lab podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6"
