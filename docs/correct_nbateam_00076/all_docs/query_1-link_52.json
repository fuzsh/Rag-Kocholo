        "text": "On Monday’s edition of Zolak and Bertrand, the guys reacted to the news of Triston Casas traveling down to Texas for the MLB All Star Game as media member for MLB’s social media accounts. This prompted Beetle to raise the question, when will Casas actually return to the field to play games?\n\nIt’s Fully In Line With Who He is…\n\nBertrand: Well, here’s what he’s doing at the All-Star game. Pete Abraham of the globe had the report yesterday. He’ll be there to provide coverage. He’s expected to co-host on the Home Run Derby broadcast on ESPN, which happens tonight. He’ll be on Major League Baseball’s TikTok channels. Along appearing on MLB Network’s media day show that is happening today. This afternoon, I guess.\n\nZolak: Yeah.\n\nBertrand: So he’s TikTok-ing and he’s on MLB network and he’s on ESPN tonight. He’s all over the place. Fine. When are you going to play a baseball game again? That’s all I would like to know. In all this reporting he’s going to be doing can you just give us a firm timeline on when he’s going to play baseball for the Red Sox again? That’s all I’m asking for. People are up in arms about him going to do this without playing right now and during a rehab and all of that. I’m not bothered by it. Are you bothered by it?\n\nZolak: I would have been bothered by it, but I’m not going to be like the old man sitting on the porch yelling at this, because this is what it is today.\n\nBertrand: Tell you what it is. It’s fully in line with who he is.\n\nZolak: Totally.\n\nBertrand: Which is, as I’ve said, this guy’s all about him. He’s that kind of player, and that doesn’t mean he can’t be great or won’t be great, but he’s not the most team oriented-winning type of player. He’s about himself. He’s about the brand.\n\nZolak: He’s different.\n\nBertrand: There are a lot of modern athletes and young athletes that are in that mold. He’s one of them, but that’s why he’s at the all star game on TikTok, ESPN, and MLB Network, because he’s trying to expand the Triston Casas brand.\n\nZolak: Yeah.\n\nBertrand: Whereas I would tell him, “Hey dude, you know how to expand your brand, be available every day and be a great player on a team that’s got the arrow pointing up”.\n\nTom Morgan: They kind of need you.\n\nBertrand: Become a better brand through your play, is what I would say.\n\nZolak: This is him.\n\nBertrand: He’s doing all the stuff that baseball wishes that Mike trout did over the years. But, Mike Trout was instead just the guy who showed up and went to work every day, and didn’t really engage and didn’t do a great job at doing all the other things. So again, I’m not I’m not knocking a player for doing these things. I just wish that it were more productive, more reliable, more consistent players doing these things. But the problem is those guys are actually going to Dallas to play in the game. I wish he would strive more to be playing in the game, as opposed to be there as a reporter. That’s all. When are you coming back and playing baseball? Tristan, can you just tell us that? When are you going to play a game?\n\nListen To The Full Segment Here!\n\nScott Zolak is one of the most highly recognizable figures in the Boston media.
