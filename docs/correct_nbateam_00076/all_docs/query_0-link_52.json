        "text": "Jason Terry did something Wednesday night he hadn’t done since March 17, 2004. He played against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nBOSTON — Jason Terry did something Wednesday night he hadn’t done since March 17, 2004. He played against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nWednesday marked Terry’s first game against his longtime team as Dallas visited TD Garden. The guard played eight seasons for the Mavericks, serving as one of Dirk Nowitzki’s most reliable sidekicks over that time, including their run to the 2011 title.\n\nTerry said it was difficult during the offseason to make the decision to leave Dallas.\n\n“I’m still a Maverick at heart,” Terry said. “As soon as the Celtics made a point that I was a priority, I had to go where I was wanted. I’m happy to be here.\n\n“I know it was a business decision, and all good things come to an end sometimes. This was the timing. I’m just fortunate to end up in a situation where we’re still competing for a championship at this age. That’s what it’s all about now for me.”\n\nTerry said that while it will be fun to see his old teammates Wednesday, it won’t measure up to his return to Dallas on March 22. He knew the date, by the way.\n\n“It’s going to be more special when we go to Dallas, because then you have the fans involved,” he said. “I know they’ll be watching tonight, but it’s a lot different when you’re actually on the court in that arena again. Tonight’s going to be good. In March, when we go back the 22, it’s going to be special.”\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban has already said Terry would be welcome back with the organization after his playing career, and that the team was considering retiring his No. 31.\n\n“That’s going to be a great day. Obviously what we accomplished in Dallas on and off the court is special,” Terry said. “They birthed me. The Jet was born in Seattle but he lives in Dallas.”\n\nFate of No. 34\n\nSpeaking of retired numbers, Dallas head coach Rick Carlisle was tongue-in-cheek about being honored in the Garden’s rafters one day.\n\n“The other thing I feel very good about is I know that my number is going to be retired here,” said Carlisle when asked about his role on the 1986 Celtics team that won the NBA title. “I’ll be very proud, and I’ll try to be here for that.”\n\nCarlisle’s number will probably end up in the rafters. It probably won’t be in his honor, though, since Paul Pierce has been wearing that No. 34 for the last 15 years.\n\nCarlisle had the best of his five professional seasons with Boston in 1985-86, playing in 77 games and averaging just under 10 minutes per contest.\n\nNot a numbers thing\n\nThe Celtics and Mavericks are both perennial contenders laboring through the first quarter of this season. Just don’t ask their coaches what their respective records are.\n\n“I’m not looking at the record that much,” Carlisle said. “You’re aware of it, but you’ve got to get better every day. That’s where the focus is. The record is what it is. In my 11th year of doing this, some of your perceptions and perspectives change a little bit. Each day, we’ve got to find one or two little things and get stronger on those.”\n\n“I rarely look at our record. I don’t think I could ever tell you our exact record,” said Boston headman Doc Rivers. “Having said that, I know if we get the team right that the record will take care of itself. I think over the last four or five games, we’ve played better than what we’ve won, but at the end of the day you’ve got to win. You are what your record says, and you always will be. I do think we’re playing better now. Now we have to do it consistently and now we have to put it together.”\n\nThe Celtics entered Wednesday night 11-9, tied for third in the Atlantic and fifth in the East. The surprising Knicks have the division’s and the conference’s best record at 16-5."
