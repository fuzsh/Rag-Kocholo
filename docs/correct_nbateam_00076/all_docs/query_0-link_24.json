        "text": "Jason Terry continues to boast about his new team. Terry says that the Boston Celtics have the League’s top bench mob. Per the Boston Globe: “Adding [Leandro] Barbosa made a deep bench even deeper,’ Terry said. ‘Not only are we deep but we’re very explosive and we are going to look to outscore everyone’s bench this season, every time we step out on the floor. We have the deepest bench in basketball. The Clippers might have something to say about that, but it’s us in this locker room. Our mission every night is to go out and outwork and outscore every other bench.’ Last season, Brandon Bass led the Celtics in offensive rebounding, establishing himself as a full-time starter in the playoffs. The fact that Bass will be in a reserve role this year is a sign of the Celtics’ improvement. ’Barbosa’s a scorer, also,’ Terry said. ‘So now you have two guys off the bench who are able to penetrate and not only create for themselves but create for other people. And that’s where we’re going to have our strength. When I came here, I knew this team was very deep and very versatile. At every position, guys can create off the dribble, and also spot up and shoot. So with that comes a very difficult task for Doc [Rivers] — to pick lineups and match guys together.”"
