        "text": "A drama-filled season ended for the Milwaukee Bucks with a 112-96 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday in Game 7 of their NBA first-round playoff series.\n\nSeveral players were at the team's practice facility on Sunday to talk about the season.\n\nBucks guard Jason Terry made it clear that he wanted to return for his 20th NBA season.\n\nThe 40-year-old Terry played in 51 games this season, averaging 3.3 points and 1.2 assists.\n\nRELATED: Bucks' off-season will be full of difficult decisions\n\nD'AMATO: The 2017-'18 season for the Bucks was a big disappointment\n\nRELATED: Celtics 112, Bucks 96: Season ends with a whimper\n\n\"I want to play another year,\" Terry said. \"I can honestly stand here before you and tell you all my efforts will be to come back with this organization.\n\n\"Obviously, I know my impact. I’ve been here two years now. I want to see the finished product. Because I know the potential. I know where this organization is headed. And this year was another step, though we didn’t get the result we wanted. It was another step in the right direction.\n\n\"I know management, I’ve already had my discussions with them and we will continue to talk throughout the summer. But my intentions are to come back here and finish it out here. I’m not saying it will be my final season. But I want to do 20 and then re-evaluate.\"\n\nIn other news, guard Eric Bledsoe said he will need to wear a brace on his injured left hand for another couple months. He doesn't think he will need surgery but will undergo an MRI.\n\nBledsoe hurt his hand in Game 4 against Boston.\n\nHere are some other quotes from the players who spoke with the media:\n\nTerry on Game 7 loss: \"The missed opportunities, the want and the will to win every possession. And I thought we left a lot of possessions out there to chance and you just can’t do that in a Game 7.\"\n\nMalcolm Brogdon on this season: \"I expect more from this team. I expect more from myself. I didn’t think we performed as well as we could have. I don’t think we went as far as we could have.\"\n\nBledsoe on what the team should look like next season: \"We have the type of team that’s built for transition. The more we get opportunities to run, we were very successful. That’s the goal. But at the same time, you watch this series (against the Celtics). They were packing the paint on us the whole series. Making us shoot, trying to make us make the right play. That’s the biggest thing, more than transition, making the right reads.\"'\n\nSterling Brown on how he can improve: \"Just guarding any position and knocking down the three-ball. Just coming in and making that impact. Whenever I get a chance to do more, I will do that.\"\n\nShabazz Muhammad comparing Bucks to his old team: \"I think it was more high-pace here (than in Minnesota), which fits my game more. Giannis (Antetokounmpo) gets the ball and goes. Jabari (Parker), a lot of guys can get the rebound and just push. That’s something coach was really saying with us. That’s something I really like. Giannis is a great player and helps everyone get better.\""
