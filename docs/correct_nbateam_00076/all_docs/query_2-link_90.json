        "text": "Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle had the pleasure of coaching Milwaukee Bucks shooting guard Jason Terry for four seasons.\n\nUnder Carlisle, Terry began to truly embrace his sixth-man role, winning Sixth Man of the Year in 2009 - Carlisle's first year as the team's head coach. That season, Terry averaged 19.6 points in 33.7 minutes per game. Those were his highest averages as a member of the Mavericks.\n\nTwo years later, Terry, Carlisle, and the Mavericks made the NBA Finals, defeating the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in six games. It was Terry's first and only NBA Championship and Carlisle's first as a coach.\n\nOn Saturday night, as a 40-year-old veteran on the Bucks, Terry made what may be his last appearance at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, playing three minutes and scoring a field goal.\n\n\"I knew he was gonna score,\" Carlisle said, according to The Associated Press. \"I was gonna clap, I wasn't sure how appropriate that was. You know how I feel about him, that's one of the reasons we're all wearing rings here.\"\n\nThe fans in Dallas celebrated Terry's made basket, despite being on the opposing team. The game was already out of reach at that point and the Dallas faithful were pleased to be en route to just their third win of the season."
