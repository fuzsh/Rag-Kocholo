        "text": "Jason Terry has only been a member of the Boston Celtics for a short while and has yet to make his regular-season debut with the team, but he is already their most vocal supporter. He feels pretty confident that he will help Boston win the NBA title at the end of the 2012-13 season -- so much so that he has already pre-immortalized the moment in tattoo form. Power move.\n\nTerry has been making the interview rounds as of late and has been telling pretty much anyone who will listen that the Celtics will win it all this year. Ben Rohrbach of WEEI has the full rundown of all the bragging and smack-talk, but this quote is my personal favorite:\n\n\"If I looked at our team and what they accomplished last year, they're one game away. They're one game away from going back to the NBA finals, and I think they win it. This year, put a little â€˜Jet Fuel' into the mix, and I think we have the team.\"\n\nPut a little \"Jet Fuel\" in the mix, baby! I'm the \"Jet\" referenced in that statement! Take a solid team, add in a little of my personal \"Fuel\" (in this case, my basketball playing skills) and baby ... you got a stew going!\n\nAnd of course last week, Terry shared a photo of his latest tattoo on his personal Twitter feed. In case you missed it, it's ... fairly braggadocios.\n\nYep. Tattoo of Celtics title. Just go ahead and hand over the trophy now, David Stern. Merely a formality at this point."
