        "text": "It is the MLB All-Star Break and the Boston Red Sox find themselves in the playoff picture ahead of the 2nd half of the season. With the trade deadline coming up, Matt McCarthy said on Monday’s Felger and Mazz that the Red Sox should be adding big at the deadline.\n\nMatt McCarthy: I found myself yesterday getting excited. I said, “oh my God they’re going to buy”, then I said “wait a minute, isn’t this really proof as to how far our standards have fallen? Like the whole “yeah, the Red Sox are going to buy””, shouldn’t that have been automatic three or four weeks ago? Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good thing that we’ve gotten to this point. It’s a good thing that this team has given us a really fun, exciting year and they have made it impossible for Craig Breslow and the ownership to ignore it, so that’s all good and I’m enjoying that as a Red Sox fan. But it is really proof as to how far the standards have fallen around here. We shouldn’t just be asking the Red Sox to add we should be asking the Red Sox to add big at this point. Three weeks ago they should have said they should add now. They should be saying not only are we going to add, we’re going to add big this because this team is getting better by the day."
