        "text": "The Boston Celtics may say they still have interest in re-signing Ray Allen, but they have secured some interesting insurance at the shooting guard spot along the way.\n\nAccording to two NBA sources, the team has reached agreement on a three-year, full midlevel contract for former Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Terry. Under the provisions of the mid-level exception, Terry will make roughly $5 million in the initial year of the contract.\n\nTerry, 34, was the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year during the 2008-09 season. A year ago, Terry averaged 15.1 points per game while shooting 43 percent for the field in 63 games for the Mavericks. Terry has been known over the years as a wiry defender and capable transition player. His spot-up style would work nicely with Rajon Rondo's drive-and-dish game.\n\nIn his 13-year career, Terry is averaging 16.1 points and 4.7 assists per game. He is a career 44.8 percent shooter. He also shoots 85 percent from the line.\n\nMeanwhile, a person familiar with Allen's plans told The Associated Press that the free-agent shooting guard will visit with Heat officials Thursday.\n\nAllen also is scheduled to visit Friday with the Los Angeles Clippers, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were not announced.\n\nAllen is one of Miami's top offseason targets, so much so that even NBA MVP LeBron James tweeted last week that he hopes to play alongside him next season. For that to happen, Allen would have to take less money than he almost certainly could make elsewhere.\n\nMiami can offer Allen only the mini mid-level exception worth just more than $3 million for next season, or roughly half what the Boston Celtics are willing to pay to keep the NBA's leading 3-point shooter.\n\nStill, Allen's willingness to even listen to Heat President Pat Riley suggests that Miami's financial limits may not be a deterrent to a deal.\n\nAllen would figure to be a perfect fit with Miami because the Heat want to surround James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh with shooters who extend defenses and therefore create room around the basket for the “Big Three” to attack.\n\nAllen has made at least 100 3-pointers in 15 of his 16 seasons, the lone exception being when he connected on 74 in the shortened 50-game schedule of 1998-99. He's established career-bests for accuracy in each of the past two seasons, first making 44 percent of his 3s in 2010-11, then 45 percent this past year. His 2,718 career 3-pointers are the most in NBA history.\n\nOne of the sources stressed that the Celtics remain interested in Allen.\n\nThe possible combination of Terry and Allen would give the Celtics a deadly mixture from downtown, though neither would likely start ahead of Avery Bradley.\n\nThere would also be the question of playing time. Allen, who looms as a likely starter for the Clippers, appears to want a more prominent role than the way Doc Rivers' rotation may be unfolding.\n\nTerry's emergence as a Celtic also calls into question the team's commitment to Mickael Pietrus, who is still waiting for a call from the team.\n\nAccording to Pietrus' agent, Bill McCandless, the tough-defending swingman has, in the meantime, been contacted by four other teams, including one with stronger interest than the others. Pietrus has talked directly with officials from two of those teams, including one coach."
