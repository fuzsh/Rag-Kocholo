        "text": "Jason Terry's summer flirtation with the NBA has led him back to the league.\n\nWell, close to it, at least.\n\nTerry is leaving the Arizona Wildcats' coaching staff and finalizing a deal to coach the Denver Nuggets' G League team, according to a report Thursday from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nWojnarowski wrote in a tweet that Terry \"wanted to get on a path to becoming a head coach after an NBA career that included a championship with Mavs in 2011 and an NBA sixth-man of year award in 2009.\" His new job with the Grand Rapids Gold could put Terry on a path for an NBA bench.\n\nA former national player of the year at Arizona whose No. 31 jersey hangs in the McKale Center rafters, Terry, 43, spent one season on Sean Miller's staff. He was retained, along with associate head coach Jack Murphy, when Tommy Lloyd was hired to replace Miller in April.\n\nAs spring turned to summer, Terry's name began to be linked to NBA jobs.\n\nA story on the Mavericks' website last month said new head coach Jason Kidd reportedly talked to Terry and former Dallas players Tyson Chandler and JJ Barea about possibly joining his new staff. And Terry attended a coaching clinic at the NBA's summer league last week, telling a Dallas reporter \"we'll see\" when asked whether being an NBA assistant is in his future.\n\nDespite the rumors, Lloyd told the Star earlier this month that he was expecting Terry to return.\n\n“Every conversation J.T. and I have had has revolved around Arizona basketball and what we’re doing here,” Lloyd said then. “I can’t predict the future, but I know we’re planning on him being here this year and he’s doing a great job.”\n\nArizona may not have to look far for Terry's replacement. The Wildcats employ two non-coaching staffers with previous college coaching experience: Player relations director Jason Gardner, the former head coach at IUPUI, and special assistant TJ Benson, a former assistant coach at Grand Canyon.\n\nGardner, another ex-Wildcats star whose jersey is retired at McKale, was hired late last month in a support-staffer's role. The expectation was that Gardner would transition back into coaching at some point.\n\nEarlier this month, Lloyd called Gardner both \"a great guy\" and someone with \"a ton of coaching potential.\"\n\n\"He really knows college basketball; he’s played it and coached it,\" Lloyd said.\n\nLloyd still has yet to officially hire a third assistant coach, though Suns player development coach Riccardo Fois has long been a candidate for the job."
