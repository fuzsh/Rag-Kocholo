        "text": "The fact that this was no ordinary game for Jason Terry was clear just moments before tip-off on Wednesday night.\n\nBefore heading out onto the court, the Celtics guard sprinted to the opposing bench and gave Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle a warm embrace.\n\nAfter spending eight seasons with the Mavericks, and winning a championship in 2011 when Carlisle was in charge, Terry went against his former team for the first time at the TD Garden.\n\n“Do I miss him?’’ said Carlisle. “Yeah, we miss him.’’\n\nTerry, who signed a three-year contract with the Celtics last July, struggled with his shot in a 117-115 double-overtime victory over the Mavericks. He made only 3 of 10 from the field, including 1-for-6 from 3-point range, and had 10 points in 48 minutes.\n\n“He missed a lot of shots, but he made them when they counted,’’ said teammate Jeff Green. “Before the game, I told him, ‘You helped me get mine (a win over Green’s former team, the Oklahoma City Thunder), I’ll help you get yours.’ We got the victory and that’s what matters.’’\n\nTerry remains on friendly terms with the Mavericks, and owner Mark Cuban wants to eventually retire his jersey and give him a job in the organization.\n\n“I know it was a business decision (to leave) and all good things come to an end sometimes,’’ said Terry. “This was the timing. I’m just fortunate to end up in a situation where we’re still competing for a championship at this age.’’\n\nCarlisle recalled how Terry willingly accepted being a bench player for the Mavericks.\n\n“The conversation was him saying, ‘Hey, Coach, whatever you need, I’ll do,’” said Carlisle. “ ‘I’ll start, I’ll come off the bench, whatever role you think is best for us to win as a team.’ That’s unique.\n\n“There aren’t a lot of guys wired that way and it’s one of the reasons he’s so beloved in Dallas because he’s about winning and he’s about sacrifice and I’m sure he had the same conversation with Doc (Rivers) when he got here.’’"
