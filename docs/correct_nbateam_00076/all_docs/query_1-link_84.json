        "text": "Jason Terry wasn't always enthusiastic about arriving at the gym for practice sessions, but he's changed his tune since signing with the Boston Celtics.\n\n\"What Doc (Rivers) told be before I came here was, 'Do something different. Change your habits,'\" Terry told reporters at Friday's practice, as seen in a video recorded by WEEI's Mike Petraglia. \"My thing coming to this team was, I hated practice. I've grown to love it over the last month. It's competitive and it brings out the best in you ever day.\"\n\nSadly for Terry, not everything about practice has him so excited.\n\n\"I'm tired of guarding (Rajon) Rondo, I'll tell you that right now. He's wearing me out right now,\" Terry said. \"I don't know if it's the scheme or what we're doing -- but he's definitely worked on his game and he's made it tough on me, boy. When you're a veteran and you've been in this game 14 years, you definitely don't want to be chasing around a 26-year old all training camp. But it's been fun, it's been a challenge.\""
