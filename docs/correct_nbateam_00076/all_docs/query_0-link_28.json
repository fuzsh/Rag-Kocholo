        "text": "6'2\"\n\n176 lbs\n\n35 years old\n\nJason Terry grew up in Seattle, Washington and was the second of 10 children. His mother, Andrea Cheatham, was a Metro bus driver. His father, Curtis Terry, was a high school hoops legend. For most of his young life, Jason had to be the man of the house. He changed diapers, got his younger siblings to bed on time, and filled in when his single mom just didn't have enough hours in the day to accomplish everything.\n\nJason enrolled at Franklin High School and by that time, he was the hardest working player in Seattle. Other city players, such as Jimmy Rainwater and Lovell Brown, made the headlines, but Jason made continual progress with his game. Jason had unusually long arms and a terrific all-around game. He absorbed all the basketball he could while in high school. .Jason led Franklin to the state championship in 1993 and 1994. Though never a scorer in high school, Jason was not afraid to take the final shot for his team."
