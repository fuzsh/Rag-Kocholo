        "text": "The free-agent deals were finalized just three days apart in the first week of July last summer.\n\nJason Terry, after playing eight seasons for the Dallas Mavericks, agreed to a three-year, $15.6 million contract with the Celtics not long before Ray Allen departed Boston to join the Miami Heat with a three-year, $9 million deal.\n\nThe 35-year-old Terry was essentially brought to the Celtics to fill the role that was planned for Allen, namely providing scoring punch off the bench.\n\nTerry, who helped the Mavericks win the NBA championship in 2011, left Dallas on amicable terms after being a key to the franchise’s success in recent seasons.\n\nAllen, on the other hand, had a bitter split with the Celtics, a team he was a central figure on for five seasons, including the run to the 2007-08 NBA title to end the franchise’s 22-year drought.\n\nTonight, Terry returns to the American Airlines Center for the first time since leaving Dallas when the Celtics take on the Mavericks (8:35, TV: Comcast SportsNet; radio: WVEI-103.7 FM) to continue a three-game road trip.\n\nWhen Allen visited the TD Garden in January and this past Monday night, he was roundly booed by fans who didn’t appreciate him leaving the Celtics for their chief rival in Miami.\n\nEvery time Allen’s name was mentioned by public address announcer Eddie Palladino or whenever he touched the ball, the 37-year-old guard heard a negative reaction.\n\nTerry, however, isn’t expected to receive that kind of treatment from the fans in Dallas.\n\nLike Allen during his stay in Boston, Terry was a popular player in Dallas. Unlike Allen, he did not leave to join a team that was a bitter rival.\n\nThe Celtics stepped in and made Terry a better offer than he was going to receive from the Mavericks, and he decided to leave a team that has cleaned house since winning the title.\n\nThere are only three players left from the 2010-11 championship team — Dirk Nowitzki, Shawn Marion and Rodrigue Beaubois — as the Mavericks broke up the title squad.\n\n“Do we wish we would have kept that team together? You’re darn right. To have a chance to repeat, that’s a big factor. You look at Miami. They added pieces. They didn’t subtract. You wish you could go back and change it, but you can’t. Now we’re going forward.\n\n“I know it was a business decision (to leave) and all good things come to an end sometimes.’’\n\nTerry, who averaged 16.1 points in 619 games with Dallas, struggled early with the Celtics and is now scoring 10.2 points, the second-lowest output of his career.\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban has said he wants Terry to work for the organization when his playing days end.\n\nCuban told reporters in Dallas this week he wants Terry to be greeted by a warm reception tonight.\n\n“I hope they give him a standing ovation,” said Cuban. “He’s earned it. He’ll be a Maverick for life. He’s part of the family. Basketball is a short part of your life and then there’s the rest of your life. Hopefully, we’ll be part of Jet’s after he retires.”\n\n|\n\nThe Celtics signed D.J. White and Shavlik Randolph, who have been with the team on consecutive 10-day contracts, for the remainder of the season Thursday."
