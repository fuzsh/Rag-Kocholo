        "text": "After the game, Johnson visited with several players, including Nowitzki and Jason Terry, the only two remaining players from the 2006 Finals squad, and he said hello to Mavs owner Mark Cuban. “It was pretty emotional,” Johnson said. “A lot of friends and family are here tonight that I am going to visit with here in a second. But it was good seeing some of the guys. I had a chance to visit with Mark after the game and a lot of people that meant a lot to me both as a player and a coach.”\n\nThe NBA Players Association’s Dan Wasserman says that, while he understands the logic of Larry Coon’s argument, as someone who has been in on the negotiations, he has found the opposite to be true. “The vast majority of players, 90-percent plus, consistently and overwhelming oppose the age limit,” says Wasserman. “The veterans are smart enough to recognize that it’s a game about competition, and if somebody can do your jobs cheaper, they’re always going to want to replace you whether they’re 18 or 25. There’s a constant attempt to replace expensive players. But if the tactic was to protect the jobs by eliminating the young competition, we’d have an age limit of 21. But players hate that age limit, and want the best players in the NBA.”\n\nWhen Beaubois returns from a broken left foot perhaps some time in December, it is expected that he will start at shooting guard, allowing Terry to remain on the bench. One of the most discussed topics regarding the Mavs is how Carlisle will divvy up minutes. Terry’s 34.8 minutes rank second on the team behind Nowitzki. Terry said he’s not worried about that now. He said his offseason of introspection and relentless work has carried over to the regular season, and helping the Mavs win games is his main concern. “I wasn’t where I had been, for whatever reasons,” Terry said. “It happens. But re-dedicating myself, refocusing in, spiritually and physically, I’m in a good place right now.”\n\nKidd, 38 in March, is much closer to reaching that goal. But Jason Terry, who turned 33 in September, is still determined to be active in the NBA in 2017-18. “Until I’m about 40 or 41,” Terry said in an interview with FanHouse before Wednesday’s night’s 102-101 win at Denver about how long he wants to play. “Why not? As long as I stay healthy. God has blessed me without any serious injuries. I’m a guy who always trains, a gym rat.” Terry draws inspiration from Kidd, an All-Star point guard last season just shy of his 37th birthday. “J. Kidd is a prime example,” Terry said. “The position that I play really is low maintenance, not a lot of wear and tear on my knees. So hopefully I can make it (to 40) … I look at J. Kidd and the things that he did. I’m doing those things that he did later in his career earlier than he’s done. (That includes) focusing in on your legs more in the offseason training program. That has helped me stretch out my longevity.” No slippage has been evident from Terry in his 12th seas on. He scored 20 points Wednesday to raise his average to 17.5, 1.3 above his career mark. “He’s definitely not old at all,” said Dallas star forward Dirk Nowitzki. “He’s still moving the way he was (years ago).”\n\nJason Terry is learning what Shawn Marion and many other NBA players have known about the understated Tim Grgurich. So excited about his week working with “Gurg” after practices at Dallas Mavericks training camp, Terry wanted to share it with the world, via Twitter, of course. “Xtra shootn with gurgs great workout we gotta have him on staff his mojo is real.” Translation: Terry is sold on “Gurg.” The Mavs might be, too. Sources have told espndallas.com that they hope to bring Grgurich on as an assistant under coach Rick Carlisle. The confidant of George Karl in Seattle and Denver, Grgurich recently walked away from the Nuggets, torn over the direction and recent turbulence within the franchise. His decision was a sensitive one. Twelve of his 18 years in the NBA have been with Karl, who is returning to the bench after a difficult bout with throat cancer."
