        "text": "It seems that it is not just current Boston Celtics assistant coaches in the mix to be the next head coach of the Utah Jazz now that current head coach Quin Snyder plans to step down from that role, but now also includes at least one notable Celtics alumnus.\n\nAfter news broke that Boston assistants Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla were potential targets for the Jazz to replace Snyder broke, we are now hearing reports from The Athletic’s Shams Charania that Jason Terry is now a candidate as well. Charania reports that the Grand Rapids Gold coach has been permitted by the Denver Nuggets G League affiliate to interview with Utah for the open head coaching position.\n\nTerry signed with the Celtics in the final season of Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce’s tenure with the Celtics and was traded by Boston along with Pierce and Garnett to the Brooklyn Nets in the 2013 offseason.\n\nTerry remains ties to the Celtics organization to this day, which he spoke about at length in a recent interview with the Celtics Lab podcast.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Celtics Wire.
