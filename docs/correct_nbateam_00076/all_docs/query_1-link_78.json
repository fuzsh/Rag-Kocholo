        "text": "BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Celtics have signed free agent guard Jason Terry.\n\nThe deal was reported earlier this month during a signing moratorium, then held up while the Celtics tried to work out a sign-and-trade agreement with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nInstead, Boston will use its mid-level exemption to sign the 2009 NBA Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 guard averaged 15.1 points per game for the Mavericks last year. He was second in the league with 138 made 3-pointers last season and is fourth in NBA history on the career list with 1,788.\n\nTerry is seen as a replacement for Ray Allen, who signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat.\n\n• • •\n\nLOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers took a strong step toward improving one of the worst reserve units in the league, agreeing to terms with free-agent forward Antawn Jamison.\n\nJamison, 36, averaged 17.2 points and 6.3 rebounds last season with Cleveland and received more lucrative offers from other teams, but none had the playoff potential of the Lakers. He also considered Charlotte and New Jersey.\n\nHe will receive the veteran’s minimum of $1.4 million for one season, a steep drop from the $15.1 million he made last season with the Cavaliers.\n\nHe has career averages of 45.1 percent shooting, including 34.1 percent from three-point range."
