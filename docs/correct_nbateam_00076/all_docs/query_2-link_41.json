        "text": "During a two-game losing streak, the Dallas Mavericks found themselves undermanned as Kyrie Irving, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Josh Green all missed games due to injury.\n\nOn Wednesday night, though, the Mavericks notched a 50-point victory over the Utah Jazz, 147-97, to end the skid in resounding blowout fashion.\n\nHardaway Jr., who missed the last two games due to back spasms, returned to the lineup against the Jazz, finishing with 17 points, four rebounds, and two assists on 5-14 shooting from the field and 4-12 from downtown.\n\n\"For one, I’m healthy,\" Hardaway said of his play so far this season after the win. \"Just having nagging injuries here and there with surgery after surgery last couple years. Now I feel healthy, I feel great out there, I’m moving better. Everything is coming along great.\"\n\nOn the season, Hardaway is averaging 16.8 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game while shooting 38 percent from 3-point range. He’s also stamping his name in contention for Sixth Man of the Year, which is a role that Hardaway has had learn to embrace.\n\n\"For this team, I feel like it was my job to embrace that role, and with previous past Mavericks teams, that sixth man guy — he’s a big deal,\" Hardaway said. \"Jason Terry for example. Just trying to do my best impression of that in the modern-day era.\"\n\nHardaway is right — Jason Terry was a staple in Dallas from 2004-12 and was a vital part to the Mavs' championship run in 2011, averaging 18 points per game in the NBA Finals and scoring 27 points in the series-clinching Game 6.\n\nIf Hardaway can continue to embrace and thrive in his new role — he is currently the odds-on favorite to win Sixth Man of the Year — he and the Mavericks should find themselves in a favorable position come playoff time."
