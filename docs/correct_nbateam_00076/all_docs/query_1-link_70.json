        "text": "Jason Terry didn’t shoot his way out the door or lose anyone’s phone number, and says he doesn’t hold much of any ill will about how his career with the Dallas Mavericks came to an end at the conclusion of last season.\n\nUnlike the Celtics’ drama-filled divorce with Ray Allen, the veteran shooting guard said it was all business when it came to his decision to come to Boston this summer.\n\n\"Really, at this point of my career, I had to go with the best offer,\" he said after Saturday’s 92-79 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in advance of Wednesday’s reunion with the Mavericks at TD Garden. \"The best offer was here in Boston. It offered me another chance to win a championship, and they gave me the most money.\n\n\"That’s just being point-blank, period. I love Dallas. Hopefully, one day my jersey will hang in the rafters there. It’s still home for me. My kids love it, and we go back in the summer.\"\n\nBut when it came to staying there for the rest of his career, Terry didn’t see a fit. Like the Celtics’ situation with Allen and the Miami Heat, Dallas made an offer to Terry that was shorter than the one for which he eventually left to sign. But, unlike Allen and the Heat, Terry did not leave more money on the table to take his talents someplace else.\n\nTerry agreed to sign with Boston for three years at the mid-level exception of $5 million per season shortly after the Mavericks declined to match that offer at the outset of free agency. Allen signed for three years at $3 million per season with the Heat, when the Celtics reportedly offered him $12 million over two years.\n\n\"Definitely, I was disappointed,\" Terry said. \"But this is free agency. It happens. They had their eyes set on Deron Williams — so more power to them.\n\n\"I ended up in a good place (in Boston). That’s what I am blessed and happy about.\"\n\nTerry and Allen both won a championship, and lost an NBA Finals, with their former teams before their respective changes of scenery this summer. But Terry was even more of a fixture in his eight years in Dallas than Allen was in his five in Boston. Terry played 619 regular-season games with the Mavericks to Allen’s 358 with the Celtics.\n\nTerry said he does not expect any awkward, in-game shoulder taps — like the one Allen shared with Kevin Garnett in the middle of the first quarter of the season opener in Miami — when he renews acquaintances with his friends and former teammates on Wednesday.\n\n\"It’s going to be fun for me,\" he said. \"Obviously, I love a challenge, and I never hold back. But there will be some emotions. It will be tough because Dirk (Nowitzki) won’t be playing (because of a knee injury). The only other guy left there that I spent a lot of time around is Shawn Marion, and he (may) be out there. It will be good to shake hands with Rick Carlisle and all the other coaches.\n\n\"My personal friend is (Mavericks strength and conditioning coach) Robert Hackett. We still talk every day.\"\n\nMarion may miss the game with a groin injury. He sat out Saturday’s contest in Houston and is considered questionable for Monday’s game against Sacramento. The Mavericks are 10-10 this season after newly acquired guard O.J. Mayo — in some ways, Terry’s ultimate replacement in the Dallas backcourt — scored 40 points in a 116-109 victory on Saturday.\n\nScott Souza can be reached at 781-398-8006 or ssouza@wickedlocal.com.
