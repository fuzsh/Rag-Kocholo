        "text": "The rule, at least in the sectioned-off seats inside the gyms at NBA Summer League is to not overreact to the results on the court, that the rookies and young players are often not even really in the roles they’ll eventually fill on NBA courts.\n\nBut the assignment for Bronny James on Monday night against the Boston Celtics looked a lot like the one that has been presented for James’ future — defend and shoot. And for the fourth time since the Lakers drafted and signed James, the results were pretty rough.\n\nJames airballed two three-pointers, the crowd groaning as he started ice cold from beyond the arc. The detractors continued to murmur while supporters had to settle for moments such as a deflected pass and a defensive rebound that showcased his 40-plus-inch vertical until he swished a jumper in the fourth quarter for his only points.\n\nRead more:Olympics give LeBron James another chance to show his Midas touch\n\nThen they roared.\n\nWhether he makes or misses shots, James remains one of the biggest stories in Vegas. And so far, he’s mostly missed them.\n\nThe Lakers' summer league team lost its fifth straight game, this one 88-74 to the Celtics, though rookie Dalton Knecht scored 19 points as he continued to show his ability as a multilevel scorer.\n\nAustin Reaves and Christian Wood were courtside, as was Lakers coach JJ Redick and assistants Scott Brooks, Nate McMillan and Greg St. Jean.\n\nThe Lakers play again in Las Vegas on Wednesday night against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers."
