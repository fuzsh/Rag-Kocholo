        "text": "Former Arizona Wildcats guard Jason Terry will continue his basketball career as the assistant manager of the Texas Legends—the G League affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks—it was announced Tuesday.\n\n“It’s great to begin my front office career here,” Terry said in a statement. “The Dallas area has been home to me and my family for many years and the Mavericks franchise has always been family. To get to work with this organization in this capacity is exciting. I look forward to getting started.”\n\nAfter four years at Arizona that included a national championship in 1997, Terry was a first-round pick (10th overall) by the Atlanta Hawks in 1999 NBA Draft. He played in 1,534 NBA games and was the Sixth Man of the Year in 2009.\n\nTerry is most known for his eight seasons with the Dallas Mavericks in which he led the team to their first NBA Championship in 2011.\n\nTerry retired after the 2017-18 season after stints with the Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets, and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nIt was reported that Terry would be exploring coaching opportunities, but evidently he had his sights set on a different aspect of the game."
