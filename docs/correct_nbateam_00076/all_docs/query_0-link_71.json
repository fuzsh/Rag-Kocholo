        "text": "Associated Press\n\nBOSTON - Letting Doc Rivers go to the Los Angeles Clippers was the first sign. Getting rid of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett clinched it.\n\nThe Boston Celtics are rebuilding.\n\nThe Celtics have agreed to the terms of a deal that would send the two remaining members of the Big Three that won the 2008 NBA title to the Brooklyn Nets for a package of draft picks and players. Garnett is a future Hall of Famer, but it's Pierce's departure that signals the end of an era for the league's most-decorated franchise.\n\n\"It's sad to see everybody leave Boston. You just want them to go someplace where they have a chance to win, and they have,\" Rivers said at Clippers draft headquarters late Thursday night. \"It's a great trade for Boston, too; not now, later. Danny wanted to rebuild, and that's what he's doing.\"\n\nThe longest-tenured member of the Celtics, Pierce is the team's captain, a 10-time All-Star and a likely Hall of Famer. He is the second-leading scorer in the history of the NBA's most-decorated franchise, and also is in the team's top seven in rebounds, assists, steals, games and minutes played.\n\nGarnett is also a future Hall of Famer, though only the last six years of his career were in Boston. It's Pierce, who slipped to 10th in the 1998 draft and has been a Celtic ever since, who had a chance to spend his entire career with the franchise and add his name to a list that includes Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Bill Russell and John Havlicek.\n\nBut not Bob Cousy, Robert Parish or even Red Auerbach.\n\n\"(It's) sort of sad. You hate to see it,\" said Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau, who was an assistant on the Celtics 2008 championship team. \"But that's the NBA. It's constant change, and you have to be ready to adapt. I think what Paul Pierce did for that franchise and Kevin - I think's it's good for them. They have an opportunity to continue on. Good for the Celtics, where they can start their rebuilding.\"\n\nPierce was drafted in the Rick Pitino era when the Celtics, already in the midst of the longest championship drought in franchise history, were a year removed from the second-worst record in the NBA.\n\nPitino helped the team reach the Eastern Conference finals in 2002. But, convinced that they were not likely to go farther, Ainge was brought in the next year to tear things apart again.\n\nBoston plummeted back into the NBA lottery and again bad luck prevented them from landing a franchise player like Kevin Durant.\n\nInstead, Ainge swung deals for Garnett and Allen that earned the Celtics their NBA-record 17th championship in the very first year."
