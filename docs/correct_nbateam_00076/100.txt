Former Boston Celtics shooting guard Jason Terry might be making a return to his collegiate alma mater, reports Jeff Goodman’s Stadium.

Terry, who attended Arizona between 1995 and 1999 and winning an NCAA championship there in his sophomore season, is a leading candidate for the Wildcats’ vacant assistant coach slot.

He would be replacing former assistant coach Justin Gainey, who departed to accept the head coaching job recently open at Marquette.

The former Celtic has no coaching experience to speak of at the collegiate or professional level, but does coach for the Lady Drive Nation, an AAU club in the greater Dallas area, reports the Arizona Desert Swarm’s Ryan Kelapire.

Terry came to Boston in free agency in the summer of 2012, and played for the team for just one season, being traded to the Brooklyn Nets along with teammates Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.

He averaged 10.1 points, 2 rebounds and 2.5 assists while with the team.
