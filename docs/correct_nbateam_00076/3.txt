What's a good NBA bench without a nickname?

With the Boston Celtics' second unit finally beginning to carry its own weight, shooting guard Jason Terry decided it's time for a new moniker.

"I've nicknamed the bench 'Gangster Squad' after the new movie that is out," he wrote in his latest diary on ESPN Boston. "I love it as a nickname."

Boston's bench, which struggled to provide consistent production during the early season with Terry spending much of his time as a starter, has averaged 42 points per game over the past three outings, all wins.

"It's how we envisioned it from day one with myself, Sullinger, Jeff Green and Courtney Lee," Terry wrote in his latest diary on ESPN Boston. "We spent all training camp working on that particular group and the chemistry was there, but we never got to put it in motion. Now that it is, you can see how dangerous we are."

Dangerous, indeed. And gangster. Very gangster.
