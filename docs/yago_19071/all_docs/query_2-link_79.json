        "text": "This story is part of Loved and Lost, a statewide media collaboration working to celebrate the life of every New Jersey resident who died of COVID-19. To learn more and submit a loved one's name to be profiled, visit lovedandlostnj.com.\n\nThe last picture that Patty Montgomery took with her father, Michael Bell, says everything about the joy he took in his family and the sense of fun that never deserted him.\n\nWhile Patty and her family have lived in several states, a job change took them back to New Jersey for a few years, making it possible for Patty to see her parents more.\n\nOne day, Michael invited Patty – the oldest of his three children and the only girl – to take a walk with him at the mall.\n\nAs they strolled, he spotted a photographer taking portraits of children with the mall’s larger-than-life-size Easter Bunny.\n\n“Want to get a photo with the Easter Bunny?,” Michael, then 71, asked his middle-aged daughter.\n\n“Sure,” she responded, neither of them realizing that two years later, the photo would become a a priceless remembrance of the special man they would lose on May 13, 2020.\n\nJust a month before her father’s death, Patty had taken a new job in Florida. They’d said a quick goodbye in the driveway, not knowing it would be their last.\n\n“We weren’t able to see him or talk to him before he died,” said Patty. “I know we weren’t the only family like that..”\n\nBorn Dec. 26, 1946 and raised in New York City, Michael Bell joined the Air Force as a young man, then entered the National Guard, where he retired as a Sgt. 1st Class after 33 years. “He absolutely loved it,” Patty said. “He liked to serve.”\n\nHe met his wife, Peggy, in New York City. They’d been married 49 years when Michael died.\n\nThe family moved to Lakewood in 1974, and Michael commuted to his job as a bus mechanic for New York City Transit. Often the work stretched into nights and weekends as Michael earned the overtime that made it possible for Peggy to stay home with Patty and her brothers, Kevin and Michael. And often, he’d have another part-time job on the side.\n\nHome late after another long day, he would bellow, “Helloooo Patrician Anne!”\n\n“That was his greeting to me every time,” Patty remembered. “Growing up, he was always so proud of me. He always made me feel special.”\n\nDespite the long hours he worked, he still attended her dance recitals and the boys’ baseball games, and volunteered with the Lakewood Little League and the town’s emergency management service.\n\n“My father worked a lot,” Patty said. “But when he was with us, he was with us.”\n\nAfter his retirement, Michael worked for the Lakewood library and drove a school bus for the Jackson Township Board of Education.\n\nHe loved Star Trek, Disney World and country music. He loved to talk to people, and he loved to help. “Everyone was his friend,” Patty remembered. “I think he knew everybody in Lakewood.”\n\nWhen she and her brother were kids, Patty recalled, their father would take them to the National Guard installation in Sea Girt, where they could swim and explore the tanks and other military equipment.\n\n“We’re all sitting on the beach, and the waves were bad,” Patty recalled, and her mother was concerned about her getting knocked down by a wave. “Then she’ll learn how to swim,” he told her.\n\nAs they made their way to the water, he said, \"If you go under, don’t panic. Just relax, and you’ll come up. Just deal with the waves. Just go with it.”\n\nIt was a philosophy that he applied to virtually every aspect of his life. When the waters of life got a little rough, he’d say, “Babes, what are you gonna do about it? I can only do what I can do.” But what he could do was plenty.\n\nWhen a parent wasn’t on time to pick up a child from his school bus route, he called to let his supervisor know he was going to wait with the child until the parent got there. And when a local athletic team needed a bus driver to get them to a game at West Point, Michael volunteered.\n\n“His family was very, very important to him,” Patty said. When she married, he was at her side to walk her down the aisle, tears streaming down his face. When her kids were born, he came to the hospital.\n\nAnd when Patty’s son — his grandson Connor — joined the Navy, he was button-bursting proud. “My father would be the first one to salute him and say, “Seaman Montgomery!” Patty said.\n\n“He was pretty amazing,” Patty said. \"He was such a loving man. I was pretty lucky to have him as my dad.”"
