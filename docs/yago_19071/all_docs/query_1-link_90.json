Marked by Success\n\nFaced New Challenges\n\nSources\n\nIn 1990, when he was named chief of the Toledo Fire Department, Michael Bell earned two distinctions: At the age of thirty-five, he became the youngest fire chief among the nation’s metropolitan fire departments. As an African American, he also became the first such person to helm a major fire department in the state of Ohio. Unfazed by the attention on his pioneering role, Bell worked effectively to deal with budgetary, management, and public relations challenges during his first decade as the chief of Toledo’s fire department and survived three changes in the city’s political administration while helping to make Toledo a safer place. Indeed in 2001 the city recorded no fire deaths, the first time in a century that the feat had been accomplished. Stressing diversity, Bell also worked to maintain the presence of minorities on the department’s force and increased minority representation in the Toledo fire department above the city’s minority population as a whole.\n\nMichael Bell was born in Louisiana in 1955 to Norman and Ora Bell. He was one of four sons in the Bell family, who relocated to Toledo, Ohio, around 1960. Bell attended public schools in Toledo and graduated from the north side’s Woodward High School, where he would later be inducted into an alumni hall of fame. Entering the University of Toledo, Bell played for the school’s football team and earned his bachelor’s degree in education in 1978. On March 21, 1980, Bell joined the Toledo Fire Department, where he held a variety of positions over the next decade. The six-foot, 240-pound rookie first worked as a water rescue diver and paramedic before moving into the department’s managerial ranks as a paramedic shift supervisor, training officer, and recruiter. At the time that he was promoted to chief of the Toledo fire department by then-City Manager Thomas Hoover, Bell had risen to the position of captain in the department’s Training Bureau.\n\nPromoted Safety and Diversity as Chief\n\nWhen Bell took the reins of the Toledo Fire Department on August 21, 1990, the thirty-five-year-old became the youngest leader of any metropolitan fire department in the United States. He also made history by becoming the first African American to helm a fire department in one of Ohio’s cities. Both feats presented particular challenges to the new chief. Because he had risen through the ranks so rapidly—going from rookie to chief in just ten years on the force—some observers were skeptical that Bell had enough experience to handle his new job. Others wondered if the rank-and-file would accept Bell’s leadership, as he was part of the first wave of firefighters hired after the department was placed under a consent decree to increase its minority staffing levels. Although seventeen percent of the Toledo Fire Department’s firefighters were African American at the time Bell took over as chief in 1990, the consent decree remained in place to ensure that that level did not drop off.\n\nLike many urban centers, Toledo faced a number of challenges in the 1980s that had a direct impact on its public services around 1990. A declining population\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn in 1955 in LA; son of Norman and Ora Bell. Education: University of Toledo, BA, 1978. Religion: Baptist.\n\nCareer: Toledo Fire Department, officer, 1980-90, chief, 1990–; Joint Regional Terrorism Task Force, Lucas County, Ohio, chairman, 2001–.\n\nAwards: President’s Recognition Award, International Association of Fire Chiefs, 2000; inductee, Woodward High School Hall of Fame.\n\nAddress: Office —Toledo Fire Department, 545 North Huron Street, Toledo, OH 43604. Phone: (419) 245-1125.\n\nand industrial base meant that its tax base was shrinking, which translated into budgetary problems for new equipment and effective staffing levels. The city also had a growing stock of abandoned houses, business, and factories that not only added to the dilapidated appearance of some of its older neighborhoods but presented serious arson risks as well. The structure of the city’s government also complicated the management of the Toledo Fire Department. Although Bell, as chief, was on the front lines in negotiating with the Toledo Firefighters Union, Local 92, he was also accountable to the city manager, who had hired him. In the background of this confusing arrangement were the city’s mayor and city council, who as elected officials had no direct authority over Bell besides the power of their offices to sway public opinion on public-safety issues.\n\nBell dealt with the issue of budgetary constraints by keeping staffing levels at the fire department around 560 members and adding to the training they received to ensure better and more efficient service to the public. After negotiating with the union, Bell succeeded in increasing the number of trained paramedics on the force and worked to have at least one paramedic assigned to each fire station. With eighty percent of the force’s 50,000 fire runs each year pertaining to medical emergencies, the improved training helped to save lives while making the department more efficient in its response and recovery times.\n\nIn order to address the potential for deadly fires in the city’s older neighborhoods, Bell continued efforts to educate the public about fire prevention and to maintain a high level of inspections by fire department officials. The department also benefited from an aggressive demolition program instituted by the city in 1994, which began to eliminate the stock of abandoned buildings that were potential arson targets. As he reflected in a 2002 interview with Fire Chief magazine, “The city’s goal is to demolish three hundred vacant buildings per year, and we’ve been doing it for eight years now. This lessens the potential for vagrants to be in the buildings and trapped by fire.”\n\nFire Chief Tenure Marked by Success\n\nAnother significant challenge to Bell was surviving the city’s sometimes sharp political currents. After voters approved a “strong mayor” form of government, Bell came directly under the authority of newly-elected Mayor Carty Finkbeiner in 1993. Finkbeiner, whose “bottom-line” management style resulted in the departure of almost every department head during his eight years as mayor, ended up being one of Bell’s biggest supporters, despite his initial reservation about retaining the young chief. “I would not trade Michael Bell for any fire chief in the United States of America,” Mayor Finkbeiner told the Toledo Blade in August of 2000, “We are very, very fortunate. I can unashamedly say I love the man.”\n\nBell also earned positive coverage for his extensive volunteer efforts outside of the fire department. A member of the board of directors of St. Vincent’s Hospital, Bell also worked with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Toledo, the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America, the Red Cross, and the Easter Seals Society, among other nonprofit organizations. A member of the True Vine Missionary Baptist Church, Bell enjoyed worshipping at other churches on the weekends. Bell also made frequent appearances in newspaper society columns at various civic and private functions.\n\nAfter ten years as the chief of the Toledo fire department, Bell looked back with satisfaction over the progress he had made in his position. As he reflected in an interview with the Toledo Blade in August of 2000, “My perception of the job when I first took it, I may have underestimated. I didn’t realize how much of a disadvantage I was coming in at, based on the elements of my time on the job, rank on the job, color of my skin, and my being single. But I can honestly say today that I have no regrets about coming in that way and all the hurdles put in front of me. They’ve actually made me a better person and a better fire chief.”\n\nMore important than his tenth anniversary on the job was the accomplishment that the Toledo Fire Department reached the following year, when the city recorded no deaths from fire-related accidents for the first time in at least a century. In part the accomplishment resulted from the department’s fire detector giveaway program, which distributed 600 of the devices to low-income Toledo residents in 2001 alone. Bell also took pride in the fact that no fire fighters had died in the line of duty during his tenure in office.\n\nFaced New Challenges\n\nIn the wake of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, Bell, like other public-safety officials, faced new challenges in protecting the public from lethal attacks. The month after the attacks, Mayor Finkbeiner appointed Bell as the head of the newly created Joint Regional Terrorism Task Force, the agency responsible for formulating and implementing emergency-response programs in case of such an attack. Bell’s management experience and the respect he had earned from his colleagues helped him get the new board off to a solid start, although he admitted that the lack of federal funding was worrisome. “If we train people off-shift, that’s overtime. Those costs are not anticipated in anyone’s budget,” he told the Toledo Blade in March of 2002, adding, “I’m not saying we’re unprepared. I’m saying we can do it better.”\n\nBell encountered another challenge in late 2002 when a group of Toledo fire fighters, the Glass City Black Brothers United, raised allegations that the department was not meeting its affirmative-action goals in its hiring practices. Although the racial composition of the fire department’s personnel exceeded the minority percentage of the population in Toledo, the group claimed that the department had hired only 26 African-American fire fighters since 1992. In response Bell explained that most of the African Americans who took the recruitment test did not receive a passing score and that of the ten recruits to the fire class of 2002, nine failed to pass background checks and one failed the department’s fitness test. He also noted that the minority composition of the latest class of recruits was forty percent, although it did not contain any African Americans. Bell agreed, however, that more mentoring and outreach efforts would help maintain a significant minority presence on the department’s staff.\n\nThe willingness to continue the dialogue over the affirmative-action issue typified the collegial and inclusive reputation that Bell had earned during his time as chief. As he commented in an interview with Fire Chief magazine in 2002, “I guess what I learned is that even as a fire chief, all I need to be able to do is find out which resource to use at what time and we’ll always be successful. There are a lot of people who know a lot of things in this organization, but sometimes—and I’ve seen this in other organizations—they’re never asked for their opinion, so you end up making a mistake because you end up trying to do it all yourself.”\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nPorter, Tana Mosier, Toledo Profile: A Sesquicentennial History, Toledo Sesquicentennial Commission, 1987.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nFire Chief, April 1, 2002.\n\nToledo Blade, May 27, 1997, p. 14; August 20, 2000, p.

After a major fire in Boston in 1631, the first fire regulations in America were established. In 1648, fire wardens were appointed in New Amsterdam (later New York City), thereby initiating the first public fire department in North America. In 1736, Ben Franklin formed the first volunteer fire-fighting company in Philadelphia. Fire fighting was not an easy feat. Fire-fighters numbering up from fifty to one hundred men labored arduously at heavy pumpers of limited effectiveness. The enthusiastic but amateur volunteers were badly organized. Curious onlookers got in the way and looters stole whatever they could. Nearby buildings were often drenched or even pulled down with ropes to stop the fire from spreading; in the 1800s, firefighters also used dynamite to blow up buildings to save cities from complete destruction from a raging fire.\n\nBy the 1700s, independent volunteer fire companies began receiving payment for their services from the insurance company or the property owner. Property owners displayed fire markers outside the building to indicate that they were insured; in some cases, no marker meant no effort would be made to fight the fire. In other cases, only the first arriving companies got paid, which led to fierce competition. Volunteers sabotaged each other's equipment and fought off later-arriving companies, often using fire-fighting equipment as weapons. Often, the building burned down while the firemen brawled.\n\nFire-Fighting Organizations\n\nEarly in 1853 the Cincinnati, Ohio, Fire Department Committee formulated a plan that would entirely change the way fires were fought in America. To end the frequently violent competition between companies, the plan called for full-time, paid city employees to fight fires using a horse-drawn steam engine. The steam pumper would allow four or five men to spray more water on a fire than hundreds of volunteers using hand pumpers. The City Council on 16 March 1853 authorized the plan and the creation of a Fire Department, effective 1 April. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, fire department personnel are either volunteer (nonsalaried) or career (salaried). Volunteer firefighters are found mainly in smaller communities, career firefighters in cities. The modern department, with salaried personnel and standardized equipment, became an integral part of municipal administration only late in the nineteenth century. In some cities, a fire commissioner administers the department. Other cities have a board of fire commissioners with a fire chief as executive officer and head of the uniformed force. In still other cities a safety director may be in charge of both police and fire departments. The basic operating unit of the fire department is the company, commanded by a captain. A captain may be on duty on each shift, although in some fire departments, lieutenants and sergeants command companies when the captain is off duty. Fire companies are usually organized by types of apparatus: engine companies; ladder companies; and squad or rescue companies.\n\nBoston installed the first fire-alarm systems, which used the telegraph and Morse code, in 1852. Many communities are still served either with the telegraph-alarm system or with telephone call boxes. Most fires, however, are reported from private telephones. Many large cities have removed all or many of their street alarm boxes because of false alarms and maintenance problems. Alarms are received at a central dispatch office and then transmitted to fire stations, frequently with the use of mobile teleprinters and computers.\n\nApparatus is dispatched according to the nature of the alarm and location of the fire. Many modern departments are now equipped with computer-aided dispatch systems that track the status of all units and provide vital information about the buildings where fires occur. Typically, on a first alarm, more apparatus is sent to industrial areas, schools and other institutions, and theaters than to private residences. Additional personnel, volunteer or off duty, is called as needed. Fires that cannot be brought under control by the apparatus responding to the first alarm are called multiple-alarm fires, with each additional alarm bringing more firefighters and equipment to the\n\nscene. Special calls are sent for specific types of equipment. Mutual aid and regional mobilization plans are in effect among adjacent fire departments for assisting each other in fighting fires. A superior example of this was exhibited with the 11 September 2001 attack on New York City's World Trade Center, when fire companies from all over Manhattan and from neighboring boroughs responded to the catastrophe.\n\nFire-Fighting Equipment\n\nEarly on, pioneer firefighters fought fires with bucket lines. Men usually formed a line to convey water from the nearest source to the scene of destruction, while the women and children formed a second line to pass empty buckets back to the water source. The first fire engines were developed in the seventeenth century. They were merely tubs carried on runners, long poles, or wheels. The tub functioned as a reservoir and sometimes housed a hand-operated pump that forced water through a pipe or nozzle to waiting buckets. The invention of a hand-stitched leather hosepipe in the Netherlands around 1672 made it possible for firefighters to move nearer to the fire without risking damage to the engine. During the same period, the creation of pumpers made it possible for fire-fighters to use water from rivers and ponds.\n\nIn the early 1900s, stitching on hoses gave way to copper rivets and fifty-foot lengths coupled with brass fittings that enabled firefighters to convey water through narrow passages, up stairways, and into buildings while the pumps operated in the street. The pumper threw a stream of water up to 133 feet while twelve men pumped for a few exhausting moments at a time. In about 1870, rubber hoses covered by cotton came into use. The steam-pump fire engine, introduced in London in 1829, gained popularity in many large cities in the 1850s. Most steam pumpers were equipped with reciprocating piston pumps, although a few rotary pumps were used. Some were self-propelled, but most used horses for propulsion, conserving steam pressure for the pump.\n\nAfter establishing the first professional fire-fighting force, Cincinnati also briefly led the way in technological developments. Cincinnati inventors Able Shawk and Alexander Latta developed \"Uncle Joe Ross,\" the first successful steam fire engine in America. First deployed in 1853, the fire engine had the capacity of the six biggest double-engine hand pumpers and needed only three men to operate it. It could supply three hand companies with water while at the same time shooting a powerful spray of water 225 feet onto the fire. The Ahrens-Fox Manufacturing Company of Cincinnati, an early leader in developing steam engines, replaced the horses with motorized tractors, and produced compressed-air aerial ladders to reach windows of tall buildings. By the 1920s, the last of the horse-drawn engines had disappeared.\n\nWith the development of the internal combustion engine in the early twentieth century, pumpers became motorized. Because of problems in adapting gear rotary gasoline engines to pumps, the first gasoline-powered fire engines had two motors, one to drive the pump and the other to propel the vehicle. The first pumper using a single engine for pumping and propulsion was manufactured in the United States in 1907. Motorized pumpers had almost entirely displaced steam pumpers by 1925. The pumps were originally of the piston or reciprocating type, but these were gradually replaced by rotary pumps and finally by centrifugal pumps, which are used by most modern pumpers. Modern pumpers consist of a powerful pump that can supply water in a large range of volumes and pressures; several thousand feet of fire hose, attached to a hydrant by a short segment of wide hose; and a water tank to be used in places lacking a water supply or to enable firefighters to begin their work while the hose is being attached to a hydrant. In the countryside, pumpers are used along with suction hoses to obtain water from rivers and ponds.\n\nThe late nineteenth century saw other innovations in fire fighting including the chemical fire extinguisher. The first was a glass fire extinguisher, the Harden Hand Grenade Extinguisher. The extinguisher, or grenade, contained carbon tetrachloride, later banned because at high temperatures it emitted a hazardous phosphene gas. The grenade, when tossed into the fire, broke open and released the carbon tetrachloride. The sprinkling system also came into use at this time and fireproof construction materials were developed as well. Several catastrophic blazes in the early history of San Francisco, California, led to other innovations. San Francisco's Fire Department Maintenance Shop Supervisors developed the Hayes Aerial Ladder in 1868 and the Gorter Nozzle in 1886, both of which were adopted by fire departments worldwide. The department was among the first to employ fireboats and to place water towers on many roofs. It also recommended sixty-foot height limits for buildings and fire escapes and standpipes on all multistory edifices.\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, new equipment and materials emerged on the scene: the snorkel truck, equipped with a cherry-picker boom to replace the traditional extension ladder; the super pumper, which is capable of pumping eight thousand gallons of water per minute at very high pressure (used in fighting fires in very tall structures); and foam and other chemicals to fight fires. To fight forest fires, specially equipped airplanes and helicopters are used to drop water or chemicals from the air, and to insert \"smokejumpers\" (firefighters who parachute in) to fight fires in remote locations. In the 1990s, fire companies began using thermal imaging cameras. Infrared technology allows firefighters to see through smoke to locate the seat of the fire and to quickly locate hazardous hotspots. With thermal imaging, large areas of land or water can be searched quickly and accurately, requiring less manpower than do conventional methods. Searches can be conducted efficiently during nighttime darkness or full sunlight, in a variety of weather conditions. Thermal imagers can be used for searches carried out on foot or from automobiles, watercraft, and aircraft.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nDitzel, Paul C.
