        "text": "Michael Bell was born in southern New Jersey but grew up in Elkton, Maryland, a lovely town but a place he was ready to move on from as soon as possible. After graduating in 1981 with a degree in Interior Design and business from the University of Maryland he began his career working in Washington, DC for a commercial interiors firm. Throughout the twenty years of his commercial design experience he always had an interest in purchasing and renovating homes and did so with a house in DC built in 1932 and with a circa 1900 cottage in Maine.\n\nAfter turning 40 he got the career itch and with the desire to try something new began Michael K. Bell Interior Design in 2000, specializing in residential interiors. Thanks to wonderful clients, creativity, attention to detail and an ability to listen and hear what peopleâ€™s needs were for their homes he has had a very successful career with projects published in major magazines but more importantly very happy customers.\n\nIn addition to design Michael loves travel and has been fortunate to visit many corners of the world including Europe, Asia and Africa. He currently resides in West Palm Beach, Florida after living thirty-five years in Washington, DC and five years in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is a gourmet cook and along with his husband, artist Adrian Villeta, loves entertaining family and friends.\n\nNow he is taking his extensive knowledge of home design and gracious living and applying it to real estate. Newly licensed in the state of Florida he not only will he be able to help clients with the sale and purchase of their homes but also help them visualize the potential in properties that they may otherwise overlook."
