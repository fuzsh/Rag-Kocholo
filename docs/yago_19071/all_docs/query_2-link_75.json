Mike was born on July 22, 1963, in Evanston IL but spent most of his childhood in Byfield MA. He graduated from Triton High School in 1981 and attended Texas State University. Mike’s passion was physical fitness and spent many years working as a personal trainer. He also owned his own gym, Body Trends in Salisbury MA.
