        "text": "The public Homegoing Memorial Celebration and Repast for Mr. Michael Bernard Bell will be from 6:30 to 8:00 P.M. on Monday evening, July 14, 2014 at the DeSoto Town Center(Pecan Room), which is located at 207 E Pleasant Run Road - DeSoto, TX 75115, phone (972) 223-8400.\n\nMichael Bernard Bell was born July 5, 1968 to the parents of Marvin and Mamie Bell. He thrived as a child and committed his spiritual life by water baptism at an early age while living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Michael succumbed to eternal rest on July 8, 2014.\n\nMichael graduated from Windsor High School in Windsor, Connecticut. Afterwards, he attended Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. During his career, he worked in various fields before finding a preference for Cosmetology. This later choice peaked his interest and led him to choose a career instructing others in the field of cosmetology.\n\nIn his early years, Michael's family considered him a â€˜fashion icon', because he was meticulous about his attire, fashion and style. He also experienced a unique opportunity of working in very prestigious salons such as; Jose A Bare, Toni and Guy, and ITS Cosmetology Schools in Plano, TX, and many younger stylists shred their appreciation for the many things Michael taught them in jump starting their careers in cosmetology.\n\nMichael was preceded in death by his father, who passed on July 16, 2008. He leaves to mourn and cherish his memory his mother Mamie L. Bell; a brother, Marvin Bell Jr. (Pamela); two sisters, Tara Bell-Adeya and Tennille Bell-Gailes (Allen), three; uncles Matthew Eubanks (Brenda), James Bell II (Delores), and Tommie Bell. Michael also leaves to cherish his memory a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. To his many friends, Michael leaves a legacy of cheerful times and exciting adventures.\n\nMichael never missed an opportunity to show compassion, value, and concern for everyone that he met. He will be sorely missed by all of those whom he encountered and all will remember the many great times they shared with Michael.\n\nMay our many prayers shelter you during your walk through the shadows of death, and may the memory of Michael's contagious laughter comfort us always.\n\nFuneral Arrangements are entrusted to the loving hands of Bethesda Memorial Funeral Home with offices in Dallas and Mexia, TX.\n\nDr. Terry S. Masters- FDIC,\n\nCW Burruss - Mortician\n\nTonya E. Smith - Office Manager;\n\nPhone: 254-237-2175, 254-304-2634,Dallas 214-295-6220\n\nTo send a flower arrangement to the family of Michael Bernard Bell, please click here to visit our Sympathy Store."
