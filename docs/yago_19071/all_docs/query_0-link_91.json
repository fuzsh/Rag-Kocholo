        "meta_description": "Michael Peña is a beloved character actor who has been in a lot of movies and on rare occasions, some episodes of TV, live-action and animated. Some people know him, but he doesn't see himself as a household name. Ever since he played Grubber in The My Little Pony Movie, a film of a series mixing cast members from Los Angeles and Vancouver, I have always been interested in seeing what other voice actors from TV in the United States have crossed paths with him, especially if some of them are all-purpose voice actors who may have crossed paths with The My Little Pony Movie's Tara Strong & Tabitha Saint Germain elsewhere in the United States. This list stops at the first 100 people and everyone here must have at least 3 known named animated roles from 3 different titles.",

        "text": "Christine Helen Lakin was born on January 25th, 1979 in Dallas, Texas. After moving several times as a child, her family finally settled in Atlanta, Georgia, where Christine started her acting career. There, she attended the Atlanta workshop players - a theater group which plays in schools in the Atlanta metro area. Her first audition was for a TV-commercial - \"Got Milk?!\", and after not getting that job, she didn't have to wait long for her next opportunity, which was the part as the young Rose in the civil-war flick Die Liebe einer Spionin (1990), which also starred Christopher Reeve. In 1991, she took her first step towards big fame and landed the role as the tomboyish Al on the Friday night hit Eine starke Familie (1991).\n\nDuring the sitcom's long run, Christine gracefully grew up, graduated from high school in 1997 and made various appearances on other television shows. When Eine starke Familie (1991) was cancelled in 1998, Christine, while attending UCLA and majoring in film, looked for other film roles. She landed jobs in independent films such as Frankenstein lebt (2000) and Kelly sucht das Weite (2000). Hoffnungslos verliebt (2000) was Christine's first wide theatrical film release. Since then, she has had a slew of independent coming-of-age films along with guest appearances on such hit shows as Boston Public (2000), and Opposite Sex (2000). Still attending UCLA and handling a film career, Christine is managing to do what few child actors tend to do, which is continue.\n\nJaneane, the petite woman with the acerbic wit, was born in Newton, New Jersey, in 1964, to Joan, a secretary, and Carmine Garofalo, an Exxon executive. She is of Italian and Irish descent. Janeane had many jobs before breaking into show biz. She worked as a bike messenger, a shoe saleswoman, waitress and temp secretary. Watching David Letterman on TV inspired her to write comedy, and by 1985 she was doing stand up comedy. As such, Janeane has become a cult figure, giving a voice to a generation, venting her frustration at T.V., romance, life in general and anything that ticks her off in particular. Janeane did sketches on The Ben Stiller Show (1992) (an Emmy-winning, but canceled show). She would continue to collaborate with Ben Stiller in future projects. Janeane received 2 Emmy nominations for her work on Die Larry Sanders Show (1992), developing her signature character: a smart, cynical woman with a razor wit. She was not happy with her Saturday Night Live (1975) stint in 1994, and was vocal about it (of course). Transferring her persona from TV to the big screen, she moved on to movies, basically playing the character she had defined for herself. In Romy und Michele (1997) she portrayed a smart, cynical, successful businesswomen with a razor wit, and this time with swear words (in the movie she had developed a brand of cigarettes with fast-burning paper, for the gal on the go; in real life it is alleged she smokes Marlboros). Janeane continues to work in TV and movies, often collaborating with Ben Stiller in a number of movies like Mystery Men (1999), his easygoing style being a counterpoint to her caustic nature.\n\nPaget Brewster is an American actress. Her career started in the early 1990s, but her breakthrough was portraying FBI agent Emily Prentiss in the long-running police procedural series \"Criminal Minds\" (2005-2020, 2022-).

Both of her parents worked as school administrators at Middlesex School, a non-sectarian high school located in Concord. Brewster spend most of her early life in Massachusetts.

Kathy was depicted as a love interest to both Joey Tribbiani (played by Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry).
