        "text": "Michael (Mike) Bell unexpectedly passed away after a brief illness in Colorado on September 17, 2023, at 65 years of age.\n\nMike was a caring husband and father, avid traveler and hunter, and lover of the outdoors. He lived a life rich in experiences that he loved sharing with his family and friends. In his retirement, Mike enjoyed driving his red Corvette, planning and taking family trips, and spending time at his mountain home in Colorado. As the sage and patriarch of the family, Mike could always be trusted to impart his wisdom and knowledge to his congregation of loved ones and selflessly cared for anyone who entered his home.\n\nMike was born in Miami, FL, to Tom and Gerry Bell and, in 1981, Mike married his high school sweetheart, Carolyn (Lyn) Jorgensen, and celebrated 42 years of marriage in May 2023. They have two sons, Logan (Lindsey) of Los Angeles, CA, and Kevin (Savana) of Orlando, FL.\n\nHe attended Florida State University for his undergraduate degree and Villanova University to complete his law degree in 1983. When they returned to their home state in 1986, Mike and Lyn settled in Orlando, where they lived for 32 years. Mike worked with various legal firms in Orlando before starting his own firm in 1996.\n\nHis parents and his younger sister, Marcia, precede Mike in death. In addition to his wife and sons, Mike is survived by his sisters, Lisa Bond (Matt) and Lory Moody; sister- and brother- in-law, Wendy LaRotonda (Jeff) and John Jorgensen (Nancy); as well as several nieces and nephews.\n\nDonations in memoriam can be made to Tunnel to Towers Foundation or the Fremont Community Foundation.\n\nAt the family's request, please no flowers or plants."
