        "text": "Stuart joined the independent living movement as the Executive Director at the historic Center for Independent Living in Berkeley (TheCIL). During his seven-year tenure, he renewed TheCIL’s commitment and vision for a truly inclusive world and nearly tripled the organization’s endowment.\n\nTheCIL adopted the “Be Your Own Normal” slogan and reorganized its services, communications, and operating philosophy around the idea that “normal” is everyone and that we all possess talents, skills, qualities, and responsibilities that contribute to our community. Stuart led the organization in developing and updating programs, including an expanded AT program, new Lifestyles events, a life-changing Residential Access program, and the evolution of TheCIL’s Youth programs. Additionally, he brought new corporate partnerships and attention to TheCIL through the PowerOn! web series and its annual Ed Roberts Day event.\n\nBefore his tenure at TheCIL, Stuart spent more than twenty years as an executive in the sports and entertainment industry, living and working across four continents. He is an avid sports fan with allegiances to his childhood teams—the New York Giants and Knicks—but he’s vowed to be a die-hard fan of the Toledo Mud Hens and University of Toledo Rockets.\n\nStuart has a master’s degree from the New York Institute of Technology and was a graduate assistant in their nationally ranked lacrosse program.\n\nHear origin story of The Ability Center’s podcast, 68 Words told by Stuart James.\n\nRaven is the oldest of nine siblings, born in Toledo on July 3, 2020.\n\nReven’s education began at ten weeks with Smart Start, followed by Puppy Curriculum, Foundations, and the Red, White, and Blue Series. She completed the first and second semesters of final training with ease and graduated from The Ability Center’s Assistance Dog Program at the top of her class.\n\nIt’s no secret that Raven loves to work. She excels at problem-solving, retrieval, finding keys, attending—and sleeping through—meetings, and public speaking, where she can showcase what she’s learned.\n\nSwimming, dock diving, and agility running are some of Raven’s favorite activities when she’s not working. She also treasures family time and cuddling.\n\nRaven currently resides in Maumee with Executive Director Stuart James.\n\nAsh Lemons began his employment at The Ability Center in July of 2002 and is currently the Associate Director. Prior to working at The Ability Center, Ash served 8 years Active-Duty Air Force.\n\nIn 2005 Ash was presented the “Spirit of Democracy” award, by former Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, for his advocacy work in leading multiple County Board of Elections towards greater accessibility and compliance with the Help Americans Vote Act. In 2008 he was recognized by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources as a key advocate in the passage of SB209, which provided expanded opportunities for hunters with disabilities. In 2012 Ash accepted the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging “Innovations—Aging Achievement Award” for his work in creating a programming which greatly expedited community living options for persons unnecessarily living in Nursing facilities. By 2019, after a decade of work, Ash’s Nursing Home Transition team transitioned their 850th individual back into Community Based living.\n\nAsh has served as an appointed member to the Ohio Secretary of State’s ADA advisory committee, as well as The Ohio Governor’s Council on People with Disabilities, and has provided guidance to numerous entities in Northwest Ohio towards becoming more Disability Friendly.\n\nAsh holds an Associate’s degree in Aerospace Technology from the Community College of the United States Air Force; a Bachelor of Science degree in Liberal Arts from Excelsior College (SUNY) and has held an Ohio Realtors’ License as well as an ICC certification as an Accessibility Inspector/Plans Examiner.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Cathy received an associate’s degree in Legal Assisting and has over ten years of experience in customer service and administrative roles. In 2004 she relocated to Sylvania, Ohio, with her husband, where she was fortunate enough to stay home with their son, Marc. Marc was born with multiple disabilities, and he changed her life in ways she never expected. Cathy shares, “There are no words to describe the lessons he taught me in the four short but precious years he was with us.”\n\nCathy says, “Marc is why I am at The Ability Center today. I was seeking to join an organization that made a difference in the lives of others. I started volunteering with The Ability Center in 2009 and officially became an employee in 2010. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to work with such an amazing group of people who are passionate about the individuals we help on a daily basis.”\n\nIn her spare time, she loves to travel, and above all, she enjoys spending time with my family and friends.\n\nAudrey had been in various roles at The Ability Center for four years before being named Volunteer Coordinator for the Assistance Dogs program.\n\nAudrey shares her thoughts about working at The Ability Center, “I feel The Ability Center is a natural fit for me. I’m a very easy-going person, and I love helping others. I like volunteer coordinating because of the volunteers! They each bring different strengths, talents, and wisdom to our program. Together they help us achieve our goals. It’s a joy to watch the process of new puppies and fosters to graduation. Each milestone for the dog and volunteer leads to a purposeful life and rewards the dog and the individual receiving the dog.”\n\nAudrey enjoys camping, exercising, church activities, and spending time with her family in her free time.\n\nKayla has a huge passion for individuals with disabilities, which was inspired by her late cousin, Samantha who had SMA. Kayla states that “Samantha opened my eyes to a world I wasn’t aware of; and was my first experience with inclusion.”\n\nIn 2010 Kayla moved to Burton Texas to work at Camp for All, which is a barrier-free camp that is uniquely designed to serve both children and adults with multiple challenges. The outcomes for every activity are about emotional healing and helping campers realize they are not defined by their challenge. Their mission is to discover life, and Kayla states that is when she truly discovered what she wanted to do with hers.\n\nKayla moved back to Toledo and attended Owens Community College and The University of Toledo, where she graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in education. She spent 12 years in the education field where she held various roles including a braillist, a behavior therapist, a classroom teacher and a program director where she did community outreach and programming for at risk youth and their families.\n\nKayla lives in Toledo with her husband, two daughters and their two dogs. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her family and friends, reading, and volunteering in the Fine Arts theatre program that her daughters are involved in at St. Pius X Elementary.\n\nBorn and raised here in Toledo, I attended Central Catholic and joined the workforce directly thereafter. Decades of toiling in the supply chain made me realize that I craved something more meaningful out of my work week.\n\nI understand the importance of an organization such as ACT and what it can mean to individuals and families with specific needs. My life is deeply connected to those with significant disability, my spouse, half brother and cousin.\n\nI stumbled across the opportunity to join the ACT team and was immediately intrigued. This position was right in my wheelhouse and I knew I could make a difference with both my work and personal experience.\n\nOutside of work I spend most of my time at home with Racheal and our 2 dogs Rusty and Remy. Dog walking, bike riding, board gaming and watching the Dallas Cowboys occupies my free time.\n\nJordan has been working at Assistance Dogs since the summer of 2013. She has always owned and loved many kinds of animals- but dogs are her favorite. Jordan has many years of experience working in a variety of settings to serve individuals that have disabilities. When she discovered that she could have a job where she could work with people AND dogs, it was a dream come true!\n\nJordan is the Client Services Coordinator. Jordan conducts initial interviews, home visits, assists in client training, and supports all of the graduates and their dogs. Jordan loves getting to build a relationship with each client she works with. There are many things she loves about her job, but her favorite days are when her clients get to meet their assistance dog for the first time. She absolutely loves partaking in the client experience of this powerful program and seeing all the magic that happens once a client receives their assistance dog.\n\nJordan graduated from Bowling Green State University with a Bachelor’s degree in Human Development and Family Studies. She currently lives in Monclova with her husband, 2-year-old son, and dog. In her free time, she loves to exercise, go horseback riding, be outdoors, travel, and spend time with her family and friends.\n\nJulie joined Assistance Dogs as the Client Services Coordinator in October 2022.\n\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Wright State University and while there, she worked as an Adapted Recreation Assistant for the Office of Disability Services and volunteered with 4 Paws for Ability – it was these opportunities that allowed her to discover her passion for working with both individuals with disabilities and dogs. Julie has also earned her Animal Assisted Therapy certificate through the Animal Behavior Institute and has 9 years of experience working at Anne Grady Services as a Recreation Coordinator and as a Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professional.\n\nJulie and her husband live in Liberty Center with their Australian Shepard, Izzy. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, travelling, reading, and gardening.\n\nKatie has been interested in working with animals since a young age. Growing up, Katie spent weekends traveling to local zoos with her parents and older sister. In middle school, Katie joined the Toledo ZOO Teen volunteer program and volunteered over 800 hours over the next four years. This is when Katie decided she wanted to be a zookeeper. Katie completed a Bachelor of Science in Biology with a concentration in Ecology and Organismal Biology and a minor in Sustainability Studies from the University of Toledo.\n\nAfter graduating, Katie accepted a position as a seasonal zookeeper at the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
