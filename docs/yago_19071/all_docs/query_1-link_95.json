Toledo’s then current Mayor Michael Bell (who was Fire Chief at the time) arranged for the donation of a used fire truck, and the Tanga Sister City committee raised funds to ship it to Tanga.\n\nThe fire truck proved instrumental in not only for putting out fires but to act as a water supplier in areas where residents could not find water.\n\nOne of the many community fund raising events in Toledo, Ohio to ship the fire truck to Tanga, Tanzania."
