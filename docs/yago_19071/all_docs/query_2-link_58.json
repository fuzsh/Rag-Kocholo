        "text": "Michael Bell originated an American folk music program at KGNU. In this interview, he explains how he became interested in folk music and in radio. During his college career at Harvard, he studied the history of the English language, which led to studies of Icelandic, the Norse sagas, and folklore. He also became an announcer on the college radio station. At the same time, the American folk music revival was gathering steam. A teaching appointment at the University of Colorado brought him to Boulder in 1974. A few years later, as KGNU was starting up, Mike volunteered to host a folk music program, which he named \"Highway 322\". He retired from CU and from the radio program in 2008, but the show continues to be broadcast. During the interview, he also relates anecdotes about various folk music luminaries that he has encountered during his career."
