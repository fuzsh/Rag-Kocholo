        "text": "Mandolin and Banjo\n\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, Mike Bell cut his musical teeth with the Outhouse Shouters, a family string band with his two brothers, his father, and an older cousin. Since then, he has played in many groups, most notably the Barn Owl Band, with whom he recorded three albums and appeared on the National Public Radio Show A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nMike is both a classical and a grassroots composer, and he composes much of Graminyâ€™s music. His folk tunes have been recorded by many folk artists."
