Mike was born on July 22, 1963, in Evanston IL but spent most of his childhood in Byfield, MA. He graduated from Triton High School in 1981 and attended Texas State University. Mike's passion was physical fitness and spent many years working as a personal trainer. He also owned his own gym, Body Trends in Salisbury, MA.

He touched everyone who knew him and will be missed by many.\n\nHe leaves behind his parents, John and Bernadette Bell of Amesbury, his siblings, John Bell and his wife, Paula of Acton Maine, Steven Bell of Portsmouth, NH, and Mark Bell of Amesbury Ma and his sister and best friend Kathy Allen and her husband, Jack of South Paris Maine.\n\nHe also leaves behind four nephews, Matthew, Thomas, Andrew and Jake and one niece, Caroline. His greatest joy in life was spending time with them.\n\nMike also suffered with severe complications from Juvenile diabetes his entire life. His strength and determination in dealing with his life-long health issues was truly an inspiration to all who knew him.\n\nCalling hours will be from 4 to 7 p.m. on Monday, August 29th at the Conte - Giamberardino Funeral Home, 14 Pleasant Street, Georgetown, MA.
