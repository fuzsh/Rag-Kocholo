        "text": "Michael passed away peacefully, aged 82, at the Garry J Armstrong Nursing Home after a long struggle with Parkinson’s Disease. Loving husband to Christine (née McCook), and devoted father to Kate (Jonathan Brown), and Hugh (Stefanie Greenberg). He took great pleasure in the antics of his four grandchildren: Doug, Gabi, Jett & Kaia. Also grieving his loss is a large, loving family, including his brother Roger Bell (Ellen Culver), and many brothers and sisters-in-law, cousins, nephews and nieces spread all over the world. Michael was born in Montreal to Elizabeth (Brown) and Harry H Bell. He attended Bishop’s College School and later graduated from Queen’s University (BCom ’61). He joined the Canadian Foreign Service later that year. After completing Foreign Service Officer training which included a famous cross-Canada FSO training trip, he served as trade commissioner in Oslo, London, Lima, Madrid, and Moscow, and later as Ambassador to Peru, Bolivia, Russia, the former Soviet Republics, and finally to the Netherlands. While on local assignment, Michael worked as Assistant Deputy Minister for Latin America and the Caribbean. Michael was a kind and gentle man with a penchant for mischief, ever the tease but also very quick to laugh at himself. He was a pensive man with a busy mind and quiet wisdom, an ardent collector, and chronicler of experiences and stories. He had a profound understanding of Canadian diplomatic roles, strengths, objectives, and obligations. He never sought the limelight, but was passionate about the Foreign Service, once commenting that it was like getting a new job every few years but never leaving the company. He savoured living history-in-the-making, and the adventure that each posting offered. Amongst his many incredible experiences, he travelled with the Canadian Navy by HMS Yukon on a training trip from Lima to Quito, flew up the Amazon in a float plane to visit the Canadian missions along the Napo River, travelled the Silk Roads with UNESCO by ‘caravanserai’, documented first hand the Moscow Coup, flew in an F16 fighter jet with the Royal Netherlands Air Force and hosted the Canadian veterans for the 50th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands.\n\nHe is to be interred in Ottawa’s Beechwood Cemetery following a private family service. No flowers thank you. If desired, donations may be made in Michael’s memory to:\n\nParkinson’s Research Consortium (uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute)"
