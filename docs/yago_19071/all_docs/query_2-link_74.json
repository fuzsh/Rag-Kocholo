        "text": "Michael Joseph Bell, 73 passed away suddenly on Saturday, November 26 at St. Clair hospital. Born in New Brighton, Pa he was the son of the late Thomas Bell and Catherine Clark Bell of Naples, Fl.\n\nMike, affectionately known as \"Big Mike\" by his family was the greatest Pittsburgh sports fan you'd ever meet. He went to St. Xavier Academy and graduated from Hempfield area High School in 1969. He worked at Troutmans department store in Greensburg before moving to Naples Florida where he worked at Pelican Bay golf course. He returned home to Pittsburgh to fulfill his love of Pittsburgh sports and to be near family.\n\nMike was big in stature, but was gentle and kind to all who had the good fortune to know him. He always lit up the room with his excitement and positive energy. Mike was quick to say hello and never had a negative thing to say about anyone. Mike loved animals, music and attending social events at his residences in the Hampshire House Apartments and more recently at St. Thomas Moore Manor.\n\nHe is survived by his brother Tom Bell (Kathy)of Peters Township, nieces and nephews Mark Benko (Heather), Brian Bell (Kimberly), Steve Bell (Tina), Megan Mongillo (David), KC Fritz (Mike) and many great nieces and nephews.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by his loved ones and friends. It will be impossible for anyone in his family to ever cheer \"Here we go Steelers!\" without thinking about Mike.\n\nA funeral mass will be held for Mike this Saturday, December 2 at 10:30am at St. Catherine Laboure Parish, St. Louise de Marillac Church, 320 McMurray Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15241. Interment at St. Vincent's Cemetery in Latrobe, Pa. Please add or view tributes at www.beinhauer.com"
