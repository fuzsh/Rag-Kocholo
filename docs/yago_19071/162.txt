In the 2013 mayoral election, Collins defeated incumbent Independent mayor Michael P. Bell, winning 55.37% of the total vote.[3][4]

He was married to Sandy Drabik and had three daughters and a son (who died in 2000).

Coronary episode and death

[edit]

On the afternoon of February 1, 2015, television news bulletins reported that Collins had been hospitalized with what was described as a "coronary episode".[6] That night the mayor's spokesman announced that Collins was in critical condition after suffering a coronary arrest before being resuscitated.[7] Because he was unable to perform his mayoral duties, Toledo City Council president Paula Hicks-Hudson was sworn in on February 1, 2015, as acting mayor.[8] She is Toledo's first African American woman to lead the city.[8] Collins died on February 6, 2015, at the age of 70.[9][10]
