While sophomore quarterback Jameis Winston overcame to a slow start to put forward perhaps the gutsiest effort of his career by leading the team from behind with a twisted ankle, this week’s Florida State Football Player of the Week goes to a true freshman.\n\nDalvin Cook takes home the honors after finishing with 150 yards from scrimmage on just 13 touches. Cook finished with 110 yards rushing on just nine carries and 40 yards receiving on four grabs.\n\nCook found the end zone twice on runs of 40 and 38 yards. His 38-yard touchdown rush with 3:46 to play put the Seminoles ahead for good as FSU overcame an early 21-0 deficit to top Louisville 42-31.\n\nCook now has 380 yards rushing and five touchdowns for the season. Cook is second on the team in both categories behind only fellow running back Karlos Williams. Florida State will look to improve to 9-0 as it hosts Virginia on Saturday night.\n\nShareTweetSeminoles Tickets\n\nAbout Mike Ferguson\n\nMike Ferguson is a Bloguin contributor, the editor of Noled Out and a lifetime Florida State sports enthusiast.
