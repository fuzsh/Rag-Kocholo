        "text": "TALLAHASSEE, FL (WTXL) -- Another Florida State football player is under investigation for battery. According to State Attorney Willie Meggs, a warrant has been issued for Florida State running back Dalvin Cook on battery charges.\n\nAccording to court documents, the victim called police after she had been hit in the lip by an FSU football player. Once police arrived on scene, they noted that she did have a busted lip and appeared to be intoxicated.\n\nPolice said that the victim claimed that she got into a fight with someone after that person asked her to have sex and she said no.\n\nAccording to court documents, Cook walked over to diffuse the situation, but he and the victim eventually began to argue. That is when, according to court records, Cook hit the victim several times.\n\nCook later told police that he did not remember getting into a fight with anyone, documents show.\n\nThe alleged incident with Cook happened the night before the incident where De'Andre Johnson was accused of punching a woman at a bar. Video released in that incident shows Johnson hitting the woman. Johnson was kicked off of FSU's football team after that incident.\n\nCook has also been suspended indefinitely from the football team, the athletic department announced in a statement."
