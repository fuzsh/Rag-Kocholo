        "text": "There are no cutesy crab-leg jokes to go with Florida State’s latest team discipline story. We’re talking now about violence against women, so brutal a behavior that anyone with half a brain or a heart instinctively knows it is wrong.\n\nSo what should Jimbo Fisher do about it? A lot, and he’s only getting started, but the coach’s first move last week was a knee-jerk prohibition on players visiting campus-area bars and nightspots.\n\nLocation, location, location. That’s the answer to everything, right? If players aren’t around women at bars, they won’t punch women at bars. Maybe they’ll punch somebody else somewhere else, but by golly it won’t be women at bars.\n\n(RELATED: Jimbo's journey from W. Va. coal miner's son to Florida State coach)\n\nTo be fair, this isn’t Jimbo’s only strategy.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat reports that Jimbo brought in a motivational speaker on Thursday to lead the team in an interactive session on the fundamental question of what it means to be a man. FSU President John Thrasher has been over to the football complex, too, to read the riot act.\n\nSurely, Jimbo’s got other things cooking, too, in the way of education and intimidation. He’s startled. He’s confused. But most of all, the coach has been thrown into something of a mild panic.\n\nAfter all, if a young man is so badly wired that he will hit a woman in the face, he can’t be repaired by simply keeping him out of bars.\n\nWhat about co-ed classes? Or the student union? Is anywhere safe from the conditions that lead to conflict? Maybe the best thing is to sequester the football team on its own side of campus, where coursework can be absorbed and completed in the secure setting of a computer lab.\n\nThat’s ridiculous because this extreme approach takes the college out of college football, not to mention blaming every factor but the football player himself for his own bad behavior.\n\nSo Jimbo must show that he understands the gravity of the situation. Unless Dalvin Cook is cleared of battery charges and the specific accusation that he punched a woman multiple times in the face, he must be kicked off the team. On top of that, FSU’s leading rusher can’t be allowed to play while the case is being investigated.\n\nDon’t throw the Jameis Winston situation at me here.\n\nFSU’s Heisman Trophy quarterback continued to play in 2013 while being investigated in a possible rape but no charges were ever filed and no violation of the university’s student-conduct policy was determined. Thus, Jimbo could counter the criticism with the notion that holding his star out over a case that fizzled would not have been just.\n\nNow, though, this coach with such a big heart for players can’t afford to be soft.\n\nEven without the slam dunk of video evidence, which is what got former Seminoles quarterback De’Andre Johnson dismissed from the team, Jimbo must demonstrate that the surest way to forfeit FSU playing privileges is to be associated in any way whatsoever with violence against women.\n\nOne last thing before anyone decides that recruiting thugs is what has FSU in more trouble than most lately.\n\nCook was a solid Florida commit before he switched to FSU in late 2013, robbing Will Muschamp of a five-star offensive force he badly needed. Miami’s Al Golden also wanted Cook, one of his locals (Miami Central), but couldn’t get him.\n\nNot saying it’s the case, but would it have mattered greatly if any of these coaches had wondered about Cook’s maturity or character during the recruitment process?\n\nThink back to what Urban Meyer should have known, must have known, about Aaron Hernandez when recruiting him to Florida and you’ll have the answer."
