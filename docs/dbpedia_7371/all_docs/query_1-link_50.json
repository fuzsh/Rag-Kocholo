        "text": "Florida State running back Dalvin Cook was suspended indefinitely by the team Friday after reports that he punched a woman outside a Tallahassee, Fla., bar.\n\nCook, 19, was charged with misdemeanor battery in relation to the June 23 incident, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nEarlier this week, freshman quarterback De’Andre Johnson was dismissed from the Seminoles football team after a video surfaced of him punching a woman in a bar, the day after the incident reportedly involving Cook took place at another location. Johnson, 19, also was charged with misdemeanor battery.\n\nThe woman involved in the second incident claimed she was approached by a man who asked for her phone number.\n\n“I told him I had a boyfriend and wasn’t interested,” the woman told ESPN.com.\n\nCook then joined the man and an argument ensued before the football player allegedly punched the woman several times in the face.\n\n“They kept telling me they were football players,” she said. “They kept telling me to Google them. They told me they were football players and they could buy me in two years.”\n\nThe police report, which was heavily redacted, indicated that the woman was intoxicated and suffered minor cuts and bruises.\n\nCook led the Seminoles with 1,008 rushing yards with eight touchdowns last season. He recently was named to the Maxwell Award watchlist for the college football player of the year.\n\nThe school appeared to have removed Cook’s likeness from an image announcing his and three of his teammates’ presence on other award watchlists."
