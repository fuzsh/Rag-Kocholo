        "text": "Sandalwood High graduate DeMarcus Walker and teammate Dalvin Cook have earned official NCAA consensus All-American status.\n\nThe NCAA recognizes consensus All-Americans as players who had the most first-team selections at their position (with a minimum of two) on five recognized organizations: Associated Press, Football Writers Association, Sporting News, Walter Camp Foundation and the American Football Coaches Association. Second- and third-team picks are used to break ties.\n\nCook was a unanimous first-team selection by all five organizations. Walker was named first team by Walter Camp, AFCA and Sporting News, and second team by AP.\n\nWalker and Cook are the 37th and 38th consensus All-Americans in Florida State history, and the 11th and 12th under coach Jimbo Fisher. Cook is the 14th player in school history to be a unanimous first-team selection and the first running back.\n\nFlorida State has had at least one consensus All-American during each of the seven years Fisher has been the coach, the longest active streak in the nation.\n\nCook had 1,620 yards and 19 touchdowns during the regular season and is third in ACC history with 4,319 yards.\n\nWalker was named ACC defensive player of the year by both the media and coaches. He is tied for the nationwide lead in sacks with 15 and leads FSU with 64 tackles and 17.5 for losses. He is the sixth FSU defensive player to earn consensus All-American honors."
