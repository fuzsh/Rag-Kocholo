        "text": "Cook over 1,000, but fumbles costly\n\nPASADENA, CALIF. | It was unfortunate for Florida State's Dalvin Cook that he realized a coveted season-long goal for running backs, yet committed a costly turnover at the same time - then added another devastating miscue a few minutes later.\n\nCook, who had already broken the Seminoles' freshman record for single-season rushing and touchdowns (eight), entered the game with 905 yards on the ground. He had 90 by halftime and after gaining 1 yard on his first carry of the third quarter, broke through for a 10-yard gain to pick up an apparent first down for FSU to the Oregon 31 - and go over the 1,000-yard mark.\n\nHowever, Oregon linebacker Derrick Malone ripped the ball from Cook's grasp for the strip and fumble recovery. The Ducks needed only five plays to go 69 yards the other way for a 3-yard touchdown by Royce Freeman (Oregon's freshman 1,000-yard rusher) to increase their lead on the way to a 59-20 victory.\n\nThe turnover interrupted some momentum Florida State had generated after cutting Oregon's lead to 18-13 at halftime.\n\nAs if that weren't bad enough, Cook fumbled again after picking up a first down, this time on an 11-yard pass reception later in the third quarter. Two plays later, Marcus Mariota connected with Darren Carrington for a 30-yard score.\n\nCook, a Miami native and Florida's Mr. Football last year, is the ninth 1,000-yard rusher in FSU history and second in a row. Devonta Freeman, also from Maimi, gained 1,016 yards last season, also cracking the barrier in the Rose Bowl, in the BCS national title game against Auburn.\n\nMost points allowed\n\nWhen Mariota scored from 23 yards out early in the fourth quarter and Thomas Tyner from 21 yards on the next possession for the Ducks for a 59-20 Oregon lead, it was the most points the Seminoles had given up a bowl game in history.\n\nThe previous high was in a 52-20 loss to Florida in the 1996 Sugar Bowl, a game with the national championship in the balance.\n\nFSU had not given up more than 31 points in a bowl since a 35-28 loss to Kentucky in the 2007 Music City Bowl. The Seminoles gave up 31 to Auburn in their BCS title game victory last season.\n\nNot ready for two\n\nThe Florida State PAT defense team appeared unprepared for the two-point conversion pass from backup Oregon quarterback Taylor Alie to Christian French following the Ducks' first touchdown of the game.\n\nOdd, since Oregon does it enough times.\n\nOne of the quirks of the Ducks' offense is the number of times coach Mark Helfrich goes for two points after scoring the opening touchdown of the game. It was the sixth time this season that Oregon has disdained the conversion kick, and fourth time it was successful.\n\nOregon lined up in a variation of what former Florida coach Steve Spurrier called the \"Emory and Henry\" formation, and Alie took a direct snap, then lobbed the ball to French - who is listed as an outside linebacker.\n\nAll of Oregon's two-point attempts following opening touchdowns have involved Alie. He has made it on runs two-of-three times and on passes two-of-three times.\n\nStreak broken\n\nTony Washington's recovery of a Winston fumble and subsequent 58-yard touchdown in the third quarter was the first time in 42 games that FSU had allowed a defensive score.\n\nThe last time that happened was in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando against Notre Dame. Zeke Motta took a fumble back for a touchdown but the 'Noles came back to win 18-14.\n\nThe fumble was Winston's 19th turnover of the season. He had an interception or fumble in all but three games.\n\n'Noles fans in L.A.\n\nFlorida State fans were out-numbered by Oregon fans at the Rose Bowl but Southern California residents who root for the Seminoles did their part to support their team.\n\n\"I used to be a Miami fan but I've come to love FSU over the years,\" said Billy Smith of Pasadena, who was tailgating with a dozen family members, most of them wearing 'Noles shirts and jerseys. \"There are a lot of FSU fans around here.\"\n\nJimmy Ramos of Highland Park, located halfway between Pasadena and Los Angeles, said he became a Seminole fan during the era in which FSU won its first national championship.\n\n\"I grew up loving Charlie Ward and Warrick Dunn,\" he said.\n\nThere are Seminole Booster clubs in Los Angeles and San Diego. The LA club held parties this week in Hermosa Beach, Pasadena and Los Angeles, and has regular viewing parties at four Southern California sports bars.\n\nEtc.\n\nThe game was the 23rd time in which both teams were ranked among the top-five, in this case the College Football Playoffs ranking. The lower-ranked team was 12-10 entering the game. ... The officiating crew, which made several controversial non-calls, was from the SEC. ... Oregon and FSU had never met before the Rose Bowl. The Seminoles entered the game 9-1 against the current make-up of the Pac-12 and Oregon is 3-5 against the teams now in the ACC. Four of Oregon's eight games against the ACC were against Pitt (2-2), which just completed its second season as an ACC member."
