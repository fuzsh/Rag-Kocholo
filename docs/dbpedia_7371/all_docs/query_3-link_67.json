        "text": "Dalvin Cook did not waste any time expressing his feelings once news broke that the Minnesota Vikings would release the running back contract this Friday.\n\nInitially, the Vikings were set to make a last-ditch effort to trade Cook, however with no deal forthcoming the decision were either release him so that he could be re-signed for significantly less money, or release him completely so the player could attempt to sign for a team of his choice.\n\nESPN reported that the Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins are both considered premier destinations interested in the services of the Pro Bowl running back as they look to bolster their backfield depth leading into next season.\n\nThree hours after the announcement, Cook posted a series of photos of himself, ironically stationed in Florida. The first was a throwback photograph of him at Florida State University getting ready for a college game day. But the second image showcased the running back dancing in his Vikings uniform at Hard Rock Stadium -- the home of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIt's no secret that Cook admires the Dolphins organization. To confirm that notion, his strength and conditioning trainer Nick Hicks, who is also the trainer of Miami QB, Tua Tagovailoa, revealed that if every team gave him the same offer in the NFL, he would not only choose the Miami Dolphins as his current team but would also love to retire as a franchise player.\n\n\"He (Cook) will always have love for Minnesota.,\" said Hicks on Phinside the NFL. \"You know, they took a chance on him. He's had an amazing career there. But who knows, I mean he's a South Florida boy through and through. He wants to be here, and he wants to end his career here.\"\n\n\"If push came to shove and offers came on the table, I know 100 per cent in my heart that he would be a Miami Dolphin. If every team offered him a deal and the Dolphins had a little bit less on the table, I believe he'd pick the Miami Dolphins.\"\n\nCook has spent his entire six-year NFL career as a member of the Vikings, with his upcoming release signalling his first crack at free agency. Last March, the Vikings re-signed backup running back Alexander Mattison to a two-year contract with $7 million as an insurance policy, cutting the $14 million cost to keep in half.\n\nCook is also not a stranger to publically reacting towards his dealings with the organization. He previously posted a photo of himself on his Instagram page, purposely covering up the Vikings logo after refusing to take a proposed pay cut to stay with the team.\n\nIn addition to social media antics, Cook was also not participating in the voluntary portion of the Vikings' offseason program. Now that he'll be gone from the team, there will be no worries for the player to miss any mandatory minicamps later in the month."
