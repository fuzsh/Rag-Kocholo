        "text": "The New York Jets are waiving former Florida State star running back Dalvin Cook just before the final week of NFL play, according to Adam Schefter. The former Jets running back appeared in 15 games this season, starting in just one of those games.\n\nCook rushed for 214 rushing yards on 67 attempts while adding 78 receiving yards on 15 catches for the Jets. He was the backup to Breece Hall with the Jets as their season went far from where they expected.\n\nThe Jets made a move to trade for Aaron Rodgers, who was hurt in the season opener. Since then, their season was derailed and they're looking to build back up for next season when Rodgers returns.\n\nIt appears Cook isn't in those future plans, though, as Hall is the primary back featured in the offense and that wasn't bound to change.\n\nIn his seventh season, Cook picked up ten first downs while in his backup role and had a season-long rush of 14 yards. Given the fact of coming off four straight Pro Bowl selections, seeing Cook provide so little for his team seems uncharacteristic, and he should be able to be a real contributor wherever he next chooses to play.\n\nAccording to Schefter, Cook is restructuring his contract to waive any remaining guarantees on his contract, allowing him to be a full-blown free agent and start over.\n\nThe former Seminoles star spent three years in Tallahassee from 2014 to 2016, tallying 4,464 career rushing yards and 46 rushing touchdowns. He added 935 receiving yards on 78 receptions, catching two passes for touchdowns.\n\nCook was selected as a consensus All-American in 2016 while leading the ACC in rushing yards for the 2015 and 2016 college football seasons.\n\nNow, Cook has the opportunity to once again select his next NFL team, and the former Seminole should look for an opportunity to potentially compete for a starting job.\n\nREAD MORE: Two Former FSU Football Players Decommit From FAMU, Re-enter Transfer Portal\n\nStick with NoleGameday for more coverage of Florida State football throughout the offseason."
