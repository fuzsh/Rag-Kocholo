        "text": "Junior running back Dalvin Cook was named one of three finalists for the 2016 Doak Walker Award by the PwC SMU Athletic Forum on Monday night.\n\nCook is joined as a finalist for the national running back of the year award by Texas’ D’Onta Foreman and San Diego State’s Donnel Pumphrey.\n\nThe 2016 Doak Walker Award recipient will be announced live on ESPN during The Home Depot College Football Awards airing from the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta on Dec. 9 at 7 p.m. The award will presented at the 2016 Doak Walker Award Presentation Banquet in Dallas on Feb. 18, 2017.\n\nCook has put together a resume’ that could make him Florida State’s first-ever Doak Walker Award winner. The Miami, Fla., native ranks second among Power 5 running backs with 1,467 rushing yards and 1,867 yards from scrimmage to go along with 18 touchdowns heading into this Saturday’s clash with No. 13 Florida at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee.\n\nIn his last game, Cook rushed for 225 yards and a school-record-tying four touchdowns at Syracuse. He took his second carry of the game 41 yards to break Warrick Dunn’s 20-year-old Florida State career rushing record. Cook is now the FSU career rushing leader with 4,166 rushing yards and is tied with Greg Allen for the most rushing touchdowns in FSU history (44).\n\nCook has rushed for 100 yards seven times in 2016, including a pair of 200-yard games. He had 267 rushing yards and 329 total yards at USF and became the first FSU running back to rush for 100 yards and gain 100 yards receiving in a game versus North Carolina. His 14.8 yards per catch average leads all running backs in the nation.\n\nCook, Johnson and Burns Grab ACC Weekly Honors\n\nFor the third time this season, at least three Seminoles have been named Atlantic Coast Conference Players of the Week after Florida State’s 45-14 win over Syracuse last Saturday. Cook, Roderick Johnson and Brian Burns were recognized by the league Tuesday.\n\nCook was named the league’s top offensive back for the second time this season after his 225-yard, four touchdown performance against the Orange. On his second run of the game, he went 41 yards and in the process passed Warrick Dunn as the Seminoles all-time leading rusher. He enters the Florida game this week with 4,166 yards, good for third in ACC history and the first running back with 4,000 yards over his first three seasons.\n\nCook’s four touchdowns tied his career-high from last month against No. 3 Clemson and are tied for the most in FSU single-game history, while his 44 rushing touchdowns are tied with Greg Allen for the most in a Seminole career.\n\nCook was previously named the Offensive Back of the Week after the Miami game, when he ran for 150 yards and caught a 59-yard touchdown. Among ACC running backs, Cook has the league’s top three rushing performances this season.\n\nCook’s lead blocker for a lot of his career rushing yards has been his left tackle Johnson. Johnson was honored this week as the league’s top offensive lineman, the second time this season he has won the award. Johnson’s first career start came in 2014, when Cook exploded for 92 yards on just seven carries. Johnson has started every game since, and was named the league’s top blocker last season. He won the award for Offensive Lineman of the Week earlier this season when Cook had 267 rushing yards, second-most in school history, against USF on Sept. 24.\n\nA freshman defensive end, Burns was named the conference’s Rookie of the Week after exploding for 2.5 tackles for loss, 2.0 sacks, and five tackles against Syracuse. Burns also blocked a punt on Syracuse’s first drive, the first Seminole to block a punt since Chris Thompson in 2010. On the season, Burns has 8.0 sacks, the most in the country for freshmen and the most for any Seminole rookie since Ron Simmons had 12 in 1977.\n\nFlorida State also had three Player of the Week winners after the NC State game on Nov. 5 and four winners from the season opener against No. 11 Ole Miss on Sept. 5."
