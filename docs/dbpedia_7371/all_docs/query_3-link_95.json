        "text": "Before every game, Miami Central High School football coach Roland Smith convenes with his team captains to decide which color jerseys the players want to wear for their upcoming contest.\n\nThe week of Central’s state semifinal against Daytona Beach Mainland in Dec. 2013 was just different.\n\nAs the team was in the heart of pursuing its second consecutive state title and third in four years, the Rockets found out they would be without star running back Joseph Yearby, who broke his fibula in the previous game.\n\nLuckily for Central, they had another star in the backfield.\n\nAnd Dalvin Cook was determined to represent himself and Yearby in their final home game at Miami’s Traz Powell Stadium as high school seniors.\n\n“Dalvin told me, ‘Coach, this game, I want to wear Joe’s number. I want to run on the field for me and him,’” Smith recalled in a phone interview with the Tallahassee Democrat on Wednesday.\n\n“I told him ‘No problem.’ I said ‘It takes a big man to do what you’re about to do.’\n\n“When he decided he wanted to wear the jersey, it was a no-brainer for me to let him wear No. 3 so he can represent him and Joe. That’s the kind of closeness and connection they had with one another.”\n\nCook is FSU’s starting running back and Yearby fits the same billing for the University of Miami. As long as Cook's hamstring is healed in time the two are slated to face off on Saturday night in Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nTogether, they became one of the most prolific backfields in South Florida high school football history, combining for nearly 9,900 yards and 132 touchdowns during their careers, according to the Miami Herald.\n\n“I've seen guys in the backfield of their caliber. That one right there ranks as high as any,” FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said of the tandem. “I've seen some really good backfields, but those two right there are pretty dadgum good now.”\n\nAdded Miami coach Al Golden: “Obviously it was one of the better backfields anywhere at any time. They complement each other, and obviously they had a great team back at Central.”\n\nCook, a University of Florida commit at the time he wore Yearby’s jersey, took an official visit to Miami the weekend after that game. But playing together in college was simply not in the fold for both players.\n\nCook did not want to wait behind Miami’s Duke Johnson, and felt his best chances to play early and make an impact was at the school that just lost his close friend and fellow Central running back Devonta Freeman to the NFL Draft. Cook became the first player in FSU history to rush for more than 1,000 yards as a freshman.\n\nAs for Yearby, who first committed to Florida State, the reason he wanted to be a Seminole but ultimately chose UM was to play for offensive coordinator James Coley, who was on FSU’s staff three seasons ago.\n\nThe two running backs heard plenty of opinions when they shared the same backfield, but stayed together thanks to former Central coach Telly Lockette, who left his post for a coaching job at USF and is currently Oregon State’s running backs coach.\n\n“In all actuality, people didn’t want those kids to be as close as they were,” Lockette said, explaining how outsiders thought both players should play at separate schools to shine without the other.\n\n“Any of those kids could’ve selfishly went to another high school and get (more than) 30 carries per game and probably set some records. But they played alongside each other, and that was a good thing.”\n\nYearby finished his high school career with nearly 5,600 yards and 68 touchdowns, second in Miami-Dade County history, while Cook — who did not play as a freshman — accounted for nearly 4,300 yards and 64 touchdowns.\n\nLockette utilized both players at either running back or receiver, or in the wildcat formation with Yearby as quarterback. They also played as defensive backs, too.\n\n“You would have one in the game at one time that would just break a 60-yarder,” Lockette said. “Then you put the other one in and he has to top that with a 70-yard run.\n\n“It kept those guys motivated and on a different level.\"\n\nCook and Yearby lost only one game their senior season in 2013 - to eventual national champion Miami Booker T. Washington, led by University of Florida backup quarterback Treon Harris and Miami defensive end Chad Thomas. Florida A&M freshman defensive back Terry Jefferson sealed the win with an interception.\n\nBut the challenge of coaching against them was not enjoyable, said Pierre Senatus, Booker T.’s defensive line coach in from 2012 and 2013.\n\n“Those guys had us at times gasping for air on the sidelines with their abilities to be game-changers on every single play,” Senatus said.\n\nAnd Senatus was just talking about the coaches on Booker T.’s staff.\n\nA year before as juniors, Cook and Yearby led Central back from a 16-point halftime deficit to beat Booker T. at Sun Life Stadium. The victory kick started Central’s state title run in 2012. Booker T. went on a 41-game winning streak after that game.\n\nLockette said he told both players they were going to have put the team on their backs. And well, the rest has been history.\n\nWhether it was attacking sideline to sideline, or executing draw plays, dive plays or jet sweeps, it didn’t matter, Senatus said.\n\n“We know it’s coming, and they have the ability to stop on a dime, redirect themselves, and explode on a play that designed to run inside, with no protection outside, no blocking outside, no rhyme or reason to go outside,\" he said. “They made it a living nightmare.”\n\nWhether Cook, who leads the ACC with 570 yards rushing, is able to play close to full strength against the Hurricanes on Saturday remains to be seen.\n\nLast season in FSU’s 30-26 comeback victory in Miami, Cook raised his hands in the air signaling his hometown area code 305 after scoring the game-winning touchdown.\n\nYearby, fourth in the ACC with 424 yards rushing and four touchdowns, will be looking to make an impact in the rivalry after accounting for just 34 yards on 10 carries behind Duke Johnson in 2014.\n\n“What makes Miami go in their running game is Joseph Yearby, and what makes Florida State go everybody knows is Dalvin Cook,” Smith said. “I just hope that Dalvin is able to go because I want to see both of them play.”\n\nAs for Lockette, he recalled back to those talks he had with both players to stay at Miami Central.\n\nLockette told Cook and Yearby, “You have to respect each other. You guys can do great things together. And then someday, you guys will be playing against each other and have a big ‘ole laugh talking about, ‘Remember when we was in high school?’\n\n“And here it goes right now. They’re playing each other in a big-time rivalry game.”"
