        "text": "Florida's Mr. Football surprisingly flipped his commitment in UCF's favor Tuesday night.\n\nCocoa wide receiver Jayvan Boggs, a priority target for the Knights in the 2025 recruiting cycle, verbally committed to the Knights just over a month after choosing Missouri. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound wide receiver is a consensus four-star prospect, projecting to be one of the highest-ranked recruits ever to sign with UCF.\n\nBoggs caught 93 passes for 1,493 yards and 24 touchdowns during his junior season, leading Cocoa to its second straight state championship (Class 2S) and sixth overall in school history. He became Brevard County's first athlete named Mr. Football in a statewide media poll, garnering 107 points and five first-place votes.\n\n3 reasons for optimism: Why UCF football could contend for Big 12 title this season\n\nUCF last signed a Mr. Football winner directly out of high school in 1994: Vanguard quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who rewrote the program's record books in its Division I infancy and was eventually drafted in the first round by the Minnesota Vikings. Other award recipients include Georgia quarterback Carson Beck (Mandarin, 2018), Pro Bowl running backs Dalvin Cook (Miami Central, 2013) and Derrick Henry (Yulee, 2012), Florida Gators legend Tim Tebow (Nease, 2005) and three-time Pro Bowl receiver Anquan Boldin (Pahokee, 1998).\n\n\"They're getting a great kid, who is a really hard worker and all about the team. He's that rare receiver that is not a prima donna,\" said Cocoa coach Ryan Schneider, who threw for 10,976 yards and 82 touchdowns as a Golden Knight between 2000-03.\n\n\"Coach (Gus) Malzahn's done a great job recruiting locally. I'm happy that Jayvan has found a spot where he is truly comfortable, close to home and his mom and dad. I think he'll do some amazing things.\"\n\nAccording to the USA TODAY Florida Network's top 100 recruiting list for 2025, Boggs is the No. 23 overall player in Florida. Rivals ranks him as the No. 63 prospect in the nation, and both 247Sports and On3 Sports consider Boggs a top-300 national recruit.\n\nBoggs becomes the fourth receiver to commit to the Knights' 2025 class, joining Palm Beach Central's Waden Charles, St. Augustine's Carl Jenkins Jr. and Tampa Bay Tech's Santonyo Isaac.\n\n\"I think, for UCF, this solidifies them bringing in the most physically impressive receiving corps in school history if they all sign,\" Rivals national analyst John Garcia Jr. said. \"They're all big and physical. That's what is intriguing about the group. Jayvan is the most polished and college-ready, from physical and mental abilities in route concepts and winning contested catches.\n\n\"This group was already a storyline, and he's the headliner considering he's local and the highest-ranked. It's icing on the cake.\"\n\nAccording to 247Sports' composite scores, UCF moves into 22nd in the team recruiting rankings with 20 commits and six consensus blue-chippers. The Knights sit one spot behind TCU for the top score among Big 12 schools."
