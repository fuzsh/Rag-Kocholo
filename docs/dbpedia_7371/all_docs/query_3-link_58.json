        "text": "Vikings running back's younger brother is expected to be picked in the second or third round of the NFL draft. And he's hoping to keep his No. 4.\n\nBy Mark Craig\n\nApril 24, 2022 at 9:20PM\n\nGeorgia running back James Cook, younger brother of Dalvin Cook, is expected to be picked during the second day of the NFL draft. (Lynne Sladky, Associated Press/Star Tribune)\n\n\"[Deandre] wore No. 4 and was like a hero in my eyes when I seen him play football,\" Dalvin said. \"He switched sports, so I carried the legacy of No. 4 on, passed it to my little brother and on to my little cousins. It's like a tradition in my family.\"\n\nLike Miss Betty, Deandre can't seem to explain what it is about that number and why it means so much to the family.\n\n\"That's just the way it was,\" he said. \"Everyone knew growing up that the best player at Risco Park wore No. 4. I was 8 years old playing with Dalvin, who was 6, on the Carol City Chiefs in the Optimist League.\n\n\"I was the first No. 4 in our family. Played quarterback and linebacker. Except my first year when I was with the Bunche Park Cowboys. That year, Teddy Bridgewater was the quarterback and I was the receiver.\"\n\nTwo 'very special, special players'\n\nDeandre and Dalvin lived in the same house until Dalvin reached seventh grade and moved about 20 minutes away to his dad's house so he could attend Miami Central.\n\n\"My last year playing football, I was 16 and Dalvin was 14,\" Deandre said. \"I was back with the Bunche Park Cowboys. Dalvin played for the Scott Lake Vikings, which I guess was a sign.\"\n\nBy this time, Dalvin was wearing No. 4.\n\n\"We played each other that year,\" Deandre said. \"Dalvin ran a sweep near the goal line. I could hit pretty hard. I crushed him. He scored on the play, but he always said that might have been the toughest he ever been hit.\"\n\nThat hit has become legendary in family gatherings.\n\n\"I saw the hit,\" Miss Betty said. \"If Deandre kept playing football, he'd be in the NFL, too. He'd be somebody's quarterback.\"\n\n\"Nah,\" said Deandre. \"I'd be somebody's safety.\n\n(Carlos Gonzalez, Star Tribune/Star Tribune)\n\nMark Craig\n\nReporter\n\nMark Craig has covered the NFL nearly every year since Brett Favre was a rookie back in 1991.
