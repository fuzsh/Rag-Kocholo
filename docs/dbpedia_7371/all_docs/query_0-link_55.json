        "text": "The two plays were haunting to Florida State running back Dalvin Cook.\n\nTo a certain extent, they still are.\n\nTwo plays. Two plays that began with so much promise ultimately ended in disaster and turned what could've been a career day for Cook into one that he'd like to forget.\n\nThat is perhaps what hurts him the most.\n\nCook lost two fumbles - both after gains of 10 or more yards - in the third quarter of FSU's 59-20 loss in the 2015 Rose Bowl. Oregon quickly capitalized on both miscues to turn a close game into a rout, ending a historic 29-game win streak.\n\nSince then, Cook has gone back to watch film of the game on several occasions. Reviewing the tape for the first time was painful, but he pushed through and refused to hide from the gut-wrenching memories, just like how he didn't shy away from talking to media immediately after the catastrophic showing.\n\n\"It killed me to watch it,\" Cook said.\n\nThe Seminoles leaned heavily on Cook, then a true freshman, toward the end of last season, just like they will this year. He ran for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns, and had five 100-yard performances in his final nine games.\n\nHe had saved his best for last, or so it seemed. Cook had 94 rushing yards against Oregon at halftime and the Seminoles appeared to be poised to climb back from an 18-13 deficit as they began effortlessly moving the ball to downfield to open the third quarter.\n\n\"We ran the ball good on them all game,\" Cook said. \"Coming out of the half, that was the plan. We were going to run the ball and keep doing what we were doing.\"\n\nCook, using the quickness and vision that made him a force last year, weaved between Oregon defenders and powered ahead to get a few extra yards on a 10-yard carry early on in the third quarter. He ran into receiver Travis Rudolph's back and stumbled. With his right arm planted on the ground to maintain balance, Cook was unaware of linebacker Derrick Malone, who sneaked up behind Cook and ripped the ball out of his hand.\n\nHe lost the ball again on an 11-yard reception later in the quarter. With that, the wheels came off as FSU went on to lose four total fumbles in the second half.\n\n\"I felt like I was on the verge of having one of them [great] games,\" Cook said.\n\nFollowing the contest, Cook sat dejectedly in the back right corner of FSU's locker room. It would've made sense for the true freshman, who had won state titles the two previous seasons at Miami Central, to sulk. Instead, he quickly owned up to his mistakes.\n\n\"You've just got to take it all in right now,\" Cook said within an hour after the contest. \"And right now, my teammates got my back and that's all that matters. I made some mistakes out there. This summer I've got to go back to the drawing board and I've got to learn from it.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Cook has not dwelled on that night in January. FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said Cook has been explosive this spring, describing some of his runs as \"crazy good.\"\n\n\"Last season is last season, he's moved on,\" Fisher said.\n\nCook, who will be FSU's feature back in 2015, still watches film from that game \"over and over,\" like he does of every contest, but seems intent on learning from the low point of his younger career. \"I was still carrying like I was in high school,\" Cook said.\n\n\"I know me and I know myself. I know I can do better than that. I know I don't like to let my teammates down. That's just the competitor in me. I'm just a competitive guy. I just don't like when things go wrong. I'm a man about it.\""
