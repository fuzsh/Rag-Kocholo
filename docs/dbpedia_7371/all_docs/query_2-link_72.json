He wouldn't have started over those two.\n\nif I remember correctly he got in trouble for something with law enforcement but from what I remember it got swept under the rug at FSU...that would not have happened at Clemson.\n\nalso he is from Florida so he may have just wanted to stay at home and play close to family.\n\nHe was originally committed to us and then committed to either Miami or Florida before finally committing to FSU.\n\nHe don't think any college athlete lives with regret with their college decision. We don't know what factors come into play when they make their choice.\n\ncommitted to us, then decommitted and then committed to FSU. Give him another month and he would've probably changed his mind again. Dude had we had DW4 and Dalvin Cook how great would we have been? We might have won a national.... oh wait."
