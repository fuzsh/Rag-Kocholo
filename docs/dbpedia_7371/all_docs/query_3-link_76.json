        "text": "The NFL running back market has had its fair share of controversy over the years, and as the game of football is evolving, what used to be a pivotal position, has now been devalued in some franchises' eyes.\n\nFormer Florida State star running back entered free agency after spending his entire professional career (2017-2022) with the Minnesota Vikings. During that time, he amassed 7,794 all-purpose yards and 52 touchdowns.\n\nREAD MORE: Tennessee Titans Sign Former Florida State Running Back To Two-Year Deal\n\nAfter flirting with multiple teams during free agency, Cook is expected to sign a one-year, $8.6 million deal with the New York Jets, reported by NFL insider Adam Schefter. The move came after he was released into free agency in June of 2023.\n\nThe New York Jets have been making moves in the offseason, recently acquiring former Green Bay Packer Aaron Rodgers, who initially signed a two-year $110 million deal but was rumored to be restructured into a $75 million contract. Some speculate it provided cap space to pick up the four-time Pro Bowler.\n\nThe 28-year-old standout has rushed for over 1,000 yards in his last four seasons after dealing with injuries early on in his career. His skill set and production will go hand in hand with running back Breece Hall. The addition of Cook should provide some breathing room for Hall, who has also dealt with injuries early on in his career.\n\nCook will join former Seminole defensive end Jermaine Johnson II in New York as the Jets look to improve on their 7-10 record from a season ago.\n\nWATCH: No. 1 Overall Pick Bryce Young Laid Out By Jermaine Johnson During Preseason Debut\n\nStick with NoleGameday for more coverage of Florida State football throughout the 2023 offseason"
