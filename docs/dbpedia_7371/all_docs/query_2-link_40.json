        "text": "Florida State junior tailback Dalvin Cook was named to ESPN's All-American team on Monday.\n\nCook ran for 1,620 yards and 18 touchdowns, and he also added 426 receiving yards and a touchdown in 2016.\n\n\"From his field vision to his explosiveness to his willingness to take on defenders between the tackles, few running backs have been as dynamic or productive in ACC history. Cook saved his best for last, totaling more than 2,000 yards this season,\" ESPN's David Hale wrote of Cook.\n\nHe was one of a small group of ACC players on the list, including Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, Pitt guard Dorian Johnson.\n\nThe complete list can be viewed here\n\n(Get FSU news sent directly to your inbox!
