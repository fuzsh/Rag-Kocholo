        "text": "Former Florida State star running back Dalvin Cook has been the topic of discussion following the 2022 season and the 2023 NFL Draft has only heightened debates about the four-time Pro-Bowler's future in Minnesota.\n\nREAD MORE: Seattle Seahawks Sign Former Florida State Defensive End To One-Year Deal\n\nAfter coming off a labrum surgery and staring at a cap hit, where Cook will be suiting up in 2023 has been the subject of debate and Bookies.com oddsmaker Adam Thompson has laid out his thoughts as to where the 1000-plus yard rusher will end up this year.\n\nAccording to Thomson, Cook has a 40% implied probability (+150) to stay with the Vikings. The next highest percentage projects Cook to the New England Patriots at 16.7% (+500) and lists five other teams: Los Angeles Rams (13.3%, +650), Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals (11.8%, +750), Chicago Bears (9.1%, +1000), and Buffalo Bills (7.7%, +1200). If Cook were to end up in Buffalo, he would be playing alongside his brother, University of Georgia alumni James Cook who was drafted by the Bills in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\nCook is under contract for three more years. If the Vikings choose to trade or release him before June 1, they will incur a $6 million dead cap hit while saving $7.8 million in cap space. However, if Cook declines to restructure his contract and no team is interested in acquiring him under the current terms, the Vikings may find themselves in a bind.\n\nREAD MORE: Mike Norvell Provides An Update on Darrell Jackson's Waiver Process\n\nStick with NoleGameday for more coverage of Florida State football throughout the offseason"
