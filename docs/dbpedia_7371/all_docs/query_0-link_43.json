        "text": "ShareTweet\n\nAfter a slow start, Florida State’s workhorse got going late on Saturday night in an emphatic 27-2 victory over rival Florida.\n\nSophomore running back Dalvin Cook is the Florida State Football Player of the Week for Week 13 after accounting for 194 yards of offense and two touchdowns.\n\nCook was stuffed for most of the first half, but got things going in the final quarter. Cook’s 15-yard touchdown with 6:17 to play in the game cemented a third straight victory over Florida for the Seminoles. With 20 seconds to play, Cook put the exclamation point on the win by rushing for a 29-yard touchdown.\n\nOn the night, Cook carried the ball 26 times for 183 yards, but also caught three passes for 11 yards. In two career games against Florida, where Cook was once committed as a recruit, Cook has 366 yards from scrimmage.\n\nWith nearly 1,900 yards from scrimmage and 19 total touchdowns, Cook has enjoyed the greatest season ever for a FSU running back. Against N.C. State on November 14th, Cook eclipsed Warick Dunn’s single-season FSU rushing record and last week against Chattanooga, Cook surpassed Greg Allen’s single-season yards from scrimmage record. Cook and the Seminoles are back in the top 10 and will learn what bowl game they’re playing in come Sunday."
