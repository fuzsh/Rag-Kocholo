        "text": "The Minnesota Vikings made it official this afternoon, releasing Dalvin Cook. The move comes after four straight pro bowl seasons for the running back.\n\nThe team notified Cook yesterday, letting him know that they would be making the move today if a last minute trade deal could not be reached. By releasing Cook, the Vikings will free up $9 million in salary cap space in 2023, and additional $12.5 million in 2024.\n\nCook was drafted by the Vikings with the 41st overall selection in the 2017 draft out of Florida State University. Cook played in every game last season, but had a steady string of injuries in the seasons leading up to 2022.\n\nDalvin Cook is from Miami, and the Dolphins are said to have some interest in signing the 27 year old running back. Cook is free to sign with any NFL team after 3:00 pm central time today.\n\nCook rushed for 5,993 yards in six seasons with Minnesota. You can add 1,794 receiving yards of that same span -- finding the end zone a total of 52 times as a Viking.\n\nThe Vikings re-signed Cook's longtime backup, Alexander Mattison, to a contract that included $6.35 million in full guarantees over the next few seasons, fueling speculation that Cook was on his way out in Minnesota.\n\nThe expectation is that Mattison will take the lead role in the Vikings offensive backfield, with Kene Nwangwu, Ty Chandler, and rookie DeWayne McBride all competing for the number two spot.\n\nThe Vikings first preseason game is August 10th against the Seahawks in Seattle. The team opens the regular season on September 10th against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis."
