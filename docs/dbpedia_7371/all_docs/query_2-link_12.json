        "text": "The NFL started its release of the annual NFL Top 100 list last night, a list that is voted on by current players.\n\nA name familiar to Florida State fans cracked the Top 100, as former FSU and Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook was voted as the 91st best player in the league. It’s a pretty big fall for him, as he was ranked 31st the year before and is coming off of a season with 1173 rushing yards (4.4 yards per carry) and 8 TDs, while also adding two receiving TDs. It’s his fourth straight year on the NFL Top 100, peaking as high as 20th in 2021.\n\nCook is in the process of looking for a new team, as the Vikings cut him earlier this month over a contract dispute. Despite his numbers, Minnesota had one of the worst rushing attacks in the league, and Cook alone had 61 carries that went for no gain or negative yardage. For the money he was being paid, it didn’t make a lot of sense for the Vikings. As of now, the favorites to land him are a trio of AFC East teams in the Patriots, Jets, and Dolphins.\n\nREAD MORE: Florida State Adds Transfer From Ohio State To 2023-24 Roster\n\nSome other former Seminoles should see their name pop up on the Top 100 at some point, as Jalen Ramsey and Derwin James are considered two of the best at their respective positions, so we may not see them until later in the week. The NFL releases a new set of 10 players every day, counting down from 100. The full video of players talking about Dalvin Cook and his ability is streaming now on NFL+.\n\nDalvin Cook turned in arguably the greatest running back career in Florida State history, amassing 4464 rushing yards and 46 rushing TDs from 2014-2016. He was a three-time All-ACC selection, including two First-Team selections, and was a unanimous All-American in 2016. Following his time at FSU, he was selected in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, where he had spent his entire professional career up to this point.\n\nREAD MORE: Notable Weight Changes For FSU Football Ahead Of Fall Camp\n\nStick with NoleGameday for more coverage of Florida State football throughout the offseason"
