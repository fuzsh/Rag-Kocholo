        "text": "DALLAS – Florida State junior running back Dalvin Cook was announced as a candidate for the 2016 Doak Walker Award on Thursday by the PwC SMU Athletic Forum.\n\nThe award is presented annually to the nation’s top running back.\n\nCook was arguably the country’s top back a year ago. Despite battling injuries all season, the Miami, Fla., native shattered the Florida State school records for rushing yards (1,691) and all-purpose yards (1,935) in 2015. He finished with 19 rushing touchdowns and added a receiving score, and had an incredible 7.4 yards per carry average which led all Power 5 Conference rushers. Cook was tabbed the Jim Brown Award winner, given to the country’s top running back by the Touchdown Club of Columbus and garnered several All-America and All-ACC accolades.\n\nHe tallied six 150-yard rushing games in 2015, including a 266-yard performance against USF (Second-best in FSU history) and a 222-yard game versus Miami. Cook also rushed over the century mark against Texas State (156 yards), Louisville (163), Clemson (194), NC State (138), Chattanooga (106) and Florida (183) He rushed for a season-high 157 yards in the first half at No. 1 Clemson and tallied 150 of his 183 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against No. 12 Florida in The Swamp.\n\nCook enters 2016 with 2,699 career rushing yards, ranking fifth all-time in FSU history. He needs just 1,261 yards to become the leading rusher in Seminole history and his 107.96 career yards per game average is the best mark in ACC history.\n\nThe PwC SMU Athletic Forum Board of Directors will name ten semifinalists on November 16, and the Doak Walker Award National Selection Committee will cast votes to determine the three finalists, who will be announced on November 22. The committee will cast a second vote beginning November 28 to determine the recipient. The National Selection Committee consists of past recipients, former NFL All-Pro and college All-America running backs, media members and selected special representatives.\n\nThe recipient of the 2016 Doak Walker Award will be announced live on The Home Depot College Football Awards on Thursday, December 8, on ESPN. The Doak Walker Award Presentation Banquet will be held in Dallas in early 2017.\n\nThe award, which will name its 27th recipient in 2016, is named for SMU’s three-time All-America running back Doak Walker. It is the only major collegiate award that requires all candidates to be in good academic standing and on schedule to graduate within one year of other students of the same classification."
