        "text": "New Haven, CT – The Walter Camp Football Foundation has announced the Football Bowl Subdivision National Offensive and Defensive Players of the Week, presented by Generation UCAN, for games ending September 12.\n\nGenerationUCAN-WC POW 9-13-15\n\nAbout the Award: This is the 12th year that the Walter Camp Football Foundation will honor one offensive and one defensive player as its national Football Bowl Subdivision player of the week during the regular season. Recipients are selected by a panel of national media members and administered by the Foundation.\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nDALVIN COOK, FLORIDA STATE\n\nSophomore, Running Back, Miami, FL/Miami Central\n\nDalvin Cook rushed for a career-best 266 yards (on 30 carries) and three touchdowns as 11th-ranked Florida State defeated South Florida, 34-14. Cook’s 266 rushing yards were the second-most in FSU history, and he scored on touchdown runs of 74, 24 and 37 yards.\n\nNotes: Dalvin Cook is the fifth Florida State player to earn Walter Camp National Player of the Week honors since 2004, and the second offensive honoree joining former Seminole quarterback Jameis Winston (Oct. 6, 2013).\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nDeJUAN ROGERS, TOLEDO\n\nJunior, Safety, Detroit, MI/Cass Tech\n\nToledo junior safety DeJuan Rogers recorded a career-high 11 tackles, recorded one interception and broke up one pass as the Rockets upset 18th-ranked Arkansas, 16-12. It was Toledo’s first win over an SEC team in four tries and the first time the Rockets defeated a Top 25 non-conference opponent on the road.\n\nNotes: DeJuan Rogers is the first Toledo player to earn Walter Camp National Player of the Week honors, and the first honoree from the Mid-American Conference since Oct. 20, 2013 (Northern Illinois QB Jordan Lynch).\n\nGeneration UCAN (@GenUCAN) is healthy sports nutrition powered by a unique, slow-burning carbohydrate called SuperStarch.
