        "text": "The NFL Combine starts Tuesday, and there will be eight former Florida State players in attendance.\n\nThree former Seminoles, running back Dalvin Cook, fullback Freddie Stevenson, and left tackle Roderick Johnson, will arrive on Tuesday with the offensive line and running back units.\n\nCook and Johnson both left school early after their junior years, and both are projected to be high round picks.\n\nRunning Back Dalvin Cook\n\nCook will head to the combine as one of the top prospects regardless of position in the 2017 draft. He is expected to be selected in the first half of the first round, and could be the first running back taken.\n\nHe took over the starting job five games into his freshman season in 2014, and left FSU with nearly every major rushing record in program history.\n\nHe holds the single season rushing record (1,765), career rushing record (4,464), and career rushing touchdown record (46).\n\nCook was named a unanimous All-American following the 2016 season. He totaled 2,253 all-purpose yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nHe is the first running back in ACC history to run for more than 4,000 yards in just three seasons. He finished second behind North Carolina State’s Ted Brown as the ACC’s career rushing yards leader.\n\nScout’s take\n\n“Cook’s big-play ability makes him a special player. When given a hole, he can take it to the house, and even when his blocking isn’t good, he has the ability to maximize what is there. Cook’s fumbling problems, like his hamstring, flares up too frequently, so there are some concerns. Despite those issues, Cook’s name will still be called early because of his prodigious potential.” – Pro Football Focus analyst team."
