        "text": "Overview\n\nPosition: Running back\n\nHeight: 5’11”\n\nWeight: 213 pounds\n\nSchool: Florida State Seminoles\n\nCombine Performance Data\n\n40-yard dash: 4.49 seconds\n\nBench press: 22 reps (tied for fourth-best among running backs)\n\nVertical jump: 30.5 inches\n\nBroad jump: 9 feet, 8 inches\n\nThree-cone drill: 7.27 seconds\n\n20-yard shuttle: 4.53 seconds\n\nDalvin Cook 2017 NFL Draft Profile\n\nThere may not be a more complete back in this draft than Dalvin Cook. The three-year man from Florida State has established himself as one of the best running backs in Seminole history after his highly touted high school career. At Miami Central High School, he rushed for 4,267 yards and 64 touchdowns and attended the same school as former Seminole and current Atlanta Falcon Devonta Freeman. He was the top overall prospect in Florida and number two running back in the nation (behind Leonard Fournette) on 247Sports.com in the class of 2014. Among offers from Florida, Arkansas and Miami, he chose the Noles and followed Freeman.\n\nCook set the Seminole freshman rushing record in 2014 with 1,008 yards on 170 carries, including a 31 carry, 177-yard performance in the ACC Championship Game. His sophomore year was even better, running for 1,691 yards and a whopping 19 touchdowns on 229 carries. He also proved himself a solid pass catcher, hauling in 24 catches for 244 yards and a touchdown. Having already established himself as one of the best runners in college football, he was named All-ACC First Team by coaches and media.\n\nIt was this past year, though, that he played his best football. He rushed for 1,765 yards on 288 carries and scored another 19 touchdowns. He raised his receiving yardage to 488 yards and remained with one touchdown. He clearly established himself as the best tailback in the ACC and was named a Heisman Trophy finalist. Even though he did not win, he was still an All-American First Team member and led his Seminoles to an Orange Bowl upset win over Michigan 33-32, rushing for 145 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries and catching 62 yards to win the game’s MVP award.\n\nCook is built with a lethal NFL combination of speed, agility, elusiveness and power. He can bounce and turn a corner better than just about any running back in this class, but still has the strength to run through defenders up the gut. His pass catching ability and route running makes him even more valuable and ensures his three-down effectiveness.\n\nHe has had a history of injuries, with his shoulder and labrum causing problems in the past. He’s also dealt with fumbling issues in college, including some in crucial game situations. Off the field issues have also plagued him. He was accused of battery but found not guilty. His pass protection also needs work and must be shored up.\n\nStrengths\n\nPerfect combo of speed, size, agility and power;\n\nSuperb pass catching and route running;\n\nPlays great on the grandest of stages;\n\nBalance and burst out of backfield;\n\nAbility shed multiple tackles with strength and dodging ability.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPass blocking needs work;\n\nOff the field problems seem to find him;\n\nNagging injury problems;\n\nBounces outside too much, doesn’t always hit the hole;\n\nFumbling issues reoccurring.\n\nNFL Comparisons: Jamaal Charles\n\nTeams with Running Back Needs: Philadelphia Eagles, Jacksonville Jaguars, Detroit Lions, Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts, Oakland Raiders\n\nProjection: Mid to late first round\n\nBottom Line\n\nFournette will obviously be the first running back off the board, but other than him and Cook it is not a very strong running back draft. Cook has the potential to be a special, game changing back like Jamaal Charles has been in the last ten years. His running ability, field vision and intangibles make him a threat to immediately wreak havoc on defenses.\n\nThe pass blocking can be learned with work and effort and he can learn new running habits over time. It’s the off the field issues that worry everyone and make him a somewhat risky pick. Whoever takes him in the first round should have a plan in place to get him clean as a whistle or a backup plan in case it fails."
