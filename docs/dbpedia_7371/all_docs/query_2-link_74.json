        "text": "Los Angeles Chargers or Kansas City Chiefs may sign four-time Pro Bowler running back, Dalvin Cook this upcoming season. According to a report, one source believes the Cowboys could use some extra juice in the backfield and add Cook alongside after bringing back Ezekiel Elliott. This could make sense considering they haven’t been able to do anything special since losing Tony Pollard but the newest addition Royce Freeman went down with an injury. Rico Dowdle and Malik Davis are the only ones behind Elliott if they decide to move on from Freeman so you may consider the Dallas backfield on life support.\n\nCook hasn’t been garnering much interest even though he’s making it clear to teams that he’s ready and available. He could come at a bargain price since he doesn’t have an active market which could interest teams eventually who need some depth. There’s no possible way the veteran will return to Pro Bowl form as he was with the Minnesota Vikings but he could have some fresh legs since he’s looking to reestablish his value on a low-stakes contract. Last season, this was the only notable year where he was struggling and before in 2022, he was able to notch a solid 1,173 yards and eight touchdown campaign.\n\nHowever, he could fit better with the Chargers even though they have J.K. Dobbins, Gus Edwards and Joshua Kelley. He could compete for the No. 3 backfield and could emerge as a reliable rotational running back in case the injuries are haunting Dobbins and Edwards again. Cook wouldn’t shoot down the idea of joining a super team like the Chiefs especially since not retaining Jerick McKinnon. It’s still surprising that Kansas City didn’t retain him but is believing in Clyde Edwards-Helaire after the year that McKinnon put up.\n\nChargers, Chiefs May Sign Four-Time Pro Bowler Dalvin Cook\n\nOther Potential Destinations\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nDerrick Henry has a lot of responsibility this upcoming season even though injuries have been haunting his past. However, that shouldn’t worry him this season but if he goes down then they don’t have Keaton Mitchell ready who was put on the PUP list. This means they don’t have a big-time playmaker behind Henry to step up in case he needs a break. Henry isn’t god and the Ravens may understand that so they could consider bringing back Cook in the mix at a bargain.\n\nHe’s probably like an older Henry that’s already past his prime but it’s better than what’s behind him. Cook coming in even on a one-year deal before they address the position again in this year’s draft would help.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nThe running back position shouldn’t worry the Panthers too much but if they want depth then that would be a great recommendation. Chuba Hubbard, Miles Sanders and Jonathan Brooks are likely in that order the backfield will look this year. However, no one should expect Brooks to be ready this season since he’s still learning. Carolina has been actively improving their offense after even signing Rashaad Penny but he’s retiring.\n\nCook could come in to bring some competition in the backfield and work his way to the top of the depth chart against Brooks. It would be a nice lesson for a rookie but it might be needed in the long-term if they trade Sanders this season.\n\nNew Orleans Saints"
