        "text": "When Florida State received a transfer-commit in the form of a 5-star running back from Miami Central High School in 2013, they knew they were getting an effective rusher and a playmaker.\n\nEven with their highest expectations, they did not, could not, know how good he would turn out to be.\n\nThree years later, finding what Dalvin Cook hasn’t accomplished is nearly impossible. Every goal achieved, and every record broken, were done so with flare. This is what differentiates Cook from the pack. Not only did he shatter Warrick Dunn’s all-time school rushing record, but he did it in only three years – with fewer carries. Cook not only broke FSU’s single-season rushing record in 2014, but he did it while battling a nagging hamstring injury throughout the entire year.\n\nCook, however, knew his potential and set his goals early. In one of his first conversations about FSU with future teammate and roommate Travis Rudolph, Cook told him that he would be, “the best running back there.” Before “there” became Tallahassee, it was Gainesville – and Clemson even before that. Cook flipped from Florida to Florida State after the Gators went 4-8 in 2013, and the Seminoles were sure glad he did.\n\nOften times throughout these dazzling three years, the Seminoles offense lived and died by Cook.\n\nNow, they’ll have to figure out how to survive without him.\n\nCook announced Saturday via an Instagram live feed that he will forego his senior season at FSU and declare for the 2017 NFL Draft. Noles’ fans had a feeling this day would come, but it doesn’t make it any easier to cope with.\n\n“There’s no better feeling than putting on that garnet and gold. Being at Florida State has been the best three years of my life...it’s only up from here,” the now former ‘Nole said in his live video.\n\nDespite injury or setback, Cook always showed up big in key games. Fans remember the 80-yard flash he had against Miami in 2015 that created distance between the ‘Noles and their hated rivals. Others will look to the 70-yard touchdown run against Clemson on October 29th of this season – one that provided FSU an 8-point lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nNo matter the defense, Cook could burn them. Take your pick. From the 2014 ACC Championship game MVP performance as a freshman to Friday’s 145-yard Orange Bowl MVP outing, Cook embodied a primetime playmaker who was often the best player on the field in the game’s biggest moments – and even that doesn’t do him justice. Saying that “big time players make big time plays” just doesn’t cut it anymore for Number 4 - he’s turned electric, game-stopping, head-turning plays into a habit.\n\nThat is, until, one play topped them all.\n\n3rd down and 22 yards to go on the Florida State 13-yard line – a play that Cook and the Seminoles will never forget. Facing a stalling offense and the nation’s No. 1 scoring defense, while also clinging onto a 20-15 lead in the fourth quarter of the Orange Bowl, the ‘Noles were in desperate need of a spark.\n\n“It was a play coach Fisher called that we’d been calling all year, and I just felt like I could take advantage of that moment,” Cook said after the fact. “(Their) guys didn’t think I’d be able to break out at this point in time. I got an open field with a couple of guys and made them miss.”\n\nCook took a counter handoff from the shotgun, through the left side and ran down the Michigan sideline for a 71-yard explosion. 60 percent of the stadium erupted, and the other 40 - in blue and maize - feared that this was what many had warned them about for several weeks. The run pushed Cook into second place in the ACC all-time rushing.\n\nMichigan’s No. 12 run defense allowed under 117 yards rushing per game this season. Cook finished with 145 yards on 20 carries, an effort that earned him Orange Bowl MVP in his hometown – a dream envisioned in his mind long ago.\n\n“To be sitting here, and watching all of those games and being the younger guy…just a Miami kid…there’s nothing more that I want than this right here,” Cook said of his homecoming showout.\n\nDespite not receiving an invitation to a Heisman ceremony in New York throughout his collegiate career, the Miami native stamped his mark on the national spotlight with his performance against the Wolverines. His elusiveness and durability present a formidable offensive package for any NFL team, but there’s much more to the person than that. This was nothing new to the FSU faithful, however, and certainly no surprise to head coach Jimbo Fisher.\n\n“We all know what he does on the field, but what I’m going to miss is this right here,” Fisher referred to Cook following FSU’s 33-32 victory. “Watching him in practice, talking to young guys…in the weight room…in the summer when he’s working harder and harder…his work ethic…his demeanor.”\n\nWith the draft in mind, many college prospects have opted to sit out of their respective bowl games, like LSU's Leonard Fournette and Stanford's Cristian McCaffrey. So, did it ever enter Cook’s mind?\n\n“Not one bit… (when) that whistle blew, I was going to be out there,” Cook said.\n\nThe junior’s decision to play in the Capital One Orange Bowl may very well have lit the flame that cooked Harbaugh and the now 10-3 Wolverines. His 207 all-purpose yards left Michigan with no solution. For Cook, playing in this game did more than just help his draft stock. In front of a national audience and against a top-ranked defense, his performance solidified the notion that has often been neglected in the College Football landscape– the Miami native may be the best running back in college football.\n\nThe rest of the Orange Bowl is history, as is Cook’s career in garnet and gold. His draft stock is as high now as it probably ever will be. Moreover, there’s not much left for the 6-foot, 214 pound playmaker to accomplish at FSU.\n\nThe 4,478 rushing yards he’s amassed, each one hard-earned, will most likely not be surpassed anytime soon. The 46 touchdowns, also a Seminoles record, may never be eclipsed. After this season, and specifically this MVP Orange Bowl performance, many scouts are indeed calling him the best running back in the country. The FSU faithful will just continue to call him Dalvin.\n\nCompliments, and farewell, to the Cook."
