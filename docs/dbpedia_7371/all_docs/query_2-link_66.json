Hall practiced all week, including a full workout on Friday, so we're not too worried about the hamstring.\n\nView all Breece Hall Shark Bites »\n\nJets RB Breece Hall (hamstring) is listed as questionable for this weekend’s game vs. the Falcons. He practiced all week, including a full workout on Friday, so we’re fully expecting Hall to play. We’ll get the Jets’ inactives around 11:30 am ET on Sunday. RB Dalvin Cook (shoulder) is also questionable.\n\nView all Breece Hall Shark Bites »\n\nAn MRI confirmed that Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has a torn Achilles, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. That ends Rodgers' season after just four snaps. Turning 40 in December, Rodgers' football future is uncertain. He's signed with the Jets for two more seasons, although he carries a $51.5 million cap hit in 2025. The Rodgers injury puts Zach Wilson back under center for now. We'll see if the Jets -- with Super Bowl aspirations -- make a move at QB. For now, all Jets skill-position players are fantasy losers.\n\nView all Aaron Rodgers Shark Bites »\n\nJets HC Robert Saleh said after Monday night's win over the Bills that the team fears QB Aaron Rodgers has a torn Achilles. He's scheduled for an MRI on Monday to confirm. \"It's not good,\" Saleh added. A torn Achilles would end Rodgers' season -- and put the 39-year-old's football future in serious doubt. It'd also leave QB Zach Wilson as New York's starter. That'd obviously be a significant downgrade for all of the Jets' skill-position players.\n\nView all Aaron Rodgers Shark Bites »\n\nJets RB Breece Hall (knee) has been activated from the PUP list. He'll be a limited participant in Tuesday's practice, according to The Athletic's Zack Rosenblatt. Hall is now nearly 10 months removed from his torn ACL. He's been setback-free in his rehab by all accounts and is now seemingly on track to play in the season opener. Exactly how big a role Hall plays out of the gate -- especially after Monday's addition of RB Dalvin Cook -- remains uncertain.\n\nView all Breece Hall Shark Bites »"
