        "text": "The practice field at Miami Central sits behind the inner-city high school, a patch of grass often burnt in the South Florida heat by the time football season begins.\n\nDalvin Cook grew up hearing about what he’d do here. The way he tells it, kids in his neighborhood grow up in one of two households: Central or Miami Northwestern, the rival high school 2.5 miles south. His was a Central household.\n\nCook was the star of his Little League team his whole life. He was a running back faster than most and tougher than the few who could keep up with him. One day, coaches and family told him, he’d step onto that field and be the star running back for the Rockets.\n\nBut Cook showed up as the backup. There was a different star.\n\nHe watched at practice as Joseph Yearby took all the handoffs. They were both sophomores, but Yearby had been the backup to Devonta Freeman as a freshman and returned the season’s opening kickoff for a 98-yard touchdown. He was already given five stars in the recruiting rankings and, at the time, was ranked the No. 1 running back in the country.\n\nCook had chosen to play another year of youth football as a freshman. He didn’t want to ride the bench behind Freeman and Yearby. He thought it made more sense to get reps as a starter.\n\nBut now? Coaches wanted Cook to play corner or safety. They’d mix in some snaps at running back, they promised, and some at wide receiver, but give defense a shot, they encouraged.\n\nCook was surprised how much he took to defense. As a running back, he liked lowering his shoulder and knocking someone on their back. Now he could do that every play.\n\nAnd the ball still found his hands. He had a pick-six against Booker T. Washington. He returned a fumble 90 yards for a score against Miami Northwestern.\n\n“His offensive instincts kicked in and he just knew how the routes worked,” said A.J. Snipes, the offensive coordinator at Central. “So he just automatically knew where the ball was going. And Lord forbid if he got his hands on an interception and then you’ve got to tackle the dude. It’s like as soon as he intercepted the ball, everybody on the sideline was like, ‘Oh, that’s a touchdown.’ You’ve got a quarterback trying to tackle him one-on-one in the open field? That’s a no-go. We were already saying touchdown on the sideline as soon as he caught it.”\n\n“I kind of felt that, too,” Cook said. “Sometimes when I’d come to the sideline and didn’t score, they’d give me something for it.”\n\nCook played on both sides of the ball that year. He spelled Yearby at running back. He played wide receiver. And he shined on defense.\n\nHe dislocated his shoulder but wanted to prove to coaches he was tough, so he played through the injury. “And he still rushed for 100 yards a game,” said Telly Lockette, then the head coach at Central.\n\nBut Central lost in the state championship game. Afterward, Cook approached his coach. He was in disbelief they had lost. Cook told Lockette it wouldn’t happen again. He promised his coach they wouldn’t lose another playoff game together.\n\n“And we didn’t,” Lockette said.\n\nThe next season, Central coaches began each week the same way. They’d watch film of their upcoming opponent. If the opponent had a great offense, Cook would play cornerback. If they had a good defense, Cook would play on offense.\n\nFor the most part, the coaches conceded, practice didn’t really matter for Cook. He knew the plays on offense. And on defense, they’d just leave him on an island to cover the opponent’s top wide receiver one-on-one.\n\nThe Homestead High School Broncos spent Saturday mornings studying their upcoming opponent. Before they played Central, the team gathered to watch one of the Rockets’ recent games. They were impressed by a cornerback who had a pick-six. But then there was another No. 4 breaking long runs out of the backfield. And one who returned a punt for a touchdown. Was that the same kid?\n\n“It was the first year we were playing against Dalvin Cook, and this man scored six times in the game we were watching,” said Ermon Lane, Homestead’s top receiver. “Most people didn’t really know who he was. But trust me, everybody found out who Dalvin Cook was.”\n\nWhen Central watched Homestead’s film to prep for the game, Lane stood out. He was the best player on their team. So the game plan was obvious: Put Cook on Lane.\n\nCoaches told Cook this would be the rare game he’d just play defense: Save your energy, you’ve got a big task ahead of you.\n\n“He was the No. 1 receiver in the entire country,” Cook said. “And so I was thinking, ‘OK, if I can stick with him and cover him, I’m going to college as a cornerback.'”\n\nLane thought he had a chance for a touchdown when he was in the slot running a wheel route. The outside receiver would pick Cook, and Lane would be open in the end zone. But when Lane reached the end zone and turned to look for the ball, Cook was right next to him. Cook leaped and intercepted the pass. Lane tackled him to prevent another pick-six.\n\n“I still feel like he was a better defensive player,” Lane said. “We became roommates in college so we’d argue about that game all the time. He’d say, ‘I locked you down, I picked you off.’ And then I’d tell him, ‘I was the only person who tackled you in the open field.'”\n\nLane finished the game with one catch. After that game, Cook had a new appreciation for what he could do defensively.\n\n“So I went home and told my grandma and my brothers, I might go play corner,” Cook said. “This might be my position.”\n\nFlorida State wanted Cook as a running back. They had Tim Brewster leading their recruiting charge. But they also sent Mark Stoops, then their defensive coordinator, to watch a game.\n\n“He was at the game where they were playing Northwestern,” said Larry Blustein, a recruiting expert in Florida. “Northwestern is driving in to go for a touchdown and Dalvin hit the kid running the ball, jarred the ball loose, picked it up and went 98 yards to score — turned the whole game around.\n\n“That’s when Stoops turned to me and said, ‘The hell with running back, I’ll take his ass at safety.'”\n\nIn truth, his coaches said, Cook could’ve played anywhere. They put him at wide receiver at the start of games. They sometimes put him at quarterback in the wildcat formation. He played cornerback against teams that threw the ball and as a run-stopping strong safety against teams that ran it.\n\n“You give me 22 Dalvins and we’re going to win,” Lockette said. “He doesn’t mind doing the dirty work.”\n\nCould he have played Division I cornerback? Safety? Wide receiver?\n\n“Dalvin could’ve played any position he wanted and been successful,” Lockette said. “He’s just a football player.”\n\nOpposing coaches joked with Lockette that it was unfair. He seemed to get two star players in one — Cook was perhaps the state’s best corner and the state’s best running back.\n\n“Coaches would come up to me after and be like, ‘This kid is Superman,'” Lockette said. “He played offense, he played defense, he played special teams. Hell, sometimes he never left the field.”\n\nSnipes, the offensive coordinator, had a phrase reserved for days when Cook was scheduled to primarily play defense. If the offense was struggling into the second half and needed a boost, he’d stop Cook as he was walking off the field after a defensive series and utter six words.\n\nBreak glass in case of emergency.\n\nThat meant, game plan be damned, we need you on offense, too.\n\n“He’d come over just yelling, ‘Break glass! Break glass!’” Cook said with a laugh.\n\nThose were the games Cook never left the field.\n\n“I’d say, ‘Dalvin, we’ve got to break the glass right now,'” Snipes said. “He’d say, ‘Coach, let’s go.’ Next thing you knew, he got five carries and we’d be in the end zone. He’d come back and be like, ‘Coach, we good?’ I’d say, ‘No, I need one more.’ He’d say, ‘OK Coach, I got you.'”\n\nYearby, the running back Cook once thought might keep him from playing the position he loved, became good friends with Cook. By their junior year, coaches stopped deciding who would play.\n\n“Everybody thought that was weird,” Snipes said. “But I was like, they can handle their own selves. They had this thing where if Joe was running the ball and getting positive yards, Dalvin would be like, ‘OK Coach, let Yearby keep doing his thing.’ And if Yearby got tired and tapped out, I’d say, ‘All right Dalvin, let’s go.'”\n\nWhen Cook was in the game on offense, Snipes didn’t want to waste the few plays he had with him. So while the offense was predicated on the quarterback calling his own plays at the line of scrimmage, there was a strict mandate when Cook was in the game: Give him the ball.\n\n“I’d look at the quarterback and be like, we’ve got 900 plays we can run, but just make sure you pick one of the ones where Dalvin gets the ball,” Snipes said.\n\nAt first, the quarterbacks were confused. What if we have to audible? What if the defense lines up in a way that’ll stop our play?\n\n“If you audible, you better audible to another Dalvin Cook play,” Snipes said.\n\nCook and Yearby were the talk of Florida high school football by their junior year. It’s not uncommon for Florida to produce five-star players. But to have two of them at the same position in the same grade at the same school?\n\nA semifinal game against Naples became appointment viewing for local fans. Scouts flocked to see them together. “That was the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen in high school,” Cook said. “It was crazy.”\n\nDuring warm-ups, No. 4 for Naples ran over to Cook and started talking smack about which of the two was better. “We’re gonna see who the real No. 4 is,” the player told Cook.\n\n“I’m looking at him like, ‘Ohhhhhh, you poked the bear. I wouldn’t have done that if I was you,'” Snipes said. “Dalvin doesn’t say anything back, he just starts clapping and swaying.”\n\nCook was usually the calm one on the team. He liked to let his play do the talking. He didn’t celebrate too much after big plays. He wanted to act like he’d been there.\n\nBut at halftime, with Central down seven, Cook gave an impassioned speech. He told his teammates they weren’t going home.\n\n“In the second half alone,” Snipes said, “he rushed for 226 yards.”\n\nCook was relatively calm after his first touchdown that game, Snipes said. Same with the second. And third. And fourth. After he ran a simple inside zone 80 yards for his fifth score of the game, sealing a trip back to the state championship, Cook punted the ball into the stands, turned to the Naples sideline, and yelled, “I’m the real No. 4.”\n\nRefs threw a flag: 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct. Cook never got penalties like that. So when ran back to the sideline, he thought he was in store for an earful from his coaches.\n\n“But I was just like, ‘OK, I’ll take that. If you always give me 35 points, I’ll take the 15-yard penalty,'” Snipes said.\n\nCook laughed at the recollection. It’s all true, he said, but it ignores what he was most proud of that game.\n\n“I had 22 tackles,” he said. “I’m in the box and stuffing the run against their Wing T stuff.”\n\nPlayers didn’t really talk trash to Cook after that.\n\n“Once you do it and you piss him off, it doesn’t normally work in your favor,” Snipes said. “He’s not a guy that’s going to come out of the tunnel and talk trash. He’ll talk trash when you say something to him. And once that Naples No. 4 left, I was like, ‘Boy, that wasn’t such a good idea.’ You should’ve just left him alone. He was in a calm, chill mode. Don’t go pouring gas on the fire.”\n\nCentral won the state championship the following week, but it’s the playoff run of his senior year that lives in Florida prep sports lore. Yearby suffered a broken ankle and missed the playoffs, so Cook became the full-time starter at running back and cornerback.\n\n“He carried the entire team to the state championship,” Bluestein said. “He was a one-man show. Teams would gear up to stop him, but he did it basically all by himself.”\n\nThe run to the title was anticlimactic. The Rockets won their five playoff games by an average of 35 points. They won the state championship game 52-7. Honoring his friend and teammate by wearing Yearby’s No. 23 instead of his traditional No. 4, Cook ran for 223 yards and four touchdowns on 19 carries.\n\n“After every touchdown,” Cook told the Orlando Sentinel after the game, “I went right to Joe.”\n\nThe real drama at the end of that season was about where Cook would go to college. He was rated the No. 13 high school prospect in the country and the No. 1 player in the state. He’d already committed and de-committed from Clemson and Florida. Florida State had been recruiting him hard for a couple years. Miami, his dream school, had suddenly re-entered the fold.\n\nCook didn’t want to draw too much attention to himself with an over-the-top announcement, so he figured he’d do it in a subtler way. He had a pair of silver and gold cleats still in the box.\n\n“He put those gold cleats on for the championship, and everyone knew right away he was going to Florida State,” Snipes said.\n\nCook enrolled at FSU early. He wanted to make a good impression on the coaches. And he knew they had an open job at running back after Freeman departed for the NFL.\n\nFreshmen worked out together during those early spring days. They were supposed to lift weights in the downstairs gym then head upstairs for meetings. Cook spent a little too much time lifting weights one day and feared he was going to be late for the meetings, so he sprinted up the stairs.\n\nSomehow, he tripped. He landed on his shoulder. Right away, he knew it was bad. He didn’t know what to do. He hadn’t been in a real practice yet. Now he had to tell coaches he tripped on the stairs and hurt himself? Would they believe him?\n\nThe team’s trainers confirmed he needed surgery. He had a torn labrum. Now you’ve got to go tell head coach Jimbo Fisher what happened, they told him.\n\nFisher was in disbelief. He’d watched Cook evade tacklers for three years. Now he can’t go up the stairs? Now he has to miss all of spring practice?\n\n“It was just a freak accident,” Cook said.\n\n“But I’ll tell you what’s amazing about him,” Fisher said. “If the doctors said four months, three weeks, whatever they’d say after an injury, Dalvin was always healthy early. His body just came around. Now his work ethic was great and all. But his body just healed. It was amazing. Whatever it was, he’d come back early, full speed. Always. His body heals. I don’t know what it is.”\n\nThe first day of joint workouts was a big one for players at Florida State. It was the first time the upperclassmen got a look at their new teammates, and it’s often a measuring stick for the players themselves. Want to make an impact as a true freshman? Beat the upperclassman you’ll be competing with in a race.\n\nLane, the receiver Cook once covered in a high school game, was now a teammate and had gone around the team telling them no one could keep up with Cook. The upperclassmen bet on Karlos Williams, a senior who had switched from safety to running back the year prior.\n\nWilliams knew of Cook. He wanted the starting running back job as a senior, so he’d done his homework by watching Cook’s high school highlights to scout his competition. He didn’t admit it to teammates, but he didn’t think he could beat Cook in a 40-yard dash. But Williams is 6-foot-2 and Cook is 5-foot-11. Maybe, Williams thought, my longer strides will allow me to win a 60-yard race.\n\n“But, no,” Williams said. “He held on just long enough.”\n\nIn truth, Cook admits now, the race was more than a fun sprint for bragging rights. It proved he belonged.\n\n“It built a lot of confidence,” Cook said. “It really did. Just beating a guy that was so productive who nobody could catch on the field, that triggered in my mindset, ‘Well, nobody is going to catch me. If they can’t catch Karlos, they’re not catching me.'”\n\nCook eventually became the starting running back as a true freshman, taking the job from Williams, a senior. If anyone deserved to hold a grudge against Cook, it was Williams.\n\n“Nope,” Williams said. “I’m probably the biggest Dalvin Cook fan you’ll find. For real. It was humbling, but it was also great.”\n\nWilliams hadn’t played the position long, so Cook taught him how to read rushing lanes. He broke down film with him. It didn’t matter to Cook that they were competitors for playing time.\n\n“He wanted to make all of us better,” Williams said. “And he was so humble about it.”\n\nSo he’s not mad Cook took his job?\n\n“My wife is sitting next to me and she’s laughing,” Williams said. “She knows I’m the biggest Dalvin Cook fan on Earth. I love that guy.”\n\nCook’s breakout game came seven weeks into the season. Florida State, the defending national champion, trailed 21-0 at Louisville. The Seminoles’ 29-game winning streak was in jeopardy.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, Florida State trailed 35-31. They called a handoff for Cook. Louisville’s safety ran unblocked, toward Cook. From the sideline, Fisher thought the safety would blow up the play.\n\n“But Dalvin gave him a dip and hit an angle, and it was over,” Fisher said. “He just ran away from him. That’s when you went, ‘Wow, this is a freshman.'”\n\nThe run was the go-ahead, game-winning score. Cook finished with 150 yards of offense and two touchdowns on 14 touches.\n\nCook quickly developed a nickname from his teammates — Magic.\n\n“That’s what we called him,” Williams said. “Magic. He did so many things for us and helped us win so many games at Florida State. He put the whole team on his back.”\n\nThe Seminoles played South Florida in their second game of the 2015 season, their first real test. At halftime, the game was tied 7-7.\n\nThe team was young, and it showed. The plays weren’t being run as designed. It was a rainy day, and the passing game wasn’t working right. Fisher was growing irate.\n\nDuring the third quarter, he walked over to offensive coordinator Randy Sanders on the sideline. Forget the game plan, the head coach said. It’s time to just give the ball to Cook.\n\n“I vividly remember coach Fisher and I saying, ‘All right, he’s our best player, how do we just give him a chance to win us the game?'” Sanders said. “It’s not about plays at this point, it’s about players.”\n\n“I said (to Sanders), ‘You know what, find every way for him to touch it and good things are going to happen,'” Fisher said. “It was: We’ll fix these problems when we get out of here, let’s quit trying to do it right now. Let’s just put it in Dalvin’s hands, and try to get it over with.”\n\nCook finished the game with 266 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Florida State won 34-14.\n\nSanders looked forward to games against Miami. They recruited heavily from the city, and games against the Hurricanes revealed a lot. Some of the Miami kids on the roster got too excited for the game. Others embraced the spotlight of playing back at home.\n\n“For those guys who we had from the Miami area, it was interesting,” Sanders said. “Either their game stepped way up or it stepped way down because they’d get so fired up, overly fired up, to where their performance would actually diminish because they wanted to play well so badly.”\n\nThe coaches didn’t know how Cook would respond. Miami had been his dream school. Would he press too much? Miss the holes? Try to take on a defense by himself?\n\n“The atmosphere at those games would blow your mind. It’s crazy,” Cook said. “But me, I’m just kind of taking it in, looking around, picturing in my mind what I’m going to do, going through the game plan in my head. I’m not embracing the fans before the game, not working myself up like some of the other guys. I’d look over at some guys and they’d be dripping sweat in warmups.”\n\nCook only got seven carries against Miami as a freshman. He turned them into 92 yards and two touchdowns. The following year, he put up 269 yards and scored twice. As a junior, he had 219 yards and a touchdown.\n\n“All I can say is U-M is going to remember Dalvin for a long time,” Lane said. “That’s how you can sum it up. U-M fans and U-M coaches and former players, they’ve got the utmost respect for Dalvin because he tortured them every year.”\n\n“With me, it’s all about bragging rights,” Cook said. “And I wasn’t going back to Miami and hearing people say they beat me.”\n\n“Here’s the best story about him,” Fisher said.\n\nIt was the fall of 2016, Cook’s final year at Florida State. He had Heisman Trophy aspirations. The Seminoles opened up the season ranked No. 4 in the country, and Fisher didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize his star player. He kept Cook out of scrimmages leading up to the season.\n\n“We babied him too much in camp,” Fisher said.\n\nCook started slow. He had 191 yards in the opener against Ole Miss — “Which would be an outstanding game for most,” Fisher said — but Cook could’ve had more. He had 83 rushing yards the next week and only 54 in a loss to Louisville.\n\nFisher could tell something was off, so he called Cook into his office. “And I’ll remember this conversation forever,” Fisher said.\n\nHe asked Cook what he could do to get him back on track. More rest? Different play calls? What is it?\n\nCook sat in a leather chair in the coach’s office and thought about the question. Cook didn’t say anything for a long time. “Silence,” Fisher said. “I mean, he really thought about it.”\n\nThen Cook gave his answer: “Coach me like I’m a freshman.”\n\n“What he meant was every step, every snap, everything I do, I want you kicking my butt,” Fisher said. “I want you on my tail. If I need to be yelled at, you yell at me.\n\n“So we went back to old school. And I was ripping him like crazy.”\n\nCook averaged 191 yards per game the rest of the season.\n\n“But there were some days I kind of wanted to take that comment back,” Cook said with a laugh. “He was on me. Like, I mean, on me. But I respond better to that.”\n\n“This, to me, tells you everything about Dalvin,” Fisher said.\n\nNo one outworked Cook. Fisher saw it at Miami Central High School. He saw it at Florida State. He saw it at practices and on game days.\n\n“He just loves competing,” Fisher said. “There ain’t nothing in that guy’s soul that’s going to make him back down. He ain’t wired that way. The competitive nature in him is unbelievable.”\n\nThat’s why he’s not surprised Cook has developed into perhaps the best running back on the planet.\n\n“He’s a complete team guy in every sense,” Fisher said. “He’s one of my favorite guys ever. Not because he’s good, but because of every other intangible he has.”\n\n(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic; Photos: Hannah Foslien, Mike Ehrmann, Brett Carlsen / Getty Images)"
