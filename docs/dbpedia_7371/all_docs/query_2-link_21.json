This earned him All-American honors from both MaxPreps and USA Today.\n\nTaking the College Football World by Storm at Florida State\n\nCook brought his electrifying running style to Florida State University and wasted no time putting his stamp on the college game. As a true freshman, he rushed for over 1,000 yards and set the FSU record for rushing yards by a freshman (1,008).

He finished his FSU career looking like a future NFL star.\n\nTaking the NFL by Storm as a Rookie in Minnesota\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Cook in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL Draft. The team saw the same superstar potential that Cook displayed in college. Despite battling injuries early on, he exploded onto the NFL scene as a rookie. In just 4 games, Cook racked up 354 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns, breaking numerous Vikings franchise records for rookie running backs. This early NFL success offered a glimpse of what was to come.\n\nEvolving into an NFL Superstar in Minnesota\n\nSince that standout rookie debut, Cook has evolved into one of the NFL‘s most dynamic rushers. He became the:\n\nFirst NFL player with 200+ scrimmage yards in consecutive games (2018)\n\nYoungest player in NFL history with 3+ rushing TDs in a game (21 years old)\n\nFirst Vikings player to record 1,000+ rushing yards in each of first 3 seasons\n\nIn 2020, Cook had a career year. He led the entire NFL in rushing yards on the way to earning First Team All-Pro honors. As the centerpiece of the Vikings offense, Cook continues to make his case as the most electrifying rusher in pro football.\n\nDalvin Cook‘s Playing Style and Strengths\n\nWhen you watch Dalvin Cook play, a few key traits immediately stand out that make him so dangerous with the ball in his hands:\n\nLightning Quick Acceleration – Cook reaches top speed immediately to blow past defenders before they even get a hand on him.\n\nElusive Open Field Running – He can make defenders miss with lightning-quick cuts and jukes, especially in space.\n\nStrong Lower Body – A low center of gravity and powerful legs allow Cook to break tackles and drag defenders.\n\nSoft Hands – He‘s a true receiving threat with the smooth route running and hands to rack up yards after the catch.\n\nAccording to Vikings offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, \"Dalvin can make any run unique and special with his explosiveness and agility.\" It‘s this playing style that makes Cook such a joy to watch and so productive year after year.\n\nThe Outlook for this Budding NFL Superstar\n\nAt only 28 years old, Dalvin Cook appears poised to become one of the best running backs of his generation. His rare blend of athleticism and skills have Vikings fans dreaming of a Hall of Fame career. If he can maintain his elite production while avoiding major injuries, Cook should continue anchoring Minnesota‘s offense and racking up Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors for years to come. Strap in and get ready to watch this budding superstar leave his mark on the NFL record books."
