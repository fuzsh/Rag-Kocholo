        "text": "With their first selection in the 2017 NFL Draft, the Minnesota Vikings chose to make a splash, moving up seven spots to #41 overall to select the heir to Adrian Peterson.\n\nThe #1 running back in the draft according to the folks from Pro Football Focus, Cook was widely thought to have been a first round caliber running back, but managed to fall down to the second round.\n\nCook is a true three-down running back, as he is not only an outstanding runner, but can catch the ball out of the backfield and is a very able pass blocker.\n\nCook has fallen largely because of off-field issues, as he had an incident in 2015 where he was charged with battery for an incident outside of a bar. He was suspended by the Seminoles, but was found not guilty of the charges and reinstated by Florida State. In addition, NFL Network is reporting that he has told teams that his group of friends, which was apparently a concern for some teams, would not be coming with him to Minnesota.\n\nGotta be honest, folks. . .when I did my look at the running back position, I didn’t think there was any chance that Dalvin Cook would be available for the Vikings. But, he is, and he’s a hell of a selection, in this writer’s opinion.\n\nThe Vikings are next on the board at pick #79 in the third round."
