        "text": "Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook has made a name for himself as one of the best backfield threats in the NFL. Now he can say that he is a college graduate after completing his degree at Florida State.\n\nHe wasn’t able to physically walk the stage, but Cook still celebrated the accomplishment\n\nCook, now 25 years old, graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in interdisciplinary studies and public policy, per Jeremy Willis of ESPN. Cook tweeted a picture of him at his Minnesota home in his cap and gown, as he could not make the in-person ceremony due to training camp obligations.\n\n“College graduate,” wrote Cook. “Forever grateful for FSU & the entire football athletic program for supporting me as I accomplished this goal!!”\n\nBefore becoming a second-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, Cook had tremendous success on the field with Florida State. He ran for 4,464 yards, 46 touchdowns, and added 935 yards receiving in three years with the Seminoles. Cook earned first-team All-American and All-ACC honors twice in his collegiate career. He was also part of the Seminoles team that made a run to the 2014 College Football Playoff.\n\nIn his two full seasons as the lead back for the Vikings, Cook has run for over 2,600 yards and 29 touchdowns. He has also added over 800 yards receiving. He is fourth in the NFL in rushing yards since 2018. Cook is currently the fourth-highest paid running back in the NFL, earning $12.6 million per season with just over $28 million guaranteed.\n\nThe Vikings have made the playoffs in two of Cook’s first four years with the team. They are, however, coming off of a 7-9 campaign that saw them finish in third place in the NFC North. The Vikings are looking to return to the postseason again in 2021.\n\nCook and now second-year wide receiver Justin Jefferson are two key, core players for Minnesota. Cook has established himself as an explosive threat as one of the top rushers in all of football. Jefferson and Cook are two exciting and skilled building blocks on offense for the Vikings.\n\nNow, the Vikings look to build around their two young stars in Jefferson and Cook. Minnesota’s success over the coming years will likely hinge on Cook’s ability to remain as one of the most explosive offensive threats in the NFL.\n\nEarning a college degree is a tremendous accomplishment. Cook left Florida State early to pursue his career in the NFL. He still went back to finish his degree, even if it came seven years after he initially arrived on campus in Tallahassee.\n\nImage courtesy of: Jonathan Backman via Getty Images."
