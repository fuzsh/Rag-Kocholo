He finished the year with 730 rushing yards and 11 rushing touchdowns on 91 carries. In 2014, Williams began his senior season as the starter, but eventually played behind Dalvin Cook.[9] He finished the year with 689 yards on 150 carries with 11 touchdowns.\n\nAfter college, Jones was selected in the 5th Round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Williams went on to play in the NFL for two seasons with the Bills & Steelers, before playing in the CFL for the Toronto Argonauts."
