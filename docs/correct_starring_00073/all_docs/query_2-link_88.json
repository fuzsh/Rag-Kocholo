        "text": "By 1993, it appeared that all of Dean Cain’s dreams had come true. On the surface, his starring role in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman had brought him instant fame and career opportunities. However, the long hours he spent filming the series began to wear on him. “I couldn’t see the end,” Dean, 57, confides to Closer. “It was hours on set, almost every day of the week, for years.” In the 30 years since portraying the Man of Steel in the ABC series, Dean has moved to Las Vegas and found a better work-life balance by pursuing projects that fulfill him on both a personal and spiritual level. “I’ve grown to love acting so much because you can write stories that affect people, change their perceptions or teach them something,” he says. “It’s a blessing, and it’s a wonderful way to make a living.”\n\nDid you always want to be an actor?\n\nI didn’t want to be an actor. I thought it was kind of silly, and I didn’t want to be in that world. I just didn’t know if I could act and thought it was a weird business. And you never know if you’re going to be liked or not liked or whatever.\n\nThat’s so ironic because your dad, Christopher Cain, is in the business.\n\nYes, my dad’s a film director. He directed movies like [1988’s ] Young Guns. However, he said three words to me when I said I wanted to be an actor: \"Don't do it.\""
