I couldn't make that name up!\"\n\nDean Cain, on the other hand, grew up with a different background.\n\nDean was born Dean Tanaka on July 31, 1966 in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. He later took the last name of his adopted father, film director Christopher Cain.\n\nThough he is certainly best known as an actor, Dean's career started out on a different path. He played football while majoring in history at Princeton, and set the NCAA record for most interceptions in a single season. After graduating in 1988, Dean was signed as a free safety with the Buffalo Bills. However, a knee injury ended Dean's football career before it even began.\n\nDean then turned his attention to acting. At that point, his only acting experience was a role in his father's film, \"The Stone Boy,\" in 1984. Dean went on to land a few small roles on television, most notably as Shannen Doherty's boyfriend on \"Beverly Hills 90210.\"\n\nThe role that put Dean on the map, of course, was as Clark Kent and his superheroic alter-ego on \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\" But Dean didn't get the part right away. The producers initially thought Dean was too young, and he had to audition more than once to land the role. While playing Supes, Dean got to stretch his creative wings as a writer as well, penning fan-favorite episodes \"Season's Greedings\" and \"Virtually Destroyed.\"\n\nIn 1997, Dean broke the hearts of women everywhere when he announced his engagement to country singer Mindy McCready. Though they broke off their engagement a year later, Dean got the chance to follow in his adopted father's footsteps when he directed Mindy's music videos \"YouÂ’ll Never Know\" and \"The Other Side Of This Kiss.\"\n\nAfter Lois & Clark, Dean appeared in the movies \"Best Men\" and \"The Broken Hearts Club,\" as well as TV movies like \"Futuresport,\" \"Gentle Ben,\" and \"Christmas Rush.\" You can currently see him on TV as the host of \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not.\"\n\nDean also recently took on another new role... that of a father. In June of 2000, Christopher Dean Cain was born to Dean and his then-girlfriend, model Samantha Torres.\n\nDean is often seen in public accompanied by his son. He still acts, racking up guest shots in TV series such as \"Las Vegas.\" It is rumored that he may make an appearance on the WB's superhero show \"Smallville\" at some point in the future."
