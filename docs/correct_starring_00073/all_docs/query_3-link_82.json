One of them is Dean Cain, who is best known for his role as Superman in the 1993 TV series,Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Cain’s story as a single father who gave up his career to take care of his son is one that proves superheroes really do exist.\n\nCain’s journey as a single dad is one that we at Bright Side believe to be a great example to set for all parents, and we want to share his story with you.\n\n1. He experienced a rough childhood.\n\nMary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News\n\nAlthough he would eventually become a world-renowned star, Dean Cain experienced a tough childhood. Born to actors Sharon Tanaka and Roger Tanaka in 1966, the boy and his mother were unfortunately abandoned by his father, and the future actor never got to meet his biological father. But when he was 4, his mother married Christopher Cain. His biological father never got in contact with Cain again.\n\nEast News\n\nThis fractured relationship with his father shaped the actor immensely. In June 2000, he became a father to a son with his girlfriend, Samantha Torres. Despite a long, drawn-out custody battle with Torres, Cain did not give up and finally got sole custody in 2011. After experiencing hardships in his childhood due to his father, the actor made sure his son would not go through the same experience.\n\n2. He raised his son alone and made many sacrifices.\n\nKraig Geiger/Everett Collection/East News, Kraig Geiger/Everett Collection/East News\n\nThe Superman actor made sure to be there for his son every step of the way, even cooking every meal for him.\n\nHe shared, “I cook every meal for my child. If I don’t cook, he doesn’t eat. I cook a very mean steak. I’m also very good at taking the 9 leftovers I have and turning them into something.”\n\nWARNER BROS TV / Album/East News\n\nAlthough he continued to act and raise his son alone at the same time, the actor made sure to be there every step of the way. “The last 18 years of my career have been predicated upon being a father first, and an actor second,” Cain shared. He made sure to be present for all his son’s Jujitsu events and was even his football, basketball, and baseball coach.\n\n3. He doesn’t regret his decision.\n\nThe actor’s decision to put his career on hold and focus on raising his son has earned him a lot of criticism, but Cain said, “I’m there. I’m a very present father, and I would never do it otherwise.” Even though he is raising his son alone, he doesn’t regret it. “People are, like, ‘Haven’t you been aspiring for anything?’ Yeah, I’ve aspired for a life!”\n\n4. The 2 share an unbreakable bond.\n\nDean Cain’s upbringing of his son has resulted in them sharing an unbreakable bond. The actor has shared adorable pictures of the 2 of them together on Instagram and has stated, “I think he’s pretty proud of Dad, but to be honest, I’m pretty proud of him. I think he’s my favorite human being on the planet.”\n\n5. He is a real-life Superman.\n\nABC/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News, Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News\n\nCain’s sacrifices for his son are a great example of love parents have for their children. Despite being given an iconic role and a successful career, the actor put his son first before anything. By making sure his son would never go through a rough childhood like he did, Cain became Superman in real life.\n\n6. He continues to work on his career as well.\n\nGilbert Flores/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News\n\nCain continued with his career while raising his son, writing for shows like Ripley’s Believe It or Not and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. He also went on to appear in movies like The Broken Hearts Club and Out of Time. Now that his son is all grown up, the actor hasn’t wasted time, appearing in TV shows like The Platform and Supergirl.\n\nDo you have a story to share that made you appreciate the sacrifices your parents made for you? Do you think single parents can be equally successful at raising children?\n\nBonus\n\nCheck out the game Hungry Shark Arena and get ready for the underwater adventure!"
