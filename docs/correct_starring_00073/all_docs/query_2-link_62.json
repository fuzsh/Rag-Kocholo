        "text": "After establishing himself as a talent to watch in episodes of \"Life Goes On\" (ABC, 1989-1993) and \"Beverly Hills 90210\" (Fox, 1990-200), actor Dean Cain made his name by donning the red cape for \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" (ABC, 1993-97). For several years, opposite co-star Teri Hatcher, Cain made the widely-played role his own. By opting to portray both Superman and Clark Kent as hunky heartthrobs in a contemporary romance, Cain helped pave the way for the mainstream acceptance of comic book superheroes. It did not hurt that he was a good-looking former athlete whose freak knee injury was all that stood in the way of a pro football career. After \"Lois & Clark\" left the airwaves, Cain receded from the headlines, though he continued to work, hosting a revamped \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" (TBS, 1999-2004), exploring his villainous side in the thriller \"Out of Time\" (2003), and playing the murderous, deceitful Scott Peterson in \"The Perfect Husband\" (USA, 2004). Cain continued working steadily in both TV and film, co-starring in the series \"Clubhouse\" (CBS 2004-05) and \"Hit the Floor\" (VH1/BET 2013- ) and appearing in films ranging from religious drama \"God's Not Dead\" (2014) to supernatural horror \"The Appearing\" (2014)."
