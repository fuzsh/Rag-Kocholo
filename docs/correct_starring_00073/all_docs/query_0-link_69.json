However, a new Sikorsky production prototype was tested on December 6, 1960 that would revolutionize travel. These new luxurious Sikorskys were designed from the start specifically for airline use and to airline standards - capable of carrying 3 crew members, 28 passengers, and 1000 pounds of cargo. Each one had a General Electric turbine-powered, twin-engine, advertised as “quiet, comfortable, safe!” In April, 1961. the 200-hour tie-down test was completed within 20 days. A provisional Type Certificate was awarded on May 22, 19st, and on June 21 the Type Inspection Authorization was received, with the Final F.A.A. Certificate to follow.\n\nLos Angeles Airways president C.M. Belinn was optimistic about these new helicopters, and expected a growth of “one thousand per cent the first full year of operation and 2000% by the end of the second year.” Five brand new Sikorsky 61-L turbocopters boasting “twin-turbine reliability…all weather flight capability” were expected to be in use by Los Angeles Airways during late 1961. Starting in November of 1961, the first of four S-61L Sikorskys were delivered to the airline. The following year in March of 1962, the airway began operating the S-61Ls.\n\nBy 1961, Los Angeles Airways’ passenger Sikorsky “Copter Liners” had carried more than 2,000,000 passengers over 60,000,000 miles, in a “convenient, relaxed way…over freeway jams.” By this time, Los Angeles Airways was making 60 flights per day from Los Angeles International Airport to Disneyland (at $15 for one round-trip fare), Anaheim - and total one-way time, was an astounding 15 minutes (though some historians claim that there were“22 flights a day” to and from Disneyland! That very same year (of 1961), Disneyland’s decision makers were also so confident in Los Angeles Airways’ Sikorsky fleet, that the Disneyland Hotel was given its own Heliport, which accommodated 2 helicopters at one time. The third copter-liner arrived by May of 1962, and by the end of the month, the three had flown a total of 1,597 hours of airtime. The fourth (and final) helicopter was delivered to the company on July 10, 1962.\n\nThe helicopters over Disneyland were so popular that when (in 1960) the Los Angeles Sound Effects Company produced a record of sounds (of popular Southern California attractions, intended for use by filmmakers), the Los Angeles Airways Sikorskys were among the tracks included. You may have heard these very sounds over radio or television broadcasts from 1960 onward! A Sikorsky-style commercial helicopter was even featured on this (c.1966) post-Tencennial Disneyland map (below)!\n\n“The Tragic Flight of Los Angeles Airways 61031”\n\nHowever, just five years after the aforementioned photograph was taken (and after twelve years of service to Disneyland), something terrible would happen that would end this form of transportation to the happiest place on earth. The demise of Los Angeles Airways flights to Disneyland came when one Sikorsky 61L (registration number N300Y, serial number 61031) was involved in a fatal crash on the evening of August 14th, 1968.\n\nTragically (and mournfully), eighteen passengers and three crew members lost their lives, while en route to Los Angeles International Airport from Disneyland. Mechanical failure was determined to be the cause of this devastating and horrific crash. The National Transportation Safety Board specifically attributed the incident to “fatigue failure of one rotor blade, which resulted in separation of the blade”. The helicopter could not be controlled and quickly fell from the sky. It is unclear if negligence was involved, if the sensor malfunctioned, or if the stress and failure was undetected and sudden. Whatever the case, countless lives were affected and changed forever by this catastrophic event. From 1951 to 1968, there hadn’t been any notable incidents involving commercial Sikorsky helicopters. However, during 1968 there were two situations resulting in many fatalities (the aforementioned one, and another Sikorski S-61L in Paramount). Both of these Sikorskis were in the service of Los Angeles Airways.\n\n“The End of An Era”\n\nDisneyland Guest Hotel Directories continued to list the telephone extension for Los Angeles Airways up to September of 1970. However, not even Golden West’s “eleventh hour” attempt to acquire Los Angeles Airways could save the helicopter commuter airline from what would happen next. The deal fell through, and would result in the demise of Los Angeles Airways airline operation during 1971. Golden West would only briefly take over helicopter operations for a mere five more months, but it was the end of an era (not only for Los Angeles Airways, but) for helicopter flights to and from Disneyland. By the summer of 1971, Vacationland magazine (published three times yearly by Walt Disney Productions and distributed to more than 1,500 hotels, motels, and leading tourist attractions) had stopped advertising Los Angeles Airways’ “Helicarrier service” among the public transportation alternatives serving Disneyland.\n\nHowever, this wasn’t the end of Igor Sikorsky’s Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (which was the world’s first mass-producer of helicopters, since 1942). They would go on to manufacture many aircraft designs, such as its 61-L. This particular model is still utilized for military, industrial, and civilian applications to this very day!\n\n“Let’s dine at Disneyland,” on the 600 block of Main Street U.S.A.), in Town Square at Disneyland® Park!\n\n“Participant Sponsorship”\n\nOur story begins in 1954, when Walt was searching for participants to lease shop and restaurant spaces at Disneyland, and help generate the necessary capital to fund construction of Disneyland. In a synergistic relationship, the companies (in turn) could sell their products and advertise their corporate names in the Park. Disneyland Participant Corporate Sponsors were carefully selected. High quality, long term corporate sponsors would provide incremental income that enabled Disneyland to enhance its show and attractions, offset some operating expenses, and capitalize on marketing opportunities.\n\nSeveral of these turn-of-the-century pioneers, “reliable old firms” sponsored the “abundance of restaurants devoted to pleasing all tastes and all budgets,” according to “The Story of Disneyland,” published 1955. Ultimately, Maxwell Coffee House Division of General Foods became one of those forty-seven lessees to sign a contract with Walt Disney Productions (regarding creating happiness at Walt Disney’s Disneyland)!\n\nIt was estimated that the table service facility would have the capacity to serve about 400 guests per hour. Despite the fact that Maxwell Coffee House Restaurant did not open in July of 1955, it became reckoned among Disneyland’s twenty eating facilities which were predicted to contribute to accommodating “15,000 persons daily, hitting a peak of 60,000 o holidays and week-ends…” and one of “twenty restaurants and snack bars, capable of saving 8,000 hourly,” at least according to “Building A Dream” (prepared by the Disneyland, Inc. Public Relations Department). Years later in 1958, Bank of America appraisers figured of the total income received from leases, 16.02% was derived from the selling of advertising rights and 40.12% from the leasing of space to concerns whose main reason for occupancy is for advertising purposes. The remaining 43.86% of the lease income was derived from stores that sell various products and food. It is this income that supported the construction and growth of Disneyland. Clearly, these participant corporate sponsors were not here to make money, but to create happiness!\n\n“Design”\n\nAccording to “THE DISNEY THEME SHOW - an introduction to the art of Disney outdoor entertainment: Volume II”: Of all the guests’ senses that come into play at Disneyland, the most difficult response to predict was taste. If 70,000 guests were to arrive on a single day, there would probably be 70,000 different ideas about food. Generally speaking, Disneyland food locations fall into three categories - sit-down restaurant service, “buffeteria,” and fast-food categories. The most extensive theming has always been found in the sit-down restaurant locations but all locations were housed in authentically motified facilities.\n\nAs Walt described to Bob Thomas (of Associated Press), “some industries will have exhibits, but all of them must be in keeping with the era.” Soon (c. 1954-1955), Sam McKim (with audiences in mind) and possibly other contributing artists were creating designs for the Maxwell Coffee House Restaurant Show Building Facade. This building would camouflage a construction wall.\n\nEarly thumbnail sketches and other concept artwork of Disneyland seemed to be unencumbered by restrictions of budget, schedule or the laws of nature and physics. Though guided by Walt, his artists appeared to engage in “free-thinking,” as if implementing the modern “Blue Sky” Imagineering process. Like some advanced “High Concept,” final designs were quickly generated and approved.\n\nNext, architectural drawings helped define all designs, production and construction strategies, costs, schedule, and resource requirements. “Disneyland is unique in that some of the world's foremost creative artists and architects control all design at Disneyland.“ Models explored the various dimensional relationships, site-lines, flow patterns, ergonomics, and visual appeal to convey the desired creative intent.\n\n“Construction”\n\n“When the giant earth-moving undertaking was completed, the building crews took over. Soon, the rat-tat-tat of riveters was shattering the air, and sparks were flying from welders’ torches as the steel frameworks, capable of withstanding the ravages of time and the elements rose above the newly formed ground. While carpenters hammered and masons laid row upon row of brick and stone and mortar, the permanent buildings began to take shape and form,” according to “The Disneyland Story” published 1955. One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Main Street Opera House, which was used as the Mill. Here, the woodwork of Disneyland was generated - from the functional to the aesthetic! Approximately three and one-half million board feet of lumber went into the Park’s construction. Much of the wood was processed here by McNeil Construction (which formerly constructed Walt Disney Studio sound stages in 1947 and 1953), and under the direction of George Mills Sr. (the Prime General Contractor and Mill Foreman).\n\nThen, under the direction of Joe Fowler (Construction Supervisor), as well as Charles Alexander and Ray Conway (Construction Field Supervisors), the lumber was soon fashioned into the framing belonging to the very first buildings constructed at Disneyland - primarily the Main Street Complexes (on each side of the street).\n\nIn constructing each building, a concrete foundation and slab floors were prepared, followed by wood frame construction (while store units would have a combination wood and rigid steel frame). ”The first fabricated steel for the Main Street buildings arrived November 8 and was erected,” according to the narrator of “Disneyland - The Park,” a Disneyland anthology television series excerpt, first aired 1957 and Disneyland LINE (November 22, 1979). The roof covering was a variable, dependent on the architectural design.\n\nAs of June 2, 1955, C.V. Wood Jr. sent an Inter-Office Memorandum to Walt Disney regarding the best estimates that could be obtained at the time regarding the completion status of individual sections of the Park and Opening Day. C.V. wrote: “Building #612 - Maxwell House. Will not be completed. We will have to dress. Electric Signs: All are in work - with the exception of the shoe store and the Bank of America, all will be completed.“\n\nThe building (as each on Main Street U.S.A.) possessed complete fire sprinkling systems. By June 30, 1955, related Disneyland Site Work Fire Protection Utilities Plot Plans were prepared for Disneyland Inc., by J.E. Thomasson of WED Enterprises Inc.\n\nAll fixtures were placed in their correct motif and many light fixtures of Disneyland were authentic antiques. The Disneyland News added: “From its wrought iron and old stonework exterior to the patio-type serving area, the Maxwell House represents all that was fine and gracious in turn-of-the-century life in the New Orleans section of the Old South. Built to resemble a hotel of that time and place, it offers a jewel-like lobby sumptuously dec orated with crystal chandeliers and velvet and plush furnishings. Past the lobby is the intimate coffee shop, serving coffee and pastries. Although indoors, the coffee shop ceiling fades away to a midnight blue and stars twinkle above.”\n\nThe wrought iron work and staff work was also performed right on the jobsite by Lawrence G. and Bruce McNeil’s forces.\n\nFood service equipment was provided by Coast Distributing Company of Los Angeles (who ran a “Congratulations” message to Walt Disney and Staff in “The Disneyland News”, Vol. 1, No.2 ; August 10, 1955).\n\n“The Greatest Guy In The World - The Man Who Takes His Family Out To Dine”\n\nWe are (of course) referring to another individual (in addition to Walt), who was key to the placement of the Disneyland lessee. The Maxwell Coffee House (as other restaurants and concessions) was strategically placed by Mister James D’Arcy. Owning to this, Ron D’Arcy would become part of the opening Maxwell House crew. Long before New Orleans Square, the decor of the Maxwell House represented “the New Orleans section of the ‘Old South’. Built to resemble a hotel of that time and place, it offers a jewel-like lobby sumptuously decorated with crystal chandeliers and velvet and plush furnishings. Past the lobby is the intimate coffee shop, serving coffee and pastries. Although indoors the coffee shop ceiling fades away to a midnight blue and stars twinkle above.” If some of the “railing and cresting (found here and other places on Main Street U.S.A. and Frontierland)” look authentic, its because some of them actually “came from old plantations in Nashville, Memphis, Tennessee, and some came from San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento, California, dating back to the ‘49 days,” according to “News From Disneyland” (a Press Release document published c. 1956).\n\nMaxwell Coffee House at Disneyland offered guests a variety of Maxwell House beverages including delicious Maxwell House Coffee, refreshing Maxwell House Iced Coffee, steaming Maxwell House Tea, refreshing Maxwell House Iced Tea, Baker’s rich Hot Cocoa, and Baker’s Ice Cold Chocolate Flavored Drink. Though the restaurant did not serve meals, it did carry a variety of light snacks (or, “Specialty items”) including Apple Sauce Cake, Homemade Danish pastry (served warm), Superb Cheese Cake (which paired well with a cup of Maxwell House Coffee), Old Fashioned Strawberry Short Cake, Assorted French Pastries, Hot Fudge Ice Cream Cake, and a fancy Jell-O gelatin dessert topped with whipped cream!\n\nOn December 10, 1956, George Banning, distributor of Maxwell House coffee provided beverages for the First Annual Christmas Party.\n\nBoth Walt Disney and those who held his business ethics, principles, and standards for Disneyland, made sure that the price of coffee was always economical and reasonable. Walt assured that coffee was “only worth a dime.” This was true during Maxwell’s participation and during participation of the following sponsor. After Walt’s passing, “Card Walker, Vice President of advertising and sales, further insisted, ‘Disneyland will always have a ten-cent cup of coffee.’ It wasn’t until after Walt’s passing in 1966 that the price increased,” according to “Eat Like Walt - The Wonderful World of Disney Food” by Marcy Smothers.\n\nThe corporate synergy was good for a time. Institutional lessee Maxwell House Coffee yielded some revenue for Disneyland Inc. - $28,599 for the fiscal year ending September 29, 1957 and $79 for the remainder of its occupation during the fiscal year ending September 28, 1958. The synergy was also beneficial for both. For instance, when the Disneyland Recreational Club and Athletic Coordinator Frank Smith sponsored a new Gun Club, Maxwell House Coffee Shop hosted Disneylanders attending the first meeting on January 10, 1958.\n\nFuture additions to Maxwell were soon planned for Building 600, which would have included a large room and an office.\n\n*Some sources (i.e. “Disneyland Rides & Attractions and Attendance Report” Fiscal Year 1981) cite July 1st, 1956\n\n“HOWDY FOLKS! Welcome to the little mining town of Rainbow Ridge - the gateway to Nature’s Wonderland.” When Disneyland first opened there were only a few ways to explore this portion of Frontierland - all of them by horse or mule. There were Stagecoaches, Conestoga Wagons, Yellowstone Coaches, and mule trains which traversed seven acres of Disneyland to bring it all to life.\n\n“New Pages of the Disneyland Story”\n\nNow, on the eve of Disneyland’s first day of operation, Walt had promised that “Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow, to add new things, as long as there is imagination left in the world.” So it must have seemed strange to some when a year later (during 1956), “a few of Disneyland’s fabulous rides closed temporarily, [when] construction operations in Frontierland… made it necessary to shut down the three ‘Painted Desert’ rides - the Stage Coach, the Mule Pack Train and the Conestoga wagon,” according to “The Disneyland News” (Extra Edition). Only a few days prior, at a meeting of the Disneyland Merchant's Association (held January 25, 1956), a momentous announcement was made: “All horsedrawn vehicles in the Frontierland area will be shutdown for approximately two months, during the redesign and reconstruction of this area. This will be a whole new development to increase ride capacity. We are building a mountain to be called Rainbow Mountain. This will be seen from the River and the Mark Twain. The existing corral and Black smith Show will be the entrance to a new ‘Mine Train’ ride. This will be an old fashioned Mining Train with 6 open cars. The engine will look like a real engine. The ride will go through a canyon out into the desert; then into a Rainbow Mountain where you tunnell with stalagmites and stalactities and three different water falls of different colors, joining in the river. This ride will take about 6 minutes. One of the most interesting rides we have in the park is the True Life Boat Ride. Me hope to make the ‘Mine Ride’ an equal to that one.”\n\nThough Walt set the “Painted Desert” budget at $400,000, nearly $500,000 of improvements (of a total $1.5 million total Park investments for 1956) brought major developments and “reconditioning” to the Painted Desert area of Frontierland! A new town sprang up in the hills overlooking Frontierland, newly rails were laid, and the opportunity arose to head past rushing rivers and into the uncharted caverns and caves of the Painted Desert! “Towering above the scene, Rainbow Mountain provides a snow-capped background for all this action,” according to the “Disneyland 1st Anniversary Souvenir Pictorial,” published 1956.\n\nAs some of these new Frontierland attractions appeared on page 5 of The Disneyland News (published June of 1956), the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train began to prove the truth of Walt Disney’s promise of an ever-expanding Disneyland! Similar to how Walt Disney’s True Life Adventure series spawned True Life Adventureland, Nature’s Wonderland (and its refurbishment) were directly influenced by films released from 1950 to 1954. But while those films were “two-dimensional in scope, the Theme Park surrounds the guests with the story and impacts all of their senses”, according to “Disney By Design” Tour scripts. Artists like set designer Wilson “Bill” Martin (who had left 20th Century Fox, to work on Walt Disney Productions’ Disneyland project) was influential in the design of Nature’s Wonderland, his talents as art director applied to the attraction.\n\nThough total investment for Disneyland had now reached $18,500,000, the rich story of the Mine Train was among the attractions that were projected to add a 40% ride capacity to the Park!\n\nToday, our story begins at a junction in the small mining town of Rainbow Ridge. Instead of saddling up atop a dusty pack mule, we’ll load into a mine train gondola for what would typically be a seven minute excursion, en route to a “wondrous” destination tucked deep in the earth! A place where (according to Holiday magazine, published Summer, 1958), “seven multicolored waterfalls cascade and stalactites and stalagmites form beautiful patterns.” However, today we won’t look at our watches, or worry about the uniform “trip time.” We won’t heavily rely on the pre-recorded voice-over narration of Dallas McKinnon, or the script. Instead, I’ll be providing a custom spiel along our journey, which will be of an undetermined time length.\n\nOur “tickets for today’s adventure”, and a rare view of the magnificent Rainbow Caverns tickets (pictured above), come courtesy of collector and historian James Keeline. Further, James is “just the ticket” when it comes to the facts about these rare Rainbow Mountain attraction admission tickets!\n\nWhat were the earliest Disneyland tickets like?\n\n“In the first few years of Disneyland the tickets sold inside the park were often for specific attractions. There were also tickets sold, perhaps at a later date, with A-B-C-D-E.”\n\nWhat was the original price of one admission to the “Rainbow Caverns”?\n\n“We can fine tune it by noticing the adult price…on the ticket…(50¢). The price stayed the same for a few years but the lettered individual tickets started to appear in this era too.”\n\nWhy are these (previously pictured) tickets labeled ‘Rainbow Caverns’?\n\n“The region was initially called the ‘Painted Desert’ [in 1955]. It was redeveloped to add the Mine Train and the name became the ‘Rainbow Desert.’ The desert portion was called the ‘Living Desert’ for the Nature's Wonderland era.”\n\nWhat do those punched holes (in the previous photo) indicate?\n\n”The hole in each ticket was part of the distribution mechanism. ‘VOID’ was used when they wanted to have tickets to put on display in the park ticket booths if people wanted to trade them in towards passports, etc.”\n\nLater, admission during 1958 was one “jumbo” “D” coupon (the price of 35 cents, for one child), the same as the Jungle Cruise, Indian War Canoes, or the Tom Sawyer Island Rafts.\n\nTicket inspectors - you’ve got to hand it to them! After you hand your ticket to them, they place it in the Ticket Box. The Ticket Box was usually made of fiberglass or metal and supported a ticket bag or container, and in which torn admission coupons are de-posited. The Ticket Bag was a canvas liner of a ticket box used to collect torn admission coupons. The Ticket Container was a plastic container which fit inside a ticket box (in place of a ticket bag) and was used to collect torn admission coupons.\n\nOur Rainbow Caverns tickets will be taken by the Ticket Receptionist, on the Rainbow Ridge Boarding Platform, before embarking on our journey.\n\nPeople like Dick Tryon (Manager of Ticket Sales, 1955-59) would have somewhat familiar with these tools and procedures.\n\nNow, we’re ready to “get back on track” and take a ride!\n\n*Official opening ceremonies took place on June 12th, 1960. Some sources (i.e. “Disneyland Rides & Attractions and Attendance Report” Fiscal Year 1981) cite January 3rd, 1977.\n\nBeginning October 11th, 1959, Mine Train excursions through the Rainbow Mountain Mining & Exploration Co. briefly ceased for refurbishments that were well worth the wait! About this time, Walt Disney was quoted (in Wisdom magazine, published December 1959), “I have great love of animals and laughter.” Given this expression, it wasn't any surprise when (during the following year of 1960), a $1.8 million construction cost far exceeded the preliminary construction estimate of $900,000 given Bank of America appraisers in 1959. This amount brought tunnels, bridges, a mountain, and an unprecedented cast and show to the 7-acre (or, 14 of “nature’s half acres”) parcel of “North American wilderness” in Frontierland!\n\nJoe Fowler (Disneyland Operations Committee) and Earl Vilmer oversaw the Construction & Maintenance division including Engineering, New Construction, Maintenance, and Janitorial related to the installation of the attraction.\n\nShow design was heavily inspired by Walt Disney’s award-winning True-Life Adventures! According to “A University of Disneyland Guide For Nature’s Wonderland Hosts and Hostesses” : “No dress designer can duplicate the wardrobe of nature ; no prop designer or special effects man can do better than a meek imitation of nature’s own trees, rocks…waterfalls. It’s impossible to compete with the Aurora Borealis or a Pacific sunset for a backdrop. But in Nature’s Wonderland in Disneyland, people from around the world can enjoy nature as it is…or as it was…with accuracy and fidelity. To bring the beauty of drama of nature to mankind has been one of Walt Disney’s interests.” This Walt had previously effected through his True-Life Adventures series of theatrical films, where those animals were viewed on a screen.\n\nMany of those films would become most influential to the show design of the Disneyland attraction! There was “In Beaver Valley” which had previously been awarded for Best Two-Reel Short Subject of 1950. On November 10, 1953, Walt released “The Living Desert,” the first film distributed by the new Buena Vista Distribution. The film won an award for Best Documentary Feature, 1953. Later at the 1954 Oscars (a year before the Opening day of Disneyland), Walt Disney & RKO Radio Productions’ “Bear Country” was awarded an Oscar for “Achievement in Two-Reel Short Subject, 1953” at the 26th Academy Awards Ceremony. Upon accepting one of his awards that day, Walt declared, “Well, I just wanna say on behalf of my staff (and especially the naturalist photographers who have played such a great part in making the nature films), ‘Many, many thanks!’” Soon, “the youngster who never saw an elk except in a parade or convention” would soon be “able to see Olympic Elk as he lived his life in Nature’s Wonderland,” at least according to the same aforementioned publication. This “composite True-Life Adventure… based on elements of four Disney Films - Beaver Valley, Bear Country, The Living Desert and The Olympic Elk,” would be the product of a great deal of Walt’s studio staff. [“Walt Disney Disneyland,” page 44, printed by Officine Grafiche Arnoldo Mondadori - Verona; first published 1964]\n\nWalt Disney’s Imagineers knew their audience. About a year after Disneyland began its first day of operation, Herb Ryman continued to produce rough drawings detailing proposed Show additions to the island and shores of Frontierland’s “River Ride.” One particular (c. 1956) rough sketch produced in ink (on exhibit at The Walt Disney Family Museum, Gallery 9) lists natural scenic elements - “Semi-Submerged Logs”, “Dead Trees With Moss”, a “Cave Up High On Bank”, “Rock Strata Ledges”, “Some Cypress Swamp Area,” as well as “Animals” (like “Bear, Buffaloes, Deer, Wild Turkey, Grouse, etc., Goat, Bighorn”). Claude Coats (a WED Project Designer with a talent for color and styling) played a key role in the attraction’s development, according to his “Capsule Biography” prepared for WED Enterprises.\n\nBy now, “One of the most popular, and beautiful, attractions in the Park, the Mine Train journey through Nature’s Wonderland,…[was] based on elements of four Disney films, three of them Academy Award winners. In Beaver Valley, Bear Country, The Living Desert, and Olympic Elk, provided the inspiration for the seven-acre adventure,” according to Disney News (published Winter 1967-1968). Recreating something “natural” requires work similar to that of a movie studio. “A University of Disneyland Guide For Nature’s Wonderland Hosts and Hostesses” continues : “To recreate Nature’s Wonderland required the skills of the photographer, the naturalist, the artist, the landscape designer, the mechanic, the plumber, and many others.”\n\nRockWork and hardscape was designed with much tooth (texture and rough surface). Then areas were landscaped.\n\n“The Flora of Nature’s Wonderland”\n\nFor instance, a total of 156 species of plants, trees, and flora were imported into Nature’s Wonderland and placed by landscape architects Evans and Reeves, to generate authentic settings. Among these were palo verde trees, mesquite, joshua trees, and cactus. According to Vacationland magazine (published Summer, 1960), the result was a Western Mine Train that would take guests through “a faithful recreation of the forest regions of Wyoming, the deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, mountain terrain of Colorado and many other sections of western wilderness…”\n\nOne arid rock canyon in Nature's Wonderland averaged 110 degrees of heat with virtually no water. It was the perfect home for California juniper, Joshua tree, piñon pine and red-flowering ocotillo.\n\nIn addition, Walt had the telephones along the backdrop of Frontierland removed, paying the utility company to place the telephone poles underground.\n\nThis attraction would be (according to the very same c.1960 Vacationland), “populated by the natural inhabitants : an assortment of 50 separate varieties of bird, beast, and reptile, representing every specie of animal still roaming the North American continent.” The larger (and more varied) animal cast of 204 life-like animals (according to “The Disneyland Diary”), were first envisioned by character animator Marc Davis and then translated and developed into three dimensions by artist Bob Mattey (who helped build the terrifying “40-ton” squid which James Mason battled in “20,000 Leagues Under The Sea”), who would now help bring these animals to life using similar methods (and new ones).\n\n“Audio-Animatronics”\n\nDeveloped by WED Enterprises, this amazing system utilizes pneumatics hydraulics and electronics to animate human, animal, and other three-dimenstonal figures. Many Disneyland attractions feature Audio-Animatronics figures. “The term ‘Audio-Animatronics’ was first used to describe the bears and beavers in Nature's Wonderland.”\n\nTo accomplish this show, the attraction would employ Audio-Animatronics® - the Disney-designed system that combines sound, mechanics and electronics for three-dimensional animation. The (more than two hundred) “mechanical marvels” included representatives of : Coyote, Beavers (pictured above), Frogs, Ravens, Raccoon, Prairie Dogs, Blue Jays, Black Bears, Rainbow Trout, Side Winders, Meadowlark, American Eagles, Bobcats, Owl, Burrowing Owls, Hawk, Elk, Jack Rabbit, Antelope, Gila monster, Swallows, Robins, Road Runners, Lizard, Grazing Elk, Woodpeckers, Wild Pigs, Mountain Lions, Wild Turkey, Badgers, Skunk, Fox, Quail, Ferret, Armadillo, Rattlesnakes, and Desert Tortoise. By this time, WED Enterprises, Inc. (which later created designs and held patents for Audio-Animatronics) had come a long way in making their animals move. These animated figures were not as the sophisticated Tiki Room Birds, pirates and presidents that followed, but they did have varying degrees of animation - “one or two movements to many complex body actions.” Most of this movement was accomplished through “electronic hydraulic-pneumatic” technology combined with the early “cam-lever” technology. There were hidden well - “skins” or the ground hiding metal bases. There were cement rocks (which animals were bolted to), hiding the mechanisms and self-contained hydraulics systems. Fiber-glas rocks and trunks (with doors) housed animation electronics. Other animals in the water (as fish and bears), had timer controls and proximity switches to trigger their “swimming” animations.\n\nAccording to Bob Thomas (of Associated Press), “all of these [were]… formed in plastic, stuffed with mechanical innards, covered with real skins treated for weathering.” Unlike true-life animals, many of these animated characters (i.e. the Bears, Battling Elk, Prong Horn Antelope, the Mountain Lion, and even the Balancing Rocks) now “ran on timers,” typically following the script, and acting on cue when all went well. These actors were costly - for instance the Bears alone cost $64,733, the total cost of all Sheep was $29,449, all the Gray Foxes cost $2,933, and the Raccoons cost $3,294 (to highlight the value of a few). As a sidelight, part of this expense included the high cost of natural skin coverings, (which were swiftly changed to synthetic skins around 1962).\n\nBy April of 1960, the total cost of the Show had reached $1,800,000. By June of 1963, the cost of the props, dressings, and “actors” involved in this particular enormous Disneyland show was divulged in one publication, at a total of $2,581,000 - surpassing “the original combined cost of the Statue of Liberty, Grant’s Tomb, and the original production of Ben Hur”. Due to the large audience at Disneyland, many of these were conveniently inspected by Walt Disney at his Walt Disney Studio in Burbank. You may recall seeing images of Walt and Bob Sewell inspecting Mountain Lions, or Walt and Wathel Rogers inspecting scaled-down models of animated elk during this time.\n\nThe DISNEYLAND ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT was the coordinating group working between the world's most unusual creative organization - WED - and the world's most unique maintenance organization. Disneyland engineers work closely with maintenance artisans and WED personnel, who are responsible for the show at Disneyland. A conventional routine directed engineer may become involved in a bear who isn't properly scratching his back or some other critter. The Disneyland welding department staff was capable of working on all types of metal and using all types of welding techniques. They had to be flexible, fast, and ingenious, with a specific skill in performing ten rush jobs at one time. The staff performed their surgical work on crabs, elephants, hippos, battling elks, drunken pirates, and dancing dolls in Small World.\n\nBud Washo remembered how Walt would even act out animation. “I remember working on the Painted Desert and we were talking about the bobcat on top of the big cactus. He would stand up there and lift his hands up like paws, and he said...I want it to go ARRGGG!..like that.”\n\n“Disney's technicians have done well --- too well, in fact. The birds in Nature's Wonderland are so realistic that blackbirds (real ones) have been attacking ravens (animated variety) perched in the trees of Nature's Wonderland. Owls (Disney created) are being pecked into the repair shops by frustrated crows and blackbirds (live ones). And to top it off, a nest of baby red-tail hawks --- the realistic but unreal kind - so confused a mother bird flying overhead that she tried to deposit her own children's dinner down the throats of the young hawks! Wathel Rogers, a Disneyland animator, just shakes his head in puzzlement. ‘These migrating birds flying through Nature's Wonderland are a sight,’ he says, ‘They swoop down like dive bombers on the attack, sink their beaks into a raven's wing and take off as though someone had fed them a loaded worm. Then, from a tree nearby, they stare at the raven and try to figure out why he doesn't fight back!‘ The casualty report includes three ravens in Disneyland repair docks for shattered wings, an owl with a busted beak, and feathers all over the place. Live bird injuries have been restricted to wounded pride and broken spirits. Bill Martin, project director, indicates how complicated this situation may become. ‘The other day a bird landed on my head out here. When I brushed him off, he flapped away as though he had just seen a ghost move. I guess he thought I was animated too!!’”\n\nThose “brass-trimmed” locomotives (“patterned after the gold and silver ore carriers of a century ago) also received a rehabilitation and a new coat of paint (or two).\n\nThe result was an “all-new” exactly nine-minute (no more, no less), 2,307-foot Mine Train Thru Nature’s Wonderland route through “faithful recreations of the forest regions of Wyoming, the deserts of Arizona, and New Mexico, mountain terrain of Colorado and many other sections of western wilderness….These are dominated by Disneyland’s second great mountain, ‘Cascade Peak’, visible from almost all Frontierland and easily recognized by its giant waterfalls that plummet from rocky ledges high on its granite slopes”, according to Art Linkletter’s own description. In addition, the little mining town of Rainbow Ridge also experienced a “boom” of expansion and development as far as the highest ridge! The “D” (and ultimately “E” ticket attraction) featured multiple dramatic animatronic vignettes of “life and landscape” recreated from five of Walt Disney’s greatest True-Life Adventure movies (four of these Academy Award-winning) - Beaver Valley, The Olympic Elk, Bear Country, The Living Desert, and The Vanishing Prairie. The new attraction (which contributed toward carrying the total Park investment to $34,500,000) was both exciting and educational! Even more, it was Walt’s intention that those reflecting on “the animal world” would acquire “a renewed sense of kinship with the earth and all its inhabitants.”\n\nKeep a real sharp “hunters eye”, because you’re about to see one of the rarest Audio Animatronic creatures to ever set foot in Frontierland. We present the Mountain Goat near the top of the 75-foot RockWork of Cascade Mountain! The Mountain Goat had been spotted at the top of Cascade Peak, the Bounding Deer atop Rainbow Mountain over Beaver Valley, while the Bounding Big Horn Sheep were seen briefly along the Mule Train Trail in Beaver Valley). The Bounding Big Horn Sheep was even so prominently featured on the poster artwork for the Nature’s Wonderland Rail Road (which was modeled after the circa 1869 “Union Pacific Platte Valley Route Grand Opening” poster), which can be seen on the “Disneyland ‘60” handbills given to guests at the Main Gate! According to Bob Gurr’s True-Life tale, their bounding would spook the mule trains, so the Bounding Bighorn Sheep (atop Cascade Mountain), the three Bounding Deer (a buck, doe and fawn) at the top of Rainbow Mountain, as well as Mountain Goats would silently disappear within a month of the start of Mine Trains Thru Nature’s Wonderland. Similar precautions were taken by the Mine Train operators to not spook the mules with the bells or whistles.\n\n“MATT LEIKER REALLY REMEMBERS SEEING SOMETHING ATOP CASCADE PEAK, c. 1990”\n\n“Finally!!!! Something I have wondered about for over twenty years gets answered!!! When I was a trainer on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in the early 90s I used to hop the fence with my trainees and take ‘em out to explore the mule trails. I would also take ‘em inside Cascade Peak and we’d climb the ladder and exit outside the top for the view. As soon as we would emerge there was a rusted base, and parts of a mechanical contraption that you can tell once held some sort of object that would move or rock back and forth. Vintage Disneyland photos and history are everywhere now but back in the pre-internet days of 1994 there was absolutely no place to find out what was once there. I sometimes marvel at that…how even while working at the park, there were really no sources for quality park history or people around who knew (or even cared) what much of the old stuff was. The best you could ever find were framed photos of old attractions adorning the walls of a scheduling office but even those were usually the same tired staged photos that were used and reused in the souvenir guide books through the years.\n\nAnyway…I continued to wonder about this for years, always studying every old photo or postcard of the peak, looking for a sign of some animatronic, balancing rock or special effect that once existed up there. Over two decades passed with no luck but I remained absolutely sure that some show element used to exist up there. Finally, today the mystery question gets answered and confirmed!!!\n\nThank you.”\n\n“The Rainbow Caverns”\n\n“Now we’re going deep into the earth to view the dazzlin’ Rainbow Caverns. You’ll see giant stalagmites, stalactites ‘n colorful falls on ever side. Say, if yuh look real careful, you’ll see Geyser Grotto ‘n even the Witches Cauldron…!”\n\nAccording to Disney News (Spring, 1985), “A designs challenge posed by the addition of the Mine Trains through Rainbow Caverns’ became a springboard to one of Disney’s creative axioms. After winding through the desert terrain, the ol’ prospector’s train was to end up in a cavern of multicolored waterfalls, iridescent pools and geysers.” The original Rainbow Caverns featured all sorts of “true-life-like” formations. There was the golden Bridal Veil Falls, Red Devil Falls (red water pouring over rocks shaped like a devil), the Witches Cauldron… (which had red water falling over rocks shaped like an old witch, and then into a bubbling pot below), Paint Pot Falls, Geyser Grotto (spelled “Gyser Grotto” on a directional sign in the Caverns), and the falls of the Dance of the Seven Sisters (which gave the appearance of women dancing).\n\nAll the “Cavern Building” dark ride features were created by Claude Coats with schematics (like elevations) drafted by Sydney Louis Lev. The Second Edition of “Disneyland - The Nickel Tour” preserves images of Claude’s colorful concepts and developmental designs on pages 133 & 134. “Claude first set out designing a series of caverns, set deep in the mountain. He began by using an interesting asset the Disney Studios still had lying around... some leftover set pieces previously used in Walt's live-action feature film, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. (The rest of the sets wound up in Tomorrowland.) … Claude employed a crew of carpenters for several weeks, nailing up lumber and welding metal, turning the random set pieces into believable caverns. Before long they would be reincarnated as a part of Disneyland history.”\n\nOf course the most spectacular of these water features was the multicolored Rainbow Falls - a magical effect that did not come about by some mere “happy accident.”\n\n“‘I was trying to work out a rainbow-colored waterfall for the Mine Train ride,’” said artist designer Claude Coats. “‘I thought I had the thing working pretty good.’” At this time, Walt “called on a noted scientist to determine if it could be done.” This scientist’s name was Heinz Haber, a colleague of Werner Von Braun’s, and he proceeded to prove that the waters would splash together, and “within a week all of the colors would turn to gray,” according to Disney News (published Winter 1967-1968). Claude continued, “I told Walt what Heinz said about the rainbow waterfall being impossible to bring off. He just winked at me and said: ‘It’s kind of fun to do the impossible.’ So I started working about twice as hard and figured out a way to make it work.” [“Insights” by Steven Hulett ; “Disneyland 25” Advertising Supplement, January 20, 1980] The attraction with its show-stopping pinnacle opened within months, and guests could spot six vibrant colors! Some of this success can be attributed to Walt Disney who had formed a habit of always “exploring new paths and experimenting with new technologies.” It was said that “Walt, who seldom turned away from a challenge, merely impressed upon his staff, ‘its kinda fun to do the impossible,’” according to Disney News (Spring, 1985).\n\nYes, “approximately 270,000 gallons of water per hour are circulated to create the seven multi-colored waterfalls seen in the Rainbow Caverns in Frontierland. This is at a 40 foot head,” according to “A Complete Guide To Disneyland,” published 1957. This was so impressive that the first eight Tour Guides were given a Backstage Tour of the various pumps and dye processes to help them understand how the colors were maintained. Those colors truly never faded and this was further proven by the comments recorded in publications. For instance, three years later (during the summer of 1960), “new lighting and creations in color and unusual formations of stalagmites and stalactites have been added to the seven multi-hued underground waterfalls which cascade into boiling pools,” according to Vacationland, (Summer, 1960). Two years after that, the Guide Tour Script (1962) added : “It might interest you to know that the colored waterfalls are created through the use of fluorescent dyes in the water and black light. An elaborate … [six-pump] system [which] circulates over 43,000 gallons of water per hour.”\n\nIn 1963, the author of one sanctioned “Disneyland” publication referred to the creation of the effect (on the eve of another rehabilitation) stating: “Seemingly ‘impossible’ things are done as a matter of course at Disneyland. As an art director explains, the scientist who claimed that the design for Rainbow Caverns was not possible was absolutely right. But with a little persistence and ingenuity, a lot of baffles to separate the streams of colored water, and a lot more luck, the impossible project turned out to be feasible. And so, seven years after it was first opened at Disneyland, Rainbow Caverns is under-going extensive changes. Walt Disney has decided to make the underground attraction even more spectacular. And, while he is at it, he may add a color or two.”\n\nFinally, ultraviolet lamps were used in the attraction to give a glowing effect to the fluorescent paint. These new Show Quality enhancing fluorescent effects were so impressive, that scientist Edmund A. Braun drew attention to them in his book “Black Light Creates Fascinating Fluorescence” (published 1968) : “World-famous Disneyland makes use of fluorescence in its ‘dark’ rides…Disneyland’s Mine Ride also uses black light and fluorescence to great advantage.” By 1974, one quart of ultraviolet paint was still being used to keep the color balance just right, according to Cal Harnetiaux (Disneyland Paint Department). It is clear that by that time, the rainbow of colors hadn’t become one “authentic water-color gray” but continued to be distinct.\n\nNightly these pools and fountains were cleaned.\n\nNow, if guests could actually explore the “backside” of the magnificent Rainbow Caverns, they would discover several necessary areas, including various pumps on the Fantayland side, a Mine Train Storage Area, the Machine Shop, Sub Station No. 4, and even Disneyland Offices.\n\n“Maintenance”\n\nSince the beginning, the Four Keys of the DISNEYLAND Show (operating priorities in presenting the DISNEYLAND Show) have been present - Courtesy, Safety, Show, and Efficiency. Guided by these Four Keys, are Walt Disney Imagineers, who are always seeking out new magical opportunities to increase the efficiency, safety, and show quality of Disneyland adventures.\n\n“55er” Jim Harman remembered “l used to fight gophers in Nature's Wonderland At that time, the sound speakers were hidden in false rocks and the gophers would fill the speakers in with earth. They sent me into combat with the critters… I remember how, during the course of a season, the ants would eat the real fur off of the birds and animals.” During rainy seasons, the animals were covered to protect their fur and feathers.\n\nIn the name of the overall Park Show Quality, many rehabilitations kept Rainbow Ridge, and all of Nature’s Wonderland looking like a true-life adventure. For instance, Bob Johnson (who began working as the Park’s taxidermist under Bud Washo around 1960) made “the rounds of his 230 animals in Frontierland,” according to Backstage Disneyland (Fall of 1965). The same article continues : “In other scenes Bob has added a domestic touch by creating three baby skunks and two baby owls and placing them next to their adopted parents. Bob is also good at improvising. The plastic claws on the black bear broke repeatedly on the bottom of the stream as the bear scooped for fish. Bob solved the problem by designing a set of rubber claws.” Bob even rehabilitated the most difficult to recover - “the two diving bears” which “bob up and down and turn from side to side. The skin must have enough slack to allow movement yet not look too shabby.”\n\nOwning to the maintenance and rehabilitations, Disneyland (and the Mine Trains) have occasionally been utilized as a backdrop for many advertising campaigns made for television and publications (like magazines and newspapers). For instance, during September of 1962, Max Stewart, Larry Clemmons, and Art Crookshank (of the Walt Disney Studio) filmed and shot scenery from a Mine Train for Studio Production #3185. In their “minutes” they described their shoot this way : “We moved to the Mine Train Loading Dock. The Mine Train was held up (8) minutes. We loaded two Mine Trains, backed them up into the Rainbow Caverns and cued them non-stop through the loading dock.”\n\nAbout two years later, during July of 1964 (and in the name of Show Quality, before it was so-named), Bob Matheison (of the Customer Relations Division) was studying an area near the Mine Train and coming up with “a recommendation as to whether… [Disneyland] should have musicians there on Friday and Saturday evenings, within budget.” About one year later, photographs for the “Schwinn Takes A Trip To Disneyland” catalogue (including this one pictured above, where the town of Rainbow Ridge used as a background for the new Schwinn Fastback Sting-Ray models) were both shot at Disneyland during the Disneyland Tencennial celebration of 1965.\n\nBy 1964, the character of the 11th hole of The Magic Kingdom Golf Course of the Disneyland Hotel Golf Centre was still themed after the Painted Desert.\n\nFrom April 30 to May 25, 1973 the Mine Ride was closed for a 4-week rehabilitation.\n\nFinally, a decade after that, at least one Mine Train was used to carry Karen and Richard Carpenter during the filming of several scenes for their “Mr. Postman” music video released in 1975.\n\nBut by 1977, it was time to say “goodbye” and bid “farewell” to the two acres surrounding Rainbow Ridge as we knew it. The town of Rainbow Ridge disappeared from the hills overlooking Frontierland some time in 1977, when construction began, of the soon-to-be-iconic Big Thunder Mountain - ‘the wildest ride in the wilderness!’ Most of the buildings were temporarily moved to the Backstage, in order to be redeveloped for their relocation to Thunder Ridge. Some (like the Panhandle Hotel and the Big Thunder Epitaph) were present in 1956, and went on to exist for several decades.\n\nMaintenance salvage and tree boxing began around March of 1977, to “determine those elements of scenery and animation which can be saved from Nature’s Wonderland and put to future use.” Any critters that could be salvaged needed to be cleared out by May, when major demolition was scheduled to begin. [Disneyland LINE, February 24, 1977] Some simple figures and static figures (like coyotes, desert deer and marmots) were preserved, or repurposed, while a few that could not be moved, were either paved over or left in the river.\n\nAt Disneyland there is a \"story behind the story\" of every attraction, every attraction is a living experience for the guest. Disneyland ride-through attractions or adventures have officially been defined as an “individual show, ride, or exhibit designed to produce an entertaining Guest experience. Disney attractions stir the imagination, enliven the senses, and provide the participants with positive, innovative entertainment, which is the essence of the DISNEYLAND Show.” It is important to review the story of the attraction, tell the story, explain it, and create interest. This is the story of the Mule Pack.\n\nEquine have always been part of Walt’s vision for a Park. An early form of (what would come go be known as) the “Disneyland Prospectus” [prepared in 1953 for Disneyland Inc. by WED Enterprises], mentions a Mule Pack Ride - “Take a Mule Pack Ride with an old prospector for a guide through the colorful mother-lode country of the pioneer days.” The contemporaneous “Proposed Diagramatic Layout of Disneyland” (Marvin A. Davis’ plot plan, produced for WED Enterprises, by September 12, 1953) detailed a “Pack Mule Ride” as well as its route through this section of “Frontier Land.” It was also written that “the Mail-Order Catalogue will picture everything for sale in the Emporium or at any place in Disneyland. If you want a real pony and cart or a miniature donkey thirty inches high you’ll find it in the catalogue.” Clearly, the development of Disneyland necessitated Owen and Dollie living on the Walt Disney Studio Lot for the duration of their development.\n\nOne of the foremost aspects of future Disneyland attraction development that Owen supervised was fabrication of equine tack during 1954. Diane (eldest daughter of Walt Disney) once recollected, “Dad’s first grandchild, Christopher , was born in December of 1954. Disneyland was under construction at the time, and Owen and Dollie Pope were hired to acquire and train the horses and mules that the park would need to pull the horse cars and stage coaches down Main Street. To be close to the horses, the Popes lived in a trailer on the Studio’s back lot and then at Disneyland. Dad would often visit them and the horses. Owen was a skilled saddle maker and made this miniature saddle as a gift for Dad’s first grandchild. My husband Ron was in the army and stationed at Fort Ord, and we were living in Pacific Grove, California. When Mom and Dad flew up to see their first grandson, Dad brought this little saddle with him.”\n\nOwen and Dollie also oversaw the breeding and care of these Sardinian Donkeys, which were intended for “Frontier Land, which is Disney’s favorite section of the fair,” according to Loius Berg (Reporter for “This Week Magazine”)! In fact, they looked after the first Disneyland Cast Member. The “lovable little mule, Picolino, was the first of his breed to be ‘hired’ to work at Disneyland.” On that day, Walt Disney personally commissioned Herb Ryman to paint a portrait of Picolino (the first Disneyland Cast Member) to celebrate the occasion, and this Herb did, while standing with brush in hand before the Studio coral, according to “A Brush with Walt Disney” edited by Bruce Gordon and David Mumford, page 1963.\n\nSoon one authorized “Disneyland Information & Nomenclature List” (prepared by Bill Cottrell of Disneyland Inc., by May 25, 1955) divulged the details of the “Mule Pack Ride” to Disneyland, Inc. employees in the following way : “A pack ride into the motherlode country in the Old West.” Further, “2 packs” were detailed, consisting of “1 lead horse and 9 mules in each pack.”\n\nWhile most employees of Disneyland attended an orientation program, during this era, there were many Pony Farm employees who did not attend these sessions. Van Arsdale France remembered: “I think I managed to schedule almost everyone through orientation, with one exception. My only failure was with the people who were to operate the horse drawn vehicles. This operation was controlled by a crusty man named Owen Pope, whose headquarters were in what is still called ‘The Pony Farm.’ When I cornered him, he explained by saying, ‘Van, you're dealing with people people. We're horse people out here.’ He finally sent me one or two of his men. But, he was. doing his own training program.”\n\nBefore the Park opened, the Mules, Burros, and all equine were prepared for the noises that they would hear once On Stage in Frontierland (and other parts of Disneyland). Van Arsdale France once wrote: “He [that is, Owen Pope] was worried about the horses ‘spooking’ with all the sights and sounds of Disneyland. So, a recording of sounds from arcades and shooting galleries, and yelling kids made up. This was used as an audio aid for horse training. Since the horses were not directly on the payroll, they had to be carried as assets. All were given names. They all received names of people in accounting. Lucy Cotton, for example had a mule on the records named, ‘Lucy Mule.’” In so doing, Mule Wranglers who assisted Owen knew each equine “in their strings” including the new mules born at Disneyland.\n\nOne insert in area newspapers described how “Some of the more stubborn animals slid around the training area on their haunches two or three times before accepting the idea the older, lead horse was trying to get across. Trainers say all horse drawn equipment, from Frontierland stages to Fantasyland's Sardinian carts, will show the Disney perfection on opening day, July 18.”\n\n*Some sources state February 1st, 1973 and December 9th, 1973, while Disneyland LINE asserts October of 1973.\n\nIn 1960, a brand-new “seven acre composite True-Life Adventure called Nature’s Wonderland” would be “based on elements of four Disney films - Beaver Valley, Bear Country, The Living Desert and The Olympic Elk… a journey by mine train or pack mule into a wilderness populated by more than 200 life-like animals, birds and reptiles,” according to “Walt Disney Disneyland,” page 44, printed by Officine Grafiche Arnoldo Mondadori - Verona; first published 1964. Yes, the mules would now embark along a trail that offered alternate vantages of The Living Desert and the rest of Nature’s Wonderland! Youthful explorers could now see the “back country” of Nature’s Wonderland from the back of a sturdy and sure-footed pack mule, from dawn ‘til dusk.\n\nAs quickly as the Bounding Big Horn Sheep appeared atop Cascade Mountain (among the approximate 200 critters), it quickly disappeared so as to not threaten the mules. Precautions were also taken to not frighten the mules passing over Natural Arch Bridge. Operators would refrain from ringing the bell or blowing the whistle while the Mine trains passed below.\n\nBack in 1957, Disneyland maintained around 200 head of horses, ponies, mules, and burros. Despite all the equine-powered vehicles at Disneyland, most of these “200” were mules and burros. By 1962, Disneyland had a total of 195 horses and mules [according to an article by Art Linkletter published in The Ford Times Guide To Travel In The USA, published 1962]. Of course the latter figure still mostly included the mules and burros (98 mules and 68 burros were most of the head of horses kept by Disneyland by the summer of 1966). One may wonder why there were so many mules on hand and the reason is because the Mule Trains consisted of eight mules, and there were as many as “10 trains running during the summer” seasons, accruing to Backstage Disneyland (Summer, 1966).\n\nNone of these animals worked more than 4 hours a day, six days a week. When they weren’t working, the horses were stabled in clean and individual tie stalls, while the mules and burros had their own corrals and lots. “They receive excellent care, as does everything connected with Disneyland. Gear is kept clean, polished, and in good repair. A full-time farrier is kept on hand, and barns, stalls, tackrooms, and corrals are kept spic and span”, [according to The Western Horseman, published September of 1957].\n\nAccording to “Disneyland Inside Story”: “Although blessed with extraordinarily short work hours, the mules would stop for no apparent reason along the trail and refuse to continue, regardless of the verbal lashings applied by the mule skinner. And almost anywhere, at any time, one of the creatures would break into a loud and repetitious series of brayings that sounded astonishingly like ‘hee haw.’”\n\nMany notable Disneylanders had a privileged part in the Pack Mule rotation - the set order of operating positions established by the attraction's Working Lead. Plenty of Disneyland Cast Members had their start as Mule Riders, like “55er” Charlie Brock, Mike Leslie (eventual successor of Disneyland Pony Farm Supervisor Day Sechler), Walt Joseph Jackson Brickner (who was often mistaken for either Walt Disney or the late Clark Gable), and Eddie Dixon (another c.1965 Cast Member). Many of these had a passion for working with equine and most animals, like John Jay Pelletier. This is John’s story :\n\n“I had just come from canada in 1960 and gone from country living to city living. I think in 1961 dad had just got a new job and took the family to Disneyland. At that time they had Tom sawyer’s Island (and I enjoyed that), the canoes, and the mule train. I was 15 the first time I went. Mom and dad loved the jamboree and the Golden Horseshoe saloon. We had ice cream, pop corn, apple candy, and that sort of stuff. I remember the fantasy of it all, and the characters. That was my first experience with Disneyland.\n\nThen there was a Grad Nite. The gal I dated was a senior, and I had never seen Disneyland at night. It was all lit up, and so pretty. I lived in Fullerton and if we got on top of the house we could see the fireworks at night. One of my teachers worked for Disneyland, and mentioned that Disneyland was hiring. A friend of mine said, “Do you want to go work for Disneyland?” Come middle of may of 1965, he got a job right away on the monorail, and the Horseless Carriages, and the train. I never got the call, and went to work with my dad in the oil fields. I got the call [later] in the middle of June, and they asked if I had experience working with animals and mules. They said we have an opening on the mule train, and the pay starts around $1.75 an hour 1965. So, I went to work for the mule train, and the next thing I knew, I had my own train. I would load the kids, get the animals, feed them a little, give them a break, and then get back in line and do it again.\n\nHaving been raised on a farm in Canada, I learned to saddle up horses and teams of Mules to pull logs out of the forest. So I felt at home…it was fun. The hardest part was to tell people that they were too big [to ride]. Kids were the best, …I spent time with each one while adjusting the stirrups. I always carried pieces of carrots in my pocket for the stubborn ones. Mertal always got excited when she would see me. She knew I had carrots for her.”\n\nThe Mule Team was particularly close. Charlie Brock recalled one Thanksgiving. “There was a girl rider, name of Margaret Karl, and she said that she would fix the turkey and everybody to bring the trimmings. She brought a tablecloth and set the table in the old mule shed. She had a 23 pound turkey, and we had olives, cranberries and punkin' pie!”\n\nAt Disneyland there is a \"story behind the story\" of every attraction, every attraction is a living experience for the guest. Disneyland ride-through attractions or adventures have officially been defined as an “individual show, ride, or exhibit designed to produce an entertaining Guest experience. Disney attractions stir the imagination, enliven the senses, and provide the participants with positive, innovative entertainment, which is the essence of the DISNEYLAND Show.” It is important to review the story of the attraction, tell the story, explain it, and create interest. This is the story of the Omnibus.\n\n“Walt was reared in the mid-western town of Marceline, Missouri. As with other lands, he wanted Main Street to be a Main Street - authentically recreated to get the feel of a typical small town thoroughfare of the 1900 era with which he was familiar.”\n\nTake a close look at Main Street. “Note the results of years of research to determine and design a composite Main Street of the typical small town of the early century. Note the demanding attention to detail designed and built into every nook and cranny by Walt and his ‘Imagineers’ at WED Enterprises. This same demand for detail is designed into Main Street vehicles.”\n\nPlease watch your step aboard the 5/8 scale open-air, 13’ 3” - high, double-decked Omnibus that recalls the days of old in-city transportation while giving guests a view of the sights from the heights.\n\nI would like to begin our Omnibus story with an interesting sidelight. I would like to recall (perhaps) the first time this method of “old in-city transportation” was referenced in a work of Walt’s. You may be surprised to hear that the first time the words “Disneyland Omnibus” appeared in print, it was on the cover of a c. 1945 Walt Disney Mickey Mouse, Ltd. licensed hardcover book published by Collins Publishers (of London and Glasgow). The illustration on the cover even featured Mickey Mouse at the wheel of a double-decker bus with the words “To Disneyland” over the drivers’ section of the cab. This depiction was astoundingly made more than a decade before the Disneyland Omnibus became a reality.\n\nYou may recall hearing how Walt Disney, on the eve of Disneyland’s first day of operation, promised that “Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow, to add new things, as long as there is imagination left in the world.”\n\n“Main Street vehicles play an important part in the Disneyland show. First, they are essential to the staging of Main Street, U.S.A. The contrast to the hustle and bustle of our modern world and its streamlined modes of transportation is sharp and penetrating. Suddenly, as a guest comes onto Main Street, the entire mood changes. The years roll backward. back to Main Street, U.S.A., circa 1900. It wouldn't be Main Street without the leisurely clop-clop of a horse-drawn surrey, or the chug-chug of a horseless carriage.”\n\nSecond, they serve as much-needed transportation for our guests. They provide a convenient and colorful way to reach the heart of the Magic Kingdom - or back to Town Square after a long day in the Park. Third, hosts assigned to operate these vehicles play an important part in answering questions - giving tips and directions - to guests who are either starting out or winding up their day at Disneyland. Their role falls into what might be called our ‘first impression - last impression’ group. They can start guests off on the right foot - in the right mood, and send them away with a warm feeling - and a desire to come back.\n\nOmnibus #1 (license #E-26668) began operation a year later (during August of 1956), proving the truth of Walt Disney’s promise of an ever-expanding Disneyland! Brief footage of Omnibus #1 (devoid of any attraction advertisements) has been preserved on film, in the motion picture “Disneyland U.S.A.” and “Disneyland - The Park,” a Disneyland anthology television series short film (originally aired in 1957). Some (c. 1956) guests may have recollected riding a double-decked omnibus during the 1920s in London, New York City, Chicago, or Boston. Now, (up to 37) guests could take a scenic ride down Main Street U.S.A. to the hub of Disneyland, and the entrance of the four “lands”! “Camera fans especially like the unique angles the Omnibus’ second deck provides.”\n\nAll art work, posters, etc. displayed on the sides of the bus were created by the Walt Disney Studios.\n\nRon Dominguez (in interview with Disneyland LINE (Vol. 25 No. 28) recalled meeting Walt one Sunday afternoon, after the Omnibus debuted in 1956. Ron recalled being “in the back area of the Omni Bus with a little mechanical problem and Walt walked up.” Ron continues: “When we first brought out the bus, I personally thought it was the wrong scale for Main Street. Walt asked me how I liked the bus. Being real honest - and young - but still wanting to be diplomatic, I said that I thought it looked pretty good, but I had a bit of doubt in my voice. So he said, ‘What do you mean it looks pretty good? It looks damn good out there!’ So he put me in my place real quick.”\n\nThe Omnibus (of the Disneyland Transportation Company) was one of several exciting attractions debuting during 1956, a two-block ride that increased ride capacity, and (owning to this) one day in August saw a peak total of “197,547 individual rides” (on all attractions) enjoyed by Guests (according to a letter from Walt to Ward Kimball, dated January 23, 1957). Aside from the observations of Ron Dominguez, “it was such a hit with all who rode it that a second one was built,” according to “Walt Disney’s Magazine” (Vol. 2, No. 5 ; 1957).\n\n“A Brief Word About the Birds”\n\nHuman guests weren’t the only ones who found the “hot and fresh” popcorn served from Disneyland’s Cretors, irresistible! In the beginning, exotic wild geese, mallards, and other birds migrated to Disneyland. Others were either donated or purchased by Disneyland, Inc. something of an attraction in Disneyland. By 1959, the Rivers of America were teeming with white ducks whom were both raised and cared for by Disneyland, Inc. The Disneyland News (October 1956) once told the tale of Gertie the Duck who was “brought to Disneyland, and launched into the ‘Rivers of America’ from aboard the Mark Twain.”\n\nSoon, other wild life of North America had “‘discovered’ Disneyland. Flocks of wild geese, mallards, and other birds have found Frontierland’s River a safe retreat in their pilgrimages south. The birds pause to rest here, and in some cases stay on for several months,” according to “A Complete Guide to Disneyland” (published 1956, 1957). The “Disneyland Dictionary” (published 1959) noted: “Wild geese, mallards, and other birds around the island and mainland in Frontierland migrated here, and the white ducks on the Rivers of America were raised by Disneyland.”\n\n“55er” Mary Van Thyme recalled: “One time I was in my booth down on the raft dock and Milo Rainey and Bob Allen were on the dock. All of a sudden two ducks started fighting and biting each other's necks. So I called to Milo and Bob to put a stop to it. Milo strolled over, and with a big grin, said, ‘Don't be silly, dearie, haven't you heard about the BIRDS AND THE BEES?!’”\n\nThese feathered guests also took the opportunity to do more than rest - they dined! As you can see in the picture (above), some guests couldn’t help treating their feathered fellow guests to morsels of popcorn. The Wonderful World of Disney episode “Holiday Time at Disneyland” (1962) displayed images of a young guest tossing popcorn to feathered guests in the water, while the narrator joked, “Its no wonder when ducks fly into Disneyland, they make it their permanent home!” But therein was highlighted a problem - once the birds learn where to find “hand-outs,” they would never leave the Park. Even more, according to Backstage Disneyland magazine (Vol.1, No. 2, December, 1962), there persisted a “problem of ducks sleeping on our many ferocious wild animals throughout our park.”\n\nThese charming “Disney ducks” have continued to captivate guests, proving it isn’t so “tough to be a bird” as they manage to discover occasional \"handouts” near concessions. While at Disneyland, never mind what the “little old bird woman” says, because Guests are presently discouraged from feeding the birds! Ducks they do not require them, as they cleanup show contradictions like fallen popcorn that have a huge impact on the guest experience.\n\nWhile many artists contributed, the talented Herbert Ryman is of note. Herb had joined the Disney Studio in 1938, after Walt saw a public show of his work in New York. (Herb's paintings were being exhibited with those of another up and coming artist, Andrew Wyeth.) Herb Ryman acted as art director for such films as Fantasia and Dumbo, but had left Walt Disney Studios in 1946 and (by 1953) was employed by 20th Century Fox. Walt reached out to Herb and during one weekend (September 26 & 27, 1953) the first “Schematic Aerial View” over Disneyland originally produced!\n\nAfter new economic research reports had recommended a final resting place for Walt Disney’s Disneyland, artist Herb Ryman had hand-inked, one of the original Disneyland concept drawings - “Aerial Schematic View” over Disneyland - between September 26th and 27th, 1953. Subsequently, his original drawing was copied, and hundreds of resultant drawings were made (some of them hand-colored), based on the original (with constant modifications being made, as Walt Disney’s “Disneyland” developed). An excerpt from one is pictured above, with the stagecoaches and wilderness trails clearly part of the plans (Marvin Aubrey Davis’ Plot Plan even labeled “Canastoga Road” and “Stage Coach Rd.,” implying separate trails for the vehicles). By this time, some of the vehicles of this attraction were briefly referred to as “Yellowstone Stagecoaches.”\n\nBut, what scenery lay in store for passengers of the Stage Coaches? It seems that many elements of drawings produced for the 11-acre Burbank plot were retained. Proving this is an early form of (what would come go be known as) the “Disneyland Prospectus” [prepared in 1953 for Disneyland Inc. by WED Enterprises], which reads : “Frontier Country….where the Stagecoach meets the TRAIN and the RIVERBOAT for its trip down the river to New Orleans…Ride shotgun on the STAGE COACHES…past GRANNY’S FARM, a practical working farm operated with real live miniature horses, cows, oxen, and donkeys…through the pine forest, fording streams into Indian country and through the Painted Desert.”\n\n“The Painted Desert” (the name used to identify this region during 1955), appeared on the “Proposed Diagramatic Layout of Disneyland” (Marvin A. Davis’ plot plan, produced for WED Enterprises, by September 12, 1953) that was shown to potential investors as early as 1953. According to “Disneyland” (prepared for Disneyland Inc. by WED Enterprises, 1953), “Ride shotgun Stage Coaches…past Granny’s Farm, a practical working farm operated with real live miniature horses, cows, oxen, and donkeys…through the pine forest, fording streams into Indian country and through the Painted Desert.” However, it seems (as depicted in the drawings) that it was only meant to be traversed and explored by way of a Stagecoach or Mule Train. The “The Disneyland Story” describes the scenery of the “Painted Desert” this way : “As you go into the Painted Desert you will pass the Indian encampment, go through a Pine Forest, and Ford a stream. When you get to the Painted Desert you will see the things you usually find there, such as the beautiful cactus plants, trees, probably the water hole with the ‘poison sign’, the skeleton of a steer, and other appropriate dressings of the desert. As well as the stage coach ride, you will be able to take the Conestoga Wagon and Mule Pack ride into the Painted Desert.” Later, another early document describing Walt Disney’s Disneyland included that of a “Stage Coach Ride.” So it seems (at least for a brief period), that the Conestoga Wagon (and not a Mine Train or Stage Coaches) were considered as options to explore the highroads and byroads of the Painted Desert in Frontierland.\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Walt wrote his sister Ruth Beecher: “Our DISNEYLAND project is getting nearer an actuality all the time and I'm anxiously awaiting the time when it does get under way. In the meantime we are gathering up all sorts of things for our exhibits. We have… about thirty miniature ponies that we keep out on the back end of the studio lot, with most of the mares in foal. Then there are three stage coaches that we made here at the studio - they're real beauties, painted in bright red, with gold trimmings. We're all very excited about this project and feel It will be a wonderful thing for everybody.”\n\nFrank Pfannenstiel recalled how Walt was preparing to ride one of his horses when he received important news: “I was getting Walt's horse saddled, when Roy came over and put an arm around Walt, saying, ‘I’ve got the money, let's go to work.” By September 16, 1954, Walt excitedly wrote to his sister Ruth Beecher in Portland, Oregon, briefly describing Frontierland and its stage coaches and “prairie schooners” (another term for Conestoga wagons): “We are very busy here at the studio, what with the television program and getting our DISNEYLAND Park under way, we’re knee-deep in work. The Park is scheduled to open in July of next year. It will be a miniature world’s fair idea. There will be trains, river boats, prairie schooners, fantastic rides, etc., etc… FRONTIERLAND… will be of the gold rush period, with Indians, Buffalo, Stage Coaches, etc.”\n\nSo while alternative modes of desert transportation were “on the drawing table,” the Disneyland Stage Lines Stage Coaches were perhaps the earliest of Disneyland’s attraction vehicles to be researched and developed. As aforementioned, their story actually begins in 1950, when Walt was toying with the idea of a “Mickey Mouse Park.” About this time (in 1951), a couple by the name of Owen and Dollie Pope (who had previously manufactured horse trailers in Fort Worth, Texas) was running an equestrian show at the Pan Pacific Auditorium (in Sacramento, California), and Disneyland production artist Harper Goff attended. Harper recommended their show to Walt, who was subsequently so impressed with the showmanship and their ponies that he arranged a meeting with the couple during the spring of 1951. The idea was to get their assistance with “putting together some livestock for his future park.” After some negotiation and throught, the Popes (Owen and Dolly) were ultimately persuaded by Walt Disney, under the offer that he give him room and board. So Owen and his wife Dolly were hired by Walt Disney. This happened on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in November of 1951 - four years before Disneyland opened its gate to the public.\n\nIt is important to note that the “Proposed Diagramatic Layout of Disneyland” (Marvin A. Davis’ plot plan, produced for WED Enterprises, by September 12, 1953) mentions three equestrian rides in “Frontier land” : (1) a “Pack Mule Ride”, (2) a “Stage Coach Road” for Stage Coaches, and (3) a “Pony Ride” next to a “Corral.” All of these massive projects necessitated Owen and Dollie living on the Walt Disney Studio Lot for the duration of their development. Both Owen and Dollie supervised the fabrication and built the original four (what would become to be known as) the Disneyland Stage Lines Stage Coaches during 1954. The three “80 percent” scaled-down stage coaches (named after the states of California, Arizona, and Colorado), were designed and developed to be drawn by a “six pony hitch” of a miniature breed of midget horses, ponies, and Sardinian Donkeys.\n\n“Breeding and Training Stock”\n\nNow it has been said that “a cowboy needs a horse.” To meet this need, Owen and Dollie also oversaw the breeding, care, and training of these animals, most of which were intended for “Frontier Land, which is Disney’s favorite section of the fair,” according to Loius Berg (Reporter for “This Week Magazine”)! Louis Berg had the privilege to tour the Walt Disney Studio “stud farm” late in 1954, when he divulged : “I visited the stud farm where the midget horses, ponies, and Sardinian donkeys that will draw the wagons, carts and surreys are being nursed. And it’s a sight in this world to watch the tiny foals nuzzling up to mothers themselves no bigger than a normal foal. Disney knows every colt and every pony by name, and can tell you the characteristics of each of the several hundred animals : one likes to chew on cigarettes, another is a brat. ‘Get away, General,’ he said to a young colt that was biting his trouser leg affectionately.” While many of the other 5/8-scale ponies would become known to Park visitors at the time of their big debut to the public during Disneyland’s Opening day Parade, one (often famously seen pictured with Walt Disney) was born at the studio. “‘We call him ‘General George’ because he was born on George Washington’s birthday,’ Disney explained,” to Louis Berg. Herb Ryman [in “Work With Walt” by Don Peri] recalled how Walt “loved the the little animals - the little horses, ponies, and mules.” You may have seen a few images of Walt welcoming the new arrivals - foals, colts and fillies born at the studio during this era. As a sidelight, Walt even rode horse in one of Disneyland’s parades alongside Davy Crockett. Columnist Louis Berg continues : “Incidentally the pony corral is the favorite of Disney employees and their children. Most constant visitor is ‘Bunky’ Thompson, receptionist, who spends lunch hours feeding the animals.”\n\nAn insert which accompanied area newspapers mentioned how “Disneyland stables were turned into a nursery tem-porarily, with nine mares expecting the stork before Disneyland's opening day, and five colts having arrived after the move to Anaheim from the Burbank stables. More than 200 ponies are working in the park.”\n\nIn addition to feeding, the equine were trained. Van Arsdale France once wrote: “He [that is, Owen] was worried about the horses ‘spooking’ with all the sights and sounds of Disneyland. So, a recording of sounds from arcades and shooting galleries, and yelling kids made up. This was used as an audio aid for horse training. Since the horses were not directly on the payroll, they had to be carried as assets. All were given names. They all received names of people in accounting. Lucy Cotton, for example had a mule on the records named, ‘Lucy Mule.’”\n\nConcord Stage Coaches were not commonplace in the typical society of 1951. After “Museum authorities devoted their knowledge and skill to the accurate reproduction Conestoga wagons, Concord stages, [and] Western Buckboards,” it was deemed a requirement that certain arts and crafts were resurrected in order to fabricate the hubs, wheels, thoroughbraces, and other parts. One of the main crafts that was revived, was that of the wheelwright - the art of making wheels like the pioneers of frontier America! Studio Craftsmen had to heat the metal rim to the exact temperature, then fit and cool it, without scorching the wood. “Because of the great number of guests carried, the wheels are more sturdy than those on most of the catalogue models - another safety factor built into the attraction”, states one Disneyland Operation Manual. As a final touch, small details like the pin-striping on the wheels and stenciled letters were completed on the Walt Disney Studio backlot, by sign painters. According to Park historians : “One of the artists working on the coaches took issue with Walt about all those details. ‘People aren’t going to get this. It’s too much perfection,’ the artist said. With his disapproving eyebrow raised, Walt responded, ‘‘Yes they will. They will feel good about it. And they will understand it’s all done for them.’”\n\n“In 1954, Day Sechler [sic] went to the STUDIO, where he helped Owen Pope make street cars, surreys, stage coaches and even a fire engine.”\n\nCharley Brock recalled: “I had an older brother who was helping to build Disneyland and the Mark Twain. One day he came to see me and said that there was goin' to be a lot of horses at Disneyland. He told me to put on a clean shirt and overalls, and come with him. I saw Owen Pope and started workin' in the barn, gettin' horses and stage coaches ready.”\n\nWalt was personally interested and involved in his Stagecoaches. About this time Louis Berg (of This Week Magazine published for September 19, 1954) wrote: “And into this dreamland, Disney has already escaped. If you want to see him nowadays, don't look for him in his office. Seek him out in the workshops. Like as not, he'll be polishing a wagon tongue for one of the stage coaches… In the carpenter shop, Owen Pope one of the last great wagon builders, was putting the finishing touches on a stagecoach - there will he four of them - scaled down 80 per cent from the Deadwood model.”\n\n“Stagecoach Roads Construction and Landscaping”\n\nFortunately, Disneyland was constructed with enough space for the expansive area that would become Frontierland. As to the “greenscape,” it began to take form when Bill Evans helped save a number of orange trees along the route of the Conestoga Wagons, according to “Creating the Disney Landscape - An Interview with Bill Evans,” published in The “E” Ticket, Spring 1966. Walt continued to oversee the progress of the other Stage Coaches, according to Look Magazine (November of 1954). “As construction progresses on the Park, no detail is too picayune for Walt Disney’s attention. He bobs in and out of the workshops almost every day to check on the accuracy of the scaled- down stage coaches.” Walt also drive a jeep (at least on one occasion, as it “bounced over a stagecoach trail which will lead through the Painted Desert and along a river,” (according to one construction-era Bob Thomas article). Meanwhile, the finishing “natural” touches were being added to Disneyland’s own true-life desert, in Anaheim, California. Even before Disneyland opened, Walt’s friend (and Hollywood columnist) Hedda Hopper divulged, “Had a sneak preview of Disneyland…It was the planting that awed me. Walt bought $400,000 worth of trees and shrubs ; he depleted our nurseries and is now importing trees from Santa Barbara and San Diego. Cactus from Arizona already dots Disney’s painted desert”. [“Disneyland Park Found as Fantastic as Its Creator”, Published in “Looking at Hollywood”, May 22, 1955]. As for the outcome, the author of “Disneyland World of Flowers” reminisced about the greenscape: “If you were an early visitor to Disneyland you will recall a stage coach and Conestoga wagon ride that departed from this same area and carried the traveler through pine-covered country, a sun-baked desert, and back along the tree-lined river shore.”\n\nAll of this work was performed by the team of Jack and Bill Evans, under the direction of female architect and landscaper Ruth Shellhorn (to whom much of the Park’s original plant and tree selection is credited). This early piece of artwork (pictured above) was included inside the Disneyland Musical Map by Mattel - a mail-away preview of Walt Disney’s Disneyland, and perhaps one of the first pieces of licensed Disneyland merchandise. Those who purchased this c. 1954-1955 Disneyland promotional item could view the many roads (fit for wagons) coursing through the hills and desert of Frontierland’s Painted Desert!\n\nAs of June 2, 1955, C.V. Wood Jr. sent an Inter-Office Memorandum to Walt Disney regarding the best estimates that could be obtained at the time regarding the completion status of individual sections of the Park and Opening Day. C.V. wrote: “Wagon Rides: Okay. We still need design decision regarding some of the things you will see on the ride.”\n\n*Some sources as the Disneyland Rides, Attractions & Attendance Report cite February 10th, 1960 (though it is unlikely, as Nature’s Wonderland was under construction).\n\nTimes were “a changing’” and soon, new features of the desert were added to maps. At a meeting of the Disneyland Merchant's Association (held January 25, 1956), a momentous announcement was made: “All horsedrawn vehicles in the Frontierland area will be shutdown for approximately two months, during the redesign and reconstruction of this area. This will be a whole new development to increase ride capacity. We are building a mountain to be called Rainbow Mountain. This will be seen from the River and the Mark Twain. The existing corral and Black smith Show will be the entrance to a new ‘Mine Train’ ride. This will be an old fashioned Mining Train with 6 open cars. The engine will look like a real engine. The ride will go through a canyon out into the desert; then into a Rinbow Mountain where you tunnell with stalagmites and stalactities and three different water falls of different colors, joining in the river. This ride will take about 6 minutes…Stage Coach Rides route will be changed and we will add three new Stage Coaches.”\n\nOther vehicles also started offering an alternate view of what was now billed as the “Rainbow Desert” (formerly the Painted Desert) beginning in 1956. The Disneyland Stage Lines Stage Coaches would embark from a cross-roads for all sorts of desert explorational vehicles - the new little mining town of Rainbow Ridge! Only now, the Disneyland Stage Lines Stage Coaches (also referred to as the “Yellowstone Stage Coaches”) would be renamed as the Rainbow Mountain Stagecoaches, and would soon be replaced by three Mud Wagons, or Buckboards - No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 (intended to be pulled by a four-pony hitch). Once completed a 1958 appraisal placed the old western stage coaches and Conestoga wagons at a value of $172,800 (ride structure) and $36,790 (equipment).\n\nThis proved the truth of Walt Disney’s promise of an ever-expanding Disneyland! These new modes of desert transportation were among some of the exciting attractions debuting during 1956, that increased ride capacity! Owing to this, one day in August saw a peak total of “197,547 individual rides” enjoyed by Guests (according to a letter from Walt to Ward Kimball, dated January 23, 1957).\n\nBy 1959, Joe Fowler was Vice President of Disneyland Operations Committee and Doc Lemmon of Disneyland Operations was overseeing Operators of Rides & Amusements (like the Conestoga Wagon and Rainbow Mountain Mud Wagon Coaches), Livestock, Parking Lot, and Ticket Sellers. By that time, Disneyland Admission media “C” Coupons (above) equated the value of a ride aboard the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train with the alternate desert route of the Conestoga Wagons.\n\n“Incidents & Liability”\n\nOwing to incidents, by September of 1958, Disneyland, Inc. had a liability - a Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance Policy valued at $ $80,250 (according to an appraisal by Bank of America). By 1959, Disneyland, Inc. had many more types of insurance policies. Disneyland, Inc. had “liability property damage” at coverage of $500,000 per person and $2,000,000 per incident, $500,000 on property and $2,000,000 on aggregate products, at an annual premium of $165,957. Disneyland, Inc. had also increased its “multiple perils” insurance policy coverage twice; from a coverage of $6,000,000 for 5 years, increased by 3,700,000 for 4 years, and increased by 490,000 for 3 years. After all, the policy had a coverage of $10,190,000 at an annual premium of $9,717. Despite the coverage, incidents would occur that would result in the end of an era for the Disneyland stage coach and its route!\n\nDay Sechler recalled: “We were loadin' a stage coach one time when we looked up and people were hollerin' and yellin' from the MARK TWAIN, pointin' at a stage coach with four ponies on the dead run- and NO DRIVER! They ran into a coach that was loading and turned it clear over on its side - with JIM LINDSEY UNDERNEATH!”\n\nDay Sechler also recalled: “Another time, a coach turned over with 17 people when a shot of steam from the train scared the ponies at Rainbow Bridge. A safety device released the coach from the front wheels. It sure was a sight to see the ponies come racing home draggin' only the 2 front wheels!”\n\nAccording to a related newspaper headline (published just after the latter incident), “Eleven [were] injured as horses bolted at Disneyland.” The same article continues : “Eleven persons including six children, suffered minor injuries Monday at Disneyland when the four-horse team of a stagecoach bolted. The injured were the driver and 10 of the 12 passengers in the stagecoach at the amusement park. Several were thrown to the ground when the stagecoach collapsed after its undercarriage was torn off by the wild horses. A Disneyland spokesman said the horses became frightened at the sound of the Park’s train whistle.”\n\nMilo Rainey recalled: “Sometimes runaways would be caused by ducks flying across the river.\"\n\nA few months later, another article (by Bob Thomas of the Associated Press) divulged Walt’s thoughts over what had occurred. “‘We had stagecoaches riding through the Painted Desert area’, he explained. And we had a few minor accidents on them. Nothing serious, but enough to worry me. We have a fine safety record at the Park, and I wanted to keep it that way. So I redid the desert to do away with the stagecoaches.”\n\nThis decision may not have been easy for Walt. Years later (in 1973) an interview with Joe Fowler perhaps revealed Walt’s feelings over the stagecoaches going “101”: “You know, I could go on for hours with the great understanding that man had and the things he loved and the way that he recognized that he had to make compromises. One of the things he loved, I guess, more than anything else was the stagecoaches that we had, the six horses in Frontierland. Well, we had three accidents. The damn thing was top-heavy where we'd put the people on top of the coach as well as inside. Of course, a horse is the one thing that, as Owen Pope will tell you, you can't predict. He may go along three hundred days and then suddenly bang! He shies at some damn thing. And it was a problem with these horses. We'd had three accidents and fortunately no injuries, but there might have been people killed. I went to Walt and I said, ‘Walt, I'm sorry but we just have to take the people off the top of the stagecoaches or we’re going to have an accident. We've had three near ones!’ Walt said, ‘Oh, Joe, if we don't have the people on top of the coaches, it's no show. Besides the damn horses are gettin’ their heads off. Let's discontinue it and have the mule ride,’ which we did. But I knew him well enough by that time to know what it cost him.”\n\nIt may as well be a “Safe ‘D’ Fact” that if an attraction at the Park proves to be dangerous, the problem is corrected or the attraction is eliminated. Dangerous attractions just aren’t “Good Show” as they do not support a positive Disney image. So, the stagecoaches would experience a “Show Failure” situation and go “101.” After three tip overs, Walt Disney got rid of the ride.\n\nAccording to “THE DISNEY THEME SHOW - an introduction to the art of Disney outdoor entertainment: Volume II”: Of all the guests’ senses that come into play at Disneyland, the most difficult response to predict was taste. If 70,000 guests were to arrive on a single day, there would probably be 70,000 different ideas about food. Generally speaking, Disneyland food locations fall into three categories - sit-down restaurant service, “buffeteria,” and fast-food categories. The most extensive theming has always been found in the sit-down restaurant locations but all locations were housed in authentically motified facilities.\n\nThe Space Bar was to be the first West Coast version of the automat (a common type of dining experience in New York during the 50s and 60s), with a catch - guests would dine in the futuristic year of 1986. Both Herb Ryman and Gabriel Scognamillo created many concepts (rough layouts, elevations, and artistic drawings) which contributed to the final design of the “futuristic” automat. [Some of these designs were refined and published later on July 15, 1955, as a supplement for the “Register” of Santa Ana, California.]\n\nMeanwhile (in 1954), Walt was searching for participants to lease shop and restaurant spaces at Disneyland, and help generate the necessary capital to fund construction of Disneyland. In a synergistic relationship, the companies (in turn) could sell their products and advertise their corporate names in the Park. Several “reliable old firms” sponsored the “abundance of restaurants devoted to pleasing all tastes and all budgets,” according to “The Story of Disneyland”, published 1955. “55er” Rima Bruce (who started with Jim D'Arcy in Food when all food was Lessee and typed memos and menus) recalled that “the phone never stopped ringing with everybody trying to get a food lease in the Park.“\n\nBy October 195, 34.48% of Disneyland Inc. stock was owned by American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc.\n\nBy July of 1954, Raul Grizante of Disneyland, Inc. was overseeing food philosophy, area & location, food specialties, and beverages for Disneyland. This colorful quick service pavilion would be both partially designed and operated by UPT Concessions Inc. a subsidiary of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters Inc. Food service equipment was provided by Coast Distributing Company of Los Angeles (who ran a “Congratulations” message to Walt Disney and Staff in “The Disneyland News,” Vol. 1, No.2 ; August 10, 1955). “55er” Marion Schawacha recalled: “one day I put in an application and I saw Chet Miller with the U.P.T. We were taken around the property, climbing over piles of lumber, as projects were pointed out. On the first of June, I went to the Space Bar, doing everything… stocking the shelves and getting set up for hamburgers. chicken pot pies, tuna burgers, chili beans.”\n\nSome of these viable project Concepts (as seen above), were supported by a well-developed business case and built expectation.\n\nDisneyland, Inc. continued to team with the Participant sponsor to develop the attraction. As late as May 25, 1955, “ABC’s Automat type restaurant… was [sic] changed from Autosnak to Stratosnak,” according to one official and authorized “Disneyland Information & Nomenclature List” (prepared by Bill Cottrell of Disneyland Inc., by May 25, 1955). It was estimated that the Stratosnak Space Bar would have the capacity to serve 800 guests per hour. With that, the Space Bar would become one of Disneyland’s eating facilities which was predicted to contribute to accommodating “15,000 persons daily, hitting a peak of 60,000 on holidays and week-ends…” and one of “twenty restaurants and snack bars, capable of saving 8,000 hourly,” at least according to “Building A Dream” (prepared by the Disneyland, Inc. Public Relations Department).\n\nAs of June 2, 1955, C.V. Wood Jr. sent an Inter-Office Memorandum to Walt Disney regarding the best estimates that could be obtained at the time regarding the completion status of individual sections of the Park and Opening Day. C.V. wrote: “Stratosnack: Will be completed.”\n\n“55er” Dean Penlick was a Chef Manager in a very successful Beverly Hills Restaurant when it was purchased by the American Broadcasting Company. Then UPT was the Lessee for all fast foods in Disneyland, and brought Dean to Disneyland as a food consultant.\n\n“55er” Marion Schawacha recalled opening day: “The waiting lines were all mixed up and criss-crossing each other. The line from Autopia would end up at the Space Bar, and vice versa. All you could see in Tomorrowland was PEOPLE!”Beginning in July of 1955, a variety of food and refreshments were available! Guests could order soft drinks (Root Beer, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Orange Drink), salads, sandwiches (hamburgers, hot dogs), desert (pastry and pie), Coffee and candy. Carnation Farms would also serve this and 14 other wholesale customers who operated restaurants and snack bars in Disneyland.\n\nDean Penlick recalled: “I was working in Tomorrowland at a food facility that was an automat. It was all vending machines. This operation would take in many thousands of dollars a day in coin… but we were too busy to count the coins. So we worked up a formula where we weighed the coins and used that weight as a basis for our deposits.”\n\nA few Disneylanders fulfilled a starting role at the Space Bar, like Terry Carnes.\n\nEarly concepts featured four “tracks” (some of which wove inside and outside of the Show Building), complete with “soaring spires” (borrowing some style from Herb Ryman’s c.1964 “suggestions” for the New Tomorrowland). About the years 1965 to 1966, the job of “Space Ride R & D” (No. 034-53-22) was opened at WED Enterprises, Inc. Project 034-53-22 was described as Research & Design of a “Matterhorn-type ride with a structure housing four separate loading areas and ride tracks.”\n\nAccording to “Progressland at Disneyland: a proposal for the General Electric Company from Walt Disney Productions” ©1965: “The word for 1967 is Tomorrowland -a New Tomorrowland. When the present Tomorrowland was designed, in the early 1950's, Early Bird, Gemini and Apollo were space age terms of the distant future. Even the household word ‘astronaut’ was still to be coined. Times-and-tomorrows have changed. So recently Walt Disney and his creative staff have taken a new look at the Tomorrowland area. To research ideas. Walt and his team visited Houston, Huntsville and Cape Kenne"
