        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nLOIS & CLARK actor Dean Cain opened up about his experience as a Christian in the entertainment industry and why he stands up for what he believes.\n\n“I think [being a Christian] is frowned upon in Hollywood. It’s like, you know, I even tell people if I were a young actor just beginning, I’d probably keep my mouth shut,” Cain told The Washington Times. “I’ll work with anybody I disagree politically with, you know, Rob Reiner and De Niro and guys like that, I’d work with them in a heartbeat. They’re extremely talented filmmakers and people. I think that’s vibrancy, that’s vibrant; when you have people who can disagree and have a conversation, that’s always the answer. More speech, not less speech.”\n\n“But there are a lot of people who just won’t [work with people they disagree with]. It gets tribalized so much in Hollywood and people just don’t want to work with somebody,” he continued. “They [won’t] consider me because I’ll talk about being a Christian, and they’ll say, ‘Gosh, I can’t have him on the set because he’ll cause trouble.’ I’m like, ‘What? You ain’t gonna get trouble from me. You know, [if] you ask for an opinion, I’ll give you an opinion,’ but, I mean, it’s just an odd thing. And so, people like to stay in their echo chambers.”\n\n“I certainly march by a different drum than a lot of folks in Hollywood, and I’m open about it,” he told Liberty University students in 2019. “I’m happy to have a conversation with anybody on anything, whether we agree or not. I think that is one of the things that is missing so much in today’s political climate.”\n\nCain is no stranger to controversy for standing strong for his faith and standing for truth. However, he believes it is his responsibility to be a light in the darkness and not allow himself to be bullied into submission.\n\n“One way for evil to prevail is for good men to stand around and do nothing. Well, at this point in time in my life and my career, I have to speak up because it’s common sense, it’s right and wrong, and if that hurts me in my business or my life, well, then there’s no sense in this world,” he said. “And so I have to speak up.”\n\nThe actor also believes that the lack of discourse is a large problem in America. For people to find the truth, they need to be faced with more than one opinion or idea. However, those speaking out against culture are mocked and shut down, leaving no room for growth.\n\n“People just need to be educated, and they’re not being educated correctly, and I’m not quite sure what the agenda is…but that’s why I speak up, because these words need to be heard,” Cain explained. “I want my voice to speak for truth.”\n\nOne way he’s stood up for truth is through faith-based movies.\n\n“You don’t find a whole lot of [Christian faith], certainly not openly, in Hollywood,” the actor said. “That’s why I make all of the faith-based films that I make, because I want those messages out there…I think those movies are really important.”\n\nCain has long stood for the truth, and it is encouraging to see him continue to stand for what is right no matter the backlash he faces.\n\nMovieguide® previously reported:\n\nDean Cain, known for his television role as Superman in LOIS & CLARK, blasted the DC Comics’ decision to make the character bisexual.\n\nIn the comics, John Kent, son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, is now Superman.\n\n“They said it’s a bold new direction. I say they’re bandwagoning,” Cain said.\n\n“Why don’t they have him fight the injustices that created the refugees whose deportation he’s protesting? That would be brave, I’d read that,” Cain added. “Or fighting for the rights of women to attend school and work and live and boys not to be raped by men under the new warm and fuzzy Taliban.”\n\nCain previously condemned the “woke” politically correct culture affecting comics today, including a gay Captain America."
