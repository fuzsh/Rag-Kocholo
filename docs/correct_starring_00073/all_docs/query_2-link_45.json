Soon after his birth, he moved with his mother and older brother to Los Angeles. There, in 1969, his mother married filmmaker Christopher Cain, who adopted Dean and his brother.

Cain graduated in 1988 with a BA in history.\n\nUpon his graduation, Cain signed as a free agent with the NFL's Buffalo Bills. However, a knee injury ended his football career early.

Following this success, Cain was in a number of television movies, including \"Rag and Bone,\" \"Futuresport,\" and \"Dogboys.\" In 1999, he began hosting \"Ripley's Believe it or Not!,\" based on the famous newspaper feature. Many television films followed in the early 2000s, including \"The Runaway,\" \"Gentle Ben,\" \"The Glow,\" and \"Dragon Fighter.\" From 2003 to 2004, Cain appeared in eight episodes of the police procedural series \"The Division.\" A little later, he was in 11 episodes of the drama series \"Clubhouse.\" Among his other credits are \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" \"Smallville,\" \"Las Vegas,\" and \"Burn Notice.\" In 2012, Cain began hosting the series \"Bloopers,\" and in 2013, started a main role on the VH1 sports drama \"Hit the Floor,\" originally called \"Bounce.\"\n\nCain has also been a contestant on some reality game shows, including \"Stars Earn Stripes\" and \"The Choice.\" Since 2014, he has served as the host of the magic show \"Masters of Illusion.\" From 2015 to 2017, he appeared as Jeremiah Danvers in seven episodes of the series \"Supergirl,\" and in 2016, was in six episodes of the Netflix series \"Lady Dynamite.\" Dean is also known for his many Christmas-themed television movies; among them are \"A Christmas Wedding,\" \"The Dog Who Saved Christmas,\" \"The Case for Christmas,\" and \"Good Morning Christmas.\"\n\nFilm Career\n\nCain made his feature film debut in the 1976 film \"Elmer.\" Later, in 1984, he had a significant supporting role in his father's film \"The Stone Boy,\" costarring Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Linda Hamilton. Cain's next major role came over a decade later in 1997's \"Best Men,\" a crime comedy with Luke Wilson, Andy Dick, and Drew Barrymore. This was followed by \"The Broken Hearts Club,\" in which Cain played a member of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood.

In the early 90s, he went out with volleyball player and model Gabrielle Reece. Later, Cain got engaged to singer Mindy McCready, before separating the next year. With another ex-girlfriend, Spanish model Samantha Torres, Cain has a son named Christopher.\n\nA registered Republican, Dean supported John McCain in the 2008 election, Rick Perry in 2012, and Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Cain has drawn much negative attention for these endorsements, particularly the latter. He has appeared on numerous conservative outlets, including Fox News, and has made many inappropriate comments on Twitter, including one about physically assaulting a 17-year-old protester.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1997, at the peak of his fame, Dean paid $725,000 for a 35-acre property in a Colorado town called Basalt, located roughly 30 minutes from Aspen. He proceeded to construct a handful of structures on the land, including a 4,400 square-foot luxury cabin. Dean attempted to offload this home in 2011 for $9.5 million. He withdrew the listing then re-listed in 2015 for $5.5 million. He ultimately accepted $3.6 million in December 2015.\n\nIn 2004 Dean paid $2.6 million for a home on a bluff overlooking the ocean in Malibu. In March 2023 Dean listed his Malibu mansion for $7.25 million. Dean sold this home in May 2023 for $6.25 million.
