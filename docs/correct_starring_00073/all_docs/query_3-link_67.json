        "text": "\"Superman has a defect. He has a chink in his armor. Superman has morals. He has ethics. He is unrelentingly good. Because of that, I will win.\"\n\nJohn Shea was born April 14, 1949 in North Conway, New Hampshire. He began his career acting on stage, before making the transition to television with \"The Nativity\" in 1978. His first film role was in \"Hussy\" in 1980. In 1988, John won an emmy for his role in the 1988 miniseries \"Baby M.\"\n\nIn 1993 John Shea joined the cast of \"Lois & Clark,\" with his portrayal of the villainous Lex Luthor. Lex provided a constant foil for Superman throughout the entire first season of the series, and John brought his own unique style and charm to the role made famous by Gene Hackman in the Superman films of the 70's and 80's.\n\n\"I don't think there has been a character quite like this, Shea said in a 1994 appearance at the Museum of Television and Radio. \"This villain is written as a human being, and not just a one dimensional comic villain or a two dimensional comic villain, the way he might have been portrayed in the comic books or even other films. I thought Gene Hackman was brilliant, but it was a different kind of comic villain.\"\n\nBy the end of the first season, the commute that the part required became a drain on Shea. The series shot in LA, and Shea had to fly from his home in New York every week to film his scenes. When his contract was up at the end of the season, Shea chose not to return as a regular cast member. However, it seemed that he had a hard time staying away from the role of the crafty Mr. Luthor... he returned as a guest star for one episode in the second season and two episodes in the third season.\n\nAfter leaving L&C, Shea returned to the stage, appearing in Broadway and off-Broadway shows for several years. He also co-wrote, directed and acted in the dramatic independent film \"Southie.\" Shea also spent several years playing the role of Adam on the popular science fiction series \"Mutant X.\""
