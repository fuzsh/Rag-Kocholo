        "text": "What Disney movie came out the year you were born? Was it an absolute classic like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, or a total flop like The Black Cauldron? Here are all of the top animated Disney movies by year from 1937 to 2005. For the years that Disney did not release an animated movie, there is a live action substitute.\n\nIt will be fun to see which animated Disney movie was made the year you were born. Along with that basic information, you may be totally surprised to find out a few interesting Disney movie facts. Did you know that the now-classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty was initially such a major box office loss that it nearly wiped out the entire animated movie division at Disney? How about the fact that movies like Toy Story and Beauty and the Beast would probably never have been made if not for the success of 101 Dalmations in 1961? That movie may just be the most important Disney film ever produced.\n\nDoes your birth year fall during the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s? What was the Disney movie the year you were born? Read on to find out."
