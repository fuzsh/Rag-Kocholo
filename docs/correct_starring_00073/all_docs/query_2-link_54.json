        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nIn a recent interview with Alabama Life & Culture, LOIS & CLARK actor Dean Cain shared his journey of faith.\n\n“I always believed there was a God,” Cain began. “My family wasn’t a bunch of church-going, everyday, on Sunday. We’d go three times a year. We’d be there on Easter. We’d be there on Christmas Eve. We’d be there one other time, two other times a year.”\n\nCain shared the moment his faith became real to him.\n\n“When I got to college, I went to Princeton, as you know, I figured I would find my faith and get a lot of the answers that I was looking for,” Cain said. “Because we’re always looking for answers. People aren’t always sure. I studied the world religions. I thought I’d get some answers. It just raised more questions. I would go back and forth in my journey of faith. Every journey is unique. We all have very unique experiences.”\n\n“Where I really found faith was becoming a parent,” he admitted. “When my son was born, just witnessing the miracle of birth, and then all of a sudden there’s this person on the planet that I care about more than myself. I would gladly die before anything happened. I would step in front of a bullet, in front of a train, I would do anything to save this person rather than myself. That really got me. That changes your whole perspective.”\n\n“My faith really got stronger, much stronger, and I really had to face it and discuss it once I became a father,” Cain told Christian Headlines. “…I have to explain to him the world and the rules of the world and why we’re here.”\n\nIn fact, becoming a parent changed how Cain approached his career, and he began to take on more faith-based roles.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons I started doing that when my son was born. Then [when he] got a little bit older and was able to come on set with me and see things or watch my films, [he was] able to take away a positive, uplifting message,” he told the Christian Post.\n\n“My faith just gets stronger as I get older, the more I learn, the more I know and the more I understand, and the more I understand that some things aren’t understandable,” he continued. “That’s really been my journey. I’m really happy to go out and make as many faith-based films as I can.”\n\nMovieguide® recently reported on Dean Cain:\n\nWhile many actors in Hollywood are skeptical of AI in the entertainment industry, LOIS & CLARK star Dean Cain is curious about how it will develop and if it will ever be commonly used in the entertainment industry.\n\n“AI is a weird thing,” Cain told Fox News Digital. “I look at someone like Elon Musk who know a lot more about it, and I think [there] would be some great uses for AI.”\n\nThe actor, however, who does not know much about the technology, is content with just playing around with the entry-level tools for now.\n\n“I[‘ve] got to check it out at some point and be like, ‘I want to write a script about a guy on vacation in Spain who meets the love of his life, but they can’t speak to each other because [they] speak different languages. Go,’ and just see what it does. And if it writes a script in, you know, 12 seconds or something, it’ll blow my mind away,” he said."
