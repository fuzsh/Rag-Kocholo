Mr. Brahm is known as the director of \"Broken Blossoms\" {English version), \"Penitentiary\" and the recently released \"Girls' School\". WHEN I directed my first film Broken Blossoms a few years ago in England I approached the work with a good deal of uncertainty as to how I should make out. Not only was I to direct a modern version of a famous silent picture, but also I had to make myself at home in an entirely new medium. I had never before studied the technique of the movie from in- side a studio. In twenty years as a stage producer in Vienna I never thought I would ever direct films. Still, as an interested member of the movie audience I had been familiar with mo- tion pictures for a long time. Even in the days when the Germans were making their most important silent films I was greatly interested in American productions. The German films, for all their importance, seemed to me too ponderous; too weighed down with their content and attempts to put something across. Whereas the American silent films had nothing of that : I admired from the first the fact that no matter how important or dramatic their subject, they never forgot to give it great entertainment value as well. Then, of course, there was the additional advantage of the skill with which they were put together and stripped of all superfluous material. On the whole, perhaps, I am one of those people who feel that the silent films were the best — what the highbrow fans would call \"the purest cinema.\" But I think the basis of the movie is the same today : you simply cannot get away from the fact that pictures, and not words or sounds, are the basis of the film. Sound and speech have simply added another element that can be of great assist- ance to the director. We find a rather similar use in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony — there, in his last movement, he decided that musical instruments were inadequate to his purpose and suddenly introduced the human voice. This, I feel, should be the attitude of the film director; he should look upon speech as something to be introduced only when the technique of the camera is in- adequate. Sometimes I have whole sequences in my films where there is no dialog at all. There is enough visual attraction for the audience to make words unnecessary. But if a di- rector is going to work on this principle he must plan his action and continuity with the greatest care. I am not one of those direc- tors who do very little planning before they shoot — who prefer to wait until the moment comes and then rely upon instinct or inspira- tion, or whatever you like to call it, to tell them what to do. I like to follow a blue- print all the way. This method was more or less forced on me when I made my first picture Broken Blossovis. As I have told you, I knew nothing about camera work, or how to set about making a picture, but I had orders to make one ! So I sat up night after night with the script girl, trying to get in advance a clear conception of what was to be done and to visualize everything down to the last detail. Since then I have found this method good for other reasons as w^ell. It makes the work go much more smoothly for every- body. When your sets are all down on paper — everj'thing from camera angles to dialog — there's no argtmient about anything. Both actors and director feel they are simply following a fixed plan: each scene has been worked out in relation to the type of char- acters and the mood of the moment, and to improvise would not only seem unnatural but would throw everything out of Hne. I don't want you to think that so much careful preparation means that the actors are strictly controlled ; trained in every movement and inflection. I am very much opposed to that kind of dictatorial behavior. Nothing is worse for an actor than to feel that his director is his boss. However care- ful I may be about plans and details, I never forget that my actors must be feeling com- fortable and confident. So I try to be as January^ ipjQ 5 casual as possible with them, and to give the impression that what is coming is something quite straightforward and simple ; that there is no cause for worry either for them or for me. If they feel that I am nervous and tense they will soon begin to feel the same way and all their naturalness Avill go. Of course the director must make it his job to see that eveiything that stands in the way of natural acting is eliminated. For instance, you often find that actors see the script for the first time when they go onto the set. This is not my way. I let them get on good terms with the script and re- hearse them thoroughly well in advance. A clear conception of character and mood is essential to the actor as well as to the di- rector. And for the same reason I am very careful about my sets. A set must always inspire the right mood both in me and in my players. If the scene is an intimate one, the set must give a feeling of intimacy by itself. The actors must feel its intimacy as soon as they walk on. Then all they have to do is behave naturally — just as they would in their o vn living-room, kitchen, garden, or wher- ever it is. This makes it all sound very easy, I know, but that is the feeling I try to arouse in the actors. You have probably heard people say that the camera is really the eyes of the audience, following everything that needs to be seen, nearer or farther from what it is looking at according to the dramatic or narrative emphasis the director is looking for. Natur- ally this makes it difficult for the actors not to be conscious of the camera. Everything m.ust be done in relation to the camera, and yet as if the camera were not there. The camera should help to bring into harmony all the important elements — rhythm, timing, mood, characters — and it should be made to do so in the most economical manner pos- sible. Otherwise the audiejice, without knowing why, will feel dissatisfied with the picture and may, quite wrongly, blame the stor}' or the actors, when actually it is simply the wrong treatment of the film as an entity that has made it unconvincing. Technique always gets in the way — you have to have the camera, but it is a terrible nuisance and must be used so no one is conscious of it; just as in listening to music you simply hear the music without being aware of the instrument behind. Apart from careful rehearsing and plenty of tact the important tiling is to have the sets and props so arranged that what the actor has to do is about the onl)- thing he ca)i do. Arrange things in such a way that it is almost impossible for him to step out of the camera line or make other obvious mis- takes. As a result the actors won't have to work hard to obey directions ; everytliing will come naturally from within them, and the more perfectly played a scene is, the more they will think that they are entirely responsible for it. But since I have spent the greater part of my life dealing with hu- man beings on the stage, I feel I can claim a good deal of the credit when things run smootlily. My experience has helped me tremendously in developing a certain sense of shownnanship and dramatic value, as well as in handling actors. The result is that harmony between the human and technical elements is made much simpler. I would also like to say a word or two about the part played by costumes in these matters. Hollywood is one of the fashion centers of the world, and consequently, every now and then, its actresses feel that they can't afford to look natural on the screen. So I make a point of supervising the costume work and the work of the hair- dresser, to make sure that a simple person- ality is not made too glamorous — or vice versa. This is very important, because nothing is more ruinous to the mood of a scene than a costume or coiffeur that is not in keeping with the character who wears it. I always insist on my own way in such matters — ^let the geese look like geese and not artificial swans. One point I would like to mention is one that is worrying for every director with initiative. When I was a stage producer in Vienna I produced every sort and kind of show, from classics to the French farce. But in Hollywood most film executives seem to think that if you make a good job of a murder story you must go on committing murder all your life. This is understandable in a way, because if they see that you bring in money with a certain type of story, why should they risk letting you tn,- something 6 National Board of Review Magazine quite different? I have been lucky in this respect; I have been fairly successful with different kinds of films, but before I was allowed to make Girls' School I had to sub- mit to a test, just as actors have to go through a test for a part. Although some directors may welcome it, I am strongly against limiting directors too strictly, be- cause I believe more in the way in which things are done 'than in the subject matter itself. Sometimes you will find, of course, that repetition of individuality is more tiresome than repetition of story. It seems to make all the stories look alike, no matter how different they may be in plot and content. But that is because the director is trying to make a picture about himself, instead of about the people in the story. As a director I, personally, find Holly- wood exactly the right atmosphere for film- making. But there is one point I'd like to bring up — one which I feel is a serious point of consideration. I believe the Hollywood companies keep their directors, producers and executives down there for over-long periods. Hollywood is a good place to be in, but it should not become a rut. A di- rector should not go for long stretches, as is sometimes the case, hardly ever seeing things and people outside the studios. If a person is to keep his mind fresh and recep- tive to the affairs of everyday life he should get away regularly and come in contact with the world. Otherwise he gets rusty, not only in regard to the very important things in life, but over small, daily matters in the business of living, and over the thousands of jobs and occupations that occupy the minds of people who are not living and breathing motion pictures all the time. The Foreign Film and Hollywood This is the summary of a radio discussion presented under the auspices of the yational Board over Neio York City's Station WNYC. In it. Mr. Jean Lenauer, Director of the Filmarte Theatre in New York City, replied to questions ty Mr. Frank S. Nugent, Film Editor of the Neu- York Times. THIS is a specially apt time to make a few comments on the position of the foreign film in relation to Hollywood. Not since the pre-talkie days has interest in foreign productions been so great. Last year the New York Times reviewed about six hundred pictures : two hundred and fifty of them came from abroad. The New York Film Critics' prize for the best foreign film has gone to France for two straight years : the 1936 prize-winner was \"Carnival in Flanders\" and the winner last year was \"IMayerling\". Both had their premieres at the Filmarte Theatre in New York. Recently there has been a good deal of controversy about foreign films versus Hol- lywood. When Sam Goldwyn returned from Europe last year, he said ; '\"The crisis for the American picture is here. Foreign studios threaten the supremacy of Holly- wood. . . .\" Now 'Sir. Goldwyn is a man of great prominence in the movie world, and as a precautionar}- measure I don't think I should disagree with him. At the same time I do not believe that Hollywood needs to fear foreign producers — not even the French, who have made great strides in the last few years. I question whether the aver- age American is interested in foreign films. I still feel their appeal is limited. When I say limited I don't mean limited to those who understand the language. I mean limited to those looking for the un- usual ; to those who will go off the beaten track for their entertainment. And I am not referring here to the so-called intelle- gentsia. The people who go to foreign films are not \"arty\", they are entertainment buy- ers. They want their money's worth. The proof of this is the fact that mediocre for- January, ipjp 7 eign films usually fail miserably in this country. I am sure there are people who would question strongly my contention that the ap- peal of the foreign film is limited. They would point to Carnival in Flanders, for in- stance, as an example of a foreign film which was put into the RKO circuit. But they would not know that this film remained little more than one day in the RKO theatres and was then withdrawn — despite the fact that it had run for fourteen weeks at the Filmarte. It is true that it played at several other theatres afterwards, but in Boston, for example, it was held for only three weeks, while an English-speaking film. Moonlight Sonata, was breaking records up there with a run of five months I And this despite the fact that Moonlight Sonata did not receive particularly good reviews. One can only explain such things by say- ing that it all boils down to the question of public taste. I think the average movie- goer is scared of a French picture — of any foreign picture. Once you get him over that mental handicap he is likely to do what some people did at the Filmarte when Carni- val was running — come back ten and twelve times ! Of course, this is an exceptional case and the only other foreign picture with a comparable record is Mayerling. Yet the receipts drawn by Mayerling from all over the country would be considered insignificant as against the box-office returns of a picture like Alexander's Ragtime Band. Taking all in all, however, I don't think people are as scared of foreign-language films as they were a few years ago. There is not the same prejudice, and I think May- erling has been a great factor in reducing it. Not because the public overcame their prejudice suddenly, but because Charles Boyer was in it and he is a star who has become quite well-known to American audi- ences through his work in Hollywood. Be- cause of Boyer, many people went to see it under the impression that it was an Ameri- can film. Most of them liked it. But I am sure they would never have ventured in had they known the film was in French with English subtitles. Here, I think, lies the solution for over- coming the hazard of a foreign language. It is a solution that lies not in the language but in the stars. This sounds as though I meant to cast a horoscope, but the stars I mean are strictly earthbound. We must realize that American pictures are popular in France largely because the American film stars are so well known there. Garbo, Crawford and Cooper are as widely-pubHcized in France as they are here, and are just as popular as the home talent. The same would be true in this country if French stars were publicized on a wide scale. Let me add quickly that I am not propos- ing that the French bombard us with bally- hoo about their Shirley Temples and Clark Gables 1 That would be like bringing nuts to Brazil. All I mean is that American audiences would be, not more receptive to, but more eager to meet foreign films if they knew a little more about the players. Of course if you go through a list of French stars you will find a number besides Bo} er, who are quite well-known over here. There is Danielle Darrieux, Annabella, Fernand Gravet, Simone Simon, Hedy Lamarr and one or two others. But their names are known only because they have worked in Hollywood : none of them was widely known to the general audience before, even though they all had appeared in several foreign pictures. In fact, one of the very few French actors who has a reputation here although he has never been to this country, is Harry Baur. He is the notable exception to the rule. In France the M^hole publicity set-up is very different to what it is here. French stars are not ballyhooed nearly as much as Hollywood players are for the reason that a French star is never signed for long terms. He is signed for just one picture. When that is completed he has to sign a new con- tract— usually with a new producer. Con- sequently no star receives the extensive pub- licity build-up the Hollywood glamour boy or girl gets. This, in turn, cuts down the fan-public tremendously. I'd say that for every ten thousand American fans there are ten French ! And, incidentally, a French star's private life is private. There's none of this petty gossip about who has who's little golden key. . . . And another thing that would seem strange here is the fact that 8 National Board of Review Magazine in France directors are as papular as stars. Men like Renoir, Duvivier and Guitry get equal billing with the plaj-ers. Their names mean something at the box-office. There are other, more fundamental differ- ences I should like to mention. I have al- ready noted that Harry Baur is about the only French star outside Hollywood who is known for his French record. This may strike you as strange, since Baur is a char- acter actor, not a romantic type at all. But in France the public doesn't insist on having romantic stars. Or, at least, it doesn't see why middle-aged men and women are neces- sarily unromantic. If France doesn't actu- ally practice the doctrine \"Life Begins at Forty\", at least it pretends that life doesn't end at 25 — as one is led to believe by Holly- wood. A glance at a list of France's most noted stars will show you this : Raimu, Francoise Rosay, Jean Gabin, Louis Jouvet, Sacha Guitry, Eric von Stroheim (we count him a French star now — after Hollywood is through with him) — all these are well out of the juvenile class. I remember when Carnival in Flanders was shown to a group of film executives at a preview in New York. They thought it was a good picture, but said it wouldn't attract a corporal's guard in this country. There were no young people in it — not in the major roles, anyway. The executives were amazed that the romantic lead should be given to a matron like Fran- coise Rosay. But let us return to our original point, the question of the popularity of foreign films. Can we say that they will ever again be as popular as they were before the talkies — when an actor could be equally eloquent, without saying a word, in German, French, Italian and English? Personally, for all their increasing popu- larity, I don't believe foreign pictures could ever have the appeal of the Hollywood product. And there is more to this than the mere language question. Hollywood delib- erately sets out to make pictures of broad general appeal ; films that are calculated to be as entertaining in Timbuctoo as they are in Hoboken. But in France, for example, a picture is made for the French. If it hap- pens to please an English, French, Italian or American movie-goer, it is purely an ac- cident— an unintentionally lucky thing for the producer. Naturally this raises the question of which method is the right one? Should Hollywood, for example, set out to make pictures for Americans only? From the economic view there is something to be said for this. Pic- tures could be made more cheaply if they were intended for the domestic market. In most cases Hollywood producers work with one eye on home and the other abroad. In order to recover the money spent on a film like Marie Antoinette it is necessary to draw large revenues from foreign countries. In a sense a limited budget is desirable. No money can be wasted, so the producer is forced to substitute ingenuity and talent. I am not suggesting, of course, that a low production budget invariably brings out the best in a producer. But I do know that mere expensiveness is no guarantee of a pic- ture's quality. Despite the belief in Holly- wood that American pictures must sell the world, I do want to point out that there is no real necessity for this. There are two methods of producing. One is to produce expensively and get the greatest possible re- turn from a world market. The other is to produce cheaply for a certain proportion of the population. By the latter method I don't mean production for a minority, but simply that you can't expect a picture to appeal to every age and nationality. The rare excep- tions like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs do not in any way disprove this point. Of course Hollywood has had far more success in the world market than any other country. Foreign producers have tried to imitate their success and the result has been a sad one. They hadn't Hollywood's tech- nical resources, and, in addition, commercial- ization robbed them of their best attribute — - freshness. All these factors lead me to believe that Hollywood has little to fear from foreign- language producers. This despite the fact that when I circulated a questionnaire at the Filmarte, my audience replied unanimously that knowledge of language was not essential to the enjoyment of a picture. This was borne out by the fact that only 15 per cent of them knew French and about 10 .per cent January, IQS9 were slightly acquainted with it. I naturally believe that if there is an increase in good pictures from abroad the audience interest in them will increase. Already there are two hundred foreign fiilm theatres in the United States, and while I believe these will never provoke serious competition with Hol- lywood for reasons of popular taste, I do think that Hollywood can profit by whatever competition is given it by foreign producers. Foreign films contain many new ideas, sug- gest new treatments, frequently provide new story material. Algiers, for example, was made from a French film Pepe le Moko, al- though I think it differed considerably from the original. People often ask me which I think are best: American or foreign productions. Again this is a question to which one cannot give a fair answer at all ; it is entirely a mat- ter of personal taste. I do think that to get over in this country a foreign language film has to be specially good, since much of the flavor of the dialog is bound to be lost on American audiences. But in time I believe American audiences could grow to have as keen an appreciation of foreign language films as the audiences in other countries have now. There is just one more point I would like to bring up in relation to foreign and Holly- wood productions. You may have noticed that censorship of the foreign film (on its arrival here) is more stringent than censor- ship of the domestic. Apparently there is a different code of morals here and abroad, and the foreign film takes on a sinister impli- cation when it crosses the Atlantic. Of course, I am opposed to censorship in any form, but strict censorship of foreign films strikes me as even more unfortunate, since it is taken for granted that every country has its own ethics. Why censor a film that originated abroad and is spoken in a foreign language? Besides, foreign films appeal to mature people. Children rarely, if ever, at- tend them. They would not understand them. The censors should be more Hberal with foreign films, but actually they are not. They fail to take into consideration the fact that they are judging the work of people who have no conception of what Americans consider proper and improper. 9 Films and Education \"The Motion Picture as an Educational Medium\" forms the subject matter of the Journal of Educational Sociology for No- vember. The half dozen articles making up the issue are bound to be of interest to teachers and students interested in the growth of the motion picture as an educa- tional medium. Very fortunately the day is passing when such educational studies were written without feeling or interest in the subject matter, and to read them re- quired determination and industry. Now, subject matter must be handled with in- terest and economy, and it is to the credit of this Journal that all six of its present articles have entertainment, as well as edu- cational value. One of the most interesting contributions is \"The Motion Picture Program and Pol- icy of the United States Government\" by Fanning Hearon, writing as director of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of the Interior. It is a summary of Wash- ington production covering the various mo- tion picture departments and describing the type of pictures produced by each one of them. The Department of Agriculture, with such pictures as The River and The Plow That Broke the Plains, is familiar to us all, but it will be news to many of us to hear of such lesser known producers as the Department of Interior and the Signal Corps of the War Department. Other contributions include a discussion of pedagogy and Hollywood : an apprecia- tive summary of the results of The Birth of a Baby film controversy; and a study of recent developments in the educational film field. Also two departures from the home field in the form of an intelligent explanation of the possibilities of teaching French with films, and an interesting de- scription of the progress in the use of edu- cational films in Great Britain. There are also book reviews, covering selected mate- rial relative to the movies published in the past year. This issue is edited by Dr. Fred- eric M. Thrasher and published at 26 Wash- ington Place, N. Y., Price $.35. Exceptional Photoplays Tfcw department seeks to include all photoplays of outstanding merit in the artistic development of the screen, with the object of bringing such pic- tures to the attention of ddscriminaHng readers. Wider the headings of Exceptional atnd Honorable Mention. The opinions of a committee composed of trained students and critics of the screen are combined in an impartial review which aims to convey a comprehensive idea of the picture, cov- ering both its exoellencies and defects. SECRETARY AND EDITOR, James Shellet Hamiltok COMMITTEE J. K. Paulding, Chairman Otis Ferguson Robert Giroux John A. McAndrew Frederic M. Terashu Henry Hart Mary B. Miller Frank Ward Beatrice W. Jafpe Frances Taylor Patterson The Year's Best EVERYBODY'S choice of \"best\" is apt to simmer down to what one hkes best. The National Board's annual selections give every taste a chance to func- tion. The Committee on Exceptional Photo- plays is looking principally for whatever furthers the motion picture as a medium of artistic expression, whether it adds some- thing technically to the movie art, extends the boundaries of that art as a picture of life, or presents something distinguished within the limits the movie has previously reached. For this reason the most emphasis is given to the selections of this committee, since they are more apt to hold up as a record of what the year has accomplished in the slow evolution of the cinema, and provide a: list for people in the future to con- sult when they want to know about, or re- vive, the important films of 1938. The large Review Committee, on the other hand, is not looking so much for artistic merit and importance. It is merely registering, as a part of the public, what it likes, and its selections, like those of the Young Review- ers, are likely to coincide fairly closely with a list of the biggest box-office successes of the same period. Some of these very popu- lar films are quickly forgotten, enjoyable as they are when they are new : less popular films are often the ones that are best remem- bered, and continue enjoyable as long as the prints of them survive. The Committee on Exceptional Photo- plays has again chosen what it considers the best film it has seen during the year, no mat- ter where made, and this year that choice was GRAND ILLUSION, made in France. This year the committee,, instead of making a purely American list, considered together all films in which English was the language spoken, feeling justified in this change by the obvious fact that American and English films, working so closely together in mate- rial, personnel and all the elements of film- making, have become so essentially indis- tinguishable from each other that the geo- graphical location of the studios in which they were made does not matter. Of Eng- lish-speaking films the Committee considered THE CITADEL the best, and the total list of ten is as follows, in the order in which they were ranked : 1. The Citadel 2. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 3. The Beachcomber 4. To the Victor 5. Sing You Sinners 6. The Edge of the World 7. Of Human Hearts 8. Jezebel 9. South Riding 10. Three Comrades THE CITADEL, adapted from A. J. Cronin's novel, made by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer in their English studio, was directed by King Vidor and had Robert Donat, Ralph Richardson and Rosalind Russell for its principal actors. It treated a serious sub- ject, that of the humanitarian practice of medicine, with sympathy and vividness. Its importance lies in this : that while it satisfies the critical it also entertains and educates the uncritical, educates them in a subtle wav. 10 January, iQS9 11 Fr.om \"The Citadel\" chosen by the Committee on Exceptional Photoplays as the best English speaking film of 1938 enlarging their knowledge and thinking about real things and issues, and setting for them a higher standard, of which they may be tmconscious but wliicli may nevertlieless be permanent and effective, of what to enjoy in movies. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Walt Disney's first feature- length picture, for which cartoon is an in- adequate name. It lias already charmed and delighted most of the modern world. It has opened up a new path in movie-making, which so far only Disney himself seems able to follow. A unique film, of perhaps in- calculable influence, but an influence still all in the future. THE BEACHCOMBER, made in England from a Somerset Maugham story, directed by Erich Pommer with Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester at the head of an excellent cast of actors. Comic and satirical, it manages to probe deftly and deeply into some of the best known of the so-called human vices and virtues. TO THE VICTOR. A fresh and re- freshing pictorial dramatization of Alfred Olliphant's dog story, \"Bob, Son of Battle\", directed by Robert Stevenson, and contain- ing among its many racy types a superb per- formance by Will Fyffe of a wily old rogue of a shepherd. SING YOU SINNERS. Directed by Wesley Ruggles, from an original story by Claude Binyon, with a cast splendidly head- ed by Bing Crosby, this Paramount film belongs securely in the small category of choicer Americana. Unpretentious but remarkably skilfull in all its elements, it is a warm and vivid picture of American family life as it is lived. THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. Made on a small island off the coast of Scotland by Michael Powell, this is a half-docu- mentary record of the vanishing of a primi- 12 National Board of Review Magazine tive people in the face of encroaching mod- ernity. It is a worthy companion to the Robert Flahert}^ films like Man of Aran. OF HUAIAN HEARTS. Made by JvIetro-Goldwyn-AIayer from Honore ]\\Ior- row's story, '\"Benefits Forgot\", directed by Clarence Brown with actors like Walter Huston, Beulah Bondi and James Stewart in memorable performances. A story of Civil A\\'ar days, and the quickly increasing distance already growing between genera- tions, this is essentially the eternal problem of a boy and his parents, and the simple but often tragic conflicts that happen in a loving family. JEZEBEL. A story of the old South, made by Warner Brothers and directed by William Wyler from a play by Owen Davis. A powerful study of a certain type of fem- inine character determined by her tradition, environment and inner nature, magnificent!}' played by Bette Da\\'is. SOUTH RIDING.

This ^letro- Goldwyn-AIayer dramatization of Erich Remarque's novel of Germany just after the war. directed by Frank Borzage. is a tender and searching story of a little group of human beings trying to save their bits of personal life against the inhuman mass results of hatred and war.

GRAND ILLUSION, made in France by Jean Renoir, and voted the best of all the pictures of the vear, is a storv of French and German soldiers during the war. most of its action concerning French prisoners of war in a German prison camp, and the Ger- mans in charge of them ; the escape of two of the prisoners, their brief stai- in the house of a German peasant woman ne^r the bor- der, and their eventual arrival in a neutral countrv. An entirelv unconventional film, deep and searching in its humanitv. For some it seems to be an anti-war film, but it is not so much anti-an}-thing as it is a pro- foundly sympathetic and understanding searching into human beings, as determined by the interaction of social forces and their individual selves. Five other foreign-language films were chosen for outstanding values. Ballerina, Un Carnet de Bal, Generals without Buttons, Peter the First and Professor Mamlock. The Committee on Exceptional Photo- plays considers the following screen per- formances worthy of special praise. These preferences are listed alphabetically.

Four Daughters The nation-wide 4-Star Clubs, which are the junior groups of the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, made the fol- lowing selection of the ten best pictures of 1938. These boys and girls, ranging in age from 9 to 17. make their selections in ad- vance of any published lists made by older January, ipsp 13 groups or critics so that there can be no question of their being influenced by older people's opinions. The voting resulted in the following list of TEN BEST, listed in order of preference : 1. Boys Town 2. You Can't Take It With You 3. Alexander's Ragtime Band 4. Marie Antoinette The following break-down of the vote into the choices of boys and girls of different age groups may have a special interest for those who would like to compare tastes.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs It is obvious from this list that what young people like in the movies is just about what grown people hke. It is a notably catholic list, covering about all types of movies except frivolous comedies and senti- mental romances, and including many that might have been expected to appeal only to the adult intelligence.

After all his jibes at the cinema and its makers, he has tvu\"ned his own clever hand to the fashioning of a motion picture, and he finds it good. Therefore the movies themselves are good, or can be — if he makes them. Of course A-Ir. Shaw's prattle about what a wonder he is has gone rather stale in its incessant repetition during the last half century : he has been his own Ziegfeld, needing no impressario to glorify him, and the cuteness of a pixie with whiskers begins to creak after a few decades. But once more he is right. Pygmalion is a good film, or if not precisely a good film it is a good thing for the film, abstractly, and — best of all — excellent entertainment. Shaw can't teach Hollywood anything about the making of pictures, though of course he thinks he can, but he can teach audiences (if he can reach them) to increase their expectations from the screen, just as the National Board and believers in the movies everywhere have been aiming to do these many years. Hollywood can do anything enough people want it to do. Once let it hear the path beating at its door and Holly- wood will inevitably supply the mouse-trap. Shaw is one of the great vulgarizers (i.e., popuLarizers) of the twentieth century. A spinsterish mid-wife for the ideas of more original thinkers than himself, a home mis- sionary preaching shrilly and wittily to a smallish audience that has seen his beard turn from red to snowy white, there is no knowing how much he has accomplished. Through his vigorous stirring of young- thinking admirers he has probably added something to the mental landscape of in- numerable literate people, and through them to the mass mind. Now through the medium of the movies he is somewhat con- descendingly attacking the mass mind from a new approach. Whether the mass mind has any ear for him, directly, remains to be seen. All of this is a rather heavy prelude to the simple statement that Pygmalion, Shaw's first personal contribution to the screen, is a very funny comedy. Essentially it is nothing more than an elaborate joke, spun out by means of dialogue to the expected length of a screen-play, and provided with enough hints of sentiment to feed the imagination of those who want a bit of feeling in addi- tion to brio-ht talk in their entertainment. January, /pjp 15 Talky it is, and in an Englisli way tliat may well be tiresome if not downright unintel- ligible to mentally non-urban audiences, but the technique that Hollywood has given the world (and for which Mr. Shaw, if he en- joys any success in the nation's movie houses, may well thank the gods of mam- mon) has done some of its magic, by con- stantly keeping a camera illusion of action where no action actually is, to create a sense of movement through the talkiness. Pygmalion is a better picture than it was a play. Shaw has cut from his original, and added to it, so that with the help of good direction and more than good acting he has given his modern version of the myth about a sculptor whose statue came to life a humanness and likeability it never had be- fore. The story is extremely local — Brit- ishly local — and has to do with teaching a Cockney flower-girl with the cockneyest of speech to talk the King's English so flaw- lessly that she could be passed off as a duchess. A professor of phonetics train- ing a girl to speak correctly sounds dry enough, but it is an extremely amusing thing to see happen, as it happens in this film, with a novel sort of excitement about it. Its appeal — even its humorous appeal — is a good deal to the mind, as written, but as acted by Wendy Hiller it manages to reach down into the sympathies also, and stir a human interest in the girl who got cultured beyond her station and found herself with- out a place in the world. Shaw has even let a touch of romance and emotion creep in for those who care for it, so' that the finish may be taken as an odd but happy ending for a love story. The sculptor found his statue necessary to him after he had grown ac- customed to her being alive : Shaw's way of implying that he fell in love with her. Leslie Howard not only acted the profes- sor, in a characteristic Leslie Howard fash- ion that will satisfy his admirers, but as- sisted Anthony Asquith in the direction. Just who contributed most to this directorial collaboration cannot be guessed, but the sum of it is what makes Pygmalion seem more of a real movie than it actually is. And Arthur Honneger has composed a musical score that is witty and a real help. But G. B. S. is probably the man to whom most of the credit for the film belongs, for he wrote the script and undoubtedly approved everything he didn't devise himself. But he couldn't have devised Wendy Hiller. He merely gave her scope, and she, in turn, will have given him every bit of popular success that Pygmalion achieves. Her Eliza Doohttle is one of the outstand- ing pieces of screen acting of the year. Wil- fred Lawson and Jean Cadell also do a lot to make the picture (odd though it sounds) both Shavian and human.

Here Miss Jose- phine Allensworth, Chairman of Motion Pictures and Visual Aids for the National Association <of Teachers of Speech, and Advisor of the A-Star Club, Humes High School, Memphis, Tennessee, presents a valid pro argument from her teach- ing experience. THE motion picture should occupy an important place in the curriculum of our schools because it has become the most powerful teaching device that has been developed in the twentieth century. To the growing, restless, irresponsible high school boys and girls the movies are the chief form of amusement, and well they might be if these young people have the right guidance and study in selecting their pictures. Hence we teachers, if we hope to be leaders in the cultural development of our country and our school, must begin to analyze the type of pictures our students should see and try to give them some stan- dards of appreciation by which to judge a picture and at the same time to become an intelligent movie patron. In this way we will show the producers there is a demand for high class films and they will continue to make them. At the present time the motion picture is our most significant force in controlling mass education. Statistics reveal that an average of 85,000,000 people in 1937 at- tended the movies weekly, and yet the film producers are daily trying to raise that standard and reach the more discriminating people who are not habitual movie fans. They are succeeding, for never before have we had literature, drama, and history pre- sented to the masses so artistically and so entertainingly as we are now witnessing it. What better place in the entire high school or college curriculum can we suggest that the study of the motion picture be put than in connection with drama or with gen- eral literature which contains drama? In the last five years, in which I have been teaching motion picture appreciation, I have found that students, who came to me without any preparation or background for drama, are led more willingly to study a play and analyze it, if it has already been put in the movies and has won their interest, or if it is going to be made into a movie. It has been our custom at Humes High School for many years to teach A Tale of Two Cities in the twelfth grade. Year after year this became more difficult — at times students almost rebelled at an assignment in the text, but the year in which the movie was made became a red letter day for me, for the students not only read the assignment but eagerly devoured a great amount of material in our libraries on the French Revolutionary period. Hollywood sent us the actual \"shooting script\" with all sound effects indicated. This became the most precious volume in our drama library. It was read and used for an acting script for months before the picture came. What fun we had in guessing how this scene would be played, how this actor would look, how this sound would be made, and if anything in the entire picture would be as good as we were ! This experience made me realize the im- portance in keeping abreast of the fine current pictures that are absorbing the at- tention of the public. Feeling as I do that the motion picture deserves the same consideration in schools, colleges, and universities that we give the study of appreciation courses in literature, art, music, and drama, I decided on several objectives for this study. It is an accepted fact that the more we know about any one particular thing, the more we appreciate it; so to approach the study of a picture from an appreciation and entertainment angle, one satisfies not only the longing for emo- tional reaction, for which one generally goes to the movies, but receives a greater stimulus, such as curiosity, a desire to learn January, ipjp 17 more about certain phases of the picture. The greatest interest naturally centers around the story, the analysis of which may be considered the first objective. One should begin the discussion by paying care- ful attention to the plot in both tragedies and comedies, studying the stages in plot development, namely; exposition, complica- tion or rising action, climax, resolution or consequence, and denouement. Does the story have a strong audience appeal, one that is properly motivated? A strong feeling of suspense and an unexpected ending? This study was particularly effective in such plays as Romeo and Juliet, Stage Door, Yelloiv Jack, Holiday, You Can't Take It With You and The Shining Hour. The second objective in making practical a study of the motion picture for dramatic purposes is to consider the technique of act- ing. We discuss such problems as these : Is the actor perfectly natural? Does he make the audience feel he is a real person? Is his characterization good ? Does he understand the character he is portraying and is he developing it intelligently? Is his make-up suitable to the play and to the characteriza- tion? Vie-toria The Great is just one of the many examples of the miracles of modern make-up. In order to create a more extensive inter- est in drama both on the screen and on the stage, the third objective deals with a com- parison of the stage play and the motion pic- ture version. Questions of this nature arise : Is the play adapted to the methods of the screen? Since the dialogue must be con- densed and changed, will the picture be ruined for one who has seen it on the stage ? Since the screen play has been chosen be- cause of the popularity of the stage play, does it present something that is in itself good ? Is the screen more adaptable for an authentic historical background? Can the interest of verse be sustained in the movies as well as on the stage and its lyric quality kept. Can biography and history be por- trayed more successfully on the screen? Does a historical picture have more contiun- ity and flow than the stage play? Victoria the Great, Victoria Regina, Stage Door, Winterset, and Romeo cmd Juliet, make intensely interesting dramas for this comparison. Our study of these plays and then of the movies has been a great stimulus to reading. In all probability we would not have studied the stage play had we not first become inter- ested in the movie version. Therefore the motion picture has been a great source of inspiration as well as of information, by stimulating the interest and activity of the students. They now look beyond the mere superficial idea of entertainment and see that by their intelligent and careful study new standards may be established in the field of cinema arts and a more enlightened future made possible for the masses. Since the motion pictures are interpreting the spoken drama to millions weekly who never will see a good play presented in any other manner, they are invaluable in teach- ing diction and dialect, keeping in mind of course that only certain ones can be used to an advantage and certain actors and ac- tresses suggested as models for their purity of speech. To make our students conscious of good speech is one of our greatest tasks, but now with the help of the radio and the talkies the task is much simpler than it was ten years ago, even five years ago. Educators have long since realized that the stage can do very little toward improving regional pronunciations on account of its limited audience. Its influence of two hun- dred years or more (the first stage play in America having been given in the first decade of the eighteenth century) has not been felt by the masses so far as diction is concerned, because in that length of time regional dia- lects have developed. However, in the twelve years of the talkies, the masses have become more ear minded and enjoy speech that is adequate for understanding, that is not flat and thin and nasal like the typical American voice. They see the mouth open and the lips move with the sound of the words and won- der what has been the trouble with them- selves all these years. There is practically no sectional dialect in the best movies of today, but instead a beau- tiful cultural speech is being used that may become in time a standard American speech, or if my readers prefer, that may become an accepted general American speech that is used by the best educated classes of today. Our students in motion picture apprecia- 18 National Board of Review Magazine tion have had much pleasure in listening to the pronunciation of certain words and bringing them to the meetings for discussion and for practice to improve their own pro- nunciation or dialect if they are working on a play in which dialect is used. In David Copperfield we heard the pecu- harities of the Yorkshire dialect and found out the way the Peggotys talked as Dickeiis portrayed them.\" Lionel Barrymore as Dan Peggoty, and Jessie Ralph who played Peg- goty the nurse, were outstanding in their portrayal of the Yorkshire dialect and were of special interest to those who were prepar- ing a reading from \"David Copperfield.\" One student told the story of \"David Cop- perfield\" and quite unconsciously put in some of the Yorkshire dialect. In Victoria the Great we heard impeccable diction. The German accent of Anton Wal- brook and the beautiful clear English of Anna Neagle were worth listening to over and over. It could not help improving the speech of those of us who listened not to imitate but to learn. Each syllable was enunciated clearh' and beautifully. Mayerling gave us an excellent lesson in French and an opportunity to hear speech that was similar to a musical accompani- ment. The plot was so intriguing that stu- dents decided to read more about the famous Archduke Rudolph of Austria. We chose Maxwell Anderson's Masque of Kings, thereby adding another brilliant drama to our lists. In all of Ronald Colman's pictures, we again heard flawless diction. His rendition of the exquisite poetry in // / Were King was an incentive to read and recite some of Francois Villon's masterpieces. Both Mayerling and // I Were King furnished subjects for radio skits. The best skits in the group were used over our local station. This gave many students the op- portunity to appear on a radio for the first time and a chance to see how necessary a cultural speech is and how difficult good dic- tion is without constant work. Each one in a movie audience will be most interested in what he knows the most about, and this knowledge and understanding will partly determine his reaction to the play. He may be interested in the photography, in the scenery, in the natural or historical settings, in the music, in the fencing, in the costumes ; or if a person is especially interested in speech and drama, he will be vitally con- cerned with the voices, the inflections, the rhythm, and the pronunciations — as we are in our motion picture study. So consider what excellent opportunities teachers of Speech and English have in helping their students to become interested in studying the splendid interpretation of drama that is being given by the camera. Junior Replies to a Questionnaire STATISTICS which bear upon the in- terest of children in motion pictures have always been popular with read- ers of the Magazine, and we print them from time to time. This month we present two responses to a questionnaire prepared by the National Board of Review for its junior 4-Star Clubs. One is from a girls' group : the Motion Picture Club of Wil- loghby Junior High School, Miss Josephine McGinness, Advisor; and the other from a boys' group : the Movie Club of Clark Junior High School, Miss Olga Koppe, Ad- visor. The questionnaire was answered by 39 girls and 54 bovs, the average age being 131/2. A large majority of boys and girls went to the movies neither more nor less fre- quently than once a week. Both boys and girls agreed that they were happiest when choosing their own films; few liked to be told what to see. Opinions differed, how- ever, over the question of \"How do you choose your Movies?\" since 52% of the boys depended in varying degrees upon what they read in newspaper and magazine reviews, and only half that percentage tend- ed to choose according to the actors fea- tured. While with the girls, the method of choice was less one-sided ; they depended almost equally upon both actors and re- views. They were also a great deal readier than the boys to trust a friend's recommen- dation ! January, ipSP 19 The next question : \"What kind of movies do you like?\" again showed divergences of opinion between boys and girls. The girls gave realistic pictures the top place, with musicals a close second, and adventure, drama, mystery, romance, comedy, sad, his- torical, sport. Western and war following in that order, with only one or two votes separating the respective categories. The boys plumped whole-heartedly for adven- ture, placing comedy a bad second, closely followed by historical. These three were easy winners : the remainder, with compara- tively few votes, followed in this order : mystery, sport, musical, realistic, drama, war and western — no votes for sad and ro- mantic ! The question : \"Name the movies you have liked best\" cannot serve as a basis for comparison between boy-and-girl tastes, since the questionnaires were not submitted at the same time and the boys' votes do not include pictures released after June 1938. The boys put The Buccaneer in first place with a three vote lead over The Plainsman,- while The Informer and Zola tied a close third. Others with good votes from the boys were, in order, Marco Polo, Trail of the Lonesome Pine, The Good Earth and In Old Chicago (tied). Hurricane, Snow White and Mutiny on the Bo-unty. Twelve other pictures were mentioned but only re- ceived negligible votes The igirls' vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Boys' Town, which drew more than two-thirds of their total votes. (This picture had not been seen by the boys at the time of making their replies and it can be confidently prophesied that they will give it somewhere near top rating when they choose their Ten Best of the year.) Dead End and Mad About Music tied for second place with a mere five votes, with Alexander's Ragtime Band, Carefree and Algiers tied third. The Crozvd Roars, Four Daughters, My Lucky Star tied fourth. Boys and girls came back into agreement over the question oi how much talk there should be in a movie. They wanted action rather than words by a large majority. As to love-interest, two-thirds of the boys would have none of it, while two-thirds of the girls were all for it — enough to give any calculating producer a headache. Both groups liked their movies to have child actors. Although some boys and a few girls wrote that the movies had spoiled their favorite books, they were quite in agreement about having their favorite books turned into mo- tion pictures. Three-quarters of the boys enjoyed movies that combined entertainment and instruction ; the girls voting unanimous- ly for this. There was about the same af- firmative response to the question of whether the movies had helped them in their school- work, and in favor of having educational films shown in the classrooms. The ques- tion of whether they would enjoy motion picture appreciation study in school was all but unanimously favored by boys and girls — one small girl, for reasons we shall never know, dissenting. The final question caused another split. \"Which do you like best : Athletics, Movies, Reading, Games, Radio?\" The boys liked them in that order, with athletics leading movies by a long way, and reading a poor third. The girls, however, put movies well in the first place, comfortably ahead of ra- dio, with athletics, reading and games tail- ing. It would be impractical to base any con- clusions upon these replies, since they cover too small a number of children to be valid as indicative of any real trend. We present the replies simply as a matter of interest to those readers who might wish to com- pare them with their own findings, or issue a similar questionnaire to their own pupils. THE motion picture in the theatre is familiar to all, the motion picture in the school is familiar toi noany, but not so much is known about the motion picture in busi- ness. However it will not be difficult con- veniently to find information on this last in the new \"Business Screen\"- published in Chicago. This is a periodical good to look at and easy to read and it is confined not alone to the interest of producers and users of business films but covers also any non- theatrical film interest. 20 National Board of Review Magazine We Welcome to Membership Two new members have been added this month to the Board's National Motion Picture Council. They are Mrs. Raymond R. Bear and Mrs. Joseph L. White. Mrs. Bear is Pennsylvania State D. A. R. Chairman of Motion Pictures. In spite of this exacting State office she finds time for other motion .picture interests, for she is also Motion Picture Chairman of the Women's Club in her home community of AUentown, Pa. and Program Chairman of the Philadelphia Motion Picture Forum. Mrs. Bear often comes to New York for various meetings of the Board and has shown her interest in other ways so this is further cementing an already close connec- tion with the Board. Mrs. White is the able President of the Montclair (N. J.) Motion Picture Council. This Council was formed in 1931 and Mrs. White has been its leader since 1933. She is also a member of the Executive Commit- tee of the Metropohtan Motion Picture Council, the Board's New York City Council which includes many groups in the Metro- politan area. Another of Mrs. White's mo- tion picture interests is with the National Y.W.C.A. We feel that she will give valu- able service to the Council and welcome her into this closer affiliation.

NAME ADDRESS AFFILIATION NATIONAL BOARD OF REVIEW OF MOTION PICTURES The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures is a citizen body, organized in 1909 by the People's Institute of New York City as a medium for reflecting intelligent public opinion regarding a\"growing art and entertainment. This is still the Board's function, together with that of disseminating information on the subject of motion pictures and carrying on a constructive program having to do with community cooper- ation in the advancement and uses of the motion picture. The National Board is opposed to legal censor- ship and is in favor of the community better films plan of placing emphasis upon and building support' for the finer and more worthwhile films. It is at all times glad to cooperate with any agency to encourage and guide the motion pic- ture in developing its possibilities both as recreation and as entertainment. It carries on its work through various com- mittees. All members of the committees serve without pay. No member is connected with the motion picture industry. They are representative of varied interests and activities and many are connected with large public welfare organizations or educational institutions. The General Committee is a body evolved out of the original group organized in 1909. It is the appeal and central advisory committee of the National Board to which policies are referred and to which decisions of the Review Committee regarding pictures may be carried either by the producers or by the Review Committee Itself. Tlie Executive Committee is composed of members of the General Committee and is the directing body of the National Board, charged with the formulation of policies, the election of members, the expenditure of funds and super- vision of all administrative affairs. The Review Committee is a large group of 300 members carrying on the work of reviewing the films. It is divided into sub-groups which meet for review per schedule during each week in the projection rooms of the various motion picture companies. The Membership Committee supervises the membership list of the Review Committee and recommends the names of proposed new mem- bers for consideration by the Executive Com- mittee. The Committee on Exceptional Photoplays is composed of critics and students of the cinema interested particularly in encouraging the ar- tistic development of the motion picture. It reviews and publishes a critique of the finest films and assists community groups in the show- ing of unusual films to special audiences. Its pioneer activity has done much to lay the foun- dation for the Little Photoplay Theatre move- ment and to stimulate the organization of subscription groups to develop audiences for the support of the creative achievements of the screen. NATIONAL MOTION PICTURE COUNCIL The community or field work of the National Board of Review is conducted under Its National Motion Picture Council, through affiliated mem- bership groups, service contact groups and cor- respondent's throughout the country. The Na- tional Council assists in the organization and program of work of local groups which are usually called Councils. These Councils follow a plan initiated by the National Board In 1916 of having a membership composed of representatives from many organ- izations, cultural, educational, recreational, reli- gious, and civic, so that they typify the original movement for community participation in the development and best use of the motion picture as recreation and education. The objectives of such organizations are as follows: To demonstrate through the education of public opinion, the effectiveness of selection and classification, instead of censorship, as a means of forwarding the development of the motion picture and its best uses. To encourage through open meetings, forums, classes and other means, the study of the motion picture as a medium of entertainment, education and artistic expression. To concentrate the attention of the public on specific worthwhile films through the publication of a Photoplay Guide to the selected pictures being currently shown at local theatres. To arrange family Friday night or week-end programs of selected films, and junior matinees of pictures particularly suited to the tastes of children, through cooperation with local exhib- itors. To endorse and further the use of vi.sual edu- cation through motion pictures in the schools. To arrange and promote occasional exhibitions of exceptional and cultural films that would not normally be shown in the commercial theatres. PUBLICATIONS The National Board of Review and its Council as an aid to the groups carrying out these objectives furnished an informational service through its publications.
