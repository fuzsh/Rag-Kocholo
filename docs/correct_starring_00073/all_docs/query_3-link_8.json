        "text": "Scared Straight\n\nEric visits his doctor's office after getting some unsavory news from Drama about his latest fling. Ari investigates Terrance after he unexpectedly offers to sell Ari his share of his agency. Meanwhile, Turtle prepares for Jamie-Lynn's departure and Drama's emotions get the best of him during his audition for 'Melrose 2009.'\n\nSnake Eyes\n\nThe BAU tries their luck in Atlantic City when the team is called in to investigate a series of ritualistic casino-related murders. Also, after a spat with her boyfriend, Kevin, Garcia thinks she and Morgan may have gotten a little too friendly with each other. Dean Cain Guest Stars as Down-On-His-Luck Gambler Curtis Banks.\n\nStarved\n\nDean Cain, Teri Garr, Veronica Cartwright, Judith Light and Fred Dalton Thompson Guest star - When a series of rapes is linked to a speed-dating service, Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) goes undercover and discovers Mike Jergens (guest star Dean Cain) is the assailant. As the case progresses, Jergens' insecure girlfriend Cora Kennison (guest star Tina Holmes) - an alcoholic and bulimic - becomes an unwilling pawn as both Benson and attorney Minerva Grahame-Bishop (guest star Teri Garr) seek to persuade Kennison to testify for their respective sides - despite her mother's (guest star Veronica Cartwright) insistence that her daughter is too fragile. Kennison opts to marry Jergens in the hope that spousal privilege will save her from taking the stand, but since the rapes occurred before they married, she is still forced to testify. Distraught, Kennison drinks to excess, leaving her in an irreversible coma, and her fate in the hands of her husband. Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, Richard Belzer, Diane Neal, Tamara Tunie and B.D. Wong also star."
