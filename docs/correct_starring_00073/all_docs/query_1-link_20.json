        "text": "USA: Walt Disney Studios, 1970. Item #05236\n\nThomas O'Malley and Duchess\n\nDISNEY STUDIOS. Original Walt Disney Production celluloid with background featuring Thomas O'Malley and Duchess from The Aristocats. Walt Disney: [USA, 1970]. Image size: 7 7/8 inches x 9 7/8 inches; 202 mm x 250 mm. Framed size: 12 3/4 inches x 14 1/2 inches; 326 mm x 370 mm. Matted, framed and glazed. Minimal cracking on cell, otherwise fine.\n\nThe Aristocats is a 1970 American animated romantic musical comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. The 20th Disney animated feature film, the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.\n\nIn 1962, The Aristocats project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in turnaround as The Jungle Book advanced into production. When The Jungle Book was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on The Aristocats, making it the last film project to be approved by Disney personally before his death in December 1966. Longtime Disney collaborators Robert and Richard Sherman composed multiple songs for the film, though only two made it in the finished product.\n\nThe Aristocats was released on December 24, 1970, to positive reception and was a box office success."
