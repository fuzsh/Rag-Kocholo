        "text": "MANSFIELD - Get ready. The cameras are set to roll in and around Mansfield.\n\nJCFilms will produce a new Dean Cain and Kevin Sorbo film on adoption in Mansfield with filming starting June 22, according to Mansfield native Kimberly Yeager Miller, who is working as an actress, instructor, image consultant and producer on the film.\n\nThe film is titled: \"CHOSEN.\"\n\nCain, Sorbo of 'Lois & Clark' and 'Hercules'\n\nCain, an award-winning actor, is best known for playing the role of Clark Kent/Superman in the TV series \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\" He is costarring with actor Kevin Sorbo, known for his roles in \"God's Not Dead\" and Hercules in in the film \"Hercules\" as well as many other roles.\n\nSince 2013, JCFilms has produced over 30 faith-based and family friendly moves. Its goal is to create family friendly films while offering opportunity for people of faith to get involved in Christian movie-making.\n\nMore: 'So happy we found him': Brother reunites with siblings after six decades\n\nJCFilms will partner with The Crown Studios, owned by Heather Habura of Akron, to start a faith hub for Christian movie-making in Ohio.\n\nHabura (formerly McDonald) grew up in Bath and graduated from Copley High School and the University of Akron. She started coaching more than 20 years ago after spending five years participating in the Miss America Scholarship program.\n\n\"CHOSEN\" is based on true stories of adoption and foster parenting. The film, starring Cain, Sorbo and actor Edie McClintock, a Canton-area native, will be produced this month.\n\nAccording to film officials, on any given day in Ohio, nearly 16,000 children are being cared for in foster care. The number is expected to increase as the number of foster parents are decreasing. The film's goal is to challenge communities and people of faith to come together to help and support these many challenges.\n\nBreckelle Miller, 6, of Ontario, is cast in the upcoming movie and will sing. The local girl also is a ventriloquist, following in her mother Kimberly Yeager Miller's footsteps.\n\nYeager Miller, a Mansfield native, along with Habura, are part of JCFilms leadership team under President Jason Campbell as instructors, actresses, image consultants and producers.\n\nReal 'sisterhood' partnership leads to the movie experience\n\n\"Heather Habura and I have been friends since we competed together in Miss Ohio back in 2000,\" Kimberly Yeager Miller said.\" The sisterhood is real. We believe our Miss Ohio experiences have prepared us for this moment in time as we have come together to work on this film 'CHOSEN'.\".\n\nYeager Miller said in January JCFilms held acting classes at Habura ’s Studio and she invited Yeager Miller and her children to attend.\n\n\"That is when I met Jason Campbell and he instantly loved that I was a ventriloquist and wrote my part into the script for 'CHOSEN.' I didn’t find out until months later when I became more involved with 'CHOSEN,'\" Yeager Miller said.\n\n\"We have taken what we learned at Miss Ohio and applied it over the years in our careers,\" Kimberly added.\n\n\"We also work with clients via FaceTime and at The Crown Studio that Heather opened last summer in Akron,\" she said.\n\n\"CHOSEN\" initially was to be cast in Akron, \"but once I showed Jason (Campbell) all that our great town had to offer he was convinced that 'Sunny Mansfield' was the right place to film,\" the Ontario woman said. \"The community has been wonderful with allowing us to use their locations to film, such as Crossroads Church, Richland Academy, Richland County Juvenile Court Judge W. Steve McKinley's courtroom, China Town Restaurant, Allure Studios, Richland Carrousel Park, Holiday Inn, Dwight Schar College of Nursing and Health Sciences, Mansfield Playhouse and several private residences, just to name a few,\" Yeager Miller said.\n\n\"We are hosting a charity gala June 27 as a fundraising even for 'CHOSEN' and Helping Hands Ministry,\" she said. The event will be held at 5 p.m. at the Holiday Inn & Suites, 116 Park Avenue West. Tickets are available for purchase at JCFilms.org.\n\nMansfield has a 'special place in my heart'\n\n\"I’m so excited to see how God will use this movie 'CHOSEN' about foster care and adoption to make a difference. My hometown of Mansfield will always have a special place in my heart and I’m so honored and humbled to be a part of 'CHOSEN' and JCFilms,\" Yeager Miller said.\n\nIn July she and Habura are teaching acting classes in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\"We will be teaching acting classes for children through adults with actor Dean Cain and president Jason Campbell. There we will prepare for his next movie 'Not For Sale' that sheds light on the sex trafficking epidemic,\" Yeager Miller said.\n\nLocal radio personality Rusty Cates has been cast as a physician named Dr. Walker in \"CHOSEN.\"\n\nHe said he has three lines of dialogue and is excited to be part of the film.\n\nlwhitmir@gannett.com\n\n419-521-7223\n\nTwitter: @LWhitmir"
