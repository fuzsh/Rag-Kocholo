        "text": "American film actor (1912–1998)\n\nDane Clark (born Bernhardt Zanvilevitz; February 26, 1912 – September 11, 1998) was an American character actor who was known for playing, as he labeled himself, \"Joe Average.\"[1]\n\nClark was born Bernhardt Zanvilevitz (later Bernard Zanville), the son of Samuel,[2] a sporting goods store owner, and his wife Rose.\n\nHis date of birth is a matter of some dispute among different sources.[4]\n\nHe graduated from Cornell University in 1936 and earned a law degree in 1938 at St. John's University School of Law[5] in Brooklyn, New York, which was before its current building was constructed at St. John's campus in Queens. During the Great Depression, he worked as a professional boxer, minor league baseball player, construction worker, and model.[1]\n\nModeling brought him in contact with people in the arts. He gradually perceived them to be snobbish, with their talk of the \"theatah,\" and \"I decided to give it a try myself, just to show them anyone could do it.\"[1]\n\nClark's early acting experience included work with the Group Theatre in New York City.[6] He progressed from small Broadway parts to larger ones, eventually taking over the role of George from Wallace Ford in the 1937 production of Of Mice and Men.[1] His other Broadway credits include Mike Downstairs (1968), A Thousand Clowns (1962), Fragile Fox (1954), The Number (1951), Dead End (1935), Waiting for Lefty (1935), Till the Day I Die (1935), and Panic (1935).[7]\n\nClark's first film was The Pride of the Yankees (1942). He had an uncredited bit in The Glass Key (1942) at Paramount.\n\nClark got his big break when he was signed by Warner Bros. in 1943. He worked alongside some of his era's biggest stars, often in war movies such as Action in the North Atlantic (1943), his breakthrough part, opposite Humphrey Bogart. According to Clark, Bogart gave him his stage name.[1] Hollywood newspaper columnist Louella Parsons wrote in 1942 that Warner Bros. first changed his name to Zane Clark but then decided on Dane Clark because \"Too many confused Zane Clark with Jane Clark.\"[8]\n\nHe was third billed in Destination Tokyo (1943) beneath Cary Grant and John Garfield, and in The Very Thought of You (1944) with Dennis Morgan and Eleanor Parker. He had one of the leads in Hollywood Canteen (1944), playing an actual role while most Warners stars made cameo appearances as themselves. Clark had the lead in the 1944 short film I Won't Play with Janis Paige, which received the 1945 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel).[9] Clark supported Morgan in God Is My Co-Pilot (1945) and Garfield in Pride of the Marines (1945).\n\nExhibitors voted Clark the 16th most popular star at the US box office in 1945.[10] In that same year he had a notable part in an Army Airforce training film, Tail Gunner, which starred actors Ronald Reagan, Burgess Meredith as the main character, Tom Neal and Jonathan Hale.\n\nClark supported Bette Davis and Glenn Ford in A Stolen Life (1946) and was promoted to top billing for Her Kind of Man (1946), a crime film. He followed it with That Way with Women (1947), Deep Valley (1947), and Embraceable You (1948). Republic Pictures borrowed him to play the lead for Frank Borzage in Moonrise (1948). At Warner Bros., he was in Whiplash (1948). Clark went to United Artists for Without Honor (1948), then back to Warner Bros. for Backfire (1950) and Barricade (1950). He travelled to England to make Highly Dangerous (1950) and France for Gunman in the Streets (1951). Back at Columbia he was in Never Trust a Gambler (1951). He acted in the United Artists Western Fort Defiance (1951). He returned to Britain for The Gambler and the Lady (1953), Murder by Proxy (1954) and Five Days (1955), all for Hammer Films. In the US, he was in Go Man Go (1954) with the Harlem Globetrotters and Toughest Man Alive (1955).\n\nDuring the 1950s, he became one of a small group of actors (excluding the original 'founding' members brought in at the Studio's inception) awarded life membership in the Actors Studio.[11]\n\nClark played Peter Chambers in the short-lived radio program Crime and Peter Chambers,[12] a half-hour show which aired from April 6 to September 7, 1954.\n\nClark first appeared on television in the late 1940s, and after the mid-1950s worked much more in that medium than in feature films. In the 1954/1955 season, he co-starred as the character Richard Adams in the crime drama Justice.[13]\n\nOn July 1, 1955 while starring in the play The Shrike, the lead actress Isabel Bonner, suffered a brain hemorrhage and died. [14] The scene took place in a hospital, and when Isabel Bonner collapsed on a bed, Dane Clark, ad-libbing, put his arm around Bonner and said, \"Ann, speak to me. Is something the matter? What's wrong, darling? I love you.\" Then, realizing something was wrong, he turned to the wings and said \"Bring down the curtain.\" A film editor in the audience, Harold Cornsweet, later said of the ad-libbed scene: \"It was so realistic that people in the audience were crying.\"[15]\n\nHe returned to films for The Man Is Armed (1956) and Outlaw's Son (1957).\n\nIn 1958 he was a guest star on the television series Wagon Train in The John Wilbut Story. Clark played John Wilbut, a man who some on the train believe to be John Wilkes Booth on the run from the assassination of Lincoln.\n\nIn 1959, he reprised Humphrey Bogart's role as Slate in Bold Venture, a short-lived television series. He also guest starred on a number of television shows, including Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town, Appointment with Adventure, CBS's Rawhide in the episode \"Incident of the Night Visitor\", and The Twilight Zone, in the episode \"The Prime Mover\".\n\nIn 1970, he guest-starred in an episode of The Silent Force and had a role in The McMasters (1970). That same year he appeared as Barton Ellis on The Men From Shiloh, rebranded name of the long running TV Western series The Virginian in the episode titled \"The Mysterious Mrs. Tate.\" He also played Lieutenant Tragg in the short-lived revival of the Perry Mason television series in 1973, and appeared in the 1976 miniseries Once an Eagle.\n\nClark died on September 11, 1998, of lung cancer at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California.[16] His remains were cremated and his ashes given to his widow.[17]\n\nFor TV movies, see § Complete filmography.\n\nThe Twilight Zone (1961, episode \"The Prime Mover\") – Ace Larsen\n\nDan August (1971, episode \"The Meal Ticket\") - Sam\n\nIronside (1969 Goodbye to Yesterday)\n\nHawaii Five-O (1975, episode \"The Hostage\") – Jesse\n\nHawaii Five-O (1977, episode \"Blood Money Is Hard to Wash\") – Victor Jovanko\n\nHawaii Five-O (1978, episode \"The Pagoda Factor\") – Sergeant Riley\n\nFantasy Island (1980 TV series season 4) (1980, episode \"The Love Doctor; Pleasure Palace; Possessed\") - Lieutenant Blainey\n\nMurder She Wrote (1989, episode \"The Grand Old Lady\") - Mr. Viscard\n\nYear Program Episode/source 1942 Suspense Tom Cochrane in \"The Singing Walls\", air date September 2, 1943 1943 Suspense Walter Bates in \"Life Ends at Midnight\", air date February 17, 1944 1945 Suspense Joe Jordan in \"This Will Kill You\", air date August 23, 1945[18] 1946 The Fifth Horseman[19] Doomsday 1951 The Big Show Guest appearance, air date November 25, 1951 1952 Philip Morris Playhouse The Criminal Code[20] 1953 Broadway Playhouse The Turning Point[21]"
