Henson, Matt Damon and Sarah Silverman\n\nThe twentieth Disney classic, The Aristocats, was also the last one to be greenlit by Walt himself. The story was originally intended to be a live-action, two-part special for the show Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Colour in 1962, so in 1961 Walt commissioned Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan to find a suitable animal story for it. The pair found an unknown piece by Tom Rowe, an American writer living in Paris, so they bought the rights to it and edited it into the first draft of a script. They sent this to Burbank in August 1962, but it was returned marked “rejected” by an unknown staff member at the studio. Undaunted, Tytle thus took the script directly to Walt, leaving it at the reception desk of the Connaught hotel in London, where Walt was staying. He approved Tytle’s draft, but also recommended a few additional changes which were made by February 1963.\n\nBefore filming of the special began, Rowe (the original writer) wrote to Walt to express his displeasure with some of the script revisions – Tytle replied that while Walt understood his concerns, they were sticking with at least some of the changes as they felt they would work better. As it turned out, however, the project was shelved entirely in the summer of 1963, so Tytle discussed with Walt the idea of using the story for an animated film after the completion of The Jungle Book and the script work for this version began in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, Walt sent Ken Anderson to take another look at still-unfinished Aristocats project and see whether it would be suitable for a feature after all. Working with the future director, Wolfgang Reitherman, Anderson simplified the material into a story which focused more heavily on the cats than the humans, creating a series of preliminary sketches to show to Walt. It was these sketches which led to Walt approving the film’s production that year, just months before his passing in December.\n\nHowever, the story gradually drifted away from the one Walt had shown interest in, with focus moving away from the kittens and their fates and onto Duchess and O’Malley. Tytle, disappointed with the direction the film took, later said that “the resulting film lost the very element we tried to build, the Parisian atmosphere and characters, all the French charm. I honestly think the original story that Walt bought was much better.” Whether or not this is true will never be known; we can only judge the film we have today for what it is, so let’s get started.\n\n(One other little note: the film bears no relation to the similarly-titled Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies short, The Aristo-Cat, from 1943, just to prevent any confusion!)\n\nCharacters and Vocal Performances\n\nAs this is a romance, we have two leads here: Duchess and O’Malley. Duchess is a beautiful Turkish Angora cat who serves a dual role in the story as a mother and a lover, bringing a high level of class to both. In every situation under every circumstance, Duchess remains a refined and elegant lady with a cool, collected personality; she is never panicky and never loses control, even when she wakes up in a storm in the middle of nowhere. Her first priority is her family (human and feline) and their welfare, so no matter how great the allure of her budding romance might be, she never wavers from her goal of getting her children safely home and reuniting with her mistress. All of these are admirable traits and as a character she is strongly reminiscent of Lady from Lady and the Tramp (1955), but there are some significant differences between the two.\n\nLady was very much the ingénue, a naïve and sheltered pet who knew little of the world outside her neighbourhood – her struggle to accept Tramp’s “Casanova” past shows off her point of view quite clearly. Duchess, on the other hand, when confronted with a similar roguish type, catches on to his little games almost immediately; she may be genteel, but she ain’t no fool. Her more streetwise nature forces O’Malley to treat her with more respect, as he quickly realises that it will take more than idle flattery to pique her interest. Duchess’s maturity shows in other ways, too; despite the drastic change from her usual lifestyle, she adapts quickly to the situation she finds herself in and even seems to be enjoying the journey (Lady in similar circumstances is obviously uncomfortable and completely out of her element). Unfailingly polite, she also shows genuine enthusiasm when O’Malley rather nervously introduces her to his “Scat pack” of friends, with not a hint of the snobbishness that a character like this could so easily have been stuck with.\n\nIt’s interesting to wonder about her past, especially where she got her three kittens from; there is fan speculation that they must have come from at least two different fathers due to their colouring, but I don’t know enough about genetics to get into all that. If she were human, she would be a “single mum,” perhaps with a divorce behind her and probably well into her thirties (as opposed to Lady, who seemed more like a twenty-something debutante in a dog’s body). Her voice, provided by the youngest of the Gabor sisters, Eva, is perfect for the character – the soft, silky tone mixed with Gabor’s charming accent is gorgeous (even if it’s not a French accent). In a period of Disney animation dominated by male characters, it’s great to get a truly likeable female lead like Duchess here.\n\nOur male lead, Thomas O’Malley (aka Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O’Malley the Alley Cat!) is also derivative of an earlier character, but to a greater degree than Duchess. As the second Disney character to be voiced by the fantastic Phil Harris, O’Malley is enjoyable but nearly identical to Baloo from The Jungle Book, with the same kind of story arc except that it is now romantic rather than platonic.\n\nLike the loveable bear, O’Malley starts out as a fast-talking, easy-going drifter with no responsibilities, living the “easy” life and presumably playing fast and loose with various country gals. The only real difference between the characters is that unlike Baloo, who was surrounded by male characters, O’Malley gets to enjoy a romantic encounter with a woman. It shows us another side to this character as he first tries lavishing Duchess with compliments (he later seems surprised to find how accurate these are once he begins paying attention to her), before realising that it will take more than that to impress her and deciding to try and follow through on his many promises. For all his sleaziness, he does have a good heart and despite initially balking at the fact that she already has children, he soon warms up to them and doesn’t hesitate to risk his life for Marie multiple times.\n\nAs the story goes on, he develops real feelings for Duchess and starts to feel more like Tramp than Baloo, as he tries to convince her to give him and his lifestyle a chance. In a scene which is almost exactly the same as the one in the earlier film, Duchess regretfully tells O’Malley that she can’t leave her human mistress, although without the added responsibility of caring for a baby the scene loses some of its impact here. Once they get back home and confront Edgar, O’Malley’s bravery and resourcefulness shine through and he manages to overcome the butler with the help of his friends, before finishing the film as “new money” much like Tramp did. As the hero of the story, he works fairly well – I actually found him a bit more likeable and genuine than Tramp, as he seems older and more stable; I couldn’t help feeling like Tramp was too young and reckless to really make anything of his relationship with Lady.\n\nAccording to the director, Reitherman, O’Malley’s personality was supposed to be based on Clark Gable (a famous romantic hero of Hollywood’s Golden Age) whereas Baloo had been more of a Wallace Beery, but it really is difficult to distinguish the personalities of the two. They might feel different because we never get to see what Baloo’s like with the ladies, but it’s pretty easy to imagine him being just like O’Malley, should a sexy sloth bear happen to wander into his midst. Still, the casting of Phil Harris was apparently Walt’s doing, one of his last casting decisions in 1966, and I for one don’t begrudge his appearance here as he does add a lot of fun and charm to the character with his vocal work. Now whether it was necessary to cast him a third time as an even closer carbon copy of Baloo in the next film is another question entirely…\n\nFor the kittens, names were taken from famous figures in French history – Post-Impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Romantic composer Hector Berlioz (in the Italian dub the two became Bizet and Matisse; I like that they each embody the talent of their respective namesakes), and Queen Marie Antoinette. Toulouse and Marie have the most character of the kittens while Berlioz is a bit more generic, but all three are given more character than the Dalmatian puppies had – Disney really knew how to make child characters realistic when they paid them enough attention, by not shying away from depicting their flaws.\n\nMarie (let’s admit it) is a bit spoiled and bratty, rightly labelled by her brothers as a “tattle-tale,” but she’s also a budding romantic who particularly enjoys her mother’s new boyfriend and his various corny pickup lines. She’s rather cocky and self-assured, which often leads her into trouble as she is nearly always the kitten in peril that must be saved by O’Malley. Toulouse is similarly boisterous and overconfident, but in a more traditionally “boyish” way – he likes to fight and chafes against his refined upbringing, taking to O’Malley immediately as a sort of mentor. Actually, both Marie and Toulouse serve as prototypes of Duchess and O’Malley, which might be why poor Berlioz seems to be given so little to do. Berlioz appears to be the more introverted one and does not warm up to O’Malley quite as quickly as his brother and sister, but he still gets his share of cute scenes and takes part in the big number at O’Malley’s “pad.”\n\nEdgar Balthazar (yes, that’s his last name apparently) is the closest thing we have to an antagonist here, but despite fulfilling the role he is definitely one of Disney’s least memorable or effective villains. The problem is that his motives are too sympathetic, so the supposed “evil” of his acts is undercut by the totally understandable reasons he has for committing them. After working for what we can assume was most of his life for Madame Bonfamille, he is reasonably distraught to learn that she is planning to leave everything she has to her cats. With no living relatives and only elderly friends, it would be quite natural for her to leave at least some of her possessions to her loyal butler, but no!\n\nAdmittedly, giving a villain sympathetic motives can sometimes help the character by adding layers of complexity and making them seem more “human,” but in Edgar’s case, his “villainy” is further undermined by his weak and bumbling personality. He never seems to pose any real threat to the cats, seemingly reluctant to actually kill them (we’ll get to the sleeping pills later…) and instead trying only to get them far enough away that they can’t come back and “claim” the fortune.\n\nWhen you think about it, Edgar’s plan is flawed from the very start; he’s basically just making it up as he goes along! For starters, why should the issue of the will be any immediate concern of his? Madame Bonfamille seems to be in excellent health so she presumably won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. And what does he think the cats are going to do with the money? At most, Madame Bonfamille could only stipulate that a certain sum of her money go towards the cat’s care, which Edgar, as the butler, must surely already be doing – would it not be easier to simply continue to keep the cats and enjoy the rest of his inheritance? Heck, he could even just kill them after the Madame dies! Instead, he mistakenly assumes that the cats will each live nine literal lives and that they will do so one after the other, which of course would prevent him from ever getting to the fortune and sends him into a fluster, pushing him into a role that he’s clearly not suited to.\n\nAs a butler and a person, Edgar doesn’t seem like a particularly bad guy. He’s far too incompetent to ever be a serious villain at any rate, but his “crime” here seems to be simple impatience (albeit with a bit of greed thrown in for good measure). Perhaps he would have come across with more presence had the filmmakers gone with their original plan of casting Boris Karloff (aka the original Frankenstein’s monster) as the butler, but sadly Karloff passed away almost two years before the film’s release. Over the course of the film, Edgar gradually seems to lose his grip on his sanity until he’s obsessed with doing the cats in, but this still doesn’t merit his rather dark fate of getting locked in a trunk, where he probably suffocated to death. Yikes!\n\nIn the supporting cast, we must first take a look at the cats’ friend Roquefort (a play on the cheese… you know, because mice love cheese?), who makes for another great role for Sterling Holloway. Holloway was pushing sixty-six by the time this film came out, but you’d never know it from the amount of energy he manages to bring to the character. Although Roquefort, as a mouse, might seem like an odd companion for a group of cats (and an inclusion which Tytle was unhappy with), he proves to be a brave and determined friend, as we see him rushing straight out into a storm to search for them and even facing alley cats to get help.\n\nI feel like he was probably added in deliberately to highlight the unusual lifestyle of the fancy felines, who would normally be his arch enemies but are so comfortable here that they have no need to chase mice. As with most of Holloway’s characters it is his voice acting which makes Roquefort memorable, as he manages to get several good one-liners in here and there and delivers the part with his typical comic understatement and gentility. That said, I can’t help questioning exactly what Roquefort’s function in the plot is: when you think about it, he doesn’t really affect anything much until the climax, where he’s responsible for fetching the Scat pack, but O’Malley could have done this himself if he had to. It doesn’t really matter though; among the film’s many “extra” characters, Roquefort is one of the more appealing.\n\nWhen it came to the Scat cats, for the second time Disney were forced to replace Louis Armstrong with a substitute, in this case Scatman Crothers, who was instructed to imitate “Satchmo” as closely as possible (Armstrong had to back out of the project due to illness and would sadly pass away less than a year after the film’s release). The band are only ever seen as a group and feature in just two scenes – the big song Everybody Wants to be a Cat and the final fight – so it’s difficult to talk about them as individuals.\n\nScat Cat himself seems like a slightly older version of O’Malley, but is more charming than sleazy and apparently good with kids. His trumpet playing is certainly impressive, Satchmo or no Satchmo! The others, who are named Shun Gon (Chinese), Hit Cat (English), Peppo (Italian) and Billy Boss (Russian) are little more than cultural stereotypes – Shun Gon being a particularly offensive one – but they’re likeable enough and are quick to rush to their friend’s aid near the end. I also have to give a shout out to Billy Boss for being voiced by the awesome Thurl Ravenscroft; that guy had such a masterful voice!\n\nFor the two farm dogs who menace Edgar on his mission to dispose of the cats, the names of two famed French generals were borrowed – Napoleon Bonaparte and Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de Lafayette. (Why this was done I’m not sure, as the characters here don’t come across as especially militaristic, but whatever: they sound nice and French). Among the many comic side characters these two are definitely my least favourites because they just feel so superfluous to the plot.\n\nNapoleon is a rather haughty and bossy bloodhound who spends much of his time ordering his friend Lafayette, a Basset hound, about and setting upon passing strangers. When Edgar tries to dump the cats near their farm and then later returns to retrieve some lost property, the dogs engage with him in several extended scenes of gaggery which I think run on far too long. The pair of them never meet the cats themselves or engage with any other character but Edgar, so I can only assume they were added in as pure filler to pad out the film’s run-time.\n\nI’ve said in past reviews that I don’t care for long scenes full of gags and this film is no exception; the only gag I liked was Napoleon’s ultra-acute sense of hearing, which allows him to deduce whole lists of improbable details from the tiniest sounds, but that’s about it. For some reason, the two of them make a last, random appearance at the very end of the film, howling along to a song sung by characters they’ve never met, before breaking the fourth wall to announce the film’s ending. To put it bluntly, these characters didn’t need to be here and add nothing to the film but a mild sense of frustration.\n\nI much prefer the family of British geese that the cats encounter in the middle of their journey back to Paris. Although they, too, are somewhat unnecessary to the plot, they are far more enjoyable as characters and fit into the overall narrative much better. Abigail and Amelia Gabble are a pair of delightfully stuffy upper-class English ladies who are apparently undertaking a walking tour of France, during which they spot O’Malley (who has just dived into a river to save Marie) struggling not to drown. Mistaking his flailing for an attempt at a swimming lesson, they are only too happy to try and help him out, although they get so caught up in their in-jokes and giggling that they nearly let the imperilled moggy drown after all! Despite O’Malley’s obvious reluctance, Duchess takes to the girls right away and soon everyone forms a group as they head to Paris.\n\nAlthough there is little to distinguish the girls (who state that they’re twins), I love them as characters – they have great chemistry and actually feel like sisters with their bantering, probably helped by the fact that their voice actresses had played sisters before in the Broadway production of Neil Simon’s The Odd Couple (1968). Their interactions with the rather rakish O’Malley are especially funny, as they’re very “prim and proper” and are scandalised at the notion that he might be “trifling” with the equally high-born Duchess.\n\nOnce the group reach Paris, we then meet the girls’ Uncle Waldo, who is a real scene-stealer (seriously, if they needed filler, I wish they’d had more of this guy than the dogs). It turns out that Waldo has had a narrow escape from a restaurant where he was being prepared as the dish of the day; part of this preparation involved “basting” him in white wine, but as O’Malley notes, it seems more like “he’s been marinated in it!” The result is a real treat of a scene, as the tipsy goose waddles about all over the pavement while his nieces and the cats look on with stifled amusement and try to keep him quiet. After the three birds stagger out of the film, we don’t see them again until the end when they make a brief reappearance with everyone else at the end for the reprise of Everybody Wants to be a Cat, but in their brief appearances they manage to leave quite an impression and were a highlight of the film for me.\n\nThe only other animal character of significance is Frou-Frou, Madame Bonfamille’s horse who functions as a sort of partner and friend for Roquefort in the absence of the cats and delivers the final blow to Edgar in the big fight, but there’s not really any more to be said about her than that. Her main purpose (aside from transportation) seems to be to provide Edgar with a “blank slate” to reveal his plan to, thus accidentally revealing it to Roquefort (who is eavesdropping) as well.\n\nApart from Edgar, the human characters include his employer, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her friend and attorney, Georges Hautecourt. Adelaide is a rather eccentric lady who clearly has a thing for cats, but she is also elegant and lovely in her old age and is clearly a kindly pet-owner and employer. You have to give her credit – for a woman in her seventies or eighties she looks fabulous (apparently she was once a performer, which leads to all sorts of intriguing thoughts about her past… she says that her favourite role was in Carmen, which first opened in Paris in 1875). Despite the fact that all her relatives are gone, she seems to be happy and comfortable with her life, although a cut song (which I’ll discuss below) was going to underline how important her cats are to her in preventing loneliness. Notably, it is her decision to leave her property to her cats which sparks off the film’s plot, as it incites the wrath of her butler, although she never does find out about any of that. Apparently, she was originally supposed to be played by the great opera singer Françoise Rosay (who was pushing eighty in 1970), but for whatever reason this didn’t end up happening.\n\nHer friend Georges Hautecourt has a great little role, packing a lot into his brief scenes and demonstrating a remarkable energy for someone over eighty! Much like Uncle Waldo, he’s an entertaining screen presence and could have done with a few more scenes; I love his first appearance as he zooms up to the mansion in an old-fashioned car and then rides the beleaguered Edgar like a mule up the stairs, declaring that elevators are for “old people”. His relationship with Adelaide is sweet and there is some more good chemistry between them; you can tell they’ve been friends for a long time, although I do wonder how Georges ever ended up in a career related to law – it would be more believable that they met in the world of the theatre, given his flamboyance!\n\nAnimation\n\nThis film featured work from five of the Nine Old Men, including the last animation by Eric Larson, who then stepped down to focus on training the new recruits coming to the studio around that time. This is probably the sketchiest-looking of the Xerox films; at times, you can actually see the rough pencil lines of the artists flickering across the characters as they move around, an effect which you’ll either like or loathe, depending on your taste (I don’t mind it personally; it has a certain charm to it).\n\nKen Anderson spent eighteen months on the character designs and in most cases they look terrific; Georges, Adelaide and Edgar are all highlights with their expressive faces, as are the Gabble family. O’Malley, however, does suffer a bit from looking too much like Baloo, in everything from his broad, good-natured face to his stocky, slightly pudgy body.\n\nLike many of these Xerox era films, the character animation is the highlight – Georges, Edgar and the kittens in particular are all given plenty of life and energy. That said, the animation on offer here is certainly not among Disney’s best, as this whole era was characterised by a kind of cheapness due to various financial difficulties (which only increased after the loss of Walt). As with every other film from this period, there is a fair bit of recycling (a problem which only got worse in the next film) and there are several noticeable mistakes here and there, such as characters occasionally missing pupils in some frames. The animation of the cats and geese walking along in “V” formation doesn’t mesh very well with the backgrounds, either, with the characters simply being “copied and pasted” from their countryside setting to a Parisian street without changing appearance at all. The animation of the piano keys in the various music scenes is generally in sync, but the notes being played don’t always match the keys being hit (often, you hear the correct notes but in a higher key than what we can see being played by the character).\n\nPlot\n\nInterestingly, since the plot was largely the work of Tom McGowan in collaboration with Tom Rowe and was not based on an existing classic, this is a fairly original story compared to most other Disney films. Then again, it’s also very derivative – as I’ve already mentioned above, it bares more than a passing resemblance to the plot of Lady and the Tramp, with hints of Dalmatians and Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (1597) as well.\n\nThe idea of setting it in Paris was Harry Tytle’s, as he felt that the London setting of Dalmatians had added greatly to that film’s atmosphere (as you saw in my introduction, he would lament the loss of this same atmosphere here following the substantial changes). Director Reitherman ultimately abandoned the more emotionally-charged story of Duchess’s attempts to find suitable families to adopt her kittens and nurture their creative talents, suggesting an alternative film with more of an “adventure-comedy” feel like Dalmatians. Since we’re unable to see the alternative film, we’ll never know for sure whether this decision was the right one or not, but I don’t think the film suffers too much from being so drastically reworked – at the very least, it’s still a pleasant enough film, even if it’s being held back from greater heights by the change in genre.\n\nA character called Elmira, who was going to be a maid working alongside Edgar and would be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed for pacing reasons, leaving Edgar as the rather inept central villain. As I said above, you sympathise far too much with him for this to work properly – although kidnapping someone’s beloved pets and leaving them to fend for themselves in the middle of nowhere is certainly a despicable act, we can’t overlook the fact that Adelaide is a bit of a “crazy cat lady” stereotype who overlooks her human servant for her animals, and even ends up opening her whole house to the alley cats of Paris. Still, it is Edgar’s own foolishness which leads to the whole mess in the first place, as he doesn’t seem to stop to consider what leaving everything to the cats would actually mean; Adelaide would likely just set up some sort of pet trust with him as the trustee, so he would still benefit greatly from the arrangement and has no real need to try and get them out of the picture.\n\nThere’s also a pretty major plot hole in the film which adds an unintentional amount of evil to Edgar’s character, when we see him drugging the cats (and Roquefort, by mistake) with sleeping pills in order to sneak them out of the house. This sequence is decidedly more sinister when you watch it as an adult, as you realise that he’s loaded that cream with enough pills to kill a man, never mind a cat! Seriously, the guy just dumps an entire bottle full of the things into a fairly shallow dish, but what would amount to a suicidal overdose if consumed by a human only seems to give the cats a bit of a headache! And don’t even get me started on the mouse… Roquefort should have suffered much worse than a hangover, even with just a small taste of the cream. As a further problem, most adult cats are lactose intolerant, so even the cream itself could be lethal! This whole scene just doesn’t make sense; in reality, those cats are dead before they even get to the countryside.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the scenes with Napoleon and Lafayette also run on far too long and make for obvious filler, creating the only real pacing problem in an otherwise fairly smooth film. Luckily, these scenes are balanced out somewhat by those with the geese, who are a real scream! (Apparently, the filmmakers deliberately added extra dog scenes because they enjoyed the voice acting so much; fair enough, but this is a clear example of a time when they should have overridden their personal feelings for the sake of making the film better).\n\nCinematography\n\nThe Aristocats is a period piece, set in 1910, and I do like the various touches of history they managed to work in throughout it, even if there are a few anachronisms as well. We see a lot of old-fashioned hand-cranked cars and trucks, with some of them proving to be more accurate for the time period than others: on further investigation, I found out that the milk truck is modelled on a Ford Model BB from the early 1930s, while the removal truck at the end (which was lifted from Dalmatians) was from the Morris-Commercial FE Series from 1955. Georges’ car, on the other hand, looks like a more appropriate 1910 Mercer Model C Speedster – I love that he’s “modern” enough in his eighties or nineties to have made the transition from horses to cars, long before most other people had done so.\n\nThe Métro and the Eiffel Tower are also period-appropriate features of Paris (opening in 1900 and 1889, respectively), as is Edgar’s motorcycle, with the first mass-produced models appearing in 1894. On the other hand, the presence of modern-style traffic lights in the city at that time isn’t quite right; those were first introduced in Ohio in 1914. There is also a slight mistake in the label on the trunk which Edgar tries to lock the cats in, which lists Timbuktu as being part of “French Equatorial Africa”: the city at that time was actually a part of French West Africa, in the colony of Upper Senegal and Niger, although it was still a clever usage of the standard “Timbuktu” reference as a random faraway place – at least it actually does make some kind of sense for Edgar to try and send the cats there, as it was French-governed at the time! I did also enjoy the funny little expression “bumbershoot” to describe an umbrella, an old slang term which combined the word with “parachute.”\n\nThe film is set towards the end of Western Europe’s Belle Époque period and the backgrounds of Paris look suitably tasteful and resplendent. Madame Bonfamille’s house in particular looks incredible, with many of the film’s prettiest shots featuring it:\n\nThe backgrounds of the countryside are nice enough, too, if a little generic; the windmill on the dogs’ farm reminded me a lot of the one in The Old Mill, the pioneering Disney short that used the multiplane camera so effectively in 1937. Unfortunately, there’s little of that kind of expensive camerawork here, with the film being shot in a largely straightforward style that had become the norm for the studio in those difficult times. The train crossing scene stands out for its tight editing and use of dramatic close-ups to express the emotion of the cats more creatively (preceding a similar scene in Stand By Me by sixteen years), and Everybody Wants to be a Cat dips into that late-sixties psychedelia with its wild and bold use of colour.\n\nThere are a few fun little gags which stood out because of their basis in reality, such as the geese insisting on walking in a “V” formation of the sort used by the birds in their autumnal migrations, but undoubtedly the best is the one with a random Frenchman who, sitting outside a café with a bottle of wine, suddenly spots the Scat pack dashing by pursued by Roquefort in his little Sherlock Holmes outfit – the wide-eyed man looks at his bottle in shock, then proceeds to empty it onto the street with a look of “that’s enough for me.”\n\nSoundtrack\n\nGeorge Bruns, by this time a Disney stalwart, incorporated some French-style dance music into the score along with his usual jazz influences (the latter feels a bit anachronistic here given the setting, but I’m only nit-picking). The songs were the last to be written for a Disney animated feature by the Sherman Brothers, who grew frustrated with the management of the studio after Walt’s death (they weren’t the only ones) and did not return until The Tigger Movie in 2000. Part of their annoyance was probably due to the fact that all but two of their songs were cut from the film, a problem they’d encountered before – in this case, only the title song and Scales and Arpeggios were kept.\n\nThe title song actually has a rather interesting story to it. It was sung by French legend Maurice Chevalier, who came out of retirement especially to perform it – Richard Sherman performed a demo of it imitating Chevalier’s voice, and Bill Anderson appealed to him personally. To everyone’s surprise, he agreed to do it, mainly as a favour to Walt whom he was said to admire, and apparently Chevalier imitated Richard Sherman’s imitation of himself when performing it! The recording was done in Paris and is deliciously French-flavoured with its Musette de cour backing (the instrument which sounds like an accordion). The filmmakers were obviously proud of his involvement, because he’s credited before anyone else involved with production! Strangely, despite this, his version was missing from the soundtrack album.\n\nIn his scenes, Georges Hautecourt briefly sings a few bars of “Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,” which was a popular Victorian-era music hall tune – a small but appreciated detail which adds a little extra period-appropriate flavour.\n\nScales and Arpeggios, while not exactly the film’s best song, is my favourite. It’s whimsical and charming with its very “natural” performances from the child actors, accompanied beautifully by Robie Lester as Duchess (I didn’t realise until I started researching the film that this was not in fact Eva Gabor’s singing voice). I have to admit, my musical knowledge is woeful: for anyone else who’s wondering, an arpeggio is apparently the notes of a chord played in rapid succession, either ascending or descending.\n\nThomas O’Malley Cat was composed by Terry Gilkyson (replacing the Shermans in a reversal of the last film production, where they replaced him) and captures the character’s free-spirited nature and values very well, but it is of course also very Phil Harris-y and could just as easily have been sung by Baloo. I like that Duchess doesn’t just let herself get swept off her feet by this little number, much as she enjoys it! This piece replaced a cut song called My Way’s the Highway.\n\nThe song everyone remembers is Everybody Wants to be a Cat (sometimes spelled Ev’rybody), which was composed by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker and moves through several genres, including swing, jazz and lounge. It shows off everyone’s voices in a big set piece (as well as in a brief reprise at the end which features some odd cameos from characters who have nothing to do with the other scene) and literally brings the house down as the cats play it, crashing down through several floors of the rotting building but never once losing their rhythm.\n\nI found it kind of ironic that, much like Bare Necessities, it was once again a Terry Gilkyson number that stood out rather than any of the Sherman pieces. Admittedly with so much of their material cut they were at a disadvantage, but I can’t help wondering if the brothers aren’t just a tad overrated; maybe it’s just me, but I’ve never been a huge fan of their songs, personally. This particular number apparently replaced a Sherman song called Le Jazz Hot, which would have featured more French instrumentation and so would probably have suited the tone of the film better than all that jazz, but still, the song we get is certainly fun, if a little repetitive.\n\nUnfortunately, I do have to remark briefly on yet another of these “racist” Disney moments which crops up during the song. The “Chinese Cat,” Shun Gon, who is easily the most offensive of the various cultural caricatures in the Scat pack, has a few lines where he sings “Shanghai, Hong Kong, egg foo young! Fortune cookie always wrong!” There’s obviously a lot wrong with this; why is it only the Chinese cat who is made to sing a random string of vaguely ethnic words, in a silly “Engrish” accent and while playing the piano with chopsticks? There was no need for this part to be included and I can’t defend it, but at least it is the only instance of such awfulness and is perhaps the last example of really overt racial stereotyping in a Disney film (emphasis on perhaps).\n\nOne of Duchess’s lines also comes across as surprisingly risqué – as she delicately strums her… paws… across the harp, she croons, “If you want to turn me on, play your horn, don’t spare the thought, and blow a little soul into the tune…” This is loaded with innuendo, especially when paired with that seductive expression (this film is like a furry’s paradise). You couldn’t have a line like that in a modern Disney song!\n\nThere were a few cut songs which many fans have suggested should have been left in place, as they would have better explained Duchess’s motive for wanting to get back to her human mistress so badly. Where Lady wanted to go home mainly to help her owners look after their baby, Duchess is simply trying to help her elderly mistress stave off loneliness – the songs, She Never Felt Alone and Pourquoi? / Why?, were intended to elaborate on this, but all that remains in the film is a scene of Duchess explaining the situation more bluntly as we look at Adelaide standing alone in her huge mansion, gazing out of the window.\n\nThe writing is generally decent, especially during the scenes with the geese. I love the sarcastic interactions between O’Malley and the girls, as they point out that they’re not chickens but geese, to which he drawls, “Nooo! I thought you were swans!” They don’t pick up on his tone and begin giggling again, saying, “Oooh, flatterer!” When Waldo comes in, it just gets better – after nearly being killed and eaten, his only comment is regarding the wine he was basted in, saying, “Being British, I would have preferred sherry!” Seriously, that was my favourite line in the whole thing.\n\nAn interesting point to consider is whether or not the humans in this world are able to understand the animal characters; the idea seems to be played with confusingly. The cats communicate in only meows and purrs when they’re around Adelaide or Edgar, as you would expect, but there are moments near the end when the lines of communication become blurred. Roquefort’s yell for “QUIET!” in the barn is met with hilarious silence from all of the combatants, including Edgar, and both Adelaide and Georges are well aware of the music the Scat pack is producing in the parlour at the end. Perhaps it’s a similar world to that of Toy Story, where the animals could communicate in words but simply choose not to, preferring to maintain the illusion that they are “dumb animals.”\n\nFinal Verdict –\n\nThe film, released around Christmas in 1970, was generally well-liked by the public, although it was criticised a lot in reviews for being derivative (with particular focus aimed at Phil Harris’s recycled character performance). Leonard Maltin has said the “worst that one could say of The Aristocats is that it is unmemorable. It’s smoothly executed, of course, and enjoyable, but neither its superficial story nor its characters have any resonance.” Meanwhile, Charles Solomon, writing around its 1987 rerelease, said “even at their least original, the Disney artists provide better animation–and more entertainment–than the recent animated features hawking The Care Bears, Rainbow Brite and Transformers.” The film did especially well in France and Britain (with Marie proving a hugely popular character in Japan, of all places) and it was rereleased twice in 1980 and 1987.\n\nIt got its first European VHS release in 1990, followed by a British one in 1995 and a US one in 1996. Then, in 2000, it got another one paired with a DVD release, and a solely DVD release in 2008 (that’s the copy I have). A Blu-ray also debuted in 2012.\n\nApparently, it nearly ended up with one of those horrendous direct-to-video sequels in 2007, with a story that would centre on Marie and her romance with another kitten aboard a luxury cruise ship (blech). She and her family would then have to take on a jewel thief, or something. Thankfully, John Lasseter put a stop to all this sequel nonsense when he took over as Chief Creative Officer, so The Aristocats was spared this indignity (it’s a pity Lady and the Tramp couldn’t have been rescued from this fate too).\n\nNowadays, popular opinion seems to be that this one is sweet but forgettable; I notice that it’s one a lot of people haven’t seen, with some never even having heard of it. I do understand this – it doesn’t have an especially memorable cast, or music, or anything really, but it does have a pleasant, laid-back atmosphere to it and I think of it as ideal light entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon, the kind of thing you can just throw on and watch without having to think too hard about it. It’s an innocent and relaxing sort of film, somewhat similar in tone to the much, much better Ghibli work My Neighbour Totoro (1988), which also has a gentle, essentially plotless narrative. Like many of these “Dark Age” films, I would say that while this is worth a watch if you have the time, for those of you who just want to get a taste of the best Disney has to offer, this film is probably a good one to skip.\n\nMy Rating – 3/5\n\nReferences\n\nI consulted my own books to research for this review, as well as some standard web sources:\n\nThe World History of Animation (2011) by Stephen Cavalier\n\nThe Art of Walt Disney (2011 ed.) by Christopher Finch\n\nEncyclopedia of Walt Disney’s Animated Characters (1998 ed.) by John Grant\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3891938 – credit for the poster\n\nhttps://www.mouseplanet.com/9084/The_Secret_Origin_of_the_Aristocats – extra info\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocats – Wiki page"
