        "text": "Rest easy, the world is safe from evil henchmen once again. After an exhaustive search, Warner Bros. and DC Studios have finally settled on a new Superman. David Corenswet will be taking on his first major leading role as the Man of Steel in James Gunn’s Superman: Legacy.\n\nSuperman’s leading lady Lois Lane will be played by Rachel Brosnahan, who is coming off the final season of her Amazon hit The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nCorenswet has some big tights to fill in the role that has been played by a host of actors on film and TV … and radio.\n\nThe first Superman was voiced by veteran actor Bud Collyer on the Adventures of Superman radio show that aired from 1940 to 1951. Collyer also was the voice of Superman in the animated series Superman (1941-1943) and the New Adventures of Superman (1966-1970).\n\nThe first on-screen Clark Kent was Kirk Alyn in Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950). George Reeves followed in Superman & the Mole Men (1951) and then was the man of steel in The Adventures of Superman, which ran on TV for seven seasons, starting in 1952.\n\nOther Superman actors include Christopher Reeve, John Haymes Newton, Gerard Christopher, Dean Cain, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill and Tyler Hoeshlin.\n\nSuperman has been featured in a host of animated movies, including the Justice League, and the actors who have voiced those roles include Kyle MacLachlan, Tim Daly, Mark Harmon, George Newbern, Jerry O’Connell and Benjamin Bratt.\n\nScroll through the gallery below to see photos of all the big and small-screen Supermen."
