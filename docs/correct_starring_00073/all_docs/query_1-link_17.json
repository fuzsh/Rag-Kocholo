        "text": "While Edgar is plotting how to get rid of Madame’s cats so he can be the sole inheritor of her fortune, Duchess (Eva Gabor) is making sure her three children; Marie (Liz English), Toulouse (Gary Dubin) and Berlioz (Dean Clark) focus on their lessons. Specifically, Toulouse works on his painting while Marie and Berlioz study the piano and singing (Marie sings, Berlioz plays). Duchess is determined to see her children grow up into refined aristocats and is horrified at the idea of them behaving like common alley-cats (Toulouse idolizes them).\n\n“Scales and Arpeggios” is a simple song that genuinely sounds like something a music student would be asked to perform. It begins with solfege syllables (do re mi fa so la ti) and evolves into a lesson on why students should focus on scales and arpeggios, some of the basic building blocks of music:\n\nDo mi so do do so mi do\n\nEvery truly cultured music student knows\n\nYou must learn your scales and your arpeggios\n\nBring the music ringing from your chest\n\nAnd not your nose\n\nWhile you sing your scales and your arpeggios\n\nIf you’re faithful to your daily practicing\n\nYou will find your progress is encouraging\n\nDo mi so mi do me so mi fa la so it goes\n\nWhen you do your scales and your arpeggios\n\nDo mi so do do so mi do (Repeat)\n\nThough at first it seems as though it doesn’t show\n\nLike a tree ability will bloom and grow\n\nIf you’re smart you’ll learn by heart what every artist knows:\n\nYou must sing your scales and your arpeggios!!\n\nDuring the song, Toulouse decides to get in on the act (having finished with his painting) and jumps down to the piano much to Berlioz’s annoyance (since his brother’s paws are still covered in paint). While Marie and Duchess sing a duet, the brothers quickly begin a musical ‘argument’ that ends with each insistently pounding out their own melody on the piano.\n\nI freely admit, as a kid I loved to sing along with this particular song (I fancied myself to be just like Marie) and I enjoyed trying to hit the high notes at the very end. It’s a short and sweet song that shows Duchess and her children in their element as cultured felines, and is also the last normal activity they experience before Edgar arrives with their specially prepared supper (which has been thoroughly laced with sleeping pills. I’m still not sure if Edgar planned to overdose them so they never woke up or just wanted them to sleep long enough that they could be dumped in the middle of nowhere).\n\nDo you like “Scales and Arpeggios”? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below and have a great day!\n\nSee also:\n\nDisney/Dreamworks/Pixar/etc. Soundtracks A-Z\n\nThe Aristocats “The Aristocats” (1970)\n\nBecome a Patron of the blog at patreon.com/musicgamer460\n\nCheck out the YouTube channel (and consider hitting the subscribe button)"
