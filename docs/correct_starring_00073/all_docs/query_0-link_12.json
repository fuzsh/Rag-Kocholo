        "text": "A live-action movie about singing and dancing cats. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing according to Disney, who will be feline confident that they can turn their 1970 animated classic The Aristocats into another live-action smash-hit for the studio.\n\nAccording to sources over at Deadline an adaptation of The Aristocats is in early development with Peter Rabbit‘s Will Gluck and Onward‘s Keith Bunin writing the script. Gluck is also on producer duties through his Olive Bridge Entertainment banner.\n\nFeaturing certified bangers “Everybody Wants to be a Cat” and “Thomas O’Malley Cat”, The Aristocats was the 20th Disney animated feature-film and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats who are kidnapped by a butler as part of a plan to gain his mistress’s fortune. The film features the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.\n\nDisney show no signs of slowing down when it comes to their back-catalogue of classics. The studio currently has a live-action The Little Mermaid in the post-production tank, while at the same time Robert Zemeckis is busy carving out his Pinocchio remake and the Rachel Zegler starring Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is all set to go before cameras."
