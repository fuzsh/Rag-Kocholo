        "text": "Welding Technology\n\nLooking into the future, our countryâs infrastructure has been crumbling for decades, and a lot of money is being spent on developing alternative energy sources. Welders are a major part of these industries. It does not matter if it is building bridges, nuclear power plants, windmills or drilling for oil. Welders are going to be needed as long as the world needs energy, infrastructure and defense products.\n\nTruck Driver Training\n\nLooking for a secure future in an in-demand career field, with a little adventure on the side?\n\nProcess Operations Technology\n\nThe oil refining industry offers high-demand and equally high-paying positions for process operations technicians, and L&C offers one of the top venues in the country for expert training in this field.\n\nPharmacy Technician\n\nWith the growing need for skilled help in pharmacies across the nation, trained pharmacy technicians are in high demand. Prepare yourself for a rewarding career and earn your certificate in only one semester.\n\nParalegal\n\nLawyers use paralegals (or legal assistants) more and more these days. L&C's program will prepare you for a career in a variety of law divisions.\n\nNursing (ADN)\n\nNursing is both an art and a science. An individual must have compassion, a desire to help others and a commitment to life-long learning to succeed.\n\nMedical Assisting\n\nMedical Assistants provide hands-on, direct patient care under the supervision of a physician or nurse practitioner. Regular duties include checking patientsâ vital signs, obtaining their height and weight, giving injections, performing EKGs, drawing blood, and assisting physicians in many ways to support quality patient care.\n\nManagement\n\nSince an organization requires its many parts to function well, one of the keys to being successful is good management.\n\nHealth Information and Medical Coding\n\nMedical Records and Health Information Technicians, commonly referred to as health information technicians, organize and manage health information data. They ensure its quality, accuracy, accessibility, and security in both paper and electronic systems. They use various classification systems to code and categorize patient information for insurance reimbursement purposes, for databases and registries, and to maintain patientsâ medical and treatment histories.\n\nGraphic Design\n\nComputer graphics are everywhere - in print, on the web, in the movies, television, games, corporate branding, advertising and more. The Graphic Design program encompasses desktop publishing and digital photography as well as 3D image manipulation.\n\nFire Science\n\nL&Câs Fire Science program is designed for working firefighters. Classes are offered at flexible times and at local fire departments as well as on campus.\n\nExercise Science\n\nâFitâ is in. Itâs the operative word in todayâs wonderful world of wellness - especially in light of the rising âunfitâ problems of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nEducation\n\nTo teach in Illinois public schools, students must complete a baccalaureate program at a four-year college or university and then be licensed by the state of Illinois.\n\nDrafting and Design\n\nIf you are looking for a career in drafting for an engineering, design or architectural firm, L&Câs Drafting and Design technology programs may be just the right choice for you.\n\nAutomotive Technology\n\nWe all know todayâs automobiles are âsuper smart,â hence the need for âsuper smartâ technicians."
