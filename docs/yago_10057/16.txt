While details are appropriately hazy, it seems FUBAR’s head-banging duo Dean and Terry will be coming home to celebrate the release of the sequel to their cult hit at the Calgary International Film Festival.

The festival runs from Sept. 24 to Oct. 3 at various venues, which makes it timely for Fubar 2’s nationwide release of Oct. 1. The film festival has confirmed the comedy will be screened.

When Dean and Terry, played by Calgary natives Paul Spence and David Lawrence respectively, show up for a hometown shindig, it will be fresh from their premiere at the Toronto Internatioanl Film Festival.

Eight years after the fake documentary Fubar wowed the audiences at the Sundance Film Festival’s midnight program, Fubar 2 will have its world premiere at Toronto’s Midnight Madness program in early September.

FUBAR 2 was shot in Edmonton and Fort McMurray, is about the boys’ trip to the oilpatch to make their fortune. The first film was shot in and around Calgary and became a surprise cult hit upon its 2002 release.

Spence told the Herald that “things are still in the works” about the specifics involving Calgary. Stay tuned.
