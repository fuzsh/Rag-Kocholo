        "text": "My buddy Mike introduced me to this movie called ‘Fubar’, a Canadian Mockumentary that he makes all of his new employees watch as a rite of passage. The even funnier part is that they ordered this movie and received it 2 years later! He was explaining the premise to me and it sounded like the worst movie in the history of bad movies. He put the dvd in and immediately starting laughing before it even started playing, pretty weird.\n\nWhat I found after watching about 4 minutes of the movie is an utterly ridiculous story of two aging headbangers Terry and Dean(pictured above). These guys do nothing but drink beer, play foot hockey, and grow “hockey hair” aka mullets and beat the hell out of eachother and anything they come in contact with..including Tron.\n\nI dont know how I have missed out on this movie since it came out in 2002, but for some reason it never came across my desk and for that I apoligize to all of our readers! I will post a full review, and possible screenings here in St Louis later..for now hit up Ebay and try to score your own copy of this movie."
