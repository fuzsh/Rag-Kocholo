        "text": "We just wrapped up our annual, amazing weekend in Columbus at the Arnold Sports Festival, filled with great fans and Schwarzenegger encounters! During the Arnold Sunday Showcase, our favorite action hero gave us an update on Fubar Season 2 and his continuation of films.\n\n“We are starting at the end of April now in Toronto, the next season of Fubar. So we’re going to film from end of April to middle of September. So I will be there for four-and-a-half months and it is going to be a lot of fun, but of course a lot of hard work. TV series are much faster than a movie.”\n\nSchwarzenegger then promised to be back in films.\n\n“Afterwards, in the fall, when I’m finished with that, I will start another film. I used to be interested in doing two movies a year. One action movie and one comedy. But now it’s kind of like, if I do one movie a year, I’m fine.\"\n\nWith the success of FUBAR and True Lies, Arnold may continue on with Spy/Action comedies.\n\n“We, Danny and I, would do another movie together but not Triplets.”\n\nRecently the fitness icon told us all about this upcoming movie with his Twins co-star.\n\n“I’m finally doing regularly the things that I was meant for,” an accomplished Schwarzenegger tells TheArnoldFans. “I can do both [action and comedy] and this Danny DeVito project will be one of those projects where you see over-the-top action—James Bond kind of things, but also very funny.”"
