        "text": "This is a remake of the edit from the ground up with a better HD quality source, new and extended scenes, different color timing, and a 5.1 surround track. This will be the definitive version of my Dune edit, so if you're curious about it, I'd wait for the newer version.\n\nSome changes:\n\n- Additional scenes: New/extended dream sequences for Paul, Yueh and Jessica in the palace, Paul is visited by the Reverend Mother, Paul rides the worm.\n\n- 2:35:1 cropping is further refined, now moving within the same shot to keep the framing correct throughout.\n\n- Further color correction and use of LUT's to make the cinematography more cinematic.\n\n- Further soundtrack replacement/additions from Children of Dune.\n\n- Extended runtime of 2 hours 49 minutes.\n\nThanks again to all who have helped put this thing together. This has always been a passion project for me. I've always loved the story and world of Dune, and a proper adaptation has never been done. Even with the new films, it being split into two pictures doesn't make it a true adaptation of the novel. This is as close as it's ever going to get.\n\nA tremendous amount of time, effort, and headaches went into making this edit as great as it could possibly be. I firmly believe that it's as good as my skills will allow. I'm very proud of not just the editing itself, but the way it flows as a movie. My hope is that you can sit down and watch this edit and be so absorbed in it, you'll never think about the fact that you're watching a movie that, technically, doesn't exist.\n\nIt's a 1000% improvement over the quality level of the original edit. Not only is the picture better, but my abilities as an editor have improved significantly since I first took this on. The difference is night and day. If you liked the original version, you will love this. If you never watched the original version, I hope you give this a chance.\n\nIt's not without it's quirks. It's important to remember that the quality of the source blu-ray transfer isn't particularly incredible to begin with. They also had the budget and VFX appropriate to a year 2000 TV miniseries. The costumes, sets, backdrops and even some of the lighting and acting are very theatrical. I look at this as a feature as opposed to a bug. The movie has a very specific vibe and feeling, one that you don't see often anymore. This is closer to a 60's big Hollywood epic than a modern film, and I like that about it. If you want to see a top notch, completely modern take on this, the new films exist. This is it's own thing, and it's better enjoyed if you keep that in mind.\n\nFeedback is encouraged and welcome, and any issues found will be addressed.\n\nBelow information is for the original version of this edit:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal film title: Frank Herbert's Dune\n\nFanedit film title: Frank Herbert's Dune - The Spence Edit[SIZE=+0]\n\n[/SIZE]Date Original Film Was Released: 2000\n\nDate Fanedit Was Released: August, 2014\n\nOriginal Runtime: 265 mins\n\nNew Runtime: 163 mins\n\nTime Cut: 102 mins\n\nIntention: To create a feature film version of the Dune Miniseries that runs at under 3 hours.\n\nEvery shot has been individually cropped to fit the 2:35:1 aspect ratio. Elements of the score have been changed, many subplots have been cut, many obnoxious colors have been desaturated.\n\nRelease Info:\n\n1.84gb .mp4\n\nEditing Software: Sony Vegas, Handbrake\n\nCutlist:\n\nThere's honestly way too many things to note them all, but here's the big stuff:\n\n- Crop the footage to 2:35:1 and desaturate the over-bright colors to make it more \"cinematic\". The film was actually originally shot in 2:1 ratio, so the cropping actually works quite well. Still, ever shot had to be hand cropped.\n\n- Brian Tyler's score from Children of Dune has been incorporated and blended in with Graeme Revell's original score. Both composers are credited.\n\n- New opening credits sequence.\n\n- Princess Irulan's subplot with Feyd is removed. It doesn't really add anything to the story, she's just finding out things we already know.\n\n- Paul is less whiny, less childish. Because this footage is so condensed, I needed to make him a little stronger right off the bat, so we can believe he has grown into the leader he becomes.\n\n- The first act of the movie has been chopped up the most, completely reordered with a large amount of scenes removed.\n\n- The majority of the cutting I did was for pacing and truncating the plot. Though it's still a long film, this length to me feels like the perfect amount of time to tell this story without it feeling hacked to bits.\n\nJust finished watching, I will keep my review spoiler-free.... ;-)\n\nFrom IFDB:\n\nThis may be controversial, and please do not throw stones at me, but I actually prefer the Sci-Fi DUNE mini-series over the David Lynch version. I mean I have read the original Dune many times (and yet strangely, I have never read any of the sequel novels), I own and have watched all the various versions of Lynch's epic, including Spicediver's masterpiece but I have always had trouble with Lynch's vision of the characters and Dune universe.\n\nThus when news broke that Spence was back (!!!) and his return project was going to be the Frank Herbert Dune mini-series, I was overjoyed!\n\nAnd I was not disappointed. This is a very entertaining fan edit.\n\nChopping over 100 minutes and cutting the narrative down to less than three hours, the movie is dense with rich (and only essential) story and moves at brisk, but never too fast, pace. The cropping of the footage to widescreen looked good to me, nothing seemed lost or off center. The music replacement (fantastic choices btw) is very well done and really enhances the epic feel of the movie.\n\nEpic. That is the word that kept coming to mind as I watched this edit unfold. From the new score, the space opera style costumes, the soundstage sets/matte paintings and theatrical performances, this fan edit really felt like (and I mean this as the highest form of compliment) an Old Hollywood Demille style biblical epic.\n\nMy nitpicks are very small... I thought the new opening credits could have benefited from a different font choice... they just did not match or set up the tone of the style and nature of the story. Also noticed the end credits are the French Language version... no biggie. The vast majority of cuts are seamless, though there were the odd one here or there I noticed. A couple of times I thought the new audio might have been a tad on the loud side and could have been dialed down slightly more.\n\nBut in terms of story, I agree with most of Spence's choices. This is not an edit about trying to be more faithful to the book, this is an edit about telling a good story. And Spence does this exceptionally well.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n:thumb:"
