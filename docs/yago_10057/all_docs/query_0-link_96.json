        "text": "Whoa, yeah: the makers of the upcoming sequel to the low-budget, 2002 Canadian comedy Fubar made a brilliant decision when they chose to use the Ronnie James Dio-sung \"Die Young\"—from Black Sabbath's 1980 screw-Ozzy triumph, Heaven and Hell—as the backdrop for a severe house-wrecking. The immense power of Dio's vocal combines with Tony Iommi's skullripping guitar to scream \"Smash the fucking place!\"\n\nCheck out the Pilsner banner that barely survives a sledgehammer attack; I've got one just like it in the basement! And what the hell is that bazooka-like item being wielded at the 58-second mark? Looks like the gas-fueled \"potato gun\" my electrician father-in-law fashioned out of PVC pipe and used to blast confetti at my wedding in Powell River!\n\nFor the uninitiated, Fubar—which stands for \"Fucked up beyond all recognition\"—was a Calgary-shot pseudo-documentary about two lifelong friends, heavy metal-loving hosers Terry (David Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence), who live to shotgun Pilsners and create drunken havoc until \"Deaner\" has to face the terror of testicular cancer.\n\nHere's the Alliance Films synopsis of the sequel:\n\nThe story starts in Calgary where the boys are tired of trying to give'r while barely scraping by, when their old buddy and party leader, Tron (Andrew Sparacino) hooks them up with jobs in Fort McMurray. Before long they are rolling in dough and good times. Flush with money and confidence, Terry starts dating Trish (Terra Hazelton), a local waitress, and things get serious in a hurry. Meanwhile, Dean is playing up the part of the cancer survivor, and upon hearing about the glories of workers' compensation, purposely bungs up his leg in an attempt to qualify. When Terry moves in with Trish, Dean does his best to save his buddy from swapping the banger life for domestic captivity.\n\nFubar 2 opens October 1, and it's \"Newt-approved\"."
