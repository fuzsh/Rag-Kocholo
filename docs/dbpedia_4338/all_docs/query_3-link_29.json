        "text": "Originally Posted by Trimac20\n\nMost of the genres that popular music is based on, or most genres of American folk musics overwhelmingly have their roots in the South. Blues, Gospel, Jazz, Country, Bluegrass, ******-tonk, Ragtime, Cajun Zydeco, Rock'n'Roll, with large contributions to rock and hip hop and rock in recent years. Pretty much all the early genres of American music, and the music which formed and still forms the model for music which is popular all around the world originated in the American South. Even electronic music is largely based on blues/rock styles.\n\nI know the historical origins of these genres, but I'm interested in the factors/causes of why popular music originated from the South. I could write an essay on it, but i'm no expert, but I'll offer a short hypothesis.\n\nI've heard it said that Southerners are artistically inclined people and the South is rich with folk tales and traditions. It's one of the oldest regions of the US, and has a number of diverse influences. From Celtic, British, African, French, Spanish.etc.\n\nOne common denominator is the strong African American influence in the genres. African slaves brought a strong sense of rhythm to music, as well as the chants that later became familiar as the work chants or songs of slaves in the fields, which fused with the strong lyrical traditions of Scots-Irish and Celtic folk music, as well as western classical musical tradition which especially influenced pianos composers such as Scott Joplin.\n\nI think the particular social mileau: the poverty and social disadvantage suffered by both black slaves, indentured workers and poor whites who toiled trying to make a living in Appalachian or the lowlands, as well as the French Acadian tradition, created the long tradition of 'singing away one's sorrows.' Blues, country and zydeco all performed this function.\n\nAnother factor is religion. Although the North was probably equally if not more religious in the early days, it was the South, largely because of the dynamism of both African American and Celtic spirituality, which hosted the most celebratory revivals and church services, with a lot of singing, dancing.etc. It was all a bit irreverent for the sober Yankee. Spiritual themes inspired great music, whether it was in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Delta or the coast of Georgia.\n\nBy the time the war had ended the South had established itself as the major incubator and disseminator of popular music. Much of it had spread to the northern cities, the blues and electric blues to Chicago, jazz to Philly and New York, but the South was still the musical heartland of American music. It was only natural that Rock'n'Roll was dominated by Southern artists: Fats Domino from New Orleans, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Buddy Holly etc.\n\nOver time, as music became more commercialised, places like California and New York became the hot-spots for music, although places like Nashville, New Orleans, Memphis, Austin.etc have never really lost their musical soul and continue to be home to vibrant scenes.
