        "text": "Music is proven to increase productivity, especially when it comes to working on an important task, where blocking out all external noise is essential. While 41 percent of workers say they listen to music throughout the entire workday, only 17 percent of workplaces actually play music for their employees. With the strong correlation between music and productivity, it’s time for more organizations to respond to the evolving needs of the workforce and find meaningful ways to incorporate music as part of the daily work experience.\n\nAt TouchTunes Unlimited, we know a thing or two about music in the workplace. We crunched the numbers, looked at the stats, and are breaking down the top genres of music in workplaces across the country.\n\n#1 Country:\n\nCountry music has long been associated with the grit and grind of the American working class. Historically, country songs became mainstream as rural residents migrated to cities in twentieth-century America and brought their music influences to a wider audience. Unlike folk music, which represents the orally transmitted songs of a community, country music is a bit more dynamic and complex in nature.\n\nTraditional country singers like George Jones and Willie Nelson sang about things the working class cared most about, including failed romances, difficult jobs, family, and beloved pets. Essentially, if there was a topic that could cause worry amongst anyone in the working class, it was a good enough theme for a beloved country song.\n\nWhile many current country artists stay true to those down-home, working-class roots, there is a bit more glitz and glamour in more recent songs, bordering on the pop edge. Our most popular country songs in workplaces across the country include the oaky voice of Chris Stapleton with the two top-15 songs “Tennessee Whiskey” and “You Should Probably Leave.” Wallen Morgan is another artist high on the list with “Whiskey Glasses.” Hit the play button on these songs and feel the mood instantly brighten.\n\n#2 Rock:\n\nResearch shows that employees find conversations more satisfying and meaningful when music is playing in the background. Lively tunes are known to increase productivity and lower stress and anxiety levels in the office. What better way to de-stress than to tackle a task while listening to some of America’s favorite rock music?\n\nThere’s a handful of great hits that made the TouchTunes Unlimited Top 20 list this year, including AC/DC’s “You Shook Me All Night Long,” Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin” and Guns N Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle.” We see this love for classic rock all over the country which is reminiscent of life in the 1980s. Years later, these energizing jams still get us pumped for those big presentations and promotions.\n\n#3 Pop:\n\nResearch shows that 58 percent of surveyed data-entry employees worked faster when listening to pop music. It’s easy to see why pop has such a motivating effect. In fact, more than half of Americans list pop as their favorite genre of music, making it a likely crowd pleaser at the office.\n\nTunes from classics like Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” to current beats like Elton John and Dua Lipa’s “Cold Heart (PNAU Remix)” have the tendency to get us grooving at our desks. They may even cause us to break out in a full dance–who’s to judge? When we feel good, we work better. That’s the power of music in the workplace.\n\nWhile country, rock, and pop music have deep roots in many work environments and have a way of boosting morale, we know that each workplace is as unique as its people, location and community, and the top genres reflect such. From offices and coworking spaces, to warehouses, fulfillment centers, and retailers, music that sparks productivity is all about taste, choice and shared enjoyment–TouchTunes Unlimited users recognize that just because their office jams out to rock doesn’t mean an organization in a neighboring city isn’t checking off tasks to soft jazz.\n\nAt TouchTunes Unlimited, we stay on beat when it comes to helping workforces across the country boost productivity in the workplace. With our customized jukeboxes, everyone gets a say in choosing music that makes them feel most focused during crunch time. You’re one step closer to being a part of the positive change toward a happier, more motivated workplace."
