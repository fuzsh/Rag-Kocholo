        "text": "Over delicate acoustic guitar finger-picking and a lush orchestral score, Linda Ronstadt sings, “I’ve done everything I know to try and make you mine and I think I’m gonna love you for a long long time.” It’s a line from her 1970 single, Long, Long Time, which was her first solo hit. Had she only recorded this exquisitely beautiful and haunting song, Linda Ronstadt’s place in music history would be assured. But this was just the beginning of a storied and wondrous musical journey. Sales of over 100 million records; winning collaborations with the likes of Neil Young, Randy Newman, Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, Aaron Neville, Johnny Cash, Gram Parsons, Rosemary Clooney and Frank Sinatra; shelves groaning with every music award imaginable… Over four decades of music making, Ms Ronstadt is a consummate song stylist who remains one of the US’s most beloved artists.\n\nRonstadt drew from a deep well of influences, ranging from Mexican folk music to Hank Williams, opera to the Everly Brothers. From the sun-kissed country-rock splendour of 1974’s Heart Like A Wheel to the punchy new wave sass of 1980’s Mad Love, the elegant Great American Songbook craftsmanship of ’83’s What’s New, to her Spanish album, ’87’s Grammy-winning Canciones De Mi Padre, Ronstadt’s widescreen musical education played a significant role in inspiring and shaping her career choices. In 1967, the 21-year-old Tucson, Arizona native came to the public’s attention in The Stone Poneys, who hit with Different Drum, penned by Michael Nesmith. Going solo two years later with the album Hand Sown… Home Grown, Ronstadt’s career kicked into top gear. Multi-platinum albums, a raft of hit singles, sold-out concerts; Ronstadt wrote her own ticket, essaying a wide swath of musical styles, including country, pop, rock, R&B, jazz, new wave, American songbook standards and mariachi. The one common thread was her peerless interpretative skills, fearless versatility and hard-fought integrity.\n\nNow retired from recording and touring after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, which has robbed her of her singing voice – she released her last album in 2006 and performed her last show in 2009 – at 67, Ronstadt is content in her family life – she has two children. Her spectacular and rich voice is always on the airwaves, and her new autobiography, Simple Dreams, chronicles her remarkable life.\n\nRonstadt, who authored the book without a ghost writer, writes: “Someone once asked me why people sing. I answered that they sing for many of the same reasons the birds sing. They sing for a mate, to claim their territory, or simply to give voice to the delight of being alive in the midst of a beautiful day.”\n\nRC: What did you learn about yourself writing the book?\n\nNot to procrastinate. I used to be a procrastinator and this changed all that. I wrote every word, for better or worse!\n\nI learned I have a terrible memory and that events are condensed and dates are very fuzzy to me. I’d remember someone dying five years before she did. They say they have been able to create false memories in mice… I remember clearly somebody showing me that You’re No Good was No 1 on Billboard’s pop chart, country chart and rhythm and blues chart. It turned out it didn’t happen and I’ve corrected it in the book. I remembered it so clearly and I think it probably happened but I don’t think it was Billboard. I also remember thinking, what good does this do having this kind of success? Because I didn’t care for the way I sang You’re No Good. I didn’t think the vocal was any good. The success of You’re No Good was not something I was proud about but something I was so disappointed in. I’m not inclined to brag, as you may have noticed after reading the book. I know certain things are important to readers that you need to touch upon, like when you’re struggling and then you have to describe how you came to succeed.\n\nIn your book you state: “Our parents sang to us from the time we were babies.”\n\nEverybody sang in my family. They weren’t doing it on a professional level and weren’t as good as Richard and Linda Thompson’s kids or the McGarrigles, but we sang in tune and in time, and we sang the things we loved. I think it’s really important for people to do their own music. People are very eager to delegate artistic endeavours and experiences to professionals, like we don’t do our own drawing and painting. We don’t do our own dancing. Unless you live in New Orleans, no one in this country dances! It’s a shame. It’s fine to have heroes. It’s good to have people like Adele or Pink or whoever’s a good singer, but you need your own thing too.\n\nDid it take you a while to find your own voice?\n\nAbout 10 years. I started sounding like myself in the late 70s. It wasn’t until I went to Broadway and came back that I really landed on my voice, and oddly enough it was with the Nelson Riddle stuff. I can sing rock’n’roll and I had a successful career doing it but I wasn’t as personally invested in that as I was singing standards. Those songs are exquisite works of art; they’re beautifully crafted for singers. And also, the person that I was and the way that I was raised didn’t make me part of that rough and tumble world. Was I there? Yes. Did I try drugs? Of course. Did I like it? Not particularly. It just wasn’t who I was. You go to where you need to go to get music. I always made sure I had a musical reason to be hanging around and I always made sure I had a ride home. Those were the two essentials! And you get good songs that way.\n\nSinging in private is one thing, putting yourself out there to sing in public is another…\n\nI wanted to be able to do music all the time. So if I had a job at a bank or had a job driving a cab, or teaching English, or at nursery school I wouldn’t have very much time to do music. From an early age, I was able to get paid singing – not a lot of money, but enough to eat. I wasn’t fussy, I played in pizza parlours and beatnik dives and all kinds of strange places. Playing a place like The Troubadour in Hollywood was a really big deal. We probably would have paid to have played there. Now you have to pay to play clubs but not back then; we certainly couldn’t have afforded it in those days. They paid us starvation wages but we somehow got by.\n\nSpeaking of The Troubadour, in the late 60s you were part of that musical nexus which spawned so many artists.\n\nThe Troubadour was probably a less sophisticated version of café society. It wasn’t that unsophisticated; there were plenty of sophisticated people there. It was a café in the true sense of the word where there were a lot of artists coming and going. You’d get something to eat, get a drink, hear a story, and have a soft shoulder to cry on, whatever. People really influenced each other in that place. That was a little microcosm where people could see performers in a small place that was sympathetic to music. After everybody got to be such big stars, we just didn’t influence each other as much.\n\nAll the musicians were surprisingly supportive. I think it shows a lot in the work of the Eagles and Jackson Browne and JD Souther; I knew all of them very well. They really did help and encourage each other. They wrote together and really tried to get the best out of each other and that was impressive because they could have just sliced each other down. I’ve been around situations where everybody was trying to be hipper than thou and pull all of the hip people into one corner of the room and laugh at the people that weren’t hip. There was a lot of that in the 60s, around Bob Dylan and a lot of those English bands. I never bought into that. It was so competitive and all about looking down at other people and trying to make them look bad. Everybody’s in there at some level just to learn and it gets down finally to, “Can you pull your weight? Can you do the job at hand? Can you make up that harmony or that lead lick or figure out that arrangement?” That’s what counts, not who’s hipper. Rolling Stone magazine encouraged that attitude. It was kind of Puritanism and I never liked it.\n\nTell us how you found the Mike Nesmith song Different Drum, your first major hit with The Stone Poneys.\n\nI had records by the early bluegrass guys and there were these New York musicians who loved that music and tried to emulate it, like the Greenbriar Boys who used to travel with Joan Baez. They were wonderful. Their lead singer was John Harold; a good singer. I first heard Different Drum by the Greenbriar Boys and I didn’t know Mike Nesmith had written it. I knew Mike and knew he was a very talented guy but didn’t realise it was his song until I’d learned it and fallen in love with it. That song had something I wanted to proclaim for myself, which is how I pick all the songs I sing.\n\nThe Stone Poneys were into folk rock and I was trying to make sure the song had a little bit more than just a traditional approach to it. Different Drum wasn’t even a traditional song but already they’d [Capitol Records] taken it and made a synthesis. I wanted to make it a little bit more mine and more of that California thing. Our producer, Nik Venet, hired this arranger, Jimmy Bond who’s a darling man, a good jazz musician and a good arranger. But I was just shocked by the treatment they gave Different Drum. I hadn’t evolved that arrangement in an organic way, which was the manner in which I usually approach music. I hadn’t done it with the group but had chosen it as a song for myself and I thought it was a hit. I wanted to recut it but Nik wouldn’t go for it.\n\nWe’d cut it first with just guitar, a mandolin and acoustic bass. I didn’t think that version was strong enough but then we recut it with the orchestra, which was shocking to me. Two takes, that was it. We used players from the Wrecking Crew – Don Randi on harpsichord, Jimmy Gordon on drums. When you had expensive musicians on the clock you didn’t keep them long. Those players in the Wrecking Crew were so good you could book half a session and that would be enough time to get what you wanted. We used them on Different Drum because they were the first call studio guys. I didn’t know that world at all; I’d just come from Tucson and I had no clue. I’d played music with the people that I knew; I didn’t know there were people you could hire. I was worried about it. It’s not that they weren’t good players – my God, they were vastly better players than we were, but they hadn’t evolved along our path. They hadn’t absorbed the same musical idiosyncrasies, so I felt that Different Drum didn’t sound like us. And I was right; it didn’t sound anything like us! But Different Drum was a hit and as it turned out, the way The Stone Poneys sounded wasn’t destined for success.\n\nAnyhow, so I found Different Drum and I also found a bunch of Laura Nyro songs that I wish I could have discovered 10 years later when I actually knew how to sing because I would have loved to have had a shot at those songs. I also found a Jimmy Webb song, Where’s The Playground, Susie, and I wanted to change the title to “Where’s The Playground, Baby”. Funnily enough, the girl, Susie, who the song was written about, wound up marrying my cousin Bobby and she now sings in a band with Bobby Kimmel from The Stone Poneys. It’s so funny how all those things come around but I never did get to record that song.\n\nThe Stone Poneys opened shows for The Doors and you got to know Jim Morrison…\n\nJim was very soft spoken, quiet and very moody. When he was not drunk he seemed nice enough, but as soon as he began to drink he got very wild quickly. I’d never been around that kind of heavy drinking and seeing someone like Jim who had such a personality change when he drank… I was very young and it frightened me. I used to watch The Doors play every night. I thought they were fabulous. I didn’t much care for Morrison’s singing even before we toured with them. The first time I saw them play live was at the Whiskey A Go Go and they had just recorded Light My Fire and it hadn’t become a big hit yet. I was very impressed with the group and said, “They’re gonna be a big hit band!” But to be frank, I thought if they’d gotten a better singer they’d be a much better group!\n\nIn the book, you said you were uncomfortable moving from The Stone Poneys to a solo career.\n\nI never wanted to be a solo artist. I was always trying to get back in a group. That’s why I sang with Dolly [Parton] and Emmylou [Harris] and Aaron [Neville]. I love singing with other people. I can do things with my voice with other people that I could never do by myself. Because whatever the colours and the textures are in someone’s voice, you try to reflect them, you try to mesh ’em, embellish them and augment them. Those all become things you wouldn’t come upon on your own. It’s very intuitive. Art is like water; you’re just kind of reflecting everything around you. So somebody comes in with sky, somebody comes in with the earth, somebody comes in with the flower and you’re just reflecting all those different things. You’re not thinking about it. It’s not a conscious process; it’s a collaborative process. So when I sing with Emmy I make sounds with my voice that I’d never make with anyone else or on my own. Same with Aaron. My God, Aaron got stuff out of me vocally that I thought I could never do!\n\nYour first big solo hit was Long, Long Time from Silk Purse, nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance.\n\nIn those days I chose whatever songs I wanted to do, the label paid the bill and I sang it. If your records weren’t a hit, they didn’t pay the bill next time. I couldn’t get into that way of thinking. I was very happy I got a hit with Long, Long Time so I could keep recording, but I never picked stuff solely because I thought it was a hit. I picked that particular song because it hit me right between the eyes. I thought it was one of those amazingly true songs. Ironically, I ran into the woman that song was written about at the hairdresser here in Marin County! I really like Long, Long Time but I’m not proud of my vocal on that song. But I later learned to sing it better live. Back then I was doing a funny kind of vibrato thing with my voice; it was kind of like a billy goat vibrato and I didn’t like that so much. I listen to songs from back then and go, “Why was I doing that?” I don’t think there’s anybody who does music that doesn’t do that. You look back at what you’ve done and think, “That sounds so weird.” I think of the best Jackson Browne song I’ve ever heard and when I tell him, he goes, “I shouldn’t have written that line that way, I can write better songs now.” Who knows whether it’s better then or now, but Jackson is one of those people who wrote really great songs when he was 16. He wrote These Days at that age; that’s amazing.\n\nHave you always been hard on yourself as a singer?\n\nI’ve never liked any of my records. I hear the vocals and they make me shudder. Three elements go into music: story, voice and musicianship. Some people are stronger in one area than another. I was strong on story and voice but not as strong on musicianship, but I learned. I thought I couldn’t learn because I didn’t “have it”. I didn’t realise people spend years in conservatories honing these skills! I never did any of that. I couldn’t read music and wasn’t very proficient at an instrument; a huge mistake because I could have been. I can pick up the guitar and play it but I never worked at it because there were so many good guitar players around. I mean, why bother? That was a big mistake.\n\nAs an interpreter, what were the defining criteria that compelled you to say, “I want to record that song”?\n\nIt has to have a line in it, at least one line, that just made me go, “That’s exactly how I feel about my life,” and sometimes it could be about the way a chord is voiced in the rhythm pattern. Sometimes it wouldn’t even be about the lyrics, sometimes it could just be the chords. Jimmy Webb is so good at voicing chords in a way that just rips your stomach open. I’d be listening to Jimmy, who I love so much, and think I’ve heard him play so many times and say, “I’m not gonna cry this time because I’ve heard his music, I’m kind of immune to it now.” About four seconds later there’ll be something he’ll weave into a chord and I’ll start crying. I’m not a crier; if someone broke my leg I’d probably spit in their eye but I wouldn’t cry. But if Jimmy plays one of those voicings or one of those ways that he turns a phrase, I just burst into tears.\n\nJimmy Webb penned Easy For You To Say, which you recorded for Get Closer.\n\nI love that song. It sounds really simple and it’s a very simple vocal. That’s the first record I worked on with George Massenburg and he taught me his method for overdubbing vocals. That’s one of the first vocals I recorded that wasn’t a live vocal. With that song I was given a chance to really work on it a little bit. The vocal on Easy For You To Say is all about texture and I could texture my voice to get a really full sound. I was thinking about the sound Steely Dan got on their records – I’m not comparing myself to Steely Dan, they’re much better than me – but I was going for that smooth, uptown sound. By getting to sing it more than once and experimenting with it, I found different textures that I wouldn’t have found just by standing in front of the mic and opening up. So George and I considered Easy For You To Say our first vocal we really did together.\n\nIn the new Eagles documentary, there’s great footage of Glenn Frey and Don Henley playing in your band.\n\nIt was hard to find musicians. Nobody had money in those days so we couldn’t pay them a lot, so you couldn’t hire really good studio players to go on tour. And again, because those session players hadn’t come up on our road, they weren’t necessarily appropriate to our music. So I was always looking for a drummer that wouldn’t just roll over me, that wouldn’t just play right on through the feeling and dynamics. My singing has a lot to do with dynamics and I like more delicate music sometimes ’cos I’m a girl!\n\nAt any rate, I was looking for a drummer and a whole band to go on the road. We walked through The Troubadour one night and there was this band on stage playing Silver Threads And Golden Needles – my version, and playing it so well! I went, “Let’s just get them, they already know our music.” That’s how we met Don (Henley) and we hired their guitar player, Richard Bowden. At some point I hired Michael Bowden on bass, Richard’s cousin. He was a really sweet guy and also worked for Emmylou. We used to call him “Ro-Tel”, which was a brand of tomatoes, because he had a red face. John Boylan and I found Don at the same time. He had already spoken to Don because he’d approached him with songs that he wanted me to record. I didn’t hear a song for me, but I liked his playing.\n\nGlenn Frey was my friend. He was the singing partner of JD Souther who was my boyfriend – I was living with JD. I used to play with Bernie Leadon who was a really good country rock player but he wasn’t available on the road because he was with The Flying Burrito Brothers. So I asked Glenn if he’d play in my band; it was like, if I can’t get Bernie, let me ask Glenn. I didn’t think Glenn was necessarily the right guy but I knew he’d make it more rock’n’roll. So I introduced Glenn to Don and they started working together. When they wanted to form a band, John Boylan suggested Randy Meisner and I suggested Bernie Leadon. We said, “If you want to form a band, work for me while you’re putting it together and you’ll have gigs. When you’re ready to sign a contract you can be your own band.” That’s what happened and The Eagles were formed.\n\nDon Henley said your version of Desperado was the definitive one.\n\nOh no, Don sang that better than I did. My recording of it was awful! Oh my God, the arrangement was horrible. But again I learned how to sing that better on stage: I did it with just a piano and it worked a lot better.\n\nTake us back to hanging out with Gram Parsons and Keith Richards when the song Wild Horses was being born. Gram got to it first with The Flying Burrito Brothers, even before The Stones…\n\nKeith had just written Wild Horses and he’d played it for Gram. He played it that night we were all hanging out together. Gram had already asked if he could record it and Keith said, “Well, I’m not so sure. I don’t know if we’re gonna record it but we’ve gotta keep our songs for ourselves.” That night Gram said, “Oh, I really want that song, man. You’ve got so many songs, let me have that one!” I said to myself, he’s never gonna get that song. I wanted that song too but I wasn’t gonna ask for it. I knew better! As it turned out, Gram cut it first; he was persistent!\n\nIn your book you state, “Being the Queen of Rock in the 70s made me uneasy – I never felt defined by rock’n’roll.”\n\nWell, it was one of the things I did but it wasn’t what I did. When I felt I’d really come home was when I started working with Nelson Riddle and the Mexican band. Those were the two things I thought I did with the most authenticity – that and the work with Emmylou. We were beating the same bushes and really knew how to sing with each other. Emmy makes anybody she sings with sound better. She gives everybody she sings with that incredibly prayerful quality. She has something completely her own. I can tend to disappear more into somebody else because I really blend with them. But Emmy creates a whole new wing of the building. She doesn’t compete with the singer or outdo them. She doesn’t try to take it away; she adds something. That’s essential.\n\nIn the book you say you were best suited to melodic ballads but had to compromise with rockers like Heatwave, Lies, Back In The USA and It’s So Easy. But listening to those songs, it sounds like your heart was in singing them.\n\nIt was, especially with a song like How Do I Make You. I got to do something a little bit more original for myself with that, as opposed to just trying to copy someone else as I did with Heatwave and It’s So Easy. Don’t get me wrong, they were fun to do. But what I really luxuriated in, in terms of being able to find interesting textures in my voice and finding interesting melodies and beautiful harmonic atmospheres, were the standards. When I started singing those, I went into another world. It was fabulous. I felt like I’d been let out of a box. I’d felt there was something more I could do with my voice. I didn’t know what it was but it was always there whispering and saying, “There’s something you’re missing.” And when I started singing that stuff I went, “Oh my God, there it is; the rest of my voice, it’s all there.”\n\nYou have a long history with Neil Young. Share the experience of singing backgrounds with James Taylor on Heart Of Gold and Old Man.\n\nThose were the really early days when we were young and strong. We worked for two days on a Johnny Cash television show filmed in the Ryman Auditorium; everybody was at their best. I think I sang Long, Long Time. James performed new songs, and Neil sang Old Man. When we weren’t on stage we were watching each other. Those were all brand new songs we hadn’t heard before. Neil said to James and I, “Come over and let’s record. Will you come and sing some harmonies?” And I said, “Sure, you bet!” Never mind we’d done two full days of filming with early calls to the set. That’s really hard for musicians to come in at nine o’clock in the morning and work long into the night. After we finished filming we were still ready to go so we went into the studio with Neil and sang until dawn. It was winter and there was this beautiful snowstorm when we came out. We were all sweaty from the studio. We were exhausted but so exhilarated ’cos the music was beautiful. You can work for a long time on music you like. I can’t work for five minutes on music I don’t like, I just collapse. I just can’t do it. My voice just won’t do it. I have to go home and lie down!\n\nLet’s talk about 1980’s Mad Love, which found you dipping into the new wave zeitgeist.\n\nI wasn’t trying to do new wave songs; I was doing songs available to me. There were two new writers, Mark Goldenberg and Billy Steinberg, introduced to me by Wendy Waldman from Bryndle. Mark wrote a few songs for the album, including Justine, Mad Love and Cost Of Love. Billy wrote How Do I Make You. They were younger guys writing songs that I thought were good. I didn’t think in terms of new wave or being trendy.\n\nI recorded them with my band, except we added Kooch – Danny Kortchmar from James Taylor’s band. He played fabulously on that album. Danny’s solo on Hurts So Bad is one of my favourite things on any of my recordings. He gave that record a shape and a sound and an energy that was absolutely new for us. I finally learned how to sing by the time we did Mad Love. I was really starting to get it. Something was starting to click for me. I don’t know if it was that successful of a record but it was when I started stepping out as a singer.\n\nMad Love showcases a wonderful array of songs such as three by Elvis Costello, Party Girl, Talking In The Dark, and Girls Talk. You’d also recorded Alison on your Living In The USA album.\n\nI saw Elvis Costello play at one of those Hollywood clubs in the 70s… I think it was The Roxy. I particularly liked Alison because I had a girlfriend who had just gotten married and was on a rocky path. She’s a really dear friend and I sang that for her. Then I did a few more Elvis Costello songs for Mad Love. I really loved Party Girl. I’m sure to this day people have an impression of me as someone who’s frivolous [recites lyrics], “They say I’m nothing but a party girl.” That song really struck me. I used to sing it until I’d be practically hallucinating. The notes at the end are so high, “I can give you anything but time”, I’d get oxygen deprivation and start to see strange things during that ending! It would take me a while to recover; I’d almost fall over.\n\nYou covers of Elvis Costello’s songs ignited a controversy when he trashed your versions in the press.\n\nHe didn’t like it. I heard later that he changed his mind. I think it’s hard for some artists who have a certain image of who they are and where they fit in the musical hierarchy. When you write a song you have to let that go because it assumes a life of its own and starts growing legs and arms. I think Elvis felt that any changes in those songs would be threatening to who he was and how he was perceived. I was very mainstream so it’s that party girl thing; people think I was frivolous, so maybe Elvis thought I was. My musicianship was pretty suspicious for a long time… he’s a really fine musician and I think that point did not escape him. Hey, I’d have agreed with him! I have great respect for Elvis Costello as a musician. I’m really sad that I never got a chance to record a song that he wrote with Burt Bacharach called I Still Have That Other Girl because I lost my voice. I have Parkinson’s disease. I found out about it nine months ago. I’ve had it for about 12 years. Parkinson’s took my voice, that’s where it showed up first. I was singing and struggling for years, not knowing I had Parkinson’s disease. At the height of my ability, I think I could have sung I Still Have That Other Girl really well. I’d recorded Anyone Who Had A Heart and got a really nice letter from Burt saying he loved the way I sang it. It was really sweet.\n\nBeing diagnosed with Parkinson’s prompted your retirement?\n\nYeah, I had to stop. I couldn’t sing at all. It was like being a water skier: your skis are at the surface of the water and you’re floating along above. But after I got Parkinson’s disease it was like I was skiing and my skis were still at the top of the water but I was underwater. I couldn’t steer anything. I couldn’t control pitch, and I couldn’t control texture. There’s a huge amount of things [your body does] when you sing. The way your larynx makes sounds has to do with repetitive muscular movements. That’s what you can’t do with Parkinson’s. It’s like I can start to walk and my legs will go the first couple of steps but then they don’t want to do it again. It’s like brushing your teeth; your hands will go up and down a couple of times, then stop. That’s would happen with my voice. My voice would start to make sounds, then stop.\n\nI knew there was something wrong and I kept going to the doctor. I saw the doctor who later saw Adele when she had her voice problem. He told me, “There’s nothing wrong with your larynx.” In fact, he said I had the best larynx he’d seen on a singer that had been using it as much as I had. I knew the cause of my not being able to sing wasn’t emotional. So it had to be physical, but I didn’t know I had Parkinson’s. It didn’t occur to me to go to a neurologist.\n\nCan you strengthen your voice?\n\nNo. I did plenty of voice exercises. I just can’t do the exercises to strengthen my voice. There’s just no neurological “juice”. With Parkinson’s disease the brain cells that make dopamine [a chemical that sends signals that enable you to move] are destroyed. So you can’t make dopamine, so you don’t get the neurological impulse to make the muscle move. It’s a drag. I’m glad I can still talk, but I can’t be as expressive when speaking. I’m trying to record the audio version of my book and it’s really hard. I’m missing the whole top end of my speaking voice just like I was missing the top of my singing voice. But I can get my point across.\n\nWhat makes a great singer?\n\nSomething extra. An extra clarity. There’s an extra insistence and an extra sense of desperation and emergency that comes out of what they sing. It’s like the difference between a siren and a car horn. A siren is a whole other thing: you’ve just got to get this guy to the hospital before he dies of a heart attack. A car horn is “Please get out my way, I’m gonna turn left.” I think great singers are sirens. They have an insistence and urgency.\n\nIs there a song you regret not cutting; “the one that got away”?\n\nI would’ve liked to have been able to record I’ve Still Got That Other Girl. There’s also a song by Kate and Anna McGarrigle called Tell My Sister that I know I could have sung well. When I hear that song I go, “Oh man, why didn’t I record that?”\n\nFor a woman with “simple dreams”, your life turned out much grander and richer than you imagined.\n\nI never thought I’d have such a great life. It never occurred to me. My little motto has always been “shoemaker stick to your last”. A shoemaker makes a shoe using a device called a last; I stuck to my last. I was lucky that I had hits, which was surprising to me! I loved to sing and I tried to play music that reflected and told my story and made me feel passionate. That was my main ambition."
