        "text": "Maybe it's possible to think of it as not getting any less popular, but...other things got more popular, with other audiences, who weren't getting served sufficiently at the time?\n\nI was in CHR (that is, \"pop\") radio at that time, and while there was no shortage of \"Southern Rock\" fans, once those who were exposed to it earlier, such as the Skynyrd fan, for instance...they knew where to get it. And, they could, on albums, on tapes, at music stores, reading media, etc. And, now that they knew it was out there, and knew where to find it, radio and television outlets who may have exposed more of it earlier-on, had no reason to anymore. That audience wasn't going to grow, and with the coming of MTV exposing excited audiences to something different, they switched their focus to capture that excitement. CHR turned towards more urban artists here in the US, and the UK artists were getting the exposure of the new MTV styles, so there just wasn't room to continue servicing an audience that had found what they were looking for, but wasn't growing as fast as other genres were.\n\nAlso happening at the time, modern rock was getting ignored by more rock stations, who had tightened their focus to \"classic rock\" - you saw this all over the country, particularly in the smaller radio markets that didn't really have the audience spread to service both modern rock and classic rock audiences. It was simply a matter of courting the larger audiences, and more rock fans wanted to hear familiar, older rock, than keep exploring newer, current rock (MTV \"helped\" with that as well, as the modern rock they were showcasing, wasn't nearly as compatible to the more conservative classic rock audiences, who only stayed around when older, more familiar titles were getting the airplay). Hair bands wasn't a thing yet, and that genre was more of a carrot for female audiences anyway when it DID arrive, so classic rock stayed a male-dominated genre, females gravitated towards CHR and Adult Contemporary sounds, and there was just no audience for Southern or Country rock that they could share compatibly with any of those formats. And in the interim, the British were going through both that mod/ska/new wave phase that wasn't attracting American audiences, and FORGET ABOUT Punk catching-on over here in any real numbers.\n\nSo, the newer flavors of rock being offered from the late-'70s up until the grunge/alternative eras, were pretty-much a \"palette-cleanser\" period for the more traditional rock listeners in the U.S, who essentially hunkered-down and sucked on that corporate rock teat until they gorged themselves. And Southern Rock had no place at the table. They didn't know it yet, but they were about to find a new style of Country radio to pull them thataway, once the Achy-Breaky taught them how to dance, and Garth came in and cleaned-up. So if you were a Country Rock or Southern Rock fan, it was either put on them boot-scootin' clothes and join the ladies, or hang out with NPR until they invented Americana.\n\nThat's the way I saw it from my perch, watching my industry from CHR to Country Radio, where I stayed for about 7 uncomfortable years. I loved the audiences, and yes they were full of a lot of adrift Southern rockers too, but it wasn't my best fit, and I finally found a niche in Oldies Radio (as many older jocks do anyway, duh) that was more fun, and I didn't have to fear I'd get \"found out\" that I wasn't really a \"true Country fan\", whatever they use as a way to \"out\" you.\n\nSouthern rock fans are just like rock fans today...complaining nobody's making it any more, just because they can't figure out, you have to seek it for yourself because it's not gonna play on pop radio any more."
