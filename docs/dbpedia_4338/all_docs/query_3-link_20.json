        "text": "I've noticed in threads discussing these we've started to blend the two and consider them one in the same. They are two separate entities. Where do you draw the line between Southern Rock and Country Rock and what bands or singers would you put in each category?\n\nWhen I think of \"country rock\", I think of the (mostly west-coast) axis of Flying Burrito Brothers, late Byrds, Poco, the Eagles, and the like. These bands were really playing a kind of rockified Bakersfield-style country music. Southern rock was usually heavier, and drew much more from soul, blues, gospel, hillbilly mountain music, outlaw country, and honkytonk.\n\nAcoustics guitars. For country rock, these are essential for everything. For southern rock, they are an occasional change of pace from electric guitars.\n\nSort of joking, but I think it is also mostly true.\n\nLynryd Skynryd is clearly southern rock, but has a couple tunes with prominent acoustics (ballad of curtis leow, a little bit of freebird).\n\nPoco is clearly country rock, and has prominent acoustics on almost everything.\n\nPhilo\n\nThey are two entirely different styles and genres and never the twain shall meet but I've also noticed some people lump them all together. One instrument that will never (well extremely rarely) be heard in Southern Rock is Pedal Steel Guitar I don't mean Dobro or Slide.. I mean Pedal Steel.. big difference. Country Rock has that instrument in spades.\n\nOoooh I love this thread. I like Avery Keen-Garde's Question and I'm also curious what Southern Rock aficionados think of my little group. I pull from both sides of the coin myself and then push the envelop on the heavy side of things here an example\n\nI consider CCR Roots rock.\n\nLittle Feat doesn't really fit into the straight Country or Southern rock category either.\n\nOverall I wouldn't put them under country rock, though I think a number of songs could be picked out to fall under that category.\n\nI don't, personally, think I'd put them under \"americana\" (though wouldn't blink if I saw them there).\n\nRoots? Maybe.\n\nSorry, you couldn't be more wrong. Toy Caldwell's band, The Marshall Tucker Band, used plenty of pedal steel, as Toy was self taught. He also sat in with the Charlie Daniels Band, whose studio albums, and live shows featured Toy often, as all of them were good friends.\n\nFor those of us that were actually there, the labels that are thrown around today are comical at best.\n\n.\n\nCountry music itself has different genres. It may -or may not- use pedal steel guitar. Unfortunately its seems to have devolved (to the casual indifferent observer) as a generic Nashville something or other sound. Country rock is likewise pretty diverse.\n\nSouthern rock draws on a number of broad genres: country, blues, bluegrass, appalachian folk....even blues rock by way of the UK.\n\nCountry Rock stays closer to the basics with pentatonic based melodies and simpler diatonic chord progressions. Southern Rock has the broader vocabulary with jazz, blues, country and rock. For example using a major hexatonic to harmonize the major pentatonic is a Southern Rock trademark. Can someone think of a \"Country Rock\" song that incorporates that? I may be wrong."
