        "text": "(born 1946). American singer Linda Ronstadt was noted for her pure, expressive soprano voice. Her repertoire contained material from new songwriters, helping to call attention to these artists and to establish the new genre of country rock music.\n\nLinda Marie Ronstadt was born on July 15, 1946, in Tucson, Arizona. She originally won attention while performing with a folk-oriented trio, the Stone Poneys, in California in the mid-1960s. Their hit song “Different Drum,” was written by Mike Nesmith of the Monkees. Ronstadt embarked upon a solo career in 1968, introducing material by songwriters such as Neil Young and Jackson Browne and collaborating with top country-oriented rock musicians (including future members of the Eagles). Ronstadt’s album Heart Like a Wheel (1974) sold more than a million copies. It contained the hit singles “You’re No Good” and “When Will I Be Loved.” It also established the formula she would follow on several successful albums, mixing traditional folk songs, covers of rock-and-roll standards, and new material by contemporary songwriters such as Warren Zevon and Elvis Costello.\n\nIn the 1980s and ’90s, with mixed success, Ronstadt branched out. She starred in the Broadway version of the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Pirates of Penzance (1981–82) as well as the film (1983). Working with big-band arranger Nelson Riddle, she released three albums of popular standards, What’s New (1983), Lush Life (1984), and For Sentimental Reasons (1986). Her three collections of Spanish-language songs—Canciones de mi padre (1987), Mas canciones (1991), and Frenesí (1992)—won Grammy Awards. A collaboration with country singers Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris resulted in Trio (1987), followed by Trio II (1999). The latter album included the Grammy Award-winning single “After the Gold Rush.” Ronstadt’s album of children’s songs, Dedicated to the One I Love (1996), also won a Grammy. Her subsequent releases included the jazz album Hummin’ to Myself (2004) and the folk-oriented Adieu False Heart (2006)."
