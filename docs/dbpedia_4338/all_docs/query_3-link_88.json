        "text": "One-fifth of Canadians enjoy listening to classic rock the most, followed by country music.\n\nRock, alternative rock, classical and hip hop/rap are each preferred by one tenth of the population.\n\nLess popular music genres in Canada are electronic music / house music, jazz, heavy metal, and K-Pop.\n\nJuly 28, 2022:\n\nWith the easing of COVID restrictions this summer, music festivals and concerts have been resuming across the country. With people going out to enjoy live entertainment once again, we wanted to know what kind of music Canadians enjoy the most.\n\nResults show that classic rock came out on top. One-fifth of residents identify this genre as their favourite (20%). Second to this is country, with 12 percent of Canadians indicating they prefer this type of music. Meanwhile, one-in-ten Canadians each state that rock (10%), alternative rock (9%), classical (9%), or hip hop / rap (9%) is their favourite. More niche genres among Canadians include R&B (6%), electronic music / house music (4%), jazz (4%), heavy metal (4%), and K-Pop (3%).\n\nEnjoyment of classic rock is consistent across regions of the country. Country music, on the other hand, is more popular among residents in the Prairies and in the Atlantic region (20% each) compared to Quebec, Ontario, and BC/North (8%, 10%, and 11%, respectively). Second to classic rock, Quebec’s top pick is classical (19% and 16%, respectively).\n\nRegarding differences across ages, those between the ages of 18 to 34 are less likely to favour classic rock compared to those who are ages 35+. Conversely, hip hop / rap is most popular among residents between the ages of 18 to 24 and 24-34 (34% and 17%, respectively) compared to those who are between the ages of 35-54 and 55+ (6% and 0%, respectively).\n\nResults are from a survey conducted in partnership between Narrative Research and the Logit Group. The survey was conducted online between June 27 and 29, 2022 with 1,230 Canadians 18 years of age or older from the Logit Group’s Canadian Omnibus. Data were weighted based on the 2016 Census, by gender, age, and region to reflect actual population distribution. As a non-probability sample (i.e., a panel sample where residents have joined a panel to share their opinions), and in accordance with CRIC Public Opinion Research Standards, a margin of error is not applied.\n\nThe question asked was:\n\nWhat is your favourite music genre?\n\nCountry\n\nClassical\n\nHeavy Metal\n\nHip hop / Rap\n\nRock\n\nClassic Rock\n\nElectronic Music / House Music\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nJazz\n\nK-Pop\n\nR&B\n\nSome other genre not listed here (Specify: _______)\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nMargaret Chapman, COO & Partner, Narrative Research – 902.493-3834, mchapman@narrativeresearch.ca\n\nOR\n\nSam Pisani, Managing Partner, Logit Group – 416.629.4116, sam.pisani@logitgroup.com\n\nNarrative Research (www.narrativeresearch.ca), is a leading public opinion and market research company headquartered in Canada.
