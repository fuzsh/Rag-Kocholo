        "text": "Linda Ronstadt\n\nAllmusic Biography : With roots in the Los Angeles country and folk-rock scenes, Linda Ronstadt became one of the most popular interpretive singers of the 70s, earning a string of platinum-selling albums and Top 40 singles. Throughout the 70s, her laid-back pop never lost sight of her folky roots, yet as she moved into the 80s, she began to change her sound with the times, adding new wave influences. After a brief flirtation with pre-rock pop, Ronstadt settled into a pattern of adult contemporary pop and Latin albums, sustaining her popularity in both fields.\n\nWhile Ronstadt was a student at Arizona State University, she met guitarist Bob Kimmel. The duo moved to Los Angeles, where guitarist/songwriter Kenny Edwards joined the pair. Calling themselves the Stone Poneys, the group became a leading attraction on Californias folk circuit, recording their first album in 1967. The bands second album, Evergreen, Vol. 2, featured the Top 20 hit \"Different Drum,\" which was written by Michael Nesmith. After recording one more album with the group, Ronstadt left for a solo career at the end of 1968.\n\nRonstadts first two solo albums -- Hand Sown Home Grown (1969) and Silk Purse (1970) -- accentuated her country roots, featuring several honky tonk numbers. Released in 1971, her self-titled third album was a pivotal record in her career. Featuring a group of session musicians who would later form the Eagles, the album was a softer, more laid-back variation of the country-rock she had been recording. With the inclusion of songs from singer/songwriters like Jackson Browne, Neil Young, and Eric Anderson, Linda Ronstadt had folk-rock connections as well. Dont Cry Now, released in 1973, followed the same formula to greater success, yet it was 1974s Heart Like a Wheel that perfected the sound, making Ronstadt a star. Featuring the hit covers \"Youre No Good,\" \"When Will I Be Loved,\" and \"It Doesnt Matter Anymore,\" Heart Like a Wheel reached number one and sold over two million copies.\n\nReleased in the fall of 1975, Prisoner in Disguise followed the same pattern as Heart Like a Wheel and was nearly as successful. Hasten Down the Wind, released in 1976, suggested a holding pattern, even if it charted higher than Prisoner in Disguise. Simple Dreams (1977) expanded the formula by adding a more rock-oriented supporting band, which breathed life into the Rolling Stones \"Tumbling Dice\" and Warren Zevons \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me.\" The record became the singers biggest hit, staying on the top of the charts for five weeks and selling over three million copies. With Living in the U.S.A. (1978), Ronstadt began experimenting with new wave, recording Elvis Costellos \"Alison\"; the album was another number one hit. On 1980s Mad Love, she made a full-fledged new wave record, recording three Costello songs and adopting a synth-laden sound. While the album was a commercial success, it signaled that her patented formula was beginning to run out of steam. That suspicion was confirmed with 1982s Get Closer, her first album since Heart Like a Wheel to fail to go platinum.\n\nSensing it was time to change direction, Ronstadt starred in the Broadway production of Gilbert & Sullivans Pirates of Penzance, as well as the accompanying movie. Pirates of Penzance led the singer to a collaboration with Nelson Riddle, who arranged and conducted her 1983 collection of pop standards Whats New. While it received lukewarm reviews, it was a considerable hit, reaching number three on the charts and selling over two million copies. Ronstadts next two albums -- Lush Life (1984) and For Sentimental Reasons (1986) -- were also albums of pre-rock standards recorded with Riddle.\n\nAt the end of 1986, Ronstadt returned to contemporary pop, recording \"Somewhere Out There,\" the theme to the animated An American Tail, with James Ingram; the single became a number two hit. She also returned to her country roots in 1987, recording the Trio album with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. The album was enough of a success that she reunited with Parton and Harris for another collaboration, 1999s Trio II. The two Trio albums and a number of unreleased tracks were later compiled into a box set, 2016s The Complete Trio Collection. In 1987, Ronstadt also recorded Canciones de Mi Padre, a set of traditional Mexican songs that became a surprise hit. Two years later, she recorded Cry Like a Rainstorm - Howl Like the Wind -- her first contemporary pop album since 1982s Get Closer. Featuring four duets with Aaron Neville, including the number two hit \"Dont Know Much,\" the album sold over two million copies.\n\nRonstadt returned to traditional Mexican and Spanish material with Mas Canciones (1991) and Frenesi (1992). She returned to pop with 1994s Winter Light, which failed to generate a hit single, as did 1995s Feels Like Home. In 1996, she released the childrens album Dedicated to the One I Love; We Ran followed in 1998. Two years later, Ronstadt delivered the holiday collection A Merry Little Christmas. Another collection of standards, Hummin to Myself, arrived in 2004, followed by Adieu False Heart, a collaboration with Ann Savoy of the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band in 2006.\n\nAs it turned out, Adieu False Heart would be Ronstadts last studio album. She supported it with a tour in 2007, including an appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, and although it didnt rise above 146 on the Billboard charts, it did receive a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Album. In 2010, she appeared on the Chieftains San Patricio album, but a year later, she told The Arizona Daily Star she was retired. Three years later, she published her autobiography Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir and, in its pre-release publicity, Ronstadt confessed that she had Parkinsons disease, explaining that it was a factor in her retirement. Early in 2014, she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; although she wasnt able to attend, an intergenerational all-star group performed in her honor, including Emmylou Harris, Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, and Carrie Underwood. Around the time of her induction, the compilation Duets was released on Rhino.\n\nIn early 2019, Ronstadt released Live in Hollywood, an archival album documenting a concert she gave in 1980 which was originally aired on HBO.

Shes changed location and producers -- Elliot Mazer, whod later be Neil Youngs right-hand man for archival projects, helmed this -- but she hasnt quite thrown herself into the maelstrom of Music City here. Many of the soft, flowery flourishes of Hand Sownâ¦Home Grown have been traded in for steel guitars and echoing acoustics, a move that definitely reads country, but Ronstadts sensibility remains rooted on the West Coast, favoring great emerging songwriters and revived, reworked versions of classics. Only a couple of these are classic country, however -- just Hank Williams \"Lovesick Blues\" and Mel Tillis \"Mental Revenge,\" which are balanced by Goffin/Kings \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"Im Leaving It All Up to You,\" R&B; hits given nice country rearrangements (the latter in particular feels suited to its new barroom rendition). These rearrangements, alongside covers of Gene Clark & Bernie Leadons \"He Darked the Sun\" and Paul Siebels \"Louise,\" suggest that Ronstadts sensibility is a bit more cosmopolitan than country, but thats the great thing about Silk Purse: perhaps she didnt find her voice, not in the way she would a year later on her eponymous record, but this Nashville excursion had a clarifying effect, whittling down the musical excesses and strengthening her aesthetic while winding up a nifty little record in its own right. Album: 3 of 46\n\nTitle: Linda Ronstadt\n\nReleased: 1971\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 31:16\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Rock Me on the Water (03:38)\n\n2 Crazy Arms (03:28)\n\n3 I Wont Be Hangin round (03:01)\n\n4 I Still Miss Someone (02:39)\n\n5 In My Reply (03:29)\n\n6 I Fall to Pieces (03:06)\n\n7 Ramblinâ âround (03:19)\n\n8 Birds (02:58)\n\n9 I Aint Always Been Faithful (02:48)\n\n10 Rescue Me (02:45)\n\nLinda Ronstadt : Allmusic album Review : In many regards, Linda Ronstadts self-titled third album isnt much different than her first two. Like Hand Sownâ¦Home Grown and Silk Purse, Linda Ronstadt combines classic country songs -- Johnny Cashs \"I Still Miss Someone,\" Patsy Clines \"I Fall to Pieces,\" Jerry Lee Lewis \"Crazy Arms,\" the folk standard \"Ramblin Round\" -- with new songs from rising songwriters (Jackson Browne, Eric Kaz, Livingston Taylor, Neil Young, Eric Andersen) and an R&B; cover (Fontella Bass \"Rescue Me\"), but the difference is synthesis. Here, Ronstadt doesnt run from her Californian base, nor does she attempt to fit into the confines from Nashville; she finds the common threads between the songs and sounds, tying together her love of the old and new right along with her love of country, rock, and soul. Certainly, shes assisted by a versatile, sympathetic backing band assembled by producer John Boylan, a band that would later work on their own as the Eagles, but theres never a suggestion that the band is attempting to outshine the singer. All are united by the music, enjoying turning \"I Still Miss Someone\" and \"Crazy Arms\" into country ballads, breathing full life into Brownes \"Rock Me on the Water,\" playing \"I Fall to Pieces\" with a muscularity that avoids overt homage, and reveling in the harmonies on Youngs \"Birds.\" This is music for the dawn of the 70s, music that shakes off some of the hippie dreams of the 60s in favor of lushly detailed authenticity that has an eye on the past while living for the present. Ronstadt might not have wound up with a smash hit here -- \"Rock Me on the Water\" did make some radio waves -- but this is the birth of the aesthetic that would serve her well throughout the 70s, and it remains potent.

Album: 5 of 46\n\nTitle: Heart Like a Wheel\n\nReleased: 1974\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 31:47\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify TrackSamples Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Youâre No Good (03:43)\n\n2 It Doesnât Matter Anymore (03:27)\n\n3 Faithless Love (03:15)\n\n4 The Dark End of the Street (03:55)\n\n5 Heart Like a Wheel (03:10)\n\n6 When Will I Be Loved?

However, Ronstadt comes into her own on this mix of oldies and contemporary classics. Backed by a fleet of Los Angeles musicians, Ronstadt sings with vigor and passion, helping bring the music alive. But what really makes Heart Like a Wheel a breakthrough is the inventive arrangements that producer Peter Asher, Ronstadt, and the studio musicians have developed. Finding the right note for each song -- whether its the soulful reworking of \"When Will I Be Loved,\" the hit \"Youre No Good,\" or the laid-back folk-rock of \"Willing\" -- the musicians help turn Heart Like a Wheel into a veritable catalog of Californian soft rock, and it stands as a landmark of 70s mainstream pop/rock.

(02:27)\n\nDifferent Drum : Allmusic album Review : Different Drum collects the highlights of Linda Ronstadts first three solo albums, adding five Stone Poneys tracks, including the hit \"Different Drum,\" for good measure. It misses some fine tracks from her solo records, but the album remains a fine introduction to her early years. Album: 7 of 46\n\nTitle: Prisoner in Disguise\n\nReleased: 1975\n\nTracks: 11\n\nDuration: 36:33\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Love Is a Rose (02:48)\n\n2 Hey Mister, Thatâs Me Up on the Juke Box (04:09)\n\n3 Roll Um Easy (02:58)\n\n4 Tracks of My Tears (03:14)\n\n5 Prisoner in Disguise (03:55)\n\n6 Heat Wave (02:47)\n\n7 Many Rivers to Cross (04:07)\n\n8 The Sweetest Gift (03:04)\n\n9 You Tell Me That Iâm Falling Down (03:19)\n\n10 I Will Always Love You (03:01)\n\n11 Silver Blue (03:07)\n\nPrisoner in Disguise : Allmusic album Review : Linda Ronstadt followed the commercial and critical breakthrough success of Heart Like a Wheel with Prisoner in Disguise, a record that essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor. While it lacks the consistency of Heart Like a Wheel, its thoroughly enjoyable, highlighted by sturdy remakes of the Motown classics \"Tracks of My Tears\" and \"Heat Wave.\" Album: 8 of 46\n\nTitle: Hasten Down the Wind\n\nReleased: 1976\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 41:49\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Lose Again (03:36)\n\n2 The Tattler (03:58)\n\n3 If Heâs Ever Near (03:17)\n\n4 Thatâll Be the Day (02:34)\n\n5 Lo Siento mi Vida (03:55)\n\n6 Hasten Down the Wind (02:42)\n\n7 Rivers of Babylon (00:53)\n\n8 Give One Heart (04:07)\n\n9 Try Me Again (03:57)\n\n10 Crazy (04:00)\n\n11 Down So Low (04:17)\n\n12 Someone to Lay Down Beside Me (04:28)\n\nHasten Down the Wind : Allmusic album Review : Again, Linda Ronstadt repeats her slick, Californian pop/country-rock formula on Hasten Down the Wind. When the material is first-rate -- such as \"Thatll Be the Day\" or \"Crazy\" -- Ronstadts performances are terrific, but on the subpar songs -- such as the three Karla Bonoff numbers -- shes dragged down with her material.

Ronstadt sings Dolly Parton (\"I Never Will Marry\") with the same conviction as the Rolling Stones (\"Tumbling Dice\"), and she manages to update Roy Orbison (\"Blue Bayou\") and direct attention to the caustic, fledgling singer/songwriter Warren Zevon (\"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" and \"Carmelita\"). The consistently adventurous material and Ronstadts powerful performance makes the record rival Heart Like a Wheel in sheer overall quality.

At this point, her albums with producer Peter Asher became routine and repetitive. This albums predecessor, Living in the U.S.A., hit the cutout bins, so a change was in order. While many may miss the customary Ronstadt here, most of Mad Love does indeed work. The insinuating \"I Cant Let Go\" and the playful \"How Do I Make You\" do help Ronstadt attain a certain cuteness and freshness. The biggest hit, the cover of Little Anthony & the Imperials \"Hurts So Bad,\" has a great vocal and is made even better by Danny Kortchmars emotive guitar solos. While the originals and style of guitarist Mark Goldenberg did predominate, Mad Love is mostly known for its three Elvis Costello covers. Although the often pitch-perfect Ronstadt is more than antithetical to Costellos angst, she more than connects with \"Party Girl.\" Costellos \"Talking in the Dark\" closes the album on an oddly sweet note. The strange thing about Mad Love is that it did include a lot of players from Ronstadts previous albums. Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, Andrew Gold, and Nicolette Larsons great backing vocals all appear here. For the most part, Mad Love stood the test of time and is certainly different from the Ronstadt albums that preceded and followed it.

And it would have been more interesting if she hadnt repeated its formula on her next two records.

Working again with Nelson Riddle, Ronstadt runs through several pop standards -- \"When I Fall in Love,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" \"Falling in Love Again,\" \"It Never Entered My Mind\" -- which are given lush, even syrupy, arrangements. Ronstadts voice isnt entirely suited to this material, but she sings it professionally, and Lush Life is just as effective as Whats New, which means its fine, but not as good as the real thing.

That said, For Sentimental Reasons is notable since it contains a high percentage of familiar -- some might say overly familiar -- standards like \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,\" \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"Am I Blue,\" and \"Round Midnight,\" which might make the album more appealing to casual fans who want to hear Ronstadt sing songs they know if theyre going to hear her in this setting.

She recorded three albums with Nelson Riddle before changing direction yet again, this time recording a set of traditional Mexican songs titled Canciones de Mi Padre. As the title suggests, the record is a fairly sentimental collection, since these are songs from her childhood and her heritage. Occasionally, Ronstadt oversells the songs but overall, the album is charming, affectionate, entertaining, and more successful than her stilted Nelson Riddle collaborations.

While a gifted entertainer, Parton is also a business-savvy professional who will willingly set aside her gifts as a pure country singer if she thinks her audience would rather hear something like \"Nine to Five.\" However, give her a stage for old-school country material, and she will always rise sublimely to the occasion. Similarly, some of Linda Ronstadts finest work was on her early country-rock albums (especially Heart Like a Wheel), but she seems to operate best with strong collaborators; left to her own devices, shes just as likely to pick wrong-headed material in styles not comfortable to her, but in the right settings her gifts still dazzle. And while Emmylou Harris had as strong a track record as anyone in Nashville in the 1980s, its obvious she loves to collaborate with others, and sings harmonies with the same rich and affecting beauty that she brings to her headlining gigs. So you take two gifted artists who need proper direction, team them up with an excellent collaborative artist, and the results should fall neatly into place. In truth, thats a formula as likely as not to fail, but on Trio the experiment works brilliantly. The three vocalists display an obvious affinity and respect for one anothers talents, inspiring superb performances in one another, and while they all shine in their solo spots, some of the albums most pleasurable moments are when the three harmonize, with their distinct but equally impressive voices melding into a whole thats more than the sum of its parts. Harris, Parton, and Ronstadt also make the most of a set of fine songs (certainly a better program than Parton or Ronstadt had taken on in the studio in a while), and producer George Massenburg lined up a wonderfully subtle and intuitive backing group, with Ry Cooder, David Lindley, and Albert Lee picking gloriously without calling undue attention to themselves. In short, Trio is that rare example of an all-star collaborative effort that truly shows everyone involved to their best advantage, and it ranks with the best of all three headliners work.

The album was a collection of well-constructed adult contemporary pop, which suits her voice better than the traditional pop she recorded during the mid-80s. Musically, Cry Like a Rainstorm isnt as adventurous as Canciones de Mi Padre, nor is it as consistent as Trio, the album she recorded with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton, but it is her most satisfying mainstream pop album she has made since the late 70s.

She followed up 1989s hugely successful Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind with two Spanish language albums (Mas Canciones and Frenesi), then returned with the beautiful light-pop collection that is Winter Light. This set finds Ronstadt interpreting such classics as the Bacharach/David compositions \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" and \"I Just Dont Know What to Do With Myself\" with enough torchy bravado to make them her own. Her cover of the Beach Boys \"Dont Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" is an ethereal, gorgeous, and breathy interpretation, and other covers, such as \"Oh No, Not My Baby\" and \"Its Too Soon to Know\" shine just as brightly. In fact, there is not a single dud on this impeccably produced album, which, in fact, gets better and better with each listening. Also included is the gutsy, dramatic Spanish language mini-epic \"Adonde Voy\" and, as the icing on the cake, her own co-written contribution, \"Winter Light,\" a shimmering and heartbreaking lullaby that would fit perfectly in a holiday music collection. This sadly overlooked album is nothing short of a shining gem, and an absolute must for fans of this amazing singer.

Less glossy production isnt necessarily a bad thing, except that the final result is an album that is top-quality but a little bland. Ronstadts voice is nothing short of stellar, and the songs are fine, but there is a certain immediacy that is lacking in this album, especially toward the end, when it just seems to drift. Then again, with a \"down-home\" album, that may have been the point. Regardless, this album boasts her usual array of stellar covers, including her fine, mandolin-accompanied take on Tom Pettys \"The Waiting,\" in which Ronstadts enunciations are highly reminiscent of Pettys. Her rendition of Matraca Bergs \"Walk On,\" complete with Alison Krauss on fiddle, is nothing short of an out-and-out hoedown, and her version of Neil Youngs \"After the Gold Rush\" is quite enjoyable. Five of these songs -- \"High Sierra,\" \"The Blue Train\" (the albums first single, which is pure AC), \"Feels Like Home,\" \"After the Gold Rush,\" and \"Lovers Return,\" most of which feature Emmylou Harris -- all resurfaced on the Trio II album. Just like any other Ronstadt set, this is top-quality material, but one cant help but pine for the punch and perfect production of her previous pop packages.

All of the songs are given lush, sweet, and soft arrangements, even when that approach is ludicrous; it might be a cute idea to deliver Queens \"We Will Rock You\" as a rock-a-bye chant, but in practice it is simply ridiculous. Fortunately, most of the album relies on songs -- \"Be My Baby,\" \"In My Room\" -- that can be sung as lullabies, and she sings them very well. Of course, the appeal of Dedicated to the One I Love is limited -- only baby boomer parents will really find this interesting -- but fans that find the concept intriguing wont be disappointed by the results.

She recorded only two pop albums, 1994s Winter Light and 1995s Feels Like Home, which seemed like diversions from the Latin and childrens records that were occupying her time. In 1998, she returned with We Ran, a full-fledged pop comeback produced by Glyn Johns (George Massenberg, Peter Asher, and Waddy Wachtel also produced a handful of songs) and featuring support from such 70s soft rock stalwarts as Waddy Wachtel and Bernie Leadon, as well as Heartbreakers Mike Campbell, Howie Epstein, and Benmont Tench. The pedigree is in place, leaving it up to Ronstadt and her songs to deliver the goods, which, more often than not, she does. Her voice remains strong and surprisingly robust, and her choice of songs, while not surprising, is quite satisfying. There are a couple of cuts that are a little bland and others, such as Dylans \"Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues,\" arent suited for her polished delivery, but most of the album is quite enjoyable. Its nice to hear Ronstadt tackle classics like \"Ruler of My Heart,\" but the moments of We Ran that truly capture the spirit of Heart Like a Wheel are when she tries contemporary songs like John Hiatts \"Icy Blue Heart\"and Bruce Springsteens \"If I Should Fall Behind.\" Granted, Hiatt and Springsteen are predictable choices -- she could have been more adventurous and sought out songs by such 90s songwriters as Ron Sexsmith or Aimee Mann -- but they are just contemporary enough to help make We Ran a successful update of her classic 70s sound.

But this album, for all its harmonic, sopranic vibrato perfection, is not a glassy ride across the entire lake. Let Linda Ronstadt covet the tracks for her own album projects as much as she reportedly had -- Dolly Parton walks all over this record in true Dollywood fashion, with Emmylou Harris and Ronstadt chirping deliciously behind her. There are plenty of exceptions to this, as \"Feels Like Home\" is really Ronstadts, and Harris treats \"Youll Never Be the Sun\" with crystal, bitter prayer-book reverence. Even contributing fiddles and pedal-steel guitars drop by to accompany Parton without a flaw. It isnt her fault her voice, as distinct as the rarest and loudest bird in a forest populated by rare and loud birds, outsculpts the tone and impact of any song she sings with others. She and the gals score a soaring version of the old Carter Family classic \"Lovers Return\" in a heartbreaking three-parter; the baffling choice to include a Parton-heavy Neil Young standard about the survival and solitude of the dope-drenched 60s, \"After the Gold Rush,\" is, well, baffling. Parton changes his lyrics to say, \"I felt like I could cry,\" instead of voicing the songs former urge to procure some mind-altering substances. In general, a gem along the beautiful lines of cubic zirconium, from the most well-intended and loving of real-deal songbird girlfriends.

Their voices are made for each other in a yin-yang meeting of Ronstandts rich velvet alto and Harris songbird-sweet soprano. The Tucson Sessions takes their collaborations to new heights. A collection of covers and originals tracing various paths of love and loss, the performances seem to have breathed in the desert where they were recorded. Arrangements airy as the space between desert and sky are grounded by gritty guitars, splashed with color from folk instruments and filled with glorious harmonies. Well known singer/songwriters are covered -- Patty Griffin, Andy Prieboy, Rosanne Cash, Leonard Cohen, and Bruce Springsteen. Traditional presentations of Cohens \"Sisters of Mercy\" and Springsteens \"Across the Border\" take on new dimensions as sung by women. The spare arrangement and delicate harmonies lend a wonderful wistfulness to Cashs \"Western Wall.\" A surprising cover choice with beautiful results is Sinead OConnors \"This Is to Mother You.\" The albums best track, \"1917,\" was written by folk singer David Olney. Its impossible to imagine anyone else singing this haunting tale of soldiers and women in WWI. Fragile and breathtaking, Harris voice is buoyed by the angelic harmonies of Ronstadt and Kate and Anna McGarrigle. Harris also contributes, along with some collaborators, three tracks to the album, notably the spirited \"Raise the Dead.\" Album: 32 of 46\n\nTitle: Box Set\n\nReleased: 1999-11-16\n\nTracks: 86\n\nDuration: 5:02:02\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAlbumCover 1 When We Ran (05:08)\n\n2 Ruler of My Heart (03:37)\n\n3 Cry til My Tears Run Dry (04:01)\n\n4 We Will Rock You (01:29)\n\n5 Winter Light (03:17)\n\n6 Anyone Who Had a Heart (03:27)\n\n7 I Just Donât Know What to Do With Myself (03:11)\n\n8 Donât Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder) (03:15)\n\n9 Do What You Gotta Do (03:24)\n\n10 Heartbeats Accelerating (03:49)\n\n11 Goodbye My Friend (03:46)\n\n12 Adios (03:36)\n\n13 Cry Like a Rainstorm (03:36)\n\n14 Trouble Again (03:19)\n\n15 Easy for You to Say (03:58)\n\n16 The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (03:02)\n\n17 Get Closer (02:30)\n\n18 Hurt So Bad (03:13)\n\n19 I Canât Let Go (02:43)\n\n20 Ooh Baby Baby (03:19)\n\n21 Just One Look (03:17)\n\n22 Poor, Poor Pitiful Me (03:42)\n\n1 Blue Bayou (03:54)\n\n2 Try Me Again (03:57)\n\n3 Heat Wave (02:47)\n\n4 Heart Like a Wheel (03:10)\n\n5 It Doesnât Matter Anymore (03:27)\n\n6 Youâre No Good (03:43)\n\n7 When Will I Be Loved?

Highlights include a brassy duet with Rosemary Clooney on \"White Christmas\" and the contemporary \"River,\" which sounds almost like the singer has been listening to a lot of Sarah McLachlan.

They didnt do that for 2002s The Very Best of Linda Ronstadt, but they did follow that basic blueprint very closely, with 16 of the 21 songs culled from her 70s heyday, with the remaining five drawing from her late-80s/early-90s adult contemporary comeback, including \"Dont Know Much\" and \"Somewhere out There.\" That these songs dont quite fit musically with the laid-back Californian soft rock of the 70s doesnt matter, nor does it matter that her excursions into other genres -- her traditional pop albums with Nelson Riddle, her Mexican records, her country albums with Trio -- are missing (\"Different Drum\" with the Stone Poneys is here), because this collection expertly delivers her biggest hits in an enjoyable fashion with very little fat. Those original hits records remain first-rate, but its nicer to get all of these on one disc instead of two.

Riddles satiny arrangements swirled around Ronstadts rich voice as she played the kind of demure chanteuse who might have been headlining at a fashionable nightclub back in the day. The albums were lush and beautifully crafted but by the third album the formula had become tired and the novelty had worn thin. Twenty years later another fading rocker, Rod Stewart, recorded his own highly successful standards trilogy and perhaps it was his success that spurred Ronstadt to revisit the traditional pop catalog once again. Hummin to Myself is basically a throwback to her albums that were throwbacks when first recorded. This time around Ronstadt and arranger Alan Broadbent dispense with the full orchestra in favor of a smaller big band-style combo and this setting actually works in her favor. As a rock vocalist, Ronstadt could growl with the best and there was a certain spark in songs like \"Get Closer\" that let a listener know that this pretty woman had a slightly naughty side. That spark was appropriately missing from the Riddle albums and with Hummin she has a chance to incorporate a little of her rock bawdiness into her selection of standards. She does this to perfection on \"Never Will I Marry,\" as Frank Loessers jazzy tune showcases a performance that is sassy and one of Ronstadts best covers. To a lesser extent, the title track and \"Get Out of Town\" have some zest to them, but even with the lighter arrangements, her reliance on ballads like \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Ill Be Seeing You\" take up the majority of space and bog down the disc. Even her down-tempo version of \"Miss Otis Regrets\" completely stifles the songs comedic, yet tragic, story line. Ronstadt was on to something when she dispensed with Riddles orchestrations in favor of Broadbents big-band arrangements, but the spunk shown in a few tunes isnt enough to fully carry the disc. However, with its different approach Hummin to Myself is quite possibly Linda Ronstadts most successful standards outing.

Apart from Heart Like a Wheel, these LPs for Capitol were not hits, due partially to the fact that Ronstadt was still finding her footing as a record-maker during this time. It wasnt until her eponymous third album that everything began to click, thanks to her finally finding a sympathetic backing band (who would become Eagles not long after this record was cut), and then producer Peter Asher came in for Heart Like a Wheel and helped her find a slick, streamlined variation of her soft country-rock. And while its true that her first two albums sometimes find her stumbling as she tries to blend country, pop, and folk while working with session musicians (some less-charitable listeners might find such period flair as fuzz-toned steel guitar as a detriment, too, although theres a certain undeniable charm to these dated sounds), they have aged remarkably well, warts and all, because they showcase a singer with excellent taste and restless ambition. Ronstadt was never a songwriter, but she had a terrific ear for good songs, choosing them primarily from the plethora of great singer/songwriters who cluttered the landscape in the late 60s and early 70s -- not just Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Randy Newman, but Fred Neil, Mickey Newbury, Paul Siebel, Gene Clark, Bernie Leadon, Livingston Taylor, Eric Andersen, John D. Loudermilk, Wayne Raney, and Lowell George, among others. Her interpretations, while not idiosyncratic, were energetic and impassioned, an appealing blend of laid-back Californian country-rock, folky songs, and pop attitude that was enjoyable even when it wasnt always entirely successful. Yet, in retrospect, especially in the context of this generous collection, the awkwardness of her first two albums no longer seems so pronounced. In fact, Hand Sown...Home Grown and Silk Purse look like flawed minor gems, while Linda Ronstadt and Heart Like a Wheel still stand as high-water marks of 70s Californian soft rock. And this double-disc set, boasting fine remastering and liner notes (which remain good even if there are no details about the bonus tracks and Lowell George is credited as \"George Lowell\"), is the definitive portrait of Ronstadt at her creative peak, when she was a vital part of Los Angeles thriving music scene of the early 70s.

This Warner Platinum collection does have plenty for both the novice and the seasoned listener, including her covers of the Eagles \"Desperado,\" and Warren Zevons \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me,\" and of course, Roy Orbisons \"Blue Bayou.\" There are other things missing as well, but that has more to do with an individuals preference more than with a well-rounded portrait of the diversity and range of hits in Ronstadts career. These exist simply in a wide range of tracks from Buddy Hollys \"Thatll Be the Day,\" to the glorious Motown nugget \"Heat Wave\" (Martha Reeves & the Vandellas struck gold with it back in 1966), or the lilting \"Someone to Lay Down Beside Me.\" The simple fact that Ronstadt could take songs that were bona fide hits with supposedly definitive versions and make them her own is a testament written in stone to her wide-ranging abilities as an interpretive vocalist. Recommended.

She started her career in the Stone Poneys and during the height of her fame she was happy to harmonize on records by friends; later still, she joined Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris in the group Trio. Duets, a compilation released on the eve of her 2014 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, doesnt concentrate on this considerable legacy as a harmonizer, preferring instead to pick 14 previously released duets from throughout Ronstadts career, adding an unreleased version of \"Pretty Bird\" with Laurie Lewis as mild collector bait. Much of this dates from the latter part of Lindas career: it opens with three selections from Adieu False Heart, her 2006 album with Ann Savoy, and is anchored by her hit duets with Aaron Neville (\"Dont Know Much,\" \"All My Life\") and James Ingram (\"Somewhere Out There\"), making a sideways glance at her career as a standards singer via an OK selection from Frank Sinatras Duets album (\"Moonlight in Vermont\"). The liveliest stuff comes from her golden age of the late 70s -- \"Hasten Down the Wind\" with Don Henley, \"Prisoner in Disguise\" with J.D. Souther, \"I Think Its Gonna Work Out Fine\" with James Taylor, \"I Cant Help It (If Im Still in Love with You)\" with Emmylou Harris -- but generally, this Duets emphasizes the sweeter, softer, and slower side of Ronstadt, a move that makes for pleasant listening.
