        "text": "Bio\n\nLinda Ronstadt is recognized for her one-of-a-kind voice and her decades of remarkable music. Drawing from a broad range of influences, Ms. Ronstadt defied expectations to conquer American radio waves and help pave the way for generations of women artists.\n\nLinda Ronstadt began her career in the folk group the Stone Poneys with guitarist Bob Kimmel and guitarist/songwriter Kenny Edwards. In 1968, she began her solo career, going on to receive ten Grammy awards, as well as an ALMA Award and a Latin Grammy for Lifetime Achievement. In 2013 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She has at least 31 gold and platinum records with music that includes influences from pop, country, rock and roll, big band, jazz, opera, Broadway standards, and Mexican and Afro-Cuban influences. In 2013, her autobiography Simple Dreams, A Musical Memoir was published."
