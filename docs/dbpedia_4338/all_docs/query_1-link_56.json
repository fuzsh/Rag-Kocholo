        "text": "One of the most iconic artists of our time, Linda Ronstadt has sold more than 100 million records, won numerous awards, and toured all over the world. Born into a musical family, her childhood was filled with everything from Hank Williams to Gilbert and Sullivan, Mexican folk music to jazz and opera. Her forthcoming memoir, “Simple Dreams,” tells the story of her early artistic curiosity and the wide-ranging and utterly unique career it led to. Ronstadt arrived in Los Angeles just as the folk-rock movement was beginning to bloom, setting the stage for the development of country-rock. After the dissolution of her first band, the Stone Poneys, Linda went out on her own and quickly found success. As part of the coterie of like-minded artists who played at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood, she helped define the musical style that dominated American music in the 1970s. One of her early back-up bands went on to become the Eagles, and Linda would become the most successful female artist of the decade."
