        "text": "What is rock? What is pop? If all are music, how are they different? This is a question that most people ask. And the answer to this lies below.\n\nMusic is a universal language. It is a language of souls, and due to the diverse world of music, it has also become diverse. Music has been divided into various genres. These genres were custom-created by people to achieve the varying taste requirements of different communities. Music can fulfill the various needs of people, be it for listening, entertainment, or as a means of rebelling. Among these genres, the two most popular are pop and rock, and people often want to know the difference between these two.\n\nPop\n\nPop or popular music was first originated in the 1950s. Now, pop music is influenced by various genres of music like urban, rock, dance, country, and Latin music and then is created with great lyrics and formats with a focus on love and many other themes. Nowadays, other than common themes, pop music is being made with various targeting themes like strength and encouragement, etc.\n\nOne example of this is Amen Ra’s songs, which are available on Amenra.com. It is the type of music that is recorded with the focus on attracting huge masses, and so is made to appeal to different tastes. Rather than live performance, pop music focuses more on artistic delivery, recording, and production. It has a progressive development compared to the past.\n\nRock\n\nRock is a genre of music that originated around the 1960s, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rock music is influenced by country and blues music and has roots in the 50s rock and roll music, which was very popular at that time. Rock music mainly focuses on noise, like the use of bass guitar, electric guitar, and heavy drum beats. It also is made in focus with diverse themes such as love, sex, betrayal, political and social, etc.\n\nRock music is a kind of rebelling music. Rock music also has categories like jazz-rock, punk rock, country rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, blues rock, hard rock, and soft rock. Among all these, heavy metal is another type of rock that is the most intense rock form, which is played with very much intensity and volume. It is the more aggressive type of music compared to pop that is more soothing.\n\nDifference Between Pop And Rock Music\n\nPop is very different from rock, although some people consider it a soft type of rock. Unlike rock, pop music is a music genre that is made with the motive of reaching a larger audience. Rock music can be defined as an ideology or subculture that doesn’t reach the masses. Where pop music is generally performed solo, like Amenra.com, rock music is performed in groups or bands, also called rock bands, to be specific. But there are also some pop bands that perform live, and people love them.\n\nPop music sounds very pleasing to the ears when listened to with very much artistic depth. On the other hand, rock music seems noisier, and instead of music, it is more like screaming. Some good rock bands make songs with good lyrics and good artistry, but most of the rock bands are all about high music and distortion. Pop music focuses on things like artistry, production, dance beats, vocals, lyrics, and singing.\n\nMost pop singers have great voices, whereas with rock music, it is hard to tell whether they are singing or screaming. In rock music, only guitars and music are given more priority on the stage than other things. Some people don’t like to hear rock music as it doesn’t sound pleasing to hear, but pop music is a genre of music that can’t sound unpleasing. Also, rock music is live, and pop music is recorded and released, but sometimes it is also performed live. Also, rock music has very aggressive themes, which may not be good for children to hear.\n\nPop music and rock music are two different types of music genres made to suit different tastes around the world. Some people like rock, some like pop, and some like both. It depends upon the audience which is best, pop or rock."
