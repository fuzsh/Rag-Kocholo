        "text": "‘EastEnders’ star Jessie Wallace has split from boyfriend Tim Arnold, after he grew “tired” of fame.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSee EastEnders' Kat And Alfie As You've Never Seen Them Before\n\n'EastEnders' Star Reveals Kat And Alfie Spin-Off Show Details\n\n'EastEnders' Star Closes Company Over Unpaid Tax Bill\n\nThe aspiring singer has confirmed that he and the Kat Moon actress actually parted ways some time ago, after they first began dating in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessie Wallace and Tim Arnold have split\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, Tim says: “People just want to know about the celebrities you know or have been with. I am tired of it.”\n\nWhen asked how long it had been since they’d been together, he added: “Oh, not for a long time.”\n\nTim’s sudden dislike of fame comes as a surprise, given that a year ago, he was trying his luck on ‘The Voice’.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter making it through his main audition and impressing coaches Rita Ora, Ricky Wilson, Will.i.am and Tom Jones, he crashed out of the competition during the battle round.\n\nJessie and Tim began dating after meeting at the British Soap Awards in 2012, where they were introduced by her ‘EastEnders’ co-star June Brown, who is Tim’s godmother.\n\nJessie has had her fair share of relationship drama over the years, as in 2011, she dramatically called off her wedding to Vince Morse when she discovered he was sending explicit messages to an ex-girlfriend.\n\nShe is also mother to seven-year-old daughter, Tallulah, from her previous relationship with policeman Dave Morgan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessie Wallace and Shane Richie in 'The Perfect Murder'\n\nThe star is currently treading the boards in a production of ‘The Perfect Murder’, alongside her ‘EastEnders’ screen husband Shane Richie.\n\nThe pair are also set to star in their own ‘EastEnders’ spin-off show later this year, as Kat and Alfie head to Ireland in search of her long-lost son."
