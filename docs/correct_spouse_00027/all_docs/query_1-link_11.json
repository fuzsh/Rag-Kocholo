        "text": "Soap star Jessie Wallce has had a drama filled life, enough to rival her on-screen character Kat Slater.\n\nThe actress, 52, hit screens in 2000 when she joined EastEnders and has remained on and off the soap since then. Much like Kat, Jessie has had a turbulent life filled with drama when it comes to work and relationships. When she first rocked up to Walford, she was dating an ex-criminal and was warned by bosses about the romance.\n\nShe then went on to have rocky relationships before finally finding her fiance who she keeps away from the spotlight. Jessie has also faced suspensions at work due to her party lifestyle and has a secret real name. The actress was recently spotted on a night out alongside notorious road rage killer Kenneth Noye. She was spotted at a bar and in a private box with the convicted killer as they watched Elvis Live on Screen with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra.\n\nReal name\n\nJessie grew up in Enfield, North London, and was actually born with a very different name. Her real name is Karen Jane Wallace, but changed her stage name to Jessie as a tribute to her late grandmother. Her parents divorced when she was three and she was raised alongside her sister by their dad. She would see her mum at weekends.\n\nWild love life\n\nAs Jessie made her debut in Walford, she was dating ex-criminal Paul Whitworth. Her personal life became the focus of many articles and the actress was warned by BBC executives about the romance. She ended up splitting with the Majorca based ex-criminal after three years together.\n\nJessie then went on to enjoy a holiday romance with 25-year-old American, Andy Burton, who immediately sold his story on their time together. Later she met and fell for police officer Dave Morgan. They started dating and moved in together after just month. Dave was pictured accompanying the soap star to court when she was facing drink-driving charges.. At the 2003 Jessie was banned from driving for three years and given a £1000 fine.\n\nJessie then found out she was pregnant and welcomed her first and only child, Tallulah Lilac in 2004. Sadly, not long after Tallulah's birth, Jessie and Dave called it quits. Jessie went on to find love with catering boss Vince Morse with whom she got engaged. But in a bombshell move the pair called their 2011 wedding off on the day when it emerged that he'd sent an explicit picture of Jessie to an ex.\n\nIt had been a whirlwind romance for Jessie, who accepted Vince's proposal within three months of knowing him. She later found love again with musician Tim Arnold, who she shared a four-year relationship with, and then Paul Kempin for a two-year stint.\n\nSecret boyfriend\n\nNow, Jessie has found love and seems to be happier than ever after settling down with carpenter Justin Gallwey. The couple are said to have known each other since they were teenagers and got engaged earlier this year after more than a year of dating. Jessie shared a sweet selfie of the couple on her Instagram account which showed them enjoying a sunny day at the beach.\n\nThe adorable photo came after Jessie was spotted out and about without her engagement ring. The absence of a ring sparked speculation that the engagement was off but they have since set the record straight. A close friend of Jessie's told the Mirror: \"Jessie simply popped out without her ring on, as she often does if she's working as she obviously can't wear it whilst filming, it's nothing more than that, they're very much together.\"\n\nLosing job to party lifestyle\n\nWhile her character Kat Slater is a clear fan favourite, Jessie has had a tumultuous time on EastEnders since joining the long-running soap. She was first suspended for two months in 2003 because of her behaviour, and she said at the time that it was such a blow that it gave her the drive to better herself. She explained to The Guardian: \"It really was a kick in the teeth. I would turn up late.\n\n\"I was so blasé about stuff. I don't think I was very popular at the time on set. The two months' suspension gave me two months to think about what I was doing.\" In 2018, Jessie was reportedly forced to leave the British Soap Awards early after 'pre-gaming too hard', and in 2020 she was handed a two-month suspension from EastEnders after her behaviour was called into question over an allegd incident while filming the show's 35th anniversary special.\n\n\"Bosses were left with no choice but to discipline her,\" an insider told The Mirror at the time. \"During the meeting, she was told to sort herself out before returning to work.\" It hasn't just been run-ins at work that disrupted Jessie's career. As recently as last year Jessie was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer outside the Verve club in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. She was released with a caution after the event in June 2022 and was \"spoken to\" by BBC bosses about her conduct."
