        "text": "The couple met in April this year when Wallace was facing a drink-driving charge.\n\nPc Morgan, 28, was responsible for shielding Wallace from the barrage of waiting photographers outside Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court.\n\nWallace’s agent confirmed: “They are talking about getting engaged and have been to look at rings.”\n\nThe couple were photographed emerging from a jeweller’s shop in London’s Hatton Garden district yesterday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Essex Police, Pc Morgan’s force, said they had no problem with the relationship.\n\n“The view of the force is that Pc Morgan’s private life is his private life.\n\n“There are rules and regulations relating to officers’ private dealings with convicted criminals, but this is not a situation where anything like that would apply,” she said.\n\n“If he wishes to tell senior officers that he is planning to marry he can do but there is no requirement on him to do so.\n\n“There are no plans for any senior officer to speak to him in relation to this.\n\n“We have read what is in the newspapers today just as other people have.”\n\nPc Morgan was not assigned to protect Wallace when she appeared in court to face the drink-driving charge, it emerged.\n\nOfficers say he was approached by a taxi driver due to collect Wallace from the court.\n\nThe taxi driver had become concerned by the amount of photographers waiting for her and had asked Pc Morgan to make sure there was no problem.\n\nWallace, from Wanstead, east London, was alleged to have been one-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit when police stopped her Mercedes in March.\n\nThe soap star, whose real name is Karen, has denied the charge and is due to appear in court again on September 5.\n\nKat arrived in Albert Square in September 2000 as part of the Slater family and became an instant hit with viewers."
