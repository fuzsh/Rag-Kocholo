This is something I have always wanted.\n\n\"It's amazing to think that by November I will have my own little person to look after.\"\n\nEastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge said: \"The cast and crew are delighted to hear Jessie's happy news and we send her our congratulations.\"\n\nIt has not been decided yet how they will write the star's pregnancy into a story line. Insiders say it is probably too late to include it.\n\nA close friend said: \"She was anxious about the story line but, like most women, she didn't want to say anything until she was three months gone.\n\n\"Jessie hasn't been going out to parties and has been having early nights in as she is starting to feel more tired. She is thrilled and can't stop patting her tummy. She has liked a drink in the past but the only thing she has touched in weeks is the odd Guinness, which she was told is good for pregnant women.\n\n\"She has been really looking after herself and has been taking lots of vitamins and has a fantastic consultant.\n\n\"Dave has been really supportive and has been with her for both scans. They are closer than ever.\"\n\nDave first met Jessie when, as a policeman, he was assigned to look after her when she appeared in court at Chelmsford, Essex, last March.\n\nJessie was banned for three years for drink driving.\n\nThey got together a month later and he quit the force soon after to return to his former job as a fireman.\n\nThe couple got engaged last August. Jessie, whose real name is Karen Wallace, has been in the BBC soap since 1999.\n\nLast year she was suspended from the show for bad behaviour off the set.\n\nBut she returned to some high rating story lines and married Queen Vic landlord Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie.\n\nShe scooped Best Actress at the National TV Awards last September.\n\nKacey Ainsworth, who plays Jessie's on-screen sister Little Mo, is due to give birth to her first baby next month.\n\nHer character was last seen earlier this year leaving Albert Square after the news that she was expecting a baby by a rapist.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nJOY: Jessie and Dave with baby snap yesterday; EASYENDERS: Star has a rest on park bench"
