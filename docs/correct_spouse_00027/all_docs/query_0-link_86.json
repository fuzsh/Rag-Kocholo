        "text": "Her EastEnders character Kat Moon has had her fair share of relationship woes.But in a cruel twist of fate, there was real-life heartbreak for Jessie Wallace this week when the actress cancelled her wedding at the last minute.\n\nThe soap star called things off just hours before she was due to tie the knot after an argument with her catering boss fiancé Vince Morse, according to reports. She apparently called off the ceremony while some of the guests were already en route to the plush venue in Richmond, South West London.As Kat herself might have done, Jessie put on a brave face as she arrived back at her London home on the day after what should have been her wedding. Pictured in the back of a car with a thin smile on her face, she was accompanied by friends who spent the day at her house. At one point wedding cupcakes that were to be a part of the reception were delivered back to her home. Jessie finished her relationship with Vince after he admitted sending an explicit picture of the actress, 39, to his ex-girlfriend, The Sun said. It has been reported that the 50-year-old also told his ex he had doubts about his planned marriage to the soap star.\n\nAfter Jessie confronted her fiancé on Sunday morning about the picture, hotel guests reportedly heard screaming and wailing on the eve of her planned wedding. \"I've never heard anything like it. She was wailing in grief then growling in rage,\" claimed a guest at the hotel.\n\nThe wedding, to be attended by 350 guests, was due to take place at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond.\n\nStaff packed away £18,000 worth of champagne and removed £3,500 worth of flowers, while an Elvis impersonator was also cancelled. Jessie, who previously described Vince as her \"Mr Right\" said she had \"never been this happy with a man before\".She has a daughter, Tallulah Lilac, with PC Dave Morgan - the man who escorted her to court to face a drink-driving charge. The actress also dated millionaire Paul Witworth for three years before splitting up with him in 2002."
