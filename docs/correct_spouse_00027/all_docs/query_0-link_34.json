        "text": "Soap star Jessie Wallace aka EastEnders' Kat Moon has surprised fans by announcing she's become a grandmother for the first time to a beautiful baby boy.\n\nTaking to her Instagram, the 50-year-old shared a sweet black and white snap of the little one, who is called SJ.\n\nShe said: 'Welcome to the world, my grandson SJ. You are loved, cherished and adored.'\n\nSJ's mum is Jessie's 17-year-old daughter Tallulah Lilac Morgan, who Jessie shares with her policeman ex Dave Morgan.\n\nLots of Jessie's co-stars and celebrity friends were quick to pass on congratulations to The Square's latest granny.\n\nFellow EastEnders star Lacey Turner said he is a 'Beautiful boy' while Suki Panesar actor Balvinder Sopal said: 'congratulations'.\n\nAntony Costa from pop band Blue also joined in with his own message of congratulations.\n\nJessie joined EastEnders as Kat Slater back in 2000 and has been involved in numerous big storylines.\n\nShe was suspended from the soap in 2004 for alleged excessive partying, drinking and adverse publicity.\n\nIn 2020, she was suspended again for two months due to an alleged incident while filming.\n\nJessie has largely kept her daughter out of the spotlight but did reveal in 2019 that the teenager had been robbed by a gang in Muswell Hill, north London. At the time Tallulah was 14.\n\nCongrats on the new addition, Jessie!"
