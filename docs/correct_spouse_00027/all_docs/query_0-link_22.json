In which case, why didn't he take it with him when he left if Jessie isn't capable of looking after her?\n\n0\n\nOh sweet lord, im sorry but just read the NOTW article and GOD what a total c*** he is. However much sh*t has gone on between you and your partner there is no need to smear it all over the filthy tabloids like excrement in a prison cell when you get in a huff.\n\nDoesnt sound like this guy is fit to be a parent if he's willing to say such vile things about the mother of his kid. I dont know what to make of the alcoholic portrait he's tried to paint of Jessie but its really nasty. They are both better off without one another i think, and i hope that Jessie doesnt do some pathetic article with the Sun or something in revenge or i wont have any sympathy. But eurgh, its horrible! That guy is a tosser. he's clearly got too used to sponging off jessie and now hes not got any cash he's resorted to selling stories. vile!\n\n0"
