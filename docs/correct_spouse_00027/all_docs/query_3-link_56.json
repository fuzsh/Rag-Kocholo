        "text": "THE bedroom door burst open�and in slinked smiling EastEnders star Jessie Wallace in a skimpy PVC nurse's uniform and shiny black spike-heeled boots.\n\nIt was a moment in their turbulent two-year relationship that the soap beauty's ex-fianc� Dave Morgan will never forget.\n\nFor until drink and violence completely engulfed them, the early days of their sex life were fun, kinky�and in their own way as wild as Jessie's boozing.\n\nDressing up was all part of the fun�and she liked nothing better than watching fireman Dave wield his hose in his uniform.\n\nBoots\n\nHe told us: \"I'd briefly worked over in New York for their fire service and brought my uniform back �Jessie loved it. It's so much sexier than the British firefighting gear.\n\n\"She got really turned on when I wore my black boots, trousers and jacket with a black helmet.\n\n\"She returned the favour by dressing up for me too.\n\n\"It was my idea to get the nurse's outfit, and Jessie was well up for it. She first wore it on the night of the day she'd bought it.\"\n\nThe giggling couple had been pictured that day buying the outfit at at their local sex shop, Michelle's Fashions, in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, in December, 2003.\n\n\"I was in the bedroom that night when she suddenly burst in wearing it,\" said Dave. \"We immediately ended up having sex right there and then on the bed. It all happened quite quickly because I found it a massive turn-on.\n\n\"I'd also bought some black bondage tape at the shop. I wrapped her up in it naked, like a mummy and then unravelled her.\n\n\"Jessie was beautiful naked. I found her so attractive�and she was brilliant in bed. Very wild and adventurous. And she always satisfied me.\" The loved-up couple began discussing having children together at the end of 2003�shortly after their engagement�and were both really thrilled by the idea.\n\n\"I think Jessie was aware her biological clock was ticking,\" said Dave. \"We tried for three or four months and she started getting really worried. Then it happened and we were obviously thrilled.\"\n\nBut as soon as Jessie learned she was pregnant their sex life began to fizzle out�and they didn't make love for nearly a year.\n\n\"Jessie just wasn't interested in it while she was pregnant,\" said Dave. \"Even after she'd had the baby she wasn't interested. Before we split last month we hadn't made love for two months at least. By then we were rowing so much that I spent a lot of the time in the spare room.\"\n\nIn the last three months of the relationship, Dave said he was probably in Jessie's bed five or six times.\n\n\"But when we did have sex it was great because we had gone so long without it,\" he said. \"I love Jessie's body and didn't mind that she isn't the slimmest girl in the world.\"\n\nDave learned to be tactful when it came to Jessie's weight. Her insecurity about her looks led her to have breast reduction surgery in 1998 before she got the part as Kat and met Dave. She went down from an E cup to a more modest C cup. She felt her boobs were too big for her frame.\n\nBut Dave said: \"They were still nice and big when I met her�but I 'd have loved to have seen what they were like before the op.\"\n\nJessie's insecurity also reared its head in jealous rages over Dave's friendships with other women.\n\nWhen Dave was holidaying in New York with old fire service friends for St Patrick's Day, it all came to a head.\n\nJessie became convinced Essex-born Dave was having an affair with the ex-wife of one of his mates.\n\n\"Jessie and me had been out with this couple called Steve and Lisa a couple of times but didn't really know them that well,\" said Dave. \"One day in passing I happened to mention that they'd split up and Jessie gave me an odd look.\n\nJealous\n\n\"Then when I was in New York she got on the phone to Lisa and accused her of having an affair with me, apparently effing and blinding down the phone at her.\n\n\"It was all nonsense of course. When I found out I had a go at her about it and we ended up having another flaming row.\"\n\nYet Dave says Jessie loved trying to make HIM jealous about her bedroom scenes with on-screen husband Alfie Moon, played by Shane Richie.\n\n\"She'd ask me if it bothered me when she kissed Shane. I'd say it didn't but when I said it must be nasty snogging someone else she just shrugged and said, �It's work, isn't it',\" said Dave.\n\nDave admits he had fancied Jessie the first time he saw her on EastEnders and couldn't believe his luck when he was at Chelmsford Magistrates Court the day she was on her drink-driving charge in April 2003.\n\n\"I asked her out and was gobsmacked when she said yes,\" he said. \"A week after the court case I took her for dinner in Covent Garden. We dated for a while, but then she went a bit cold on me. She made me do all the running.\"\n\nAfter five weeks the couple made love for the first time at Jessie's �500,000 house in Wanstead, East London.\n\nThen Dave moved in and they got engaged six months later. At that time, Dave thought they would last forever. \"I never imagined what would happen�all the rows. I don't like to think about them,\" he said.\n\nThe end was near when Dave returned from a 10-day holiday in New York for St Patrick's Day in March�after they'd had the row on the phone about Lisa.\n\nDrunken Jessie arrived home at 4.30am after being round at one of her mates' houses, woke him and screeched: \"I want you out. Why don't you f*** off back to New York.\"\n\nDave said: \"I decided to call her bluff and the next day flew to New York. I left saying, �If you change your mind let me know'.\n\n\"I'd only been gone a couple of days and she was on the phone begging me to come back. She told me she couldn't cope without me. I decided to give her one last chance. It was the most emotional I'd ever heard her and thought we might be able to make it work.\n\n\"I came home but within days she was back to her horrible self. It was only a matter of time. Now I've gone I just feel total relief.\"\n\n0"
