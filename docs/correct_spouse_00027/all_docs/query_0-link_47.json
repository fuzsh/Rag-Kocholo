        "text": "Warde J. Manuel was named Michigan's Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics on January 29, 2016. Manuel's original five-year appointment was extended on Feb. 18, 2021, and runs through June 30, 2026.\n\nManuel's return to Ann Arbor brings him full-circle from an accomplished student-athlete and athletic administrator at U-M to a distinguished career as an athletic director and back again.\n\nA three-time Michigan alumnus and two-sport athlete who played football under Bo Schembechler, Manuel returned to U-M following a nearly four-year run as director of athletics at the University of Connecticut.\n\nManuel is Michigan's 12th athletic director in the university's intercollegiate athletics history that dates to the 1885-86 school year. U-M has 29 varsity teams and more than 950 student-athletes. The self-supporting department has an annual budget of roughly $216 million and a staff of approximately 350.\n\nManuel has served on the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) executive committee since 2009 and served a one-year term as president during the 2020-21 academic year. He also serves on the board of directors for The Collegiate Women Sports Awards, the executive committee for the Black AD Alliance and is one of Michigan's representatives on the Big Ten Conference Equality Coalition.\n\nSuccess has followed Manuel each year at U-M. In 2022-23, the Wolverines set a school and Big Ten Conference academic year record with 13 Big Ten championships, including second consecutive titles in football and ice hockey. Four Michigan student-athletes earned national player of the year awards while U-M attained five individual national championship honors between three student-athletes. All told, U-M finished 11th in the LEARFIELD Director's Cup Standings. An incredible 35 student-athletes won individual Big Ten championships while 44 attained All-America accolades. Nearly 500 student-athletes earned Academic All-Big Ten honors and 695 student-athletes earned U-M Athletic Academic Achievement honors.\n\nManuel guided Michigan Athletics to one of the most successful years in its long history in 2021-22. U-M finished third in the LEARFIELD Directors’ Cup standings, its fifth consecutive top-six finish under Manuel. The Wolverines claimed 13 conference championships, again leading all Big Ten schools, while wrestler Nick Suriano won the NCAA 125-pound title. Twelve teams finished 2021-22 among the top 10 nationally: women’s basketball (t-5th); field hockey (t-5th); football (t-3rd); men’s gymnastics (3rd); women’s gymnastics (8th); hockey (t-3rd); rowing (10th); women’s soccer (t-5th); women’s swimming and diving (7th); men’s tennis (t-5th); water polo (t-5th); and wrestling (2nd).\n\nThe 2021-22 Wolverines set a school record with 507 student-athletes earning Academic All-Big Ten Conference honors, and 11 individuals earning Academic All-America honors for maintaining at least a 3.3 grade-point average while also excelling on the field of play. Another school record was set, with 701 student-athletes earning a grade point average of 3.0 or better during the academic year. Forty-eight student-athletes earned All-America honors during the year, while 118 earned All-Big Ten honors, and 28 won individual conference championships.\n\nAll told, during Manuel’s seven-year tenure, the Wolverines have captured an NCAA Championship in football (2023), women’s gymnastics (2021), and finished runner up nationally in wrestling (2022), field hockey (2020), baseball (2019), men’s basketball (2018) and women’s cross country (2017). Wolverines have combined to win 22 individual NCAA titles during Manuel’s tenure, 78 regular season and tournament conference titles, 58 Academic All-Americas honors, 396 Big Ten Distinguished scholars, and 3,054 Academic All-Big Ten honors.\n\nIn Manuel’s second full year as athletic director, 2017-18, Michigan unveiled the Stephen M. Ross Athletic Campus South Complex with the official opening in January 2018. Thanks to the efforts of countless individuals, the facility provides specialized spaces for nine of Michigan's varsity teams, shared resources for all the teams, as well as competition venues. It includes strength and conditioning, athletic medicine, meeting space and locker rooms, and allows for consolidation of various team facilities currently dispersed across the Stephen M. Ross Athletic Campus.\n\nManuel's return to Ann Arbor brings him full-circle as a student-athlete, three-time degree-holder and athletic administrator at U-M, to a distinguished career as an athletic director, and back again. He returns to U-M following a nearly four-year run as director of athletics at the University of Connecticut, highlighted by being recognized as the 2015 NACDA Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year.\n\nManuel became the director of athletics at the University of Connecticut in 2012. UConn teams won six NCAA national championships under Manuel's leadership -- the most ever by UConn teams in a three-year period. In 2014, UConn's three national championship teams (field hockey and men's and women's basketball) all posted perfect 1,000 single-year scores in the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate (APR). In 2015, 13 UConn teams posted perfect single-year scores, marking a dramatic academic improvement at the school.\n\nIn 2014-15, the UConn field hockey team won its second straight NCAA championship and the women's basketball team won a third consecutive NCAA title.\n\nWithin three months of his arrival, Manuel directed UConn's acceptance into membership of Hockey East. He also oversaw a coaching transition in men's basketball with the retirement of Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun and the hiring of former UConn student-athlete and NBA player Kevin Ollie.\n\nManuel led the completion of the $40 million fundraising effort for the construction of the Werth Family UConn Basketball Champions Center, which opened in the fall of 2014 in order to provide UConn basketball programs with a training, practice and academic services home.\n\nPrior to arriving in Connecticut, he led a 20-sport program at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo from 2005 through 2012. During his tenure, the Buffalo Bulls experienced an unparalleled period of success from an athletic, academic and community service perspective.\n\nManuel was honored by Sports Business Journal as a 2008 national \"40-Under-40\" honoree after receiving the same honor from Business First of Buffalo in fall of 2007. Manuel has served on a number of national and athletic conference committees and boards.\n\nIn 2007, he accepted the Opportunity Award by all-time tennis great Billie Jean King, when the University at Buffalo was recognized by the Women's Sports Foundation as one of four \"standout\" colleges and universities in the nation for outstanding achievement in providing equitable athletic opportunities for its female student-athletes.\n\nBorn May 22, 1968, Manuel is a native of New Orleans. He was a high school All-America football player and played for U-M under Schembechler. He earned multiple letters and started at defensive end in his sophomore year. His football career was cut short by a neck injury, and he subsequently lettered as a member of the Wolverines' track and field team.\n\nManuel earned his bachelor of general studies with a focus in psychology in 1990, his master's degree in social work from U-M in 1993 and an MBA from U-M's Stephen M. Ross School of Business in 2005.\n\nAfter graduating from U-M, he was coordinator of U-M's Wade H. McCree Jr. Incentive Scholarship Program from 1990 to 1993. The program is a partnership with the Michigan Association of State Universities and Detroit Public Schools that helps students prepare for higher education at public universities in Michigan.\n\nHe subsequently worked briefly as an academic advisor with the Georgia Tech Athletic Association before being named assistant athletic director of academic affairs.\n\nAfterward, Manuel served in several roles within Michigan's athletic department from 1996-2005. In 2000 he was named associate athletic director with oversight responsibility for operational facets of the university's athletic program. He also oversaw Michigan's football and men's basketball programs.\n\nManuel, and his wife, Chrislan, a U-M alum who earned a master of health services administration degree in 1993, have a daughter, Emma, and a son, Evan."
