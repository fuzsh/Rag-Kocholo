You are loved, cherished and adored.\"\n\nHer EastEnders co-stars were quick to comment, with Stacey Slater actress Lacey Turner writing: \"Beautiful boy.\"\n\nJacqueline Jossa forced to sell house after ‚Äòstruggling with money‚Äô following EastEnders exit\n\nInside EastEnders star Ross Boatman's life away from Harvey Monroe\n\nEmmerdale fans recognise Rhona‚Äôs mum Mary Goskirk from EastEnders\n\nBalvinder Sopal, who stars as Suki Panesar, added: \"Congratulations\" with heart emojis.\n\nJohn Partridge, who played Christian Clarke in the soap, and Blue‚Äôs Antony Costa also commented on the photo.\n\nJessie is mum to daughter Tallulah, 17, who she shares with ex Dave Morgan. The couple split shortly after she was born.\n\nBack on EastEnders, Jessie‚Äôs character Kat is currently caring for her three sons, Tommy, Bert and Ernie.\n\nAnd it seems like they have a close relationship off-screen too, as Jessie revealed young actors Elliot and Cody Briffett - who play twins Bert and Ernie - sent her adorable Christmas card last year.\n\nSharing a photo of the inside of the card, Jessie wrote: ‚ÄúLove this from my boys #bertandernie ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù.\n\nIn the card, Elliot thanks her for ‚Äòbeing my EastEnders mum‚Äô while Cody stuck on a sweet picture of a snowman.\n\n‚ÄúThat's just the cutest thing üòç,‚Äù one follower commented, while another added: ‚ÄúHow sweet! You be their ‚ÄòEastEnders Mum‚Äô - clearly they love ‚ù§Ô∏è having you!‚Äù\n\nJessie first made her debut in the Square back 2000 and has left and returned many times over the years.\n\nHer most famous storyline saw viewers find out her sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan) was actually her daughter after she was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) as a child."
