        "text": "Jessie Wallace has confirmed that she is engaged to carpenter Justin Gallwey.\n\nThe EastEnders actress, who plays Kat Slater in the long-running BBC soap, took to Instagram *on Monday to share the exciting news following reports in the media that they were set to wed.\n\n“My fiancé and moi” the 51-year-old wrote alongside an image of the two cosied up to each other, with Wallace - whose real name is Karen Jane Wallace - gently placing a hand on his chest.\n\nThe engaged couple have been together for at least a year.\n\nWhispers began to swirl about them planning to head down the aisle when The Sun published pictures of Wallace sporting a gold band on her ring finger as she bought a bottle of wine at a petrol station near her London home recently.\n\nIt was previously reported that Mr Gallwey, 50, had been helping Wallace to address issues with alcohol after she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer.\n\nHe told The Sun on Sunday: “I just want to protect her. Everything is happy and things are good.”\n\nWallace has not married before.\n\nShe was set to marry in a £300,000 star-studded ceremony in 2011 to then-fiancé Vincent Morse before it was called off at the last minute.\n\nWallace has an 18-year-old daughter called Tallulah with ex Dave Morgan.\n\nLast year she became a grandmother after Tallulah gave birth to a baby boy.\n\nSharing a black and white image of the new arrival in a since-deleted post, Wallace wrote: “Welcome to the world, my grandson SJ. You are loved, cherished and adored.”"
