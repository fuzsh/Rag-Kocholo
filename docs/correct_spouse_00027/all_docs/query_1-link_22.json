        "text": "EastEnder Jessie Wallace has split from her singer boyfriend Tim Arnold after he became fed up of fame.\n\nThe award-winning telly star, 44, known to millions as feisty Kat Moon in the BBC1 soap, and 40-year-old Arnold started dating in 2012 after being introduced at the Soap Awards.\n\nArnold, whose stage name is The Soho Hobo, is the son of actress Polly Perkins, 72, who played Dot Cotton’s half-sister Rose. Walford veteran June Brown, 88, is his godmother.\n\nRevealing his four-year relationship with Jessie was over, Arnold said: “People just want to know about the celebrities you know or have been with. I am tired of it.”\n\nSpeaking at the Jimi Hendrix At Home afterparty in Soho, Central London, on Tuesday night Arnold, who was in 90s Britpop band Jocasta, added he wanted to distance himself from the limelight.\n\nWhen asked how long it was since they had been a couple, he replied: “Oh, not for a long time.”\n\nRead more:Shane Ritchie and Jessie Wallace slam EastEnders\n\nUnlucky-in-love Jessie has a poor track record when it comes to relationships. In August 2011 she called off her £300,000 wedding to ex-fiance catering boss Vince Morse on her wedding day after she found out just the night before he had sex texts to an old flame.\n\nDevastated, she fled to Crete on what should have been her honeymoon to escape the embarrassment. She took a six-month break from EastEnders , during which Vince went on ITV1’s This Morning to make a grovelling public apology in a failed bid to win her back.\n\nShe has also had doomed romances with Paul Whitworth, an old pal of gang boss Reggie Kray.\n\nShe then fell for policeman Dave Morgan in 2007, the father of her seven-year-old daughter Tallulah.\n\nAfter they split Jessie started seeing American toyboy Andy Burton, who is six years her junior. But she ended it after he went public on their relationship.\n\nWhen Arnold started dating Jessie, a year after she ditched Morse, he pledged his loyalty to her, saying: “I knew about the terrible experience she’d had. I took it on board to make sure that I would be different. One of the greatest crimes that can happen to any woman, whether they are famous or not, is to be humiliated. So I always took it as a responsibility to be both supportive and protective of Jessie.\n\n“And I have done that.”\n\nJessie has won a string of awards for her role in EastEnders from Best Newcomer in the 2001 British Soap Awards to Best Actress at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards. On screen she is married to Alfie Moon, played by Shane Richie.\n\nHer real-life break-up comes after crooner Arnold auditioned for BBC talent series The Voice last year without telling Jessie. At the time he said: “I didn’t tell any of my nearest and dearest. I went on my own. I want people to judge me on my music and not the famous people in my life. It’s about doing it on my own merit.”\n\nHe was given the boot after the second round of the singing show."
