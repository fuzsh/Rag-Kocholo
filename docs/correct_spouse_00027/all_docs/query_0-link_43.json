        "text": "EastEnders star Jessie Wallace has revealed that her teenage daughter, Tallulah Lilac Morgan, was once a victim of a terrifying mugging by a London gang. The 47-year-old, who is famous for playing Kat Slater on the BBC soap, recalled the harrowing incident in response to a fellow Twitter user who complained that his own daughter had been attacked inside a gated block of \"luxury flats\". Jessie went on to claim she reported it to the police but she said \"nothing was ever resolved\".\n\nJessie Wallace revealed her 14-year-old daughter was a victim of a mugging\n\n\"Teenage daughter mugged by gang, dials 999. @metpoliceUK will investigate. We hear nothing. Ring 101. Rec message,\" the man's tweet read. \"Find out names of gang. Send to police... nothing. Police station closed/luxury flats. Not seen a real-life policeman for years. Gang continue... what happens next?\" Unimpressed, he added: \"Apparently if you want to see a policeman you go to Planet Organic on a Thursday between 6-7pm. I wish I was making this up @theresa_may... I wish you would come and reassure my daughter as the gang stole her passport and have her address. Also reported. Nothing frm @metpoliceuk.\"\n\nREAD: Jessie Wallace confirms Redwater will not return for second series\n\nUpon seeing the tweet, Jessie shared the post and said: \"This happened last year in Muswell Hill to my daughter. I call the police at 8pm and they knock on my door at 3am. Nothing was ever resolved.\" Jessie's former co-star Kacey Ainsworth was quick to reply with: \"Oh no! Hope she was ok afterwardsâ€¦\" The soap star shares her teenage daughter with policeman Dave Morgan; the couple split shortly after the birth."
