        "text": "BBC EastEnders star Jessie Wallace has reportedly been arrested for allegedly attacking a police officer outside of a nightclub. A Suffolk Police spokesman told The Sun : “A 50-year-old woman was arrested early on Sunday morning in St Andrew’s Street, Bury, St Edmunds.\"\n\nThe Kat Slater actress was arrested \"on suspicion of assaulting a police officer/drunk and disorderly conduct and was released without charge after receiving a conditional caution.” The soap star has one daughter, Tallulah Lilac Morgan, with her ex Dave Morgan.\n\nTo accept a conditional caution a suspect must sign a document confirming an admission to the offence along with details of what they did. Though not a conviction, it is used as an alternative to a charge and is recorded on the Police National Computer.\n\nREAD MOREInside Katie Price goodie bag 'worth £20' that fans were given at Birmingham make-up masterclass\n\nIt is marked as spent three months after the date of issue but can still be used in any possible future criminal proceedings as evidence of character. Jessie had reportedly been in the area after watching Madness at Thetford Forest in nearby Brandon on Saturday.\n\nJessie has also appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and The Bill. The BBC declined to comment, according to reports today."
