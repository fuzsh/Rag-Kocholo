        "text": "Stories of some of Birminghamâs unsung sheores are now in a book: âStrongHer: Women Breaking Barriers and Building Bridges in Birminghamâ by award-winning writer Chanda Temple.\n\nThe book, which was released in November 2023, includes stories about more than 150 women whoâve been selected through the years as StrongHer honorees. There are stories from survivors of cancer, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. There are also stories from entrepreneurs, teachers, performers, and more. But the one thread that ties them all together is how they handled adversity; helped someone else to see a better day; or pitched in to make a difference in Birmingham.\n\nBirmingham Mayor Randall L. Woodfin initiated the StrongHer campaign in 2019 as a way to celebrate the extraordinary women who work tirelessly behind the scenes, sometimes concealed from the spotlight, but vital to the victories happening every day in the Magic City.\n\nâWe live in a city where women are making moves that spark change,ââ Mayor Woodfin said. âThe women highlighted in this campaign are just an example of the thousands of other female gamechangers working to make a difference in our city, our country and the world. I salute them all.ââ\n\nThe book is on sale at the Friends Bookstore in the downtown Birmingham Public Library, Monday â Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. On the first Saturday of each month, the store is open from 11 a.m.to 3 p.m.\n\nIn Spring 2024, the book won first place for graphic design and first place for best book in the Alabama Media Professionals state contest.\n\nQuestions about StrongHer? Please send them to strongher@birminghamal.gov.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNew StrongHer Art Exhibit up at Birmingham City Hall until the end of April 2024\n\nThe year 2024 marks the sixth year for the StrongHer campaign, and we are glad to present another class of incredible women. Due the outstanding number of applications submitted, 34 women were selected this year. One of those women is a self-taught artist, and her work is currently on display in an art gallery on the second floor of City Hall.\n\nChristina Johnsonâs art speaks to the power and strength of Birminghamâs women. Her exhibit opened on International Womenâs Day, which was March 8, 2024. It will remain up through mid-April 2024. This is the first time the city has hosted a StrongHer exhibit.\n\nJohnson, who is also the Artist in Residence for Railroad Park, has created 19 pieces for the exhibit. Some of the pieces were inspired by the StrongHer campaign.\n\nâReading the StrongHer book truly inspired me and spoke to my soul. My goal (with the paintings) was to just really embody all that we are as women,ââ said Johnson, a married mother of three. âAs a woman, as a wife and as an artist, we have many moving pieces. We wear many hats. But we carry a great strength within us, and when you put us together, thereâs even more strength.ââ\n\nJohnsonâs pieces feature layers of acrylic paint. Pieces of sheet music, newspaper, pages from books and even jewelry are mixed into her creations. Because of such textures in her artwork, the exhibit is called, âTextures of Strength.â\n\nAlongside Johnsonâs art are two pieces by Titusville library patron Milana Price. Price is a 9-year-old lung cancer survivor with a dream of becoming an artist and pilot one day. Upon hearing about Milanaâs dream, it was decided that two of Milanaâs drawings be placed in the Womenâs History Month showcase. Johnson, 46, had non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma when she was a child and survived the cancer.\n\nâTogether, Christina and Milana remind us that strength knows no bounds and that hope can shine through even in the darkest of times,ââ Mayor Woodfin said. âTheir artwork isnât just on canvas or paper. Their works are masterpieces that showcase vibrant dreams full of courage and hope.ââ\n\nThe exhibit has titles for each piece such as âStart Where You Areââ and âDonât Wait Decades to Believe in Yourself.ââ There are also inspirational quotes to go with each painting. To see a video of Johnson talking about her art work, go here.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nStrongHer 2024 Profiles\n\nMarch 1 â Katasha Thomas-Peterson\n\nKatasha LiveRejoice Petersonâs journey into the world of makeup began in 2014 as a gentle calling that tugged at her heartstrings while she worked full time as a social worker.\n\nWhen she wasnât handling social work cases, the Birmingham native was discovering the magic of cosmetics. With each stroke of her brush, she helped others embrace their beauty, sometimes serving as a light in their darkest moments. Makeup was her ministry.\n\nâThere have been times where Iâve had clients lay on my (eye)lash bed, and we cry together,â said Thomas-Peterson, 42. âSome come in grieving or talking about their job or family issues. If I donât have the answers, I tell them where they might be able to find them.â\n\nAs news of her skills spread, Thomas-Peterson eventually left social work to become a full-time makeup artist. Through prayer and networking, the Wenonah High School graduate landed on sets such as Tyler Perryâs âThe Have the Have Notsâ and âThe Oval;â Issa Raeâs Netflix movie âLovebirds;â the film âRespect,â with Jennifer Hudson and Mary J. Blige; the âYoung Rockâ TV show about Dwayne âThe Rockâ Johnsonâs life; and many other projects.\n\nIn 2022, she received a call to be one of the makeup artists for several months on the set of âThe Color Purpleâ movie musical adaptation, which was co-produced by Oprah Winfrey. She was also asked to do the makeup for the dancers for Bootsy Collins in the opening act for the World Games in Birmingham.\n\nIn 2023, she was one of several makeup artists selected to work on three movies filmed in the metro Birmingham area: âThe Shiftâ with Kristopher Polaha; âGunnerâ with Morgan Freeman and Luke Hemsworth; and âThe Rivals of Amziah Kingâ with Matthew McConaughey and Kurt Russell. In December 2023, she did the makeup for former U.S. Secretary of State and Birmingham native Condoleeza Rice, who was in the Magic City to shoot a documentary.\n\nAnd even though sheâs worked on celebrities since 2016, Thomas-Peterson said she hasnât changed how she runs her business, Kpartistry7, or gives back in Birmingham. Sheâs volunteered to do prom looks for students from different schools; offered beauty kits for survivors of domestic violence and breast cancer; and provided guidance for young people interested in working in the beauty industry.\n\nâMy women are my heart,â she said. âI treat people with love and kindness. I respect their boundaries, and I respect their needs.â\n\nâEvery time clients leave my chair, they say, âThis was definitely a good beauty session. I see why you are so different from others. You make your clients feel welcome, loved, and like family. Iâll be back!ââ\n\nMarch 2 â Debbie Lincoln Davis\n\nDebbie Lincoln Davis has a saying she shares with many of those she mentors: Itâs never too late.\n\nWhen she was 27 years old, she started as a temp at a Birmingham bank. She put in the work and advanced to various positions through the years. Today, at the age of 59, sheâs a vice president and operations manager at that same bank.\n\nWhen she was 46, she decided she wanted a college degree so she could set a good example for her son, who was in high school, and her daughter, who was in middle school, at the time. She didnât let age or the fact that she worked full time and cared for a family stall her dream. She enrolled at Miles College and graduated magna cum laude by the age of 49. Sheâs thankful that the bank had a program that paid for college for its employees.\n\nToday, with a lifetime of achievements behind her, Davis continues to evolve.\n\nShe recently launched her own business, Passion Proofed Services, a writing, editing and proofreading business and gets invited to deliver motivational speeches. She is currently enrolled in an online program at LSU to get another degree. And by the time she turns 60 in December 2024, she will have published her first book and continue to inspire others to embrace the unknown with courage and conviction.\n\nâItâs never too late to make your dreams a reality because you donât know whoâs watching,â she said. âWhenever I think thereâs no one looking, there is always somebody who reaches out to me and says, âHow do you do it? You inspire me.ââ\n\nMarch 3 â Wenonah Girlsâ Flag Football Team\n\nHistory makers walk the halls of Wenonah High School, where the schoolâs first girlsâ flag football team won the Birmingham City Schools championship in 2022 and 2023, and they went on to win the 5A state championship in December 2023.\n\nThe December 2023 state championship game was a hard fought one in Tuscaloosa, but the team pulled through, beating Montgomery Catholic in overtime under the direction of Coach Cedric Lane. The score was 18-12.\n\nâWinning feels like a dream come true. We did so much to get this far,â said captain and cornerback Ciara Clark. âFor the past three years, we did our best.â\n\nEver since the Alabama High School Athletic Association made the sport available for high schools in Alabama in 2021, the Lady Dragons have poured their hearts into mastering the game, giving hours to play and practice while also maintaining their grades. They pray together before they hit the field.\n\nâWe are a family first, then teamwork and then coaching. We have the best coach in the city,â said quarterback and captain Samarian Franklin. âYou can do whatever you put your mind to. Itâs not just a boysâ sport. Itâs a girlsâ sport, too. Itâs going to be bigger in the future.â\n\nFlag football for boys and girls will be part of the U.S. Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. The sport was also played during the World Games in Birmingham in 2022.\n\nSeveral of the Wenonah students play multiple sports, and flag football gives them another opportunity to secure college scholarships. One team member received a full-ride flag football scholarship in 2023 and two more team members have full-ride flag football scholarships for 2024.\n\nCoach Lane said USA Today recently told him that co-captain and wide receiver Jakerria Ringstaff has been nominated as USA Today Flag Football Player of the Year. He said sheâll find out later this spring if she won. âBeing nominated is big because I had to encourage her to play in 2022,â Coach Lane said. âSheâs a basketball player, and she had never played flag football. Once she got out there, she got better and better. She had a really good game in the championship game, scoring two touchdowns.â\n\nSaid Ringstaff: âWinning the state championship proves you can do anything you put your mind to do.â\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2024, during a Birmingham City Council meeting, Council President Pro Tempore Wardine Alexander and Mayor Randall L. Woodfin congratulated the team. Alexander gave the members Outstanding Citizen medals.\n\nâWhen I was a student at Wenonah High School in 1972, they enacted Title IX, which brought about ways to eliminate discrimination of athletics based on sex and gender. And so, weâve come almost 50 years â¦ and we see the accomplishments that these young ladies have made on the field, as well as in the classroom,â Alexander said during the meeting. âAs Mayor Woodfin has already stated, these young ladies are champions. And we know the great star on the hill is where champions are made.â\n\nMarch 4 â Jody Mattson\n\nFrom the moment Jody Mattson steps into her office, her mission is clear: serve Birmingham with kindness, generosity and a whole lot of heart.\n\nShe does that as the director of Philanthropy and Community Engagement with Americaâs First Federal Credit Union in downtown Birmingham, where she works on a yearly food drive that benefits the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama; participates in an annual toy drive with the cityâs Department of Youth Services and other partners; volunteers with Habitat for Humanity to build a home for the holidays; and helps launch a new book drive. During the month of March 2024, people can drop off books at any Americaâs First Federal Credit Union branch. The books will go to Better Basics to help impact youth literacy and Birmingham City Schools. The credit union will have another book drive in the fall.\n\nMattsonâs passion to help others runs deep outside her job, too. She is a member of the Literacy Council of Central Alabama; a former participant of the Junior League of Birmingham; a board member of the League of Southeastern Credit Unions Young Professionals; secretary of the Public Relations Council of Alabama-Birmingham; and is a part of the LeadEarly Birmingham, a seven-month cohort dedicated to learning and advancing Birminghamâs early education community. And before she started work at Americaâs First in 2016, she worked as director of Development at United Cerebral Palsy, which is now known as United Ability.\n\nThereâs no such thing as downtime for Mattson because sheâs always using her skills in marketing and nonprofit event support to lift spirits, inspire change and make Birmingham a little brighter for those in need. She stays on the go because on the go is where the people are. Supporting the children and families in Birmingham is her goal.\n\nâThis is something where I get to use my talents and my abilities to really, truly make an impact,ââ she said. âAnd I get to do what Iâm passionate about every day.â\n\nMarch 5 â Candace Chandler\n\nIn 2017, Candace Chandlerâs husband suddenly died of a massive heart attack.\n\nLosing him was gut-wrenching.\n\nThen, one month later, Chandler miscarried the coupleâs first baby.\n\nAnother gut-wrenching moment.\n\nExperiencing the back-to-back losses left Chandler lost, confused and severely depressed.\n\nâI said, âLord, I canât do this anymore.â I wanted to give up,ââ she said. âI went from being at the mountaintop to the valley.â\n\nBut she told God that if He could help her through her pain, she would serve Him until her dying day. She sought grief counseling, took a 60-day leave from her Birmingham teaching job and focused on self-healing.\n\nâI had to surrender to God, and that is why I can walk boldly in my purpose,ââ Chandler, 34, said. âIâm here to let the next person know you can make it past grief, and you donât have to look like what you are going through.ââ\n\nChandler broke again in 2021 when her best friend, Areyelle Yarbrough, was tragically killed in Birmingham. Chandler turned to God again for direction and found comfort and healing. This time, she shared her faith walk on her social media platforms, encouraging people to take a fresh approach on how to use essential tools to navigate and cope with grief in a healthy manner. She wanted people to see that it is possible to bounce back when things seem impossible.\n\nThe Birmingham native said that one woman, a total stranger, saw her story and told Chandler that just by seeing her story, she changed her mind about committing suicide.\n\nâLife is going to life, but God is going to God,â said Chandler, who is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. âYou are not a bad person when you go through your trials and tribulations. It just means you have been chosen. But you have to ask yourself will you let the pain break you or make you.ââ\n\nDuring her healing journey, Chandler went to graduate school and obtained a masterâs degree in 2020 and an education specialist degree in 2023, both from the University of West Alabama.\n\nToday, Chandler serves in administration as an Instructional Specialist with the Birmingham City Schools system. In her spare time, she runs Queen O Empowerment LLC, where she is an empowerment coach, a motivational speaker, a mentor, and a fashion ambassador for distinct brands. She said God has also opened her heart to being loved again.\n\nâEven in your brokenness, God will put you back, piece by piece, and you will become His masterpiece,ââ she said. âGod has given me beauty for my ashes.ââ\n\nMarch 6 â Caroline Foster\n\nEvery day, Caroline Foster slipped on her sneakers, ready for her routine two-mile walk through her neighborhood. As she hit play on her favorite podcast, she couldnât help but think how cool it would be to have other women with similar interests join her.\n\nâI was like, âWow, this podcast is great. But I really wish I could talk to someone to make this walk go by faster,ââ she said.\n\nEventually, Foster, 33, visited community Facebook groups, asking if anyone was interested in a walking group. What started out with 20 women signing up for Fosterâs new Bham Babes Walking Club in spring 2023 grew to 2,000 women in just five months. Today, there are nearly 4,000 members.\n\nThe women started with walking on the weekends. Then, some people requested weekday walks. New requests came in for walking dinners and walking brunches, where they eat as a group after a meal. Then people expressed interest in doing hikes at Ruffner Mountain, Red Mountain and Oak Mountain. Foster listened and created monthly calendars to accommodate the requests. There were also requests for starting a book club, hosting evening social events and having a clothing swap for members. Those suggestions made it to the groupâs monthly calendar of activities, too. Membership is free.\n\nBecause people work or live in different parts of Jefferson and Shelby counties, Foster assigned group leaders to lead walks in different areas. On Mondays at 5:30 p.m., for example, the Birmingham walks rotate once a week between Crestwood Park, Railroad Park, City Walk and Highland Park. The walks average about 45 minutes or two miles. There are also walks in Alabaster, Hoover and Pelham. (Check the website for days and times for other areas.)\n\nâSometimes, I think people really underestimate walking. Itâs actually a full-body workout,ââ Jasmine Shaw, 33, said as she walked with the group this week in Crestwood Park. âThese hills and things we go up, they may look small, â¦ but you feel the burn.ââ\n\nGroup leader Haley Martin added that the walking club has introduced her to so many strong and independent women in the Birmingham area and has allowed her to make new friends, which was Fosterâs goal.\n\nâI feel really proud that I was able to start this and bring so many people together of all ages. There are women who have been with us since the beginning, and they show up for every single walk and every single event,ââ Foster said. âI feel hopeful because I think this is going to continue to grow and gain traction. I do feel proud that this has become what it is.ââ\n\nBut the women do more than walk, hike and meet over a meal. They also volunteer and fundraise for different non-profit organizations. They did a fundraiser with Pathways, a Birmingham homeless shelter for women, in 2023; and they plan on doing a fundraiser with the Alzheimerâs Association this year.\n\nFoster also connects with local businesses to find ways for members to explore what the business has to offer. For example, the group has partnered with businesses on kickboxing classes, self-defense classes and yoga. And soon, they will take a walk in Woodlawn and then visit a Woodlawn business for a tour to learn more about its eco-friendly operations. On Saturday, March 16, the group will partner with a business to host a puzzle piece social. On Wednesday, March 20, they will partner with Yelp for a 5:30 p.m. Womenâs History Month recognition walk known as âShe Stepsââ at Birminghamâs Rotary Trail, 2098 First Ave. South.\n\nâWe are all volunteers doing this,ââ said Foster, 33, who is in school to become an esthetician. âI just brought on a community coordinator to work with new and existing businesses and the City of Birmingham to learn about the community and more.ââ\n\nFor more information on the group, visit www.bhambabeswalkingclub.com.\n\nMarch 7 â Christina Johnson\n\nChristina Johnson had always felt a whisper of doubt nagging at the edges of her dreams. As a self-taught artist, she couldnât help but wonder if her work was truly worthy of recognition. Without a college background or formal training, the question of âAm I good enough?â echoed through her mind like a relentless drumbeat.\n\nFor years, Johnson allowed her insecurities to hold her back. Despite her passion for painting, she hesitated to fully commit herself to her craft. But in the last few years, something shifted within her. She made a conscious decision to stop letting fear dictate her path.\n\nIn 2023, Johnson took a leap of faith and participated in Birmingham Art Walk for the first time. She stepped out of her comfort zone and showcased her art, which resonated with many. Later that year, Johnson was selected as the 2024 Artist in Residence for Railroad Park. It was a testament to her growth and determination as an artist.\n\nReflecting on her journey, Johnson realized the power of pushing past fear. âIâm personally in a place where Iâm going to continue to say, âYes,â even if it is terrifying because you grow every time,â she said. âYou learn something new every time. Itâs not as scary as you ever thought it was.â\n\nIn celebration of Womenâs History Month, several of Johnsonâs art pieces will be on display in the first-ever StrongHer exhibit on the second floor of Birmingham City Hall. The exhibit, which features inspirational quotes selected by Johnson to go with each piece, will open on March 8, which is International Womenâs Day. It will remain up through mid-April.\n\nThe exhibit is called: âTextures of Strength,â giving a nod to how Johnson paints with acrylic, adding texture and layers to different pieces with the help of fabric, paper and even jewelry to highlight her personal journey of growth and discovery.\n\nâA lot of pieces represent me, one way or another. They may not necessarily look like me, but they represent my soul,â said Johnson, 46, who is a married mother of three. âSo, my hope is that these pieces â¦ show the strength that we carry as women. I think there is an immense strength when you bring us together.â\n\nWith each brushstroke of courage on the canvas, Johnson, who prays over each piece and writes a scripture or saying on the back of each piece, admits that sheâs come a long way from the self-doubting artist who questioned her own worth.\n\nâPeople will miss out on incredible experiences, incredible encounters and incredible gifts because of fear,â she said. âOnce you get to the other side, you look back and you literally are questioning yourself, asking, âWhat was I afraid of?ââ\n\nMarch 8 â Milana âLaLaâ Price\n\nMilana âLaLaâ Price was 4 years old when a medical report shook her family to its core: she had a rare form of lung cancer and half of her right lung and the mass behind it had to be removed.\n\nThere were questions of how Milana would be after the surgery. But at just 4 years old, the Birmingham native assured her mother that things would be OK.\n\nAnd they were.\n\nDoctors caught the cancer in time before radiation was necessary, and Milana pushed to do things on her own after staying at Childrenâs Hospital for a week.\n\nâShe did everything just like a normal kid,â said MIlanaâs mother, Imaan Cross. âShe just had to have a little help in and out of the bed. It was normal. She colored. She ate. She had normal conversations.â\n\nâI donât think her scare was like mine. Hers was, âNow, I know Iâm better.ââ\n\nAs Milana got older and visited the Titusville Library, her positive outlook caught the eye of Titusville Library Branch Manager Reba Williams. Williams invited Milana to speak at the libraryâs breast cancer awareness event in October 2023 to discuss her journey of resilience. Milana, who is now 9 years old, was the youngest speaker that day.\n\nâWhen different voices are represented, from children to adults, and they address the struggles of life involving cancer and other issues, it brings major impact,â Williams said. âHer comments made such an impact on the\n\naudience, there was not a dry eye in the building.â\n\nVictories continued for Milana, who wants to be an artist and a pilot. In December 2023, she rung the traditional bell at Childrenâs Hospital to celebrate being a cancer survivor. And during the month of March 2024, one of her pencil drawings will be featured in the StrongHer art exhibit on the second floor at Birmingham City Hall.\n\nâShe is my idol, and she doesnât even know it,â Milanaâs mother said. âGrowing up, I wasnât even as strong as she is.â\n\nâSheâs an encourager in her own little way.â\n\nMarch 9 â Genita Matthews\n\nHuffman Middle School Principal Genita Matthews is committed to empowering her female students through an annual event she hosts â The Female Summit. This summit brings together a diverse group of speakers from the community, each sharing their unique stories of overcoming challenges. From doctors to entrepreneurs, these women showcase the power of resilience and determination, inspiring students to believe in their own potential.\n\nFor Matthews, the summit is about more than just inspiring speeches. Itâs also about fostering hope and possibility in her students. She believes that with dedication and perseverance, they can achieve anything they set their minds to.\n\nThe impact of the summit extends beyond the students themselves. Parents are invited to attend sessions as well, and their emotional reactions speak volumes about the eventâs significance. âWe had parents to break down. They said that this not only helps the child, but this helps them, too,â Matthews said.\n\nThe speakers also walk away with something â an interest in returning as a mentor. Matthews said sheâs had several speakers come back to mentor the students, forming lasting connections that continue long after the summit ends.\n\nPrior to working at Huffman Middle, Matthews implemented empowerment initiatives for female students at other Birmingham schools where she worked. Some of Matthewsâ proudest moments were those spent witnessing the transformation in her students: their newfound confidence their belief in themselves, and their determination to chase their dreams. She offered similar summits for the male students, too.\n\nMatthews, 48, sees the summits as a testament to the power of education, positivity, and the unwavering belief that every child has the potential to change the world.\n\nâI see people connecting. The girls becoming happy and excited,â said Matthews, who has been with Birmingham City Schools for 25 years. âThe students say they wish they could do it every day.â\n\nIf anyone is interested in serving as a student mentor, they can contact Matthews at gnolen@bhm.k12.al.us.\n\nMarch 10 â Mia Watkins and Glenny Brock\n\nMia Watkins entered a Birmingham grocery store, focused on the simple task of buying a can of chili beans to make her motherâs chili recipe. As she walked the aisle, she thought of when her mother made the hearty dish and how the two would sit down and have a bowl. Those were good times.\n\nThen, suddenly, Watkins bumped into her friend, Glenny Brock.\n\nAs they chatted, Watkins couldnât help but feel a pang of sadness. Motherâs Day weekend was coming, and the absence of her mother loomed large in her mind. Watkins was 29 years old when she lost her mother in 2015 to complications from multiple sclerosis.\n\nTears welled in Watkinsâ eyes that spring day in 2017 as she spoke of missing her mother, her voice filling with emotion. Brock, ever compassionate, comforted her friend, and cried, too, because Brockâs mother died in a car accident when Brock was eight years old. Brock was familiar with the grief Motherâs Day brings when your mom is no longer alive.\n\nBoth remembered the pain they felt every year in seeing Motherâs Day commercials, walking by stacks of Motherâs Day cards at stores, and being bombarded by online Motherâs Day promos. It was tough. Really tough.\n\nAmidst the sniffles, tears and even some laughs, Brock had an idea â they should host an event on Motherâs Day weekend for other people like them and call it Dead Motherâs Day Brunch. It would be a chance to come together, not to dwell on the sadness of their loss, but to celebrate the love they have for their mothers.\n\nWith a shared sense of purpose, Watkins and Brock set out to make their idea a reality in 2018. Brock contacted Rojo restaurant in Birmingham, and the restaurant owners agreed to provide its back room for the event. As word spread, some people criticized the eventâs title, saying the title was too crass. But those who voiced opposition still had living mothers. The organizers did not change the name. Their purpose was too important to change.\n\nâMy dad always said my mother would be proud of me just because of the bold language, the wit and the grief,â said Brock, who helped lead the restoration project of the Lyric Theatre in 2016. âI want anyone who wants to come, to come because it is a great gift. We do it on Saturday because we are not trying to ruin Motherâs Day for everybody else.â\n\nOn Motherâs Day weekend 2018, the back room at Rojo buzzed with activity as people gathered, united by the common bond of loss. There were no eulogies or formalities, just hugs, smiles, and shared stories of love. A jazz band played.\n\nâPeople who have lost their moms, they totally get it,â Brock said. âThat first year, people kept coming up to Mia and me, saying, âIâm just so relived.â Listen, saving the Lyric was great. But I think doing the Dead Motherâs Day Brunch is the best thing Iâve done in my life.â\n\nIn that moment, surrounded by friends old and new, Watkins knew that she wasnât alone in her grief. And as she shared a hug with Brock, she felt grateful for the connection they shared and the healing power of their Dead Motherâs Day brunch.\n\nâWhen you lose your mother, you lose your first tether to the world. And you feel like you are just floating with no way to come down,â said Watkins, a Birmingham communications professional. âThat brunch has helped immensely because it can be hard to be around the house and not do anything.â\n\nThis year will mark the fifth anniversary of the brunch. (They didnât have it in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic.) It will be held at Rojo on May 11 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Attendees, if they want, may bring a copy of a photo of their mother, which Brock will lovingly post at Momâs Basement, a popular neighborhood bar in Birmingham, as a tribute to the women who shaped them. They are also looking at how they can share grief resources with others and spread the concept beyond Birmingham.\n\nâIâm really so grateful for Mia,â Brock said. âNeither one of us would have done it without the other.â\n\nFor more info on the Dead Motherâs Day Brunch, visit https://fb.me/e/50U2cir5b\n\nMarch 11 â Ebony Hill\n\nEbony Hillâs Google calendar sort of looks like a box of crayons.\n\nShe has color-coded schedules for her two sons, Skyler and Ethan, ages 6 and 13; her husband, David; the coupleâs business, Gifted Hands Embroidery, LLC; herself as she works as a social worker to help house homeless military veterans in Birmingham; church; and more. She also runs the social media accounts, scheduling and website for Ethanâs Heart-Bags4Blessings, her sonâs non-profit organization, which has received national recognition and awards through the years for how he helps the homeless in Birmingham.\n\nâFrom the time we hit the floor at 5 in the morning until the time we turn the lights off at 10 at night, we are going with somebody or doing something,ââ said Hill, 39, of the Spring Lake neighborhood in Birmingham.\n\nSheâs now working on a new color code in her calendar, which is a personal promise to make 2024 her âGo Get It Year.â\n\nâEverything that Iâve backburnered or that I was afraid of, Iâm going to get it in 2024,â she said.\n\nFor years, Hill has written her goals, prayers and thoughts in journals. This year, she pursued her dream to design her own journal line, âWrite the Vision.â She also plans to write a couple of books, including a coloring book; and illustrate a book that Ethan is planning.\n\nShe said she set the goal to go for more this year because sheâs always encouraged her sons to give 100 percent in what they do. Apparently, her sons are listening and watching.\n\nâEthan did an interview about a month or two ago, and I just happened to be there when he said, âIâm trying to match my momâs energy. I want to give and do as much as she does,ââ Hill recalled.\n\nHearing those comments hit Hill like a ton of bricks.\n\nâIf Iâm pushing him to go after his dreams and do all this stuff, then Iâm going to do the same thing. Iâm taking an exam on (March 12) that I have been afraid to take for over 10 years,â she said. âAnd so, my family has been pushing me to study, pushing me to go do my homework. So, now, Iâm going to take that exam.â\n\nNo matter how things go on March 12, Hill said that just her showing up is big because she is conquering fear.\n\nâFear will block you from doing anything. Itâs all mental,â she said. âSo just taking charge of that is empowering for myself. Itâs me getting out of my own way.â\n\nâAt this point, Iâm showing (my sons) the initiative to at least try. You only lose the battles you refuse to fight.â\n\nFor more information on the journal, it can be found in Hillâs Gifted Hands Embroidery Etsy store.

But trying to get people to understand the concept of SisterGolf, her new professional and business development company, was a struggle for the former bank executive from Miami, who learned to play golf to improve her sales on a work team made up of all men.\n\nWhen she attended events and meetings to spread the word about SisterGolf in Birmingham, people were confused about her business. Was she a golf instructor? Was she a nonprofit? Was she solely focused on teaching Black women how to play golf?\n\nShe didnât let the questions deter her. Since she was new in town, she worked to build her foundation. She also improved the messaging of her website content, which underwent four redesigns.\n\nShe had to remain strong when she set up her vendor table at events because some women turned away at the mere mention of golf. âIâm not being facetious. They would turn around and sprint away like thereâs the plague,â Sylla said. âI had a few people come over and say, âI could never do that,â or âThatâs just not for me.ââ\n\nThere was so much fear and intimidation around golf and women that it shocked Sylla.\n\nBut she knew this was something people needed in the Birmingham area. In late 2013-early 2014, she posted on social media that she was hosting an informational meeting on how women can play golf in business. To her surprise, a lot of women attended. That meeting is what gave her the impetus to continue.\n\nThere was interest. She just needed to get the word out more.\n\nSylla forged a relationship with Highland Park Golf Course in Birmingham and started doing post-work events and Saturday morning sessions that attracted more women. She then offered a four-week golf education workshop at Innovation Depot, covering golf etiquette, scoring, what to wear, golf terminology, golf rules, how to set a tee time, etc. Several women who had been going to the golf course with their spouses for years told Sylla that her course taught them more than their husbands knew.\n\nâThat made me feel like I was definitely bringing value,â Sylla said, adding she is now working on offering a digital online class later this month. In April 2024, she will return with her group golf lessons. On March 20, she will host a monthly webinar for SisterGolf members. She also works with companies and organizations in providing workshops, which are open to women of all races.\n\nâEvery time I felt like giving up, I got a call the next day from someone or ran into someone who said, âShella, thank you so much. I used this and it helped me in this fashion.â Or âI just played in my first tournament by myself, and I connected with a CEOâ¦'â she said.\n\nMost of her workshops are held at Highland Park Golf Course. Practice sessions are held at area golf courses with public access. And because golf can be an expensive sport, Sylla offers resources on where women can find deals on golf clothes and discounts on equipment.\n\nâI still feel like Iâm on a journey and there is more to go,â she said.\n\nFor more information, visit sistergolf.com.\n\nMarch 13 â Mykia âKiaâ Ruffin\n\nThree weeks after Mykia âKiaâ Ruffin had her baby daughter in 2013, her mother died. Ruffin didnât know how she could go on.\n\nBut one day, Ruffin heard a message from nationally known preacher, author and filmmaker T.D. Jakes, who said, âThere is purpose in your pain,â and Ruffin decided to shift her focus.\n\nâInstead of being a grinch around the holidays and pulling away from my family, I decided to honor her,â Ruffin said of her mother, Denise L. Hall.\n\nHer mother was a giver, helping anyone in need. So, every year on her motherâs birthday in July, Ruffin blesses other people with household products or meals. Ruffin, who is a personal chef in Birmingham and owner of Kiaâs Kitchen, has been doing the donated birthday meals since 2017. Some of the dishes she creates are ones her mother taught her.\n\nâWhen God tells me to do something, I have to be obedient,â Ruffin said.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Ruffin was up in the wee hours of the morning, looking for Lysol and other hard-to-find essential products to make care packages for others. Another year, Ruffin invited people on her Facebook business page to pay it forward and give names of people needing a free lunch.\n\nRuffinâs mother would have been 60 in 2023, so Ruffin gave away 60 plated meals to honor her. Nominations were submitted, and names were randomly selected. Also in 2023, Ruffin gave away nine private dining experiences. Those winners were also randomly selected.\n\nRuffin later learned that one of the dining experience entries not selected belonged to a woman needing a kidney transplant. The womanâs story touched Ruffinâs heart, and Ruffin created a special giveaway just for her: people could buy a raffle ticket for the kidney patientâs dining experience and the proceeds would help bring the womanâs kidney donor to Birmingham.\n\nâFor me, I donât want people to see me. Iâm just a willing vessel,â said Ruffin, who received the most votes in 2022 as âBirminghamâs Top Female Chef in the Cityâ from Young Entrepioneers. âGod uses me. I want people to see Him when they see me.â\n\nRuffin is not yet sure what she will do this year to honor her mother, but whatever God places on her heart, she knows it will be good. âSometimes, people cannot afford to do the simple things, so, why not be a blessing,â she said.\n\nMarch 14 â Jennifer Hatchett\n\nFor the last 11 years, Jennifer Hatchett has served as executive director of YouthServe, Inc., which connects youth from the various communities across the metro region to work together on service projects and hone their leadership skills.\n\nOne program that recently wrapped is the organizationâs Youth Philanthropy Council, which is for grades 10-12. Close to 50 students from dozens of schools, different backgrounds, races, religions â some first-generation immigrants â spent a year digging into the challenges facing them while growing up in Alabama. They then organized a competitive grant program to support local nonprofits working toward a better future for them.\n\nThey selected organizations working for education equity, inclusive spaces for youth, and community revitalization, and recognized the groups during the programâs grant award ceremony.\n\nTwo presenting seniors who stood out to Hatchett during the ceremony, talked about how important YouthServe programs have been to them and how staff has always been there for them, encouraging and empowering them to speak up.\n\nâThey, like so many before them, mentioned how this process helped them to come out of their shells and become leaders when they didnât realize they could be leaders. That is the heart of YouthServe,â Hatchett said. âI hope they will always know they are loved and supported by me and by the staff, but the real heroes of YouthServe are the youth themselves.â\n\nOver the years, several former YouthServe students have carried that confidence with them to go on to become leaders in public policy, law, advocacy, business, health, education and tech.\n\nâI always tell my friends if they see a YouthServe alum, just hire them. They will be the innovators, the team players and the visionaries,â she said.\n\nBy the end of this program year, YouthServe will have reached nearly 2,000 youth from more than 80 schools across metro Birmingham and the state. There are no fees, school nominations, competitive interviews, recommendations or GPA requirements for students to participate in YouthServe. All that is required is a studentâs commitment of time and presence.\n\nâThrough this role, I share my love of Birmingham with the incredibly diverse, amazing and inspiring youth from throughout the metro area,â said Hatchett.\n\nHatchettâs passion for Birmingham, which was planted when she was new to the city and enrolled as a freshman at Birmingham-Southern College, extends far beyond her work at YouthServe. Itâs woven into every aspect of her life.\n\nâFrom promoting diversity efforts with the Birmingham Museum of Art and supporting arts and cultural festivals as a volunteer and patron, to buying a home and laying roots down in this city I love, it has been wonderful to watch it change and grow along with my family,â said Hatchett, of Birminghamâs Crestwood South neighborhood.\n\nNow, Hatchett has started a new adventure with BlindSpot Consulting, where she helps other nonprofits and their leaders succeed. Itâs just another way for her to contribute to the city she loves.\n\nFor more information on YouthServe, visit youthservebham.org.\n\nMarch 15 â Kim Richardson\n\nFor 16 years, Kim Richardson ran a Birmingham-based grants consulting business that secured more than $125 million in grants awarded and managed for clients from all over the country. But in 2023, she decided to press pause on her business to focus on her passions and teach yoga full time.\n\nâKim, what are you doing?â was a question she heard a lot after she decided to step away from her business. But she recognized that she was tired, burned out and had grown weary of the massive applications and multiple grant application deadlines. She needed time to focus on herself and what nourished her while contemplating the evolution of her grants business.\n\nâThere is a never an ideal time to take a break. Too often, itâs an illness that will shut you down. I wanted to take time off with intention,â Richardson, 51, said of the sabbatical. âThis was an opportunity to say, âI want to pivot. Iâm recognizing, in myself, the signs and symptoms of fatigue.â Itâs really difficult to write a federal grant application if you canât focus.â\n\nAs she practiced yoga to relieve stress, Richardson was also noticing that she wasnât seeing other African Americans taking yoga or teaching yoga in the local studios she visited. She wanted to change that. Since yoga is a good way to relieve stress, combat depression and manage anxiety, Richardson wanted to help spread the experience and benefits of yoga within her community.\n\nâI wanted to get the word out about the benefits of yoga. If you can breathe, you can do yoga,â said Richardson, a resident of the Roebuck Springs neighborhood.\n\nRichardson has been practicing yoga for nearly 10 years, and in 2018, she became a 200-hour registered yoga teacher to help increase representation in the yoga community. Today, she is a certified yoga therapist. She is trained to teach a variety of styles, including aquatic yoga, chair yoga, prenatal yoga, oncology yoga, childrenâs yoga and more through her new company, Yes You Yoga Wellness. She uses her grant writing skills to secure funding so she can offer certain classes for no cost or low cost. A grant even helped her provide mats for participants when she teaches yoga at the Donald Hawkins Rec Center on Wednesday nights at 6:30. (The free, beginner classes will return on April 10. )\n\nEven before she started teaching yoga full time, Richardson was working to bring yoga to as many groups as she could. She taught evening classes for over a year at the downtown Birmingham public library, starting in 2018. She partnered with the Prison Yoga Project to pilot a yoga program for inmates at the Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2019. She worked a group of yoga teachers to spearhead a pilot yoga and mindfulness class for fifth graders at three Birmingham City Schools in 2022. Periodically, she introduces yoga to Birmingham police officers at the precincts.\n\nAs a facilitator for UABâs Arts in Medicine Program, she leads yoga sessions at Childrenâs Hospital every week, offering yoga to in-patient and out-patient children and teenagers with complex behavioral health needs. She also offers a weekly Yoga for Cancer class and leads virtual and in-person classes for veterans through the Birmingham VA. Richardson is also part of a research team at UAB, where they are looking to see if yogic breathing will improve the quality of life for individuals living with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrigâs Disease.\n\nâYoga is about much more than being able to do poses,â Richardson said. âIt relieves suffering. It can invite ease and relaxation into your everyday life.â\n\nA recent national award is proof of the impact Richardson is making in the community. In June 2023, Richardson was nationally recognized by the International Association of Yoga Therapists as one of only four national finalists for their Seva Award, which recognizes yoga therapists for their service to underserved communities.\n\nFor more information on Richardson, visit www.yesyouyoga.org or check her IG page at @yesyouyoga_wellness.\n\nMarch 16 â Angela Hunter\n\nItâs Friday night in the Hunter household, and Angela Hunter is busy getting things ready for her 9-year-old daughter, Ana Grace, to compete in a beauty pageant today at 2 p.m. Itâs Ana Graceâs second competition in two years.\n\nDress? Check. Nails? Done. Hair? Perfect. Everything is in place, and the family is hoping for another win. But even if there is not a win for Ana Grace, just getting to this point has been a victory for Angela. In September 2014, Angela was 36 and digesting the news of having Stage III breast cancer. As Angela underwent chemotherapy treatments, she wondered about the future.\n\nâWill I be here for my babiesâ proms?â âWill I be here for the very important moments?â\n\nThe questions hung heavy in the air like fog on a misty morning. But Angela didnât let the thoughts stop her from seeing the other side. She wrote down goals for her two children and husband, and she was determined to experience those milestones. Her mission was clear: âFight for my babies.â\n\nToday, Angela is cancer-free, and sheâs not only continuing to fight to live for her babies, but she is also fighting to help other women impacted by breast cancer. Through her My Beauty For Ashes non-profit organization, she raises money to help women pay for things when a cancer diagnosis cuts deep into their budget.\n\nAngela, now 45, knows what itâs like to work to make ends meet when there are mounting doctor bills and not enough money to cover it all. Some organizations offer grants to help cancer patients, but not everyone is selected. Angela experienced that, and the rejection hurt. She wants to ease some of that pain in the pockets.\n\nThrough her âWhatâs Nextâ grants, sheâs helped 20 women with breast cancer in the last four years, providing funding to help with things such as rent, utilities and beauty enhancements. And with 2024 marking 10 years that sheâs been cancer-free, Angela, who had a bilateral mastectomy, wants to raise $10,000 and provide a $1,000 grant for each the 10 women selected this year so they can get the things they need. Applications will open in August 2024, and the grants will be open to women whoâve had cancer within the last seven years. The winners will be announced at her âWhite Out Breast Cancerâ event in August.\n\nBeauty for Ashes keeps Angela busy, but not too busy to take time for husband, William Hunter Jr., and her children. Her son, Jaxon, was 3 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Ana Grace was 3 months old. Now, that Ana Grace is 9 years old and Jaxson is 12 years old, the milestones continue to mount for Angela.\n\nâIf you just keep going, there is beauty on the other side,â she said. âI know that sounds clichÃ©. But had I not kept going, I would not have been able to experience the beauty of going on my sonâs fifth grade trip to D.C. and getting my baby ready for the pageant.â\n\nFor more information about her organization, visit www.mybeautyforashes.org.\n\nMarch 17 â Aisha Taylor\n\nAisha Taylor is one brave woman.\n\nSheâs brave because she started a business.\n\nSheâs brave because she opened that business during the pandemic.\n\nAnd sheâs brave because that business targets men.\n\nâPeople tell me all the time that Iâm brave. âBut those who know me, know me, know that I donât operate in the spirit of fear,â she said. âIâm big on prayer and faith. So, for me, the faith of a mustard seed keeps me going.â\n\nHer vision for opening Bridge + Root upscale menâs clothing store had been brewing within her for nearly 10 years. And when she finally had the opportunity to secure the perfect space in downtown Birmingham in the summer of 2020, she didnât hesitate. Months later in 2021, she opened her doors to high praise. Men loved her unique blazers, fedoras, beard products and cologne, and they delved into the assortment of ties, joggers, pocket squares, graphic T-shirts, cufflinks and more.\n\nIt was like their own kind of haberdashery heaven, right here in the Magic City.\n\nBut there were also men who challenged Taylor, asking her, among other things, how long sheâd been in the business and if she knew how to tie a tie.\n\nTaylor, whoâs been in the fashion business for more than 25 years, has a personal styling background and has a degree in business administration from the University of Alabama, didnât let their doubt deter her.\n\nâI donât get moved by those types of things. I know what I know,â said Taylor, 48, a married mother with two children.\n\nHer know-how has turned heads for those in fashion and finance. Last September, the Alabama Retail Association named Taylor Alabamaâs 2023 Gee Retailer of the Year.\n\nâThat award confirms and solidifies that hard work does pay off,â Taylor said. âThere are a lot of ups and downs when you run a business, and just to be recognized in such a manner is just amazing.â\n\nPeople are at the core of what Taylor does at Bridge + Root. In 2023, she did a tie drive for nearly 150 students with Birmingham City Schools and taught them how to tie ties. She plans to do it again this year. In February 2024, she raised funds to take students from Woodlawn High School, her alma mater, to Atlanta, have lunch and tour the World of Coca-Cola Museum. To qualify, students had to write an essay.\n\nSome of the students had never been outside of Birmingham, and Taylor saw the trip as a way for them to express themselves through writing and experience something new. Taylor impacts young people in other areas of Birmingham by offering internships through the Birmingham Promise. She also provides a space in her store, known as the Localâs Corner, for area creatives to sell their wares. The first person featured in the Localâs Corner, did so well that he has now advanced to having his own storefront.\n\nTo broaden her community outreach even more, Taylor plans to host monthly, virtual menâs mental health conversations known as âThe Lounge.â She, a licensed physiatrist and men will address often overlooked topics facing men. It will start this summer.\n\nâTo me, fashion is more than what we wear,â Taylor said. âItâs what you put out into the world.â\n\nFor more information on the store, visit www.bridgeandroot.com. The store faces First Avenue North, between 22nd and 23rd streets North. It is across the street from the Wine Loft and Adios.\n\nMarch 18 â Deborah Rice\n\nBy day, Deborah Rice crunches numbers as an accountant for Alabama Power Co. But in her spare time, she turns into a walking billboard to fight a chronic disease sheâs had since 1999.\n\nRice, 55, has sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that can affect almost any organ. Something as simple as catching a cold can put her on her back for a week. There are also muscle aches and fatigue. Whenever she has a flare-up, she fights to recover so she can keep educating people about the disease because some people donât even know they have it. Itâs more common in women.\n\nâI try my best to just push, push, push because I donât want this thing to get the best of me,â Rice said. âAnd I feel if I donât push, itâs doing just that.â\n\nRice volunteers as a community outreach leader with the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research and UAB. As a volunteer, she lets people know about resources that can help them better understand the disease, which affects patients in different ways. Oftentimes, she spreads the word while wearing a purple T-shirt that says: âAsk Me About Sarcoidosis.â\n\nâSarcoidosis is a complicated disease, and the difficulties in properly diagnosing sarcoidosis only heighten the need for more public awareness,â she said. âWe have to educate ourselves when it comes to our health. With sarcoidosis, things may look good on paper, but itâs not good. It is then that the doctors truly rely on us, the patient.â\n\nOver the years, sheâs asked states to issue proclamations to declare April as Sarcoidosis Awareness Month. Alabama did it in 2016. The City of Birmingham followed. In 2017, Rice secured proclamations from 17 other states. But what she noticed was that even though the proclamations were issued, people still were not talking about it enough.\n\nâI wish to get the community more involved when it comes to sarcoidosis. The time for sarcoidosis is now,â she said. âI know there are a lot of sarcoidosis patients throughout Birmingham, Jefferson County and the surrounding areas. I just want to give them hope and courage.â\n\nIn fall 2023, Walgreens partnered with the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research to increase awareness about the disease and stress how important it is for patients to get preventative shots for the flu, Covid and pneumonia. In Birmingham, Rice visited three Walgreens to promote the shots and answer customersâ questions.\n\nOn her outings, Rice reminds patients that they are their No. 1 advocate when it comes to their health, and that they should thoroughly review and understand their medical records. She also encourages movement. Despite dealing with joint and muscle discomfort, Rice remains an avid walker.\n\nâI tell myself all the time, if you stop moving, itâs going to get bad. Continue to move. Continue to push,â she said. âThat allows me to not just go through sarcoidosis but to rise above it.â\n\nFor more information on the disease, visit www.stopsarcoidosis.org.\n\nMarch 19 â The Ladies Greek Orthodox Philoptochos Society\n\nIn 1972, a group of determined women from Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Cathedral in downtown Birmingham set out on a culinary crusade, aiming to share their rich cultural heritage through food. What began as a humble endeavor has flourished into an epic tradition, captivating taste buds and hearts beyond the state lines of Alabama.\n\nWelcome to the Greek Food Festival, now in its 51st year! (They took a pause in 2020 because of the pandemic.) This isnât just any food festival. Itâs a testament to the spirit of Greek women and their families. Organized by the Ladies Greek Orthodox Philoptochos Society, these passionate women cook up a storm, using recipes passed down from their grandmothers and great-grandmothers who traveled to Birmingham from Greece so many years ago. The plates they sell every year, help raise money for local and national charities.\n\nâThe festival has definitely grown into one of the premier cultural events in the Southeast,â said volunteer Elaine Lyda, who helps promote the event. âWe have visitors who come all three days through the drive-thru. I know that for a fact because I have waited on them.â\n\nGenerations of women, inspired by their matriarchs, whip up traditional dishes that sing with flavors passed down through the ages. Lydaâs late mother, Boula Constantine, was one of the volunteers who helped start the festival. Lyda would sit in the kitchen and watch her mother pour her heart into meals so money could be raised to help others. The recipes used by Lydaâs mother and other women are still used to this day.\n\nâWe havenât changed any of the recipes over the years. Itâs a tribute to them, and thatâs why people keep coming back,â Lyda said.\n\nBesides food, the festival features a blend of culture and camaraderie. Picture this: children twirling on stage, their feet tapping to the rhythm of Greek music, while volunteers hustle, ensuring every gyro is wrapped with love. People also take tours of the downtown Birmingham church. From age 5 to 18, Lyda danced on stage during the festival. Her children did the same. Once children reach the age of 18, they move on to other volunteer positions. Lydaâs whole family gets involved every year. Men volunteer, too.\n\nâMy husband converted to be Greek, and heâs part of the drive-thru,â Lyda laughed. âItâs a true labor of love.â\n\nVolunteers plan for months to ensure that the festival runs smoothly and offers savory fare. From the melt-in-your-mouth Greek lasagna (pastichio) to the heavenly butter twist cookies (koulourakia), every bite is a journey to the sun-drenched shores of Greece.\n\nElene Giattina, daughter of pastichio maestro Becky Kampakis, and Sonthe Burge, mastermind behind the koulourakia, carry on their mothersâ legacies with pride by leading the committees responsible for making two of the most popular dishes at the festival. Thereâs also souvlakia pastichio, Greek chicken, spanokopeta, veggie plates, Greek salad, baklava and more.\n\nâI have always said: âCome experience a taste of Greece without the airfare,ââ Lyda said.\n\nThis year, the festival will be held on Oct. 3-5. For more information, visit www.bhamgreekfestival.com.\n\n**(Pictured in the photo, from left, are Elene Giattina, Elaine Lyda and Sonthe Burge.)\n\nMarch 20 â Taneka Gillard\n\nIn 2009, Taneka Gillardâs daughter, Reign, was born with a rare congenital neurological disorder.\n\nAs Gillard lovingly cared for her daughter, who is also non-verbal, a paraplegic and vision impaired, she found it hard to find resources to improve her care. She also became frustrated about laws and the lack of funding that impacted the care she sought.\n\nEvery day, Gillard advocated for her daughter. And every day, she wondered if other parents with children with disabilities were facing similar struggles. She wanted to do something to make those families and herself feel better, so she started knitting. Her passion turned into something she didnât expect: Big bright colorful hairbows with a major message.\n\nGillard, 50, used the hairbows to shine a light on the various disabilities affecting children, to celebrate diversity and to raise awareness. âEach bow has a different color to represent a disability,â she said. âWe hear about autism. We hear about Down syndrome. But what about Reignâs condition, Dandy-Walker syndrome, and others like it? There needs to be more information.â\n\nThe hairbows have now become a symbol people can wear to show their support. Adults wear the hairbows, too, finding creative ways to sport them as anklets, wristlets, chokers, and broaches. Even those battling diseases like cancer have reached out for bows for their children.\n\nâI donate to a lot of organizations because I want my babies to feel pretty and cute,â said Gillard, who named the hairbows Reignbows in 2012.\n\nBut Gillard saw more gaps that needed filling. So, in 2023, she founded the iReign Special Needs Support Group Alabama on Facebook, a place where she shares resources and support for parents.\n\nâThe âiâ is lowercase and it means that no matter what, we are going to reign over our circumstances,â she said. âOur children have a lot of doctorsâ appointments and surgeries. So, a disability can weigh on the child as well as on the parent or caregiver. You have to miss a lot of workdays.â\n\nShe posts three times a week on the page: âEducational Mondayâ for learning about disabilities; âResource Wednesdayâ for practical information like finding wheelchair-accessible vehicles; and âFantastic Fridayâ for celebrating wins.\n\nThe impact extends beyond the virtual world. She visits expos and schools in Birmingham, connecting with parents and listening to their concerns, like what can the mother of two children with special needs do when she canât enroll both of them at the same daycare center and what can caregivers do beyond retirement when it comes to caring for their children.\n\nGillard, who is a nurse, reminds people that if they know someone caring for a child with a disability, it doesnât hurt to call or check on the parent and tell them they are doing a good job.\n\nâSay or write something like: âGod bless you,â or âI am praying for your strength,ââ she said. âThere was a time where I was like, âI donât get invited for the holidays or anywhere because people just assumed that I canât make it, or they donât have the accommodations.â Call and check on that family and make sure they are OK.â\n\nFor more information about Reignbows, visit www.shopreignbowsonline.com.\n\nMarch 21 â Ann Niles\n\nVolunteer Ann Niles is one of the first smiling faces people see when they enter the rotunda of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.\n\nShe greets visitors and tells them there is an eight-minute film about the cityâs civil rights history they can watch before they take a self-guided tour of the institute.\n\nâI tell them that the film really gets them ready for what they are about to experience,â she says.\n\nAnd that experience involves passing by exhibits that show segregation in the South, African Americansâ fight for equality, and what happened during the 1963 civil rights movement in Birmingham.\n\nNiles, 77, can offer first-hand accounts about Birminghamâs movement because she lived it. At the age of 16, she joined other children to march and protest segregation. She was arrested and jailed for five days and nights at the Jefferson County Jail.\n\nOne night, she and other girls were moved into a small space. It was hot. A lawman poured water onto the floor. One girl fainted, face down. All the girls screamed. Then, the lawmen let them out and returned them to their cell.\n\nâThat stays with me. I will never forget it,â says Niles, who was a junior at Parker High School at the time. âIt was the most frightening thing that ever happened to me.â\n\nNiles looks at her involvement in the movement as a privilege, one that she was honored to be able to participate. She shares her memories in her 2020 book, âMy Story: A Child of the Civil Rights Movement,â which she says she wrote for her grandchildren after they asked her about her role in Birminghamâs history.\n\nâI didnât write it to make money. I wrote it so they will never forget where we come from and what happened,â says Niles, who is married and has four sons and 11 grandchildren. She worked at Alabama Power for nearly 36 years before retiring.\n\nThis June will mark Nilesâ 27th year as a BCRI volunteer. She volunteers every Thursday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. When asked why sheâs volunteered for so long, she says there is something that keeps pulling her back to BCRI.\n\nâI just like to tell the story and make sure if anybody wants to ask a question about what really happened, I say, âThis is authentic,â Niles says âWhen you look at me, Iâm telling you that I lived it, and whatever is in (BCRI) is for real. Itâs the real deal.â\n\nFor more information about BCRI, visit www.bcri.org.\n\nMarch 22 â Alice Westery\n\nAs founder and executive director of Youth Towers in Birmingham, Alice Westery works with homeless youth by helping them find affordable housing or avoid losing the housing they already have.\n\nShe also provides resources and agencies that can address their various needs such as securing clothing, life and employment skills, credit counseling, tutoring, a job, etc. Some clients have experienced sexual abuse, violence, a lack of family support, etc. Some are runaways. Most have been in the foster care system.\n\nThey know Westery cares about them, which is why they often contact her.\n\nâWhat drives me is if a baby tells me, âIf I donât have anywhere to lay my head tonight, then I gotta do what I gotta do.â So that means that they have to do whatever it is, whether itâs human trafficking, sex trafficking, breaking the law or stealing â¦ in order to be able to survive. I cannot sit by and let that happen,â she said.\n\nâEven if I cannot house a young person during the day, I can just give her some hope,â she said. âThis is what I tell her: âCome back tomorrow. But while you are out there, if you donât show back up, someone cares about you, and they will come looking for you.ââ\n\nWestery started Youth Towers in 2007 after having worked for years as a licensed social worker. She noticed that when young people aged out of the foster care system, they may not have a place to go.\n\nUpon leaving foster care, some young people called Westery, asking her for phone numbers to homeless shelters.\n\nShe works with ages 18 to 26. Most young people call her Mama Westery. But the âreal cool kids,â as she calls them, refer to her as âThe Plug.â\n\nââThe Plugâ means if there is a connection to something, you are âThe Oneââ she said.âThey had to tell me what that meant. They said, âYou are the source. You are the one we can go to and make sure we get connected to get the help that we need.ââ\n\nOutside of Youth Towers, Westery volunteers with several groups, including the Community Affairs Committee; serving as vice president of the Jefferson County Family Resource Center; and serving as vice president of the Pratt City Business Association.\n\nShe is a Birmingham native and lives in the Huntington Hills neighborhood.\n\nâI want to live where the need is,â she said. âI love Birmingham, and I love my neighborhood. I appreciate that we start at home to make home better.â\n\nFor more information, visit www.youthtowers.org.\n\nMarch 23 â Cathy Sloss and Leigh Sloss-Corra\n\nIn Birmingham, where the aroma of Southern cooking fills the air and culinary creativity knows no bounds, two sisters found themselves inspired by a shared passion for food and community. Cathy Sloss and Leigh Sloss-Corra, driven by their love for the cityâs growing food scene, had long thought about how nice it would be to have a multi-day food festival in the Magic City.\n\nBut it wasnât until they attended the International Association of Culinary Professionalsâ 43rd annual conference in Birmingham in 2021, that the seed of their idea really took root. Surrounded by fellow food enthusiasts and industry professionals, Cathy and Leigh were struck by the energy and excitement at the event. As they listened to speakers and tasted the food, they had their a-ha moment.\n\nThey decided it was time to finally have a multi-day food festival that celebrates everything that makes Birminghamâs food scene special.\n\nAnd just like that, the Birmingham Food Plus Culture Fest was born in September 2023, attracting hundreds over four days at venues in Birmingham. National media and others unable to attend last year, told the sisters they would be present in 2024.\n\nCathy said they worked with different food players in Birmingham to help make the event happen. âWe have one of the coolest food systems in the United States, and people not from Birmingham, tell us that all the time,â said Cathy said. âA food system is about eating locally. Buying locally. And growing locally.â\n\nâWe have this huge range of different cultures that have all come together to create these wonderful cuisines that people travel to Birmingham to eat.â\n\nCathy is the founder of the Market at Pepper Place, and Leigh is the executive director of the Market at Pepper Place. Leigh credits her big sister in being the driving force for the conference, which was ranked by USA Today as the No. 3 Best New Food Festival in America in 2023.\n\nâEven if you think an idea of hers is crazy, you better pay attention because if the time is not right for it now, it will be five years from now,â Leigh said.\n\nPeople from 18 states visited the festival. Seventy-two chefs participated, including 30 from as far away as Houston and New York. Eleven performances from award-winning local and regional acts were featured. A majority of the organizers were women.\n\nâThe thing that made it work was the concept for it to represent all the aspects of our culture,â Leigh said. âIt was not meant to be an elitist foodie thing. It was not meant to be just a white tablecloth dinner experience. It was meant to include people from every background, from every culinary tradition and to represent the diversity of the food culture In Birmingham, which makes us so strong and unique.â\n\nThis yearâs festival is slated for Sept. 19-22, with additional days planned to jumpstart the event. For more information on the festival, visit bhamfoodplus.com.\n\nMarch 24 â Valencia Wells\n\nSeveral times a year, optometrist Valencia Wells breaks away from her eye care office on Morris Avenue to volunteer at health fairs and visit schools in Birmingham to educate people about the importance of maintaining good eye health.\n\nThe most common question she gets is: When am I supposed to get an eye exam?\n\nâSome people donât realize how often they should go see an eye doctor. Diabetics should get one every year,â said Dr. Wells, 42. âI even get questions about grandkids and when they should go. Children should go once a year. We try to screen children within the first year of life, before school and Pre-K. Children can have learning deficiencies if they canât see.â\n\nWellsâ attention to detail at a health fair helped alert one man of a major health issue. The man complained of a lazy eye or nerve palsy, something new for him. She measured his eye pressure, which was a little high. She suggested the man go see his doctor. He did. Results came back and showed he had an 80 percent blockage in his aorta.\n\nIn her office, sheâs found issues in patients with diabetes and other eye issues because people have not seen an actual eye doctor.\n\nâWe not only want to be a practice, but we also want to be a presence and a resource for our community,â said Dr. Wells, who has been in practice for 15 years.\n\nDr. Wells graduated from optometry school at UAB, where she is now president of the UAB Optometry Alumni Association. Earlier this month, she met the goal of raising $25,000 to establish an endowed scholarship in honor of the groupâs first African-American president, Dr. Cheryl Cheatham Wilson. Next year, Dr. Wells anticipates meeting the funding requirements to establish a $25,000 scholarship in her own name. Both scholarships will go to African-American optometry students at UAB.\n\nâI feel like our people are 400 years behind, economically. So, we need all the help we can get and all the resources. And if there is anything we can do to make a process easier and provide for our youth financially, we should do so,â she said.\n\nIn 2023, UAB named her as the UAB Young Alumni Rising Star, which was awarded to a young UAB graduate who has shown outstanding achievement in their career, demonstrated notable service to the community, shown a commitment to UAB and is in good standing with the UAB National Alumni Society.\n\nDr. Wells said she knew she wanted to be an eye doctor by eighth grade, which is when she had to write a research paper on what she wanted to be when she grew up. âAnd I tell everybody that the Lord is always working everything out since that day,â said Dr. Wells, who married her college sweetheart, Willie, after meeting him at the University of Alabama. She also pledged Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. while at UA.\n\nFor more information on Dr. Wells, visit www.morrisavenueeyecare.com.\n\nMarch 25 â Sandra âSandiâ Lee\n\nIn 2018, Sandra âSandiâ Lee retired from the Birmingham Public Library after having served 25 years.\n\nBut retirement didnât quite stick for Lee, and she found herself back at the library in a different way.\n\nShe started volunteering in the Friends Bookstore at the downtown location in fall 2019. Then, in January 2020, she joined the libraryâs Friends Foundation, which helps to secure financial support for the libraryâs programs, services and partnerships. She was elected vice president. In 2021, she was elected as president of the Friends Foundation.\n\nIn addition to still volunteering at least one day a week in the bookstore, Lee organizes and hosts the libraryâs spring and fall book sales and supports BPLâs grant applications, special events and projects. Her former co-workers contend she is a true champion for BPL and lives out the mission of the Friends Foundation to support the libraryâs programs, services and partnerships, through fundraising, advocacy and outreach.\n\nWhen asked how her library career path started, Lee said it started her freshman year in college when she took an interest survey. A counselor reviewed the form and told Lee: âYou like to do too many things.â But being a librarian meant Lee could do all things, all in one place. And as a result, the library was the perfect match for her.\n\nLeeâs first gig was a storyteller at the Springville Road Library in Huffman. As a storyteller, Lee saw, firsthand, the magic books held in bringing people together in a room. To her, the library was more than just shelves of books; it was a community hub.\n\nâA library, in its best form, is a place where everybody can come and feel welcomed, see themselves be a part of something â¦ and that they are needed,â she said. âAnd as a librarian, I always had that feeling that I am contributing to the better part of what everybody wants to see in their world.â\n\nFor more information about the Friends Foundation, visit friendsofthebpl.org.\n\nMarch 26 â Jasmine Allen\n\nThough she was a little girl at the time, Jasmine Allen still knew the impact her parents made by bringing the likes of Destinyâs Child, the Isley Brothers, Mary J. Blige, Brandy, and more to the Birmingham Heritage Festival between 1991 and 2003. Her father also worked on national tours for artists such as Luther Vandross and Prince.\n\nâAs a child, I thought my parents were larger than life,â said Allen, now 43. âI always thought that what they did was too big for me.â\n\nSo, instead of booking big musical acts like her parents did, Allen went in the opposite direction and did small events and home services in peopleâs residences. She called her company Girl Friday Concierge. But it didnât take long before someone asked her to do an event in a hospitalâs mammogram department and then at an event space. The requests kept coming, and Allen had to pivot.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Destination Birmingham to handle the demand.\n\nâA good friend of the family, Andre Pettis, said, âJasmine, I have your next event.â I do not know how you will do it, but Birmingham needs it,ââ Allen recalled. âI just took the idea, researched it, I found the contact in Canada and reached out to them.â\n\nâI told the person, âIâm in Birmingham. How do we make this happen?â And the person said they wanted to spread South with their event.â\n\nAllen submitted a bid and a proposal. She went through an interview. A month later, she secured the contract to put on Diner en Blanc in Birmingham, where attendees dress in all white and await details on where they will go to enjoy a posh picnic underneath the stars in a secret location. Diner en Blanc is a concept that started in Paris in 1988, and it has expanded around the globe.\n\nWhen Allen promoted Diner En Blanc Birmingham, people devoured the idea and the tickets her first year in 2019. She said the event attracts about 2,000 people a year, and sheâs planning on doing again this year to mark the fifth year. (They did not do it in 2020 because of the pandemic.)\n\nâI think that so many times, people still look at Birmingham as just that small little city. They have no idea of our culture and arts scene that we possess here,â said Allen. âAt the end of the day, tourism brings money to the city, and we want to be an advocate for that.â\n\nAnd like her parents, Allen is getting into even more musical act promotions, doing it with her company comprised of all women.\n\nShe produced Jefferson County Commissioner Sheila Tysonâs Mardi Gras celebration with Big Freedia at Boutwell Auditorium in February. Sheâs bringing DJ Kid Capri to the Rose All Day Wine and Music Festival on May 11 at Lit on 8th. She is looking at launching the Heritage Gospel Fest near the end of year in Birmingham. And on April 21, she is promoting âThe Masterclass, featuring Rick Ross and the Symphonic Orchestraâ at Boutwell Auditorium.\n\nâIt was never that I didnât want to do what my parents did,â she said. âI didnât know that it was a gift that God had given me until I was older in life.â\n\nFor more information about the Rick Ross concert, visit here\n\nMarch 27 â Sgt. Becky White\n\nBirmingham Police Sgt. Becky White, a trailblazer and guardian of the community, has been serving with honor and distinction for 28 years. Her journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, dedication and the pursuit of excellence in the Magic City.\n\nSgt. White began her career with BPD in 1996. She later broke new ground when she became the first Black female mounted patrol officer in BPD, which was an early indicator of her pioneering spirit. Her climb through the ranks was marked by a series of groundbreaking achievements. She became the first Black female sergeant to be sniper trained within BPDâs Tactical/SWAT division. She has also served as an effective hostage negotiator; a wreck reconstructionist; an airport security specialist; a bike patrol officer; an Investigative Bureau supervisor; a Task Force leader; and a West Precinct sergeant. Her academic accomplishments, including a bachelorâs degree and an associateâs degree in criminal justice as well as an associateâs degree in computer science, underscore her commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.\n\nSgt. Whiteâs role in BPDâs Special Operations Bureau Special Events Unit is an important assignment. With meticulous planning and a deep understanding of logistics, she ensures that major events unfold seamlessly, reflecting her dedication to serving her city with precision and care. She is a member of the ICS Command Team in Birmingham, which pulls together parties from various public safety organizations for major events. She is the teamâs deputy operations sections chief. As a member of that team, she played a crucial role in planning security for the World Games 2022. She is also involved in security for this summerâs Transplant Games and a pivotal organizer for the Police and Fire Games 2025, which will both be held in Birmingham. She is the unseen hand that guides tens of thousands of people through the cityâs most significant gatherings, working tirelessly from dawn until long after dusk.\n\nHer ability to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds is nothing short of remarkable. Sgt. White embodies the principle that policing is not just about maintaining order, but also about building trust and fostering relationships within the community. With her approachable demeanor and empathetic heart, she stands as a bridge between the police force and the residents they serve.\n\nIn the face of adversity, Sgt. White exhibits nerves of steel â a composure that has been honed over countless life-or-death situations. Her focus is unwavering, her courage unshakable. This resolve has earned her numerous accolades, including the prestigious BPDâs Lifesaver Award for her heroic intervention that saved a man threatening to jump from a bridge.\n\nSgt. Whiteâs impact extends far beyond the line of duty. As a devoted family woman, she sets an example of balance and dedication that resonates with her son, who works with another local law enforcement agency. She also has a daughter-in-law and three grandchildren. Sgt. Whiteâs involvement in the community, particularly in mentoring women and participating in outreach ministry, shows her commitment to uplifting others.\n\nHer advice to women contemplating a career in law enforcement is a soul-stirring message: seek knowledge, embrace training and never settle for less than your full potential. Sgt. White encourages women to remain true to themselves, to serve with compassion and humility, and to stand firm in the knowledge that they, too, can make a difference.\n\nShe is definitely forging a path for future generations of women warriors in blue.\n\nMarch 28 â Gwendolyn Cook-Bibb\n\nIllegal dumping had become such a problem in Gwendolyn Cook-Bibbâs East Brownville neighborhood that as soon as City of Birmingham crews picked up abandoned couches, old refrigerators and stoves on a stretch of road, someone illegally dumped more.\n\nFed up with the violators dumping on a major thoroughfare, Cook-Bibb started an anti-dumping campaign in 2023. She organized neighborhood cleanups and ordered metal signs to discourage the illegal dumping of major appliances. It worked.\n\nâThe anti-dumping campaign is good, and I would recommend it to other neighborhoods and other communities,â said Cook-Bibb, who is president of the East Brownville neighborhood. âItâs not hard to start. I created our first signs, and ordered them from a place on the internet. And then, somebody told me about Temu, and I ordered some from them.â\n\nâI have some signs in my trunk right now. I keep them, so if I ride the neighborhood and I see a spot that needs a little attention, Iâll put it out. But if I canât, Iâll get somebody to put it up.â\n\nWhat Cook-Bibb thinks changed the behavior was changing the approach. âWe had signs that said, âSmile, you are on camera,'â she said. âThey look very professional.â\n\nâWe need to really treasure where we live and do our best to help, if we have the help and the strength to make our surroundings beautiful,â said Cook-Bibb, who is also president of the Brownville community, which consists of three neighborhoods. âAnd dumping is certainly not beautiful.â\n\nCook-Bibbâs ideas get results and get noticed. In 2022, she received a community service award for being a neighborhood officer and for organizing neighborhood cleanups during Covid. In 2024, she received a âShero Awardââ for organizing neighborhood meeting conference calls during Covid. Both were given by the Community First organization.\n\nWhen Cook-Bibb is not fighting to improve her neighborhood, sheâs fighting pounds at the gym. She goes three times a week, and sheâs found it helps her stay on course to do all the things she needs to do.\n\nââMy friends tell me, âAww, girl. Youâve just got energy.â I say, no you just have to keep to going. If you stop, your energy stops,â she said. âThis was my year. I turned 75 on Jan. 25, and Iâm so blessed that God has allowed me to be here.â\n\nMarch 29 â Tomeka Walker\n\nTomeka Walker was 22 weeks pregnant when she gave birth to her son, Khairi, in 2014. He lived for 2.5 hours before he died at the hospital.\n\nThe premature birth was unexpected, and Khairiâs death was heartbreaking, especially since Walker said she did not have any problems during pregnancy. Khairi passed on a Monday and one day later, Walker had to call funeral homes and cemeteries to get pricing for his burial.\n\nWalker was not prepared for what she learned. Some places wanted to charge $5,000 and up to cover a casket, the opening and closing for the grave, etc. Another place wanted $2,500. The grief. The costs. The shock. It was enough to push one over the edge. She was at a loss.\n\nBut Walker persevered and found a plan that fit her budget. As she worked on the paperwork, she wondered how many other women experienced what she had and how many of them faced financial hardships in burying a baby.\n\nTo help others, Walker started the Khairi and Little Angelsâ Memorial in 2014.\n\nFor low-income women whoâve lost babies from 20 weeksâ gestation to 12 months of age, and they are unable to pay for a burial, Walkerâs organization can assist with expenses at two funeral homes and one cemetery they have partnered with in this effort. Coverage costs vary. They donât do cover funeral services. And depending on costs, they usually donât pay for headstones.\n\nWalker said they have paid for 20 burials since 2017, and they use fundraising and donations to help pay for the burials.\n\nWhen Walker was looking for a plot for Khairi, cemeteries had plots for adults. She was told her the same price for an adult grave would be the same price for a baby. However, at the cemetery the organization partners with, there is a âBabyland,â where the plots are smaller and not as expensive. Walker helped establish it. Mothers submit applications to the organization to be considered for coverage.\n\nâI feel like, to a lot of families, Iâm a blessing. Iâve had a lot of them come back to me and tell me they donât know what they would have done if they had not found me,â Walker said. âI know God called me to do this, and I know, each time that I do it, I feel like my heart is smiling because I know Khairi is smiling.â\n\nThe organization also helps make women more aware of their bodies when they are pregnant; aware of their health and life insurance coverage when it comes to time in the hospital and the untimely passing of a child; encourage them to be strong advocates for their health when dealing with doctors; and to be aware of the organizationâs maternal mental health resources. Starting in April 2024, they will offer childbirth education classes. In September 2024, they will host a mental health expo at the A.G. Boys and Girls Club. They include other events on their website, www.klamemorial.org.\n\nâI want to be able to help families and women not endure the heartache that I did,â said Walker, who has written two books that include stories from women whoâve lost their babies during or after childbirth. âI will have flashbacks, periodically, of trying to navigate through the burials and calling around to get prices. And I donât want families to experience that.â\n\nâIf anyone wants to join us, they can sign up as a volunteer, they can call me, or they sign up online.â\n\nTo contact Walker, email info@klamemorial.org.\n\nMarch 29 â Irina Pritchett\n\nFor the last two years, Irina Pritchett has volunteered as a mentor with the non-profit group Momentum to help women at different stages in their careers.\n\nPritchett has helped mentees stand out in their resumes, improve interview skills and sharpen their ability to maneuver the workplace. For one mentee interviewing for a job, Pritchett stressed to her the importance of having confidence and being an advocate for oneself.\n\nâShe did get the job, and since then, her career is huge. Itâs exploding,â Pritchett said.\n\nPritchett, 38, had mentors in college, grad school and when she switched from working at a college in a Ph.D. program to the banking industry, which is why she said it is important to volunteer through Momentum. The non-profit Birmingham organization offers different programs to elevate women, addressing everything from executive leadership to women just getting started in a career.\n\nâWith Momentum, I really love to give a platform to a program that is this awesome,â said Pritchett, who has a doctorate in economics and works in downtown Birmingham at Regions bank. âThey are so deliberate on how they connect people.â\n\nShe is also a board member of Central Six AlabamaWorks, a workforce development council that forms industry and educational partnerships to create sustainable career paths for those already working and for once-employed individuals get back to work. It serves Jefferson, Blount, Chilton, Shelby, St. Clair and Walker counties.\n\nIn mid-October 2024, the council will bring the Worlds of Work exhibit to the Birmingham CrossPlex to give area eighth graders hands-on experience of what jobs are like in different professions. She plans to volunteer at the event.\n\nâIf you are doing something that is important to you, if you are following your passion, I think there is some element of ease to it because it gives back to you as much as you give in to it,â she said.\n\nPritchett, who was 4 years old when her family immigrated from Belarus to America as political refugees, was able to help again when a bank co-worker sponsored a family of five, who had fled the war in the Ukraine in late 2022. The community and bank co-workers came together to help the family settle into the area. Pritchett and a different bank co-worker served as interpreters and pitched in with her other co-workers to help the family, who opened a local bridal shop in 2023.\n\nFor Pritchett, empowerment isnât just a goal; itâs also the anchor of community strength.\n\nâThis city is filled with amazing humans, including amazing women, and anything that helps empower us to be ourselves in this community with authenticity â¦ it contributes to the strength of the city,â Pritchett said.\n\nFor more information on Momentum, visit momentumleaders.org. For more information on Central Six AlabamaWorks, visit centralsix.org.\n\nMarch 30 â Dora Sims\n\nWith her keen sense of leadership and boundless energy, Dora Sims has helped implement initiatives aimed at enhancing the quality of life for residents in the Five Points community.\n\nEvery month for a year in 2022, the community hosted neighborhood cleanups to reduce crime. They also created a newsletter to keep residents and schools in the district informed about happenings in their area. Community members liked the impact of their efforts and decided\n\nto share the results with a larger audience.\n\nSo, in 2023, Sims joined others to present their concept and case study during the Neighborhoods USA (NUSA) conference in El Paso, Texas. The Five Points community, which includes Belview Heights, Bush Hills, Central Park, Ensley Highlands, Fairview and Green Acres neighborhoods, won second place in the âMulti-Neighborhood Categoryâ at NUSA. Sims was excited about the win and returned to Birmingham with even bigger goals: improving community development, education, economic development and the environment.\n\nâI do this because itâs important to be engaged in your neighborhood and where you live,â said Sims, who is a past president of the Five Points community and is the current vice president of the Bush Hills neighborhood. âWhen we give back and encourage others to give back, we create a safe place to live and raise our families.â\n\nSims is also a member of the Bush Hills Connection Education Committee. Each year, she joins committee members at Birminghamâs Bush Hills STEAM Academy to welcome back students on the first day of school. Her community is where her heart is, which is why she visits the school, listens attentively to the concerns of her neighbors, amplifies residentsâ voices and works to find solutions that benefit everyone.\n\nRecognizing the importance of economic vitality in the area, Sims has taken on the challenge of helping to revamp the vision and mission of the Five Points West CrossPlex Business Alliance. With her strategic vision and approach, she wants to network with businesses in the Five Points West corridor and connect them with resources and more people in the community. She also wants to establish a board, which will re-examine the allianceâs by-laws.\n\nâAs a resident and neighbor, I am concerned about where I live. I want to be able to help create this place where we can enjoy the quality of life without having to leave and find that elsewhere,â Sims said. âI feel like Iâm on a good path right now. Working with the businesses will help strengthen our neighborhood community and pull everything together.â\n\nMarch 30 â Dr. Nancy Tofil\n\nDr. Nancy Tofil wears many hats at Childrenâs of Alabama.\n\nShe is a professor of pediatrics, the director of the Division of Pediatric Critical Care and the senior associate program director for the hospitalâs Pediatric Residency Program. These areas see patients anywhere from 3 or 4 days old up to 26 years old with brain tumors, Covid, pneumonia, burns, gunshot wounds, kidney and liver transplants and scoliosis surgery.\n\nAnother responsibility she holds is serving as the founder and medical director of the hospitalâs Simulation Center and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, where medical students, nurses, fellows, faculty and more gain hands-on experience to increase their knowledge, hone their skills and practice teamwork in real-life patient scenarios.\n\nWhatâs a simulator? Think Annie the CPR mannequin from your high school days. It was static and lifeless as you practiced your CPR moves back in the day. The old simulator medical students had was sort of like that. It lacked the ability to breathe or give a pulse like a real person would. If students needed to experience what it was like for the old simulator to breathe, for example, Dr. Tofil would have to tell them the simulator was breathing.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Tofil heard there was a new and improved simulator available. And in 2007, the hospital secured a high-fidelity, high-realism simulator that functions just a like a human.\n\nWith the new simulator, Dr. Tofil opened the Simulation Center in 2008. Today, the center has 12 computer-controlled simulators of all sizes, from a preemie to a teenager. They breathe. They have a pulse. They can talk. Some have eyes that open and close. The simulators also have monitors that allow students to administer medicine, and the simulator will react to the medicine. Students can also practice procedures.\n\nâI work in ICU eight weeks a year, and then the rest of the year is spent working in the Simulation Center, teaching people, solving problems and watching residents grow,â said Dr. Tofil, 51. âItâs exciting and different.â\n\nUnder Dr. Tofilâs guidance, the Simulation Center has become one of the most active pediatric simulation centers in the country. With each training session, students gain invaluable experience that translates directly to better patient care for children throughout the state. Since opening, the center has seen 94,000 learners.\n\nIn October 2023, Dr. Tofil received the Wallace Alexander Clyde Distinguished Service Award for Excellence in Pediatrics from the Alabama chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics for her work with the center.\n\nThrough Dr. Tofilâs dedication and vision, she continues to shape the future of healthcare, one simulator at a time.\n\nMarch 31 â Angela Scott Abdur-Rasheed\n\nAngela Scott Abdur-Rasheed is using the power of her pen to get Birmingham businesses and non-profit organizations noticed beyond the borders of the Magic City.\n\nShe does it as director of communications and community engagement for Prosper, a non-profit organization that offers small businesses and nonprofit groups access to capital, resources and technical assistance to help build their business and Birmingham in lasting and inclusive ways. The group also does workforce development for high school students and training for small businesses.\n\nAbdur-Rasheedâs profiles delve into the heart of what makes each company or organization unique, sharing their journey, their struggles and how they are making a difference in Birmingham.\n\nâI write features on a lot of the people that participate in the programs we fund, or they have received funding from us so they can be shown and known to an audience broader than their customer base,â said the Birmingham native, who is 52, married and has two stepchildren.\n\nThrough her storytelling, Birminghamâs hidden gems come to life and highlight the cityâs entrepreneurial spirit. There are victories, where dreams are realized, and obstacles are overcome. There are defeats, where setbacks and challenges test even the most determined. And then, there are rebounds, moments of resilience a business owner musters up to fight another day, refusing to be deterred.\n\nOne of Abdur-Rasheedâs business profiles caught the attention of the Scripps News network. It was Naughty But Nice Kettle Corn Co., a Woodlawn-based, female-run business that has participated in different cohorts offered by Prosper. Scripps News sent an Atlanta camera crew to Birmingham to interview Naughty But Nice founder and CEO Tanesha Sims-Summers in November 2023. Another crew from Florida did a Zoom interview with her.\n\nNaughty But Nice âhas received an influx of national business; people who ordinarily would not have known about them,â Abdur-Rasheed said, adding that the story did not run in Birmingham because the city does not have a Scripps News Network station here. âThat can be transformative for that business.â\n\nAbdur-Rasheed, who is the author of seven books, has also used her storytelling talents for when Prosper and organizations from Birmingham visit cities for big conferences and events. Prosper and its partners have started to see additional results from such exposure.\n\nâIf we donât know our story, tell it and have a vehicle to reach the right ears, we could be missing out on just that next thing to elevate us as a city, community or individual,â she said.\n\nThis year will mark the third anniversary for Prosper, and to celebrate, organizers will host a community-centered event on Thursday, June 13. It will start at 4 p.m. with an annual report of reflections of 2023 and projections for 2024. Then, it will close with a Prosper birthday celebration from 5:30 to 7 p.m.\n\nPeople must pre-register to attend at https://prosperannualmeeting.swell.gives/\n\nâThis will not be like your traditional annual meeting where itâs just the board of directors, staff or stakeholders,â said Abdur-Rasheed, who added that the event is for everyone, including CEOs, entrepreneurs, neighborhood leaders and residents.\n\nAnother upcoming Propser event will be the Letâs Connect Luncheon for Faith, Neighborhood and Civic Leaders on Thursday, April 25. To attend, email Abdur-Rasheed at arasheed@prosperbham.com. For more info on Prosper, visit www.prosperbham.com.\n\nEvents like these emphasize how storytelling can unite communities, celebrate achievements and amplify voices that may otherwise go unheard. As Birmingham continues to evolve, Abdur-Rasheed remains dedicated to showcasing stories that reflect the richness and diversity of the city and its residents.\n\nMarch 31 â Dr. Erica Stringer-Reasor\n\nWhen Dr. Erica Stringer-Reasor enrolled in medical school, she had visions of becoming an eye surgeon.\n\nGrowing up and seeing her grandmother diagnosed with glaucoma left Dr. Stringer-Reasor wanting to find a way to impact sight for people. But by the time Dr. Stringer-Reasor started medical school at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, a classmate and student mentor would eventually change her whole plan.\n\nThe classmate, Regan Robinson Young, was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in her 20s, which was a total surprise as colon cancer is often diagnosed in people over the age of 60. Young, who was a year ahead of Dr. Stringer-Reasor in medical school, underwent chemotherapy and surgery while continuing with school. However, Young died four months before graduation.\n\nYoungâs passing affected Dr. Stringer-Reasor and other classmates. âAfter she died, I knew right then that I wanted to do something in womenâs health â in oncology,â said Dr. Stringer-Reasor, who graduated in 2008. She would later turn her focus toward ovarian cancer and later breast ca"
