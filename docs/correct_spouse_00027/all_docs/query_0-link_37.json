        "text": "Daniel Lee Ferguson, 47 years of age, of Hillsboro, Ohio, departed his earthly home on Wednesday, July 10, 2024 at Locust Grove Faith Community Church.\n\nDaniel, better known as Dan, was born on December 5, 1976 in West Union, Ohio to the late Frank and Martha (Williams) Ferguson. Though he last resided in Hillsboro, Daniel spent most of his life on Ferguson Road in Seaman.\n\nDaniel is survived by his wife, Amber (Knauff) Ferguson; their children, Kaylee Brooke Ferguson and Brett Michael Ferguson; his brother Joseph (Kristin) Ferguson and their children Alyssa and Robie of Williamsburg; mother- and father-in-law Mike and Anita Conaway of Peebles; sister-in-law Sierra (Jordan) Scott of Tennessee; brother-in-law Jesse (Morgan) Conaway of Peebles; along with a host of uncles, aunts, cousins, coworkers and friends.\n\nIn Heaven, now resting in his arms are a son, Jacob Wyatt, and three other angel babies. Daniel’s last words were used to spread the message of salvation and the love of Jesus Christ.\n\nFamily and friends may pay their respects during visitation on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, from 5 – 8 p.m. at the Locust Grove Faith Community Church in Peebles, Ohio.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Wednesday, July 16, 2024, beginning at 11 a.m., at the Locust Grove Faith Community Church in Peebles. Gary Brown will officiate the service. The burial will follow at the Locust Grove Cemetery, in Peebles.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made in Dan’s memory to Gideons International.\n\nFuneral arrangements are being handled by the Wallace-Thompson Funeral Home."
