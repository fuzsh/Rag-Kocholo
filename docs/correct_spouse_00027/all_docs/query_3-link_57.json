Grandsons are just the best!” one follower excitedly commented.\n\n“Congratulations to your new addition to your family, he is gorgeous,” another fan gushed.\n\nJessie, who plays the iconic character of Kat Slater on EastEnders, shares her daughter and only child Tallulah with her ex, policeman Dave Morgan, whom she reportedly dated for a brief period in 2004.\n\nCongratulations again to Jessie and her daughter on the arrival of their adorable new baby boy — what a wonderful new adventure this will be for the both of them!"
