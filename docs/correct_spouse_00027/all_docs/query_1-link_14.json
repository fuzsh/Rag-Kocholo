        "text": "Soap star Jessie Wallace is adored for her role as Kat Slater on EastEnders. The 50-year-old actress has starred in the hit BBC One show intermittently since 2000, reprising her role in 2018 and remaining on our screens ever since.\n\nBut much like her on-screen character, Jessie has reportedly had a turbulent life filled with drama when it comes to both relationships and work. When she first made her entrance into Walford, she was dating ex-criminal Paul Whitworth but her sudden rise to fame saw the demise of their relationship, after three years.\n\nAt the time, reports claimed BBC bosses had warned Jessie about her romance. Later she met and fell for Dave Morgan, a police officer who accompanied her to court when she was facing drink-driving charges.\n\nREAD MORE: This Morning's Holly Willoughby breaks social media silence after 'queue-jumping' row\n\nThe pair now share Jessie's first and only child, Tallulah Lilac, who was born in 2004. But not long after Jessie and Dave called it quits and Jessie met catering boss Vincent Morse.\n\nThree months into the relationship, the couple announced their engagement, only to reportedly break up days before they tied the knot after the actress found text messages he had sent to his ex-partner. She found love again with musician Tim Arnold, who she shared a four-year relationship with, and then Paul Kempin for a two-year stint.\n\nNow, the EastEnders legend is linked to carpenter Justin Gallwey who are said to have known each other since they were teenagers and Justin has described their relationship as 'very close'. He event hinted at his plans to propose last month, commenting on a photo of Jessie and her friend Jaime Winstone modelling matching costume jewellery on the set of a special flashback episode of EastEnders.\n\nJessie's beau wrote: \"See I told you you would have a ring on that finger by the end of the year.\" According to The Sun, Justin has been helping the EastEnders actress, 50, battle her booze demons after she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer in June.\n\nIt's not the first time she's found herself in hot water either with EastEnders bosses previously placing the star under a two-month suspension after she reportedly appeared drunk on set.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
