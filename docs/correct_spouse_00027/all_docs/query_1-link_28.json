        "text": "For those who can't get onto the NOTW site here's the article and links to the pics :rolleyes:\n\nJessie's fiance is a burger van man... and he's already got his hands on her buns\n\nEnder the mystery as find out Kat's secret lover\n\nTHE identity of Jessie Wallace's mystery fianc√© is revealed today by the News of the World... he's a 50-year-old burger van man called Vince. The actress, who plays EastEnders' gobby landlady Kat Moon, met Vincent Morse on set when he provided the catering.Jessie, who is 40 in September, has been dating him since last summer and he popped the question last month. She has kept his identity secret even from family and Albert Square co-stars.\n\nLast night as she arrived without him at the British Soap Awards Jessie flashed her engagement ring and said: \"He's the love of my life, I've never been this happy with a man before. He's absolutely wonderful.\"When asked what his secret was, she blushed: \"I'm not telling you, that's for me to know.\" Our exclusive pictures show the couple in a passionate embrace this week as she left his house in Claygate, Surrey. An onlooker told us: \"It was obvious how in love they are. They just couldn't keep their hands off each other and didn't care if anyone was watching. \"He was still in his dressing gown and was feeling so cheeky that he went in for a good old feel of her butt even though they'd just spent the night together. \"Jessie is looking incredible at the moment so it's no wonder he can't keep his hands off. \"But it was very cute to see a couple who are so clearly besotted with each other.\"According to friends the couple's relationship intensified at Christmas and Vince popped the question last month. Vince has more than 20 years experience in the food business and now runs The Catering Company which specialises in feeding actors and crew members on TV and movie sets. The company's website features pictures of Vincent dressed in his chef whites.\n\nJessie is famous for a string of doomed romances, often with bad boys - including a killer and an ex gangster. She was previously engaged to toyboy actor Tommy O'Neill and policeman Dave Morgan, father of her six-year-old daughter Tallulah. Our source added: \"As far as Jessie is concerned this is it now. Her wild days are behind her. She feels a connection with Vincent like no one else. \"Jessie's had some really high profile relationships which just haven't worked out, so she's wanted to take the time to make sure that this was something she knew would work. \"She didn't want to jinx things but she's not too worried about people finding out now because, after all, he is her future husband. But she's determined not to turn their relationship into a publicity stunt. She wants to keep it private.\" The source added: \"In a way it's a shame for her that she didn't meet him ten years ago because she would have loved to have had a family with him.\" Jessie has said of her looming landmark birthday: \"I don't feel 40 and I don't act it, but I might have left it a bit too late to have more children now.\" Jessie underwent a massive physical transformation before meeting Vincent. The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant lost two stones and became obsessed with exercise in a complete overhaul of her party lifestyle.\n\nOther men in her love life\n\nJESSIE'S notoriously troubled love life began at 17 when she had a six-month affair with double killer David Parris. When Parris, who killed a man with his bare hands when he was 15 and later strangled his wife, ended the affair she took revenge by bedding his younger brother Steve. By the time she joined Albert Square in 2000 Jessie was in a long-term relationship with millionaire Paul Whitworth, who was pals with gangland boss Reggie Kray and once stood trial for armed robbery. She also had a brief fling with former EastEnders co-star Billy Murray.\n\nhttp://s1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/claireclark_7/Shane%20and%20Jessie%20Pics/?action=view&current=jessie_2_300_258765a.jpg\n\nhttp://s1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/claireclark_7/Shane%20and%20Jessie%20Pics/?action=view&current=jessie_2_619_258759a.jpg\n\nhttp://s1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/claireclark_7/Shane%20and%20Jessie%20Pics/?action=view&current=jessie_619_258754a.jpg\n\n0"
