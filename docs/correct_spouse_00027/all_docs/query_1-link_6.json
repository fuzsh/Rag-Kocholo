        "text": "Jessie Wallace is reportedly engaged to her boyfriend after more than a year together.\n\nThe EastEnders star, 51, is said to be ready to walk down the aisle with carpenter Justin Gallwey, 50.\n\nThe actress was seen wearing a gold band on her ring finger when she nipped into a petrol station near her North London home to buy a bottle of wine in a photo obtained by The Sun.\n\nJessie and Justin are thought to have known one another since they were teenagers.\n\nHandyman Justin is apparently seen as a stabilising influence in Jessie’s life, reportedly helping her battle her demons following her arrest for allegedly assaulting a police officer and drunk and disorderly conduct outside a Suffolk nightclub last June.\n\nShe was released without charge after receiving a caution.\n\nThe couple were photographed for the first time together shortly after the alleged incident.\n\nHe told The Sun on Sunday at the time: ‘I just want to protect her. Everything is happy and things are good.’\n\nThe star later expressed her ‘deep regret’ over the scene, with a BBC spokesperson telling Metro.co.uk: ‘Senior bosses have spoken to Jessie Wallace about the incident and issued a clear warning that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and Jessie has expressed her deep regret.’\n\nJustin is said to keep a Jessie doll from Toy Story in his van, and a source told the publication of this new development: ‘Jessie has been proudly wearing the ring.’\n\nHinting at possible future plans, she also shared a picture of them with their arms wrapped around one another in a pub last year captioning it ‘My hubby’.\n\nJessie, who has played Kat Slater in the BBC One soap on and off since 2000, was previously engaged to Vincent Morse, with the pair set to tie the knot in 2011 before the wedding was called off at the last minute.\n\nShe shares daughter Tallulah, 18, with former policeman partner Dave Morgan.\n\nThe couple split shortly after her birth.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Jessie Wallace for comment.\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Lily Slater makes a huge decision after dad Ryan Malloy’s explosive return\n\nMORE : Who did You star Tilly Keeper play in EastEnders?\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage."
