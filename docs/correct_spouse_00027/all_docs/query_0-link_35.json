        "text": "Jessie Wallace (born Karen Jane Wallace; 25 September 1971) is an English actress. She is best known for her role of Kat Slater in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n3 Personal life\n\n4 Awards and nominations\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nEarly life[edit][]\n\nWallace was born at 204 Durants Road, Enfield, North London,[1] to James, a telecommunications engineer, and Annette, a secretary.[2] Her parents divorced when she was aged three and she and her sister were raised by their father (however, she did see her mother at weekends).[2] She adopted her stage name after her late grandmother.[3]\n\nCareer[edit][]\n\nAfter schooling, Wallace trained as a make-up artist at the College of North East London in Tottenham and worked at the Royal Shakespeare Company for two years. She met and became friends with actor Iain Glen, who helped her apply for London drama college The Poor School, from where she graduated in 1999. While undertaking auditions - including for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard, she worked as a real lifebarmaid at her local pub, The Royal Oak in Loughton, Essex.[4]\n\nHer first television appearance was in an episode of the ITV police drama series The Bill in 1999. Wallace is best known for playing the role of Kat Slater in BBC One soap opera EastEnders between 2000 and 2005.[5] In Summer 2008, Wallace said she hadn't ruled out a return to EastEnders. In February 2010 it was announced that Shane Richie was returning to play Alfie Moon, leading to large amounts of speculation as to whether Wallace would also be returning. On 9 February 2010, the BBC confirmed that Jessie would be returning to EastEnders, reprising her role as Kat Slater. She and Alfie returned to screens in the Autumn of 2010.[6]\n\nDuring her break from EastEnders, Wallace made television guest appearances, including once as Kat Slater, in the 2005 French & Saunders Christmas special. On 17 February 2006, Wallace was the \"guest host\" of an edition of the Channel 4 programme The Friday Night Project. She appeared in the one-off BBC One television dramas A Class Apart opposite Nathaniel Parker, The Dinner Party with Lee Evans and Alison Steadman. After visiting Hat Trick Productions with her agent, and singing an impromptu version of Marie Lloyd's song The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery, she was offered the lead role in Miss Marie Lloyd – Queen of The Music Hall for BBC Four.[7]\n\nWallace made her West End theatre debut, replacing Denise van Outen in the role of \"Maureen\" in Rent remixed at the Duke of York's Theatre from 27 December 2007 until 2 February 2008.[8] Wallace played Amy Kriel in the third series of ITV's Wild at Heart, and starred in a run of the play Haunted at the Arts Theatre from 24 May.[9][10]\n\nWallace competed with partner Darren Bennett in the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began on 20 September 2008. She was eliminated in week 4.[11]\n\nWallace toured the UK in the 25th Anniversary production of Stepping Out by Richard Harris, playing the role of Sylvia.[12]\n\nWallace appeared as British sex symbol of the 1960s and 70s Pat Phoenix, in The Road to Coronation Street, a one-off documentary exploring the origins and conception of Coronation Street, to mark the show's 50th anniversary in December 2010.[13]\n\nWallace is a patron of the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.[14]\n\nPersonal life[edit][]\n\nAfter coming to fame in EastEnders, her personal life became the focus of many tabloid newspapers. She entered the soap cast in the later stages of a three-year relationship with Majorca based ex-criminal, Paul Whitworth. After being warned by BBC executives, she split with Whitworth, and had a holiday romance with 25 year-old American, Andy Burton, who immediately sold his story.[4]\n\nWallace was once suspended from EastEnders by the BBC for excess drinking, partying, and adverse publicity; she returned to the soap, but was then stopped by police and arrested for driving being one and half times over the limit. The BBC offered her counselling and while attending County Court for sentencing, she was accompanied by policeman, Dave Morgan, in case she was accosted by fans. The couple started dating, and then moved in together after Wallace confirmed she was pregnant. Wallace gave birth to daughter Tallulah Lilac on 2 November 2004, but the couple split up shortly afterwards, with Wallace's lawyers placing a gag order on Morgan.[15]\n\nIn a later tabloid story in late 2007, whilst Wallace was filming Wild at Heart in Johannesburg with her cousin Jonathan and daughter Tallulah, her best friend, Stefan, suggested she still regularly took ketamine,[16]Wallace admitted, at one point, taking drugs, but denied taking them since the birth of her daughter.[17]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit][]"
