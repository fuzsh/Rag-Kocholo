Not seen a real life policeman for years,” he went on.\n\n“Gang continues… what happens next?”\n\nSharing the post with her own 70,000 Twitter followers, Jessie said: “This happened last year in Muswell Hill to my daughter.\n\n“I call the police at 8pm and they knock on my door at 3am,” she recalled. “Nothing was ever resolved.”\n\nWhen asked for comment by Express.co.uk, the Metropolitan Police said they could not comment without more details about when and where the crime took place.\n\nJessie's daughter's father, Dave Morgan, worked as a policeman when they were together.\n\nThe couple first got together in 2003 but called off their engagement and split before their daughter was born.\n\nJessie is currently dating greengrocer Paul Krepin, 40, after they were first romantically linked in October.\n\nLast month, the pair made a rare public appearance when they stepped out together for the press night of Everybody’s Talking About Jamie in London.\n\nThe mother-of-one looked in high spirits as she accompanied her beau to the show, which stars EastEnders favourite Shane Richie, 55.\n\nJessie first shot to fame playing Kat in EastEnders, joining the cast in 2000.\n\nShe appeared on the soap until 2005 and later returning in 2010.\n\nFollowing six more years on the show, she departed once again in 2016 but made her dramatic comeback to Walford last year.\n\nHer time as Kat has earned the actress numerous awards, including Most Popular Newcomer at the National Television Awards in 2001 and the British Soap Award for Best Actress in 2011.\n\nIn addition to her role on EastEnders, Jessie has also appeared in the likes of Wild at Heart and The Bill.\n\nEastEnders continues tonight at 8pm on BBC One."
