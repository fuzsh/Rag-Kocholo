        "text": "JESSIE Wallace will go into 2020 as a single woman after splitting from her partner.\n\nThe EastEnders star, 48, spent Christmas with pals having ended her relationship with Paul Keepin after almost two years.\n\nThe Sun reported last year that greengrocer Paul, 41, had walked out on his wife of 20 years, Teresa, and their five children in December 2017 with no explanation.\n\nHis family were then left shocked two months later when he was pictured with Kat Slater actress Jessie.\n\nBut the couple have now split with a source saying: “Jessie and Paul recently ended things and have cut contact with each other.\n\n“She is moving on and wants the New Year to be a fresh start when she will focus on work.\n\n“After a quiet Christmas with her daughter and her closest friends, she is knuckling down for 2020.”\n\nHer spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe break-up marks the latest in a string of failed romances for Jessie.\n\nHer four-year relationship with singer Tim Arnold, 44, ended in 2016.\n\nAnd five years earlier, she dramatically called off her planned wedding to catering boss Vincent Morse at the last minute.\n\nHe confessed to sending an explicit picture of Jessie to his ex — with former fiancee Karen Short saying he had doubts over the relationship.\n\nJessie, who has a daughter, Tallulah, 15, with her policeman ex Dave Morgan, will celebrate 20 years since she joined EastEnders in 2020."
