Everything is happy and things are good.”\n\nUnlucky in love Jessie has had a string of high-profile boyfriends over the years but never married.\n\nIn 2011 she was set to tie the knot to Vincent Morse in a £300,000 star-studded ceremony but it was called off at the last minute.\n\nJessie has one daughter, Tallulah Lilac Morgan, with her ex, Dave Morgan.\n\nThe pair dated in 2004 and Jessie gave birth to Tallulah on November 2 of the same year.\n\nHowever, Dave and Jessie split up soon after her birth.\n\nLast year Tallulah gave birth, making Jessie a grandmother for the first time.\n\nThe actress shared the snap of the newborn tot to Instagram.\n\nShe accompanied the picture of the baby with an announcement that her first grandchild was here.\n\nJessie wrote: “Welcome to the world, my grandson SJ.\n\n“You are loved, cherished and adored.”\n\nRead more: Who is leaving EastEnders this year?\n\nHowever, fans and co-stars rushed to congratulate her.\n\nLacey Turner, who plays on-screen cousin Stacey Slater, wrote: “Beautiful boy,” followed by a heart-shaped emoji.\n\nSuki Panesar actress Balvinder Sopal said: “Congratulations.”\n\nWant more spoilers from EastEnders?
