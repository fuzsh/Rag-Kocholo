        "text": "EASTENDERS actress Jessie Wallace has split from singer boyfriend Tim Arnold after almost four years, he has revealed.\n\nThe award-winning telly star, 44, who plays Kat Moon in the BBC One soap, started dating Tim, 40, after\n\nmeeting at a television awards ceremony in 2012.\n\nTim – whose stage name is The Soho Hobo – is the godson of Walford veteran June Brown , who plays Dot Cotton.\n\nHis mum, Polly Perkins, played Dot’s sister Rose on EastEnders.\n\nTim, who was in a 90s Britpop band called Jocasta, has now admitted he and Jessie, who has had a chequered romantic history, have not been a couple for “a long time”.\n\nAnd he says he wants to distance himself from the limelight.\n\nHe said: “People just want to know about the celebrities you know or have been with. I am tired of it.”\n\nThe break-up comes after Tim unsuccessfully auditioned for BBC talent series The Voice last year without telling Jessie.\n\nAt the time he said: “I didn’t tell any of my nearest and dearest. I went on my own.\n\n“I want people to judge me on my music and not the famous people in my life. It’s about doing it on my own merit.”\n\nIn August 2011, Jessie called off her £300,000 wedding to catering boss Vince Morse on the big day itself.\n\nShe had found out the night before that he had sent explicit pictures of her to his ex-girlfriend Karen Short.\n\nDevastated, she fled to Crete on what should have been her honeymoon, to escape the embarrassment.\n\nShe took a six-month break from EastEnders, during which Vince went on ITV1’s This Morning to make a grovelling public apology in a doomed bid to win her back.\n\nWhen Tim started dating Jessie a year later he pledged his loyalty to her, saying: “I knew about the terrible experience she’d had. I took it on board to make sure that I would be different.\n\n“I always took it as a responsibility to be both supportive and protective of Jessie. And I have done that.”\n\nJessie has won a string of awards for her role in EastEnders from Best Newcomer in the 2001 British Soap Awards to Best Actress at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards.\n\nHer exes include Paul Whitworth, a friend of gang boss Reggie Kray. She has a seven-year-old daughter with policeman Dave Morgan, whom she met in 2007."
