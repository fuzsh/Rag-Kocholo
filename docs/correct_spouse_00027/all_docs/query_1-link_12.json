        "text": "EASTENDERS star Jessie Wallace's new lover is STILL married and walked out on his family just days before Christmas, The Sun Online can reveal.\n\nPaul Keepin, 40, had been with Teresa for 23 years when he suddenly announced he was leaving her and their five children last December.\n\nThe greengrocer gave no explaination to his wife for turning his back on her.\n\nShe was left reeling after discovering he was in a relationship with Walford favourite Jessie, 47, just two months later — when she saw a picture of the pair in The Sun.\n\nOn Monday we revealed how the couple were now dating. They were spotted together at the Amy Winehouse Gala at the Dorchester hotel in London earlier this month.\n\nThere is no suggestion the pair were seeing each other while Paul was still with Teresa.\n\nBut speaking exclusively to The Sun Online from her home in Rochester, in Kent, Teresa, 40, said she hit \"rock bottom\" when Paul walked out.\n\nShe said: \"We’re not actually divorced yet. He walked out on us a year ago and he never came back.\"\n\nShe went on: \"I had to move in with my dad because I couldn’t afford to live anymore and it’s just been a struggle since then.\n\n\"The first I knew about it was the story in The Sun in February when they were falling out of a club together.\n\n\"That’s the first I knew about it. It kind of broke me a little bit.\n\n\"When you spend so much time with someone, so many years, it’s really hard to see them with someone else.\"\n\nHeartbroken Teresa was forced to leave their family nest in Longfield, Kent, shortly after Paul left.\n\nHer supportive dad - who she described as her \"rock\" - took the family in when she could no longer afford to keep up the mortgage payments without Paul.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who is training to be a teaching assistant, said: \"My dad sorted me out and told me I should move in with him and it helped me with the kids.\n\n\"And he’s helping me bring them up. It’s affected them a lot.\n\n\"My 13-year-old son has struggled a lot — I think he’s angry with everything.\n\n\"He had his dad in his life one day but not the next.\n\n\"We had ups and downs.\n\n\"But one minute Paul was going to the park with the kids and we were happy and the next he just changed.\n\n\"We've not even had a conversation about it.\"\n\nThe struggling mum-of-five said she only learned of Paul's romance with TV star Jessie from reading newspaper reports.\n\nShe insists that \"if he’s happy, I’m happy\" — but admits her estranged husband's relationship has put a huge strain on her and her family.\n\nTeresa said: \"It’s had a massive impact. I’m only just getting my children into a good place now.\n\n\"Before we had a house together but Paul stopped paying the mortgage on that so we were getting lots of letters and things.\n\n\"My car had broke down a few times and I wasn’t able to get the kids to their schools.\n\n\"It was one thing on top of another and I met up with my dad and my sister and just broke down.\"\n\nTeresa moved in with her dad in Rochester in April.\n\nShe said: \"Everyone seems happier since we came here. As far as I’m aware Paul has moved in with Jessie [in north London].\n\n\"I’m 40 now. We were together since we were 17 and got married when we were 20. We met as our parents used to drink in the same pub in Gravesend.\n\n\"We were together for 23 years and then it all just came to a halt.\"\n\nTeresa said Paul - who runs fruit and veg stalls across South East London - gave her no reason for leaving.\n\n\"The only explanation is that it’s something he didn’t want anymore\", she said.\n\n\"I don’t want to come across as the bitter ex. Let them get on with it if they’re happy.\n\n\"You hit rock bottom but all you can do is do what you’re doing and try to survive.\"\n\nTeresa feels that Jessie's celebrity status has made it even tougher for her — and could have enticed Paul away from \"boring\" family life.\n\nShe said: \"Because she’s high profile it means it’s always in your face, so that’s hard.\n\n\"But it’s what he’s chose so there’s nothing I can do about that.\n\n\"He didn’t really care about celebrities... but maybe he’s enjoying that sort of lifestyle.\n\n\"Maybe it was a bit boring bringing up children — a bit mundane and day-to-day.\"\n\nThe Sun revealed the relationship this week — just four months after Jessie was sent home from the British Soap Awards for being drunk.\n\nWe told how the actress had arrived at the annual event already tipsy before hitting the bar.\n\nBut concerned bosses quickly ordered her to head home at 7pm before the main awards had even started.\n\nJessie, who was heard slurring her words, was furious at the decision.\n\nMum-of-one Jessie, who has appeared on the BBC1 soap since 2000 as gobby Kat Slater, is notoriously unlucky in love.\n\nIn August 2011 she called off her £300,000 wedding on the day of the ceremony, when she found out catering boss fiancé Vince Morse had sexted an old flame.\n\nHe told former fiancee Karen Short he had doubts over his planned marriage and even suggested they run away together.\n\nJessie started dating singer Tim Arnold a year later but the pair split in 2016 when he grew tired of the limelight.\n\nHe said: \"People just want to know about the celebrities you know or have been with. I am tired of it.\"\n\nPrior to that she was with policeman Dave Morgan, the first of her failed engagements and the father of her 13-year-old daughter Tallulah.\n\nShe met the copper when he escorted her to court for a drink-drive case. They split in 2004.\n\nJessie fell out with younger sister Danielle in 2007 when she seduced her boxer boyfriend Tommy O'Neill.\n\nThe pair got engaged but called it off after a year together.\n\nThe Sun Online has approached Jessie and Paul for a comment."
