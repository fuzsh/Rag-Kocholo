        "text": "SCORNED Jessie Wallace planned dramatic revenge on her fiance after she found out he had cruelly betrayed her.\n\nIn a plot-line that could have come straight from EastEnders, she was all set to dump Vince Morse at the altar in front of hundreds of guests.\n\nShe told friends she was going to walk down the aisle with him before calmly turning to the congregation and announcing: “It’s off!”\n\nBut in the end Jessie, 39, who plays Kat Moon in the TV soap, was too distraught to go through with it.\n\nInstead she cancelled the ceremony yesterday just hours before she was due to tie the knot – despite love rat Morse, 50, sending a relative as go-between to try to talk her round.\n\nThe silver-haired would-be peacemaker was sent packing after furious Jessie wagged her finger in his face and screamed: “Get the f*** away from my house!” as he fled back to his car.\n\nSources close to the star say she can never forgive Morse after he was caught sending explicit texts to an ex-lover.\n\nOne pal said last night: “Jessie was deadly serious about dumping him at the altar. She wanted to shame him the way she feels he has humiliated her.\n\n“She was determined to do it so that everyone would know exactly what she thought of him. But as it got nearer she was just too upset and decided it was better just to cancel the whole thing.”\n\nPLEADING\n\nThe friend added: “She loved Vince and feels totally betrayed by him.\n\n“He’s got off lightly, to be honest. She would have been totally within her rights to get her own back by ditching him in front of everyone. The poor girl didn’t deserve any of this. It’s so sad.”\n\nYesterday it emerged that Morse, who owns a successful film set catering company, had been pleading with Jessie to give him another chance.\n\nOne of his pals said: “He has told her he was drunk when he sent the messages after the pair had a row and is desperate to get back with her. He reckons he’s made the biggest mistake of his life.”\n\nBut Jessie remained adamant yesterday morning as she tearfully rang guests to tell them her big day was cancelled.\n\nAmong those invited to the extravagant bash at Pembroke Lodge in South West London were a number of Jessie’s Walford co-stars including Shane Richie, 47, who plays screen husband Alfie Moon.\n\nLast night she was being comforted by her publican dad James and a handful of close friends who arrived at her home near Kingston, Surrey, with bottles of wine and a tray of cup cakes.\n\nWearing white sunglasses, a dark frilly dress, jacket and heels, she refused to answer questions about the wedding bust-up.\n\nBut her agent confirmed the wedding, due to be covered by a magazine in a deal worth up to £450,000, was off.\n\nHe added: “Jessie is not in a position to comment and we would really appreciate if she could be given some space at this difficult time.”\n\nJessie was devastated after discovering that Morse allegedly sent an explicit picture of her to his former fiancee Karen Short, 47, just weeks ago. The snap showed Jessie wearing nothing but a black basque and stockings, with a message: “This is what you will get x”.\n\nAnd in a series of flirty emails, he also allegedly told Karen as recently as August 5 that he was having doubts about the relationship.\n\nBusinesswoman Karen, who was with Morse for three years before their relationship ended in 2005, also claimed she had spent the night with him at a hotel last December. She insisted: “I had no idea about Jessie. I was absolutely shocked.”\n\nShe added: “When I received the photograph of Jessie from Vince last month I felt really uncomfortable.\n\n“I rang Vince and asked him what he was playing at but he has a way of turning things around – he can be very manipulative.\n\nSEXY\n\n“It was typical Vince. He is a risk-taker and definitely has a dark side.”\n\nMorse is also alleged to have moaned to Karen earlier this month that the “last few weeks have taken their toll”.\n\nHe is said to have told her: “Have not been together all week. Got back yesterday and she went nuts. I think I’m really done with the whole thing.”\n\nAfter being reassured that she was there for him, Morse allegedly added on the email: “I know, let’s run away? X. To be honest I need a couple of days away with someone fun and sexy xxxx.\n\n“As of a week ago it’s really been off but I’m only just admitting it to myself now xxx.” In earlier messages sent in July, he admitted: “I still hate EastEnders” before adding: “Funny, even though I’m getting married in a short while, you pop up in my thoughts a lot.”\n\nA source close to Jessie said: “She is totally heartbroken. She thought she’d found the man of her dreams and this has been a massive bolt out of the blue.\n\n“She’d spent months painstakingly planning the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and was so excited about getting married.\n\n“But then came the claims on Sunday morning which completely knocked her for six. At first she thought they could weather the storm. Then she thought she would walk down the aisle – before walking out like a scene from Runaway Bride.\n\n“But when it came right down to it she simply couldn’t cope with any more drama and just wants to keep her head down and think through her next steps.”\n\nThe pal revealed that the wedding appeared to be on until the very last moment. She added: “It was a mark of how confused Jessie was and the state she was in that even her agent had got the impression it was still going ahead.”\n\nJessie was set up on a blind date with Morse through a mutual friend last December. They arranged to meet again in January and began a whirlwind romance before announcing their engagement four months ago.\n\nThe actress, who has a daughter Tallulah, six, with her ex Dave Morgan, had spent the build-up to the nuptials gushing about her love for Morse.\n\nCLOSER\n\nShe said: “Vince is my Mr Right. There’s been a huge gap in my life and I’ve had relationships but there was always something missing. If not one thing, loads of things missing.\n\n“But Vince has got everything I’ve been looking for. I knew literally straight away that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.\n\n“I do believe there’s one person out there for you and the more time we spend together the closer we become, it’s like we’re one person. I never thought I’d see the day when I got married.\n\n“I’ve never been this happy with a man before.” She added: “I’ve been in wrong relationships in the past. Vince is a real man. He looks after me, he’s so protective.”\n\nJessie even revealed how she and Vince were hoping for more children.\n\nShe said: “We’ve got a busy year but we’d like to have another child. Tallulah wants a brother or a sister.”\n\nMorse added: “It’s definitely on the cards. It’s something we’d both like.”\n\nAsked if she’d like to be pregnant on her wedding day, Jessie laughed: “Oh God, no! It would be nice to think this time next year it’s happening – that would be perfect.”\n\nJessie first joined the cast of EastEnders in 2000 and was a big hit as rebellious Kat Slater – later Kat Moon – before quitting the show in 2005. She rejoined the series, along with co-star Shane last autumn.\n\nShe has had a turbulent personal life and a number of ill-fated romances. In 2002 she split up with millionaire Paul ­Whitworth after three years.\n\nLater she met and began dating PC Dave Morgan after he escorted her to court to face a drink-driving charge. They set up home together and in November 2004 celebrated the birth of daughter Tallulah Lilac. But the relationship was stormy and the couple broke up the following year.\n\nShe briefly dated builder Chris Osborn, then toyboy Tommy O’Neil, 25, before meeting Morse at the end of last year."
