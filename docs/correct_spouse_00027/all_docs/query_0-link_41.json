        "text": "EastEnders star Jessie Wallace beamed as she posed with friends on a night out.\n\nThe soap star, 50, let her hair down after sparking rumours she had married her boyfriend Justin Gallowey, 50, in secret.\n\nIn a post on Instagram earlier this week, the actress, who plays Kat Slater, described her partner as \"My hubby\", as the pair cosied up at a London pub.\n\nCaptioning the post, Jessie said: \"My hubby @justin_gallwey,\" and added a red heart emoji. Her co-stars rushed to the comments to gush over the happy couple.\n\nEmma Barton, who plays Honey Mitchell, said: \"Gorgeous,\" with a series of heard emojis.\n\nNatalie Cassidy, who stars as Sonia Fowler in the soap, wrote: \"You look so happy.\"\n\nIn two posts shared yesterday, the soap veteran appeared to be having a great night at a bar with three friends.\n\nThe actress wears a multi-coloured, long-sleeved maxi dress and tall silver high heels, as she wraps her arm around a brunette pal, in one snap.\n\nTwo other mates laugh and smile as they stand with Jessie.\n\nThe happy group pose in front of a sophisticated bar, with champagne flutes and wine glasses hanging down from the ceiling in neat rows.\n\nJessie simply captioned the photo with love heart emojis.\n\nFriends and fans rushed to praise the picture, with one person writing: \"You all look stunning.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Always fabulous as you are.\"\n\nA third said: \"Looking good Jess.\"\n\nIn another snap, apparently taken on the same evening, the foursome make hilarious faces as they pose for a close-up selfie in the same bar.\n\nJessie captioned the sweet picture: \"Friends reunited.\"\n\nIn May, it was first reported that Jessie was dating a mysterious builder, who she booked for a job.\n\nJustin and Jessie have been friends for the last 34 years and had been together for 12 months, a source said in May.\n\nJessie was dating Majorca-based millionaire Paul Whitworth – once jailed for fraud – when she was cast in the BBC soap in 2000.\n\nThe pair split as she rose to fame and she went on to have a fling with American Andy Burton.\n\nHe later embarrassed her with kiss-and-tell revelations.\n\nJessie also dated policeman Dave Morgan and they moved in together but split shortly after their daughter Tallulah, now 17, was born.\n\nThen, the actress planned to marry catering boss Vince Morse in 2011.\n\nBut she called off their reported £300,000 wedding just hours before they were due to tie the knot after finding out he had sent explicit photos of her to his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAnd in 2016, Jessie split from musician Tim Arnold after a four-year romance.\n\nHer most recent known boyfriend was father-of-five Paul Kempin, but the pair called it a day in 2019 after two years together."
