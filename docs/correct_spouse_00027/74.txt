DAVE Morgan, the former fiance of EastEnders star Jessie Wallace, is set to take part in channel Five show The Farm, it has emerged.

Emma Noble, former wife of James Major, blonde model Emma B, and porn star Ron Jeremy are all tipped to join the show which begins tonight.

Entertainer Lionel Blair is the latest celebrity rumoured to leave city life behind for the show, which has previously featured the likes of Rebecca Loos and Paul Daniels.

The show will see ten celebrities work on a farm for up to 18 days.

Fireman Morgan is the father of Wallace's baby daughter Tallulah.

The pair's rocky relationship came to an end last month and Morgan spilled the beans about his romance with Wallace, who plays Kat Slater in the BBC1 soap, in the News of the World on Sunday.

An insider said: "This could be an opportunity to hear more of his side of the story."

The newspaper ran the story about Wallace after the actress failed in a bid to secure an emergency High Court ruling banning publication.

Lawyers acting for the soap star made a last-ditch telephone application to Mr Justice Andrew Smith last night in a bid to halt Morgan's story.

Mr Justice Smith ruled that the newspaper had every right to print the interview after he declared himself satisfied that the actress had forfeited her right to privacy.

He said she had sought out publicity for herself and claimed that much of it was "provocative".

A channel Five spokesperson refused to confirm or deny details of who was appearing in the show.

The Farm starts tonight at 10.30pm on Channel 5.
