Eastenders actress Jessie Wallace is to marry her police officer boyfriend, her agent said yesterday.

The 31-year-old star, who plays tarty Kat Slater in the BBC soap, has been shopping for engagement rings with PC Dave Morgan.

The couple met in April this year, when Wallace was facing a drink-driving charge.

PC Morgan, 28, was responsible for shielding Wallace from the barrage of waiting photographers outside Chelmsford Magistrates' Court.

Wallace's agent confirmed: "They are talking about getting engaged and have been to look at rings."

The couple were photographed emerging from a jeweller's shop in London's Hatton Garden district yesterday.

A spokeswoman for Essex Police, PC Morgan's force, said they had no problem with the relationship.

"The view of the force is that PC Morgan's private life is his private life.

"There are rules and regulations relating to officers' private dealings with convicted criminals, but this is not a situation where anything like that would apply," she said.

Wallace, from Wanstead, east London, was alleged to have been one-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit when police stopped her Mercedes in March.

The soap star, whose real name is Karen, has denied the charge and is due to appear in court again on September 5.

Kat first arrived in Albert Square in September 2000 as part of the Slater family and became an instant hit with viewers.
