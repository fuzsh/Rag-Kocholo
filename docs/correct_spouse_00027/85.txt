EastEnders actress Jessie Wallace has dumped fiance Dave Morgan, because he tried to sell a story about their relationship to a magazine.

Jessie has apparently thrown Dave, who was secretly involved in a Â£20,000 deal with the magazine, out of their home.

A friend told The Mirror, "This was the final straw in what's been a turbulent relationship. Jessie guards her privacy jealously.

"She's had suspicions about people close to her selling stories before, and told Dave she considered it a breach of confidence. He was about to sign up for a positive glossy mag piece about their happy family life and wedding plans.

"But when she found out she was fuming. He went on the defensive and said if that he had wanted to stitch her up he had plenty of opportunities before now. Understandably that didn't go down well.

"Jessie kicked him out and told him that it was over for good this time."

The actress confirmed that she had split from Morgan, who is the father of her daughter Tallulah, in a statement yesterday.
