Jessie Wallace's character, Kat Slater, is set to leave EastEnders on November 5 after her marriage collapses.

Jessie is re-assessing her priorities in the light of recent problems with high blood pressure and the baby she is carrying, and although her short-term plan is to take a year off, the situation may be more final. Caring for the baby may well become her top priority.

Her partner, Dave Morgan, told Closer magazine: "I'm not sure if Jessie will go back or not. We are so excited and can't wait to have the baby. We're happier than we've ever been."
