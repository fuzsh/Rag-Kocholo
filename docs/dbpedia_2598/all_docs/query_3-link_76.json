        "text": "Background\n\nMalcolm James McCormick, known professionally as Mac Miller, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 19, 1992. His father was an architect, while his mother was a photographer. He was raised in Pittsburgh. As a Jew, he had a Bar Mitzvah. Miller later attended the Winchester Thurston School and Taylor Allderdice High School.\n\nMiller showed interest in music and sports while in high school. He always actively took part in sports and social activities. He taught himself to play different musical instruments like the guitar, piano, and drums. Although he wanted to be a singer as a teenager, he later started rapping at 14 after deciding to be a hip-hop artist.\n\nWhile still in school, and going by the name “Easy Mac,” he released a mixtape called “But My Mackin’ Ain’t Easy” in 2007. As part of a rap group called The Ill Spoken, Miller released another mixtape titled “How High” in 2008. He further dropped two mixtapes, “The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown” and “The High Life.” In 2010, at just 17, Miller was signed to Rostrum Records, which was based in Pittsburgh. In late 2010, Miller had a significant career breakthrough with his first tour, which was sold out and was very successful. Miller released his debut album, “Blue Slide Park” in November 2011. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold 144,000 copies in its first week.\n\nIn 2013, he released his sophomore album, “Watching Movies with the Sound Off.” He also launched his record label that year. After his contract with Rostrum Records ended in 2014, he secured a recording contract and distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records worth $10 million. He released two more albums, “GO:OD AM” and “The Divine Feminine,” in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Miller’s fifth and final album before his death, “Swimming,” was released in August 2018 to critical acclaim. The album posthumously earned him a Grammy Award nomination for ‘Best Rap Album’ in 2019.\n\nMiller struggled with substance abuse. He revealed that he usually took different harmful drug combinations to manage stress. His issues with drug abuse and addiction were a constant theme in his music. He also spoke openly about it. Miller started dating pop singer Ariana Grande — with whom he had been friends for years — in 2016. The relationship ended amicably in May 2018. Miller died in September 2018 of an accidental drug overdose at his home in Los Angeles."
