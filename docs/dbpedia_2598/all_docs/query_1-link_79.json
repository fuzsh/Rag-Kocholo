        "text": "The new project will be released on August 9th\n\nSugarland, featuring Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, has teased a new EP is coming on August 9th called There Goes The Neighborhood. The project features four songs with a runtime of 13 minutes and will be released via Big Machine Label Group. It marks the first new solo music from the duo since their 2018 album, Bigger.\n\nIt’s unclear if the music stems from a previous recording session which has yet to be released. Bush told us he produced new Sugarland music in late 2019, but the label shelved the project when the pandemic hit and they canceled their tour.\n\n“I thought it was going to come in September, but now they’ve decided to push pause on that,” he told us in September 2020.\n\nEarlier this year, the Nettles and Bush teamed with Little Big Town for a cover of the Phil Collins hit “Take Me Home” and will embark on a joint North American tour of the same name this fall with The Castellows. The Take Me Home trek hits 18 cities starting on October 24th in Greenville, South Carolina before it wraps on December 13th in Nashville.\n\nSince the band’s inception in 2002, Sugarland has sold nearly ten million albums domestically, achieving high-mark sales with platinum-certified The Incredible Machine, two-time platinum Love on the Inside, and three-time platinum Twice the Speed of Life as well as Enjoy the Ride. Their most popular songs include platinum-certified “All I Want to Do” and “Stay,” two-time platinum “Stuck Like Glue” as well as gold-certified “Baby Girl,” “It Happens,” “Settlin’,” “Something More” and “Want To.” Sugarland has also earned seven No. 1 singles and amassed over 600 million on-demand streams. Their critical and mainstream appeal has been magnified with industry accolades – five consecutive CMA Awards for Vocal Duo of the Year (2007-2011), five ACM Awards (including Song of the Year and Single of the Year), and Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Country Song for “Stay.”"
