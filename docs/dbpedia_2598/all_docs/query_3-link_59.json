        "text": "The Bentonville Film Festival is an annual Festival and globally-recognized platform amplifying female, non-binary, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and people with disabilities’ voices in entertainment. The week-long Festival, as presented by the Bentonville Film Foundation in partnership with founding sponsor Walmart and presenting sponsor Coca-Cola, is known for its dedication to championing marginalized and underrepresented voices in film with 71 percent of the competition titles directed by women. This year Festival attendees enjoyed a 30th anniversary screening of Thelma & Louise at the 112 Drive-In in Fayetteville, Arkansas, as followed by an exclusive conversation with Geena Davis (the film’s Academy Award-winning star who is also a Festival Chair) and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Callie Khouri. The Bentonville Film Festival’s 2020 festival — which was held virtually — reportedly had more than 30,000 virtual attendees, showing the demand for BFF, no matter how it is presented.\n\nAnother interesting development as part of this year’s Bentonville Film Festival is that writer, actress, director and producer Stephanie Sanditz will be screening her award-winning television pilot The High Life at BFF. The show is a half-hour dramedy about a mixed religious family dealing with the death of their beloved, wealthy aunt just as their wayward, substance abusing daughter Evie (as played by Sanditz) returns home from her career as a “celebrated” high life bar and restaurant reviewer in Chicago to collect her inheritance. The plot thickens when we discover their aunt was not the materialist square she appeared to be, as her final wishes included an incredibly unique twist on a good death. The request? For the family to take her ashes on a hike in nothing but their birthday suits to the top of a Nudist Buddhist Colony and permanently lay her to rest. Additional cast members include Amy Landecker (Transparent, Jeremy Glazer (Modern Family), Linda Purl (The Office), Ron Perkins (Spiderman and Jesse Garcia (Narcos). Based on Sanditz’s own real-life experiences, The High Life was awarded “Best Pilot” and “Best Actress” at the IMDB Independent Shorts Festival and “Best Script” and “Best Actress” at both the We Make Movies Film Festival and Independent Shorts Awards.\n\nOn August 4, 2021, I had the pleasure of speaking with Stephanie Sanditz via Zoom, as embedded below. More on Sanditz and The High Life can be found by clicking here, here and here.\n\nStephanie Sanditz feature image photo by Johnny La Vallee Photography: www.photographybyjl.com\n\nTweet"
