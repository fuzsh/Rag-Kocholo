        "text": "Inspired at a young age after seeing Michael Jackson, Bronx-born dancer Tony Draughon Wesley would dedicate his life to dance. Nicknamed “Mr. Wave” —\n\nbecause of his fluid, avant-garde dancing style — Wave would go on to be one of the most influential breakers in early hip-hop history. This documentary Wave: a True Hip Hop Story explores the life and artistryof an underappreciated creative whose style still informs the way we dance today.\n\nPut together by filmmaker Brian “B. Kyle” Atkins is not only an informative take on the late J. Dilla’s impact and creative process and legacy, the film is a touching document of a community celebrating one of its brightest lights. Throughout, Dilla’s mother Maureen Yancey, Erykah Badu, Bilal, Questlove and others reminisce on Dilla’s work ethic and wide-range of production techniques. Still Shining is a tender, revelatory look into the life of the man who “made the MPC 3000 sound like a band.\n\nThe Freshest Kids' brings to you the illest B-Boying this planet has ever witnessed. Over two hours of hardcore breaking gives you an all-access pass to the underground world of B-Boys spanning the last 25+ years. See and hear the early history via rare archival footage and exclusive interviews with The Nigga Twins, Spy (the man with 1000 moves), Rock Steady Crew icons Crazy Legs and Ken Swift, The New York City Breakers, Mr. Wiggles, Styelements and the world's most innovative B-boys of the next generation along with hip-hop legends Kool D.J. Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, KRS-One, Mos Def and many more as they come together to reveal for the first time the most comprehensive history of B-Boying, its evolution and its place within hip-hop culture and beyond. These are The Freshest Kids and this is their story!\n\nUsing rare archive footage of underground European hip hop jams of the late 80's and early 90's, with exclusive interviews with bboy pioneers from across the globe and a soundtrack of classic hip hop, rare funk and atmospheric 80's electro, 'The Bboy Mercenaries,' is a feature length documentary about how Bournemouth - based Bboy crew 'Second to None' helped keep breakin from going extinct through the exchange of VHS tapes of their seminal battles and game-changing practice footage with the pockets of survivors dotted around the world in a time before the internet.\n\nBrought to you by Raw Angles Films\n\nFrom the original idea by El Lapizito and NathaN Losado\n\nWritten, Edited & Directed by Charlie Marbles\n\nProduced by El Lapizito, Charlie Marbles and NathaN Losado\n\nInterviews by NathaN Losado and others\n\nScratch mix by Jabba tha Kutt\n\nEvo has been an inspiration to so many B-Boys, and if you've never seen him, or never seen B-Boying at its best watch this movie. In the late 1980's B-boying faded out of Britain in a haze of inglorious mediocrity. A few battle hardy teenagers kept a torch burning into the 1990's, awaiting the opportunity to shine once more. Amongst such legends as Street Machine, and alongside the mythical Storm and Swiftrock, a humble, quietly spoken B-boy emerged and so began the revolution. Evo obliterated his opponents with a mixture of style, musicality and incredible power. He won three world titles and the reputation of British B-boying was taken to a new level.\n\nThe film that director Nadja Harek proposes follows the Vagabond to conquer the title. The choreographer Mohamed Belarbi takes his dancers to the title, with always the same faith in a beautiful image of the French BBoying. We are in 2011, on the sidelines of the most important competition is turning a super American production 'Battle Of The Year The Dream Team', in theaters since November 13, 2013, and which has for conclusion the victory of the Koreans. Only the reality is quite different! Since 2006, France has not won any title at the Battle Of The Year International. The company Vagabond was the last to honor France that year, winning for the first time the double 'Best Choreography' and the title of 'World Champion' of hip hop dance in battle.\n\nProduction : ATTITUDE / Cat's Eyes\n\nMontage : Nadja Harek / Gilles Langlois\n\nImage : Gilles Langlois / Cat's Eyes\n\nDirector : Nadja Harek\n\nCapturing the raw power of a grass-roots hip-hop movement in the heart of Texas, INSIDE THE CIRCLE tells the story of two strikingly talented b-boys, Josh and Omar, former best friends who become rivals when they join competing dance crews. Immersed in the b-boy culture of defiant creativity, Omar rises to international renown while Josh tangles with the Texas criminal justice system. Both of them struggle to keep dance at the center of their lives, and the 'B-Boy City' competitive events thrown by visionary street dancer Romeo Navarro serve as emotional milestones in their journey to adulthood. Facing off in intense dance battles that mirror the larger events in their lives, Josh and Omar seek redemption, identity and respect 'inside the circle.' As Romeo aptly observes: 'If you can hold yourself down in battle, you can hold yourself down in life.'"
