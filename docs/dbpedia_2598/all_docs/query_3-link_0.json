        "text": "Hip-hop has lost another legend. Rico Wade, an integral part of the bedrock of Southern hip-hop, the godfather of modern Atlanta rap, and one-third of the production crew Organized Noize with Patrick \"Sleepy\" Brown and Ray Murray, has died. He was 52.\n\nWade was a force that helped launch the careers of OutKast, Goodie Mob, Ludacris, and Future, and produced and co-wrote hits for artists including TLC's \"Waterfalls,\" as part of a mid-'90s Southern hip-hop renaissance. The epicenter of this revolution was the Dungeon, his mother's basement in East Point, Georgia. The location built a reputation as a haven for Dungeon Family artists like André \"André 3000\" Benjamin and Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton among a generation of ATL creatives formulating their own flavor of Southern rap.\n\n\"We're deeply saddened by the passing of Rico Wade, one of Atlanta’s most prolific music producers,\" said Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. \"Rico's influential contributions to the Atlanta music scene beginning in the 1990s helped foster the rise of some of hip-hop’s most prominent artists and played a pivotal role in shaping the genre as we know it today. Our hearts go out to his family, friends, and all those whose lives he influenced.”\n\nWade was nominated for two GRAMMYs during his lifetime including Record Of The Year for TLC's \"Waterfalls\" and Album Of The Year for OutKast's Stankonia.\n\n“Rico left an indelible mark on music and culture around the world and for that, the South will always have something to say,” said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens in an issued statement echoing the famous battle cry of André 3000's 1995 Source Awards Best New Artist acceptance speech.\n\nIt's been more than 30 years since OutKast dropped their first-ever single \"Player's Ball\" in 1993 and on that track Wade's voice is the first. He sets the tone for the legendary duo's entire career and Southern hip-hop at the same time with the introduction: \"Man, the scene was so thick/ Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs/ Nothin' but them 'Lacs/ All the players, all the hustlers/ I'm talkin' 'bout a Black man heaven here/ You know what I'm sayin'?\"\n\n\"Rico Wade brought us to his house studio, where I heard the most interesting music production I'd ever heard from Atlanta,\" André 3000 told the Recording Academy in a 2019 interview reflecting on his experience working on OutKast's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. \"It was Rico, Ray, and Sleepy's vision to make sure [OutKast would put] Southern lifestyle first. I was just playing my part the best I could.\"\n\nOutkast's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik would go on to sell 500,000 records and became certified platinum within a year. \"When we were working on the OutKast vibe, even though there were two members in the group, we all considered ourselves OutKast at the time — including all of Organized Noize and the Goodie Mob members who appeared on the album,\" Murray told the Recording Academy in 2019.\n\nRead more: OutKast Examine Their Southern Experience On 'Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik'\n\nOrganized Noize signed a publishing deal with L.A. Reid and Babyface's label LaFace Records in 1993, setting the foundation for their work on OutKast's seminal \"Player's Ball\" single. It was a lasting connection that would serve the rest of Wade's career.\n\nWade would continue to work with Reid during Reid's tenure as chairman and CEO of Epic Records from 2013 to 2017, building a hub for hip-hop artists at the label including Wade's cousin, Atlanta rapper Future. Future would become the first artist ever on the Billboard charts to debut back-to-back albums at No. 1 with his 2017 release HNDRXX. In March, Future and Metro Boomin jointly released another No.1 album, We Don’t Trust You.\n\nWade nurtured Future's talents through his Dungeon connects. The two didn't meet until Future was well into his teens, but once they did Wade quickly put his cousin's clear drive and talent to use, introducing him to the Dungeon Family and bringing him into the studio to work on in-house production projects including Ludacris' \"Blueberry Yum Yum\" (Red Light District), which earned Future a songwriting credit in 2004.\n\n“That's how he ended up writing the record for Ludacris, becoming part of a group that could make music, and getting a record deal,” Wade told Complex in 2013. “It showed him that the music industry money is real.\"\n\nInspired by his cousin, Future studied the industry through the in-roads made by Wade. “I took everything I learned from him and applied it to my everyday craft from being in the studio,” Future told Complex. \"Just knowing how to feel records so I know how to make songs and write for people to keep around and go to the next level.” His devotion to Wade's tutelage and legacy is apparent in the Olde English script tattooed across his arms that matches Wade's own markings — \"DUNGEON\" appears on the right and \"FAMILY\" on the left.\n\nKiller Mike, a constant collaborator who worked with Wade on his latest album Michael which swept the 2024 GRAMMYs rap categories with three wins for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance, announced Wade's passing in an Instagram post on Sunday. \"I don't have the words to express my deep and profound sense of loss. I am Praying for your wife and Children. I am praying for the Wade family. I am praying for us all,\" Killer Mike wrote. \"I deeply appreciate your acceptance into The Dungeon Family, mentorship, Friendship and Brotherhood. Idk where I would be without ya'll.\"\n\nHow 1994 Changed The Game For Hip-Hop\n\nWhile significant attention was devoted to the celebration of hip-hop in 2023 — an acknowledgement of what is widely acknowledged as its 50th anniversary — another important anniversary in hip-hop is happening this year as well. Specifically, it’s been 30 years since 1994, when a new generation entered the music industry and set the genre on a course that in many ways continues until today.\n\nThere are many ways to look at 1994: lists of great albums (here’s a top 50 to get you started); a look back at what fans and tastemakers were actually listening to at the time; the best overlooked obscurities. But the best way to really understand why a single 365 three decades ago had such an impact is to narrow our focus to look at the important debut albums released that year.\n\nAn artist’s or group’s debut is their entry into the wider musical conversation, their first full statement about who they are and where in the landscape they see themselves. The debuts released in 1994 — which include the Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die, Nas' Illmatic and Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik from Outkast — were notable not only in their own right, but because of the insight they give us into wider trends in rap.\n\nRead on for some of the ways that 1994's debut records demonstrated what was happening in rap at the time, and showed us the way forward.\n\nHip-Hop Became More Than Just An East & West Coast Thing\n\nThe debut albums that moved rap music in 1994 were geographically varied, which was important for a music scene that was still, from a national perspective, largely tied to the media centers at the coasts. Yes, there were New York artists (Biggie and Nas most notably, as well as O.C., Jeru the Damaja, the Beatnuts, and Keith Murray). The West Coast G-funk domination, which began in late 1992 with Dr. Dre’s The Chronic, continued with Dre’s step brother Warren G.\n\nBut the huge number of important debuts from other places around the country in 1994 showed that rap music had developed mature scenes in multiple cities — scenes that fans from around the country were starting to pay significant attention to.\n\nTo begin with, there was Houston. The Geto Boys were arguably the first artists from the city to gain national attention (and controversy) several years prior. By 1994, the city’s scene had expanded enough to allow a variety of notable debuts, of wildly different styles, to make their way into the marketplace.\n\nRead more: A Guide To Texas Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Events\n\nThe Rap-A-Lot label that first brought the Geto Boys to the world’s attention branched out with Big Mike’s Somethin’ Serious and the Odd Squad’s Fadanuf Fa Erybody!! Both had bluesy, soulful sounds that were quickly becoming the label’s trademark — in no small part due to their main producers, N.O. Joe and Mike Dean. In addition, an entirely separate style centered around the slowed-down mixes of DJ Screw began to expand outside of the South Side with the debut release by Screwed Up Click member E.S.G.\n\nThere were also notable debut albums by artists and groups from Cleveland (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Creepin on ah Come Up), Oakland (Saafir and Casual), and of course Atlanta — more about that last one later.\n\n1994 Saw The Pinnacle Of Boom-Bap\n\nPopularized by KRS-One’s 1993 album Return of the Boom Bap, the term \"boom bap\" started as an onomatopoeic way of referring to the sound of a standard rap drum pattern — the \"boom\" of a kick drum on the downbeat, followed by the \"bap\" of a snare on the backbeat.\n\nThe style that would grow to be associated with that name (though it was not much-used at the time) was at its apex in 1994. A handful of primarily East Coast producers and groups were beginning a new sonic conversation, using innovations like filtered bass lines while competing to see who could flip the now standard sample sources in ever-more creative ways.\n\nMost of the producers at the height of this style — DJ Premier, Buckwild, RZA, Large Professor, Pete Rock and the Beatnuts, to name a few — worked on notable debuts that year. Premier produced all of Jeru the Damaja’s The Sun Rises in the East. Buckwild helmed nearly the entirety of O.C.’s debut Word…Life. RZA was responsible for Method Man’s Tical. The Beatnuts took care of their own full-length Street Level. Easy Mo Bee and Premier both played a part in Biggie’s Ready to Die. And then there was Illmatic, which featured a veritable who’s who of production elites: Premier, L.E.S., Large Professor, Pete Rock, and Q-Tip.\n\nThe work the producers did on these records was some of the best of their respective careers. Even now, putting on tracks like O.C.’s \"Time’s Up\" (Buckwild), Jeru’s \"Come Clean\" (Premier), Meth’s \"Bring the Pain\" (RZA), Biggie’s \"The What\" (Easy Mo Bee), or Nas’ \"The World Is Yours\" (Pete Rock) will get heads nodding.\n\nMajor Releases Balanced Street Sounds & Commercial Appeal\n\n\"Rap is not pop/If you call it that, then stop,\" spit Q-Tip on 1991’s \"Check the Rhime.\" Two years later, De La Soul were adamant that \"It might blow up, but it won’t go pop.\" In 1994, the division between rap and pop — under attack at least since Biz Markie made something for the radio back in the ‘80s — began to collapse entirely thanks to the team of the Notorious B.I.G. and his label head and producer Sean \"Puffy\" Combs.\n\nBiggie was the hardcore rhymer who wanted to impress his peers while spitting about \"Party & Bulls—.\" Puff was the businessman who wanted his artist to sell millions and be on the radio. The result of their yin-and-yang was Ready to Die, an album that perfectly balanced these ambitions.\n\nThis template — hardcore songs like \"Machine Gun Funk\" for the die-hards, sing-a-longs like \"Juicy\" for the newly curious — is one that Big’s good friend Jay-Z would employ while climbing to his current iconic status.\n\nSolo Stars Broke Out Of Crews\n\nOne major thing that happened in 1994 is that new artists were created not out of whole cloth, but out of existing rap crews. Warren G exploded into stardom with his debut Regulate… G Funk Era. He came out of the Death Row Records axis — he was Dre’s stepbrother, and had been in a group with a pre-fame Snoop Dogg. Across the country, Method Man sprang out of the Wu-Tang collective and within a year had his own hit single with \"I’ll Be There For You/You’re All I Need To Get By.\"\n\nAnyone who listened to the Odd Squad’s album could tell that there was a group member bound for solo success: Devin the Dude. Keith Murray popped out of the Def Squad. Casual came out of the Bay Area’s Hieroglyphics.\n\nRead more: A Guide To Bay Area Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From Northern California\n\nThis would be the model for years to come: Create a group of artists and attempt, one by one, to break them out as stars. You could see it in Roc-a-fella, Ruff Ryders, and countless other crews towards the end of the ‘90s and the beginning of the new millennium.\n\nMulti-Producer Albums Began To Dominate\n\nIllmatic was not the first rap album to feature multiple prominent producers. However, it quickly became the most influential. The album’s near-universal critical acclaim — it earned a perfect five-mic score in The Source — meant that its strategy of gathering all of the top production talent together for one album would quickly become the standard.\n\nWithin less than a decade, the production credits on major rap albums would begin to look nearly identical: names like the Neptunes, Timbaland, Premier, Kanye West, and the Trackmasters would pop up on album after album. By the time Jay-Z said he’d get you \"bling like the Neptunes sound,\" it became de rigueur to have a Neptunes beat on your album, and to fill out the rest of the tracklist with other big names (and perhaps a few lesser-known ones to save money).\n\nThe South Got Something To Say\n\nIf there’s one city that can safely be said to be the center of rap music for the past decade or so, it’s Atlanta. While the ATL has had rappers of note since Shy-D and Raheem the Dream, it was a group that debuted in 1994 that really set the stage for the city’s takeover.\n\nOutkast’s Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was the work of two young, ambitious teenagers, along with the production collective Organized Noize. The group’s first video was directed by none other than Puffy. Biggie fell so in love with the city that he toyed with moving there.\n\nOutkast's debut album won Best New Artist and Best New Rap of the Year at the 1995 Source Awards, though the duo of André 3000 and Big Boi walked on stage to accept their award to a chorus of boos. The disrespect only pushed André to affirm the South's place on the rap map, famously telling the audience, \"The South got something to say.\"\n\nRead more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nOutkast’s success meant that they kept on making innovative albums for several more years, as did other members of their Dungeon Family crew. This brought energy and attention to the city, as did the success of Jermain Dupri’s So So Def label. Then came the \"snap\" movement of the 2000s, and of course trap music, which had its roots in aughts-era Atlanta artists like T.I. and producers like Shawty Redd and DJ Toomp.\n\nBut in the 2010s a new artist would make Atlanta explode, and he traced his lineage straight back to the Dungeon. Future is the first cousin of Organized Noize member Rico Wade, and was part of the so-called \"second generation\" of the Dungeon Family back when he went by \"Meathead.\" His world-beating success over the past decade-plus has been a cornerstone in Atlanta’s rise to the top of the rap world. Young Thug, who has cited Future as an influence, has sparked a veritable ecosystem of sound-alikes and proteges, some of whom have themselves gone on to be major artists.\n\nAtlanta’s reign at the top of the rap world, some theorize, may finally be coming to an end, at least in part because of police pressure. But the city has had a decade-plus run as the de facto capital of rap, and that’s thanks in no small part to Outkast.\n\nWhy 1998 Was Hip-Hop's Most Mature Year: From The Rise Of The Underground To Artist Masterworks\n\n2023 has seen countless tributes to hip-hop, celebrating both its golden anniversary and the staying power of a genre that was vilified, underestimated, and branded a passing fad for decades. Nonetheless, while 50 is a major milestone, many believe hip-hop reached its peak decades ago.\n\nAt the tail end of the golden age of hip-hop, the genre reached a new level of maturity. Twenty-five years ago, hip-hop music demonstrated a wide variety of production styles and a diversity of perspectives. Further proving that 1998 was a high watermark for hip-hop, several important and stylistically distinct albums by Jay-Z, Black Star, A Tribe Called Quest and Outkast were even released on the same day.\n\nThis diversity of expression resulted in multiple commercially successful, distinct subgenres and niche audiences. The culture moved beyond the bi-coastal hostility that had culminated in the tragic murders of Tupac and Biggie, and the South asserted itself in a big way. The year’s versatility was demonstrated through the emergence of an underground scene that was critical of mainstream hip-hop’s consumerist mentality, but nonetheless thrived alongside commercially successful albums by both new and established artists.\n\nSouthern Hip-Hop Earns Respect\n\nBy 1998 groups beyond the East and West Coasts had started to gain national visibility — a hallmark of hip-hop's growing maturity.\n\nWhile Outkast's Andre 3000 famously declared that \"The South got somethin’ to say\" in1995, the group didn't earn widespread respect and recognition until three years later. Released in September 1998, Aquemini, garnered near-universal praise — earning Outkast a notoriously rare five mics in The Source — and is still considered to be one of hip-hop’s greatest albums.\n\nNo other hip-hop group sounded like Outkast, and Southern flavor and slang pervaded the album (see the harmonica breakdown in \"Rosa Parks\"), but it was also the live instrumentation on tracks like \"Liberation\" and \"SpottieOttieDopaliscious\" that made the album so special.\n\nFellow ATLiens Goodie MOB, a group in the Dungeon Family collective, also released an album in '98. Like Aquemini, their sophomore effort Still Standing was produced largely by Organized Noize and featured a similar production style.\n\nOutkast and Goodie MOB collaborated often in the 1990s: Aquemini’s \"Liberation\" only works because of the deeply soulful vocals of Goodie MOB’s Cee-Lo, and Still Standing’s \"Black Ice\" features one of Andre 3000’s most poetic and brilliant verses. While speaking to the many struggles of being young, Black and poor in the South, these two groups demonstrated how regional pride could be asserted in a more positive way, instead of spilling over into real-life violence; it was evidence of hip-hop’s maturity.\n\nOn the more commercial side, Atlanta rapper/producer Jermaine Dupri — who was already producing and writing songs for major R&B artists like Usher and Mariah Carey — released his debut album, resulting in one of the hits of the summer: the bouncy Jay-Z collaboration \"Money Ain’t A Thang.\" New Orleans was also becoming an important locus of Southern hip-hop by 1998, with Master P’s No Limit Records releasing albums by Master P himself, Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder, Mystikal, and Snoop Dogg. Hits included \"Make ‘Em Say Ugh\" and \"It Ain’t My Fault,\" both containing Mystikal’s distinctive high-pitched growling; his lightning-fast verse on the first song is truly something to behold. Also from Crescent City, Cash Money Records struck gold with Juvenile’s 400 Degreez and his booty-shaking anthem, \"Back That Azz Up.\"\n\nThe Rise of Underground Hip-Hop\n\n1998 was also the year \"underground\" hip-hop bubbled to the surface as a reaction to the genre’s crossover success. It was defined primarily by a critique of the presumed excessive consumerism of mainstream hip-hop, and a desire to return to the days when DJs, b-boys and graffiti artists were as important as rappers.\n\nTurntablism was strongly associated with this style, as were cyphers — gatherings where rappers, b-boys and beatboxers would form a circle and engage in freestyle battles. The emergence of underground hip-hop was another sign that the genre was maturing as a whole; artists were no longer as worried about the ghettoization by the music industry and some felt that it had strayed too far from its marginalized roots.\n\nThe most significant underground hip-hop album of 1998 was Mos Def and Talib Kweli are Black Star, created by a young duo of Brooklyn MCs. Interestingly, it was released on the same day in September as Aquemini, as well as two other major albums of the year: Jay-Z’s Vol. 2…Hard Knock Life and A Tribe Called Quest’s The Love Movement — which although not an essential listen in their discography, did produce a hit with \"Find A Way.\" Four major albums released on the same day was a testament to how far hip-hop had come.\n\nIn fact, the Black Star album was an explicit critique of the type of consumerist mentality and sexually explicit/boasting lyrics Jay-Z employed on Hard Knock Life. Songs like \"Definition\" display Mos Def and Talib Kweli’s exceptional lyrical dexterity and clever references, while \"Hater Players\" draws a clear line in the sand between commercial hip-hop and the \"real MCs.\" In the latter, Kweli raps: \"We ain't havin’ that, reachin’ past the star status that you grabbin’ at/ My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat.\"\n\nMos Def’s adaptation of Slick Rick’s \"Children’s Story\" is a clever screed about the lack of originality within mainstream hip-hop. \"They jacked the beats, money came wit' ease, but son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease. He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder.\" The song was a not-so-veiled reference to the production technique utilized by Puff Daddy, relying heavily on well-known samples of soul and R&B songs.\n\nBlack Star also distinguished itself from much of commercial rap of the time by uplifting, instead of denigrating, women. \"Brown Skin Lady\" is an ode to Black women throughout the African diaspora, presenting a clear contrast to the frequent use of the b-word on Hard Knock Life, particularly on one of its biggest hits, \"Can I Get A…\" Nonetheless, like many \"conscious\" rappers — notably, Common, who makes a guest appearance on this album — Black Star reflects the almost-universal homophobia in hip-hop at the time, particularly in Mos Def’s verse on \"Re-Definition.\"\n\nDespite Jay-Z’s distrust and demonization of women on Hard Knock Life — his third and most commercially successful record — no one can dispute his tremendous verbal prowess and flow, evident on tracks like \"N— What, N— Who.\" And while he called out \"gold diggers\" in \"Can I Get A…,\" he invited a female rapper (Amil) onto the song — leveling the playing field a bit.\n\nProduction-wise, Jay-Z’s use of the \"Annie\" theme for the title song was one of the most inspired choices in the genre’s history. The slick production of the album guaranteed it would be a home run; in retrospect, it heralded the future of commercial hip-hop’s sound.\n\nOher underground hip-hop artists were making big waves in 1998. Rawkus Records — which released the Black Star album — put out an important compilation, Lyricist Lounge, Volume 1, which featured performances by Mos Def, Talib Kweli, A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, and the L.A.-based Jurassic 5, who also released their debut album that year. Other West Coast underground artists who released debut albums in 1998 included the Bay Area-based Hieroglyphics and Rasco, and the L.A.-based Aceyalone and People Under the Stairs.\n\nDebuts, Veterans And The Biggest Album Of The Year\n\n1998 also saw the release of important debut albums by commercial hip-hop artists like DMX, Big Pun and Black Eyed Peas. Big Pun’s \"Still Not A Player\" was one of the biggest hits of the year, with his lyricism reminiscent of Biggie.\n\nDMX had a particularly productive year, releasing two albums in 1998, It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot and Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood. That year, it was impossible to escape the melodic hook and chorus of \"Ruff Ryders’ Anthem\" (\"Stop! Drop! Shut ‘em down, open up shop\") from the first DMX album. DMX also contributed a memorable verse on the Lox’s hit \"Money, Power, Respect,\" off the group’s debut album, released by Puffy’s Bad Boy.\n\nBeyond the debut albums of 1998, a slew of established artists from various regions and representing myriad styles put out their third, fourth or fifth albums. East Coast artists with new albums included Beastie Boys, Method Man, Redman, Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah, Gang Starr, Mc Lyte, and Public Enemy, who released a soundtrack album for Spike Lee’s He Got Game. On the West Coast, there were new albums by Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, and Digital Underground.\n\nNotwithstanding the success of so many diverse hip-hop artists, no album achieved greater heights than Lauryn Hill’s masterful solo debut, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. To start, it won Album Of The Year at the 1999 GRAMMYs, a feat never before accomplished for a hip-hop artist, as well as four other golden gramophones. Hill wrote, arranged and produced the album herself, reportedly turning down offers for production help from both her former Fugees bandmate Wyclef Jean and her label, which suggested bringing in Wu-Tang Clan’s mastermind, RZA.\n\nThe album was somewhere between R&B and hip-hop (and in fact was nominated and won in R&B instead of rap categories), and right off the bat, the album showcases Hill’s considerable skill as both a rapper and singer. The dancehall-inflected \"Lost Ones\" takes on an aggressive stance, with Hill rapping in Jamaican patois and invoking phrases of religious retribution, but it’s followed by a neo-soul breakup ballad, \"Ex-Factor,\" featuring Hill’s signature throaty vocals.\n\nThe other major hits on the album besides \"Ex-Factor\" were \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" and \"Everything Is Everything,\" which cemented Hill as one of the best lyricists in hip-hop. Twenty-five years later, the whole album holds up beautifully and features some incredible invited guests.\n\nPerhaps it’s not a coincidence that the first hip-hop album to break the Album Of The Year barrier was released in 1998 — when the genre had reached what is arguably its creative apex. With the incredible stylistic and regional diversity of that year’s albums, hip-hop had succeeded beyond its founders’ wildest dreams.\n\nHip-Hop Just Rang In 50 Years As A Genre. What Will Its Next 50 Years Look Like?\n\nOn Nov. 13, the world woke up to the announcement that André 3000 — the seven-time GRAMMY winning and 23-time nominated Outkast star — would release his debut (!) solo album, New Blue Sun, on Nov. 17.\n\nVia an NPR scoop, stunned to learn there are \"no bars, no beats, no sub-bass. André doesn't sing on this joint, either.\" Rather, the instrumental, 87-minute album is the culmination of a years-long preoccupation with various flutes — including contrabass, Mayan, bamboo, and a variety of digital models.\n\nAnd in their reactions, some of those fans spoke for all of us.\n\n\"Andre 3000 has about as much critical goodwill as it's possible to have and he is going to test every fiber of that collective empathy,\" one journalist and editor opined on X. Another music writer and editor chimed in: \"This is the tracklisting. This is going to mess up so many peoples' Spotify algorithms.\"\n\nAnd Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on \"The Daily Show,\" summed it up: That boy trained wit Pai Mei & got a Hattori Hanzo Flute. He ready.\"\n\nWith New Blue Sun on the immediate horizon, here's everything we know about it.\n\nIt's Built On Improvisation\n\nAs NPR points out, New Blue Sun materialized in part due to André's relocation from Atlanta — where Outkast famously hails from — to Los Angeles. There, he ran into the potent percussionist and experimental jazzer, Carlos Niño.\n\nAfter André and his flute began dropping by Niño's house for basement jam sessions, he was introduced to a whole new world of collaborators, including keyboardist (and Alice Coltrane disciple) Surya Botofasina and guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Nate Mercereau.\n\n\"We're listening to each other, we're responding to each other, we're supporting each other at certain times… it's kind of mirroring real life,\" the artist told NPR. \"It's a full living, breathing album because it's fully alive. We didn't sketch it out.\"\n\nThe Titles Are Absolutely Gonzo\n\nCheck them out for yourself:\n\nI swear, I Really Wanted To Make A \"Rap\" Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time\n\nThe Slang Word P(*)ssy Rolls Off The Tongue With Far Better Ease Than The Proper Word Vagina . Do You Agree?\n\nThat Night In Hawaii When I Turned Into A Panther And Started Making These Low Register Purring Tones That I Couldn't Control ... Sh¥t Was Wild\n\nBuyPoloDisorder's Daughter Wears A 3000™ Button Down Embroidered\n\nNinety Three 'Til Infinity And Beyoncé\n\nGhandi, Dalai Lama, Your Lord & Savior J.C. / Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, And John Wayne Gacy\n\nAnts To You, Gods To Who ?\n\nDreams Once Buried Beneath The Dungeon Floor Slowly Sprout Into Undying Gardens\n\nHave Gandhi, Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Dalai Lama ever appeared in the same song title? We think not.\n\nThe Album Title Represents Rebirth\n\nAndré described New Blue Sun's title in heavily sci-fi, yet personal terms.\n\n\"The next world or the next beings will be under a bluer, cooler burning sun. It will burn cooler, but it will be large,\" he explained to NPR. \"So when you look up at the sky in these times, there'll be this larger globe of bluish, still bright but bluish because it's cooler. It's kind of like this whole album and this whole direction is a new world for me.\"\n\nIt Represents A Culmination Of His Interest In Jazz\n\nIn said interview, André 3000 shouts out jazz/pop crossovers, like Dave Brubeck's \"Take Five\" and Chuck Mangione's \"Feels So Good,\" as galvanizing.\n\n\"As a rapper, I associated jazz music with old people and elevator music,\" he admitted. \"I remember that playing on the radio as a kid and humming the melodies. So I'm getting affected by these instrumental cats. And once I started really getting into it, I'm like, hold up: Jazz was the rap of that time.\"\n\nFrom there, he absorbed John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Yusef Lateef… the rest is history.\n\n\"That Night In Hawaii…\" Is About An Ayahuasca Trip\n\nYes, he really did turn into a panther… or felt like it.\n\n\"We did it like a three-night kind of phase. The first night was inviting and beautiful and the most powerful love and connection with all things I've ever felt in my life,\" he said — and the second was a different story.\n\n\"My stomach was hurting, my mouth contorted like a panther and I actually turned into a panther,\" he related. \"And I was doing like GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR — like, that kind of thing.\"\n\nIf you find yourself purring for this strange, lovely offering, check it out this Friday, and read the full NPR interview — and keep checking GRAMMY.com for more info about New Blue Sun!\n\n10 Reasons Why Outkast's 'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below' Is One Of Rap's Most Influential Double Albums"
