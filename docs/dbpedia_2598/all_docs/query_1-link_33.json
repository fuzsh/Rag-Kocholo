        "text": "With temps climbing and the sun frankly being just too bright, there’s no better time to hide away in a dark, air conditioned movie theater. And luckily, August has delivered on giving us all some exciting films for us to see as we shelter-in-place (at the theater). This month we have everything from alpine horror to a couple of music led pics, and some home viewing including a vertigo-inducing romance. Check them out below.\n\nDANDELION\n\nWhen You Can Watch: Now\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters\n\nDirector: Nicole Riegel\n\nCast: Thomas Doherty, Kiki Layne, Melanie Nicholls-King\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Film Independent Spirit Awards alum for Best First Feature for her coming-of-age drama Holler, writer-director Riegel’s sophomore film premiered at SXSW. Part of the Film Independent Presents screening series, the drama follows the titular Dandelion (Layne), a struggling singer-songwriter from Cincinnati who takes a gig in South Dakota because she has run out of options. When she meets Scottish guitarist Casey (Doherty), sparks fly. As she joins his nomadic group of musicians, the experience expands her definition of what success and art truly means to her.\n\nSKYWALKERS: A LOVE STORY\n\nWhen You Can Watch: Now\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Part of July’s Film Independent Presents series, this vertiginous documentary follows a couple who gets their thrills from climbing on the world’s tallest structures to perform gasp-inducing acrobatic stunts that wow their social media followers. As talented gymnast Angela from Moscow begins to make a name for herself in the sport of rooftopping, she meets fellow rooftopper, Vanya. Together, their “skywalking” soon goes viral and they eventually fall in love. Filmed over six years across six countries, the film takes us through the daredevil couple’s biggest challenge yet—climbing Malaysia’s Merdeka 118 super-skyscaper, including up to its 160-meter spire.\n\nLADY IN THE LAKE\n\nWhen You Can Watch: Now\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Apple TV+\n\nDirector: Alma Har’el\n\nCast: Natalie Portman, Moses Ingram, Y’lan Noel, Byron Bowers, Noah Jupe\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Based on Laura Lippman’s 2019 bestseller, Spirit Awards alum (for Honey Boy and Bombay Beach) Har’el’s seven-part miniseries is also actress Natalie Portman’s (Black Swan, May December) TV debut. Sick of her life, rich, white Jewish housewife Maddie (Portman) leaves her overbearing husband and son to reinvent herself as an investigative reporter. Meanwhile, Cleo (Ingram) works three jobs—including as the bookkeeper for an illegal gambling operation—trying to feed her family. The women’s lives collide when a young girl disappears at the Thanksgiving parade in 1966, and the city of Baltimore is engulfed by the mystery. Writer-director-EP Har’el is a Film Independent Member.\n\nKNEECAP\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 2\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters\n\nDirectors: Rich Peppiatt\n\nCast: Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, DJ Próvai, Michael Fassbender, Josie Walker\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Following the rise of the hip-hop trio Kneecap from Belfast, the dramedy is the first film in the Irish language to screen at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. In writer-director Peppiatt’s feature debut, the trio play themselves in their acting debuts. Rapping in their native Irish language, the film explores how the group became unlikely figures in a movement to save their mother tongue. Shot in Belfast, the film screened last month as part of the Film Independent Presents series, followed by an in-person conversation with Peppiatt and actors Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Prováí. Check back later on YouTube for the conversation.\n\nCUCKOO\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 9\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters\n\nDirector: Tilman Singer\n\nCast: Hunter Schafer, Jan Bluthardt, Marton Csókás, Dan Stevens, Jessica Henwick\n\nWhy We’re Excited: A U.S.-German co-pro, writer-director Singer’s sophomore offering was nominated in both SWSX and Berlinale. Teenager Gretchen (Schafer) is stuck in a hotel in the German Alps with her father (Csókás), his new wife Beth (Henwick), and a step-sister, Alma (Mila Lieu). The hotel is run by one Mr. Konig (Stevens of Downton Abbey fame), whose excessive friendliness belies his sinister intentions. Add a creepy hospital just up the road, what could possibly go wrong? Film Independent Members on the project include Executive Producers Jeff Deutchman and Jason Wald.\n\nGOOD ONE\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 9\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters (Limited)\n\nDirector: India Donaldson\n\nCast: Lily Collias, James Le Gros, Danny McCarthy, Sumaya Bouhbal, Valentine Black\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Writer-director Donaldson produced her feature debut, which was nominated at this year’s Cannes and Sundance film festivals. Wise beyond her years, queer teenager Sam (Collias) reluctantly joins her anxious dad Chris (Le Gros) and his oldest pal Matt (McCarthy) in the Catskills on a camping trip. When tensions break out between the men over long-festering grievances, she attempts to mediate and keep the peace. A long line of Film Independent members worked on the project, including Executive Producers Neil Champagne, Jack Pearkes, and Sarah Winshall, and Co-Producer/Line Producer, Olivia Mastrangelo. Winshall is also a Fellow from the 2021 Fast Track program.\n\nDAUGHTERS\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 14\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Netflix\n\nDirector: Angela Patton and Natalie Rae\n\nWhy We’re Excited: A moving insider look into the relationship between daughters and fathers who are incarcerated, the documentary took eight years to complete following the collaboration with filmmaker Rae and Patton, the CEO of the nonprofit, Girls for a Change. The ‘Date with Dad’ program encourages father-daughter bonding during these long difficult years. Following four young ladies—Aubrey, Santana, Raziah, and Ja’Ana—the film culminates with a father-daughter dance at the end of the program. Here is yet another project with strong Film Independent pedigree, including EP Hallee Adelman, Producer Sam Bisbee, and Associate Producer Saul Germaine on the producing team.\n\nBETWEEN THE TEMPLES\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 23\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters (Limited)\n\nDirector: Nathan Silver\n\nCast: Jason Schwartzman, Carol Kane, Dolly De Leon, Robert Smigel\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Los Angeles Film Festival alum for his 2013 feature Uncertain Terms, writer-director Silver’s comedy (with a script he co-wrote with C. Mason Wells) premiered at Sundance earlier this year. Reeling from the recent death of his wife, young widower and cantor, Ben (Schwartzman from Asteroid City and The Grand Budapest Hotel), lives with his mother, who encourages him to start dating again. That’s when he meets Carla (Kane from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), a new adult bat mitzvah student who turns out to be his grade school music teacher from decades ago. Filmed in Kingston, New York, the film has also screened at Berlinale and Tribeca. Executive Producer Joshua Blum and producers Tim Headington and Theresa Steele Page are Film Independent members.\n\nBLINK TWICE\n\nWhen You Can Watch: August 23\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters\n\nDirector: Zoë Kravitz\n\nCast: Naomi Ackie, Channing Tatum, Christian Slater, Simon Rex, Adria Arjona, Kyle MacLachlan, Haley Joel Osment, with Geena Davis and Alia Shawkat\n\nWhy We’re Excited: For her directing debut, writer-director Kratvitz (Big Little Lies, The Batman) co-wrote this psychological thriller with E.T. Feigenbaum (Hulu romantic dramedy, High Fidelity). When cocktail waitress Frida (Ackie) meets charming tech mogul Slater King (Tatum) at a gala, the chemistry between them is undeniable. He soon invites her to join him and his pals for a luxurious week of hedonism and rejuvenation on his private island. Everything looks and feels idyllic day after day, until one of her friends vanishes. As she begins to question her reality, will she make it out of this party alive? Shot in Mexico, the Amazon MGM Studios film marks the first collaboration between IRL engaged couple, Kravitz and Tatum.\n\n*PROGRAMMER’S PICK* SING SING\n\nWhen You Can Watch: Now\n\nWhere You Can Watch: Theaters (Limited)\n\nDirector: Greg Kwedar\n\nCast: Colman Domingo, Clarence Maclin, Sean San Jose\n\nWhy We’re Excited: Film Independent Senior Programmer Jenn Wilson shares, “Greg Kwedar (2022 Spirit Awards nominee in the John Cassavetes Award category for Jockey) directs his second feature starring the incredible Colman Domingo (John “Divine G” Whitfield) as a man wrongfully imprisoned at Sing Sing. Divine G passes his time by participating in the prison’s theater program, where the incarcerated men perform works by playwrights like Shakespeare, or they write their own show. Led by their civilian advisor and director, played by the incredible Paul Raci, the theater group decides to embark on a project inspired by each individual performer that Divine G will script for them. Through their rehearsal process, the incarcerated men struggle not only with their performances on the stage, but the drama taking place in their personal lives as well. An excellent writer, Divine G helps those working on their appeals, but he finds it hard to see others released from prison while his own appeals are denied. Brilliantly shot and directed, Sing Sing features one of the finest ensemble performances in a film this year.”\n\nProducer Monique Walton is a Member and Fellow, and the recipient of the Fast Track grant in 2022 and the Amplifier Fellowship in 2024.\n\nKEY\n\nFilm Independent Fellow or Member\n\nFilm Independent Presents Screening, Q&A\n\nMicrobudget\n\nFilmmaker or Lead Characters of Color\n\nFilm Independent Spirit Award Winner or Nominee\n\nFemale Filmmaker\n\nLGBT Filmmaker or Lead LGBT Characters\n\nFirst-time Filmmaker\n\n(Header: Dandelion)\n\nFilm Independent promotes unique independent voices by helping filmmakers create and advance new work.
