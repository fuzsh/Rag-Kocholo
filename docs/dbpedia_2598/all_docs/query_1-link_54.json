        "text": "Gab… What else can we say? Gab is someone we at FUTURE have appreciated for his genuine talent. As a person, he’s as real as they come. His story is one for the ages, they don’t build ’em like that anymore. Since the last time we featured Gab, he’d taken his efforts back to his motherland – Colombia, he toured Spain and we’d ran into him back in NY on an occasion or two.\n\nA few days ago, Gab dropped a project titled; The High Life. The overall feel of the project is much more different than anything we’ve heard from Gab in the past. The production and beat selection on the entirety of this project was very meticulously picked out. A lot of smooth, eclectic, modern-day beats that get swiftly sliced with razor sharp precision, like that of a surgeons scalpel performing open heart surgery. Overall, Gab’s flow hasn’t changed from what you’ve heard from him. In this project, like on many others, Gab resembles a bit of Pac, Pun and Kool G Rap while still remaining himself. This man is truly a wordsmith. In an ever changing industry, where most of today’s popular hip-hop acts lack substance and depth, it is rare to find intricate rhyme schemes and real story-telling lyricists, however, Gab is able to offer that in The High Life.\n\nThe Intro really set’s the bar for this 11 track effort. Incredible production over Christopher Walken’s speech about lions – in the movie Poolhall Junkies. Just before the 2 minute mark, Gab’s voice enters perfectly;\n\n.\n\n“The time has come, time to fulfill my destiny/ Whether or not it’s meant to be, imma die giving everything\n\nImma rock till the memory tatted up in the history/ With or without the industry, I will not be a mystery\n\nI will not be a simile, metaphor or facsimile / I will die an original, pedigree unequivocally\n\nI was cut from a cloth woven out of honor/ A fabric manufactured by my forefathers\n\nAnd this I carry it, Gladiators and Chariots / Corona to Colombia, the reputation immaculate\n\nBut before we take a trip into them skylights / Let’s take a little trip into the high life.”\n\n.\n\nTrack 2, titled “The High Life (Top of the world)” is one of the more stand-out tracks on the whole project. Rhyme schemes and flow are flawless. The chorus features a phenomenal chorus by Devo D and production by the Colombians. Track 3, “Silhouettes” has a darker, Wu-type-feel and features a brilliant chorus sung by Colombian urban artist: Mary Helen. Mary, who’s primary language is not English is able to offer her unique tone of voice and an accent that gives the chorus a perfect feel.\n\nIf you want to know Gab’s story, we suggest listening to “Never Be The Same”. The singing on this track could of been better.. It’s just that the singers on the previous two tracks set the bar real high. Track 5’s chorus is executed real dope – in typical Gab form, this is a hustlers anthem “12 Hour Shift” Ft. Soul. Vocals are raw on this one, not much effects – just what one would expect from a hustlers anthem.\n\nParadis… wow! Probably our favorite track off this project. If you don’t know what Paradis is, it’s a gourmet, elegant cognac – part of the Hennessy collection, one bottle can be priced at $500 and better. The production by Chris Hollywood for One Man Band is impeccable. The feeling is similar to that of flying in a learjet and peaking out the window to see the sun rising over South American mountains. Perfect. The metaphors on this track are bananas;\n\n“Kush clouds in the sky when I slam shut, the new benz doors they open like throw your hands up!\n\nAll I gotta say, we on another lane… like a missed flight, we on another plane\n\nWe have another route, built around a better plan\n\nWe in Jets, we crushing green like the Medowlands / Pop a Paradis…”\n\nWow…\n\nRiel of Ghetto Grime Music channels his Scorsese on the production for “Fatal Attraction”. Gab’s a craftsman on this story-telling concept of cocaine. A must listen. Dope concept, no pun intended.\n\nOn “Numb to it”, Gab offers some outstanding lyrical material. Sadly the production and chorus do it no justice. We do however, love the 90’s Queens Hip Hop feel on this one produced by Mighty 1.\n\n“Ambition”, The third Colombians produced track on the album is on some real G shit, hands down. “Ambition” is followed by the most powerful track on this project, “Angel in the Alleyway” – Another story telling track, apparently based on a true story. Production by John Doe. Fire. Gab certainly resembles Pac on this one – emotion, presence, flow.\n\nFinally, closing out the album, “Mama If” – featuring a superb singer, Solo, who absolutely slaughters the chorus. This song is a beautiful ode to Gab’s mother who sadly passed away (Our condolences brother). Gab even flashes some Spanish hip-hop lyrics on this track. A beautiful way to end this solid project."
