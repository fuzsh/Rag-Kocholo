        "text": "The Great Gatsby (2013)\n\nThe last time I sat in the cinema being awed by the scale and sheer enormity of a film production was in Les Miserables and The Great Gatsby was no different. It has all the glittering elements of other iconic Baz Luhrmann films like Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge, but on a colossal budget.\n\nDespite its sheer magnitude, the whole film reminded me of an intimate broadway play, each new setting – Gatsby’s waterfront mansion, the industrial wasteland called the ‘valley of ashes’ and bustling Wall Street – it’s own microcosm of the great city of New York.\n\nWatching this film is like drinking a strong, exotic cocktail and the viewer is swung head first into Gatsby’s mysterious and elusive world of constant parties and skyrocketing financial success. But through clever scripting and characterisation of the film’s focaliser Nick Carroway, the audience’s sanity is held intact, as they see this illustrious world through his shrewd eyes, unaccustomed to the habits of high society.\n\nNick moves from the Midwest to New York in 1922, at the beginning of the golden Jazz Age, when stock markets boomed, and morals were flung by the wayside. Accidentally choosing a cottage next door to the notorious millionare, Jay Gatsby, Nick is soon attending one of the outlandish and decadent parties that Gatsby throws every weekend. Nick is awed by the people he meets at this party, “enchanted by the inexhaustible variety of life.” (My favourite quote from the film).\n\n“Large parties are so intimate,” murmurs a famous sportswoman in Carroway’s ear. “At small parties there’s no privacy at all.”\n\nThese parties – described as a “kaleidoscopic circus” are Baz Luhrmann’s artistic strength, full of glittering costumes, garish makeup, sweeping camera angles and, yes, modern hip hop music.\n\nAt first I was shocked by party-goers doing the jitter bug to music by Jay-Z and Beyonce, expecting the whole soundtrack to pay homage to the jazz sound of the 1920s. But gradually I became accustomed to Luhrmann’s choice of music and I began to like it. It positioned the whole film in a timeless era where, regardless of society, technology or modernism, people are essentially the same.\n\nLuhrmann demonstrates an ability to draw stark and clever juxtapositions in this film, between Gatsby’s enigmatic parties and his ever-retreating self, between Gatsby’s confidence in business dealings and his endearing awkwardness when meeting his childhood sweetheart, Daisy Buchanan, after five years of separation.\n\nThe latter scene is perhaps my favourite scene in the film, full of charm, humour and a sweet ‘girl-next-door’ familiarity outside the glittering, obscure worlds that Gatsby occupies.\n\nGatsby asks Nick if he can invite his beautiful cousin, Daisy Buchanan (who lives across the bay) to his cottage for tea, whereby Gatsby plans to ‘drop by’ unexpectedly. Leonardo Di Caprio is flawless in this scene, paired perfectly with the delightful Carey Mulligan (who has been one of my favourite actresses for some years now!) Baz Luhrmann’s direction is evident in the quirkiness and eccentricity of Gatsby, who transforms the rundown cottage into a manicured, scrubbed and pristine property and overcrowds the tiny house with huge vases of foamy white flowers, much to the helpless bemusement of Nick.\n\nThis film is full of the high-life of drunken parties, scandal and gorgeously delicate costumes. Yet is remarkably sober at times, when Gatsby speaks of his desire to love Daisy, to do things the ‘right way’ instead of eloping. He is so hopeful that she will leave her overbearing husband and they will one day be reunited.\n\nNick describes Gatsby as the ‘most hopeful man he ever knew.’ Yet again, Luhrmann juxtaposes this with a hope that is obscured by ‘blindness’ and an assumption that, because everything else in his life can be summoned at the touch of a button, Daisy can too. Gatsby’s blind hopefulness becomes ludicrous as he fails to see imminent disaster approaching in the final scenes of the film, because he is blinded by his love for Daisy.\n\nThere have been many Gatsby films. I haven’t seen all of them, but like each new adaptation has done before, Baz Luhrmann’s brings an original and fresh twist to the much-loved story. This film is excellent, dazzling and extremely worthy of five stars. There is so much more I could have written, but I won’t. I’ll just let those of you who are yet to see it enjoy the deliciously decadent Gatsby/Luhrmann concoction.\n\n~ GK"
