        "text": "Original ATLien André 3000 is going deep into the void in the new trailer for director Claire Denis’ sci-fi thriller High Life. The movie about a group of convicts who are tricked into a voyage through space into a black hole with the promise of freedom stars Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche. In the preview, a morose Pattinson is heard in voiceover describing the epic, lonely trip into the outer reaches of the galaxy, during which the convicts undergo shady sexual experiments.\n\nThe rapper (credited by his real name, André Benjamin) is briefly seen tending to a garden and providing Binoiche’s doctor with a sample amid images of Pattinson wandering around the ship and describing the mission to capture the black hole’s dark energy. The film marks Benjamin’s first trick back to the big screen in a major role since his 2013 break-out lead performance as guitar god Jimi Hendrix in the biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side.\n\nThe film is slated to open in the U.S. in 2019. Check out the trailer below."
