In 2015, he produced the Oscar-nominated film \"Straight Outta Compton\" alongside Ice Cube.\n\nThe Grammy-winning superproducer is worth about $800 million, according to Forbes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNas' debut album \"Illmatic,\" released in 1994, was an instant classic.\n\n\"Nearly 20 years after its release, Nas' debut album still looms large over hip-hop,\" Rob Kenner wrote for Complex. \"Aside from exerting a profound influence over an entire generation of rappers, Nas' rhymes are studied as serious literature in universities around the world.\"\n\nWidely considered one of the best MCs of all time, Nas went on to release three more solo albums and one joint album with The Firm before the end of the decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNas released his 11th studio album in 2018.\n\n\"Nasir,\" the rapper's first album in six years, debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 — making it his 12th top 10 album.\n\nNas has also dabbled in film and TV. Most recently, he served as an executive producer for \"Gully Boy,\" a 2019 Hindi-language musical drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnoop Dogg rose to fame in 1992 after he was discovered by Dr. Dre.\n\nSnoop Dogg released his debut album \"Doggystyle\" in 1993, which became certified quadruple platinum the following year.\n\nSnoop Dogg was recently awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nMore recently — beyond releasing his 17th studio album, \"I Wanna Thank Me,\" in 2019 — the longtime rap legend has broadened his horizons. The third season of VH1's surprise hit show \"Martha & Snoop,\" which he co-hosts with Martha Stewart, premiered in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIce Cube is known as one of the founding artists of \"gangsta rap.\"\n\nIce Cube initially rose to fame in the '80s as a member of the hip-hop group C.I.A. He later became renowned for his lead role in the group N.W.A. alongside Dr. Dre and Eazy E.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a successful solo career, Ice Cube transitioned into film and entrepreneurship.\n\nAfter his starring role in the 1991 film \"Boyz n the Hood,\" Ice Cube wrote and starred in the \"Friday\" film series. He has since starred in films like \"Barbershop,\" \"Ride Along,\" \"Are We There Yet?\" and \"21 Jump Street.\"\n\nIce Cube recently founded the BIG3, a three-on-three basketball league, which primarily enlists retired NBA players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMissy Elliott launched her solo career in 1997.\n\nMissy Elliott's debut solo album \"Supa Dupa Fly\" became, at the time, the highest charting debut for a female rapper, with it initially landing at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. She became known for infectious hits like \"Get Ur Freak On,\" \"Lose Control,\" and \"Work It.\"\n\nElliott was awarded MTV's prestigious Video Vanguard Award in 2019.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report from Billboard, Elliott has sold more than 30 million records in the US alone. She has won four Grammy Awards and recently became the first female rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRedman was the \"premier party rapper\" of the '90s.\n\nNo rapper was \"as consistent throughout the decade as Redman,\" wrote Complex's David Drake. \"If a single word could describe his output, it was fun.\"\n\nRedman released his debut solo album, \"Whut? Thee Album,\" in 1992 — but Drake argued that he peaked with 1996's \"Muddy Waters.\" Redman also began teaming up with Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man in 1995 and found massive success with their 1995 song \"How High.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRedman performed at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nTo celebrate the VMA's new home in Newark, New Jersey, local icons closed the show with a medley of their classic hits — including Redman's 1999 single \"Da Rockwilder\" from his joint album with Method Man, \"Blackout.\"\n\nRedman released a new single called \"Black Man in America\" in September. He's also the host of VH1's reality show \"Scared Famous,\" which began airing in 2017. It has yet to be canceled or renewed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon the 1996 release of his debut album, Jay-Z emerged as one of the rap greats.\n\nJay-Z founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995 ahead of releasing his debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt.\"\n\nHis musical prowess arguably hit its peak with his sixth and eighth solo projects, \"The Blueprint\" and \"The Black Album,\" in 2001 and 2003.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJay-Z is now known as a mogul and husband as much as a rapper.\n\nIn 2002, Jay-Z began collaborating with his now-wife, Beyoncé. They tied the knot in 2008 and released a joint album, \"Everything Is Love,\" a decade later.\n\nIn addition to his roles as husband and father (Jay-Z and Beyoncé share three young children), the 50-year-old mogul has been focused on building his portfolio as a businessman. He recently made history as the first rapper to become a billionaire, according to Forbes.\n\nRead more: Jay-Z is hip-hop's first billionaire.
