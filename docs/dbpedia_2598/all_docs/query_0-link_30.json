        "text": "A look at three styles of African music and how they changed their nations.\n\nThe Cat Empire are taking us around the world of music for the next five weeks as they host Double J's Artist In Residence.\n\nThis week, band members DJ Jumps and Harry James Angus kick things off with songs from West Africa.\n\nTo mark this event, we're bringing you a quick guide to three West African genres, and exploring how this music affects politics, culture, and everyday life in unique ways.\n\nBRING THE NOISE\n\nSenegalese musician Lamine Sonko says the way Australia uses music came as something of a shock to him. The streets are quiet, unlike in his homeland where music is omnipresent.\n\n\"I do miss that,\" says Sonko, who has been in Australia for the past ten years working as a musician and teaching Australians about West African music.\n\n\"When I came here it was a big cultural shock to hear less music, walk around the street and see all the boundaries, you cannot really play outdoors without a permit and all those things.\n\n\"It's definitely different to where I come from, in Senegal you walk on the street you hear drums and music everywhere. People use it to express themselves and tell their stories.\"\n\nThat musical culture has branched out in different areas, and three particular genres – highlife, afrobeat, and desert blues – demonstrate how important music can be in West Africa.\n\nHIGHLIFE\n\nJerry Hansen &amp; The Ramblers Dance Band\n\nHighlife music developed in Ghana at the beginning of the 20th century and spread through much of West Africa in the ensuing decades.\n\nHighlife took traditional West African music and melded it with brass-band music, jazz and Latin guitar. It gained enormous cultural significance, particularly in its home nation, as it wasn't just a form of entertainment. This music was also a way for people to communicate on a personal level, and so it became a vital political tool.\n\nThe Ghanaian Convention People's Party would use highlife music to attract people to their meetings. Much of the highlife music coming out of Ghana in the mid-late 1950s was pro-CPP and called on Ghanaian people to support President Kwame Nkrumah.\n\nIn 1957, President Nkrumah declared independence from European colonisation, making Ghana the first African nation to do so. \"We are going to see that we create our own African personality and identity,\" he announced in his famous declaration speech. President Nkrumah made highlife the official dance music of Ghana, but with this came changes to the style. He requested that bands make the music \"more Ghanian\", adopt a regular tempo, and standardise dance steps to go with the music.\n\nIn 1966, a coup d'etat saw Nkrumah's government lose power. This event, plus the rise of soul music, meant highlife music lost popularity in Ghana. What had been an imperative part of West African culture became just a memory to its middle-aged people.\n\nBut in the 1990s, young Ghanaian artists began to experiment with melding highlife and hip hop styles to make hiplife music. A decade later, traditional highlife music also underwent a resurgence. Today, both highlife and hiplife continue to be popular.\n\nFELA KUTI: AFROBEAT\n\nPowerful figures in Africa continue to use music as a highly effective publicity tool. In late 1960s Nigeria, music commissioned by political leaders was commonplace. A popular band would perform a song that praised the person of power and, in turn, the person would pay them handsomely. It's a practice that continues to this day.\n\nFela Kuti resisted this practice, instead brazenly speaking out against injustice in Nigeria. This is what made him so important, as well as the heavily percussive, complex, funky and primal style of music he developed, known as afrobeat.\n\n\"In Africa, musicians can easily be corrupted by the government, especially if they're known or people like their music, they can easily be corrupted by the government giving them money,\" says Lamine Sonko.\n\n\"Fela didn't choose that path – he could have easily chosen that path – but he stood up and got all those issues that were happening in the community out there. Not just in Nigeria but all of Africa. It's something that a lot of people admire him for that.\n\n\"Living in Senegal we get to hear lots of Fela's music. That helps a lot during hard times, political problems that happen in the community. We listen to Fela's music to get our heads up and continue knowing what is our right and make sure we have the freedom to express ourselves.\"\n\nA fan of Koola Lobitos - Kuti's first band - bankrolled their trip to Los Angeles in 1969, which ultimately spelled the end of the band but the beginning of afrobeat music as we know it.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Kuti met Sandra Isidore, who would become both his lover and his cultural mentor. Isidore, a Black Panther, opened Kuti up to the work of Malcolm X and encouraged him to embrace his African identity.\n\nEqually important in Kuti's musical rebirth was fellow Nigerian musician Ambrose Campbell. It was Campbell's work that inspired Kuti to incorporate African chant into his new hybrid of funk, highlife and heavily rhythmic African music.\n\n\"As someone who studied traditional music, listening to Fela really helped me to know how to really translate the tradition into a modern sound and try and invite new listeners to come and get another essence of what African music is all about,\" Lamine Sonko says.\n\nKuti became increasingly subversive as his career went on. In the 1981 documentary Music Is A Weapon, Kuti said he felt he needed his art to proclaim the struggle of the Nigerian people.\n\n\"Yes, if you're England, you sing of enjoyment,\" he said. \"You sing of love or... who you're going to bed with next. But my society is underdeveloped because of an alien system imposed on my people. So there's no music for enjoyment, for love, when there's such a struggle for people's existence.\n\n“So, as an artist, politically, artistically, my whole idea about my environment must be represented in the music, in the arts. So art is what's happening in a particular time of people's development or underdevelopment. Music must awaken people to do their duty as citizens and act.\"\n\nTUAREG DESERT BLUES\n\nBombino\n\nThe music of the Tuareg people, from the deserts of North Africa, has become popular recently thanks largely to the music of Mali's Tinariwen and Niger's Bombino (pictured).\n\nThe Tuareg people have a chequered history with the governments of the African countries they inhabit. Rebellions in 1962-63, 1990-95, 2007-09 and 2012 were brutally violent as insurgents sought to establish independence from existing governments\n\nFor Artist In Residence, The Cat Empire have chosen to play a song by Niger band Etran Finatawa. They became friends with the band years ago at a Canadian festival. The next time they were supposed to meet, the African group didn't show - they were tied up in a war in their homeland. To some West African governing bodies, music is considered a weapon so guitars are outlawed and bands exiled.\n\n\"This music is not at all traditional,\" Harry James Angus says. \"The guitar was banned in Niger by the controlling government of the last few years, because it was a symbol of rebellion. A lot of these North African guitar bands were exiled for three or four years because guitars were illegal. Then they all went back to fighting this Tuareg rebellion. They went into Timbuktu, allegedly with Al Qaeda, and then the French commandos came in... it was just a whole big mess.\"\n\nOmar \"Bombino\" Moctar is enjoying the greatest success of his career so far, drawing huge crowds around the world after the release of his album Nomad, produced by Dan Auerbach. In an interview with theMusic last year, the 34-year-old explained how music could be dangerous in Niger.\n\n\"There were a few times in my life where I had to hide myself because I was a musician,” Bombino said. “The musicians are threatening to people who wish to hold power because music has a strong influence over people. So it's better sometimes to stay out of sight if you wield this power.\"\n\nThe music of Africa, from the highlife of the early 1900s to the blazing guitar in Bombino's 2013 psychedelic blues, is hugely powerful. Not just in the musical sense, but in the way it is used as cultural expression - and repression - in a sometimes tumultuous political environment."
