        "text": "“Plan B” - Megan Thee Stallion\n\nMegan Thee Stallion has become a modern-day feminist icon for a number of reasons, including her work ethic, sex-positive swagger, and refusal to stay silent when faced with hate spewed from both the public and her Hip-Hop peers. With “Plan B,” the Houston hottie channeled her frustration with under-achieving, yet cocksure men into a song aimed at an ex who lives to regret his mistreatment of the star, obviously pulling from her own experiences with various suitors who fumbled the bag.\n\nDebuting the song during the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Meg caused a stir within the culture just minutes after hitting the stage that April night, as footage of the 5’10” rapstress commanding the massive crowd while spitting venom at an unnamed target took hold on social media.\n\nOfficially dropping a week later as the second single from 2022 album, Traumazine, the Jodeci-sampled track Meg claimed was “very mother**king personal,” became an anthem for women looking to vicariously stunt on their own exes through the Grammy winner, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Song Chart.\n\nThe boom-bap feel of the record engaged classic Hip-Hop fans while the incendiary nature of her bars satisfied a gossip-craving public, as well as blogs pondering just who exactly the southern MC was calling a “bi**h” on the song’s vulgarly empowering hook.\n\nMany believed it to be Tory Lanez, thanks to their legal issues. She has since confirmed that several exes crossed her mind when pen met the pad, the same going for Hip-Hop veteran Lil Kim, who hopped on the official remix to take her own exes to the task – despite what some others believed at the time.\n\nWhile “Plan B” doesn’t have the high-gloss appeal of tracks like the Vogue-influenced “HER,” and the Dua Lipa-assisted “Sweetest Pie,” the old-school elements she embraced on the record make it a stand-out on an album that is otherwise quite redundant. It escapes the sexual gimmickry of tracks like the Future-assisted “Pressurelicious” while still embracing grown woman bars that are undeniably real, raw, and unapologetic, guaranteeing it a spot on this list of 2022’s best Hip-Hop songs. — Jessica “Compton” Bennett\n\n\"First Class\" - Jack Harlow\n\n“First Class” is a clear indication that Jack Harlow ascended to new heights. Not only does he enjoy the finer things in life, but he’s bringing a lady on the way. Flipping Fergie’s 2000s jam “Glamorous,” the Louisville rapper spits “I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A-M).” Despite this new status, he still has naysayers on his mind with lines like “Back in 2019, I was outside freely/ But now they got it out for me/ I don’t care what frat that you was in, you can’t alpha me/ Keep dreamin'” and “Why do y’all sleep on me? I need reasons.”\n\nThrough the triumphs and insecurities, the 25-year-old asserts that he was called to rap, and wants others to have the same confidence. It’s warranted, as this record debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. “I got plaques in the mail, peak season/ Shout out to my UPS workers makin’ sure I receive ’em/ You can do it too, believe it.” Call it bubble gum rap or pop, but the impact here earns him a spot on this list. — Armon Sadler\n\n\"Munch (Feelin' U)\" - Ice Spice\n\nIce Spice‘s “Munch (Feelin’ U)” exhibited the value of coming up with lingo that people will want to repeat. Flipping the colloquial term “eater,” the Bronx drill rapper displays how women can have men bending at their will. “You thought I was feelin’ you? That ni**a a munch/ Ni**a a eater, he ate it for lunch/ Bi**h, I’m a baddie, I get what I want like,” the 23-year-old asserts. Spice also takes aim at women she believes can’t compare to her: “Bi**hes ain’t bad, let’s keep it a bean/ Know they be mad that I be on the scene/ A** too fat, can’t fit in no jeans/ You was my stitch but it’s not what it seam.”\n\nShe combines sex appeal and a fiery attitude over this one-minute 44-second jam, branding a raspy voice that is unforgettable. Though songs like “No Clarity” and “Bikini Bottom” have gained the young star popularity, it is “Munch” that was her formal introduction to the music scene. As the song continues to dominate social media, with over half a million TikTok creations and 28 million streams on Spotify, Ice Spice is primed for an even better 2023. Because, as she says, she gets what she wants. — A.S.\n\n\"BILLIE EILISH.\" - Armani White\n\nPhiladelphia’s Armani White has been rapping since 2017 but hadn’t gained widespread acknowledgment until the release of the viral song “Billie Eillish.” Titled after the award-winning pop singer, the track includes a clear-cut sample of N.O.R.E’s 2002 “Nothin’.”\n\nThe beat awakens memories of oversized tees under even bigger jerseys, tongues hanging from Timberland boots and fitted caps cocked low. Not soon after, the lyrics bring you back to the reality that you’re listening to an artist born in 1996. Although less lyrical than most songs on this list, “Billie Eilish” has both replay value and popularity. The catchy, clever chorus sticks around in your mind long after the number’s done.\n\nWhite raps, “Bi**h, I’m stylish/ Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish.” Eilish, the pop artist, hasn’t exactly responded to the song, besides sharing a few TikToks with it playing in the background. However, N.O.R.E was fully supportive of the record as he joined Armani for a performance on the 2022 BET Hip-Hop Awards stage.\n\nThe single rose to popularity through TikTok and other popular video apps and even transversed the social media world, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. — Amber Corrine\n\n\"Walkin (Key Glock Remix)” - Denzel Curry\n\nOn the remix to “Walkin,” Denzel Curry enlists Key Glock, as both rappers lyricize about what drives their tenacity. Issued in June 2022, the original track is featured on the Florida-bred rapper’s fifth studio LP Melt My Eyez See Your Future.\n\n“I reached out to Glock because I felt like he’s the perfect example of ‘Walkin.’ Based on everything he been through, and also being independent, it hasn’t stopped his grind. I’ve always been a fan of Memphis Hip-Hop so it just felt right,” Curry explained in a statement when the remix was revealed.\n\nNixing the original version’s slower intro, the remix begins with the song’s motivational hook. The Kal Banx-produced track allows both Glock and Curry to take on a “dirty filthy rotten nasty little world,” showcasing their individual skills and perfectly juxtaposing two different perspectives of the same grind.\n\nDenzel Curry’s rhymes are the same focused, fiery bars in the original version of the song. He reflects on coping with life’s ups and downs—through smoking a blunt or tearing up in therapy. Key Glock follows up, declaring his “Momma gave birth to a boss.” While he magnifies his existence, the Memphis rapper does not forget his storied journey to the top. — DeMicia Inman\n\n“The Highs & The Lows” - Chance The Rapper Feat. Joey Bada$$\n\nSince Chance the Rapper’s critically-panned 2019 album The Big Day, he’s spent his time slowly and steadily working his way back into Hip-Hop’s consciousness. While his 2016 Coloring Book campaign was loaded with major endorsements and press perks, his work this year has had an artsier approach: loosie singles and videos featuring artwork from local and international artists.\n\nThe best of those 2022 efforts was “The Highs & The Lows,” a song that captures the earnestness that fueled Chance’s superstar run between 2013 and 2016. Over a sped-up soul sample and a thumpy bassline, Chance uses solid bar work and his signature warm singing vocals to illustrate how he navigates the peaks and valleys of life. While Chance’s verse ends with him relying on his vices, collaborator Joey Badass revisits his personal experiences before giving a bit of advice. “Got so used to feedback, I couldn’t tell what mines is,” Joey recalls. “Sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us.”\n\nWhether it’s a song about dealing with a fickle music industry or just rolling with the punches of life, it’s the sort of day-to-day music that can serve as a shoulder to lean on during a rough patch, or in good times, as a gentle reminder of what you’ve already overcome. If Chance can keep providing soundtrack raps like this in 2023, he’ll be back on top before anyone expects it. — William E. Ketchum III\n\n\"Do We Have A Problem?\" - Nicki Minaj Feat. Lil Baby\n\n“I just told P this really ni**as worst nightmare,” Nicki Minaj signals to Quality Control CEO Pierre “P” Thomas on “Do We Have A Problem?” It was the green light to wake up the lyrical talents of Lil Baby. The Atlanta rapper joined the Queens Hip-Hop veteran for the collaborative warning to any potential beef.\n\nIssued in February 2022, the Queens-bred Barbie ended her solo hiatus with the anticipated single. The song peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and stands out as a collaborative effort, as both artists deliver complimentary styles and themes.\n\nWhile Minaj channels her melodic rap skills for the track’s declarative hook, her most impressive offering on the song comes in the first verse. Minaj’s inflection on the simple line “Hold up, shorty, hold up, bit*h,” sets the tone for pending flow switches, metaphors, and boasts.\n\nLil Baby—who often likens himself to this generation’s Lil Wayne—can add keeping up with the “Chun Li” rapper to his Weezy F. Baby checklist. True to his brand, the 28-year-old runs through bars about opps that “don’t do sh*t,” his and hers designer clothing, and sexual exploits. — D.I.\n\n\"The Heart Part 5\" - Kendrick Lamar\n\nRap’s poet laureate Kendrick Lamar returned after five years to reclaim his seat on the Iron Throne with “The Heart Part 5.” The final installment in the “Heart” series and the hors d’oeuvres for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers provides listeners with an update on Lamar’s outlook.\n\nDrawing from the unsettling inner-city narratives of his past and the social upheaval of the present day, the emcee skillfully paints trauma. He weaves in and out of lyrical complexities and unfortunate truths about discrimination and internalized hatred, conspicuously switching flows and matching shifting perspectives.\n\nIn the song’s accompanying video, Kendrick uses deep fake technology to transform into icons such as Will Smith, Kobe Bryant, Nipsey Hussle, and Kanye West to illustrate the depth of collective Black trauma. Each face strategically appears to perform a verse from the track that coincides with their viewpoints. “The Heart Part 5” is a lyrical and visual marvel, and caught the Recording Academy’s attention. K. Dot’s single snagged five nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, Best Music Video, and Record of the Year. — M.A.G.\n\n\"Bars Into Captions\" - Quavo And Takeoff\n\nPress play on “Bars Into Captions,” and you’re immediately brought back to the onset of the millennium when Outkast dropped Stankonia’s “So Fresh, So Clean.” Twenty-two years later, Quavo and Takeoff employed the certified Platinum mega-hit for their Only Built For Infinity Links’ single “Bars Into Captions.”\n\nWith extra drums, “Bars into Captions” gives the smooth sounds of “So Fresh, So Clean” a modern-day Atlanta bounce. Like Andre 3000 and Big Boy, Quavo and Takeoff take turns trading braggadocious moments. Qua raps, “Won’t catch me lackin’/ I put that sh*t on lil’ ni**a, this that real fashion,” as Take recites the line, “Brand new AP straight out the factory/ When I’m on stage, and at my shows, bi**hes, they grabbin’ me.”\n\nThe “Unc & Phew” duo exchange energies as they ad-lib each other’s bars, highlighting their undeniable chemistry on the Buddah Bless-beat. On “Bars Into Captions,” Takeoff truly stepped into the spotlight showcasing his lyrical ability — making this track a staple in Take’s best verses ever. Unfortunately the 28-year-old was shot and killed by stray bullets on Nov. 1 while visiting a bowling alley in Houston, TX.\n\nHe and Quavo’s “Bars Into Captions” hails from their first and last joint project as a duo, which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200. — A.C.\n\n\"Neck & Wrist\" - Pusha T Feat. Jay-Z And Pharrell Williams\n\nThe pairing of two supreme lyricists usually culminates in a grand musical spectacle. This was the case upon the unveiling of Pusha T‘s track “Neck & Wrist,” on which he trades verses with fellow coke-rap connoisseur Jay-Z. Resuming where they last parted on their 2016 effort “Drug Dealers Anonymous,” the Brooklyn Don and Virginia’s favorite rhyme distributor give jewelry appraisals while dropping coded couplets referencing their alleged reign as kingpins. Renowned for his dedication in providing nuanced glimpses into the underworld, Pusha T revels in the role of shedding light on the clandestine aspects of the drug trade. Boasting “Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narcos” atop a soundscape crafted by producer and costar Pharrell Williams, the 45-year-old kicks clever allusions to the trappings gleaned from his illicit dealings.”\n\nAccustomed to settling scores and responding to slights on wax, Hov opens his stanza and gives his two cents on actor Faizon Love’s skepticism over the validity of his history as a drug merchant. “The phase I’m on, love, I wouldn’t believe it either,” he scoffs, playing off the thespian’s name for added effect. Hov also challenges the theory that The Notorious B.I.G.’s death was a catalyst for him reaching his own stardom and legendry. His verse proves his ears are as attuned to the tweets as they are to the streets. — Preezy Brown\n\n\"We Go Up\" - Nicki Minaj Feat. Fivio Foreign\n\nThis spring, three popular female rap acts dropped nearly consecutive iterations of their skills over drill beats: Nicki Minaj’s “We Go Up,” City Girls’ “Top Notch” and Cardi B’s appearance on Kay Flock’s “Shake It.” For once, a golden opportunity presented itself to engage in relevant comparison.\n\nEach rapper achieved flows complementary to sliding 808s and dancing hi-hats. All three songs have copious amounts of explicit and sometimes clever shit-talking. All three videos featured fire looks, and two of them featured wigs that signified a b*tch in throwback form. Fivio Foreign appears on two of the songs, both of which have bars comparing oral sex to consuming frozen treats. But only one song placed its leading lady front-and-center for nearly three minutes to hold her own for two verses and a hook. Only one rapper’s lyrics and delivery achieve the hilarity of “I know them tea-baggin’ b****s is tesssss-ty.” And only one was re-applying pressure after two years of relative silence.\n\nThese days, most admissions of Nicki Minaj’s iconic status are murmured through gritted teeth. But 2023 proved the facts might just have the power to outweigh opinions—if her prowess for making music can advance to the center of the conversation. — Iyana Robertson\n\n\"Silent Hill\" – Kendrick Lamar Feat. Kodak Black\n\nAs Compton rap savior Kendrick Lamar grows into his veteran status, he’s managed to be a guiding force for the younger generation of rap stars growing in their own superstardom, including the always controversial and enduring Florida boy, Kodak Black. “Silent Hill” from K. Dot’s critically acclaimed Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers is a testament to the chemistry and mutual respect the two have developed over the years, despite being in slightly different musical lanes and generations of Hip-Hop.\n\nKendrick and Kodak lyrically ride out on a vibrant and smooth 808-backed production from the collective efforts of Beach Noise, Jahaan Sweet, Boi-1da & Sounwave. As if they were gliding over a glossy, smoked-out rainbow, the pair effortlessly trade bars about the price of fame and fake friends with a Chris Paul and Devin Booker-like chemistry. And with the controversies and allegations of sexual assault that Black has been linked to over the years, it is easy to forget that he too is one of rap’s top-tier, young wordsmiths. Hear the rhyme scheme in his verse, where he spits, “The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals/ I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin’ sh*t out in the cubicle/ Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot/ Big ol’ ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bi**h look like a Ring Pop.” This in tandem with K. Dot’s own smooth, sing-songy melodies is what makes “Silent Hill” one of the best rap collaborations this year.“\n\nSilent Hill” is currently clocking in at less than 92 million streams on Spotify and was a hit across the Billboard charts. It’s reaching no. 51 on the Year End R&B and Hip Hop chart, no. 49 on the Year End Rhythmic chart, no. 5 on the Hot Hip Hop and R&B Chart, and #7 on the Hot 100 and Rhythmic charts, respectively. For all parties involved, a win is a win. — Mark Braboy\n\n“God Did” - DJ Khaled Feat. Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, John Legend, And Fridayy\n\nAt this point in his career, every Jay-Z verse feels like a larger-than-life event. He’s got so many constant business and philanthropic moves that when he steps into the booth, he either has a specific message to share or wants to give his stamp to an artist who deserves it. But either way, the rap world stops whenever he has something to say on wax.\n\nHis contribution to “God Did” was gassed up for weeks by Khaled himself and Jay’s longtime engineer Young Guru as being one of his best verses ever, and while hype can certainly make for wacky expectations, the result is still special. Jay-Z spends four minutes revisiting his long list of successes, celebrating what he’s had to overcome, and shouting out the friends and collaborators who have accompanied him along the way — with plenty of punchlines, double entendres, and obscure street references throughout. Of course, there are moments of boastfulness and opulence (“these ain’t songs, these are hymns, cuz I’m Him,” he slyly sneers); it’s Hov, after all. But the verse is mostly rooted in gratitude and reflection, like a celebratory alternative to the ruminative mood of 4:44. We’ve seen Jay reach such incredible heights, it’s easy to forget just how unlikely his road to the top actually was. But here, it sounds like he’s just as in touch with that journey nearly 30 years after he entered the industry. “Sh*t is too much how we grew up,” he raps. “Sh*t don’t even feel real to us.”\n\nOnly DJ Khaled can turn legitimately dope verses from Rick Ross and Lil Wayne into small plates ahead of an epic main course of a Hov manifesto, but Khaled has always been able to capture the moment. — W.E.K.\n\n\"Sunshine\" - Latto Feat. Lil Wayne And Childish Gambino\n\nLatto‘s successful year was fueled by the success of “Big Energy,” but her album 777 included a gem in “Sunshine” featuring Lil Wayne and Childish Gambino. The generational clash made for an animated lyrical display, but more impressive was the 23-year-old’s melodic ability. “Pray for my enemies, Lord, I need clarity/ They ain’t got empathy for me, they stare at me/ They used my couch when they needed the therap / Took what they needed but never took care of me/ They saw a dollar sign, treat me like currency/ Kill all they hopes and dreams if they want murder me/ Sunshine on me,” she half-sings, half-raps in the chorus.\n\nInstead of an expected reference to Stevie Wonder’s blindness, Latto went for a triple entendre: “These ni**as Stevie to the come up/ Went got my bread up, let ’em wonder.” Lil Wayne jumps in, showing just how aware he is of what’s happening around him with a nod to Devin Booker and a Will Smith Oscars slap reference. “This Siggy get jiggy with ni**as/ Don’t make me Will Smith me a ni**a,” he rapped.\n\nChildish Gambino offered the proper closing, reminding us all of what he can do rap-wise when motivated. He delivers shapeshifting flows with bars like: “I love when it’s sunny, that boy ain’t no dummy/ I slide off a gummy, I heard I got money/ But still dressing bummy, I’m sweeter than honey/ I’m sweeter at rapping like what the f**k happened?/ Came back and he’s snapping, came back with a passion/ These ni**as was cappin’, they talkin’ on me, hmm.”\n\nBongoByTheWay provided the ideal canvas, and this trio produced a masterpiece. How can you not feel empowered? — A.S.\n\n\"What Happened To Virgil\" - Lil Durk Feat. Gunna\n\nThe who’s who of fashion and Hip-Hop mourned the loss of icon and cultural impresario Virgil Abloh back in November 2021. The Off-White creator abruptly died of cancer, shocking the world. As many of his peers expressed their condolences and shared memories of the 41-year-old, Lil Durk decided to dedicate a song to him called “What Happened To Virgil,” featuring Gunna.\n\nThe presumptions made by the song’s title sort of contradict what the single is all about, as the lyrics have little to do with Abloh. Instead, Durk mourns the late King Von and his older brother OTF DThang. The catchiness of the rhetorical chorus, “Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?” paired with the hard-hitting Chopsquad DJ beat is what gives the track its most replay value in 2022. In hindsight, the Chicagoan did release an accompanying Cole Bennet-directed visual that gives Abloh a meaningful tribute displaying production inspired by the creative’s work and life.\n\nOpening with a quote from Abloh, “Life is so short that you can’t waste even a day, subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do,” the visual homage to Abloh makes up for the song’s (addictive) simplicity. Durk appears in a replicated Off-White flagship store, recreating the moment Abloh’s products were replaced with flowers in memory of the brand’s founder. The video also shows off some of Abloh’s final projects — including Drake’s baby blue “Air Drake” jet and Louis Vuitton’s “Louis Dreamhouse” runway show at 2022 Paris Men’s Fashion Week.\n\nLil Durk’s vulnerable expressions of grief show the more sensitive side of the 30-year-old. With the many losses he has experienced, Durk doesn’t shy away from utilizing his words as therapy to decompress his heart and mind. Hailing from his seventh studio album 7220, the viral ear-worm peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100. — A.C.\n\n“Tomorrow 2” - GloRilla And Cardi B\n\nStanding as one of 2022’s biggest breakout acts, GloRilla certified her status as one of Hip-Hop’s next big stars. On “Tomorrow 2,” the Memphis talent calls on Cardi B to help prove she’s here to stay. The energetic song may as well be fighting words for anyone daring to square up. Lyrically, however, the two women don’t wait for their opponent to throw the first blow.\n\nInitially, the CMG signee released “Tomorrow” on the label’s compilation album Gangsta Art, in July. “Just like the air, I’m everywhere. How you say, it’s up with me” echoes Glorilla’s voice as the song begins. Once the beat drops on the menacing instrumental, the 23-year-old begins her gritty verse.\n\nThe Grammy Award-nominated rapper reminds listeners that her homegrown, hood tendencies have yet to fade as her platform elevates. As her peers are rhyming about Birkin bags and BBLs, Glo is authentic to her street style. The Southern musician shines brightest when she differentiates herself, with lyrics such as “She the type, the ni**a make her mad she go tweet somethin’. Me, I’m kinda ratchet still so I’m the type to beat somethin.’”\n\nPerhaps the best part of “Tomorrow 2” lies in the chorus. Big Glo raps “Every day the sun won’t shine, but that’s why I love tomorrow” as a hopeful expression of optimism.\n\nOn the remix, the Bronx Binderella brings the Macaroni Toni-produced track to the East Coast. Cardi B’s playful, provocative verse on “Tomorrow 2” is a career highlight. Lines such as “Fake bi**h, that’s why my friend fu**ed on your ni**a” are boosted by taunting adlibs that animate an already colorful rap verse. Cardi B’s stinging delivery is a reminder of what elevated the 30-year-old from a spirited social media and reality star to a Grammy Award-winning rapper on top of the game. — D.I.\n\n\"Diet Coke\" - Pusha T Feat. Kanye West\n\nWith his fouth studio album, Almost Dry, in contention for Rap Album of the year at the 2023 Grammys, Pusha T set the project’s run off with its first single, “Diet Coke.”\n\nThe menacing soundtrack, provided by longtime producing collaborator Ye, lays out how cascading piano keys that loop into infinity, a brooding bassline pulse and bone cracking snares can keep you entranced in dope dealing dramatics. Ye and Push have concocted a theme song for slinging illicit drugs, be it street pharmaceuticals, banging beats, savage rhymes and/or taking over various genres of money making avenues.\n\n“Yesterday’s price, is not today’s price!” That statement by rapper and now social media darling Fat Joe starts off the record and sets the tone for Push’s coke lines to unfurl. Even Joe’s alias “Joey Crack” gets the chopped up treatment as the latter part of the moniker is peppered by his voice throughout the track. It’s aggressive against the almost classical feel of the beat, but Push brings the listener in with his own vocal inflections and whispers, adding the cinematic imagery with his volume and vitriol about his former street profession. “Imaginary players ain’t been coached right/Master recipes under stove lights/The number on this jersey is the quote price/You ordered Diet Coke, that’s a joke, right?”\n\nIt’s a shame that Push’s best critically acclaimed work with Ye (and his founding producer Pharrell Williams who did the other half of Almost Dry, which is Push’s first Billboard 200 #1) is marred by his former Good Music label boss’ recent public rants. The tandem have built a strong duo exchange whether rapping together or with just Ye on the beat for over a decade. You can even feel the chemistry in the music video where the black and white spaciousness fits the stark music bed, while Ye Diddy bops and Pusha serves his snow sermon.\n\nThe single hits and one thing we will always get from Push, no matter who is behind the boards is a blizzard of brick bars that will be solid as a rock, but white as the driven snow.\n\n— Datwon Thomas\n\n\"London\" - Bia Feat. J. Cole\n\nOn “London,” Bia and J.Cole tapped into the UK grime sound to indulge in the overseas luxuries of life. “I’m in London, I like to go and shop at the mall/ Shop at the Prada, shop at the store/ Shop in the tropics, stop at Dior/ Louis Vuitton cover my toes/ Throw on my trousers, look at my bricks,” the 31-year-old raps with an English accent. Apologies in advance to Croc wearers, however. “Chrome Hearts socks in sandals/ Mans outside in Crocs in shambles (Damn)/ Please quick talk, no ramble,” she rapped. Ouch.\n\nThis song hit a new stratosphere when J. Cole popped in for his verse, going off for 32 bars about blowing an opp’s top off. Calling himself “volcanic,” likening himself to the Carmelo Anthony staring at Rihanna meme, and basking in wearing Balenciaga joggers with his own signature trainers. He even redeems Crocs and says he’ll rock them at the O2 Arena. Branding an English accent of his own, Cole gets into crazy wordplay with “Hopped out the drop, got the drop on an opp, now I’m opportunistic/ I like to shop in the District/ Coppin’ this, coppin’ that, I’m proper capitalistic, uh.” The most enjoyable aspect of this verse—a sure contender for the verse of the year—is the rare extent to which he brags.\n\n“Maybach tinted, ”Scuse me, sir, but ain’t that rented?’ / I’m offended, straight cash for my Benzes, we don’t pay back interest/ Aim at fences when I swing, pay respects and kiss my ring/ Even Elizabeth said I’m king, haha/ Why would I choose between this one or that one when I know that I can have both?/ I laugh at these rappers for cappin’/ I guess T.I.P. ain’t the only one out here with jokes.”\n\nCole is at his best when he abandons humility. — A.S.\n\n“Jimmy Cooks” – Drake Feat. 21 Savage\n\nUpon the first release of Drake’s 2022 surprise album Honestly, Nevermind, Hip-Hop fans had more than a few questions about the Canadian’s emphasis on dance records. While some understood his natural progression from songs like “One Dance” to the Jersey club and EDM-influenced tracks found on the album, others questioned how they would work their favorite’s latest release into their Hip-Hop heavy playlists.\n\nEnter 21 Savage, whose sole feature on Honestly, Nevermind provided Drizzy with his most successful single from the album with “Jimmy Cooks,” a title referencing Aubrey Graham’s evolution from his Degrassi: The Next Generation character Jimmy Brooks to an MC “cookin’ up ambition on a kitchen stove.”\n\nThis isn’t to downplay Drake’s role on his own record, as he does drop bars with his opening verse worth acknowledging, including clever references to J. Cole and the late DJ Kay Slay, a shout-out to big naturals, and some wordplay with the “Rico Suave” label that’s been attached to the part-time crooner‘s persona since his So Far Gone days.\n\nThings get dark, however – in the best way possible – when Savage hops on the song after the beat switches to a menacing, minor chord-filled trap record. Similar to Future on Drake’s Views cut “Grammys,” 21 establishes dominance on the latter half of the song, grabbing listeners ears with his playfully elongated phrasing of “p*ssyyyyyyyyy.”\n\nHe later twists his clever and cocky bars even further, with a mid-verse, 8-bar section of the rapper bending the ends of phrases like “stick-uuup” and “Blick uuup,” and shouting out “the boy” as his “twizzzin” while adding they’re, “the reason why the opps ain’t got no frizziends.”\n\nIt’s too catchy to deny and falls in line with a number of fire verses 21 has given fans throughout 2021 and 2022, including collabs with Tyler, The Creator and Pharrell (“Cash In Cash Out”), Gunna (“Thought I Was Playing”), and J. Cole (“m y . l i f e”).\n\nFor many, the record is a continuation of Drake and 21’s Certified Lover Boy collab “Knife Talk,” which makes perfect sense following Drizzy’s confirmation that the two albums, as well as their latest, Her Loss, are essentially a trilogy.\n\nIn fact, “Jimmy Cooks” served as an introduction of sorts to the aforementioned Her Loss album, which stirred up the culture – to say the least – upon its November 4th release, becoming the biggest Hip-Hop drop of 2022 with 404,000 records sold its first week, besting Kendrick Lamar who previously held the record (295,000) for Mr. Morale And The Big Steppers.\n\nEven without the follow-up, the track stands alone as one of the most loved by both artists. It’s undeniably a fan-favorite that remains the most successful song from Honestly, Nevermind and was Drake’s 11th No. 1 single, proving that when Jimmy cooks, he always has the right recipe. — J.C.B.\n\n\"Wait For U\" - Future Feat. Drake And Tems\n\n“Wait For U,” the latest joint effort from constant collaborators Drake and Future, is arguably near the top of this list. Its placement has a lot to do with rising star Tems, whose vocals are heard through a flip of her record “Higher.” The content she sings aligns with something the duo would probably tell a woman: “If the world was ending, would you cry or would you try to get me?/ Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah/ I will wait for you, for you.”\n\nFuture bats first, expressing his loyalty to a woman who prayed for his demons and sticks around despite the fact he can’t take her everywhere. “I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone/ Get mad at yourself ’cause you can’t leave me alone.” He knows that she should probably walk away, but she can’t.\n\nDrake follows up, expressing how the hustle and bustle of his career limit the time he can give to women. Where Hendrix played the person holding the power, the 6 God takes on the opposite role; he is being dragged along while his lover has a roster. “Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him?/ Made me shake his hand when y’all been f**king for a minute,” he raps. “Walk me off the plank because you know that I’m a swimmer/ Supposed to be your dawg, but you done put me in a kennel.” It’s like she knows he can handle the emotional torment, so she puts him through it.\n\nStill, the Toronto crooner knows the impact he’s had and accepts his subordinate fate. “You got better when you met me and that ain’t coincidental/ Tried to bring the best out you, guess I’m not that influential / Guess I’m not the one that’s meant for you.”\n\n“Wait For U” being in contention for song of the summer also speaks to its greatness; it is not the standard, high-energy record that usually claims the honor. What it lacks in anthemic nature, it makes up for in broadcasting the feelings many have after one too many mimosas at a day party. It may not be the song you necessarily want to hear, but it’s the song you need. — A.S.\n\n\"Super Gremlin\" - Kodak Black\n\nPledges of loyalty amidst the specter of betrayal are woven throughout this Kodak Black release, on which the Pompano Beach native morphs into a “Super Gremlin” while addressing the opps and backstabbers. Produced by ATL Jacob, the instrumental, powered by piano keys and booming percussion, conjures a ghastly vibe that’s accentuated by deep organ stabs and its infectious vocal sample. Lifted from “Errror” by German indie rock band How to Loot Brazil, the sped-up lyrics serve as the needle that threads the sonic tapestry together. The set serves as a refrain echoing Kodak’s lament of a promising alliance gone sour. “What is at stakes for us,” the rockers ask rhetorically, as if weighing the potential impact an impasse could have on either party.\n\nProclaiming his allegiance to his street family, the rapper conveys his sense of duty in his opening bars, vowing to go to the fullest extent to ensure the protection of his loved ones. “Say you my ni**a, I’ma be your killer/ Nobody gon’ play with you when I’m with you,” he raps, acknowledging his expectancy of the same code of conduct in return. Yet, honor amongst thieves (or snipers, in this case) can be fickle. The Atlantic Records signee makes this clear as he seemingly alludes to his past fallouts with former associates. “How you gon’ cross a ni**a that was rockin’ with you, I got you lit in the city,” Kodak questions, further disparaging his friend-turned-foe while threatening to commit bodily harm in light of their transgression.\n\nThe “Errror” sample borders on hypnotic and is the backbone of “Super Gremlin,” but the crux of Kodak’s performance arrives in the opening verse, which finds him playing to the underlying strength that is his melodic musings. Playing off of the sample’s lyrics, the 25-year-old adds a sinister twist, warning that his adversary’s duplicitous nature has burned a bridge that cannot be repaired. “Now, it’s not safe for you,” he croons before deadpanning, “You switched like a pu**y, lil’ bi**h.” Once the threats are issued, Kutthroatt Bill takes time to note his evolution from “cages to stages” and history of evading criminal convictions, flexing his lyrical dexterity in the process.\n\nPeaking at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, “Super Gremlins” was both a critical and commercial success. Achieving Platinum certification by the RIAA, the track also earned nominations for Favorite Song – Rap/Hip Hop at the 2022 American Music Awards and Best Song of the Year at this year’s BET Hip Hop Awards. As the biggest street anthem of the year, “Super Gremlins” has staying power and replay value that rivaled all of the Hip-Hop releases of this year; it will remain unforgettable for years to come. — P.B.\n\n\"Pushin P\" - Gunna Feat. Future And Young Thug\n\nIf “Pushin P” were a vehicle, Gunna pressed the gas on this 2022 single. The record, also featuring Young Thug and Future, debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the Atlanta rapper’s first time doing so in the chart’s Top 10. The fun two-minute and 16-second lyrical exercise eventually took on a life of its own, with blue emoji P’s appearing all over social media for the next month. Beyond the numbers and social media presence, it is also genuinely good rap.\n\nGunna and Future weave in and out of each other’s bars with an established collaborative rapport, making this effort seem easy. They also used an impressive amount of words beginning with the letter “P.”\n\n“Portuguese on her knees, moppin’ down the P/ She let me squeeze, then she lеave ’cause she keep it P/ Privatе suite, private seat, bi**h, I’m pushin’ P/ Purple pint, pu**y pink, bi**h, I’m pushin’ P.” Thugger slides on the record, apparently overwhelmed by the “P” use to the point where his next few bars are unintelligible. And then he spits “Okay, bought her a P, not a pill, a Porsche/ Three P’s, pop, pourin’, Porsches/ I just f**ked a cup of water / Pushin’ P, red bandana, Cardinals.”\n\nGunna, Future, and Young Thug have ascended above “mumble rapper” debates. While there may be no “conventional” message to this song, the flex is that they don’t need one. There is something to be said about making a good song with a unique quirk that is memorable and enjoyable. The ubiquitous, inescapable nature of this record tells the true story.\n\nGunna “pushed P” all the way to 2022’s NBA All-Star Weekend and the 2022 BET Hip Hop Awards’ cyphers. Now, “Pushin P” has been nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. The rapper also referenced the song in his letter from jail in June. “We still pushin’ P: Power, Prayer, Progress, Passion, Productivity, Praise, Precision, Peace, Prosperity, Patience, Pride and Persistence,” he wrote. Now that he’s been released, he may be able to celebrate his Grammy win(s) with his loved ones next year. — A.S.\n\n\"F.N.F. (Let's Go)\" - GloRilla\n\nThey say the most lethal blow is the one you don’t see coming. This logic supports GloRilla‘s ability to capture the attention of the rap world seemingly overnight. Though the Memphis native’s breakout single’s release was unassuming at first, “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” proved to be an artistic achievement of the highest order. Produced by fellow Memphis rep Hitkidd, the track finds GloRilla basking in the unbridled freedom that comes with self-fulfillment and having agency over one’s emotions. When Big Glo says that she’s “F-R-E-E, f**k ni**a free” in the first verse, the declaration isn’t of spite or malice, but one born out of the pride and self-respect she exudes throughout her travels and dealings.\n\nDevoid of lovelorn sentiments or regrets, “F.N.F.” finds the raptress extolling the joys of sisterhood while being young and carefree. It’s a state that’s been desired or experienced by women across all walks of life who’ve gravitated to the lyrics and ascribed to them like pages out of their own lives. While women exiting their cars to twerk in the middle of traffic was nothing new before the song’s release, the practice took flight thanks to TikTok’s #FNFChallenge. A southern belle with ratchet tendencies, GloRilla asserts herself as a man-eater more concerned with self-satisfaction than a romantic partner, a familiar theme prevalent in rap’s understated role in the female empowerment movement.\n\nWhen she rhymes, “Anyways, life’s great, pu**y still good,” it’s a quip that’s delivered with the nonchalance of a woman glowing in all of her splendor and making no apologies for her sexual confidence. While a number of songs have balked at the thought of a woman settling for the antics of a man deemed below their standards, such as TLC’s classic hit “No Scrubs,” “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” brings a fresh spin on the topic. In addition to its resonance with a nation of women, the track was dubbed by many to be one of the few true “unisex” rap anthems created by a female rapper in recent memory.\n\nWhile a segment of men may be conscious of singing along to tracks like Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B‘s “WAP” or other suggestively liberating anthems (see Lil Kim’s “Queen Bi**h”), just as many men could be heard chanting “Let’s go” as loud as their female counterparts. In a year filled with radio smashes, street bangers, and viral hits, “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” was the most inescapable rap record of the year and established GloRilla as both a heavy hitter and Hip-Hop’s latest cultural darling. — P.B."
