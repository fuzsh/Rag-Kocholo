        "text": "Lamar Hill began his first career on a central Harlem street corner, in the pre-MTV days of boomboxes and mix tapes. He and two pals, calling themselves Kool Moe Dee and Special K, recorded some of the earliest hip-hop records as the Treacherous Three. Wearing a T-shirt with an iron-on decal bearing his preferred name, L. A. Sunshine, he plugged his speakers into streetlight outlets to blast what was then a bold and unfamiliar new music, called rap.\n\nIt was 1978. Mr. Hill was 15.\n\nSitting in his Bronx apartment, Mr. Hill, now 50, looked more like a youthful librarian than a rap pioneer as he talked about the Treacherous Three’s early days and the uneasy journey that followed. His voice somehow combined an entertainer’s enthusiasm with a survivor’s weariness.\n\n“The neighborhood was proud to claim us as up-and-comers,” he remembered. “This powder keg known as hip-hop was bubbling and we thought we might be able to make some noise. Our turn was coming up.”\n\nBut Mr. Hill soon realized that the music business could be a tough place for a young man with trust issues, who was unprepared to deal with disloyal partners and predatory managers. It only intensified the depression that he had been battling since childhood.\n\n“The industry,” he said, “put me in a real dark space that I couldn’t find myself out of. I had breakdowns.”\n\nMr. Hill’s 2011 autobiography, “L.A. Sunshine: A True Story, The Real Accounts,” begins with a deeply unsettling recollection of sexual abuse at the hands of a babysitter when he was 7 years old. His mentally unstable father was an inconsistent presence in his life; his mother, a nurse’s aide, worked long hours to provide for her four sons. Mr. Hill said he started taking care of himself at age 12.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
