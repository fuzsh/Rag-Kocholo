Directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis, High Life is slated to involve a group of prisoners who shorten their stint by going on a mission to a black hole.\n\nAndre 3000 will star alongside Twilight‘s Robert Pattinson and actress Mia Goth as leads. Other actors will include Agata Buzek, Lars Eidinger, Jessie Ross, Ewan Mitchell, and Claire Tran. High Life will be filmed in Cologne, Germany.\n\nOf course, this isn’t 3000’s first major movie role. The Atlanta-native has appeared in Four Brothers, Jimi: All Is by My Side as Jimi Hendrix, and tv drama American Crime.\n\nPhoto credit: Gillette"
