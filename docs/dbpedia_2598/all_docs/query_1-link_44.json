After studying together at Dundee College they managed to fool the music industry into believing they were Californian hip hop artists “Silibil n Brains” . With their perfect American accents and attitudes they secured a record deal with Sony and lived the high life for a while until their deception began to spiral out of control.\n\nThe Great Hip Hop Hoax also features animation by Nottingham artist Jon Burgerman."
