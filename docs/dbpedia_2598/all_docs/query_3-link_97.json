        "text": "Jason Combs\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n13 min read\n\n·\n\n4 days ago\n\n--\n\nThe sweat-drenched, sunlit hours of brat summer are dwindling… have you danced yet?\n\nI know the handful of people that read this thing (hi, thank you) might have been wondering where June and July’s write-up went. Well it won’t surprise you to learn that the harsh and swift passage of time affects us all. The end of June I was traveling to and from Los Angeles and sadly getting sick right after returning home. I have notoriously been an LA-hater but I actually had a great time this visit. Staying in LA also means renting a car to get around (I don’t have a car here in Chicago) which I dread. But driving a car only a handful of times per year does make me appreciate “driving music.” I used to live in Atlanta and had a car, and I particularly love the ritual of picking out the perfect music for a drive. Trying to time an album or an EP out for a trip, or choosing something thematic to the area you’re in. Maybe I’ll make a road trip playlist one of these days.\n\nJuly was—surprise—also busy, catching up with work and attending Pitchfork Music Festival later in the month. It was my first time at the Chicago fest and we splurged on 3-day tickets that got us a shaded rest area and private bathrooms (extremely worth it). Got the chance to see so many incredible artists, but my favorite sets were ML Buch, Doss, Yaeji, Jai Paul, Wednesday, Jessie Ware, Jamie xx, Hailu Mergia, and Jessica Pratt. I was right at the barrier directly in front of the stage for Jamie xx, which was just a perfect hour-and-a-half of exhilarating, thumping, non-stop DJ set.\n\nIn sillier music news, Matmos’s Drew Daniel posted about a dream he had where a mysterious spectre ordained an entirely new genre of electronic music called “Hit Em.” In a hilarious and inspiring turn, a ton of musicians and producers took this as a call to action and started creating tracks in this newly-spawned dream genre. NPR even wrote about it. And yes, this is the same Drew Daniel that co-created an album entirely made of sounds from a Whirlpool washing machine.\n\nAlright, enough meandering, let’s get into the music. I’ve got a massive one for you this month: Seven incredible albums and a whopping 75-song playlist that tops out at nearly 5 hours in length.\n\nNew albums I’m listening to\n\nCharli xcx: “ BRAT”\n\nBrat is an album. Brat is an attitude. Brat is a feeling. Brat is a cultural phenomenon. Are you bumpin’ that?\n\nAfter over a decade of evolving, shaping, and pushing the boundaries of pop music, mostly in the shadows of her contemporaries, Charli is finally having her moment in the limelight. And the light is quite literally lime. The “brat green” cover, designed by Brent David Freany under Charli xcx creative director Imogene Strauss, is a work of marketing brilliance, spawning tens of thousands of memes that have reached a boiling point with our current Democratic presidential candidate. I’ve seen some foolish takes and observations online questioning the quality and judgement of the “bad” graphic design. And yeah, sure, it’s “bad,” if you weren’t on the internet for the past two decades. If you haven’t seen a deep-fried meme. If you didn’t download questionable overcompressed mp3s from Limewire with ID3 tags riddled with typos. If you didn’t watch 240p unofficial lyric videos on Youtube (I chose that song for a reason btw). If you weren’t there, then yeah, I’m sure the brat cover might not make a lot of sense. But those four pixelated Arial Narrow characters represent an entire legacy and history of music in the age of the internet.\n\nAlso… the music is good. I’ve been following Charli since the beginning and this is easily her most focused and punchy release yet. Back in 2016 when she started working with the legendary SOPHIE and A.G. Cook of PC Music, I knew something special was bubbling up. 2017s Pop2 mixtape was a turning point and completely changed my own perspective on what pop music could be. After a tumultuous album cycle back in 2022, many fans were left wondering if Charli had abandoned the more experimental side for a more digestible sound (I still enjoyed Crash regardless). But BRAT is a return to form for what makes Charli such a compelling artist. The pre-release hype cycle culminated back in March with a legendary Boiler Room set in NYC with the likes of A.G., George Daniel, and EasyFun (if I don’t get an official release of the EasyFun 365 remix I might lose it).\n\nThe record is packed with dance-floor ready electro-pop, cocaine-fueled highs, and tragic, poetic, synth ballad emotional lows. It’s hard to truly say what’s so special about this record without knowing Charli’s history and the era of music she’s channeling. BRAT’s sound is like a reimagining of early 2000’s electroclash or some futuristic follow-up in the Ed Banger Records catalogue. I hear little moments of Justice, MSTRKRFT, Mr. Oizo, and of course Uffie. Underneath its ‘vapid pop’ appearance, it’s so clear that this is a deeply personal record for Charli. The touching SOPHIE devotional “So I” is such a heartbreaking moment of vulnerability and humanity. BRAT is flawed, reckless, and real. I think it’s a pop masterpiece, and will likely come back into the conversation when I start thinking about my albums of the year. If you haven’t already listened to it and loved it, then it might not be for you, and that’s also ok. I forgive you.\n\nI was lucky enough to catch Charli live less than a week after BRAT’s release in Chicago. The line into the venue wrapped around over three blocks, a procession of black and green, leather, latex, fishnets, and silver. Unfortunately I didn’t hit the one-day shipping on Amazon for a neon green crop top fast enough, so I opted for a simple black t-shirt and bright orange shorts. She opened the show with the aforementioned 365 remix and the crowd lost their minds. It was electric.\n\nThe album has been out for nearly two months now. Have we reached oversaturation? Is ‘brat summer’ over? Only if you want it to be. But in my headphones, brat summer lives on.\n\nOfficial Store / Spotify / Apple Music\n\nsalute: “ TRUE MAGIC”\n\nIf you’re not done dancing yet, I’ve got an album for you.\n\nsalute only showed up on my radar last year with their excellent single Peach. Manchester, UK based Felix Nyajo caught me pretty instantly with their super upbeat and bouncing house sound. There was a bright, crisp, and bubbly energy to the production that I hadn’t felt in a while with dance music, as we’ve certainly been in an era where a lot of house music trends toward feeling “dark” or “lo-fi.” While their older work didn’t hook me as hard, I was excited to hear more of this sound.\n\nIf Peach was a test-drive, TRUE MAGIC sees salute stomping the accelerator to the floor. The album cover has Nyajo leaning out of a car window; flash on, hi vibrancy. It sounds exactly how it looks. The record kicks off with an engine revving and a perfect flipped sample from legendary Japanese jazz-fusion band Casiopea, also known for a racing-themed album. TRUE MAGIC is high-speed, thumping, non-stop perfect dance-pop. A Rina Sawayama feature “saving flowers” follows the intro, and is one of the best things she’s been on in years. Other stellar features weave in-and-out of Nyajo’s blazing production, with the likes of Disclosure, Sam Gellaitry, and Empress Of in the tracklist. A couple stand-out favorites of mine are “go!” featuring Japanese rapper Nakamura Minami, and “system” which I chose for the playlist this time around.\n\nsalute’s Spotify bio reads simply “passion is back” — and I absolutely feel it. TRUE MAGIC earns its title tenfold. I don’t have a car but this is a record I’d absolutely get a speeding ticket to.\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music\n\nBrijean: “Macro”\n\nIf there’s a record that’s been thoroughly overplayed on my turntable, it’s Brijean’s Feelings (2021). It’s a perfect Sunday-afternoon album. Brijean Murphy’s soft-but-ultra-catchy delivery is a perfect match for the psychedelic, tropical grooves she lays down with her partner Doug Stuart. While the duo has had two other full-lengths, nothing has grabbed me like Feelings. But their latest, Macro, might have just surpassed it. Into their usual soft-funk flavor is a new hint of Stereolab and a sprinking of Broadcast weirdness. It’s only a subtle evolution of the Brijean sound, but the lyrics are just a fraction more clever, the melodies a sliver more captivating. As Murphy nonchalantly talk-sings on “Bang Bang Boom:” It’s in the micro moments, it’s in a macro way. A perfect summer record.\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music\n\nBloomsday: “Heart of the Artichoke”\n\nI feel like I’ve been in a very oddly-specific emotional indie soft rock drought for a few years now. Lomelda’s Hannah came out way back in 2020, and since then nothing has scratched this particular itch for that type of vocal delivery and guitar strumming. But thankfully, this year has blessed me with two perfect records in whatever this micro-micro-genre is in my mind. First, that phenomenal Babehoven record I mentioned a couple of months ago, and second, Bloomsday’s Heart of the Artichoke. If you’re into this kind of music, I’m sure it won’t surpise you at all to learn that Heart was recorded in Babehoven’s studio and co-produced by Babehoven’s Ryan Albert. Oh, and just to connect all the dots here, the record also features Lomelda’s drummer.\n\nAll small-world-isms aside, what really cuts through on Heart is Iris Garrison’s charming and emotional songwriting. Deeply personal, but just abstract enough to keep you floating through the tracklist until a line decides to step out and cut you a bit. If there were ever a successor to Joan Osborne’s “One of Us” for depressed Milennial New-Yorkers, “Dollar Slice” would be in the front-running (I promise I mean that as a compliment, it’s my favorite song on the record). I’m in love with the guitars on this album as well. The instrumental “Night Swim” riff genuinely sounds like some of the iphone demo recordings from when I was in a slowcore band. Heart of the Artichoke is an incredibly lovable record. It’ll no-doubt be neck-and-neck with Babehoven’s Water’s Here in You for my indie rock album of the year.\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music\n\ntrndytrndy: “Virtua”\n\nAlright, this is technically just an EP and only runs about 15 minutes long, but I’m so in love with what trndytrndy is doing here. They got my attention back in 2022 with “hotel room” a nice little bedroom pop jam — but since then I didn’t know if they’d put out much except for a few songs here and there. Enter Virtua, an ultra-focused electronic project that feels exactly as utopian scholastic as the cover design looks. Something about music that uses these MIDI-esque instrument samples is so satisfying to me. The bending keyboard bassline in “Meteorological Centre” is truly brilliant. This whole EP sounds like it could be playing over the intro to the British TV series Eyewitness and I wouldn’t bat an eye.\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music\n\nClairo: “Charm”\n\nI might need to apologize for this, but I’m simply not a Clairo fan. Unfortunately Claire Cottrill’s particular brand of soft bedroom pop has just never been able to convince me to stick around for very long. Every record she puts out, I give a fair shot, and for whatever reason I just can’t be bothered to do a repeat playthrough. But as she’s stated in her own promotion of her new record: The third time’s the Charm.\n\nNow I’m a new Clairo fan, and I think I know exactly why her previous albums haven’t stuck with me. She’s been working with the wrong producers. Rostam and Jack Antonoff are, I’m sorry, just not good at this. Charm is an incredibly warm, refreshing, and just genuinely sweet album thanks to the standout production from Leon Michels. Michels brings huge 60s and 70s inspired instrumentation to the table, elevating Cottrill’s songwriting to the level it probably deserves to be on. There’s clearly so much fun and experimentation that happened in the studio peppered all over Charm. “Juna” and “Add Up My Love” are two personal standouts, but I really don’t think the album has any skips.\n\nOfficial Store / Spotify / Apple Music\n\nTotal Blue: “Total Blue”\n\nI trust pretty much anything that comes out of Music From Memory. The Amsterdam label has staked a reputation on phenomenal reissues and compilations since 2013. But when a band puts their debut release out on MFM (like The Zenmenn did in 2021), my ears definitely perk up.\n\nTotal Blue is a welcome stamp on MFM’s ultra quality passport. The LA trio smoothly blends synthesizers into new age-y world music and cool jazz. This simultaneously sounds like an album that someone dug up from an 80s KPM library music catalog, while also sounding like something completely from the future. This one’s new in the rotation for me, but has already become a regular spin while I’m in focus mode. Brain-massage music.\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music"
