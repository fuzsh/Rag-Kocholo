Such an understanding was not immediately evident to an older Ghanaian generation, when in the 1990s Reggie Rockstone pioneered the Ghanaian Hip-Hop movement, known in Ghana as Hip-Life. Back then, Hip- Life was viewed as an epitome of the gradual creeping of negative foreign values into Ghanaian civil society, with special emphasis on Ghanaian youth.
