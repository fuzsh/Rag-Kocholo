        "text": "The MTV Video Music Awards nominations for 2024 have been revealed, and they are largely lacking in representation of modern rock and metal acts.\n\nWhen the nominees were announced Tuesday (Aug. 6), it was probably no surprise to see pop icons such as Taylor Swift leading the way with 10 nominations, and artists such as Post Malone, Ariana Grande, Eminem and Sabrina Carpenter serving as her biggest challengers. But what was surprising was how little many of today's most prominent rock and metal acts were represented, even in the categories assigned for rock.\n\nThere were zero rock nominees included in the big four categories of Video of the Year, Artist of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist. So which rock and metal artists did actually receive nominations?\n\nWho Got Nominated in the MTV VMA Rock Categories?\n\nThe nominees for MTV's Best Rock VMA read like a list of elder statesmen, with all of the acts having been around since the early 2000s. They include Bon Jovi for \"Legendary,\" Coldplay for \"feelslikeimfallinginlove,\" Green Day for \"Dilemma,\" Kings of Leon for \"Mustang,\" Lenny Kravitz for \"Human\" and U2 for \"Atomic City.\"\n\nThe other rock centric category was Best Alternative where Benson Boone's \"Beautiful Things,\" Bleachers' \"Tiny Moves,\" Hozier's \"Too Sweet,\" Imagine Dragons' \"Eyes Closed,\" Linkin Park's \"Friendly Fire\" and Teddy Swims' \"Lose Control (Live)\" at least had a closer tie to what has been faring well for alternative rock radio.\n\nBEST ALTERNATIVE\n\nBenson Boone – “Beautiful Things” – Night Street Records, Inc. / Warner Records\n\nBleachers – “Tiny Moves” – Dirty Hit\n\nHozier – “Too Sweet” – Columbia Records\n\nImagine Dragons – “Eyes Closed” – KIDinaKorner / Interscope Records\n\nLinkin Park – “Friendly Fire” – This Compilation / Warner Records\n\nTeddy Swims – “Lose Control (Live)” – Warner Records\n\nBEST ROCK\n\nBon Jovi – “Legendary” – Island\n\nColdplay – “feelslikeimfallinginlove” – Atlantic Records\n\nGreen Day – “Dilemma” – Reprise Records / Warner Records\n\nKings of Leon – “Mustang” – Capitol Records\n\nLenny Kravitz – “Human” – ℗© 2024 Roxie Records Inc. under exclusive license to BMG Rights Management GmbH\n\nU2 – “Atomic City” – Interscope Records\n\nOutside of those two categories, it's pretty bleak for rock fans. Coldplay got a \"Video for Good\" nomination and Bleachers received Best Direction and Best Choreography nominations. Meanwhile, The Warning's \"Automatic Sun,\" which was featured by the network in July, is up for the MTV Push Performance of the Year.\n\nWho's Up for the Big Awards?\n\nAs previously stated, pop rules! Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Eminem, Post Malone and others are well represented in the bigger categories. A listing of the nominees for the top four categories can be seen below.\n\nVIDEO OF THE YEAR\n\nAriana Grande – “we can’t be friends (wait for your love)” – Republic Records\n\nBillie Eilish – “LUNCH” – Darkroom / Interscope Records\n\nDoja Cat – “Paint The Town Red” – Kemosabe Records / RCA Records\n\nEminem – “Houdini” – Shady / Aftermath / Interscope Records\n\nSZA – “Snooze” – Top Dawg Entertainment / RCA Records\n\nTaylor Swift ft. Post Malone – “Fortnight” – Republic Records\n\nARTIST OF THE YEAR\n\nAriana Grande – Republic Records\n\nBad Bunny – Rimas Entertainment\n\nEminem – Shady / Aftermath / Interscope Records\n\nSabrina Carpenter – Island\n\nSZA – Top Dawg Entertainment / RCA Records\n\nTaylor Swift – Republic Records\n\nSONG OF THE YEAR\n\nBeyoncé – “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM” – Parkwood Entertainment / Columbia Records\n\nJack Harlow – “Lovin On Me” – Generation Now / Atlantic Records\n\nKendrick Lamar – “Not Like Us” – pgLang, under exclusive license to Interscope Records\n\nSabrina Carpenter – “Espresso” – Island\n\nTaylor Swift ft.
