        "text": "Reviews by Carl Chery, Kemet High, and Adrian Covert\n\nIn February, we launched Spotify CLASSICS—our first-ever program to celebrate catalog music. Our inaugural list acknowledged the Classic Hip-Hop and R&B Albums of the Streaming Era and featured timeless releases like Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN., Future’s DS2, Jay-Z’s 4:44, and Travis Scott’s ASTROWORLD, to name a few.\n\nIn April, we kicked off the second chapter of CLASSICS by unveiling the 100 Greatest R&B Songs of the Streaming Era. And today we unveil the latest chapter of our CLASSICS program: The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of the Streaming Era. Spotify defines the streaming era as a time frame that spans from 2015 until present day.\n\nHip-hop has been the most influential genre in pop culture for decades, but it became the No.1 music genre in the U.S. in 2017, according to Nielsen. Hip-hop’s commercial ascendance coincided with existential shifts for the genre. Rap transitioned to a more melodic format, occasionally making it hard to distinguish between hip-hop and R&B. Trap became the most popular sound in music, and its practitioners started releasing music at a relentless pace. But hip-hop remains as creatively inspired as ever, marked by the emergence of an exciting new generation who have already made their presence felt when it comes to the best hip-hop songs.\n\nSpotify’s U.S. hip-hop editorial team—spearheaded by Carl Chery, Creative Director, Head of Urban Music—has taken on the ambitious task of reviewing thousands of songs, and in the end, this list offers a snapshot of hip-hop during the streaming era. Spotify CLASSICS is 100% qualitative. The criteria for the list are based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The program is driven by our editors’ music and cultural expertise—not by data—meaning that big streaming numbers were not a requirement to make the list.\n\nNote: All songs were released on Spotify after January 1, 2015. The Spotify streams are current as of May 20, 2024.\n\n100.

Going viral on social media thanks to cameo appearances from content creators Kai Cenat and Fanum, Uzi lets the hypnotic, frenetic beat take center stage, putting just enough on the track to elevate it from a club instrumental to certified anthem for a new generation of hip-hop fans.\n\nSpotify Streams: 655,927,043\n\nFun Fact: Lil Uzi Vert credits both Philly and New Jersey with the dance craze that helped make this song a smash. “I’m from Philly, it’s called blicking,” he told HipHopDX. “I ain’t even make it up. It’s all these kids in Philly that do it. In Jersey, it’s called rocking your hips. All my lil’ boys out in Philly, they taught me how to do it and all that.”\n\n49. DaBaby – “Suge”\n\nSouth Coast Music Group/Interscope Records, 2019\n\nProduced by: jetsonmade, Pooh Beatz\n\nThough he generated a healthy amount of buzz with mixtapes like Blank Blank, DaBaby turned himself into one of 2019’s most discussed and debated rappers after releasing his major-label debut, Baby on Baby, and its breakout single, “Suge.” At once brash and workmanlike, comedic and dead serious, DaBaby’s signature charisma and precision is on full display as he spits bar after bar, comparing himself to Death Row Records founder Suge Knight.\n\nSpotify Streams: 645,370,154\n\nFun Fact: The creation of DaBaby’s breakthrough song was inspired by his record label dropping the deposit into his account after he inked a high-figure deal.\n\n48. Metro Boomin ft. Future & Chris Brown – “Superhero (Heroes & Villains)”\n\nBoominati Worldwide LLC/Republic Records, 2022\n\nProduced by: Metro Boomin\n\nAfter forming one of rap’s most potent partnerships in the 2010s and spawning hits like “Honest,” “Jumpman,” “Mask Off,” “Low Life,” and the majority of DS2, Metro Boomin and Future reunited for 2022’s “Superhero (Heroes & Villains)” to remind the world of that magic that happens when the two step into the studio together. Over a beat that would have been at home on DS2, an energized Future drops some of his sharpest rhymes in recent years, a moment that would eventually lead to the pair of albums that have become two of 2024’s most-buzzed-about releases: We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You.\n\nSpotify Streams: 687,599,595\n\nFun Fact: “Superhero” first leaked online in 2021. Metro told Variety they’d worked on the song years before it saw the light of day. At its official release, it included a clip of Jay-Z—pulled from “So Appalled”—that stuck out to the producer when he was revisiting My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\n47. Hitkidd, GloRilla – “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)”\n\nBlac Noize!/Campsouth Records, 2022\n\nProduced by: Hitkidd\n\nA regional banger in the truest sense, Hitkidd and GloRilla’s “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” couldn’t be more Memphis if it tried. Paying homage to the city’s legends like Three 6 Mafia, GloRilla wears her Gangsta Boo influences on her sleeve as she rides Hitkidd’s horrorcore-inspired throwback beat with a vengeance. It proved to be a star-making moment for the rapper; one that might not have happened had the beat been taken by the rapper Hitkidd originally had in mind: Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nSpotify Streams: 66,755,597\n\nFun Fact: Hitkidd originally sent this beat to Megan Thee Stallion, but when her response time was too long, Hitkidd brought it to GloRilla. Nicki Minaj and Cardi B also asked to be on the remix of the track, though ultimately their requests could not be honored.\n\n46. Gunna – “fukumean”\n\nYoung Stoner Life Records/300 Entertainment/Gunna Music LLC, 2023\n\nProduced by: Dunk Roc, Flo\n\nHaving spent the bulk of 2022 weathering federal felony charges and serving jail time, Gunna emerged in 2023 with his legal woes in the rearview mirror. On “fukumean,” the Atlanta rhymespitter takes a back-to-basics approach. Returning to effortless, rapid-fire flows from Drip Harder that helped put him and Lil Baby on the map, Gunna makes it crystal clear that he’s back and focused on enjoying the fruits of his labor.\n\nSpotify Streams: 729,899,664\n\nFun Fact: This song earned Gunna his first solo hit on Billboard’s Hot 100, peaking at No. 4.\n\n45. Future ft. Drake & Tems – “WAIT FOR U”\n\nEpic Records/Freebandz Entertainment, 2022\n\nProduced by: ATL Jacob, FNZ, Tejiiri Akpoghene, 1SRAEL, Sonic Major\n\nThough currently at odds, Future and Drake are like the Hardy Brothers when it comes to tag-teaming songs. A decade into their working relationship, the duo united once again in 2022 for the Grammy Award–winning romanza “Wait For U.” The titan-level melodists ice-skate through their verses with tales about being cold-hearted loverboys over a seraphic beat that’s finessed by ATL Jacob. In what stands as the biggest cheat code of the song, it was his decision to include a sample of Tems’s vaporizing vocals from her breakout hit, “Higher.” A chart-topping masterpiece, “Wait For U” is sensational from start to finish.\n\nSpotify Streams: 766,348,279\n\nFun Fact: Tems isn’t actually featured on the track. Her vocals from a Genius “Open Mic” performance of “Higher” are sampled.\n\n44. Doja Cat – “Paint the Town Red”\n\nKemosabe Records/RCA, 2023\n\nProduced by: Karl Rubin, Earl on the Beat, Jean Baptiste, DJ Replay\n\nOver a beat that samples Dionne Warwick’s classic soul anthem “Walk on By,” Doja Cat’s feelings on celebrity, public criticism, and internet fandoms are laid bare on “Paint the Town Red.” Unapologetically pledging to keep doing her and not caring what people think, Doja Cat’s devil-may-care attitude landed the artist her first Billboard No.1 and her fifth song in Spotify’s Billions Club.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,029,923,557\n\nFun Fact: Producer Earl on the Beat created the beat for “Paint The Town Red” back in 2021. He told Revolt he was going through Dionne Warwick’s catalog seeking sample inspiration when he discovered “Walk on By.” He then met Doja at a Grammy party and the rest is history. “I did some touch-ups the next day because the beat was old, and I sent it right off the next day,” he said. “I shot my shot.”\n\n43. Drake, Future – “Jumpman”\n\nCash Money Records, 2015\n\nProduced by: Metro Boomin\n\nThere was a time when the Drake–Future collaboration felt like a universal constant. So after both rappers spent the first nine months of 2015 dominating hip-hop, their biggest fans had already been anticipating their joint victory lap in the form of the mixtape What A Time To Be Alive. From its release, it was “Jumpman” that immediately hopped from the speakers. Featuring an all-time-great Metro Boomin beat and perhaps the greatest use of a brand logo as a metaphor for sustained greatness, the pair’s electric energy on the track quickly helped it become their best collab to date.\n\nSpotify Streams: 817,851,260\n\nFun Fact: “Jumpman” was Future’s first Top 15 entry on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n42. City Girls – “Act Up”\n\nQuality Control Music/Motown Records/Capitol Records, 2018\n\nProduced by: Earl on the Beat\n\nWhen City Girls dropped “Act Up” at the end of 2018 and it blossomed into a chart-topper the following summer, it was more than a sleek club banger full of ratchet scam raps. JT and Yung Miami’s breakout hit solidified the arrival of a new wave of women in mainstream hip-hop—including the likes of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion—who were making moves on their own terms.\n\nSpotify Streams: 285,181,334\n\nFun Fact: In its short life, “Act Up”—which remains the duo’s highest-charting single—has already been sampled or referenced a handful of times, including on Megan Thee Stallion’s “Hot Girl Summer” and Chris Brown and Young Thug’s “City Girls.”\n\n41. Travis Scott – “Antidote”\n\nCactus Jack Records/Epic Records, 2015\n\nProduced by: Travis Scott, Eestbound, Wondagurl\n\n“Antidote” wasn’t originally slated for Travis Scott’s major-label debut album, Rodeo, but the Houston rapper quickly changed his mind after the song delivered his first real taste of commercial success. Inspired by Rae Sremmurd’s “No Type,” Travis’s singsongy approach proves to be a bona fide earworm as he raps over a slowed-down sample from Lee Fields’ “All I Need.”\n\nSpotify Streams: 688,673,846\n\nFun Fact: Wondagurl and Eestbound first heard the sample of “Antidote” on the radio while eating at The Keg Steakhouse in Toronto. They eventually had to surrender 50% of the track’s profits as a result of using the sample.\n\n40. XXXtentacion – “Look At Me!”\n\nBad Vibes Forever/EMPIRE, 2017\n\nProduced by: Jimmy Duval, Cristian Rojas\n\nPerhaps existing as the song that ushered in the emo rap era, XXXtentacion’s “Look At Me” had already garnered millions of streams and attracted a sizable following of fans years before it served as the late rapper’s 2017 major-label debut single. Drawing from hardcore and hip-hop in equal measure, the distorted and aggressive sounds in the beats and rhymes established the blueprint for the many rappers who followed in his footsteps.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,417,956,479\n\nFun Fact: “Look At Me!,” which marked X’s commercial debut, is one of the late rapper’s 10 songs to have more than 1 billion streams. Producer Cristian Rojas told Genius the song took 15 minutes to complete.\n\n39. Chance The Rapper ft. Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz – “No Problem”\n\nSelf-Released, 2016\n\nProduced by: Brasstracks\n\nChance The Rapper managed to become an avatar for independence and a household name without selling any music. The Chicago rapper’s 2013 mixtape, Acid Rap, made him a star, but 2016’s Coloring Book is the first project he released for commerce. “No Problem” is rich in gospel undertones, but its lead single is a down-the-middle party song. Chance cleverly turns his anti-label stance into a defiant sing-a-long moment on the song’s pre-chorus: “If one more label try to stop me/It’s gon be some dreadhead n**** in the lobby,” he chants. The song won Best Rap Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards and helped turn Coloring Book into one of the most groundbreaking mixtapes of the streaming era.\n\nSpotify Streams: 500,490,447\n\nFun Fact: Coloring Book is the first streaming-only mixtape to win a Grammy Award.\n\n38. Lil Baby – “Freestyle”\n\nQuality Control Music/Motown Records, 2017\n\nProduced by: Joseph Davinci, Jrhitmaker, The Martianz, Taz Taylor\n\nBefore teaming up with Gunna on their star-making mixtape Drip Harder, Lil Baby put the music world on notice with “Freestyle.” Flashing the melodic flows and dramatic production that would later punctuate the Atlanta rapper’s best work, “Freestyle” was the opening salvo that would help Lil Baby join hip-hop’s elite.\n\nSpotify Streams: 693,846,077\n\nFun Fact: This song, and its accompanying video, were first uploaded to YouTube before appearing on Lil Baby’s mixtape Too Hard. It contributed to the rapper’s ascent to stardom and remains a fan favorite to this day.\n\n37. GoldLink ft. Shy Glizzy & Brent Faiyaz – “Crew”\n\nRCA, 2016\n\nProduced by: Teddy Walton\n\nGoldLink was relatively unknown outside of niche music scenes until he ditched his signature sound for this DMV anthem. “Crew” is nostalgic at its core—it sounds like the hip-hop/R&B formula popularized in the ’90s and ’00s—but it very much feels of the time. Shy Glizzy and Brent Faiyaz both offer scene-stealing guest appearances. Brent’s, in particular, served as a springboard to mainstream recognition. “Crew” bubbled in the underground for months and later grew into an all-purpose rap song that keeps getting better with time.\n\nSpotify Streams: 551,166,448\n\nFun Fact: “Crew” is now certified 7x platinum by the RIAA. The song was also nominated for “Best Rap/Sung Collaboration” at the 2018 Grammy Awards.\n\n36. Kodak Black ft. XXXtentacion – “Roll in Peace”\n\nAtlantic, 2017\n\nProduced by: London On Da Track\n\n“Roll in Peace” exists as a moment frozen in time, capturing a snapshot of three emerging artists all on the cusp of stardom. Working over a hypnotic London On Da Track beat, Kodak Black’s confessional style is as engaging as ever, while XXXTENTACION proves he’s just as at home over a radio-friendly single as he is over his own idiosyncratic songs.\n\nSpotify Streams: 680,412,299\n\nFun Fact: “Roll in Peace” is the first and only collaboration between the two Florida rappers. Kodak’s label teased another in 2018, a few months after X’s untimely death, but it was never released.\n\n35. Baby Keem ft. Kendrick Lamar – “Family Ties”\n\npgLang/Columbia, 2021\n\nProduced by: Hakeem Carter, Cardo, Outtatown, roselilah, Deats, Jasper Harris, Frankie Bash\n\nBaby Keem cultivated his fan base for three years before he finally collaborated with pgLang’s label boss, Kendrick Lamar (who also happens to be his first cousin). “Family Ties” arguably makes the best use of a beat switch since Travis Scott’s “SICKO MODE.” Keem sets the tone over mosh pit–inducing horns before Kendrick takes center stage on a more barebones sound bed. “I am the Omega,” K. Dot declares, immediately generating excitement for the lyricist’s first guest appearance in years. “Smoking on your Top 5, stop playing I’m that guy,” Kendrick raps later, planting the seeds for his historic battle against Drake earlier this year.\n\nSpotify Streams: 764,633,993\n\nFun Fact: The original version of “Family Ties” didn’t include a beat switch and instead featured Kendrick rapping over the same instrumental as Baby Keem. The OG version leaked online after the official single’s release.\n\n34. Mustard ft. Roddy Ricch – “Ballin”\n\n10 Summers Records/Interscope Records\n\nProduced by: Mustard, GYLTTRYP, Justus West\n\nWhile Roddy Ricch already had pair of noteworthy mixtapes—Feed Tha Streets and Feed Tha Streets II—and couple of hit singles to his name in “Die Young” and “Every Season,” it was his collaboration with Mustard on “Ballin” that set his career on a stratospheric trajectory. As he works alongside the chameleonic producer, Roddy’s versatility is on full display, with his melodic, Young Thug–influenced flow shining through on the feel-good, pop-rap track as much as on any of the trap anthems he built his buzz around.\n\nSpotify Streams: 901,356,097\n\nFun Fact: “Ballin” was the first time Roddy and Mustard worked on music together. Mustard held it for one year before releasing it.\n\n33. Playboi Carti – “Magnolia”\n\nAWGE/Interscope Records, 2017\n\nProduced by: Pi’erre Bourne\n\nThe once traditional sound of hip-hop truly began to mutate in the 2010s thanks to innovative artists like Playboi Carti, who shifted the game with his silvery hit “Magnolia.” Working in tandem with his brother-in-sound, Pi’erre Bourne, the Atlanta rapper cuts through the cybernated production with his own language and puts a flashlight on his lifestyle of running the block, putting his opps on T-shirts, and being surrounded by foes in disguise. From the beat to the flow to the ad-libs, “Magnolia” showcased new energy in a new era.\n\nSpotify Streams: 824,627,336\n\nFun Fact: This record popularized Pi’erre Bourne’s “Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?” producer tag, which is a sample from the third episode of The Jamie Foxx Show.\n\n32. Offset, Metro Boomin – “Ric Flair Drip”\n\nSlaughter Gang LLC/Epic Records/Quality Control Music/Capitol/Boominati Worldwide/Republic, 2017\n\nProduced by: Metro Boomin, Bijan Amir\n\nIf there was ever a perfect distillation of Atlanta rap in the streaming era, it might be “Ric Flair Drip,” the lead single from 21 Savage, Offset, and Metro Boomin’s 2017 joint mixtape, Without Warning. Marrying Offset’s double-time and triplet flows with a dark, synthy Metro Boomin beat tailor-made for the clubs, the cut proved to be an instant classic and helped forge a friendship between Offset and the song’s namesake. Not only would pro wrestling legend Ric Flair make a cameo appearance in the music video, but he also walked down the aisle to the song at his wedding.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,477,152,836\n\nFun Fact: On the digital series The Debut Live, Offset explained that he “hated the song” before it came out and didn’t want Metro to include it on Without Warning. But once it was released and quickly received well, he had to give credit where it was due. “I’ll never forget, like three days later, we [were] No. 1…and he [was] like, ‘I told you. I do this s***.’”\n\n31. J. Cole – “MIDDLE CHILD”\n\nDreamville/Roc Nation Records, 2019\n\nProduced by: T-Minus, J. Cole\n\nOften debated among hip-hop heads, J. Cole rose to fame during a transitional period for rap. Neither a throwback formalist who calls back to the golden era nor a genre-bending alien out to reshape the sound of rap, the one-time Jay-Z protege has always been caught between worlds. On the aptly titled “MIDDLE CHILD,” the rapper takes aim at his critics on both sides of the generational divide. Over a T-Minus beat that blends a dusty, blaring horn sample with sleek, synthesized blips, he takes pride in his distinct position, reminding the world that he’s at the top of the hip-hop pyramid, and he’s not going anywhere soon.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,273,706,340\n\nFun Fact: The horns on “MIDDLE CHILD” are sampled from First Choice’s “Wake Up To Me.” Additionally, this is Cole’s highest-charting record as a solo artist and his second-most-streamed track in Spotify history.\n\n30. Kanye West ft. Chance The Rapper, The-Dream, Kelly Price & Kirk Franklin – “Ultralight Beam”\n\nG.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam\n\nProduced by: Kanye West, MIKE DEAN, Chance The Rapper, Swizz Beatz\n\nKanye West’s faith has inspired some of his most ambitious musical moments. “Ultralight Beam” samples the viral clip of a four-year-old’s impassioned prayer before embarking on a spiritual journey punctuated with pipe organs and a glorious 10-piece choir. Ye plays choir director, only offering a short verse before leading a parade of guests, including Kelly Price, The-Dream, Kirk Franklin, and Chance The Rapper, who delivers a scene-stealing appearance that furthered his footprint with mainstream audiences. The song served as a runway for Chance’s groundbreaking mixtape Coloring Book and planted more seeds for Ye’s gospel-fueled Jesus Is King three years later.\n\nSpotify Streams: 352,014,735\n\nFun Fact: The Life of Pablo’s “Ultralight Beam” and “Famous” were both nominated for “Best Rap Sung/Performance” at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n29. Drake – “Back To Back”\n\nYoung Money/Cash Money/Republic, 2015\n\nProduced by: Daxz, Noah “40” Shebib, Drake, NAV\n\nFriends turned foes when Meek Mill accused Drake of using a ghostwriter on their collaboration “R.I.C.O.” from Meek’s Dreams Worth More Than Money album. Drake responded with a warning shot titled “Charged Up” and followed up with the scathing “Back To Back” 48 hours later. Drake unloaded a series of funny lyrics and emasculating bars and turned the song into an inescapable club hit. “Twitter fingers” is still a social media reference to this day. “Back To Back” is not only one of the most memorable tracks of the streaming era,it stands among the most potent diss records of all time.\n\nSpotify Streams: 407,488,460\n\nFun Fact: The song’s title references the Toronto Blue Jays winning back-to-back World Series championships in 1992 and 1993. The Blue Jays defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in ’93. The song was released on July 29, 2015—the same day the Blue Jays beat the Phillies 18 years prior.\n\n28. Kendrick Lamar – “DNA.”\n\nTDE/Aftermath/Interscope, 2017\n\nProduced by: Mike WiLL Made-It\n\nKendrick Lamar is cut from a different cloth. Hip-hop has become such a lifestyle genre that very few commercially viable artists rap for the sake of rapping anymore. “DNA.” is a rap masterclass. Kenny ventures into trap, an exercise that showcases a range of cadences and his ability to convey vivid imagery. “Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA/Backbone don’t exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge,” he raps with disdain. The song was never released as an official single, but it quickly became a fan favorite and is now one of three songs with 1 billion Spotify streams on Kendrick’s biggest album to date.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,142,857,561\n\nFun Fact: “DNA.” is now certified 9x platinum.\n\n27. Post Malone ft. 21 Savage – “Rockstar”\n\nRepublic Records, 2018\n\nProduced by: Louis Bell, Tank God\n\nAfter breaking through in 2014 with his unexpected hit “White Iverson” and raising more than a few eyebrows, Post Malone kicked his career into overdrive when he collaborated with a red-hot 21 Savage on “Rockstar.” Much like Post’s debut single, “Rockstar” blurs the lines between pop and rap, though the production (and 21’s verse) gives the song even more of a hip-hop edge. It’s a combination that proved especially potent, quickly becoming one of the most-streamed songs on Spotify ever and generating more than 2 billion streams to date.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,943,094,019\n\nFun Fact: “Rockstar” is the most-streamed rap song in Spotify history. It was the longest-charting No. 1 rap song in 2018, and outside of the United States, the Grammy Award–winning song earned the top chart position in 10 other countries, including Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Ireland.\n\n26. Rae Sremmurd – “Black Beatles”\n\nEardruma Records/Interscope Records, 2016\n\nProduced by: Mike WiLL Made-It, Mustard\n\nBefore Post Malone released the aforementioned “Rockstar” and Donald Glover declared that “Migos are The Beatles of this generation,” Rae Sremmurd delivered “Black Beatles” to the world and made it known that rappers are, in fact, today’s rockstars. Having already landed a pair of hits in “No Flex Zone” and “No Type,” Rae Sremmurd was a duo on the rise. But with their Gucci Mane–assisted follow-up, Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi called their own shot. “Black Beatles” not only became one of the biggest and most critically acclaimed tracks of 2016—thanks to its ice-cold earworm of a melody and the Mannequin Challenge that it inspired on social media—but it also rocketed Rae Sremmurd to new levels of hip-hop stardom.\n\nSpotify Streams: 966,407,412\n\nFun Fact: Rae Sremmurd came up with “Black Beatles” just two days before they were due to turn in their sophomore effort, SremmLife 2. “It was a dope phrase,” Swae Lee told Rolling Stone of the inspiration behind the song’s title. “I’ve always loved John Lennon’s swag. I like his glasses.”\n\n25. Tyler, The Creator – “EARFQUAKE”\n\nColumbia, 2019\n\nProduced by: Tyler, The Creator\n\nTyler, The Creator’s “EARFQUAKE” defies classification. It’s not a rap song—though Playboi Carti makes an appearance. It’s not necessarily R&B, despite Tyler’s singing for the entire song, occasionally assisted by Charlie Wilson’s delightful background vocals. IGOR was Tyler’s most left-of-center project to date, and as the lead single, “EARFQUAKE” powered the album in its commercial battle against DJ Khaled’s Father of Asahd, the most publicized SoundScan showdown since Kanye West’s Graduation defeated 50 Cent’s Curtis 12 years prior. The contrast was clear: Tyler explored new boundaries sonically and thematically while Khaled offered a middle-of-the-road rap compilation. Tyler won.\n\nSpotify Streams: 945,717,091\n\nFun Fact: The song’s video features a cameo from actress Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays a talk show host.\n\n24. Polo G – “RAPSTAR”\n\nColumbia, 2020\n\nProduced by: Einer Bankz\n\nTeasing a song snippet became an effective way to build anticipation for new music during the streaming era. In the case of Polo G’s “RAPSTAR,” the song lived up to expectations. Produced by Einer Bankz—the ukulele player who’s gone viral for strumming acoustic versions of rap hits—the single highlights the Chicago rapper’s more introspective side.. “I’ve been getting high to hide my insecurities,” he raps in a melodic tone. The song debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the biggest hit of Polo’s career.\n\nSpotify Streams: 916,047,523\n\nFun Fact: “RAPSTAR” is Polo’s first song to top Spotify’s Top 50 USA chart.\n\n23. 21 Savage ft. J. Cole – “a lot”\n\nSlaughter Gang/Epic Records, 2018\n\nProduced by: Dahi\n\n“a lot” represented a curveball of sorts when it appeared as the lead track on 21 Savage’s 2018 album i am > i was. Instead of a cameo from Future and a Metro Boomin beat full of synths and trap drums, the Atlanta rapper showed up with a verse from J. Cole and a soulful boom-bap beat produced by Dahi. All the same, 21 and Cole work their magic on the deceptively nuanced track, touching on everything from family tragedies to the failings of the justice system. Standing as 21 Savage’s most-streamed solo release to date, “a lot” also nabbed a Grammy for Best Rap Song.\n\nSpotify Streams: 940,369,453\n\nFun Fact: This Grammy Award–winning song was produced during a Spotify songwriter camp in the summer of 2018.\n\n22. Meek Mill ft. Drake – “Going Bad”\n\nMaybach Music/Atlantic, 2019\n\nProduced by: Wheezy\n\nMeek Mill’s career took a hit after he started feuding with Drake in 2015. He was sentenced to two to four years in prison for a parole violation two years later. Meek’s fortune changed when an investigative Rolling Stone article exposed the foul play that led to him serving time. He was released soon after, became a poster boy for prison reform, and reclaimed a favorable approval rating with rap fans. The former foes rekindled their friendship and subsequently collaborated on this Wheezy-produced club banger from Meek’s Championships album. The song quickly became the biggest hit of Meek’s career, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and eventually joining Spotify’s Billions Club.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,178,603,152\n\n21. Fetty Wap – “Trap Queen”\n\n300 Entertainment/RGF Productions\n\nProduced by: Fadd\n\nWhile plenty of rising emcees in the streaming era have found fame by creating their own DIY internet scenes with like-minded artists and fans across the world, the story of Fetty Wap and “Trap Queen” is a throwback to the glory days of ’90s regional rap. Fetty’s rise to ubiquity was made possible by the initial buzz and support his summertime anthem received from the New Jersey rap scene he came up in. That buzz was well justified, too: A fever dream of a love song took contemporary hip-hop’s love for melodic lyrics and synthed-out beats and turned it up to 11. In an era where monoculture has all but vanished, “Trap Queen” didn’t just spawn a mainstream hit; it captured the singular attention of a nation.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,172,094,724\n\nFun Fact: The third song that Fetty Wap ever wrote, “Trap Queen” was penned over a beat that was found on SoundClick.com.\n\n20. Cardi B ft. Megan Thee Stallion – “WAP”\n\nAtlantic, 2020\n\nProduced by: Ayo & Keyz\n\nCardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP” is an impossibly catchy classic that unapologetically revels in its raunchiness, much like the most memorable hits from ’90s and ’00s icons Khia, Lil’ Kim, and Trina. Undeniably provocative, “WAP” evoked an entire spectrum of thoughts and feelings from listeners upon its release. And while it managed to cause a certain subset of America to clutch their pearls—or in Cardi B’s words, “made some soccer moms cry”—for millions of others it served as an empowerment anthem to rally around, or the perfect soundtrack for a fun night out.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,315,292,890\n\nFun Fact: “WAP” set off a moral panic upon its release, with political talking heads decrying its so-called lack of values and calling for boycotts. Still, it became the first female rap collaboration to debut atop the Hot 100, a spot it would capture for four nonconsecutive weeks.\n\n19. French Montana ft. Swae Lee – “Unforgettable”\n\nBad Boy Entertainment/Epic Records, 2017\n\nProduced by: Mike WiLL Made-It, C.P. Dubb, Jaegan, 1Mind\n\nThough some might assume the commercial success of “Unforgettable” was inevitable, its path to becoming a global smash hit was anything but. Starting out as a beat sent to Drake by Indianapolis trio 1mind, it systematically made its way through the likes of Swae Lee, Jaegen, Mike Will Made-It, and French Montana. But once the song was released into the wild, the dembow beat paired with Swae Lee’s timeless hook had the song soaring, earning it a spot in Spotify’s Billions Club and landing French Montana the biggest hit of his star-studded career.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,027,009,358\n\nFun Fact: The demo of this track belonged to Jeremih, who played the then R&B song for French Montana during a studio session. Between getting the sample cleared and funding the music video, which was shot in Uganda, French says that he spent upward of $500,000 to get “Unforgettable” across the finish line.\n\n18. Lil Baby ft. 42 Dugg – “We Paid”\n\nQuality Control Music/UMG Recordings, 2020\n\nProduced by: Section 8\n\nMonths into the COVID-19 pandemic, Lil Baby and 42 Dugg injected energy into our isolated lives with the release of “We Paid.” Channeling true hustlers like the Black Mafia Family and Jeezy, the Detroit and Atlanta rappers bestowed a blueprint of how they turned their L’s into M’s.\n\nIn a two-man weave, Dugg, who was still flying high as a rookie-of-the-year frontrunner, set the tone with some caption-worthy strays aimed at Yung Joc and Michael Vick. Then Baby, an all-star-level sharpshooter, flexes about his rise from dope boy to Billboard chart mainstay. “We Paid” was and still is a blue-ribbon example of touching nothing but net.\n\nSpotify Streams: 412,934,762\n\nFun Fact: Tyler, The Creator once tweeted that “We Paid” is the “core of rap music,” though he couldn’t articulate further. The song is 42 Dugg’s first and only Top 10 hit in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n17. Kodak Black – “No Flockin”\n\nAtlantic, 2015\n\nProduced by: Vinnyx\n\nKodak Black first made his mark at a time when hip-hop was still mourning the so-called death of gangsta rap. Yak emerged as a budding new face of street music for his generation, and “No Flockin” was his mission statement. The Florida rapper launches a series of flow patterns and memorable lyrics over a haunting piano melody that’s reminiscent of John Carpenter’s “Halloween Theme.” The single also inspired Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow,” which in turn became a seminal influence for female rappers.\n\nSpotify Streams: 444,165,927\n\nFun Fact: Yak claims “No Flockin” popularized using the word “broccoli” as slang for weed; DRAM would release a hit song titled “Broccoli” a year later.\n\n16. Kendrick Lamar – “HUMBLE”\n\nTDE/Aftermath/Interscope, 2017\n\nProduced by: Mike WiLL Made-It\n\nJudging from Kendrick Lamar’s first two studio albums, the laid-back good kid, m.A.A.d city and the jazzy To Pimp A Butterfly, few would have guessed that the Compton rapper would hop in the studio with Mike WiLL Made-It and return with a club-friendly trap anthem. But with “HUMBLE.,” the lead single from DAMN, fans got just that. Showcasing a streamlined sound compared to his usual style, Kendrick implores the world to sit down and be humble, delivering a sharp critique of flex culture and the celebrity life that surrounds him. But it’s a combination that spoke to fans, and “HUMBLE.” still stands as Kendrick’s most-streamed song to date.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,197,285,013\n\nFun Fact: “HUMBLE.” became Kendrick Lamar’s first No. 1 hit, as well as Mike Will Made-It’s second after Rae Sremmurd’s ultra viral “Black Beatles.”\n\n15. Kanye West ft. Kid Cudi – “Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1”\n\nGood Music/Def Jam Recordings, 2016\n\nProduced by: Kanye West, MIKE DEAN, Rick Rubin, Metro Boomin, DJDS, Allen Ritter, Noah Goldstein\n\nRap’s vanguard had changed by 2016, but with The Life of Pablo, Ye— known then as Kanye West—let it be known that his spot wasn’t up for grabs. “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” is an undisputed favorite from an album that’s brimming with an assortment of styles and inspired moments. Extending his reign as the premier A&R, Ye recruited Metro Boomin to body the beat, Kid Cudi to float on the chorus, and even Drake to provide the midas touch as a ghostwriter. A sensational hymn packed with glowing sound waves, the energy of the track is perfectly encapsulated in a viral clip that featured Ye, Cudi, Pusha T, and Travis Scott rejoicing to it at Madison Square Garden.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,079,172,885\n\nFun Fact: Kanye West called Metro Boomin and asked the producer to add his famed tag on the track in the middle of premiering The Life of Pablo during the Yeezy Season 3 fashion show at Madison Square Garden.\n\n14. Roddy Ricch – “The Box”\n\nAtlantic, 2019\n\nProduced by: 30 Roc, Datboisqueeze\n\nFrom the moment “The Box” dropped, it confirmed what many had already suspected about Roddy Ricch: that the Compton rapper was next in line to take his place among hip-hop’s royalty. Not just a show of his technical prowess as an emcee, “The Box” is a masterclass in songwriting and the dynamic qualities that separate great songs from good songs. Whether it’s the eerie atmosphere of the trap and drill-inflected beat, the chorus that gets catchier and catchier with each repeat listen, the constant switching up of flows by Roddy, or the now infamous “eee err” sound that Roddy added to the track with his own voice, these subtle qualities come together to give the instant classic an inimitable air.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,889,529,875\n\nFun Fact: The iconic squeak of “The Box,” which Roddy vocally created himself, was added after it was finished. It would help make “The Box” a viral smash, topping Billboard’s Hot 100 for 10 consecutive weeks to become one of the first bona fide TikTok hits.\n\n13. Travis Scott ft. Kendrick Lamar – “Goosebumps”\n\nCactus Jack Records/Epic Records, 2016\n\nProduced by: Cardo, CuBeatz, Yex\n\nTravis Scott has always had an ear for a great hook, but on “Goosebumps,” the Houston emcee set a high bar for himself that he may never top. It’s so magnetic, in fact, that from the moment it hits at the start of the song, it grabs you and never lets go, forcing an inspired guest verse from Kendrick Lamar and equally inspired beat from Cardo to step aside on the track. Still Travis’s most-streamed Spotify song ever with over 2 billion plays, “Goosebumps” will forever be one of the legacy-defining songs fans will remember generational icon by.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,361,310,109\n\nFun Fact: In 2017, Travis Scott broke the Guinness World Record for “Most Consecutive Performances of a Song” when he played “Goosebumps” 15 times in a row at a show.\n\n12. Future – “Mask Off”\n\nA1/Freebandz/Epic Records, 2017\n\nProduced by: Metro Boomin\n\nIn the wake of an acrimonious divorce, Future went on a tear in 2015, mining his hurt feelings, addiction demons, and nihilism as inspiration for a run of classic releases Beast Mode, 56 Nights, Monster, and DS2. The trap legend then used the momentum from that creative outburst to craft the biggest hit of his career in “Mask Off.” Playing out like a more upbeat sequel to “The Percocet & Stripper Joint,” the song represents the evolutionary moment when the debaucherous Future fully embraces his villain role, unbothered with what a single other person thinks.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,577,516,369\n\nFun Fact: The video for “Mask Off” features Amber Rose as Future’s leading lady.\n\n11. XXXTENTACION – “Jocelyn Flores”\n\nBad Vibes Forever/EMPIRE, 2017\n\nProduced by: Potsu\n\nPrior to the release of “Jocelyn Flores,” XXXTENTACION’s music was frequently labeled as emo, but also loud, aggressive, angry, and distorted. But this song in particular showcased a quieter, softer sound from the late rapper. Using a sample from Potsu’s lo-fi hit “i’m closing my eyes” as the backdrop for his musical narrative, he recounts an interaction with a fan that ultimately ended in tragedy. Reflecting on what went wrong and the grief and self-loathing that followed, X ultimately reveals the dynamism that made him a star.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,168,580,379\n\nFun Fact: This multiplatinum-selling track is from X’s debut studio album, 17. With over 2 billion streams, it’s among the most-streamed rap songs in Spotify history. Upon its release, it entered Billboard’s Hot 100 chart at No. 31. Following X’s death, the track re-entered the chart and peaked at No. 19.\n\n10. Juice WRLD – “Lucid Dreams”\n\nGrade A Productions LLC/Interscope, 2018\n\nProduced by: Nick Mira\n\nAlong with contemporaries Lil Peep and XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD helped lead the charge of emo rap pioneers who left an indelible mark on hip-hop in the streaming era. Inspired by pop punk and emo bands like Panic At The Disco! and My Chemical Romance, it was his single “Lucid Dreams” that would catapult the artist from internet curiosity to hip-hop legend.\n\nThe Chicago rapper is magnetic over the Nick Mira–produced track, which samples a Sting guitar loop, as he lets out a torrent of feelings about a relationship gone bad. Initially garnering millions of streams as a self-released single in 2017, “Lucid Dreams” would experience an exponentially larger wave of success after Juice WRLD rereleased the single with major-label backing. It eventually became one of Spotify’s most-streamed songs, with over 2.5 billion plays.\n\nBut like his fellow emo rap pioneers, Juice WRLD’s success was cut short. His untimely death in 2019 left behind a short but impactful legacy that continues to reverberate through the rap world.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,528,373,906\n\nFun Fact: Sting, whose “Shape Of My Heart” is sampled in “Lucid Dreams,” has said Juice WRLD’s song is his favorite reworking.\n\n9. Pop Smoke – “Dior”\n\nVictor Victor/Republic, 2019\n\nProduced by: 808 Melo\n\nNew York hadn’t had a signature sound in almost two decades when Brooklyn drill began to rise in popularity. Drill originated in Chicago and later reemerged in London, but New York—especially Brooklyn—has since become synonymous with the new iteration of the subgenre. Pop Smoke quickly cemented himself as the face of the burgeoning movement with his 2019 debut mixtape, Meet the Woo, which featured fan favorites “Welcome to the Party” and “Dior.”\n\nDrill is typically known for its graphic depiction of street life, but “Dior,” aside from a few menacing bars, represented the more festive side of the music. Pop was tragically killed in a home invasion before he had a chance to live up to his full potential, but the Brooklynite posthumously became a legend. “Dior” became a hit in the wake of his untimely death and soundtracked the Black Lives Matter movement during widespread protests in the summer of 2020.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,060,034,928\n\nFun Fact: “Dior” appears on Pop’s Meet the Woo and Meet the Woo 2 mixtapes.\n\n8. Sheck Wes – “Mo Bamba”\n\nCactus Jack/Interscope, 2017\n\nProduced by: Take A Daytrip\n\nCacophony has never sounded this good. Travis Scott protégé Sheck Wes made a name for himself when he released one of the most riotous songs in recent memory. “Mo Bamba” is unorthodox in a rap context and even more unconventional by pop standards. Sheck chants every line of the song over Take A Daytrip’s chords, which sound like the middle ground between harmony and dissonance. (Dance producer Zedd and Fool’s Gold founder A-Trak once debated the musical merits of the song in an epic Twitter thread.)\n\nThe song reflects a streaming trend where slow-burner hits reach their commercial breakthrough months, sometimes even years, after initial release. “Mo Bamba” came out on Spotify on June 6, 2017, but didn’t gain significant traction until early 2018. The song became an underground favorite with tastemaker crowds in New York City and, later, LA and London, before becoming a mainstream hit globally.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,048,591,297\n\nFun Fact: The song is titled after Sheck’s childhood friend who was a center at the University of Texas at the time of its release. Mo Bamba is now a six-year NBA pro who has played with the Orlando Magic, LA Lakers, and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n7. Travis Scott – “SICKO MODE”\n\nCactus Jack/Epic, 2018\n\nProduced by: Hit-Boy, Tay Keith, MIKE DEAN, Chahayed, Oz, CuBeatz\n\nTravis Scott finally reached commercial success to match his cultural cachet with his third album, ASTROWORLD. The album’s centerpiece, “SICKO MODE,” is an unconventional hit—a three-part song with no chorus and two mood-changing beat switches. Travis typically uses melody or some kind of vocal effect on his songs, but here he employs a more traditional rap delivery over neck-snapping production. “Was off the Remy, had a Papoose,” he raps on one of two verses during the middle part of the track.\n\nThe song concludes with Drake’s rapping for the final 90 seconds, and many believe that Drake mentions his once rumored, never materialized deal with Adidas in the aftermath of his battle with Pusha T, stating, “Checks over stripes.” “SICKO MODE” quickly became a sensation despite its lack of structure, earning Travis his first No.1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 and popularizing beat switches in rap songs.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,117,746,870\n\nFun Fact: Drake isn’t listed as a featured artist, which means he wasn’t credited when the song reached No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100. A “SICKO MODE” credit would give Drake a total of 14 No.1 songs on the Hot 100—one more than Michael Jackson.\n\n6. Migos ft. Lil Uzi Vert – “Bad and Boujee”\n\nQuality Control Music, 2016\n\nProduced by: G Koop, Metro Boomin\n\nMigos didn’t miss on Culture, a 13-track memento that symbolized the modern-day pinnacle of trap music. On the album’s lead single, “Bad and Boujee,” Metro Boomin and G Koop join forces to craft a thunderous soundscape that’s equally gooey and eruptive. Offset’s flammable chorus and verse, both equipped with his signature comic book ad-libs, are persuasive. Quavo’s addition finds him barring up with chantable lyrics, similar to how he approaches the group’s hooks. And the third slot, which was usually reserved for Takeoff (R.I.P.), is filled by Lil Uzi Vert who, in real time, was transitioning from SoundCloud favorite to national force.\n\n“Bad and Boujee” reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and on its way up dethroned Ed Sheeran’s global smash “Shape of You.” That feat alone showcased the growing commercialization of street music and helped to further solidify Atlanta’s dominance in this era of rap. Adding to the record’s legacy, the music video attracted over a billion views and stamped Rubi Rose as the video vixen of the moment. Donald Glover underscored the cultural impact of “Bad and Boujee,” a steamroller of a song in any context, when he thanked the group for releasing the song as he received a Golden Globe award for his show Atlanta in 2017. Real recognizes real.\n\nSpotify Streams: 932,536,187\n\nFun Fact: “Bad and Boujee” was the first No.1 for both the 300 Entertainment and Quality Control Music labels.\n\n5. Future – “March Madness”\n\nEpic Records/Freebandz Entertainment, 2015\n\nProduced by: Tarantino\n\nIf “Mask Off” represents the commercial peak of Future’s 2010s rap reign, “March Madness” exists as Future’s creative achievement of that era. But there was almost a reality in which the song was lost forever.\n\nAfter Future’s close collaborator DJ ESCO was jailed in Abu Dhabi while carrying a hard drive with hundreds of songs the pair had worked on, the two worried that years worth of work would be lost forever. But once Esco was released and the hard drive returned intact, the decision was made to take the best songs of the bunch and release it as 56 Nights—a nod to the amount of time Esco spent in prison.\n\n“March Madness” was one of those songs they recovered, and even without its epic origin story, it still ranks as one of the greatest hip-hop songs of the streaming era. Combining the radio-friendly polish of Pluto with the raw aggression of Monster, the end result is a melodic sledgehammer that feels like the platonic ideal of a Future release.\n\nSpotify Streams: 167,771,580\n\nFun Fact: Tarantino made this beat in 20 minutes while sitting in his sister’s Chicago kitchen. “March Madness” didn’t make the initial cut on 56 Nights, but the song was so good that Future decided to throw it on the tracklist.\n\n4. Lil Uzi Vert – “XO Tour Llif3”\n\nGeneration Now/Atlantic, 2017\n\nProduced by: J.W. Lucas, TM88\n\nOn the surface, Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3” might seem like an exuberant rap masterpiece armed with a sweeping hook purpose-built to sing along with. But lurking beneath that pop sheen is the rapper’s existential struggle to balance their rising fame and success with the stress of a fading relationship.\n\nIt’s this tension throughout the song that makes “XO Tour Llif3” such a compelling listen, daring anyone not to nod their head as Uzi pours their heart out on the track. Adding to the allure is the autobiographical nature of the song, which gave fans more than a glimpse into Uzi’s well-publicized breakup with lyrics that are unflinchingly honest at times, and shrouded in mystery at others.\n\nUltimately, “XO Tour Llif3” is a song built for all occasions: equally suited for an aux takeover at a party, or being alone at home, trying to figure out what Uzi really means when they say “all my friends are dead.”\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,103,458,383\n\nFun Fact: Producer TM88 told Complex that he lost a laptop full of beats after he found himself in the midst of a mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in 2017. He tried to remake some of those beats later, one of which would go on to become “XO Tour Llif3.”\n\n3. Drake – “God’s Plan”\n\nYoung Money/Cash Money/Republic, 2018\n\nProduced by: Cardo, Yung Exclusive, Boi-1da, Noah “40” Shebib\n\nDrake is the most ubiquitous hitmaker in hip-hop history. The Toronto native scored his first Billboard hit with “Best I Ever Had” in 2009 and never looked back. Drizzy spent the next eight years flooding the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 430 consecutive weeks until he took a breather in the summer of 2017.\n\nThe short break coincided with chatter that his fiercest competitor, Kendrick Lamar, had seized hip-hop’s throne with the blockbuster success of his fourth studio album, DAMN. Drake responded with an onslaught of smash hits, starting with “God’s Plan.” The single, released in January 2018, debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed at the top for 10 additional weeks. The song is one of the better musical snapshots of Drake as an artist. Throughout the song, he seamlessly covers the spectrum between rapping and singing, sometimes offering both extremes in the span of a few lines.\n\n“God’s Plan” set the table for the release of the multiplatinum Scorpion, which also featured No.1 hits “Nice For What” and “In My Feelings,” helping Drake reclaim his spot as the game’s top rapper and the Michael Jackson of streaming.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,511,743,548\n\nFun Fact: “God’s Plan” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks and was replaced by Drake’s “Nice For What.” Drake stayed at No.1 on the Hot 100 for 29 weeks in 2018. He broke the record for the most weeks at No.1 in a single year. Usher previously owned the record with 28 weeks at No.1.\n\n2. Cardi B – “Bodak Yellow”\n\nAtlantic, 2017\n\nProduced by: J White Did It\n\nCardi B’s rise to superstardom is one of the most unlikely success stories of the 2010s. The Bronx native always exuded New York charm, but there was no precedent for an Instagram personality turned reality TV star then becoming a rap star when she first attempted to jump-start her music career.\n\nCardi dropped three mixtapes to little fanfare between 2016 and 2017—though the Offset-assisted “Lick” generated moderate traction. But the transformative “Bodak Yellow” changed the course of hip-hop for years to come. Inspired by Kodak Black’s “No Flockin,” the song showcases a newly invigorated Cardi delivering quotable after quotable over J. White Did It’s hypnotic loop. Cardi even taps into the brutal honesty and sense of humor that made her so endearing to audiences: “Got a bag and fixed my teeth,” she raps on the second verse.\n\n“Bodak” continued to build on a growing trend. The tried-and-true radio formula—the rap single with an R&B hook—was losing its effectiveness as streaming was becoming a mainstream medium. Songs like Migos’s “Bad and Boujee” as well as “Bodak” signaled the arrival of a new formula: the streaming-friendly single with rap verses, hooks, and trap production as the foundation.\n\n“Bodak” quickly became an anthem and unseated Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. The song set the table for Cardi to release her multiplatinum debut album, Invasion of Privacy, in 2018. The blockbuster album opened up the field for women and made it possible for artists like Megan Thee Stallion, Doja Cat, Ice Spice, Latto, and more to enjoy commercial success simultaneously, ushering in a new golden age for female rappers.\n\nSpotify Streams: 890,123,178\n\nFun Fact: “Bodak Yellow” was the first song by a solo female rapper to reach No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 since Ms. Lauryn Hill‘s “Doo Wop (That Thing)” in 1998. It’s also the first song by a female rapper to be certified diamond by the RIAA.\n\n1. Kendrick Lamar – “Alright”\n\nTDE/Aftermath/Interscope, 2015\n\nProduced by: Pharrell Williams, Sounwave\n\nPublic Enemy’s Chuck D famously described hip-hop as the CNN of the ghetto, a vehicle rappers used to document their hardships and speak out against oppressive systems. But hip-hop had primarily become a form of escapism by the mid-2010s. The unprosecuted police killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice—in the span of four months in 2014—angered the Black community, but the fallout of those traumatic events went largely unaddressed in rap music.\n\nKendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly was one of the few albums of the time to respond to the social climate. The album’s fourth single, “Alright,” is a bit of a rap anomaly—a social commentary that doubles as a club banger. K. Dot weaves introspection into two stream-of-consciousness verses over perhaps the jazziest trap beat ever made.\n\nKendrick echoes his community’s sentiments on police brutality during the pre-chorus: “And we hate po-po, wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho,” he raps. But it’s the song’s refrain that gave people hope and helped elevate “Alright” into a modern-day civil rights anthem. The song became a staple during protests as the Black Lives Matter movement grew in influence—half a decade before artists released an influx of protest songs in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the civil unrest of 2020.\n\nSpotify Streams: 685,577,168\n\nFun Fact: “Alright” marked the second collaboration between Kendrick Lamar and Pharrell Williams; they previously worked together on good kid, m.A.A.d. city’s “good kid.”"
