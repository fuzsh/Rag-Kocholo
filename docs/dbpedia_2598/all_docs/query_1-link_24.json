        "text": "Rap fans tend to get into arguments with other rap fans, and it doesn't take much more than someone declaring their Favorite Rapper. Your favorite rapper is a personal preference, one that requires the most subjective defenses. If you’re rooting for the rookie of the year or a washed-up veteran experiencing a career resurgence or someone no one has heard of as your favorite, then so be it. The choice is yours.\n\nThe favorite rapper discussion is cool and all, but the coveted distinction in hip-hop is still being named the GOAT (Greatest of All Time). Rookies and new jacks need not apply—this debate is strictly for the catalog artists, people who have shifted the culture in previously unmovable ways, artists whose music has permeated and resonated over an extended period of time. It’s rap’s imaginary Hall of Fame, existing only within the abstract conversations we have about it.\n\nBut there is one debate that every rap fan not only loves to have but ought to have. A debate that considers both the short-term and long-term implications of an artist’s impact. A debate that pits a rapper in their prime against any and all competitors. A debate that gawks at the cultural landscape and plucks out the one who stands alone: the debate about who is the Best Rapper Alive. Being the BRA is sort of like being the MVP—even though rap doesn’t follow a rigid cultural calendar quite like major sports seasons—because it only requires looking at the current crop of active artists and picking a winner. You can confidently declare the Best Rapper Alive in any given year without having to consider previous decades, the same way you can say LeBron is an MVP even though you’ve never seen Jerry West play.\n\nAnyone can become the Best Rapper Alive. Some came out the gate with next-level rhymes that had everyone running back to the lab; for others it was a culmination of their gifts that coalesced for one great year. Much like rap itself, it’s an evolving process. But one thing we know for sure, it’s more about a general feeling among fans rather than any discernible facts. (What facts? It’s all just opinion anyway.) When a rapper steps in front of a microphone, and everyone in hip-hop has no choice but to look their way and give props, well then, they just might be the Best Rapper Alive.\n\nIt’s still important to consider that the Best Rapper Alive debate is different from the GOAT conversation. Being the BRA doesn’t mean you’re the biggest or the most successful; it just means you're the Best at one particular moment. Of course in hip-hop, being the best is intrinsically about being BIG. And being at your best doesn’t make you the best, so if your prime coincides with someone else’s, well, hey, there’s always next year.\n\nYou can look back on the hip-hop terrain with 20/20 hindsight, tally up the votes, and declare the GOATs, but the Best Rapper Alive from year to year is a feeling in the moment. There have been debates among rap fans living in that moment since the early days of hip-hop, but those discussions have never been properly cataloged—until now! (Yeah, we're excited. Sue us.) Complex is proud to present the Best Rapper Alive, Every Year Since 1979, a comprehensive look back at every year of rap and which MC moved the crowd the most. So the question remains: Who got the props?\n\nIllustrations by Dale Edwin Murray (@demillustration) and more.\n\n2023: J. Cole\n\nCREDENTIALS: Dominating over a dozen standout features across several genres, including “First Person Shooter,” “The Secret Recipe,” “All My Life,” “Evil Ways,” “Thanks,” “On My Block,” “Passport Bros,” and more. His Billboard No. 1 song with Drake, “First Person Shooter.”\n\nComplex’s Best Rapper Alive is an all-encompassing title. An artist must be able to retain the attention of their core audience and demand the attention of the rap world at large by being unparalleled at the art of rhyme spitting. In 2023, J. Cole used his boundless lyrical ability to cash in his dollar and a dream do just that. His bars weren’t just creative; they felt like writing exercises where he used each new verse to try something new. It’s fitting that he opened the year by rapping over a “J. Cole type beat” off YouTube. On the “Procrastination” loosie, he was looking for something to ignite his creative spirit, and apparently, he found it for his strongest guest feature rampage yet.\n\nCole managed to assert his dominance and showcase his lyrical prowess without even putting out a solo album. On the 13 songs that Cole appeared in 2023, he always delivered the track’s best performance, even when rapping with fellow heavyweights like Drake, Lil Durk, and Lil Yachty. Every new Cole verse was a moment that had the rap world buzzing, and he was able to do this in several genres, from Afrobeats and R&B to K-pop, and trap. The list is exhaustive: Summer Walker’s “To Summer, From Cole (Audio Hug)” and Nicki Minaj’s “Let Me Calm Down” are love ballads. Lil Durk’s “All My Life” is an inspirational song for the streets. Drake’s “First Person Shooter” is a blockbuster hit record.\n\nAnd it’s not just who J. Cole was out-rapping in 2023, but how he was doing it. Complex named his verse on Lil Yachty’s “The Secret Recipe” the best rap verse of the year, thanks to his technical prowess of maintaining the same tail rhyme through the entire two-minute verse with even more impressive wordplay. His double entendre of “My greatest flex is that I made a milli', feel like I'm Bangladesh” (a play on Lil Wayne’s “A Milli” producer’s name) set rap Twitter on fire. He also dominated the conversation on “First Person Shooter,” with his performance rippling through the internet and spawning an entire segment on the Joe Budden Podcast about how Drake got cooked on the track.\n\nA running narrative from 2015 to 2018 was that J. Cole was a lone wolf after 2014 Forest Hills Drive went triple platinum with no features. Since then, he has received his one and only Grammy from a feature with 21 Savage on “A Lot” and earned his first Billboard No. 1 record thanks to his show-stopping performance on “First Person Shooter.” He’s shown that he can be both an album artist and a hired assassin if the situation demands.\n\nIt’s easy for an artist with Cole’s pedigree to rest on his laurels after being dominant in the game for so long, but the Carolina rapper is wired differently. In Applying Pressure, the documentary Cole released to accompany his 2021 album The Off-Season, he asked himself: “Are you OK with getting comfortable, chilling, mailing it in, waiting around on inspiration? [...] Did you leave no stone unturned creatively?” His answer: “Nah, I’m not cool with that.” In 2023, Cole demonstrated what that means to him, and the energy he’s bringing to prove it. There are no limits to what a dreamer can do. —Jordan Rose\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Gunna, Doja Cat, Killer Mike\n\nGunna had a wildly improbable 2023. After taking an Alford plea in the ongoing YSL RICO trial, the rap world turned its back on him, and instead of folding under the weight of public scrutiny, he used that pressure to create a diamond of an album in A Gift & a Curse. The project was single-handedly able to quiet many of the narratives around the Atlanta rapper. Between the club staple Song of the Summer contender “fukumean,” lyrically impressive “back at it,” and emotionally heavy “bread and butter,” Gunna let the music do the talking and produced the best album of the year. And as he expresses on the album’s outro, “If y’all talk to my dog, just tell him I miss him.” Even with the challenging year he had, Gunna still found a way to rise above it all and showcase how talent can ring louder than negative narratives.\n\nComing off a strong 2021 that was punctuated with the critically acclaimed Planet Her, Doja Cat returned in 2023 with Scarlet, a more rap-oriented album that still demonstrated how deep her musical pocket is. “Paint the Town Red” became Doja’s second Billboard No. 1 record, and her first solo No. 1, and it also made history as the first solo female rap song to top both the U.S. and Global Spotify top 50 charts. Scarlet was also sonically diverse, with nostalgically hazy songs like “Agora Hills” paired with gritty rap songs like “WYM Freestyle.” Even with the challenges Doja Cat faced throughout the year, she was still one of the best rappers of the year and continuously showcased her ability to create unique worlds with her music at its core.\n\nAtlanta is the most dominant city in rap right now, with a vibrant crop of young artists setting the bar for hip-hop, but in 2023, Killer Mike proved that he can still hang with the young gunners and elevate his lyrical prowess even further. Michael was one of the best pure rap albums to come out last year, and that is in large part thanks to Killer Mike’s ability to weave personal storytelling with elite beat selection that gave his prophetic tales of rags to riches a modern twist. The album reflects different hues of rap, like the standout track “Scientists & Engineers,” which features ATL royalty with André 3000, Mike, and Future taking turns over a electronic-infused beat in their own way. “Turning back the clock” is a phrase that’s often used to describe when rappers of a certain age perform at a high level in the current era, but that doesn’t apply to Killer Mike. As someone who has been chronicling his experiences through rhyme for several decades, his impressive 2023 was simply par for the course—a testament to being able to write and rewrite your story as many times as you want when passion drives you. —Jordan Rose\n\n2022: 21 Savage\n\nCREDENTIALS: Her Loss & over a dozen standout features, including “Jimmy Cooks,” “Cash In Cash Out,” “Surround Sound”\n\nIt’s fun when the villain wins; heroes want too much. They require praise for their accomplishments, but 21 Savage is wired differently. Being hailed Complex’s best rapper of 2022 was scribed in stone by dagger thanks to his upward trajectory over the last five years following his last solo album, I Am > I Was, but he didn’t see it coming.\n\n“Everything just be happening naturally,” Savage tells Complex when discussing the title. “I don’t know what it is or why, but it always just falls into place.”\n\nThe difference between the Atlanta rapper and your typical supervillain, though, is that Savage doesn’t move like he has a master plan. 21 Savage’s career trajectory last year was just as unconventional as he is. The Atlanta rapper didn’t release a solo album, go on a massive tour, or make any record-breaking numbers. Instead, he consistently and efficiently delivered high-level bars on every single track he showed up on as a guest feature—all 15 of them. Each performance was varied and unique—from matching JID’s lyrical savvy on “Surround Sound,” to complementing Tyler, the Creator’s bombastic energy on “Cash In Cash Out,” and anchoring several tracks on Metro Boomin’s album Heroes & Villains. He also delivered the best verse on our song of the year, Drake’s “Jimmy Cooks.”\n\nThat now-famous outro foreshadowed and solidified the magic that union held. Her Loss is what propelled 21 Savage into mainstream consciousness this year. On paper, nothing about the partnership makes sense—Drake is an over-calculating Lover Boy and Savage is a stone-cold Slaughter Gang CEO. Yet somehow, thanks to Drake’s tactfulness and 21’s penchant for cold-blooded rhymes, the album solidified their electric dynamic and proved that the Savage Mode rapper could hold his own with one of the biggest artists in the world. Some may argue that 21 took a backseat on the project, but in reality, he balanced every track thanks to his slippery wordplay and sinister delivery. “I don’t think too hard when I’m making music, it just comes naturally,” he says. Drake makes you comfortable with a melodic hook just so Savage can deliver the killing blow with his bars. For every pop-centric “Jumbotron Shit Poppin” led by Drake, there is a menacing “Broke Boys” or “More M’s” anchored by Savage.\n\nThe music industry wants us to see street rappers as one-dimensional, but there is so much more to 21 Savage than what meets the eye. He carries himself with a placid demeanor, yet belts R&B slow jams on Instagram Live. His violent bars can send shivers down your spine, but they speak to very real, bleak circumstances that he’s escaped and many still have to face. Savage doesn’t try to make the slums seem shiny or the mud look like marble. He speaks for the multifaceted trappers with monotone veracity and shows us that the streets do not exist as a monolith. That’s his golden quality.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Pusha T, Kendrick Lamar, Drake\n\nIn 2022, Kendrick Lamar emerged from the wilderness as a new man. Many expected the Pulitzer Prize winner’s fifth studio album to continue the societal examination he began on DAMN. Instead, Kendrick peered entirely inward; Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers is focused on what Dot learned about himself over the last four years (or 1,459 days) rather than the world around him. The album was endearing (and even relatable to some) in that way, and introduced many to the benefits of therapy, a taboo subject in the Black community. Emotionally heavy tracks like “Father Time” and “Mother I Sober” are balanced with hits like “N95” and “Die Hard,” proving that Kendrick can still command a moment even when he’s just putting his therapy notes to wax. Coupled with his Big Steppers world tour, the expansion of pgLang, and the further development of Baby Keem, Kendrick made a successful return in 2022.\n\nWhenever Pusha T drops, the rap world is put on notice. “It’s Almost Dry” refers to how a painter describes their masterpiece before it’s completed. Oftentimes, there’s a difference between being the greatest and being a master, and Push has mastered his craft. For most other rappers, it would be impossible to meet the lofty expectations set by an arguably perfect album like Daytona, but It’s Almost Dry is another masterclass performance from the Virginia Beach artist, showcasing both his creativity in coke bars and versatility in beat selection. He holds his own with Hov on “Neck and Wrist,” and brings his brother No Malice out of retirement to have him deliver one of the best verses of the year on “I Pray For You.” At this point in his career, Push is only in competition with himself, and he can’t lose.\n\nAnd, lastly, seldom does a year go by when Drake isn’t at least considered for this accolade. The Boy has shattered streaming statistics, collected awards (including four Grammys), and stood at the forefront of pop culture for the better half of the last decade. One of the biggest criticisms of Drake’s catalog is that he sacrifices album cohesion in order to include something for everybody on records. With Honestly, Nevermind, the rapper finally made an album that went beyond people-pleasing, and it turned out to be one of his best projects in recent years. He then managed to keep his rap fans fed by releasing Her Loss with 21 Savage. Yet, somehow, a relaxed year for Drake still consists of two No. 1 albums. The perils of being at the top. —Jordan Rose\n\n2021: Tyler, The Creator\n\nCREDENTIALS: Call Me If You Get Lost\n\nTyler, The Creator didn’t become the Best Rapper Alive overnight. He’s not on this list because of a debut album that immediately took over the charts, a viral craze, or a trendy sound. Instead, Tyler Gregory Okonma played the long game, and after a decade of putting in groundwork, he became the best rapper of the year on his own terms.\n\nTo understand the year Tyler had in 2021, you have to remember how his career started back in 2011. His breakout single, “Yonkers,” was going viral before anyone even used that word, and his Odd Future crew was scaring the hell out of parents everywhere (much to the delight of their rebellious teenage children). Tyler was a cockroach-eating, ski-mask-wearing ringleader who yelled about burning shit and liked to tweet all-caps declarations about his goal to “scare the fuck out of old white fucking people that live in middle fucking America.”\n\nWith a start like that, Tyler could have suffered the fate of so many flash-in-the-pan artists who burned too hot out of the gate and couldn’t turn initial shock value into a sustainable career. But he was already thinking ahead. Tweeting hints and predictions about the things he would ultimately achieve a decade later, he put his head down and started building one of the most fiercely loyal fanbases in rap. This gave him the luxury of not chasing trends or contorting himself to mainstream sounds, and enabled him to focus instead on what he does best: world-building. Each of his first seven full-length projects existed in their own worlds, as Tyler sharpened his skillset with each release. By the time he made it to Flower Boy and IGOR, his genre-bending sound had strayed so far from traditional rap that even he admitted his 2020 Best Rap Album Grammy for IGOR was strangely categorized and “felt like a backhanded compliment.” As 2021 began, he was a respected artist and producer, but some people had forgotten just how well he could rap (and at least one rap veteran dismissed his music as “mysterious”). On cue, he dropped the best rap album of the year and completely flipped that narrative on its head.\n\nCall Me If You Get Lost is a lot of things. It’s a DJ Drama-narrated Gangsta Grillz tape. It’s a playground for some of the most unique voices in rap—Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, NBA YoungBoy, and others—to experiment in thrilling ways. It’s a soundtrack to globe-trotting adventures. And, most importantly, it’s an excuse for Tyler to rap his ass off and show his range as an MC. On “Massa,” he takes a trip down memory lane, reflecting on his career with self-aware bars that give a raw, unfiltered peek into his psyche. On “Lemonhead,” he boasts about Pateks and luxury vehicles, pulling off one of the hardest rap songs of the year. And on the eight-minute centerpiece of the album, “Wilshire,” he weaves together a confessional, stream-of-consciousness story about a failed romance. In between it all, there’s a whole lot of shit-talking—Tyler knows he’s on top of his game, and he’ll happily remind you of that fact over and over.\n\nA decade into his career, it seems Tyler can achieve anything he sets his mind to. As he explains in the intro of “Runitup,” he’s operating on a higher level than anyone else right now, and he has the confidence to try anything. On Flower Boy and IGOR, that meant making genre-fluid albums that blended influences from jazz, neo soul, synth funk, pop, and hip-hop. Tyler’s hunger for new sounds and genres even brought him to the point where he said he fell out of love with rapping (“I hate rapping, only because it puts you in this box,” he told Larry King in 2014). But in the months leading up to the making of Call Me If You Get Lost, he found the spark again. Putting his full attention on rap for the first time in years, he delivered the most focused, technically impressive album of his career so far. It’s anyone’s guess what sound he’ll decide to tackle on his next album, but for now, one thing’s clear: Tyler, The Creator was the best rapper of 2021. —Eric Skelton\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Kanye West, J. Cole, Mach-Hommy\n\nIn 2021, culture was as fractured as ever. Everyone was watching different TV shows at different times, listening to different albums on different streaming services, and arguing about world events from different perspectives. But there’s one artist who was able to cut through the noise and command the entire music world’s attention at once: Kanye West. Creating his 10th studio album, Donda, in front of the world and hosting livestreamed listening sessions in stadiums across the country, he pulled off the kind of must-see TV that we hadn’t experienced in years. Whether you loved it or hated it, you tuned in (and loudly shared your opinions online). By the time Donda finally hit streaming services, Kanye proved the whole thing was more than just a spectacle. It’s his best album in years, featuring some of the most sturdy rapping (“Off the Grid,” “Lord I Need You”), impressive orchestration (“Come to Life”), and memorable guest performances (Fivio Foreign, André 3000) of 2021. Kanye’s still got it.\n\nCole approached his sixth studio album like an off-season workout, putting parameters in place to test his own skills and coax the same level of hunger out of himself that he felt in his early mixtape days. Inviting some of the game’s best workout partners to join, including 21 Savage and Lil Baby, he freed himself from the confines of a concept album, and focused on the fundamentals. In other words, he put all of his attention on simply rapping as well as possible. It worked. The Off-Season proved, once again, that Jermaine Cole is one of the best rappers alive.\n\nMach-Hommy didn’t sell as many records as the rest of the artists on this list, and he’s not yet a household name. In fact, he doesn’t even like showing his face, and details about his day-to-day life are scarce. But he made two of the best rap albums of the year (Pray for Haiti and Balens Cho), and he represents an important subsection of artists who are vital to the 2021 rap landscape, even if they don’t top Billboard charts. Alongside rappers like Griselda’s Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine, Mach-Hommy is doubling down on lyricism and delivering meticulously crafted songs that appeal to rap traditionalists while still pushing boundaries in their own ways. Mach-Hommy probably doesn’t give a fuck about a list like this, but he deserves a mention on it anyway. —Eric Skelton\n\n2020: Lil Baby\n\nCREDENTIALS: The most-consumed album of 2020 (My Turn), a two-time Grammy-nominated single (“The Bigger Picture”)\n\nIn early 2020, just a few years after Young Thug handed over a stack of cash and encouraged him to seriously pursue a rap career, Lil Baby sensed he was about to level up. After releasing seven projects between 2017 and 2018, he had pumped the brakes in 2019 and directed his focus on perfecting an album that would undeniably establish his place in rap’s highest ranks. Wasting no time in 2020, he dropped a pre-album single called “Sum 2 Prove” on the ninth day of the year, showing his hunger as he rapped about how “by time I get 40, I gotta be one of them greats.” Less than two months later, the album arrived, and he gave it a name worthy of the moment: My Turn. “I feel like everybody else had a lil’ turn,” he explained. “It’s my turn now.”\n\nHis intuition was right. Not only was My Turn the most commercially successful rap album of the year, it was the most-consumed album of any genre in 2020. Even traditional pop powerhouses like Taylor Swift couldn’t keep up with Lil Baby once My Turn arrived. Impressively, he accomplished this without bending to the whims of the pop ecosystem. Instead of going out and getting out-of-place guest features from the Adam Levines of the world in an attempt to chase streaming numbers, he put his head down and perfected his sound alongside a core group of inner-circle collaborators like Young Thug, Gunna, and 42 Dugg. He reached superstardom on his own terms.\n\nThere’s a reason My Turn was streamed more than any other album in 2020. Lil Baby makes music that works in all kinds of situations. If you put a song like “Emotionally Scarred” on at a party, his swift, catchy flow over Twysted Genius’ bass-heavy production will keep people moving. And if you play the same song in your headphones at home, you’ll pick up on the more subtle nuances of Lil Baby’s songwriting technicality, as he raps about cutting off all his friends and being there for his son. With a closer listen, his deceptively effective turns of phrase jump out at you, like, “I can't move around without tools, these n****s loose screws.” And in an exhausting year like 2020, lines like “I’m tired of being tired of being tired” turned out to be even more relatable than he might have imagined when he first wrote them.\n\nIn a year dominated by COVID-19, a time in which everyone’s plans were flipped upside down, Lil Baby managed to be remarkably consistent. After releasing My Turn in late February, he and his team devised a plan to keep dropping singles, music videos, and guest features throughout the year. He even pulled off the rare feat of releasing a deluxe version of the album that was actually worth listening to. It was highlighted by the 42 Dugg-assisted cut “We Paid,” a top-10 entry on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that received critical praise and even inspired an enthusiastic tweet from Tyler, the Creator, who described it as “the core of rap music.” He also dished out over 20 guest verses, jumping on songs with everyone from Pop Smoke (“For the Night”) to Lil Wayne (“I Do It”) to Future and Drake (“Life Is Good (Remix)”).\n\n“I consider myself a right-now rapper,” Lil Baby recently told The Breakfast Club. “Most of the time, my music is going to be about what’s going on right now.” True to his word, four months after releasing My Turn, he dropped Complex’s pick for the best song of 2020, “The Bigger Picture,” a track that was released in the midst of nationwide protests calling for justice after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and many other Black people. The overtly political nature of the track surprised some casual fans, but it wasn’t as strong of a departure from his other material as many may have thought. Lil Baby has always reflected the reality of society through his own autobiographical stories, touching on themes of racial profiling on earlier songs like “Catch the Sun.” As he told Vanity Fair, “Damn near every song I speak on the police or police brutality. I’m a product of that before George Floyd, before rap, before anything.”\n\nDuring an interview about being named the Best Rapper Alive, Lil Baby told Complex he thinks Lil Wayne is the best rapper of all time. That shouldn’t come as a major surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on Lil Baby’s career, as he follows in the stylistic lineage of rappers like Wayne and Young Thug. With each project, though, Lil Baby has further carved out his own lane. Sanding off some of Thug’s wild eccentricities in favor of a relatively more direct and to-the-point songwriting approach, Baby has developed his own unique style and perspective in a short amount of time. He has honed a dexterous storytelling style that sets him apart from his influences, proving that he’s no longer just a promising upstart in the shadow of heavyweights. Standing on his own footing as one of rap’s newest superstars, he’s now positioned to put on his own protégés, like 42 Dugg and Rylo Rodriguez.\n\nLess than five years after starting to rap, Lil Baby is only getting better. Speaking with Complex, he revealed, “I still don’t feel like I’ve mastered my craft, even with My Turn,” adding, “I’m still in the learning process.” We might just be seeing the beginning of Lil Baby’s dominance. No matter what happens from here, though, his run in 2020 will always be remembered as a true breakthrough moment when he reached the heights of rap success. However you want to look at it, Lil Baby was the best rapper of the year. —Eric Skelton\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Freddie Gibbs, Lil Uzi Vert, Benny the Butcher\n\nBefore the release of Alfredo, Freddie Gibbs told Complex the album was “going to be a classic,” claiming, “These are some of the best raps I ever did.” Freddie’s brash confidence has a lot to do with what makes him such a magnetic rapper, and this particular declaration packed an extra punch because it turned out to be correct. Alfredo, his collaborative album with The Alchemist, was one of the very best rap albums of the year, yielding dozens of exceptional moments, including the best verse of the year on “1985.” Freddie’s lethal combination of lyrical dexterity, a sharp sense of humor, and endless charisma makes him the total package, and paired with the beatmaking prowess of Alchemist, he made some of the best music of his career. Somehow, Freddie Gibbs keeps one-upping himself year after year.\n\nIt takes a special kind of rapper to delay an album for years, build up an impossibly high level of anticipation, and then actually deliver on the hype. As we all know by now, though, Lil Uzi Vert is anything but an ordinary rapper. For years, he’s been telling us he’s from outer space, and after hearing what he accomplished on Eternal Atake, we’re starting to believe every word he says. During a year in which many of us were looking for an escape from reality, Uzi took us on a trip far away from Earth, to a world where life’s biggest problems are a little more manageable. As he laments on “Celebration Station,” “I can't do my dance ’cause my pants, they from France.” Playfully rapping about how he “lives life like a cartoon,” Uzi leaned into his eccentricities and delivered an album that no one else could have possibly executed, while also reminding everyone of his deceptively sharp skills as an MC on songs like “Baby Pluto” and “Silly Watch.” Then, as if that weren’t enough, he dropped a deluxe version that doubled as a whole other album, followed by a collaborative project with Future. After three quiet years, Uzi more than made up for lost time in 2020.\n\nExplaining the story behind the title of his 2020 album, Burden of Proof, Benny the Butcher told Complex, “I’m telling people, ‘I’m a legend now.’ I’m trying to prove that with these albums, with the work that I’m putting in, with the legacy I’m leaving.” It’s difficult to think of a better way to accomplish that lofty goal than linking with someone like Hit-Boy to fully produce your album. In the midst of a phenomenal run with his Griselda crewmates, Benny was faced with high expectations for Burden of Proof, and he more than delivered. From the first line of the first verse of the first song (“Last year was about branding, this one’s about expanding”), the Buffalo rapper was clear about his intentions. Delivering gritty, autobiographical raps with his usual braggadocio over a collection of hard-hitting Hit-Boy beats peppered with soulful flourishes, Benny made one of the best top-to-bottom rap albums of the year. Go ahead and put Burden of Proof on without worrying about the need to skip any songs, and then sit back and marvel at what he was able to accomplish in 2020. After a year like this, Benny might be feeling that burden a little less. —Eric Skelton\n\n2019: DaBaby\n\nCREDENTIALS: Baby on Baby, KIRK\n\nIn the opening weeks of 2019, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” was picking up momentum on TikTok, Post Malone and Swae Lee had the highest-charting rap song in the country, and the early pick among industry experts for rap’s Rookie of the Year was a soulful young artist named YNW Melly. Every A&R in the country was desperate to sign the next melodic rapper, and the sound of hip-hop was evolving at an accelerated pace. But, as we all learned in physics class, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nUnconcerned with the melodic trends of the moment, a fresh new face from Charlotte named DaBaby confidently zigged when everyone else was zagging. On March 1, he dropped a bomb with Baby on Baby, a 13-track project full of hard-hitting rap songs that knifed through a sea of sing-song rappers. Cut from the same cloth as traditional rap superstars like 50 Cent and Ludacris, who combined powerful vocal deliveries with oversize personalities, DaBaby emerged as a fully formed artist, armed with cartoonish catchphrases, witty songwriting, and a reputation for wildly entertaining music videos.\n\nMost importantly, he turned heads by simply rapping his ass off. We often throw around the word “urgency” when describing great artists, but DaBaby really raps like his life depends on it—he rarely has the patience to wait more than just a few seconds before barking his opening lines. Attacking beats like a heavyweight fighter who overwhelms opponents with repeated blows to the body, DaBaby hit listeners over the head with a barrage of cocksure one-liners that might sound ridiculous coming from a rapper with less tenacity. But when one of the most confident rappers alive says something like, “I’m in the rental truck sticked up like Walker Texas Ranger/I’m on my grind like fuck a bitch, I’ll get some pussy later,” you believe him. On Baby on Baby, he focused in on a few tried-and-true lyrical themes—his own sexual prowess, a ballooning bank account, and a scrappy refusal ever to back down from a fight—and spun out an endless stream of self-assured proclamations. He was really goin’ baby.\n\nIf he’d stopped with just one project, DaBaby would have likely ended 2019 as rap’s Rookie of the Year, but he wanted more. Heavyweights like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole were each taking the year off, so why not set his sights on 2019’s throne? First, he assumed his new role as the year’s go-to rapper for guest features (“Cash Shit,” “Under the Sun,” “Stop Snitchin,” “Hot Shower”). Then, working through personal turmoil that included the death of his father, DaBaby kept his foot on the gas and released another project, KIRK, just six months after he dropped Baby on Baby. This time, he used “INTRO” to showcase lyrical versatility, lowering his guard to write a deeply personal song about family tragedy and the complications of fame. The rest of the album presented an opportunity to pack in as many hits as possible. All 13 songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100, including the second-biggest song of his career, “BOP.” With KIRK, DaBaby proved he was able to repeat his first taste of success, blowing past any concerns of a sophomore slump, as he established himself among rap’s elite.\n\nWith the level of success that DaBaby saw in 2019, there were bound to be detractors. But the only real criticism, musically at least, came from listeners who argued that he often used the same flow. As he pointed out in interviews, though, “When you got a sound that don’t sound like nobody else and it’s brand new, you’ve got to feed it to ’em.” Sure, hits like “Suge,” “BOP,” and “VIBEZ” relied on similar vocal deliveries and rhyme schemes, but anyone who dug deeper in his catalog could see he had range. On DaBaby’s best guest verse of the year, “Under the Sun,” he ditched his signature ad-libs and bent his flow to match a more patient, soulful beat than we were used to hearing him rap over. And on the aforementioned “INTRO,” he pushed himself beyond his usual formula, both stylistically and thematically. Unbothered by the criticism, DaBaby later pointed out that he’s “laughing to the bank every week” and happily cashing checks from his winning formula.\n\nBeyond the piles of money he stacked all year, DaBaby has another metric on his side: Billboard charts. He ended 2019 with 22 total Hot 100 entries, which is more than any other artist, regardless of genre. He also had two top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 (including one chart-topper), five gold records, and two platinum records. In an era where everyone is obsessed with raw data, DaBaby looks as good on paper as anyone. The Best Rapper Alive needs to be firing on all cylinders when it comes to impact, technical skill, cultural relevance, and overall quality of music, and DaBaby emphatically checked each box. He wasn’t just an exciting new face in 2019; he became an undeniable star with a bulletproof resume. —ES\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Young Thug, Benny the Butcher, Freddie Gibbs\n\nIn 2019, Thugger finally realized his potential when it comes to commercial success. After all the styles he’s influenced, the highly touted projects he’s dropped (including collaborations like Rich Gang: Tha Tour Pt. 1), and the number of bangers he’s put out since arriving on the scene, this was the year he finally earned his first No. 1 album. But commercial success never tells the whole story. So Much Fun was great because it was one of his most focused and cohesive projects yet, and the James Brown of rap was able to double down on his signature, forward-thinking style without making compromises. His influence on this era of rap was already undeniable, and now he’s getting his flowers. With more momentum behind him than ever, it seems we’ll be in for more classic material from Jeffrey in the upcoming years.\n\nNext up is Benny the Butcher. What a run Griselda has been on, huh? They followed up a strong 2018 with an even better 2019 and Benny was the main catalyst. He’s no longer the group’s secret weapon like he once proclaimed himself to be, and Tana Talk 3 and The Plugs I Met saw him go toe to toe with lyrical heavyweights like Black Thought, Royce da 5’9,” Pusha-T, and Conway the Machine. The jewels he drops about his street tales are only comparable to JAY, Push, and Ross. But his bars aren’t as luxurious as those guys’—Benny comes from a different place. You can hear the pain and the wisdom in his delivery, and that’s the real reason the streets have connected to him and the Griselda crew the way that they have.\n\nGangsta Gibbs has now given us two gems alongside Madlib the Loop Digga, mixing his Gary, Indiana traphouse raps with the legendary producer’s penchant for crate-digging. Madlib either finds samples nobody has or flips the usual suspects in ways that haven’t been done before. Bandana was the year’s best rap album, front to back, and it brought lyrical content and a “traditional” hip-hop sound to the forefront. In this era of so many rappers chasing the trend of melodic, minimalist raps and the same Travis Scott-sounding trap beats, MadGibbs went the other way. Madlib’s production did Freddie proper by not drowning out or overpowering what he had to say, making Gibbs the star of the show. As each beat comes in, Gibbs cocks back and lets it rip with lines like, “Fuck the 40 acres and the mule, they gave us niggas the evils/Hot pots, spoons, and needles,” on “Palmolive,” and, “I done walked through hell in these size 12s/Speak it from my own mouth before I let the time tell,” on “Fake Names.” Freddie’s own life reflects the black experience, as his rhymes replaced the audio clips of black comedians and black power speeches Madlib has used in his many beat tapes. Freddie’s effortless style, coupled with Madlib’s production, has finally crossed over to the mainstream, and the game will be much better for it. —Angel Diaz\n\n2018: Pusha T\n\nCREDENTIALS: Best Rap Album Grammy nomination for DAYTONA, Complex’s Best Album of 2018, “The Story of Adidon”\n\nThen David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.”- 1 Samuel 17:45-46\n\nDavid slayed the giant Goliath with fearlessness and a stone. We all know the story, whether we’ve read the Bible or not. It’s a reference we lean on whenever an underdog does the unthinkable. Finally, after years of baiting rap’s biggest star, Pusha-T battled Drake and won. Except those of us who had been following Push’s career since we banged the “Grindin’” beat on lunch tables weren’t surprised. The Virginia-by-way-of-the-Bronx MC has been an elite lyricist for decades, never losing a step or forgetting the rules of the game. Even if those who come down from their ivory towers and try to dictate those rules whenever it suits them (as Drake attempted to do) are constantly moving the goalposts.\n\nWhat’s ironic about Push’s year in 2018 is that “The Story of Adidon” was just icing on the cake—or at least that’s what hindsight tells me. DAYTONA is flawless, a seven-track opus made specifically for those in the know. It’s his Reasonable Doubt. His third studio album is straight to the point like his raps, loaded with quotables that would’ve been highlighted in TheSource, had the project come out two decades ago. Kanye’s production serves as the organ player to Push’s coke-fueled sermons. No song on the project embodies that dynamic better than its most underrated track, “Come Back Baby.”\n\nI was lucky enough to hear this particular song early. I was in my motherland of Puerto Rico for the first time in my life. We sat in the parking lot, blowing it down, drunk, with bellies full of mamposteao, when the homie decided to give me a sneak peak. I shit you not, I felt like I was in church, and the weed began to smell like the incense in a thurible. Almost a year later, that King Hannibal gospel/funk sample still brings me closer to God. But Push thinks more highly of “Games We Play.”\n\n“I think ‘Games We Play’ is the best hip-hop song of 2018,” he tells Complex after learning he’s been crowned 2018’s Best Rapper Alive. “That is the best pure hip-hop record of 2018, by far. I don’t know if there’s a better marriage of beats and lyricism.”\n\nLike every rapper of his ilk, King Push has never been humble when it comes to his bars. And he’s never been shy about throwing shots at your favorite rappers in the name of sport.\n\nHe lured Drake for years, most notably with the 2012 subfest that was “Exodus 23:1,” where he came at Drake and Lil Wayne for being led astray by Birdman, two years before Weezy called his longtime label boss out on Twitter.\n\n“Contract all fucked up/I guess that means you all fucked up/You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga/That’s signed to three niggas, now that’s bad luck/Damn, that shit even the odds now/You better off selling this hard now.”\n\nThe beef finally boiled over on the weekend DAYTONA dropped. Most of us thought nothing of the shots Push took at Cash Money on the album’s final track, “Infrared,” but Drake noticed, and finally took the bait. He fired back at Push on his release day with “Duppy Freestyle,” effectively shifting the conversation during DAYTONA’s rollout. Many jaws (including my own) dropped to the floor when we heard Drake’s vitriol. Never had he gone at another rapper the way he did Push on “Duppy.” Aubrey was sick of the ghostwriter shots and years of slick jabs at the hands of Terrence. Finally, Drake had removed the thorn in his side, swiftly swatting away a rapper who had been beneath him for nearly a decade, in terms of mainstream success.\n\nAnd then, five days after the body shot that was “Duppy Freestyle,” Pusha returned, stone and sling in tow, and slayed Goliath with one of the most maniacal, strategic, and disrespectful diss records in recorded rap’s 40-year history. “The Story of Adidon” included multiple revelations, most notably that Drake had a secret child. As if that wasn’t enough, the cover art was an actual photo of Drake in blackface. And the “The Story of O.J.” beat was just…*chef’s kiss*.\n\n“Adidon” hurt the Toronto rapper to his core, causing him to hit the eject button on an Adidas campaign centered around his son, go on HBO to spew propaganda, and allegedly offer six figures for any dirt he could find on Push. Goliath was brought back down to Earth, a humbling experience, to say the least. The sales are still there—they will always be—but the perception among rap fans who matter will be forever tainted.\n\nDrake’s fall from grace was so embarrassing that it seems like, just a few weeks ago, he was still trying to gather intel on Push. Pusha clarified his tweeted warning (“You tried, you failed...I’m hearing you wanna try again”) by telling us, “Man, I think people got that tweet a little misconstrued. I don’t know why anyone ever said that was about music. I never said that.”\n\nAnd with that, I leave you with this Bible quote from the Book of Exodus, Chapter 23, Verse 1:\n\n“Do not spread false reports. Do not help a guilty person by being a malicious witness.”\n\nThe truth hurts. —Angel Diaz\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: J. Cole, Drake, Travis Scott\n\n2018 will be remembered as the year J. Cole took control of his own narrative. When the year began, teenagers at SoundCloud rap shows were still yelling “Fuck J. Cole” and making memes about his laundry rhymes. Then he dropped his most mature and complete work to date, KOD, an album that found Cole sharpening his pen while transitioning to the “big homie” phase of his career. A month later, he sat down for a conversation with Lil Pump, earning back some respect from the genre’s youngest stars (and quieting those “Fuck J. Cole” chants). Image intact, he set out to flip a longstanding myth that he’s a “no features” lone wolf who avoids collaboration. Jumping on songs with everyone from 6lack to Anderson .Paak, Cole made it clear that he can excel far outside the context of his own carefully constructed, self-produced albums. “OK no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album/You know what the outcome will be,” he rapped alongside 21 Savage on “a lot,” before flipping the script on everyone: “It’s got to the point that these rappers don’t even like rappin’ with me.” For years, we’ve known J. Cole could rap with the best artists on the planet, but in 2018 he finally shed some lingering stigmas that were holding him back. Now, it’s undeniable: J. Cole is one of the best rappers alive.\n\nIn more ways than one, 2018 was a disappointing year for Drake. After coming out swinging with back-to-back No. 1 singles, \"Nice for What\" and “God’s Plan,” he seemed well on his way to a career year. Then he poked a bear (Pusha-T), and the world found out he was hiding a child. Instead of responding directly, he countered with Scorpion, a 25-song double album that didn’t live up to high expectations. But even in an off year, Drake dominated the charts and managed to make his mark on 2018’s defining moments: His name appears on seven of Complex’s 25 best tracks of the year. 2018’s greatest song, “Sicko Mode,” wouldn’t have been nearly as special if it weren’t for Drake’s gift of delivering immediately repeatable (and memeable) gems while dropping intricate subliminals that would provide fodder for wild Twitter conspiracy threads. Once again, he proved he has a better grasp than anyone of making music designed for internet consumption—even during a moment in which public opinion had swayed against him for the first time. In 2018, one thing became clear: We can never count Drake out.\n\nThe notion of including Travis Scott on a Best Rapper Alive list caused so much debate in the Complex office that we had to call an emergency meeting. What are the qualifications to be considered a great rapper in 2018? Should the honor go to a lyrically driven artist with an unmatched pen, like Roc Marciano? Or should innovation and overall song-making abilities hold just as much weight as intricate rhyme schemes? Bar for bar, no one is arguing that Travis Scott was the best lyricist of 2018, and he doesn’t fit in the neatly defined package of what many hip-hop traditionalists look for in their favorite rappers. But he embodies exactly what the best rappers have always been about: a relentless drive to push boundaries.\n\nIn a decade, when we think of the albums that defined 2018 and shifted the genre, we’ll think of ASTROWORLD. As the expensive, ethereal spirit of “Stop Trying to Be God” transitions into a mosh pit anthem on “No Bystanders” (which features some of the best rapping of his career), you have to stop and appreciate how Travis has taken the momentum from every artist who came before him on this list and spun it into something new. Throughout ASTROWORLD, he tips his hat to acts like Three 6 Mafia, Goodie Mobb, and the Beastie Boys while recontextualizing their sounds in a way that works within the Travis Scott universe. Washed in Auto-Tune and delivered with an emphasis on tone-setting, his vocals are used in ways that wouldn’t have made sense 10 years ago. Working in the parameters of a genre that was born from a need to make something new out of existing materials, Travis Scott is leading the way for another generation and shifting the idea of the skill set that making great rap music requires. For that, he’ll be remembered as one of the best rappers of 2018. —Eric Skelton\n\n2017: Kendrick Lamar\n\nCREDENTIALS: No. 1 album debut, first solo single to hit No. 1, four Grammys\n\n\"To be the man, you got to beat the man.\" — Ric Flair\n\nDepending on how you viewed it, To Pimp a Butterfly was one of two things. To most, Kendrick's third full-length was the moment in which he bucked the mainstream and decided to follow his vision to create an abrasive, yet important, piece of art that spoke viscerally about the issues he believed to be afflicting the group of people with which he most closely identified.\n\nTo others, it was a tacit admission that, up until that point, when it came to creating popular rap music, he just wasn't up the task. As much as TPAB was discussed and debated—much to the delight, we're sure, of Kendrick, who said the album would wind up on university syllabi—it didn’t make much of a dent in the marketplace. It went platinum, but it sold less than Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, and only one single managed to crack the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nFor comparison’s sake, that same year Drake dropped two albums, each debuting at number one, each pregnant with hits that would dominate the charts, radio, playlists, and commercials for the entire year.\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly and the album of outtakes that followed it were such aberrations from the center of rap that many wondered if Kendrick would ever return. Would he even continue to rap? Would he strike out as a jazz fusion artist? Would he take up spoken word full time? Would he ever answer the shots taken at him by Big Sean and Drake? Would he focus his time on more pressing issues and, by default, cede the crown to one of the aforementioned competitors? Did he even give a fuck about being the best rapper alive?\n\nAfter a varied series of guest appearances, on March 23, 2017 we finally got our answer via “The Heart Part IV,” on which Kendrick addressed his doubtful, slick-talking peers, comforted his worried fans, and staked his claim as the king.\n\nI put my foot on the gas, head on the floor\n\nHoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll\n\nYellin', \"One, two, three, four, five\n\nI am the greatest rapper alive\"\n\nNot only that, he announced that he was coming right back with another album that would further solidify his place in the game. And DAMN. did just that. This isn’t another experimental project meant to be debated and discussed in barbershops and on rap forums. DAMN., with production from Mike-Will Made, Sounwave, DJ Dhahi, 9th Wonder, and the Alchemist, and MCing from the legendary DJ Kid Capri, is meant to be bumped everywhere you listened to hot shit. It literally has something for everyone.\n\nTo run rap, you have to create music that applies to a multitude of scenarios and situations. You can’t be the best rapper alive if all you make is music that’s meant to be bumped in headphones. Or that only sounds good at ear-piercing decibels. Or lyrics that are better read on computer screens than recited back to you by rabid fans. Kendrick had all of that, and more. “HUMBLE.,” the first single from the album, and Kendrick’s first solo number one song, was a bop-inducing ditty that was immensely rappable thanks to its simple earworm of a chorus. It was like a photonegative of “The Blacker the Berry.”\n\nEven more remarkable was that Kendrick seemingly conceded very little—if anything—creatively to make this album (which also debuted at number one) work. Yes, Rihanna and U2 are on the album, but it still features the same heady computation of the world and its inhabitants and institutions as heard on TPAB. Only this time the beats are banging in a way that’s closer to the center of rap. Or, put another way, they’re productions you could imagine his competition vying to use.\n\nSure, DAMN. could be seen as a tacit admission that the direction he had hoped to explore with his previous work wasn’t as commercially viable as he hoped. Or it could be seen as him deciding to follow his ambition to beat his contemporaries in their own arena. No matter how you view it, Kendrick Lamar proved himself to be the best rapper alive. —Damien Scott\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Jay-Z, Cardi B, Future\n\nWhen it comes to pure artistic achievement, there was only one person sparring with Kendrick for the title of Best Rapper Alive last year. Jay-Z, weary and wiser for it, returned with an album that had no right to be the masterclass that it is. 4:44 doesn’t have the number one hits, the dazzling pyrotechnics, or the naked competitiveness that Kendrick brings to bear on DAMN. Instead, Jay acts his age—something we’ve never seen before, from any rapper. The result is a focused statement from a man trying to get you to listen and, more importantly, understand. Much was made of this being Jay’s apology album—it was, but it was much more than that. It’s the kind of album artists can usually only make at the beginning of their careers, jam-packed with every thought careening around their head, a definitive personal statement with the air of a conversation. In this case, you listen because it’s album number 13, and he’s not supposed to have anything left to say.\n\nIf Jay was interested in showing off he’s made it clear that he could still give anyone in the game—Kendrick included—a run for their money. Instead, he opted to make songs that sigh instead of roar. It was the right decision.\n\nWhile K. Dot and Jay circled rap’s best album, Cardi B loudly dominated 2017. For those really in the know, this might have been expected. She’d long been the center of attention, mapping out a path to success from a strip club to Instagram to TV. Her leap to music was audacious, but it made sense that she would eventually reach new heights. For the uninitiated, Cardi B emerged, fully-formed, into a universe that she seemingly controlled through sheer force of will and an elementally magnetic personality. She reminded us that rap is a game of characters. Outsized, real figures, and it’s there that Cardi B truly excels. It’s impossible to stop watching her—she’s compulsively relatable, outspoken to a fault, and is something of an apex predator in the Instagram Era of rap personalities.\n\nOf course, that would be nothing without good music. The jump from celebrity to rapper—a real jump that amounted to more than flash-in-the-pan attention—is a risky, improbable one. Cardi B has made it, sure-footed, thanks to a concentrated, three minute and 44 second-long distillation of her appeal called “Bodak Yellow.” It was a breakout hit—inescapable in New York for the entirety of the summer—eventually reaching number one on the Billboard charts (and unseating Taylor Swift on its way). More impressive than its commercial success, though, was how confidently it was pulled off. Despite quibbling claims of stolen flows (a kind of borrowing that’s both foundational to hip-hop and nodded to in the song’s title), “Bodak” is the Cardi show from start to finish. The song is stunningly charming and even more catchy—it’s Cardi to the core, which is why it achieved the success it did. “Bodak Yellow” was both an introduction and definitive statement, and the rare debut smash hit that serves as an announcement, not a career peak.\n\nWhile Cardi’s rise took most of 2017 to gestate, Future opted to announce his presence straight out of the gate. Always a prolific studio rat, known for resuscitating his career by furiously distributing street rap that was better than any of his peers’, the surprise release of FUTURE was not actually a surprise. That’s what Future does: drop great music on a whim. What was surprising was what people latched onto as the album’s biggest hit: “Mask Off,” a pan flute-led, laconic piece of trap music that set off thousands of memes and more parties. What was even more surprising happened the week after FUTURE, when Nayvadius dropped HNDRXX.\n\nIf Future had made the prospect of a surprise album something closer to an expectation, he blew the concept out of the water when he did it twice in two weeks. More impressive than the sheer productivity, though, was how assured the two projects were. This wasn’t a song dump, generated to flood the market, but a calculated attack on two fronts. The design became clear when the projects were laid out together: FUTURE the brutalist, scorched-earth piece of bass-boosted antagonism that took Future’s hard-won persona to its logical extreme, and HNDRXX the formally inventive peeling back of layers to hint at some empathy behind the mirrored sunglasses, as well as an artistic path forward for one of rap’s best songwriters. —Brendan Klinkenberg\n\n2016: Chance the Rapper\n\nCREDENTIALS:Coloring Book, “Ultralight Beam,” live performances on Saturday Night Live and at the ESPYs, Magnificent Coloring Day Festival, staying independent\n\nThe good guys are supposed to be boring.\n\nChance the Rapper opens Coloring Book with a declaration: His life is good. He’s got a girl, and a child, and he’s happy. He bellows, almost embarrassingly earnest, about what he has to be thankful for. It’s triumphant and euphoric, over brass backing and the cooing of mentor Kanye West.\n\nThis shouldn’t work. Great art, we’re told, is rarely made by the good guys, the happy or the content. Ambition isn’t measured in what you have, it’s striving for what you want. Hip-hop is for those strivers, and braggadocio is rarely applied to things so pedestrian. Unless you’re Chance.\n\nI’m not pointing this out to suggest something as anodyne as Chance’s potential importance as a role model, or the part joyous music can play while the world burns around us. Instead, Chance’s persona is impressive because Chance has created a world for himself, out of the unlikeliest of parts, and 2016 was the year we all began living in it with him. He went from outsider to the center of the rap universe. He had the best verse of the year (on “Ultralight Beam”), arguably the best full-length—I mean, “mixtape”—and seems committed to a level of artistry few can match time he performs. And he did it while remaining his own goofy, good-hearted, Christian self—an archetype we haven’t seen in hip-hop before, and an innovation in and of itself.\n\nThe sound of Coloring Book—and of Chance the Rapper, writ large—is one of openness. He’s excited about his life, and wants you to be excited about your life, too. But, more than that, he’s trying to bottle up that feeling. He’s trying to evoke exactly what his particular brand of happiness—one colored by empathy and nostalgia as much as pure moment-to-moment joy—feels like musically. And over the past few years, he’s come thrillingly close.\n\nHe’s carved a sound—major chords and warm keyboards and stuttering drums—that’s entirely and recognizably his own. Coloring Book didn’t arrive fully-formed; Chance has been shaping his unique brand of music since 2012’s 10 Day, refining what his artistry means and sounds like with his close-knit band the Social Experiment for years. This album, though, was where everything cohered. His rapping is instinctual, bounding from carefully measured measured bars and wordplay to rapturous and guttural expressionism. Not since Kanye West has a rapper so plainly attempted to put every feeling they had into their music.\n\nIn the process, he’s emerged as one of the savviest music industry players in an unstable environment. In 2016, several artists used the still-nascent streaming economy to their advantage, getting ahead of the sea change the music industry’s long been struggling with. Drake signed up with Apple Music, getting millions of dollars and billions of streams in the process. Frank Ocean, with some deft maneuvering that’s remained largely under the table, slid his way out of his label contract and released Blonde independently, for which streaming accounted for most of its listens. Chance, too, is at the forefront of a new kind of music industry—but he was the only one to predict it first.\n\nFor likely close to half a decade, Chance has been fending off label offers, even when the career path seemed hazy and the potential for failure seemed, to everyone but him, great. Instead, he was the first to figure out how the artist succeeds with the internet, rather than in spite of it. His other releases were completely independent, and his latest came with a partnership—like Drake’s and Frank’s—with Apple Music, which in its ambitions to corner the streaming market has begun operating as a de facto Medici family for artists like Chance. If that deal were to dry up tomorrow, though, Chance has proved he is nimble and inventive enough to handle any changes, and has a rabid fanbase that will follow him anywhere he chooses to go. It’s not Jay Z-style moguldom; it’s something more modest than that. Something we haven’t seen before. —Brendan Klinkenberg\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Q-Tip, Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug\n\nIn Sept. 1991, Q-Tip rapped that “the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead.” He delivered the line in the same verse, on “Jazz (We’ve Got),” that saw him explain “the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21,” which is how old he was at the time. Twenty-five years later, at 46, Q-Tip brought the members of A Tribe Called Quest together to record a new album. During that process, in March, founding member Phife Dawg passed away. But Tip and Jarobi and Ali Shaheed Muhammad didn’t forget their jobs, and in November they released We Got It From Here...Thank You 4 Your Service, the final Tribe album. They resurrected the dead.\n\nThe album is a miracle, in large part because of Tip’s rapping. In his post-Tribe solo work he explored the possibilities of a more jazz and scat-inflected style, and the results sounded less written and more like tossed off freestyles than the brilliant displays of rhyme found on those early Tribe albums. Not here, though. He obviously had things he needed to say—about his country, about music, about aging, about friends, present and lost—and his lyrics sounded more deliberate and calculated than they had in years. This focus resulted in finely crafted verses like his contribution to “Lost Somebody,” in which he memorializes Phife and tries to explain the sometimes coarse texture of their long relationship. “Malik, I would treat you like little brother, that would give you fits/Sometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit,” he raps, nearly out of breath but still enunciating. As youth-driven as hip-hop is, Tip’s performance in 2016 showed that it’s possible to make adult rap, sober and frank, that’s just as urgent and vital as the energetic displays of the genre’s youngest innovators.\n\nKendrick Lamar didn’t release career-defining work in 2016, like he did in 2015 and 2012, with To Pimp a Butterfly and good kid, m.A.A.d city, respectively. Instead, Untitled Unmastered, a rough collection of apparent studio leftovers, felt of a piece with the storm of jazz and American turmoil that produced Butterfly. Many of the songs were studio-cemented versions of live late-night performances; many of those songs were brilliant. They left no doubt that Kendrick is one of the best rappers in the genre’s history, but they didn’t deepen his story or lead the listener down a new, surprising path.\n\nElsewhere, he contributed verses to songs from Beyoncé, Danny Brown, A Tribe Called Quest, the Weeknd, Travis Scott, Kanye West, DJ Khaled, Maroon 5, Sia, BJ the Chicago Kid, and Isaiah Rashad, among others. Of those, “Really Doe,” “Goosebumps,” “No More Parties in L.A.,” “Holy Key,” and “Wat’s Wrong” were most deserving of praise, but none felt essential. It’s hard to imagine that he’d perform any of them during a show of his own in five years, the way certain guest features of, say, Jay’s have penetrated his solo catalog. In some ways, Kendrick Lamar was in cruise control in 2016. But what was startling is that his cruise control output now matches other rappers' career-making years.\n\nYoung Thug may never be the best rapper alive for as long as he raps, but that’s in keeping with his artistic mission. Unlike Kendrick Lamar, who raps at a scholarly level, armed with history and precedent, Thug raps to complicate the act itself. What he does under the banner of hip-hop—toying with song structure, exploding his voice—prompts critics and listeners to coin words and subgenres. Still, in 2016 he released some of his most streamlined projects to date. Slime Season 3 and Jeffery in particular are compact machines, with so many strange twists and turns jammed into eight or ten track releases, like the exposed motherboard of a pocket-sized device. Songs like “With Them,” “Drippin,” “Webbie,” “Kanye West,” and “Pick Up the Phone” are crammed with creative turns of phrase, off-the-wall flows, and brief moments that would be hooks for less adventurous artists. There’s no telling if this year will go down as the first sign of Thug trending toward more steady, stabilized musical output, or if his focus and stability last year was itself an anomaly. That sort of unpredictability is very much keeping in the spirit of Young Thug. —Ross Scarano\n\n2015: Drake\n\nCREDENTIALS: Two No. 1 debuts (If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, What a Time to Be Alive with Future), first-ever Grammy-nominated diss track in “Back to Back,”“Hotline Bling” highest-charting solo single (tied with “Best I Ever Had”), launched OVO Sound Radio on Beats 1, guest verses on “Blessings,”“Where Ya At,” “R.I.C.O.,” “100”\n\n“I need acknowledgment. If I got it, then tell me I got it, then.” Well, Drake, as far as 2015 is concerned, you had it. Those bars come from a song on What a Time to Be Alive, the second surprise “mixtape” he dropped this year via Apple, with whom he closed a deal that netted him a reported $19 million haul and a bi-weekly radio show streamed to dozens of countries. It’s been a blockbuster year for the Boy for sure. And that’s without mentioning the rap beef that completely dominated the culture for a week and a half last summer and served as the centerpiece for quite possibly the biggest year of his career.\n\nMonths prior to Meek Mill’s attack on his credibility, Drake would release If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, a mix-album that overall contains a marked increase in aggressive content. In retrospect, “Worst Behavior” was the backdoor pilot to this sneering 6ix God among men. What’s irking him? We may never know, but listening to songs like “No Tellin” post Meek beef, his attitude is eerily prophetic. “I gotta keep watching for oppos, ’cause anything’s possible/There’s no code of ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you.” It’s like he knew a guy he’d just graced with a big feature verse for the second time would do a complete 180 and call him out for violating the one thing that matters in hip-hop: his authenticity. The accusation was shocking but more so was the imminent validity. The ghostwriter in question does exist; he is credited all over IYRTITL.\n\nInstead of copping pleas, Drake more or less copped to the accusations, dropped a laser-sharp diss track, and absorbed the whole incident as validating energy. If Drake was phased, we never saw it. The biggest rap star in the world shrugged a potentially damaging scandal off and added a new layer of invincibility to his armor. “You all looked in my face and hoped you could be the replacement.” Well, not so fast. “Back to Back” is the diss track that many weren’t sure he was capable of, biting in its “Takeover”-esque factual derisions yet crafted so precisely to be an undeniable club banger. And then quite casually, in the midst of an alpha male chest-thumping and questions of his viability, Drake dropped \"Hotline Bling,\" a song that was so undeniably Drake, and took it all the way to No. 2 on the charts.\n\nBut let’s get back to the bars. We may never know the specifics of Drake’s writing process, but if one thing out of the summer’s controversy was crystal clear, it was confirmation that Drake’s final touch is intangible. He’s become the arbiter of his era—a new Drake release brings with it an onslaught of new lexicon, inescapable across social media and even in regular conversation. Squads turned to woes. Cellphones don’t ring, they bling. His feature verses dominate even when others match his technical skill (see “Blessings”). And he’s approaching Jay Z levels of being able to ride any sonic wave and make it his own, word to the mutually beneficial aforementioned WATTBA, which was almost a 100 percent case of Drake adopting Future’s aesthetic. Future had a stellar year—but Drake gave him a plaque, on cruise control, no less. It’s quite clear who the Big Homie is. As artists push hip-hop to new soundscapes, Drizzy is displaying an efficiency at adapting, co-opting, and refining them for maximum appeal, all while he continues to push his own.\n\nMaybe that explains why, much like Kanye once said of Shawn, with Drake, you only saw the wins this year more than any other. “Back to Back” muted the ghostwriter talk all the way to the Grammys. Old foes bowed to him. Potential new ones are thinking twice. And he still hasn’t even dropped the project he’s comfortable with officially designating an album yet. Drake didn’t just hit an undeniable if not surprising peak in 2015—he became borderline infallible. The 6ix God ascended to Mount Olympus. How far away he is from the sun is anyone’s guess. —Frazier Tharpe\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:Future, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole\n\nOn Nov. 12, Future took the stage on Jimmy Kimmel Live and performed “Blow a Bag” and “Where Ya At.” It was odd timing as the album the songs are featured on came out in July. The performance with a live band proved muddier than expected, but the audience surprisingly didn’t mind or care and rapped every word back to him. The message couldn’t have been any clearer: Future is once again a star. All it took was a run that stretched back into 2014, featured three exemplary mixtapes with his closest and best collaborators, a No. 1 album that bested all of them, and another one-off project with Drake that all but hushed any lingering doubts about his prolificacy. Future had become a monster just as he predicted. He didn’t release, nor was he attached to, any pop-leaning, love-tinged singles. Instead all he released was therapeutic id. One of his best songs, “March Madness,” has him belting about having sex with women he really didn’t want to bed all because he was high as a giraffe’s ass. Other songs had him detailing that the reason he buys jewelry that mimics constellations and makes it rain when he’s in a club is to simply “hide the pain.” It’s all deep shit that, in the hands of any other MC, would make for super downer music. However, Future made us turn up all year long.\n\nThe only rapper talked about as much as Drake or Future in 2015 was Kendrick Lamar. He followed up his critically acclaimed major-label debut with, well, another critically acclaimed major-label album. Much has been written about To Pimp a Butterflyand the response the album garnered from fans, critics, DJs, and other musicians. If TPAB wasn’t the best rap album of the year, it’s tough to argue that it wasn’t the most important. It’s perhaps the most ambitious rap album of the past half decade. No other album this year made us look into ourselves as deeply or as far outwardly. It questioned nearly everything (blackness, whiteness, religion, social responsibility), which in turn made us question everything: the role of rappers, the role of rap music, respectability politics, the role of music press, the idea that art can be at once great and distasteful. The album cast a shadow over the entire year, out of which came one of 2015’s brightest gems: “Alright.”\n\nUnlike the aforementioned three, J. Cole was rarely talked about this year. His third album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, dropped in December of last year, and despite failing to birth any singles as big as Born Sinner’s “Power Trip,” it managed to sell 371,000 in its first week, notching Cole his third No. 1 album. Going into the new year, J. Cole embarked on a three-pronged global tour as headliner with Big Sean, Jeremih, and YG in tow. Elsewhere in 2015, Cole hopped on the official remix to Janet Jackson’s long-awaited comeback single, was asked by A Tribe Called Quest to remix “Can I Kick It?”, finally previewed what an album with Kendrick might sound like by dropping twin freestyles on Black Friday, signed two new artists to his Dreamville imprint, and released the label’s second compilation album. To top it all off, he signed a deal with HBO to air a documentary about his momentous tour. Without dropping a solo project in 2015, Cole managed to make more moves than nearly everyone save for Drake. Not bad company to be in. —Damien Scott\n\n2014: Nicki Minaj\n\nCREDENTIALS: The Pinkprint, a stream of remixes and loosies, first female rapper in 56 years to have four No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart\n\n“Now it’s me in my time, it’s just me in my prime.” That was the lie Nicki Minaj sold listeners on “I’m the Best,” the opening song on her 2010 debut album, Pink Friday. She was unmistakably good at the time, dropping one of the year’s best, if not the best, verses on Kanye West’s “Monster.” But Pink Friday was not a “mixtape Nicki” album, some one-note exercise in rappity-rap that could silence those who questioned her right to exist alongside her Cash Money brethren. Pink Friday … Roman Reloaded wasn’t that either, nor was The Re-Up, and even The Pinkprint refused to stay in a rap-only lane. Yet if by the end of 2014 you were still dissatisfied with Minaj’s rap output, still caught up waiting for the return of the mixtape messiah, then you just weren’t listening.\n\nThe Nicki Minaj who showed up to 2014 was battle-ready. Early on she took Young Thug’s “Danny Glover,” added bars as insulting as they were clever—“Hell of a livin’, you bitches on chitlins/When I come out of my mansion I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons”—and gave a second wind to a song from 2013. The vitriolic “Lookin’ Ass” was like duct tape over the mouths of anyone still crying for “mixtape Nicki,” and she hit with a closed fist on “Chiraq,” her flow low and measured. Even her sweetness was merely a means to hide something cantankerous as she nearly baby-talked the line “Wonder when they bite me/Do these bitches’ teeth hurt?” on the remix to Rae Sremmurd’s “No Flex Zone.” And of course, lest her lines were not enough to convince you that her value as a rapper had gone up, she had numbers for you, as she upped her \"50K for a verse\" on “Monster” to \"$250,000 for a verse\" on the remix to YG’s “My N***a.”\n\nMinaj had already released an album’s worth of material by the time The Pinkprint came out in December, yet she still had more to say. On her third album, she balanced her talent boasts and sex metaphors with details of her broken relationship and family concerns. Yes, the majority of the hooks on these songs were sung, as most hooks are, and she was joined by pop artists like Beyoncé and Ariana Grande, but Minaj used her verses to flaunt her versatility as a rapper. And instead of accomplishing that with fake voices and other gimmicks, she did it with varied flows, ranging from sing-song to pummeling, and lines as personal as they were provocative. She could go as pop as she wants, but for Minaj, it all returns to rap. Who knows what's next, but let 2014 be remembered as the year Roman retired, the wigs stayed in the box, and everyone learned that “mixtape Nicki” wasn’t back—she had never left. —Christine Werthman\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Drake, Young Thug, Killer Mike\n\nWhile Nicki controlled the year with the buildup to her album The Pinkprint, her Young Money counterpart Drake did the same with nothing more than the OVO SoundCloud. Throughout the year Drake would swoop in, drop a new song (or several), and basically nothing else in hip-hop would matter for the next few days. Drake confidently enjoyed another year of his prime by effortlessly communicating success (and its perils) with candor and wit.\n\nIn 2014, Young Thug went from a rapper to watch out for, to the guy who might have his career derailed before it could even begin, to a full-blown star. As soon as 2013 songs “Danny Glover” and “Stoner” cemented themselves as early 2014 anthems, complicated label issues threatened Thug’s ascent. Thankfully, Birdman stepped in, Rich Gang was formed, and Thugger ruled the summer with his first Top 40 hit, “Lifestyle.” Although Rich Gang’s Tha Tour Part 1 is the full-length project to go along with all the buzz, it doesn’t capture Thug in all his glory (“Lifestyle” isn’t even on it). To understand Thugger's appeal look no further than his verse on T.I.’s “About the Money.” The verse is much like Thug himself—wildly original and bursting with offbeat energy—and culminates with the typical Thuggerism: “I'm going fishing with these little bitty shrimp dips.”\n\nHe didn’t have the radio hits, club anthems, or nearly as much output as the aforementioned artists, yet Killer Mike was one of the most important voices in hip-hop. It’s not that Mike was that much better a rapper this year than in years past—he’s always been good. However, the stars finally aligned for critical darlings like Run the Jewels thanks to lackluster major label rap releases. With the #BlackLivesMatter movement taking off with nationwide protests against an unjust justice system, Mike’s furious delivery and intricate rhyme schemes became the soundtrack for a revolutionary mindstate. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2013: Kendrick Lamar\n\nCREDENTIALS: 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d city, guest verses for A$AP Rocky, Emeli Sandé, Young Jeezy, Jay Z got on the remix for \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\"\n\nKendrick Lamar spent most of 2012 crafting his masterful debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d. city, before dropping it toward the end of the year. The release of good kid cemented Kendrick's status as the Best Rapper Alive and earned comparisons to other legends who jump-started their careers with unforgettable major-label debuts. It wasn't just a great album, it was a great conceptual album with a storyline throughout—a Herculean hip-hop feat.\n\nAs the critical praise poured in and K-Dot fans supported their artist—a music-biz mantra that's more often said than followed—a mainstream audience slowly started to appreciate this West Coast rapper with left-field sensibilities to the point where hip-hop as a whole started looking at him differently. Nowadays, any 16 Kendrick spits—whether it be on an A$AP Rocky record or a random Dido feature—is worth everybody's attention. Kendrick's breakthrough comes at a time when rap fans are inundated with new rappers who overpopulate the blog posts; the few who are worth the time rarely (if ever) fulfill the promise of their initial offerings. But Kendrick lives up to all the hype.\n\nHis current statue isn't best explained in his raps but by an image: The cover art to the Jay Z-assisted \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe (Remix)\" featured a young Kobe standing next to an aging Jordan. No one thought the analogy was far off. Time for everybody to bow down to King Kendrick Lamar (ya bish)!\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Drake, Danny Brown, 2 Chainz\n\nThe year is still young. Will K-Dot's reign on top be shorter than leprechauns? For Drake, once again the throne is for the taking. His third album is on the way and songs like \"Started From the Bottom\" and \"5 AM in Toronto\" show that he can still turn it on like a light switch whenever he fancies.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Danny Brown, who has little mainstream recognition but has slowly built himself into a premier underground rapper. Fans continue to catch on to his 2011 album, XXX, and he keeps slaughtering guest spots. 2 Chainz is still riding high off the success of his debut album and newfound fame—the question remains if he can maintain his momentum. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2012: Drake\n\nCREDENTIALS: 2011's Take Care, barrage of guest verses: \"Stay Schemin',\"\"No Lie,\" \"Amen,\"\"Pop That,\"\"Fuckin' Problems\"\n\nEven in an off year, Drake was on one. Take Care dropped late in 2011, so Drizzy was able to ride excellent singles like \"HYFR,\"\"Take Care,\" and \"The Motto\" in 2012, which made him a consensus pick for Best Rapper Alive honors by themselves. And even without those songs Drake was still an omnipotent force in hip-hop who dominated the rap conversation.\n\nJay Z once boasted, \"For the right price I can even make yo shit tighter.\" In 2012, Drake didn't just make people's songs tighter, he became a kingmaker. Drizzy unleashed one monster guest verse after another and gave away Billboard hits that introduced buzzing artists to a wider audience. Rule of thumb: You're definitely in the Best Rapper Alive conversation if people will listen to any artist's song just because you're on it. And if you can make any song you're on a possible anthem, then you probably are the Best Rapper Alive.\n\nThere's a certain arrogance to the way Drizzy effortlessly bequeathed bangers to 2 Chainz, A$AP Rocky, and French Montana as if he had an endless stash of hits to give (who knows, maybe he does?). To understand his impact, consider that even throwaway lines like \"Good ain't good enough\" sparked intense debate about perceived shots at G.O.O.D. Music. More importantly, consider that if Drake had strapped together all his major guest verses and added a couple of strong solo cuts, he would've had a third album better than most rap releases last year.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross\n\nWe have no knock against Kendrick Lamar but are obliged to point out that he was relatively quiet for most of 2012 before dropping good kid, m.A.A.d. city. However, last year more and more fans got hip to his stellar 2011 release, Section.80. Still, most were left wondering if K-Dot could pull off a classic debut. But more on that later.\n\nMeanwhile, 2 Chainz' momentum from 2011's T.R.U. REALigion hit its mainstream peak in 2012 as casual fans got hip to \"Spend It.\" Chainz also went on a guest verse killing spree, which reached its climax when he spit the verse of the year on G.O.O.D. Music's \"Mercy\" and had Kanye telling him to start charging 100K for a 16. You know you're having a special year when you not only spit the last verse on the premier posse cut but Kanye is the one who throws up the alley.\n\nAlthough Rick Ross' album God Forgives, I Don't debuted at No. 1, it failed to deliver the goods. Not that it really mattered. Ross still ran the rap game with an iron fist and gave us Rich Forever, one of his best overall projects, at the top of the year. Still, for the first time since 2009, it felt like Rozay's reach wasn't continually expanding but contracting ever so slightly. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2011: Drake\n\nCREDENTIALS: Take Care, non-album cuts like \"Club Paradise\" and \"Dreams Money Can Buy,\" guest spots like \"I'm on One,\"\"Tony Montana (Remix),\" and \"Round of Applause\"\n\nBill Simmons once called LeBron James the car wash \"everything\" package, saying, \"You see an athlete get handed the 'everything' package maybe only five times in your life.\" Drake is like the LeBron of rap (albeit with more hair), and he can seemingly do anything: rap, sing, craft projects, create a soundscape, and drop meme-worthy lines.\n\nWhen Drake emerged on the scene in 2009 he was more than just a rapper with crossover potential—just like LeBron is more than a 6'8\" dude with a jump shot—he was a rapper with superstar potential. So Far Gone put Drake on the map in '09, and his 2010 debut album, Thank Me Later, was released in a stacked hip-hop year. But Drake didn't claim his championship ring until 2011 rolled around.\n\nAfter the dust of 2010 settled, Drake unceremoniously started rolling out songs on his OVO blog. Every release, from \"Dreams Money Can Buy\" to \"Club Paradise\" to \"Marvin's Room,\" instantly became an event—and some of the most discussed songs of the year. So much so that end-of-the-year Best of lists had to leave off Drake cuts, lest he overwhelm the lists by the sheer quantity of his quality output.\n\nDrake was so hot he gave away that year's summer anthem and one of his best songs ever to DJ Khaled (\"I'm on One\") and it didn't even hurt the quality of his album, Take Care. Coming late that year, his sophomore set showed that Drizzy had many skills but his greatest gift was his ability to internalize his struggles and make them universal. Call it \"emo\" if you like, but feeling regret over a lost lover, feeling proud of your accomplishments, and feeling like you're the best but still have 10 years left is what we ought to expect from brash young men. With Take Care, we finally got to witness the full breadth of his undeniable talent. Suddenly, the throne was no longer for the taking.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Rick Ross, Jay Z, Kanye West\n\nAfter ascending into the Best Rapper Alive conversation (to everyone's surprise) the year before, Rick Ross became a powerhouse in 2011. Similar to 50 Cent in 2004, Ross didn't put out a ton of solo material, but his Ashes to Ashes mixtape was released in the closing days of 2010 and carried into 2011 as he prepped Maybach Music Group's Self Made Vol. 1.\n\nAnd yes, it is still Jay before 'Ye because even as Yeezy handled much of the Watch the Throne aesthetics and delivered some great verses, Kanye stepped aside as Jay bodied tracks like \"Love You So,\" \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" and \"Who Gone Stop Me?\" on his own. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2010: Kanye West\n\nCREDENTIALS: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, G.O.O.D. Fridays series, guest spots on \"Live Fast, Die Young,\" \"Deuces Remix,\" and \"Start It Up\"\n\nCan we get much higher? In 2010, Kanye West made a triumphant return to rapping full time. Lost in the hype of his post-Swiftgate comeback was the fact that Kanye wasn't just the best rapper alive but also the best rapper he's ever been. Yeezy reached the height of his technical proficiency. Gone were the pesky lapses of supreme competency where he uttered \"Funny when you thought of them but only to you\" type lines. Instead it was all genuine wit with rhymes like \"Got caught with 30 rocks the cop looked like Alec Baldwin.\"\n\nInstead of imploding within the glass house of his fame (as many thought he would/already had) he furnished his persona with even more honesty and soul-searching to create one of the most vivid portraits of superstardom rap had ever seen. Ye's G.O.O.D. Friday releases kept him consistently anticipated week to week, and when My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy finally did arrive it was hailed as an instant classic and arguably Kanye's best album.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Eminem\n\nIronically, despite rapping at a higher level throughout the year, the two best verses on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy weren't from Kanye. Instead, he was able to coax inspired performances from Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross, the latter of whom saw his growth as a rapper reach its apex on \"Devil in a New Dress.\" Ross was never perceived as a great lyricist until Deeper Than Rap won him the award for Most Improved Rapper. But the nearly flawless Teflon Don—supercharged with the street anthem of the year \"B.M.F.\"—saw Rozay's once sluggish elocution evolve into a fluid dynamo. The guy who was once clowned for rhyming \"Atlantic\" with \"Atlantic\" was suddenly keeping multis on deck with lines like, \"Young and radical, methods are mathematical/I multiplied my money through different avenues.\"\n\nYet, the verse of the year belonged to Nicki Minaj, whose manic energy on \"Monster\" took her from buzzing to being invited on stage with Jay Z and Kanye West at Yankee Stadium. Chilling backstage while Jay, 'Ye, and Nicki performed \"Monster,\" a rejuvenated Eminem was returning to the forefront of the rap conversation after kicking his drug habit, abandoning the accents, and dropping the well received Recovery. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2009: JAY-Z\n\nCREDENTIALS: The Blueprint III, first No. 1 hit of his career, 11th No. 1 album\n\nIn the wake of Lil Wayne's utter domination of 2008, 2009 was, to say the least, a rebuilding year. Kanye had become an Auto-Tune performance artist. Lil Wayne began pushing his Young Money crew, and into the void came a rush of rookie artists from across the spectrum. Amidst all the confusion, a veteran stepped up and released the biggest single of his career.\n\nWhen you're the best rapper alive, and you release your most successful single ever, it's hard for the mantle not to fall to you. While The Blueprint III may not have been a critical smash, the record was well-received, debuting at No. 1 on Billboard—Jay Z's 11th album to do so—and eventually going platinum. Hov also proved that he'd retained his nimble technical abilities; love it or hate it, he was still the most envied rapper in hip-hop.\n\nPart of that was a result of his business moves. After appearing at the president's inauguration, Jay crossed over in a way no rapper had previously, unless you count Eazy-E's visit to the White House. He left his job as president of Def Jam and signed a $150 million deal with Live Nation to launch Roc Nation. But after all is said and done it all comes down to the music.\n\nWhile his first single, \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\" had some chart success (despite its obvious failings as prophecy), its follow-up singles were two of the biggest of Jay's career. \"Run This Town\" was a crossover smash, hitting No. 2 on the charts. Then the monster that was \"Empire State of Mind\" took over, becoming Jay's biggest-ever hit and sitting atop the Billboard charts for five consecutive weeks. There are few acts able to retain that level of success this deep into a career, but for Jay, even in the twilight era, consistency has been his trademark.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Kanye West, Drake, Gucci Mane\n\nKanye West had a relatively low-profile year, but made his impact felt in a burst of high-profile guest spots: \"Knock You Down\" with Keri Hilson, which peaked at No. 3 on Billboard, \"Walking on the Moon\" with The-Dream, \"Make Her Say\" with Kid Cudi, \"Forever\" with Drake, and a scene-stealing spot on Jay-Z's \"Run This Town.\"\n\nDrake, meanwhile, had begun to show signs that he was really about to be that successful. His So Far Gone EP was released in late 2009, and \"Best I Ever Had\" became his first legitimate smash, topping the hip-hop charts and reaching No. 2 on the Hot 100. \"Successful,\"\"Forever,\" and \"I'm Goin In,\" all of which charted well, rounded out his accomplishments for the year, the first where it became evident that a star was born.\n\nRounding out the honorable mentions is Gucci Mane, easily the most prolific artist on this list. He rose up from his rabble-rousing grassroots, flooding the market without over-saturating it, releasing a handful of mixtapes that are now considered classics, including Writings on the Wall and Burrrprint: The Movie 3D, while his singles \"Wasted\" and \"Lemonade\" had considerable chart traction. —David Drake\n\n2008: Lil Wayne\n\nCREDENTIALS:Tha Carter III, Dedication 3, four Top 20 singles off Tha Carter, \"Love in This Club Part II,\"\"My Life,\"\"Can't Believe It,\" \"Swagga Like Us,\"\"Turnin' Me On\"\n\nLil Wayne's commercial, creative and cultural ascent reached its peak in 2008, the year he became a true crossover star and, without question, the greatest rapper alive. It had been two years since his last album, but Weezy had flooded the industry, releasing a succession of hot street tapes and guest verses.\n\nFirst, his guest verses: Lil Wayne was a scene-stealing rap star, making his mark on T.I.'s \"Swagga Like Us,\" T-Pain's \"Can't Believe It\" (platinum) and Akon's \"I'm So Paid\" (platinum). He also made his mark on R&B, turning up on Keri Hilson's \"Turnin' Me On,\" Lloyd's \"Girls Around the World\" and Usher's \"Love in This Club II.\"\n\nBut it was his work as a solo artist that made the biggest mark. Wayne managed to drop one of the best 12 inches in history with \"A Milli\"/\"Lollipop.\" The street single, \"A Milli,\" was a triumph of production ingenuity and lyrical invention; it reached No. 6 on the Hot 100. His radio single, the Static Major–assisted \"Lollipop,\" topped the pop charts, went five times platinum, and helped drive Carter III to 2.88 million in sales by the end of 2008, during one of the worst climates for selling records in industry history. Two other singles were released from this record; \"Got Money\" with T-Pain hit No. 10 and sold double platinum, while the platinum-selling \"Mrs. Officer\" reached No. 16.\n\nBy this point Weezy's claim to be the greatest living rapper on Tha Carter II no longer seemed nearly so audacious. Tha Carter III was released in June 2008, three years after his last LP. Despite taking a \"break\" from official releases, his album went three times platinum, opening at No. 1 on Billboard and selling more than 1 million copies in its first week. It became the rapper's best-selling album to that point. It was the first to reach 1 million in sales since The Massacre.\n\nAs impressive as the numbers were, though, what made Lil Wayne the greatest rapper alive in 2008 transcended popularity. He had broadened what was thought possible for a rapper. The boundaries of the genre were pushed to their logical breaking point. He was still rapping, retaining his innate cleverness and style, but had such intoxicated confidence that he didn't need to live by the formal limitations adhered to by lesser MCs. And then, not content to rest on his laurels, he released Dedication 3, another mixtape with DJ Drama, before the year let out.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: T.I., Young Jeezy, Kanye West\n\nWayne's competition in 2008, while strong, wasn't coming close. Despite the relative flop of T.I. vs. T.I.P. the previous year (not to mention his legal travails), Tip picked up where he left off with King and stepped up his pop appeal. \"Whatever You Like\" became T.I.'s first No. 1 single that year, surpassing \"What You Know,\" which peaked at No. 3 in 2006. The album, Paper Trail, included two more major singles (including another No. 1 in \"Live Your Life.\")\n\nYoung Jeezy, in the meantime, released his strongest record since Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 with The Recession. It was his second No. 1 LP. He also appeared on Usher's \"Love in This Club,\" which would also find the top spot. He didn't regain the widespread commercial appeal that he had on his debut record, but the album was a creative success, particularly after the disappointment of 2006's The Inspiration.\n\nKanye West had a fairly low-key year in 2008, but in the wake of Graduation's 2007 release, he remained one of hip-hop's biggest stars. His final single from Graduation, \"Homecoming,\" was released, and he began working on his tortured melodic album 808s and Heartbreak. But as a rapper, he kept the flame alive with a series of hugely popular guest verses, appearing on Estelle's \"American Boy,\" Young Jeezy's \"Put On,\" and T.I.'s \"Swagga Like Us.\" —David Drake\n\n2007: Kanye West\n\nCREDENTIALS: Graduation, beats 50 Cent in highly publicized sales battle, drops several huge hits, \"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\"\"Stronger,\" \"Good Life,\" and \"Homecoming\"\n\nKanye West's career had been building toward this moment all along. By 2007, the stars had aligned and Yeezy became the epicenter of hip-hop, both sonically and artistically. Despite releasing two stellar albums in 2004 and 2005, he was seen as a great producer and great songmaker but never a great MC. During the years when the rap zeitgeist was playing limbo with coke rappers, mixtape runs, and ringtone rap, Yeezy raised the bar up and got his bars up.\n\nHis humor was still present as he spit the most Kanye line ever: \"I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary.\" The real change was in Yeezy's now fluent delivery. No longer did he flub verses with over exposition. Whatever his words lacked in humility they made up for in maturity. His vocal performance was now poised and patient, characteristics best seen on cuts like \"Flashing Lights,\" where he employed a delicate nuance to his rhymes where a younger Kanye might have gone for a ham-fisted approach.\n\nBeyond his flow, 'Ye dropped his best songs ever, \"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\" and finally found what he always sorely lacked: a true street anthem. With \"Stronger,\" Yeezy scored arguably his biggest hit ever, another testament to his crossover appeal (and made Yeezy an early adapter to EDM).\n\nStill, it felt like this was happening right under our noses. When Kanye got into a highly publicized sales battle with 50 Cent, many believed he stood no chance against Curtis. Little did they realize 50's antics were starting to feel like an old Biggie line: \"Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out.\" If you didn't initially feel the winds of change, then you got hit with the whirlwind of Graduation.\n\nThe album outsold 50's Curtis by a wide margin and not only proved Kanye was a cultural force but one who wasn't willing to settle. The guy that executives once told to stick to producing was now the Best Rapper Alive. Kanye must have realized it, too. As much as people think Kanye is obsessed with himself, in truth he's always been obsessed with challenging himself. That might have something to do with why, as soon as people finally accepted his rapping, he abandoned it to move on to singing.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Lil Wayne, Jay Z, André 3000\n\nThere was one incredibly frustrating thing about Graduation though: the Lil Wayne-assisted \"Barry Bonds.\" Not because it was a bad song but because Kanye outrapped the previous Best Rapper Alive so badly it felt like Wayne took a dive. We only say that because otherwise Weezy killed it in '07, releasing about 100 songs.\n\nThe easy put down would have been \"it was quantity over quality,\" but that's the thing about Wayne in his prime: Nearly everything he did was quality. There was always one random line or burst of flow that was worth hearing. The highlight was his spectacular double disc mixtape Da Drought 3, which found Wayne blacking out over one instrumental after another. The most significant cut was \"Dough Is What I Got,\" which had him rapping over Jay Z's lackluster \"Show Me What You Got.\" The song finally proved the claims Wayne had made in Complex the previous year: \"I\"m better than Jay Z.\"\n\nJay Z was having a resurgence of sorts as well. After seemingly losing a step after retiring and coming back with the disappointing Kingdom Come, Jay got inspired by the film American Gangster and dropped an album of the same name. He wasn't rapping about anything he hadn't rapped about 10 years before, but the fact that he found yet another way to say something we'd already heard and make it compelling remains one of his most under-appreciated achievements.\n\nA slightly disappointing (in hindsight) event was the return of André 3000. 3 Stacks' comeback—highlighted by a series of memorable guest verses—was ultimately a tease for a solo project that never materialized. Still, you couldn't shake the feeling that every time he dropped a verse it became the most talked about 16 of any given moment. —Insanul Ahmed\n\n2006: Lil Wayne\n\nCREDENTIALS: 2005's Tha Carter II, Like Father, Like Son, Dedication 2, barrage of guest verses including \"Gimmie That,\" \"Make It Rain,\" and \"You\"\n\nAt the tail end of 2005, Lil Wayne dropped his best solo LP, Tha Carter II. The album featured a cut called \"Best Rapper Alive,\" which seemed like another empty boast, but Wayne wasn't being cocky—he just realized his arrival before the rest of us did. After Tha Carter II, Weezy started his absolutely ridiculous run, highlighted by Dedication 2 and his joint album with Birdman, Like Father, Like Son, both of which featured some of the best rapping of his soon-to-be illustrious career.\n\nMore importantly, his mastery on the mic gave him the confidence to feel his way through any beat and interact with it a"
