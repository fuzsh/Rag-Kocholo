        "text": "SYNOPSIS This paper is based on the prologue for a new version of my Highlife Time that was originally a 51 chapter book on West African African highlife and related forms of music, published by Anansesem Press in Accra in 1994 and then 1996. [the 1996 version of Highlife Time is available on www.academia.edu]. A few years ago the publisher asked me to update and expand Highlife Time into a 65 chapter book which I completed in late 2013. Plans are now being made to publish the new edition book this year, 2017. However, already the new book is slightly out-of-date and there have been many new developments in the Ghanaian music scene. These include some developments touched on in the main text of the newest edition of Highlife Time, such as jama hiplife that, instead of using imported hiphop beats, utilises 'jama' rhythms, which is what the youth now call highlife and other local beats. Then there is the azonto club dance that is also based on jama beats, the rise of the 'Sahelian' or 'Savannah' sounds of northern Ghanaian music stars, electronic 'contemporary highlife' and R&B influenced Afropop. Even newer with the Ghanaian youth is Jamaican dancehall and its Afro-dancehall spinoff, and a Pan African club dance known as 'afrobeats' (nb. not Fela Kuti's Afrobeat) of which the Ghanaian azonto was an early example. I also talk of the way the century old 'Highlife Imagination' has crossed over to the new millennial generation and is influencing various forms of current Ghanaian music. In the text of this article I sometimes refer to chapter headings-which are the ones found in the yet unpublished 2017 version of Highlife Time. Nevertheless, readers may find this article of interest as it is based on the latest work I have done on the Ghanaian music scene. This paper is divided into three Sections SECTION ONE: Examines briefly some general recent trends in the Ghanaian musical scene and industry. SECTION TWO: Looks at 17 broad musical genres-both old and new-that I have identified as comprising the Ghanaian musical repertoire; and that I compare to 17 'musical pots' simmering on a large artistic stove. SECTION THREE: Discusses how the 'Highlife Imagination' has crossed into the new millennium, despite all the changing technologies, youth fashions and outside influences. Indeed, highlife music and its 'jama' beats now dominate most of Ghana's major popular music genres, such as hiplife, local gospel dance-music, azonto/afrobeats, Afro-dancehall and 'contemporary highlife'.\n\nThis course focuses on the rich variety of African popular culture as a way of elucidating the politics and poetics of urban social life in the modern African world. By referring to the “African world,” we recognize that the popular culture of urban Africa takes shape within a dynamic array of local, regional, and global communities, through which media, technology, capital, ideas, and people circulate with greater and greater frequency. The modernity of this world is evidenced by its extensive engagement with, contributions to, and contestations of the nation-state, the global economy, and the transnational circuits of culture from the hinterlands of the Global South. The term “popular” turns our attention to the sub-cultural, counter-public, and frequently youth-driven social and aesthetic trends cultivated in cities, within particular contexts of labor, politics, leisure, ritual, and consumer capitalism. The “culture” to which we refer encompasses a great variety of expressive forms, including music, dance, visual art, literature, theatre, and cinema. This culture is African to the extent that the post-colonial and trans- (and increasingly post-) national crises, struggles, accomplishments, and aspirations reveal common interests, concerns, and solutions emergent from the continent, its cities, and diasporas. By reading, listening, and looking deeply into the urban popular culture of the African world, this course will make a strong case for the significance of the popular performing and visual arts to the study of Africa in the social sciences and humanities, attesting to the vital place of such expression in the world today.\n\nThis Ph D thesis is a comparative social history of acculturated sub-Saharan African popular entertainment. It is divided into two sections. Part One concerns two linked syncretic or trans-cultural Ghanaian popular performing art-forms, the concert party (comic opera) and highlife music, the information primarily being obtained from the author's work in Ghana since 1969 as a practicing musician, music journalist, record engineer/producer and archivist. Focusing largely on one particular group (the Jaguar Jokers or J.J.'s concert party). Part One looks at the actual performance of the group, the band's daily life and organisation, reflections on the concert party profession by members and the changes the J.J.'s and similar ensembles have undergone over the years. Part One also includes synopses of 12 concert party plays and a full transcription of the Jaguar Jokers musical play ‘Onipa Hia Mmoa’ (Man Needs Help) Ghanaian popular entertainment stands at an intersection, nexus or `cross-roads' of multiple socio-cultural, historical and aesthetic realms and the author has grouped these into twelve themes that provide the basis for Part Two of the thesis. They are explored with the aid of documented evidence and comparative information from the popular performing arts of other areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The first theme addressed is the continuity between the traditional and modern performing arts (music and drama), both traditional retentions in contemporary genres and the way the modern ones have become retrospectively indigenised. The impact of western contact since the colonial times on local performing arts in terms of syncretic compatability/incompatability and ‘glocalisation’ is then discussed – as is the role of the intermediate African classes and urban masses in the formation of popular music. The enormous influence on Africa of black diasporic popular performance from the New World is then treated in some detail in terms of a `Black Trans-Atlantic cultural feedback' to Africa phenomenon. Next comes an examination of African popular entertainment's relevance to urbanisation and class stratification, followed by a study of its articulating/mediating role in generational and gender matters. The final chapter deals with the anti-hegemonic nature of African popular performance in terms of both its role in the anti-colonial struggle and in present day social protest.
