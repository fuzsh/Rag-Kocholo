        "text": "In a blossoming hip-hop hotbed of talent, Malcolm “Mac Miller” McCormick is next up out of Pittsburgh, PA – a multitalented musician who can play numerous instruments and a young novice of the freestyle/cipher/battle circuit of his hometown.\n\nAccording to Forbes Mac Miller is one of Hip Hop's Top 20 Earners in 2012 - read more\n\nBorn in 1992, Mac taught himself to play piano, drums, guitar, and bass by the age of 6. Then, after learning to compose songs in a variety of musical genres, he began studying the art of rhyme. Influenced by the styles of artists such as Big L, Lauryn Hill, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest, Mac soon developed a reputation for delivering jaw-dropping freestyles in Pittsburgh.\n\nRecording his first songs in the Fall of 2007, Mac went on to form a duo called The Ill Spoken. By 2009, Mac began recording solo records. During this time he released “The Jukebox” and “The High Life” and began to generate a legitimate buzz in the streets and online.\n\nIn August 2010, Mac released his Rostrum Records debut “K.I.D.S.” and teamed up with hometown filmmaker/videographer Rex Arrow Films. Mac’s videos have now surpassed 165 million hits on www.youtube.com/treejtv, including 6 with 15 million plus views a piece.\n\n2011 also showcased Mac’s selling potential as his debut Rostrum EP, “On and On and Beyond,” sold over 60,000 copies digitally alone. Mac has also sold over a million singles total with little to no radio airplay. His debut LP “Blue Slide Park” was the first Independent album to go No 1 in the USA since 1995 (selling nearly 150,000 copies in the first week). Mac’s new album ‘Watching Movies With The Sound Off’ comes out next year."
