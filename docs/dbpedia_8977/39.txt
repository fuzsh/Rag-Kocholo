Zhytomyr (Ukrainian: Жито́мир pronounced [ʒɪˈtɔmɪr], Russian: Жито́мир, Polish: Żytomierz, Yiddish: זשיטאָמיר) is a city in the North of the western half of Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Zhytomyr Oblast (province), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding Zhytomyr Raion (district).

Zhytomyr occupies an area of 65 km2 (25 sq mi).
