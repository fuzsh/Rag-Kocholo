Ukrainian nationalism defines the nation not by race and blood, but by a common will, idea and political activity.\" At the same time, he warns that in Ukrainian circles \"there should not be blind and uncritical imitation of National Socialism, so as not to fall under the spiritual and later political influence of Germany\" [148, p. 131]. Obviously, the successes of fascism and Nazism in the initial stages of their stay in power attracted the attention of political movements in other European countries. Some of them copied this experience, and these were most likely those that did not have their own authentic national movements. Still others, who already had their own organizational models, adapted this experience creatively and fragmentarily to local national conditions. Analyzing these facts, we should realize that fascism and especially Nazism committed mass crimes much later. Therefore, those who adopted their experience of political growth could not foresee the course of history and the future condemnation of these ideologies and political movements. Obviously, with this in mind, T. Snyder noted: \"The small nationalisms of interwar Europe, such as Ukrainian, must also be seen in relation to their relationship to larger nationalisms, such as Italian and German\" [280, p. 177]. However, the OUN belonged to the category of those political movements that were already based on the considerable experience of their predecessors. That is why it used the experience of the early successes of fascism and Nazism, but did not copy them blindly. This is evidenced by the statement of D. Myron-Orlyk: \"Undoubtedly, it is necessary to follow the development of nationalist movements in other countries, in particular to learn from the experience of fascism and national socialism, but everything must be adapted to Ukrainian relations and needs, organically assimilated and melted in the crucible of the Ukrainian spirit and thought\" [148, p. 132].\n\nAnnex 294\n\n239 4.4. Influence of nationalist structures on the course of the Revolution of Dignity If we analyze the state of the Ukrainian nationalist movement on the eve of each of the analyzed revolutionary disruptions, it should be noted that during the Revolution on the Brink of 1990 it was embryonic, by the Orange Revolution of 2004, although it had reached a significant level of organizational development, it was in crisis and deconsolidated, and entered the Revolution of Dignity in a much more crystallized form [241]. The parliamentary elections of 2012 clearly placed the accents of influence in the nationalist environment. On the one hand, Svoboda became its undisputed leader. In these elections, the party received 10.44% of the vote in the multi-mandate constituency and 13 of its candidates were elected in single-member districts. Thus, Svoboda managed to form a fairly large parliamentary faction consisting of 38 MPs. On the other hand, by the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity, previously well-known nationalist organizations either ceased to exist (DSU) or became uninfluential in the political process (KUN, UNA-UNSO, Tryzub). In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the KUN participated in a bloc with Nasha Ukraina, and the association received 1.11% of the vote. The partially reunited in 2005 UNA under the leadership of Yuriy Shukhevych received the penultimate result of 0.08%. The OUN-B and OUN-M do not go beyond the scope of public education; the ISC and the National Alliance are exclusively engaged in youth education. Established in 2005, the UNTP transformed within a year into the movement of the \"autonomous right,\" which in turn split into a number of competing groups by 2011. The SNA also failed to become an influential factor in the political process [4, p. 172-178]. The pre-revolutionary level of influence was also reflected in the participation of nationalist forces in the events of the Revolution of Dignity. The dominant positions in it were occupied by Svoboda and the Right Sector (RS) social movement. In particular, Svoboda, together with Batkivshchyna and V. Klitschko's UDAR party, formed the political core of the revolutionary Maidan. Accordingly, its leader O. Tiahnybok and leading members of the party were members of the governing bodies of the revolutionary […]\n\nAnnex 294\n\n241 It is worth noting that the already quite extensive literature on the Revolution of Dignity, both in journalistic and academic literature, tends to overstate the self-organizing potential and downplay the role of organized political structures, and in particular the parliamentary opposition of the time. For example, here are some of them. In particular, R. Balaban states: \"Not being organized by political parties, the Maidan as a synergistic force was forced to pass on its political mouthpiece. This \"mouthpiece\" was taken up not by political parties, but by individuals - A. Yatsenyuk, V. Klitschko, O. Tyahnybok, who, in order to increase their own rating, actualized \"Maidan parties\" - All-Ukrainian Union \"Batkivshchyna\", \"UDAR\", All-Ukrainian Union \"Svoboda\". However, the Maidan did not have a single control center and a single force or structure at its core.\" Although the author recognizes that they acted as \"stabilizers\" of the Maidan and its \"negotiators\" [9, p. 127]. The inappropriateness of the statement about the \"actualization\" of parties that won a fairly significant support of Ukrainian voters in the recent parliamentary elections is striking. Similar statements are made by Y. Potapenko: \"The next important feature of Euromaidan, repeatedly emphasized by its participants, experts and scholars, is the indication of the unconstructiveness of the idea that opposition leaders and party functionaries led it and directed the actions of the protesters. Any talk of Maidan's \"controllability\" and its absolute loyalty to Klitschko, Yatsenyuk, Turchynov and Tyahnybok is completely groundless\" [201, p. 9]. While we pay tribute to the self-organizing potential of the revolutionary Maidan, we do not agree with such an unequivocal denial of the role of organized political structures in general and parliamentary parties of the time in particular in its functioning and confrontation with the current political regime. The above facts indicate the opposite. We believe that such statements, on the one hand, are an inertial manifestation of the opposition of the apolitical Euromaidan to the organized political forces, which at the initial stage of the Revolution of Dignity, for their own purposes, technologically subtly organized and\n\nAnnex 294\n\n242 used by the current regime. In this regard, M. Kugutyak and M. Vitenko, analyzing the chronology of the Revolution of Dignity, note: \"The media spread the idea that one Maidan was good and the other was bad; one was functioning within the framework of the law, and the other was not. Later it became known that the security forces had introduced their agents into the organizing committees of both camps, who sought information, set up various provocations, and tried to quarrel opposition politicians with student activists\" [307, p. 50]. And on the other hand, we believe that such a nihilistic attitude to the role of political parties in the organization of the revolutionary Maidan generally corresponds to the inherent tendency of the postmodern denial of the role and importance of institutions in society [71, p. 211-216]. The official opposition status of Svoboda on the revolutionary Maidan also caused significant image losses. The party and its leader, along with their political partners, were politically responsible for the course of the revolutionary events and the fate of the people involved. In our opinion, the party leader's participation in negotiations with the current government and coordination of her positions with ideologically incompatible partners demonstrated her political maturity and conscious statehood. But at the same time, they sharply discorded with the already formed revolutionary image, \"contradicted their earlier rhetoric\" [126, p. 6]. In addition, the freedom of action of the party leadership was also limited by European and American diplomats, who demanded that the parliamentary opposition adhere to the exclusively peaceful nature of protest actions and warned against radical actions, threatening to deny the support that the opposition forces desperately needed in the fight against the current regime [19, p. 81-98]. The balanced nature of the actions of the head of the HE \"Svoboda did not correspond to the revolutionary mood of the protesters, and this was further exacerbated by the atmosphere of hostility towards the political leaders of Maidan, which was created by provocateurs of the regime's security forces who were massively infiltrated among the participants of the revolution. In our opinion, the violent clashes on Hrushevskoho Street on January 19-24, 2014, were a negative turning point for the party's image.\n\nAnnex 294\n\n243 None of the representatives of the parliamentary opposition could take responsibility for these events, given the established framework of communication with diplomatic circles. In particular, Svoboda could not do so either, although its members took part in those confrontations en masse. \"The first person to be arrested on Hrushevskoho Street was also a Svoboda member, by the way. We were forbidden to be there, Tyahnybok said that the party would be banned as an extremist party, but we already had two hundred arrested, then it reached three hundred. It was either us or them. I remember peasants calling: 'Kyrylo, we have folded our party flags, we are taking off our stripes, we are going to Hruscha,'\" K. Dolenko later recalled [19, p. 181]. At this stage, the leadership of Svoboda was considering in detail the same scenario of the arrest of its leading members and the very ban of the party that had befallen the nationalist organization Golden Dawn in Greece [290]. In the context of the escalation of the violent confrontation, the party was sinking deeper and deeper into a political image trap. On the one hand, the situation required increased diplomatic efforts to prevent a bloody outcome, but on the other hand, such actions were increasingly destroying its established revolutionary image. At the same time, the greater image losses on the Maidan were suffered by the \"The more dynamic nationalist leadership positions in the parliament and in society were occupied by the Right Sector movement. The date of its creation is November 28, 2013, and its name comes from its location in a revolutionary tent camp to the right of the Independence Stele near the monument to the founders of Kyiv. The movement included both well-known nationalist organizations that were in crisis on the eve of the revolution and no longer played a significant role in the political process, and those that had a local impact on socio-political processes. In particular, the revolution gave the former a chance to resuscitate their influence, and the latter the same chance to realize it fully. It is no coincidence that Tryzub is considered to be the initiator of the SAR. It included representatives of two other well-known nationalist structures - UNA-UNSO and Patriot of Ukraine, as well as organizations little known to the general public \"The White Hammer, the Black Committee, the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners, the Carpathian\n\nAnnex 294\n\n244 Sich, individual nationalists and football fans. According to the leader of the PS, D. Yarosh, each of these groups consisted of 100-200 people, and the Tryzub itself had about 500-600 members in its ranks in the pre-revolutionary period [19, p. 101-103]. However, after the arson of the Trade Union Building on February 18, the organization \"The White Molot decided to change its location and, together with the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners, Patriot of Ukraine and several hundred members of the Self-Defense, moved to the Kyiv City State Administration and created an alternative Right Sector. Later, on March 6, the Right Sector issued a statement that Bilyi Molot had been expelled from the Right Sector. As follows from an interview with the representative of the White Hammer, V. Goranin, the grounds for the split in the SAR appeared much earlier - in the process of joint activities on the Maidan [13]. At the first stage of the revolutionary processes, the SAR was generally unknown to the public. Although, according to some reports, members of organizations that later joined it participated in the protection of students from beatings on the night of November 30, in the seizure of the Kyiv City State Administration and in clashes near the Presidential Administration on December 1. After the organization of the Maidan Self-Defense, the \"PS\" joined it and was listed as one of the hundreds at number 23 (there were 39 hundreds in total) [288, pp. 127-128]. D. Yarosh even claims that \"it was the 'SAR' that organized the first hundreds of the Self-Defense, which later became what it is today\". In our opinion, this statement is an exaggeration, since the first Self-Defense units were formed on Mykhailivska Square after the dispersal of Euromaidan and the \"SAR\" did not exist at that time. After the security forces attempted to clear the Maidan on the night of December 10-11, the RS moved to the 5th floor of the Trade Union Building. All the time, it tried to maintain autonomy in its actions. As the Kapranov brothers note in their study, \"'Right Sector' at the beginning of Euromaidan was mainly an agitation and discussion platform, far from the scene both geographically and ideologically\" [19, p. 105-106]. However, starting in January 2014, the informal status of the leader of the nationalist movement on the revolutionary Maidan slowly began to be established for the PS. He was not bound by political responsibili\n\nAnnex 294\n\n245 and the diplomatic conventions that limited the actions of the rival Svoboda. The atmosphere of Maidan, by definition, required a revolutionary trend, and this was skillfully used by experienced politicians of UNA-UNSO, Tryzub, and Patriot of Ukraine, which united under the new brand of the Right Sector. The SPS's finest hour came on January 19. On that day, about 500,000 people gathered in Kyiv for a regular assembly, outraged by the adoption of the \"dictatorial laws\" of January 16. Before it ended, one of the leaders of Automaidan, S. Koba suddenly called from the stage to block the parliament. This seemed to make no sense, as the Verkhovna Rada building was empty on a Sunday afternoon. However, several hundred Automaidan participants headed to European Square. They stopped in front of the checkpoints of the Internal Troops (VTs) at the beginning of Hrushevskoho Street. Gradually, more and more protesters approached this place, and in a few hours their number reached thirty thousand. Suddenly, a group of 30-40 people broke into the space between them and the military and started a fight. According to eyewitnesses, they chanted chants typical of Russian ultras, \"Come on, let's go...\" [288, с. 172-173]. According to D. Yarosh, the conflict on Hrushevskoho Street was activated by members of the \"SPS\". \"I said to Parubiy: 'Andriy, give me an additional hundred Self-Defense men, and we will be able to make a breakthrough, we won't go far, but the situation can be changed. I am grateful that he gave not one but two hundred, they closed our flanks, and our assault units set fire to the bus and moved forward,\" he recalls [19, p. 107]. As a result, the confrontation on Hrushevskoho Street became fierce and massive. Regardless of the controversial judgments as to who initiated it and why, it took on the symbolic character of a revolutionary struggle against the current government, which was trying to establish a dictatorial regime in Ukraine with the \"laws of January 16\". Participants of the revolution, regardless of party affiliation, including members of parliamentary opposition parties, took part in it en masse. Here, O. Strazhnyi is wrong, arguing that neither the activists of\n\nAnnex 294\n\n246 \"Neither the Self-Defense nor opposition politicians supported the confrontation on Hrushevskoho Street [288, p. 178]. Even superficial estimates indicate that at that time \"The Opposition Party did not have in its ranks the number of people who participated in it. However, due to the above diplomatic conventions, none of the leaders of the opposition parliamentary parties could take responsibility for such actions. At the same time, this was effectively used by the Right Sector and its leader D. Yarosh [203]. A participant in the events recalls: \"In February, we were faced with the fact that we were all becoming the Right Sector somewhere in our hearts. Everyone began to lean toward a violent solution to this political conflict\" [288, p. 228]. After the active phase of the confrontation on Hrushevskoho Street ended, negotiations between the leaders of the parliamentary opposition and Viktor Yanukovych began. As for the participation of representatives of nationalist structures in them, they left an ambiguous and rather paradoxical imprint on their image. Thus, for the mere fact of participating in such negotiations and even for the fact that the leader of Svoboda, O. Tyahnybok, shook hands with Viktor Yanukovych, he was harshly criticized on the revolutionary Maidan. At least, it seemed that shaking hands during diplomatic talks between opponents was a common protocol. It is characteristic that this criticism was tended to be addressed only to O. Tiahnybok and did not affect other leaders of the parliamentary opposition - A. Yatsenyuk and V. Klitschko. And this, obviously, can be seen as a manifestation of the use of competitive technologies even in such critical conditions. When, after the final stage of negotiations, O. Tiahnybok, responding to the critical public outcry, did not shake hands with V. Yanukovych, the Maidan did not notice this [19, p. 228]. Against O. Tiahnybok as the leader of the VO \"Svoboda used this \"handshake\" to great effect in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary election campaigns. At the same time, his allies A. Yatsenyuk and V. Klitschko and the parties they led received high electoral support. It should also be noted that there were also secret separate negotiations with Yanukovych by his future short-term successor in the status of \"acting\" O. Turchynov. As A. Mokhnyk recalls, every\n\nAnnex 294\n\n247 negotiations between the opposition leaders and V. Yanukovych took place with the consent of the Maidan, and after they were held, they reported to it on their results. Only O. Turchynov conducted such negotiations without the knowledge of the revolutionary Maidan and its political leaders [288, p. 202; 19, p. 156]. The leader of the \"PS\" D. Yarosh also had such secret talks with Yanukovych. In our opinion, his actions at that time were generally well-calculated political technology aimed at increasing his own political rating by positioning himself as an alternative to the political leaders of Maidan, and in particular to the rival O. Tiahnybok and Svoboda. For example, on January 1, on the occasion of the birthday of OUN leader S. Bandera, the PS held a separate event from Svoboda [205]. It is noteworthy that at that time it did not resonate on Maidan as much as the mass torchlight procession of Svoboda. When the negotiated lull came after January 25, Yarosh continued to call from the Maidan stage for violent actions against the government (in particular, during the February 10 assembly). When the Maidan Council decided to launch a so-called \"peaceful offensive,\" before it began, D. Yarosh, on the contrary, appealed to the authorities and the opposition to \"resume the negotiation process.\" Instead, after the tragic confrontation on February 18, when the opposition leaders, after a series of fruitless meetings with V. Yanukovych, managed to reach a compromise with him, D. Yarosh voiced a different position on Facebook: \"Someone wants to stop the people's uprising by declaring a false truce. I officially declare: \"The Right Sector did not sign any agreements and did not negotiate with anyone, so the offensive of the rebellious people must continue.\" At the same time, he himself held secret talks with Yanukovych [288, p. 198; 205]. And after them and after the signing of the \"Agreement on the Settlement of the Crisis in Ukraine\", D. Yarosh again made an alternative statement that the \"Right Sector\" would not lay down its arms until Yanukovych resigned from the presidency and was \"ready to take responsibility for the further development of the revolution in Ukraine\" [19, p. 162]. When the information about D. Yarosh's secret negotiations with V. Yanukovych became public, it caused some suspicio\n\nAnnex 294\n\n248 among the Maidan participants, but it did not cause him personally and the Opposition Platform as much negative image as the negotiations held with the consent of its participants, but it did not cause him personally and the Opposition Platform as much image damage as the negotiations that took place with the consent of Maidan did to O. Tiahnybok and the Svoboda party. In our opinion, this is also evidence of the use of appropriate technologies in the competitive political struggle, which, surprisingly, did not stop even during the period of the most intense confrontation during the Revolution of Dignity. Once again, members of Svoboda and the Opposition Platform were equally involved in them during the most tragic phase of February 18-20, as they had the most relevant experience, including during their time in paramilitary structures. However, after the elections were over, the rules of political competition came back into play. Already on March 27, less than a month after the establishment of the post-revolutionary government, \"The PS picketed the Verkhovna Rada and, among other things, demanded that the former Defense Minister, a member of the Svoboda party, Admiral I. Tenyukh, be put on trial [204] In the end, such competition did not benefit both political forces and the nationalist movement as a whole. As is well known, they and their leaders failed in the early presidential and parliamentary elections. Instead, both political forces significantly influenced the ideological transformation of the revolutionary Maidan and Ukrainian society in general. VO \"In addition to participating in the confrontation with the power structures of the regime, Svoboda and the Right Sector were actively engaged in propaganda of their ideas - they published and distributed leaflets, newspapers, appeared on the radio, voiced their ideological principles from the Maidan stage, including on live television. They also carried out actions that had a deeply symbolic ideological significance, such as the overthrow of the Lenin monument in Kyiv and public events honoring the OUN leader S. Bandera. For example, when on December 8, activists of the Svoboda party organized the demolition of the Lenin monument in Bessarabka in Kyiv, it provoked an equally sharp reaction from both representatives of the current government and political partners. This rejection was even expressed by the Maidan's host Ruslana from the stage. The situation was resolved only after a number of European politicians voiced their approval [19, p. 171-172]. At the same time, this action caused a massive […]\n\nAnnex 294\n\n251 The first such revolutionary upheaval in modern Ukrainian society was the Revolution on the Granite in 1990, which coincided with the birth of the first nationalist organizations, such as the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Front, the Ukrainian Nationalist Party, and Varta Rukhu. There is no information about their influence on the organization and course of this action, but a number of participants in the student hunger strike were imbued with a nationalist worldview. The second revolutionary upheaval was the Orange Revolution of 2004. By this time, the Ukrainian nationalist movement had gained significant organizational development, was characterized by a developed network of nationalist, political, civic and paramilitary structures, and was in opposition to the current regime. Unlike the 1990 Revolution on the Granite, nationalist structures became a significant factor in the Orange Revolution. The most effective among them were the UNA-UNSO, KUN, Svoboda, and the Bandera Trident. Although V. Yushchenko's election headquarters, actively using the potential of nationalist structures, did not advertise its connection with them for ideological reasons, the revolutionary Maidan itself was largely filled with nationalist content and for the first time it began to raise topics that had previously been the domain of exclusively nationalist discourse. The Revolution of Dignity of 2013-2014 was the third revolutionary failure in Ukraine. Our periodization of this event is based on the criterion of radicalization of its participants' moods depending on the escalation of violence against them by the current political regime, and includes the following periods: Period I - apolitical Euromaidan (November 21-30, 2013); Period II - non-violent political protest (December 1, 2013 - January 19, 2014); Period III - escalation of the violent confrontation on Hrushevskoho Street (January 19-24, 2014); Period IV - relative lull in the political confrontation (January 25 - February 18, 2014); Period V - mass shootings of protesters and the victory of the Revolution of Dignity (February 18-21, 2014). The nationalist forces of Svoboda and the Right Sector civic movement played a significant role in the Revolution of Dignity. Having relevant experience in nationalist paramilitary structures, their members contributed to\n\nAnnex 295 A. Sych.

Since the beginning of the\n\nRussian military aggression in 2014 and in the conditions\n\nof the Ukrainian army destroyed by the political regime\n\nof V. Yanukovych, the volunteer movement has become\n\naggression. The process of their formation was\n\nlargely influenced by Ukrainian paramilitary\n\nnationalist structures, and the experience they\n\ngained during their existence was of great\n\nAnnex 295\n\n116 widespread in Ukraine.

The author of the article aims\n\nto study the process of formation of Ukrainian\n\nnationalist paramilitary structures during the period of\n\nUkraine's independence and to identify the influence\n\nof the national liberation struggle of the OUN-UPA\n\non it. Thus, the object of this study is the modern\n\nUkrainian nationalist movement, and the subject is its\n\nparamilitary component.\n\nAnalysis of recent research and publications. In\n\nmodern studies of the modern political history of\n\nUkraine, the topic of the formation of the nationalist\n\ncomponent of the party-political and public space\n\nremains insufficiently covered. Among others, we can\n\nnote the works of V. Kulyk, V. Panchenko, and E.\n\nAdriushchenko's PhD thesis, which also provides a\n\ndetailed analysis of the historiography of the problem\n\n[1]. The permanent scientific conference \"Ideology of\n\nUkrainian Nationalism at the Present Stage of\n\nDevelopment of the Ukrainian State\" has become a\n\ngood scientific platform for intensifying such\n\nresearch. Within its framework, scientific articles\n\nwere written by C. Adamovych, V. Altukhov, V.\n\nBuslenko, B. Halayko, V. Trush, V. Roh, I. Kononov,\n\nM. Molochko, B. Paska.\n\nHighlighting previously unresolved parts of the\n\noverall problem. The paramilitary component of the\n\nmodern Ukrainian nationalist movement is even less\n\nstudied. The most thorough study to date is the\n\naforementioned dissertation by E. Andriushchenko,\n\nwhich includes a review of nationalist paramilitary\n\nstructures. At the same time, it does not fully cover all\n\naspects of the formation of the paramilitary\n\ncomponent of the modern nationalist movement,\n\nincluding the influence of the armed national\n\nliberation struggle of the OUN-UPA on its formation.\n\nIt also reflects quite schematically the changes that\n\noccurred in the nationalist movement in general and\n\nin its paramilitary segment in particular after the\n\nRevolution of Dignity of 2013-2014 and in the context\n\nof the Russian-Ukrainian war. This article is dedicated\n\nto the study of these aspects.\n\nSummary of the main material. In the beginning\n\nof this study, the author hypothesizes that the armed\n\nnational liberation struggle of the OUN-UPA in the\n\n40s and 50s of the twentieth century had an indirect\n\nimpact on the formation of most structures of the\n\nmodern Ukrainian nationalist movement and will\n\nfocus on the arguments to support it.\n\nThis struggle took place in various forms, initiated\n\nby both formations of the once united OUNthe\n\nOUN was divided into the OUN-Melnyk (OUNM)\n\nand the OUN-Bandera (OUN-B). But of course,\n\nthe most significant was the more than ten-year-long\n\ntwo-front underground armed struggle of the UPA\n\nagainst the armies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet\n\nUnion. It left the most significant mark on the minds\n\nof Ukrainians and shaped the social atmosphere in\n\nwhich paramilitary nationalist structures were created\n\non the eve and after the declaration of Ukraine's\n\nindependence [2, p. 28-30].\n\nThe first such paramilitary association was the\n\nVarta Rukhu. It was created to protect the public\n\nactions of the People's Movement of Ukraine for\n\nPerestroika (Rukh) during the Soviet regime and was\n\nofficially registered in late 1990. The organization's\n\ncharter was written in accordance with the\n\nrequirements of the legislation of the time, but in fact\n\ndid not reflect its real goals and objectives. The\n\nleaders of Varta did not limit them to protecting the\n\npeaceful actions of the Rukh, but were ready to turn\n\nthe organization into the core of armed resistance to\n\nthe Soviet regime. A well-known Ukrainian dissident\n\nand political prisoner V. Moroz, who considered the\n\ncreation of his own armed forces to be the main\n\ncondition for Ukraine's independence and advocated\n\nthe transformation of Galicia into a kind of \"Ukrainian\n\nPrussia,\" praised the activities of the Rukh Varta:\n\n\"This is the first real formation of Ukrainian selfdefense...\n\nthis is the first real force.\" The Centennial\n\nFoundation, which he created in Canada, raised funds\n\nfor this Ukrainian paramilitary force. In 1991, Varta\n\nRukhu became one of the basic organizations for the\n\nnewly formed Social National Party of Ukraine\n\n(SNPU). This was the beginning of V. Moroz's\n\nrapprochement with the SNPU, and the leader of the\n\nVarta Rukhu, Y. Kryvoruchko, joined the party's\n\nhighest executive body, the Committee of\n\nCommissioners, becoming the ideology\n\ncommissioner [1, p. 42; 3, p. 188; 4, p. 58].\n\nAfter the formation of the SNPU, it took over the\n\nradical methods of the Varta Rukhu. For example, in\n\n1992, the party actively supported the creation of the\n\nUkrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate\n\n(UOC-KP), and its units took individual church\n\nbuildings under protection: The Holy Assumption\n\nCathedral in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, the Holy Trinity\n\nCathedral in Lutsk, etc. During the signing of the 1993\n\nMassandra Accords the SNPU, together with the\n\nUkrainian Conservative Republican Party (UCRP), the\n\nState Independence of Ukraine (SOU) and other public\n\nand political organizations, participated in the creation\n\nof the Extraordinary Committee for the Salvation of the\n\nNation and State (NCSNS). At the same time, the party\n\ninitiated the formation of a voluntary paramilitary\n\nassociation, the People's Detachments (PD). Two\n\nhundred volunteers were recruited, including workers\n\nand students. Their members were actively trained by\n\nthe founder of the Combat\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019 ♦ 118 V. Pilat and his students. And on September 22-24 of that year, clashes between NZ volunteers and law enforcement officers took place in Kyiv. They came to the action in black uniforms, which immediately caught the eye and clearly distinguished them from the \"UnSoviets\" dressed in camouflage uniforms [5; 4, p. 61; 1, p. 56]. In 1996, the Patriot of Ukraine Society for Assistance to the Armed Forces and the Navy was created under the NPU. Participants in those events claim that at its height, the organization consisted of about three thousand organized and trained young people of military age. At the same time, scholars put the number at a much more modest level, between 300 and 400 people. Since in 1993 Ukrainian legislation introduced criminal liability for the creation and activity of illegal paramilitary groups, the constituent documents of this public organization corresponded to the formal name. However, in reality, Patriot of Ukraine continued the traditions of using radical methods of Varta Rukhu and NZ and participated in street clashes with ideological opponents and law enforcement officials. The most significant of these was a clash on November 7, 1997, in Lviv with supporters of communist ideology who were brought by political opponents from the eastern regions of Ukraine for propaganda purposes. Criminal cases were brought against several members of the party. After the SNPU was transformed into the Svoboda party in 2004, the Patriot of Ukraine was officially disbanded [1, p. 130, 171; 4, p. 67; 3, p. 189]. Thus, analyzing the activities of the paramilitary nationalist structures that were in the sphere of influence of the SNPU, we believe that the Varta Rukhu, People's Detachments and Patriot of Ukraine belong to the same organizational and political tradition. Since the SNPU based its ideological principles on the works of one of the leading figures of the OUN-B, Y. Stetsko, it should be assumed that it was formed under the indirect ideological influence of the OUN-B and the national liberation struggle of the UPA. The Ukrainian People's Self-Defense (UNSO) was the second oldest, but the first influential and most historically rich nationalist paramilitary structure. It was created under the Ukrainian Inter-Party Assembly (UPA) in 1991 in the wake of an attempted coup d'état in the Kremlin. Subsequently, the UNSO carried out its activities without being registered by the state. Already in the same year, the organization clashed with participants of the traditional communist demonstration on November 7 in Kyiv. The following year, the UNSO took part in a \"march to Crimea\" aimed at \"demonstrating strength\" local separatists. At the same time, it established cooperation with the UOC-KP and supported it in its struggle for separation from the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate (MP). In July 1995, members of the UNSO took part in mass clashes with the police during the burial of Patriarch Volodymyr Romaniuk of the UOC-KP (the so-called \"Black Tuesday\"). The next and perhaps the last resonant surge in UNSO activity was its participation in the 2001 political campaign \"Ukraine without Kuchma\". As a rule, after each such action, UNSO members were subjected to criminal persecution. During its heyday in 1991-1995, the organization, according to researchers, numbered about 5 thousand fighters [1, p. 53, 97, 125]. However, the UNSO became most famous for its participation in foreign armed conflicts. The first of these was the war in Transnistria. About half a thousand UNSO fighters fought on the side of pro-Russian forces. However, in the Abkhazian war of 1993, about 150 of its members took the opposite position, fighting on the side of Georgia against pro-Russian separatists. A much smaller number of them took part in military operations on the territory of Georgia in 1997-2001. The third large-scale military campaign involving members of the UNSO was the First Chechen War. In 1994-1996, about a hundred UNSO members fought on the side of the Chechens. Members of the UNSO also supported Chechen fighters in the fight against Russia during the Second Chechen War, but in much smaller numbers. Small groups of UNSO fighters also took part in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (both on the side of Croatia and Republika Srpska), Nagorno-Karabakh (on the side of Azerbaijan), and Tajikistan [1, pp. 97-101, 110]. In general, for ideology and practice the UNSO was characterized by pan-Slavic motives, which was manifested both in ideological constructions and in the contradictory practice of participating in foreign armed conflicts, either on the side of pro-Russian separatist forces or against Russia itself. Despite the involvement of the son of the UPA Commander-in-Chief Yuriy Shukhevych, it is still possible to talk about the influence of the forms of the UPA national liberation struggle on the UNSO, but not its ideological foundations. The DSU also created its own paramilitary unit in 1993. It operated for several years under the name The \"DSU Guard\" was also listed in the statutory documents as its \"sports reference\". The clear ideological position of the party, in particular the interpretation of the nation as an ethnic community, was reflected in its paramilitary structure, in particular, in the meticulous attitude to the nationality of candidates. During the entire period of its existence, the \"Varta DSU\" had about 200 members, did not demonstrate\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019\n\n♦\n\n119\n\nbright pages in its political activity, also declined and\n\nceased to exist in parallel with the development of\n\ninternal conflicts and the decline of the DSU. During\n\nthese conflicts, the commander of the DSU Guard, V.\n\nStadnichenko, left the party [1, p. 50, 97; 6, p. 244].\n\nAnother paramilitary association, the S. Bandera\n\nPublic Sports and Patriotic Organization \"Tryzub\"\n\n(\"Trident\"), was created at the initiative of the OUNB.\n\nThe date of its creation is considered to be October\n\n14, 1993. The first chairman of the organization was\n\nV. Ivanyshyn, a well-known contemporary ideologist\n\nof Ukrainian nationalism at the time. The organization\n\nwas never registered at the state level, although some\n\nof its local units were legalized. \"Tryzub expanded its\n\nactivities not only in the West of Ukraine, but its\n\nbranches were also established in the Center and East.\n\nThe peak of the organization's activity is considered\n\nto be 1995, and after that a number of its members\n\nwere prosecuted. In 1996, V. Ivanyshyn handed over\n\nhis powers as head of the Central Leadership to D.\n\nYarosh, and in 1998 to Y. Fil. At the same time,\n\nrelations between Tryzub and the OUN-B\n\ndeteriorated, and in 1999 they were officially severed\n\n[1, p. 58-61; 7].\n\nFrom the very beginning, Tryzub was assigned\n\nthe role of the KUN's power structure. Although its\n\nrepresentatives themselves emphasize that they have\n\nalways been subordinated exclusively to the OUN-B\n\nleadership and rely on the \"bird theory\" propagated by\n\nV. Ivanyshyn. Ivanyshyn's \"bird theory,\" according to\n\nwhich the OUN was its body, and the KUN political\n\nparty and the Trident order organization were its\n\nwings. Researchers believe that in the best years of its\n\nactivity (1995-1996), the organization had 2-3\n\nthousand members. The main forms of its activity\n\nwere the protection of the events of the KUN, the All-\n\nUkrainian Brotherhood of the OUN-UPA, the\n\nprotection of the buildings of the Ukrainian Greek\n\nCatholic Church (UGCC) during its formation and the\n\ntransfer of parishes of the UOC-MP to it, and ensuring\n\norder during nationwide pilgrimages in the village of\n\nZarvanytsia in the Ternopil region, conducting\n\npropaganda marches and raids, educational work,\n\nphysical training, etc. A special resonance among the\n\npublic was caused by the Crimean propaganda\n\ncampaign led by the then kurinnya D. Yarosh in 1995,\n\na five-thousand march together with veterans of the\n\nOUN-UPA and the Cossacks in Kyiv on the\n\nIntercession of the Intercession holiday in 1995, and a\n\nsimilarly large march during the pilgrimage to\n\nZarvanytsia in 1996 [7].\n\nThe author was among the organizers of the All\n\nUkrainian methodological seminar-training on the\n\nproblems of organizing nationalist training for youth\n\nand youth sports and patriotic clubs for active\n\n\"Tryzub\", which took place on May 13-15, 1994, in\n\nYaremche, Prykarpattia. It was based on the\n\nexperience of organizing nationalist\n\nThe author was also involved in the organization of\n\nthe \"Idea to rank\" training for high school boys in\n\nOctober 1993, and the functioning of the youth sports\n\nand patriotic club \"Zvytyaga\" in Yaremche in 1993-\n\n1994, which was also created and operated by the\n\nauthor. At the same time, Tryzub for the first time\n\npublicly demonstrated its paramilitary character by\n\nholding a large and unusual march of its fighters in this\n\nsmall Carpathian town [8; 9].\n\nLaw enforcement officers often detained members\n\nof the\n\n\"Tryzub\" with weapons, which led to the opening of\n\ncriminal cases. The story of an attack by several\n\nmembers of the organization on a military unit in the\n\nKharkiv region to seize weapons was a resonant one\n\nat the time. Its members were detained and sentenced\n\nto various terms of imprisonment. The confrontation\n\nbetween the organization's members and\n\nrepresentatives of criminal structures in\n\nDniprodzerzhynsk ended in a shootout and a court\n\ncase for one of its members. There were also cases of\n\ninvolvement of Tryzub members in the settlement of\n\nbusiness and commercial relations (protection of the\n\nChernivtsi machine-building plant and clashes with\n\nlaw enforcement officers). The organization's\n\nparticipation in the \"Ukraine without Kuchma\"\n\ncampaign was controversial. At that time, opposition\n\nforces of different ideologies, from the right-wing to\n\nthe left, united against the current government.\n\nHowever, the leadership of Tryzub stated that\n\nblocking with the left was unacceptable and\n\nrepeatedly organized attacks on their representatives,\n\nwhich led to accusations of provocations [1, p. 97,\n\n127-129, 13; 7].\n\nUnlike UNSO, Tryzub did not participate in the\n\nin international armed conflicts. At the same time, he\n\nmade attempts to establish cooperation with\n\nBelarusian nationalists. In particular, in 1997, contacts\n\nwere established with them, and in 1998-1999, with\n\nthe assistance of Tryzub, a Belarusian paramilitary\n\nnationalist structure, the Kray Sports and Patriotic\n\nOrganization, was created. Its members were trained\n\nin Trident training camps in Ukraine [1, p. 171].\n\nGiven that the OUN-B had a substantive influence\n\non the creation of the SSU and initiated the creation\n\nof the Trident, it was quite natural that the Varta SSU\n\nand the Trident, among other analyzed paramilitary\n\nstructures, adhered to the most verified ideological\n\nline of traditional Ukrainian nationalism in its\n\ninterpretation, including inheriting the traditions of\n\nthe UPA national liberation struggle.\n\nSince 2005, the Patriot of Ukraine (PU) civic\n\norganization has been operating in a new status. It was\n\nformed in 2005 in Kharkiv, and its leaders declared\n\ncontinuity with the Patriot of Ukraine of the Lviv\n\nperiod, which existed under\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019 ♦ 120 SNPU, and continued to use the symbols of this party. The organization was officially registered, its leader was the former head of the Kharkiv regional organization of Tryzub, A. Biletskyi, and its ranks were joined by people from Kharkiv cells of the SNPU, Tryzub and UNA-UNSO. E. Andriushchenko believes that the organization's forms of activity were clearly marked by paramilitary and ideological motives, including neo-Nazi and racist ones. A. Soshnikov comes to similar conclusions, believing that the Patriot of Ukraine \"develops a racist and general East Slavic (with a strong admixture of paganism) rather than Ukrainian ethnic line\" [1, p. 171; 10]. It was on the basis of the latter that the Patriot of Ukraine finally split from the \"Svoboda, although until then a number of activists belonged to both organizations simultaneously (such as O. Odnorozhenko, who headed the Kharkiv regional organization of Svoboda and was also an ideological referent of Patriot of Ukraine). On December 15, 2007, an internal party ideological conference \"Modern Challenges and Responses: Ideological Foundation and Current Program of Svoboda\" was held in Ivano-Frankivsk. The main discussions centered on the issue of the so-called \"racial nationalism,\" from which O. Odnorozhenko based his report. However, it did not receive support from nearly three dozen conference participants representing party organizations in Volyn, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Lviv, Luhansk, Rivne, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernivtsi, Chernihiv, and several others [11]. On December 17 of the same year, Patriot of Ukraine released a statement in which it \"accused the leadership of Svoboda of crimes against the nation\" and announced the severance of relations with it. \"For a long time, the Patriot of Ukraine has been tied to Svoboda by observers. This was done completely without any reason, given that Patriot of Ukraine and Svoboda are conceptually different structures in ideological, organizational and practical terms,\" the statement said. By taking this step, its initiators were counting on the creation of their own party. The statement of December 17 read: \"By severing all relations with Svoboda, the Patriot of Ukraine Organization understands that it is taking on the entire burden of the struggle for a future social-nationalist Greater Ukraine. The organization \"Patriot of Ukraine\", which is built on the principle of \"party-army\", takes a strategic course to create a powerful All-Ukrainian Social-Nationalist Movement, in which the newly formed Social-Nationalist Party of Ukraine, together with the combat units of the \"Patriot of Ukraine\" and social-nationalist trade unions, will take a worthy place\" [12]. Indeed, in November 2008, on the basis of the \"The Social National Assembly (SNA) was created on the basis of the Patriot of Ukraine. In addition to it, the SNA included several radical civic initiatives: National Action \"RiD\", Chernihiv right-wing movement \"Ukrainian Alternative\", Odesa public association \"Glory and Honor\" (Sich). The Ukrainian National-Trade Party (UNTP), St. Andrew's Cossack Kuren, and the Civic Association \"Sober Kyiv\". Among the regional divisions of the organizations that were part of the SNA, only one was located in the west - in Ivano-Frankivsk region. However, it did not manifest itself in the local social and political life. The rest were concentrated in the Center (mainly in the Kyiv region) and in the South and East of Ukraine (Kharkiv, Donetsk, Odesa) [10]. They also tried to conduct their actions there, characterized by radical paramilitary methods typical of the Patriot of Ukraine. Ultimately, the SNA failed to become an influential factor in the political process. Analyzing the ideological foundations of the Patriot of Ukraine and the SNA, we can conclude that it was not inherent in them to follow the ideological line of traditional OUN nationalism, and the forms of their activities were not influenced by the history of the UPA's national liberation struggle. The participation of paramilitary nationalist organizations in the revolutionary events of the Independence period is a separate and extensive topic for research. It is beyond the scope of this article. Therefore, we will only note in passing that the use of their potential in the 1991 Revolution on Granite, the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2013-2014 Revolution of Dignity gradually increased as the nationalist movement itself grew and the revolutionary processes in Ukraine became more dynamic and radicalized. They peaked during the Revolution of Dignity. Its course and victorious conclusion would not have been possible without the paramilitary self-organization of Euromaidan [13]. It was during this revolution that the real, not declarative, capacity of Ukrainian nationalist structures and their participation in this self-organization became apparent. Svoboda, which dominated the nationalist movement at the time, mobilized its members on a massive scale and regularly rotated its \"hundreds\" to participate in the capital's protests and confront law enforcement agencies. Independent experts point out that among the other parties, Svoboda dominated by the number of members involved both on the central Maidan in Kyiv and on all regional Maidans from Galicia to Crimea. Its participation was also recorded in the percentage of the largest number of protest actions [13, p. 263].\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019\n\n♦\n\n121\n\nIn addition to Svoboda, another distinctly\n\nnationalist structure in this revolution was the Right\n\nSector movement. The date of its creation is\n\nconsidered to be November 28, 2013, and its name\n\ncomes from its location in a revolutionary tent camp.\n\nIt included both well-known nationalist organizations\n\nthat were in crisis on the eve of the revolution and no\n\nlonger played a significant role in the political\n\nprocess, and those that had a local impact on social\n\nand political processes. For the former, the\n\nrevolutionary events of 2013-2014 offered a chance to\n\nrevive their influence. The initiator of the Right Sector\n\nis considered to be Tryzub. It included representatives\n\nof two other well-known nationalist structures, UNAUNSO\n\nand Patriot of Ukraine, as well as\n\norganizations such as White Hammer, Black\n\nCommittee, Committee for the Liberation of Political\n\nPrisoners, Carpathian Sich, close to Svoboda,\n\nindividual nationalists and football fans. Since\n\nJanuary 2014, the Right Sector has been slowly\n\ngaining the informal status of the leader of the\n\nnationalist movement [13, p. 264].\n\nThe post-revolutionary atmosphere, and especially\n\nthe beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war, became\n\na favorable environment for the further development\n\nof the paramilitary movement and the use of military\n\nthemes in the political process. Volunteer battalions\n\nwere created, new political forces with a paramilitary\n\nbias emerged, and the military theme was actively\n\nexploited in the technologies of early presidential and\n\nparliamentary elections.\n\nThe experience of nationalist paramilitary\n\norganizations was particularly valuable in the creation\n\nof volunteer battalions. One of the first to emerge was\n\nthe Azov battalion, which included representatives of\n\nthe Patriot of Ukraine, the SNA, and\n\n\"Automaidan\". Its commander was the leader of the\n\nfirst two nationalist structures, A. Biletsky. The next\n\none to be initiated by the Right Sector was\n\n\"The Volunteer Ukrainian Corps (DUK). It was\n\nheaded by A. Stempitsky, who also remained the\n\ncommander of the Trident. The Svoboda party, using\n\nits presence in the parliament and the postrevolutionary\n\ngovernment, created the Sich Interior\n\nMinistry battalion under the command of O.\n\nPysarenko and the Carpathian Sich volunteer battalion\n\nled by O. Kutsyn. The latter was later transferred to\n\nthe 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Armed\n\nForces of Ukraine (AFU) as a consolidated assault\n\ncompany. A volunteer OUN battalion was formed in\n\nthe summer of 2014 on the basis of the territorial\n\ndefense battalion in Nizhyn without any particular\n\npolitical force. For some time, it was part of the DUK,\n\nand later it was formed as a separate volunteer\n\nbattalion led by a well-known nationalist activist M.\n\nKokhanivsky. It is worth noting,\n\nthat he had no real relation to both OUN formations,\n\nand even more so - after the 2017 shootout in Kyiv\n\nand the criminal case against M. Kokhanivsky, both\n\ntraditional OUN-M and OUN-B formations\n\ndissociated themselves from him and called on the\n\npublic not to abuse the name of the OUN. A separate\n\nunit was formed by members of D. Korchynskyi's\n\nBrotherhood organization. Initially, it was part of the\n\nAzov battalion, then moved to the Shakhtarsk\n\nbattalion, and eventually a special purpose company\n\nof the Ministry of Internal Affairs \"St. Mary\" was\n\nformed on its basis, commanded by D. Linko, who\n\nwas later replaced by O. Seredyuk. There was also\n\ninformation about the creation of a separate unit by\n\nmembers of the UNSO [1, p. 190-192; 14].\n\nThe current situation has created favorable\n\ndocuments of the UNA and by renaming it conditions\n\nfor rebranding and reformatting of those paramilitary\n\nnationalist structures that were in crisis on the eve of\n\nthe Revolution of Dignity in 2013-2014 and ceased to\n\nhave a significant impact on socio-political processes.\n\nIn March 2014, a social movement was transformed\n\ninto a political party on the basis of the constituent\n\n\"Right Sector (RS). D. Yarosh was elected its leader,\n\nand the leadership also included representatives of\n\nTryzub, UNA-UNSO, and Patriot of Ukraine-SNA.\n\nHowever, the recent revolutionary popularity of the\n\nSPS has not been converted into relevant political\n\nresults. During the early presidential elections, D.\n\nYarosh received only 0.7% of the vote, while the PS\n\nreceived 1.8% in the same parliamentary elections. At\n\nthe end of 2015, D. Yarosh left the party, announcing\n\nthe formation of a new political project on the basis of\n\nindividual battalions of the Volunteer Ukrainian\n\nCorps - the National Movement\n\n\"Yarosh's Statehood Initiative\" (Diya). However, so\n\nfar little is known about the party's actual activities:\n\nthe party's website mainly publishes statements, reports\n\non the creation of regional organizations, and reports\n\non military and sports exercises or news from the front\n\n[15].\n\nSoon after the registration of the SAR,\n\nrepresentatives of the UNA-UNSO and Patriot of\n\nUkraine-SNA left it, trying to resume their own\n\npolitical projects. In 2015, UNA-UNSO made\n\nunsuccessful attempts to do so, eventually being\n\ndenied registration by the Ministry of Justice. The\n\nPatriot of Ukraine-SNA has been much more\n\nsuccessful. Having practically ceased to exist in 2014\n\nand transformed into the Azov regiment and the Civil\n\nCorps NGO, in the spring of 2015 their\n\nrepresentatives returned to the idea of reviving the\n\nparty project and created the\n\n\"National Corps. However, the process dragged on\n\nuntil 2016, and the symbolic day of the party's\n\ncreation is considered to be a significant date for\n\nUkrainians\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019 ♦ 122 October 14 is the feast of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The party was headed by A. Biletskyi, who was elected to the parliament in the 2014 early elections in the capital's majority constituency No. 217 [15]. Svoboda partially lost its popularity after the Revolution of Dignity, as reflected in the results of the early presidential and parliamentary elections. In the first, its leader O. Tyahnybok received 1.16% of the vote, and the party in the parliamentary elections - 4.71%. At the same time, six members of the party became MPs in single-member majoritarian constituencies. Many party members and supporters perceived these results as a defeat. However, Svoboda continued to fight for its electoral and nationalist niche. Its arsenal of methods included paramilitary traditions: public marches, torchlight processions, internal training, etc. This area of activity was significantly strengthened by the Legion of Freedom, created from participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war, and the Sokol public organization, which is under the party's influence and whose many members also took part in the war. In early 2017, three most authoritative nationalist forces of the post-revolutionary period - Svoboda, the National Corps and \"Right Sector - announced that they would join forces to achieve their goals together. For this purpose, their leaders O. Tyahnybok, A. Biletskyi and A. Tarasenko signed the \"National Manifesto\" on March 16, 2017, in the Kyiv City Teacher's House, in which they outlined a further action plan in case of victory in the elections. This political document was also supported by the OUN-M, led by B. Chervak, the KUN (S. Bratsyun) and the C14 organization (S. Mazur). This association significantly increased the cumulative effect of nationalist actions, which was clearly demonstrated by the traditional The \"March of Glory of the UPA\", which was held jointly by the three political forces on October 14, 2014 in Kyiv for the first time, and according to various sources, it had from 10 to 20 thousand participants [16; 17; 18]. Analyzing the prospects of this nationalist association, a number of experts agree that it has a real chance of entering the Ukrainian parliament, as the nationalist electoral field reaches 7-10% of those citizens who can potentially participate in the next elections. At the same time, on the eve of the 2019 presidential election, the association's members failed to maintain the level of consolidation achieved. Svoboda, with the support of the OUN-M, KUN, Right Sector, and the C14 movement, nominated R. Koshulynskyi, the Deputy Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada in 2012-2014, as a candidate for the presidency. R. Koshulynskyi, who is positioned as the \"only nationalist candidate\". Instead, the National Corps party, which was whose supporters started a discussion on social media with their opponents from Svoboda about who would be a better candidate for this position - R. Koshulynskyi or their leader A. Biletskyi - ultimately abstained from participating in the election [17; 19; 20]. Since the organizational foundations of these parties, regardless of the rebranding and transformations, are rooted in their or their predecessor organizations' pre-revolutionary activities, their ideological foundations have not undergone significant changes. Obviously, with the clarification that against their will, under the influence of Russian propaganda, which presented all defenders of Ukraine from Russian military aggression as \"Banderites,\" the ideological influence of traditional Ukrainian nationalism and the national liberation struggle of the UPA began to spread to the National Corps as the organizational successor of the Patriot of Ukraine - SNA. A manifestation of this is obviously the fact that the date of the party's foundation is considered to be October 14, which is symbolic for Ukrainian nationalists and, in addition to its religious meaning, is also considered to be the date of the UPA's foundation. Thus, in the modern Ukrainian nation nalist movement since 1989 and until today, a paramilitary component has always been significantly present. The first of these organizations was Varta Rukhu, which later became one of the basic structures for the creation of the SNPU, later transformed into Svoboda. The SNPU-Svoboda took over from Varta Rukhu the tradition of using paramilitary methods of political struggle and constantly used them both independently and through the created party structures: \"Narodni Zahony\" and the Patriot of Ukraine Society for Assistance to the Armed Forces and the Navy in the 1990s and early 2000s, and the Legion of Freedom and Sokil after the Revolution of Dignity and during the Russian-Ukrainian war. Since the SNPU used the ideological heritage of the leading OUN-b figure Y. Stetsko as its ideological base, all subsequent paramilitary structures genetically related to it also followed this line, and their activities were indirectly influenced by the traditions and methods of the UPA's revolutionary liberation struggle. Direct organizational, resource and The OUN-B, which was involved in the creation of the DSU and initiated the creation of the KUN and the \"S. Bandera's Trident. Accordingly, the latter was under the ideological influence of the OUN-B and the traditions of the UPA's national liberation struggle, and this influence was also automatically transferred to the paramilitary parapartisan structure of the DSU - the DSU Guard.\n\nAnnex 295\n\nRegional Studies, 2019\n\n♦\n\n123\n\nThe most significant Ukrainian nationalist\n\nparamilitary organization during the entire period of\n\nUkraine's independence was the UNSO. Its history is\n\nfull of participation in both domestic political\n\nprocesses and international military conflicts.\n\nHowever, despite the involvement of the son of the\n\nUPA Commander-in-Chief Yuriy Shukhevych in its\n\nleadership at various times, the ideological\n\nfoundations of this organization differed from the\n\nideological foundations of traditional Ukrainian\n\nnationalism and were largely based on pan-Slavic\n\nconcepts. Accordingly, the influence of the UPA's\n\nnational liberation struggle was limited to imitation of\n\nits methods.\n\nThe traditional ideology of Ukrainian nationalism\n\nwas not inherent in them, and the traditions of the\n\nUPA's national liberation struggle did not influence\n\nthe paramilitary nationalist structures that were\n\norganizationally based in Eastern and Southern\n\nUkraine, such as the Patriot of Ukraine, which was\n\nrestored in Kharkiv after the rebranding of the SNPU\n\nand the SNA created on its basis. In addition to pan-\n\nSlavic motives, their worldview was also\n\ncharacterized by neo-Nazi and racist motives.\n\nThe Revolution of Dignity of 2013-2014 gave a\n\nchance for political resuscitation to those paramilitary\n\norganizations that had ceased to have a significant\n\nimpact on socio-political processes: UNSO, Tryzub,\n\nPatriot of Ukraine-SNA. They joined the Right Sector\n\npublic movement, which, along with the prerevolutionary\n\nleader of the nationalist movement, the\n\nSvoboda party, had the greatest influence on the\n\ncourse of the revolution among other nationalist\n\nstructures.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war,\n\nthe experience of Ukrainian nationalist paramilitaries\n\nThe development of civil society organizations had a\n\ndecisive impact on the formation of the volunteer\n\nmovement, which played a significant role in\n\ndeterring Russian military aggression. The Patriot of\n\nUkraine-SNA created the Azov battalion, the Right\n\nSector created the Volunteer Ukrainian Corps, and\n\nSvoboda formed the Sich Interior Ministry battalion\n\nand the Carpathian Sich volunteer battalion,\n\nD. Korczynski's \"Brotherhood\" formed the special\n\npurpose company of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\n\n\"St. Mary\", a volunteer battalion \"OUN\" was formed\n\nregardless of party influence, etc.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war,\n\nmilitary issues became a leading theme in political\n\nprocesses and party building. It is used by political\n\nforces of different ideological orientations. In\n\nparticular, this atmosphere also contributes to the\n\ntransformation of a number of paramilitary nationalist\n\nforces. Having practically used the constituent\n\ndocuments of the UNA, Tryzub transformed into a\n\nparty\n\n\"Right Sector, and the SNA-Patriot of Ukraine to the\n\nNational Corps party.\n\nUnder the influence of the military confrontation\n\nwith Russia, which propagandistically classified all\n\ndefenders of Ukraine as \"Banderites,\" the ideological\n\ninfluence of traditional Ukrainian nationalism and the\n\narmed national liberation struggle of the UPA on all\n\nnationalist structures analyzed, including the National\n\nCorps as the organizational successor of the Patriot of\n\nUkraine and the SNA, has increased.\n\nThe article opens up the prospect of further\n\nresearch on the modern nationalist movement, in\n\nparticular, the experience gained during the years of\n\nindependence and the prospects for consolidation\n\nprocesses in the Ukrainian nationalist movement.\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES:\n\n1.

UNN. The Zarechny District Court of Sumy granted the request of the SBU\n\ninvestigator to conduct a forensic economic examination in the criminal proceedings on the\n\nfinancing of terrorism involving the company Snack Export LLC, which, in turn, belongs to the\n\nfather of people’s deputy from the RPOL (Radical Party of Oleg Lyashko) Sergey Rybalka - Viktor\n\nRybalka. This is evidenced by the data of the Unified Register of Court Decisions, UNN reports.\n\nIn particular, this refers to criminal proceedings No. 22018200000000034 dated 20 March 2018.\n\nThus, during the pre-trial investigation in the said criminal proceedings, it was established that from\n\nJanuary 2016 to the present (a more precise date has not been established by the pre-trial\n\ninvestigation), a group of persons, which, in particular, included the deputy director of the\n\ndepartment for foreign economic activity of \"Snack Export\" LLC (name and surname are not\n\nspecified - ed.), acting intentionally and for mercenary motives, by prior conspiracy with a\n\ntemporarily unemployed citizen of Ukraine (name and surname withheld - ed.) and officials of \"Mir\n\nPiva\" LLC (Republic of Belarus), as well as other unidentified individuals and legal entities,\n\nincluding those operating in the territories controlled by the terrorist organisations \"DPR\" and\n\n\"LPR\", carried out activities aimed at financing the said terrorist organisations.\n\n\"Realising the goal of the criminal conspiracy and guided by a mercenary motive, a group of\n\npeople, which included PERSON_1 (Deputy Director of the Department for Foreign Economic\n\nActivity of \"Snack Export\" LLC - ed.), together with PERSON_2 and other persons, being aware of\n\nthe fact that the terrorist organisations \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" were operating in part of the territories of\n\nLugansk and Donetsk regions, set up illegal supplies of \"Snack Export\" products to the said\n\ntemporarily occupied territories,\" the document says.\n\nAlso, according to the register of court decisions, the criminal scheme consisted in the fact that\n\n\"Snack Export LLC\", which is part of \"SGroup\" Corporation on the basis of relevant foreign\n\neconomic agreements, \"supplies its own products (snacks, crackers, chips, etc.) to \"Mir Piva\" LLC\".\n\n\"Subsequently, \"Mir Piva\" LLC and other companies, in violation of Ukrainian and international\n\nlaw, under circumstances that are currently being established, on the basis of relevant foreign\n\neconomic agreements, supply the said products to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk and\n\nLugansk regions, in particular to legal entities operating in the territories controlled by the terrorist\n\norganisations \"DPR\" and \"LPR\", through temporarily blocked checkpoints across the state border of\n\nUkraine from the Russian Federation, while paying for the interests of the terrorist organisations.\n\nAnnex 296\n\nIt is also noted that after the actual delivery of the products to the temporarily occupied territory and payment of the so-called \"customs duties\" to the budget of the \"DPR\" and \"LPR\", they are distributed for sale in stores and retail chains that have been arbitrarily seized (\"nationalised\") by the leaders of terrorist organisations. \"Thus, the so-called \"customs duties\" and \"taxes\" paid as a result of the hidden transit of goods by \"Snack Export\" LLC are used to support the activities of these terrorist organisations and their individual leaders and members,\" the document says. On September 18, 2018, the investigator of the SBU Office in Sumy region conducted a review of the materials of criminal proceedings No. 22018200000000034 dated 20 March 2018. It is reported that during the review of the criminal proceedings, it was established that they contain information relevant to determining the amount of the so-called \"customs duties\" and \"taxes\" to be paid to the budgets of the terrorist organisations of the self-proclaimed DPR and LPR. \"In order to clarify the circumstances that are essential for the criminal proceedings, for the purpose of a full, comprehensive, impartial investigation of the said criminal proceedings, it became necessary to conduct a forensic economic examination, which requires special knowledge,\" the document says. The court granted the investigator's request, thereby instructing the experts of the Sumy Scientific Research Forensic Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine to conduct a forensic economic examination in criminal proceedings No. 22018200000000034 dated 20 March 2018. The day before, the Zarechny Court of Sumy delivered a guilty verdict against one of the managers of Rybalka's family company \"Snack Export\" LLC on the fact of assistance in financing terrorism. Earlier, the leader of the Radical Party, Oleg Lyashko, said that those who trade with some parts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions should be imprisoned. \"This issue is currently under investigation. It is being conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine. I'm not interfering yet, because I want everything to be done in accordance with the law. If the facts are confirmed, I don't care what the surname of the person who trades with the occupied territories is. This is a crime. And he must be held accountable. Rybalka himself claims that this is not the case. But I say again that I am not interfering in the situation. I demand "
