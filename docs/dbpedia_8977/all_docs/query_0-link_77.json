        "text": "24 February 2024 – 2nd anniversary of full-scale war in Ukraine – updated report\n\nThe Order of Malta Poland will react to developments in Ukraine and continue our assistance activities inplemented in 2023.\n\nAt present, our efforts are directed mainy at providing long-term assistance to refugees remaining in Poland.\n\nPlease see report Zakon Maltański Polska – Zakon Maltański Polska – aid to Ukraine from 2022 to 2024\n\nMay 15 2023 – 15 months of the war – new aid projects.\n\nWe present a new report „Aid for Ukraine” for the period of 15 months. Zakon Maltanski Polska – Aid for Ukraine 20230515 – 1 year\n\nMaltese Aid to Ukraine 2022/2023 – A 12 month report.\n\nExactly one year ago, on 24 February 2022, the Polish Order of the Knights of Malta sent a communiqué launching an aid programme for Ukraine;\n\n‘In view of Russia’s military attack on Ukraine, the ongoing hostilities, which also target the civilian population and medical facilities, the Polish Knights of Malta and the Maltese Medical Service operating within its structures are undertaking a programme to assist victims and refugees from Ukraine.\n\nThe programme will include, among other things, free medical assistance, which will be provided in Ukraine through Maltese structures present there, and in a situation where the injured and needy show up in Poland, assistance will be provided on the spot.\n\nFor refugees from Ukraine, we are organising help to find shelter in Poland, in Polish homes and parishes.’ […]\n\nLittle did we know at the time of the scenarios that were to unfold – we acted spontaneously and with total dedication.\n\nThe annual report we are publishing today is a record of our Maltese activities actions that we view as – our duty! The scale of the effort, the risks taken by those who went to Ukraine, is immense and unprecedented. The value of our aid, estimated at almost 100 million PLN, would not have been possible without the support of national Maltese organisations from abroad, and prominent individuals who pointed to the Order of Malta Poland as the right organisation to donate aid.\n\nMany thanks to all.\n\n[ Link to the report: Zakon Maltanski Polska – Aid for Ukraine 20230224 – 1 year.. ]\n\nYours sincerely and with gratitude.\n\nJacek Tarnowski\n\nPresident of the Association of the Polish Knights of Malta\n\nMaltese Aid to Ukraine 2022 – A 10 month report.\n\nThe Polish Association of the Knights of Malta (ZPKM) and the Maltese Medical Service (MSM), which operates within its structures, launched a programme of aid to Ukraine on the first day of the war, i.e. 25 February. Today, ZPKM is publishing a report on Maltese assistance for the past ten months, which amounts in value to more than 96 million PLN, which was made possible thanks to Maltese international structures.\n\nThe programme includes, among other items, socio-medical support at three points on the Polish-Ukranian border, three medical points at railway stations, the collections of donations, the organisation of humanitarian transports also into the war zone to cities: Mariupol, Dnipro, Energodar, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Drohobych, Boryslav, Obrucz, Berdycziv, Odesa, Uzhchorod, Bereżany, Horodnia, Kyiv and Lviv. Furthermore, the evacuation of the sick from Ukraine, the relocation of refugees temporarily finding themselves in Poland to the West and organising social assistance programmes in Poland such as language learning, psychological assistance or help in finding work.\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the value of the aid provided is estimated by the Polish Association of the Knights of Malta at 96,750,000 PLN. This value has been generated thanks to the enormous commitment of nearly 300 volunteers in the year’s first half and the significant material aid from Maltese organisations abroad, which began to flow in from June this year.\n\n'It was crucial to get aid structures up and running quickly, especially pre-medical aid, as refugees were reaching Poland in bad shape in the first days of the war. At the same time, we focused on distributing tasks among the rapidly increasing number of volunteers to sensibly manage the avalanche of spontaneous aid. Systemic measures were also necessary – the Maltese Medical Service set up two logistical centres – in Kombornia and a central one in Chorzów, through which, to this day, numerous humanitarian types of transport passes – 189 lorries and vans, and 109 heavy TIR-type kinds of transport. The large numbers show the scale of the Maltese operation. Still, the moving images of the evacuation of individuals remain with us, such as a teenage boy who urgently had to undergo serious heart surgery, which was only possible in Poland and remains firmly etched in memory. It was successful, and the emotions accompanying the evacuation from Kyiv stay with us forever, also with the doctors who perform such operations several times a week. On another occasion, we coordinated the transport of 9 people in 9 ambulances from a Ukrainian hospice to a hospice in Germany. Whether short or long, the fight for life is an essential matter and becomes a symbol of opposition to the barbarity of war’, said Dr Marcin Świerad Hospitaller of the Order of Malta in Poland, President of the MSM and Chief Coordinator of the Maltese Aid Programme for Ukraine.\n\nThe Maltese Medical Service has trained paramedics in Ukraine since 2014, organised and supported the transportation of the injured from the Maidan, trained civilian services during the COVID pandemic – professionally training a total of 3,000 Ukrainians – and donated aid in the form of a significant amount of hygiene and personal protection items. Thanks to these contacts, the implemented assistance in 2022 was able to accurately and efficiently reach Ukraine in the places of greatest need.\n\n’The Order of Malta runs assistance in more than 100 countries worldwide and has a great deal of experience in humanitarian action. It is this aid that we wanted to mobilise as quickly as possible. A significant proportion of the transports run in the cities of Chorzów and Kombornia are now flowing thanks to international aid. Efficient communication, but also the organisation of visits, during which representatives of associations from Germany, France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Belgium, England, Italy, Estonia, Lithuania, Austria, Ireland and the USA were able to see first-hand our activities in Poland, makes it possible to obtain material support for Ukraine. We are extremely grateful for this. I also know that the way Ukrainians have been received in our country has left a strong and positive impression.\n\nWe want to welcome the new year with the end of a cruel and unjust war, but – unfortunately – we are preparing to continue our aid activities while asking for all possible support. Members of the Order and volunteers work without any remuneration. For many of us, who are heavily involved, this is practically a second unpaid job – and for this, I would like to express my sincere thanks.\n\nThe Polish Association of the Knights of Malta, in addition to its aid programme for Ukraine, runs permanent works. I would like to assure you that these will continue. We have just completed the 21st edition of the Malta Opłatek, or Christmas Eve gathering for the lonely and needy, which nearly 3,500 guests attended.\n\nFor the coming new year, I wish the members of the Order of Malta, volunteers and our supporters continuing commitment to helping those in need as we have shown this year’.\n\nJacek Tarnowski\n\nPresident of the Polish Association of the Knights of Malta.\n\nWe present a new report „Aid for Ukraine” for the period of 10 months.

We are still looking for financing for projects.\n\nYou may find more information in the presentation Zakon Maltański Polska – Aid for Ukraine – 2 months\n\nApril 14 — 50th day — more than 4 million refugees have left Ukraine. Over 2.7 million people have entered Poland.\n\nThe Russians are preparing another attack on Donbas.\n\n1.Aid activities described in previous reports are continuing.

Aid transport convoys are leaving from the Kombornia center to: Mariupol, Dnipr, Energodar and Zhytomyr, Sumy, Drohobych, Boryslav, Obrucz, Kiev area. Convoys with aid transport are leaving from Kombornia center to: Mariupol, Dnipr, Energodar and Zhytomyr, Sumy, Drohobych, Boryslav, Obrucz, and the Kiev area.\n\nMSM Krzeszowice supplies considerable amounts of money to the center in Bóbrka (Bibrka in Ukrainian), in the Lviv Raion, which further distributes this aid.\n\n3. Thanks to the cooperation of BEforUA (Belgium for Ukraine) and the Malta Medical Service (MSM), 15 pallets of the most needed equipment and medicines, purchased thanks to the generosity of the Belgians, were delivered to Ukraine through aid hubs in Kombornia and Chorzów. Additionally, Belgian financial support has allowed for the continuous purchase of food and medicines, which are then transferred to Ukraine. The cooperation resulted in the delivery of 5 Belgian ambulances filled with medical equipment and medicines to Kiev. On 23 April, a shipment of another 6 ambulances is planned. BEforUkraine (Belgium for Ukraine) https://www.facebook.com/BEforUA is a group of assisting Belgian citizens that spontaneously formed right after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n4. A group of French and Spanish doctors and (Malta) volunteers worked with the Polish MSM units, e.g., in Cracow. Apart from providing real, tangible help to the refugees, this exchange of experience is to serve future aid projects implemented in Poland.\n\n5. A program of further activities is being developed together with Malteser International. The most urgent ones concern the purchase of equipment and providing additional facilities for MSM medical posts in the Podkarpacie voivodeship.\n\n02 April — Day 38 — 4.1 million refugees have left Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), more than 4.1 million war refugees have left Ukraine. Despite ongoing negotiations, the Russians continue to bomb and shell Ukrainian cities.\n\n1. The medical-social assistance service point on the Polish-Ukrainian border in Krościenko is temporarily closed as of 30 March — the reason is the smaller and sometimes diminishing movement of refugees across the border.\n\n2. A group of eight French doctors from the Maltese volunteers was delegated to the MSM medical assistance service point at the Main Railway Station in Cracow. For this, MSM Cracow was equipped with an additional ambulance.\n\n3. On 01 April, a group of Spanish doctors, working as the Order of Malta volunteers, arrived in Poland. They will be helping for 16 days.\n\n4. The Volunteer Service of Malta started coordinating foreign volunteers in Poland, except for medical volunteers. This coordination effort addresses people willing to come to Poland individually or in groups and help. The coordination and logistics of arrivals, accommodation, task distribution, and others require a separate organization.\n\n5. The Malta Aid Centre in Siemianowice Śląskie is developing the scope of their help — a warehouse has been opened to receive gifts, which were previously handed out on an ongoing basis or sent to Ukraine.\n\nCooperation with the Ukrainian Federation from Katowice and the „Rakieta” Oncology Foundation has been initiated.\n\n6. Earlier tasks described in previous reports continue being implemented. The intensity of which depends on the current situation.\n\n7.

They all brought gifts for the refugees, with some spending time on duty for a few days at our points on the PL-UA border in Krościenko and Hrebenny. The most common medical problems are e.g. infections and colds in children and older adults. Still, there were also cases of medical evacuation using ambulances of people with multi-organ stress conditions or oncological patients. In addition to actual, real-time assistance, volunteers from abroad must take back to their home countries true testimonies and emotions that take on an utterly different dimension after contact with the tragedy of Ukrainian refugees.\n\nIn Chorzów, we opened a warehouse with an area of 1,500 m2, where material aid flowing from Poland and abroad is received and redistributed. MSM branches in: Cracow, Krzeszowice , Andrychów, Kęty, Nysa, Krosno and Katowice are receiving donations in the form of medicines, foodstuffs, blankets, sleeping bags which are first sorted and then sent over to Ukraine (Lviv, Sambor, Narol, Drohobych, Ivano-Frankivsk, Korczowa) and to the border on the Polish side in Krościenko, Medyka and Korczowa.
