        "text": "Poland said it would demand an explanation from Moscow after a Russian missile briefly breached Polish airspace during a massive missile attack on Ukraine, prompting the Nato member to put its forces on heightened readiness.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been engaged in a series of deadly aerial attacks, with Sunday’s early morning strikes coming a day after the Russian military said it had seized the Ukrainian village of Ivanivske, west of Bakhmut.\n\nA militant attack on a Moscow concert hall on Friday that killed at least 133 people has also become a new flashpoint between the two countries, with President Vladimir Putin seeking to tie Kyiv to the attack; Ukraine has denied involvement and Islamic State has claimed responsibility.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday accused Putin of seeking to “shift the blame” on to Kyiv for the concert hall attack.\n\n“What happened yesterday in Moscow is obvious: Putin and the other thugs are just trying to blame it on someone else,” said Zelenskiy in response to Putin’s assertion that the suspects had been fleeing towards Ukraine.\n\n“They have brought hundreds of thousands of their own terrorists here, on Ukrainian land, to fight against us, and they don’t care about what is happening inside their own country,” Zelenskiy added.\n\n“That low-life Putin, instead of dealing with his Russian citizens, addressing them, was silent for a full 24 hours, thinking about how to tie this to Ukraine,” he said. “It’s all absolutely predictable.”\n\nThe Polish Armed Forces Operational Command (RSZ) said on Sunday that its forces were on a heightened state of readiness due to the “intensive long-range aviation activity of the Russian Federation tonight” and the missile attacks in Ukraine.\n\n“Polish and allied aircraft have been activated, which may result in increased noise levels, especially in the south-eastern part of the country,” it said.\n\nIt later said Russia had violated Poland’s airspace with a cruise missile which “entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow (Lublin Voivodeship) and stayed there for 39 seconds”.\n\n“During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems,” it added.\n\nPoland’s defence minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, said Poland had activated “all air defence systems, all air force systems”and that the Russian missile would have been shot down had there been any indication it was heading towards a target in Poland.\n\nHe said the missile had penetrated Polish airspace about 1,000-2,000 metres (0.6 to 1.2 miles).\n\nPolish authorities were monitoring the attack on Ukraine and were in contact with Ukrainian counterparts, he added. Polish and Nato F-16s had been activated as part of the strategic response.\n\nPoland’s foreign ministry said it would demand an explanation from Moscow over the missile. “Above all, we call on the Russian Federation to stop the terrorist air attacks on the inhabitants and territory of Ukraine, end the war, and address the country’s internal problems,” it said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking to the Polish broadcaster TVN24, Andrzej Szejna, a deputy foreign minister said the foreign ministry intended to summon the Russian ambassador to “provide information and explanations”.\n\nA similar incident occurred in December, when a Russian missile breached Polish airspace for several minutes before returning to Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2022, two people were killed when a Ukrainian air-defence missile fell in the Polish village of Przewodow, near the Ukrainian border.\n\nOfficials in Ukraine said Russia had launched its third pre-dawn attack on Ukraine in the past four days, and the second to target the capital of Kyiv.\n\n“Explosions in the capital,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, posted on Telegram on Sunday. “Air defence is working. Do not leave shelters.”\n\nThe Lviv region’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, said Stryi district, south of the city of Lviv, near the Polish border, had also been attacked.\n\nUkraine was earlier placed under a nationwide air alert that warned of cruise missiles being launched from Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers. The alert was lifted about two hours later.\n\nSerhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration, said the missiles were fired at the capital “in groups”.\n\nPreliminary reports suggested there were no casualties or damage, he said, and the city’s air defences had hit “about a dozen” missiles.\n\n“The enemy continues massive missile terror against Ukraine,” Popko said on Telegram. “It does not give up its goal of destroying Kyiv at any cost.”\n\nIn Lviv, the mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said about 20 missiles and seven Iranian-made Shahed drones were fired at the region. “They targeted critical infrastructure facilities.”\n\nThe Ukrainian energy ministry said that Russia had also attempted on Sunday to hit a critical energy infrastructure facility in the Lviv region. “Equipment caught fire and the facility was de-energised. There were no casualties. The consequences are being assessed,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe Ukrainian state-run energy firm Naftogaz said Sunday that a Russian missile strike had hit an underground gas storage site, but that it would not affect the supply of natural gas to Ukrainian consumers.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have increased their air attacks in recent weeks.\n\nThe Ukrainian military claimed on Sunday it had hit two large Russian landing ships as well as other infrastructure used by the Russian navy in the Black Sea during overnight strikes on the annexed Crimean peninsula.\n\n“The defence forces of Ukraine successfully hit the Azov and Yamal large landing ships, a communications centre and also several infrastructure facilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in temporarily occupied Crimea,” Ukraine’s military said in a statement.\n\nMoscow-installed officials on the peninsula said their forces had repelled a major Ukrainian aerial attack late on Saturday night. “It was the most massive attack in recent times,” the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said in a Telegram post.\n\nHe said a 65-year-old man was killed and four people had been injured. He did not mention any damage to Russian warships, but said transport infrastructure including passenger boats was partly damaged.\n\n“Of the six boats, five had their windows broken … During the day, the windows of the damaged boats will be replaced and as they are restored they will be brought back online,” he said.\n\nRazvozhayev also said that three passenger buses, 13 school buses and one trolley bus were among vehicles damaged during the overnight attacks.\n\nKyiv, which has struggled to find weapons and soldiers after more than two years of war, has promised to retaliate by taking the fighting to Russian soil.\n\nMultiple air attacks on Saturday on the Russian border region of Belgorod adjoining Ukraine killed two people and injured at least seven, the regional governor said.\n\nFarther east, a drone attack on the Samara region caused a fire at a major oil refinery, the latest in a series of strikes against Russia’s energy industry.\n\nBelgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote on Telegram that two districts in his region, as well as the regional capital, Belgorod city, had been hit in drone and air attacks.\n\nA man was killed when three balconies on an apartment building collapsed, Gladkov said.\n\nMoscow has escalated its own strikes, firing dozens of missiles on Friday and launching dozens of explosive drones to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian forces have also taken control of a string of frontline settlements in recent weeks.\n\nThe capture last month of Adviivka, near the Russian-held stronghold of Donetsk, was the first major territorial gain made by Russia since the devastated city of Bakhmut was seized 10 months ago.\n\nPutin hailed that success as a sign that Russian forces were back on the offensive.\n\nAgence France-Presse, Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"
