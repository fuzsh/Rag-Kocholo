        "text": "Russia has launched air strikes on Ukraine’s capital Kiev and the western region of Lviv, prompting neighboring Poland to activate its air force.\n\nThe Polish Armed Forces Operational Command (RSZ) said on Sunday morning that a Russian cruise missile had violated its airspace while targeting Ukraine.\n\n“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow (Lublin Voivodeship) and stayed there for 39 seconds,” the Operational Command said adding that it was observed by military radar systems throughout its flight.\n\nIt added that Polish and allied aircraft have been activated, which may result in increased noise levels, especially in the south-eastern part of the NATO-member country, and that the RSZ forces were on a heightened state of readiness.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched about 20 missiles and seven drone attacks directed towards critical infrastructure in the broader Lviv region, near the Polish border. Furthermore, multiple explosions in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev were reported.\n\n“Several explosions rocked Kiev early on Sunday, with Ukraine air defense forces destroying about a dozen of Russia-launched missiles over the capital and its vicinity, “Sergiy Popko, head of the Kiev’s military administration said, adding that there were no casualties or damage.\n\nThe attacks came two day after a terrorist attack on a Moscow concert hall killed at least 133 people and injured more than 150.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine for the attack as tensions escalated between the two countries.\n\n“They (terrorists) tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,” Putin said in his televised speech.\n\nOn Saturday, the Russian military said it had seized the strategic Ukrainian village of Ivanivske west of Bakhmut.\n\nKiev is contending with acute shortage of weapons and soldiers as the two-year Russia's “military operation” continues, however, it has vowed to respond by bringing the battle to the Russian territory.\n\nThe situation remains tense as both countries continue to engage in escalating conflict."
