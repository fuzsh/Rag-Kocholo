        "text": "In different historical periods the area of present-day Belarus (within the boundaries of the Republic of Belarus) formed part of different state formations:\n\nPolotsk (10th-13th cc.), Turov (late 10th – early 14th cc.), Smolensk (12th-14th cc.), and also Kiev and Chernigov (southeastern parts of Belarus) principalities, which later broke up into smaller appanages\n\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania (mid 13th – late 18th centuries; the full name from the mid-15th century was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Rus and Samogitia)\n\nPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita), 1569-1795, a federal state formed by a union of the Kingdom of Poland (“the Crown”) and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (“Duchy” or “Litva”), which had a common government and pursued a common foreign policy, but remained autonomous in matters of administration, legislation, finance and judicature, had its own separate army, etc.\n\nRussian Empire (end 18th c. – 1917)\n\nSocialist Soviet Republic of Belarus (SSRB, January – February 1919)\n\nLithuanian Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel, February – July 1919)\n\nRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR, eastern part of Belarus in 1919-1924, certain districts in 1919-1926)\n\nRepublic of Poland (western part of Belarus in the 1920s-1930s)\n\nBelarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR, 1920-1991), which was a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1922 to 1991\n\nRepublic of Belarus (since 1991)\n\nThe administrative division of these states, except for the Republic of Belarus, frequently changed. It should be noted that certain administrative entities that constituted the above state formations are today part of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine.\n\nThe information offered about the administrative-territorial division of Belarus is arranged in the chronological order of events, according to the main administrative-territorial units:\n\nvoevodstvos (voivodeships) with further division into povets (districts) in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including when it was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the early 15th to the late 18th centuries and in the Republic of Poland in the 1920s-1930s\n\ngubernias (governorates, provinces) subdivided into uezds (districts) in the Russian Empire in the late 18th – early 20th centuries\n\nokrugs (regions, areas) subdivided into raions (districts) in the BSSR in the 1920s-1930s\n\noblasts (regions) subdivided into raions (districts) in the BSSR from 1938 and in the Republic of Belarus since 1991.\n\nThere also existed other administrative units, such as volosts, principalities, lands, namestnichestvos, provinces etc., whose jurisdiction was not definitely determined by legislation nor documented or their existence was short-term.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the earlier period as regards Belarus’s statehood and political division–from the 10th to the mid-13th centuries during the period of Old Rus and appanage principalities and from the mid-13th to the early 14th centuries during the formation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania–there existed administrative units called volosts, which consisted of several village communities.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the 15th and the first half of the 16th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided into the judicial administrative districts: principalities (the remains of the former appanage estates) and namestnichestvos (founded in connection with the liquidation of appanages and governed by the Grand Prince’s deputies). The major namestnichestvos, which had elements of self-government, were named lands; their boundaries were set historically and were not determined by legislation. A smaller administrative subdivision, volost, was composed of several peasant communes.\n\n* * *\n\nA voivodeship as an administrative unit in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was introduced in the early 15th century. Later, village communities (volosts), which constituted each voivodeship, were combined into bigger administrative units called povets (districts).\n\nIn 1413, the Vilno and Troki voivodeships were established. The areas not included into these units retained the status of autonomous lands.\n\nIn 1471, the Kiev voivodeship was established, comprising, among others, the Mozyr povet and some lands in the far southeast of present-day Belarus.\n\nAfter 1511, the Vitebsk voivodeship was created out of the Vitebsk land.\n\nAbout 1504, the Polotsk voivodeship was created out of the Polotsk land.\n\nIn 1507, the Novogorodek (Novogrudok) voivodeship was split off from the Vilno voivodeship.\n\nIn 1513, several districts in the Troki voivodeship were merged into the Podlasie-Berestie voivodeship (from 1520, Podlasie voivodeship).\n\n(See map “The Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 15th and the first half of the 16th centuries” http://www.vln.by/sites/default/files/map2_0.jpg).\n\n* * *\n\nIn 1565-1566, an administrative reform was carried out in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dividing Belarusian lands into the following voivodeships and povets (districts):\n\nBerestie (Brest) voivodeship (Brest and Pinsk povets)\n\nVilno voivodeship (Braslav, Vilno, Lida and Oshmiany povets, and also the Vilkomir povet, the lands of which are now in the Republic of Lithuania)\n\nVitebsk voivodeship (Vitebsk and Oshmiany povets)\n\nMensk (Minsk) (Minsk and Rechitsa povets and from 1569, Mozyr povet)\n\nMstislavl voivodeship (no povets)\n\nNovogorodek (Novogrudok) voivodeship (Volkovysk, Novogrudok and Slonim povets)\n\nPolotsk voivodeship (no povets)\n\nTroki voivodeship (Grodno povet, and also the Kovno (Kaunas), Troki and Upity povets, the lands of which are now in the Republic of Lithuania).\n\nFrom 1569, the Kiev and Podlasie voivodeships were part of the Kingdom of Poland.\n\nThis administrative division was documented in the 1588 Statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and existed until the late 18th century.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the late 18th century, following the three partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth between Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the administrative division of Belarus underwent significant changes. In the areas incorporated into the Russian Empire a new administrative unit, gubernia (governorate, province) was introduced.\n\nAs a result of the First Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the eastern part of Belarus was annexed by the Russian Empire and was incorporated into the newly formed Mogilev, Pskov and Polotsk gubernias (see map “The administrative-territorial division of Eastern Belarus. 1772-1792” http://www.vln.by/sites/default/files/map6.jpg).\n\nIn the Belarusian lands that remained in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania new districts were created in 1791: in Brest voivodeship – Pinsk-Zarechny povet with center in the village of Plotnitsa (in 1792, renamed Zapinki povet with center in the town of Stolin) and Kobrin povet; in Vilno voivodeship – Zavileika povet (centerd in Postavy) and Eishishki povet; in Novogrudok voivodeship – Slucheretsk (Slutsk) povet.\n\nAfter the Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the central part of Belarus was incorporated into the Russian Empire, where the Minsk gubernia was established (see map “The administrative-territorial division of Belarus. 1793-1796” http://www.vln.by/sites/default/files/map3.jpg).\n\nIn 1793, the Grodno povet of Troki voivodeship, which remained in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the second partition, was reorganized as the Grodno voivodeship.\n\nAfter the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the western part of Belarus was incorporated into the Russian Empire, where the Vilno and Slonim gubernias were established.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen founded in 1772, the Mogilev gubernia consisted of the following provinces: Mogilev, Mstislavl, Orsha and Rogachev. In 1777, the gubernia was subdivided into 12 uezds (povets or districts, the term povet was officially used together with the word uezd until 1840): Babinovichi (abolished in 1840), Belitsk (renamed Gomel in 1852), Klimovichi, Kopys (abolished in 1861), Mogilev, Mstislavl, Orsha, Rogachev, Senno, Stary Bykhov (renamed Bykhov in 1852), Chausy and Cherikov.\n\nIn 1778, Mogilev gubernia was renamed a namestnichestvo (viceroyalty), which was governed along with the Polotsk namestnichestvo by Tsar’s Deputy Governor General. In 1796, the namestnichestvo was abolished and its districts were assigned to the Belarus gubernia.\n\nIn 1802, Mogilev gubernia was reconstituted to include its original 12 districts.\n\nIn September 1917, the gubernia went into Western Region; in January 1919, the SSRB; and in February 1919, the RSFSR.\n\nOn 11 July 1919, Mogilev gubernia was abolished; its nine districts were assigned to the Gomel gubernia; Mstislavl district to the Smolensk gubernia; Senno district to the Vitebsk gubernia.\n\nFounded in 1772, the Pskov gubernia originally comprised the provinces of Velikie Luki, Vitebsk, Dvinsk, Polotsk and Pskov.\n\nIn 1775, the provinces were divided into the following districts: Dvinsk Province – Dinaburg, Marienhauzen and Rezhitsk districts; Polotsk Province – Nevel, Polotsk and Sebezh districts; Vitebsk Province – Velizh, Vitebsk and Gorodok districts.\n\nThe Polotsk gubernia was formed in 1776 from the Vitebsk, Dvinsk and Polotsk provinces of the Pskov gubernia, comprising 11 districts: Velizh, Vitebsk, Gorodok, Drisa, Dinaburg, Lutsin, Nevel, Polotsk, Rezhitsk, Sebezh and Surazh.\n\nIn 1778-1796, the gubernia was renamed a namestnichestvo.\n\nA part of the former Polotsk voivodeship, which was incorporated into the Russian Empire after the second partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was reorganized in 1793 as the Lepel district of the Polotsk gubernia.\n\nFounded in 1793, the Minsk gubernia initially comprised 13 districts: Bobruisk, Borisov, Vileika, David-Gorodok, Disna, Dokshitsy, Igumen, Mozyr, Nesvizh, Postavy, Pinsk and Slutsk.\n\nIn 1795-1796, Minsk gubernia was called a namestnichestvo.\n\nIn 1796, David-Gorodok, Dokshitsy, Nesvizh and Postavy districts were abolished; in 1797, Rechitsa district was added.\n\nIn 1842, the gubernia received Novogrudok district from the Grodno gubernia, while the Vileika and Disna districts were assigned to the Vilno gubernia.\n\nFrom November 1917, Minsk gubernia was included into Western Region; from 1918, Western Commune; from January 1919, the SSRB; from February 1919, the Litbel.\n\nIn 1919, Baranovichi district was formed. The Rechitsa and Mozyr districts and certain parts of the Bobruisk, Borisov and Igumen districts were transferred to the Gomel gubernia. In 1920, Nesvizh district was formed.\n\nIn 1921, when a part of the gubernia went into the Republic of Poland, except for Bobruisk, Borisov, Igumen, Mozyr, Minsk and Slutsk districts, the Minsk gubernia ceased to exist.\n\nThe Belarus gubernia with the capital in Vitebsk was formed in 1796 from the Polotsk and Mogilev namestnichestvos, comprising 16 districts: Belitsk, Velizh, Vitebsk, Gorodok, Dinaburg, Lutsin, Mogilev, Mstislavl, Nevel, Orsha, Polotsk, Rogachev, Sebezh, Senno, Chausy and Cherikov.\n\nIn 1802, the Belarus gubernia was abolished, and its territory was divided into the Vitebsk and Mogilev gubernias.\n\nFounded in 1796, the Slonim gubernia comprised 8 districts: Brest, Volkovysk, Grodno, Kobrin, Lida, Novogrudok, Pruzhany and Slonim.\n\nFounded in 1795, the Vilno gubernia comprised 11 districts: Braslav (from 1836, Novo-Aleksandrov), Vilno, Vilkomir, Zavileisk, Kovno, Oshmiany, Rossieny, Troki, Upity (Ponevezhis), Teleshevo and Shavel.\n\nIn 1801-1840, the Vilno gubernia was named Lithuania-Vilno gubernia.\n\nIn 1843, some of its districts were assigned to the newly formed Kovno gubernia, including Novo-Aleksandrov district.\n\nIn the Vilno gubernia remained Vilno, Oshmiany, Sventsiany (Zavileisk) and Troki districts, and the gubernia received additional districts: Lida district from the Grodno gubernia, and the Disna and Vileika districts from the Minsk gubernia.\n\nIn 1920, most part of the Vilno gubernia was occupied by the Polish troops; in 1922-1925, it constituted the Vilno Land; in 1925-1939, was included into the Vilno voivodeship of the Polish Republic; the remaining parts went into the Lithuanian Republic; a small part of the Vileika district was given to the Belarusian SSR.\n\nIn 1797, the Slonim and Vilno gubernias were united into the Lithuania gubernia with center in Vilno, comprising 19 districts: Braslav, Brest, Volkovysk, Vilno, Vilkomir, Grodno, Zavileisk, Kobrin, Kovno, Lida, Novogrudok, Oshmiany, Pruzhany, Rossiena, Slonim, Teleshevo, Troki, Upity and Shavel.\n\nIn 1801, the Lithuania gubernia was again divided into the Vilno and Slonim (from 1802, Grodno) gubernias.\n\nFrom 1802, the Grodno gubernia comprised 8 districts: Brest, Volkovysk, Grodno, Kobrin, Lida, Novogrudok, Pruzhany and Slonim.\n\nIn 1843, the gubernia received Bialystok, Belsk and Sokolka districts from the abolished Bialystok Region, while the Novogrudok district was assigned to the Minsk gubernia and the Lida district to the Vilno gubernia.\n\nAccording to the Peace Treaty of Riga of 1921, the Grodno gubernia was assigned to Poland; its districts went into Bialystok (Bialystok, Belsk, Volkovysk, Grodno and Sokolka districts), Polesie (Brest, Kobrin and Pruzhany districts) and Novogrudok (Slonim district) voivodeships.\n\nFounded in 1802, the Vitebsk gubernia comprised 12 districts: Velizh, Vitebsk, Gorodok, Dvinsk, Drisa, Lepel, Lutsin, Nevel, Polotsk, Rezhitsa, Sebezh and Surazh (abolished in 1866).\n\nIn November 1917, the Vitebsk gubernia was included into Western Region; in September 1918, Western Commune; in January 1919, the SSRB; in January 1919, the RSFSR.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Gomel gubernia in April 1919, the Vitebsk gubernia received Senno district from the Mogilev gubernia (July 1919) and later Orsha district from the Gomel gubernia (November 1920).\n\nAccording to the Peace Treaty of 11 August 1920 between the Russian SFSR and Latvia, the Dvinsk, Lutsin and Rezhitsk districts went into Latvia.\n\nIn February 1923, the Gorodok, Senno and Drisa districts were abolished; the Lepel district was renamed Bocheikovo.
