        "text": "The article analyzes the state of cross-border cooperation between Ukraine and EU Mem- ber States. The authors of the article deeply analyze the literature on cross-border cooperation as well as the typology of border regions in Europe. The article analyzes in depth the cross-border cooperation between Ukraine and the EU within the framework of the European Neighbor- hood Policy. The authors make a comparative analysis of two CBC programs for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020. They conclude that, unlike the program for 2007-2013, where the focus was on the economic development, in 2014-2020, the focus was on development of health care, cultural heritage, infrastructure projects and security.\n\nInterregional, and most of all, cross-border cooperation is a significant element of the relations between Ukraine, Romania and Republic of Moldova. Since 2006 we can note the increasing pace of crossborder cooperation at the level of project activity. Projects with cross-border effects in the three countries were carried out with the financial support of many programmes and funds. An extremely important role in this process was played by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, primarily the EU neighbourhood programme “PHARE CBC Romania Ukraine 2004-2006.” Its implementation started only in 2007 and lasted until early 2010. The programme was aimed at stimulating economic and social development in the border regions to address common problems that exist in the field of environmental protection, health care, to ensure efficient and secure borders, to support the democratization of local communities, and preserving the common cultural heritage. In parallel with this programme, where applicants could be only from Romania, (funding was also distributed solely on the Romanian side), TACIS CBC programme was being implemented. It was shorter in time, less flexible in terms of funding and had fewer applicants. European strategic document Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument for 2007-2013 has offered for Ukraine and Romania three programmes of cross-border cooperation in the frameworks of ENPI: “Ukraine – Hungary – Slovakia – Romania”; “Black sea”; “Romania – Ukraine – Republic of Moldova”. The Joint Operational Programme “Ukraine-Romania-Moldova 2007-2013” was recently launched. Funding of the programme financed not only from the ENPI programme, but also from national funds. Its peculiarity is that the same procedures are established for all participating countries. The implementation phase has already begun for the projects that received funding under the first tranche; the estimation of the projects for the second tranche continues. Cross-border cooperation contributes to strengthening the principles of good and effective regional cooperation in all forms of its manifestation, creating real possibilities of practical realization of Ukraine's European aspirations. Keywords: cross-border cooperation, projects, Neighbourhood Programme PHARE CBC, Joint Operational Programme.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to analyze the dynamics of cooperation of Ukraine with the Visegrad countries with the aim to integrate into the political, economic, legal and humanitarian space in Europe and build the benchmark for system reforms to modernize Ukraine. Therefore, the study of problems of Euroregional cooperation is essential, given the complex circumstances surrounding the modern integration processes. The need to take into account the experience of regional policy of the Visegrad countries in the context of globalization and expansion of the EU influence is undeniable. Multilateral cooperation of Ukraine with the countries of Visegrad during the last decade is characterized by significant achievements. The close historical ties and common foreign policy goals of modern Ukraine and Visegrad laid the foundation for effective development of good neighbourly relations at the present stage and created opportunities for further large-scale cooperation in the future. It is safe...\n\nThis publication is the first in a series of four publications that present the findings of the research project “Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine and Cross-border Cooperation between Slovakia and Ukraine: Implications and Opportunities”. The research project was implemented by the Institute of Political Science at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Prešov with the support of the Slovak Research and Development Agency over the period of 2016 ‒ 2019 (project no. APVV-15-0369). The series of four publications is the result of the methodology applied as well as organization of the research, which was focused on examining the factors influencing cross-border cooperation between Slovakia and Ukraine at three levels: 1) the supranational level – relations between the EU and Ukraine (the first research package); 2) the national level – intergovernmental relations between Slovakia and Ukraine (the second package); and 3) the regional and local level – interactions of actors at the regional and local levels who are involved in cross-border cooperation at the common border (the third package). In addition to processing the primary and secondary sources of information required for the research, we carried out empirical data collection at the aforementioned three levels through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the EU institutions, the governments of Ukraine and Slovakia, regional state administration in the Transcarpathian Region of Ukraine (Zakarpattia Oblast), regional governments in the Prešov and Košice Self-Governing Regions and representatives of local governments on both sides of the border. Moreover, empirical data collection was also carried out through a questionnaire for the participants in cross-border cooperation from Ukraine and Slovakia (the fourth package). The first two publications present research findings on factors influencing Slovakia-Ukraine crossborder cooperation at the supranational and national levels while the third and fourth publications include research findings on the regional and local levels. The project goals as well as applied research methodology are presented in detail in the first chapter of this publication.\n\nThe article deals with the areas of Ukrainian-Slovak relations, in which changes took place under the influence of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement provisions and the tendencies in the development of the bilateral relations in new institutional and geopolitical conditions. The conclusion is made that institutional environment between Kyiv and Brussels, which began to form in 2014 with the beginning of the signing of the Аssocaition Agreeement has the significant inuence on the development of bilateral diplomatic, economic, trade relations, migration trends of Ukrainian citizens to Slovakia. More attention has to be paid to the practical convergence of socioeconomic development of border territories and the stimulation of the cross-border practices of local communities, the support of business and public bilateral initiatives and projects."
