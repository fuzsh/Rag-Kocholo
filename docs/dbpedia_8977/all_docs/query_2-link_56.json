        "text": "Two days in a row the Head of the EUACI met online with first the Mayor of Chernivtsi, Roman Klichuk, and then the Mayor of Zhytomyr, Serhiy Sukhomlyn, to discuss future cooperation and be briefed on the challenges facing both cities as a result of Russia’s invasion. Chernivtsi and Zhytomyr are two out of EUACI’s five Integrity Cities.\n\nDuring the coming months, the EUACI will provide Chernivtsi and Zhytomyr with IT tools to enhance transparency and develop communication between the municipality and its citizens. An e-reception hall will be launched and the Geoportal in Chernivtsi will be upgraded. The EUACI will also complete the integrity assessment of the water supply enterprise in Chernivtsi that was launched before the invasion.\n\nThe Head of the EUACI, Allan Pagh Kristensen, commented on the meetings:\n\n“It was great to meet with the mayors of Chernivtsi and Zhytomyr. Zhytomyr was badly damaged by missile attacks in the beginning of the war and Chernivtsi is struggling with many internally displaced people. Despite these challenges, I am pleased that the issues of integrity, transparency, and accountability are still high on the mayors' agendas. The mayor of Zhytomyr made the important point that the more integrity and transparency the city can provide, the more international reconstruction aid they can expect to receive. We are looking forward to continuing our strong cooperation with Chernivtsi and Zhytomyr as Integrity Cities.\""
