        "text": "Moscow launched a huge attack with missiles and drones on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv and the western region of Lviv on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine said it hit two Russian landing ships, a communications center and other infrastructure used by Russia's Black Sea fleet in Crimea. The Yamal and Azov ships were damaged, Ukrainian officials said, according to media reports.\n\nRussia unleashed 57 Russian missiles and drones on Ukraine early Sunday in the Kremlin's third large missile attack in the past four days, and the second to target the capital. Ukraine's air force destroyed 18 out of 29 missiles and 25 out of 28 attack drones, it said on Telegram.\n\n“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink wrote on X early Sunday. “Russia continues to indiscriminately launch drones and missiles with no regard for millions of civilians, violating international law.”\n\nThe head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, said Russia used cruise missiles launched from Tu-95MS strategic bombers, the Associated Press reported. He said the attacks were launched from the Engels district in the Saratov region of Russia.\n\nAn air alert in the Ukrainian capital lasted for more than two hours as rockets entered Kyiv.\n\nIn Lviv, Mayor Andriy Sadovy said about 20 missiles and seven Iranian-made Shahed drones were fired at the region, France 24 reported. \"They targeted critical infrastructure,\" Sadovy said.\n\nOne of the missiles launched at western Ukraine briefly entered Polish airspace, Poland said, prompting the NATO member to activate F-16 fighter jets.\n\n“There was a violation of Polish airspace by one of the cruise missiles launched this night by long-range aviation of the Russian Federation,” the Polish armed forces wrote on X. “The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdów (Lublin Voivodeship) and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it added.\n\nThe Polish Armed Forces Operational Command said its forces were on a heightened state of readiness because of the “intensive long-range aviation activity of the Russian Federation tonight” and the missile attacks in Ukraine. “Polish and allied aircraft have been activated,” it said."
