        "text": "Russia’s Defence Ministry has announced that it launched “a massive attack using high-precision long-range air- and sea-based weaponry at the military control system of Ukraine and energy facilities related to it” yesterday. No missile strikes were executed upon Kyiv, the ministry claims.\n\n“We want to emphasise that the high-precision attacks were launched only at the targets located in Ukraine and no closer than 35 kilometres from the Ukrainian–Polish border,” reads the ministry’s statement. “All the launched missiles have accurately stricken the assigned targets. All the facilities have been neutralised. All the destruction in the residential quarters of the Ukrainian capital, demonstrated by the Kiev regime, are the direct consequence of the fall and self-destruction of the air defence missiles launched by Ukrainian forces from the foreign-manufactured air defence systems deployed within the city limits.”\n\nThe ministry also claims that its “professionals” have identified the wreckage seen on the footage from Poland’s Przewodów as “elements of S-300 air defence guided missile of Ukrainian Air Force.” Ukraine’s officials blame Russia for the incident."
