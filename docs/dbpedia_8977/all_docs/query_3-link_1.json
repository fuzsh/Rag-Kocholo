        "text": "Oblast (region) of Ukraine\n\nOblast in Ukraine\n\nKyiv Oblast (Ukrainian: Київська область, romanized: Kyivska oblast, IPA: [ˈkɪjiu̯sʲkɐ ˈɔblɐsʲtʲ]), also called Kyivshchyna (Київщинa, IPA: [ˈkɪjiu̯ʃtʃɪnɐ]), is an oblast (province) in central and northern Ukraine. It surrounds, but does not include, the city of Kyiv, which is administered as a city with special status. However, Kyiv also serves as the administrative center of the oblast. The Kyiv metropolitan area extends out from Kyiv city into parts of the oblast, which is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of Kyiv.\n\nThe population of Kyiv Oblast is 1,795,079 (2022 estimate).[2] Its largest city is Bila Tserkva, with a population over 200,000.\n\nThe Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is in the northern part of Kyiv Oblast. It is administered separately from the oblast and public access is prohibited.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on February 27, 1932 among the first five original oblasts in Ukraine. It was established on territory that had been known as Ruthenian land.[6]\n\nEarlier historical administrative units that became the territory of the oblast include the Kiev Voivodeship under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Kiev Viceroyalty and Kiev Governorate under the Russian Empire. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of Polesia (Polissia).\n\nIn Kyiv region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kyiv region's icons collection is the part of the exhibition of the Museum of Ukrainian home icons in the Historical and cultural complex \"The Radomysl Castle\".[7]\n\nThe current borders of the oblast were set following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of Slavutych, which was constructed as part of the Chernihiv Oblast, was then transferred to the Kyiv Oblast (see Chernobyl zone below).\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian Armed Forces invaded Kyiv Oblast as part of its 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[8] Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to retake the region in March 2022. The oblast was declared free of invaders on 2 April 2022 by the Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar.[8][9] According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense its troops had retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv.[8] However, on April 9, 2022 the Russians attacked the Oblast again, even destroying a railway station in Bucha.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv Oblast has a total area of 28,100 km2 (10,849 sq mi) (approximately 35 times the area of Kyiv city) and is located in north-central Ukraine. On the west it borders the Zhytomyr Oblast, on the southwest – Vinnytsia Oblast, on the south – Cherkasy Oblast, on the southeast – Poltava Oblast, on the east and northeast – Chernihiv Oblast, and on the north – Homyel Voblasts of Belarus.\n\nThe oblast is equally split between both banks of the Dnieper River (Dnipro) north and south of Kyiv. Other significant rivers in the oblast are the Dnieper's tributaries: Pripyat (Prypiat) (R), Desna (L), Teteriv (R), Irpin' (R), Ros' (R) and Trubizh (L).\n\nThe length of the Dnipro River within the boundaries of the oblast totals 246 km (153 mi). The oblast has a total number of 177 rivers intersecting the region; 13 reservoirs (the most notable ones being Kyiv Reservoir and the Kaniv Reservoir), over 2000 ponds, and approximately 750 small lakes.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate of Kyiv Oblast is characteristic of the Polesia area and other neighboring forested areas. The oblast has a moderately continental climate with relatively mild winters and warm summers. The temperatures range from −6.1 °C (21.0 °F) in January to 19.2 °C (66.6 °F) degrees in July[dubious – discuss].\n\nVegetation\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv Oblast has small mountains and slopes on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This entire area is surrounded by a continuous belt by greenery and forests. The oblast's \"green area\" covers 436 km2 (168 sq mi), characterized by 250 different sorts of trees and bushes.\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following historic-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.\n\nPereiaslav museum of folk architecture\n\nLiutych platzdarm\n\nIvan Kozlovsky villa\n\nDobranychivka settlement\n\nSaint Pokrov Church (Parkhomivka)\n\nMuseum-villa of Kateryna Bilokur\n\nLandscape garden Oleksandria\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe oblast is divided into 7 raions, which are further divided into 69 hromadas.\n\nFlag Coat\n\nof\n\narms\n\nName Ukrainian Name Administrative center Area\n\n(km2) Population\n\nestimate 2021[11] Bila Tserkva Raion Білоцерківський район Bila Tserkva 6,514.8 436,115 Boryspil Raion Бориспільський район Boryspil 3,873.2 203,273 Brovary Raion Броварський район Brovary 2,881.9 242,180 – – Bucha Raion Бучанський район Bucha 2,558.3 362,382 Fastiv Raion Фастівський район Fastiv 1,761.2 183,794 Obukhiv Raion Обухівський район Obukhiv 3,639.1 228,829 Vyshhorod Raion Вишгородський район Vyshhorod 4,333.0[12] 131,957 Total Oblast Київська область Kyiv 28,131 1,788,530\n\nThe area of Vyshhorod Raion does not account for the Chernobyl exclusion zone (2,600 km2).\n\nBefore the July 2020 reform, the oblast was subdivided into 25 raions (administrative districts). It consisted of 26 cities, 30 towns, and more than 1,000 villages.\n\nThe following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Kyiv Oblast:[5]\n\nAdministrative Center – 1 (Kyiv);\n\nRaions – 25;\n\nSettlements – 1183, including:\n\nVillages – 1127;\n\nCities/Towns – 56, including:\n\nUrban-type settlements – 30;\n\nCities – 25, including:\n\nCities of oblast subordinance – 13;\n\nCities of raion subordinance – 14;\n\nRural councils – 605.\n\nAs with other oblasts of Ukraine, the head of the Kyiv Oblast State Administration (governor) is appointed by the President of Ukraine and subordinated to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Local self-government body is the popularly elected Kyiv Oblast Rada, chaired by a Speaker (elected from among the councilors).\n\nThe \"exclaves\"\n\n[edit]\n\nThe municipality of Slavutych is within the borders of the neighboring Chernihiv Oblast on the eastern bank of the Dnieper river and the municipality has no common border with the Kyiv Oblast. Still, Slavutych is administered by the Kyiv Oblast authorities (being a kind of administrative exclave).\n\nSimilarly, the town of Kotsiubynske, which is within the borders of Kyiv city (which is surrounded by the Kyiv Oblast), is administered by the Kotsiubynske Settlement Council.\n\nChernobyl zone\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chernobyl Exclusion Zone\n\nThe north-western end of the oblast is a part of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone due to the radioactive contamination caused by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. The largest cities within zone are Chernobyl and Prypiat, which are now abandoned.
