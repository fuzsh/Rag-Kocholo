        "text": "Volhynia Gubernia\n\nVolhynia Gubernia - Other Names: Volinskaya, Wolin, Wolyn, Wolina, Wolinsk, Volinski, Wolinski, Volenskii, Wolenskj, Wolenskja, Volin, Volyn.\n\nVolhynia was located in what is now northwest Ukraine, on the border with Poland and Belarus. The shaded area of this map shows the approximate borders of Volhynia compared to today's international borders.\n\nA Brief History of Volhynia Gubernia\n\nVolhynia was ruled by Poland until the late 18th century, when Poland was partitioned by the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian empires. After the partition of Poland, Volhynia was a gubernia, or province, of the Russian Empire until 1919, when the western part of Volhynia once again became part of Poland. In 1945 the entire area of the Volhynia Gubernia was absorbed into the Soviet Union, but the gubernia system was no longer used and the Volhynia name was used to identify a smaller region, called an oblast, in the western part of the old gubernia. Most of what was the Volhynia Gubernia is now in Ukraine, with a small part of northern Volhynia in Belarus. Major cities and towns in and around Volhynia include Zhitomir (the former capital), Rovno, Lutsk, Kovel, Berdichev, and Novograd-Volinsk.\n\nAlso see these excerpts from The Columbia Encyclopedia.\n\nMaps\n\nThe Volhynia researchers have found some wonderful and useful maps. Many are relevant to the entire Ukraine, not just to this gubernia.\n\nFamous Jewish Volhynians\n\nRevered and famous people have come from the Volhynia area. Read about them here.\n\nLittle Known Facts about towns in Volhynia Gubernia\n\nIn 1900, two large printing offices in Zhitomir issued nearly one-half of all the Hebrew books printed in Russia. (Source: 1900 Encyclopedia Brittanica, thanks to Al Rosenfield.)\n\nThe famous composer Stravinsky and his family, who normally lived in St. Petersburg, spent their summers in the country at Ustilug. (Source)\n\nBooks about life or towns in Volhynia Gubernia\n\nReviews of books about Volhynia\n\nAdditional Readings about Volhynia\n\n\"Tales of a Vanished Land\" is about someone who was born in Kashoffka (now Kashivka, Ukraine), in Volhynia gubernia.

Vsia Rossia (\"All of Russia\") is a business directory covering all of Russia.\n\nTowns in Volynia gubernia\n\nJewish population of Volhynian towns from \"Yevreyskaya (Jewish) Enciklopaedia\" published in St. Petersburg in 1907-1913.\n\nUse this handy, 10,000-name database of Volhynian towns to automatically generate a map of the vicinity of a town and to find the distances between towns.\n\nIf you can't find a Volhynian town in our database, perhaps it is one of the \"Lost Towns,\" small settlements that disappeared and were forgotten.\n\nHere is a page from a Russian book, with a list of towns in Volhynia.\n\nHere are some of the Jewish towns in Volhynia:\n\nBerdichev Shumsk Kolki Staraya-Rafalovka Kovel Sudilkov Emilchino Tuchin Kremenets Trochenbrod Kipil Volochisk Polonnoye Vishnevets Lutsk Zhitomir(the former capitol) Novograd-Volinsk Zhvil Rovno Ostrog\n\nShtetLinks in Volhynia gubernia\n\nKolki\n\nKovel\n\nKremenets\n\nLyubar\n\nPolonnoye\n\nPoninka\n\nRovno\n\nShumsk\n\nTuchin\n\nVishnevets\n\nVolochisk\n\nOther TownLinks (not ShtetLinks)\n\nKamen Kashirsky\n\nKolki - Join the Kolki discussion group\n\nSudilkov, site 1\n\nSudilkov, site 2\n\nRafalovka\n\nProfessional Researchers In the Volhynia Area\n\nFor the convenience of our SIG members, we are providing a list of researchers who may be able to assist you in your research efforts.\n\nOther Research Resources\n\nHere are a few other resources to look into.\n\nStories from Volhynia Gubernia\n\nThe history of Jews in Volhynia is more than just places and dates, of course; it's about people. We've collected some personal stories (OK, so maybe second or third hand) that add a human dimension to the maps and tables.\n\nMitchell Nitikman wrote a number of wonderful stories about the town of Tshon that Arthur Nitikman has had translated from Yiddish to English. Growing up in Shumsk A Journey to the Past â€“ June 2002 - Gilda and Bob Kurtzman\n\nBefore being integrated into the Ukraine SIG website, the Volhynia web site was originally created and donated by Mark Heckman with Webmaster Andrew Blumberg. Special thanks to Mark and Andrew for their enormous contributions to this effort."
