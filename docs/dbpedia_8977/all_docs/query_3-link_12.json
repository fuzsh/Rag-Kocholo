        "text": "The Polish Border Service informed ukrayina.pl that from February 24 to November 26, 2022, more than 8 million people entered the country's territory. During this same period, 6,196,000 people crossed the border in the direction of Ukraine.\n\nThe statistical department of the Polish National Bank conducted a survey among Ukrainians who found refuge in Poland about their plans for the future. The refugees were asked whether they wanted to return home and, if not, which city in the new country they would choose to live permanently.\n\nIn which cities of Poland would Ukrainians like to settle?\n\nThe most popular cities were Katowice, Bydgoszcz and Białystok. The study showed that Ukrainians prefer places with low unemployment, developed industry and the service sector.\n\nAccording to the data published in the report, 26% of refugees who would like to stay in Poland plan to continue living in Katowice. In particular, one in four intends to stay in Bydgoszcz. Every fifth person chooses Białystok for permanent residence. We will talk about what exactly attracts the attention of Ukrainians in Polish cities.\n\nWhat do Ukrainians like about Katowice?\n\nKatowice is the tenth-largest city in Poland, it is the capital of Upper Silesia and also a center of science, business and industry. This city in the south of Poland is an important transport hub for Europe. The population here for 2022 is 306,826 people.\n\nIn general, it is a modern city, the heart of the first metropolis in Poland, the place of many important events, and also full of greenery - with parks and forests for pleasant walks.\n\nIn addition, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest and Vienna are located within a radius of 600 kilometers from Katowice.\n\nThere are many reasons to visit Katowice. One of them is the acquisition of a European education. If you are planning to study, then Katowice is one of the best options for you. Here, they focus on the international labor market and do everything possible to ensure that their knowledge meets the demands of employers. Music and e-sports festivals, concerts and other cultural events await students in their free time from studies.\n\nIt is interesting that the local railway station annually serves more than 12 million people. From it you can easily go to other voivodeships and abroad. The trip to Hungary, the Czech Republic and France will be significantly shorter if you take a high-speed train.\n\nWhy would Ukrainians want to stay and live in Bydgoszcz?\n\nBydgoszcz is the capital of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland. The city is one of the largest cities in the country, 8th in terms of population (363,930 people), 10th in terms of area (175.98 km²). Bydgoszcz is surrounded by large forest areas, the city has many green areas, parks and forests. In addition, it is a large economic, cultural, scientific and sports center of the country.\n\nThe city is located on the river Brda, which flows into the famous Vistula, the largest river in Poland. This beautiful city is sometimes called \"Polish Amsterdam\".\n\nBydgoszcz will appeal to those who appreciate old, exquisite architecture. The residence of the voivode and the district museum are located here. In addition, most of the offices of the regional state administration are located in the city.\n\nWhat attracts Ukrainians to Bialystok?\n\nBiałystok is a city in northeastern Poland, on the Byala River. It is the administrative center of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The population of the city in 2022 is 295,245 people. Białystok is the eleventh largest city in Poland.\n\nIn addition, Białystok is the most ecological place to live in Poland. A third of the space here is green space. In this special microclimate, the summer heat is felt less.\n\nBiałystok went down in history as a multicultural city where people of different nationalities and religions lived, which determined the special character of the city. Location on the border with Belarus, Lithuania and Russia provides excellent conditions for economic and cultural development.\n\nBialystok is a center of food, woodworking, ceramic industry and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe city is the center of the Belarusian diaspora and one of the largest centers of Orthodoxy - there is even an Orthodox cathedral here.\n\nThe least popular Polish cities among Ukrainians\n\nThe smallest number of Ukrainians plan to settle permanently in Lublin (7%), Warsaw (12%) and Kielce (13%). Such statistics can be explained by the fact that the largest cities were easier for refugees to reach, and after the stress experienced, it seemed the best solution.\n\nMore conscious fellow citizens chose smaller cities or chose these destinations because of the presence of relatives there.\n\nHow do Poles feel about the influx of Ukrainians, and do they agree on further coexistence?\n\nAccording to research, the majority of Poles are not against the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees. According to the Openfield research, 77% of the Polish population actively helps people fleeing Russian aggression.\n\nFrom the beginning of the war until October, the average Pole spent about 349 zlotys on helping Ukrainians. In particular, 43% assure that they are ready to provide courier assistance in the future.\n\nAt the same time, 38% do not support the placement of Ukrainians. This was reported by the co-author of the study, Sabina Kubitsel-Lodzinska. Of these, 34% of local residents are not ready to rent apartments to Ukrainians and believe that they receive better assistance than Poles."
