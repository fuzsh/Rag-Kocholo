Their 2022 figures refer to the results of the Russian census in October 2021.\n\nParts of Donetsk oblast and of Luhansk oblast are not under control of the central government; their 2022 population was calculated by the Ukrainian statistical office \"according to available administrative data\". These figures are probably too high.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine since February 2022 has considerably impacts on the number and distribution of the population in Ukraine."
