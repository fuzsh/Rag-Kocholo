The aim of the project is to study the Kyiv region's Y-DNA, mtDNA and auDNA composition as well as to be a hub for all the people whose ancestors are from the region and hope to find more information. Kyiv is the oldest Eastern European and Slavic city with unique and rich history. It was the major trade hub and a political hub through middle ages. The project might shed light on patterns of migration and settlement of various tribes throughout the region and beyond."
