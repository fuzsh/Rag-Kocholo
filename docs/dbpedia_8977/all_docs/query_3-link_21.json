On the Polish-Ukrainian border, there are border crossing points: Yagodyn - Dorogusk, Ustylu - Zosyn, Krakowiec - Korchova, Shegyny - Medyka, Rava-Ruska - Hrebenne, Smilnytsia - Krotsenko, Hrushiv - Budomezh and Ughryniv - Dolgobychiv.\n\nIn the summer, passenger traffic at the borders of Ukraine increased by almost one and a half times. At the same time, queues at checkpoints increased. To avoid a long wait, prefer traveling at the beginning of the week. From Monday to Wednesday, passenger traffic is lower, and accordingly there are no long queues. Starting from Thursday evening until Sunday, the number of people willing to cross the border increases, which increases the load on checkpoints.\n\nTraditionally, the busiest checkpoints are Sheghini – Medyka, Rava-Ruska – Khrebenne and Krakowiec – Korchova. To avoid queues, you can build a travel route through less popular destinations. Instructions on how to check the occupancy of border crossing points are available via the link.\n\nA foreigner is allowed to enter Ukraine in his own car, but he can use it only for his own needs. Foreign citizens can drive cars with foreign license plates in Ukraine for up to one year. If you plan to stay in Ukraine longer than two months, you need to contact the service center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for temporary car registration. After the expiration of the one-year period, the car with foreign license plates must leave Ukraine.
