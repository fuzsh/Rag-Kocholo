        "text": "History of Zhytomyr\n\nOrigin of the name “Zhytomyr”\n\nAccording to a local legend, recorded by the historian of the 19th century, priest Nikolai Tripolsky, Zhytomyr was founded around 884, and received its name after Zhytomyr, one of the comrades of the Kyiv princes Askold and Dir. He allegedly refused to serve Prince Oleg the Seer, who began to rule Kyiv after killing Askold and Dir in 882, hid in the forests and settled on a high cliff at the confluence of the Kamyanka and Teteriv Rivers (today’s historical center of Zhytomyr).\n\nPavel Jozef Safarik, one of the first scientific Slavists, proposed a version that the original settlement arose as the center of the Zhytiches tribe, which was part of the tribal union of the Drevlians. Its name literally meaning the “settlement of the Zhytichs”, like the tribe name itself, whose main occupation was farming, originated from the important agricultural crop of this region - rye (“zhyto”).\n\nZhytomyr in the 13th-17th centuries\n\nIn 1240, Zhytomyr was first mentioned in written sources (“The Tale of Bygone Years”), when during the Mongol invasion it was captured and destroyed. In 1287, it was again devastated by the Mongols.\n\nIn 1320 (according to other sources - in 1324), it was captured by Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1362, Zhytomyr was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1399, the Golden Horde Khan Edigu defeated the army of the Lithuanian prince Vytautas, captured and plundered Zhytomyr. In the late 14th century, it was mentioned in the chronicle “The list of Russian towns far and near” under the name “Zhytomel”.\n\nIn 1444, Casimir IV, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted Magdeburg rights (a set of town privileges regulating the degree of internal autonomy) to Zhytomyr and built a small castle in it. The castle was not preserved, but this place became known as Castle Hill. In 1474, Ambrogio Contarini, a Venetian ambassador, visited Zhytomyr during his trip to Persia and wrote about it: “a fortified town with wooden buildings.”\n\nMore Historical Facts…\n\nIn the 1540s, the Zhytomyr castle was rebuilt and fortified according to the design of the local architect Semyon Babinsky. Its thick walls were surrounded by a defensive moat filled with water. The population of the town was about 600 people.\n\nIn 1569, after the Union of Lublin between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which laid the foundation for a federal state known as the Commonwealth, Zhytomyr became part of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1596, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III Vasa approved the right of Zhytomyr to hold two annual fairs, which contributed to the development of the town.\n\nIn 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1657), also known as the Cossack-Polish War, the troops of Bohdan Khmelnytsky stormed the Zhytomyr castle. The turning point in the history of the town was the year of 1667, when, under the terms of the Truce of Andrusovo between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kyiv remained under Russian control, and the Kyiv courts were transferred to Zhytomyr, which in fact also became the administrative center of the Kyiv Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland. This event gave impetus to the intensive development of Zhytomyr.\n\nZhytomyr in the 18th - 19th centuries\n\nIn 1724, the Jesuits opened a monastery and a school in the town. In 1765, there were 5 churches (2 Orthodox and 3 Catholic), one palace and 285 houses in Zhytomyr. In the second half of the 18th century, a large Jewish community formed here.\n\nIn 1793, as a result of the second partition of Poland, Zhytomyr became part of the Russian Empire as a county town of the Volyn Governorate. In 1798, about 5,400 people lived in Zhytomyr. In 1804, it received the status of the administrative center of the governorate. Zhytomyr was a relatively large center of trade (timber, livestock, hops, and other goods).\n\nThe abolition of serfdom in 1861 and the development of capitalist relations contributed to the transformation of Zhytomyr into an industrial and commercial center. In 1885, there were 5,207 houses in Zhytomyr (of which 1,152 were stone), including 4,127 residential (660 stone). In 1897, according to the first census of the population of the Russian Empire, 65,895 people lived in this city (30,572 Jews, 16,944 Russians, 9,152 Ukrainians, 7,464 Poles, 677 Germans). In 1899, a tram service was opened in Zhytomyr.\n\nZhytomyr in the 20th century\n\nIn 1913, the population of Zhytomyr was about 90,700 people. During the Civil War in the territory of the former Russian Empire, power in Zhytomyr changed more than ten times.\n\nIn 1925, Zhytomyr became the administrative center of the Zhytomyr district of Kyiv Oblast. In September 1937, it received the status of the capital of a separate Zhytomyr Oblast. In 1939, the population of the city was about 95 thousand people, its industry was still underdeveloped.\n\nOn July 9, 1941, during World War II, German troops captured Zhytomyr. On December 31, 1943, the Red Army finally managed to regain control of the city. During the war, about 40% of the housing stock was destroyed, almost all enterprises, engineering communications, a railway station, a tram depot, a power plant, etc. were damaged.\n\nThe city’s population reached its pre-war level only in the late 1950s. Since that time, the rapid development of Zhytomyr began. Dozens of industrial, transport, construction, and engineering facilities were built including a flax processing plant, a chemical fiber plant, a metal structures plant, a meat processing plant, a laboratory glass plant, etc. From 1968 to 1976, the number of people employed in industrial production doubled. New higher, secondary special, research, design organizations were opened in Zhytomyr.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1989, the population of Zhytomyr increased from 105,600 to 292,100 people. Since August 24, 1991, Zhytomyr has been the regional center of Zhytomyr Oblast of independent Ukraine.\n\nArchitecture of Zhytomyr\n\nZhytomyr - Features\n\nZhytomyr is located about 140 km west of Kyiv.

The coat of arms of Zhytomyr, approved in 1796, had the following description: “In the lower part of the shield, in a blue field, there are open gates topped by three towers. This coat of arms was given to it by the princes of Lithuania in old times” (Zhytomyr was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1362). The current coat of arms of Zhytomyr, approved in 1991, generally repeats its historical coat of arms.\n\nThe city is located in a zone characterized by a humid continental climate with warm summers and mild winters.
