        "text": "The battle for national supremacy makes its return this June 2023 with the staging of the PFF U19 Boys National Championship 2023.\n\nThe competition for Boys Under-19 players promises to be a more thrilling one with the expansion of the First Division from last year’s 10 teams to an expanded 12 teams this year, while the Second Division will have a brand new knockout format which will further foster football rivalries among the participating PFF Regional Football Associations and PFF Member Clubs.\n\n“We are pleased to see the return of the PFF U19 Boys National Championship,” said PFF president Mariano Araneta. “We owe the success of last year’s competition to all participating teams who have made their efforts to field competitive squads that led to intense match-ups all season long. We hope that this year’s competition will continue the trend of exciting matches and to find the next crop of Stars of Tomorrow.”\n\nThe First Division, which will be held from 21-29 June 2023, will see reigning national champions Negros Occidental FA stake its crown once more in Group A where they will face last year’s runners up National Capital Region FA, Laguna FA, Southeast Luzon Masbate RFA, and newly promoted teams Oriental Mindoro FA and Stallion FC. The Group A fixtures will be played at the PFF National Training Center in Carmona, Cavite.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dynamic HERB Sports Complex in Talisay City, Cebu will host Group B, which is composed of Davao South RFA, Panay FA, South Cotabato-Sarangani-General Santos City FA, Zamboanga-Dipolog FA, and the promoted teams from the second division Camiguin-Misamis Oriental RFA and Central Visayas FA.\n\nThe top two teams at the end of the National Group Stage will advance to the Final Round, while the bottom two teams in each group will go down to the Second Division.\n\n“Last year’s competition showed that the teams have taken the challenge seriously as it gave them the opportunity to battle against the top teams through the promotion and relegation system,” added PFF general secretary Atty. Edwin Gastanes. “These types of competitions are healthy avenues for players and coaches to gain valuable experience on a national scale.”\n\nThe Second Division, which shall commence on September 2023, will see the remaining 29 Regional Football Associations/Clubs battle it out in a home-or-away knockout tournament to determine the top two teams that will go up to the First Division next year.\n\n“Organized domestic youth competitions such as the PFF U19 Boys National Championship provide plenty of opportunities for players and teams to show their capabilities”, said PFF Head of Competitions Coco Torre. “We wish the teams all the success as they stake regional and national pride to determine the team that is worthy of being proclaimed national champions.”"
