        "text": "There's a new face at Arsenal and it's time to get to know Lina Hurtig. Here are the 17 things you need to learn about our new number 17.\n\n1) Lina was born September 5, 1995 in Avesta, Sweden\n\n2) She began her playing career at just 15 in the second tier of Swedish football. In Lina's first season, she recorded an immense 14 goals and four assists in just 20 appearances. Following interest from several clubs, she was snapped up by Damallsvenskan side, Umeå IK, the following season\n\n3) 10 years on, she joins us from Serie A champions, Juventus, where she spent two seasons\n\n4) Lina is no stranger to silverware. She won two back-to-back league titles with the Italian side, as well as two Italian Super Cups and one Coppa Italia\n\n5) Juve also gave her a taste for Champions League success. In fact, Lina rocketed a volley into the roof of the net to send Juventus into the Champions League quarter finals in 2021\n\n6) There are some very familiar faces on the Arsenal teamsheet for Lina, who has already played alongside Frida Maanum and Stina Blackstenius at Linköpings FC. Stina and Lina are now teammates for club and country as fellow Swedish internationals\n\n7) Lina was a key player for Linköpings from 2017 to 2020. They won the Swedish Damallsvenskan in her first season at the club\n\n8) As well as club success, she plays regular international football. Lina has 58 caps for Sweden, with a total of 19 goals to her name. Most recently, she found the net in a 3-1 win against Brazil earlier this year\n\n9) Lina received her first call-up to the Swedish senior squad in 2012 under footballing legend, Pia Sundhage. Her first cap came in a 1-1 draw with Canada in November 2014\n\n10) Before that, she represented her country at the youth level. Lina was a regular starter in the Swedish side that won the Under 19s European Championship in 2012, alongside Magdalena Eriksson and Fridolina Rolfö\n\n11) An incredibly versatile forward who is able to play across the front line, Lina feels most at home on the left wing\n\n12) She spent most of her 56 appearances for Juventus in that position, whipping in crosses and scoring a series of stunning one-touch goals\n\n13) But it's also Lina's work off the ball that makes her a constant threat to defenders. This dedication and tenacity makes her a perfect fit for Jonas Eidevall's Arsenal\n\n14) An aerial specialist, Lina is also especially dangerous in set piece situations, and her ability to shrug off close marking is first-rate\n\n15) Her former international coach, Pia Sundhage, said that Lina had every chance of becoming a truly world-class football player\n\n16) She's joined in England by her wife, Lisa, and one-year-old daughter, Lo. Lisa and Lina met whilst playing for Umeå IK and they were married in 2019"
