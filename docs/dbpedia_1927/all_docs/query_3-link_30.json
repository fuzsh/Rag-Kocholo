It was the first time the winners of the first two tournaments played in 1992 and 1994 have medaled since finishing third in 1998.\n\nGermany was the last nation to win a European title before Austria’s dominance, back in 2008, and the Germans took fifth place with a 41-12 win at home over Italy.\n\nThere were two road wins during the closing weekend of the 2023 competition, the first of which came at the Butts Arena in Coventry where France triumphed 21-7 over Great Britain to finish seventh overall. The other away win came in Belgium where visitors Switzerland edged their hosts 19-14 in the battle for eleventh place. Ninth place finishers were the Czech Republic, who turned away the challenge from Spain by a score of 34-21.\n\n2023 IFAF Europe U19 Championships\n\nChampionship Game\n\nAustria 42 – Sweden 24\n\nBronze Medal Game\n\nFinland 28 – Denmark 22\n\nFifth Place Game\n\nGermany 41 – Italy 12\n\nSeventh Place Game\n\nFrance 21 – Great Britain 7\n\nNinth Place Game\n\nCzechia 34 – Spain 21\n\nEleventh Place Game"
