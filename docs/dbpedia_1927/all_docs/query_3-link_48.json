        "text": "Head Coach Chris Stone said: “We’ve got a great offensive line and that’s where it all starts. It makes so many things possible. I don’t have to rely on any one individual and that’s the way we look at things on offence. Whether it’s the running backs, receivers or quarter backs. We don’t have one player that needs to carry the load. I’ve got multiple Ferraris in the garage.”\n\nThe defensive also drew much credit. Defensive Co-ordinator Wayne Hill added: “We had objectives to start fast, play physical and do our job. We have a lot of athletes on our defensive unit and were able to showcase that today. We know that if we control the tempo we are going to be good.”\n\nThe Lions now look ahead to a trip to Germany in May."
