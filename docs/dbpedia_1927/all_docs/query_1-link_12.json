The top two nations in each of the two groups will then progress to the semi-finals.\n\nHead coach Gemma Davies guided the WU19s to the finals with three wins out of three in April’s qualifying round, with eight goals scored and none conceded in victories against Wales, Iceland and Belgium.\n\n“The spotlight is on our game this summer with the senior EUROs in England and our players have the perfect platform to show what they can do before it all begins,\" said Davies, ahead of the trip.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for them to experience tournament football and learn more about what goes into representing your country. While we are looking to perform in every match, it's an important step for them to develop as individuals on and off the pitch as they work their way through the pathway.”\n\nEngland, featuring Lucy Bronze and Demi Stokes, won the competition in 2009 with a 2-0 defeat of Sweden and have been runners-up on three previous occasions in 2007, 2010 and 2013. Germany remain the most successful nation at this level with six titles overall, while they were also runners-up in the last two editions.\n\nThe Squad\n\nGoalkeepers: Khiara Keating (Manchester City), Natalia Negri (Unattached)\n\nDefenders: Tara Bourne (Manchester United), Anouk Denton (University of Louisville), Jorja Fox (Chelsea), Neve Herron (Sunderland), Ruby Mace (Manchester City), Olivia McLoughlin (Aston Villa), Lucy Parry (Liverpool), Caitlin Smith (Clemson University)\n\nMidfielders: Laura Blindkilde Brown (Aston Villa), Grace Clinton (Everton), Lucia Kendall (Southampton), Mia Ross (Charlton Athletic), Maisie Symonds (Brighton and Hove Albion), Charlotte Wardlaw (Chelsea)\n\nForwards: Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Freya Gregory (Aston Villa), Emily Murphy (University of North Carolina), Lucy Watson (Sheffield United)\n\nGIRLS' FOOTBALL: GET INVOLVED"
