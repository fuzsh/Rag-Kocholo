I have a solution\", I triumphantly declared to our chairman.\n\nHe smiled at me and asked, \"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. And it is a good one.\"\n\n\"Let me hear it!\"\n\n\"Pontus Dahlberg.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Pontus Dahlberg.\"\n\nThe chairman looked at me as if I was a lunatic. \"You know that they want 35 million euros for him, right?\"\n\nAll of a sudden he started laughing. \"Good joke, Mr. A, good joke indead. So, what about the keeper situation? Who are we getting?\"\n\nI solemnly looked at him. And repeated, \"Pontus Dahlberg. From Watford. We´re getting him. I´ve got the price down to under 20.\"\n\n---\n\nA week later - on the 5th of February, 2022 - a signing that sent shockwaves through the Swedish football community was announced.\n\nPontus Dahlberg, playing for Championship side Watford, had signed for Swedish champions Hammarby IF for an amount that shattered all Swedish transfer records - 19,5M EUR. 60% was paid up fron, 40% to be paid in three instalments over the next three years.\n\nWhile the last season that saw Hammarby crowned as champions had seen some lavish spending (by Swedish standards) from Mr. A´s Hammarby side, this was unfathomable.\n\n\"I want Hammarby to evolve\", Mr. A said in an interview following the record signing. \"I want us to reach the group stage of the Champions League this year. In a few year's time I want us to challenge for a place in the knockout rounds and I think that last season has clearly shown that no Swedish club will come close to our success for the next ten years to come, but Sweden is not enough. We need to conquer Europe as well.\"\n\n\"We have a clear plan and vision, and we have a board who are willing to work towards that. If this means paying almost 20M EUR for a player, we have to do it. We needed a goalkeeper that can take us to the next level and we got it, besides I sold players for nearly 10M in total before making this deal.\"\n\nWould this record signing usher in a new era in Swedish football or would it turn out to be nothing but a failed gamble from an overconfident manager who somehow managed to get the board of directors on his side?\n\nThe Club\n\nHammarby IF is the most popular club in Sweden, with fanatical fans that and a great atmosphere during all matches. With an average home attendance of around 24 000 both in 2018 and 2019, Hammarby drew the most fans in Allsvenskan, the highest tier in Swedish football. The loyalty of the fans is huge, when Hammarby were down in the second tier they average over 20 000 fans per home game in 2014 - which, if I recall correctly, made Hammarby the club with the highest average attendance in all of Scandinavia, despite playing in the second tier. Here are some videos of our fantastic fans in action: 31 000 in 2nd Tier Game / Hammarby IF Ultras Best Moments / Hammarby-Djurgården 2016 / Hammarby-Malmö 2019\n\nWhile Hammarby have always been a people´s club, results on the pitch have rarely matched the fanaticism of Hammarby supporters. For example, their first - and as of 2019 only - league win came back in 2001. In 2019 Hammarby were in a fight for the gold with Malmö FF and local rivals Djurgården with the winner being decided only in the last round of play, and despite Hammarby and Malmö both winning their games, Djurgården managed to turn around an early 2-0 deficit to clinch a 2-2 draw which was enough for the win. Malmö finished second, Hammarby third. Hammarby was playing an extremely offensive game, pressing high up and scoring loads of goals - a grand total of 75 in 30 games. However, Hammarby also conceded a lot (38 - more than Djurgården and Malmö combined).\n\nOur biggest rivals are the apes (Djurgårdens IF) and the rats (AIK Solna), although we harbor a strong dislike for IFK Göteborg and Malmö FF as well.\n\nThe Save / Current Squad\n\nI chose 2020 as start date, since I did not want to replay the 2019 season. Tactically, I chose a narrow 4-1-3-2, with a very offensive mindset. I will post the tactics I currently use later, but I did discuss the base for the tactics in this thread. In the first season my resources were quite limited, but I still signed 14 players for a total of 2,5M EUR, while selling 6 players for a total profit of 1,25M EUR. Results were good - I won the Swedish Cup, reached the group stage of the Euro Cup and only barely missed out on the knockout stages, and finished second in Allsvenskan. For 2021 I got a huge budget (I think it was 13M) at the start of the season, so I significantly improved the squad. For 2022 - the current year - I really needed a first-choice goalkeeper, and I preferred one with a high one-on-ones rating due to me allowing a lot of one-on-ones thanks to my tactics, so I managed to get Pontus Dahlberg as referenced above.\n\nStar Players\n\nPontus Dahlberg, GK\n\nRock solid, young and with potential to improve further. Should be able to lead our club to glory in the future (or at least recoup the 20M I paid for him).\n\nEthan Ampadu, DC\n\nHe is just awesome. Got him on a two-year loan from Chelsea before the start of the last season, have now managed to extend the loan to the end of the 2023 season. Really hope Chelsea won´t recall him, but I doubt that I will be able to afford him once the loan expires.\n\nDarijan Bojanic, MC\n\nThis one I had a hard time choosing, and attributes-wise maybe there are a few players that have slightly better attributes, however Darijan is my playmaker choice No 1 and he consistantly delivers.\n\nThe Tactics\n\nHere they are. I basically try to play a high-pressure offense, with the leftmost tactic being my base tactic, the middle one for away games against competent teams and/or situations where I want a less gung-ho approach, and the rightmost is a new creation for this season, to be used in situations where I need to close out games or against significantly better teams. However, the results of the defensive tactic have not been as good as I hoped (and for season 1 I also had a tactic where one of the forwards was substituted for a DMC, but it did not work too good) so I might skip it, although my sample size is quite small.\n\nThe Squad\n\nBasically, a good squad more than capable of reaching my goals (qualifying for the CL group stage, winning the Allsvenskan). However, I am looking for another striker (preferably young with potential) and midfielder (superstar with potential), and in general I am always on the lookout for improvements.\n\nThe Season So Far\n\nSince I am starting this write-up halfway throught the 2022 season, I will just paste the results so far to get the save up to real-time quickly:\n\nA shocking 2-0 loss in my first game had me fuming, but after thrashing one of our main rivals 7-0 in the next game (they did get an early red card), I managed to go on a nice undefeated run...\n\n...however, I have not kept it up, going an abysmal 3-3-2 in July/August, and suffering my worse loss so far, getting crushed 5-1 by the apes. Yeah, I did rest quite a lot of players since I needed to qualify for the CL, but still - it was an abysmal and shameful result. The first derby loss of this save, if I remember correctly. Disgraceful.\n\nAnd as a result of this poor stretch of form, I am 6 points behind with only six games to go. However, I do have a game in hand, so that should make the difference only three points, and I have a relatively easy schedule remaining, with a home fixture against 6th-placed Örebro being the toughest game, and then five teams placed between 9 and 15 in the table. However, some of my second-choice players have been hugely disappointing, and although my main priority will be the league, I still need to field decent teams in the CL since I don´t want to lose each game 8-0. Oh, yes, regarding the CL, I would give us a 0% chance of reaching the knockout stage and maybe a 10% chance of scraping a third place:\n\nMy goal is to be somewhat competitive in the home fixtures against FCP and Valencia, and try not to lose to big away and against PSG.\n\nHammarby IF - PSG\n\n\"Mr. A told us that we are in the big leagues and that we need to fight for every inch of the pitch\", Ethan Ampadu said after the game.\n\n\"Yeah, he also said something along the lines of don´t you dare to back off just because it is f****ing Neymar running at you\", added captain Jeppe Andersen.\n\nThe players were tired, but proud, having held giants PSG to a goalless draw. Ampadu also had two headers hit the bar after set pieces, but otherwise Hammarby was on the defensive for most of the game. Despite having most of the ball (57%) and a lot of shots (17 attempts, 11 on target), PSG failed to get the ball past a spirited Hammarby goalie and did not create too many dangerous chances.\n\nPaul Pogba had a dangerous shot from outside the box, but Hammarby keeper Dahlberg managed to push it to a corner. After eighty minutes Mbappé got the best chance of the game after running clear of the defense, however Dahlberg came out at the right moment and deflected his shot clear, after which Hammarby managed to see out the game without much trouble.\n\n\"The lads gave their all\", said Mr. A during the post-match press conference, \"and I am so proud of their performance. I also wish to salute the fans - yet again. They are brilliant and I dedicate this game to them.\"\n\nLineups:\n\nHammarby: Dahlberg - Bigode, Ampadu, Milosevic, Andersson (Widgren 82´) - Andersen, Junior Ngouali, Allan, Björkengren (Fällman 59´) - Seljmani, Johannsson (Suzuki 70´)\n\nPSG: Navas - Marquinhos, Skriniar, Rugani, Emerson - Busquets (Yazici 83´), Haidara, Pogba - Everton (Icardi 72´), Neymar, Mbappé\n\nThe Hammarby Fan Post, 13th September 2022\n\n2 hours ago, ManUtd1 said:\n\nLove a Swedish save! Good luck!\n\nThanks!\n\nSeptember Review\n\nSeptember was... decent, I guess. I picked up the best result so far (if looking at an individual match) in my goalless draw vs PSG, however not crushing Brommapojkarna wasn't part of my plans, after that game I was actually five points off the lead and starting to get worried. However, a scrappy win against Örebro and a comfortable one over Helsingborg later has me going into the last three games in first place, albeit only on goal difference:\n\nCL went as expected, as I was comfortably beaten by Valencia and Porto. If I manage at least a point from the last three games, I will be satisfied, anything more than that is a huge bonus. With the other three teams sitting at 6/6/4 points, there is basically no chance at all of getting the third place.\n\nHowever, September also brought some good news on the transfer front, as I was able to solve my striker issues for next year (and, hopefully, for the next many years) as I managed to strike a deal for Willem Geubbels:\n\nI remembered him as a beast from my last FM2019 save, where he was a great striker around 2024 or so, so when one of my scouts found him, and further scouting confirmed he was good and available, I went out and got him for 4M. This will probably see me change my forward setup next year, from two PF(a) to CF(a) and PF(a) most likely, in order to utilise Geubbels´ great numbers in the best way possible:\n\nFor October I have one goal and that is to win the last three league games and secure my second straight championship, which should be more than doable considering I am facing the 10th and 13th placed teams at home, and the 15th place team away. Also no CL games in between, so at least for the last two games I will be able to field a fully fit best eleven. The month ends with Porto coming to Nya Söderstadion (or Tele2 Arena as it is officially called) and an away trip to Paris, before I wrap up my CL adventure on the 1st of November when we will take on Valencia at home.\n\nEdited December 3, 2019 by andrisk123\n\nOctober Review\n\nThat went south quickly. Against Östersund we scored an early goal but failed to increase our lead, and as so often is the case in such games, they managed to equalise in the second half with their only shot on goal. And my title challenge was on the rocks, with Norrköping now holding a two point lead. And then came the next shock - the away game against AFC Eskilstuna was scheduled in the middle of an international break and I did not have any opportunity to ask for a postponement. At half-time it was a goalless draw, but in the second half I broke through and scored... and what was even better, BK Häcken grabbed an equaliser against IFK Norrköping in the 85th minute, so after 29 played games I was on top again!\n\nSomething seems broken with the scheduling in FM, since my last game was played on a Friday (all games are supposed to kick off at the same time) - I duly won it 2-0, so in order to grab the title from me, IFK Norrköping needed to beat AFC Eskilstuna at home by at least five goals. Not an impossible task for the only team that has scored more than me in the past two seasons, however the game fizzled out to a boring 1-1 draw and we won our second straight league title:\n\nA bit pissed that Djurgården managed to clinch a contintental competition spot after a superb, undefeated second half of the season. And what is interesting, this year I did not win any of the halves - 34 points in the first half was good enough for second behind Kalmar (36) and 29 points in the second half meant I was second behind Djurgården (33). In the end only the total result matters, of course.\n\nIn the CL I had a surprisingly good home fixture against FC Porto (who crushed me away), away against PSG I only lost 1-0 although PSG could have easily scored a couple more. This did mean that I had a chance to reach third place if I managed to beat Valencia at home in the last round, with Hammarby on 4 points and Valencia on 6. Considering my performance against Porto, I felt that we actually had a decent chance to move into third.\n\nNovember Review\n\nWell, it wasn´t to be. Despite scoring a first-half goal, Valencia played a high-pressure offensive 4-3-3 and hassled us to make mistakes, and in the 70th minute they grabbed the equaliser. We had a good chance in the 86th, but the shot went wide and with a 1-1 draw we finished last in our group. However, we were undefeated at home, having beaten Porto 3-1 and drawn PSG (0-0) and Valencia (1-1) which bodes well for the future. November also saw our scouts find what I hope will turn out to be a gem of a player, who had a 1,2M release clause and who had drawn interest from Chelsea and Tottenham:\n\nAt 1.2M he is a real bargain. After coming through the youth ranks of Red Star Belgrade, he joined Manchester City for 2,3M in 2017/18. During his three seasons as a City player, he spent time on loan at Red Star and Zemun, as well as two seasons playing for NAC Breda in Holland, before being bought back by Red Star Belgrade for a measly 180 000 at the start of the 2021/22 season. He did well for Red Star (29 league games in 1,5 seasons, 2 goals 3 assists and 7.17 AVR) and looking at his numbers and age, he should be perfect fit for my Hammarby squad, as he should fit both for the playmaker role as well as for the box-to-box midfielder role.\n\nAfter our succesful CL run, Hammarby now has 29 million in the bank, with 19 million available for me to spend. I enquired about Ethan Ambadu, but Chelsea set an asking price of 106M which of course is a tad too steep. I want to improve on my CL run and what I basically am looking for is sub-23 players with star potential, or ready superstars under 30. Midfield looks pretty good, defense is lacking depth and I would not mind another superstar striker, especially since my strikers were struggling all season (Johannsson 37 games/15 goals, Suzuki 42/7, Seljmani 30/6) and Johannsson is on the decline (age 32).\n\nSince I play with attribute masking (otherwise the game is so boring, just tap in the numbers and get the best value for money options available), I am hoping that my scouts will come up with some nice finds for me.\n\nEdited December 4, 2019 by andrisk123\n\n2023 Season Preview\n\nIn the end last season turned out very well. Winning the league, getting five points in the CL and only being 30 minutes away from reaching the Euro Cup knockout stages made the season a success. The off-season saw a lot of players not needed for the first team leave, and five new signings (one was a prospect signed by my staff). Willem Geubbels, whom I expect to be my best striker for 2023, I already presented, as well as Ivan Ilic, a great prospect I got at a very cheap price. The other two players are young and talented rotational options for my first team squad - Axel Wallenborg, DL, signed from Brommapojkarna for 650 000:\n\nHe came through the Brommapojkarna youth system and has already played in 81 league games for them (54 of them in Allsvenskan during 2021-2022) and looks like a real bargain already. He should get quite a lot of playing time and that will hopefully see him develop into a great player within a few years. My assistant already has Wallenberg as first-choice DL.\n\nI also signed Ignace van der Brempt, DR, from FC Porto for 2,3M:\n\nVan der Brempt started his career in Club Brugge, where he played two games in two seasons, before joining KV Mechelen at the start of the 2020/21 campaign. He transferred to FCP, but only played for the B Team in the Portugese second divison, before now joining Hammarby in an attempt to kickstart his professional career. He will be getting regular playing time, however I feel that Wallenborg is a bit further along the curve at the current moment. My scouts feel that van der Brempt has great potential though, so I feel this is a good signing for us.\n\nThese signings give us good depth on the full-back positions. However, I still need one great central defender (tried to sign a couple but too high wages) and I would prefer to get another striker in as well, however DC is my key priority. With a 17M transfer budget I am just waiting for the right player to show up and I am not really in a rush, since I am not playing in Europe until autumn I can postpone this to the summer transfer window instead. For the domestic league and cup, my squad depth is more than fine and the players are also more than good enough. It is for the continental competitions that I need more star quality and better quality depth.\n\nPre-season was kind of crap, but who care about that anyway. Did some tactical experiments and so on. Board expects me to challenge for the league title, reach the Swedish Cup final and be competitive in the CL, I see anything less than winning the league and reaching the group stage, where I hopefully can challenge for third place given a decent draw. The Swedish Cup I don´t care too much about, so whatever.\n\nFebruary Review\n\nOne thing I really like about the Swedish Cup is that it basically gives one the chance to get into gear for the season against easy opponents, instead of playing meaningless friendlies. February passed without any movement in the transfer front, and after using preseason friendlies to experiment with more defensive tactics I however did the only sensible thing and pressed the Clear Slot button, since the defensive set-ups I tried failed to produce better results than when using my regular, offensive tactics. I did, however, create a new tactic which at least in theory should be just a tad more defensive than my regular ones, even though it is pretty f***ing far from being defensive:\n\nSo, it basically has one striker less and one DM more, and the left full back is on support instead of attack, with the idea being that the left side needs more cover due to the Volante and BBM with the \"get further forward\" instruction set on this flank, while the right flank keeps its attacking duty due to having an Anchor Man and regular BBM. The lone striker should have enough support from the midfield and if the opponent chooses to push higher up and play with a high defensive line they should be vulnerable to through balls from the back.\n\nThe tactic made its debut in the Swedish Cup match against Sirius, and I used it in the other cup matches as well.\n\nResults were okay, not more, however I am happy with the stats the tactic produced. 26 shots/16 on goal/3 CCC vs 5/4/1 in game one, 15/9/3 vs 8/3/1 in game two, 13/5/4 vs 1/1/0 in game three, with my possession standing at 69/61/58 in the three games.\n\n5/7 goals were scored from within the box. Four assists from the central midfielders, two from my right back, one unassisted goal. Three goals from through balls. So basically, I will continue to experiment with this tactic - hopefully it can be of use against stronger teams away as well, although the main weakness (one-on-ones conceded on through balls past my high defensive line) remains.\n\nMarch Review & Deadline Day\n\nSo, only one competitive game in March. The first real test for my new tactic came in the Swedish Cup Quarter Final. Facing off against the only more goal-happy team in Sweden (IFK Norrköping), there was a surprising lack of chances created from both sides, although I had a significant advantage. Then I got a red card in the 67th, and despite creating a great chance later on, the game went to extra time. Unfortunately, they scored in the 115th minute so I yet again exited the cup early, and then played some meaningless friendlies to get the fitness levels up:\n\nCome deadline day, I sold my second/third choice left back Dennis Widgren. At age 29 he won´t develop more and I have better options available, so letting him go to Kalmar for 1.4M felt right. I also made an impulsive signing, only seeing the stats partially, since there was no time to scout the player more thoroughly. I present to you Mamoudou Diallo, a 20-year old Belgian central defender:\n\nSigned as a youth player by Standard in 2019, he quickly transferred to AA Gent for 1.2M, where he played in 10 league games in the 2021/22 campaign, before joining RB Leipzig for 5.5M. In 2022/23, he played in 10 first team games in total, but Leipzig were willing to sell him for 3.2M - so a young centre-back with promising fundamentals for a reasonable price, why not?\n\nHad I seen the full picture I might have passed due to him being useless as a ball-playing defender, but on the other hand I should be fine changing one of the central defender slots to CD when he is playing. If he will develop his mental side, he might turn into a beast - if not, well, he´ll be decent enough to be a rotational option in domestic games for years to come and if he isn´t happy with that role, I am sure I will have no problems selling him on.\n\nApril Review\n\nReigning champions Hammarby are off to a great start, to the delight of their many fans:\n\nThe game at Kalmar was quite a tough one and probably could have gone either way, the first game against AIK wasn´t too great either but we got the job done, in the other games I have dominated. And Geubbels! What a great start he has had in my club:\n\n7 goals and 2 assists in 5 games. Lovely.\n\nIn other news, I just signed a player to form a long-term striker partnership with Geubbels, and also renewed Dahlberg´s contract. Finally my scouts found a player that had the necessary attributes and was affordable enough. I present striker Ikoma Lois Openda - a Club Brugge product, he made his first-team debut back in 2018, and has grabbed 28 goals in 83 league games. He also spent a season on loan in Oostende, where he scored 11 goals in 29 games with an average rating of 7,09. He should slot right in with Geubbels to form a formidable offensive partnership.\n\nDue to the annoying limit of only being able to offer 20k/w in wages, I had to fill his contract with a number of clauses. Realistically, he should be able to cash in another 1M EUR in bonuses each year, but I got my player and I can afford him, so whatever. Will join right before my Champions League campaign - so let´s hope for an even better run this year.\n\n\"Fire the Bastard Already!\"\n\nWhile Bournemouth fans were happy to see Mr. A take over the club right before deadline day, results have not gone the right way and fans are vocal about their lack of support for Mr. A and his management style.\n\n\"Look at the players he sold\", one upset fans wrote on a fan forum, \"and look who he brought in - Camavinga for 70M, who is yet to score a goal or even provide an assist!\"\n\n\"Fire the bastard already!\", another one commented, adding that \"he will get us relegated, we were safe before he came and now we are one game for the championship.\"\n\nThe first game under Mr. A was a sign of bad times to come, with Bournemouth collapsing to a 1-6 loss away to Everton despite taking the lead early in the second half. Although Mr. A´s Bournemouth squad bounced back with a 2-0 home win over Tottenham, Bournemouth are winless for 11 games since then. Coming in to the final game of the season, the Cherries are in 17th place, ahead of Fulham only on goal difference.\n\nBournemouth management refused to comment on the future of Mr. A, who enjoyed great success in Sweden before becoming manager of Bournemouth in January.\n\nThe Bournemouth FanMag, 18th of May, 2024\n\nBoard Has Confidence in Mr. A as Cherries Stay Up\n\nIn a game that could have gone either way, Dominic Solanke scored what proved to be the only goal of the game in the 73rd minute after a nice pass from Ludvig Augustinsson. As Fulham battled to a goalless draw at Everton, Bournemouth managed to stave off relegation on the final day of the season.\n\nIn a statement a few hours after the final game, the Bournemouth board upset many fans who were hoping that this would be Mr. A´s final game in charge.\n\n\"After a meeting with Mr. A\", the Bournemouth board wrote, \"and after evaluating this season in its entirety, we want to re-iterate that we have full confidence in Mr. A.\"\n\nFans on social media were particularly upset with the board stating that \"Mr. A likes his teams to play attractive, attacking football which fits perfectly with our view of how football should be played\", with words as \"blatantly ignorant\" and \"a mockery\" being used to describe this statement.\n\nUnder Mr. A, Bournemouth has a 2-4-8 record and a 9-25 goal difference.\n\nThe Bournemouth FanMag, 19th of May, 2024\n\nTransfer Summary\n\nA Farewell to Wingers:\n\nAnd a welcome to two central midfielders:\n\nWhine Dendoncker did decently enough (basically as expected), Camavinga - who was supposed to be my new midfield star:\n\nRepaid my faith in him with the following statline:\n\n2024/2025 - A Summary\n\nSo, the first season went very un-well, and I was low on faith in my tactics, and low on faith in my players, and board and fans were low on faith in me. But I chose to press on, figuring that continuity is the way to go, and after all, I need to know if my tactics simply worked because I had the best players at Hammarby (although I did do better than expected against better teams in Europe), or if they actually are legit enough. The summer brought sweeping changes, with a lot of mediocre and/or aging players (or players who do not fit in my tactics) leaving:\n\nWith a similar amount of new players joining:\n\nSince I needed a lot of players, I basically went shopping for bargains, with Ntcham and McTominay joining from recently relegated sides and Greg Taylor being an absolut steal from Celtic:\n\nThe rest were backup players, with Solomon Bonnah looking quite decent:\n\nI was off to a decent enough start to avoid having to fear for my job:\n\nAnd I continued to be decent enough through October and November:\n\nAnd while December started of terribly and I started to fear a huge losing streak ending in relegation battle, however, then I won four in a row:\n\nAnd I ended the year in better-than-expected shape. And I managed to greatly strengthen my squad at the start of the transfer window with a Brazilian wonderkid striker:\n\nAnd my old Hammarby favorite Ethan Ampadu, who - after having spent four years on loan at my beloved Hammarby - I got for a measly 2,9M after Chelsea transfer listed him:\n\nDeadline Day saw me moving Cedric Kipré (who I was basically playing only since I had no better options) to Sevilla for 22M, instead getting another young Brazilian who looks great:\n\nMy only loss in January came at home against Liverpool:\n\nAnd my good run of form continued in February and March:\n\nAnd in April I only lost to Arsenal:\n\nWith May seeing me close out the season on a high note:\n\nResulting in Bournemouth´s best-ever finish and continental football next year!\n\nSecond half of the season was just amazing, with us going 12-2-5 - only Liverpool (40 points) and Man City (41 points) had better second-half records!\n\nEdited December 9, 2019 by andrisk123"
