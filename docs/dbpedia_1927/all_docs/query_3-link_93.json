        "text": "By Chris Goldberg\n\nPhillylacrosse.com, Posted 8/5/24\n\nChris Burnetta said he never felt overwhelmed as a 16-year-old while playing for Team Ireland in the recent U20 European Lacrosse Championships in Wroclaw, Poland.\n\n“I was the youngest player on the team, but none of my teammates treated me any differently,” said Burnetta. “I feel like my whole team was a bunch of big brothers.”\n\nIf Burnetta was considered a little brother, he more than held his own. The Haverford School 2027 attackman led Ireland in scoring (15 goals, 10 assists) and helped his team win its first U20 title 9 days ago.\n\n“Playing for the Irish U-20 national team in Poland was awesome,” said Burnetta, who plays club for Team Ten. “It was super cool to represent Ireland, especially since my mom grew up and met my dad there.\n\n“When I played against guys who were way older, particularly this defender for Switzerland who goes to RIT, it certainly took some getting used to. However, it was a fun challenge and I didn’t feel out of place on the field at all.”\n\nBurnetta learned of the tournament just a few months earlier during a talk with Performance Academy owner Todd MacFarlane during a training session. MacFarlane had experience in International play since he’s a Scotland National Men’s Team assistant and recommended he try out for the Ireland team (children of those born in a country are eligible).”\n\nIreland (7-0) won the crown with a 10-7 conquest of defending champion England. Burnetta had 2 goals and 2 assists in the title win and earned all-tournament selection – rare for a 16-year-old.\n\n“My teammates were incredible, and everyone was genuinely excited to be there,” said Burnetta. “The team was fully committed to the goal of winning a championship, which made playing so much easier and enjoyable.\n\n“Our coaches were so dedicated to our team, so it was awesome to see their hard work pay off at the end of the tournament with a championship win. The city of Wroclaw was incredible, so exploring it with my team was an unforgettable experience.”\n\nIreland opened the championships on July 19 with an 8-3 win over Germany, then on Saturday, Ireland beat Switzerland 14-1. Ireland returned to play Monday, July 22, against Latvia and won 11-5 and then dominated Israel, 11-3, on July 23. On Wednesday, July 24, Ireland beat the Netherlands 10-3, and it defeated Sweden 11-3 on Friday, July 26 as Burnetta had 4G and 3A (Haverford High’s Nils McCallion had one goal for Sweden).\n\nIn the championship match against England, Ireland jumped to a 6-3 lead in the first two periods, before England cut it to 6-5 going into halftime. Ireland then scored four goals to take a commanding 10-5 lead.\n\n“Everyday, we’d wake up for a morning practice, usually a walk-through, before heading back to the hotel or into town for lunch,” Burnetta said. “Then, we’d get prepped for the game of the day. After our game, we’d eat dinner together and then review film in preparation for our next game.\n\n“Spending all this time together, our team grew super close, and it helped us with our on-field chemistry. Overall, I absolutely loved my time over there, and I know my teammates are going to be my friends for life.”\n\nBurnetta credited Macfarlane for encouraging him to try out for Team ireland.\n\n“When Coach Mac first told me, he was extremely enthusiastic about me joining the team,” Burnetta said. “I didn’t know at the time that there would be a U-20 team competing in Poland, but I was aware such tournaments existed. It was really just Coach Mac’s enthusiasm which made me so excited to try out for the team.”\n\nMacFarlane sounded like a proud parent after hearing how well Burnetta performed. “I could not be more proud of Chris,” said MacFarlane. “He works hard in and out of the classroom, is a multisport athlete, crushes grades and is just a solid individual. Playing international lacrosse is really a celebration of the game and I’m excited that Chris and his family were able to enjoy the experience.”"
