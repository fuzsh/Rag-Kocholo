        "text": "Celtic have shown an interest in teenage Hammarby winger Bazoumana Toure, according to a report.\n\nSwedish outlet fotbolldirekt.se states that the Hoops had a scout watching the 18-year-old in his side’s recent 2-0 win over Brommapojkarna, in which he scored.\n\nSince joining Hammarby from ASEC Mimosas in March, Toure has scored three goals and assisted two in just 10 appearances.\n\nAlong with the likes of Crystal Palace, Bayer Leverkusen, and Frankfurt, Celtic are keen on signing the three-time capped Ivory Coast under-20 internationalist, however, a summer move might not be simple.\n\nIndeed, Hammarby is not keen on letting the player go this window because he has not even been with the club for six months.\n\nIf the Bhoys did get the left-winger in, though, it remains to be seen whether he would join up with the first-team or B side, who compete in the Lowland League, Scotland’s fifth tier.\n\nValued on Transfermarkt at little under £3m, any deal would be costly for the Hoops, especially considering Toure is contracted in Sweden until December 2028.\n\nHis name is one to monitor over the closing month of the window."
