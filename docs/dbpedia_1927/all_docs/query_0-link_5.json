Photo: Tomas Sedin / Sedinbild.\n\nDamallsvenskan Round 20 Wrap:\n\nKristianstads gained an important victory in the Champions League race as they ended Hammarby‘s recent excellent form with a 3-1 win in front of 725 fans. The home side stamped their authority on the game early when Amanda Andradottir put them ahead with 12 minutes played. Ten minutes into the second half, the prolific Tabby Tindell doubled Kristianstads lead after being played in by Mia Carlsson. Hammarby brought on Matildas pair Courtney Nevin and Elise Kellond-Knight in response, joining Kyra Cooney-Cross who started the match. However, Emelia Oskarsdottir extended the home side’s lead further before a consolation for the visitors came at the end when Savage Hashish benefited from Fanny Rönnlund’s assist.\n\nRosengård remain top after a comprehensive 6-2 win over struggling IFK Kalmar – but they certainly did not have it all their own way. Indeed, the visitors built leads of 1-0 and 2-1 before succumbing to the defending champions’ quality. Viola Nambi put Kalmar ahead with 13 minutes on the clock before Olivia Schough fed Mia Persson to level within 120 seconds. Wilma Finnman restored the visitors’ lead before the half-hour mark before Ria Öling levelled matters eight minutes from the break. The second half was all Rosengård as strikes from Loreta Kullashi and an 18-minute hat-trick from Karin Lundin sealed the points to the delight of the 876 fans.\n\nBK Häcken‘s faltering Champions League qualification hopes gained a boost with a 2-1 win at Eskilstuna United. Hanna Wijk fed Stine Larsen to put the visitors ahead just after the half-hour mark. Mia Jalkerud supplied the assist as Paulina Nyström levelled with just over an hour played to the joy of the gathered 1,031. With 20 minutes remaining, Marika Lundin settled matters with Häcken’s winner.\n\nIF Brommapojkarna gained a point to (temporarily?) climb out of the automatic relegation zone against Stockholm rivals Djurgården. They had to do it the hard way though, coming from behind as Stinalisa Johansson put the visitors ahead after 25 minutes. Klara Andrup levelled matters with a superb shot that whistled past legendary Djurgården goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl just over 10 minutes from time.\n\nKIF Örebro hammered another nail in AIK‘s miserable season after handing the Solna-based side a 5-1 thrashing, with even Australian international Remy Siemsen’s second goal in two games doing failing to ease the pain. Berglind Augustdottir hit Örebro’s opener on the half-hour mark. It remained a single-goal lead until a spell of two goals in five minutes either side of the hour mark effectively settled matters. Nathalie Persson fed Regan Steigleder to double the hosts’ lead with Katie Lockwood benefitting from Augustdottir’s assist. With 20 minutes left, Siemsen gave AIK a glimmer of hope, but this was snuffed out as Örebro added two further goals in the closing stages thanks to Heidi Kollanen’s penalty and Michaela Kovacs’ effort which was greatly appreciated by the crowd of 391. AIK, despite only recording two wins for the season, are still just three points from safety.\n\nLinköping are second, two points behind leaders Rosengård after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Vittsjö. The home side fielded three Matildas in their starting line-up. Clara Markstedt provided the assist for Jutta Rantala to give Vittsjö the lead to the delight of the 695 crowd. Shortly before the hour mark, Alva Selerud found Michelle De Jongh who levelled. Then, with six minutes remaining, Linköping sealed all three points with Olga Ahtinen on target.\n\nPiteå won the final game of the round at struggling Umeå IK. The only goal of the game came from Josephine Johansson five minutes before the break thanks to Anam Imo’s assist.\n\nRound 21 Fixtures (24th – 26th Sept): BK Häcken v IF Brommapojkarna, Kristianstads v Djurgården, Rosengård v Vittsjö, IFK Kalmar v Piteå, AIK v Eskilstuna United, Umeå IK v KIF Örebro, Hammarby v Linköping.\n\nElitettan News:\n\nThe weekend’s big game was the battle of the top two which saw IK Uppsala and Växjö go head to head in front of 306 fans. The outcome, a 2-0 win for Växjö, puts them four points clear at the top of the table and in pole position to claim an instant return to the Damallsvenskan. Fittingly, it was the recently announced Elitettan player of the month for August, Evelyn Ijeh, who hit both goals, after 19 and 62 minutes.\n\nThird-placed Alingsås FC United lost a major chance to cut the gap on the top two as they conceded a goal four minutes into second-half stoppage time in a 1-1 draw with an Ifö Bromölla IF side who are in the lower third of the table. Rebecca Cameras gave Alingsås the lead three minutes before the break. Then at the death, up popped Desirée Tiittanen to score a dramatic leveller for the visitors to the frustration of the 150 crowd.\n\nWhilst remaining in fourth, IFK Norrköping took advantage of Alingsås’ slip-up to close the gap after a 3-1 win at Sundsvalls in front of 74 fans. My Cato’s strike put the visitors ahead right on half-time. Ebere Orji brought Sundsvalls back into the game with a leveller eight minutes into the second half. IFK Norrköping then took charge as Wilma Leidhammer and Cato’s stoppage-time strike sealed the win.\n\nTeam TG FF gained a hugely important three points in their battle to beat the drop with a hugely dramatic 2-1 win at second-bottom Rävåsens IK Karlskoga. They had to do it the hard way with Christie Gray giving the home side the lead seven minutes into the second period. Rävåsens held the lead until two minutes from time when an own goal gave Team TG FF a lifeline. Then, five minutes into stoppage time up stepped Alexandra Sandstrom to score a winner for the visitors to plunge the home crowd of 126 into dispair. Team TG FF are consequently seven points clear of the drop zone.\n\nResults Round 20: Rävåsens IK Karlskoga 1-2 Team TG FF, Alingsås FC United 1-1 Ifö Bromölla IF, Lidköpings FK 4-0 Mallbackens IF Sunne, Älvsjö AIK FF 0-1 Gamla Upsala SK, Sundsvalls 1-3 IFK Norrköping, IK Uppsala 0-2 Växjö, Bergdalens IK 3-2 Jitex BK.\n\nRound 21 Fixtures (24th – 25th Sept): Gamla Upsala SK v Bergdalens IK, Jitex BK v IK Uppsala, Mallbackens IF Sunne v Alingsås FC United, Ifö Bromölla IF v Älvsjö AIK FF, Sundsvalls v Lidköpings FK, IFK Norrköping v Team TG FF, Växjö v Rävåsens IK Karlskoga.\n\nThe Swedish Scene\n\nBen Gilby rounds up all the action from both the Damallsvenskan and Elitettan and DandalBs provides his news round-up from around the leagues\n\nAbove: Vittsjö and their Australian internationals celebrate during their 3-0 win at Djurgården. Photo: Bildbyrån via Vittsjö.\n\nDamallsvenskan Round 19 Wrap:\n\nUmeå IK are suddenly looking over their shoulders near the bottom of the table after a 5-0 thumping at BK Häcken. Pauline Hammarlund contributed a hat-trick, the first of which came after 19 minutes after Hanna Wijk found her. Six minutes before the break, Hammarlund grabbed her second as Elin Rubensson provided the assist. Two goals in a four-minute spell early in the second half killed off any hopes that Umeå had as Hammarlund completed her hat-trick and Stine Larsen played in Anna Csiki to make it 4-0. Mille Jensen made it five in the closing stages, to the delight of the assembled crowd of 1,232.\n\nAIK‘s season of struggle continued as they went down to a 6-2 defeat at home to second place Kristianstads. Whilst the Solna-based side will have the positive of their Australian international striker Remy Siemsen scoring her first goal since moving to Sweden, it only came after they were well beaten. Kristianstads’ red-hot attacking force of Evelyn Viens and Tabby Tindell produced the visitors’ first three goals between them. Viens completed her hat-trick six minutes into the second half with Mia Carlsson making it 5-0 with only 56 minutes on the clock. AIK grabbed the first of two consolations with 20 minutes to go thanks to an own goal before Siemsen scored with two minutes remaining. However, Kristianstads had the final word at the death as Viens grabbed her fourth in front of a crowd of 432.\n\nHammarby‘s strong squad showed that they are most definitely in the race for Champions League qualification after they became only the second team all season to defeat defending champions and league leaders Rosengård. Played in front of an excellent crowd of 1,538, the Stockholm-based side took a grip of the game in the opening 24 minutes as two goals from Swedish international Madelen Janogy set them on the way. This was a match that saw four Australian internationals on the team sheets, with Elise Kellond-Knight (Hammarby) and Teagan Micah (Rosengård) starting and Kyra Cooney-Cross joining Courtney Nevin on the bench for the home side. Rosengård’s lead at the top of the Damallsvenskan is subsequently cut to three points. Hammarby are now just five points outside of the top three.\n\nIFK Kalmar are also looking nervously over their shoulders in the bottom third of the table after going down 4-0 at home to KIF Örebro. Three goals in a nine-minute spell after the half-hour mark settled matters in front of 360 fans. Regan Steigleder hit Örebro ahead with Michaela Kovacs doubling the advantage within six minutes. Emelia Pelgander made it three. Within two minutes of the second half opening, Berglind Augustdottir completed the rout.\n\nLinköping came from behind twice to defeat Eskilstuna United 5-2 at home. The visitors produced a game show which made light of their financial problems which has necessitated the trimming of their squad. Noor Eckhoff gave Eskilstuna the lead on 22 minutes – an advantage that lasted only four minutes before Amalie Vangsgaard grabbed the first of four goals to level. Eckhoff struck again to ensure the visitors led at the break. Therese Simonsen equalised before Vangsgaard scored three in 18 minutes to complete her tally for the game.\n\nPiteå‘s hopes of breaking into the top six foundered as they were held 0-0 at home to second-bottom IF Brommapojkarna in front of a crowd of 982. This was an excellent result for the visitors who are now within just two points of IFK Kalmar, who are in the lowest safe position in the table.\n\nVittsjö move up to sixth after a 3-0 win at Djurgården. Starting with all three of their Australian internationals – Clare Polkinghorne, Charli Grant, and Katrina Gorry – the visitors took a stranglehold on the match thanks to two goals from Jutta Rantala in a seven-minute spell with Gorry returning from Matildas international duty to score Vittsjö’s third in front of 442 fans.\n\nRound 20 Fixtures (16th – 19th Sept): Rosengård v IFK Kalmar, Kristianstads v Hammarby, Eskilstuna United v BK Häcken, IF Brommapojkarna v Djurgården, KIF Örebro v AIK, Umeå IK v Piteå, Vittsjö v Linköping.\n\nElitettan News:\n\nVäxjö are a point clear at the Elitettan summit after a comprehensive 6-0 win at home in the top verses bottom clash with Älvsjö AIK FF. Two goals on either side of the half-hour mark from Dessislava Dupuy put the hosts in control. Amanda Altheden made it three four minutes into the second period. Three more goals came in the final 15 minutes with Evelyn Ijeh, Mimmi Strömgren, and Sophia Redenstrand on target in front of 286 fans.\n\nIK Uppsala are second after a 2-1 win a Team TG FF Goals from Johanna Renmark and Nicole Robertson before the break set the visitors on their way. Emma Åström’s strike nine minutes into the second half gave the hosts hope, but they couldn’t fashion an equaliser to the frustration of the 84 fans gathered.\n\nAlingsås FC United are third, a further point behind, after a 5-0 win at home to Sundsvalls. Olivia Sultan and Lisa Johansson put the hosts ahead towards the end of the first half, with an own goal four minutes into the second stanza increasing the lead. Two goals in seven minutes in the final quarter of the encounter from Rebecca Cameras and Pernilla Milton completed the scoring in front of 150 fans.\n\nResults Round 19: Gamla Upsala SK 0-3 Jitex BK, Alingsås FC United 5-0 Sundavalls, Ifö Bromölla IF 1-3 Lidköpings FK, Mallbackens IF Sunne 3-0 Bergdalens IK, Team TG FF 1-2 IK Uppsala, Växjö 6-0 Älvsjö AIK FF, IFK Norrköping 4-1 Rävåsens IK Karlskoga.\n\nRound 20 Fixtures (17th – 19th Sept): Rävåsens IK Karlskoga v Team TG FF, Alingsås FC United v Ifö Bromölla IF, Lidköpings FK v Mallbackens IF Sunne, Älvsjö AIK FF v Gamla Upsala SK, Sundsvalls v IFK Norrköping, IK Uppsala v Växjö, Bergdalens IK v Jitex BK.\n\nNews Round-Up\n\nby DandalBs\n\nEskilstuna United‘s financial problems sees them continue to sell players.

Matilda Vinberg added the second shortly before the hour mark with Savage Hashish completing the scoring in stoppage time.\n\nThe battle of the bottom two ended in a 1-1 draw as AIK came from a goal down at IF Brommapojkarna. The hosts went ahead just after the break when Tempest-Marie Norlin found Frida Thörnqvist to score. The team from Solna earned a point thanks to Emma Engström.\n\nVittsjö – with three Australian internationals in their squad – Clare Polkinghorne and Katrina Gorry started, and Charli Grant came on from the bench with 10 minutes remaining – were held to a 1-1 draw by IFK Kalmar in front of 450 fans.

Speaking about her decision, the Australian international said: “I’m so excited to be signing for another year. I’ve really enjoyed the first half of the season and I can’t wait to see what we can achieve in the 2nd half. The club, the team, and Harper’s nannies have become our new family so it was an easy decision to stay. There is something special about Vittsjö and we are lucky to be a part of it.”\n\nSweden’s national team coach Peter Gerhardsson, whose contract expires after the 2023 World Cup, has been contacted by several clubs and national teams. Even though he is said to miss club coaching, no offers have been interesting enough to tempt him so far.\n\nKosovare Asllani, who recently left Real Madrid, is strongly rumoured to join AC Milan. When the same rumour surfaced last year, her agent denied it. This time he hasn’t commented.\n\nUgandan international Violah Nambi training with Damallsvenskan side IFK Kalmar. Nambi, who played for Växjö last year, comes from a successful half-season in Austria’s second division where she scored eight goals.\n\nDAMALLSVENSKAN\n\nby Ben Gilby\n\nRound 15 kicked off on Friday night with inform Hammarby hosting a BK Häcken side desperate to get back to winning ways after only taking four points from the last 15 available to them in front of a crowd of 1,464.\n\nThe home side could have taken the lead three minutes before the break, but Emma Jansson’s penalty was saved. Marika Bergman Lundin had an eventful opening to the second half for the visitors having come on at the break. Within seven minutes, she had been booked and then put her side ahead. Less than 60 seconds later, Andrine Hegerberg doubled BK Häcken’s lead.\n\nKyra Cooney-Cross made her long-awaited debut for the Stockholm-based side with 23 minutes remaining, joining her Matildas teammate Courtney Nevin, who has been in superb form in the Hammarby line-up. Matilda Vinberg got a goal back for the hosts six minutes into injury time at the end of the match.\n\nAIK‘s tough campaign got even more challenging when they were beaten 6-0 at home by leaders Rosengård in front of a crowd of 241. With Matildas stars Remy Siemsen and Teagan Micah starting for either side, and no place for Charli Grant in the visitors’ squad, Rosengård built a 2-0 lead at the break thanks to strikes from Sofie Bredgaard and Jelena Cankovic. Any hopes that the Solna-based hosts had of getting back into the game went up in smoke within three minutes of the re-start when Olivia Schough fed Cankovic to grab her second. Within eight minutes Schough made it 4-0 and added another just after the hour mark. Emma Berglund completed the rout a minute before the end. AIK remain bottom, but are within three points of safety. When the season resumes in August, matches against their fellow strugglers will decide their fate.\n\nIF Brommapojkarna are second-bottom after going down 3-1 at home to European chasing Eskilstuna United. Elise Stenevik provided the assist for Paulina Nyström to put the visitors ahead after 16 minutes.

Julia Walentowicz scored the winning goal nine minutes from time in front of 313 fans.\n\nVittsjö‘s European hopes suffered a setback after going down 2-1 at home to KIF Örebro in a game watched by 623 fans. Fielding both Clare Polkinghorne and Katrina Gorry, the hosts went ahead after 36 minutes through Linda Sällström. However, that was as good as it got for Vittsjö.

However, they had more difficulty imposing themselves on the scoreboard than many of the assembled crowd of 213 may have expected. Hanna Persson scored the only goal after 26 minutes. The win was further tempered for the home side by the news that Taryn Ries had to leave the game due to a foot injury\n\nIFK Norrköping lost the chance to remain second when they could only draw 1-1 at Jitex BK. Alexandra Hellekant gave the hosts the lead with just two minutes on the clock. My Cato earned the point with just over 15 minutes left.\n\nVäxjö took advantage of IFK Norrköping’s stumble to go second with their expected demolition of struggling visitors Bergdalens IK which delighted the crowd of 347. The hosts were ahead after just two minutes due to an own goal. Hanna Stokki made it 2-0 20 minutes later. The second half started with a bang as Evelyn Ijeh netted her customary goal before Mimmi Strömgren got in on the act just past the hour mark. Dessislava Dupuy hit a brace before Izabella Bergström hit a consolation for Bergdalens.\n\nAlingsås FC United are second, one point behind IK Uppsala after demolishing second-bottom Rävåsens IK Karlskoga 10-0 at home in front of a crowd of 190.

It remained level until the 59th minute when the visitors re-took the lead thanks to Jutta Rantala and a decisive 3-1 scoreline was earned when Linda Sällström fed Clara Markstedt to score. Marika Lundin gave BK Häcken hope within two minutes, but the visitors earned the points which put them up to fifth, just behind Häcken on goal difference.\n\nRosengård moved five points clear at the top, and are now 10 ahead of perennial title rivals BK Häcken after a 5-2 win at home to Umeå IK in front of 1,181 fans. Teagan Micah continued her form in goal, with Charli Grant not selected for this encounter. The defending champions were 2-0 up at the break after goals from Katrine Vejle and Olivia Schough. Two further strikes in four minutes at the start of the second half sealed the outcome as Sofia Bredgaard and Loreta Kullashi netted. An own goal six minutes from time further increased Rosengård’s advantage. Umeå rallied with two goals in the final three minutes thanks to Lisa Dahlqvist and Villemo Dahlqvist which will frustrate the hosts. However, it looks hard to see anyone stopping Rosengård from adding another Damallsvenskan title to the Svenska Cupen that they have already put in the cabinet this season.\n\nHammarby‘s sensational run continued with a fifth successive win as they comfortably saw off IFK Kalmar 4-0 in front of 983 ecstatic fans. In-form Courtney Nevin started, with Kyra Cooney-Cross listed on the bench, without coming on. Hammarby also has former Chelsea star Jonna Andersson to come into the team – so this exciting side will get even stronger after the break for the European Championships.\n\nNevin’s fine form continued as she supplied Emma Jansson for the opening goal after just two minutes. Adelina Engman doubled the Stockholm side’s advantage just ahead of the half-hour mark. Jansson made it three right on half-time from the penalty spot. Eva Nyström completed the scoring sixteen minutes from time. Hammarby are now up to sixth – five points outside the top three and have a massive game against out-of-form BK Häcken in their final game before the break.\n\nKristianstads are third after a 2-1 win on the road at IF Brommapojkarna – a fifth straight win. Canadian star Evelyn Viens continued her red-hot form with both goals. They came either side of Vaila Barsley’s goal for the hosts, a strike which came courtesy of an assist from Daniella Famili in front of 137 fans.\n\nLinköping remain Rosengård’s closest title rivals after a 2-1 win over bottom club AIK. Olga Ahtinen strike on the quarter-hour mark put the hosts ahead with Amalie Vansgaard doubling the advantage four minutes into the second half. Australian international Remy Siemsen provided hope for the Solna-based side when she supplied the assist for Linda Hallin. However, to the delight of the 542 fans, Linköping ran out 2-1 winners.\n\nEskilstuna United are sixth after a 2-0 win at home to KIF Örebro in front of 902 fans at Tunavallen. Ngozi Okobi-Okeoghene put them on the way to the three points with a goal after just six minutes. Noor Eckhoff’s free-kick decided matters five minutes before the break.\n\nPiteå returned to winning ways after a midweek loss to AIK when they saw off Djurgården 3-0 at their Lombia IP home. It was goalless at the break, but an own goal put the hosts ahead eight minutes into the second half, with Hlin Eiríksdóttir continuing her good goalscoring form by making it 2-0 with just over 20 minutes remaining. She grabbed her brace just three minutes to the delight of the crowd of 932.\n\nRound Fifteen Fixtures: Hammarby v BK Häcken, AIK v Rosengård, IF Brommapojkarna v Eskilstuna United, Kristianstads v Piteå, Linköping v Umeå IK, IFK Kalmar v Djurgården, Vittsjö v KIF Örebro.\n\nELITETTAN\n\nThere was huge drama in the Uppsala derby as league leaders IK Uppsala gained a sensational 5-4 win at Gamla Upsala on Friday night in front of a bumper crowd of 613. Mathilda Henriksson put the home side ahead with 17 minutes gone, but two goals in eight minutes turned the game on its head. Johanna Renmark and Taryn Ries put IK Uppsala ahead with the prolific Nicole Robertson making it 3-1 six minutes into stoppage time at the end of the first half.\n\nThe drama took hold early in the second period as an own goal brought Gamla back into the game at just 3-2 down. However, there was another twist involving two goals in quick succession – this time two in four minutes as Rosa Ossorio and Robertson pushed IK out to a 5-2 advantage. The crowd, royally entertained all night were treated to yet another rally of goals. Sanna Öhlund and Josefin Lindström brought Gamla Upsala back into the game at 5-4. There were still 20 minutes remaining on the clock at this stage, but IK Uppsala remained in front on the scoreboard by the odd goal in nine at the final whistle.\n\nVäxjö lost vital ground at the top after being held 1-1 away to Ifö Bromölla IF. The newly-promoted team are now in their best form of the season and looking to pull away from the lower reaches of the table. Hannah Stokki put the visitors ahead just before the half-hour mark, but Amanda Olsson delighted the majority of the 154 spectators by levelling 11 minutes later.\n\nAlingsås FC United continued their promotion push with a 1-0 win at Sundsvalls in front of 65 spectators . The only goal came from Alexandra Roholt with 20 minutes played.\n\nIFK Norrköping moved up to third with a comprehensive 5-0 win at Team TG FF.

It was a game full of action at the Linköping Arena.\n\nFresh from their Svenska Cupen Final success last week, Rosengård hit the front on the half-hour mark as Loretta Kullashi netted. However, the lead lasted just four minutes as Nellie Karlsson levelled for the hosts. Just before the break, the goal momentum shifted back to the defending champions as Kullashi grabbed hers and Rosengård’s second.\n\nThe key breakthrough came 20 minutes from time as Guðrún Arnardóttir headed home Jelena Čanković’s corner to put the visitors 3-1 ahead. Once more though, Linköping hit back almost immediately as Therese Simonsson gave the home side renewed hope. The pendulum swung back towards the visitors with 11 minutes remaining when Mimmi Larsson supplied the pass for Olivia Schough to re-establish her team’s two-goal lead. There was the potential for late drama when Linköping got back to 4-3 when the assistant referee ruled that the ball had just gone over the line off of Rosengård goalkeeper Teagan Micah, but the visitors had done enough to earn a vital win in the race to retain their title.\n\nThe round got underway on Wednesday night with Djurgården gaining an important 4-0 win over IFK Kalmar as they continued their positive run of form in front of 431 happy fans at Stockholm Stadium. The game was ultimately decided with three goals in an 11-minute spell in the early stages of the action.

Anna Csiki found Mille Gejl Jensen to put the visitors ahead just after the quarter of an hour mark before Jensen turned supplier for Pauline Hammerlund to make it 2-0. Jensen was back on the scoresheet with 36 minutes played after being played in by Stine Larsen. There was another flurry of goals in the final 12 minutes which started with Diljá Ýr Zomers extending Häcken’s lead to four. Mathilda Splendor got one back near the end for the home side before Molly Johansson restored Häcken’s four-goal advantage in second-half stoppage time.\n\nEskilstuna United and Vittsjö, two of the sides battling to make it into the top four faced off at Tunavallen on Sunday, with neither team being able to advance their cause for potential Champions League qualification after a 0-0 draw in front of 840 fans.\n\nPiteå came from 1-0 down to defeat Umeå IK 3-1 in the Norrland derby. It was a result which continues their fine recent form. Vilma Koivisto gave the visitors the lead on 12 minutes to the chagrin of the 721 home crowd. It was a lead that lasted for just under a quarter of an hour before Cecilia Edlund found Hanna Andersson to level. Katrina Guillo was next for the assist as she played in Anam Imo to give Piteå the lead. Imo completed the scoring with two minutes remaining as she converted a penalty.\n\nKristianstads are fourth after a 3-0 win at home to KIF Örebro in front of 549 fans.

Initially, there was no sign of that surprising outcome as Tove Lorén gave the hosts the lead with only two minutes played. Yet, Gamla replied just three minutes later as Thea Barkfeldt levelled. The winner was struck by Sanna Öhlund after 68 minutes.\n\nThat result meant that there is a log jam once more at the top of the Elitettan. The new leaders are IK Uppsala who, as expected ran out comfortable winners over bottom side Älvsjö AIK FF. Uppsala got a boost to their goal difference, which, at present is vital at the top of the table, with a 6-0 win success in front of 168 supporters.

First, Jenny Stadin levelled ahead of Ijeh grabbing hers and Växjö’s second. Ijeh completed her hat-trick with fifteen minutes to go. There was a tense finale as an own goal gave Lidköpings renewed hope, but Växjö got over the line and are second by just goal difference from IK Uppsala. Indeed there are just two points separating the top five.\n\nIfö Bromölla IF won a vital game at the bottom, 4-1 away to fellow newly-promoted side Rävåsens IK Karlskoga. There was drama in the opening period as Karlskoga’s Rebecka Mannström missed a penalty but then made amends seven minutes later by putting her team ahead. The second half was dominated by Bromölla who took the lead thanks to two strikes from Milla Larsson. Jindra van Reeden extended their lead to 3-1 before Vilma Hansson completed the scoring two minutes from time to the disappointment of the 108 fans.

Photo: FC Rosengård.\n\nSVENSKA CUPEN FINAL\n\nThe battle of the top two teams in Swedish women’s football went Rosengård‘s way as they defeated BK Häcken 2-1 at their Malmö Idrottsplats home on Thursday evening.\n\nHäcken came out of the blocks strongest with a high pressing and high-intensity game. They went in front after just seven minutes when Hanna Wijk’s long ball found Johanna Rytting Kaneryd who finished confidently. The key for this final was that, despite being so strong in the opening half-hour, Häcken could not add to their lead.\n\nThe second half saw the momentum switch towards Rosengård. Jelena Čanković got a stranglehold of the midfield. Eventually, the goal came as Bea Sprung’s shot went in off the crossbar. As the game ticked towards extra time, BK Häcken created a golden opportunity as Filippa Curmark was only denied by a sensational save by Rosengård’s Australian international goalkeeper Teagan Micah who pushed the ball onto the bar.\n\nThe outcome was eventually decided amidst huge controversy in extra time. A corner came in and Rosengård’s Stefanie Sanders nudged the ball goalwards which Häcken goalkeeper Jennifer Falk dived on. The assistant referee ruled that the ball had crossed the line. Despite protestations to the contrary from Häcken, the goal was given.\n\nSo, a 2-1 victory and it was Rosengård who ended the night lifting the trophy in front of 1,839 fans.\n\nDAMALLSVENSKAN\n\nRound 11 kicked off on Friday night as KIF Örebro hosted Eskilstuna United in the El Gnällico derby.

Amanda Rantanen held off Matilda Plan and found Emma Östlund whose shot came off an Eskilstuna player for an own goal after 35 minutes.\n\nBK Häcken‘s winless run stretched to a third straight Damallsvenskan game after they were held to a 0-0 draw at home to a Djurgården side who have only won four of their opening 11 fixtures. 516 fans watched on as Häcken’s recent form means that have taken just two points out of the last nine available and now sit third on the table, four points behind leaders Rosengård.\n\nVittsjö are fourth after a 3-0 win over IF Brommapojkarna. Matildas star Katrina Gorry was influential once more for her new team in this success in front of 717 fans. Elisabet Klinga played in Kayla Adamek to put the hosts ahead after 36 minutes. Sarah Stratigakis doubled the advantage just past the hour mark. Matters were settled when Gorry fed Linda Sällström to seal the victory.\n\nHammarby‘s improved form continued as they gained a 5-1 win at an IFK Kalmar side who are now just above the drop zone. Alyssa Walker gave the home side the lead with 26 minutes gone, but the second half was all about the visitors. Madelen Janogy was immense. The national team star smashed a hat-trick, with her second and third goals coming within 120 seconds of each other. If that wasn’t enough, she also provided an assist for Australian international Courtney Nevin with 53 minutes played. Ellen Gibson scored the other for the Stockholm-based side.\n\nAIK suffered another defeat as their tough start to the campaign continued, going down 4-0 at home to high-flying Linköping. The visitors took the lead just before the half-hour mark thanks to Therese Simonsson, who added a second ten minutes later. Four minutes into the second half Yuka Momiki made it 3-0. With 73 minutes played Alva Selerud completed the scoring. Life is not going to get any easier for the rock-bottom Solna-based side when they travel to nearby Hammarby this coming weekend – a team who are in form.\n\nKristianstads continued their good run of form which has seen them take 13 points out of the last 15, with a 2-0 win at Umeå IK. Mia Carlsson’s strike seven minutes before half-time was added to by Gabrielle Carle with 13 minutes remaining to seal the win in front of 1,950.\n\nThe final game of the round came on Monday night, and there was real drama at Malmö Idrottsplats where leaders Rosengård needed a goal in stoppage time at the end of the game to see off the challenge of Piteå in front of 558 fans. It should be no surprise that the visitors would prove tough opponents as, despite sitting ninth in the Damallsvensan with only four wins, they held BK Häcken to a draw last week. The home side went ahead just after the hour mark when Katrine Veje provided the assist for Loreta Kullashi. With ten minutes remaining, Piteå were level when Hlin Eiríksdóttir converted a penalty. Then came the late drama, and Stefanie Sanders netted the winner for the home side to scenes of huge joy. The win sees Rosengård go two points clear at the top of the table – but they face a huge game this coming weekend away to second-placed Linköping.\n\nROUND 12 FIXTURES: Djurgården v IFK Kalmar, Linköping v Rosengård, Eskilstuna United v Vittsjö, IF Brommapojkarna v BK Häcken, Kristianstads v KIF Örebro, Piteå v Umeå IK, Hammarby v AIK.\n\nELITETTAN\n\nThe top two sides faced off this weekend in front of the round’s highest crowd of 252.

The home side’s pair Evelyn Viens and Tabby Tindell took advantage of AIK’s troubles to contribute four of their team’s goals to the joy of the 567 spectators. Gabrielle Carle found Viens to put Kristianstads ahead with only six minutes played. Tindell doubled the home side’s lead just before the half-hour mark.

It was a disappointing afternoon for the majority of the 221 supporters in Platinum Cars Arena.\n\nLidköpings FK are third after a 4-2 win over battling Älvsjö AIK FF. The home side raced into a two goal lead in the opening half-hour. Ronja Karlsson Törnborg put Lidköpings ahead with 17 minutes on the clock with Emma Gabriel doubling the lead 13 minutes later.

Back came Älvsjö again, to their credit as Moa Sjöstrom struck with a quarter of an hour to go after being played in by Mia Olsson.

Häcken were comfortable 3-0 winners thanks to a hat-trick from Filippa Curmark. Her first goal came with 26 minutes played as she headed home. Curmark grabbed her second 11 minutes later when Johanna Rytting Kaneryd cut along the right and squared into the box for the ball to be swept home.\n\nThe pair combined again with 51 minutes played as Rytting Kaneryd supplied from the right and Curmark lifted the ball into the left hand of the net to complete the scoring.\n\nSiemsen is likely to be in a position to make her AIK debut next week when she faces a Rosengård side containing international teammates Teagan Micah and Charli Grant.\n\nDjurgården suffered a third straight defeat after going down 5-2 to defending champions Rosengård at Stockholm Stadium.\n\nDespite there being seven goals scored during the Good Friday afternoon clash, it took until three minutes before the break for the first to go in. Loretta Kullashi supplied the ball for Mia Persson to score. The game went significantly in Rosengård’s favour with two goals in sixty seconds just before the hour mark. Olivia Schough found Persson to grab her second with Stefanie Sanders playing in Kullashi to make it 3-0.\n\nWith just over fifteen minutes to go, Djurgården grabbed a lifeline as Tove Almqvist supplied a pass for Hayley Dowd to score. Yet the home fans’ hope lasted just four minutes as Persson and Kullashi combined again for the latter to grab the visitors’ fourth of the afternoon.\n\nThe remaining two goals came in stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes as completed her hat-trick for Rosengård. The final say went to the hosts as Tilde Lindwall played in Almqvist for Djurgården’s second. The Stockholm side has now conceded 11 goals in their opening three matches.\n\nUmeå IK won their first match since being promoted back to the Damallsvenskan with a 4-0 win at home to Vittsjö. However, it was not quite as straightforward as the scoreline suggests. Umeå had four shots on goal and scored each time. Vittsjö earned seven corners and more shots on goal, but it was the home side who came out well on top on the scoreboard. Despite only returning from international duty less than two days previously in Australia, Clare Polkinghorne started for the visitors\n\nTwo goals from Lisa Bjork at either end of the first half set the ball running for the hosts before Sarah Mellouk’s penalty just after the hour mark made matters comfortable. A fourth goal from Henna-Riikka Honkanen with 10 minutes to go completed the impressive win in front of 325 fans.\n\nLinköping continued their unbeaten start to the season with a 4-1 win at IFK Kalmar. They took the lead with 15 minutes played thanks to Cornelia Kopecs’ strike. However, in the early stages of the second period, the home side levelled from Juliette Kemppi’s goal.\n\nHowever, the game took an important twist just four minutes later as Linköping went ahead once more due to an own goal. Yuka Momiki’s penalty with 20 minutes remaining ultimately sealed the points with Amalie Vangsgaard adding a fourth in stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes.\n\nKIF Örebro continued their positive start to the campaign with a 2-1 win at newly-promoted IF Brommapojkarna.\n\nTwo goals in three minutes midway through the second half earned Örebro the points. Amanda Rantanen put the visitors ahead after being played in by Heidi Kollanen. Elli Pikkujämsä made it 2-0 shortly afterwards. Ida Bengtsson supplied a pass for Klara Andrup to get Bromma’s consolation at the death for the majority of the 126 crowd.\n\nNew signing Courtney Nevin inspired her new team Hammarby to their first win of the season as she made her debut at home to Piteå.\n\nThe only goal came with 13 minutes to go when Matilda Vinberg found Emilia Larsson to score. A best of the week crowd of 1,109 was present at Hammarby Idrottsparken.\n\nIn the final game of the round, Kristianstads played out a 2-2 draw at home to Eskilstuna United in front of 912 fans.\n\nThe visitors went ahead after 10 minutes when Ngozi Okobi-Okeoghene found Paulina Nystrom to score. Kristianstads finally levelled five minutes into the second period when Tabby Tindell continued her fantastic scoring run at the start of the season after being played in by Evelyn Viens.\n\nEskilstuna retook the lead 12 minutes before the end with Okobi-Okeoghene benefitting by the build-up play of Elise Stenevik to net. Their lead was short-lived as Klara Rybrink levelled four minutes later.\n\nROUND FOUR FIXTURES MIDWEEK: Rosengård v AIK, KIF Örebro v Umeå IK, Linköping v Hammarby, Piteå v IFK Kalmar, Vittsjö v Djurgården, Eskilstuna United v IF Brommapojkarna, BK Häcken v Kristianstads.\n\nELITETTAN:\n\nSELECTED MATCH DETAILS:\n\nVäxjö have continued their strong start to bid to seal an instant return to the Damallsvenskan with a 4-0 win at home to newly-promoted Team TG FF. Hanna Stokki gave the hosts a powerful opening with two goals in as many minutes as they built an early 2-0 lead. Elin Nilsson made it three just six minutes before the break. Stokki completed her hat-trick nine minutes before the end. Växjö have won both of their opening matches to the delight of the 319 crowd.\n\nRävåsens IK Karlskoga tough start to life in the Elitettan continued after an 8-0 home defeat to IFK Norrköping in a game brought forward from the Round Three schedule. The visitors raced to a 5-0 lead with just 25 minutes on the clock thanks to goals from Lovina Gustafsson (two), Sabina Ravnell, Minnie Asperot, and My Cato. Two further goals in nine second-half minutes from Taylor Townsend (one penalty) added to the tally before Townsend completed her hat-trick in the closing stages. Karlskoga have now conceded 15 goals in their opening two games after being promoted into the league at the end of last season. The home crowd of 125 will be hoping for better times ahead.\n\nIK Uppsala, who for much of last season looked to be definites for promotion to the Damallsvenskan are in the leading pack after two games. They gained a point from a trip to Lidköpings FK. Rosa Ossorio put Uppsala ahead just before the half-hour mark. Ronja Karlsson Törnborg levelled matters with three minutes remaining in front of 101 spectators.\n\nFull Results Round Two: Lidköpings FK 1-1 IK Uppsala, Växjö 4-0 Team TG FF, Ifö Bromölla IF 1-2 Gamla Upsala SK, Mallbackens IF Sunne 1-1 IFK Norrköping, Alingsås FC United 1-1 Jitex BK, Bergdalens IK 2-0 Älvsjö AIK FF,Sundsvalls 1-1 Rävåsens IK Karlskoga.\n\nRound Three Fixtures (Midweek): Rävåsens IK Karlskoga 0-8 IFK Norrköping, Gamla Upsala SK v Team TG FF, Ifö Bromölla IF v Mallbackens IF Sunne, Jitex BK v Lidköpings FK, Växjö v IK Uppsala, Älvsjö AIK FF v Sundsvalls, Alingsås FC United v Bergdalens IK.\n\nThe Swedish Scene\n\nBen Gilby rounds up all the key action from Round Two of the Damallsvenskan and the first week of matches in the Elitettan.

The shirt contains on it a printed guide with a full analysis of all the players’ strengths and game tactics.\n\nSecond in the world rankings, Sweden women’s new national team shirt celebrates the women’s progress, but is at the same time a hint to the other participating countries.\n\nTalking about the design of the shirt, Sweden striker Stina Blackstenius, who plays for Arsenal in the FAWSL said: “In the analysis on the shirt, we reveal exactly how we win, how we play and how the opposing teams – maybe – have a chance to beat us. Our team is better than ever, and we go into the European Championship with pep and confidence. This summer we hope that the whole Swedish people are behind us, it is a great time for our team.”\n\nTogether with the match shirt, the digital guide is also released on the website www.howtostopsweden.com. The guide, developed by the national team’s own match analyst, Anders Eriksson, highlights 31 national team players and tips on how the opposing teams should respond to them in order to have a chance to beat Sweden this summer.\n\n“The Swedish women’s national team has good opportunities to take home the entire championship. The digital analysis of the team and the individual players sends a pass to the opposing teams. Now they can order the national team shirt themselves to have a chance to challenge them in the European Championship!” said Eriksson.\n\nThis year’s national team shirt is sold in both women’s, men’s, and junior sizes and is available in adidas stores, on the Swedish Football Association’s website, and at selected retailers on April 7th.\n\nDAMALLSVENSKAN:\n\nRound Two kicked off on Friday night with two matches.

Five minutes before the end Hammarby got a consolation when Emilia Larsson provided a ball for Eva Nystrom to score.\n\nNewly promoted IFK Kalmar marked their first home game back in the Damallsvenskan with a solid 3-1 win over AIK in front of 373 fans.\n\nKalmar went ahead just before the 20 minute mark thanks to Allison Pantuso’s strike. With 32 minutes played, Juliette Kemppi doubled the home side’s lead. AIK hit back with 10 minutes left, Honoka Hayashi gave the visitors hope of a late comeback, yet within 60 seconds, those dreams were shattered as Kemppi struck again after being put in by Alyssa Walker.\n\nKristianstads went top of the table after a 2-2 draw at Piteå in front of 789 fans.
