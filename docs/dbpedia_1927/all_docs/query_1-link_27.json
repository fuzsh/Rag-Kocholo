        "text": "Musings - Nine lessons #CxOs can learn from Julian Nagelsmann and the perfomance of DFB Team at the UEFA #EuropeanChamptionships 2024 - I am sharing the first one - here - for more check out my blog post below: What did not work before, will likely not work now Since close to 15 years the German Bundestrainers have been infatuated with the concept of a false nine. That tactic was perfected at Barcelona and worked very well with Barcelona and to a point with the Spanish national team. What the German Bundestrainers kept and keep forgetting, is that they do not have a certain player called Lional Messi. So, what did not work under Yogi Löw, did not work under Hansi Flick and surprise, surprise did not work under Julian Nagelsmann. Playing Kay Havertz as the false 9 did not work. Nonetheless, Nagelsmann started with him 5 times, only to sub him out later in the game three times directly for Fuellkrug. The Enterprise Lesson: CxOs get hired to improve things and to show positive change. But not all needs to be changed and can be changed. Talent and skills are the limiting factor. Bottom Line: You are likely not going to fix it when your predecessor failed. Especially not with the same people talent. Focus on what can be changed.

Competing towards Slovakia and Luxemburg. 🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹 Some great facts about Portugals National Football team: 1. Defending Champions: Portugal won the UEFA European Championship in 2016. This victory showcased the strength and consistency of the Portuguese team in European competitions. 2. Impressive Qualification Record: Portugal has a strong track record in Euro qualifications. They have qualified for every European Championship since 2000, establishing themselves as one of the continent's most consistent and competitive teams. 3. Goal-Scoring Prowess: The Portuguese national team is known for its goal-scoring ability. Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world's greatest footballers, has been a key contributor to Portugal's success. He holds the record for the most goals scored in the European Championship history, further highlighting the team's offensive strength. These facts illustrate Portugal's formidable presence in European football and their ability to compete at the highest level in Euro qualification.\n\nFootball (known as soccer in some countries) is a sport that brings people together from all over the world. The UEFA European Championship 2024 is held every 4 years, and this year it’s being held from June 14th to July 14th.⚽️ Imagine you’re watching your team on TV. It’s finally time for your favourite team to come onto the pitch (the field). The players are wearing their team kit (football uniform), boots (special football shoes with grips on the bottom) and their shin pads (worn under socks to protect players’ legs from injury) under their knee-high socks.🚀 Let’s look at some key football vocabulary you’ll need to know to follow and talk about the matches like a pro.🏆 The goalkeeper: Their main job is to stop the ball from entering the goal. Defenders: These players help the goalkeeper stop the opposing team from scoring. Centre-backs: Positioned in the centre of the defence. Fullbacks: Positioned on the left and right sides of the defence. Midfielders: These players are the link between the defence and the attack. Wingers: These are midfielders who play near the sidelines. Strikers: The main goal scorers. The first half and second half: A football match is divided into two halves, each lasting 45 minutes. Half time: This is the break between the first and second halves, usually lasting 15 minutes. Extra time: If the match ends in a draw, two 15-minute periods are added to the match to decide the winner. A corner: The attacking team gets a chance to kick the ball from the corner of the field. A goal kick: This is when the goalkeeper kicks the ball to start play. A penalty shootout: If a knockout game is still tied (e.g. 0-0, 1-1) after extra time, a series of penalty kicks determines the winner. A yellow card is a warning, while a red card means the player must leave the pitch immediately. Out of play: This happens when the ball crosses the touchline (the side boundary) or goal line. Football is more than just a game; it’s a global language that connects people around the world.

I grew up as a fan of the England football squad. I’ve celebrated their highs and endured their lows. Every championship, I cling to the hope that this might be the one where they finally clinched the title, only to be met with the familiar sting of disbelief. The Finals against Spain was one of those times, echoing similar past failures in major tournaments. Euro'96 ended with a semi-final loss to Germany on penalties, and the 1998 World Cup featured another penalty defeat to Argentina even before the quarter finals. More recently, Euro 2020 concluded with frustration as England lost the final to Italy on penalties at Wembley, even though they had taken an early lead. Looking into the long history of the England squad, it’s clear that the team has consistently boasted top-tier players. Yet, they haven’t secured an international title since the 1966 World Cup. Reflecting on the recent loss to Spain, it was puzzling to see England retreat defensively. With midfield talents like Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham and top scorer Harry Kane, they had the ability to dominate possession. Southgate could have capitalised on Spanish midfielder Rodri's leaving the field due to injury by pushing the midfield higher and applying pressure, disrupting Spain's rhythm. England should have prioritised ball retention and adopted a 4-3-3 formation, opening spaces for midfielders to support the striker. Dynamic players like Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins, who previously generated attacking threats, might have made a difference if they stood in the line-up instead of being substitutes. Just like a coach aligns players' roles to their skills, I’ve realised that at work, understanding each team member's strengths and limitations is essential for success. A manager should assign tasks that play to individual strengths. For instance, a creative employee can thrive when supported by colleagues adept at execution, similar to a striker flourishing with skilled midfielders. Maybe what would have worked for the England team is if Southgate had gone through some management courses first. Back to the football field, looking ahead to World Cup 2026, the upcoming coach must foster unity and fluidity in the team’s play. Emphasising versatile tactics and creative freedom can unlock players' full potential. Constructing a cohesive unit adaptable to various field situations will also be essential. Despite setbacks, my love for the Three Lions remains unwavering. Amid challenges, I remain optimistic that England will rise, with passion and talent, to make football “come home” again.

Not cricket, but in the sport of Rugby Union. It's a sport I actively pay attention to only during its World Cup*. It's been my theory that any World Cup-equivalent tournament of a team sport is worth watching: featuring the best combination of players, outcomes, and importantly for laymen, good commentators & explainers. I happened to watch the 2003 Rugby World Cup final, considered perhaps the best of the lot in recent years, and was hooked since then. There's a quip that best describes the difference between rugby and regular football: “Cricket is a game for gentlemen played by gentlemen, football is a game for hooligans (/or gentlemen, depending on which version of this quip you read/) played by hooligans, and rugby is a game for hooligans played by gentlemen.” I've rarely seen bad behaviour on the field in World Cup matches; the referee is in control and the giants around him meekly obey his directions. The ref is miked up, and you can hear him clearly during the match; it adds to the experience. Like in cricket, the plethora of rugger-specific terms adds to the charm of following it (and trying to make sense of scrums, line-outs, mauls, and rucks.) \"Scrum\": a rare import from that sport into professional culture. Though, given what dull affairs scrum meetings usually are, it's a puny use of a majestic sporting term. If you are in India, give the Rugby World Cup a go. The tournament is soon to get into the knock-out stages, where things should get even more exciting. This edition might throw up a new champion. So you could be watching history being made, while learning new things in the unique way delving into a sport can teach you.🏆 -- *I also keep an eye out for the annual Six Nations tournament results. It was a trip to Ireland, a proud Rugby nation, in 2003 that got me started on all these tournaments. Image: Wikimedia Commons"
