        "text": "Dani Parejo's 110th-minute goal sealed a 4-3 victory for Villarreal over Celta Vigo, snatching a late win on Monday.\n\nCelta had come from behind to level the score with 10 minutes of normal time remaining and looked to be heading home with a point until late drama flipped the script.\n\nThe visitors actually took the lead in the 12th minute with Borja Iglesias breaking the deadlock after Alfon Gonzalez's effort was cleared off the line.\n\nSergi Cardona levelled the score from close range, but Celta were soon back in front as Oscar Mingueza's long-range strike deflected in off the post.\n\nYerry Pino hit the woodwork on the stroke of half-time, but Villarreal turned things around in a four-minute period in the second half thanks to Thierno Barry and an own goal from Jailson.\n\nCarl Starfelt got Celta back on level terms again 80 minutes in before Tasos Douvikas was denied a winner when he hit the frame of Diego Conde's goal.\n\nHugo Alvarez's late challenge in the box then gave the hosts an opportunity to win it from the spot. Parejo saw his penalty saved well by Ivan Villar, but the goalkeeper could only push it back into the midfielder, who made no mistake on the second attempt.\n\nData Debrief: Leaving it late\n\nIt was a game of football that would delight any neutral, with both teams throwing caution to the wind with an all-out attacking approach.\n\nVillarreal had 24 shots, creating 3.64 expected goals, compared to Celta's 20 (2.74 xG), with both teams registering nine efforts on target each.\n\nIt is the first time that Villarreal have won a LaLiga home game despite conceding three goals for the first time since January 2008 (4-3 v Deportivo La Coruna).\n\nTributes from across the football world have flooded in after the news that Sven-Goran Eriksson has died, aged 76, on Monday.\n\nEriksson, who was England's first foreign manager, revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer.\n\nHis former clubs, England and UEFA, have expressed their condolences, along with countless players and managers as they honoured the Swede's life and career.\n\nDavid Beckham was named Three Lions captain in 2001 by Eriksson, captaining the side 57 times under the Swede.\n\n\"We laughed, we cried, and we knew we were saying goodbye,\" Beckham said.\n\n\"Sven, thank you for always being the person you have always been - passionate, caring, calm and a true gentleman.\n\n\"I will be forever grateful for you making me your captain, but I will forever hold these last memories of this day with you and your family... Thank you, Sven, and in your last words to me 'It will be ok'.\"\n\nWayne Rooney was handed his England debut by Eriksson as a 17-year-old and described him as a \"special man\".\n\n\"Rest in peace, Sven,\" he said on X.\n\n\"Thanks for the memories and all your help and advice. Thoughts and prayers with all his family and friends.\"\n\nEriksson led England to three major quarter-finals in his five-year spell as manager, at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and Euro 2004.\n\nHe oversaw 67 games in charge of the Three Lions, with only Walter Winterbottom (139), Alf Ramsey (113), Gareth Southgate (102) and Bobby Robson (95) leading the team on more occasions.\n\nThe national side published a tribute to their former manager, saying: \"We are deeply saddened that Sven-Goran Eriksson, who managed the Three Lions from 2001 to 2006, has passed away aged 76.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time. Rest in peace, Sven. You will be greatly missed.\"\n\nEriksson managed 12 clubs, winning 18 trophies across his career, with Swedish side Gothenburg the first top-flight club he managed.\n\nHe won four trophies during his three-year stay between 1979 and 1982, including the UEFA Cup.\n\n\"We are so grateful for his deed, the one he did in IFK Gothenburg and for Swedish football,\" the club said in a statement.\n\n\"We are also happy that we were able to thank him this spring, both with a match in his honour and by naming one of our stands at Gamla Ullevi after him.\"\n\nHe also had spells in charge of Benfica, Lazio, Manchester City and Leicester City. The clubs sent their condolences, with Lazio holding a minute's silence for their former manager at training.\n\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who played under Eriksson at Notts County, Man City and Leicester, posted a heartfelt tribute.\n\n\"It feels very strange to have to write this, and I feel like I've had to write too many of these over the years. It was only yesterday evening that I sat and watched the documentary about his life. And what a life! We have lost an incredible man to whom I owe a great deal,\" he said.\n\n\"Sven was the first manager to truly believe in me and give me a chance at the highest level. He was the first manager to call me world-class, and he made me feel 10 feet tall.\n\n\"He gave me my Premier League debut, brought me to Notts County, and finally to Leicester, where I enjoyed the best time of my career. It is a great loss to football and the world. I want to thank him for everything he did for me.\"\n\nBradley Barcola's first brace of his career helped Paris Saint-Germain maintain their winning start to the season as they thrashed Montpellier 6-0 on Friday.\n\nBarcola opened the scoring in the fourth minute of the contest, with Marco Asensio doubling their advantage before the break.\n\nThe 21-year-old continued the scoring eight minutes after the break, as Achraf Hakimi, Warren Zaire-Emery and Lee Kang-in completed a dominant display.\n\nIt took four minutes for the first goal of the encounter as Barcola produced a fine finish, with Asensio adding their second after being picked out by Joao Neves.\n\nDespite momentarily halting the onslaught, Barcola increased PSG's advantage shortly after the break with a simple finish from Ousmane Demebele's pass.\n\nHakimi netted the hosts' fourth with another fine finish, as Zaire-Emery got himself in on the act to strike beyond Benjamin Lecomte after a brilliant piece of skill.\n\nSubstitute Kang-in sealed the scoring eight minutes from time, sneaking a left-footed effort from the edge of the area in at Lecomte's near post.\n\nData Debrief: Barcola stars for Parisians\n\nPSG have now scored 10 goals in their last two league games, as life without Kylian Mbappe has got off to a flying start under Luis Enrique.\n\nBarcola showcased his undeniable talent during the contest, contributing 1.17 expected goals (xG) to PSG's 3.93 total - the highest of any player for the hosts.\n\nThe winger has eight goal involvements (five goals, three assists) in his last seven top-flight appearances for PSG, two more than in his first 20 for the club."
