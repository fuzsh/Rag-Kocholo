        "text": "A club with over 4,000 players of which 1,000 are female. Bromma are creating change and influencing a generation through the power of football, with a huge emphasis on diversity. Marking 2019 with a re-brand that sees the release of special edition jersey that represents far more than just a uniform, the event saw the launch of a project which rebranded from IF Brommapojkarna (which translates as 'Bromma Boys’) to the new name of 'BrommaGirls’.\n\nFor years the club had female teams in their set up who have had to play under the boys name, and this move in partnership with Nike is a positive stride in terms of inclusion, diversity and progression of women’s football. BrommaGirls invited local musicians as well as the men's squad to the launch party which saw the women's team play in the kit for the first time. The game drew in a crowd of 2206, smashing the previous record attendance of 547 to pieces.\n\nThe artists performing were Janice and Imenella. Strong female voices that cater to young girls in Sweden. And further solidarity has shown by male players supporting the cause including Viktor Gyökeres of Brighton & Hove Albion, Jack Lahne, Ludwig Augustinsson & Felix Beijmo."
