It was founded in 1924 and is the top tier of the Swedish football league system, operating on a system of promotion and relegation with Superettan. Seasons run from late March or early April to the beginning of November, with the 16 clubs all meeting each other twice, resulting in a 30-match season, for a total of 240 matches league-wide.\n\nAllsvenskan is ranked 23rd in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the last five years. Allsvenskan is currently ranked third highest of the leagues in Scandinavia after Norway and Denmark. The current champions are Malmö FF, who won the title in the 2023 season.\n\nThe three teams with most Swedish championships are Malmö FF (23), IFK Göteborg (18) and IFK Norrköping (13).\n\nIncluding the 2023 season, Allsvenskan has been running for an unbroken streak of 99 seasons . Unlike other European football leagues, the Allsvenskan did not experience an interruption in play during World War II due to Swedish neutrality.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAllsvenskan started in the 1924–25 Allsvenskan season and the first winner was GAIS. The one-league twelve team Allsvenskan replaced the Svenska Serien, consisting of a southern and northern group that was held before. In 1931, the league started to decide the Swedish football champions.\n\nIn the early years, Norrland and Gotland teams were not allowed to play on higher levels in the league system, which was gradually changed to include the Norrland and Gotland teams on higher levels.\n\nFor the 1959 Allsvenskan, the season start was changed from autumn to spring to be played in one calendar year. In 1973, it was expanded to contain 14 teams. In the 1970s, Malmö FF, under the lead of Spanish Antonio Durán and later English Bob Houghton, won five Allsvenskan and managed to proceed to the 1979 European Cup Final, which they lost to Nottingham Forest.\n\nFrom the 1982 season, the league introduced a play-off to determine the Swedish football champions. In the late 1980s, Malmö FF were dominant, winning the league five times in a row, but only two Swedish championships. The 1990 season saw the introduction of three points per win. The play-off season years were followed by two years of continuation league, named Mästerskapsserien.\n\nThe 1993 season saw a return to the classical format, again with 14 teams. IFK Göteborg won five Allsvenskan league titles in the 1990s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Djurgårdens IF won three titles (2002, 2003 and 2005). In 2004, Örebro SK lost its place in the league due to financial problems, and Assyriska FF got their place. Since 2008, the league consists of 16 teams.\n\nStatus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe champions are considered Swedish champions and gold medal winners. The runners-up are awarded the Large Silver medal, the third positioned team are awarded the Small Silver medal and the team positioned in fourth place are awarded the Bronze medal.\n\nThere have been seasons with exceptions when the winners of Allsvenskan wasn't considered Swedish champions as well. Allsvenskan winners between 1924 and 1930 were crowned league champions and awarded gold medals, the title of Swedish champions was awarded to the winner of Svenska Mästerskapet up until 1925 and then not at all until 1930. The years 1982 through 1990 are also exceptions, the title was instead decided through play-offs during these years. The same was true for the years 1991 and 1992 when the title was decided through a continuation league called Mästerskapsserien. Historically, however, there is a big difference between the Allsvenskan winners before 1931 compared to the period between 1982 and 1992. As winning Allsvenskan in its earlier seasons was the optimal aim for the clubs, while as during the era of play-offs and Mästerskapsserien, the optimal goal wasn't to win Allsvenskan, but the play-offs or Mästerskapsserien.\n\nCompetition format\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 2008 there are 16 clubs in Allsvenskan. During the course of a season (starting in late March and ending in early November) each club plays the others twice (home and away) for a total of 30 games. The two lowest placed teams at the end of the season are relegated to Superettan and the top two teams from Superettan are promoted in their place. The third lowest team in Allsvenskan plays a relegation/promotion play-off against the third placed team in Superettan.\n\nThe winners of Allsvenskan qualify for the UEFA Champions League, the runner-up together with the third placed team in the table qualify for the UEFA Europa League as well as the team who wins the Svenska Cupen. In case the winner of the Cup has already qualified to Champions League or Europa League, the third Europa League spot is given to the team that finishes fourth in Allsvenskan.\n\nChanges in competition format\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom To Teams Match-weeks Season Start Season End Play-offs 1924–25 1956–57 12 22 Autumn Spring — 1957–58 33 Next autumn — 1959 1972 22 Spring Autumn — 1973 1981 14 26 — 1982 1983 12 22 Play-offs with eight teams 1984 1990 Play-offs with four teams 1991 1992 10 18 Summer League with six teams 1993 2007 14 26 Autumn — 2008 Present 16 30 —\n\nThe decider at equal number of points was goal ratio until the 1940–41 season, thereafter goal difference.\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nTrophy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current trophy awarded to the Swedish champions is the Lennart Johanssons Pokal. Created in 2001, the trophy is named after former UEFA chairman, Lennart Johansson. A different trophy that was named after Clarence von Rosen, the first chairman of the Swedish Football Association, had previously been used between 1903 and 2000, but was replaced after journalists reported that von Rosen had personal connections to the later infamous Nazi leader Hermann Göring during the time he lived in Sweden (soon after World War One).[1] The former President of the Swedish Football Association, Lars-Åke Lagrell stated that the reason for the change of trophy was not a personal attack against Von Rosen but rather that the Football Association did not want to be linked to Nazism and constantly engage in discussions regarding this every time the trophy was awarded.[1]\n\nPlayer and manager awards\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players, Allsvenskan also awards the most valuable player, goalkeeper of the year, defender of the year, midfielder of the year, forward of the year, newcomer of the year and manager of year at Allsvenskans stora pris together with C More and Magasinet Offside.[2] Also, the Allsvenskan top scorer is awarded.\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nSweden\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Swiss corporation Kentaro has owned the TV rights for Allsvenskan since 2006.[3] Through licence agreements with the media company TV4 Group matches are aired through C More Entertainment who broadcasts them on their C More Sport and C More Live channels, until 2019. Matches can also be bought through the online pay-per-view service C SPORTS.[4]\n\nOn 24 March 2017, Discovery-owned channel Eurosport and OTT streaming service dPlay will be the new domestic broadcaster for both SEF competitions (Allsvenskan and Superettan) effectively from 2020 until 2025, as well as selected European countries (exc. Italy) for Allsvenskan.[5] In May 2024 Discovery+ was rebranded as Max which is the service that currently broadcasts Allsvenskan.[6]\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nBeginning in 2018, Allsvenskan matches were previously broadcast in the UK on Premier Sports and FreeSports.[7] In October 2018, ESPN picked up the rights to broadcast one Allsvenskan match per week in the United States.[8] Allsvenskan matches have also been broadcast in several countries, such as DAZN in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, Sport Klub in Balkan countries,[9] Nova sports in Cyprus and Greece, TV2 in Norway[10] and 4th Sports in Iraq[11]\n\nCurrent broadcast rights\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Broadcaster Sweden Max Bosnia and Herzegovina Sport Klub Croatia Montenegro North Macedonia Serbia Slovenia Finland Eurosport France Greece Romania Spain Hong Kong TVB Iceland NENT Iraq 4th Sports Italy Sportitalia United Kingdom LiveScore\n\nClubs\n\n[edit]\n\nA total of 67 clubs have played in Allsvenskan from its inception in 1924 up to and including the 2023 season. No club has been a member of the league for every season since its inception. AIK is the club that has participated in the most seasons, with a record of 96 out of 100 seasons in total. Malmö FF has the record for most consecutive seasons: 63 between 1936–37 and 1999. IFK Göteborg is currently the club with the longest running streak, starting their 48th season in 2024.\n\nThe following 16 clubs are competing in Allsvenskan during the 2024 season:\n\nClub\n\nPosition\n\nin 2023 First season Number of seasons First season of\n\ncurrent spell Titles Last title AIK 11th 1924–25 96 2006 6 2018 BK Häcken 3rd 1983 24 2009 1 2022 Djurgårdens IF 4th 1927–28 69 2001 8 2019 GAIS 2nd in Superettan 1924–25 55 2024 4 1953–54 Halmstads BK 12th 1933 57 2023 4 2000 Hammarby IF 7th 1924–25 56 2015 1 2001 IF Brommapojkarna 14th 2007 8 2023 0 — IF Elfsborg 2nd 1926–27 81 1997 6 2012 IFK Göteborg 13th 1924–25 92 1977 13 2007 IFK Norrköping 9th 1924–25 84 2011 13 2015 IFK Värnamo 5th 2022 3 2022 0 — IK Sirius 8th 1969 11 2017 0 — Kalmar FF 6th 1949–50 37 2004 1 2008 Malmö FF 1st 1931–32 89 2001 26 2023 Mjällby AIF 10th 1980 13 2020 0 — Västerås SK 1st in Superettan 1955–56 5 2024 0 —\n\nStadiums and locations\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Allsvenskan stadiums\n\nTeam Location Stadium Turf Stadium capacity AIK Solna Strawberry Arena Natural 50,000 BK Häcken Gothenburg Bravida Arena Artificial 6,316 Djurgårdens IF Stockholm Tele2 Arena Artificial 30,000 GAIS Gothenburg Gamla Ullevi Natural 18,454 Halmstads BK Halmstad Örjans Vall Natural 10,873 Hammarby IF Stockholm Tele2 Arena Artificial 30,000 IF Brommapojkarna Stockholm Grimsta IP Artificial 5,000 IF Elfsborg Borås Borås Arena Artificial 16,200 IFK Göteborg Gothenburg Gamla Ullevi Natural 18,454 IFK Norrköping Norrköping Nya Parken[note 1] Artificial 16,000 IFK Värnamo Värnamo Finnvedsvallen Natural 5,000 IK Sirius Uppsala Studenternas IP Artificial 10,522 Kalmar FF Kalmar Guldfågeln Arena Natural 12,182 Malmö FF Malmö Stadion[note 2] Natural 22,500 Mjällby AIF Hällevik Strandvallen Natural 7,500 Västerås SK Västerås Hitachi Energy Arena Artificial 7,044\n\nManagers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current managers in Allsvenskan are:\n\nName Club Appointed AIK 16 July 2024 BK Häcken 27 December 2023 Djurgårdens IF 16 November 2018 GAIS 9 November 2021 Halmstads BK 7 May 2019 Hammarby IF 14 December 2023 IF Brommapojkarna 5 December 2022 IF Elfsborg 3 June 2024 IFK Göteborg 25 June 2024 IFK Norrköping 29 December 2023 IFK Värnamo 17 November 2023 IK Sirius 5 December 2022\n\n(caretaker) Kalmar FF 20 June 2024 Malmö FF 17 November 2022 Mjällby AIF 14 November 2022 Västerås SK 2 August 2021\n\nPlayers\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Allsvenskan players\n\nRank Player Apps Goals 1 Sven Andersson 431 0 Andreas Johansson 431 20 3 Thomas Ravelli 416 0 4 Daniel Tjernström 411 24 5 Sven Jonasson 410 254\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nSven Andersson and Andreas Johansson shares the record for most appearances in Allsvenskan with 431 appearances for Örgryte IS and Helsingborgs IF for Andersson and Halmstads BK and IFK Norrköping for Johansson.

In 1978, Icelandic Teitur Þórðarson in Östers IF became the first foreign player to win the Allsvenskan[13]\n\nRank Player Apps Goals 1 Sven Jonasson 410 254 2 Carl-Erik Holmberg 260 194 3 Filip Johansson 181 180 4 Harry Lundahl 176 179 5 Harry Bild 288 162 Bertil Johansson 267 162\n\nTop scorers\n\n[edit]\n\nSven Jonasson has scored the most goals in Allsvenskan history, with 254 goals in 410 appearances.

The champions are awarded the gold medal while the runners-up receive the \"big silver\" medal. The third place team gets the \"small silver\" medal instead of the more commonly used bronze medal which is instead awarded to the fourth-place finisher. This tradition of awarding four medals and not three is thought to have to do with the fact that the losers of the Semi-finals of Svenska Mästerskapet were both given bronze medals since no bronze match was played.[14]\n\nThe overall medal rank is displayed below after points in descending order. 5 points are awarded for a \"gold\" medal, 3 points for a \"big silver\" medal, 2 points for a \"small silver\" medal and 1 point for a bronze medal. The table that follows is accurate as of the end of the 2023 season.[14][15][16]\n\nRank Club Gold Big Silver Small Silver Bronze Points 1 Malmö FF 26 15 10 8 203 2 IFK Göteborg 13 13 16 10 146 3 IFK Norrköping 13 10 5 8 113 4 AIK 6 15 12 8 107 5 Helsingborgs IF 7 8 8 10 85 6 Djurgårdens IF 8 4 11 5 79 7 IF Elfsborg 6 8 6 9 75 8 GAIS 4 4 4 4 44 9 Östers IF 4 3 3 3 38 10 Örgryte IS 2 2 6 6 34 11 Halmstads BK 4 2 2 2 32 12 Hammarby IF 1 2 4 3 22 13 Kalmar FF 1 2 2 4 19 14 Åtvidabergs FF 2 2 - 1 17 15 Örebro SK - 2 2 4 14 16 BK Häcken 1 1 2 1 13 17 Degerfors IF - 2 2 2 12 18 IK Sleipner 1 1 1 1 11 19 Landskrona BoIS - - 1 3 5 Sandvikens IF - - 1 3 5 21 IFK Malmö - 1 - - 3 Jönköpings Södra IF - 1 - - 3 Råå IF - 1 - - 3 24 Trelleborgs FF - - 1 1 3 25 IK Brage - - - 3 3\n\nHonoured clubs\n\n[edit]\n\nClubs in European football are commonly honoured for winning multiple league titles and a representative golden star is sometimes placed above the club badge to indicate the club having won 10 league titles. In Sweden the star instead symbolizes 10 Swedish championship titles for the majority of the clubs as the league winner has not always been awarded the title of Swedish champions.[a] Stars for Allsvenskan clubs was not common practise until 2006, although AIK had already introduced a star to their kit in 2000. IFK Göteborg, Malmö FF, IFK Norrköping, Örgryte IS and Djurgårdens IF were the first teams after AIK to introduce their stars. No new club has introduced a star since 2006, the clubs closest to their first are IF Elfsborg with 6 Swedish championship titles and Helsingborgs IF with 7 Allsvenskan titles depending on what the star symbolizes. The following table is ordered after number of stars followed by number of Swedish championship titles and then the number of Allsvenskan titles.\n\nStatistics updated as of the end of the 2021 season\n\nClub Swedish championship titles Allsvenskan titles Stars Introduced Malmö FF 23 26 2006 IFK Göteborg 18 13 2006 IFK Norrköping 13 13 2006 AIK 12 6 2000 Djurgårdens IF 12 8 2006 Örgryte IS 12 2 2006\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nTown or city League wins Clubs Malmö\n\n26\n\nMalmö FF (26) Gothenburg\n\n20\n\nIFK Göteborg (13), GAIS (4), Örgryte IS (2), BK Häcken (1) Stockholm\n\n15\n\nDjurgårdens IF (8), AIK (6), Hammarby IF (1) Norrköping\n\n14\n\nIFK Norrköping (13), IK Sleipner (1) Helsingborg\n\n7\n\nHelsingborgs IF (7) Borås\n\n6\n\nIF Elfsborg (6) Halmstad\n\n4\n\nHalmstads BK (4) Växjö\n\n4\n\nÖsters IF (4) Åtvidaberg\n\n2\n\nÅtvidabergs FF (2) Kalmar\n\n1\n\nKalmar FF (1)\n\nAll-time Allsvenskan table\n\n[edit]\n\nThe all-time Allsvenskan table, \"maratontabellen\" in Swedish, is a cumulative record of all match results, points, and goals of every team that has played in Allsvenskan since its inception in 1924–25. It uses three points for a win even though this system was not introduced until the 1990 season. The matches played in the championship play-offs between 1982 and 1990 or the matches played in Mästerskapsserien in 1991 and 1992 are not included. The table that follows is accurate as of the end of the 2023 season.[18]\n\nMalmö FF are the current leaders, having had the lead since the end of the 2012 season when they overtook the lead from IFK Göteborg. IFK Göteborg are the club to have spent most seasons in the top spot with 48 seasons as leaders with a record of the most consecutive seasons as leaders with 35 seasons between 1938 and 1972. Six clubs have been in the lead, the lead having changed among them ten times since 1925. The former leader with the lowest current ranking in the table is GAIS, currently placing 12th and 2120 points short of Malmö FF.\n\nA total of 67 clubs have played at least one season at Allsvenskan up to and including 2023 season.\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nUEFA coefficients\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: UEFA coefficient\n\nThe following data indicates Swedish coefficient rankings between European football leagues.[19]\n\nAttendance\n\n[edit]\n\nLast five seasons average attendance Year Spectators per match 2016\n\n9,127\n\n2017\n\n9,215\n\n2018\n\n8,423\n\n2019\n\n9,166\n\n2020\n\nN/A\n\n2021\n\nN/A\n\n2022\n\n9,958\n\nThe record for highest average home attendance for a club was set by Hammarby in 2022 (26,372 over 15 home matches). Most other attendance records for Allsvenskan were set in the 1959 season, coinciding with the first season that the league switched from an autumn–spring format to a spring–autumn format. 1959 saw records for highest attendance at a match (52,194 at an Örgryte win over IFK Göteborg at Ullevi), second highest average home attendance for a club (25,490 for Örgryte's 11 home matches), and the highest ever average attendance for Allsvenskan as a whole (13,369).\n\nIn the past, AIK had the league's highest attendance for the season more often than any other club, followed by IFK Göteborg and Örgryte. However, for the past two decades, Hammarby has dominated the attendance figures helped by a move to the larger Tele2 Arena from the much smaller Söderstadion. Other teams that have for at least one season had the best attendance in the league include Helsingborg, Malmö FF, Djurgården, GAIS, Örebro SK and Öster.\n\nReferees\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2014 season Allsvenskan has 12 referees that are categorized as Allsvenskan referees, seven of which are fully certified international FIFA referees.[22][23] Apart from these, female FIFA referee Tess Olofsson also occationally officiates games in Allsvenskan as the only woman to ever having done so.\n\nList\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: FIFA referees are in bold\n\nAllsvenskan in international competition\n\n[edit]\n\nMalmö FF were runners up in the 1978–79 European Cup, after a 1–0 defeat against Nottingham Forest.[24] IFK Göteborg won the UEFA Cup twice, in 1981–82 (defeating Hamburger SV in the finals)[25] and 1986–87 (defeating Dundee United in the finals).[26] IFK Göteborg also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1985–86.
