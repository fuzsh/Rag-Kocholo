        "text": "It’s been another busy week in Swedish women’s football with Champions League action and the first post Olympics Damallsvenskan match. If that wasn’t enough, there’s some major transfer news.\n\nAbove: Alice Nilsson celebrates after scoring for Kristianstad against Brøndby in the Champions League in midweek. Photo: SVT\n\nDAMALLSVENSKAN:\n\nKristianstad beat Brøndby 1-0 in their UEFA Women’s Champions League tie. All in all it was a reasonable result between Denmark’s number two and Sweden’s number three. Alice Nilsson, 25, scored for Kristianstad.\n\nAIK played an early match ahead of schedule in the Damallsvenskan on Saturday when they finally ended their four game losing streak by holding Kristianstads to a 1-1 front of a crowd of 237 in Solna. Ruusul Kafaji gave the home side the lead on 37 minutes with Amanda Edgren levelling for Kristianstads six minutes later.\n\nSeveral friendly matches between Damallsvenskan sides took place last weekend ahead of this week’s return to league action. Rosengård gained a 2-1 win over Linköping with two goals from Mimi Larsson. Cornelia Kapocs replied for Linköping.\n\nHammarby were held to a 3-3 draw by Vittsjö. Matilda Vinberg, Nina Jakobsson, and Emlia Larsson were on target for the Stockholm based side with Mie Leth Jans, Julia Tunturi, and Ebba Wieder scoring for Vittsjö.\n\nKIF Örebro played out a 1-1 draw with Djurgården with Moa Öhman and Linda Motlhalo scoring for the respective sides.\n\nPiteå had a warm-up game against a team consisting of 16 year-old boys from local club Storfors. A 12-1 win which saw goals come from Katrina Guillou, Anam Imo (2), Hlin Eiriksdottir, Hanna Andersson, Jennie Nordin (2), Ellen Karlsson (2), Cajsa Hedlund (2), Cecilia Edlund.\n\nThe Damallsvenskan returns this weekend after a break for the Olympics with these matches:\n\nRound Thirteen Fixtures:\n\nVäxjö v Vittsjö\n\nHammarby v Eskilstuna United\n\nAIK v Djurgården\n\nPiteå v Linköping\n\nRosengård v KIF Örebro\n\nKristianstads v BK Häcken\n\nELITETTAN\n\nUmeå IK extended their lead at the top of the table after they won 2-0 at the fading challengers of Älvsjö AIK FF – a score line which, combined with the chasing pack all dropping points put them six points clear at the Elitettan’s summit. Goals from Sarah Mellouk (20) and Henna-Rikka Honkanen (34) sealed the win. Second placed IK Uppsala were held 0-0 by Bollstanäs SK who had lost all bar two of their matches going into this game. Morön BK, who went into the game in third place, fell to a 1-0 loss at home to IF Brommapojkarna who now replace their hosts in that position in the table after a fantastic run of results. Their win was thanks to Jennifer Sjösten’s goal after 13 minutes to the shock of the 171 fans. Lidköpings FK and IFK Kalmar, two members of the pack just outside of the promotion spots faced off and drew 1-1 in a result which helped neither side. Andrea Thorisson put Kalmar ahead, but agonisingly for them, the home side bagged an equaliser from Emilia Bengtsson with just three minutes left to the delight of the 181 strong crowd.\n\nLatest Results: Morön BK 0-1 IF Brommapojkarna, Borgeby FB 3-3 Sundsvalls DFF, Alingsås FC United 0-2 Mallbackens IF Sunne, Älvsjö AIK FF 0-2 Umeå IK, Bollstanäs SK 0-0 IK Uppsala, Lidköpings FK 1-1 IFK Kalmar, IFK Norrköping 0-1 Jitex Mölndal.\n\nNext Fixtures: Jitex Mölndal v Lidköpings FK, Älvsjö AIK FF v Borgeby FB, Mallbackens IF Sunne v Bollstanäs SK, Sundsvalls DFF v IFK Norrköping, IF Brommapojkarna v IFK Kalmar, Umeå IK v Alingsås FC United, IK Uppsala v Morön BK.\n\nNEWS ROUND-UP:\n\nReports from Telegraph website say that Rosengård‘s Hanna Bennison’s move to Everton is finalised with a six figure transfer fee agreed. This would fit with Rosengård’s sporting director Therese Sjögran’s earlier statement that Bennison will not go for a fee below €100,000. Bennison did not train with Rosengård at the end of this week.\n\nAs we first suggested a couple of weeks ago, KIF Örebro‘s Karin Lundin has joined Fiorentina.\n\nKristianstad have signed Delaney Baie Pridham, an American forward, from IBV Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland.\n\nAIK has agreed a loan deal with Orlando Pride for defender Konya Plummer to join on a loan deal for the rest of the season. The 24 year-old was Jamaica’s captain in the 2019 World Cup in France. The Solna based side have also taken 22 year-old midfielder Joy Bokiri on a deal for the rest of the season. Bokiri is capped for Nigeria and joins from Bayelsa Queens in her homeland.\n\n19 year-old midfielder Louise Hvarfner has extended her contract with Djurgården for a further three and a half years."
