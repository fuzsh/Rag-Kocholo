        "text": "Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern[1][2] (German language: Leopold Stephan Karl Anton Gustav Eduard Tassilo Fürst von Hohenzollern)[1][2] (22 September 1835 – 8 June 1905)[1][2] was the head of the Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollern, and played a fleeting role in European power politics, in connection with the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nHe was born into the dynasty's surviving Sigmaringen branch, which inherited all the dynasty's Swabian lands when the Hohenzollern-Hechingen branch became extinct.\n\nLeopold's parents were Josephine of Baden and Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern.[1][2] Leopold was the older brother[1][2] of King Carol I of Romania and father of the future King Ferdinand of Romania.[1][2] Carol ascended the Romanian throne in 1866, and Leopold renounced his rights to the Romanian succession in favor of his sons in 1880.[3]\n\nEntry into European controversy[]\n\nMain article: Franco-Prussian War\n\nMain article: German Unification\n\nAfter the Spanish Revolution of 1868 that overthrew Queen Isabella II, Leopold was offered the Spanish Crown by the new government. This offer was supported by the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck, but opposed by the French Emperor Napoleon III on the grounds that the installation of a relative of the Prussian king would result in the expansion of Prussian influence and the encirclement of France. Leopold was forced to decline the offer.\n\nAdditional demands made by the French government heightened diplomatic tensions between Paris and Berlin. The deliberate or accidental mistranslation of a diplomatic communiqué, the Ems Telegram, also known as the Ems Dispatch, led to the declaration of war by France. Prussia's speedy mobilization, together with the support of the other members of the North German Confederation, resulted in French defeat, the consequences of which were:\n\nthe capture of Napoleon III and the collapse of his government\n\nthe French loss of Alsace and a part of Lorraine\n\nthe imposition upon France of huge war reparations (five billion gold francs) to be paid within five years\n\ninstitution of the French Third Republic\n\ncreation of the German Empire.\n\nMarriage and issue[]\n\nIn 1861 Leopold married Infanta Antónia of Portugal, daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and King Ferdinand II of Portugal.[1][2] They had the following children:[1][2]\n\nWilliam, Prince of Hohenzollern (7 March 1864 – 22 October 1927) he married Princess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on 27 June 1889. They have three children. He remarried Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria on 20 January 1915.\n\nPrince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern (25 August 1865 – 20 July 1927) he married Princess Marie of Edinburgh on 10 January 1893. They have six children.\n\nPrince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern (1 September 1868 – 21 February 1919) he married Princess Joséphine Caroline of Belgium on 28 May 1894. They have four children.\n\nHad Leopold succeeded to the Spanish throne, he could possibly have founded a second German dynasty in Spain, following the extinction of the House of Austria less than two centuries earlier.\n\nHonours[]"
