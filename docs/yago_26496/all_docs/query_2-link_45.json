        "text": "This house descends, as do all the Hohenzollerns, from Friedrich I, Count of Zollern, who died in 1125. The younger son of Friedrich III, who died around 1204, became the ancestor of the Royal House of Prussia, while Friedrich IV retained the county of Zollern.\n\nThis family divided in various ways, some of the houses becoming extinct, and eventually leaving two lines – Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, the heads of both families being invested as Counts of the Holy Roman Empire in 1623. It was to this second, Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollern which from 1535 had its base at the imposing Castle Sigmaringen on the Danube, that Prince Friedrich Wilhelm belonged.\n\nAfter the Hechingen line died out in 1869, the Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen adopted the simpler title of Prince of Hohenzollern.\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm Ferdinand Josef Maria Manuel Georg Meinrad Fidelis Benedikt Michael Hubert was born at Schloss Umkirch on February 3 1924, the eldest son of Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern and Princess Margrete, eldest daughter of King Friedrich August III, King of Saxony.\n\nIn 1944, the Gestapo forced the princely family out of Sigmaringen Castle when it was briefly taken over by Philippe Pétain and other members of the Vichy government, who fled there after the fall of France to the Allies. The castle itself was taken by the Free French army in April 1945.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm read Economics at the University of Freiburg and joined a bank in Basle for two years before, in 1950, taking over at the helm of the family-run company, which owns swathes of forest and agricultural land, as well as metalworks and the cable car to the Arber mountain in the Bavarian Forest.\n\nThe following year Friedrich Wilhelm married Princess Margarita of Leiningen, second daughter of Karl, sixth Prince of Leiningen and his wife, Maria (daughter of Grand Duke Cyril of Russia, the dubious but energetic claimant to the Russian Imperial throne). Princess Margarita died in 1996.\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm became Head of the House of Hohenzollern on the death of his father in 1965. In the 1970s he had to sell off some of the family’s property to support the failing steel industry but, increasingly in tandem with his eldest son, Karl Friedrich, he helped restore the business. Today it has 3,000 employees and annual sales of half a billion pounds.\n\nAfter his wife’s death Prince Friedrich Wilhelm retired to a country estate, Jagdschloss Josefslust, and opened Sigmaringen Castle to the public. It contains 3,000 weapons collected by his ancestor, Prince Karl Anton (1813-1885), and a terrifying array of implements in the torture chamber.\n\nVested in the Prince was a claim to the throne of Romania, in the event of the death of the present king, Michael. This was due to an interpretation of the Romanian Constitution of 1923 when, following the first youthful abdication of King Michael, his father, King Carol II, declared that the Romanian throne should pass down the senior line of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen .\n\nBut the succession depended on Salic Law, which technically prevented any of King Michael’s daughters ascending to the Romanian throne. The matter was further complicated as Prince Friedrich Wilhelm’s grandfather, Prince Wilhelm (1864-1927), had renounced his Romanian rights in favour of his younger brother, King Ferdinand of Romania."
