Second cousins, to be more precise.\n\nCory, by now most members are wise to the games you play, the inherent contradictions and the about-faces, whether it be here, the Romanian forum, the Savoy and Savoy-Aosta threads in the Royal Families of Italy forum, the HIH Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna threads in the Russian forum, etc etc.\n\nI wish I could respond here,but then you could not read it,sadly.\n\nMiss you here Warren.Very much so.\n\nX\n\nWho is princess Anna of Hohenzollern?

The castle spoken of is not Hohenzollern castle. It is burg namedy. It is her family home. It seems she has been working with her mother in the estate for years, according to the castle website.\n\nShe lives at Andernach Castle near Koblenz which her great-grandfather bought and which is still in the posession of this branch of the Family.\n\nIs that Schloss Burg Namedy near Andernach?

She speaks of their dork on restoration and how her daughter works with them.\n\nPrince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern is the son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern and his wife, Princess Margarita of Leiningen. Ferdinand has the fourth position in line of succession to the headship of the Royal House of Romania.\n\nHas he ever visited his wife's relatives in Romania?\n\nWhat a tragedy!\n\nMaybe he could not deal with pangs of conscience and fell into depression?\n\nCondolences to his mum and sister.\n\nPrince Karl-Friedrich with Princess Katarina at the annual dinner of The Versailles Foundation on Thursday, May 3, 2018\n\nhttp://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i...ss-Prince-Karl-Friederich-of-Hohenzollern.jpg\n\nhttp://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i...poulos,-Foundation-Director-Camila-Koenig.jpg\n\nPrince Karl-Friedrich with Princess Katarina at the annual dinner of The Versailles Foundation on Thursday, May 3, 2018\n\nhttp://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i...ss-Prince-Karl-Friederich-of-Hohenzollern.jpg\n\nhttp://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i...poulos,-Foundation-Director-Camila-Koenig.jpg\n\nhttp://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i...poulos,-Foundation-Director-Camila-Koenig.jpg\n\nAnd who are they?\n\nA Princely Engagenemt was announced!\n\nhttps://t.co/1GdFNeJukz?amp=1\n\nCongratulations to the couple.

Yes, a study in Wageningen surely helps mastering Dutch. The engaged couple both are quite well educated and clearly cosmopolitan. Also nice to see connections with other royal and noble families.\n\nCongratulations to the couple.\n\nThe groom is closely related to Fürstin Katalin von Wrede and Count Nikolaus Bethlen de Bethlen, husband of Princess Theodora zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.\n\nHis father, also named Karl, Freiherr Stipsicz von Ternova, is their second cousin.\n\nThe second marriage of Prince (Fürst) Konstantin of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1801-1869) with Baroness (Freiin) Amalie Schenk von Geyern (1832-1897), who was created Countess of Rothenburg in 1866, was ended on February 13, 1863.
