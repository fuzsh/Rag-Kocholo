They had three children.\n\nPrincess Marie was an accomplished artist, even occasionally exhibiting her paintings at the Brussels Fair. She had a literary salon, which was the gathering place of many authors as well as a feature of Brussels social life for forty years.[1] She also demonstrated appreciation for music, on one occasion awarding a gold medal to the Zoellner Quartet after it performed for the Belgian royalty.[3]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nMarie Luise died in Belgium in 1912 at the age of 67, after suffering from pneumonia for several days.[1] She was buried in the Church of Our Lady of Laeken.\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nKingdom of Bavaria: Dame of the Order of Saint Elizabeth, 1900: wedding gift in honour of her son.[4]\n\nKingdom of Spain: 723rd Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa - .[5]\n\nDame of the Starry Cross.[6]\n\nDame grand Cross in the Order of the Iron Crown.[7]\n\nDame of the Order of Saint Isabel.[8]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
