Faisal II (born May 2, 1935, Baghdad, Iraq—died July 14, 1958, Baghdad) was the last king of Iraq, who reigned from 1939 to 1958.

Faisal II, grandson of Faisal I and great-grandson of Hussein ibn Ali, former sharif of Mecca and king of the Hejaz, became king of Iraq following the untimely death of his father, King Ghazi. Because Faisal was only four years old, his maternal uncle ʿAbd al-Ilāh became regent. In April 1941, when the nationalist prime minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani briefly seized power from ʿAbd al-Ilāh, Faisal was smuggled out of the country by his mother, Queen Aliyah, and was educated at Harrow School in England. After the queen’s death in 1950 ʿAbd al-Ilāh became Faisal’s sole guardian.
