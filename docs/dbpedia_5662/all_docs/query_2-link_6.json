        "text": "The City of New York has hosted hundreds of distinguished individuals and groups, from heads of state to accomplished athletes. The art of a New York City reception was the brainchild of public relations guru Grover A. Whalen, who served as the Chairman of the Mayor’s Reception Committee from 1917-1953. Whalen’s work is recorded in thousands of photographs and other materials, including scrapbooks, ephemera, and correspondence, and is preserved here at the Municipal Archives.\n\nWhalen’s collection chronicles how New York City received guests from around the world. While relatively joyous in tone, I couldn’t help but notice a common denominator amongst many of the City’s guests, especially in the post-World War II era. A pattern of misfortune, if you will, worth exploring. This series, Doomed Guests, will offer a glimpse of once-distinguished guests of the City of New York and the tragedies that befell them afterward.\n\nAnd what was Faisal’s favorite team? Why, the Brooklyn Dodgers, of course! Luckily, his stay in New York coincided with a game between crosstown rivals the Dodgers and New York Giants at Ebbets Field in Flatbush (Dodgers won, 5-4). Faisal was given a tour of the field (“Who are these men?” asked Faisal, pointing across the field, to which he got the reply, “Those are the hated Giants.”) and taken to the Dodgers’ dugout where he met Jackie Robinson and Dodgers manager Chuck Dressen.\n\nTaking in the game from the cushy seats of team owner Walter O’Malley, Faisal goofed up when he smiled at O’Malley after Bobby Thomson of the Giants hit a home run. Undoubtedly a smile meant to reassure, rather than antagonize, “Kid Faisal” learned his lesson about how seriously New Yorkers take their baseball and their rivalries. Thomson’s home run hit out of the park was a little too similar to his hit off the Dodgers that clinched the National League championship the previous October. This was explained to Faisal, to which one of his aides sagely replied back, “Maktoob,” an Arabic saying that means, “It is written!” (It should be emphasized how headline-worthy this story was, with headlines such as, “King Lets Dodgers Down With a Smile,” “Young King Boots One - Ethics of Ebbets Field are Violated by Faisal,” and “King of Iraq Muffs One at the Ball Game”.)\n\nIn other activities, news reports described the King as a keen photographer, which he exhibited during a four-hour boat ride around Manhattan, hosted by Lt. Gen. Willis D. Crittenberger, Commander of the First Army. The New York Times wrote: “It is more than likely that the young King will become a temporary member of the White House corps of camera men. He is Iraq’s No. 1 photographer...” He used an Army Polaroid Land camera, “which produces a print one minute after the shutter is tripped.”\n\nPost-Visit\n\nLess than a year after Faisal’s trip to the United States, he became old enough to rule Iraq in his own right. His reign would only last five years.\n\nThe monarchy’s end was quite similar to the regicide of the Russian Tsarist autocracy in 1917. On July 14, 1958, a coup d’état, orchestrated by officers who called themselves the “Free Officers” (inspired by the Egyptian Free Officers who overthrew the Egyptian Monarchy in 1952), raided the Qasr al-Zuhur (Palace of Roses) and directed the royal family to the courtyard, under the pretense that a helicopter would pick them up. Instead, they were lined up, facing the palace walls, and machine-gunned. Among the dead were Faisal; Abdul Ilah; Princess Nafeesa, Abdul Ilah’s mother; Princess Abadiya, Faisal’s aunt; and Princess Hiyam, Abdul Ilah’s wife. Mob mentality ensued and took over Baghdad; Faisal and Abdul Ilah’s bodies were dragged through the streets and hung outside the Ministry of Defense as evidence that Iraq had been liberated from its Western ties.\n\nThus ends the story of one of our Doomed Guests: Faisal II, the last King of Iraq.\n\nIraq’s political history (especially from the early to mid-20th century) is fascinating stuff and I highly recommend exploring the subject further. For a straightforward overview, check out The Iraq War: Origins and Consequences by James DeFronzo and this synopsis on the 1958 Iraqi Revolution, written by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Both were great resources in writing this post. Unless otherwise noted, all photographs are from the Grover A.
