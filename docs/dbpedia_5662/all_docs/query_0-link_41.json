        "text": "Just like Prince William, Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan carried their new addition and slipped into the driver's seat for the ride home\n\nCrown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa's departure from the hospital with their first child was reminiscent of another royal baby's arrival.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the heir to the Jordanian throne and his wife, both 30, made their first public appearance with their newborn daughter, Princess Iman, who was born at King Hussein Medical Center on Aug. 3. In a video shared to X by Jordan TV, Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa smiled hand-in-hand as they left the hospital with their baby girl.\n\nAs the press captured the moment and onlookers cheered, Hussein carried their new addition and strapped her carrier into the backseat of a car. The new dad took the driver's seat as they headed home for the first time as a family of three.\n\nThe moment mirrored Prince William and Kate Middleton's same milestone over a decade ago when their eldest son, Prince George, now 11, was born.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, the future Prince and Princess of Wales continued a royal tradition and introduced their first child to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital in London. The couple took turns holding Prince George, who was born the day before and follows his father in the direct line of succession to the throne, during the photo call and brief question session with the press.\n\nWhen they left later, Prince William carried his new baby in a car seat, buckled it into the back of a Range Rover and drove home.\n\nRelated: Kate Middleton and Prince William's Road from College Sweethearts to Royal Family of 5\n\nPrince William and Princess Kate repeated the same routine when Princess Charlotte, 9, was born in 2015 and Prince Louis, 6, arrived in 2018.\n\nKate later revealed that their first hospital exit required some practice beforehand. Appearing on the Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast in 2020, she revealed that her husband practiced with a doll before the day came to fasten Prince George's car seat.\n\n\"We were like ‘What do we do?… in a swaddle?’ ‘How’s this supposed to work?’ We’d even tried to practice with a little baby, like a little doll, at home, but you know it just never works out the way you planned it. So it was quite hard to do that on the world’s stage, but no, he did a very good job,\" the royal mom said during the media appearance four years ago.\n\nRelated: Prince William and King Charles Clashed Over Use of Helicopter for Kate Middleton and Their Children, New Book Claims\n\n\"Particularly with your first-born baby, you think everything is going to go back to how it was,\" she later added in the conversation with host Giovanna Fletcher. \"I totally underestimated the impact and the change it had on our lives from that moment really and I think, unless you’ve got children, you don’t realize. No amount of planning and preparation can get you ready for that moment.\"\n\nThe Princess of Wales has since made advocating for greater awareness around the importance of a child's early years a key pillar of her royal platform.\n\nPrincess Kate and Prince William, both 42, were guests at Crown Prince Hussein's royal wedding to Rajwa Alseif in Amman on June 1, 2023. The Princess of Wales has a special connection to the Jordanian city, as she briefly lived there as a young child with her family while her father, Michael Middleton, worked at British Airways. The Middletons lived abroad for two and a half years, and Kate attended nursery school there.\n\nPrince William later said his wife was \"very sorry\" she couldn't join him during an official trip to Jordan soon after the birth of Prince Louis in 2018, and the couple chatted with the newlywed Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa (who received her royal title on her wedding day) at least twice during the wedding celebrations. Both couples share a similar path as both princes are heirs to their respective thrones — Prince William as the eldest son of King Charles, and Crown Prince Hussein as the eldest son of King Abdullah.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Rajwa wore a blue dress like Kate did to match her sapphire and diamond engagement ring that previously belonged to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, while Crown Prince Hussein sported a classic suit with a dark tie like Prince William.\n\nWhile King Abdullah and Queen Rania became first-time grandparents upon the birth of Princess Iman, her birth did not change the Jordanian line of succession. The constitution dictates that the throne of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is hereditary to King Abdullah Ibn Al-Hussein's dynasty and passes through males. Crown Prince Hussein is followed by his 19-year-old brother, Prince Hashem, and their sisters, Princess Iman, 27, and Princess Salma, 23, are not in the line of succession.\n\nCrown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa appeared to honor his sister by naming their daughter Iman, an Arabic name meaning \"belief\" and \"faith.\" Her birth was announced by the Royal Hashemite Court, and proud grandmother Queen Rania posted photos of the family's visit soon after.\n\n\"Iman, you’ve already got a hold of my heart. Our family has never been happier,\" she wrote below the carousel on Instagram.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
