        "text": "THE ISSUE: The suicide of convicted “DC madam” Deborah Jeane Palfrey.\n\nBecause of shame, Deborah Jeane Palfrey took her own life (“DC Madam’s Suicide Note,” May 5).\n\nShe was to be punished for this evil, but how about our so-called leaders who were part of the tango?\n\nDo tragedies like these change anything for the better? I doubt it.\n\nFor the sake of these women, we should legalize the oldest profession of the past and present.\n\nRichard Homer Bucco\n\nBloomfield, NJ\n\n****\n\nThe suicide of the DC madam is yet another argument for the legalization of prostitution.\n\nProstitution has been around since the dawn of time, and it will never go away.\n\nIf prostitution were legal, sexually transmitted-disease rates would go down, crime would go down and tax revenues would soar.\n\nNevada has legalized prostitution, and civilization has not come to an end.\n\nDean Delianites\n\nBrooklyn\n\n****\n\nI consider prostitute-patronizing former Gov. Eliot Spitzer to have some of Palfrey’s blood on his hands.\n\nShe killed herself because she was facing four to six years in prison, yet he has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe laws of supply and demand tell us that her business would not have existed if not for adulterous customers like Spitzer.\n\nJustice demands that either all participants in prostitution be prosecuted or none at all."
