        "text": "Anthony Perkins, an American actor best known for his role as Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock's seminal horror film Psycho, was a figure of intrigue and prodigious talent within the realm of Hollywood. Born in New York City on April 4, 1932, to stage actor Osgood Perkins and Janet Esselstyn Rane, Perkins embarked on his acting career during the Golden Age of Hollywood, honing his craft at The Actors Studio. Initially, Perkins gained recognition for his compelling performances in stage productions, with his Broadway debut in Tea and Sympathy earning him a Theatre World Award. His seamless transition to the silver screen further solidified his reputation as a versatile actor. Perkins's portrayal of charming yet troubled characters in films like Friendly Persuasion (1956) earned him an Academy Award nomination, demonstrating his ability to imbue complex psychological portraits with subtlety and sophistication. Perkins's most infamous role came in 1960 when he starred as the tormented motel owner, Norman Bates, in Psycho. His chilling performance not only defined his career but also reshaped the landscape of horror cinema forever. Despite being typecast in similar roles thereafter, Perkins continued to deliver noteworthy performances in films like The Trial (1962) and Pretty Poison (1968). A gifted musician, Perkins also had a penchant for jazz music and released three pop albums during his career. He passed away in 1992, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire actors and filmmakers around the globe.\n\nBuddy Ebsen, (born April 2, 1908 – July 6, 2003; also known as Frank \"Buddy\" Ebsen) was an American actor and dancer whose career spanned seven decades. His most famous role was as Jed Clampett in the CBS television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies (1962–1971); afterwards he starred as the title character in the television detective drama Barnaby Jones (1973–1980).Originally a dancer, Ebsen began his career in Broadway Melody of 1936. He also appeared as a dancer with child star Shirley Temple in Captain January (1936). Ebsen was the original choice for the role of the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, but fell ill due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with Maureen O'Hara in They Met in Argentina (1941) and June Havoc in Sing Your Worries Away (1942). In Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of Audrey Hepburn's character. Before his starring role in The Beverly Hillbillies, Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett's sidekick, George Russell, in Walt Disney's Davy Crockett miniseries (1953–54)."
