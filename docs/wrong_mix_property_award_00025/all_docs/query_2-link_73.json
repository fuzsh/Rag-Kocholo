        "text": "To mark the 127th birthday of physicist Niels Bohr, Google has created a doodle to showcase his contributions to science and features his Bohr atomic model.\n\nHere are 10 things you need to know about the scientist...\n\n1. Niels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist, born in Copenhagen on October 7, 1885\n\n2. His father was Christian Bohr who observed the phenomenon called Bohr shift\n\n3. Niels took his Master's degree in Physics in 1909 and his Doctor's degree in 1911\n\n4. Niels married Margrethe Norlund - the sister of the mathematician Niels Erik Norlund - in 1912 after dating for two years\n\n5. In 1913 Niels published his model of atomic structure and also the idea that an electron could emit a photon of discrete energy as it dropped from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one\n\n6. In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them\"\n\n7. He was a keen footballer and he played in goal for Akademisk Boldklub\n\n8. Fearing arrest by the Germans, Niels fled to Britain during World War II and then to New Mexico to work on the Manhattan Project - a research and development program by the US and UK - that produced the first atomic bomb\n\n9. Niels appears on the Danish 500 Kroner\n\n10. He died from heart failure in Copenhagen in 1962"
