        "text": "Pussycat Dolls - Whatcha Think About That, the video version, I've never been able to find it to buy or stream anywhere has it ever been available to download in the UK at all? I much prefer it to the crappy album version.\n\nI don't think so, unfortunately. Even the UK CD single has the album version. That's reminded me of Gwen's Rich Girl video mix not being commercially released either, so annoying!\n\nSome early 2000s hits/flops not available in the UK but are elsewhere (a couple of these may have already been mentioned):\n\nArtful Dodger - Woman Trouble (the It's All About the Stragglers album is missing, but some singles from it are still available to hear via other releases)\n\nBellefire - All I Want Is You\n\nBo Selecta - I Got You Babe\n\nEstelle - 1980, Free, Go Gone (the 18th Day album is missing)\n\nIan Van Dahl - Reason, Try, Will I\n\nJaimeson feat. Angel Blue - True (only an extended version is available)\n\nMade In London - Dirty Water\n\nTriple 8 - Knockout\n\nTrue Steppers - Buggin'\n\nA few Girls Aloud singles (i.e. CD1/CD2 track lists) have become unavailable. You can see a lot of tracks are greyed out in their \"Official Fan Playlist\", most notably On a Round and Stay Another Day.\n\nMariah's Angels Cry with Ne-Yo isn't available (but I can't recall if it ever was?)\n\nMelanie C Let There Be Love (Germany/Austria/Switzerland) & Geri's Half of Me (Australia) are restricted in the UK, not sure if they're available in any other countries beyond what I've listed! Emma's All I Need to Know Radio Edit & the B Side Midnight & Martinis also unavailable here.\n\nYou're doing god's work, aquaplex. I just had a bop to It's About Time You Were Mine after seeing your post that it was now available on Spotify. I had searched for that song several times over the years.\n\nKii at you bullying them into getting the album up when Thunderbugs get 997 listens a month.\n\nHa is it really bullying when I'm getting them to do their job properly?! Sony had taken the time to add Thunderbugs album up - even crediting it as copyrighted to the UK yet didn't tick the right box.\n\nThe Friends Forever single is on there but blocked and tagged to the individuals - put the below in your browser minus the space between // and open.spotify. https:// open.spotify.com/album/0ub3g6WmdbCAiGo2MY9VZk\n\nSeriously though, I'm happy to keep up the cause and that people appreciate it. Though I am conscious there is a limit to what I can do, hence me trying to amass a Twitter movement of 27 people!!"
