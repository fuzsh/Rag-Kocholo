        "text": "Willie J Healy – Komedia Basement\n\nThe Frankenstein of Harrison, Costello and Bowie - Willie J Healy is one of the best songwriters out there and a master of his craft. He first appeared on my radar in 2017 with ‘People & Their Dogs’ and has gone from strength to strength since then, recently supporting Florence & The Machine on tour. Opening with shoulder shaker ‘Little Sister’ and playing through all new single releases ‘Thank You, ‘Sure Feels Good’, ‘Dreams’ and ‘Tiger Woods’ the New York influence is apparent on all new tracks from ‘Bunny’. If you haven’t heard him before, start with the album ‘Twin Heavy’.. it’s a masterpiece and soundtrack to the summer of 2020. A privilege to see him in a basement venue before he plays to sold-out stadiums in the summer, opening for the Arctic Monkeys. Demob Happy – The White Rabbit\n\nScuzz butchers Demob Happy have been making ceilings sweat since the infamous Late Night Lingerie shows back at Sticky Mike’s about a decade ago. Riffs that bite knees like a Tasmanian devil packing heat, and choruses that make you sing-a-long so hard, you sound like Frank Butcher smoking Dot Cotton’s quota of Benson & Hedges for a week afterwards - it’s everything rock’n’roll should be. I tipped Demob here back in 2017, so no surprises whatsoever to see them, Tigercub and Kid Kapichi being the 3 Kings with the Queens influence. William The Conqueror – Queens Hotel\n\nSpeaking of royalty, the Queens Hotel is an unorthodox venue… With a carpet that Auntie Linda would be proud of, they also decide to leave their heating on which makes the venue hotter than the molten lava Pierce Brosnan had to stop in Dante’s Peak. That’s one of the endearing features of TGE, having 500 artists in just a few days means you see acts in places you’ve never been to before. WTC press all those Dan Auerbach and Jack White buttons. Lucid Americana, tinged with a Nashville tongue.. It’s groove based and rough and ready in all the right places. For fans of The Doors, Neil Young & The Raconteurs. Ghost Woman - The Latest Music Bar\n\nThe dirge and grit of Ghost Woman is impressive. Their sound reminds me of ‘Passover’ era Black Angels meets the Secret Machines. Gutted not to hear ‘Broke’ live but love the fact they mix their setlist up every night.\n\nNo water in this venue, just a can of Guinness with a side of black treacle please. Cover yourself in the treacle, get some rogue seagull feathers and then run in the sea… the only way to wash yourself clean after watching Ghost Woman.Billie Marten – Komedia Basement\n\nWith a set that is made for the haziest of evenings at Greenman, End of the Road or Glasto, Billie Marten draws comparisons with Laura Marling and they are justified. Prolific with her fourth album released this year at only 23 years old, you could easily imagine her doing a Royal Albert Hall headline set one day. Beach Riot – Village Café Bar\n\nThese purveyors of fuzz never fail to disappoint. A melting pot of the wonkiness of Elastica meets the distortion of Mudhoney.. all supercharged by Red Stripe and regret."
