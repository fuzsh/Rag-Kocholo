Sheridan Ave, OKC, OK 73106.\n\nDoes The Jones Assembly have seats?\n\nAll tickets are general admission, standing room only, unless a show is specifically advertised as a seated show. Don’t fear! There are plenty of bench and table seats with great views of the stage in our courtyard. These seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nIs The Jones Assembly an indoor or outdoor venue?\n\nGreat question! We’re both! We are very proud of our venue and our indoor/outdoor concert experience. All GA tickets are considered rain or shine. In some cases, we will advertise indoor only concerts or outdoor only concerts.\n\nDoes The Jones Assembly have a box office?\n\nYes, however, all tickets must be purchased online prior to the show. On the night of shows, the box office will open 30 minutes before the doors open.\n\nWhat is a ’mezzanine’ ticket?\n\nOur mezzanine upper level is called the ’T Room’. We will sell a limited number of mezzanine (standing room only) tickets which include several amenities not included in the GA ticket. Admission includes T Room private bar access, private restrooms and access to our mezzanine outdoor patio. All mezzanine ticket holders have all access to ground level (indoor/outdoor).\n\nWhat is The Jones Assembly refund policy?\n\nAll sales are final. No refunds or exchanges unless the headliner cancels the performance. If this occurs, refund info will be available on the event details page. The benefit to purchasing a ticket online is that refunds are automatically processed by Ticketfly (our ticketing service).

Our building has ADA accessible viewing for all live music events. Areas vary depending on specific concert seating configurations.
