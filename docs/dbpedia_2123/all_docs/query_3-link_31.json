        "text": "All right, we're just about at the time, we have a lot of material to cover, so why don't we get started? Well, first of all, I wanted to thank each and every one of you for attending our second installment of everything you wanted to know about A2P 10DLC. I'm sure there's a lot more things you'd like to do with your time than listen to Compliance Talk, but, this one is going to be hopefully both informative and necessary for you to have attended in order for you to take some action. So before I begin, I wanted to do some introductions. My name is Sergey Sandokovsky. I'm a co-founder, CPO, and CTO for Salesmsg, which basically means I handle product and tech within Salesmsg. And I'm lucky to be joined by David Stupek. David is our Customer Support Manager, and he brings a wealth of experience of dealing with 10DLC for the last couple of years. So, between the two of us, we hopefully should cover most of the questions that you guys might have about 10DLC. Now, what are you going to learn during this webinar? So, one of the things that we pride ourselves at Salesmsg, we want to make sure that we handle all the complexity of texting so you don't have to worry. Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible for us to do without some help from you. We're going to do a very quick review of what 10DLC is and what is the promise and benefits of 10DLC. But we're also going to cover what is changing and why it is so urgent for you to take action right now. We're going to cover the 10DLC process and also talk about throughput and fees, specifically about trust score within 10DLC. And if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it. We're going to cover it in detail. We're also allocated quite a bit of time for Q&A. We seeded this presentation with quite a few questions that we harvested over the years, about 10DLC and all the latest changes. However, we're also going to leave some time for questions that you have during the presentation or anything that we haven't addressed directly. So, behind the scenes, we have an amazing Salesmsg team that will answer some of your questions online and also will teed up for us at the end of the presentation. And if you have any issues, you can't hear me, please don't hesitate to put something in the chat and we'll try to make some adjustments. All right, so, without further ado, I am going to get started. All right, so, first of all, what is 10DLC? We keep hearing about 10DLC. What is it? So, 10DLC is A2P is the system within the United States that enables blah, blah, blah, blah blah. This is a very long description of what 10DLC is about. But really, if you boil this down to a single phrase or single sentence, really, 10DLC, it's all about licensing for your texting. That's what it's really about. Now, again it's intentionally or unintentionally, it's been made fairly cryptic now, so let's break down the name and see what's in the name. So, first of all, A2P application to person. So if you're a business and you are sending text, then you're under an umbrella of application to person. So if you took out your personal phone and just use your personal number in order to text and since you're joining this call, we know that you're our customer, and you know that that's not a good idea, then you are under an umbrella of A2P because you're using an application as a business in order to send messages to your customers. Then what is 10DLC? Well, 10DLC is really a ten digit number. So if you're using a local number, that you either had or purchased from Salesmsg, then, that's the 10DLC one digit code. And again, which numbers are covered under the umbrella of 10DLC? So short codes are not covered, toll free numbers are not covered. Landlines you could see an address if you enabled it. For texting, it's covered under 10DLC. And obviously, any local number that you purchased from us or brought with you, that is covered under the umbrella of 10DLC. And it needs to go through the registration process. So when I first started learning about 10DLC, I wanted to connect it to something I already knew. And if you look at texting as an equivalence to email, then you will see there's just an analogous lining between all the line items that are in this list. So you will see that email service providers like Yahoo and Google are basically carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon in the world of SMS. Then you also have spam and blacklisting. Well, that's equivalent to filtering and blacklisting under these carriers. Then you also have spam rules. And for texting you have TCPA and CIA, and for the trust records, you have DKIM and SPF. If you don't know what that is, it's basically declaring your identity. While for text messaging, you have 10DLC. So there is one to one equivalence between all the items that you actually do have under texting as it applies to email. All right, so if that wasn't clear enough, then really, what is the registration all about? What do they want you to do under 10DLC? Well, first of all, they want to know who you are. They want to make sure that you're a reputable business. And they also want to know what kind of messages you are going to be texting and the other remaining two items which are extremely, extremely important. In order to make sure that you are texting somebody that opted in for the messages, you need to indicate how exactly you are gathering the opt-in. So in other words, these unwanted texts that people keep complaining about. You need to make sure that you tell the carriers, this is exactly how I gather the opt-in information. And everybody I'm going to be sending the text to opted in for these texts to arrive. Number two, if the customer has changed their mind and they don't want to be receiving any more text, how exactly can they opt-out? So that's the fourth piece of information that the carriers want to know about and that's really it. So if you boil that down, if you boil down that complicated process to four line items, that's really what they care about. Knowing who you are, knowing what exactly you are going to be texting, and making sure that it's covered under the regulations of some of the prohibited content that carriers don't want to see that you have gathered the opt-in and you also have an opt-out. The customers can actually opt-out from receiving the messages. All right, so what's changing? So, as you know, getting an account with Salesmsg is really quick. And so many other players within the space, that's exactly the process with them as well. You can easily go and just simply sign up for the account and start texting right away. So the easy way for you to start texting has the other side. So players that are non-reputable within the ecosystem have taken advantage of this ease of getting into texting. So they would sign up for the account and start sending spam. So in order to prevent that, the industry came together. Carriers came together and they set up an entity that's going to be policing texting. And this is really under the umbrella of A2P 10DLC. Now, so far, all the registration for 10DLC has been optional. So you should have done it a long time ago, but if you haven't done it, there were some increased fees and there were some potential deliverability penalties. However, you could still do the texting, now that the state of affairs has come into an end. So carriers said, okay, no more. We gave everybody ample time in order to register. So now we are actually drawing the line in the sand. And that line is going to come on August 31. So August 31, if you have not registered for 10DLC, then you are not going to be able to text. Regardless of what other partners you have using for your texting Salesmsg or not, you're not going to be able to do it. So this is the industry-wide initiative that's going to be enforced by all the players within the system. Now, even though August 31 is a final deadline, as of July 5, you're going to see some of the reduced deliverability and throughput rates, as well as some of the additional fees being enacted. So, again even though it's a couple of months away, it's imperative that you start this process as early as possible because you can imagine the closer the deadline, the more stragglers you have and if you have not registered, the delays are expected. So if the normal process would take under a week, the entities that are involved in registering businesses are going to get backed up. So keep that in mind. Don't procrastinate. All right, so these are the message fees broken down as a table. So the price for unregistered traffic is going up leading up to August 31, where all unregistered traffic is going to be 100% blocked. All right, so I am going to hand it over to Dave to take you through the application and how we made it simple in Salesmsg to go through the process of registering and hopefully get you on the right side of, 10DLC. Dave, take it away. Thank you, Sergey. So before we really dive into it, step by step, we really need to understand our options before us. And thankfully, once we do get to the step by step and we do know the options we have we make it really easy in the application to just follow the prompts and get registered. So, let's take a look at our first option here. First option is called Sole Proprietorship. And this package is going to be a fit for you if you have one local number, if your campaign has a low message volume, and if your organization does not have a tax ID or EIN. However, keep in mind, if your organization does have that EIN or that tax ID, sole proprietorship will not be an option for you. We'll have to look at the other remaining options. So, moving along, the next option is Low Volume Standard. And Low Volume Standard will be a fit for your organization if, again, your campaign is low volume. So we're talking like 2000 texts a day and a lot of customers will fall under this umbrella and of course, this package is going to require that EIN. So if you don't have that, your option is going to be a sole proprietor. Taking a look at the final option Standard. And while this is a high volume package, this package is going to offer the best deliverability. And if you, excuse me, are serious about your text messages, you're likely going to want the Standard package. And when we take a closer look at the package fees, you'll see that the cost increase to be on standard is pretty negligible. So let's take a closer look at how I might as an individual select my package. So if we just start in the top left of this, graph here. Am I sending more than 6K messages a day? I'm going to need the standard package and then even going down one more, do I send more than 3K a day? Well, you're still going to need that standard package. And in fact, on the previous slide, like I said, even 2000 a day is still going to want to be on that standard package. Now, if you have an EIN and your text messaging is pretty modest in volume, Low Volume Standard could be a good fit for you. However, like I said before, if you take it seriously and you want the maximum amount of deliverability, the standard package will be the best option. And of course, if you do not have the EIN, you'll be a Sole Proprietor package. So now here is a dissection of these fees. So there's a combination of one-time fees and recurring fees, which I think is something that comes up frequently when we discuss 10DLC. Well, is it one time? Is it recurring? And unfortunately the answer is both. However, really nothing to be too scared of. So let's take a look. Sole proprietor one-time subtotal under $20. You will have that monthly fee, about $2 to $9 for that recurring campaign fee. There are also the pass-through fees for the text messages. That's what the line item carrier fee is. So those carrier fees are going to sort of accumulate into that $2 range for your fees. Low volume standard. Again, only a $20 one time fee. Same sort of parameters for carrier fees. So for the extra $30, you can pay $50 and get on that Standard package which offers the best deliverability. Now, in our application, this is the Salesmsg proprietary doomsday clock. And so we just want to make it blatantly obvious how much time you have left until these requirements kick in, right? So we're just trying to be overly transparent about what's to come. Now that we've kind of taken a look at our package options and we understand the fees, we can go through the step-by-step process and as I forecasted earlier, Salesmsg, and shout out to the Salesmsg product team, we make this very easy, easiest I've seen anywhere on the web. So you'll start with your business profile and here you are going to sort of branch off into that sole proprietor option or a standard option. So do I have that EIN number or not? So we really try to take away the ambiguity and we just keep you on rails to make sure that you're picking the best option for you. We'll help you find your business ID. So if you put in your EIN or tax ID right there, it will find your organization and we'll fill in all the details automatically. If we don't pull up your details and they don't come through through that find option, no worries, you can manually input the data as it is on your EIN confirmation letter and that is to be stressed. You do not want to put a DBA in there. You do not want to use your branding name. You want the name that is on your tax ID. So the legal business name and the EIN. And here we'll select business info. You'll give a website URL. You do need a website and it has to be https secured website, more business information. So we need an authorized representative from your organization to get in contact with. And finally a Terms and Privacy Disclosure where we send your information to those regulatory bodies to do that vetting and to return an approved profile. So that was pretty fast and that's half the process right there. So there's the business profile. Now we do have one more leg of the race to complete and it is the campaign. Here is where we're going to select that low volume or standard package. And again, you're really only going to have this choice if you are an organization with an EIN, regardless of which package you choose, you're going to go through the same prompts coming up. So you need to select a use case and provide a use case description. We color in that description. However, add more to it, right? Get specific. same thing with these sample messages. We preload a sample message, but please do add more. And in fact, let's look at some sample messages in the next slide in the darker blue. There are messages that are 100% compliant. That is exactly what the carrier networks want to see. Specifically, if I dissect it, it has a sender ID and it has an opt-out disclosure. So hello, first name. My name is David from Salesmsg, and then a reply Stop to opt out would be there as well. The other messages in the lighter blue, that's conversational back and forth. You don't need a sender ID or an opt out in every single message, especially like one where we're just communicating it back and forth. But it should be there on every first message and again about every 30 days assuming that the conversational messaging is not there. So here you're going to declare which method of opt-in your contacts are doing to provide consent that you can text them. We also offer examples of all of those options, but to just be even more transparent and clear. What is a proper opt-in? Well, a proper opt-in contains a Fee disclosure, a Service Frequency Disclosure, customer care information, the opt out instructions, a Privacy Policy, and a Terms and Conditions page, as well as a checkbox where the customer can declare that, yes, I want to receive these text messages. Your opt-in method description is here. So, in this example, we selected an online form, and then we would provide where that form lives. It might not be the homepage of your website that you submitted earlier, but maybe like that homepage backslash that gets quoted. Now, something like that, here is presented where you can upload an image of that opt-in. So go ahead and snap that screenshot of where your contacts are, consenting to receive messages for your text campaign, upload it to us, and it will streamline your approval. And at the very end here, there is one last call out, for all of the fees. So we just break it down line item by line item so that there's no ambiguity to what you're paying for. And assuming all things are well, you get approved in a pretty, timely fashion. And we indicate as much on your Salesmsg compliance page, letting you know that everything is approved, what brand type you have, and a preview of the information you submitted. And of course, you can always go back and review these things in detail. All of those modals are clickable, so you can click your business profile or your campaign type to see that information. All right. And with that, I'm going to pass the baton back to Sergey, and he's going to take you through, throughput and fees in regards to after you're registered. Dave, thank you so much. And everybody, who's participating in the webinar. We deliberately went through the process fairly slowly because this is our anticipation that if you have all the information prepped, then it should take you no more than ten to 15 minutes to follow through this process. Even though it takes you ten to 15 minutes to fill out all the information, there's a stop between the business profile and filling out the registration form. Now, the business profile needs to be approved. And then you go through the campaign registration process. So, again those steps that I indicated at the very beginning, one, two, three, and four, this is what we went through in greater detail. So basically, you're telling the carriers who you are. You're telling them exactly where you're going to be sending. Here's how I'm getting the opt-in information, and this is how people can opt out. And this is in this picture, you see everything, combined together, right? Business registration, campaign registry, which basically means you're registering. You're picking your specific use case. And then you get a trust score. At the end of the process, you get a trust score. So what is a trust score? So let's talk about that. So trust score is pretty much equivalent to a throughput. Every time you think of Thrust score, think throughput. And the higher the Thrust score, the better the throughput. Now, you're going to get the best throughput if you are very precise about what exactly you're going to be texting and you're very consistent with the use case that you're going to be selecting. So there are some declared use cases. So if you're going to declare a specific use case your throughput is going to be the best. And these are some of the declared use cases. So if I want to use texting for a two factor authentication or customer care or higher education or marketing then I'm going to pick that use case. Keep in mind that if you're going to be using you're going to pick one use case but going to do completely something else. You're going to mix it with other messages. In other words, utilize the single declared use case for things that are mixed with your trust score or rather you might have some deliverability penalties. Why? Obviously carriers are not looking at every message that you're sending out. However there's an analysis that occurs. There's a sporadic selection of the messages and those messages are basically checked. As Dave said, those messages are checked every 30 days. Where this is more or less true they might get checked more frequently depending on what's going on at any given time. So your random message might get plucked out and just checked against. What exactly did you declare? So if that message is not consistent with what you declared then one, it might not get delivered. Two, you might get penalties across the board from a deliverability perspective and your trust score might be lowered. So just keep that in mind. Now if you know that single use case is not going to suffice for your purposes then you might want to pick a mixed use case. The mixed use case will have a lower throughput, it will have worse deliverability. Not by much but there's definitely some noticeable differences. However you can utilize the mixed use case for the purposes of sending multiple message types. So if you do want customer care messages and you do want some marketing messages going through then a mixed use case is your best choice. Now again, if you are a sole proprietor which basically means and if you don't know who you are then chances are then you're not. Now again, the sole proprietor basically means you have an ean number. An Ean number that's related to taxation. So if your taxes are passed through and you're running your business on your Social Security then you are going to be a sole proprietor. However, if you do have an en number then you don't qualify for a sole proprietor package. Just keep that in mind. So it's an important distinction. Now Sole Proprietor has some severe limitations. You can only have one number on that particular account. Your throughput is fixed and irrespective of your trust score. So regardless of what's going to happen as far as your trust score is concerned that's not going to matter. Your throughput is going to be fixed. And these are the recap of the carrier fees that you're going to see on your invoice. Again, Salesmsg doesn't mark off these fees in any way. These are the fees that all the carriers exact in trying to police the system. So basically, for all the deliverability that carriers are ensuring and all the trafficking and policing that they're doing, these are the fees for the messages that you're going to have to pay. All right, so we're to a Q and A section. So we're going to tag team with Dave to answer some of your questions. And please don't hesitate for your questions in Q and A. and we're going to address those right after we cover everything that we had preceded ahead of time. All right. Is Salesmsg the only company that requires 10DLC. The answer is no. That's an industry wide change. Irrespective of where you go, you're going to have a 10DLC process that you will have to follow. Dave. So I got a rejection. What should I do next? Well, we have some things to look at here. So, on this next slide, you can go right back to the compliance page. And like I said, these modals are clickable, and when you click on one and you're approved, you can review all your information. But if you're rejected, you can update the profile, you can update your campaign and brand so that it is aligned with information that's required to get approved. we go one more slide down, you'll actually see that if you are rejected, our system should realize you're rejected and we'll preemptively reach out to you. And you can follow these prompts to get connected with 10DLC specialists at Salesmsg as quickly as possible. And just a little bit of information provided to the bot up front will help our team, just get to work on where the bottleneck is all the faster. Okay. Will the deadline be extended? So the answer is the deadline won't be and again, this is a reasonable question, and we get asked that all the time. In the past, we saw deadlines being extended and being pushed to the right. That's not going to be the case this time, it has been communicated by all the carriers. The deadline won't be extended and, come August 31, that's the end of the game. If you haven't registered. Is there any way around it? In short, no, there is really no way around it. If you are texting mobile numbers that are in the United States, and you're doing so from a local area code number, you need 10DLC in some way, shape, or form. All right, what if I don't register for 10DLC? So if you don't register for 10DLC, there's only really one option. your only option is to not have a local number. If you remember the table that we had covered, toll free numbers are not under a 10DLC umbrella. Even though they're not under a 10DLC umbrella, their toll free numbers have their own approval process. So it doesn't excuse you from not registering your business through some kind of process. So there's a different process. There's no gap. You could start texting right away. However, that loophole very likely will get closed. So, again, even, if you choose not to register for 10DLC and just get a toll free number and you're going to continue texting on your toll free number, very likely within a couple of months after the , 10DLC deadline, that's going to get closed and you will have to register no matter what. So, again, toll free number, it's not that you can avoid this process altogether. You can avoid the 10DLC process, but there is a separate process just as arduous or just as involved. If you consider what we have gone through, but it's still going to happen, you won't be able to avoid it. Dave what countries does this affect? So, strictly speaking, like I said, this is a United States thing. So if I am a United States organization texting United States customers. I need 10DLC. If I'm a Canadian organization and I'm texting American customers, I still need 10DLC because I'm texting United States numbers. However, if I'm Canadian and I'm only texting other Canadian numbers, well, you may not actually need 10DLC. However, you'll still need something to help deliverability. And usually what we'll recommend is well, you just need to follow the best practices to avoid carrier filtering, which is a lot of what we've already discussed. Sender ID hello, my name is So and So from Such and Such Organization opt-out reminders on the first message and again every 30 days. And then another good option, as Sergey just mentioned, is that verified toll free number. So if you are a Canadian organization, texting other Canadian customers exclusively, the verified toll free line is a very good way to approach it. All right, can I dispute my trust score? So the answer is yes. The best way now to dispute your trust score is not free. However, what we had seen is, or rather, in addition to, what I said, from additional fee that you will have to pay, which is $50, for additional vetting that would occur. What we had seen when the trust score is disputed, it typically gets elevated. So you will get a higher trust score if you dispute it. If you are completely satisfied with your trust score, there's nothing to do. However, if for some reason the trust score is low and we've seen it happen there are a number of different reasons why that could occur. Again, some of the messages that you provided. Are imprecise because there's, various shades of gray in terms of rejection. So some things might not get rejected. However, they will get a low trust score based on the algorithm that, campaign registry is employing in order to create one. So when you do dispute it, you usually get a higher trust score. So just keep that in mind. How do you apply for a higher trust score? As Dave indicated, the best way to do this is through our support. Just contact us and we'll help you navigate this process. Dave okay, so I've applied, but my status shows as rejected. What should I do? So, to harp back to that first question I answered, you would want to get in touch with us to get that very specific reason on why it failed. However, in your UI, where it indicates there is a rejection, there might be a very prescriptive error, and it could tell you exactly why you were rejected. Take a quick look at that and make sure that there's no prescriptive error there, like the opt-in was rejected, or there was a mismatch with your EIN, something like that. But if it just says, hey, there was an error, please retry, or something very generic, you would want to reach out to us so we could do a more in depth investigation and help you, and help you, get re registered. I would say that commonly, it is that EIN and legal business name mismatch, or the opt-in disclosures were not present on the opt-in form. What are the common reasons for rejection? Again, Dave has already gone through it, and again, even though there are a plethora of different rejection codes, typically, here's what we've seen. So your business information you provided is incorrect. So you provided your brand name as opposed to what you have on your tax form. So that's one of the reasons for the records that are being vetted by the campaign registry, there's some inconsistency between your address and your name and your EIN. So they're using a lookup based on your EIN number. If you have provided one, and you have not chosen, Sole Proprietor, they are doing the lookup. And if there's any information that does not match to, really, to, a letter and the dot, then you basically could get rejected. Your business profile could get rejected. So that's one. Now, on the level of campaigns typically following are the rejections that we had seen. So one, you haven't provided sample messages that are consistent with what's expected. So, in other words, you chose the marketing use case, but you're really doing something else. Or you said, I want two-factor authentication, but you're sending marketing messages, so you will very likely get a rejection. So that's one. Number two, you haven't indicated your business name and your simple message so, in other words: Hello, my name is John and I am sending a message from whatever your company is. Again, a lot of times what we have seen is, well, the reasoning goes, I don't send my business name in every message. So, that doesn't seem to make sense, so I'm just not going to indicate it. So include that no matter what. Even if you're not sending your business name every time, that's perfectly fine. What campaign registry wants to see is there's at least, in some instances, that you're providing your business name. So that's two, that's a very common reason why you might get a rejection. Reason number three, you are not collecting the opt-in or you're not indicating a proper place. It's either not reachable when the campaign registry goes to check, that's one. Number two, it's not collected under a security umbrella. So, in other words, you don't have https information in your URL. So the information that's being provided is not encrypted. If that's the case, then you will get an immediate rejection. Another very common reason is you don't have an opt-out language. So if you don't have an opt-out language, then you will not likely, you will for sure get rejected because, again, remember those four points, who you are, what you're sending, how did you get the information, and how can my customers opt out? So those are the main reasons why your campaign or your business profile might get rejected, either missing your inconsistent information or you haven't provided ample clarity, you haven't provided the opt-out or opt-in information. Dave, I've gone through 10DLC registration and let's assume that it's all approved, but I am still having deliverability issues. Why? Well, if we assume that everything was approved here are some of the most common reasons. So, as we've kind of been saying, you have stopped providing that sender ID or that opt-out disclosure. And again, that should be there on the first message to a new contact. Other reasons why you might be having deliverability issues. You might be texting a contact that might have a bad phone number. Right? So you want to check against the do not calls, you want to check against landlines. Thanks, Dave. Again, if you push the boundaries, these boundaries will push back. So keep that in mind. Can I downgrade a standard or low volume package? so the answer is right now there is no downgrade path. So once you have started with a Sole Proprietor, you can actually upgrade to low volume standard or immediately to standard, but you cannot downgrade. So that process currently does not exist. Will it exist in the future? Potentially. Now, again, our recommendation is to actually splurge and go for a standard package because that's going to be the highest deliverability and the highest throughput. And there's a low price to pay for those benefits that you're getting with the standard package. Can I apply for a standard package while on a Sole Proprietor or low volume standard package? And the answer to this is yes, you can upgrade right now in the UI on our website, on the compliance page. That is, if you are approved, there's no upgrade button. So you would want to reach out to us at support@salesmessage.com through the live chat that's available on our website or give us a text just get in contact with us and express a desire to upgrade, and we can help you through that. How will I know that I exceeded my Sole Proprietor or Low Volume Standard package limits? So, we make it really abundantly clear within the application that you are pushing the boundaries. So again, there's throughput or there's some message limits for each particular package. You saw the diagram that basically looks at message volumes to see if you are qualified, including putting a number of numbers because again, the sole proprietor only allows one. So if you get another, that's not going to be covered under a sole proprietor. So in order for you to be able to know that you're actually exceeding those limits, we're making it clear you will see the message within the application telling you that that's the case. Now, also keep in mind, this question comes up, time and time again. Well, what if I have a particular campaign that I pushed out? Then my normal volume is really low, but Christmas season is coming up, the holidays, and I'm going to text more. Now am I immediately going to lose my eligibility for one of the packages? So the answer is no, that's not going to be the case. Even though the limits are reset and they're looked at on a daily basis, the more you push those limits, the more you go beyond what's allowed, the higher the chances that you will get flagged and that's specific that you might get penalties, some of the messages might not get delivered. So that's typically how you're going to see it materialize. And again, if you are constantly pushing against those limits, then your best bet is to connect with us and have us upgrade you to a higher package. Dave, where will I see my 10DLC one-time and recurring fees? So, before you complete the process, we have that disclosure page that tells you this is your one-time and these are going to be your recurring fees. However, there are some pass-through fees that are going to change based on your message volume. So where do I keep an eye on that? Well, that's actually right on your billing overview page in Salesmsg. So every time your carrier fees are due, either they get to a certain threshold and we bill immediately, or if it stays under that threshold for the month, it's just, we charge it as a line item on your subscription. So keep your eyes on your subscription invoices and you'll see it there as well as any payments that are $100. I think it's that $100 mark. If you get to fees that are $100, then we charge right away. But keep in mind, if your carrier fees are getting up to $100, you are a very high volume customer. so if you're keeping your message volumes in about that low volume standard range, you'll probably just keep an eye on your subscription payment. That's pretty much all the questions that we have preceded. Now let's address everything you asked in Chat and Q&A. So, Mima, if you could verbalize those, that would be great. Here's the first one. We're back from week two, still working through our process over here. I know you said you can't initiate opt-in through your Salesmsg text, but can our clients initiate opt-in through their personal text with a form that gives permission? If this is too broad you can message me later. Dave, this is our participant from last week, she had a case where she was representing her clients. Absolutely. Dave, do you want to take this one? No problem. So like you said, you cannot send a text message to someone asking for their permission if it's okay if I text you, right? Because you can't walk into somebody's house and ask if it's okay to come inside. You're already in their living room. but you can entice a contact to text you. And if they communicate with you first, well then of course you can message them back. And that is considered opt-in consent. there is no need to go through the form or go through a QR or anything like that. If they text you, you can text them. However, you do need to keep in mind the sender ID, the opt-out disclosures, that stuff still has to be in your text messages. Personal numbers, if you're using personal numbers, personal numbers are not covered. You're not A2P, then you're P2P. So P2P has a completely different set of regulations and whatnot. So this is only applicable to A2P. So if you are texting using the Salesmsg Application, that basically means you either brought in your number or you purchased a number from us. So if you brought in your number, then it's covered under the umbrella and now it's been hosted by the carriers or you got a number from us, which is definitely under the umbrella of A2P. So again, personal texting from your personal number completely. Do you need to put that aside? This is just applicable to if you're using Salesmsg Application, web or mobile or our extension. So irrespective of what gets used, it gets covered. Do any of these standards change if we only use SMS for non-marketing purposes? I.e., coordinating a service call, so. The answer is no. Again, if you look at the declared use cases, that's one of the umbrellas. So, if you have a specific use case, either a customer support use case, or any other that's declared and we only indicated a few, there's quite a list that covers many different use cases that the industry has seen, and also some specialty use cases. If it's either nonprofit or political, there are specialty use cases. Discover that, too, and there are some additional vetting that might be required. So, if you have a use case, you do want to select it, because, as I mentioned before, that's your best option to get the highest throughput. The closer the use case to what exactly you're doing, the better the throughput and the better deliverability, because it's really clear, again, the mixed use case needs to be policed much better, because, again, you could have all kinds of, the mix of messages that is coming through. So the pipeline that it's traveling through is quite busy. So that's one your throughput is lower and also it needs to be policed on a more frequent basis. So selecting a specific use case, that's your best bet for those messages to be delivered. So deliverability rates are higher and the throughput rates are higher. Thank you. All right, we transferred our number from Kixie to Salesmsg. Can we still register for 10DLC using Salesmsg? So the answer is yes. Now transferring numbers. So if you transfer numbers from one provider to another, you still have to go through this process. So, Campaign Registry, which is the entity that's been set up by the carriers that has the information about your business. So what it needs to do, it needs to connect your business to one specific use case to two, a set of providers that are working with you. In order for that to happen, you need to go through that process again. Even if you're bringing the number over, you need to think about it and also, we didn't include that as a question, which comes up all the time. Now, is 10DLC about numbers or is it about something else? The answer is it's about something else. It's not about the numbers, it's about the business. So the numbers themselves are really incidental. So if you're bringing over the number, it doesn't really matter. So what you're doing is basically you're connecting your business information to your campaign information. The numbers themselves become incidental. So, if you retire one of the numbers or purchase additional numbers, they're going to be covered under that umbrella. Do you need to worry about any additional numbers that you're purchasing? The answer is no. You don't have to go through this process again because really, it's all about the numbers. Sorry, it's about the company. It's about the company and, it's about the use case that you're utilizing. Thank you, David. We need to ensure cell numbers entered in our form are verified as a real number and it's deliverable similar to email verification to kickbox IO. Is there a verification method you suggest? Absolutely. It is a Salesmsg phone checker. And this is a feature that is available to all Salesmsg customers in your organization settings page. Keep in mind, we do charge one cent a lookup, so it's not free. However, it's still cheaper than texting a number that can't receive a message only for you to not only get charged for trying to send the text, but also not deliver a text. So if you're concerned that, well, I have these phone numbers and I'm suspicious that they are not truly mobile numbers, you can run just that list through Phone Checker, you can run just one number through Phone Checker, or you can run your entire contact database through Phone Checker. We really make that up to you. And if you're looking for more specifics on Phone Checker and how it works in all of its ways, our help article on phone checker would be the best place to go. Can I get more examples of opt-in messages? Yeah, absolutely. So, again, follow up with our support and you will see, we'll give you a couple of examples of things that we have seen successful. We're going to publish this webinar, and you can go back and just look at the messages that we see as samples. I'm suspecting that you are asking, based on your particular business, what sort of sample messages or the opt-in opt-out information that you could provide. And we could help you with that. So we could just understand your specific business and make a couple of suggestions. So the best thing to do is really to follow up with our support and we'll give you some help. Amazing. Just finally, they asked if we could share this presentation in PDF format. This presentation, we're going to share the deck and we're also going to share the recording. So, this is going to be in either a PowerPoint or a PDF format, and we're going to publish that. Awesome. That's all I got for now. All right, well, we're almost perfectly at time. So, guys, thank you. Thank you so much for attending the webinar and happy texting. And if you have additional questions, please don't hesitate, follow up with us and we'll help you through this process.\n\nâ"
