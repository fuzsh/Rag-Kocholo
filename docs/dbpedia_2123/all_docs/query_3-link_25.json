        "text": "What does it take to be fully prepared for something? Well, it is hard to be prepared for everything, if not even impossible. The reason for that is that you can be prepared for a structure, a strategy, a question list, etc. You can do a lot of research and make multiple plans but in the end it all comes down to the good old trusting in yourself. My wife is currently preparing for a TOEFL test and she asked me how to prepare for it. I told her that she can prepare by reading old toefl tests (from 2023) to get a hang of the structure. To practice her speaking by recording herself and timing herself. To practice her reading by reading academic posts and newspapers. To practice her listening by watching English lectures, series or movies (and to make notes so she can use it to write a summary of it and use it to talk about it for a minute straight as well). Outside of that, I revised her grammar and taught her some new vocabulary. Whilst all of this might prepare her for what's to come, in the end it will still come down to herself and how she performs during the test. Will she pass, will she freeze, we will find out, all I know is that she's almost fully prepared for the test and should be able to get a high score if she remains calm and focused. How do you prepare for something? #toefl #preparation #business #thebusinessdevil #thebusinessdevilinkorea\n\nTOEFL Edition Sentence with One Clause 1. Skill 1: Be sure the sentence has a subject and a verb. The most common types of problems you will encounter in TOEFL structure questions involve subjects and verbs: maybe it lacks a subject or verb, or both, or maybe the sentence has an extra subject or verb. A SENTENCE IN ENGLISH MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE SUBJECT AND ONE VERB. 2. Skill 2: Be careful of object of prepositions. A preposition is followed by a noun, pronoun, gerund, or noun clause called an object of the preposition. If a word is an object of a preposition, it is not the subject. An object of a preposition can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because it can be mistaken for the subject of a sentence. 3. Skill 3: Be careful of appositives An appositive noun comes before or after a noun and is generally set off from the noun with commas. If a word is an oppositive, it is not the subject. The following appositive structures are both possible in English. 4. Skill 4: Be careful of present participles A present participle is the -ing form of the verb. The present participle can be (1) part of the verb or (2) an adjective. It is part of the verb when accompanied by some form of the verb be. It is an adjective when it is not accompanied by some form of the verb be. 1) The man is standing in the corner 2) The man standing in the corner was naughty 5. Skill 5: Be careful of past participles A past participle often ends in -ed, but there are also many irregular past participles. For many verbs, including -ed verbs, the simple past and the past participle are the same and can be easily confused. The -ed form of the verb can be (1) the simple past, (2) the past participle of a verb, or (3) an adjective. 1) He painted this picture. 2) He has painted this picture. 3) The picture painted by Jack is now in a museum.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gi8Rk4sJ If you are getting started with your TOEFL preparations, my first suggestion is to take a complete practice exam now so that you can start getting familiar with the variety of questions in each section and also know your initial level. Your initial level is like a starting point or point of origin on a GPS mapping tool. Along with your target score, you can figure out the distance between those two points or how long it might take to prepare or how fast you need to go to reach your target score. The time it takes to reach a destination can vary greatly if you decide to walk, to bike, to drive, or to fly. In terms of preparing for an exam such as the TOEFL, the results can vary quite a lot if you can only study for 1 hour a month, 1 hour a week, or 1 hour a day, etc. Your availability, work and family responsibilities, and other commitments can significantly affect how much time and effort you can dedicate to your exam preparations. Many students overestimate how much time they can realistically dedicate to preparing for the TOEFL.

Consistent practice wins. Remember, only 13% of TOEFL test-takers are in the 26+ club. Here's how they do it and you can too: Structure: Structure your responses to each task with a clear beginning, middle, and end, ideally dividing your response into three equal parts (1/3 - 1/3 - 1/3). This helps ensure coherence and completeness. Practice with a timer to simulate test conditions. For more details on this approach, Google \"John Healy Grid.\" Content: Using transition words like \"first\" and \"second\" helps organize your thoughts and makes your speech flow more naturally. I suggest memorizing transition \"master-phrases\" to use during the test. For instance, in Task 3, you can use: \"The professor in the lecture expounds on this concept by providing a couple of specific examples.\" Feedback: Get instant data from tools like My Speaking Score or TOEFL¬Æ TestReady‚Ñ¢ to receive precise feedback on your TOEFL Speaking performance. These tools help you estimate your score today, and identify areas for improvement, allowing you to iterate, experiment, and improve continuously.\n\nüì¢ Calling all educators and students preparing for the TOEFL exam! üåü As an experienced and ETS-certified TOEFL preparation teacher, I wanted to share some valuable tips that can help you crack the TOEFL exam with confidence. üí™ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Familiarize yourself with the exam format: Understanding the structure of the TOEFL exam is crucial for effective preparation.
