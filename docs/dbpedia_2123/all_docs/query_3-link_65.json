        "text": "I'd like to move photos into separate folders I created and only see them in that folder. Example: Label one folder \"Family Photos\" and move all family related photos into that folder and another folder \"Friends Photos\" and move all related friends photos into that folder so on etc.. (1) How do you do that on iMac 24? (2) How do I open 2 folders side by side to drag/drop? (3) Or what is the iMac 24 equivalent? (All of the above could be done easily with the click of a mouse on Windows PC. The Magic Mouse not so magic.)\n\n(To be clear: I have never had a Mac before. I have the iMac 24. In a lot of cases directions for Mac are sometimes different from iMac 24. Which makes everything even more difficult. Web searches mostly come up with no answers for the iMac 24. Apple's own pages lack info on the iMac 24. I have had Windows PC's for the last 30 years. I am used to Windows PC. It's what I know.) I don't miss Windows PC and Am grateful to have this iMac 24 BUT..\n\nExample: Windows PC, Photos, right click create folders, name said folders, open 2 folders side by side, highlight photos you want to move, drag photos into the other folder, drop photos into that folder (drag/drop or copy/paste) and you are done. Simple, fast, easy.\n\nAs far as Apple lingo I don't yet know the difference between albums and folders. I do know that after I finally figured out how to create folders (yes, folders not albums) on the iMac 24 and learned how to move them. I got them in the new folder but they are also still ALL bunched up in the other folder or Photo app. I am an extremely organized person. I cannot have my pictures all bunched up together all over the place (I will never find anything like that). It makes zero sense to me.\n\nEverything with Apple seems to be harder than it needs to be. We are not all high tech knowing. The direction are written in Apple lingo with an assumption everyone knows the lingo. If you've never had one before it's overwhelming, frustrating, confusing, and down right ridiculous. I am actually regretting my iMac 24 purchase.\n\nSearching this community has left me with more questions than answers so far. The info is either out of date info, wrong info or missing info. Or you ask about an iMac 24 and are given info for iPhone, iPad or Mac (somethings are different from Mac vs iMac 24). Don't get me wrong I am thankful but does it really have to be this difficult to get the right answers without paying a high price. There is a huge difference being used to Windows for years vs new to Apple and it feels like being left out in the cold. At the very least maybe this will help others who feel like I do.\n\n{My questions are at the top.} Thank you for your time!\n\nI, too, want my pictures by year, so my sidebar looks like this:\n\nBecause I'm old, my folders go by decades, and the decade folder have folders by years. Year folders have folders by month or albums by date or event-- whatever seems right. Names of my folders and albums start with the year then month then day (if appropriate) so that they can alphabetize by date. In Photos, folders can have folders and albums, but not pictures. Pictures are in albums.\n\nBut a big advantage to Photos is that pictures can be in more than one album. Albums don't contain pictures-- albums are lists of pictures that you like to see together, so a picture can be in three different albums but not occupy any more space. So I also have albums that don't go by date:\n\nI can see all the astronomy pictures together-- pictures from Astronomy Picture of the Day or pictures that I've taken can mix together without being connected to a date. Pictures of Jeff or Barbara are collected together even if they were taken years apart. But those pictures are also in the albums by date. Or, if they have flowers in them, then they might be in one of the Flowers albums in the Flowers folder in the Albums not years folder.\n\nI also have a folder of old family pictures that have folders for Scans of pages of old photo albums, and pictures sorted by family names.\n\nI have Smart Albums, as 1BirchView suggests, like the one that collects all the pictures of my Father in date order (as well as I can figure.) Some, of course, have pictures of my Mother, but I have another album of her in date order-- so some pictures are in both. I have pictures with family and friends together, so I can't think of a Family album that's really separate from a Friends album.\n\nTo help collecting pictures together, I add keywords to pictures. And I don't really \"move\" a picture from one album to another, because a picture can be in both. I do use an \"Album not any\" Smart Album to make sure everybody gets sorted. I also have empty caption and no title smart albums to check on those.\n\nThere's lots of experience here of people who have lots of pictures. Let us know if you have other questions.\n\nI am assuming your photos are in the Photos app on your Mac and not just in one big folder on your hard drive. Photos in an app that comes with your Mac and is used to organize photos. It will also sync to your other Apple devices so all your photos are available on all your devices.\n\nThe folders you want to create in Photos are called Albums. However, you can create a folder and put multiple albums into a folder if you want. For example, I have a folder in Photos called \"2023\" and inside that folder I have 12 albums, \"January 2023\", \"February 2023\", \"March 2023\", etc. To each their own but it works for me.\n\nI am unaware if you can have windows side by side in Photos. I don't think so. But you could have open pictures in one album and drag the files into a second closed album. Alternatively, you could highlight the pictures that you want to add to an album, right-click on them, choose \"Add To,” and then choose the album you want to add those pictures to.\n\nOne strategy is creating all the albums up front and then dragging and dropping your photos into the various albums. I know you said it is unimportant, but a photo can belong to more than one album if you want it to."
