        "text": "Overview\n\nHey everyone, thanks for joining us today. We'll get started in just a couple of minutes, so we'll give a couple more minutes to let any late stragglers join, and then we'll get into it. Also, my name is Lucas. I'm going to be hosting BioRender 101 today along with my colleague Jerry. You might show up as Shiz Aoki when he's talking, but it is Jerry. We'll get to the introduction shortly, though. Thanks. We can probably get started now. Looks like most people who registered for it are here, so we'll get right into it. Thanks, everyone, again, for joining us today. As I said earlier, my name is Lucas. I'm an account executive here at BioRender, and this is BioRender 101: Improving Your Communication with Visuals.\n\nâ\n\nSo, quick bit of housekeeping before we get into it. If you do have any questions throughout this presentation, feel free to type them into the chat or the Q&A section. If you are sending a chat, please ensure you select \"send chat to all panelists and attendees.\" If you have a thought or comment, it's pretty likely someone else on the webinar also does, so please do share it with the attendees as well to ensure we're not overlapping too much. We definitely want to keep this as interactive as possible, so please ask away. On today's webinar, we'll cover, first of all, a brief introduction to the BioRender platform. You'll learn who we are, how we came to be, why we're doing this, and then we'll get into a demo. Before we do so, maybe we can launch a quick poll. Jerry, are you able to watch that?\n\nâ\n\nJerry: Sure, let me try that one right now. It should be launched. Yeah, just a couple of questions about what area of research you're in and whether or not you've used BioRender before, just so we can tailor it accordingly. I think while the poll runs, we can probably move ahead to intros, and we can probably look back to the poll a few slides in.\n\nâ\n\nA bit about ourselves: like I said, my name is Lucas. I studied molecular biology and genetics at the University of Guelph here in Ontario, Canada. Like I said, I'm an account executive here now. I work with a lot of our academic and industry customers to help bring BioRender to their institutions. I'm also on the call with my colleague Jerry. Jerry, maybe you can give an introduction. Sure, my name is Jerry. I come from an academic background in Biochemistry. I did my Master's there at the University of Toronto, and after that, I followed up with another kind of professional pursuit, I guess, in biomedical communications, which is illustrations, design and animations for scientific topics. Here at BioRender, I lead our scientific content team where we create all kinds of different templates and figures to help speed up our user base processes and making figures. I also do a bit of user experience consultation here as well for the platform.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhere are we at on the poll? I think we're good to take a look. Awesome. Yeah, so it looks like, yeah, looks like for today, we have a pretty good spread of attendees across different fields. Definitely always a solid representation in molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, Immunology, but interesting today we have a lot of attendees in biomaterials and biotech fields which is pretty cool. And in terms of everyone's collective experience with BioRender before, looks like the vast majority of our attendees today are an even split between those that have used BioRender only once or twice or those who have an account now but are, I guess, excited to get into it with our demo today being the primer. Thanks, everyone.Â\n\nâ\n\nSo, if you're like most of the other scientists that I speak to, you probably don't love putting together figures for your presentations. You'll spend weeks or months or maybe even years working on a project, gathering your data, putting it all together, and then when it comes time to actually present it either in a conference or in a publication, you fire up PowerPoint and you make something that looks like this. You know, it might look fairly elementary, but I'm sure all of you, if you've ever had to make something like this, and I'm sure you realize just what a pain something like this can actually be to make, and what a time-suck it is as well. Not to mention, it's really difficult to make something that actually looks good in PowerPoint or Illustrator. If you've got the design chops, you know, maybe you pulled together some pieces off Google and layer in your own shapes and squiggles over it, as is the case with this figure, but that causes a whole bunch of different issues with, you know, usage rights or you know maybe you're just using a graphic that's been with your group or team so long that no one really knows who made it or where it comes from. Many of the scientists that I speak with will actually tell me that they will outright avoid using a figure at all in their presentation if a suitable one doesn't already exist.Â\n\nâ\n\nNo one really wants to spend hours in PowerPoint making a figure like this when they could be spending that time actually doing research, digging through their data, or reading new literature. We actually estimate that scientists collectively waste over a billion hours per year making scientific figures, and software that just really isn't designed for doing so - things like PowerPoint or Illustrator or Inkscape. Now, a billion hours is obviously a huge amount of time, time that could definitely be spent on better, more productive things, and so we knew that there had to be a better way. And so with that in mind, we created Biorender to make it easy for all scientists, regardless of artistic ability, to create professional, repeatable graphics in literally a couple of minutes. We've got a library of over 40,000 and growing scientifically accurate icons that you can just search through, drag, drop, move around and make beautiful figures like you see here, or something that looks like this, all in again, literally a few minutes. And I mean beyond the time savings and actually making the figure, it also really helps to create a standard and consistent visual language of the research being done at your company or group or lab or institute. It doesn't matter who is making the figure, a dendritic cell is going to look like a dendritic cell across the whole group, and you can just take a quick glance at the figure and understand what's going on in a couple of seconds.Â\n\nâ\n\nHere's another really frequent use case I'm seeing, graphical protocols. It makes it really easy for a new scientist or even just someone unfamiliar with the protocol you use to take a quick look, understand what the process is like, and follow it to a T. Like I said, this is especially helpful for new scientists but could really be used across the board. Now when I talk to most people, when they think \"where am I going to be using figures?\", a lot of people just think of presentations, publications, and posters. I think that's probably because, again, people avoid using figures now or making figures now just because it's such a pain. But we actually see people using Biorender figures in a whole bunch of different ways that they wouldn't have used before, and we didn't necessarily think of or expect people to use them. So things like whiteboarding, grant proposals is a huge one, lab and team meetings is actually our biggest one. And then one other really interesting one I'm seeing a lot of right now is email updates. Anchoring discussion around a central figure over email really helps to keep everyone on the same page and in understanding, especially right now with everyone working from home. These are just a couple of examples of where I've seen people use BioRender, but really anywhere you can use a figure to help explain a scientific concept, you can probably use Biorender to make it a bit easier. One quick last story here just to kind of close out this portion of the webinar, just to really drive home what an impact graphics can have on a publication. So this story came out of the University of Toronto. We were working, or we heard.\n\nâ\n\nThis is from a researcher who reached out to us to tell us about it because it was so amazing. She submitted this illustration to a publication to Immunity. One month, the editor came back to her and said, \"you know, this is great science. We want to publish this, but we can't publish it with this figure you've submitted,\" that's this figure on the left here, \"which in her words took about 10 hours to create in PowerPoint.\" So the editor said, \"you know, we can't publish it with this figure. It's not very clear, it's really messy, doesn't look that great. Resubmit the publication with a new figure and we can publish it.\" Then now, this was about two weeks before the deadline. I don't know about you, but it's often very tough to find 10 hours in any two-week span. not to mention she might not have had the ability to actually create a better figure because, again, if she's anything like me, she's definitely not an artist. So thankfully, one of her graduate students was familiar with BioRender, created this image in the middle here, which in their words took about 10 minutes to create. They resubmitted the figure with this new publication that very same week, and not only were they accepted for that month, they were actually given the cover for that month's issue. It's kind of a crazy turnaround from being rejected for a journal to being given the highest honor in any given month. It's a really, really crazy story, one that we love to hear, and you know, really keeps us going. Hope that we'll hear some similar stories coming out of some of you as well.\n\nâ\n\nSo that kind of wraps up the background portion and we can jump into the actual platform now. Before we do so, does anyone have any questions? I'm going to pause here to check the chat or Q&A. No questions so far. Thanks, Lucas, for this really great introduction. Perfect, and no problem. Great, so let's jump into it then. If you are new to BioRender or maybe have just signed up, this is what you'll see when you go to sign in. It might look a bit different if you have access through your company or university or institution. We do have kind of custom login screens, and we do offer group plans as well, but for the most part, this is kind of what you'll see. I'll just hit login, and here we are, we are on the platform.\n\nâ\n\nJust a couple kind of bits of housekeeping to orient you here. It might kind of be a bit reminiscent of Google Drive. Basically, across the top are two different ways to start a new illustration, either from blank or with a template. In this main area here, the gallery, if you will, you can see all the images that I've created in the past. It's quite comprehensive, very, I think this might give you a pretty good idea of just how wide-ranging the areas of science we cover are. Along the side here, I mean, you have folders so you can organize the figures you create, and then one big thing as well is the team gallery. So basically, you're able to set up a team when you sign up, and you can share images across your team. So if it's other people in your lab that are using the same kind of figures, you may want to share this figure with my team so they can use it as well. I just go click these three dots here, hit share with team, and you can see now it's got this little icon in the top left, and if I go to my team gallery on this left side here, it now shows up here, and anyone else in my lab or team is able to use that as a really great starting point. So again, just back to that notion of creating a standard visual language used across your group, this really makes it easy if you are a PI with multiple grad students, for example, having all your grad students use the same icons to represent the same things, you can just take a quick glance, understand what's going on in seconds. We'll go back to my illustrations. Like I said, two ways to get started. I'll really quickly show you some of the templates. Many people prefer to get started with a template because we've done 90% of the work. These templates are all fully editable. For example, if I want to get started with this one, which is one I showed in the earlier section, I can just hit \"Use Template\". Every piece of this is editable, so if it's not exactly what you want, you can make those edits entirely. I'll actually go back to my gallery and start from a blank illustration for the purposes of this demo.\n\nâ\n\nI am going to call this my first illustration. You can see by my gallery it is not, but I can change the name and size later, so I'm not too concerned about that. Create illustration, perfect, and here we are. I'm actually going to add some grid lines. A couple things to get oriented here: this white area is the canvas. This is what will show up when you go to actually export your figures. Anything that hangs outside of the bounds of this white area will not show up, so it makes it really helpful to add things on the side for inspiration or gives you a little work area outside of what will actually show up when you go to export the figure.\n\nâ\n\nA couple other small things: I mean we can add a grid line if you like to keep things very aligned. I will turn it off for now, across this left side here are all of our primary tools, and then across the top bar are more utility tools and contextual tools that will show up depending on what I have selected. So I'll show you what that means in a second, but the main part is what's going on on this left side here, which is our library of icons. Like I said, we have over 40,000 icons and growing. You're actually able to request custom icons through our \"Request a Custom Icon\" modal. If we don't have something you're looking for, you're able to hit that button, tell us what you need, send it off to our illustrators, and they will create it for you. I should mention that's a feature of BioRender Premium, the paid version, but we do have a pretty comprehensive library already, so for the most part, you should be able to find stuff.\n\nâ\n\nAll of our icons are fully categorized, so I can browse through the categories. I'll go through the phospholipid bilayer. Let's pull this one out. I'm going to expand it a bit. I'll actually shrink it a little bit from there. Perfect. I'm going to be using a couple of hotkeys. It's kind of just in line with the hotkeys you'll find in other software. So Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, or Command+C, Command+V to copy and paste. As a side note as well, you can actually click this button in the bottom right here to show all the shortcuts. So if you want to be kind of a power user, if you will, I recommend using hotkeys as much as possible. Just again, shaving seconds off every little task adds up to a lot in the long run. Awesome.\n\nâ\n\nSo, you can see I've got kind of the start of a cell-to-cell interaction. If any of you have created something like this in PowerPoint, you probably would have painted it to do. Circle, two lines, copy-paste, copy-paste. Making a phospholipid bilayer arc is probably one of the hardest things to do, and yet everyone has to do it a lot. So you can already see the time savings that'll come. Like I said, the icons are categorized, but they are also all searchable. I'll searchâ¦ maybe I want a receptor. Here let's do an MHC complex. Maybe we want one. Yeah, let's do this one. And actually, this brings up a good point or something to note here, I will pull out a different receptor to show you the difference. This receptor has a blue bounding box around it, which means it's a simple icon or a single icon that can't be edited beyond color options, size, opacity, and cropping. For the most part, that icon is as is.\n\nâ\n\nThis icon, the MHC2 TCR complex, has a purple bounding box around it, which means it's a grouped icon. I can edit each individual part of it. I can change its color and move its parts around. If I wanted to move it slightly to the right, I can do so, and it still moves together as one. Across this top bar is the contextual toolbar. If I select something, a whole bunch of other options come up. Let's change some colors to make it more cohesive visually. I'll change the colors to blue and purple, respectively. Then, I'll do some resizing to make it more accurate from a scientific standpoint. Let's add a couple more things in. Maybe we want a nucleus here. I'll drag a nucleus in here and put it in the bottom corner. Now, let's show a protein in the cytosol. I'll insert a text in shape. Maybe we call it Protein A, and maybe it's got a phosphate attached to it. So, I'll do another text and shape here. I'm going to shrink this down, hold shift to keep the proportions right, and change the color presets to yellow to show that it has a phosphate group. One really cool feature is the favorites feature. If this is a protein that I use frequently, or that other people in my lab use frequently, I will group it together, and then add it to my favorites. Now, when I hit that favorite button in the top bar, I can easily access it.\n\nâ\n\nAlso, right click it and favorite. One thing you might notice about BioRender is that there are often multiple ways to do something. But you can see it popped up in my favorites section here, and now I can just drag it out as a single icon. So, again, really trying to shave seconds and minutes off every little task so you can spend more time doing research. On top of that, I can also share this icon with my team. So, if it was very complex, maybe an entire pathway I've created, I can just share it with my team, and if I toggle between personal and team, other people on my team are able to use this as well. Again, creating that kind of standard visual language, everyone in the lab using the same icons to represent the same things and last time really makes it easy to save you time and keep things consistent. I'm going to pause there, see if we do have any questions. Doesn't look like it to me. So, I'm actually going to now, maybe this is kind of where I want to stop, or stop for now, and I want to send it to Jerry to keep things going or make his edits to it. Let's say you're the PI and you want to put down some of the essential things, and you're like, okay, I'm going to send it to my postdoc now too. You can see here in the, oh, and also as a side note, you can see when I was mentioning things that overhang, don't show up. If I go to preview, you can see none of the stuff outside of the yellow or white canvas is showing up. But yeah, I'll go to share this with Jerry. Jerry, what's the email you're using? Is it webinar@BioRender.com? Thank you, webinar@BioRender.com. Perfect, I will send this off, and I'm going to stop sharing my screen so Jerry can share his, and he'll show you what that looks like on his end.\n\nâ\n\nLooking at where Lucas left off here, I'm going to make a few changes. First of all, with this receptor, I'm just going to make it a bit smaller. Obviously, the transmembrane domains here should go through probably most of the phospholipid bilayer, but we'll revisit that in a bit. Going back to here, I'm just going to change the nucleus color to match the color theme of the cell and maybe situate it a little bit this around here so that the story still has a nice top-down, left-to-right flow, which is a good reading flow. You want to guide the reader's audience to the story you're trying to tell, but just having the nucleus take a little bit more space here so that maybe this is an antigen-presenting cell on the top that's causing a signaling cascade in the recipient cell here below. So, I'm going to pop some DNA into the nucleus. If you have objects in a signaling pathway like this and they're on top of a colored background, always be sure to change the colors so that they don't exactly match up with the same color as a background. That way, they stand out, and they don't kind of blend into the background. Maybe Factor B binds to DNA and causes expression of a certain gene there, and yeah, we'll customize a little bit. You can add line fades like this, but in this case, let's just keep it solid. You can change arrow heads and tails, switch them if you want, and even arrow types. In this case, though, maybe the arrowhead is a little bit too fat. So, I'm going to scale it down to 50 size. It's a little bit too small now, maybe 70 percent. Perfect, and back to color presets, let's go with something a bit more striking. Yeah, let's go with this purple and tone it down a little bit. Perfect, and now just to connect everything, we're going to add a few more arrows. Arrows are super important, of course, in most scientific figures, and that's why we have a big emphasis on them. I'm going to drag this out like so, and I'm going to zoom in a little bit. To zoom in, you can of course use the right-hand side here, but you can also click hotkeys to hold down control on PC or command on your Mac and use your scroll wheel on your mouse, and that way you can kind of quickly zoom in where you want. You can see here it's got some notes, and what do they do? They allow you to make some very quick adjustments in terms of how you want the object, the arrow to curve, like so. I'll duplicate that again, holding the ALT key and duplicate, and in this case, it's going to curve around a little bit more like so, and maybe for the last part here, I'm going to duplicate again and this arrow will indicate this translocation of factor B into the nucleus. In this case, I wanted to kind of bend to the side and then down, so these white nodes in between the blue nodes here for arrows allow you to add additional nodes like this, and that's looking pretty good, I think.Â\n\nâ\n\nLet's say if you accidentally added a couple of extra nodes and now the air is looking janky, how do you remove those? Simple, just right-click on them, delete node like so. Another really cool feature we actually added a while ago that I'm happy to demonstrate here because a funny story, a lot of practically no one in BioRender that actually knew about this feature either until recently because it was a hidden feature that I guess was added some time ago to the arrow system, but none of us actually got to try it even though it existed, is the ability to draw and expand the line easily. So I'm going to duplicate this arrow here, and you know you can let's say if I want to make it a bigger arrow that has a few different kinks and curvatures, you know the one way to do it I'm going to make a couple of copies is to make it longer like this and then just use those white nodes in between and kind of add those nodes and you know curve the thing as you wish or we can also do actually in BioRender at least it's start from an end so hold down Alt key on your keyboard and just drag and then let go and then drag again, and that allows you to basically very quickly draw out any shape you want, and this is actually especially useful for when you want something a bit more schematic, for instance. In fact, if you want to show a pathway or a certain protocol where you have arrows going all over the place and you want them to be a bit cleaner, so let's go with this straight rounded corner arrow type like so. This allows you to have all straight lines, but it allows you to kind of curve the corners like this using this curvature node. What you can do now is using the same technique, hold down Alt key, and now you can start drawing out all different crazy kinds of pathways. In this case, in fact, if you want to draw certain custom shapes, this is a great way to do it. So I'm going to draw it all the way around and actually connect it here. It's going to be a little bit janky, but bear with me here. Voila, and now this is actually a shape. You can use these to a full advantage if, for instance, you want some certain customized shape or line or arrow type that's fairly complex, this will save you a ton of time.\n\nâ\n\nSo I think at this point, I'm going to talk a little bit and actually walk a few steps back and briefly touch on again about the phospholipid bilayers. I actually hinted this already with the DNA, so we obviously have these DNA icons here that are static or that's our simple icons. So, you know, you can resize them, you can change the colors, opacity, flip them, etc., crop them. But these ones are brushes, and in fact, there is a dedicated brush tab here. If you go here on the left-hand side, you can see our full array of dynamic editable brush-based icon libraries, and we categorize them neatly into these sections so that you can find what you need easily. So, there are cell brushes for when you need to draw out, for instance, epithelial layers and customize their shapes so that they tell your story better. We have bacterial membrane brushes here, we have phospholipid membrane brushes that are vesicles, so they're enclosed, and you can show tracking of things themselves, and of course, the default membrane brushes. So these are kind of denoting surfaces of cells, we have nuclear acid brushes, one of which you've seen earlier, this one, but obviously RNA as well and simplified.\n\nâ\n\nVersions without the tick marks as well as nucleosomes that have the histones attached to the strands of nucleic acid. Lastly, we even have a few vessel brushes for those of you who work with visualizing the cardiovascular system. This is a great set of brushes that those users love. Going back to membrane brushes, let's say in this case, I want something a bit more customized for a certain reason. For instance, I can go with this one, which falls under the ballet brush vesicle. I can drag it out as you can see here. It's an interesting starting point, not quite exactly fitting to this figure, but we'll make it work. I'm going to click this background here, unlock it, and move it aside. Let's get to work here. I'm going to move it up to the top position, and because it's got all these command nodes that allow me to adjust it, I'll go to the end and just drag that out. Nice and easy, make sure it's flat, and voila! Because it's a bit thin right now, I'm going to go to brush options and just scale it up. Maybe 234 is perfect. In fact, it's even more perfect than the fossil layer before because this allows the transmembrane domain to be fully passing through the layer. I'm going to right-click and arrange this to send to back so that the receptors are on top, and I'm just going to change the icon color to something more like blue. Perfect. In this case, if you want to add a background element, it's not too difficult. You can just drag out a shape here in our shape menu. You might want to actually go with a polygon tool, so custom shape, drag that out, and just quickly adjust the nodes to fit the background. We'll arrange and put this to the back. A couple of small things here include adding a couple of nodes so that it tucks nicely behind the membrane. We'll just quickly remove the fill and border color. There we go. We're always constantly trying to improve and add additional capabilities to our app. When we do utilize the powerful brush tools, sometimes the backgrounds get a little janky. Thank you for understanding as we try to tackle all these visualization challenges so that it'll make it easier for everyone as we develop this tool further. Awesome. Any questions? I haven't been looking at the Q&A until now. One attendee asks, \"Please elaborate on how to illustrate metabolic pathways using the battery app.\" Very good question. To answer that question, I think I'll have to defer a little bit to the template library because probably the easiest way for any of our users to start a figure is to start from the template library. Currently, we have about six to seven hundred templates in the library covering a wide range of topics. Our goal is to expand that as much as we can so everyone in almost every scenario can find something that they can start a figure with and save them half the time, maybe 90% of the time, in the future. In terms of metabolic pathways, maybe I'll just type in the search bar. We do have a few interesting templates that can get you started here. For instance, cellular respiration with the Krebs cycle, Warburg effect might be a good one. We also might have, for instance, citric acid cycle. Probably the easiest way is to search for a particular template topic and see if something works for you. If the content doesn't really work for you, a great way is to navigate through the library and look for certain layouts. There might be a particular metabolic pathway, a particular pathway layout that could work for you by substituting out certain content.\n\nâ\n\nOh, there we go. Let's say this is roughly the kind of pathway you're looking for in terms of the structure of the layout, but the content is all different. So what you can do is just use that as a template, basically. This is as if you are starting off a new illustration, except you know a lot of things are already made, so you can go in and I'm going to Ctrl + A here to select everything and show you all of these are literally just objects in PowerPoint that you can edit. So, you know, you can feel free to cut out certain steps or modify text or move things around, or maybe even open up another illustration and just copy pieces of this over so that you can finish your own figure. Hope that answers the question.\n\nâ\n\nCool. Going back to our demo illustration then, just a couple of, I guess, last tips here. Not really pertaining to any hard features or environment in particular, but more in terms of how you can best communicate your science using figures. A cool thing I'll always encourage is, you know, to help readers of your content, guide them along. So, for text shapes going down, again, you can always add in these number labels, for instance, and duplicate them and, you know, change the numbers, of course. And maybe, you know, on the side, you can add some description a little bit smaller to help annotate your figures.\n\nâ\n\nAnother interesting feature you can add into a lot of figures actually is to give a bit more context. So, in this case, you know, it's two cells interacting leading to a signaling cascade, and a cool, engaging way to make that stand out even more is to, you know, for instance, drop in a little, kind of, inset shape box here in a corner. Maybe I'll make the fill color, like, slightly off-white, like so. Perfect. And maybe I'll round the corner a little bit and just drop in, for instance, ABC antigen presenting cell, and let's say T-cell, like so, and you know, add some labels. Oops, that one goes behind. I'm going to use a hotkey again, which, you can all learn from the keyboard shortcuts. Label them and maybe add another small orientation thing to indicate where this is happening, change the filter to transparent, border color to black, and there you go.\n\nâ\n\nThrough preview that just anchors the illustration a little bit more, gives readers a bit more context. You can obviously add a bit more background information here as text as well. Another question from Richard in the Q&A section, \"Are the templates generated from other users or from BioRender staff? Do we choose to make our own templates public or not?\" Excellent question. All templates in the button templates Library tab here are designed or at least curated by our in-house science design team. The vast majority are basically designed from scratch. Basically, we have an in-house team who do all the research and generate these figures using BioRender, as well, of course, as though, you know, they're just making the figures, and then we really try to refine the design and make them as cohesive as possible in terms of design and aesthetic standards, and we publish them. A certain number of these templates in our template Library are collaborations with content experts who are external to BioRender.\n\nâ\n\nFor instance, \"Effective response induced by second-order cytokines.\" This is a figure where we collaborated with two professors from Yale University, Akiko Iwasaki, and they helped us vet the content, and we're very grateful for that. So we do have a lot of these content expert connections as well to help make certain templates, make sure they're scientifically accurate as much as they can be. Hope that answers the question.\n\nâ\n\nOh, actually, just to add on to it, if you make a figure and you set it as my template, so for instance, this figure, I'm like, \"This is perfect. I'm going to make it a template.\" So, if I open it up again, and in the file drop down here, I can call it, \"Save as template.\" Maybe this is something we can improve in terms of the text copy, but it's absolutely confidential, so it'll be exclusive to your own account. It'll just be under \"My templates,\" and the only distinction here is that now, this figure has a copy here that allows you to, boom, just click it and make a copy that's editable for yourself.\n\nâ\n\nIf anyone is interested and makes a template that you feel like or makes a figure rather that you feel like you're really open to us adding to our public template library for all boundary users feel free to drop us a line and, you know, our you can click chat here and you know bring it up with our excellent support team and they'll connect with my team and we'll be happy to maybe work out the collaboration. It's really cool whenever we do that, we have maybe a small subset of our template library that are just our users who are researchers who, you know, notice that we don't have a template they made a figure themselves in BioRender and they're like, \"Can you just publish that too for others in my field?\" And we're happy to oblige and, you know, make a few refinements to design to make it cohesive with the rest of the library and publish it and credit them, of course.Â\n\nâ\n\nSo yeah, great question. I think we'll probably wrap up in terms of the core demo here. If you have any questions at all about really anything about the platform, feel free to reach out and contact either via email or in-app if you've signed up already, with the chatbox in the bottom right, as you remember earlier in our demo. Yeah, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're running up on time. Hope this was a good showcase and a helpful showcase for you to kickstart your first illustrations in BioRender and kickstart, hopefully, an illustrious journey in science communication to help with your research.\n\nâ"
