        "text": "As you read in our last post, we recently replaced a key member on three days’ notice and the resulting tour went off pretty much without a hitch. Actually, a new sound and feel was injected into the violin and harmonies which gave our songs new life. This ability to swap people in has been key to the longevity of the band, and we now effectively have two functioning units, with the SSB (drums) and I traveling to either North America or UK/Europe and picking up three stragglers to play gigs.\n\nBut this got me thinking: how many members do you have to swap out before it’s no longer the same band? And this thought has given me a kind of insane idea. Wait until you hear it.\n\nAnyway, in my line of work, we talk about this sort of problem a lot, in between changing the oil and replacing the bolts and washers on the Philosophy Machines down at the Philosophy Factory where I work. So there was this boat, in like, ancient times or whatever. The “Ship of Thesus”. And they kept replacing its parts when they became unusable, and eventually all of the parts had been replaced. But was it still the same ship as when it first sailed?\n\nAnd obviously, the answer is: “oh my god, who cares, can you eggheads try to think about something useful for a change, like solving climate change or curing cancer?” To which my response is: no, fuck you, I managed to scam my way into a career where people pay me to think abstractly about boat repair, you’re just jealous. Nyah.\n\nAnyway, the point is that whether we are the same band or not in our different guises, this member-replacement thing allows us to play way more shows than we otherwise would, because jobs and families and lives and stupid COVID keep lots of us from being able to just go anywhere. But still, every year we get about 40 requests from people in like Brazil, Slovenia, Greece and even Texas, to come and play some gig or festival or whatever and we have to turn them down. This is a lot of people who don’t get to see us who clearly want to, for some completely mysterious reason.\n\nI’m getting sick of saying no to them. And that’s what provoked this insane idea in me. I’m opening up comments so you can tell me what you think.\n\nWhat we do is we create an entirely new version of the band, filled with less attached musicians (who will almost certainly be younger and much more attractive) who would kill to go on a world tour and play to crowds of people and drink lots of booze. We train them up real good. I’d have to sit down with the guitarist/singer and devote Miyagi-esque levels of attention to him, making sure he knows just when to spit cider all over the stage, and just when to start verbally abusing the crowd, and how to do that endless, self-indulgent, seven-minute masturbatory banter in between songs so you don’t have to play very much music. Whack on, whack off.\n\nAnd then we send this group of morons around the world playing our songs. Maybe tossing in a couple of covers that they feel like doing, maybe bringing their own terrible loser ba… uh, I mean, up-and-coming can’t-be-missed bands along as support. And all we ask for in return is 87% of the tour profits. Just kidding.\n\nIt sounds stupid right? It sounds like it wouldn’t be the Dreadnoughts, right? Well, listen, assholes, that’s the Ship of Thesus problem, that thing you said was useless a minute ago. We are already 3/5 members fluid. If we replaced one more and went 4/5 we’d still be the Dreadnoughts right? So why does replacing that final person suddenly magically make it a different band? HUH?? EXPLAIN IT TO ME!!!!\n\nBut the most compelling thing here is this: there are people in Austin and Athens and Arequipa who want to see us, and we are getting older, more attached, and much less mobile. There is a very good chance that they simply will never get to see us. Is it really better that we condemn them to this horrible, wretched fate, all because you purist jerkoffs don’t want to go from 4/5 to 5/5? REALLY??? HUH??????\n\nAnyway, we’re thinking about it. It’s insane and stupid, but so was deciding to play punk and polka and sea shanties and klezmer at the same time, and that didn’t stop us."
