        "text": "It’s been a busy last few months for the Vandoliers. They released their 3rd album ‘Forever,’ their first for Bloodshot Records in February, debuting at 25 on the Americana charts. They were a force during SXSW, earning praise in Rolling Stone, and were featured in the 30 Best Artists We Saw SXSW 2019. We’ve been keeping our eye on our neighbors to the north for a while now, and we caught up with Joshua Fleming a few days before Forever came out.\n\nLuck: Let’s talk about the new record, this latest LP is about 2 years in the making. It’s gotta feel great getting this out there, right?\n\nVandoliers: It’s incredible! Our first record ‘Ameri-Kinda’ was piecing the band together over a series of months, just recording everything separately. With ‘The Native’ we got to record as a band but... we had just changed bass players and we hadn’t even toured as a full band yet. But as soon as we released it, I began writing what would eventually become this new record, ‘Forever’. 50 songs & 400 shows later we’re sifted through and figuring out how we want to represent ourselves at this point in time. It’s been a crazy road of writing, recording, arranging rehearsing and touring, all to lead up to 8 days in a studio in Memphis.\n\nWe worked with Adam Hill (Low Cut Connie, Deer Tick) who really pushed us to perform the songs as a band and as a group. Ya know, try not to utilize punch ins & all that shit. He just made us a better band. After that we had to sit on it for 5 months, waiting for this release. During that time it’s been really crazy for us cause we've changed labels, management and booking agencies. Theres a sense of anxiety with that, like “Oh fuck, I hope all this work was worth something!” I’m really proud of it and I’m proud of my band. I can’t wait to see what people think.\n\nLuck: Sounds like 2019 is the year to hit that next gear?\n\nVandoliers: Absolutely, it's been really cool just to see our fan base grow with us. You know it started in the punk clubs and then with ‘The Native’ we got thrown into the alt-country, red-dirt… Americana base. It’s been really cool to see our punk rock fans stay with us, and then grow into what our fanbase is now. Now I don’t even know very many of them! It’s not like they are obligated friends and family who are sitting out in the crowd. The music is speaking to people and I feel like we have found our sound with this record. That’s one of the biggest stepping stones for a band -- setting yourself apart from everybody else and having your own thing. Man I’m so glad we found it! (laughter)\n\nLuck: Let’s talk about getting signed to Bloodshot Records, seems like a killer fit for the band.\n\nVandoliers: I know! I’m really proud to be with them, they are the greatest people I‘ve ever met (180). So smart and artist-friendly, they are just so supportive of us. You get it, at Luck y’all book all kinds of bands, there are all kinds of sounds that you hear. From an artist perspective, anytime somebody gets what I'm doing or believes in what I'm doing… it’s just so crazy to me. It's a really great feeling for the music to hit people and that they are latching on to it. It’s no longer a discussion of what genre our music is. It’s getting to be “Man, that's the Vandoliers” and that's a good feeling. With Bloodshot I just feel we define everything they do and have done for the last 25 years.\n\nLuck: You mentioned earlier working with Adam Hill. Our readers might recognize his name, as we’ve spoken about him in an interview with The Reputations and Low Cut Connie. What makes him such an in-demand producer right now?\n\nVandoliers: One, he has a golden ear. Two, he’s the funniest person I’ve ever been around. His personality was the thing that attracted us. His resume with all those records, whether as an Assistant Engineer at Arlyn or a Head Engineer/Producer with Low Cut Connie or Deer Tick. What attracts bands to Adam is that he allows you to be the creative force and he is the filter. He’s so on top of everything, in a non-brooding manner. He doesn’t stifle you, he just ensures you get the best performance out of everything. I loved working and would work with him again, any day of the week. He knows how to make a studio session seamless, fly by and at the end of it, oh my god, I'm a better musician. That's something he's bring to the table that a lot of people aren't. He’s done a ton with Low Cut and each one keeps getting better and better. He does a stripped down 4 track recording and make it sound like gold or a full 24 track studio. He always keeps it minimal, it’s really weird, the studio magic is never produced, it's just already there.\n\nLuck: You recorded the record in Memphis?\n\nVandoliers: Yeah, we kinda just fell in love with Memphis. We got there and met these two people, Bill and Kate who own Music Mansion, a bed and breakfast for bands. They told me they had a producer we should talk to. At first I was like, Ok whatever, send me his contact and we will figure out. Well they sent me the contact, I started doing my research and was like holy shit this is a real dude! (laughter) So we set up a meeting in memphis, and Adam and the band hit if off immediately. We toured a bunch of studios and eventually we landed on American Recording Studio in Memphis. Really huge records were recorded there. We walk in and my favorite Wilco record AM is hanging on the wall and there’s like... I’m not sure how to describe it, but feels like there are ghosts in that room, there is a really good vibe. We hit it off with Toby Vest & Pete Matthews, the lead engineers and so we had a great team the moment we walked in. We felt we were at home, but away from distractions enough to hunker down for a week and make this record.\n\nLuck: Having that trust and comfort level in your team… it’s got to be invaluable right?\n\nVandoliers: Having the choices, shit. When you are starting a band you don’t have any choices. Whoever you can afford, let’s go. With this, we had the opportunity to find the right fit, find something that's good for us. Now we are a Texas band, and recording in Texas is awesome, I love it, but we wanted to get out of town for a minute. The city of Memphis has really welcomed us and I love everything about that city, it’s a weird city. It was inspiring, so much music, the birthplace of rock and roll. Everything Memphis used to have, it’s still there, it just may not be utilized as much. I fell into the city, met the people, and fell in love with the stories. I think it comes out in some of the sounds too. To me there are 3 different Tennessee cultures. Chattanooga/Knoxville scene, Nashville with the big money and big machine, and then there is little ol’ Memphis, which is raw. (laughter)\n\nLuck: It’s good to shake it up, get out of the comfort zone, gives a different sense of readiness.\n\nVandoliers: In Dallas & Ft. Worth, we know everybody. We are very involved in the communities with the studios, the musicians… these are all our friends. We could have made a great record there. But like you said, getting out of the comfort zone was really what we wanted to do. We were going from a Texas label to a Chicago label. From a small independent booking to a major booking agency to a major agency, there were so many growing pains. It was a whirlwind and it was good to get away to be in a place where no one knew who we were. We ducked in the shadows and traversed the city, no one was the wiser we were there. It was perfect.\n\nI’m really proud of this record. There comes a time for a lot of bands... there is a sense that you have to fall in line, be more marketable or that type of that shit. The cool thing about Bloodshot, they didn't ask us to do any of that. We get to be unapologetically us. We play to our strengths and we got to spread our wings in terms of sound. There is a piece of me that hopes people like it, but at the end of the day, the band & the label is really proud of it. People will call it whatever they wanna call it, but we are happy. We made a great Vandoliers record.\n\nVerse from Sixteen Years\n\nYeah it took sixteen years\n\nAnd a hundred thousand miles\n\nI was a preacher's son who lost his way for a while\n\nI sang a poor man's song\n\nNo one could hear\n\nIt took a hundred thousand miles and sixteen years\n\nLuck: When you are proud of what you’ve put out there, the rest is just gravy…\n\nVandoliers: Yeah, you know the central theme of this record... even through trials, we are still going to continue, we are still going to be a band. I can point to a song like “Sixteen Years” namely for that. I’m still a creative person and when you are, you can be susceptible to depression and anxiety. One of my favorite things about this record is that I got to turn to one of my heroes, mentors, and now a friend in Rhett Miller (Old 97’s), about my songs. It helped me voice what I was going through. I was in a pretty dark spot for a period of writing this record, not all, but some of it. Where I didn’t know if I could complete the record, whether I could be in a band anymore. But the affirmation I got from Rhett, the label and my band, it pulled me through that. I got to write a great song called Fallen Again which is my favorite song I’ve written at this point, it means a lot to me. Probably not a single, won’t hear it on the radio cause I say “fuck” in it. (laughter) I thought it was an important song. I feel like a lot of people who struggle with depression and high functioning anxiety don’t really get to talk about or are afraid to talk about it.\n\nIt’s important to let folks know they aren’t alone. With that song, I wanted there to be triumph at the end of it. Being at fucking rock bottom with your back against the wall and knowing you can ask for help, that doesn't make you any less of a person.\n\nVerse from Fallen Again\n\nI'm still breathing\n\nBarely holding\n\nOn to the end of my rope\n\nHere I am\n\nCaught on the edge\n\nIs there still reason to hope?\n\nCan you spare some water, brother?\n\nI am dry\n\nCan you give me a hand?\n\nI've fallen again\n\nVandoliers: I never tried to be an outlaw, a good ol’ boy, not trying to be anything other than myself. I’m thankful I'm from Texas but I'm not a purebred, I played hockey and hung out in punk clubs. As I got older and married, my mindset and lifestyle changed, I was a lot less self-destructive. I turned to music and I simplified my writing to a couple chords and how I was feeling that day. That's helped me as a writer to open up. In my old band I felt like I had to portray something. A political stance, a badass or whatever, but with this type of writing and saying what you went through today. Hell, listen to Robert Earl Keen. He’s putting cheese enchiladas into a verse, and it doesn’t matter because it's honest. Willie, Townes, Guy... none of those guys were trying to be anything other than what they are. That's the most attractive point for me. I did a couple of shows last year with Marty Stuart and watching his TV show was the reason I wanted to pursue this type of writing and music. These were the best musicians I've seen in my life. Country musicians don’t get enough credit, they are some of the best songwriters and musicians out there. When I got to meet Marty and I found out he liked my music…. I could die happy now! (laughter) My life view is to expect nothing and be grateful for everything.\n\nLuck: What’s the one Punk record you are bringing to the desert island?\n\nVandoliers: Oh my shit! The Clash by The Clash, it’s one of the first records that I ever bought on vinyl. My uncle was the one who gave me my first guitar when I was 9. He passed away when I was 11. He had a cd of the Cramps that I was really into & they mentioned The Clash in the liner notes. I got that record as I was turning 13. The guitar tones are raw and bad ass. The political climate of 1977 is oozing through that record. I went to a school made up of different races and people, and the anti-racism message throughout that record really spoke to me. I really latched on with the ethos & the mindset of what they defined as punk rock. God I love The Clash, they are the only band that mattered to me.\n\nLuck: Makes sense, you know the role, the stress that comes with. Anytime you are building in your career, whatever that is... the more hats you can wear, the better you are, makes you more well rounded. Tell us about your ideal writing environments.\n\nRB: The car.\n\nJS: Yeah the car, all of my songs are basically written in my car.\n\nRB: The same… we are similar in that all of our voice memos in our phone are all us singing into the phone in the car -\n\nJS: ...humming, my notes are full of some very shitty fragments of lyrics and half melodies. But mostly it's listening to music and hearing a note in a song and pausing, and going on a tangent.\n\nRB: We also spend a lot of time writing song very late at night together usually here or at the Studio.\n\nJS: On the back porch drunk late at night… Electric Power is chock full of late night studio sessions, drunk… pick up this guitar, fight for 10 minutes on how it should go, work it out, hey it sounds great!\n\nLuck: Tell us about the scene here in Austin. It’s got to have its share of pros and cons. What's the best part of being on the scene?\n\nJS: Tough question.\n\nEF: There are a lot of connections to make, whether or not you like a band.\n\nJS: Most of the people are cool, it’s weird though… but it’s a really kind of segmented scene, there's bands that play dirty sixth every night but I don't know one band we know that plays that, theres the Continental Club scene, Sam's Town Point...\n\nRB: Obviously the Hotel Vegas.\n\nJS: Sometimes there is crossover but that’s kinda what it is. But the scene we play in, is really a familial scene.\n\nRS: - It’s just people have been around for a long time, you have the old school, people that move here to play music. But like Erich says, it’s all about making connections and I think it's really easy to do here. There have been sometimes you meet people and it’s just like there are some bands that it’s harder to engage with than others…\n\nJS: We all wanna talk shit right now… [laughs]\n\nRS: It’s a tough question because… I came from El Paso, and it was lot more of melting pot. Metal bands playing with punk bands playing with indie rock bands and everyone got along. Like Justin said it's a lot more segmented here.\n\nJS: And not like a bad thing, it’s not a turf war…\n\nRS: No it’s actually kind of cool, cause if you are music fan and looking for something specific, you know there is a venue for you. It’s really cool but its very saturated. There are a lot of bands.\n\nJenny Carson: I think when people get asked that question it's almost like a dark cloud over the question. Because the music industry is so hard. It’s like you are kind of drowning in it and it’s difficult to come up and see the light.\n\nRS: Yeah Austin is this kinda weird middle ground between a small town with a really good music scene and a large city where there is an actual music industry like Nashville, LA or NYC.\n\nJS: Yeah I was about to say, the biggest problem with this town in terms of music is that there is tons of talent in music but hardly [any] industry. You have SXSW but it isn’t an Austin industry, in that they bring band from other towns. Austin City Limits Festival will fill local act for their 11am slots … so there's not a whole lot of support for local austin band even from these major events. Besides that there's hardly any labels here, but they just opened a pressing plant which is really cool because we now have a really easy and cheaper way for bands to press their music and get it out there. And slowly, more stuff like that is gonna come as people notice all the talent, all the bands, it's gonna grow. But until that stuff is here it's more of a private scene compared to a city with industry.\n\nJC: WIth this experience with these guys, Sweetheart Studios (started by Jimmy and Seth Gibbs) existing. These places are fucking wonderful because there are all kinds of artists, and the spectrum of artists…\n\nJS: Who’s the worst band you recorded?? [laughs]\n\nRB: I think you are seeing different kinds of artist but also different mediums. You meet so many visual artist. Jaime Zuverza who did the album design for both records. Jackson Montgomery Schwartz & Jon Chamberlain do a lot of our photos, You meet so many people that are so talented in different ways…\n\nJC: Sara Ostovar (Modesty Hair Studio), who does our hair! We’re kinda of a hair band! There's industries within industries\n\nJS: I was telling Jackson the other day. Tons of people that like us… I don't want to say our fans, cause I don’t who the fuck that is [laughs] the people who are into us at least part of that is because someone sees a really badass fucking photo from Jackson, and our hair looks good because of Sara. The flyer looks great because Ben Tipton did it (Ben is also in the band Trouble Boys with Jimmy and Erich) And finally, maybe somebody through all of those layers... of us looking cool says ok, I guess i'll go listen to them. And then hopefully, we’re good enough for them to stick around\n\nRS: It’s kinda awesome, it's such a self sufficient scene, all of our friends are so talented and they just kind of help us out and were just really lucky. Not a Lot of cities are like that, or you got to pay big money\n\nLuck: Luck Reunion is perceived as an americana festival but we don’t think of ourselves as such necessarily. It leads to an ongoing conversation in terms of what is Americana, is there gerne beyond good music? That said, is there a genre that best describes you?\n\nJW: Powersoul!\n\nRB: Which is something we invented.\n\nJS: Rock and roll, it sounds lame and cheesy to say but I feel you like limit yourself, [you] create false expectations from others when you try to pigeonhole yourself. We made up powersoul to prevent that. When someone says, “I don’t know what the fuck that is,” we say, “Come on down and see it for yourself”."
