        "text": "See https://extension.psu.edu/japanese-stiltgrass and https://www.lewisginter.org/japanese-stiltgrass/ for a brief description.\n\nIf it forms a dense monoculture in an area, it will crowd out other ground level vegetation which will likely displace a number native species. The reduction of native species abundance and diversity will put pressure on any specialist animals that rely on those species. Many butterflies/moths, bees, and other arthropods (even grasshoppers) depend on a specific plant (or small group of closely related plants) at some stage in their lifecycle. If these species experience dramatic population declines it can have ecological ripple effects, especially if there are not other species ready and able to fill the void as food for other creatures, pollinators, or seed dispersal avenues, etc.\n\nFor example, if certain butterflies and moth populations crash because the plants that their caterpillars rely on are no longer available and other butterfly/moth species do not proportionally increase their populations in response to less competition, then many songbird populations could also decline if they cannot find enough caterpillars to raise healthy chicks during their breeding seasons. Over time, fewer songbirds might lead to fewer raptors and poorer seed dispersal for other plants not directly impacted by the Stilt Grass. Poor seed dispersal for those plants could reduce or concentrate populations in such a way that will have some other ecological impact, and so on. There are also a host of impacts that could occur below ground with soil texture, microbial activity, water infiltration/retention that can have wide ranging effects.\n\nAlso, if an animal’s normal food source is disrupted, it may be forced to venture farther afield outside of natural areas (forests and such) and into human populated areas such as deer devouring backyard gardens rather than feeding in the forest (admittedly, in many places, this particular example is often caused by over population rather than a lack of forage).\n\nWhile some species might benefit from changes spurred on by invasives, others certainly will not. It is somewhat misleading to speak of natural equilibrium in an undisturbed native ecosystem because all of the living organisms in ecosystems are in a constant state of change and adaption. However, the introduction and aggressive spread of invasive species often throws out the rules by which an ecosystem changes leading to more disruptive change over a very short period of time (e.g. years or decades as opposed to centuries).\n\nI see Japanese stilt-grass all over the forest here in Ohio. And I think right now is when it is growing in height a lot - I found a small green wood orchid last week with its flowering stem visible above the sea of stilt grass still, yesterday tried to show it to someone but the stilt grass had grown much higher and it was impossible to find anything between the millions of stilt grass plants. (If stilt grass is not supposed to grow higher right now my GPS could also have been off, but I’m pretty sure it was the stilt grass growing higher.)\n\nMy hope is that some plants (like the orchid above) which do have leaves several weeks earlier than the stilt grass can maybe get enough sunlight earlier in the year and yet survive? I don’t know anything about how plants compete underground though, so maybe the stilt grass will still kill them off by taking all the soil nutrients?\n\nmy town’s use of herbicides to control invasive species – namely Japanese knotweed, Purple loosestrife, Oriental bittersweet, Norway maple, etc\n\nHerbicide is the only realistic control for Japanese knotweed, but I wouldn’t use herbicide on the other three.\n\nPurple loosestrife has a bio-control that seems to be quite effective. My town in north-central Massachusetts was one of the release sites. It seems to have worked. Purple loosestrife isn’t gone (it never will be), but the beetle keeps it to a level where it doesn’t overrun the ecosystem. Now phragmites is taking over, but that’s another story.\n\nBittersweet is best just cut. For small stems, pull up the roots, and keep pulling by following the stringers along. They are quite shallow extending laterally. For large vines, cut out a section that you can easily reach from the ground. That will kill whatever is above. Then paint or do a quick spray of glyphosate on the cut stump now sticking out of the ground. This must be done quickly after cutting, preferably within a minute or two.\n\nFor Norway maple, just cut it. There will be some stump sprouts, and maybe other sprouts do to existing seeds. Pull the small ones and cut the ones coming from the old stump. Eventually the roots will be exhausted. It helps to do a quick spray of herbicide on the stump when it was originally cut.\n\nOther then on cut stumps, you don’t need herbicide for any other species you listed except knotweed. Even then, the best first pass treatment is to cut the knotweed low to the ground just below a knot, then drip a little herbicide into the hollow stem. Unlike what others say, it doesn’t take a lot. We use just 2 ml of properly diluted Roundup Pro (glyphosate). Give that a few weeks at least, then treat the stragglers with foliar spray in the fall, about the time healthy plants would be blooming.\n\nBy the way, we (the Town of Groton Invasive Species Committee) have done some research on different treatments for knotweed. We found that very dilute triclopyr works really well as a foliar spray. Specifically, we use Garlon 4 Ultra, with a little bit of methylated seed oil added as a surfactant. Knotweed is highly susceptible to triclopyr, which is very useful if there is grass around the knotweed you want to keep. Use 1/4 strength of what the label would otherwise imply. 1/2 strength works better than full strength (relative to label recommendations), and 1/4 strength works better then 1/2 strength. I don’t know exactly why, but my guess is that triclopyr otherwise kills the leaves so fast that they don’t have time to pass on the herbicide into the roots before they die.\n\nI know that glyphosate is usually preferred to triclopyr mostly due to the cost, but when you’re only using 1/4 the normal strength, it gets a lot cheaper. That and the higher dilution of Garlon 4 Ultra over something like Roundup Pro in the first place means the Garlon treatment is actually cheaper."
