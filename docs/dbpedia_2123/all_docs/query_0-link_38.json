Some of the recent Mark Hill remixes include Sam Smith, Mark Ronson, The 1975 and Jack Garratt.\n\nFast forward to 2024 and Mark Hill is back with a brand new studio, working on new music under his own name and bearing his signature polished production and unquestionable song writing abilities. Mark is planning a DJ and live tour and working on an exciting new project which is currently under wraps."
