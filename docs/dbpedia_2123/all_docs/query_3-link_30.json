Possible values are THROUGHPUT_BASED to enable autoscaling, or NONE to disable. See Autotuning features to learn more about how autoscaling works in the Dataflow managed service. Defaults to THROUGHPUT_BASED for all batch Dataflow jobs, and for streaming jobs that use Streaming Engine. Defaults to NONE for streaming jobs that don't use Streaming Engine. flexRSGoal String Specifies Flexible Resource Scheduling (FlexRS) for autoscaled batch jobs. Affects the numWorkers, autoscalingAlgorithm, zone, region, and workerMachineType parameters. For more information, see the FlexRS pipeline options section. If unspecified, defaults to SPEED_OPTIMIZED, which is the same as omitting this flag. To turn on FlexRS, you must specify the value COST_OPTIMIZED to allow the Dataflow service to choose any available discounted resources. maxNumWorkers int The maximum number of Compute Engine instances to be made available to your pipeline during execution. This value can be higher than the initial number of workers (specified by numWorkers) to allow your job to scale up, automatically or otherwise. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers. Supported in Flex Templates. numberOfWorkerHarnessThreads int This option influences the number of concurrent units of work that can be assigned to one worker VM at a time. Lower values might reduce memory usage by decreasing parallelism. This value influences the upper bound of parallelism, but the actual number of threads on the worker might not match this value depending on other constraints. The implementation depends on the SDK language and other runtime parameters.\n\nTo reduce the parallelism for batch pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of vCPUs on the worker. For streaming pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of threads per Apache Beam SDK process. To estimate threads per process, see the table in the DoFn memory usage section in \"Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors.\"\n\nFor more information about using this option to reduce memory usage, see Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate value. Supported in Flex Templates. numWorkers int The initial number of Compute Engine instances to use when executing your pipeline. This option determines how many workers the Dataflow service starts up when your job begins. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers. Supported in Flex Templates.\n\nField Type Description Default value Template support autoscaling_algorithm str The autoscaling mode for your Dataflow job. Possible values are THROUGHPUT_BASED to enable autoscaling, or NONE to disable. See Autotuning features to learn more about how autoscaling works in the Dataflow managed service. Defaults to THROUGHPUT_BASED for all batch Dataflow jobs, and for streaming jobs that use Streaming Engine. Defaults to NONE for streaming jobs that don't use Streaming Engine. flexrs_goal str Specifies Flexible Resource Scheduling (FlexRS) for autoscaled batch jobs. Affects the num_workers, autoscaling_algorithm, zone, region, and machine_type parameters. For more information, see the FlexRS pipeline options section. If unspecified, defaults to SPEED_OPTIMIZED, which is the same as omitting this flag. To turn on FlexRS, you must specify the value COST_OPTIMIZED to allow the Dataflow service to choose any available discounted resources. max_num_workers int The maximum number of Compute Engine instances to be made available to your pipeline during execution. This value can be higher than the initial number of workers (specified by num_workers) to allow your job to scale up, automatically or otherwise. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers. Supported in Flex Templates. number_of_worker_harness_threads int This option influences the number of concurrent units of work that can be assigned to one worker VM at a time. Lower values might reduce memory usage by decreasing parallelism. This value influences the upper bound of parallelism, but the actual number of threads on the worker might not match this value depending on other constraints. The implementation depends on the SDK language and other runtime parameters.\n\nTo reduce the parallelism for batch pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of vCPUs on the worker. For streaming pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of threads per Apache Beam SDK process. To estimate threads per process, see the table in the DoFn memory usage section in \"Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors.\"\n\nWhen using this option to reduce memory usage, using the `--experiments=no_use_multiple_sdk_containers` option might also be necessary, particularly for batch pipelines. For more information, see Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate value. Supported in Flex Templates. experiments=no_use_multiple_sdk_containers Configures Dataflow worker VMs to start only one containerized Apache Beam Python SDK process. Does not decrease the total number of threads, therefore all threads run in a single Apache Beam SDK process. Due to Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), CPU utilization might be limited and performance reduced. When using this option with a worker machine type that has many vCPU cores, to prevent stuck workers, consider reducing the number of worker harness threads. If not specified, Dataflow starts one Apache Beam SDK process per VM core. This experiment only affects Python pipelines that use Dataflow Runner V2. Supported. Can be set by the template or by using the --additional_experiments option. num_workers int The number of Compute Engine instances to use when executing your pipeline. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers. Supported in Flex Templates.\n\nField Type Description Default value autoscaling_algorithm str The autoscaling mode for your Dataflow job.

To turn on FlexRS, you must specify the value COST_OPTIMIZED to allow the Dataflow service to choose any available discounted resources. max_num_workers int The maximum number of Compute Engine instances to be made available to your pipeline during execution. This value can be higher than the initial number of workers (specified by num_workers) to allow your job to scale up, automatically or otherwise. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers. number_of_worker_harness_threads int This option influences the number of concurrent units of work that can be assigned to one worker VM at a time. Lower values might reduce memory usage by decreasing parallelism. This value influences the upper bound of parallelism, but the actual number of threads on the worker might not match this value depending on other constraints. The implementation depends on the SDK language and other runtime parameters.\n\nTo reduce the parallelism for batch pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of vCPUs on the worker. For streaming pipelines, set the value of the flag to a number that is less than the number of threads per Apache Beam SDK process. To estimate threads per process, see the table in the DoFn memory usage section in \"Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors.\"\n\nFor more information about using this option to reduce memory usage, see Troubleshoot Dataflow out of memory errors. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate value. num_workers int The number of Compute Engine instances to use when executing your pipeline. If unspecified, the Dataflow service determines an appropriate number of workers.\n\nField Type Description Default value Template support dataflowKmsKey String Specifies the usage and the name of a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) used to encrypt data at rest. You can control the encryption key through Cloud KMS. You must also specify tempLocation to use this feature. If unspecified, Dataflow uses the default Google Cloud encryption instead of a CMEK. Supported in Flex Templates. gcpOauthScopes List Specifies the OAuth scopes that will be requested when creating the default Google Cloud credentials. Might have no effect if you manually specify the Google Cloud credential or credential factory. If not set, the following scopes are used: \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery.insertdata\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email\" impersonateServiceAccount String If set, all API requests are made as the designated service account or as the target service account in an impersonation delegation chain. Specify either a single service account as the impersonator, or a comma-separated list of service accounts to create an impersonation delegation chain. This option is only used to submit Dataflow jobs. If not set, Application Default Credentials are used to submit Dataflow jobs. serviceAccount String Specifies a user-managed worker service account, using the format my-service-account-name@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com. For more information, see the Worker service account section of the Dataflow security and permissions page. If not set, workers use the Compute Engine service account of your project as the worker service account. Supported in Flex Templates. network String The Compute Engine network for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your network. If not set, Google Cloud assumes that you intend to use a network named default. Supported in Flex Templates. subnetwork String The Compute Engine subnetwork for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your subnetwork. The Dataflow service determines the default value. Supported in Flex Templates. usePublicIps boolean Specifies whether Dataflow workers use external IP addresses. If the value is set to false, Dataflow workers use internal IP addresses for all communication. In this case, if the subnetwork option is specified, the network option is ignored. Make sure that the specified network or subnetwork has Private Google Access enabled. External IP addresses have an associated cost.\n\nYou can also use the WorkerIPAddressConfiguration API field to specify how IP addresses are allocated to worker machines. If not set, the default value is true and Dataflow workers use external IP addresses.\n\nField Type Description Default value Template support dataflow_kms_key str Specifies the usage and the name of a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) used to encrypt data at rest. You can control the encryption key through Cloud KMS. You must also specify temp_location to use this feature. If unspecified, Dataflow uses the default Google Cloud encryption instead of a CMEK. Supported in Flex Templates. gcp_oauth_scopes list[str] Specifies the OAuth scopes that will be requested when creating Google Cloud credentials.

If not set, workers use the Compute Engine service account of your project as the worker service account. Supported in Flex Templates. network str The Compute Engine network for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your network. If not set, Google Cloud assumes that you intend to use a network named default. Supported in Flex Templates. subnetwork str The Compute Engine subnetwork for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your subnetwork. The Dataflow service determines the default value. Supported in Flex Templates. use_public_ips Optional [bool] Specifies whether Dataflow workers must use external IP addresses. External IP addresses have an associated cost.\n\nTo enable external IP addresses for Dataflow workers, specify the command-line flag: --use_public_ips or set the option using the programmatic API—for example, options = PipelineOptions(use_public_ips=True).\n\nTo make Dataflow workers use internal IP addresses for all communication, specify the command-line flag: --no_use_public_ips or set the option using the programmatic API—for example, options = PipelineOptions(use_public_ips=False). In this case, if the subnetwork option is specified, the network option is ignored. Make sure that the specified network or subnetwork has Private Google Access enabled.\n\nYou can also use the WorkerIPAddressConfiguration API field to specify how IP addresses are allocated to worker machines. If the option is not explicitly enabled or disabled, the Dataflow workers use external IP addresses. Supported in Flex Templates. no_use_public_ips Command-line flag that sets use_public_ips to False. See use_public_ips. Supported in Flex Templates.\n\nField Type Description Default value dataflow_kms_key str Specifies the usage and the name of a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) used to encrypt data at rest. You can control the encryption key through Cloud KMS. You must also specify temp_location to use this feature. Requires Apache Beam SDK 2.40.0 or later. If unspecified, Dataflow uses the default Google Cloud encryption instead of a CMEK. network str The Compute Engine network for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your network. If not set, Google Cloud assumes that you intend to use a network named default. service_account_email str Specifies a user-managed worker service account, using the format my-service-account-name@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com. For more information, see the Worker service account section of the Dataflow security and permissions page. If not set, workers use the Compute Engine service account of your project as the worker service account. subnetwork str The Compute Engine subnetwork for launching Compute Engine instances to run your pipeline. See how to specify your subnetwork. The Dataflow service determines the default value. no_use_public_ips bool Specifies that Dataflow workers must not use external IP addresses. If the value is set to true, Dataflow workers use internal IP addresses for all communication. In this case, if the subnetwork option is specified, the network option is ignored. Make sure that the specified network or subnetwork has Private Google Access enabled. External IP addresses have an associated cost.\n\nYou can also use the WorkerIPAddressConfiguration API field to specify how IP addresses are allocated to worker machines. If not set, Dataflow workers use external IP addresses.\n\nField Type Description Default value Template support diskSizeGb int\n\nThe disk size, in gigabytes, to use on each remote Compute Engine worker instance. If set, specify at least 30 GB to account for the worker boot image and local logs.\n\nFor batch jobs using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of a worker VM boot disk. For batch jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of the disks used to store shuffled data; the boot disk size is not affected.\n\nFor streaming jobs using Streaming Engine, this option sets size of the boot disks. For streaming jobs not using Streaming Engine, this option sets the size of each additional Persistent Disk created by the Dataflow service; the boot disk is not affected. If a streaming job does not use Streaming Engine, you can set the boot disk size with the experiment flag streaming_boot_disk_size_gb. For example, specify --experiments=streaming_boot_disk_size_gb=80 to create boot disks of 80 GB.\n\nSet to 0 to use the default size defined in your Google Cloud project.\n\nIf a batch job uses Dataflow Shuffle, then the default is 25&nbspGB; otherwise, the default is 250 GB.\n\nIf a streaming job uses Streaming Engine, then the default is 30&nbspGB; otherwise, the default is 400 GB.\n\nWarning: Lowering the disk size reduces available shuffle I/O. Shuffle-bound jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle or Streaming Engine may result in increased runtime and job cost.\n\nfilesToStage List<String> A non-empty list of local files, directories of files, or archives (such as JAR or zip files) to make available to each worker. If you set this option, then only those files you specify are uploaded (the Java classpath is ignored). You must specify all of your resources in the correct classpath order. Resources are not limited to code, but can also include configuration files and other resources to make available to all workers. Your code can access the listed resources using the standard Java resource lookup methods. Cautions: Specifying a directory path is suboptimal since Dataflow zips the files before uploading, which involves a higher startup time cost. Also, don't use this option to transfer data to workers that is meant to be processed by the pipeline since doing so is significantly slower than using built-in Cloud Storage/BigQuery APIs combined with the appropriate Dataflow data source. If filesToStage is omitted, Dataflow infers the files to stage based on the Java classpath. The considerations and cautions mentioned in the left column also apply here (types of files to list and how to access them from your code). workerDiskType String The type of Persistent Disk to use, specified by a full URL of the disk type resource. For example, use compute.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/zones/ZONE/diskTypes/pd-ssd to specify an SSD Persistent Disk. When using Streaming Engine, don't specify a Persistent Disk. For more information, see the Compute Engine API reference page for diskTypes. Supported values: pd-ssd, pd-standard. The Dataflow service determines the default value. workerMachineType String\n\nThe Compute Engine machine type that Dataflow uses when starting worker VMs. You can use x86 or Arm machine types, including custom machine types.\n\nFor Arm, the Tau T2A machine series is supported. For more information about using Arm VMs, see Use Arm VMs in Dataflow.\n\nShared core machine types, such as f1 and g1 series workers, are not supported under the Dataflow Service Level Agreement.\n\nBilling is independent of the machine type family. For more information, see Dataflow pricing.\n\nCustom machine types\n\nTo specify a custom machine type, use the following format: FAMILY-vCPU-MEMORY. Replace the following:\n\nFAMILY. Use one of the following values:\n\nMachine seriesValue N1custom N2n2-custom N2Dn2d-custom N4n4-custom E2e2-custom\n\nvCPU. The number of vCPUs.\n\nMEMORY. The memory, in MB.\n\nTo enable extended memory, append -ext to the machine type.\n\nExamples: n2-custom-6-3072, n2-custom-2-32768-ext.\n\nFor more information about valid custom machine types, see Custom machine types in the Compute Engine documentation.\n\nIf you don't set this option, Dataflow chooses the machine type based on your job. Supported in Flex Templates. workerRegion String\n\nSpecifies a Compute Engine region for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. This option is used to run workers in a different location than the region used to deploy, manage, and monitor jobs. The zone for workerRegion is automatically assigned.\n\nNote: This option cannot be combined with workerZone or zone.\n\nIf not set, defaults to the value set for region. Supported in Flex Templates. workerZone String\n\nSpecifies a Compute Engine zone for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. This option is used to run workers in a different location than the region used to deploy, manage, and monitor jobs.\n\nNote: This option cannot be combined with workerRegion or zone.\n\nIf you specify either region or workerRegion, workerZone defaults to a zone from the corresponding region. You can override this behavior by specifying a different zone. Supported in Flex Templates. zone String (Deprecated) For Apache Beam SDK 2.17.0 or earlier, this option specifies the Compute Engine zone for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. If you specify region, zone defaults to a zone from the corresponding region. You can override this behavior by specifying a different zone. Supported in Flex Templates. workerCacheMb int Specifies the size of cache for side inputs and user state. By default, the Dataflow allocate 100 MB of memory for caching side inputs and user state. A larger cache might improve the performance of jobs that use large iterable side inputs but also consumes more worker memory. Defaults to 100 MB. maxCacheMemoryUsageMb int For jobs that use Dataflow Runner v2, specifies the cache size for side inputs and user state in the format maxCacheMemoryUsageMb=N, where N is the cache size in MB. A larger cache might improve the performance of jobs that use large iterable side inputs but also consumes more worker memory. Alternatively, to set the cache size as a percentage of total VM space, specify maxCacheMemoryUsagePercent. Defaults to 100 MB. maxCacheMemoryUsagePercent int For jobs that use Dataflow Runner v2, specifies the cache size as a percentage of total VM space in the format maxCacheMemoryUsagePercent=N, where N is the cache size as a percentage of total VM space. A larger cache might improve the performance of jobs that use large iterable side inputs but also consumes more worker memory. Defaults to 20%.\n\nField Type Description Default value Template support disk_size_gb int\n\nThe disk size, in gigabytes, to use on each remote Compute Engine worker instance. If set, specify at least 30 GB to account for the worker boot image and local logs.\n\nFor batch jobs using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of a worker VM boot disk. For batch jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of the disks used to store shuffled data; the boot disk size is not affected.\n\nFor streaming jobs using Streaming Engine, this option sets size of the boot disks. For streaming jobs not using Streaming Engine, this option sets the size of each additional Persistent Disk created by the Dataflow service; the boot disk is not affected.\n\nIf a streaming job does not use Streaming Engine, you can set the boot disk size with the experiment flag <code>streaming_boot_disk_size_gb</code>. For example, specify <code>--experiments=streaming_boot_disk_size_gb=80</code> to create boot disks of 80 GB.\n\nSet to 0 to use the default size defined in your Google Cloud project.\n\nIf a batch job uses Dataflow Shuffle, then the default is 25&nbspGB; otherwise, the default is 250 GB.\n\nIf a streaming job uses Streaming Engine, then the default is 30&nbspGB; otherwise, the default is 400 GB.\n\nWarning: Lowering the disk size reduces available shuffle I/O. Shuffle-bound jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle or Streaming Engine may result in increased runtime and job cost.\n\nworker_disk_type str The type of Persistent Disk to use, specified by a full URL of the disk type resource. For example, use compute.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/zones/ZONE/diskTypes/pd-ssd to specify an SSD Persistent Disk. When using Streaming Engine, don't specify a Persistent Disk. For more information, see the Compute Engine API reference page for diskTypes. Supported values: pd-ssd, pd-standard. The Dataflow service determines the default value. machine_type str\n\nThe Compute Engine machine type that Dataflow uses when starting worker VMs. You can use x86 or Arm machine types, including custom machine types.\n\nFor Arm, the Tau T2A machine series is supported. For more information about using Arm VMs, see Use Arm VMs in Dataflow.\n\nShared core machine types, such as f1 and g1 series workers, are not supported under the Dataflow Service Level Agreement.\n\nBilling is independent of the machine type family. For more information, see Dataflow pricing.\n\nCustom machine types\n\nTo specify a custom machine type, use the following format: FAMILY-vCPU-MEMORY. Replace the following:\n\nFAMILY. Use one of the following values:\n\nMachine seriesValue N1custom N2n2-custom N2Dn2d-custom N4n4-custom E2e2-custom\n\nvCPU. The number of vCPUs.\n\nMEMORY. The memory, in MB.\n\nTo enable extended memory, append -ext to the machine type.\n\nExamples: n2-custom-6-3072, n2-custom-2-32768-ext.\n\nFor more information about valid custom machine types, see Custom machine types in the Compute Engine documentation.\n\nIf you don't set this option, Dataflow chooses the machine type based on your job. Supported in Flex Templates. worker_region str\n\nSpecifies a Compute Engine region for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. This option is used to run workers in a different location than the region used to deploy, manage, and monitor jobs. The zone for worker_region is automatically assigned.\n\nNote: This option cannot be combined with worker_zone or zone.\n\nIf not set, defaults to the value set for region. Supported in Flex Templates. worker_zone str\n\nSpecifies a Compute Engine zone for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. This option is used to run workers in a different location than the region used to deploy, manage, and monitor jobs.\n\nNote: This option cannot be combined with worker_region or zone.\n\nIf you specify either region or worker_region, worker_zone defaults to a zone from the corresponding region. You can override this behavior by specifying a different zone. Supported in Flex Templates. zone str (Deprecated) For Apache Beam SDK 2.17.0 or earlier, this option specifies the Compute Engine zone for launching worker instances to run your pipeline. If you specify region, zone defaults to a zone from the corresponding region. You can override this behavior by specifying a different zone. Supported in Flex Templates. max_cache_memory_usage_mb int\n\nStarting in Apache Beam Python SDK version 2.52.0, you can use this option to control the cache size for side inputs and for user state. Applies for each SDK process. Increasing the amount of memory allocated to workers might improve the performance of jobs that use large iterable side inputs but also consumes more worker memory.\n\nTo increase the side input cache value, use one of the following pipeline options.\n\nFor SDK versions 2.52.0 and later, use --max_cache_memory_usage_mb=N.\n\nFor SDK versions 2.42.0 to 2.51.0, use --experiments=state_cache_size=N.\n\nReplace N with the cache size, in MB.\n\nFor SDK versions 2.52.0-2.54.0, defaults to 100 MB.\n\nFor other SDK versions, defaults to 0 MB.\n\nField Type Description Default value disk_size_gb int\n\nThe disk size, in gigabytes, to use on each remote Compute Engine worker instance. If set, specify at least 30 GB to account for the worker boot image and local logs.\n\nFor batch jobs using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of a worker VM boot disk. For batch jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle, this option sets the size of the disks used to store shuffled data; the boot disk size is not affected.\n\nSet to 0 to use the default size defined in your Google Cloud project.\n\nIf a batch job uses Dataflow Shuffle, then the default is 25&nbspGB; otherwise, the default is 250 GB.\n\nWarning: Lowering the disk size reduces available shuffle I/O. Shuffle-bound jobs not using Dataflow Shuffle might result in increased runtime and job cost.\n\ndisk_type str The type of Persistent Disk to use, specified by a full URL of the disk type resource.
