        "text": "If you have a large yard, a riding mower can be a great way to cut your grass more efficiently and keep your lawn looking its best. They not only save you time and effort, but they can also be a lot of fun to use. With so many different models and brands on the market, it can be hard to know which one is right for you. That's why I've done the work for you to compare the specs on leading models and find the best riding mowers to fit different yard maintenance needs and budgets\n\nThere are a few things to consider when you begin thinking about buying a riding lawn mower. The size of your lawn is one of the key factors -- it may be overkill to use a riding lawn mower for a 0.05-acre plot when a push mower will do it in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, there's a huge price gap between even the nicest of push mowers and most budget-conscious riding mowers. On top of that, not all lawns are created equal. You may need to take steep inclines or other rugged terrain into consideration when making this type of decision.\n\nWith recent advancements in battery technologies, you now also have the option of electric versus traditional gas motors. There's a lot to consider here. For one, if you run out of gas when mowing your lawn, you can take a couple minutes to add more gas and keep going. The same scenario with an electric unit could see you with an hour or two gap in your mowing while you recharge. So sizing your machine to your specific lawn can be even more important when looking at electric options.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the electric units are compatible with battery platforms, meaning you could take the batteries from the mower and use them in other tools as well. That also means that if you have extra batteries for those other tools, you could pop those into your mower if they were charged and you find yourself running out of power -- sidestepping the time delay in refueling versus recharging. There will still be an offset on pricing, however. There's a hefty upfront investment in batteries that may be tough to recoup.\n\nAn important note: Unlike the vast majority of best lists on CNET, this one is based on our research rather than hands-on testing -- only because the size and expense of these units made the acquisition of product samples logistically challenging. I've compared all the specs to find the best riding lawn mowers on the market, so you can make an informed decision about which one could be right for you."
