        "text": "If you don’t already know, the online plant community is an extremely welcoming crowd. Even that Instagram plant celebrity whose photos you love to double-tap is usually willing to answer questions and offer support to newbies. Yet as a relative newcomer to the scene, I was admittedly a little nervous about my first official plant swap.\n\nOn a sweltering 90-degree L.A. day, I dragged my husband to downtown L.A. for the WYLDBNCH X RT1home Summer Swap. With me, I brought my B-squad (the shame!) — plants that I felt were unworthy cuttings compared to what I’ve seen in past Instagram photos and stories from other swaps.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the goods I came in with:\n\n4 - rooted Pilea ‘Pan Am’\n\n3 - rooted Cebu Blue Pothos cuttings\n\n1 - rooted Philodendron ‘Prince of Orange’\n\n1 - barely rooted Philodendron ‘Micans’ rehab\n\nI stepped inside The Container Yard building where the swap was hosted, carefully balancing a repurposed Trader Joe’s cardboard water bottle tray filled with my sacrificial offerings. A swell of activity rose as soon as I crossed the threshold — attendees were setting up their stations, and introductions were humming left and right. I checked in at the front desk, got a two-minute rundown on how swaps work and scooted through the crowd to set up shop.\n\nHow a plant swap works\n\nBefore arriving I did online research about what to expect at a swap. Although I got a sense of what a swap was — a coordinated event where plant lovers trade plants — I was still lost as to how a swap worked. Who approaches who, first? How do you initiate the conversation? How do you gently decline an offer? What’s the universal etiquette?\n\nThe internet failed me, but as the event carried on, I eventually learned my way through these questions. Plant swaps may be organized a bit differently, but this is the gist of what to expect.\n\nAttendees are invited to find an empty spot at the many tables throughout the space. Some people, myself included, simply arrange cuttings neatly on the table, while some vets bring elaborate presentations to flaunt their prized plants.\n\nAfter setting up, it’s time to scope out everyone else’s goods — keep in mind, it’s not time to swap yet! This is the time to take mental notes of which plants you’re eyeing and which of your plants you’re wiling to offer.\n\nThe host of the swap typically announces the time the official swap starts. As soon as the swap is officially on, you may see some people bee-lining it to a wishlist plant, some people choose to make second rounds to every table for a closer look, and some stay at their station waiting for others to come to them.\n\nIf you’re roaming around and find a plant you’d like to trade for, the conversation may look like this:\n\n“Hey! What were you looking to trade for your Philodendron ‘Pink Princess’?”\n\nSome people may have a specific trade in mind, like Aroids, Hoyas or a subspecies of Anthurium. If not, they may say:\n\n“I’m not sure, actually. What you you have?”\n\nYou can either list off your plants or invite them to your station so they get a better sense of what you have to offer. From here, trades can either look like a one-to-one swap, or multiple plants in exchange for one plant. Whatever the exchange, don’t feel pressured to accept a trade if you’re not really into it.\n\nI learned this the hard way with my first trade at the event.\n\nI honestly didn’t think anyone would be interested in my plants. So when someone came to me in the first minute of the swap asking for my Prince of Orange, I was just so excited to participate in a swap —period — that I agreed to the trade. My Prince of Orange was my “best in show” compared to my other plants and I swapped it for two semi-rooted Pothos ‘N’Joy’ cuttings. After the trade, I had all. the. regrets. I was never really a fan of the N’Joy and knew I let myself get carried away in the moment.\n\nDon’t be like me.\n\nWhat can you say if someone offers a trade that you’re not excited about? Keep it simple and keep it kind.\n\n“Thanks, but I’ll pass.”\n\nOverall, there are a few dos and don’ts to keep in mind for a successful first plant swap event. Here’s a rundown — some might seem obvious, but a reminder can be helpful.\n\nGeneral plant swap etiquette\n\nDo offer trades that are comparable in desirability and/or value\n\nDon’t take anything from anyone’s station without their consent\n\nDo stay respectful and kind with your fellow swappers\n\nDon’t get offended or pushy when someone says “no”\n\nDo get away from your station every now and then to build relationships within your local plant community\n\nDon’t feel bad if someone you traded with re-swaps your plant with someone else\n\nI chose to walk around multiple times to take in all of the plants, from tiny cuttings to the chonkiest of plants. It felt unnerving going up to strangers or (more often than not) people I silently follow in Instagram, to even just say “Hey”, but as I got the conversations rolling it got easier. Surprisingly, I found that many people who I thought were experienced swappers were actually first-timers, like me.\n\nThe last 10 minutes of the swap was announced and I still had two plants to re-home— my Micans rescue and a Pan Am. I didn’t want to bring my original plants back home so I scooped them up and peddled them around, table to table. In just a few minutes, I made eye-contact with others who had stragglers of their own. We shrugged our shoulders and shouted out:\n\n“Want this Pilea Pan Am?”\n\n“Sure, want this Wandering ‘Dude’?”\n\nDONE."
