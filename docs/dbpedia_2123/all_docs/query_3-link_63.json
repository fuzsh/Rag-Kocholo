        "text": "This essay is part 1/2. Check out part 2 when you're done!\n\nOfficial Labels & Diagnoses üß†üî•\n\nI was diagnosed with ‚Äògiftedness‚Äô as a kid.\n\nI‚Äôve always hated the term. If you‚Äôve been taught to value humility, getting diagnosed as ‚Äògifted‚Äô feels pretentious, comes with a ‚Äúduty to live up to your potential‚Äù, and adds friction to the already-difficult process of getting accommodations for the very real and specific set of struggles you‚Äôre likely to face ‚Äî after all, why should we make life even easier for ‚Äògifted‚Äô people‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt ‚Äògiftedness‚Äô already an unfair advantage?\n\nAround the same time, my brother was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Issues, Giftedness, Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome (later renamed ‚Äòhigh-functioning Autism‚Äô), followed by an ADHD diagnosis, then Anxiety. I‚Äôve always hated the consequences of some of these other labels too ‚Äî they evoke an emotional reaction somewhere in the land of pity-awkwardness-confusion-sympathy, none of which feel like the right response.\n\nFor those who meet my brother after knowing about these diagnoses, there‚Äôs usually some sort of (well-intentioned) expression of disbelief as they recalibrate their expectations ‚Äî ‚ÄòI never would have known, he‚Äôs so intelligent, articulate, and funny!‚Äô. And they‚Äôre right, he is. Probably one of the most intelligent, articulate, and funny people I know ‚Äî our collective perception of ‚Äúwhat people with these diagnoses are like‚Äù is definitely off. For people who meet him before knowing about the stuff he has a harder time with, his witty commentary and extensive knowledge (about pretty much everything) sometimes make them less understanding ‚Äî it‚Äôs always seemed that if his struggles were more visible, people would be more eager to provide accommodation.\n\nThis phenomenon isn‚Äôt unique to my brother ‚Äî it seems that when we struggle, there‚Äôs a ‚Äòthreshold of suffering‚Äô that needs to be hit to have our needs taken seriously (by others, but also by ourselves). Having a triage system seems to be the fairest way to distribute limited resources ‚Äî we put out urgent fires, and we help people when they‚Äôve given ‚Äòsufficient proof of pain‚Äô. But this system has a really obvious flaw: no one asks for help until they‚Äôre completely falling apart, and climbing back to a good place is infinitely more difficult when you‚Äôre at the bottom of a downward spiral than when you‚Äôre just beginning to slip.\n\nIf we could articulate our needs before they became dire and urgent (or better yet, if our environments were designed to address them proactively), simple solutions might reduce a lot of suffering.\n\nBecause of this, I‚Äôm a big fan of subtle, catch-all inclusion efforts. Just because your struggle isn‚Äôt visible, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real. Being accommodating by default (and not making people explain themselves or prove the extent of their pain to ‚Äòearn‚Äô accommodations) feels like both the right thing to do and a lot less to keep track of.\n\nThat being said, I usually struggle to apply the understanding and accommodation I give to others to myself. After 21 years of ‚Äòtoughing it out‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine, my struggles aren‚Äôt bad enough to warrant doing anything‚Äô, I got diagnosed with ADHD too. I also sought therapy for some Anxiety problems I was dealing with.\n\nAt this point, the sibling scoreboard is looking something like this:\n\nIf you‚Äôre starting to think that the diagnoses are getting a bit out of hand and maybe we should just stop going to psychologists, maybe you‚Äôre right. ü§°\n\nBut I know it‚Äôs not just us. Critics are suspicious of the recent and dramatic rise in the percentage of the population diagnosed with ADHD, Autism, and Anxiety, but I think something else is up. People are visibly struggling more than they used to, and I know they‚Äôre not exaggerating because I see it around me every day. More on this later.\n\nADHD & Me <3\n\nThe classic ADHD trope is the hyperactive-11-year-old-boy-who-can‚Äôt-sit-still-in-class. Because of that, it never occurred to me that things I was struggling with fell under the ADHD umbrella until coming to university ‚Äî for the first time ever, I had an audience of friends and roommates witnessing the elaborate behind-the-scenes coping mechanisms I‚Äôve always used to keep up with life.\n\nAs open-minded as I thought I was about the label, that was when it was other people‚Äôs ADHD ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt need accommodation. I was fine, I had always been fine.\n\nBut then I spent some time on the internet. I got comfortable saying ‚Äúso true‚Äù and chuckling at internet blogs titled ‚ÄúLiving with adult ADHD as a 25-year-old woman‚Äù, and for an entire school term (Fall 2023), I decided to let the at-this-point-i‚Äôm-pretty-sure-I-have-ADHD take the wheel.\n\nThis meant leaning into wherever my energy took me (regardless of what I was actually supposed to be doing), but this time doing it with intention. This strategy‚Ä¶ kind of worked? I felt lighter and happier ‚Äî once I stopped resisting, I was able to reclaim a lot of the daily effort that was spent trying to forcibly wrangle my brain to focus on the task at hand. Instead, I used a variety of strategies (e.g. ‚Äògoing to class A so I could ignore it in the background while reading the lectures of class B, and vice versa ‚Äô) to do the best I could with the energy I had in any given moment.\n\nAt this point I still never intended to seek accommodation or medication ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt want to have an unfair advantage over classmates, and I did NOT want to be dependent on a drug to be functional. But then I started to dream ‚Äî of a world where *maybe* I could cook an egg from start to finish without forgetting I was cooking the egg. Maybe instead of doodling, reading lectures from other classes, and answering 15+ emails to stay awake during class, I could just‚Ä¶ listen. The thing I wanted more than anything was to feel like myself when in my apartment or at home with my parents ‚Äî for as long as I can remember, any time I‚Äôve entered these less-stimulating environments, I'd be hit with a huge wave of drowsiness and fall asleep without fail, at any time of day.\n\nAfter sitting through my first lecture on an extremely low dose of medication, I looked down at my notes and realized they weren‚Äôt half-complete and covered with doodles. My eyelids weren‚Äôt heavy, and I didn‚Äôt get sidetracked 5 minutes into the lecture. Once it went quiet, I realized that the reason I hummed incessantly for 21 years was because I had both an internal monologue and an internal song playing in my head during all waking hours. I called my parents and sobbed ‚Äî I could imagine a whole life ahead of me where I could set a plan and then do the plan, catching distractions hurled my way and consciously placing them aside to be methodically addressed at a later time.\n\nTo this day, I feel most like myself when I grab breakfast on my way out the door & come home only when I‚Äôm ready to sleep ‚Äî meaning I‚Äôm typically out of the house from around 9 am to 11 pm. Despite this, medication has upgraded my bedroom from a glorified storage facility to a place where I can occasionally actually hang out. The exhaustion and energy slumps that come from constantly fighting my brain are now less aggressive, and I can usually make it through the day without a daily nap üòé.\n\nI was worried that on medication I might stop feeling like myself, but I actually feel more like myself than ever before‚Äî the now-definitely-diagnosed-ADHD has been demoted from the driver‚Äôs seat and I am at the wheel üòé. It‚Äôs still there, providing colourful backseat-driver commentary, but now I can turn around and say ‚Äúhey! let‚Äôs play the quiet game‚Äù.\n\nWhile observing me spend 7+ hours completely dialled into editing a video or an essay still tends to be alarming for friends and roommates, I‚Äôm now aware of the time passing and I‚Äôm making a conscious decision to keep going (not necessarily healthy, but nice! ü§°). I feel a sense of peace knowing that moments of true focus won‚Äôt be rare and fleeting ‚Äî I can choose to take a break from work and come back to it later, and don‚Äôt fear letting a golden 4 a.m. opportunity slip through my fingers. Tomorrow will be another day.\n\nSame symptoms, different stories ü§îüí≠\n\nAs we get older, my brother and I get better at articulating our experiences. More and more often, I hear him describing things I‚Äôve felt but haven‚Äôt had the words for ‚Äî he has a head start on me when it comes to accepting and understanding ADHD, and while I spent a lot of my early years trying to help him adapt to environments and overcome some of his obstacles, I now find that he‚Äôs the first one I want to call as I deal with mine. I can‚Äôt overstate how growing up with him has helped me (both proactively and retroactively) to deal with my own stuff.\n\nAs I realize how similar we are, it becomes increasingly absurd to me that I‚Äôve lived a life labelled ‚Äògifted‚Äô while my brother has been labelled as having ‚Äòneurodevelopmental disorders‚Äô. Almost every intense, interesting, and successful person I know shows signs of adhd-giftedness-autism-anxiety-depression (whether it‚Äôs diagnosed or not). Clinically, the high rate of multiple diagnoses across these 'disorders' is called ‚Äòco-morbidity‚Äô, but I‚Äôve come to think of it as a spectrum that encompasses the question ‚ÄúHow sensitive are you to the world around you?‚Äù\n\nToo much of this conversation is often focused around the question of ‚Äòhow do we eliminate your sensitivity so we can make you more like everyone else?‚Äô, and not ‚Äòhow can we design environments and equip you with tools so you can channel your sensitivity productively?‚Äô.\n\nSensitivity cannot be separated from the hyperfixation and creativity that have resulted in some of the most important innovations we have today. While accommodations definitely help those with ADHD and Autism succeed in the world we live in (resulting in less anxiety and depression). I think ‚Äòtrying to find a cure‚Äô would actually be a huge disservice to society.\n\n‚ÄòGifted‚Äô is the story of someone with above-average-sensitivity that‚Äôs grown up in a well-designed environment and been equipped with tools to harness it.\n\nAnxiety and depression are what happens when we fail to realize this.\n\nA new story: the Sensitivity-to-the-world Scale.\n\nI present the Sensitivity-to-the-world Scale.\n\nBased on where you find yourself along the sensitivity scale, you may perceive the same environment very differently than someone else. You may be highly sensitive to the emotions of others, people talking, loud music, random interesting things on the street, rustling paper noises, flickering / too bright / too dim lighting, and itchy clothes. On the flip side, you might be sensitive to random intrusive thoughts and struggle in slow-paced environments because your brain decides to go off exploring on its own.\n\nIf you‚Äôre on the highly sensitive end of the scale, your Sensitivity Meter gets overloaded at a lower threshold, so to prevent overloading and having a meltdown you may have developed some strategies to turn down the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù. These typically fall into the buckets of blocking it out (noise cancelling headphones, closing your eyes, retreating to less stimulating environments, having alone time) or tuning it out (humming, fidgeting, listening to white noise, sitting in environments with background activity).\n\nUnder this framework, it becomes pretty easy to explain why ‚ÄúEveryone has ADHD these days‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think I have ADHD!‚Äù is a lot more common commentary than it used to be. We‚Äôre all working with the same sensitivity thresholds as we had 10, 100, and 1000 years ago, but in a very short window of time, we‚Äôve had the volume (across every domain) cranked up. We‚Äôre not becoming more sensitive, the world is getting louder and more stimulating ‚Äî it‚Äôs no surprise that more and more of us are cracking and dealing with the negative consequences of not having the tools to deal with environments that are not built for us anymore.\n\nOfficial labels are still important.\n\nSo why don‚Äôt we all just use this Sensitivity-to-the-world Scale and forget about getting officially diagnosed? Labels spur a variety of emotions and perceptions that are often unhelpful, maybe we‚Äôd all be better off just solving our problems independently.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen, there are two major reasons official diagnoses are important:\n\nUnderstanding yourself through connecting with people like you\n\nArticulating the environments and accommodations you need to be successful\n\nIn my opinion, those two reasons are significant enough to continue with labels.\n\nThat being said, I think reluctance around labelling ourselves in the name of ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine, I don‚Äôt have a disability‚Äô or ‚Äònot wanting to have an unfair advantage‚Äô etc. is a barrier that prevents a lot of people from learning about themselves, sharing their experiences, and exploring and articulating the environments and accommodations that could help them be the best versions of themselves."
