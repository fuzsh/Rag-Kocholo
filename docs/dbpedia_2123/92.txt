Artful Dodger's brand of two-step garage beat was in many ways the archetypal sound of 2000. As well as writing a string of hits for artists such as Craig David and Romina Johnson, these classically-trained DJs' slickly-crafted beats gave them three best-selling singles of their own. Now the Southampton duo have finally released their debut album, and it's well worth the wait. Effectively a series of collaborations with largely unknown vocalists, It's All About The Stragglers has the feel of a greatest hits compilation. While the formula does become a little repetitive after a while, the sheer variety of instrumentation on show and the inventive use of loops and samples makes this a surefire pop hit.
