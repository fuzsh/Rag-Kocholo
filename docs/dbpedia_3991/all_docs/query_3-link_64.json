Each member has had the use of the records from a Wednesday to a Monday, and the children's reception of them has been varied but good.

Older children chose the \" Traumerei \" and the \" Garden Melody\" as their favourites.\n\nIt will be possible to form two groups of members for the Mozart records next term, and P.N.E.U. members who have not already asked for the records should write as soon as possible to Miss E. Cholmondeley, Parents' Union School, Ambleside. The cost of the records will not be more than 2/6 for each member.\n\n[But in another term, they did not offer the records because they preferred the students to hear live music. After the records had been passed around in the UK, they could be sent to PUS students overseas, so those students sometimes worked a term behind for composer study.]\n\nBooks About Composers\n\nOpal Wheeler composer biographies have been republished by Zeezok Publishing.
