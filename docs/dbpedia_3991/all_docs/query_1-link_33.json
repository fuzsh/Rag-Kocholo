        "text": "When I think of my college days and the amount of time spent on research and writing, I think of the how I wouldn‚Äôt have survived it all without the help of my dear friend, Wikipedia (and to all the wonderful contributors pouring their efforts into ensuring that all the data you and I take from their pages are as accurate as possible). Contributing content to Wikipedia can seriously save someone‚Äôs (academic and/or fandom) life. So, yes, thank you, Wikipedia contributors! üôÇ\n\nI‚Äôve honestly been wondering how it feels like to be a Wikipedia contributor. I‚Äôve been lurking around the cyber-halls of Wikipedia for years, but never really got to try contributing anything to the site. Curiosity suddenly got the better of me tonight when I noticed that the Wikipedia page of my newfound obsession lacked content on his credits and awards. It was then and there when I felt compelled to do something and contribute my own knowledge to the Wikipedia database.\n\nSo I did the most rationale thing an obsessed fan of Christian Borle would do‚ÄìI created a Wikipedia account and started editing his page content to include his Theatre Credits and Awards received:\n\nTheatre Credits\n\nYear Production Location/Category Role 2012 Peter and the Starcatcher Broadway Black Stache (Original Broadway Cast) 2011 Off-Broadway Black Stache 2010 Angels in America Off-Broadway Prior Walter 2009 Peter and the Starcatcher Regional Black Stache Mary Poppins Broadway Bert (Replacement) 2008 On the Town Concert Ozzie 2007 Legally Blonde Broadway Emmett Forrest (Original Broadway Cast) 2005 The Flamingo Kid Workshop Performer Spamalot Broadway Historian / Not Dead Fred / French Guard / Minstrel / Prince Herbert (Original Broadway Cast) 2004 Snoopy!

Wikipedia does take the intellectual property rights clause seriously. You can‚Äôt just put or upload anything there without a reliable source. Heck, you have to cite your sources ALL the time‚Äìunless it‚Äôs already public knowledge.\n\nContribute to something that greatly interests you. It can help spark inspiration to provide the best information to the public.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs definitely time-consuming, it can be quite enjoyable‚Äìespecially when digging up some historical information on your topic of choice. In my case, since there wasn‚Äôt a complete list of Christian Borle‚Äôs credits and awards, I had to browse through several sites to consolidate them all into tables for people to digest and appreciate. The trickier ones were the lesser-known ones. After consolidating the data, I remembered having to double, triple, and quadruple check to verify the accuracy of my research.\n\nResearching for Wikipedia is like going on an archaeological find. Along the road to research, you may manage to excavate precious and rare artifacts, such as this little piece of gem of a photo of the 1997-1998 U.S. National Tour for West Side Story (I had to sort of restore the photo though. The wonders of photo restoration through Photoshop make it better to appreciate it. Yay!)\n\nI also found some cool info about him (that he wanted to become a comic book artist, since he‚Äôs such a comic book geek), which I also included in the ‚Äúearly days‚Äù portion.\n\nCoding tables and placing information on them can be confusing at first, but once you‚Äôve got the hang of it, it admittedly becomes one of the more fun stuff to put on Wikipedia pages.\n\nNever knew how contributing to Wikipedia could be so fun. I‚Äôd like to do it again sometime. Maybe when I have more time and another topic of interest? üòâ"
