        "text": "Town in Hesse, Germany\n\nObertshausen (German: [oː.bɛʁt͡s.ˈhaʊ̯.zn̩] ⓘ) is a town in the Offenbach district in the Regierungsbezirk in the state of Hessen, Germany. It has around 24,000 inhabitants.\n\nObertshausen is one of 13 towns and municipalities in the Offenbach district. The town lies in the thickly wooded eastern part of the Rhine-Main lowland south of the Main and southeast of Frankfurt am Main and Offenbach am Main at an elevation of 112 m above sea level. Southwest of the town is found Darmstadt, the seat of the like-named Regierungsbezirk. To the northeast lies the town of Hanau (Main-Kinzig-Kreis). Obertshausen lies in the southern part of Hesse, not far from the Odenwald and the Spessart.\n\nThe municipal area stretches over 13.7 km2, of which 7.8 km2 is woodland, open land and cropland\n\nObertshausen borders in the northwest on the district-free city of Offenbach am Main with its outlying centres of Bieber and Tempelsee, in the north on the town of Mühlheim (centre of Lämmerspiel), in the northeast on the town of Hanau (Main-Kinzig-Kreis) with its outlying centres of Steinheim and Klein-Auheim, in the east on the community of Hainburg, in the southeast on the town of Rodgau (centre of Weiskirchen) and in the southwest on the town of Heusenstamm.\n\nObertshausen's Stadtteile are Obertshausen and Hausen, each of which has roughly the same population.\n\nIn 865, Obertshausen had its first documentary mention under the name Oberdueshuson in a paper from the Benedictine monastery at Seligenstadt as one of the monastery's landholdings. In 1069, Heinrich IV donated to Saint Jacob's Monastery in Mainz some newly cleared land in the Wildbann Dreieich (a royal hunting forest). The land lay near the village of Hyson in the Maingau. At this time, the Lords of Hagenhausen-Eppstein exercised lordly rights (Hoheitsrechte) in Obertshausen and Hausen. In Obertshausen stood a moated castle shaped like a defensive tower, called the Burgk im Hayn (or Burg im Hayn in modern German spelling). The Lords of Hausen, a sideline of those of Hagenhausen, once had holdings here.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, feudal lords changed very often. The Lords of Eppstein, Ullrich von Hanau and Archbishop Conrad III of Mainz were some of the land's owners. In 1425, Hausen and Obertshausen, as part of the Amt of Steinheim, w sold by the Lords of Eppstein to Electoral Mainz. The Thirty Years' War and the Plague in 1636 took a heavy toll on the population.\n\nIn 1664, Archbishop Johann Philipp of Mainz sold his brother Philipp Erwin of Schönborn the two villages for 9,000 Gulden. In 1806, the Schönborn Amt of Heusenstamm with Hausen and Obertshausen was mediatized into the Principality of Isenburg, which was in turn mediatised ten years later. Both places then passed with the Isenburg Amt of Offenbach to the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and as of 1945, to the state of Hesse. From the Middle Ages until 1819, Obertshausen and Hausen belonged to the Biebermark, an area held in common with several other villages. In 1819, the Biebermark was divided among the member villages.\n\nIn 1896, the Offenbach-Dieburg railway opened with a railway station in Obertshausen.\n\nIn the course of municipal reform in Hesse, the two formerly self-administering communities of Obertshausen and Hausen were merged. At first, the new community was named Hausen. On 1 January 1978, however, it was named Obertshausen. The two centres are separated from each other by Bundesstraße 448. On 29 September 1979, the Hesse state government granted Obertshausen town rights.\n\nIn 1576 there were 10 households in Hausen and 27 in Obertshausen. In 1834, Hausen's population had risen to 444 and Obertshausen's to 554. These figures have risen to many times these old levels over the years since then. By 1939, the figures had become 2,034 and 2,444 respectively. On 30 June 2007, the town as a whole had 25,314 inhabitants, of whom 12,668 lived in Hausen and 12,646 in Obertshausen.\n\nInhabitants (each time as at 31 December)\n\n1998 – 24,522\n\n1999 – 24,577\n\n2000 – 24,658\n\n2001 – 24,676\n\n2002 – 24,521\n\n2003 – 24,484\n\n2004 – 24,532\n\n2005 – 25,434\n\n2006 – 24,210\n\nThe municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:\n\nParties and voter communities %\n\n2006 Seats\n\n2006 %\n\n2001 Seats\n\n2001 CDU Christian Democratic Union of Germany 49.9 18 51.8 19 SPD Social Democratic Party of Germany 19.3 7 25.6 10 GREENS Bündnis 90/Die Grünen 10.3 4 9.9 4 FDP Free Democratic Party 10.6 4 6.3 2 Bürger Bürger für Obertshausen 9.9 4 6.3 2 Total 100.0 37 100.0 37 Voter turnout in % 42.5 51.0\n\nMayoral elections take place in Obertshausen every six years. The most recent mayors were:[1]\n\n2002–2014: Bernd Roth (CDU)\n\n2014–2020: Roger Winter (independent)\n\n2020–incumbent: Manuel Friedrich (independent)\n\nThe town’s arms might be described thus: Party per fess abased dancetty of three, gules a lion passant crowned Or, his paws on the peaks of the parting, argent in base an oak sprig with two leaves and one acorn vert.\n\nThe town's flag has a white field in the middle flanked by a red stripe at each side, and in the upper half are the town's arms.\n\nHeimatmuseum at Karl-Mayer-Haus with permanent and changing exhibits on local history.\n\nAt the Hausen Bürgerhaus (community centre), mainly in the winter months, theatrical and cabaret productions regularly take place.\n\nIn the session chamber at the Town Hall on Beethovenstraße, except during summer holidays, older films are shown fortnightly for children and youth.\n\nWith the Hausen Bürgerhaus and the Obertshausen multipurpose hall, there are venues for major events and concerts at the town's disposal.\n\nHausener Marktplatz (marketplace) with its artwork consisting of three hands, each holding a coat of arms, both Obertshausen's, and its two earlier partner towns'.\n\nRemains of the Burg im Hain (castle)\n\nCatholic church Herz Jesu (\"Jesus's Heart\") in Obertshausen, Bahnhofstraße\n\nCatholic St. Josef-Kirche in Hausen, Seligenstädter Straße\n\nCatholic St. Pius-Kirche in Hausen, Gumbertseestraße\n\nCatholic church St. Thomas Morus in Obertshausen, Berliner Straße\n\nEvangelical Waldkirche (\"Forest Church\") in Hausen, Schönbornstraße\n\nSmall chapel in Obertshausen, Heusenstammer Straße\n\nHerz Jesu\n\nSt. Thomas Morus\n\nWaldkirche\n\nChapel\n\nWaldpark Sainte Geneviève des Bois in Hausen with children's playground and kiosk\n\nLeisure park in Obertshausen with adventure playground and ice-cream café and kiosk across the street\n\nMiniature golf course at the Hausen community centre (Bürgerhaus)\n\nThe monte mare is an outdoor swimming pool, leisure pool and sauna.

The Wiesbaden-Frankfurt-Offenbach-Rodgau-Rödermark-Ober Roden route runs through Obertshausen. At one time, Obertshausen was linked to the railway network by the Rodgaubahn. Lying right on the A 3 is Frankfurt Airport, which through the Frankfurter Kreuz can be reached in a short time, as can likewise Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport. Obertshausen benefits from its proximity to the economic hub of Frankfurt am Main and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, as well as the good transport connections.\n\nWithin the town run several buslines, among them the Offenbach route 120, which links Obertshausen to the town's other centre, Hausen, and also Mühlheim and Offenbach.\n\nFor a long time Obertshausen, alongside Offenbach am Main, was a national centre for leather goods production. Still today, there are leather goods factories that export their goods worldwide. With the decline of the leather goods industry, mechanical engineering has come to dominate the town's industry today. Many inhabitants also find jobs in nearby Frankfurt am Main. Kaufkraft [de] (purchasing power) in Obertshausen in 2003 averaged €19,315 per inhabitant, putting it at 116.3% of the countrywide average.\n\nKarl Mayer Textilmaschinenfabrik [de] (textile machine manufacturer)\n\nMagna Exterior Systems GmbH\n\nHolzland Becker GmbH & Co.
