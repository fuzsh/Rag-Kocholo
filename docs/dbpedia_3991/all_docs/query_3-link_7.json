        "text": "Can we give a date for the lead image, even if approximate?\n\nThe Bibliothèque nationale de France, from where the image comes, gives the publication date (well after Offenbach's death) but not the date it was taken. It was uploaded as from the 1860s, but an IP on the article talk page questioned this, and I concurred. I know which decade I think it's from (the 1870s), but I have no proof. Tim riley talk\n\nin Cologne, Kingdom of Prussia,: something about \"Kingdom of Prussia\" here reads oddly to me: I think it's that it's the formal/political name rather than the geographic one. Compare \"Dublin, Irish Republic\": I think we'd more naturally say \"Dublin, [then] in the Irish Republic\".\n\nI think this is all right. We often say things like \"Madras, British India\". Geographically Cologne is nowhere near Prussia though as a fall-out from the Congress of Vienna (Round 2) Prussia bagged it. Tim riley talk\n\nYes, I think \"Cologne, Prussia\" would be as wrong as \"Mauritius, France\". Happy with this. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nFrom 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor: do I take the correct implication that he was not famous as a conductor?\n\nYou do. Tim riley talk\n\nhe produced at least 18 full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces: MOS:NUM would probably like \"eighteen\" in words for consistency (plus, most style guides advise writing numbers under twenty-one in words anyway).\n\nI'm all for this and will gladly alter forthwith, but my impression is that most guides go for words up to ten and then digits thereafter. Tim riley talk\n\nWhy do we give the title of The Tales of Hoffmann in English but most of the others (e.g. Orphée aux enfers) in French?\n\nI should gladly give them all in French, but our WP article uses the English title. So, I admit, does our article on Orphée aux enfers, but usage is more finely balanced for that title, whereas in fifty-odd years of opera-going I have never heard any English speaker speak of \"Les contes d'Hoffmann\". Tim riley talk\n\nHis works from this period included: I would use the present tense here, as his works from this period still include these things -- the past tense to me implies that the situation changed.\n\nQuite right. Will alter. Tim riley talk\n\nStruck off on the 2 December 1834: presumably, this was written in French, which uses the definite article here: English generally doesn't.\n\nNot sure that's entirely true, but we can certainly omit the article if wanted. Tim riley talk\n\nSome of Offenbach's early compositions were played by the fashionable conductor Louis Antoine Jullien.: what does played mean in this context -- I'm not sure that conductors generally play music (rather than, well, conducting it), unless he was doing so in his free time?\n\nHa! How funny you add this. Please see my comments on this very point in answer to Gog the Mild above. Tim riley talk\n\nHappy to defer to a WP:HQRS here, then. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nOffenbach as a young cello virtuoso, drawing by Alexandre Laemlein from 1850: I would use a colon rather than a comma here, as he isn't drawing in the picture.\n\nHmm. Very well. Tim riley talk\n\nthe work was exceptionally well received: to me, exceptionally sets up a high bar, given that it's taken as read that this is going to be a work from the top tier of its genre: I'm not totally convinced that the body text really indicates that its reception was exceptionally positive (that is, remarkable even by the standards of beloved operas).\n\nIt would be properly described as a smash-hit, but that's a bit informal for the dignified prose of our encyclopaedia. Tim riley talk\n\nI don't disagree, but I'm still not sure the body text is quite as effusive as the lead. I'd be happier if we had some way of comparing it against other very-well-received shows. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThe first production ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 – although it was still performing strongly at the box-office – \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\". Tim riley talk\n\nBrilliant: that first fact in particular would be an excellent addition to the article body. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nIt's in the article on the opera (I put it there). My feeling is that it's a bit too detailed for the Life-and-Works article, but I am biddable. Tim riley talk\n\nUp to you: my concern here is simply MOS:LEAD, that the phrasing of exceptionally well-received in the lead is not a reflection of what's currently in the body. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nVery well! Done Tim riley talk\n\nPer MOS:NEE, the word should be linked on at least first use: using the template would help here.\n\nStrangely I have had, above, a precisely opposite view, contending, rightly I think, that né and née are now good English words. Tim riley talk\n\nThey might be, but we often explain or link terms that might be unknown to some readers, even if familiar to most. The MoS is pretty clear here: for name changes due to marriage, they may also use née (feminine) and né (masculine) followed by the surname, provided the term is linked at first occurrence. (emphasis mine). I'm not sure I can wear an IAR argument here that's simply \"we don't like what the MoS says\": as far as I can see, there's no consideration at work here that wouldn't apply to all articles using the term. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nOK. Done. Tim riley talk\n\nIsaac ... needed all his eloquence to persuade Cherubini even to give Jacob an audition: this is nicely written, but feels a bit flowery for me in an encyclopaedia.\n\nI'd gladly consider an alternative phrasing if you suggest one. Tim riley talk\n\nPersonally, I'd go for something really boring like \"Isaac persuaded Cherubini to give Jacob an audition\", and then explain, as we have here, why he took persuading. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nOK. Done. Tim riley talk\n\nThe boy's age and nationality were both obstacles to admission: I'm not sure I quite understand the significance of the nationality here, given the footnote that immediately follows, and the fact that Cherubini was quite clearly not French.\n\nI don't know if Cherubini himself had French nationality, but the question was whether aspirants who were foreign and under age could be admitted. Tim riley talk\n\nRight, but we immediately follow with a footnote saying Yon notes that ... foreign nationality ... was not such an obstacle to enrolment as a student. Either the body text or the footnote seems to be overstating the degree to which nationality was or wasn't a problem. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nthe comtesse de Vaux: should she have a link (perhaps an ILL), and even a name?\n\nI don't know. What would you suggest? Tim riley talk\n\nI was hoping you or your sources would know who she was (beyond the title), but perhaps not. French Wikipedia (whose article on Offenbach seems to be simply a translation of this one) doesn't seem to know or have much for us to work with. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nHow very flattering if the French WP article is just ours translated! Faris and Harding both mention the comtesse's salons and her support of Offenbach (Harding hints, without substantiating, that her interest in her protégé may have been thought by some to be more than musical) but that's all they say about her. Yon says that she was the sister of one of France's leading notaries, Edme Ernest Foucher, but that's all I can find. Tim riley talk\n\nAh: that would make her this lady (Sophie née Foucher), who was indeed comtesse de Vaux. If you can read German, there's a bit on her on p45 here. I think at least getting her actual name in would be useful, as many people have held that title and none of them are particularly famous by it (as opposed to, say, Lord Byron -- in most normal cases we'd name e.g. the Prince of Wales in addition to the title). UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nRead German? Up to a point, Lord Copper. Frightful language, did it up to O-level and vowed never to tangle with it again. But you're right and I'll add her given name to the text. Done, and Schwarz added to sources. Tim riley talk\n\n12:52, 15 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nHérminie d'Alcain (1827–1887): per MOS:BIRTHDATE, we shouldn't use people's dates like this in body text: if her age is important, give it and explain. On which -- we haven't been specific on the date of their meeting: it sounds like she might have been twelve, which makes \"they fell in love\" a little suspect/sanitising to me: a relationship between a twelve-year-old child and a twenty-year-old cannot be simply written up as mutual romance.\n\nAnother MoS diktat I was unaware of. I'll remove the dates. We don't know when they met, but no source suggests she was as young as you suppose. Tim riley talk\n\nI think we've implied at least the possibility, through having this sentence immediately follow Among the salons at which Offenbach most frequently appeared, from 1839,, and precede one about the \"early 1840s\": it sounds as if he met her circa 1839, when she was circa 12. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nAfter a further trawl through the sources I find that Yon says she was fifteen when they first met. Added. Tim riley talk\n\nShould Mendelssohn get a first name?\n\nI'd say no, any more than Mozart does. Some top creative artists need no full-naming (cf Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni and Dante Alighieri et al.) Tim riley talk\n\nHm: I see the case here, where the person is overwhelmingly known only by the single name (Michelangelo being an excellent example), and a longer name would be less recognisable. I'm less happy when they're simply so famous that most people can recognise them by surname (Einstein, Kennedy, Churchill...) To me, \"Felix Mendelssohn\" is just as recognisable, if not more so, than \"Mendelssohn\" (in a way that Michelangelo's full name isn't, or a longer title for Muhammad, Augustus, Madonna etc), and using just the surname on first mention feels as though we're reminding the reader of a mutual friend: in other words, assuming that they have a certain degree/set of prior knowledge, which goes against the general principle of writing for the enthusiastic layperson. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThat would put this article at odds with the already featured articles on other French composers – Hector Berlioz, Pierre Boulez, Gabriel Fauré, Jules Massenet, André Messager, Francis Poulenc, Maurice Ravel, Camille Saint-Saëns – in which when referring to well-known composers' music the surname alone is generally used. (When the composer as a person is mentioned we usually give the forename, as in the second para of the lead chez Gabriel Fauré.) It is perhaps worth noting that the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and Encyclopaedia Britannica, written presumably for enthusiastic laypersons, do much the same as we do in the above articles. Tim riley talk\n\nHm: I am not entirely happy here, but willing to defer to established practice. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nRereading the article I have spotted a few places where it's the chap and not his music we're talking about, and I have added their forenames. Tim riley talk\n\nI realise that the approach to linking here is generally to err on the side of sparseness, but I would certainly link at least Victoria and Albert, and consider linking the titles of the Tsar and the King to the articles on those respective people.\n\nDone. We used to have a rule forbidding links from within quotations and the habit has stayed with me. Tim riley talk\n\nThe use of \"Herr\" rather than \"Monsieur\", : suggest cutting rather than Monsieur, as we don't actually know that this was the (only) other option considered: the paper could just as well have written \"Mr.\". Perhaps clarify \"the German Herr for readers who don't know it as such.\n\nRemoved Monsieur. As to \"Herr\" I don't think anyone will need that explaining. Tim riley talk\n\nI know I've quoted it a lot, but a much-cited essay advises us to assume almost nothing about readers' prior knowledge. Certainly, I find it hard to believe that there will be nobody (thinking here of children, or people from non-European parts of the world) reading this article who doesn't know that Herr is German: the cost of catering to them seems extremely small. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThe essay flies in the face of the MoS. I have pointed out above how it urges us to link what the MoS forbids us to link. I hope other editors who happen to see this will comment. As always I'll willingly go with the consensus. Tim riley talk 09:26, 15 April 2024 (UTC) Later: on reflection I think we can accommodate you without mucking up the prose. Done. Tim riley talk\n\nThe ambiguity of his nationality sometimes caused him difficulty in later life.: I'd like some brief explanation here of the sort of difficulty we mean, or perhaps for this to be delayed until it does cause him some problems.\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\ndespite some extramarital dalliances on Offenbach's part: Dalliances reads as slightly exculpatory to me.\n\nWell, he was a French composer. As far as I can see Bizet was about the only one faithful to his wife. But redrawn. Tim riley talk 08:49, 15 April 2024 (UTC) Later: Oh, and Massenet I think, despite gossip. Tim riley talk\n\nNote 43 (De Joncières): why is quoted in italics?\n\nThis seems to be a convention, and I've always followed it, but I don't mind either way and would be happy with romic if you prefer. Tim riley talk\n\nNo problem if deliberate and consistent. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nParis was convulsed by the 1848 revolution: the prose throughout is sparkly; there have been a few points where I've considered ringing the MOS:IDIOM bell, and this one to me is just on the wrong side of the line (to a second-language reader not familiar with the term, there's a real chance of confusion here). Suggest \"the 1848 revolution broke out in Paris\".\n\nVery well. Done. Tim riley talk\n\nCan we give a date and artist for File:Jacques Offenbach by Édouard Riou & Nadar.jpg? The caption is elegant but not particularly informative.\n\nWe can. Done. I didn't add the date because by 1858 Offenbach was better known as a composer than as a cellist (the drawing accompanied a potted and somewhat facetious biography of him, and evidently relates to him in the 1840s rather than at the time of publication.) Tim riley talk\n\nFair enough. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThe composer Debussy: similar to Mendelssohn above: we've acknowledged that not everyone will know his profession, so we should take that to its logical conclusion and assume that not everyone will know him at all, and therefore give his first name.\n\nAs above. As we are talking of his corporeal self rather than his music I think it is all right to give him his forename. Done Tim riley talk\n\nA question. I'm working my way through the text converting numbers from digits to words as you suggest for those up to twenty-one, but I'm not sure what to do with this sentence: \"the bride was 17 years old, and the bridegroom was 25\". What think you? Tim riley talk\n\nMOS:NUM says to use the same for both, whatever we choose: I'd be happy with either. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Words, I think. Tim riley talk\n\nCould wikilink \"satiric\" to satire, as the idea is important in the next paragraph?\n\nHmm. Seems a pretty everyday term to me. Tim riley talk\n\nIt's reasonably everyday, but not all of our readers have an \"everyday\" standard of education or English. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThat's a pretty muddle-headed article, and completely contradicts our MoS policy at MOS:OL. Linking Paris and France, forsooth! Tim riley talk\n\nPerhaps other editors would like to comment on this: I'll gladly go with the consensus. Tim riley talk\n\nLooking at MOS:LE (part of MOS:OL), the defining considerations there seem to be twofold:\n\n1) is the term likely to be known by most/all readers in context? The MoS says that the answer is no for \"microeconomics\" and \"general equilibrium theory\" in an economics article, and I can't see that readers of a music article are more likely to know about satire than readers of an economics article are to know about macroeconomics.\n\n2) Is it important that readers understand the term in context: see Consider linking \"price\" and \"goods\" only if these common words have technical dimensions that are specifically relevant to the topic. Again, here, I think the answer is fairly resolutely \"yes\": satire does have specific dimensions that are relevant to this topic.\n\nLikewise happy to defer to any consensus that evolves here. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nI added a linked [[satire]] here and then ran the OVERLINK script here: it removed the link. It may not be the perfect way to decide the issue, but it may help in breaking the deadlock... Cheers - SchroCat (talk)\n\nGosh! I'd no idea about such a resource. Thank you, SchroCat. I shall make a note of that script for future reference. Tim riley talk\n\nThe script is something of a blunt instrument: from what I can gather, it delinks satire and its forms in all articles, which is explicitly not the point of WP:OL -- the latter is clear that whether a term should be linked depends on the context and article that it's in. I think I've said my piece on this one: it's very far from an opposing matter, and like all things at FAC fundamentally a suggestion. You have often been kind enough with my articles to end on \"I'd do it differently, but I'm me and you're you\", and I'm more than happy to do the same here. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nI'd say it is very clearly MOS:OVERLINKing. I agree that \"The Pope is Catholic\" essay is very wrongheaded. All English speakers know generally what France and Paris are. Satire is a common English word, especially for anyone reading a biography in the arts. You don't have to be an expert on the intricacies of satire to have a general sense of the word, and linking to it does not shed any light at all on how Offenbach's pieces used satire, as opposed to, say Mark Twain or George Orwell did. That is really the main question for a blue-link: does it shed useful light on the topic, or is it actually a distraction from it. -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nOn his return to Cologne: is it worth being clear that things were not exactly peaceful back there, either? That might help us understand his change of name.\n\nI don't know that the 1848 uprisings all over Europe were the reason for his reverting to his original given name. It may have been simply a matter of fitting in. The sources don't say. Tim riley talk\n\nI don't necessarily mean that we should be so specific: only that it's relevant that the Cologne to which he escaped revolutionary Paris was itself a place undergoing upheaval at the time. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThat's right enough. This is from Gammond: \"Finding Cologne very little less inflamed by revolutionary passions than Paris, though not so violently manifested, Offenbach changed his christian name back to Jakob and tried to behave like a good Colognial German. He composed some patriotic German songs, of very little artistic value, for use at various political occasions and he played the cello ... at a concert given in celebration of Cologne Cathedral's six-hundredth anniversary.\" But I'm not sure it is within the scope of this article to mention the political conditions in Cologne as there is no proof that they were why he changed his name. Tim riley talk\n\nPerhaps, but Gammond at least has made an explicit link between the conditions in Cologne (not just Paris) and the name change; we've only linked it to what happened in Paris, so I think we should follow suit for WP:TSI. I also think the turn towards patriotic German music is very relevant in the context of an ongoing nationalist revolution, and both of those parts should be briefly mentioned. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nOK. Perhaps you'd suggest some wording that would satisfy you. Tim riley talk\n\nThis is quite a lot for me to suggest, and please do take your scalpel to it: your prose is far more elegant than mine. But perhaps something like Cologne was also experiencing its own nationalistic revolutionary upheaval; Offenbach changed his name back to the German \"Jakob\" [I would use the German spelling here, rather than \"Jacob\", as Gammond does]. He also composed German patriotic songs, which were sung at political events. Whether you include Gammond's negative judgement on those songs is a matter of taste, I think. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nI've given it a go. Tricky to get the flavour right. See what you think. Tim riley talk\n\nLudovic was a respectable civil servant: the word respectable makes me think WP:PUFFERY and worry about editorialising: on what are we basing it?\n\nAs the retired Librarian of the Crown Estate I contend that all civil servants are respectable. But seriously, I think the point is made by the noted fact that Halévy discreetly used pseudonyms from time to time. Tim riley talk\n\nThat's partly my point: what I think we're saying is that civil servants, by nature, were not generally to be seen writing light opera. Using the adjective, however, implies that Ludovic was a respectable civil servant in contrast to the disreputable ones, and that this distinction was the important thing. Does the source say something to the effect of \"as a civil servant, Ludovic did not want to be identified?\" UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nRedrawn. Tim riley talk\n\nHalévy wrote the libretto for one of the pieces in the opening programme: do we know its name?\n\nI could find out, but I don't think it notable. Tim riley talk\n\nAged 22, when she auditioned for him, she was engaged on the spot: perhaps consider hired or similar: I briefly thought that someone proposed to her!\n\nOh dear! A generational difference. I hate \"hired\" but will replace the - to me - natural \"engaged\" if you insist. Tim riley talk\n\nIt's not a big problem, but is there an alternative that's both accurate and palatable? UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\n\"...given the part on the spot\"? I don't think \"engaged\" is confusing here, though, and to my ear \"hired\" seems a little more appropriate for a salesperson than an artiste.... -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nThat suggestion sounds good to me. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nRedrawn. Tim riley talk\n\nIt's been a long while since we mentioned Flotow; I'd give his first name again, and perhaps reintroduce his connection with Offenbach.\n\nDo you mean in the Orphée section? I don't think so. Tim riley talk\n\nhe was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon: the Napoleon is so famous mononymously that I'd give the numeral here.\n\nI dither about this and will ponder. Tim riley talk\n\nNow given his III throughout. Tim riley talk 10:28, 16 April 2024 (UTC) Tangentially, as a collector of tongue twisters I am grateful for \"mononymously\", which gives \"sphygmomanometer\" a run for its money. Tim riley talk\n\na chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur: I know it's the \"proper\" title, but as this is the English Wikipedia, any reason not to use the standard translation of \"knight\"?\n\nI don't think chevalier and knight are exact synonyms. In English, knight sounds rather posh but in French it is the lowest order of the Légion d'honneur.\n\nI personally know a chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur, and he most certainly would not want us to translate it in his article. -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nthis appointment scandalised those haughty and exclusive members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera: is haughty quite NPOV? Presumably these people had what felt to them legitimate reasons for their resentment. We can always say \"those whom Faris has called...\" if we want to report the opinion without throwing the authority of Wikivoice behind it.\n\nCaught red handed! I hoped to get away with this, which is a quotation of Pooh-Bah in The Mikado. Trying my luck, truth to tell. I'll redraw. Tim riley talk\n\nIt needed no inadvertent boost from Janin: I would cut this: I feel the authorial voice is becoming a little too personal/essayistic rather than encyclopaedic here. On the other hand, if Janin pointedly refused to review it, that's interesting and another matter.\n\nI don't agree. It seems to me reasonable to mention that after two Janin pannings a third wasn't needed for success. Tim riley talk\n\nAre we seriously suggesting that the first two both needed a Janin panning to be successful? I can wear it for Orpheus, but we've presented it as the icing on the cake with Helene rather than the critical ingredient. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nWe have said so in the preceding paragraph. Tim riley talk\n\nincluded the King of Prussia: as with our French countess earlier, I'd give his name, and perhaps introduce him as \"the future German emperor Wilhelm I\", given that he's quite famous under that title. Mousing over the link was something of an \"Easter Egg\" for me.\n\nLink changed. Tim riley talk\n\nhis home in Étretat: I'd clarify that this was in Normandy (and therefore reasonably far from the likely lines of German advance).\n\nOK.\n\nThe idiom \"did good/better business\" seems to be coming up a lot: perhaps look to vary it a little?\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nand, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide : I think the hierarchy here is clearer if we put dashes after and and records instead of commas. What does Keck mean by \"exceptionally\": for Offenbach, or for everyone else?\n\nThe former, I think. Happy for you to repunctuate if you wish. Tim riley talk\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nInteresting that the only comment on compositional method comes from a set of CD notes: has anyone else talked about this? More generally, it's a very short section: I wonder if it could be combined with \"Texts and word setting\", perhaps under the \"Compositional methods\" heading.\n\nThe CD notes are by Keck, who is generally seen as the greatest present-day authority on Offenbach. I'm happy with the paragraphing. I hate cramming two different topics into one for the sake of bulk. Tim riley talk\n\na \"Litanie\",: I don't think we generally use italics within quote marks, though these are scare quotes, on which the MoS is frustratingly silent (except to discourage them under MOS:\"). Could simply translate -- I don't think too much is gained by using the French here?\n\nI disagree. The French was being used in the hope of bamboozling the local authorities. The inverted commas are not there to scare anyone, merely to indicate that the term was bogus. Tim riley talk\n\nOK, that's fair enough. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nI would link Ave Maria.\n\nDone but with reservations. People may click on it expecting a link to a vocal piece by Offenbach rather than to the RC prayer the Hail Mary. Tim riley talk\n\nNote 25 seems quite interesting and relevant to Offenbach's biography -- the immediate reaction of his family to his death and the fate of his works are both germane here. I'd be inclined to promote it, especially as the paragraph it ends is currently pretty skinny.\n\nDone.\n\nas a homage: an homage, surely, as it's pronounced without the h (like an hour)?\n\nI didn't write this bit, and like you I'd have used \"an\", but I've checked with the OED and the English pronunciation gets the thumbs-up and so \"a\" is OK. Tim riley talk\n\nVery well! UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nWe seem to be a bit inconsistent in the footnotes as to whether the titles of web pages (and possibly other types of source) are captialised.\n\nI think web pages should be italicised. If you spot any that aren't I'll do the necessary. Tim riley talk\n\nSorry - misread your comment. On the whole we should follow the ulc of the page, I think. Tim riley talk\n\nMOS:CONFORMTITLE advises the opposite: that we pick a consistent style for e.g. website articles, books, periodicals and so forth, and then render all such sources in that style. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nFair enough. If you spot any inconsistencies in the ulc of websites in the references, pray mention them. Tim riley talk\n\nMight want to introduce Nietzsche and Zola, as they're notable but not as authorities on opera.\n\nDone. Tim riley talk 09:17, 16 April 2024 (UTC)talk:UndercoverClassicist|T]]·C\n\nSo is Orpheus in the Underworld and Belle Hélène.: did he reflect in English? If not, suggest using the French title for Orpheus, as we've done so throughout.\n\nImpossible to answer, I fear. In Conversations with Klemperer by Peter Heyworth some of the interviews were in English and some in German, translated into English by Heyworth for the book. We are not told the language in which Alan Blyth interviewed Klemperer. I think we must treat the English version as the ipsissima verba. Tim riley talk\n\nI think the content of note 29 (the critical reception of The Tales of Hoffmann) is important and deserves to be in the body text of a Reception section.\n\nOK. Tim riley talk\n\nThere's quite a lot of the F-P war section riding on a Guardian article. I don't necessarily have a problem with it, but is there no more academic source we can use here, perhaps in addition?\n\nI'm happy with the source. So is the source reviewer. Tim riley talk\n\nof the Gaiety Theatre: perhaps clarify that this was in the West End, as Offenbach has been there previously?\n\nWest End added. Tim riley talk\n\nAt the Royalty Theatre: similarly, it might be worth clarifying that this was in Soho, and so wasn't in the West End (and so was it perhaps less fashionable/more seedy?)\n\nIt would not be true. The West End was just as seedy for the most part. It is arguably pushing it to mention the West End at all. The term wasn't generally used for London's theatre district in Offenbach's day. Tim riley talk\n\nFair enough (no objection to pushing it that far, personally). UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nIn Vienna, too, Offenbach works: Offenbach's?\n\nLooks all right to me. One talks of Beethoven Symphonies, Verdi operas etc. Tim riley talk\n\nI think we should italicise The Beautiful Galatea, as the title of an opera.\n\nSo do I. It may be the lang template buggering it up. Tim riley talk\n\nI see now what you meant. I don't think we usually ulc or italicise translations of titles. Not sure why not, but the format here is pretty standard as far as I know. Tim riley talk\n\nboth Gilbert and Sullivan follow the lead of Les brigands (1869) in their treatment of the police, plodding along ineffectually in heavy march-time: I think we mean the police here, but as written it sounds like Gilbert and Sullivan did the plodding. Suggest \"who plod...\"\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nHowever much the young Sullivan...: one-sentence paragraphs aren't ideal: I think this one could be merged into the paragraph before. Its first clause could be trimmed a little to avoid making an unduly long paragraph in the process, if you like.\n\nIt isn't a one-sentence paragraph, and as I say above I dislike lumping together sentences that don't belong together for the sake of avoiding short paragraphs. Tim riley talk\n\nEntirely reasonable. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nmore human romantic interest: what does more human mean in this context? Perhaps relatedly, I'm not clear whether there was more [human romantic interest], or whether the romantic interest that there was became more human.\n\nBoth. It's contrasting with the gods and mythical personages of the earlier works. Tim riley talk\n\njust before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870: I'd specify that the war broke out in July. Do we know how \"just\" before his return was?\n\nNot offhand. I might be able to dig it out if I was persuaded it was important. Tim riley talk\n\nas the guest of the Prince of Wales.: you can probably guess my comment here - I'd name him.\n\nA bit unidiomatic. He was, like our present monarch, always known just as the P o W. Tim riley talk\n\nWell, yes, but many people are known as e.g. the Pope, the Vicar, the Headmaster, the Chef, etc etc, in contexts where it's perfectly obvious to everyone around which one of those is meant. However, it's not obvious here that the PoW is Edward except to readers who happen to know the dates of British monarchs, which isn't all of them. As with all of these things, a matter of taste, but I think a guest of Edward, Prince of Wales is completely idiomatic. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nFrom a quick check I think I am right in saying that he's just \"the Prince of Wales\" (or the \"prince de Galles\") in all the main sources. Tim riley talk\n\nHis spectacular revival: what about it, exactly, was spectacular? There's an ambiguity here between \"really lavish\" and \"really good\": I suspect the former is the main intention even if the latter may not be untrue.\n\nFor the 1874 production Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate opéra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act opéra féerie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Théâtre de la Gaîté on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre. During the first run of the revised version Offenbach expanded it even further, adding ballets illustrating the kingdom of Neptune in Act 3 and bringing the total number of scenes in the four acts to twenty-two. I don't understand your mention of \"really lavish\" and \"really good\" as neither of those terms is used in the text. Tim riley talk\n\nI was querying the specific meaning of spectacular here: does it mean \"that opera was very expensive!\" or \"that opera was very good!\". As we're clearly going for both, I'm not sure there's a problem here: whatever the reader concludes, they're right. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThe local authorities were not deceived, and the concert did not take place: do we know if they explicitly stopped it, or if Offenbach simply thought better of his plans?\n\nNot really. The source says \"But the Philadelphians were very strict about Sunday observance and severely censored his intentions. Although handbills had been printed the Sacred Concert never took place—much to Offenbach’s regret\" Tim riley talk\n\nLater: found one! The authorities stopped it. Now added. Tim riley talk\n\nHe returned to France in July 1876, with profits that were handsome but not spectacular: any idea of roughly how much money we're talking about here?\n\nNo. Tim riley talk\n\n(l. to r.) : in all the other captions, we've spelt out: if brevity is felt to be essential here, you could use the abbreviation template, even though it is fairly obvious in context.\n\nCould you be a little more explicit about what you're talking about? Tim riley talk\n\nAh, the penny's dropped. No, I think it's all right as it is. Consistency is admirable but not when it gets in the way of clarity or economy of words. Tim riley talk\n\n\"Votre habit a craqué dans le dos\" [\"Your coat has split down the back\"]. Did Lubbock give that translation? It's a little surprising that this is one of very few offered either in the quote or the article.\n\nNo, the translation is mine. Tim riley talk\n\ndivides the one-act pieces into five categories: \"(i) country idylls; (ii) urban operettas; (iii) military operettas; (iv) farces; and (v) burlesques or parodies.\": MOS:SOMETHINGOROTHER advises that when a quote gets really torturous, we should stop trying to make it work as one: here we can just drop the quote marks, I think, and therefore also drop the bracketed numbers.\n\nNot sure what you mean. I've looked up \"torturous\", a word new to me, in the OED: \"Full of, involving, or causing torture; tormenting, excruciating ... given to inflicting torture\". Seems a bit OTT to say that of my prose here. But if you want to repunctuate it, please feel free. Tim riley talk\n\nI was suggesting divides the one-act pieces into five categories: country idylls, urban operettas, military operettas, farces, and burlesques or parodies. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nDone. I don't suppose I shall be accused of plagiarism for omitting the quotation marks. Tim riley talk\n\nAs I read it, the body text mention of Johann Strauss II comes above the caption: I'd link both, as MOS:LINK permits.\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\n\"Hence 'Donnez-vous la peine de vous asseoir' (chanson du pal) : quote marks are awry here. Is chanson du pal (lc?) the title of an opera? Some more context to this work would be helpful. Is it the song/aria we're talking about here or the lyric?\n\nQuotes tweaked. I'm not going to speculate on what Poulenc had in mind. Tim riley talk\n\nSimilarly, although we did translate it a little while ago, I'd re-translate Votre habit a craqué dans le dos.\n\nA bit excessive in my view, but done. Tim riley talk\n\nAh! Que j'aime les militaires: If I've got this right, the joke here (if it's indeed a parody) is that the grandeur of a Beethoven symphony is incongruous with a lady singing about how attractive soldiers are: I think a quick explanation of the subject matter of the aria would help clarify this and reassure readers that they have indeed got the right end of the stick (an unfortunate idiom here...).\n\nI think the prose stands on its own feet, and I don't feel justified in imposing my own interpretation. Tim riley talk\n\nIn passing, I knew this opera for fifty years or so without spotting the parallel with Beethoven's Seventh in the Grand Duchess's rollicking number until I started swotting up for this FAC and if Offenbach was indulging in parody it passed me by completely. Tim riley talk\n\na simpler, more romantic style: does \"romantic\" here mean \"like Wordsworth and Wagner\" or \"with lots of kissing\"?\n\nThe former would have a capital letter, surely? Tim riley talk\n\nUsually but not always, I think. Happy given that it's falling that way. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\noften employing a codified system: what does this mean?\n\nI don't know. I didn't put it there and would gladly zap it if asked. Tim riley talk\n\nI've taken a bow at a venture and changed it to \"employing a form of shorthand\", which I think is what it means. Happy to zap altogether if you think I should. Tim riley talk\n\nAssuming that's a reasonable inference from at least one source (I think you're almost certainly right, by the by), I'm happy here. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nIt then lapsed into what Gammond calls \"Victorian sanctimoniousness\" by taking it for granted that the opera \"will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory.: I think we need to lose the it in \"taking it for granted\" (it was taking the following fact for granted). I think it would also be worth spelling out more clearly exactly what Gammond finds sanctimonious here (the disdain for lighter opera?)\n\nLooks very odd to me without the \"it\". And I'm not up for telling readers what I think a quoted author means. Tim riley talk\n\nThe critic Sacheverell Sitwell compared Offenbach's lyrical and comic gifts to those of Mozart and Rossini: roughly when? We've jumped quite suddenly out of contemporary reception, but haven't actually warned the reader that we've done so.\n\nI've rejigged to maintain chronological sequence. Tim riley talk\n\n\"Grand opera\" seems to be the only operatic sub-genre we've named in English: as its French equivalent is so similar, I think there's a good case for consistency here.\n\nAh, now this gets technical. Grand Opéra is grand opera, but not all grand opera is Grand Opéra. In English usage the term generally applies, as here, to any serious opera without spoken dialogue, whereas the French term is generally reserved for pieces in four or more usually five acts with plots set in medieval or modern times (rather than taken from classical history and mythology) often with major characters from the lower or otherwise disadvantaged classes, portraying them in a heroic light (hitherto a treatment reserved for gods, kings and aristocrats); and typically presenting controversial themes – religious intolerance or rebellion against oppression, for instance. Offenbach's fairy tale opera was not one such.\n\nPoulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own Les mamelles de Tirésias, in which Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's: a little confused about what Mellers is doing here: haven't we just said that Poulenc acknowledged the debt, so there was nothing hidden for Mellers to find?\n\nRejigged. Tim riley talk\n\nhis French colleague: this bit of elegant variation jarred a little, given that we've said a great deal about how complicated Offenbach's nationality was. We've also got an awkward repetition of established with two slightly different meanings here: the sentence could probably be reworked to solve both problems at once.\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nDo we have any idea why the French government restricted the number of performers in an opera?\n\nNo. Tim riley talk\n\nI have always assumed that is is akin to the patent theatres thing in London -- the established opera houses didn't want the competition, so their friends in the government restricted the competition in ways intended to extend the old boys' monopoly. -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nHalévy, with his experience as a senior civil servant, saw more clearly than most the looming threat from Prussia: a little uncomfortable here with more clearly than most: I'm not sure that a musical biographer is really a WP:HQRS when it comes to judging the broad French evaluation of the likelihood of war with Prussia, though he can certainly speak with authority on Halévy's own views and perhaps his views of his countrymen. Suggest something like \"expected war to break out with Prussia\", or a better-worded equivalent.\n\nRedrawn. Tim riley talk\n\nIn his early pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the size of the orchestra pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players.: as before with MOS:NUM and consistency (here, advise figures).\n\nSixteen it is. Well spotted! Tim riley talk\n\nBy the bye, is the arithmetic clear to the casual reader? The timpanist would play all the percussion instruments such as the triangle and cymbals – I well remember such an arrangement from the D'Oyly Carte touring orchestras of my youth – and the figure of 16 is correct, but is it clear? I could make it \"timpani/percussion\" or even leave out the timpani, which is usually given its own mention in lists of orchestration, but is after all a percussion instrument. Thoughts welcome. Tim riley talk\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have twigged that the timpani and percussion were the same player. As you say, it's a percussion instrument, so I think it would be arguably more accurate to include it under \"percussion\". On the other hand, if it's usually mentioned separately, we could just EFN that the timpanist and the percussionist were the same person? Equally, I'm not sure that many people will notice the illusory discrepancy, if I'm being honest. I certainly didn't until you pointed it out. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nThank you for that. I've tweaked a bit. I'm pleased with the phrase \"illusory discrepancy\", which I've noted down for use if I'm ever in a tight corner. Tim riley talk\n\nMore to follow. Enjoying it so far: the prose is particularly attractive throughout. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nWhat a nice thing to read – thank you. Looking forward to round two. Tim riley talk\n\nThe bracketed dates with the \"modest successes\" are a bit unclear to me: it's not really clear that those are supposed to have a higher place in the hierarchy than those with e.g. \"revised edition\". Suggest putting the dates into prose: \"in 1867, he released ...., and in 1868, ...\" or something like that.\n\nI don't understand what you mean here. Tim riley talk\n\nI'm suggesting it might be clearer to go with modest successes. In 1867, he produced Robinson Crusoé and a revised version of Geneviève de Brabant; in 1868, Le château à Toto, a revised version of Le pont des soupirs and L'île de Tulipatan. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nthe Doll Song: per MOS:MINORWORKS, should this have quote marks? Where's it from?\n\nAh I see why you're confused. I've rejigged the sentence. Tim riley talk\n\n\"opéra bouffon\",: here I would simply lose the quote marks.\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nun vil séducteur' to a waltz tempo that is itself unsuitably seductive ... the potty-sounding phrase 'L'homme à la pomme' becomes the absurd nucleus of a big cod-ensemble.: I think we need some explanations here: a translation of the first (OK pretty much everyone will see that there's a connection between séducteur and seductive, but we should be clear on exactly what and who it is), and some better explanation of the second (I must admit I'm struggling to see it, and I like to think I'm pretty good on French vulgarity).\n\nI think it's more dotty than vulgar, but I don't think I can or should try to explain someone else's prose. Tim riley talk\n\nAh, I'd misunderstood \"potty\" as \"potty-mouthed\" rather than \"silly\" -- now makes sense. Would still translate the \"vile seducer\", though. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nDone. Tim riley talk\n\nDer Kuhhandel (cattle trading): similarly, except here I think we should translate the title as a title: Cattle Trading. Looking into it, it seems to have a different English title (\"Arms and the Cow\"), so one option would be something like literally Cattle Trading, known in English as Arms and the Cow) I'm a fan of giving translations, but would suggest doing it throughout the article: the inconsistency of starting to do so here isn't ideal.\n\nKnown in English would be something of an overstatement. It bombed at the Savoy in the 1930s and was not seen again for decades. Opera North (I think) gave it a rare outing in about 2000 with a different English title. I think it would unduly complicate this section to go into such detail. Tim riley talk\n\nOn the general point about translations, it's difficult, perhaps impossible, to get the mix right. On the one hand one doesn't want the prose to be submerged by an avalanche of translations, nor to patronise the reader by offering unnecessary translations, but on the other one doesn't want to leave people in the dark about less obvious foreign phrases or titles. Here I have added English translations where I thought they'd be helpful and not where they wouldn't, but I may have got it wrong in places, and will gladly entertain suggestions about adding or removing any. Tim riley talk\n\nNo disagreement there. Shouldn't we capitalise \"Cow Trading\", though, as it's a title? UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nDone. 07:29, 19 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nNote 194 is doubled: we could cut the first use, though I don't think the MoS strictly requires us to do so.\n\nNot sure what you mean. Note 194 isn't doubled as far as I can see. Could you give the first few words of the note you have in mind?\n\nAh, it's now 195: citing ...that Strauss did so and ...quickly rebuked by the press.. UndercoverClassicist T·C\n\nNot sure it's better now, but done. Tim riley talk"
