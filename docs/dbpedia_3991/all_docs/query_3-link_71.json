        "text": "Talk\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: French phrasebook\n\nFrench (français) is the sole official language of France. The French are very proud of their language, and any visitor who doesn't put even a bit of effort into speaking it is missing out on an important part of the country's identity and culture, and what many consider to be the most beautiful language in the world.\n\nThe following phrases go a long way:\n\nExcusez-moi, Monsieur/Madame — Excuse me, sir / madam (ehk-SKEW-zay MWAH muh-SYUH/ma-DAHM)\n\nS'il vous plaît — Please (seel voo PLEH)\n\nMerci — Thank you (merr-SEE)\n\nAu revoir — Goodbye (oh ruh-VWAHR)\n\nParlez-vous anglais ? — Do you speak English? (par-lay VOO ahng-LEH)\n\nAs France is a multicultural society with immigrants from all over the world (particularly from former French colonies), many African languages, Arabic, Chinese dialects (such as Teochew), Vietnamese, Lao, and Khmer are spoken. French is in the Romance family of languages, along with Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Italian and Romanian, so if you speak any of those languages, you will recognise many cognates, particularly in written form.\n\nAlthough most French people, including virtually everyone born after 1990, have studied English in school, proficiency is generally poor, with only a small minority being conversant in it. With that said, things have changed dramatically since the late 2000s. You can now expect major hotels and tourist attractions to have staff who speak basic English and other foreign languages (German and Spanish being the most common). Furthermore, the younger generation of French (especially those in larger urban areas) is far more proficient in English than their elders.\n\nWhen approaching the locals, always be sure to begin the conversation in French, as assuming that a foreign language will be spoken is considered to be very rude. The French understand that their language is a challenging one for foreigners to learn, but generally react well to even clumsy, but sincere, attempts to speak their language, and will feel much more inclined to respond using whatever English they know if they judge you to have made an effort. Any conversation, no matter how short, must start with a greeting such as bonjour (during the day) or bonsoir (in the evening); failing to do so is considered as rude as not saying please or thank you is in English.\n\nForeign shows and movies usually come in two formats: VF (version française), dubbed in French, and VO (version originale) or VOSTFR (version originale sous-titrée en français), original audio with French subtitles.\n\nThe standard sign language is French Sign Language, locally known by its native initialism LSF (langue des signes française). Whenever an interpreter is present at a public event, he or she will use LSF. It's partially mutually intelligible with American Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language, and Irish Sign Language. However, it's not mutually intelligible at all with British Sign Language, Auslan, or New Zealand Sign Language.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile no longer as ubiquitous as before due to ban on flights if a route is reachable by train within 2 1/2 hours, domestic flying remains a bookable option, especially between Paris and southern France, and if offered as a direct connection from or to an international flight.\n\nThe following carriers offer domestic flights within France:\n\nAir France has the biggest domestic network in France\n\nHOP![dead link], a subsidiary of Air France, operates domestic flights with smaller aircraft\n\neasyJet, a low-cost airline, has the second biggest domestic network in France\n\nRyanair, an Irish low-cost airline, serves mainly secondary airports\n\nVolotea has a network of domestic flights\n\nAir Corsica links Corsica with mainland France\n\nTwin Jet operates domestic flights with 19-seat Beech 1900D aircraft\n\nChalair Aviation has a limited network of domestic flights, using mainly 19-seat Beech 1900D aircraft\n\nHeli Securite (Cannes (Croisette Heliport), Nice (Cote D'Azur Airport))\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Driving in France\n\nFrance has a well-developed system of highways. Most of the motorway (autoroute) network is made up of toll roads. Some have a single toll station giving you access to a section, others have entrance and exit toll stations at every junction. Upon entering a tolled section of a road, you must collect an entry ticket from a machine which records the point on the road you started at and ensures you only pay for the distance you travel. Be careful not to lose your entrance ticket or you will be charged for the longest possible distance. All toll stations accept major credit cards although they may not accept foreign credit cards. It is also possible to use the automatic booth, but only if your card is equipped with a special chip.\n\nRoads range from the narrow single-carriageway lanes found in the countryside to major highways. Most towns and cities were built before the general availability of the automobile and thus city centres tend to be unwieldy for cars. Keep this in mind when renting: large cars can be very unwieldy. It often makes sense to just park and then use public transportation.\n\nA French driver flashing headlights is asserting right of way and warning you of intentions and presence. Do not use it to mean thanks. Flashing headlights can also mean, \"Watch out as there's a police speed-check ahead of you!\" Horns should be used only in legitimate emergencies; use of the horn in urban areas outside such circumstances might win you a traffic ticket. Parisian drivers were notorious for honking their horns at anything and everything, though increased enforcement has greatly reduced this practice.\n\nSeveral weekends throughout the year in France are known as 'Black Saturday' (Samedi noir) because of the start or end of school holidays and the coinciding traffic jams on French roads caused by thousands of tourists travelling to and from their holiday destinations. When possible it is wise to avoid these days. For traffic reports, see here.\n\nRenting a car\n\n[edit]\n\nOnce you arrive in France you may need to use car hire services. Most of the leading companies operate from French airports and it is advisable to book car hire in advance. It is a common experience at smaller French airports to not get the type of car you booked online but an alternative model. Sometimes the alternative model is quite different so check carefully before accepting the vehicle and stand your ground if it does not match your booking request and is not suitable to your needs.\n\nMost cars in France are equipped with standard transmissions (voiture à boîte manuelle/mécanique), a fact that derives equally from the preferences of the driving public and the peculiarities of French licensing laws. Automatic transmissions (voiture à boîte automatique) are generally only used by the elderly or those with physical disabilities. This extends to vehicle categories that in other countries (read: the USA) are virtually never equipped with a manual transmission, such as vans and large sedans. Accordingly, virtually all of the vehicles available for rent at the average car hire will be equipped with a manual gearbox. If you do not know how to drive a car with a manual transmission and don't have the time to learn before your trip, be certain to reserve your rental car well in advance and confirm your reservation. Otherwise, you may find yourself in a car that is much larger than you can afford (or with no car at all).\n\nIt is a good tip when travelling in numbers to get one member of the party with hand luggage to go straight through to the car hire desk ahead of everybody else. This will avoid the crush once the main luggage is picked up from the conveyor.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\nFrance is a good country for hitchhiking. Be patient, prepare yourself for a long wait or walk and in the meantime enjoy the landscape. A ride will come along. People who stop are usually friendly and not dangerous. They will like you more if you speak a little French. They never expect any money for the ride.\n\nRemember that getting out of Paris by thumb is almost impossible. You can try your luck at the portes (city gates), but heavy traffic and limited areas for stopping will try your patience. It's a good idea to take the local train to a nearby suburb as your chance of being picked up will increase dramatically.\n\nOutside Paris, it's advisable to try your luck by roundabouts. As it's illegal to hitchhike on the motorways (autoroutes) and they are well observed by the police, you may try at a motorway junction.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a while with an indication of where to go, drop it and try with your thumb only. If you don't have luck where you are, you can also try to get a ride to the next good spot in the wrong direction.\n\nThe toll plazas (stations de péage), some of which require all cars to stop, are commonly used to get a ride, but the practice is illegal. French police or highway security, who are normally very tolerant of hitchhikers, may stop those trying and force them to leave.\n\nBetween two points of rural France not on the same railway line, hitching 500kms can be as quick as taking four different (and not cheap) trains.\n\nBy shared ride\n\n[edit]\n\nBlablacar has a quasi-monopoly in France, but it is still a convenient, economical and efficient way to see the country. Prices for distances are below the ones of the train and buses, about €8-10 per 100 km. Pay at is handled through the service. The app optimises the location of the passenger at the meeting point and the driver's route. Between the largest cities you will find many options, some starting in the centre, others just going by the highway – check the exact meeting point before committing to a booking. BlaBlaCar has a rating system and the rides are very reliable. BlaBlaCar offers insurance to cover the rest of the journey in case of interruption.\n\nRezo Pouce is an organised carpooling and hitchhiking service. Riders can mark their routes on a smartphone app, which allows them to arrange rides. Alternatively, they can wait for a ride at a stop marked with the service logo, with a sign with the service logo and the destination of their choice. Drivers registered with the service will have a Rezo Pouce sign on their windscreen and carry an ID card, making the service safer. Passengers also show their membership card or their profile in the app to show that they have registered for the service. Minors can join the service with parental consent. For Rezo Pouce passengers, rides are free, as with hitchhiking, but for longer journeys it is recommended to contribute to the cost.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rail travel in France\n\nTrains are a great way to get around in France. You can get from pretty much anywhere to anywhere else by train. For long distances, use the TGV (Trains à Grande Vitesse: High-speed trains) on which reservations are obligatory – but if you have time, take the slow train and enjoy the scenery. The landscape is part of what makes France one of the top tourist destinations in the world.\n\nLike many things in France, the TGV network is focused on Paris to an almost ridiculous degree, and you may be out of luck when searching for a fast connection between secondary cities. Quite often a considerable detour via the Paris region can be faster than the direct train would be. Usually, if you need to change trains, you can usually do so at one of three out-of-town TGV stations: Massy, Marne-la-Vallée or Charles de Gaulle Airport, which are on a connection line linking the northern, eastern, south-eastern and south-western high-speed lines. It is still sometimes necessary to change in Paris, and the capital has several terminus stations, which are not linked by mainline rail, so you'll likely have to use the RER or metro to transfer from one train to another. It can be a lot more expensive to travel via Paris, as you pay per kilometre for your detour.\n\nThe French national railway network is managed by SNCF Réseaux, a branch of the SNCF (Société nationale des chemins de fer français). The SNCF is the butt of jokes about delays and industrial action, but it actually offers a reliable, punctual service when there are no strikes.\n\nFor regional trains, schedules can be found at ter.sncf.com (choose your region, then \"Carte and horaires\" for maps and timetables). Booking is available in two classes: première classe (first class) is less crowded and more comfortable but can also be about 50% more expensive than deuxième classe (second class).\n\nThe SNCF website Gares & Connexions provides live train schedules, keeping you informed about platform numbers and delays. This information is also available on smartphones via the free application SNCF.\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of high speed and normal trains:\n\nTER (Train Express Régional): Regional trains form the backbone of the SNCF system. TER are sometimes slower but do serve most stations. Available on Eurail and InterRail passes.\n\nIntercités\n\nTGV (Trains à Grande Vitesse): The world-famous French high-speed trains run several times a day from Paris to the south-east Nice (5-6h), Marseille (3h) and Avignon (2.5 h), the east Geneva (3h) or Lausanne, Switzerland and Dijon (1h15), the south-west Bordeaux (3h), the west Rennes (2h), Nantes (2h), Brest (4h) and the north Lille (1h). Eurostar to London (2h15) and Thalys to Brussels (1h20) use almost identical trains. Reservations are compulsory.\n\nNight train services (Intercités de Nuit) include couchettes second class (6 bunk beds in a compartment), first class (4 bunks) and reclining seats. You can ask for a \"private room\" (in first class). These mainly run between Paris and southern France cities (i.e. Nice, Toulouse, Lourdes, Biarritz, Perpignan)\n\nBooking online\n\n[edit]\n\nBooking tickets online can be quite a confusing process: SNCF only sells tickets online for its low-cost Ouigo services via the website and app, which thankfully include high speed trains (TGV). Other options include:\n\nSNCF Connect French language booking website by the SNCF. It can get sometimes confusing, and is known to hardly work when you try to buy a ticket from abroad or with a non-French credit card. Be careful: you will need the credit card that has been used for payment to retrieve your tickets from the ticket machines. If you don't have it, your tickets will be lost, and you will need to buy new tickets.\n\nTrainline French, English, German, Spanish and Italian language booking website. It aims to be as easy to use as possible. Unlike \"Voyages SNCF\", you don't need your credit card to retrieve the tickets, only the reservation number and the last name entered for reservation. You can pay with Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Paypal. Tickets can be printed or downloaded on your mobile phone or Apple watch or Android watch.\n\nRailEurope are booking agencies owned by the SNCF. Fares will often be more expensive on these sites than on the \"official\" sites, but they are generally easier to use than the SNCF sites.\n\nBeware: To avoid any form of fraud, your ticket must be punched by an automatic machine (composteur) before entering the platform area to be valid. The machines are situated at the entrance of all platforms. However, e-Billet electronic tickets do not have to be punched: in doubt, punch it anyway.\n\nIf you start your journey at an unstaffed station with no ticket machine, you can buy a ticket from the inspector on the train, but you must go and find them first. If you wait for the inspector to find you, you are liable to be fined. Pretending not to understand French won't help.\n\nFrench information booths, especially in larger train stations, can be quite unhelpful, especially if you do not understand much French. If something does not seem to make sense, just say \"excusez-moi\" and they should repeat it.\n\nIt is cheaper to book and purchase train tickets, especially those with reservations, in advance.\n\nIn railway stations with a ticket vending machine and a ticket office, the price can differ.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nFrance does not have a national bus service. Coach traffic was liberalised in 2015, allowing the emergence of a few long-distance companies. Two well-known ones are BlaBlaCar Bus (previously Ouibus) and FlixBus, which quickly expanded in France after the liberalisation.\n\nThe coach companies compete with rail on price, which means they usually are somewhat cheaper than trains, sometimes much cheaper, especially if booked in advance. Trains are more comfortable and sometimes much faster. Tourist information centres may recommend the train over the bus; if so, politely insist that you would still like information about buses as well as trains.\n\nLocal and regional bus services are available throughout France; you can find more details in region and city articles. When using local buses, it is essential to validate your ticket if necessary, especially if using card-like tickets with magnet bands.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nFrance is not a particularly cyclist-friendly country (unlike, say, the Netherlands), but the situation is improving: more cycle paths are being built and about 40 cities have a bike-sharing system.\n\nBeware of bike thieves. If you have to park your bike in the street, make sure to lock it properly, particularly in larger cities and at night. Avoid using the cable-locks that can be cut within seconds, instead use U-shaped locks, chains or folding locks. Lock your bike to a solid fixed support like a U-Rack. Lock the frame (not only the wheels) and make sure that your wheels cannot be removed without tools.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nG7 app works in 180 cities and towns. Uber and Bolt work in major cities.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: French cuisine\n\nWith its international reputation for fine dining, few people would be surprised to hear that French cuisine can certainly be very good. As a testament to this, France is tied with Japan for first place as the country with the most Michelin star restaurants. French cuisine as a whole has been inscribed on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. Unfortunately, the local food can also be quite disappointing; many restaurants that cater to tourists serve very ordinary fare, and some are rip-offs. Finding the right restaurant and one where French people go to is therefore very important — try asking locals, hotel staff or even browsing restaurant guides or websites for recommendations as simply walking in off the street can be a hit and miss affair. The downside is that outside of the tourist traps, it is very rare to find a restaurant with English-speaking waiters, so be prepared to have to speak some French.\n\nThere are many places to try French food in France, from three-star Michelin restaurants to French brasseries or bistrots that you can find on almost every corner, especially in big cities. In general, one should try to eat where the locals do for the best chance of a memorable meal. Most small cities or even villages have local restaurants which are sometimes listed in the most reliable guides. In fact, many fine dining restaurants are in rural villages rather than in the big cities, and French people often drive to those villages to dine during special occasions. Even among cities, Paris is not considered by the French to have the best fine dining scene; that honour goes to Lyon. There are also specific local restaurants, like bouchons lyonnais in Lyon, crêperies in Brittany and in the Montparnasse area of Paris, and baraques à frites in the north. Frites (French fries or chips, depending where you're from) tend to be much better in the north, where they are known as frites flamandes, or Flemish fries. These are traditionally cut from fresh potatoes and fried twice, to be crispy outside and fluffy within.\n\nChinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, even Thai eateries are readily available in Paris, either as regular restaurants or traiteurs (fast-food). They are not so common, and are more expensive, in smaller French cities. Many places have \"Italian\" restaurants though these are often little more than unimaginative pizza and pasta parlours. You will also find Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, as well as Greek and Lebanese food. The ubiquitous hamburger bars – US original or their French copies – are also available.\n\nIn France, taxes (7% of the total in restaurants) and service (usually 10%) are always included in the bill, so anything patrons add to the bill is an \"extra-tip\". There should not be any additions to the advertised price, do not hesitate to question such additions. French people usually leave one or two coins if they were happy with the service, but it's not mandatory. Bread and tap water are always free of charge, and no extra price should be applied for the dishes.\n\nFixed price menus seldom include beverages. If you want water, waiters will often try to sell you mineral water or fizzy water, at a premium; ask for a carafe d'eau for tap water, which is free and safe to drink. Water never comes with ice in it unless so requested, and water with ice may not be available.\n\nAs in other countries, restaurants tend to make a large profit off beverages. Expect wine to cost much more than it would in a supermarket.\n\nOrdering is made either from fixed price menus (menu fixe) or à la carte.\n\nA typical fixed price menu will comprise:\n\nappetiser, called entrées or hors d'œuvres\n\nmain dish, called a plat [principal]\n\ndessert (dessert) or cheese (fromage)\n\nSometimes, restaurants offer the option to take only two of the three courses, at a reduced price.\n\nCoffee is always served as a final step, though it may be followed by liquors. Coffee will always be served black unless requested otherwise. For white coffee, ask for café au lait. A request for coffee during the meal will be considered strange.\n\nNot all restaurants are open for both lunch and dinner, nor are they always open all year around. It is therefore advisable to carefully check the opening times and days. A restaurant open for lunch will usually start service at noon and accept patrons until 13:30. Dinner begins at around 19:30 and patrons are accepted until 21:30. Restaurants with longer service hours are usually found only in the larger cities and in town centres. Finding a restaurant open on Saturday and especially Sunday can be a challenge unless you stay close to the tourist areas.\n\nIn a reasonable number of restaurants, especially outside tourist areas, a booking is compulsory and people may be turned away without one, even if the restaurant is clearly not filled to capacity. For this reason, it can be worthwhile to research potential eateries in advance and make the necessary reservations to avoid disappointment, especially if the restaurant you're considering is specially advised in guide books.\n\nA lunch of 2–3 courses for two on the menu including wine and coffee will cost you (as of 2018) €30-50 on average. A main course at dinner will cost €15–30 in a typical restaurant, while a typical dinner for two with beverages will cost €50–110. The same with beer in a local bistro or a crêperie around €35–55. You can, or course, spend considerably more.\n\nOutside of Paris and the main cities, prices are not always lower but the menu will often include a fourth course, usually cheese. As with everywhere beware of the tourist traps which are numerous around the heavy travelled spots and may offer a nice view but not much to remember on your plate.\n\nRestaurant etiquette\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench waiters have a reputation for being rude, but this is largely undeserved. While there are certainly a few bad ones who will seemingly go to any length to demonstrate their contempt for you as a customer, most perceptions of rudeness are simply down to travellers having certain expectations of service which are different to the French cultural norm.\n\nImportant differences from some other countries follow. In France the customer does not come first. You are not always right, your every whim does not have to be indulged, and the amount of money you flash will not entitle you to a superior service to others in the room. The vast majority of restaurants in France are privately-owned independents, with all the proprietary pride that entails; you as the customer are nothing more than a temporary guest in the restaurateur's home. That means you will be treated well, as long as you are polite and follow a few house rules. Humility and a sense of humour when mistakes happen can both go a long way in this game!\n\nUpon arrival at a restaurant, wait at the door to be shown to your table. Seating yourself without being invited to do so is often taken to be presumptuous, and may result in your getting off on the wrong foot before you can even say bonjour. Asking for a dish to be changed for any reason is unusual and can be taken as a criticism of chef's cooking. If you don't like how a particular dish is prepared, or can't eat one of the ingredients, order something else. There is a reason the full menu is posted on every restaurant door: to allow people to get an idea of what is on offer in advance of making a commitment to eat there. While dining, it is considered impolite to have your elbows on the table; ditto for laying your hands in your lap. If you are given a glass or a cup with your beverage, use it.\n\nWaitering is a respected profession in France. In the French psyche, a good waiter is there to make sure you receive your meal and drinks in the proper manner, and then to keep out of your way so you can enjoy yourself in peace. If you need something, you're more than welcome to ask, but don't expect to be approached during your meal, or for your needs to be anticipated in advance. Above all, don't address your waiter as garçon (boy), as this is demeaning and about a century out-of-date etiquette-wise. A simple excusez-moi is more than sufficient to attract the server's attention. One way to ensure good service is to ask the waiter's recommendations for wine or to point out any local specialities on the menu; this shows that you respect their expertise and gives you the opportunity to learn more about the local cuisine.\n\nYou can show your appreciation at the end by leaving a small tip. Tipping is neither compulsory nor expected as the serving staff receive a full wage, and many establishments factor a 10% service charge into the price of the food (this is signalled with service compris printed on the bill or menu). Most French people, when deciding to tip, will just round up the bill to the next multiple of five – if a bill comes to €46, call it €50 and everyone's happy.\n\nBread\n\n[edit]\n\nBakeries (boulangeries) are something of a French institution and are to be found all over the country from the smallest villages to city streets. All white bread variants keep for only a short time and must be eaten the same day, or else saved for dunking in soup or hot chocolate the following morning. Hence bakers bake at least twice a day.\n\nThe famous baguette: a long, thin loaf;\n\nVariants of the baguette : la ficelle (even thinner), la flûte, la tradition (a baguette with a generally more delicate taste but also more expensive);\n\nPain de campagne or Pain complet: made from whole grain which keeps relatively well.\n\nPastries\n\n[edit]\n\nPastries are a large part of French cooking. Hotel breakfasts tend to be light, consisting of tartines (pieces of bread with butter or jam) or the famous croissants and pains au chocolat, not dissimilar to a chocolate-filled croissant, but square rather than crescent shaped.\n\nPastries can be found in a pâtisserie but also in most boulangeries.\n\nRegional dishes\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery French region has dishes all its own. These dishes follow the region's local produce from agriculture, hunting and fishing. Here is a small list of regional dishes which you can find easily in France. Generally each region has a unique and widespread dish, usually because it was food for the masses:\n\nCassoulet (in the south west) : beans, duck, pork & sausages\n\nChoucroute, or sauerkraut (in Alsace) : stripped fermented cabbage + pork\n\nFondue Savoyarde (central Alps) : melted/hot cheese with white wine\n\nFondue Bourguignonne (in Burgundy) : pieces of beef (in boiled oil), usually served with a selection of various sauces.\n\nRaclette (central Alps) : melted cheese & potatoes/meat\n\nPot-au-feu (found all over France) : boiled beef with vegetables\n\nBoeuf Bourguignon (Burgundy) : slow cooked beef with red wine gravy\n\nGratin dauphinois (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes) : oven-roasted slices of potatoes with sour cream and cheese\n\nAligot (Aveyron) : melted cheese mixed with a puree of potatoes\n\nBouillabaisse (fish + saffron) (Marseille and the French Riviera). Don't be fooled! A real bouillabaisse is a really expensive dish due to the amount of fresh fish it requires. Be prepared to pay at least €30 per person. If you find restaurants claiming to serve bouillabaisse for something like €15 per person, you'll find it to be of a very poor quality.\n\nTartiflette (Savoie) : Melted Reblochon cheese, potatoes and pork or bacon.\n\nConfit de Canard (south west) : Duck Confit, consists of legs and wings bathing in grease. That grease is actually very healthy and, with red wine, is one of the identified sources of the so-called \"French Paradox\" (eat richly, live long).\n\nFoie Gras (south west) : The liver of a duck or goose. Although usually quite expensive, foie gras can be found in supermarkets for a lower price (because of their purchasing power) around the Christmas season. It is the time of year when most foie gras is consumed in France. It goes very well with Champagne.\n\nMoules marinière (found all along the coast, with large regional differences) : Mussels steamed in wine or cider (Brittany and Normandy) with a variety of local produce, e.g. simple shallots and garlic in the north, cream in the west, tomatoes and peppers in the south, etc... Normally served with crusty bread and frites.\n\nCooking and drinking is a notable part of French culture; take time to eat and discover new dishes.\n\nUnusual foods\n\n[edit]\n\nContrary to stereotype, snails and frog legs are quite infrequent foods in France, with many French people enjoying neither, or sometimes having never even tasted them. Quality restaurants sometimes have them on their menu: if you're curious about trying new foods, go ahead.\n\nFrog legs (cuisses de grenouille) have a very fine and delicate taste with flesh that is not unlike chicken. They are often served in a garlic dressing and are no weirder to eat than, say, crab.\n\nMost of the taste of Burgundy snails (escargots de bourgogne) comes from the generous amount of butter, garlic and parsley in which they are cooked. They have a very particular spongy-leathery texture and, for obvious reasons, a strong garlicky flavour. Catalan-style snails (cargols) are made a completely different way, and taste even weirder!\n\nLet us also cite:\n\nRillettes sarthoises also known as Rillettes du Mans. A sort of potted meat, made from finely shredded and spiced pork. A delicious speciality of the Sarthe area in the north of the Pays de la Loire and not to be confused with rillettes from other areas, which are more like a rough pâté.\n\nBeef bone marrow (os à moelle). Generally served in small quantities, with a large side. So go ahead: if you don't like it, you'll have something else to eat on your plate!\n\nVeal sweetbread (ris de veau), is a very fine (and generally expensive) delicacy, often served with morels, or in more elaborate dishes like bouchées à la reine.\n\nBeef bowels (tripes) is served either à la mode de Caen (with a white wine sauce, named after the town in Normandy) or à la catalane (with a slightly spiced tomato sauce)\n\nAndouillettes are sausages made from tripe, a specialty of Lyon\n\nTricandilles are seasoned and grilled pork tripe from the Bordeaux region\n\nBeef tongue (langue de bœuf) and beef nose (museau) and Veal head (tête de veau) are generally eaten cold (but thoroughly cooked!) as an appetiser.\n\nOysters (huîtres) are most commonly served raw in a half shell. They are often graded by size, No1 being the largest (and most expensive).\n\nOursins (sea urchins), for those who like concentrated iodine.\n\nSteak tartare a big patty of ground beef cured in acid as opposed to cooked, frequently served with a raw egg. Good steak tartare will be prepared to order at tableside. A similar dish is boeuf carpaccio, which is thin slices or strips of raw steak drizzled with olive oil and herbs.\n\nCervelle (pronounced ser-VELL), lamb brain.\n\nCheese\n\n[edit]\n\nFrance is certainly the country for cheese (fromage), with nearly 400 different kinds. Indeed, former president General Charles De Gaulle was quoted as saying \"How can you govern a country which has 365 varieties of cheese?\".\n\nDietary restrictions\n\n[edit]\n\nVegetarianism is not as uncommon as it used to be, especially in larger cities. Still, few \"traditional\" restaurants offer vegetarian menus; if you ask for something vegetarian the only things they may have available are salad and vegetable side dishes. Also, those that do have vegetarian mains often don't have them on the menu fixe, so you may have to pick something à la carte, which is usually more expensive. When asking for vegetarian options, watch out for confusion between vegetarianism and pescetarianism.\n\nLuckily North African cuisine is very popular in France, couscous is one of the most popular dishes in France (especially in Eastern France), it is widely available and there are usually vegetarian couscous options. Also, vegetarian and organic food restaurants are starting to appear.\n\nVeganism, whilst on the rise, is still very uncommon and it may be difficult to find vegan eateries. Nonetheless, the French vegan community made vegoresto.fr to help find vegan food and restaurants, and the American website HappyCow also lists 6600 restaurants as of January 2024. Paris has one of the fastest growing vegan communities in Europe, so you should be able to find a vegan restaurants.\n\nPretty much every town has at least one halal restaurant or takeaway, and many also have halal butchers. Kosher (look for signs with kasher, cachère and other similar words) restaurants and shops are less common outside the large cities.\n\nBreakfast\n\n[edit]\n\nBreakfast in France is usually very light, typically consisting of a coffee and a croissant or some other viennoiserie at special occasions. On normal days most people have a beverage (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, orange juice) and toast of baguette or toast bread with butter and jam/honey/Nutella that can be dipped in the hot beverage, or cereals with milk, or fruit and yoghurt. The French breakfast is mostly sweet, but anything can change and you can have savoury breakfasts everywhere today.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench people adhere to a strong set of values. They cherish their culture, history, language and cuisine, which is revered by many around the globe.\n\nThe French have an undeserved reputation for being \"rude\" or \"arrogant\" by many around the globe, and this stereotype has been perpetuated far too often. Chances are, you might be doing something the locals consider rude.\n\nFrench people rarely hesitate to state what they think directly. Try not to be upset by this as it is unlikely that they intend to insult or cause offence in any way.\n\nPeople in France are borderline obsessed with debates, friendly arguments and discussions, and at times, you might feel that they are dissatisfied with everything and anything, including yourself. Don't be fazed or surprised by this; this is simply a matter of culture and this is how the French further connect to the people around them. If you get dragged into a discussion by your French colleagues, try to participate.\n\nMatters of etiquette are taken seriously, and it's not uncommon to be dismissed, ignored, or told off for exhibiting behaviour that is seen as impolite. When conversing with locals, always exchange a simple pleasantry (Excusez-moi, Bonjour, or Bonsoir) and wait for them to reply before getting into something. Greet people as soon you enter an establishment, not when you're ready to start talking. In many shops, it's customary to exchange pleasantries with the staff and have them take items for you.\n\nAs is the case in most parts of the world, it is customary to use honorifics with people you are not close to or are senior to you. Use Monsieur for men and Madame for women.\n\nOn the Métro\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Métro subway system is a great way to get around Paris (or Lyon, Marseille, et al.), a fact which is readily apparent by the throngs of people that use it to get to work, school, and the like. If you do not ride the train at home, or if you come from a place that doesn't have a subway system, there are certain points of etiquette that you may not be aware of:\n\nWhen boarding at the station, let those exiting the train step off onto the platform before boarding, and once aboard move to the centre of the car.\n\nIf you have luggage, move it as far out of the path of others as possible.\n\nCertain stations have moving walkways to cover the distances between platforms – walk on the left and stand on the right!\n\nFinally, the doors on French subway cars don't generally open automatically once the train has stopped at the station; rather, most cars have a small button or lever on the doors that opens them. If you happen to be standing near the door in a crowded car, you might hear someone behind you say \"la porte, s'il vous plait,\" which means that they would like to get off the train and is asking you to open the door for them. Pop the door open and step aside (or down onto the platform) while that person exits the train; the driver will wait for you to get back on.\n\nDress code\n\n[edit]\n\nDress codes are fast disappearing, but generally speaking, the French are conservative dressers. To avoid being seen in a negative light, you should avoid white trainers, baseball caps, tracksuits, shorts (except in summer) and flip-flops (except at the beach).\n\nAt the beach and at hotel swimming pool, it is normal for women to take off their bikini tops while sunbathing. Taking off your bikini bottom is reserved to designated nude beaches. Most resort cities insist on your wearing a shirt when leaving the beach area.\n\nEveryone at public swimming pools is required by law to wear suitable swimming attire. This means swim caps (even if you're bald) and snug-fitting Lycra-based swimsuits. Baggy or \"board\" swim shorts are banned, as are T-shirts, UV-protective rash guards, and other cover-ups. If you're unlucky in your choice, then most public pools sell pre-approved swimsuits from vending machines on-site, often for rather inflated prices. Watch also for local prohibitions on sunscreen, which can mess with older pools' filtration systems.\n\nBreastfeeding in public is very rare, but nobody will mind if you do.\n\nAddressing people (tu and vous)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: French phrasebook#Formal and informal speech\n\nThe French language has two variants of the word \"you\". They are tu, which is used for friends and (by some elderly) for young people, and vous, which is used for people you're not on familiar terms with, and for groups of people. As a general rule, the only time you should use tu with an adult is if that person indicates it's alright to do so, usually by saying On peut se tutoyer..\n\nSensitive issues\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics:\n\nUnless you really follow French news closely, you should steer clear of discussing French politics, especially sensitive issues such as immigration. Be aware of the position that being a foreigner puts you in. It is considered rude to ask a person point-blank about which candidate they voted for in an election; instead, talk about the issues and take it from there.\n\nThe status of ethnic minorities, especially immigrants from North and West Africa, in France is a sensitive issue. Many ethnic French resent immigrant communities for not fully assimilating into French culture while conversely, many immigrants and their descendants resent French society for what they see as lack of respect for their respective ethnic cultures. Avoiding discussions on this is good policy.\n\nReligion:\n\nIt is generally considered impolite to have a conversation about religion with someone you do not know well. The French are fiercely protective of their tradition of secularism (laïcité). For instance, the wearing of religious items of clothing, such as hijabs, kippas or crucifixes, is illegal for public servants when they are at work, and for all students and staff at public schools. It is also illegal to cover your face in public, which effectively outlaws the burqa (and masks, balaclavas etc.) This has been interpreted by some as an anti-Muslim law.\n\nFrance remains a majority Roman Catholic country, though due to the culture of secularism, religion plays virtually no role in French public life, and church attendance levels are among the lowest in the world. However, many French people are still proud of their historic churches, and you are still expected to behave in a respectful manner when visiting them.\n\nMoney:\n\nAvoid being showy with displaying or discussing money and luxury goods. It is considered to be quite crass to discuss your salary, or to ask someone else directly about theirs. Instead express your enthusiasm about how great are the responsibilities, or how lucky you were to get there, etc.\n\nCity/rural differences:\n\nWhile roughly one sixth of the country's population lives in the Paris region, don't treat France as Paris or assume that all French people act like Parisians. Life in Paris can be closer to life in London or New York City than in the rest of France, and Parisian customs and opinions differ from those found en province. Brittany, Corsica and the Basque Country in particular have their own national identities."
