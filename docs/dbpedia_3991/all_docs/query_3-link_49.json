        "text": "Thoughts on the cinema relay:\n\nAbout the production, I think I liked it better now than the other version I‚Äôve seen from 10+ years ago. I agree 100% about what was said regarding the lighting and the buildings occupying too much space on stage. I hope the RB plan on a future revamp on this ballet cause I think there is space for that to happen ( both in narrative/story, as in dance and production design). I do like all the costumes for the show, I think they changed Franz last costume in act 3 which I liked, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing them change a bit. Overall I find this staging a wonderful opportunity for the women of the company, and the decision to put for this cinema relay new faces in all kinds of roles was a great one.\n\nAs Swanilda, Marianela Nunez was captivating and funny! I thought her mime and acting was fabulous just as her interaction with Vadim‚Äôs Franz.\n\nWas surprised with how much I loved Vadim in this role, not for the dancing ( I knew he would be spectacular) but for his acting. Bravo for both. Avis is also a treasure! So lucky to have him still with the company and hopefully for many more years to come.\n\nIn act one the dancers that caught my attention were Teo Dubreil and Romany Padjak.\n\nAs some have said before, Mayara Magri does make the most of the roles given to her, as soon as she entered the stage as Peasant Girl it was like she was a ray of sunshine and she completely dominated the place with her personality. Definitely elevated the ending of act 1. Can not wait to hear about her Swanilda debut here on the forum!!\n\nIn act 3 we had more ‚Äùnew‚Äù faces. The dancers who caught my attention here were Leticia Dias, Yu Hang, Sae Maeda, Sumina Sasaki, Nadia Mullova-Barley, Amelia Townsend and Charlotte Tonkinson.\n\nI loved Claire Calvert as Dawn. Beautiful feet and lines. She looks much better in this than she ever felt ( to me) as the lilac fairy, where it looks like she is doing more of a series of steps - where you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the difficulty of the steps when you shouldn‚Äôt.\n\nAbout Annette Buvoli, She is a lovely dancer and I hope we get to see more of her in the future, was very happy she got this chance to dance Prayer. She had the loveliest hands through out the performance and such a serene look to her eyes. Brava.\n\nGreat pas de deux to close act 3 by Vadim and Nunez. Showing great technique and security in all the steps. Agree with everyone that pointed it out Vadim‚Äôs black leggings and how that wasn‚Äôt favoured by the camera.\n\nIf I remember anything else I will add it later.\n\nHave now looked further into this and what I find amazing is how on earth the ballet Coppelia was ever adapted from the original tale ‚ÄúDer Sandmann‚Äù by Hoffman ....an altogether far darker and to be frank definitely weird story!\n\nThe original characters names are completely different and basically the character of Swanhilda is called Clara and Coppelia is called Olimpia the only similar name is Coppelius which is the same in both and they are into the same kind of thing...well sort of!!\n\nSo there is no original German text with the name Swanhilda in it üò¢\n\nHowever in the info I was reading when went on to adaptation of the ballet it switched to Wikipedia and there shows a picture of the first ballerina to perform role: Guiseppina Bozzacchi and spells Swanhilda with the ‚Äòh‚Äô\n\nI don‚Äôt really mind how it‚Äôs spelled but it‚Äôs interesting that there isn‚Äôt really an overall consensus on it so will just respect the Company showing it and for the Royal that‚Äôs Swanilda without the ‚Äòh‚Äô\n\nEdited December 13, 2019 by LinMM\n\nSorry to hark back to the story again but because I could hardly relate ‚ÄúDer Sandmann‚Äù (definitely on the nightmare scale with a character to almost rival Bluebeard) to the ballet Coppelia I then found that some sources say the ballet is also partly based on an opera libretto called ‚ÄòDie Poupee‚Äù ( the doll) but as that was much later than the 1870 ballet Coppelia I was confused as to this origin but then discovered there is another version of this libretto from 1852 and this is another opera called La poupee de Nuremberg also very loosely based on Sandmann tale of Hoffman and with music by none other than Adolphe Adam!! It‚Äôs definitely much more light hearted an opera ‚Äòcomique‚Äô in fact .....So guess it must be from this that Coppelia is based on as it does have more similarities with ballet story.\n\nAnyway Douglas Allen you will be pleased to know that from now on will call it Swanilda! Though still have a hankering for the slightly more romantic Swanhilda version üòâ\n\n8 hours ago, LinMM said:\n\nit switched to Wikipedia and there shows a picture of the first ballerina to perform role: Guiseppina Bozzacchi and spells Swanhilda with the ‚Äòh‚Äô\n\nWikipedia? Given how Wikipedia articles are compiled, this needs checking. So please note first:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copp√©lia\n\nI assume this is the page you looked at. And yes the caption to the photograph is indeed currently spelled with an h. However where does whichever editor who wrote that caption get their spelling from? Presumably from the photograph itself, so clicking on that takes one to...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copp√©lia#/media/File:Coppelia_-Swanilda_-Giuseppina_Bozzachi_-Act_I-Scene_2_-Paris_-1870_-2.JPG\n\nYou will notice now in the information shown about the photograph that Ivor Guest (from whose 1974 book the picture is taken) spells it without an h, so whoever drew on this photographic source to write the caption seems to have made a mistake. Everything on Wikipedia needs a source - preferably a secondary source - and the source for the caption is the 1974 book.\n\nPerhaps I was not clear in my earlier post. The costume designer - of the costumes worn by the dancer who created the role - spelled the name Swanilda on a drawing made in 1869-70, as can clearly be seen on the original to which I linked. I submit that those who worked on the first production knew how the name should be spelled.\n\nI suggest this is therefore a far more plausible source than either a book published in 1974 (even though it spells the name the same way) or a Wikipedia article, which by its very nature can never be more than a secondary, provisional and ever changing project.\n\nTo be honest Sebastian it‚Äôs irrelevant now because I was looking for the source from the original tale the ballet was .....extremely loosely... based on by Hoffman and therefore a German text but the characters in this story are completely different so there is no original German source with the ballet names in except the name of Dr. Coppelius! I was probably hoping to see some original German name like ‚ÄòSchwannhilde‚Äô from which Swanilda may have been derived!!\n\nI don‚Äôt know which librettist used the names Franz ..Swanilda...Coppelia.. first ...did they come from the 1852 opera or were they made up in 1870 especially for the ballet.\n\nIn a context like this I haven‚Äôt got time to go into all Wikipedia‚Äô sources!!\n\nI have a feeling the first connection for me for this ballet was the Ballet Rambert version so have taken on the spelling with the ‚Äòh‚Äô from there and it‚Äôs stuck!\n\nWell yes am interested in both your posts Sebastian thank you!\n\nIt could well be that these two spellings have been confused for us by Dickens of all people...love it!\n\nAs a complete aside I was visiting Poland in 1974 when it wasn‚Äôt easy to do so and there is a picture of me surrounded by geese ...I just can‚Äôt remember how this came about now probably down near Zakopane ...but on the photo is written ‚Äò a real life Swanhilda‚Äô\n\nThe irony is that in 1975 as an amateur dancer and being rather tall I danced as Franz a couple of times in a Coppelia production based on the Rambert version! And in finding out about all this I believe the role of Franz was at some point way back ...in the original even? danced by a female!\n\nI am glad it‚Äôs a proper male role now though!\n\nI just loved the ballet such fun to dance in I was usually one of the friends but at the time I really coveted dancing Prayer which I never did üò¢\n\nI look forward to seeing this role danced in Jan hopefully by Buvoli and of course the whole ballet especially as things currently stand it‚Äôs Magri and Corrales in the main roles.\n\nI certainly don‚Äôt remember that superb solo danced in rehearsal by Corrales hee hee!\n\nI enjoyed catching up with the broadcast yesterday of a ballet I think I‚Äôve seen once 40 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôd forgotten how absolutely glorious Delibes‚Äô score is, with not one dull number. I‚Äôm not notably politically correct but I did surprise myself by having a slight issue with the central plot premise, involving illegal entry and destruction of property. I‚Äôd also agree the poster who wrote of the ‚Äúmature sheen‚Äù of Nunez‚Äôs dancing. I think there was an element of that even in her younger days and however brilliantly and beautifully danced I didn‚Äôt find Swanilda a natural fit for her, with without an ‚Äòh.‚Äô Goodness knows what I‚Äôll think to Morera who I‚Äôve booked to see as I wanted to see Campbell as Franz (and I couldn‚Äôt catch his Hayward dates after the casting changed).\n\nMuntagirov exuded boyish charm and enthusiasm and danced up a storm whilst, at the risk of seeming heretical, I think there is a more sinister yet more touching Dr Coppelius to be found than the splendid Gary Avis offers in this.\n\nA particular pleasure was to see Buvoli. Her long lines, musical response and serene presence seemed ideally fitted to Prayer and I understand she was beautiful in Enigma Variations too. There is a thread to be considered on why opportunities have been so long coming to dancers such as her and (an even longer wait) Romany Pajdak, since when those opportunities arise they are taken so very beautifully.\n\nNevertheless, I enjoyed very much, above all for the music."
