TSventon (talk)\n\n┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) Shubinator (talk)\n\nThe nomination page review template has not been updated for DYK repeat appearances \"Note other general eligibility problems here (for example, article previously appeared on DYK); leave blank for none\" should be changed so that the word \"previously\" is replaced with something like \"recently\" or the phrase \"in the last 5 years\" needs to be worked in.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n... that The One (pictured), a private residence in Los Angeles, has 21 bedrooms, 49 bathrooms, a 30-car garage, a four-lane bowling alley, a casino, a nightclub, and five swimming pools including a moat?\n\n@Muboshgu, Gatoclass, and AirshipJungleman29:: Article and hook says 49 bathrooms, but the source says \"There are 42 bathrooms\" Is this an error, or is there an extra count somewhere? Also, I don't think the AD source include the moat as one of the swimming pools, so the end of the hook might need to be modified. Z1720 (talk)\n\nSome sources have said 49.[1][2] I see that the source used inline there says 42. I'm okay rounding down. – Muboshgu (talk)\n\nThose sources actually say the place has 49 baths, which is not the same thing. I have corrected the hook to say 42 bathrooms - I originally AGFed on this hook as the source required a subscription, but curiously enough it's available to me now. Gatoclass (talk)\n\nLol shows how little I know about architecture, and the need for these checks. – Muboshgu (talk)\n\nPerhaps this is a nit, but the article just says \"lyrics about sexual harassment\" which isn't the same thing as \"anti-sexual harassment\". RoySmith (talk)\n\nSource says \"In 2021, she shared an updated version of Aqua’s ‘Barbie Girl’ featuring pointed lyrics like “they think that they can stare, undress me anywhere. ‘It’s just romantic, stop being dramatic’.”\", so updated article.--Launchballer\n\n@Lightburst, Reconrabbit, and Generalissima: the hook has \"young soldiers' sacrifice for the emperor\" in quotes, implying it's a direct quote, but that doesn't appear in the article. RoySmith (talk)\n\nThe quote comes directly from the source and was reworded to fit the structure of the paragraph in \"falling cherry petals came to represent the sacrifice of youth in suicide missions to honor the emperor\"; this is my first time nominating something so it's my bad for misinterpreting that requirement. Reconrabbit\n\n@Queen of Hearts, Abacusada, and Gatoclass: The article says \"depicts SB19 in seductive scenes, drenched and underwater\", which isn't quite the same as \"shot underwater\" RoySmith (talk)\n\n@Relayed; failed ping (Abacusada got a rename). Queen of Hearts talk\n\nshe/they\n\nstalk\n\nRoySmith, parts of the video were definitely shot underwater; the sources not only state as much, but include some images of the underwater shots. Nice catch though on the lack of clarity in the article text; I have corrected it now. Gatoclass (talk)\n\nThis is a proposal to increase the number of hooks in each set from 8 to 9. If the consensus here is to increase the number, a formal RfC will be proposed and advertised in the appropriate places, including the other areas of the Main Page.\n\nI think this increase would be a net-positive for a couple of reasons:\n\nThis will reduce the number of days that DYK runs two sets: With more hooks on the Main Page in every set, it will take longer to activate the 2-sets-a-day and will make it quicker to trigger the one-set-a-day criteria. Reducing the number of days DYK has 2-sets-a-day will reduce DYK admin burnout and more hooks will be on the Main Page for 24 hours instead of 12.\n\nThere is space to run an extra hook: During February, I have been tracking the length of the DYK vs OTD template on the Main Page, and published the results here. Out of 37 sets (because DYK was at 2-sets-a-day at the beginning of the month) 21 had an OTD hook removed, usually for Main Page balance, and the OTD template was longer than the DYK template for 28 sets. Adding an extra hook would help with Main Page balance, allowing OTD to run 5 hooks more often. There were only 3 sets during February where OTD ran 5 hooks and was still shorter than DYK, and in all these instances OTD was only a line or two shorter, which is negligible. There was one instance when OTD ran a sixth hook, and OTD was still shorter, but this shows that if there is an imbalance OTD can add hooks.\n\nDYK can pull hooks without replacing them: Right now, if a hook is pulled last-minute, there is sometimes a scramble to replace it. If it is not replaced, OTD might have to drop to 3 hooks for Main Page balance, which is not ideal. With this proposal, if a DYK hook needs to be pulled from the set last minute an admin can pull a hook from OTD instead and still have 4 OTD hooks running.\n\nThanks for considering this and I look forward to your thoughts. Z1720 (talk)\n\nI would support this, though I don't have much else to add. Eddie891 Talk Work\n\n+1 good thinking @Z1720:. Many different proposals have been shot down over the years but this one seems to be just right. Bruxton (talk)\n\nI actually did some analysis at the start of the year which can be found at Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 196#Hook duration dynamics. Ignoring the years when there was a pandemic on, we do (very roughly) between 433 and 456 sets per year, roughly 9.5-10 hooks per day. 9 hooks per set would help, but 10 per day minus pulled hooks should even it out.--Launchballer\n\nMy immediate concern when I started reading this was about main page balance. But given that's addressed and my concern was unfounded, I can easily get behind this. Schwede66\n\nI would like to hear from those who build prep sets and those who promote them to queues. If changing from eight to nine is the straw that breaks the camel's back, then it's not worth it. Otherwise, I have no feelings either way. BlueMoonset (talk)\n\nI'm fine with it (I've promoted over 60% of hooks this year). If it helps have less 12-hour periods, it's definitely preferable. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nI'm not opposed to this, but I'd rather see us do some more general thing that lets us adjust as needed without having to run another monumental RFC. Maybe just leave it up to prep builders if they want to do 8, 9, or 10 for a particular set and trust their judgement as to what cadence we should be at based on the backlog. If there's not enough room for 10 most of the time, maybe only allow 10 if they're all quite short, again, leaving it to the judgement of the prep builders to not overflow our allotted space. I especially like the fact that we can pull a hook without having to replace it. That saves a ton of busywork. RoySmith (talk)\n\n@RoySmith: I agree that DYK should avoid monumental RfCs. What if we set the default to 9, and give discretion to preppers and DYK admin to reduce/increase the number by 1 if needed? Some discretion reasons I can think of are: a lack of approved hooks, too many approved hooks on certain topics (so it is hard to fill sets with different topics), a set that uses a lot of short or long hooks, or a special occasion set. I would prefer to not have an RfC about how many approved hooks should trigger 8-hooks-a-set or anything like that: I trust preppers to have discretion and post concerns on WT:DYK when they arise. Z1720 (talk)\n\nFewer rules, more faith in people doing the right thing. Works for me. RoySmith (talk)\n\nI would encourage any prepper who wants to do this do to it! Standard practice is the only thing that governs set length; you are free to pioneer a new path. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\n@Theleekycauldron: By changing the default to 9, I think this will signal to prep builders that they can have 9 hooks in a set. Also, PSHAW doesn't allow a prep builder to add a ninth hook, so right now if a prep builder wants to add it they will have to do it manually, which discourages additional hooks. Can the PSHAW code be modified for an option to add additional hooks? Z1720 (talk)\n\nPSHAW can add an additional hook if all of the current slots are full – I could make that available at any time? Probably couldn't add an insert... theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nI can support this one. In parallel, can someone help with some numbers. What is our inflow rate? i.e. avg. number of hooks being nominated daily. What is our approval / rejection rate? If avg hooks * approval rate is greater than 9, this one is a simple one to approve, given that mainpage balance is not an issue and the awesome PSHAW tool can be tweaked to allow for 9 hooks. Ktin (talk)\n\nHooks do seem to have gotten shorter these days, possibly because people are taking DYKTRIM more seriously than they used to (which is certainly not a bad thing). And it's clearly not good to have whitespace regularly under the set. On the other hand, more than eight hooks tends to start looking cluttered. Importantly, it's also a lot more difficult in my experience to avoid topic repetition with more than eight hooks. And of course, it means more work for set builders and set verifiers, and more possibility of errors.\n\nSo I personally would be reluctant to standardize on nine hooks. On the other hand, if the current crop of set builders/verifiers are happy with the idea, it would seem a little churlish to oppose. So I guess we could trial it. However, I think it important that sets that turn out to be too long be corrected before going to the main page by removing hooks back to prep. Gatoclass (talk)\n\nPer some discussion at #QPQ tool raised above, I wonder if it would be feasible to have a bot (perhaps using the existing DYK housekeeping bot for this purpose) that could automatically do basic QPQ-related checks. It could do any of the following tasks:\n\nIf a nomination is done by someone with five or less nominations, it would automatically fill in the QPQ field with a note that a QPQ is not required. In addition, it's also possible that a counter could be included (i.e. something like \"1st of 5 free nominations\") for tracking purposes.\n\nIf a QPQ is needed, and one has not been provided within seven days of the nomination, a note or comment of some kind could be added to the nomination, along with a message and/or ping to the nominator.\n\nIf a QPQ is still not provided after another seven days, the nomination will be marked for closure by the bot.\n\nNote that such tasks would not replace manual checks by reviewers regarding QPQs, and they are not intended to replace full reviews. They're just intended to lower the workload for reviewers. The advantage of such a task would be that nominations do not have to wait to be dealt with regarding the QPQ requirement. For example, if a nomination is already specified from the start to not require a QPQ, any prospective reviewer will know it from the start. In addition, the QPQ notes/warnings can also raise attention for reviewers while also allowing for the nominators to resolve matters as quickly as possible.\n\nWould such a task of series of tasks be feasible from technical or practical perspectives? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nRegarding the above discussion, I submitted the bot idea to BRFA and I was suggested to simply change Module:NewDYKnomination, which I agree with. So the desired result of the \"bot\" would change to: when someone uses the wizard to create a DYK nom, from the get-go the tool will say whether a QPQ is needed or not.\n\nOf the 3 tasks you gave above, the 1st wouldn't be needed anymore if the appropriate changes are made to the module. The last 2 would be welcome improvements, but I personally would be spending my time trying to improve the module; if someone would be able to add this to one of the existing DYK housekeeping bots, that would be great. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\nIs it possible to roll two separate noms into a single nom for a proposed double hook? Here's the unusual situation:\n\nOn January 29, User:Lajmmoore nominates Template:Did you know nominations/Leeds 2023.\n\nOn February 29, Lajmmoore nominates Template:Did you know nominations/Hibiscus Rising.\n\nBoth proposed hooks (ALT2, Leeds 2023; and ALT0, Hibiscus Rising) are almost identical.\n\nIt would make sense to merge ALT2 and ALT0 into one double hook. Not sure if this is even allowed. Otherwise, we can't have two similar hooks, so we would need to strike one or the other. Thoughts? @Gerda Arendt: since she is working on the nom for Hibiscus Rising. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI really wouldn't say they're almost identical; just because a hibiscus sculpture is prominent in both doesn't mean they're the same hook. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nI would rather propose another ALT for LEEDS 2023 - I'll get on that now. Lajmmoore (talk)\n\nDone\n\nI made an oops. I promoted a 210 character hook. Need a volunteer to trim and I am not sure what is essential. Pinging the nominator and reviewers @Onceinawhile, Makeandtoss, and Launchballer:\n\n... that during South Africa's genocide case against Israel, the International Court of Justice initially ordered Israel to \"punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza?\n\nLightburst (talk)\n\nPerhaps this? 196 characters, if my count is right.\n\n... that in South Africa's genocide case against Israel, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to \"punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza?\n\nP-Makoto (she/her) (talk)\n\nThree options, all ok with me:\n\ndelete \"initially \" (unnecessary given the earlier word \"during\")\n\nreplace \"International Court of Justice\" with \"ICJ\"\n\ndelete \"against Palestinians\"\n\nAny one of these three will remove the required 10+ characters. I would vote for #1. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\nEdit conflict. P-Makoto's version works well. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\nDone, I will change the hook to P-Makoto's trim. Thank you. Lightburst (talk)\n\n@Juustila, Ktin, and AirshipJungleman29: I don't think the sources the hook cites aren't reliable for the claim the hook is making. Something with peer review or an editorial process would be much better suited – pulled this one for now. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\ntheleekycauldron I disagree. There is no WP:EXCEPTIONALity which requires high-quality sources; it is a simple claim, and one backed up by other citations in the article. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nIt's not about high-quality sources, it's about passing a bare minimum of reliability at all. Blogs, tourism websites, and other blocks of text that lie around aren't reliable, as WP:DYKHOOK requires they be. If other sources verify the hook, use those. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nIf this was a US site, I wouldn't use it as a source for a hook. Such sites are notorious for errors. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI agree with @Theleekycauldron:'s note in spirit. In fact I had noted that in my review. That said, the revised hook is a very basic one which is hard not to prove. The hook basically says, the church is one of the oldest preserved wooden churches. The fact is so-basic, that the mere existence of the church (in whatever active capacity) is sufficient to prove the hook. And, the tourism department website proves its existence, in my opinion. That said, if folks want to get a WP:RS source other than the tourism department website, and the nominator is willing, I will not stand in the way. Cheers. Ktin (talk)\n\nAnother issue is that the final paragraph, from \"The church does not have roof chairs\" appears to be an uncredited machine translation of part of the Finnish article. TSventon (talk)\n\nThanks @TSventon. @Theleekycauldron has kindly reopened the nomination. Will take it up there with the nominator. Ktin (talk)\n\n@Theleekycauldron: can I check if you are concerned about sourcing in general, or just the sourcing of the hook? TSventon (talk)\n\n@TSventon: Mostly the sourcing of the hook, but any unreliable sources should be removed from the article as well. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\n@Ktin and Juustila: I have removed the disputed sources, does the nomination look OK now? TSventon (talk)\n\nYes, it's okay for me. Juustila (talk)\n\nThe DYK Toolbox shown on noms lists this tool for checking QPQs. Is this still the best tool for this purpose? Does anyone have a better one they use that we might want to add to the DYK Toolbox? The tool doesn't help you verify whether the review linked in the nom has already been used as a QPQ in another nom (for some reviews, checking the nominator's contribution log is not easy). The tool sorts its results alphabetically which makes this more difficult. If there is no better tool, does anyone know who maintains this tool for improvements? Or, does anyone have any ideas for a bot that can post QPQ verification comments on noms? I'd be happy to develop such a bot, if I could get some input on how people would find it helpful for it to work. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\nIf we want to go in this direction, this is the idea I had for the bot: when a nomination is posted, it would leave one of the following comments: \"No QPQ needed\" or \"QPQ review needed\" or \"Linked QPQ looks good\" (or something similar). This would not only be a convenience to the reviewer but would also solve a tiny problem some people have faced where an old nom get rejected for QPQ even though none was needed when the nom was first created.\n\nI'd like to know if anyone would find this helpful before I actually start writing a specification for this and submitting this for bot approval. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\nThe current QPQ tool only came into use pretty recently, after the old one broke. While kudos are due to whoever got a replacement working, the old one seemed markedly better.\n\nI think this would be a great task for a bot, if we could get that working correctly. However, over time the QPQ tool transitioned for a lot of editors from purely something meant to check whether you needed to do a QPQ or not into something more like a log of one's DYK credits. If we go the direction of having a bot do the QPQ check, it'd be nice to also build out a better tool for listing one's credits (which would ideally include the hook used, pageviews garnered, etc.). Cheers, Sdkb talk\n\nI think for now I will focus on automation that directly assist DYK reviews. For listing credits, I think it makes sense to add that functionality to the current tool rather than making a whole new one. @Sohom Datta: Would you be interested in taking this on? I could potentially contribute some code to this when I have more time. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\n@Mokadoshi My intial tool was more a bandaid implementation given that the original tool had been taken offline by it's creator. I've gone implemented basic credits for the tool. (Can be accessed at https://qpqtool.toolforge.org/credits/<username>) and fixed the ordering to be cronological. I can work on this further to integrate page views (any maybe hooks) in a while (say a week?).\n\nRegarding your idea of automating QPQs, while this is something I have considered looking into, I'm personally of the opinion that this probably isn't a good task for a bot, since judging if a QPQ meets the threshold of a proper review will probably need human intervention (for example, a simple tick with no comments might not be considered a adequate QPQ by some editors, especially if issues are discovered with the article at a later date). I'm however open to being convinced otherwise, and will be happy to help with any such automation. Sohom (talk)\n\nI think, at the very least, a bot task that states whether or not the nominator requires a QPQ or not could work. Sure, we'd still need to manually check the QPQ reviews if needed. Still, it should least it should save us time if, for example, the QPQ field is left empty and we know from the start that a QPQ was not needed, instead of it being a case of a veteran forgetting to do a QPQ. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nI agree that the reduced scope mentioned by Narutolovehinata5 would be a nice starting point for a bot. :) Sohom (talk)\n\nI submitted this bot idea to BRFA and I was suggested to just change Module:NewDYKnomination which I agree with. It would be a better user experience if the nomination wizard told the nominator right away that a QPQ check was needed, and if they don't give one, it could just say so right away when the nom is submitted. But I don't have any experience changing modules, so I'll need to do some research. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\n@Mokadoshi The nomination wizard and the module are different components, so if what you want is to determine whether a QPQ is required at the nomination Wizard stage (a good idea) you'll want to talk to SD0001 about modifying MediaWiki:DYK-nomination-wizard.js. I haven't looked at it closely, but it shouldn't be any harder than loading the json page and displaying a message. The module is what is used when the DYK templates get substituted either by the wizard or manually, and if the goal is to have some publicly visible comment on QPQ requirements, then the module is the way to go. If you're new to Lua, I recommend the reference manual on MediaWiki. As SD0001 mentioned at the bot request, a lot of the code is already written: see this diff for the relevant changes. The module has changed a bit since then, so someone will need to merge it into the main template and run a few tests. I have limited time at the moment, so I can't commit to doing that, but it's a good project for someone interested in learning about module editing. I'm happy to explain the code in the draft if that's helpful too, just email or ping me. — Wug·a·po·des\n\nI think modifying just the module is good enough. The wizard provides a preview button which invokes the module - so anyone who's previewing the nomination would already see the QPQ requirement. Modifying the wizard as well to convey the same in a better way, without having to preview, is probably still an improvement. I can review the changes if someone works on that but can't commit to doing it myself. – SD0001 (talk)\n\nI will commit to continuing this work, although it won’t be done immediately. But it is on my radar for the next few weeks. Mokadoshi (talk)\n\nFor many hooks about things like creative works, we have the option to use two different formats:\n\n... that [interesting fact] in [creative work]?\n\n... that in [creative work], [interesting fact]?\n\nMy current nom is an example (of #1), but there are many others in many different areas. I'm wondering, is there any accumulated wisdom about which option leads to better performance? If so, it might be good to record it in a hook tips document (if that hasn't already been done). If not, we might want to AB test it (although that'd require us to run the test hooks twice, given that pageview data is only available per-day). Sdkb talk\n\nConventional wisdom says to put the boldlink as close to the beginning of the hook as you can, but I don't know that there'd be any hard data backing it up (someone comb through WP:DYKSTATS). RoySmith floated AB testing at DYK a while ago – I'd been turning it over in my head for a long time, and would really be interested in trying it, but i don't think we've ever come to a consensus on it. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nMy personal opinion, without any evidence to support it, is that there should only be one link in the entire hook, and it should link only to the article. I realize that's going to be controversial, but from now on, that's how I'm going to construct all of my hooks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThat is indeed how I construct my hooks as well :) it's not an unheard-of rule, we do it for DAB pages. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nIf the goal was solely to get as many views on the hook article as possible, then yes, that would be the optimal approach. But see Goodhart's law (relevant xkcd) — driving views to other articles that readers end up finding interesting is perfectly alright. Sdkb talk\n\nIt's not solely that, but DYK exists to highlight new and interesting articles, which is best served by focusing reader traffic. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nI'm pretty much a one-link-per-hook guy. I know I've told this story recently, but don't remember where... There's a truism in the software world; the more options you give the user, the more chances you give them to do the wrong thing. That's usually said with respect to configuration screens (the user will inevitably find some combination of options you never thought anybody would use). I think the same goes for hooks. If you want them to click on the bolded hook, don't give them any distractions. RoySmith (talk)\n\nIf we decided to run the A version of a hook set from noon to midnight and then the B version of the same hooks from midnight to noon of the next day, we could gather some imperfect data without giving an article more than 24 hours on the Main Page. —Kusma (talk)\n\n@Kusma: There's a significant pageviews bias between the A and B sets, so this wouldn't be ideal. I'd prefer a {{random item}} where either just the B or both sets link to redirects, and then we measure the views of the redirects. Bonus: if we do the redirects strat, the pageviews will be much more reliable and we won't have to guess what the \"background\" views are. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nYes, that's better. We should probably fully protect the redirects to avoid the WP:BEANS of WP:MPNOREDIRECT if we do that. —Kusma (talk)\n\nThat sounds like a very good approach, @Theleekycauldron. If anyone wants to compile a set that'd allow us to test, I'd offer my support. The additional effort it'd take seems worth it for the information we'd glean (so long as we bother to document that info — is there any page compiling advice about how to make a high-performing hook beyond the one FAQ answer I wrote?). Sdkb talk\n\nWP:DYKSTATS and User: Theleekycauldron/Essays/Assessing DYK hooks :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nI support that type of testing combined with the measures suggested by Kusma. Schwede66\n\nis there a way to track views for a specific anchor? if so, i would suggest using links such as \"[[example article#hook x|link text]]\" to avoid having to use redirects. also, the main page is cached, so i think, in order for this to work with a decent amount of accuracy, the main page should be purged every t seconds, where t is small enough to generate reliable data, but large enough to avoid putting undue strain on the servers. dying (talk)\n\n@dying: specific anchor tracking doesn't work, no; data dumps are published by page and day. Good point about purging; I'd say 30 seconds? theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\noh, that is good to know, theleekycauldron. my second suggestion would have been to use links like \"{{plain link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/example_article?hook=x|name=link text}}\", but that idea seems to suffer from the same issue. regarding the timing of the cache refreshes, to me, requesting a refresh every 30 seconds seems a bit demanding on the server, but i might be too old to determine what would be a reasonable time interval nowadays, as i remember a time before ddos attacks were common. for reference, generating the main page takes about 500 ms of real time, so refreshing the cache every 30 seconds over one day would cost maybe about 24 minutes of real time. by the way, here's a radical idea: what if dyk sets were replaced at 23:00 every day instead of at 00:00? if page hits are only published for each day, i believe we normally wouldn't be able to implement RoySmith's of using the results of the testing during the start of an article's appearance at dyk to determine which hook to use for the rest of the appearance. by having a set's appearance span over two different calendar days, we could use the testing results of the first calendar day to determine which hook to use during the second calendar day. there are, admittedly, many reasons why we shouldn't implement this, but it's such an interesting possibility that i thought i might mention it anyway. dying (talk)\n\nAlthough it's often been suggested that putting the subject earlier at the front is better, I think it's more of a case-by-case thing and depends on the hook itself and the hook fact. Sometimes, it's better if it's at the front to immediately get attention, and other times it's better if the subject is a punchline. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\ndefinitely true in certain circumstances – see Gay Jesus film hoax. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nI'm not sure I see the point of running different variations of the same hook to see whether or not they work better with the bolded link nearer the start, except as an academic exercise, because trying to engineer hooks that way would decrease set variety.\n\nWith regard to the question of number of links in a hook though, I am strongly in favour of multiple links where appropriate, because our primary purpose is education, which means allowing people to click on topics they are actually curious about, rather than trying to force them to contribute to DYK page hits. Gatoclass (talk)\n\nYes. I think that links should be included for side topics that might be interesting to readers. If the purpose of DYK as a whole is to increase interaction of readers with the encyclopedia, that purpose is served when they click on a link, even if it is not the main link of a hook. —David Eppstein (talk)\n\nIf anyone is interested I dumped the archives of Did You Know and it's now accessible via a searchable interface here. I also included traffic statistics in the dump going back to 2018 if anyone wants to do analysis. We're nearing 100k DYKs total (and the count in my table is low because I filtered out DYKs with multiple bolded words... for my own reasons). BrokenSegue\n\nBased on the discussion above, I wanted to grab this hook as the replacement. But it doesn't check out. Only ALT0 appears to be correct. Not that the hooks are numbered, but if we were to number them, ALT1 and ALT2 are incorrect as it's not the floors that are slanted, but the roofs. I couldn't verify ALT3 either as the source simply does not say anything about perspectives. I wonder what else is wrong; maybe this should undergo another review. Schwede66\n\nJust had a flick through. I would not even have approved ALT0 because its cite is well past the end of its sentence. (My review would have gone something like \"Long enough, new enough, every para cited. No neutrality issues found, no maintenance templates found. Earwig picks up on the phrase \"on top of each other\", although I can't think of another way of wording that, so I think you'll be alright. QPQ unnecessary and image CC-BY-SA 4.0. Only ALT0 checks out to the source, and even then you'd need a cite at the end of the sentence; the source mentions that the roofs were slanted rather than the floors, and does not mention perspectives. Please fix this.\")--Launchballer\n\nHook has been pulled for now; discussion, including the new review, can continue on the nomination page. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\n@Lightburst, Paul 012, and MaranoFan: This is not a good image for the main page. It fails \"must display well in the small size\" from WP:DYKIMG. RoySmith (talk)\n\nRoySmith Might be my Fault for promoting the full photo instead of the nom image. Lightburst (talk)\n\nThere was a crop but it didn't show enough of the structure. I've produced a new crop and I suggest that photo is fine. What do you think, RoySmith? Schwede66\n\nSorry to be a downer, but it really is a poor photo. Low contrast, dark, nearly monochromatic. I just don't see it working. RoySmith (talk)\n\nI'm happy for you to use another hook for the lead. Schwede66\n\nWell, to be honest, I feel I did my bit by reviewing 9 hooks, so I'm hoping somebody else will rise to the occasion and find a replacement. RoySmith (talk)\n\nOk, I'll deal with it. Schwede66\n\nMuch appreciated. RoySmith (talk)\n\nAll sorted. Schwede66\n\nSchwede66, please add a space before \"that\" on the new lead hook, to separate it from the initial ellipsis. Many thanks.

If people don't think this is necessary then it would be useful for me to know that as well. Seddon talk\n\nRjjiii and I have done some copy editing. I think that is sufficient. TSventon (talk)\n\n@Lightburst @Governor Sheng @AirshipJungleman29 there's a sentence (\"Both he and Babić are credited with adapting Latin grammar ...\") that's almost word-for-word from http://hrcak.srce.hr/en/file/446981. That should get reworded. RoySmith (talk)\n\nIt looks like JimKillock made many copyedits later on 10 March, but none of them addressed this particular issue. There are only nine hours until this gets promoted to the main page. RoySmith, should it be pulled pending a copyvio fix? BlueMoonset (talk)\n\nYes it should be pulled, but unfortunately I don't have the time to do that now, so perhaps another of the @DYK admins: could take care of it? RoySmith (talk)\n\nOr, perhaps one of the editors here can reword that sentence? Assuming of course there are no other issues. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nI have modified the offending sentence in the article. Feel free to make changes. Z1720 (talk)\n\nThanks, that works. My first thought had been to just turn it into an attributed quote, but the article uses a citation system that I don't know much about so I was unable to make that work. RoySmith (talk)\n\nI modified it a little further to capture the original meaning Jim Killock (talk)\n\nI wasn't looking for copyvios but for non-native English phraseologies, such as minor errors relating to definite object and general flow. I may even have inadvertently rephrased to cory phraseologies that turn out to be close to prior art for all I know. There's a tool for detecting copyvios (which screws up as it knows nothing about CC-0 licensing and bulk copying of WP for example) - if someome could point me to that I don't mind having a quick look and making edits. Jim Killock (talk)\n\nThe first sentence is identical to https://m.famousfix.com/list/chinese-mythology-in-popular-culture. I'm reasonably sure they copied from us, but another pair of eyes to confirm that would be appreciated. RoySmith (talk)\n\nI don't believe there is a cause for concern; it's a user-generated site which almost certainly copied us.

Prodraxis (talk)\n\nSince Prep 7 is about 100-200 characters shorter than other preps I want to try a ninth hook in that prep. Without objection and with fingers crossed that I do not break the whole thing. Bruxton (talk)\n\nFound that Prep 6 was short on characters so I also placed a ninth hook in that prep. Bruxton (talk)\n\nUsually, I can keep an eye on the hooks ticking over as it's 1pm local time for me when that happens. However, I'm travelling this weekend. Not sure where I'll be when Q/P6 goes live, but I'll definitely be out and about (and away from a computer) for Q/P7. Fingers crossed that it goes well, with nothing breaking. Shubinator, can you keep an eye on things, please? Schwede66\n\nHere's my suggestion from a software engineering point of view. Let's not make any more 9-hook preps until these get through the entire process onto the main page. I don't expect anything will go wrong, but if there is some unexpected problem, better to find it out when we've just got 2 preps to deal with. RoySmith (talk)\n\nDYKUpdateBot doesn't care about the number of hooks in a set; it can handle an arbitrary amount, until it starts running out of memory (which would be well over a thousand hooks, if not millions). Shubinator (talk)\n\nNoted. I too will be traveling starting tomorrow and may not be back until around the 18th. But I will monitor by hand held device. Bruxton (talk)\n\nI see 9 hooks on the main page, and doesn't look like anything blew up. Cool. I'm half expecting somebody to pop up on WP:ERRORS saying we ran too many hooks :-) RoySmith (talk)\n\nSince we seem to have managed to run nine hooks without problems and nobody appears to have any issues with doing so, can you please amend PSHAW to allow for that increased number, theleekycauldron? Schwede66\n\n@Schwede66: Glad to see it was smooth. For now we can use the extra hook in Pshaw. There is an option for a ninth hook. Promotors may have to move hooks if the eight quirky hook is replace by a ninth hook. Bruxton (talk)\n\nAh ok. I'll have to have another look; couldn't see that the other day when I tried it out. Schwede66\n\nI was just looking over the DYK hook format rules, and it occurs to me, that unless I missed it, nowhere does it say the hook has to be one single sentence. Am I misreading this? Have we run hooks that are multiple sentences or sentence fragments? Thanks to Coretheapple for stumping me. Viriditas (talk)\n\nYou're correct; in fact, iirc, in the old Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines, a note that read \"does the hook have to be a single sentence?\" was listed under the category of \"'Rules' sometimes invoked but lacking consensus\". However, you'd need a very good reason why you want to break from the format we've been using for a very long time, it shouldn't just be on a lark. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\n@Theleekycauldron: this is in regards to ALT2 here. Any suggestions on how to proceed? Viriditas (talk)\n\nseems like you could just turn the period into a colon? theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nYes, that was my initial thought. Still, it reads funny to me even with the colon. But, on the other hand, I do like its novel approach. Do you know off the top of your head of other hooks like this? Viriditas (talk)\n\nWould it be too much to change the formatting of the hook quite a bit while still trying to lean into this hook fact by having the hook read, \"Did you know...?\"\n\nthat \"I was Farkas\"?\n\nPartly inspired by the hook for \"Well he would, wouldn't he?\", which ran like \"Did you know...\n\n...that \"he would, wouldn't he\"?\n\nThough—I don't mean to be a spoilsport, but I'm wondering a little about the sentence that provides the hook fact in the article. Is that cited only to the memoir itself? If so, I'm worried about it being accidental original research extrapolating from this interaction with Dr. Farkas, or if Debreczeni actually goes out of his way to say that the prisoners he knew in general spoke of themselves in the past tense. P-Makoto (she/her) (talk)\n\nI haven't completed the review yet, but I think it's assumed the secondary sources cover this. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI think that'd be discouraged by the interactions in this thread. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nYes a secondary source is cited among the sources in small print. Coretheapple (talk)\n\nI added a cite from the sourcing in the article as well, with a snippet from the source.(\"'was' was the crucial word\") Coretheapple (talk)\n\nResolved\n\nI am not an admin, but someone should really promote Prep 5... except I'm involved with Angelle/Sarah Bennett and Paula Arai, Mosque of Ulmas al-Hajib (@R Prazeres and TheLonelyPather:) does not check out at all (\"flat\" is not in quotes in the article and I can't find the word 'first' in the article) and I can't see a monetary amount given on Bow Lake (SeaTac, Washington) (@DirtyHarry991 and 4meter4:). Can these be addressed/replaced?--Launchballer\n\nwhy oh why must i get myself into these things in finals week? promoted one queue :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\n@Launchballer I fixed the issue at Bow Lake. I had checked the hook fact was in the reference but must have forgot to double check that the entire form of the hook fact was properly in the article. It was sort of there, but without the specific monetary value. I have modified the text to match the hook with an inline citation. It's all good now.4meter4 (talk)\n\nIf the quotation marks matter at all, I've added them in the article for now ([3]) to avoid further confusion. (They didn't seem necessary in context there, I added them more instinctively in the hook.) As for \"first\", this is explained in the same paragraph of the article: \"This is the earliest known example of this kind of muqarnas canopy in Cairo [...]\" R Prazeres (talk)\n\nBoth fine.--Launchballer\n\n@HouseOfChange, Josh Milburn, and PrimalMustelid:\n\nThe first paragraph in the \"Career\" section needs a citation. I have added a citation needed template to indicate the location. Z1720 (talk)\n\nThanks for the heads up. I added citations needed. HouseOfChange (talk)\n\nMy concerns have been resolved. Z1720 (talk)\n\n... that Woodrow Wilson, Hermann Collitz, and Carey Thomas all taught at Bryn Mawr College before becoming presidents?\n\nLooking at this hook again, I'm not sure about this. Firstly, the hook doesn't actually seem to be primarily about Collitz given that it seems to be somewhat tangential (he's mentioned along with other names). Secondly, the hook doesn't seem all that interesting given that if a reader isn't familiar with the college, they won't get why teaching or becoming president there is a big deal. Yes Wilson is mentioned, but still. An ALT1 was proposed, which the reviewer wasn't a fan of. Can that be revisited or is something else needed here?\n\nCourtesy ping to the nominator Wugapodes, reviewer SeoR, and promoter PrimalMustelid. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nThe hook is about teachers at Bryn Mawr in the 1880s later becoming presidents of the USA, the Linguistic Society of America and Bryn Mawr College so perhaps it should have been in the quirky slot. TSventon (talk)\n\nFirstly, the hook doesn't actually seem to be primarily about Collitz Honestly this was a hesitation I had when proposing it, but I decided it was fun enough to propose and see where others land on it. While not solely about Collitz, it highlights one of his accomplishments as well as his professional associations (important enough that they were mentioned in his wife's biography of him). As the author of the Collitz article, I'm happy to share the lime light as long as the hook is interesting and the other content is good. I think it's fun, but if others have other suggestions of good hooks I'm open to ideas. Secondly, the hook doesn't seem all that interesting given that if a reader isn't familiar with the college, they won't get why teaching or becoming president there is a big deal. Yes Wilson is mentioned, but still. I think it's interesting, and whether the reader is familiar or not I think it drives traffic to the articles; it leads to the obvious question \"presidents of what?\" The mention of Wilson is meant to contrast with Collitz and Thomas (one of these things is not like the other) on the assumption that most readers would recognize Woodrow Wilson as a US president, but recognize Collitz and Thomas were not, prompting readers to actually go to the articles to learn more. I think an interesting hook does more than just give a reader a random fact, it prompts engagement with our content and gets them deeper into the website. The proposed alt was essentially \"German linguist knows lots of languages\" which doesn't elicit much more than an \"okay\" from me. I don't see how it drives reader engagement. It's certainly more straightforward, but I wouldn't call it interesting. — Wug·a·po·des\n\nMaybe it's a limitation of certain Western audiences, but even as a non-American, I got the point of the hook without prompting. I did think, \"maybe the subject should appear first of the three?\" but it is clear why Woodrow Wilson leads in - he's the instant-recognition, \"what's the trick here?\" catch. I liked the idea of \"three presidents of what?\". On the alt, I just didn't see the point as very special or \"hook-y\". I will take another look at the article for other potential, but I think this hook still has merit.

I really can't believe that anyone would ever choose to use these butt ugly things. --User:Khajidha (talk) (contributions)\n\nJust because YOU can't stand it does not mean nobody can. IonlyPlayz2 (talk)\n\nAs somebody who also finds dark mode screens difficult to read, I get where @Khajidha is coming from. The bottom line (despite my joke about the eclipse pages) is that we should leave presentation issues like dark mode up to the end user who can configure their browser and/or wiki skin any way they want. RoySmith (talk)\n\ni see, I agree. IonlyPlayz2 (talk)\n\n@Prince of Erebor, Geardona, and PrimalMustelid:\n\n... that the 2023 drama film Time Still Turns the Pages won the Audience Choice Award at the 60th Golden Horse Awards?\n\nThe source used to verify this statement (archived version here) does not mention the audience award. Can another source be used to verify this information? Z1720 (talk)\n\n@Z1720:That's strange. I checked the sources before submitting the DYK nomination, and the hook in question is actually an alternate one that I didn't intend to use. The first hook I submitted was related to the film's title, and it was approved during the review process. Here is another source from Taipei Times that backs the alternate hook,[1] but may I ask if it would be possible to use the original hook instead?--Prince of Erebor（The Book of Mazarbul）\n\nReferences\n\nHello,\n\nIf I recall correctly, I approved the first hook; (on good faith, because it required translation, I translated it, but not sure about the accuracy) so using the first may well be ok. Geardona (talk to me?)\n\nThe evidence supporting the hook can be found in the introduction of the source, where the key words (the film title, band name, and song name) are written in English. The last line of the first paragraph translates as follows: \"The English film title is \"Time still turns the pages\". Director Nick Cheuk mentioned that the inspiration came from the song \"So Far Away\" by the American avant-garde metal band Avenged Sevenfold, dedicated to their deceased drummer and teammate.\"--Prince of Erebor（The Book of Mazarbul）\n\nah, I just copy-pasted it into google translate, so guess I missed that. Geardona (talk to me?)\n\n@Daniel Case, David Gerard, Gronk Oz, and PrimalMustelid:\n\n... that online social and \"Barstool conservatives\" spent their Christmas holidays arguing about whether a beer promotional calendar was \"demonic\"?\n\nThe word demonic has been put in quotation marks, but does not appear in the article. This will need to be resolved, either by adding the word to the article and citing it, or rephrasing the hook. Z1720 (talk)\n\nMust have got lost on the way. I've put it back in, with two cites. Thanks for catching that - David Gerard (talk)\n\nRight now, WP:DYKG states that a nomination that is late by one or two days, an IAR exemption can be granted. For longer cases, it is advised to instead ask for an IAR exemption here, or sometimes at the nomination page (at the reviewer's discretion).\n\nWith this in mind, around how many days extra is considered too much? Our guidelines suggest that 1-2 days with the nominator requesting is fine, and in practice, we tend to accept articles that are just over 7 days old but younger than 8 days. So in practice, the actual limit is around nine days. Would ten be considered extra, eleven, twelve, or is this something that should be considered on a case-by-case basis? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\n@Narutolovehinata5 I support IARs, with justifiction for new editors or special cases. We already have a well estabilished exemption for special occasions (we accept nominations, then wait to display \"new\" content for months). Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nI have a special occasion hook at DYKN/Singh v Canada that needs a review; I would like it to run on 4 April (3 weeks from now). Thanks. – Reidgreg (talk)\n\nHook was reviewed and approved by Gerda Arendt (talk). After the bot moved it to the approved page, I manually moved it to the special occasions holding area (diff). Hope that is correct. – Reidgreg (talk)\n\nI think we should address the issue of complete rewrites and DYK. The problem is that current rules reduce motivation for rewrites; I find they affect among others my choice of topics to work on. Here are two very recent examples (that I was not involved in from the content creation) that I am aware of. In both cases, I feel the involved content creators should be allowed to have their work displayed at DYK, but I was just adviced by @BlueMoonset that they are likely not eligible. I find it, well, unfair.\n\nExample 1: existing crappy article is about to be deleted at AfD (Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Inertialess drive (2nd nomination)). User:Lubal created a new version in their sandbox that likely will replace the existing content. Yet both articles are roughly equal at size/readable prose/etc, so Lubal is not eligible to have his commendable efforts recognized at DYK.\n\nExample 2: As part of Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tachyons in fiction (2nd nomination), the old mess of an article which was about to be deleted was rewritten by User:TompaDompa and User:Daranios into a totally new but correctly written encyclopedic article. But as the old version was a bloated list of trivia, the new version is not an 5x expansion, but a 4x reduction :> It is also stubby, but I know that TompaDompa or I can easily expand it to beyond the stub lenght. Yet, while I cannot speak for TompaDompa, I know that the current DYK rules make me not particularly motivated in doing so :(\n\nBottom line, I think in cases of WP:TNT rewrites of existing content, new articles should be treated as, well, new. Or in other words, content that is deleted from an article should not count towards expansion requirements; it is ridcolous that some bloated pieces of garbage stand in a way of improving content and displaying it on the front page, deying recognition to folks who improve Wikipedia in this fashin. We need to fix our system of motivating folks and encourage more rewrites of old, bad bloats. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nWhile I see where you are coming from, I think our restriction of rewrites to expansions and GAs is needed to avoid flooding DYK even more. —Kusma (talk)\n\nI have to agree with Piotrus that this disincentivizes fixing articles. It's not a decisive factor for me—for instance, WP:Articles for deletion/Time viewer led to me rewriting the article from scratch and then bringing it to WP:Good article status thus making it eligible for DYK anyway, and WP:Articles for deletion/Loch Ness Monster in popular culture (2nd nomination) led to me rewriting the article from scratch without bringing it to DYK—but I can definitely see it being so for others. I'll admit I'm not sure how to formulate a hypothetical new rule for this, however. One way of doing it might be to say that if the page is blanked, or nearly so, during the course of a rewrite then that counts as the \"old\" version from which 5x expansion may be counted—but this might not be the best solution. TompaDompa (talk)\n\nFixing articles is also its own reward, and many people (those who do not take part at DYK, GA, TFA etc.) do so without any extrinsic motivation. We should not make people expect an additional reward for everything good they do. —Kusma (talk)\n\nI agree that it is its own reward—I've fixed a fair number of articles myself without bringing them to GA/DYK/FAC—but I think there is an imbalance of incentives. Lest we forget, fixing an article both removes a bad article and creates a good article. Should we not—both out of a sense of fairness and to encourage fixing poor articles—incentivize this as much as we do creating new articles or expanding short ones? TompaDompa (talk)\n\nOn the contrary, both examples can still appear at DYK, if they pass a GA review. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nI get the sentiment this idea, but many articles are just not good fits for GA. Either that or it would just be too difficult to bring them to GA for various reasons. This is a shame since it would meant they're deprived of a chance to be on DYK if they weren't already nominated when they were initially eligible. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nRight. And many were never eligible initially because they were a mess from day one. That said, everything can be theoretically GA/FAed. The thing is, current rules make it (slightly) less likely some topics will be, because they deny the incentice that some editors like to get the process started. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nIf you first remove all the bad content, greatly reducing the article size, can't you count that as the 'starting point' prior to expansion? Then perform the edits to put in the good content to get the 5× expansion. Legitimate removal of bad material, particularly if it's been tagged for a while, shouldn't be arguable. (On another note, if you do go the GA route, prior AfDs would qualify for Deletion to Quality Awards.) – Reidgreg (talk)\n\nSuch as? Everything except lists can be GA'd. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nDonald Trump is currently in the middle of a presidential election, multiple criminal court cases, and civil court cases. His page has been protected for years and likely will be for the foreseeable future since people take the time to make edit requests to ask for clearly disruptive modifications.[4][5] It would be a waste of time to nominate that article for GA regardless of the page's content. Another example would be someone notable for a wrongful conviction where the initial trial/conviction was heavily reported, but reliable secondary sources did not cover how it was overturned. However, messy cases like that would require a lot of scrutiny, and the whole idea proposed here runs the risk of duplicating GA once it's thought through. Rjjiii (talk)\n\nDonald Trump can be GAed in the future once he is a historical figure. As for duplication, I'd assume article DYKed after TNTed would be ineligible for a second DYK when it reaches GA level - just like normal articles which can be DYKed once, not twice (correct me if I am wrong...). Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nNot really, there's a gap between the breadth of sourcing GNG provides as a minimum and the breadth of sourcing required for a GA. All of my articles would be GAs if it weren't for that thin sourcing. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nHello\n\nHere is my idea for one of the April fools day hooks\n\n“Did you know that Wikipedia’s Main Page (pictured) is not eligible for did you know?”\n\nIdeas? Geardona (talk to me?)\n\nWhile a fun idea, the main page already had a joke DYK nomination a few years ago. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nThanks for the reply, I guess I have to wait for a few more years then. Geardona (talk to me?)\n\nAlthough this one did not pass, so could this possibly still make it on the main page? Geardona (talk to me?)\n\nFirst five preps are all full, though – if (an) admin(s) could look them over and make sure they're ready for raking to the queues, it would be greatly appreciated. Dylan620 (he/him • talk • edits)\n\nI really wish I could, but I'm far too swamped with finals coming up. A week from now, I'll handle things, promise. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nI feel your pain leeky – take however much time you need to focus on what you need to do. Dylan620 (he/him • talk • edits)\n\nI think we should ping the @DYK admins: , just to make sure they know about this. Epicgenius (talk)\n\nIf we're going to keep doing these 9 hook sets, I gotta start charging more. RoySmith (talk)\n\nMoved one in that Schwede reviewed - reviewing another that I just moved in as well. —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\nGanesha811, just for clarity, I reviewed the last hook in that set only. Schwede66\n\nAh, ok, I'll check the others, thanks for clarifying. —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\nIs there a formula or set of rules to assess when we are suppose to be in and out of backlog mode?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nYeah, per WP:DYKROTATE we rotate to two sets per day \"if we are at one set per day and immediately after the midnight (UTC) update finishes there are more than 120 approved nominations while at least ten prep/queue sets are filled\". We're at two queues and five preps currently.--Launchballer\n\nthat's the wrong kind of backlog mode. qpq backlog mode is started and ended by community consensus :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nWhat is this \"community consensus\" you speak of? I don't believe I'm familiar with that concept in the context of DYK. RoySmith (talk)\n\n:P theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nOops, did not see the word 'QPQ' in the header.--Launchballer\n\n2nd question: Is backlog mode enforced based on nomination date or review initiation date or review approval date? I have nominated two items since March 8 that have not had reviews initated. I am about to nominate a triple subject hook that may not be reviewed for weeks. Backlog mode could be retracted/receeded while a review is under way.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nAre DYK admins making sure approved noms are adhering to backlog mode. I approved Template:Did you know nominations/Fabrizio Dori and no one seemed to notice it had used doubled QPQs. It would have gone unnoticed if I had not had a review initiated by a reviewer who knew of backlog mode.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nIt's nomination date.--Launchballer\n\nAlso, editors who have nominated twenty or more articles are required to provide an extra QPQ for every new nomination so a triple subject hook would only need one extra QPQ. TSventon (talk)\n\nthis set of edits represents my findings in Approved hooks that seemed to have slipped through the cracks. I did see User:Launchballer passing along info to many that had slipped through.\n\nThe lead hook in the set that will be hitting the main page in 13 hours also seems to be an at issue nomination. I did not chime in on its DYK talk, due to its pendency on the main page. I would hope this one submits another QPQ. User:FatCat96 is the nominator in violation of the WP:QPQ backlog. I am about to check the preps, but am reporting in because of the short clock on upcoming lead hook.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger Do you mean Joseph Bosworth? That article was nominated and approved back in February, so it shouldn't be subject to the double QPQ rule. Cielquiparle (talk)\n\nI misread Feb as March in my haste. False alarm. Nothing in the preps or queues at issue.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger I made mistakes in the other direction and found myself donating QPQs to prolific DYK nominators who didn't need them, so I think it all comes out in the wash. Cielquiparle (talk)\n\nAs pointed out above TonyTheTiger, you have misunderstood something. Please take the time to check whether the nominators you notified have less than twenty QPQs, in which case they do not need to provide double QPQs. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nGiven the number of errors I have discovered in his QPQ requests, I would like to strongly suggest that TonyTheTiger refrain from requesting any further additional QPQs. Thank you. BlueMoonset (talk)\n\nIn hindsight with my nom, Launchballer had already left a note there that an extra QPQ was needed, but Tony slapped on another notice anyways, which I had orginally just thought was an AGF oversight at the time, but now...—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI understand the issue with the tool's start date. Also, now understand 1 per nom, not per nominated article. It seemed that there were a bunch of QPQ backlog oversights, but there were just a couple.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@LlywelynII, AirshipJungleman29, PrimalMustelid, and Ganesha811:\n\nI suggest replacing\n\n... that Xu Garden was created by benevolent members of the public grateful for their local warlord? with\n\n... that Xu Garden was created by local residents grateful to their local warlord?\n\nAlternatively the nomination could be pulled.\n\nThe source used to verify this statement\n\nZhang Xiaohui (2015), \"An Analysis of the Gardens Reflecting Democratic Revolution in the Republic of China\" (PDF), International Conference on Arts, Design, and Contemporary Education, Amsterdam: Atlantis Press is poorly translated and appears to be a student paper so it may not be reliable. It says there also existed gardens to memorate warlords. Such as Yangzhou warlord Xu Baoshan, he cared masses and did practical things for them, so they built Xu garden to memorate him. and does not explicitly mention benevolence or members of the public.\n\nTSventon (talk)\n\nI think that's fine, I had noticed that the source was not in the world's best English, and your suggested modification is probably a little safer since the source is not 100% clear. —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\nModified with 'community residents' instead of 'local' to avoid redundancy. —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\n@Ganesha811, it looks like you accidentally removed the bold markup from the link when modifying the hook: Special:Diff/1214358526. An admin is needed to add it back. Liu1126 (talk)\n\nDone. —Kusma (talk)\n\nAt over 200 nominations, the backlog of nominations at WP:DYKN has grown so large that the WP:PEIS limit has been breached, and nominations are no longer transcluding. I would recommend activating the \"emergency backlog mode\" mentioned at WP:DYKQPQ, where nominators of more than 20 articles are required to provide two QPQs. Do other people agree? ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nI have no objection if other editors agree. For new editors: I do not want to go off the rails, but I have always thought 5 free noms before a qpq was too many. I think my own experience is that I got the hang of it somewhere between my second and third nomination. Bruxton (talk)\n\nOne problem aggravating the size of the DYKN page—though not a large part of the issue—is the switchover from {{DYK conditions}} to {{DYK tools}} in each nomination template: the former would only place the DYK tools box at the top of the page when viewing the page directly, while the latter also includes the tools box when the page is transcluded. We have over two dozen transclusions here so far, and a few on the Approved page as well. I've posted the issue to Template talk:DYK tools, where the change was discussed; hopefully it will be taken care of by them. BlueMoonset (talk)\n\n@DYK admins: , any objections? The WP:DYKN backlog has been reduced slightly, but will continue to grow until it breaches the WP:PEIS limit again. I think activating the emergency mode from 00:00 UTC 8 March would be beneficial. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nGo for it. The worst that could happens is it's a disaster and then we undo it. RoySmith (talk)\n\nSeconded. —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\n@AirshipJungleman29: When will it be receeded? What is the benchmark to go back to 1 QPQ for everyone? Z1720 (talk)\n\nThe discussions (see the top section and one further down in Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 182) were before my time; looking at those discussions, I don't think a consensus was reached. As this is the first time the mode will be implemented, I think it's a matter of crossing the bridge when we come to it (in fact, EEng said something very similar in those discussions). ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nWill it be possible to count how many extra QPQs are used due to backlog mode? Presumably nominators and reviewers may not notice we are in backlog mode immediately, so prep builders will have to double check. TSventon (talk)\n\nAnother question: could there be support for backlog mode in the nomination wizard? I've done double QPQs on an informal basis for several recent nominations but have done it by going back to the nomination template page and manually adding the second QPQ. If it were in the wizard it might help make it more obvious to nominators that it is expected. —David Eppstein (talk)\n\nleeky? Gatoclass (talk)\n\nI'm thinking it's time for the nomination wizard to moved out of SD0001's userspace. Either that, or I should go get WP:INTADMIN perms and become a maintainer. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nThe nomination wizard is not in my userspace and anyone who knows JS can propose edits. (The DYK-helper is, however. I suggested back in '21 to eliminate this alternate interface by just making it a link that opens the DYK-wizard in a new tab. But not everyone was aligned.) – SD0001 (talk)\n\nIs the deficit a function of waived reviews for 5 or less DYKs being a higher frequency than rejected reviews? Are there additional factors? Would lowering the waiver to 1, 2 or 3 make the backlog mode unnecessary?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI'd be in favour of lowering the waiver to 3 (and personally I feel if people are participating in the Wikicup, I'd put it to zero). Seddon talk\n\nYes, the deficit builds up over time as a function of the waived nominati0ons rule for first time participants. Regular participants in the project are swapping 1:1 reviewed for unreviewed. Barring rare extenuating circumstances (eg multi-nomination hooks), the only increase in backlog is the new editors. I agree with Seddon and Bruxton that 5 is possibly too many and dropping down to 2 or three would slow the problem down.--Kevmin §\n\nWith my DYK admin hat on, I am opposed to any move that lowers the quality of reviews, as poor reviews cause a lot of work later on in the process. The current 5 freebies mean that newbies are likely to have experienced a decent review before they need to contribute one of their own. It is better if experienced reviewers do more work than if beginners have to do work that they do not have the necessary experience for. —Kusma (talk)\n\nI wonder if then it makes sense to up the minimum character amount bar? Seddon talk\n\nMinimum characters in the article? I'm all for an increase in the length requirement, but there was a lot of opposition last time this was discussed (people were concerned this would lead to useless filler text instead of better articles). —Kusma (talk)\n\n@Kusma: I couldn't agree more – DYK is very insular on Wikipedia. Most of the power over shaping it is wielded by its regulars, not from the wider community, and because of that, we're a layer of impenetrability on top of the already existing layer of impenetrability that is getting involved onwiki at all. Weakning the five-freebie rule steepens the learning curve and makes it harder for newer editors to get hooked on Wikipedia through DYK. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nThat's another good point. We should try not to have any unavoidable barriers to participation, and QPQ reviews are in effect such a barrier. Let us try to not make people hit this barrier too early. —Kusma (talk)\n\n@Kusma and Theleekycauldron: both make great points regarding lowering the QPQ threshold. I'm wondering what other levers we have at our disposal? Seddon talk\n\nIs anyone noticing how much slower new nominations have been coming in since people have become aware of the backlog mode. Probably once we take backlog mode off, there will be a stampede of new nominations.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nNope, not true. We've gotten ~90 new nominations in the past week, which is slightly more than we got the week before. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nThe WikiCup probably has a bigger influence on the nomination rate than the double QPQs. For WikiCup participants, it is also in their own interest to help clearing the backlog (the backlog makes it hard to predict when noms will actually appear and be eligible for points). —Kusma (talk)\n\nAlso, do we have any stats on whether the deficit is being impacted by fewer rejected nominations than in the old days when reviewers were more crotchety?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nNot borne out by the data. The average DYK nominated in 2012 had a 92% chance of passing. For 2023, that number is 91%. If there's a trendline, it's a weak one, and we've been trending downward since 2018 (trending up before then). And even then, the only time this contributes to the backlog is when a nominator needs to provide a QPQ and does not, while in the meantime a full review is done on the article, generating a QPQ credit. That's a small fraction of the small fraction. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nSomeone should propose lowering the waiver in a vote format to formalize the discussion. I would support 1, 2 or 3.-— Preceding unsigned comment added by TonyTheTiger (talk • contribs)\n\nGiven that review quality currently isn't great (for me, this is the main reason DYK admin work is so stressful: so many problems are detected only at the prep to queue stage when they are a pain to fix), any such discussion would need to show how such a move will improve the situation at DYK overall. Piling more work on the admins (many of whom are already burned out or on strike) is not an option at least until somebody manages to fix RfA. —Kusma (talk)\n\nTemplate:Did you know nominations/Sean Jackson (basketball) has been waiting to figure out how to time this Princeton basketballer with a Postseason Princeton game.

Now, back to the question I actually asked: is there a way of finding out, or could a means of finding out be put in place, to find out how many QPQs a nominator has already done, in total. Put it another way: if—for example—someone has (or claims to have done) more QPQs than DYK noms, how could that be ascertained? ——Serial Number 54129\n\nCan't, unfortunately. No automatic way to tell which comments on a DYK nom are full, qualifying reviews and which aren't. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nThat is true, the tool has some limitations and does not capture all of the qpqs. Also, maybe not related to this but sometimes I use the \"what links here\" from the side menu to see if a qpq has been used. Lightburst (talk)\n\nPinging @DYK admins: all the queues are empty, and the preps are basically full. Please promote a queue or two (or more!) if you can. Thank you very much!\n\nWe also have a backup on the Approved page that the prep promoters can't do anything about until some preps open up; at the moment, there are 42 approved nominations that aren't transcluding. This is good news, in a way: it means that the review backlog reduction currently in process is working, though it has more work to do. BlueMoonset (talk)\n\nPulled Sophie Richardson due to a notability tag and posted at her nom; I have not replaced it, would not object to any other editor doing so. Additionally, there's one paragraph in Cobb Power Station (nom) which is uncited (pinging @Marshelec, Dahn, and PrimalMustelid:).--Launchballer\n\nThe only uncited paragraph seems to be the lead paragraph, which is actually not supposed to carry citations (as a general rule). Dahn (talk)\n\nThat was added after I moaned. I have no further complaints other than 'Sean Jackson could be moved to replace it', see below.--Launchballer\n\nI am not clear what the problem is with citations for Cobb Power Station. Can you clarify please and I will try to address promptly. Thanks Marshelec (talk)\n\nAlready addressed, but thank you. (I missed \"with this set\" after \"complaints\" and should have put \"Sophie Richardson\" instead of \"it\".)--Launchballer\n\nThe Sean Jackson (basketball) hook date request for that set a couple of threads up would fit in her place well as a BLP for BLP swap.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nIt would put basketball in the same set as American football however.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI wish I'd seen that, I'd have moved it.--Launchballer\n\nNot really a big issue. As User:Bagumba noted above not as date-relevant for the date request as we would like. It is more that months ago with the WP:CBBALL regs asked me to create the article as part of the annual POY focus, I said, if Princeton was looking like they might do something during March Madness, I might try to create his page and do a date request. I have about 10 or 12 basketball nominations working their way through DYK right now and it might even be unfair to give this guy a March Madness date priority and none of the other ones. The Sean Jackson (basketball) rabbithole was a fun research endeavor that led to 4 DYK and GANs. I 5xed his former teammate Dave Jamerson then created Gary Bossert and Todd Leslie as related subjects that needed articles.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nLooking for a new article to author? Tiber Valley has more than 50 redlinks. (447 B (71 words)) You're welcome. --evrik (talk)\n\nSerena of Rome is eligible for a DYK, but I feel it could be made better. Anyone want to take a crack at making it better? I'll share author credit. --evrik (talk)\n\nHey, Launchballer, I don't understand this hook change? (Was on vacation when it was changed so didn't see it go by). I felt like that's part of what made it hooky. Are you objecting because of time zones?\n\nAlso it was changed to a non-US date format; if it needed to be changed, why that format? I don't think it's worth taking to ERRORS, but it's a bit weird to have such a clearly US hook use a non-US date format. Valereee (talk)\n\nNo, I'm objecting because of the phrase \"on this date\" when \"this date\" will change and readers will already have the information that today is 21 March. The date format is a fair cop though, and I would not object to it being changed. I might have flashed my biases with that edit, as I'm English, write predominantly about English people, and loathe the mdy date format with a burning passion (there should not be two numbers next to each other). I suspect that's not really relevant to DYK though.--Launchballer\n\nMeh on the date changing, I get the objection but I'd have liked to discuss, and if you'd pinged me in the edit summary I likely would have seen it. (I don't know why more people who clerk preps don't at minimum ping the nominator in their edit summaries. I routinely open a section here and ping nom, reviewer, and promoter when I make any but the most obviously-needed changes in prep or queue.)\n\nLike you I dislike the US date format, which makes no sense to me even though I'm in the US, but as you say it's policy to use the appropriate date format. Valereee (talk)\n\nTemplate:Did you know nominations/Anna Filosofova\n\n... that after a nihilist criticized her for dressing \"like a doll\" at an important meeting, pioneering Russian feminist Anna Filosofova (pictured) replied that \"clothes do not make the woman\"?\n\nGanesha811, I always kind of hate to see a link before the target article link (unless they're needed for some reason) because they typically distract from the target article. Is it important that this was a nihilist making this comment? How would you feel about:\n\n... that after being criticized for dressing \"like a doll\" at an important meeting, pioneering Russian feminist Anna Filosofova (pictured) replied that \"clothes do not make the woman\"?\n\nValereee (talk)\n\nI don't mind the switch; while the nihilist article is both interesting and good, I agree that it might take away focus on the main article. Good suggestion! —Ganesha811 (talk)\n\n@TonyTheTiger, Sims2aholic8, and AirshipJungleman29: In this hook (Prep 2), I have replaced \"the affliction\" with \"a crisis\", which is more precise as regards the event being referred to. I'm also a bit hesitant at referring to sickle cell anemia as an \"affliction\" (it's a bit informal and has a hint of WP:ELEVAR). The replacement wording doesn't have quite the same nuance, but I've added a link which will help readers understand the context. If this isn't regarded as an improvement, I'm happy to revert. — RAVENPVFF · talk ·\n\nWill the reader understand it is a sickle cell crisis?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger: The link to Sickle cell crisis will be useful; I don't think this is deceptive. Otherwise we can always write it out as \"nearly died of a sickle cell crisis\", depending if you feel this would be excessive repetition. — RAVENPVFF · talk ·\n\nPiping would be fine, I guess.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nPrep 2:\n\n...that the only NBA player with sickle cell disease (pictured) nearly died of a crisis while on a flight to a game?\n\n@TonyTheTiger, Sims2aholic8, AirshipJungleman29, and Ravenpuff:\n\nthat the only NBA player with sickle cell disease: The source says \"As the only known person to have played in the NBA with sickle cell disease\".[6] \"known\" or similar is missing from the hook (and article). It's also unsourced that he remains the \"only NBA player\" still. The source was from 2019.\n\nnearly died of a crisis while on a flight to a game: The source says \"After last January’s near-death experience in a Newark, N.J., hospital, where DePaul trainers took Billy Jr. as soon as the team landed, the Garretts never again will underestimate the affliction.\"[7] It seems the flight perhaps spurred the episode.[8] It's unsourced for the hook and article to say it was during the flight.\n\nThe hook seems to misleadingly imply that the flight was during his NBA career, while it was years earlier in college.\n\n—Bagumba (talk)\n\nRegarding points 1 and 2, I am open to rephrasing, feel free to add known before the word NBA. Also feel free to change only to first. Feel free to change while on a flight to from a flight. Regarding the final point, hooks are often a bit of a WP:EGG. You could add the word once to handle the EGG issue.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@Bagumba:\n\nFormer: * ... that the only NBA player with sickle cell disease (pictured) nearly died of a crisis while on a flight to a game?\n\nModified: * ... that the first known NBA player with sickle cell disease (pictured) once nearly died of a crisis from a flight to a game?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nModified2: * ... that the first known NBA player with sickle cell disease (pictured) once nearly died of a crisis after a flight to a game?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI though we were going to spell out sickle cell crisis, re discussion with User:Ravenpuff.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nAh, I interpreted piping would be fine to mean that we would pipe \"crisis\" to \"sickle cell crisis\". But I'm fine with spelling it out — RAVENPVFF · talk ·\n\nI am fine with whichever way seems best to others.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger@Ravenpuff: Perhaps just replace \"sickle cell crisis\" with episode, defined as a finite period in which someone is affected by a specified illness. Avoids having to repeat \"sickle cell\". —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI am just happy to see that this guy is going to be pictured on the main page. This is small potatoes. Either way is fine.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger, Sims2aholic8, AirshipJungleman29, Ravenpuff, and Bagumba: can someone comment on the proposed responsorial modifications.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\n@TonyTheTiger: The article first needs updating regarding \"first known\" and timing of crisis relative to the flight. Hooks must reflect actual cited content of the article. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nUser:Bagumba, I have rephrased with both inflight and post flight elements of the situation.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nUpdated the prep area to your modified2 version.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nA quick look at Template talk:Did you know/Approved shows that little is being done to enforce the WP:QPQ backlog mode. Shouldn't either the DYK admins or the DYK promoters be doing some sort of double check? I don't think I should have to do double QPQs if almost no one else does. I have a triple nom that I have to nominate by EOD on the 18th.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nIt looks like the current method of operation for this is simply to not have any information at all on the nomination template or in the unreviewed nominations page about \"backlog mode\" at all, and then surprising random nominations with a demand for double (or quadruple!) reviews out of nowhere. That is actively poor judgement on the part of those that feel backlog mode should be a thing. If its to be enforced it needs a call out and explicit instructions as to what is expected out of all participants before its enforced. As it stands I don't feel it can be enforced.--Kevmin §\n\nWhy don't you go through that list and post at the nompages of those owing? (Someone should really edit MediaWiki:DYK-nomination-wizard.js and User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js to state that we're in backlog mode though.)--Launchballer\n\nPlease state what you are meaning with that statement? (Rather making an obtuse remark that did not address the issue of nominators not having any notice an obscure process that was never invoked before has been \"activated\" forcing extra work onto the group of people least responsible for the situation). To be clear this process actively penalizes the group of participants that are least resposible for the backlog situation existing in the first place, as the group being told to do more are already doing a 1-1 while \"new\" people get to do a 4-0 before even taking any part in providing any balance. Before you say I'm part of the process I actively review noms before I even need them, so I am more often reducing the backlog then I adding a nom at 1to1 balance.--Kevmin §\n\nI'll make an edit for notification today, this should've been an obvious part of procedure. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nAnd I had directed my 'obtuse remark' at TonyTheTiger...--Launchballer\n\nupdate: done :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nFTR, the wizards have now been updated to indicate the count of QPQs required. – SD0001 (talk)\n\n@Theleekycauldron and SD0001: Template:Did you know/Backlog mode? was updated at 23:41, 16 March 2024. Will it be possible to run reports on how many nominations are made in backlog mode and how many of those require a second QPQ? I can see 20 nominations automatically tagged as requiring an additional QPQ on the approved and unapproved lists. TSventon (talk)\n\n@TSventon: there will this time through a simple search, but next time will be more of a challenge. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nIs it really that hard to do multiple QPQs in good faith? I don't get the whole \"I don't think I should have to do x if almost no one else does it.\" This is the second time I've seen this attitude expressed here. You're doing it to help out, not for some kind of accumulated merit or future reward. Viriditas (talk)\n\nHmmm, Viriditas given the commentary that is regularly posted from the prep-builders and queue builders about the amount of work they do on each set, that actually should be a rather obvious answer. Yes, doing reviews (especially of topics one is not familiar with) is hard, and actively dumping on people that are regularly writing article for the encyclopedia as part of that process is the best way to kill DYK.--Kevmin §\n\nCheck your attitude at the door. Look at all your replies here. You just accused Launchballer, who made a reply in good faith of making an \"obtuse remark\", and you accused me of \"actively dumping on people\". If you're worried about \"killing DYK\", keep it up. Viriditas (talk)\n\nAttitude is not the same as noting that the backlog process has inherent flaws.--Kevmin §\n\nThis is classic black and white thinking. How about instead of incessantly complaining and making accusations you propose am immediate, actionable solution to the problem without involving personal attacks? Viriditas (talk)\n\nIf a nomination does not have the requisite QPQs, it will not be promoted. If you find any at WP:DYKNA that do not meet the requirements, I would suggest making a note on the respective nominations, as you are fully equipped to do per WP:BOLD. That seems a better use of time than coming to complain here and asking that others do that work. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk)\n\nIf the nominators didn't know the process even existed or was active, that is directly the fault of the group admins that chose to enact the process. Nominators are not psychic, there's no information anywhere except on this talk page in one section about activating it, and no information about what activation actually would explicitly mean for the nominators, etc. How specifically is a nomination supposed to comply with invisible rules that no one tells them about. This is not the nominators fault.--Kevmin §\n\nI just looks and the actual thread regarding activation of the backlog mode has already been archived, so its not present on this page anymore to refer to. What other main page projects have a \"free pass\" structure like we do here? It feels that the better solution for excessive backlogs (Which only EEng ever though was a problem) would be to reduce or remove the amount of freebies given. The rules for nomination and for qpq are linked in multiple places though the nom process.--Kevmin §\n\nThis is precisely why I will be ignoring User:Launchballer's frankly fucking patronising \"not so fast\" message at my nomimation. As pointed out above, if you change the rules, fine. But the onus is then on those who made that choice to inform editors in advance. Change must be promulgated. A page notice in the edit box suggests itself. But imposing conditions post facto is not conducive to either good faith or collegiality. Cheers, ——Serial Number 54129\n\nThat's fine, but it does make you look selfish, petty, and focused more on rules (authoritarian even) rather than helping the site function. Never knew there were so many selfish people on this site, so thanks for clearing this up. It's enlightening. Viriditas (talk)\n\nIn fact, it makes me look none of those things (and mindful of aspersions, please); after all, you've got a backlog. That means you already bear enough weight upon those narrow shoulders. In the meantime, I repeat: why not a edit box notice informing nominators of the change? It would be a piece of cake to have a notice that can be commented out whenever there is no backlog, and restored when there is. Link it to WP:DYKRI, which naturally experienced folk don't have to expect to reread everyone to find out if there's a backlog. Bob's your uncle. ——Serial Number 54129\n\nI would like to add the following notice to the top of WP:DYKCNN, WP:DYKN and WP:DYKCRIT. The notice can be removed when DYK is no longer in a backlog.\n\nThoughts and suggestions are welcome. Z1720 (talk)\n\nyeah, let's do it. For future implementation, let's do it in a way where we can leave the template up and toggle them all visible and invisible.\n\nAlso, I do hope no one has made the mistake of requiring double QPQs ex post facto the nomination. Backlog mode only applies to nominations created after it is activated. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nTo quote Gustavo Fring: Do. It. RoySmith (talk)\n\nGood idea, except that \"click here\" should probably link to Wikipedia talk:Did you know#Backlog at WP:DYKN instead, and that someone should probably annotate User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js also.--Launchballer\n\nLinked to Wikipedia talk:Did you know#Backlog at WP:DYKN, though that might have to be updated when the conversation is archived. I do not know how to edit code so @SD0001:. Z1720 (talk)\n\nI'm surprised this wasn't done sooner. I wouldn't have even known that backlog mode was already activated if I didn't see it being brought up in the new nominations since the discussion that activated it went rather quickly. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nI have placed the proposed notice at the top of WP:DYKN, replacing the backlog template that has been in place since who-knows-when. If there are other suggestions on where to put it, please respond below. Z172"
