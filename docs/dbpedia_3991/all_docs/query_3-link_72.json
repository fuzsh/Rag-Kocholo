Unlike previous installments, the game takes place in Sarasaland rather than the Mushroom Kingdom, and introduces Princess Daisy, a new character serving as the damsel-in-distress in place of Princess Peach. Tatanga, a malevolent alien with powers of hypnosis, serves as both the main antagonist and final boss. Unlike previous games, Super Mario Land was not developed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo's EAD division, but by Nintendo R&D1, with Gunpei Yokoi as guiding producer.\n\nIn addition to being the first of the three Super Mario Land games, this game is also the shortest, comprising of only twelve levels spanning four different worlds. It was succeeded by Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, which introduced Wario, and Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, which is also the first installment in the Wario Land series. Super Mario Land and its sequel were originally excluded from the main Super Mario series,[6] but were later included alongside the more traditional games in material for the Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary[7] and Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary, as well as the history pages on the Mario Portal and \"The official home for Mario\" websites.[8][9]\n\nThis game is notable for its inclusion of different or unrelated enemies and sound effects compared to traditional titles. Additionally, though the game did not receive critical acclaim, mainly due to its graphical capabilities and shortness in length, it sold extremely well, eventually totaling over 18 million copies sold, making it the fourth best-selling game for the Game Boy overall.\n\nThe game was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console in 2011, and for Game Boy - Nintendo Switch Online for the Nintendo Switch in 2024 in celebration of the Game Boy's 35th anniversary.[2] The Virtual Console release requires 42 blocks (5.3 MB) of memory to be installed.\n\nA board game adaptation of this game was released exclusively in Germany, titled Das Super Mario Spiel. Although the board game does not explicitly state its theming after Super Mario Land, it features the same characters, worlds, and story.\n\nStory[edit]\n\nThe following text is taken directly from the instruction booklet.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a peaceful world called Sarasaland. In this world there were 4 kingdoms named Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai. One day, the skies of Sarasaland were suddenly covered by a huge black cloud. From a crack in this cloud, the unknown space monster Tatanga emerged to try to conquer Sarasaland. Tatanga hypnotized the people of all the kingdoms so that he could control them in any way he liked. In this way he took over Sarasaland. Now, he wants to marry Princess Daisy of Sarasaland and make her his queen. Mario came to know of these events, and he has started on a journey to the Chai Kingdom where Princess Daisy is held captive, in order to restore peace to Sarasaland. Can Mario defeat Tatanga, release people from his interstellar hypnosis, and rescue Princess Daisy? It's all up to you and Mario's skill. Go for it Mario!\n\nIn this game, Mario is tasked with saving Princess Daisy and the inhabitants of Sarasaland from Tatanga. To do so, he must travel across and conquer all four kingdoms - the Birabuto Kingdom, a desert kingdom based on ancient Egypt, the Muda Kingdom, an aquatic kingdom, the Easton Kingdom, a kingdom partially based on Easter Island, and the Chai Kingdom, a kingdom inspired by mythical ancient China.\n\nThe first three kingdoms are each guarded by a boss Mario must defeat to rescue an enemy disguised as Princess Daisy. These three kingdoms are led by the Gao-like King Totomesu, Yurarin Boo-like Dragonzamasu, and Tokotoko-like Hiyoihoi. A cloud known as Biokinton is fought in the fourth kingdom. In the end, Mario must board the Sky Pop to battle and defeat Tatanga himself in his heavily armed airship, Pagosu. After he is defeated, Mario rescues Daisy and the two ride off together in a spaceship.\n\nIt is revealed in the sequel, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, that Wario took advantage of the events in this game to take over Mario's castle. In this game, Tatanga guards a Golden Coin, presumably working under Wario.\n\nGameplay[edit]\n\nSuper Mario Land is very similar to previous Super Mario platformer games. allows the player to jump, while serves as the action command, allowing Mario to run faster. controls where Mario walks or runs. The player may also pause at anytime with . Jumping on an enemy usually defeats it and earns the player points. When Mario is Superball Mario, or if he is driving the Marine Pop or Sky Pop, fires out projectiles at Mario's enemies.\n\nMost of the bosses can either be beaten via physical attack, or by jumping on a switch behind the boss. Collecting one hundred coins earns Mario an extra life, and if he manages to earn 100,000 points, he gains an extra continue to use in the event all lives are lost.\n\nMario is vulnerable as Small Mario. When he gets a Super Mushroom, he grows slightly in size and is able to take damage once without losing a life, instead reverting back to his small state. If Mario collects a Superball Flower, he becomes Superball Mario, and is able to shoot Superballs at his enemies. If Mario happens to find and collect a Star, he becomes invincible, and is able to defeat any enemy just by touching it. These effects are temporary and last a short time.\n\nAt the end of every non-boss level, the player reaches a goal tower with two entrances. The lower entrance takes Mario directly to the next stage, while the upper entrance sends him to a bonus game for the chance to win a Superball Flower or one, two, or three extra lives.\n\nAfter the main game is beaten, the Mushroom icon on the title screen changes to an icon of Mario's head. This allows the player to play through the game once more, with additional enemies spread throughout the levels, though no further changes occur to increase the difficulty. Beating this game unlocks a level select option. As the game has no battery backup, the title screen reverts to the standard version upon switching the Game Boy off, resetting the game, or having the batteries run out.\n\nControls[edit]\n\nAction(s) Input(s) Game Boy Nintendo 3DS Dual Joy-Con / Nintendo Switch Pro Controller / Nintendo Switch Lite Horizontal Joy-Con Move / / Run, throw Superball, fire torpedo, fire missile / / Jump Pause +\n\nWorlds and levels[edit]\n\nSuper Mario Land utilizes Sarasaland as the main setting rather than the Mushroom Kingdom. The land is divided into four kingdoms serving as the corresponding worlds of the game - the Birabuto Kingdom, the Muda Kingdom, the Easton Kingdom, and the Chai Kingdom, respectively. Each world consists of three levels. These levels normally feature music, backgrounds, and enemies relevant to the themes of their respective worlds. Due to the length of the game, as well as the amount of enemies featured in the game, most enemies are indigenous to one world, while some only appear in one level. At the end of the first two levels of each world, Mario reaches a goal allowing him to advance to the next level immediately, or complete a bonus game for an item beforehand. At the end of the third and final level of each world, Mario fights and defeats a boss to rescue an enemy disguised as Daisy, with the exception of the Chai Kingdom, where he must defeat two bosses, including Tatanga, to rescue the real Daisy.\n\nKingdoms Birabuto Kingdom Areas World 1-1 World 1-2 World 1-3 The first world in the game – a desert kingdom based on ancient Egypt. Pyramids occur in the background of the first two areas, while the third one takes place within one. This world introduces a number of recurring enemies such as Goombos, Bombshell Koopas, and Piranha Plants. King Totomesu, a large Gao, is fought at the end of the third area. Defeating him leads to a Fly disguised as Princess Daisy. Muda Kingdom Areas World 2-1 World 2-2 World 2-3 Muda Kingdom is a water-themed world. Its name is invocative of Bermuda and the mythical Mu. Muda is the only kingdom to feature the Marine Pop submarine. The first two areas are beaches, while the third is entirely underwater. Most of the local enemies are based off of seahorses, carnivorous fish, and other marine animals. Dragonzamasu, a large Yurarin Boo, is fought at the end of the third area. The Daisy found here is a Gunion in disguise. Easton Kingdom Areas World 3-1 World 3-2 World 3-3 This world is invocative of Easter Island. Large moai occur in the background, and a few of the local enemies resemble the statues. Hiyoihoi, a large Tokotoko who attacks by hurling Ganchan, is fought at the end of the final area. The Daisy lookalike here is a Kumo. Chai Kingdom Areas World 4-1 World 4-2 World 4-3 The final world – a land based on China. The first area is a dense bamboo forest. The third one takes place above the clouds, and is the only one to include the Sky Pop. A few of the local enemies seem to be derived from Chinese folklore, while others are affiliates of the local bosses and only occur in the sky. In addition to the cloud boss Biokinton, the final boss Tatanga occurs in the third area. Defeating him rescues the true Princess Daisy.\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nImage Name Description Mario The game's protagonist and the only playable character. Mario ventures to Sarasaland to rescue Daisy from the space alien Tatanga. Princess Daisy The ruler of Sarasaland, who was kidnapped by Tatanga with the intent to marry her.[10] Defeating a boss leads to a minion disguised as Daisy: the real princess is only rescued when the alien himself is defeated.\n\nEnemies and obstacles[edit]\n\nEnemies[edit]\n\nThere are ~25 enemies in Super Mario Land, most of which appear within only one kingdom. These enemies are of designs culturally tied to their native kingdoms and are wholly new to the Super Mario series. Examples include Gao, which resembles an Egyptian sphinx, and Pionpi, which resembles the jiangshi of Chinese folklore. Only two enemies previously appeared in the franchise: Piranha Plants from Super Mario Bros. and Fighterflies from the Mario Bros. arcade game. The latter are simply called \"Flies\" in this game. Like the console Super Mario games, defeating an enemy awards Mario with a certain number of points. The amount of points is dependent on the type of enemy and the means of attack, like Super Mario Bros. and The Lost Levels.\n\nWhen localized for English-speaking territories in 1989, most enemies were given names that were loose romanizations of their Japanese ones. This included the returning Piranha Plants, which are referred to as \"Pakkun Flowers\" in the instruction booklet for Super Mario Land. The only major exception are Kumos, whose English name derives from a Japanese word for spiders (蜘蛛, kumo) but go by a more distinct name in the original Japanese release of the game. When rereleased in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, the accompanying eGuide introduced new English names for the enemies that are related to more recurring species in the Super Mario series. Namely: Chibibo were renamed Goombos; Nokobon were renamed Bombshell Koopas; Pakkun Flowers were clarified to be Piranha Plants; and Gira were renamed Bullet Biffs. These are the names acknowledged below. With the exception of the Piranha Plants, none of these names were incorporated into the Mario Portal Game Archive for Super Mario Land in 2022, which instead uses the names from the original 1989 instruction booklet.\n\nEnemies are generally listed in the order they are encountered in-game. They are otherwise clustered near their most immediate relatives.\n\nImage Name Description Levels Pts. New First Last Goombo The Goomba relatives of Sarasaland.

Mario's Superball form looks the same as his Super form.\n\nStar\n\nInvincible Mario Stars are rare items granting Mario brief invincibility from enemies. Rather than the usual invincibility theme, two loops of an excerpt from the famous \"Galop infernal\" from Orpheus in the Underworld by Jacques Offenbach, a tune most commonly associated with the can-can, play while Mario is invincible.\n\nObjects[edit]\n\nObjects are interactable elements of the environment that cannot be picked up or collected.\n\nImage Name Description Brick Blocks that break when struck.

Pipe Mario can enter most pipes to reach hidden or secret areas, as well as exit them. Switch Switches found in most boss rooms. Touching one defeats the resident boss. The switches provide an alternative way to defeat bosses without directly attacking them.\n\nRevision[edit]\n\nWhen playing Super Mario Land on a Game Boy Color, the game will display colors using a unique hardware-coded color palette.\n\nLater printings of the game featured alterations to the soundtrack[11] and fixed the screen wraparound glitch of the original release.[11]\n\nDevelopment[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Super Mario Land staff\n\nSuper Mario Land was initially set to be the pack-in game for the Game Boy. However, Henk Rogers of Bullet-Proof Software managed to convince NOA president Minoru Arakawa that Tetris would have wider appeal.[12]\n\nThe game was developed by Nintendo R&D 1 rather than by Nintendo EAD, making it the first Super Mario platformer to not be developed by EAD. Gunpei Yokoi acted as the producer and future R&D manager Satoru Okada was the director. Hirokazu Tanaka handled the sound effects and soundtrack.\n\nNintendo eShop description[edit]\n\nNorth American version\n\nAncient ruins, giant crabs, Koopa Troopas, flying stone heads, and hungry sharks await you in this rerelease of the 1989 Game Boy™ game. In the beautiful kingdom of Sarasaland, a mysterious alien has appeared and hypnotized the inhabitants while kidnapping Princess Daisy™ for himself! Travel over land, in the air, and underwater as Mario™ runs, jumps, and bounces his way to fortune and glory on his mission to save Princess Daisy and restore peace! Ancient ruins, tempestuous waters, and brand new challenges await!\n\nEuropean version\n\nMario’s acclaimed Game Boy debut brings the plucky plumber to new territory: Sarasaland, where the evil space monster Tatanga has hypnotised the people and kidnapped Princess Daisy!\n\nWhile the gameplay will be at first familiar, with the winning blend of platforming and power-ups, Super Mario Land is unique for introducing vehicles for Mario to ride: the Sky Pop aeroplane and Marine Pop submarine.\n\nYou'll need all your skills on land, in the sea and through the air, to traverse the four diverse kingdoms of Sarasaland in your quest to defeat the dastardly Tatanga and rescue Daisy.\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\n\nSuper Mario Land was the first Super Mario title to support stereo sound, a native feature of the Game Boy via the included 3.5mm headphone jack (previous Nintendo hardware exclusively outputted mono sound). To fit in with this, the game's music features heavy use of both the left and right channels in addition to the center of the soundstage. The Revision 1 reissue would remix the game's soundtrack to adjust the use of stereo sound, centering the percussion in the Marine Pop/Sky Pop theme and moving the first percussion hit in the Sarasaland, cave, and credits themes from the center to the right channel.[13]\n\nTo tie in with the game's Japanese release, an original soundtrack for the game was published in that region by Nippon Columbia, featuring arrangements of ten of Tanaka's compositions by Ikuro Fugiwara, and performed by the \"Mario Freaks Orchestra.\"\n\nGame Boy[edit]\n\nMain article: Game Boy (comic)\n\nSuper Mario Land was the focus of Game Boy, a 4-issues miniseries published by Valiant Comics as part of its Nintendo Comics System brand. The series had Tatanga and his minions invade the Real World after being summoned by disgrunted electronic store worker Herman Smirch, while Mario fought to foil their efforts.\n\nReception[edit]\n\nSuper Mario Land received mostly positive reviews. The difficulty, the length of the game, the price, and the overall gameplay experience were among the most discussed aspects of the game. The game has received a 77.94% based on 8 reviews.[14]\n\nCorbie Dillard of Nintendo Life noted the successors of the game as superior in both length and quality, praising the sequel, Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins, as the better game, despite the price. However, he recommended playing the game in commemoration of Mario's first portable experience. Adam Riley of Cubed3 scored the game well, also acknowledging the standards achieved by later games, while also recommending the game as a short and sweet adventure.\n\nAdditionally, Lucas M. Thomas of IGN, noted the differences between the game and standard titles as odd, focusing on the graphical and other visual capabilities. Nevertheless, he gave the game a good 7.5/10 rating, calling it a \"small, singular oddball\", though worth the small purchase.[15]\n\nRyan Lambie of Den of Geek reviewed the game on a much more positive note, referring to it as both an \"underrated classic\" and \"weird but deeply lovable handheld classic\", complimenting the difficulty, music, and simplified graphics, among various other aspects of the game.[16]\n\nOn GameSpot, the game received an average rating of 8.1 out of over 2,000 reviews, with almost half of the ratings being 8/10.[17] The more positive reviews praised the simple though memorable elements of gameplay. The neutral or mixed reviews noted the short length of the game and the graphical capabilities, while acknowledging some of the aforementioned positive traits the game had to offer. Various negative or critical reviews heavily or harshly criticized the graphics and length in addition to other aspects such as the controls and inexplicable differences from main games in the series.\n\nReviews Release Reviewer, Publication Score Comment Game Boy Lucas M. Thomas, IGN 7.5/10 \"With history as it is, though, Super Mario Land simply stands alone in time as a small, singular oddball. Its weirdest elements and tiny sense of scale would be brushed aside as Mario moved on, as titles like the sequel Super Mario Land 2 pushed the camera closer and began bringing back more traditional power-ups like the common Fire Flower (instead of the rubber bouncy ball version). If you'd like to experience this moment when Mario first toyed with the idea of becoming a full-time pilot or submarine commander, though, there's no better time than now -- at a price of just $3.99 in the newly-launched 3DS eShop, tickets to visit this small, weird Land are definitely affordable.\" Nintendo 3DS Corbie Dillard, Nintendo Life 7/10 \"Super Mario Land was impressive when it was first released for the Game Boy, but given how the length and overall quality of Game Boy releases increased shortly thereafter, it only made this original seem even more inadequate by comparison. It's not the best launching-off point for the 3DS eShop — Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins is by far the better game — and it is the most expensive of the launch Virtual Console titles at $3.99/£3.60. It's still a very fun Super Mario experience, but just about the time things are really getting good, the experience ends and the credits roll. If you haven't played Super Mario Land before, you owe it to yourself to at least give the game a try. The quest might be fairly short, but it's still worth playing through at least once, if only to see where Mario's portable adventures began.\" Nintendo 3DS Adam Riley, Cubed3 8/10 \"Despite not particularly ageing too well, looking graphically rather shabby and not offering a considerable amount of challenge or any replay value, at its heart Super Mario Land is still a fantastic piece of history in the platform genre, and a thoroughly enjoyable romp for Super Mario fans in general.\" Aggregators Compiler Platform / Score GameRankings 77.94%\n\nSales[edit]\n\nThe game sold very well. It became the fourth best-selling Game Boy game, with over 18 million copies sold.[18] Additionally, it is currently the tenth Super Mario game with the most sales overall, as well as the sixth best-selling portable Super Mario game, being surpassed by New Super Mario Bros. and Mario Kart DS, both for the Nintendo DS, and Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS, as well as Super Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, both for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nPre-release and unused content[edit]\n\nThe theme that played when climbing ladders lasted much longer, over five seconds longer than necessary.\n\nA tile reserved for a Hidden Block existed in 3-3, though was ultimately unused, rendering it futile.\n\nVarious jingles, including the death and goal themes, originally had less detailed audio, with no background tracks.\n\nSeveral enemies and platforms were misplaced in certain levels, indicating developmental oversight. For instance, a Bombshell Koopa is placed right above a pit in 3-2, and can only be spotted if quick enough.\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nFor this subject's image gallery, see Gallery:Super Mario Land.\n\nArtwork[edit]\n\nMario in the Sky Pop\n\nSprites[edit]\n\nIn-game logo\n\nMedia[edit]\n\nFor a complete list of media for this subject, see List of Super Mario Land media.\n\nHelp:Media • Having trouble playing?\n\nGlitches[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Super Mario Land glitches\n\nGanchan Coin glitch[edit]\n\nDuring the battle against Hiyoihoi, Mario must be on the left edge of the boss's platform.
