The difficulty seems to be a poor connection to Google. That problem will be resolved, but, for the time being, I get logged out and cannot put likes to the posts I read.\n\nAs you know, I am also writing a book on Molière which is a relatively easy but time-consuming and expensive endeavour. The books, if they are available, often cost a fortune. Moreover, given health limitations, I should hire an assistant, a person who would borrow books for me and return them to the university. He or she would work no more than three or four hours every second week. I also need photocopies of certain articles.\n\nAn any rate, I’m still here, but technologies are playing tricks on me. It will be resolved.\n\nI am reposting: Marie: the Words to a Love Song (Guillaume Apollinaire/ Léo Ferré)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nMarie: the Words to a Love Song (29 June 2015)\n\nSources & Resources\n\nglbtqarchive.com/arts/Marie Laurencin\n\nLove to everyone ♥\n\nJacques Offenbach « Barcarola »\n\n© Micheline Walker\n\n13 July 2016\n\nWordPress\n\nThe Fox & the Crane, or Stork\n\nPosted by in Art, Beast Literature, Fables, Illustrations\n\n≈ 10 Comments\n\nTags\n\nArt Nouveau, farce, illustrations, Jacques Offenbach, Lex Talionis, limerick, Perry Index 426, the Golden Rule, trompeur trompé, Walter Crane\n\nThe Fox and the Crane, by Walter Crane (1845–1915)\n\nPhoto credit: Gutenberg [eBook #25433]), p. 19\n\nPerry Index 426\n\nAarne-Thompson Classification Systems 60 (now ATU [Uther])\n\nYou have heard how Sir Fox treated Crane:\n\nWith soup in a plate.

Walter Crane (1845–1915) created illustrations for Baby’s Own Æsop (1887), Æsop‘s Fables adapted for children. The above illustrations are examples of Art Nouveau (curves…). Famed engraver W. J. Linton (7 December 1812 – 29 December 1897) provided Walter Crane with the limericks, which does not mean he is their author. To the best of my knowledge, the limericks are anonymous. In Æsop and Jean de La Fontaine, the crane is a stork. Consequently, these are functions.\n\nAs for the text, it is a limerick version of the Æsopic fable “The Fox and the Stork” and Jean de La Fontaine’s retelling. Limericks are five-line poems and, typically, nonsensical, which is not the case with “The Fox and Crane.” The fable has simply been adapted for children. Limericks can be learned easily and then recited. Their rhyme scheme is AABBA and their meter, the tri-syllabic anapest: two short and a long. Interestingly, the shortened text is inserted in the illustration, suggesting the growing importance of illustrations. Therefore, the limericks have a dual purpose. They suit children and allow for large illustrations.\n\n“The Fox and the Stork,” by Æsop\n\nIn Æsop’s fable, the crane (la grue) is a stork (la cigogne) and the limerick, a genuine fable. It is number 426 in the Perry Index and type 60 and AT type 60. The following is V. S. Vernon Jones’ translation of Æsop’s “The Fox and Stork.” [eBook #11339]\n\nA Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.\n\nPreface, by illustrator Walter Crane\n\nPhoto credit: Gutenberg [eBook #25433]\n\nLa Fontaine’s “Le Renard et la Cigogne”\n\n« Le Renard et la Cigogne » (I.18)\n\n“The Fox and the Stork” (I.18)\n\nOld Mister Fox was at expense, one day,\n\nTo dine old Mistress Stork.\n\nThe fare was light, was nothing, sooth to say,\n\nRequiring knife and fork.\n\nThat sly old gentleman, the dinner-giver,\n\nWas, you must understand, a frugal liver.\n\nThis once, at least, the total matter\n\nWas thinnish soup served on a platter,\n\nFor madam’s slender beak a fruitless puzzle,\n\nTill all had passed the fox’s lapping muzzle.\n\nBut, little relishing his laughter,\n\nOld gossip Stork, some few days after,\n\nReturned his Foxship’s invitation.\n\nWithout a moment’s hesitation,\n\nHe said he’d go, for he must own he\n\nNever stood with friends for ceremony.\n\nAnd so, precisely at the hour,\n\nHe hied him to the lady’s bower;\n\nWhere, praising her politeness,\n\nHe finds her dinner right nice.\n\nIts punctuality and plenty,\n\nIts viands, cut in mouthfuls dainty,\n\nIts fragrant smell, were powerful to excite,\n\nHad there been need, his foxish appetite.\n\nBut now the dame, to torture him,\n\nSuch wit was in her,\n\nServed up her dinner\n\nIn vases made so tall and slim,\n\nThey let their owner’s beak pass in and out,\n\nBut not, by any means, the fox’s snout!\n\nAll arts without avail,\n\nWith drooping head and tail,\n\nAs ought a fox a fowl had cheated,\n\nThe hungry guest at last retreated.\n\nYou knaves, for you is this recital,\n\nYou’ll often meet Dame Stork’s requital.\n\nJean de La Fontaine\n\n(Photo credit: La Fontaine, ancien site officiel)\n\n(Photo credit: La Fontaine, ancien site officiel)\n\nThe Deceiver Deceived or “le trompeur trompé ”\n\nThe structure of this fable is that of the “deceiver deceived” or “trompeur trompé.” The fox, as host, serves the crane (la grue) her meal on a flat plate. So the crane, as hostess, serves the fox (le renard) his meal in an urn. Molière used this structure in shorter plays (one to three acts) known as farces, as opposed to grandes comédies (five acts). These shorter plays resemble French medieval farces and facéties as well as comedies belonging to the Italian commedia dell’arte, an improvised comic form where the characters were stock-characters or archetypes, i.e. they always played the same role in plays following the same formula, or plot, as in “Harlequin” Romances.\n\nIn short, “The Fox and the Crane” is a farce; a trick played on one character is played on the trickster. It is as though “The Fox and the Stork” were reversed into “The Stork and the Fox,” a mirror image æsthetics.\n\nThe Moral of “The Fox and the Stork”\n\nAt its simplest level, the moral of this fable is that what harm we do unto others can be done to us. The trickster may expect retaliation (lex talionis),[i] but not of a military nature. So this fable is a cautionary tale. The stork having been fooled by the fox, the fox can expect anything, and it is fooled the stork.\n\nYet, what this fable has to teach is an all-encompassing rule. It is the “do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you.” According to Wikipedia,\n\n“[t]he moral drawn is that the trickster must expect trickery in return and that the golden rule of conduct is for one to do to others what one would wish for oneself.”\n\nWikipedia emphasizes the universality of this rule (see Golden Rule). Let’s scroll down to the Sanskrit tradition.\n\n“In Mahābhārata, the ancient epic of India, comes a discourse where the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira thus, ‘Listening to wise scriptures, austerity, sacrifice, respectful faith, social welfare, forgiveness, purity of intent, compassion, truth and self-control – are the ten wealth of character (self). O King aim for these, may you be steadfast in these qualities. These are the basis of prosperity and rightful living. These are highest attainable things. All worlds are balanced on dharma, dharma encompasses ways to prosperity as well. O King, dharma is the best quality to have, wealth the medium and desire (kāma) the lowest. Hence, (keeping these in mind), by self-control and by making dharma (right conduct) your main focus, treat others as you treat yourself.’”\n\n—ooo—\n\n“In the best of all possible worlds” (Candide [Leibniz], Voltaire), would the stork or crane have tricked the trickster?\n\n_________________________\n\n[i] Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, Arthur Rackham, Sir John Tenniel, etc.\n\n[ii] “talion”.
