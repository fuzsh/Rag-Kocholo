        "text": "City in Hesse, Germany\n\nOffenbach am Main (German pronunciation: [ˈɔfn̩bax ʔam ˈmaɪn] ⓘ) is a city in Hesse, Germany, on the left bank of the river Main. It borders Frankfurt and is part of the Frankfurt urban area and the larger Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. It has a population of 138,335 (December 2018).[3]\n\nIn the 20th century, the city's economy was built on machine-building, leather-making, typography and design, and the automobile and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nSubdivision\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inner city area of Offenbach is quite large and consists of the historic center of the city and its expansions of the 1800s. Three formerly independent suburbs were incorporated in the first half of the 20th century: Bürgel being the first in 1908, then Bieber and Rumpenheim in 1938 and 1942.\n\nSouth of the inner city area are the suburbs Lauterborn, Rosenhöhe and Tempelsee. Kaiserlei is a commercial district in the far west of the city bordering Frankfurt. In the west Waldheim is a residential neighborhood on the city limits with Mühlheim am Main. In 2010 the eastern part of the city center was officially named Mathildenviertel, as the area was already unofficially called by the locals.[4]\n\nUnlike most larger cities in Germany, Offenbach was not completely divided into districts. Only the nine neighborhoods mentioned above were officially districts, leaving the largest parts of the city officially unnamed. Although specific names for neighborhoods and areas were already in use among the locals and residents.\n\nIn June 2019 the city council approved a new act that subdivides the city's area entirely into 21 districts. The nine existing districts largely remained the same, most of them were even expanded. The new districts were laid out after the already by locals commonly known neighborhoods, such as the Westend, the Nordend or Buchhügel. A completely new name was only needed to be found for one neighborhood south of the city center, which never had commonly used name before: Lindenfeld. The name derived from an old name of a land lot in this area, when it was still fields in agricultural use prior to the 1800s.[5]\n\nAs of July 2019 there are the following 21 districts:\n\nBieber\n\nBieberer Berg\n\nBuchhügel\n\nBuchrain\n\nBürgel\n\nCarl-Ulrich-Siedlung\n\nHafen\n\nKaiserlei\n\nLauterborn\n\nLindenfeld\n\nMathildenviertel\n\nMusikerviertel\n\nNordend\n\nOffenbach-Ost\n\nRosenhöhe\n\nRumpenheim\n\nSenefelderquartier\n\nTempelsee\n\nWaldheim\n\nWestend\n\nZentrum\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nOffenbach experienced a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa). The summer time was subtropical, ranging from 21 °C to about 23 °C in average. Spring time and autumn were warm-temperate, with averages between about 13 °C and 18 °C. The winter was cool-temperate, with daily means from 6 °C to 9 °C. Due to its location in the Upper Rhine Plain, the whole Rhein-Main Metropolitan Region generally experienced one of the warmest climates in Germany, making it possible to grow plants from the subtropics such as vineyards, palm trees and olive trees.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first documented reference to a suburb of Offenbach appears in 770.[6] In a document of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II dating to 977 exists the first mention of the place of Offenbach.[7] During the Middle Ages Offenbach passed through many hands. Only in 1486 could the Count Ludwig of Isenburg finally take control of city for his family, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß (Isenburg Palace), which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.\n\nIn 1635, Offenbach was given to the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt, but it was returned to the Isenburg-Birstein Count (later Prince) in 1642. It remained in that principality until 1815, when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis I. A year later it was given to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nAlways very close to the city centre of Frankfurt, Offenbach was a popular location for business. The town has its own trade fair, and many companies have opened facilities here because there are fewer restrictions and no closed businesses. French Protestants (Huguenots) came in the 17th century and settled in Offenbach and contributed to making Offenbach a prosperous city, e.g., bringing knowledge of tobacco with them and turning Offenbach into a centre for rolling cigars. The town was more cosmopolitan than Frankfurt; famous people such as Goethe and Mozart visited it several times.\n\nThe Rumpenheim Palace and its park were a popular destination for monarchs in the 19th century. The city was thereafter ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Offenbach became the center of the traditional design with figures such as the architect Hugo Eberhardt, the typographer Rudolf Koch, the bookbinder and designer Ignatz Wiemeler and Ernst Engel and the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann.\n\nDuring the Second World War a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing, which claimed 467 lives. With the new district Lauterborn the city was expanded to the south in the 1960s. On the border with Frankfurt, the office district Kaiserlei was built. Offenbach is a so-called \"Sozialer Brennpunkt\" (deprived area) because of unemployment, poverty, gang related crime and migration.[8]\n\nBefore its eradication in the Holocaust, the city had a Jewish population. Jews settled in the city as late as the late 16th century, and it is believed that out of the 871 residents of the town as of 1829, the 40 Jewish families accounted for nearly a quarter of the town's population.

In 2016, foreign nationals made up 37% of the population.[12] The largest communities are, in that order, from Turkey, Greece, Romania, Poland and Italy.[13]\n\nAs of 2019, residents with a migration background enumerated 88,608, or 63.4% of the population, while Germans without a migration background enumerated 51,241 residents.[14] Nearly one-in-three, 29.5%, of foreign residents originate from Europe, particularly from countries like Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, Croatia and Italy.[14]\n\nAccording to census data, Offenbach[15] and Duisburg had the highest share of Muslim migrants of all German districts in 2011. Muslims were between 14% and 17% of the city's population as of 2011.[15][16][17][18][19][20] Turks made up 11% of the city's population in 2019.[14]\n\nPopulation history\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil the end of the 17th century, Offenbach remained a small town with less than a thousand inhabitants. With the coming into power of the count Johann Philipp in 1685, the city began to develop and the population rose steadily. In the 19th century the city became industrialized and the population increased even tenfold.[21] Offenbach is one of the German cities where Germans without migrant background make up a minority of the population. As of 31 December 2012, approx. 44.3% of residents or 55,047 people had no foreign background. In contrast to that, there were 55.7% or 69,214 people with at least one non-German grandparent.[22] The largest of those groups are:[23]\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents by 2022 Country Population Turkey 6,179 Romania 5,631 Syria 5,416 Greece 5,180 Bulgaria 4,984 Poland 4,112 Croatia 4,052 Italy 3,919 Ukraine 3,469 Serbia 3,127 Afghanistan 2,715 Bosnia and Herzegovina 2,380 Iraq 1,807 Morocco 1,386 Spain 1,234\n\nYear Population 1540 480 1685 600 1718 1,500 1800 5,000 1816 6,210 1825 7,147 1828 7,466 1830 7,498 1 December 1834 9,433 1 December 1840 9,597 3 December 1843 9,883 3 December 1846 11,565 3 December 1852 11,087 3 December 1855 13,724 3 December 1861 16,708 3 December 1864 19,390\n\nYear Population 3 December 1867 20,322 1 December 1871 22,689 1 December 1875 26,012 1 December 1880 28,597 1 December 1885 31,704 1 December 1890 35,064 2 December 1895 39,388 1 December 1900 50,468 1 December 1905 59,765 1 December 1910 75,583 1 December 1916 67,197 5 December 1917 67,483 8 October 1919 75,380 16 June 1925 79,362 16 June 1933 81,329 17 May 1939 85,140\n\nYear Population 31 December 1945 70,600 29 October 1946 75,479 13 September 1950 89,030 25 September 1956 104,283 6 June 1961 116,195 31 December 1965 117,893 27 May 1970 117,306 31 December 1975 115,251 31 December 1980 110,993 31 December 1985 107,090 25 May 1987 111,386 31 December 1990 114,992 31 December 1995 116,533 31 December 2000 117,535 30 September 2005 119,833 31 March 2007 117,224\n\nYear Population 31 December 2008 118,103 31 December 2009 117,718 31 December 2010 119,734 31 December 2011 121,970 31 December 2012 116,945 31 December 2013 126,934\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil the early 1970s Offenbach was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries. The city hosts the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies to this day. The Deutscher Wetterdienst, commonly abbreviated as DWD, (translated from German as German Meteorological Service), residing in the Westend district.\n\nOffenbach was also the European center of typography, with Gebr. Klingspor and Linotype (inventors of Optima or Palatino typeface) moving to nearby Eschborn in the 1970s and MAN Roland printing machines still a major employer today. Typography and design still remain important with a cluster of graphic design and industrial design companies, as well as the university level Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main (HfG) design school and the Klingspor Museum.\n\nIn recent years Offenbach has become a popular location for a wide array of services, especially from the transport sectors. Offenbach is the host to the European headquarters of Honda,[24][failed verification] Hyundai Motors[25] and Kumho Tires.[26]\n\nAn office building in Offenbach-Kaiserlei\n\nA printing machine produced by Manroland\n\nHonda Small Hybrid Sports Concept developed in Offenbach\n\nThe Sheraton Offenbach\n\nEinkaufszentrum Ring Center\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nAttractions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Offenbach there is no specific Old Town, but there are several buildings which survived bombing during the war and have been restored. One of them is the Neo-baroque palace Büsingpalais with the Büsingpark, reconstructed in the 1980s. Today it is used as a congress center close to the Sheraton hotel. Between the shopping area and the Main, is the Lilipark and the Lilitemple, named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's fiancée Lili Schönemann. The most important building is the Isenburger Schloss [de] (Isenburg Palace), a renaissance palace from 1576. It is today used by the Offenbach Design University which is next to it. There is also a neoclassic palace in the borough Rumpenheim, the Rumpenheimer Schloss it now serves exclusively as domestic dwellings but the park is public.\n\nIsenburger Schloss, a Renaissance building, now used by the Offenbach Design University\n\nBüsingpalais with Büsingpark\n\nWilhelmsplatz a square with coffee houses and three times a week a market.\n\nBuildings of the French Protestant Church and the French Protestant Community.\n\nRumpenheim Palace.\n\nFormer Synagogue \"Capitol\" (now a concert hall next to the new Synagogue).\n\nThe Westend Quarter (19th century).\n\nSeveral art deco apartment houses.\n\nBuildings by early 20th century architect Hugo Eberhardt: \"Heyne\" Factory, main building of the Design University, AOK Insurance building.\n\nPrefabricated houses by Egon Eiermann in Lauterborn\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several festivals in Offenbach, some of these are:\n\nLichterfest im Büsing-Park (festival of lights in the park of the Büsing palais)\n\nNacht der Museen (with Frankfurt)\n\nMainuferfest\n\nCross Media Night\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nGerman Leather Museum\n\nKlingspor Museum, museum of typography and calligraphy\n\nHaus der Stadtgeschichte, municipal historical museum\n\nRosenheim-Museum for the painter Bernd Rosenheim\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nKickers Offenbach football club was founded in 1901.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nThe streets of central Offenbach are usually congested with cars during the rush hour. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets, are pedestrian-only streets. There are numerous car parks located throughout the city. The Offenbacher Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange where the Autobahnen A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 661 meet. The A661 crosses the A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 5 (Basel-Hannover).\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is connected by a major line of the S-Bahn railway system to Frankfurt. The station in the city center is Marktplatz. In general, six stations are located in Offenbach: Offenbach-Kaiserlei, Offenbach-Ledermuseum, Offenbach-Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost, Offenbach-Bieber, Offenbach-Waldhof. Trains run every 5–10 minutes between Offenbach and Frankfurt. A 24 hours Service between both cities was introduced in 2013. The journey from Offenbach Marktplatz to Frankfurt Main Station takes 15 minutes, Frankfurt Airport can be reached within 26 minutes. Suburban trains run underground in downtown Offenbach. The city tunnel was opened in 1996. Services split up at Offenbach-Ost Station to Hanau (S8 and S9 trains), Rödermark (S1) and Dietzenbach (S2). An often-addressed problem is that there is no direct interchange between regional and suburban trains in Offenbach, since the lines were separated when the tunnel was built. Therefore, residents and city officials have proposed several times that platforms for regional trains should be added to the Offenbach-Ost Station.\n\nThe city's municipal public transportation services are operated by the \"Offenbacher Verkehrsbetriebe\" (OVB) and its subcontractors. Nine routes (numbered 101–108 and 120) connect all boroughs with the major train stations at Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost and Kaiserlei as well as the Central Station. The bus network has very good coverage and frequency of service. All routes except for number 102 and number 107 busses stop at Marktplatz station, making it the most important transit hub in the city. Buses usually run with a 15-minute headway on working days and a 30-minute headway on Sundays, public holidays and after 8:00 pm. Exemptions are routes 103, 107 and 120 which run every 30 minutes. Number 103 and 120 buses share most of their route, creating a 15-minute headway on the shared section in downtown Offenbach. Those two routes also connect the city of Offenbach with its surrounding towns, Frankfurt am Main, Mühlheim am Main and Obertshausen. Out of all municipal bus services the number 101 bus is the most frequented route. It runs every 7 or 8 minutes Mondays through Fridays. Service on the other most frequented routes (104 and 105) is also increased to a 7/8-minute headway during rush hours. In addition to the municipal bus services there are regional buses that serve the city. Two express bus routes connect Offenbach to the city of Langen (route X83) and Bad Vilbel (X97). Other services are the number OF-30 bus to Heusenstamm, the 41 bus to Fechenheim as well as the 551 to Gravenbruch, Enkheim and Bad Vilbel.\n\nRegional trains stop at the Offenbach Central Station in the city's center. The station is on the Frankfurt-Hanau main line which is one of railway with the most traffic in Germany. Mostly hourly service for Wächsersbach, Fulda, Würzburg and Erbach call at the Offenbach Central Station. There is no long-distance train service at central station, although many high-speed trains pass through on their way from Frankfurt to Munich, Berlin or Hamburg. The station lost most of its importance when the suburban trains were re-routed through the newly build tunnel beneath Berliner Straße. Nonetheless a train ride from Offenbach Central Station to Frankfurt Central Station takes only ten minutes which makes it a much-appreciated route for commuters.\n\nFrankfurt Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is accessed from around the world via the Frankfurt Airport, (Flughafen Frankfurt am Main) which is located 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from Offenbach. The airport can be reached by car or bus and has two train stations, one for regional and one for long-distance traffic. The S-Bahn lines S8 and S9 (direction \"Offenbach Ost or \"Hanau\"), departing from the regional traffic station, take 25 minutes from the airport to get to Offenbach.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nJohann André (1741–1799), founder of the music publishing firm named after him\n\nMoritz Wilhelm August Breidenbach (1796–1857), jurist\n\nSalomon Formstecher (1808–1889), rabbi and philosopher\n\nPhilipp Mainländer (1841–1876), poet and philosopher\n\nSiegfried Guggenheim (1873–1961), lawyer, notary and art collector\n\nRichard Heyne (1882–1961), member of Landtag and producer\n\nChristian Dell (1882–1974), industrial designer, factory designer on Bauhaus\n\nHans Halberstadt (1885–1966), American fencer\n\nPrince Philipp of Hesse (1896–1980), prince and governor\n\nBernard von Brentano (1901–1964), writer, essayist and journalist\n\nHeinrich von Brentano (1904–1964), conservative politician\n\nBerthold Wolpe (1905–1989), typographer and type designer\n\nHans Hotter (1909–2003), opera singer\n\nHelene Mayer (1910–1953), fencer, Olympic champion\n\nEdith Schloss (1919–2011), artist, writer\n\nGottfried Böhm (1920–2021), architect who won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1986\n\nHermann Nuber (1935–2022), footballer\n\nRay Bumatai (1952–2005), musician, actor and singer\n\nJimmy Hartwig (born 1954), football player, manager and actor\n\nOlli Dittrich (born 1956), actor and comedian\n\nSmudo (born 1968), musician and rapper\n\nSven Beckert (born 1969), history professor at Harvard, winner of 2015 Bancroft Prize for Empire of Cotton\n\nHelma Wennemers (born 1969), German organic chemist and professor\n\nChristian Lammert (born 1969), political scientist\n\nChristian Sievers (born 1969), journalist\n\nTarek Al-Wazir (born 1971), politician, Deputy of the Hessian Minister-President\n\nAykut Anhan (born 1985), musician and rapper\n\nNotable residents\n\n[edit]\n\nJacob Frank (1726–1791), Jewish religious leader\n\nAbraham Bing (1752–1841), rabbi\n\nRudolf Koch (1876–1934), typeface designer, calligrapher and university professor\n\nFriedrich Kellner (1885–1970), official and justice inspector, attended Goethschule here\n\nHeinrich Kaminski (1886–1946), composer, worked here\n\nIgnatz Wiemeler (1895–1952), bookbinder and university professor[27]\n\nFritz Kredel (1900–1973), German-American artist and graphic designer, studied here\n\nRegina Jonas (1902–1944), first female Rabbi, ordained in Offenbach\n\nKarlgeorg Hoefer (1914–2000), calligrapher and typographer\n\nCornelia Hanisch (born 1952), fencer, Olympic winner\n\nDieter Müller (born 1954), footballer\n\nRudi Völler (born 1960), football player and manager\n\nGötz Otto (born 1967), actor\n\nAnthony Rother (born 1972), electronic musician\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nIsenburger Schloss\n\nBüsingpalais\n\nRumpenheimer Schloss\n\nThe market on Wilhelmsplatz\n\nDetail at the building of the HfG, designed by Hugo Eberhardt\n\nA typical street in Offenbach\n\nThe municipal hospital\n\nThe house where Rudolf Koch lived, one of the art deco houses in the southwestern part of the town\n\nOffenbach hills\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nGermany portal"
