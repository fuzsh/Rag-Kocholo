        "text": "German politician\n\nTarek Mohammed Al-Wazir (Arabic: طارق محمد الوزير; born 3 January 1971) is a German politician of Alliance '90/The Greens who served as deputy to the Hessian Minister-President, and Hessian Minister of Economics, Energy, Transport and Regional Development from 2014 to 2024. He is a member of the Landtag of Hesse and was co-chair of the Hessian Green Party.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Wazir was born in Offenbach am Main, Hesse, the son of an upper-class Yemeni father and a teacher.[1] He holds dual citizenship of Yemen and Germany. His parents divorced while he was a child, and he spent several years of his youth in the Yemeni capital (Sana'a) with his father, an experience he later described as very influential in his personal development.[2]\n\nAfter his Abitur in 1991, Al-Wazir studied political science in Frankfurt, where he earned a degree.\n\nPolitical career\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Wazir joined the German Green Party in 1989, and has been a member ever since. From 1992 to 1994 he was chair of the party's youth organisation (Green Youth) in Hesse. He has been a member of the Landtag since 1995 and served as co-chair of the Hessian Green Party (with Kordula Schulz-Asche).\n\nAl-Wazir was the leader of the Greens during the Hesse state election of 2008, and as such was the Green candidate for the position of Minister-President of Hesse. His party gained 7.5% of the votes. In the aftermath of the election, he pushed hard for a \"red–green–red\" coalition consisting of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens, and Die Linke. This would have succeeded if not for an internal revolt by SPD members, forcing a new election in January 2009. In the 2009 elections, he again stood as the Green candidate for minister-president. Surveys showed Al-Wazir to be Hesse's most popular politician at the time of the vote.[3] This time his party, also benefitting from popular anger at the SPD, increased its share to 13.7% of the vote, but the Greens remained out of government.\n\nOn 18 January 2014, after the 2013 state elections, Al-Wazir became Deputy of the Hessian Minister-President Volker Bouffier and Hessian Minister of Economics, Energy, Transport and Regional Development in a Black-Green coalition. Thus they formed only the third CDU-Green government in Germany's 16 federal states and the first in a big and socially diverse region.[4] As one of Hesse's representatives at the Bundesrat, Al-Wazir was a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Transport.\n\nAl-Wazir was a Green Party delegate to the Federal Convention for electing the president of Germany in 2017.[5]\n\nIn the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) following the 2021 German elections, Al-Wazir was part of his party's delegation in the working group on mobility, co-chaired by Anke Rehlinger, Anton Hofreiter and Oliver Luksic.[6]\n\nOther activities (selection)\n\n[edit]\n\nRegulatory agencies\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway (BNetzA), member of the Advisory Board[7]\n\nCorporate boards\n\n[edit]\n\nHelaba, alternate member of the supervisory board\n\nHA Hessen Agentur GmbH, chair of the supervisory board\n\nMesse Frankfurt, member of the supervisory board\n\nWirtschafts- und Infrastrukturbank Hessen (WIBank), chair of the advisory board\n\nNon-profit organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nHessischer Rundfunk, member of the broadcasting council\n\nFrankfurt Main Finance, member of the presidium\n\nRheingau Musik Festival, Member of the Board of trustees[8]\n\nStiftung Schloss Ettersburg, member of the board of trustees\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Wazir is married to a Yemeni woman, with whom he has two sons. They also split time between Germany and Yemen.[9]\n\nAl-Wazir's surname has been an aptronym since he assumed ministerial office in 2014, as الوزير \"al-wazīr\" is Arabic for \"the government minister.\"[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
