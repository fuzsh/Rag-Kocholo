        "text": "Biology faculty member Cecilia Toro shares: “At the end of each semester, most SciMath students present their conference work in class and many also create posters for our lively Science Symposium. This semester both of those presentation formats are difficult to replicate. Other SciMath faculty and I therefore decided to try something new, and asked students to create short summaries of their conference work to be presented in a blog format. We were very lucky that there was a preexisting website of which we could take advantage: students Dahlia McGrath ‘21 and Brooke Remsen ‘20 had created a blog, named Lambda, which they were planning to launch in the future. They graciously allowed us to take over this student-run publication during these unusual times. We have been populating Lambda with student posts from a number of Science and Mathematics courses. Many of these creative presentations make full use of the website format to include links to outside sources, from primary literature to YouTube videos to videos showcasing their novel inventions. We are excited to share this impressive work with the Sarah Lawrence community.”\n\nA Story is Not a Tree is a blog that covers the visual arts courses that fall under the umbrella of \"New Genres,\" such as Art from Code, Level Design, Drawing Machines, and Radical Game Design. Dating back to 2014, the site's most recent posts from March 2020 document the work students and faculty created together during our remote learning period. Faculty member Angela Ferraiolo shares that the site's name \"references a quote from the architect Christopher Alexander, who famously observed that 'a city is not a tree,' meaning that information and interaction in a city follows many interconnected channels and is not necessarily top down or organized in conventional ways. New Genres at Sarah Lawrence pursues the idea that the unexpected connections between ideas and events is a place of discovery for artists.\"\n\nOver the course of the Spring semester, SLC Librarians worked closely with art history faculty member Sarah Hamill's Histories of Modern and Contemporary Art course on a Wikipedia assignment. Students were asked to hone their research, citation, and synthesis skills to create a Wikipedia article for an artist underrepresented both in academia and more largely on the Internet. When SLC switched to remote learning, three intrepid students continued with the assignment, became first-time Wikipedia editors, and created the following articles:\n\nAmina Benbouchta\n\nLisa Rose Myers\n\nEmma Kohlmann\n\nWith our librarians' help, students were challenged to find and evaluate sources, understand issues relating to copyright and barriers to information access, and explore the impact of representation gaps on Wikipedia as well as in academic sources. Ultimately, their work provides a foundation upon which the wider world may discover these artists and their work.\n\nEli Caref, director of education at SLC’s Center for the Urban River at Beczak, shares this update from the banks of the Hudson River:\n\n“We’ve been working with our field course student, Emily Pressley ’20, on creating remote resources for teachers and parents in our network. Emily, our environmental educator/science coordinator Katie Lamboy, and I do a weekly Zoom call and then each take on a task for the week. Since we began, we have been able to disseminate a wide variety of lessons: from an at-home experiment on freezing water to a research activity based on historic data from CURB, as well as a series of worksheets complete with answer keys for teachers and a vocabulary list, all based on this video, which showcases our interactive Hudson River Estuary model. Currently we are working on an interactive game and activity based on our in-person Hudson River food web lesson.\n\nIn addition, I’ve been working remotely with teachers from the IB Biology program at Yonkers High School to help their students conduct research projects on the Hudson River using historic data from CURB, the HRECOS network, and Riverkeeper/NYC Water Trail Association bacterial data. Katie has been working with Bronxville High School students on a river health project, and in honor of Earth Day we partnered with Mercy College on a remote professional development session.\n\nWe can’t wait to get back in the field but in the meantime, we will continue to build out our virtual resources so we can reach as many intrepid ecologists as we can!”\n\nFilmmaking and Moving Image Arts faculty member Brian Emery shares: “Students in my Art of Editing: Post-Production class have been able to continue their work remotely using a combination of DaVinci Resolve (cross-platform and free editing software), the Frame.io video collaboration platform (which we had been using already), and Zoom (to meet synchronously as a group and for conferences). Frame.io has allowed students to provide invaluable, timecode-specific feedback to each other on their projects. Editing can often be an isolating and solitary pursuit—but it doesn't have to be. Our class has undertaken a final group project allowing students to edit a short film where the tasks of editing, color grading, and sound design are shared between four students. Working remotely is a valuable skill for students to learn and practice, especially now. Our class will livestream our final conference films in early May on the Filmmaking & Moving Image Arts Facebook page.”\n\nArt History faculty member Sarah Hamill’s students recently decided to participate in Pictures for Elmhurst, a major fundraiser selling photographers’ prints to benefit Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York. First-year students in Sarah’s Histories and Theories of Photography seminar used funds that had been reserved for refreshments at their now-postponed exhibition in the Barbara Walters Gallery to purchase a photograph by faculty member Justine Kurland. The photo will be included in the class’s exhibition—titled, “What do you want from me?”—when it is able to be rescheduled.\n\nStudents in Sarah’s lecture class, Histories of Modern and Contemporary Art, voted to together purchase a photograph by Michael Bailey-Gates, and to donate it to the College.\n\nHow does one turn a visual or studio art course into a remote class? Faculty member John O'Connor weighs in: “What we're able to do because of the structure of SLC teaching—providing access to specific art materials coupled with intensive one-on-one teaching—makes us unique. I think the art our students make during this time will truly standout, and we'll be featuring this regularly on the college's website, in class exhibitions on Instagram, and a comprehensive website archive of art made in all classes. We're also creating virtual, faculty-curated gallery \"van tours\" (in lieu of our physical monthly trips), museum visits, movie nights, and arranging for our upcoming guest speaker, Asif Mian, to do a remote public lecture on his work. Stay tuned!\n\nAnn Heppermann teaches audio fiction and narrative audio journalism in the writing program. She also runs The Sarah Lawrence College International Audio Fiction Award, aka The Sarahs, which celebrate the best audio fiction currently being made around the world.\n\n“Before the College moved to remote learning for the remainder of the spring semester, I organized Zoom tutorials for all of my writing colleagues. It not only was educational but also did wonders in terms of bringing us together as a team when it came to transferring to remote learning. A lot of the work that I do in my professional audio life involves remote work and utilizes numerous online platforms such as Slack, Soundcloud, Google Drive, and yes, Zoom. I already use a majority of these programs in the classroom so that students are well-versed in not only the craft of writing for the ear, but the tools used in the industry. This meant that I was able to quickly and happily transfer teaching those skills to my colleagues.\n\nI miss seeing my students and meeting with them in person—no screen can replace that. However, I am glad that the platforms I've already been using as part of the classroom experience actually aided not just in the transition of my class to a purely online setting, but also made it easier for me to help teach my colleagues (as well as some other faculty not in the writing program).\n\nSarah Lawrence College is a place where we lift each other up. I am so glad that I was able to lift up and help not just my students but also my talented and gracious colleagues.”"
