        "text": "You've found a suitable apartment on Wunderflats? Great! Just send a non-binding booking request by clicking \"Request to book\". We will get in touch with the landlord. They can either accept or decline it, we will let you know as soon as we have an answer. As soon as they confirm the apartment's availability and accept the request, you can book it.\n\nAll you need to do is:\n\nComplete your profile by verifying your identity and uploading all required documents\n\nConfirm the booking\n\nPay the Wunderflats Service Fee (learn more about this here)\n\nThat's it! At this point, the apartment is reserved for you. Now you and your landlord can sign a rental agreement and organize your move-in.\n\nRemember, your chances of a confirmed booking are significantly higher if you send multiple booking requests for different apartments. If you have any questions, we are here to support you at every step.\n\nYes, as a tenant you can register your address at the registration office or citizens' office (Anmeldung in Germany) in most apartments offered on Wunderflats.\n\nPlease look out for the information on the confirmation of residence (proof of address) in the listing when you make your booking. If \"landlord's confirmation of residence (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung)\" is included under \"Services\" as a feature of the apartment, then you can register in this apartment with the authorities.\n\nPlease find more information here on the registration (Anmeldung) and the confirmation of residence (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung). For more guidance on registration, have a look at our article: Anmeldung in Germany: how to register your address in Germany.\n\nPlease note: This article does not constitute legal advice – the information on this page has been prepared solely for your information. As we are not a law firm and act as a platform, we can and may share our estimations, but we cannot give you legal advice for your individual further proceedings\n\nOnce you've confirmed your booking and paid the Wunderflats Service Fee for Tenants, your chosen apartment is reserved for you. This means we can schedule a viewing with the landlord on your behalf before you sign the rental agreement. However, if the landlord is unavailable or the current tenant doesn't allow viewings, this might not be possible.\n\nThe good news is, our real estate photographers have already verified most apartments on our platform. You can identify these by the watermark in the top right corner of the photos. This way, you can save valuable time searching and scheduling apartment viewings!\n\nRemember, your chances of a confirmed booking are significantly higher if you send multiple booking requests for different apartments.\n\nWhen is an apartment reserved for me?\n\nAfter you send a booking request, we will forward it to the landlord. They can either accept or reject it, we will let you know as soon as we have an answer. In the meantime, you can send requests for other Wunderflats free of charge to increase your chances of a successful booking: By requesting at least 5 listings you’re 4 times more likely to get an apartment!\n\nYour booking request was accepted?\n\nGreat! To make sure you can successfully book the apartment, it's best to confirm it as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that you can only confirm one booking at a time. In order to confirm the booking, you'll need to complete your profile and upload the required documents to your account. Once you confirm the booking request, the Wunderflats Service Fee for tenants is due. Learn more about it here. The apartment is then reserved for you, all that's left to do is sign the contract and arrange your move.\n\nIf you withdraw the accepted booking request, you can confirm another booking.\n\nIf someone else was quicker to confirm than you, you will receive a \"Reserved for another tenant\" message.\n\nYour booking request was rejected?\n\nIn some cases, such as a change in availability, landlords can reject booking requests. You can search available apartments, and send requests for the most suitable ones.\n\nMore information:\n\nHow can I increase the chances of my booking request being accepted?\n\nWhich documents should I have at hand?\n\nAfter submitting your first booking request, we'll let you know what documents are needed. To expedite your booking, please upload all required documents to \"My Documents\" as soon as possible.\n\nWe will need:\n\nYour current address\n\nA valid government-issued identity document for each person moving in. This is required for identity verification through the Wunderflats Account (find more information about identity verification here).\n\nDepending on whether you are studying or working, we may require a few more documents:\n\nIf you are an employee: a copy of your employment contract or current payslips\n\nIf your company pays the rent for you: a confirmation that they cover the monthly rent. You can use this template for the confirmation.\n\nIf you are self-employed or a freelancer: financial evidence to confirm that you have enough financial liquidity to cover the monthly rent (e.g. a current bank account statement)\n\nIf you are an intern or an apprentice: proof of internship or apprenticeship and financial evidence (e.g. a current bank account statement) or security by a third party including an income statement and a copy of the guarantor's ID or passport\n\nIf you are a student: proof of enrolment and financial evidence (e.g. a current bank account statement) or security by a third party including an income statement and a copy of the guarantor's ID or passport\n\nWe verify the identity and solvency of all tenants with these documents. You do not need to submit any other documents, such as SCHUFA information.\n\nAt Wunderflats we work with all-inclusive rental prices, which also include the furniture surcharge and monthly utilities such as heating, electricity, water, and internet.\n\nThe fixed rate for utilities depends on the average consumption of the last years and the number of tenants. According to the experience of our Wunderflats landlords, the costs of different consumer behaviors balance out well over several tenants. In case of significantly higher consumption, an additional payment might be due, which can be offset against the security deposit."
