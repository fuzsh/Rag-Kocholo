        "text": "Thanks! I find that by the time of the Battle of Actium Mark Antony (and much less Caesarion) had no chance of really taking control of Rome itself. Roman society would not accept him and he in turn was fully commited to the east with Cleopatra. Much more sensible for him to remain in the east as an despot while his domain grew increasingly alien to Rome under the reforms of Cleopatra and Ptolemy.\n\nI used AD and BC for the sake of simplicity. The fate of Christianity is a curious topic. I agree with @WheelyWheelyLegsNoFeely that much of Jesus' upbringing and early life may remain unchangead under the Domain, as well with the fact that, cut of politically and culturally from the west, Christianity might never reach it.\n\nHowever, he would face different challenges. Ptolemy Caesar, as Pharaoh of Egypt, Master of the East, King of Kings, etc etc, is a religious figure. While Rome tolerated Jesus until his religious position threatened the Jewish client king Herod, here Ptolemy might be far more hostile to this \"Son of God\" (he is a son of a god, Caesar, as well as of Ra, of course). And we must also take in consideration that this Hellenic Reinassance would probably be hardcore pagan and defensive of its polytheism.\n\nIt could be interesting if Christianity became syncretic with the pagan gods and maybe even with the role of Pharaoh as a figurehead for the Christ i nthe future.\n\nCrap this is interesting, will now make a follow-up focused on that.\n\nThe Roman emperors were also religious figures however, given their position as Pontifex Maximus and their own claims to divinity, or at least divine descent.\n\nThe biggest difference that would lead to Jesus being even less tolerated by the authorities (although I also don’t know how you can be less tolerated than by having them crucify you) is that while Judea in Rome was a fringe borderland, within the Dominate Judea is right smack dab is the middle of everything, and particularly seems to sit in the middle of Antony’s personal holdings and those of the Ptolemies.\n\nIt might look broken on phones, I swear I tried but it just wouldn't take the full picture\n\nAll pictures were taken from Wikipedia except for the map, which was made with EU4, the Extended Timeline mod, and the map capture tool (turns out that mods that change province borders are reflected on the map created), before being put in Paint and further edited for accuracy.\n\nThe War of 1870 [I'm taking name suggestions] was brief but major war in Europe that took place from 1870 to 1871. It was contested by Spain, Italy, Russia and the German states (which over the course of the war unified into Germany) on one side and France and Austria-Hungary on one side.\n\nThe war's origins are steeped in several long running conflicts of the states involved in the war, but its immediate powder keg started when the Spanish crown was offered to Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern, a distant, Catholic relative of the then-King of Prussia, Wilhelm I. Leopold, pressured by Prussian Minister-President Otto von Bismarck, accepted the crown and was proclaimed King Leopold I of Spain on June 30, 1870. This immediately sent the French into a furor and, engaging in his typical manner of blunt, brusque, and heavy-handed foreign policy, Napoleon III threatened war if Leopold did not renounce the Spanish throne. As Leopold was already on the throne, Spain and Prussia both rejected this, and rather than risk losing face, France declared war on both countries. The South German states had defensive treaties with Prussia and joined the war on their side, as did the Prussia-dominated North German Confederation.\n\nThe two-front war posed a problem for France; Prussian organization meant that, despite earlier French mobilization, Prussia would bear more troops more quickly, while France had to divide itself in order to defend the Pyrenees. Knowing he could not spare any troops, Napoleon III recalled his garrison in Rome at the beginning of the war, whose purpose had previously been to ensure that his erstwhile Italian allies did not invade the Papal States, but, in an attempt to preserve papal sovereignty, sent an ultimatum that any state that invaded the Papal States would be at war with France. This ultimatum caused great public furor in Italy, where protests essentially demanded the government invade Latium and seize Rome. Victor Emanuel II called the French's bluff, figuring they wouldn't open a third front when already facing two, and invaded the Papal States in August. Napoleon III, once again cornered, declared war on Italy, opening a third front to his war.\n\nNapoleon's declaration of war on Italy had massive repercussions. Increasingly fearful of the prospect of a Prussian victory in the war, having bad blood with both them and Italy, and emboldened by his defeat of a push for a more liberal reorganization of the Austrian state in 1867, Emperor Franz Josef declared war on the German states, Italy, and Spain, claiming they intended to dismember France and upset the European balance of power. This, in turn, activated the provisions of a reinsurance treaty between Prussia and Russia, who due their hatred of both Austria and Napoleon III were eager to enter the war. This turn of events seriously alarmed the British, who considered entering the war with France and Austria, but Bismarck's assurances that Belgian and Dutch neutrality would be respected and Prussia inflicting serious military defeats on France dampened Britain's motives and capacity to enter the war, and so they remained neutral.\n\nThrough Prussia and Italy were somewhat hampered by facing multiple fronts, for France and Austria these problems were far worse; the two states were not able to properly resist militarily; Austria had fallen and France asked for an armistice by March of 1871. The military victories against France and the heavy-handed attitudes of Napoleon III's foreign ministry inspired a great increase in German nationalism, which the Austrian declaration of war hardly dampened. This inspired the German states to proclaim the Empire of Germany in January 1871, with Prussian King Wilhelm I as Emperor of Germany.\n\nFollowing the end of hostilities, negotiations were held in Frankfurt, resulting in the Treaties of Frankfurt, Offenbach, and Nice. The first dealt with France and its cessions to Spain, Germany, and Russia. It was forced to hand the territories of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany and Rosellón and Oran to Spain, as well as recognize Morocco as being within Spain's sphere of influence and handing the title of protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire back to Russia, as well as paying an indemnity to all three countries.\n\nThe Treaty of Offenbach dealt with Austria and its cessions to Germany, Spain, and Russia. Galicia, Lodomeria, and Bukovina were handed over to Russia, while Bohemia was annexed into the German Empire. Austria was demoted to an archduchy, and while not directly annexed into Germany proper, Archduke Rudolf of Austria (Franz Josef, humiliated by the loss, abdicated the throne in favor of his son) maintained the title of King of Bohemia in addition to being Archduke of Austria and Margrave of Moravia [I'm making this up, I'm not sure what exactly is the title for Moravia]. In his capacity as King of Bohemia (which was also his highest title), he was subservient to Wilhelm I, essentially vassalizing Austria (with the expectation that it would be, alongside Moravia, eventually annexed into Germany proper). The rest of the lands not awarded to Italy by the Treaty of Nice were given to the new and restored Kingdom of Hungary, which would be a client state of Germany, Russia, and Italy.\n\nThe Treaty of Nice was concerned Italy and its gains. Italy annexed the Papal States; France returned Savoy and Nice to Italy and ceded Corsica as well, along with a recognition of Italian claims over Tunisia and an indemnity; and Austria granted Italy Trentino, Istria, the Austrian Littoral, Carniola, and Dalmatia (Carinthia and Styria remained a part of Austria and was eventually annexed into Germany).\n\nThe war would have significant repercussions and it is generally heralded as the end of the Concert of Europe. The grievances brought about by this war shaped the future alliance blocs of late 19th century Europe, along with the completion of the unifications of Germany and Italy. It stabilized Spain and halted its decline, while expanding Russian power. The emergence of a new Hungarian state was also an important development, and the Austrian collapse changed the Balkan landscape to one where Russia, the Ottomans, Germany, and Italy all had active interests. There were also important political developments; Napoleon III was overthrown in the course of the war, with the French Third Republic established. The republic lasted even less time than the Second and the election of 1871 saw a monarchist-majority Parliament elected, which soon restored the monarchy under Philip VII. Meanwhile, in an ironic twist of fate, Bismarck, the man who had essentially orchestrated the entire war, was forced to resign in its aftermath, as the treaties that resulted in the aftermath of the war, in particular the Treaty of Offenbach, were entirely antithetical to his foreign policy goals, leaving a unified Germany to chart a new course. These fault lines remained until they exploded in the beginning of the First World War.\n\nThe 2009 Belarusian presidential election was held in two rounds on the 25th June and 12th July 2009. Incumbent President Siarhei Navumchyk of the Conservative Christian Party (CCP) was running for re-election to a second term, constitutionally the last one a Belarusian President is permitted to be elected to.\n\nNavumchyk’s government had overseen significant free market reforms, significantly cutting back the Belarusian welfare state and increasing its international trade with both Russia and the rest of Europe. He received significant praise for being a ‘bridge-builder’, and in the 2005 legislative election the CCP made significant gains against the left-wing opposition parties, the BSDH (Dialogue) and PCB.\n\nAs his term progressed, however, Navumchyk began to prove more controversial. The CCP, as its name suggests, advocated a socially conservative policy agenda, including violent crackdowns on drug offenses, prostitution and on groups considered to ‘threaten the state’ such as Russian speakers and homosexuals. These were met with condemnation from the left, particularly by Mayor of Minsk Uładzimir Hančaryk, who severely reprimanded many senior members of the capital’s police force.\n\nEven more damaging to Navumchyk than this was the impact of the Great Recession on Belarus’s economy. With exports quickly declining and the pared-back welfare provisions the country now had, the recession caused dramatic increases in unemployment and poverty in Belarus, which angered many voters.\n\nThe opposition BSDH and PCB chose to form a more formal alliance in response to the crisis, both to coordinate their nomination for the presidential election more formally and to help their electoral chances by avoiding the division in the left-wing vote seen in previous legislative elections. The coalition was named the United Social Democratic Forces (ASDS), and its nominee was Mayor of Grodno Alaksandar Milinkievič, who had (albeit less vocally than Hančaryk) condemned and fought against police brutality in his city.\n\nMilinkievič comfortably led Navumchyk in the polls prior to the election, and he came only 4.08% short of an absolute majority in the first round. In the second round, he easily defeated Navumchyk with 61.3% of the vote to 36.2%, with the remaining 2.5% going to the None Of These Candidates option. As of 2022, no candidate for President has won as many raions or as big a voteshare as Milinkievič in this election."
