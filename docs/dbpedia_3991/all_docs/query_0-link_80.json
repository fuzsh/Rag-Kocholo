        "text": "67\n\nABL. Albert Büttner founded in 1923 the company Albert Büttner Bayerische Elektrozubehör AG in Lauf (near Nürnberg, Bayern). For a while the shortened name ABL BEZEG has also been used. In 1925 Büttner designed an earthed plug and socket for domestic use that was a forerunner of the Schuko plug (see Origin of Schuko).\n\nIn 1986 ABL merged with Sursum Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft, Leyhausen & Co. in Nürnberg. The company name changed to ABL-SURSUM.\n\n36\n\nGebrüder Adt AG. The company stems from Pappmachéfabrik Adt (manufacturer of paper mâché products), founded in 1839 by Peter III Adt, in Ensheim, near Saarbrücken. The heydays of paper mâché processing ended when Bakelite and comparable resins were developed. Eduard Franz Adt (grandson of Peter III) widened the product range in the early 1900s by using new resins as Lackit, Adit and Australit (patented by Adt). Because of good insulating properties, they were also used for insulated conduits and electro-technical accessories.\n\nAfter WW I the Saar region was controlled by France; the Adt factory was expropriated in 1919. A part of the Adt family moved to Hessen. Production of electro-technical material restarted in Wächtersbach (Hessen) and Gross-Auheim (near Hanau). After reunification of Saarland with Germany in 1935, Adt returned to Ensheim. After WW II, Saarland became again under French administration, until 1957. Among others for economic (currency) reasons the company was unable to restore its market position. The electro-technical expertise was taken over by Hager in 1955 (see below). Adt's facilities in Ensheim are still in use by the Hager Group.\n\nDesign 1907, '08, '12 logos: Peter Behrens\n\n28\n\n38\n\nAllgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft AG. Emil Rathenau founded in 1883 the Deutsche Edison-Gesellschaft für angewante Elektrizität in Berlin. He had acquired licenses to use some of Edison's lamp patents. In 1887 the company expanded its production range and adopted the AEG name. Chief engineer Dolivo-Dobrowolsy developed a three-phase electric power system; AEG became a leading company in know-how and equipment for electrical power engineering and transport (see also Kabelwerk Oberspree).\n\nAfter WW II AEG lost many factories because they were situated in the Russian occupation zone. The other parts of AEG moved to Frankfurt am Main. In 1967 Telefunken (radio, TV) merged with AEG. Telefunken was sold in 1984 and two years later the other parts of AEG were acquired by Daimler-Benz. In 1994 the household division was sold to Electrolux, who now owns the rights to use and license the AEG trade name.\n\nBechmann GmbH & Co. KG. In 1947 Josef Bachmann founded the Bachmann KG sales agency in Stuttgart. Son Dieter Bachmann started production its own connectors. The company was renamed Bachmann GmbH & Co. KG in 1979. Production in Asia started in 1994. The family-led Bachmann Group has now centres for production and development of home and office electronic components and systems in Germany, Romania and China.\n\nBals Elektrotechnik GmbH. Founded in 1957 by Günter Bals and his wife Elisabeth. The company, based in Kirchhundem-Albaum, Westfalen, has specialized in plugs and outlets for heavy duty and outdoor applications. From 1968 IEC 60309 ('CEE Norm') became a dominant range of pluggable connectors. More recently Bals produces also connectors to charge electric vehicles. M1\n\nBender & Wirth GmbH & Co. In 1883 Hermann Bender and Carl August Wirth started in Kierspe, Westfalen, production of electro-technical articles including sockets for the lighting industry. Nowadays the company produces various types of lamp fittings for lower voltage lamps including LED 's.\n\n80\n\nGebrüder Berker GmbH & Co. KG. Robert and Hugo Berker founded in 1919 the Spezialfabrik für elektrotechnische Apparate in Schalksmühle, Westfalen. In 1970 three electro-technical companies, Berker, Gira and Jung have commonly founded a subsidiary company, Insta, that develops and produces LED illumination and matching accessories according to KNX standard for offices and works. The Hager Group (see below) acquired Berker in 2010.\n\nL64\n\nWilly Berger elektro-mechanische Werkstätten in Beelitz, Brandenburg. Date of founding is unknown, but mentioned in a 1962 DAMW list of manufacturers that used Phenoplast and Aminoplast resins. Berger used the trade name BEMA. The company is not mentioned in lists of companies that were involved in Soviet reparation schemes. It is likely that Berger has closed its electro-mechanical work during or at the end of the DDR. Logo left has been found on Bakelite 220 Volt plugs, logo right on a Bakelite 42 Volt concentric plug and socket.\n\nF8\n\nGebrüder Broghammer. Manufacturer of plugs in Schramberg, Baden-Würtemberg. The company had an MPAD mark in 1938 and is listed in the 1959 Deutsche Elektro-Industrie list. More recent information has not been found.\n\n2H Brunnquell elektrotechnische Apparate. Founded in 1913 in Bebra-Sondershausen, Thüringen by Oskar Brunnquell and his wife. Later, Brunquell merged with Lindner & Co. in Sondershausen (see below). In 1946 the company was expropriated and factory equipment was confiscated by the Soviet Union for reparations. In 1948 Brunnquell became a part of VEB Elektroinstallation Sondershausen (see below). The same year Karl-Heinz Brunnquell, son of founder, fled to Bavaria and restarted Brunnquell Elektro-Geräte-Bau GmbH in Ingolstadt. The company merged in 2012 with Heinrich Kopp GmbH (see below) and moved to Kahl am Main. The name Brunnquell disappeared.\n\n23\n\nBusch-Jaeger Elektro GmbH. Hans-Curt Jäger (Jaeger) founded in 1887 in Schalksmühle a company that made metal fittings for electric lamps with Swan screw fitting. At the same time in Lüdenscheid Julius Bergmann and Friedrich Wilhelm Busch started manufacturing metal odds and ends for uniforms and shortly thereafter also parts for electrical accessories. In 1926 the Vereinigte elektrotechnische Fabrieken F.W. Busch und Gebrüder Jaeger AG was founded. The company was the first that was allowed to produce Schuko plugs and sockets (patented by Siemens). Shortly after WW II the company designed for a while hot plates for cooking and electrical radiators, only to survive. In 1969 Busch-Jaeger GmbH became a part of the Swiss Brown, Boveri & Cie, AG. In 1988 BBC merged with the Swedish Asea and became ABB.\n\nVH\n\nWilly Buschhaus KG, Fabrik elektrischer Erzeugnisse. Lüdenscheid, Westfalen. Details about the company have not been found. Bakelite plugs in the museum collection suggest that the Buschhaus company was at least active in the 1950s.\n\n39\n\nDr. Deisting & Co. GmbH. Dr. Deisting founded in 1909 in Kierspe (Westfalen) the Spezialfabrik elektrotechnischer Installations-Apparate und Isolierstoff-Presswerk. The company was renown for high quality Bakelite plugs and sockets, but was unable to make the switch to more modern thermosetting polymers and had to close in 1975. Desco Werk, Seger and Angermeyer in Ittersbach, Baden Württemberg. Manufacturer of insulated cables. Details about the company are unknown. The most recent patent that has been found dates back to 1982. The IEC 60320 C7 plug in the museum collection has probably been made more recently.\n\nDüwi GmbH: see REV Ritter GmbH.\n\nDDR ABB from 2012\n\nN57\n\nElektroinstallation Annaberg (VEB EIA) in Annaberg, Sachsen. The Elektrische Fabriken Annaberg, founded in 1921 by AEG. Became VEB EIA in 1948 after expropriation by Soviet Russia. After German reunification bought by ABB Stotz-Kontakt, but closed in 2006.\n\nIn 2012 the company restarted as Elektro Innovation Annaberg GmbH, wholesale of various types of circuit breakers. VEB Elektro-Industrie Plauen; see Vogtländische Elektro-Industrie.\n\nN06\n\nElektroinstallation Ruhla (VEB ERU) in Ruhla, Thüringen. EIR may refer to the same company as ERU. It is likely that shortly after WW II Storch & Stehmann (see below) was incorporated in the Volkseigener Betrieb ERU. What has happened with VEB ERU / EIR after German reunification is not clear.\n\n54\n\nN11\n\nEllinger & Geissler, Fabrik elektrotechnischer Bedarfsartikel. In 1900 (or 1905) founded by Otto Ellinger and Max Geissler in Tharandt, near Dresden. The company moved soon to nearby Dorfhain. They used the trade name Elgesit. In 1946 the company was expropriated and became the VEB Elektro- und Radiozubehör Dorfhain ELRADO, which was included in 1969 in VEB Kombinat Elektronische Bauelemente Dorfhain. In 1991, a part of the VEB became Sächsische Elektronik-Werke GmbH in Klingenberg (later: AB Elektronik Sachsen GmbH), manufacture of electromechanical products for the automotive industry. Carl Ernst, Fabrik elektrotechnischer Steckkontakte. Founded in Berlin in the 1910s or earlier. Details have not been found. The company probably didn't survived the 1929-'32 depression years.\n\nM7\n\nFrankl & Kirchner GmbH & Co. KG, Fabrik für Elektromotoren und elektrische Apparate, was founded in 1886 by L. Frank and Wilhelm Kirchner in Mannheim. In 1891, Frankl became regional sales representative of Siemens & Halske. Documentation about activities of the company in the first half of the 20st century have not been found. It seems likely that Frankl & Kirchner moved in 1950 to Schwetzingen, Baden-Württemberg and was renamed EFKA, which is now a manufacturer of motors and controls for industrial sewing machines.\n\n*\n\nFelmas. Gustav Schortmann started in 1868, in Leipzig, the manufacture of parts for pianoforte musical instruments. From ca. 1900 Gustav's son Oskar was in charge. In 1914 Schortmann & Sohn switched to production of parts for ignition mechanisms of bombs (source). Shortly after WW I the Fabrik elektrische Spezialartikel und Metallwaren Schortmann was established. The acronym Felmas was chosen as trade name. In the 1930s it was one of German market leaders for plugs and appliance connectors, but after WW II the company was severely hit by Soviet Union reparations. New Felmas installation materials have been made, but the successful pre-war years were definitely over. Registration of the Gustav Schortmann & Sohn ended in 2009.\n\n* Felmas did not had an MPAD code; Bakelite casts were made by Bisterfeld & Stolting.\n\nGEMA. Gesellschaft für elektroakustische und mechanische Apparate mbH. Company founded in 1934 in Berlin by Paul-Günther Erbslöh and Hans-Karl Freiherr von Willisen. They were pioneers in developing new sonar and radar techniques, which found large scale usage at the German Navy. The company did not survived military actions at the end of WW II.\n\nThe museum has a plug with GEMA logo shown left. It has no other marks that could confirm that it has been made by the above mentioned company (see image No. 32)\n\nVL\n\nRichard Giersiepen, Elektrotechnische Fabrik. Richard Giersiepen and his brother Gustav founded in 1905 the Fabrik von Apparaten für elektrische Beleuchtung in Wichlinghausen, now part of Wuppertal. Production started with tumble switches; other electrical accessories for domestic use followed soon. The company moved in 1910 to close by Radevormwald and was first renamed Gebrüder Giersiepen and in 1920 Elektrotechnische Industrie Giersiepen; the logo with E and I (Gothic I) was introduced. In 1964 company name was shortened to Giersiepen Radevormwald and the Gira logo was introduced. Gira is one of the founders of the Insta compay; see Berker for details. Gira is still a family-owned company.\n\n1960s from 1992\n\nN17\n\nElektroschaltgeräte Grimma. Electro-technical company Walther-Werke (see there), founded in 1897 in Grimma, was expropriated by SMAD (Soviet Military Administration in Germany). In 1952 the company was registered VEB Elektroschaltgeräte Grimma, that became part of VEB keramische Werke Hermsdorf. See Sachsen Archives for more details (in German). In the German Democratic Republic years the company was in particular active in manufacturing heavy duty (380V and above) switchgear and electrical accessories.\n\nIn 1992, after the German reunification, Elektroschaltanlagen Grimma GmbH restarted production of appliances for energie distribution, railway, hospitals and automation.\n\nGroh GmbH Pausa. Company founded in 1921 in Pausa (Vogtland, Sachsen). Manufacture and trade of electrical installation materials, especially manufacture and distribution of electronic fuses for households and industry.\n\nShortly after WW II the family business was expropriated during the DDR era but returned to the owners after German reunification.\n\nHager Group. Peter Hager and his sons Oswald and Hermann founded in 1955 Hager oHG, elektrotechnische Fabrik in Ensheim (Saarbrücken), Saarland. The Hager Group consists of a large number of electro-technical companies and business firms, and operates as European Company SE (Societas Europaea). Hager has manufacturers in seven European countries, India and China. They focus on energy distribution, electrical wiring and building automation. Headquarters of the still family owned company are based in Blieskastel, Saarland.\n\nHerth & Buss. Company founded in 1925 by Philipp Herth and Jakob Buss in Langen (near Offenbach, Hessen). Three years later the company moved to Offenbach. Manufacturing electric parts for cars became core business, but given the Bakelite 2-pin plug in the collection, accessories for domestic use have also been marketed*. The company, renamed Herth + Buss Fahrzeugteile GmbH & Co. KG, is now based in Heusenstamm (near Offenbach).\n\n* plug casts were made by Hugo Burgmaier.\n\n2M\n\nRichard Hirschmann GmbH & Co. In 1924 Richard Hirschmann started production of simple, single wire plugs, now known as banana plugs in Esslingen (Württemberg). Soon domestic 220V plugs were added to the product line. From 1933 Hirschmann shifted to development and production of various types of antennas for receiving and transmission of radio and television signals. In 1997 the company was was acquired by Rheinmetall and later by a British investor who split the company in three parts. Hirschmann GmbH was closed in 2004.\n\nW. Holzer & Co. KG.
