Thus, it is possible that I cannot consider your application.\n\nOnce I scanned your form, and given that I have free capacity, we'll schedule an appointment to discuss possible topics.\n\nI do not have an openly available list, but most of my topics are centered around knowledge graphs.\n\nFeel free to bring your own topic suggestions, as long as they fit into my research topics (see above).\n\nTheses with companies are possible, but only under certain conditions:\n\nThe topic has to fit into my research topics (see above).\n\nThe thesis still has to be scientific (e.g., “apply method X from the literature to dataset Y” is not scientific)."
