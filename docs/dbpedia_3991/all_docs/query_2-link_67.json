        "text": "The following is an archived discussion of a featured article nomination. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe article was promoted by Gog the Mild via FACBot (talk) 18 December 2020 [1].\n\nNominator(s): Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThis article is about Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, an English composer, music critic, pianist and writer who is perhaps best known as the author of piano epics lasting anywhere between two and nine hours, and for having gone into self-imposed obscurity for some four decades. Sorabji's life and music have long been shrouded in myth, but this situation has improved considerably in recent years. The article draws on the recent scholarly writings that have addressed the myths, misconceptions and sensationalism that pervade much of the non-scholarly discourse on Sorabji, and presents a more thorough, objective portrait of him as a person and artist. The entry is coming fresh off a peer review and I look forward to this FAC (my first one in my nearly ten years on Wikipedia). Whatever its outcome, I believe the text presents one of the most fascinating and colorful biographies and creative legacies, musical or other, of the 20th century, and I hope reviewers derive at least some enjoyment from it. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nHi Toccata quarta, I've no particular knowledge of Sorabji, or the finer points of music, so I'll be reviewing the prose from the perspective of a non-expert who stumbled upon the page. Making notes as I read:\n\nLead - \"modest trust fund that freed him from the need to work\" - almost sounds like an oxymoron. Do we need the word \"modest\" here?\n\nRemoved. While it may be seen here, for example, I agree that it can sound like an oxymoron and details on his finances are presented elsewhere in the article. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - \"Sorabji was their only child and they had married on 18 February 1892\" - I had to read this twice to understand it, perhaps because it's chronologically backwards. Maybe flip the order of the two facts in the sentence?\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - \"...took music lessons in piano, organ and harmony...\" - does \"harmony\" have a specialized meaning here, or does it just mean harmony? Seemed odd to read [instrument], [instrument] and harmony.\n\nThe study of harmony can encompass things like the emancipation of the dissonance and functional harmony. Usually it's a general statement, like \"he studied music (theory)\", though music theory is broader in scope and includes the study of harmony. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSounds like it's fine as is. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding your meaning. Ajpolino (talk)\n\nBiography - note 3: \"identified with Southern cultures and his Persian heritage and he visited Italy at least eight times...\". \"Southern cultures\" hits my American ear as \"the culture of the American South\" (indeed Southern culture redirects to Culture of the Southern United States). Is Southern European cultures meant? If so, the added word would be a nice clarifier.\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - \"The performance lasted 90 minutes—twice as long as it should have.\" Do we know why? Did the pianist play slowly, add material, something else?\n\nThe sources do not offer anything conclusive on this, but I have added a note summarizing some of the performance's alleged deficits. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThe note looks great! Ajpolino (talk)\n\nBiography - \"...and his activity as music critic peaked.\" my brain expected an \"a\" between \"as\" and \"music\".\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - same comment as for the lead \"modest trust fund\". Is it modest if it frees one from the need to work?\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - \"Sorabji's father was affected by the fall of the pound and rupee in 1931, stopped supporting the publication of Sorabji's scores...\" reads odd. Perhaps \"Sorabji's father, affected by the fall..., stopped supporting...\"?\n\nRewritten as suggested. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBiography - \"A process began around 1936 and the bigamous marriage was declared null and void...\" - \"A process\" seems strangely vague. Maybe \"Legal proceedings\"? Or just rephrase somehow.\n\nReworded according to the sources. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nMusic - \"Various religious and occult references appear in Sorabji's music, including: allusions to the tarot; a setting of a Catholic benediction; and sections named after the seven deadly sins.\" - I'm not sure the semicolons are essential here. Perhaps \"...Sorabji's music including allusions... tarot, ...benediction, and ...sins.\" would do just as well (and be less intimidating to the reader).\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nMusic - I can't pretend to have completely followed all of the analysis here, but I think some degree of shop talk is appropriate for this kind of article, and the writing is such that I can typically understand the gist of a sentence or paragraph even if I'm not conversant in all of the ideas.\n\nMusic - You have the wikilink interpretative directions targeting Glossary of music terminology. I'm not sure where in the glossary I should be looking. There's no entry for \"interpretative directions\".\n\nA page like the following would be ideal. Unfortunately, Wikipedia does not have the article Performance direction (or Interpretive/interpretative direction[s]), so the glossary link is the best we have. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAh, I see. I was looking for a definition of \"interpretative directions\" in Glossary of music terminology but I suppose instead the glossary is serving as List of possible interpretative directions. For what it's worth, my opinion is if you think Interpretative directions is a decent topic for a standalone article, you could just leave a redlink for some future editor to fill in. If not, a linkless \"interpretative directions\" isn't so bad. I've never heard the term before but I got the point: they're directions written in the music to help you interpret the composer's will (I think). Ajpolino (talk)\n\nI agree that the term is pretty much self-explaining, so I have chosen to remove it for now. I looked around and stumbled on List of musical symbols, which overlaps somewhat with the aforementioned EL, so it might be best to discuss the creation of a new article at WT:CM first. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nOtherwise, an excellent article and an engaging read. I read it in one sitting. After seeing your thoughts on the above, I'll be happy to support. Thanks for the read! Ajpolino (talk)\n\nMany thanks; I hope the changes I have just made to the article have adequately addressed the issues you listed above. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGreat! Moved to support. Thanks again, and I hope you're staying well. Ajpolino (talk)\n\nThank you very much for the vote of support, as well as for your wishes, which I can only echo. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI contributed to the peer review. Am happy to support this for FA but I think it may need an image review (an area where I lack any expertise) to make sure they are all in order - e.g. the book jacket illustration looks as if it might be dodgy - @Nikkimaria:? --Smerus (talk)\n\nThank you very much for the endorsement (and, belatedly, for your feedback at PR)! Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSuggest adding alt text\n\nHello Nikkimaria, thank you for the thorough review. I have added alt texts for all the images. A few of the cases appear to be covered by Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative text for images#Captions and nearby text, but let me know if this is not the case. I think my English is decent, but it is not my first language and I probably lack the vocabulary for talking about clothing and describing people's appearances or postures. Still, I hope the alt texts are reasonable. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSince the subject here is the person and not his clothing, I wouldn't worry too much about describing that. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nOK; I have shortened the alt texts which contained overly detailed descriptions of that. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nBefore we continue, I would just like to mention that I think all the images (with one exception, which I'll get to) should be fine. It appears the cropped ones might be causing some confusion, perhaps because my knowledge of how to tag those is flawed. Two of the cropped images were cropped again on 25 November by (see [2] and [3]), which may have impacted the information displayed for them, though the diffs suggest no such thing. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:Kaikhosru_Shapurji_Sorabji,_circa_1950_(cropped).png: don't see that licensing at the given source - where is it coming from? Ditto File:Kaikhosru_Shapurji_Sorabji_in_1945_(b)_(cropped).jpg\n\nI don't know if the information is not displaying properly in the cropped versions, but File:Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, circa 1950.png and File:Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji in 1945 (b).jpg mention that OTRS volunteers have reviewed the communication containing the permissions and the works have been released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:Madeline_Matilda_Worthy_(cropped).jpg: what does the author of the source say about the provenance of this work?\n\nThe image comes from Sean Vaughn Owen's Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji: An Oral Biography. It was taken by John Chancellor (d. 1916). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nRight, but I'm wondering what Owen might say about where he got the image from. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nThis is not mentioned in the text, but given where he did his research and who he was in contact with, I'm about 99% certain it comes from the Sorabji Archive. As an example, this photograph on Owen's Facebook page dedicated to Sorabji mentions the Sorabji Archive as the source. Also, Owen's biography of Sorabji is hosted on the Sorabji Archive's website, for what that may or may not be worth in terms of copyright status. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:Shapurji_Sorabji_(1863-1932)_(cropped).jpg: where was this first published?\n\nThis photograph was first published in April 1905 by The Textile Mercury. As far as the three photographs following the lead are concerned, I let myself be guided by the information I received at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions/Archive/2020/September#Is this photo PD?. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:Kaikhosru_Shapurji_Sorabji_(young)_(cropped).jpg: don't see an author credit at given source - what else is known about this image?\n\nFile:Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji (young).jpg mentions that the author is William Henry Grove, who died in 1906. The photo was taken in Westminster by the studio of Window & Grove, with Frederick Richard Window having died in 1875. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:K_k_sorabji_p_symphony_6.png: what qualifies the uploader to release this work under a free license? Ditto File:Sorabji,_Organ_Symphony_No._3_manuscript,_page_124_(cropped).jpg, File:Mi_Contra_Fa_by_Kaikhosru_Shapurji_Sorabji.jpg\n\nAs far as File:K k sorabji p symphony_6.png is concerned, I'm pretty sure this upload is a copyright violation. No permission was provided to OTRS/Wikimedia and Sorabji's music is still under copyright. The content of this excerpt is lifted from the Powell/Abercrombie edition (which itself is subject to copyright), which poses another problem. I already have a replacement, which contains another excerpt from the same piece, in place (File:Sorabji, Piano Symphony No. 6 manuscript, page 1.png). Let me know if this upload looks OK copyright-wise. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nConcerning File:K k sorabji p symphony_6.png, I have removed this image from the article and replaced it with File:Sorabji, Piano Symphony No. 6 manuscript, page 1.png. I don't know if the former can be salvaged or justified elsewhere on Wikipedia as a \"fair use\" image, but it's borrowing from a copyrighted edition without giving any credit and its quality is low compared to the other typeset score excerpts included in the article. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAs for File:Sorabji, Organ Symphony No. 3 manuscript, page 124 (cropped).jpg, the original file (File:Sorabji, Organ Symphony No. 3 manuscript, page 124.jpg mentions that the OTRS team have received permission via email. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nConcerning File:Mi_Contra_Fa_by_Kaikhosru_Shapurji_Sorabji.jpg, this file was uploaded by Sorabji scholar Sean Vaughan Owen (in whose oral biography of the composer several photographs are reproduced). The publisher (Porcupine Press [London]) went out of business several decades ago and the edition has been out of print for many years. The book makes mention of \"Decorations reproduced from woodcuts in William Caslon's type book, 1793\", which, according to what Mr. Owen told me in an email, refers to the illustrations of the cover. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:Ferruccio_Busoni.jpg: source link is dead; who is the author and when/where was this first published?\n\nFile:Ferruccio Busoni.jpg mentions that it was published in the US before 1925. I \"borrowed\" this image from the Busoni article and, while I know this is a WP:OSE argument, at least it is a GA and the reviewed version (which was vetted in 2016 by ) contained this image. Still, I will investigate and try to find out more on the publication history of the photograph. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nNikkimaria: I could not find additional details for this image (despite checking online sources in Italian and German), so I have replaced it with one for which details are provided at Commons. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nFile:FerruccioBusoni1913.jpg needs an author date of death, and when/where was this first published? Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nThe photograph was taken at the Varischi & Artico portrait studio. Arturo Varischi died in 1923 and Giovanni Artico died in 1930. The Commons page suggests it was first published in 1913, but I have not managed to find any confirmation for this. I have left a message at the uploader's talk page on Commons. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThe uploader has just responded to my message, saying, \"I don't know if this has been published previously, but this scan was published in 2015 by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin as public domain, where it is part of the Busoni bequest.\" Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nOkay, but we still need to nail down US status - if we can't confirm a pre-1925 publication the current tagging cannot be used. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nI'm struggling to find proof that it was published in the US before 1925, at least relying solely on online sources. Would File:Ferruccio Busoni, ca 1895.jpg work? The tagging for this image suggests there are no copyright issues involved. If that does not help either, I will probably switch to a different composer (e.g. File:Claude Debussy atelier Nadar.jpg appears to be unencumbered by US-related copyright restrictions). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nYep, that Busoni alternate would work. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nFile:Charles-Valentin_Alkan.png: needs a US PD tag, and it is quite possible for someone to have taken a photo in 1888 and survived past 100 years ago. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nFile:Alkan signature.png says this image is taken from a portrait from c. 1835 by Édouard Dubufe, who died in 1883, so it should be PD. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n@Nikkimaria: apologies for disturbing, but I just wanted to ask about the resolution of the image review for this nomination. Several points were left open here and it would be good to know what issues, if any, need to be addressed. Thank you. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nHi @Nikkimaria: Apologies if I am losing track, does that wrap up the image review? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nOnce the Busonis are swapped. Nikkimaria (talk)\n\nThank you for this; I have just made the swap. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI took part in the peer review, and liked the exchange. --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\nI'd like to discuss two minor points, being happy with the detailed article, and ready to support already: the lead and the TOC.\n\nIn the lead, I'd mention the lifelong tendency to seclusion in the very first paragraph, a summary, and begin the second with his birth and parents. Compare other composers such as Frédéric Chopin and Percy Grainger.\n\nI am happy that \"Ban\" left the TOC since the peer review, but find \"Ups and Downs\" and \"Admirers\" not a perfect replacement. How about a level 3 header \"Seclusion\", or something else to describe the full long period of withdrawing from the public, with level 4 subheaders? --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\nHi Gerda, many thanks for the support. I quite like your suggestions above; I have incorporated these into the article and hope they are to your liking. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nWill continue with the music section from where I left off at PR later today. Aza24 (talk)\n\nI suppose I have an odd definition of \"later today\" :) – was happily listening to Gulistān while reading, comments below:\n\nCan't argue with that pick! :-) Toccata quarta (talk)\n\na 1914 piano transcription – surely?\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n\"which are common in\" – perhaps something like \"which are staples of...\" or \"which are descended from...\" would be better? \"Common\" just seems ambiguous to me\n\nChanged. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAre things like \"have often been seen\" and \"what has been described as\" – coming from a source saying something like \"this is often seen\" or are these the opinions of the scholars? If the latter, I think naming the scholars would make more sense, not sure if I'm explaining this well\n\nPowell (who is used as a source there) writes, \"It is considered by many familiar with Sorabji's music...\" Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI'm assuming by traditional methods you're referring to the actual development of the fugue (which you explain afterwards), but this sentence alone Sorabji's fugues usually follow traditional methods and are the most atonal and least polyrhythmic of his works almost sounds contradictory, as atonality and polyrhythms are not \"traditional\" – perhaps rephrase to something like \"traditional methods of development\"?\n\nDone. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n\"is considered by some to be his greatest work\" – just checking – is Roberage saying some consider it his great work or that he himself does? If the latter, it would be better to spell out his name in the text\n\nRoberge writes, \"In April, 1949, he completed what is considered by some to be his greatest work...\" Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI ache for an example when reading Sorabji rarely intended for his works to be programmatic; although some of them have been described as such!\n\nI have added two examples and some details. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nWhile it may be a little odd, I would suggest linking Offenbach's article when mentioning Barcarola di Offenbach – only because you and I will see that differently than people who don't know who Offenbach is; the same could be said with Machiavellian in the book title\n\nSolved by referring to the piece by its abbreviated title. I contemplated putting a comment in brackets behind the shortened title (as links should not appear in quotations or titles), but The Tales of Hoffmann does not really establish a clear link to the Mediterranean (besides the setting of one act in Venice), which may confuse readers. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI had to look up what \"ebb\" meant – can we link to Ebb and flow?\n\nLink to Wiktionary added. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI'm unsure about this but when I got to the his largest works call for stamina and skills beyond the reach of most performers line I had kind of been waiting for it – as I know Sorabji has a reputation for having written extremely difficult music to play. I wonder if something along these lines could be briefly mentioned in the lead?\n\nAdded. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\noff the cuff may warrant a wiktionary link – at least in my mind\n\nAdded. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n\"According to early accounts\" seems a little ambiguous, are you meaning earlier biographers, the earlier accounts of people who knew him?\n\nClarified. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nafaik pipe links (like the one for Paul Sacher Stiftung are discouraged) I would stick to an ill link (Paul Sacher Stiftung [de]\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n(Not an issue) Woah, Ullen's suggests that Sorabji's 100 Transcendental Studies (1940–44) can be seen as presaging the piano music of Ligeti, Michael Finnissy and Brian Ferneyhough is exactly what I was thinking...!\n\nGreat stuff here, that's all I have\n\nMany thanks for this! Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nA very impressive article. Happy to support. Aza24 (talk)\n\nThat's gratifying to hear! Many thanks! Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAs is your first FAC I'll have to do some spotchecks below as well Aza24 (talk)\n\nRefs\n\nWould you mind if I submitted a request to get archive links for the online refs? While of course not required, I figure if we can, we may as well\n\nYou mean \"In case they go offline one day\"? No objection from my side, assuming such a request isn't considered a big favor. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nYeah it shouldn't be a big deal, since the article is so long I've had to submit a bot request. Although I'm not sure if it'll work correctly since you have to manually input that you want it to archive non-dead links (I'm not sure if the bot will do this by default) but no big deal\n\nSurely the Washington post should be included somewhere for ref 348?\n\nFixed. That was a surprising omission on my part... Toccata quarta (talk)\n\n\"Anon. (n.d.).\" is a little odd for ref 33. If it was a news article without a listed author and date it may make more sense, but as a random web page it seems unnecessary\n\nFixed all such cases. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\np./pp.s look good\n\nSeems to be all sources of reasonable reliability here\n\nGood to know! Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSources\n\nWould be nice to get more identifiers for some of these refs, Abrahams has an OCLC at world cat\n\nI have added OCLC numbers and further details for all the ones for which I could find such information. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThe Anon. (1930) is listed as by Sorabji on JSTOR. It also has a different volume number there. Would recommend adding the JSTOR=916600 or doi=10.2307/916600 – or both :) – to the ref\n\nFixed all these issues. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nOCLC for McMenamin and one for Owen\n\nDone. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nTitles should be in title case, even if in all caps originally (e.g. FEATURE REVIEW)\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nLast two Ullen refs are confusing me, they say \"In Derus, Kenneth; Ullén, Fredrik (2004)\" but don't give what the title of the publication they're \"in\" is – since the way it's formatting currently implies \"Transcendental Studies\" is the chapter. Also please an identifier of some kind (ISBN, doi, ISSn); if it's a book you can look it up on World cat for an OCLC\n\nThese relate to Derus, Kenneth; Ullén, Fredrik (2004) and Derus, Kenneth (2009); Ullén, Fredrik (2010), multi-author items that appear earlier in the sources (right after Bechert) and have ASIN identifiers. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAh I see, I would say that for ease of access you may want to move these under their coresponding items with a \"**\" indentation – but I'll leave that up to you\n\nI tried this possibility but it didn't quite appeal to me, and I can imagine readers looking for the source would expect Ullén to appear near the end of the alphabetical listing. It's probably not a major issue either way, since there are only two Ullén references in the article and it's one of the less prominent sources. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nReliability looks good\n\nThanks. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThanks for addressing the issues thus far, will get to the spot checks this weekend at some point. Aza24 (talk)\n\nNo problem! Incidentally, as far as the sources used in the article are concerned, most of the major ones can be accessed free of charge (and legally) on the internet: Abrahams can be viewed here, Roberge's book can be downloaded from the following page, Owen's oral biography is available here, etc. The only major source that does not exist in this form is Rapoport, but you can at least get page previews and check selected pages of his Sorabji book at Google Books. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSoon to do Aza24 (talk)\n\nRoberage 2020: 120, 138, 90b, 337, 215, 250, 41, 9 - good\n\nRoberage 2020: 90a not seeing \"and destroy his extant manuscripts\" or \"which comprises 1,001 pages of orchestral score\"\n\nFor the destruction of scores, the relevant statement from Sorabji is, \"All I have written since June is a matter of less than two dozen pages and it's quite on the cards that not more than that will be in existence by this time next year!\" For the page count, I have just added a ref. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nMcMenamin 16 is good\n\nmore soon\n\nOwen: 127, 257, 73, 241 – good\n\nrandom: 238, 365 - good\n\n201, I only see 5 themes at most?\n\nAs the entry for Third Organ Symphony (1949-53; 305 pp.) in the source mentions, the work has one fugue and six fugal themes. Opus clavicembalisticum and 100 Transcendental Studies have more themes, but these are spread across several independent fugal movements. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nOnce that final comment above is addressed that should do it; I have no doubts over close paraphrasing or improper citations Aza24 (talk)\n\nAwesome! Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGreat, thank you so much for your efforts with this article. Pass for source review & spotchecks Aza24 (talk)\n\nAza24: You are welcome, and many thanks for this! (And, if I may take the opportunity to say so, congratulations on bringing Portrait of a Musician to FA status.) Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAll of my concerns are resolved. (Putting this comment at the top to avoid a collapse template per the template limit problem.) SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI engaged at the peer review, so may not have much to add on the prose. Starting my section (not a musician).\n\nThe following MOS items all check out: consistent date formats, no faulty dashes/hyphens, no image caption punctuation issues, no sandwiching of images, no logical punctuation issues that I can detect (without having access to sources), good use of NBSPs, and ps and pps in order within the limits of my eyesight. No HarvRef errors. No citation overkill. External links are appropriate. One WP:WAW adjustment made.\n\nThank you. Concerning WAW, I think you meant MOS:WAW. I saw WP:WAW in your edit summary and clicked on it before checking the diff, so I was horrified to contemplate that I might have screwed up in that area. :-) Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nTypical me, sorry :) Will look in later when not iPad typing, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThere are a couple of duplicate links, which can probably be justified: they can be checked by installing, User:Evad37/duplinks-alt, but are not a concern.\n\nI think these are the ones that were discussed at the peer review (Consonance and dissonance and Part (music)), articles that cover multiple concepts, so my rationales probably remain the same. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nWorld War I is the most overlinked term on Wikipedia. World War II is also linked, not needed. Everyone knows what it is; no one is going to click on it from this article. For some odd reason, editors feel obliged to link it, not necessary.\n\nFixed. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAll good on the linking. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nOn WP:WIAFA, crit 2b, is it possible to tighten up or leave off \"and other\" here: 1.3.1 Ups and downs, musical and other\n\nWould \"Ups and downs in life and music\" work? The word \"instability\" is coming to mind but is a bit POV. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThat seems preferable to \"and other\", but as you wish, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThank you; I have changed the heading to this one. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nUnsure why you repeat page ranges in the Sources section, when they are given in the References section, but as long as you are consistent, that is fine.\n\nI followed the citation styles I was exposed to (in part in these sources), though I suppose an online encyclopedia will probably not insist on the page numbers as much as printed sources. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nNo problem here, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nDoublecheck that all citations are in ascending order, sample: Sorabji did not wish to be seen and there was just one brief shot of him waving to the departing camera crew.[101][100] --> should be 100 followed by 101. The way I check these is to do a ctrl-f on ][ to pull up and scroll through every instance of multiple citations).\n\nHa! Now this is awesome! I saw the following edit years ago and checked only the diff, which made me believe that refs with names had to precede those without them. I guess such are the limitations of not checking the outcome of a diff from the point of view of a reader, and though I often rely on the \"Preview\" function, I assumed ref order could do without that. Of course, the reason for this was that I had been careful with the ordering and repeating of the refs and use of the \"name\" parameter, so I ended up inferring a non-existent policy/practice from an existing one. :-) Anyway, fixed (and thank you). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI'm sure some clever techie person can teach me a better way to fix these :) SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nDoes the period after Ellis belong? To Dr. Havelock Ellis.—in respectful admiration, homage and gratitude ... it looks odd.\n\nThat is how it is reproduced in Roberge's book. I know the MOS allows for silent typographic emendations, but at the very least, it gives the reader some flavor of the peculiarities of Sorabji's prose (just like some of the images in the article illustrate the difficulties involved in deciphering his manuscripts). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nNo problem then, but I will add an inline comment so that future (subsequent :) editors won't inquire. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nPlease take my prose suggestions with the grain of salt (not my strength):\n\nNo overuse of the dreaded however, subsequently, overall, in total, and their ilk.\n\nI do suggest that some of the 29 uses of also might be redundant and could be reviewed. (See the writing exercises at User:Tony1)\n\nI have just removed a few that I identified as redundant; the others all appear to establish a (necessary) link to what appears earlier in the text. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAll good, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nwho set up a trust fund that freed him from the need to work ... that freed his son from the need to work ... to avoid ambiguity on \"him\"?\n\nChange \"him\" to \"his family\". The failure to refer to his wife in this passage might raise some eyebrows and WP:WAW could even be moderately applicable here (though at least there is \"that would provide his family with a life income\" later in the article). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAll set, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nMOS:CURRENT, it's always good to avoid the word \"recent\" when possible and give specific context to time frames ... but interest in it has grown in recent years --> has grown in the 21st century? has grown since year X? has grown since his death ? something for context\n\nChanged to \"since then\" (i.e. since the early 2000s). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGood, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThis is perhaps stylistic, and is not as overdone and unnecessarily cluttered as I've seen elsewhere, but is it really necessary to include the birth to death range on Trew? Thus, from the early 1910s until 1916, Sorabji studied music with the pianist and composer Charles A. Trew (1854–1929). We have a timeframe and context for when he lived already in the sentence, so does the reader really benefit from that? Examine others similar throughout ... I'm not fussed if you want to keep them, because again, they aren't creating as much unnecessary clutter as I've seen in another FAC.\n\nI have removed several instances of this but kept the years for his parents and Reginald Best (his probable partner). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGrand! SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nIn this passage:\n\n(1) Thus, from the early 1910s until 1916, Sorabji studied music with the pianist and composer Charles A. Trew (1854–1929). (2) For unknown reasons, Sorabji was not conscripted during World War I, and though he later praised conscientious objectors for their courage, there is no proof he tried to register as one. (3) Around this time, he came to be close to and exchanged ideas with the composers Bernard van Dieren and Cecil Gray, both of whom were also friends with Warlock.\n\n(1) discusses his musical associations, (2) has him not going to war, and (3) comes back to his musical associates. (2) seems out of place, and when reading, I expected (3) to somehow relate to (2), as if they had something to do with conscientious objectors. Not sure how you might fix that ... just odd. Can (2) be placed after (3) ?\n\nReordered. The documentation is a bit of a mess, but it appears Sorabji had met them by 1920 at the latest. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGood, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nUnclear ...\n\nIn connection to this, Sorabji joined the Parsi community\n\n... expat presumably, in England? And one wonders why he wasn't always part of that community, considering his father's ancestry. Maybe a better word than \"joined\" can be found ... engaged ... grew increasingly part of ... ?\n\nUnfortunately, almost no documents concerning the event or his father's involvement in it survive, but I have added a bit about how Sorabji came join the community. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGood, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nhuh ??? In the mid-1920s, he befriended the composer Erik Chisholm ... They first met in April 1930 ???\n\nThe article previously stated, \"In the mid-1920s, he began correspondence with and befriended Scottish composer Erik Chisholm\", but this was changed by GOCE. It probably sounds odd to us, but I guess it wasn't so unusual in the pre-internet age. (Roberge says, \"Besides Philip Heseltine and, later, Frank Holliday and Alistair Hinton, Erik Chisholm was Sorabji's closest friend. As with other such acquaintances, contacts were mostly epistolary.\") Anyway, would you like the previous version to be restored (and possibly reworded)? Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nSomething akin to previous better ... no need to feel constrained by GOCE, volunteers like all of us :) SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI have restored some of the earlier version and, much to my surprise, improved the flow of the passage a bit in so doing. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nRemove the ambiguity around \"he\" (lived with his family) again (father or son), also suggest sentence might be split from the previous ? ... but he did not want his son to become a musician and there is little evidence that he lived with his family.\n\nI raised \"this\" issue at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Archives/Language/2020 September 25, but not much came out of the conversation. The problem is that MOS:SAMESURNAME isn't really equipped to deal with this case (\"Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and his father, Shapurji Sorabji\"). Sorabjian literature deals with it by calling the composer Sorabji and his father Shapurji Sorabji, but it would be only a matter of time before someone complains and tries to \"correct\" the text. References to \"family\", \"wife\" and \"son\" are further complicated by Shapurji Sorabji's three marriages (of which at least one was bigamous). I would prefer to invoke WP:IAR and use \"Shapurji Sorabji\", but it's not an easy decision to make. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nsee below, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nHere, we are going backwards chronologically to talk about his father, so add \"he had returned\" ... ? ... After his marriage in 1892, he returned to Bombay ... actually, in this paragraph I am losing track of what is father and what is son, so some tightening would help.\n\nI tried to avoid ambiguity by assuming that the reader knows Sorabji was active in the field of music, and his father was an industrialist and businessman. Another thing that probably helps is that post-1932 events can be (generally) taken as referring to Sorabji, as his father was no longer alive. I may make further changes depending on your reply to my previous comment. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nWould this work? SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nA major factor in Sorabji's change of attitude was his financial situation. Sorabji's father had returned to Bombay after his marriage in 1892, where he played an important role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries. He was musically cultured and financed the publication of 14 of Sorabji's compositions between 1921 and 1931, although there is little evidence that he lived with the family and he did not want his son to become a musician. In October 1914, his father set up the Shapurji Sorabji Trust, a trust fund that would provide his family with a life income that would free them of the need to work.\n\nAbsolutely! I have changed the text according to your suggestion, though I switched \"his father set up\" to \"Sorabji's father set up\", as the former could be ambiguous. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nMaybe a BrEng thing? ...Sorabji was concerned by the impact copyright laws would have on the spread of his music ... concerned about ?\n\n[4] suggests this usage is OK in BrE. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGood, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nAwkward, don't know how to fix ... Sorabji and Holliday's friendship ended in 1979 owing to a perceived rift between them\n\nI have replaced \"owing to\" with \"because of\", which is more orthodox BrE. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nGood, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nand was allegedly supposed to go to the Pope upon his death. ... allegedly supposed feels redundant ...\n\nWould \"... [Sorabji] wore a ring that he said had belonged to a Sicilian cardinal and would go to the Pope upon his death\" work? This kind of linguistic construction pushes the boundaries of what a non-native speaker like myself can disentangle and check for ambiguities. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nYes, I like that, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI have changed the text accordingly and sneaked in \"deceased\", to avoid ambiguity as to whether Sorabji's or the cardinal's death is being discussed (in fact, the text was also ambiguous before). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAt this point, we have already been told earlier that he had a stroke and died so this is repeat info ... Sorabji suffered a mild stroke in June and died later that year; their ashes are buried beside each other --> Sorabji died later that year, and their ashes are buried beside each other.\n\nFair enough; I have removed this. Roberge makes the point clearly when he writes, \"Best's passing on 29 February 1988 was obviously a blow to Sorabji, who suffered a mild stroke in June.\" The paragraph quotes Sorabji on how highly he valued Best, so I suppose this is OK. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nah, ha ... I see that you are making a connection between his stroke and Best's passing, so perhaps that could be more clear, by bringing in the \"obviously a blow\". SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nI have added a short comment on Sorabji being impacted by Best's death and restored the passage about the stroke (as I understand your comment as saying that this information can be reintroduced into the text in that case). Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nThat's it from me: I anticipate supporting once these nitpicks are dealt with, and the sourcing/spotcheck review is complete. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nMany thanks for this and your time. I hope the issues (save for the open points above) have been addressed adequately. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nI am nitpicking now, so can be considered a Support once the sourcing checks are complete. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThank you again for your time and the (anticipated) support. Toccata quarta (talk)\n\nAll good on my end ... please ping me when Aza24 is done with the source review, so I can formally support (or the Coords can consider me a support once the source work is completed satisfactorily). SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nSupport, SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nThank you so much for this and your valuable help.
