        "text": "What if Ronald Reagan was a liberal?\n\nBeginning the year 1968, the Republican Party had no frontrunner for the nomination, with New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and former California Governor Richard Nixon facing each other, with 1964 nominee Barry Goldwater also in the race. Nixon had lost considerable ground in the polls following his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California Gubernatorial Election, while Barry Goldwater had been pressured to enter the race by the conservative faction after the assassination of George Wallace in late 1967. Rockefeller, seeing a lack of a more liberal option, entered the race after those two, quickly gaining ground in the polls and eventually having a slight lead over Nixon in early 1968.\n\nFor the Democrats, after President Johnson's withdrawal, the expectation was that Hubert Humphrey would easily win the nomination, facing only token opposition from the left, anti-war wing of the party in the form of Eugene McCarthy. Those expectations were shattered when New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of deceased President John F. Kennedy, threw his hat into the ring. Kennedy fought against McCarthy for the anti-war vote, and narrowly won the California primary. Kennedy had just finished giving a speech after winning the California primary and was walking out of the hotel when Palestinian national Sirhan Sirhan fired multiple shots at the Senator. Kennedy was grazed by 2 of the bullets, struck by one, and collapsed to the floor, while Sirhan was subdued. Kennedy was rushed to the hospital and narrowly survived, having to recover for a month. The attempted assassination of RFK brought back memories of JFK in the American public, and Kennedy rode this wave to win most of the remaining primaries.\n\nEntering the conventions, it was still up in the air as to who would win either nomination, with Rockefeller having a slight lead. In the end, Rockefeller had siphoned enough support from Nixon to win on the second ballot, and Humphrey won the Democratic nomination with the help of Johnson and the party establishment. Kennedy gave one of two incredibly notable speeches, the other one being given by Ronald Reagan, calling for party unity and publicly endorsing Humphrey for President. The vice-presidential nominations were much less contentious, with Rockefeller's endorsed pick, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, being picked for the Republicans, and North Carolina Governor Daniel Moore being nominated by the Democrats.\n\nRockefeller started the general race with a small lead, mostly due to conservative votes going overwhelmingly to Strom Thurmond, who launched an independent campaign after the nomination of Rockefeller. Rockefeller steadily increased his lead, with conservatives switching to his side after Thurmond's assassination. Rockefeller himself would face an assassination attempt, narrowly dodging it after he suddenly stopped to shake hands with an unknown supporter. Humphrey's campaign, meanwhile, went much smoother than Rockefeller's, being energized by endorsements and campaigning from big names such as Robert Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Rockefeller went into election day with a slight lead, though the majority of states were tossups at the time. The election would be called for Rockefeller at 4:29 a.m. EST, after the states of Texas and Illinois went to him by slim margins. The biggest upset of the night, however, was the fact that Humphrey narrowly won California, due to heavy campaigning from Governor Reagan. This was not enough to push him over the edge however, and Humphrey would deliver his concession speech at 11 a.m. CST.\n\n----------\n\nI'm sorry if this text is too long/ramble-y, but I just really like this idea ​\n\nIt might look broken on phones, I swear I tried but it just wouldn't take the full pictureView attachment 775985View attachment 775986\n\nAll pictures were taken from Wikipedia except for the map, which was made with EU4, the Extended Timeline mod, and the map capture tool (turns out that mods that change province borders are reflected on the map created), before being put in Paint and further edited for accuracy.\n\nThe War of 1870 [I'm taking name suggestions] was brief but major war in Europe that took place from 1870 to 1871. It was contested by Spain, Italy, Russia and the German states (which over the course of the war unified into Germany) on one side and France and Austria-Hungary on one side.\n\nThe war's origins are steeped in several long running conflicts of the states involved in the war, but its immediate powder keg started when the Spanish crown was offered to Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern, a distant, Catholic relative of the then-King of Prussia, Wilhelm I. Leopold, pressured by Prussian Minister-President Otto von Bismarck, accepted the crown and was proclaimed King Leopold I of Spain on June 30, 1870. This immediately sent the French into a furor and, engaging in his typical manner of blunt, brusque, and heavy-handed foreign policy, Napoleon III threatened war if Leopold did not renounce the Spanish throne. As Leopold was already on the throne, Spain and Prussia both rejected this, and rather than risk losing face, France declared war on both countries. The South German states had defensive treaties with Prussia and joined the war on their side, as did the Prussia-dominated North German Confederation.\n\nThe two-front war posed a problem for France; Prussian organization meant that, despite earlier French mobilization, Prussia would bear more troops more quickly, while France had to divide itself in order to defend the Pyrenees. Knowing he could not spare any troops, Napoleon III recalled his garrison in Rome at the beginning of the war, whose purpose had previously been to ensure that his erstwhile Italian allies did not invade the Papal States, but, in an attempt to preserve papal sovereignty, sent an ultimatum that any state that invaded the Papal States would be at war with France. This ultimatum caused great public furor in Italy, where protests essentially demanded the government invade Latium and seize Rome. Victor Emanuel II called the French's bluff, figuring they wouldn't open a third front when already facing two, and invaded the Papal States in August. Napoleon III, once again cornered, declared war on Italy, opening a third front to his war.\n\nNapoleon's declaration of war on Italy had massive repercussions. Increasingly fearful of the prospect of a Prussian victory in the war, having bad blood with both them and Italy, and emboldened by his defeat of a push for a more liberal reorganization of the Austrian state in 1867, Emperor Franz Josef declared war on the German states, Italy, and Spain, claiming they intended to dismember France and upset the European balance of power. This, in turn, activated the provisions of a reinsurance treaty between Prussia and Russia, who due their hatred of both Austria and Napoleon III were eager to enter the war. This turn of events seriously alarmed the British, who considered entering the war with France and Austria, but Bismarck's assurances that Belgian and Dutch neutrality would be respected and Prussia inflicting serious military defeats on France dampened Britain's motives and capacity to enter the war, and so they remained neutral.\n\nThrough Prussia and Italy were somewhat hampered by facing multiple fronts, for France and Austria these problems were far worse; the two states were not able to properly resist militarily; Austria had fallen and France asked for an armistice by March of 1871. The military victories against France and the heavy-handed attitudes of Napoleon III's foreign ministry inspired a great increase in German nationalism, which the Austrian declaration of war hardly dampened. This inspired the German states to proclaim the Empire of Germany in January 1871, with Prussian King Wilhelm I as Emperor of Germany.\n\nFollowing the end of hostilities, negotiations were held in Frankfurt, resulting in the Treaties of Frankfurt, Offenbach, and Nice. The first dealt with France and its cessions to Spain, Germany, and Russia. It was forced to hand the territories of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany and Rosellón and Oran to Spain, as well as recognize Morocco as being within Spain's sphere of influence and handing the title of protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire back to Russia, as well as paying an indemnity to all three countries.\n\nThe Treaty of Offenbach dealt with Austria and its cessions to Germany, Spain, and Russia. Galicia, Lodomeria, and Bukovina were handed over to Russia, while Bohemia was annexed into the German Empire. Austria was demoted to an archduchy, and while not directly annexed into Germany proper, Archduke Rudolf of Austria (Franz Josef, humiliated by the loss, abdicated the throne in favor of his son) maintained the title of King of Bohemia in addition to being Archduke of Austria and Margrave of Moravia [I'm making this up, I'm not sure what exactly is the title for Moravia]. In his capacity as King of Bohemia (which was also his highest title), he was subservient to Wilhelm I, essentially vassalizing Austria (with the expectation that it would be, alongside Moravia, eventually annexed into Germany proper). The rest of the lands not awarded to Italy by the Treaty of Nice were given to the new and restored Kingdom of Hungary, which would be a client state of Germany, Russia, and Italy.\n\nThe Treaty of Nice was concerned Italy and its gains. Italy annexed the Papal States; France returned Savoy and Nice to Italy and ceded Corsica as well, along with a recognition of Italian claims over Tunisia and an indemnity; and Austria granted Italy Trentino, Istria, the Austrian Littoral, Carniola, and Dalmatia (Carinthia and Styria remained a part of Austria and was eventually annexed into Germany).\n\nThe war would have significant repercussions and it is generally heralded as the end of the Concert of Europe. The grievances brought about by this war shaped the future alliance blocs of late 19th century Europe, along with the completion of the unifications of Germany and Italy. It stabilized Spain and halted its decline, while expanding Russian power. The emergence of a new Hungarian state was also an important development, and the Austrian collapse changed the Balkan landscape to one where Russia, the Ottomans, Germany, and Italy all had active interests. There were also important political developments; Napoleon III was overthrown in the course of the war, with the French Third Republic established. The republic lasted even less time than the Second and the election of 1871 saw a monarchist-majority Parliament elected, which soon restored the monarchy under Philip VII. Meanwhile, in an ironic twist of fate, Bismarck, the man who had essentially orchestrated the entire war, was forced to resign in its aftermath, as the treaties that resulted in the aftermath of the war, in particular the Treaty of Offenbach, were entirely antithetical to his foreign policy goals, leaving a unified Germany to chart a new course. These fault lines remained until they exploded in the beginning of the First World War.\n\nHow about the War of the Six Monarchs?\n\nOr War of the Four Emperors"
