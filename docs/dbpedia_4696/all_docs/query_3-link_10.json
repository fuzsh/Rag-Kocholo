        "text": "Nike is as synonymous with running footwear as tissues are with Kleenex. It goes without saying that the brand that brought us the “swoosh” has had a behemoth impact on running, from revolutionizing materials and designs to outfitting some of the most talented racers on the planet—and almost everyone else, to boot.\n\nA long brand history and tons of innovation have left Nike with lots of shoes to offer—and picking which is right for you can be a daunting task.\n\nFor that reason, we’ve tested and reviewed all of the best Nike running shoes to bring you eight elite options in different categories. These include our top pick, the best-selling Nike Pegasus 41, as well as the Zoom Fly 5 for distance running and the Invincible 3 for superior recovery. Here, we’ve gathered our top picks for the best Nike running shoes.\n\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\n\nForbes Vetted contributor Heather Mayer Irvine, who authored this piece, has been running for more than two decades and has been testing running shoes for nearly as long. As a former food and nutrition editor for Runner’s World and the author of The Runner's World Vegetarian Cookbook, she keeps a pulse on the latest releases in sneaker technology to ensure readers are getting the most up-to-date information and recommendations.\n\nForbes Vetted contributor Hayley Helms oversaw the editing of this guide. With over a decade of experience testing and reviewing running shoes, her knowledge of materials and construction runs wide and deep. As a runner herself, she brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table.\n\nYou can’t expect to run a 5K in a new pair of shoes and assume you know how they’ll perform. When testing running shoes, including the Nikes on this list, it's important to put in significant mileage to really get a feel for their performance. That’s why we ran in the Pegasus 41, Vaporfly 3 and Pegasus Trail 4, among others, to evaluate comfort, support and responsiveness. This thorough approach helps us gather a wide range of perspectives, making sure runners of all backgrounds and experience levels can find the best Nike running shoes for their needs.\n\nHow We Chose The Best Nike Running Shoes\n\nThese are the Nike running shoes that we reach for on weekend distance runs, easy training runs around the block and speed runs at the local track. Mayer Irvine has worn Nikes on and off for years, and she keeps a pulse on the running shoe industry to stay abreast of new models, materials and designs.\n\nRunning is a sport that covers everything from different terrains to varying intensities and distances. Each runner has their own goals and preferences, and even if you're focusing on a specific distance or race, you need to mix up your training. Speed work, for example, is essential for long-distance runners because it boosts running economy and makes those long miles feel easier at a quicker pace. The same goes for trail runners who hit the roads or sprinters who take on long distances. The top runners in any field make sure to mix things up. With that in mind, we've picked a Nike shoe for every kind of run you might have in your training plan.\n\nWhat To Look For In The Best Nike Running Shoes\n\nActivity Level\n\nA daily trainer is going to look and feel pretty different from a hardcore racing shoe. Before you invest in a pair of Nike running shoes, consider how you plan on using the shoe. Do you want a Nike running shoe that will serve you well for 20 miles a week? Do you need a running shoe that doubles as an everyday shoe? Or are you looking for a top-of-the-line super shoe for racing that will help you nab that long-sought-after PR?\n\nRacing shoes, like the Vaporfly 3, are going to be incredibly lightweight, and the foam will likely not last more than a single training cycle (depending on various factors). Racing shoes with carbon fiber plates are also not intended to be everyday running shoes; the continuous help from the plate can cause injury in some runners. Meanwhile, distance shoes like the Zoom Fly 5 offer plush support to absorb repetitive impact; they’re comfy, but you probably wouldn’t wear them for a fast race.\n\nCushion\n\nNike uses two types of foam cushioning in its running shoes.\n\nThe ZoomX foam is light, soft and incredibly responsive, debuting in the brand’s original super shoes. According to the company, ZoomX—a polyether block amide (PEBA) foam—delivers 85% energy return, which is why it’s found in the company’s racing shoes.\n\nThe ReactX foam is a newer iteration of the brand’s foam. It launched in July 2023 in the Infinity RN4. The foam is a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), designed for everyday training. According to Nike, the ReactX foam has a lower carbon footprint than its predecessor.\n\nFit And Comfort\n\nAs with shopping for all running shoes, fit is going to be the most important factor. After all, if the shoe isn’t comfortable, you’re not going to want to wear it, and it can cause pain, chafing and even injury if you do.\n\nNike is known to run a little narrow and a little short. For some runners, merely sizing up a full or half size can alleviate this, but others might have to try another brand. For example, Mayer Irvine never had much luck with the Nike fit until she tried the Vaporfly 3; although some say the upper isn’t flexible and can be restrictive, she found that it let her foot splay out more than other Nike models she’s tried in the past.\n\nA Guide To Nike’s Proprietary Materials\n\nRunning shoes are comprised of three main components: the upper, midsole and outsole. Each brand will use different blends of materials to create unique running shoes, and many brands have proprietary materials no one else has access to—Nike included. While the outsoles are fairly straightforward, where Nike’s innovation truly shines is in the upper. When you’re shopping for which Nike suits you best, keep these materials in mind.\n\nUpper Materials\n\nThe upper is the top portion of the running shoe that covers the top and sides of the foot, and includes the laces. Nike has a wide selection of upper materials, each formulated to cater to specific desires, including breathability, waterproofing and durability. Flywire and Flyknit technology are found across Nike’s roster; Flywire is lightweight and offers a snug and secure fit, thanks to thin filaments, aka “wires” that hold the foot in place. Flyknit is an ultralight knitted yarn that is lighter, more flexible and stronger than many competitors’ materials.\n\nMidsole Materials\n\nThe midsole is where the magic happens—or where you’re the most aware of the magic. Nike has made a name for itself thanks to its proprietary midsole fabrications, which include the mega-popular ZoomX, React and CushIon.\n\nZoomX is Nike’s highest performing foam, and is lively and responsive underfoot. It can be found in the Invincible 3 and a selection of other shoes on this list. React is the steady counterpart to ZoomX’s playfulness, and is typically found in everyday trainers. CushIon is an older midsole material that can still be found in the Pegasus line, but one that isn’t as prominent in the line-up as new materials have emerged.\n\nCarbon Fiber\n\nNike was the first brand on the planet to popularize the use of carbon fiber plates in its racing shoes, essentially changing the entire landscape of race-ready shoes over the last seven years. In 2017, Nike introduced the concept of a carbon fiber plate in the Nike Zoom Vaporfly 4%. In 2018, Eliud Kipchoge wore them in the Berlin Marathon.\n\nSo what’s so special about carbon fiber? In running shoes, a thin carbon fiber plate transfers energy along the foot so that rather than feeling the sensation of running downhill upon impact, runners experience the sensation of being propelled forward with each stride. The carbon fiber is made from thin, crystalline filaments of carbon and is five times stronger than steel, with double the amount of stiffness.\n\nAir Zoom Units\n\nAnother proprietary development from Nike, Air Zoom units are small, low-profile Air units with tensile threads inside. The threads expand and contract, similar to a trampoline, and provide a similar sensation underfoot. The purpose of the Air Zoom units is to bring a layer of speed and responsiveness, or “pop” to runs both short and long.\n\nDoes Nike Have Good Running Shoes?\n\nSome of the best runners in the world wear Nike running shoes. The company trailblazed the running shoe industry and has been a leader in running shoes since the 1960s. A good running shoe is subjective and depends on the wearer’s preferences. Nike running shoes are a favorite among runners thanks to their reputation and performance. The brand created the first super shoe, using incredibly lightweight foam and a carbon fiber plate that significantly improve performance.\n\nHow Often Should I Replace My Nike Running Shoes?\n\nTypically, running shoes should be replaced every 300 to 500 miles, depending on factors like your running style, body weight and the surfaces you run on. Signs that it's time for a new pair include noticeable wear on the outsole, reduced cushioning and discomfort during runs. Keep in mind that some Nike running shoes, like the Vaporfly 3, are designed solely for racing and should not be worn every day because the foam breaks down very quickly.\n\nOther Running Stories To Shop"
