        "text": "Adidas has a long history of excellence within the running world that continues to this day. Quite often, you’ll see podium pairs of Adios Pro on the feet of some of the top marathoners in the world. That dedication to innovation and performance is not relegated to the pros– it all trickles down across the line and shows up in some of our favorite running shoes, period.\n\nOf course, you’re probably reading this because you want to know which shoes are best for your own running. While all our picks are subjective, we have actually run in all of these models, so we’re able to give you hands-on (er… feet on) feedback about each one. Point being– we feel confident that this list will give you a good idea of what may work for you if you’re looking for a running shoe with the three stripes.\n\nWhether you’re a “3 miles every other day” type runner or a hardcore “always marathon training” one, there’s something on this list for you.\n\nFor reference, this list is in alphabetical order and includes everything from the performance Adizero line to the more everyday wear of the Ultraboost Light.\n\nQuestions or comments? Leave them below and we’ll do our best to get back to you.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quicker daily trainer running shoe with some premium components from Adidas, then you may want to say hello to the Adios 8. We’ll admit that we haven’t actually reviewed the latest version of the Adios, but all signs point towards it heading in the right direction. Like its predecessor, the Adios 8 packs a dual-density midsole with Adidas’ top-tier Lightstrike Pro in the forefoot and a sturdier, more reliable layer of Lightstrike 2.0 through the rest of the foot. On the run, the shoe strikes a balance between more affordable shoes like the SL and the workhorse of the Boston 12.\n\nWe’re back on the Boston train (we’ll get there in a minute), but the Adios has been filling the Boston-shaped hole in our hearts almost perfectly over the last couple of years. While the Lightstrike keeps it a bit firm, the Lightstrike Pro in the forefoot gives some bounce, while the EnergyTorsion Rods provide the responsiveness needed from a faster shoe. It also helps that this is the lightest shoe in the Adidas lineup outside of the premium race day shoes.\n\nWhen it comes to race day, this is the pinnacle of Adidas performance. One of our favorite race shoes that money can buy, the Adios Pro 3 features a high stack, Peba-based midsole that is ultra bouncy without being too soft or too firm. Carbon-fiber EnergyRods (proprietary to Adidas) provide a snappy propulsion off the toe and through the stride. The shoe is also surprisingly stable for a race day running shoe, which is always a bonus.\n\nThe upper on the shoe is breathable and light, though the lacing system takes a lot of work to dial in. But once it’s dialed in, you’re good to go. (We would recommend going a half size down from your normal sizing in this shoe as it does run long.)\n\nMoving onto the outsole, the Continental rubber provides one of the best and stickiest grips in the game, ensuring you won’t slip through all those water station stops out on the course, while giving you confidence around the corners. Read full Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 Review\n\nOh, baby, the Boston is back. We were pretty vocal about how much we hated the last two versions of Adidas’ do-it-all trainer, and now we’ll probably be just as loud about the fact that it’s been fixed. What’s the secret, you ask? Well, quite simply, Adidas has fixed everything we hated about the midsole — simple as that. The updated Boston 12 now has more Lightstrike Pro in the forefoot, a softer formulation of Lightstrike in the heel, and a reworked set of EnergyRods sandwiched in between.\n\nGranted, this isn’t just a brand-new version of the shoe that it was before, either. Adidas widened the forefoot, which gives it more inherent stability, while the Energy Rods keep you bouncing right along. You get a full helping of Continental rubber across the outsole, too, which is welcome protection from the often slippery boards of the Baltimore promenade.\n\nRobbe equated the Boston 12 to the Adios Pro Lite, which kind of makes sense when you think about it. This shoe has more stack than the Takumi Sen 10 and, outside of the Lightstrike 2.0 in the heel, offers a very similar makeup to the premium racer. Meg also compared it to a supertrainer given the presence of Adidas’ peba-based Lightstrike Pro, but this is one that you can (legally) race in.\n\nWell, this might be one of our more controversial picks for the best Adidas running shoes, but only because it’s so different from what we expected. When we first tried on the Prime X2 Strung more than a year ago at The Running Event, we thought it was going to change the game. It was all that and more — literally.\n\nBy the time it got to us, it felt like we were running in a completely different shoe. Sure, the Prime X2 Strung still has two carbon-infused plates and three layers of Lightstrike Pro foam, but they’re a bit heavier and a bit less stable than we initially experienced. However, the Prime X2 Strung still seems to work like a dream for some members of our team, so we can’t rule it out for everyone.\n\nOh, and the 3D-printed, or Strung, upper is still a treat. Using athlete data, Adidas has mapped out and programmed different fiber properties thread by thread so that you get an upper that’s designed for support, flex, and breathability, all in one piece of material. It fits much better than Adidas’ more traditional uppers and doesn’t seem to run quite as long, either.\n\nAll that tech and premium-grade construction is still gonna cost ya to the tune of $300. They say all you need is a pair of shoes to run, but in this case, you may need a second mortgage. Just make sure you can still return this one in case it doesn’t quite work for you…\n\nWhile we can’t believe we’re saying a $120 shoe is a budget trainer, that’s exactly where the SL lands. It still falls into the Adizero line of performance shoes, but this is the go-to shoe for either a high-school kid or someone who’s starting out running and wants a lightweight daily trainer that can transition to a tempo shoe without breaking the bank.\n\nThe midsole is Lightstrike, but it seems softer than the previous SL20. Additionally, a puck of Lightstrike Pro sits under the ball of the foot, allowing for a bit extra bounce on toe-off.\n\nOverall, we were kinda surprised at this shoe and how much we liked it, especially for the low expectations we had for the Lightstrike midsole. If you’re on a budget and want something that gives you a taste of the higher end stuff, then the SL may be right up your alley. Read full Adidas Adizero SL review\n\nAlright, let’s get a little muddy. We’ve touched on a bunch of Adidas road running shoes so far, but the Terrex line is just as well-regarded when it comes to the trails. Robbe put plenty of miles into the Agravic Speed Ultra while training for the HAT 50k, and he’s got plenty of thoughts on the trail racer.\n\nIt’s not necessarily a flashy trail shoe, preferring one bold color for the upper instead of Nike’s louder line of trail shoes, but man, it’s a good-looking runner. Robbe pointed out that Adidas’ mesh is lightweight and form-fitting but still offers surprisingly good lockdown, given the lack of overlays. Think of it as fitting like the Takumi Sen, but with a bit more structure around the heel. Part of that excellent lockdown comes from sawtooth laces that you’ll immediately recognize if you’ve run in a recent racer from Nike, Asics, and plenty of others.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed Ultra is the fact that it’s stable — something that trail racing shoes often struggle with. It has a wider forefoot with EnergyRods running through it like metatarsals, giving your toes another set of toes to ride along.\n\nLast, but certainly not least (I’m actually wearing them on my feet as I type this), the Ultraboost Light is one of the newest shoes from Adidas, featuring an all-new iteration of Boost.\n\nWhile Boost midsole foam is a legend in the game, it was long overdue for some improvement. Enter Light Boost, a new generation of Boost that’s 30% lighter and boasts a 10% lower carbon footprint. Throw in 50% Parley Ocean Yarn and 50% recycled polyester in the upper, and you have a shoe you can feel good about while looking good in. It’s also much lighter than the standard Ultraboost.\n\nWhich may be our favorite thing about the shoe– it looks so good. The lockdown of the Primeknit+ upper is great as well and is super comfortable both on the run and as casual wear. Speaking of on the run– it doesn’t offer the same comfort levels of the Solarglide, but for the “three miles or less” runner, the shoe works. Just be aware that the upper is a bit warm, so your feet will get toasty on the run come summer time.\n\nAnd though this hits a little hard at that $190 price point, the aesthetic alone may justify the price tag.\n\nAlright, so this one might not feel like a fair pick for most runners — heck, only Thomas has a pair in the office. That said, it’s worth a mention because it is hands-down the best running shoe that Adidas has ever made. The Adios Pro Evo 1 weighs next to nothing, yet it packs all of the technology that Adidas can fit into one racing shoe, complete with a price to match.\n\nSomehow, the Adios Pro Evo 1 is a whopping 40% lighter than the Adios Pro 3 but still comes in with a barely legal 39 mm of foam in the heel and a new non-compression formula of Lightstrike Pro. As you might expect, the shoe is pretty light on the padding, since every last scrap of fabric and foam adds precious grams, so make sure you have a pair of socks that you really like underneath.\n\nAdidas won’t tell us just how the non-compression midsole is made, but we have our guesses. By not compressing the foam, it’s able to hold more air in the midsole, which, in turn, maintains more bounce underfoot. Of course, that means it’ll compress over time, which is why you can probably only count on the Pro Evo 1 for a precious few miles before it dies."
