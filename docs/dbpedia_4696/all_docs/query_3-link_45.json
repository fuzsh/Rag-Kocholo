        "text": "What's your running shoe rotation look like?\n\nDo you...\n\nWear one pair of shoes until you‚Äôre using duct tape and superglue to hold them together\n\nHave a major shoe addiction always on the hunt for the newest shoe tech, colorway, or fit\n\nOr maybe you're a little of both.\n\nüëâIf you run at least 2-3 times per week with any regularity, you could benefit from a running shoe rotation.\n\nüëüüëüWith a couple pairs of running shoes in your closet:üëüüëü\n\nYou‚Äôre less likely to get injured (according to this study, up to 39% less likely)\n\nYour shoes will last longer, and...\n\nYou can tailor your shoe choice to your daily goals.\n\nüëüWant to learn how to create your own running shoe rotation?\n\nKeep reading to get to the heart of what a running shoe rotation is, why having one is important, and how you can create your own!\n\nMuch like a golfer wouldn‚Äôt show up to a course without their arsenal of clubs, each of which has a purpose for the game, a running shoe rotation functions in a similar manner.\n\nThink about it this way...\n\nA running shoe rotation allows you to match your daily run goals to a specific pair of shoes.\n\nA basic shoe rotation consists of at least three pairs of running shoes:\n\nDaily trainers with support and cushioning: these shoes go the distance with you on long, easy runs.\n\nSpeedwork shoes. Snappy, responsive, lightweight, plateless shoes for workouts\n\nRacing shoes. Race day and the occasional speedwork shoe: supershoes are the go-to choice for racing these days, but it‚Äôs important to know when and where to use them!\n\nThe Daily Trainer is the the reliable workhorse for most of your running.\n\nThese running shoes might not be flashy, but you will spend a lot of time in them, so it‚Äôs vital to pick one with which you‚Äôre compatible.\n\nDaily trainers on the market today usually cater to comfort, but there are a few other characteristics you might consider when choosing a daily running shoe.\n\nQualities to look for in a daily trainer:\n\nDurability\n\nSupport\n\nFunctionality\n\nAffordability\n\nSome popular daily trainers:\n\nBrooks Ghost 15\n\nAltra Rivera 3\n\nAdidas Solarglide 6\n\nHoka Clifton 9 (my personal favorite‚Äìsee reviews here)\n\nMizuno Wave Rider 27\n\nNew Balance Fresh Foam 880 v13\n\nNike Air Zoom Pegasus 40\n\nSaucony Ride 16\n\nDaily trainers should be able to take a beating, since they do most of the work in the scheme of a weekly running schedule.\n\nLongevity. Industry standards suggest runners retire their shoes after 500 miles, but some trainers will last much longer than that, while others will fall short of this benchmark.\n\nPrice. It‚Äôs best to look into daily trainer shoes that will give you at least 300 miles of wear, because let‚Äôs face it, shoes are pricey! Luckily, the more shoes you have to rotate through, the longer each pair will last.\n\nWear & tear. The variability across footwear durability depends on the shoe materials, a runner‚Äôs wear patterns, and running shoe care/maintenance.\n\nMeasure performance. It‚Äôs not a bad idea to track the miles you‚Äôre putting on shoes using Strava or another gear tracking software (most watches have apps with gear tracking capabilities too).\n\nNot sure how to determine if your shoes are ready to retire?\n\nüëâCheck out Evan‚Äôs article on when to replace running shoes!\n\nDaily trainers offer a wide range of support options.\n\nWhat does ‚Äúsupport‚Äù actually mean when we talk about running shoes?\n\nAll running shoes have some level of support even if they are advertised as ‚Äúneutral.\"\n\nBut not all offer stability or motion control for overpronation/supination (read Lucie‚Äôs article about these foot types to learn more).\n\nFor runners who are putting in a lot of high volume training, are prone to injury or impaired recovery, or those who simply want more options, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have a few different daily trainers in the arsenal.\n\nFrom choosing a shoe that will treat sore and heavy legs with kindness...\n\nTo shoes that will challenge your foot and ankle strength and stability...\n\nYour daily trainer selection can range from plush and cloud-like to proprioceptively rich, barefoot experiences.\n\nBefore you purchase a minimalist or maximalist shoe:\n\nTake a look at the shoe‚Äôs specs including heel to toe drop (how much higher your heel is than your forefoot once inside the shoe)\n\nAnd stack height (how much shoe material is between the ground and your foot)\n\nA minimalist shoe is designed to emulate barefoot running while offering various degrees of underfoot protection.\n\nTypically, a minimalist shoe will have low (less than 5mm) or no heel to toe drop, a roomy toe box that allows natural toe splay, and a low stack height.\n\nThe lower a shoe‚Äôs heel-to-toe drop, the more likely you are to strike the ground on your forefoot or midfoot instead of the heel.\n\nThis shifts the workload of each stride further down your kinetic chain, away from the hips and knees, and into the lower leg and ankle.\n\nWhile minimalist shoes do not work for everyone and they require a gradual introduction into a shoe rotation, some runners have anecdotally found minimalist footwear or barefoot running to be helpful in staving off injury.\n\nIn a 2014 systematic review, several physical therapists examined studies on barefoot and minimalist footwear for running.\n\nThey couldn‚Äôt make any definitive conclusions about the risks or benefits of such footwear, but they did acknowledge that running barefoot decreases max ground reaction forces, ground contact time, and stride length.\n\nIt is vital to consider your injury history as a runner before immediately jumping into a minimalist shoe, so tread carefully and do your research, bearing in mind that what works for your running buddies or an elite you follow on social media may not work for you, and that is OK!\n\nSome popular minimalist shoes:\n\nAltra Escalante 3\n\nMerrel Vapor Glove 5\n\nTopo Athletic ST-4\n\nVivobarefoot Primus Lite III\n\nXero Shoes Prio Minimalist Running Sneaker\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are the highly cushioned maximalist shoes that feel like a warm (yet breathable) hug on your sore feet and tired legs.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre trying on maximalist shoes, expect them to be rather plush, have tons of underfoot protection and comfortable upper material, a higher stack, and generally, a higher heel-to-toe drop (10-12 mm or more).\n\nHigher drop daily trainers will take the load off your ankles and lower leg, making them a better choice for runners struggling with plantar fasciitis, Achilles, or posterior tibial tendonitis.\n\nPopular daily trainers with loads of cushioning:\n\nAsics Gel Nimbus 25\n\nBrooks Glycerin 20\n\nAltra Torin 7\n\nAdidas Ultraboost Light\n\nHoka Bondi 8\n\nMizuno Wave Sky 6\n\nNew Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v12\n\nNike Air Zoom Vomero 16\n\nOn Cloudstratus 2.0\n\nSaucony Triumph 20\n\nSince daily trainers are your foundational shoe, you‚Äôll likely go through several pairs throughout your running career.\n\nFor example, If you run an average of 20 miles per week in your daily trainers, and you get 500 miles out of them, you will probably have to replace them at least once or twice every year!\n\nDo the math and that‚Äôs a lot of money to be spending each year‚Äìon a worthy investment of course.\n\nDaily trainers usually start at $110 and quickly rise in price depending on the brand, materials used, and special shoe features or customization.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to save money on running shoes is to buy previous years‚Äô models and seek clearance sales at your local running store or on 3rd party retailer websites.\n\nWebsites with notoriously good deals on running shoes:\n\nRunning Warehouse Clearance\n\nRoad Runner Sports Outlet\n\nRelay Run Co\n\nREI Running Shoe Deals\n\nDick‚Äôs Running Footwear Clearance\n\nFleet Feet Clearance\n\nWith a daily workhorse or two (or three..or more) on your shoe rack, it‚Äôs time to seek out some fast shoes that will help you fly through your speed workouts.\n\nWhile you‚Äôll only be using this shoe once or twice per week depending on your training schedule, finding a shoe that simultaneously provides enough ground feel and protection without sacrificing too much durability is key.\n\nExpect to see more wear on these shoes than you would a daily trainer since speedwork shoes are generally made with less (and lighter) material, though they are usually more resilient than race-specific shoes with carbon plates.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been a part of the running world for any length of time, you‚Äôve probably heard the term ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù thrown around to describe a workout or racing shoe.\n\nBut what does that actually mean?\n\nResponsiveness, as defined by the Doctors of Running Podcast (episode #126), is the ability of a shoe to respond to load.\n\nA shoe‚Äôs responsiveness is the product of several construction characteristics including:\n\nFoam resiliency (how much the midsole foam bounces back after compression)\n\nShoe stiffness\n\nShoe geometry\n\nOutsole material, and...\n\nA runner‚Äôs individual biomechanics\n\nWith all of these factors determining how much a shoe gives back to you in stride, responsiveness is highly subjective.\n\nA speedwork shoe might be advertised as responsive, but once you put it on your foot and try to hit your paces in a workout, you might find that it‚Äôs too soft or has an odd rocker shape that doesn‚Äôt work with your stride length and cadence.\n\nThe opposite may be true as well; more responsiveness is not always better‚Äìparticularly if you struggle with lower leg injuries.\n\nIt might take a few tries to find your best fit when it comes to a responsive speedwork shoe, but it‚Äôs worth it when the glass slipper finally fits!\n\nA single running shoe can weigh anywhere from 6-11 oz depending on the shoe size and construction.\n\nWhen you double the weight for a pair of running shoes, that‚Äôs 12-22 oz of extra weight you‚Äôre carrying.\n\nOn the low end, it‚Äôs the equivalent of a Campbell‚Äôs tomato soup can; as the shoes get heavier, you‚Äôre up to the weight of a standard NBA basketball!\n\nFor your daily trainers and recovery run shoes, some extra shoe weight can be beneficial as it will encourage slower, easier paces. Heavier shoes typically offer more cushioning and stability too.\n\nHowever, a speedwork shoe should not feel like an ankle weight! The more your speed work shoe can feel like an extension of your foot, the better.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre shopping for the perfect speed work shoes...\n\nThe weights listed on each product description (unless otherwise noted) are based on the average men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs shoe size‚Äì10.5 and 8.5 respectively.\n\nIn general, running shoes are considered lightweight when they weigh less than 9 oz for men and 7.5 oz for women.\n\nWith lightweight running shoes, there are certainly tradeoffs.\n\nKeeping in mind the intended distances for your speedwork shoes can be helpful for making the decision as to whether or not those extra ounces and underfoot protection are worth shedding for speed.\n\nThe final tool in a runner‚Äôs shoe rotation is the carbon-plated racing shoe AKA supershoes!\n\nWhile they are not a necessity, plated racing shoes are surging in popularity.\n\nIf you‚Äôve run a road race lately, you‚Äôve probably seen them on the startline...\n\nFlashy, lightweight, highly cushioned racing shoes that make the spring in runners‚Äô strides seem effortless.\n\nNo longer just for the professionals, plated racing shoes are widely available to runners of all abilities.\n\nWhile these shoes are impressive feats of engineering that can help some runners achieve personal bests, they should be treated as a tool used periodically rather than as daily trainers.\n\nEarly research on carbon-plated super shoes doesn‚Äôt show conclusive evidence to support greater injury risk, but it also doesn‚Äôt provide evidence to show they are entirely safe either.\n\nWhat we do know is that...\n\nCarbon-plated supershoes change your loading patterns and forces as you run.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious about these new technologies, but not sure if they are right for you, check out this video from Doctors of Running on how to gradually introduce your body to super shoes.\n\nCarbon-Plated Racing Shoe Factors to Consider:\n\nPrice\n\nDesign: Plates, Rods, and Foam\n\nStability\n\nPopular plated racing shoes:\n\nNike Vaporfly 3\n\nHoka Rocket X2\n\nSaucony Endorphin Elite\n\nSaucony Endorphin Pro 3\n\nAsics Magic Speed 3"
