        "text": "It’s been about three weeks since these guys first made an appearance on this blog.\n\nI have been wanting a new pair of trainers to try pretty much since I completed the Nice-Cannes Marathon in November in my Nike Free 3.0 v4s. As mentioned in my previous post, I’m not as wedded to my v4s as I was to the v3s. Which is a huge shame, as I did love my v3s.\n\nI quite enjoyed the experience of stripping down my trainers from my old Nike Bowermans to the Nike Free series. I loved how light my feet suddenly felt, but also how much more stable I was, being closer to the ground. It clearly also helped that the Nike Free 3.0 v3s were one of THE most comfortable shoes I have ever worn – stepping into one is like having your feet wrapped in a duvet. It is comfortable enough to be worn without socks in my opinion.\n\nI wanted to get that feeling again, about being excited about my trainers and experiencing a new sensation when running. I therefore decided to take a step further down the minimalist shoe path and opted for a more stripped down trainer when choosing my next pair of shoes.\n\nThere weren’t all that many minimalist trainers to choose from in the UK, if the Vibram Five Fingers series are excluded from the options (I’m not ready for barefoot running just yet!). Whilst I do quite like the look and design of the Brooks PureProject range, I felt that even their most flexible Pure shoe was not as flexible as that of the Nike Free 3.0s. The other brand I considered was Newton. I love their bright, colourful designs (yes, I do choose trainers based on how they look, so sue me) but let’s face it, even their MV2s can’t be called a minimalist shoe based on the amount of padding they have underfoot.\n\nThe other running shoe brand I’ve always quite fancied trying was New Balance. I did a quick search on their UK website and lo and behold, came across the Minimus Zeros. It seemed to fit all of the pre-requisites I was looking for, so I went to my nearest retailer, tested it on their treadmill and returned home with a new pair of black and turquoise trainers.\n\nAfter having tried them on a variety of runs, my thoughts are as follows:\n\nWhat I liked\n\nAttached tongue – shoe tongues that move to one side really annoy the hell out of me. I don’t know why and I know it shouldn’t, but it does. It just doesn’t feel right. That’s another reason why I love the Nike Frees, they have no tongues! Whilst the Minimus Zeros don’t wholly secure the tongue in place like the Frees, they do ensure that one side remains connected to the rest of the shoe so that the slippery sucker has no room for manoeuvre (manoeuvring?). Whatever, you get the point.\n\nGood fit – shoes in general never tend to fit me all that well. I am in between standard sizes and have relatively small feet. I found the fit of the Minimus Zeros superb however – a good snug fit around the sides and heel to “hold everything in”, with ample room in the toe box to allow natural foot movement when running.\n\nHigh flexibility but with good “grippiness” – whilst not as flexible as the Frees, these shoes do allow your feet to move the way they want to move. There’s just the right balance on the padding underfoot – enough to give you the confidence to run in whatever terrain you want, but not so much that you can’t “feel” the ground beneath you. The soles are covered in Vibram rubber providing a tough layer with good grip for your more rugged runs. It also features a pod design which should enhance traction on certain surfaces. Note that the outside midfoot area and toe area have been made with reinforced rubber as those are the points which should be in most contact with the ground.\n\nReally light-weight – these shoes weigh in at about 180 grams. That’s a really light shoe! Every decision around the design of this shoe seems to have been made with the aim of making this shoe as light as possible. The covering is made of a light mesh fabric making it really breathable and flexible.\n\nZero drop from heel to toe – it certainly lives up to the “Zero” in its name. Whilst it is not the easiest of shoes to run it, it is definitely what I am looking for as I continue to strengthen the muscles in my feet. I can definitely feel the additional effort that my feet have to work at when transitioning to these shoes. It is a lot more than what I felt when I first moved from cushioned shoes to the Nike Free 3.0s.\n\nWhat I would’ve liked\n\nSofter inner lining – some runners apparently run sock-less in these shoes. I don’t know how though, because my feet already feel slightly sore from all the rubbing, even with running socks on! I’ve probably just been spoilt rotten by the duvet-like Nike Frees and need to harden my feet back up again.\n\nSlightly softer and lower heel back – heel back? I don’t know what the technical term is for this part of the shoe but I am basically talking about the bit that the back of your foot rests against. I found the “heel back” to be slightly too hard, which I had to alleviate by wearing running-specific socks with a cushioned back. My socks also have an additional cushioned “flap” at the top to stop blisters forming from continued rubbing against shoes with high, hard backs, also relevant in this case. Again, probably due to my spoiled feet.\n\nFor it to somehow make my calves look less big – yes, I realise how dumb this sounds, but no, I will not retract it. I think that the relatively smaller size of the shoes (compared to other shoes) make my calves look even more ginormous than usual. And yes, I do realise that this is not New Balance’s fault and that they can’t do much about it."
