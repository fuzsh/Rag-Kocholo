        "text": "When I first heard of the Newton Gravity+, I wondered what it was? Was it the Gravity 10 or 11, just renamed? It turns out the Gravity+ is a lighter and more advanced Newton. In fact, it’s the shoe that won the Badwater 135 Ultra. Woah. Amazingly, it was even chosen over carbon plated footwear!\n\nIt’s also designed around a more renewable platform and is made to biodegrade faster. Like all Newton running shoes, the Newton Gravity+ uses the Newton signature lug system. If you’ve realized the lug system isn’t for you, then the Newton Gravity Plus will be the same. Those who have read my blog for a while know, Newtons were my first ever “real running shoe.” I went through 17 pairs of Gravities through the years (over maybe five years?). Since then, I’ve come and gone with Newton and usually have one of their trainers in my rotation.\n\nNewton Gravity+ Quick Stats:\n\nWeight: 8.6 oz\n\nHeel to Toe Drop: 3 mm\n\nCost: $190\n\nNewton Gravity+ Fit:\n\nThe first several years of Newtons were composed of crazy colored (some called them “clown colored” uppers. It needs to be said that Newtons have gotten a lot better to look at throughout the years, and the Gravity+ is no exception.\n\nDespite the crazy colors, the uppers of Newtons have always been high quality. Even before that was a thing, Newton used 3-D engineered mesh. It’s a relatively tight-knit mesh but still breathes well. It’s light, comfortable, and supportive. What else do you need?\n\nYou need more things, of course! The Newton Gravity Plus is also constructed of the most durable recycled materials. Newton goes far as removing more than four water bottles from the waste chain per pair. Plus, it is biodegraded 75% faster than standard shoes. If you know me, you know I’m always looking for more environmentally friendly running items.\n\nIn my opinion, the best running shoe uppers disappear off your feet, and the Newton Gravity+ does just that. I haven’t had any hot spots or anything bothering me that shouldn’t. Not much more to say, and that is a good thing.\n\nTypically I wear between a women size 10-11 wide. Newtons aren’t made wide, and the 10.5 in the Newton Gravity+ fits well. Newtons usually have a wider toebox, and I see that as the case here too.\n\nNewton Gravity+ Ride:\n\nIf you’ve never run in Newtons before, it’s better to start slowly. I mean really slowly, because they work your calves differently than any other brand. If you flip them over, you’ll see a series of lugs that help propel you forward. These lugs, combined with the 3 mm drop, affect your calves. Rushing into running in them can cause calve problems. Your calves will probably be sorer the first time you ever lace up a pair of Newtons.\n\nThe Newton Gravity Plus uses different technology than previous versions of the Gravity. It has both “NRG+ foam” and “XPS+ Playing System,” So what does this mean? This new foam is an update to make the Newton Gravity+ more modern and competitive with other trainers.\n\nWhat is the NRG+ Foam? It’s a biodegradable foam that feels more modern. Sometimes Newton could feel a little heavy, and this NRG+ foam makes the shoe pop. It reminds me a lot of Brooks’s BioMoGo DNA.\n\nWhat is the XPS+ plate? Newton Gravity+ uses lugs that are air-filled chambers. This makes the shoe feel responsive, but honestly, it doesn’t feel different from previous models of the Newton Gravity. Newtons are designed to react like a spring and help propel you forward so you’ll feel less tired the longer you go. After running for years in them, I can say this is not “just hype,” and like a carbon plated shoe, you do feel less tired at long distances.\n\nDurability and Traction: Usually, these are similar, but in the Newton Gravity+, they are not. The durability of most Newtons is 1.5X longer than a traditional running shoe. The good news is, that’s not just hype! In all of the pairs I’ve used, I’ve typically found that is the case. I rarely get more than 400 miles on running shoes, and I’ve found the Newton Gravity+ to get at least 600 miles without a problem.\n\nAs far as traction, the lugs make it incredibly difficult to rate that. There isn’t a lot of rubber on the lugs, but they don’t have the “worst traction ever.” Am I going to run in the pouring rain or on ice in the Newton Gravity+? No, but for the most part, they have fairly average traction for a running shoe. Because the lugs of the Newton Gravity+ protrude out, they have slightly less traction than typical running shoes.\n\nI’ve done a few different types of runs in the Newton Gravity+, and I think it feels best for long runs. Those runs I want to start easy and then end faster. It has plenty of cushion for a long run but feels more responsive. I feel best when I’m running somewhat quicker than usual but not doing a workout. The Gravity+ is designed to run faster, and I think they’ve done a good job at this.\n\nNewton Gravity+ Conclusion:\n\nNewtons are not for everyone. If you’ve tried the Newton lug system and don’t like it, then the Newton Gravity+ is probably not for you. If you’ve never used Newton before, it’s essential to start slowly and work into it. If you are looking for a long-run or even race shoe that doesn’t have a carbon plate, the Newton Gravity+ might be a good option. It does last longer than many traditional running shoes, and there is a lot of technology inside. It’s funny to give a shoe that is definitely not right for everyone a great review, but it’s a great shoe. Not every running shoe is right for everyone but that doesn’t make it good or bad!\n\nMy Current Shoe Rotation:\n\nEasy/Daily Runs: Brooks Aurora, Diadora Mythos Blushield Volo, New Balance 1080 v11, Hoka Bondi 7, Brooks Levitate 5\n\nSpeed Work: 361 Flame, Nike Tempo Next%, New Balance Fuelcell TC Shoe Review, Reebok Float Ride Run fast Pro,\n\nLong Runs: Hoka Clifton Edge, Newton Gravity+\n\nTrail Running/Hiking: Hoka Torrent 2, Saucony Peregrine 11, North Face Flight VECTIV\n\nRaces: Asics Metaspeed Sky, Hoka One One Rocket X, adidas Adizero Pro, New Balance Fuelcell 5280, Nike Next%, Saucony Endorphin Pro, New Balance fuelcell TC, Reebok Run fast Pro\n\nYou Can See All Current Shoe Reviews Here.\n\nLooking to learn more about running shoes?
