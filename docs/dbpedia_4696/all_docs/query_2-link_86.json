        "text": "By Caitlin Giddings\n\nFew things are more important to new parents than their baby’s sleep.\n\nFor newborn to 6-month-old babies, the best place for that sleep is in a safety-certified bassinet, crib, or play yard in their parents’ room, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Of those options, a bassinet or a co-sleeper (a bassinet with a drop-down side, for positioning next to an adult bed) is often the most appealing choice, due to the compact, portable size and shallow sleep area (which makes it easy to lift out a just-awakened baby).\n\nHow we picked\n\nA safe sleep surface\n\nEach bassinet was evaluated for its adherence to the AAP’s safe sleep recommendations for infants (such as a firm, flat surface).\n\nUser-friendly design\n\nWe assessed how easy it is to adjust and move the bassinets, as well as what it’s like to assemble and disassemble them for travel.\n\nStability\n\nWe looked for bassinets that are unlikely to topple when bumped and bases that aren’t middle-of-the-night tripping hazards.\n\nBonus features\n\nWe appreciated nice extras like sound and motion features (when they work well) and storage, as well as stylish aesthetics.\n\nAfter researching 25 bassinets and putting 10 to the test during those bleary-eyed first four months of parenting an infant, one thing became clear: There’s no single “right” bassinet for every family. Lifestyle, budget, and individual preferences will ultimately determine the features that are most important to you. So we’ve zeroed in on six standout models that can meet a variety of needs (and levels of desperation to get some dang rest).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat is a bassinet—and who should use one?\n\nThis guide is for parents who want a safe and convenient place for their infants—from newborn to 6 months old—to sleep.\n\nFor many, that may be a bassinet—a piece of furniture made for sleeping babies that is smaller in scale than a full-size crib. A bassinet is typically around 30 inches long by 18 inches wide, versus a standard crib, which is usually around 52 inches long by 28 inches wide. That means bassinets are easier to fit beside an adult bed for frequent middle-of-the-night feedings, diaper changes, and check-ins during those early months.\n\nBassinets provide the safety of a crib (a flat, firm sleeping surface) with handier access to the baby. They’re shallower (by about 10 inches), so lifting out an infant doesn’t require as much effort. This can be especially helpful for those recovering from C-sections, tearing, and other birth complications.\n\nCo-sleepers are a subset of bassinets. The term “co-sleeper” is a bit of a misnomer because it evokes the idea of actually sharing a bed with your baby, which is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics due to the risk of infant sleep-related deaths, including SIDS and accidental suffocation or strangulation. “Bedside sleeper” is a more accurate name for this product, and this term is sometimes used interchangeably with “co-sleeper.” A co-sleeper has four sides and can be used like a standard bassinet. But a co-sleeper’s differentiating feature is a drop-down side, which lets you position the bassinet directly next to an adult bed, for easier snuggling or feedings during the night. This access can be particularly convenient during breastfeeding.\n\nBoth bassinets and co-sleepers are typically designed for use from birth up to around 6 months of age, though each model will have specific weight limits and even skill limits. For example, some bassinet manufacturers recommend that you transition your baby to a crib once they can roll over. And most recommend you do so when babies are able to push up onto their hands and knees—something that could happen before they’re 6 months old— given the shallow depth of the bed. In our experience, bassinets tend to be most useful during the first three to four months of an infant’s life.\n\nFor all bassinets and co-sleepers, it’s important for parents to make sure that the basket where the baby sleeps is securely attached to the stand, and that the whole piece is level. If the bassinet or co-sleeper is tilted, it could cause the baby to roll into an unsafe sleeping position.\n\nIf you want a single sleep option that can take a newborn through their first full year and beyond, you may want to consider a play yard with a bassinet insert, or you could simply place a regular crib in your own room for the first few months. (For help in choosing the right crib, see our guide to the best cribs.)\n\nLightweight and compact: Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE Portable Bassinet\n\nOur pick\n\nThe lightest of our picks, this no-frills bassinet is easy to move around the home or pack up for travel in its included bag. And it’s as stylish and cleanly designed as it is functional.\n\nBuying Options\n\nBest for: Families who want a simple, lower-priced, attractive bassinet that can be taken apart and put back together quickly and packed into its carrier bag for travel.\n\nWhy we like it: Most bassinets are billed as portable or travel-friendly, but the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE Portable Bassinet actually delivers. It weighs only 12.6 pounds (the lightest of any of our picks, by a long shot), packs down within minutes, and stores away easily in an included carrier bag.\n\nEven if traveling with your bassinet isn’t a priority, the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE is still a solid choice. This high-quality model does the job without any extra bells and whistles: It doesn’t have adjustable height, and there’s not much storage space, but this bassinet is easy to use and costs far less than many other bassinets. And it looks good in your home, with a sleek, mid-century modern aesthetic.\n\nNew parents suffering from baby-furniture-assembly fatigue will appreciate that it takes only about five minutes to unpack and assemble the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE, with or without the instructions. The four metal legs—with a wood-grain finish that looks nice, if not 100% convincing—snap into the underside of the bed, flaring out slightly to create a stable and secure-feeling base.\n\nThis bassinet has a compact footprint, so it easily slotted into a small bedroom. And because the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE is so exceptionally lightweight, moving it around wasn’t difficult: Within days of coming home from the hospital after delivering my baby, I had no trouble lifting the bassinet and carrying it to a different room.\n\nThe fabric-and-mesh portion is made from polyester fabric (available in either a pale beige or gray color), and it’s removable and machine-washable. And the transparent mesh sides make it easy to see into the bassinet from any angle. There’s a removable, nonadjustable canopy, which can be attached at the head of the bassinet; during midday naps, we found it useful for blocking direct light from a nearby lamp. The Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE is Greenguard Gold Certified, which means it’s made with materials that meet standards for lower chemical emissions.\n\nThe Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE comes with one fitted sheet. You will likely need to purchase additional sheets from Chicco, since the mattress is such a small, irregular size. But it’s fairly common for bassinets to require proprietary sheets.\n\nAt the foot of the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE, there’s a small exterior pocket with enough room to store a pack of baby wipes or a tube of diaper cream and a few extra diapers.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nAlthough this bassinet’s compact size is one of its best qualities—and part of what makes it so portable—it’s also a potential limitation. The bassinet’s interior measures 27 by 15 inches, by far the smallest of any bassinet we tested. And at 3½ months, my baby already looked gigantic inside it, despite being nowhere near the company’s cited 20-pound weight limit. (Multiple Amazon reviewers also complain that their kids outgrew this bassinet at around the 4-month mark.)\n\nParents hoping for more time before transitioning their baby to a crib might prefer another bassinet with more wiggle room, like the roomier Maxi-Cosi Iora Bedside Bassinet. Also, those looking for more storage space or adjustability won’t find it here—this bassinet has only one small pocket, and it sits in a single fixed position on static legs that can’t be made taller or shorter.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 5 minutes\n\nDimensions: 30 by 18 by 42 inches (LWH)\n\nBassinet weight: 12.6 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 20 pounds\n\nAdjustable: no\n\nStorage: one small pocket at the foot of the bassinet\n\nIncluded accessories: canopy, travel bag, fitted sheet\n\nOther special features: no\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpacious and sturdy: Maxi-Cosi Iora Bedside Bassinet\n\nOur pick\n\nThis sleek and roomy sleeper adjusts vertically and horizontally, and it feels extra-sturdy. Plus, it has a generous lower shelf for storing nighttime essentials like extra diapers, wipes, and more.\n\nBest for: Families that prefer (and can accommodate) a larger bassinet with more of a furniture-like feel, and those that appreciate extra storage and adjustability.\n\nWhy we like it: We were instantly won over by the modern, streamlined aesthetic of the Maxi-Cosi Iora Bedside Bassinet. It’s one of the most attractive bassinets we tested, and it’s also one of the most spacious, with a 20-by-32-inch sleep area and a 25-by-38-inch footprint. (Of the bassinets we tested in 2022, only the Cradlewise, a smart bassinet in our Another good bassinet section, was larger.) My son had plenty of room to splay out like a snow angel in his sleeping sack, slowly rotating to different angles throughout the night; he looked comfortable even beyond the three-month mark. The Maxi-Cosi Iora also has a deeper interior than most bassinets (the mattress rests about 10 inches lower than in our other picks), requiring more of a lift to pull the baby out.\n\nThe Maxi-Cosi Iora consists of a well-designed metal base, a metal top rim with a wood-grain finish, and mesh sides. (It’s available in three colors: a light gray, a darker gray, and a deep blue.) Of all the bassinets we tested, this one was the easiest to see into from the sides, due to the transparency of its mesh walls.\n\nThis bassinet is easy to assemble in about 10 minutes, and it breaks down for travel, into an included bag. However, at almost 27 pounds, the Maxi-Cosi Iora is far heavier and more cumbersome to disassemble and carry than our travel-friendly pick, the Chicco LullaGo Anywhere LE Portable Bassinet. Yet this weight makes the Maxi-Cosi Iora feel sturdy and stable. So it seems more like an actual piece of furniture—and it’s nearly impossible to knock over when someone takes a midnight trip to the bathroom.\n\nWe had trouble fitting the Maxi-Cosi Iora in our small bedroom, since it partially blocked our path to the bathroom. But once this bassinet was positioned alongside our bed, it was easy to adjust the height. You simply squeeze the handles on each end of the bassinet and pull up or down to find the proper level among the five height settings.\n\nThe Maxi-Cosi Iora also adjusts laterally, so you can slide it into one of three settings. It won’t actually swing out over your mattress (like the Halo BassiNest Swivel Sleeper 3.0, another of our picks, does). But that horizontal adjustability does get the bassinet closer to the edge of your bed.\n\nIn the bassinet’s sleep area, there’s a firm, flat mattress pad that seems a little more luxurious than average; Maxi-Cosi recommends that you wash it by hand. And the pad comes with a machine-washable mattress protector. Unfortunately, Maxi-Cosi sells fitted sheets for the Iora only on its UK website; we weren’t able to find them for sale in the US. (The mattress pad protector isn’t sold individually either. So if you were hoping to stock up on spares, this is a drag.) The mesh walls of the bassinet can be wiped down with a washrag and mild soap.\n\nOn the Maxi-Cosi Iora, our favorite feature was its generous storage basket—the largest on any bassinet we tested. It has plenty of space for extra gear, and we used it to stash backup diapers, jammies, and pacifiers so we could reach anything we needed without having to get out of bed.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe Maxi-Cosi Iora is a big bassinet with an even bigger footprint, so it might not be a good option for smaller spaces. Its deep interior—the baby sleeps about 10 inches farther down than in our other picks—could make lifting the baby out more difficult, especially post C-section. Also, even though this bassinet does come with a washable mattress pad protector, the lack of a fitted sheet—and the limited options for purchasing spare bedding—could rub some folks the wrong way.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 10 minutes\n\nDimensions: 40.55 by 22.44 by 7.28 inches (LWH)\n\nBassinet weight: 26.9 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 20 pounds\n\nAdjustable: yes (vertically), plus three horizontal settings\n\nStorage: roomy shelf beneath the sleep area\n\nIncluded accessories: mattress pad protector, travel bag\n\nOther special features: no\n\nWith a drop-down side: Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper Bassinet\n\nOur pick\n\nThis model can be used as a regular bassinet, or you can drop down one side and attach it to an adult bed for safe side-by-side sleeping. It also has wheels, for easy transport around the home, and plenty of storage space.\n\nBuying Options\n\nBest for: Caregivers looking for a spacious and functional (if inelegant) co-sleeper that attaches to the side of an adult bed, allowing for convenient middle-of-the-night access and closeness to the baby.\n\nWhy we like it: Wirecutter has been recommending the Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper Bassinet as a top baby bassinet since 2017, and with good reason: It’s an ultra-practical co-sleeper that’s priced well below similar models. This is the bassinet I used exclusively with my first child, in 2018. And in 2022, when I retested it against nine other models, I found that it still held up to the competition.\n\nIt’s also one of the top three models readers vouched for when we asked for recommendations via social media (in addition to the Snoo Smart Sleeper and various models of the Halo BassiNest).\n\nThe Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue is shaped like a compact, rectangular play yard on wheels, with four sides. One of those (long) sides can be folded down and out of the way (secured with Velcro), so it’s easy and safe to transfer your baby from the bassinet to the adult bed (for middle-of-the-night feedings) or to care for your baby from the adult bed. This gives exhausted parents something similar to the experience of true co-sleeping—which the AAP advises against, due to suffocation risks—while providing a safe and dedicated sleep space to return the infant to.\n\nTo fold down the side, you unclick the bassinet’s sidebar and lower down the top panel, securing it in place; a much shorter bar with a mesh wall remains in place to prevent your baby from rolling out of the sleep area when in the bassinet. (Imagine a low bumper between the adult bed and the bassinet, rather than an uninterrupted shared sleeping surface.)\n\nA separate strap (included) can be used to cinch the bassinet to the adult bed, to prevent any gap from forming during the night. We rarely used the co-sleeping function with the attachment strap because we liked having the freedom to move the bassinet around during the day. But the strap is simple to use, and it adds a sense of stability to the setup.\n\nThe Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper has easy-to-see-through mesh walls and a generous, 34-by-20-inch sleep area, which is larger than that of many of the bassinets we tested. My first child was able to sleep comfortably in this bassinet until she was nearly 5 months old, at which point she started looking too tall for it (though she was not yet nearing the 18-pound weight limit).\n\nThis bassinet has four height settings, spaced out in 2-inch increments. So it can be raised or lowered to be compatible with adult beds from 24 to 30 inches off the floor. However, fiddling with the height is not as easy as with other bassinets we tested—some hand strength is required, and each leg must be adjusted individually. The included mattress is water-resistant, and it comes with a machine-washable fitted sheet. The mesh can be spot-cleaned with a mild detergent.\n\nThe Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper has extremely ample storage—a large lower compartment as well as smaller pockets at the head and foot of the bassinet. We found the storage useful for storing extra clothes and diapers. It also minimized our fumbling around in the middle of the night and allowed us to keep everything we needed close to the bed. (Among our picks, only the Maxi-Cosi Iora Bedside Bassinet has more storage.) The Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper is also one of the easiest bassinets to move around the room, due to its four (lockable) wheels.\n\nOverall, this bassinet feels sturdy and stable. For the price, we think parents will be pleased with it.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper took more time to put together (24 minutes) than many of the models we tested, and it comes with lots of small parts, including screws that have to be removed before being reinserted in place. This bassinet is not difficult for one person to assemble alone, but it’s a lot easier and less frustrating if you can recruit an assistant.\n\nThe co-sleeping feature is unlikely to work well with many platform or low-profile beds, since the bassinet has a minimum height setting of 24 inches.\n\nThere’s also the issue of aesthetics—the Arm’s Reach Clear-Vue Co-Sleeper is all function over form, and it has more of a hospital-furniture look to it than the other bassinets we tested. The slippery and noisy nylon material around the mesh doesn’t have a very high-end feel, either.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 24 minutes\n\nDimensions: 34 by 20 by 34½ inches (LWH)\n\nBassinet weight: 26 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 18 pounds\n\nAdjustable: yes, vertically\n\nStorage: yes, a basket beneath the sleep area and a pocket at the foot\n\nIncluded accessories: fitted sheet, a strap and plate to attach to adult bed\n\nOther special features: drop-down side, wheels\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSwiveling and detachable: Halo BassiNest Swivel Sleeper 3.0\n\nOur pick\n\nA 360-degree swivel feature and vertical height adjustment allow you to position the Halo BassiNest 3.0 directly over your bed, and a push-down side makes lifting your baby out easier. Bonus: The sleep nest can be detached from its base and used on its own.\n\nBuying Options\n\nBest for: Parents who want a bassinet with similar perks to a bedside sleeper and one that can be used without its base.\n\nWhy we like it: If you’re not on board with the idea of an actual co-sleeper, but you do want the convenient access to your baby that those types of bedside bassinets provide, then the Halo BassiNest Swivel Sleeper 3.0 could be the answer.\n\nUnlike co-sleepers, which can be positioned directly next to an adult bed and have a side that drops down and stays down, the Halo BassiNest 3.0 has one side that scrunches down and then pops back up. It doesn’t take much strength to push down the bassinet’s side and lift out your baby for a feeding. So this bassinet is a good option for recovering postpartum parents who can’t or don’t want to get completely out of bed during the night. (The push-down side can also be locked to remain in the upright position, if you prefer.)\n\nIn addition to the access provided by the push-down side, the Halo BassiNest 3.0’s sleep area can swivel on its base 360 degrees. And the central support beam has a quick-release lever that can raise and lower the bed between 36 and 44½ inches, allowing you an array of options for positioning your baby. If you’re able to tuck the legs of the base on one side under your adult bed (there are four legs total), you can swivel the bassinet over the bed and have your baby hover cozily above you. (Note: This exact setup will work only with beds that are 24 to 30 inches high, and with bed frames that are at least 4½ inches from the floor.)\n\nThe Halo BassiNest 3.0 is simple to put together with a screwdriver. The 23-by-32¼-inch sleep area is well-sized for babies up to 20 pounds (in terms of roominess, it’s about middle of the pack), and it has a firm, flat surface with a high-quality waterproof mattress pad and fitted sheet. Its mesh walls are easy to see through. The fitted sheet can be machine-washed on the gentle cycle; the fabric and mesh of the bassinet can be spot-cleaned with a mild detergent or removed entirely for gentle machine-washing.\n\nOne of the features we liked best about the Halo BassiNest 3.0 is that the bassinet top can be removed from the base and used separately—it’s the only one of our picks with this functionality. By squeezing a small lever and lifting off the 9-pound sleep area, the bassinet becomes a sleep nest or legless travel crib that can be moved around easily to different locations. I used it to keep my baby napping nearby while I took a shower or made breakfast, and I brought it to a family member’s house on Thanksgiving to use during his midday nap.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe Halo BassiNest 3.0 doesn’t have storage space, which was something we found handy and useful on the models that did.\n\nThis bassinet’s footprint is a broad 34 by 34 inches, which might be an issue in smaller spaces. And while we like the base of the Halo BassiNest 3.0 overall, its shape might not work well for people with lower beds. Previous versions of the Halo BassiNest—and current versions of the Halo BassiNest Luxe and Halo BassiNest Premiere, both pricier models—had legs that splayed out horizontally on the floor; we found this to be a tripping hazard, and it made the bassinet top-heavy. The Halo BassiNest 3.0 has a redesigned base with legs that splay downward from a central stem. This solves those issues but also makes it more difficult to slot the legs beneath low beds when you’re trying to bring the bassinet in close.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 12 minutes\n\nDimensions: 33 by 32 by 45 inches (LWH)\n\nBassinet weight: 22.6 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 20 pounds\n\nAdjustable: yes, vertically and horizontally (360-degree swivel)\n\nStorage: no\n\nIncluded accessories: fitted sheet\n\nOther special features: sleep nest detaches from base\n\nIntuitive and responsive rocker: Snoo Smart Sleeper\n\nOur pick\n\nThis electronic bassinet, outfitted with sensors, detects a baby’s needs and soothes them to sleep with automated rocking and white noise. When it works, it can be dreamy. But this bassinet is super-pricey, and there’s no guarantee your baby will actually find it comforting.\n\nBuying Options\n\n$1,000 from Walmart\n\nMay be out of stock\n\nBest for: Folks who are willing to pay (significantly) more for a responsive bassinet that might help their family get more hours of sleep during those desperate early days of parenting.\n\nWhy we like it: The Snoo Smart Sleeper is an expensive, well-engineered smart bassinet that makes a lot of big promises about increasing your baby’s sleep. Specifically, the claim is that it will add one to two hours per night to their schedule and sleep-train your baby. (For our full assessment of the Snoo, see Is the $1,700 Snoo Smart Sleeper Bassinet Worth It? What to Know Before You Buy.)\n\nThe bassinet is outfitted with a microphone and sensors that allow it to tell (via sound and motion clues) whether your baby is awake and in need of soothing. The bassinet responds accordingly with automated swaying and shushing, coaxing the baby to sleep and ultimately allowing parents to get more rest during the bleary, exhausted first months of newborn life.\n\nIn our case, it actually worked. But for every Snoo devotee out there, you’re likely to find a hater or—more commonly—a parent who paid a pretty penny only to be underwhelmed when their infant didn’t follow the script.\n\nThe concept behind the Snoo isn’t anything new. It was designed by Dr. Harvey Karp, a pediatrician who popularized a method of calming babies, called the 5 S’s, in his best-selling book The Happiest Baby on the Block (first published in 2002). Caregivers have long been responsible for implementing the S’s (including swaying, shushing, and swaddling). But the Snoo lets you outsource—er, automate—some of them, enabling an infant to sleep longer and more deeply with less parental intervention.\n\nIt’s not like humans are totally forgotten in the process, though: The Snoo’s features are designed to mimic the relaxing sounds and motions of the womb. The idea is that a baby feels comforted by the familiar at a time when the outside world is an unfamiliar and unsettling place.\n\nAt first glance, there’s nothing that reads particularly high-tech about the Snoo. It looks like a sleek and stylish bassinet, with white mesh walls anchored by a wooden base and chrome legs that give off a vaguely Scandinavian vibe. The cover of the mattress is water-resistant, and the mattress and mesh can be spot-cleaned with a mild soap or detergent.\n\nAt 38 pounds, the Snoo is heavy to move, but it’s easy to assemble without tools, and it has a compact footprint. The bassinet comes with an organic cotton sheet and a starter pack of Snoo Sleep Sacks—proprietary swaddles you zip your baby into and then hook onto two plastic clips affixed to the bassinet’s base. (The Snoo’s motion function cannot be activated if the swaddle is not attached properly to the hooks.) By attaching the swaddle to the mattress clips, you are effectively immobilizing your child on their back within the bassinet.\n\nThe Snoo’s app is easy to use. As of July 15, 2024, Happiest Baby, which makes the Snoo, will offer two subscription options for the app.\n\nThe basic version is available to everyone free of charge; it includes the ability to control the Snoo’s speed and sound, and to receive alerts if the baby needs attention.\n\nAlong with the functions of the basic app, the premium version lets you track your baby’s sleeping and eating patterns over time. It also has some advanced settings for motion and sounds, and more. The premium version is free for nine months for those who buy the Snoo directly from the company or an authorized seller; those who rent it get the premium membership for the length of the rental plus one extra month. For people who buy their Snoo secondhand, borrow from a friend, or want to extend the membership beyond nine months, it costs $20 a month.\n\nIf you bought your Snoo from Happiest Baby or an authorized seller before July 15, 2024, and are currently using it, you’ll have nine months of free premium access starting from when you began using the Snoo.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nFor most families, the Snoo’s price will be its biggest drawback. At the time of publication, it was $1,700 purchased at full retail (though it does go on sale); this is a number that might sound outrageous or reasonable, depending on your budget and desperation for more sleep.\n\nStill, the Snoo is known for having a healthy resale market, so you’re likely to be able to recoup a good portion of your initial investment. Or a Snoo can be rented directly from Happiest Baby, for $159 per month. You should also factor in the cost of purchasing additional Snoo Sleep Sacks, which come in different sizes, if you want to have extras.\n\nThe criticisms about the Snoo should not be rejected out of hand. Some parents we surveyed complained that it simply didn’t work for them—their babies just didn’t like it. Others had difficulty weaning their babies from the Snoo and moving them to a traditional crib after four to six months.\n\nI interviewed multiple experts who were in favor of the Snoo, but I also spoke to experts who voiced concerns. Among the issues? The Snoo can work so well that babies may not wake up on their own to eat. If parents aren’t diligent about setting alarms every two to four hours for feedings, babies could potentially end up suffering from “failure to thrive.” This is the term for when a child’s weight or growth rate falls significantly below that of their peers, cautions Aleesha Burke, a lactation consultant in Layton, Utah.\n\nStacy Conder, a physical therapist, and Susan Klemm, an occupational therapist—both of the Carolina Kinder Development pediatric practice in Charlotte, North Carolina—also advise against using the Snoo. Because Snoo babies aren’t repositioned often enough, they said this could potentially exacerbate head and neck conditions such as plagiocephaly (back-of-the-head flatness), torticollis, and brachycephaly.\n\nAnd since the Snoo Sleep Sack pins the baby to the bassinet surface, it keeps the infant from practicing developmental skills, like rolling over, as they grow. A pediatrician I spoke with didn’t name the Snoo specifically, but they suggested that a smart sleeper that uses prolonged swaddling could hamper gross motor development, by preventing a baby from trying to roll in the two- to four-month window. The Snoo’s maker says it can be used for up to six months. But six months is a long time to go without the freedom to roll over, considering how many hours infants log in their beds. Finally, the Snoo provides no storage space.\n\nFor more on our personal experience with testing the Snoo, see Is the $1,700 Snoo Smart Sleeper Bassinet Worth It? What to Know Before You Buy.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 3 minutes\n\nDimensions when assembled: 35¾ by 19 by 31 inches (LWH)\n\nBassinet weight: 38 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 25 pounds\n\nAdjustable: no\n\nStorage: no\n\nIncluded accessories: three Snoo Sleep Sacks (S, M, L) with Snoo purchase or two (S, M) with Snoo rental, one fitted sheet\n\nOther special features: responsive swaying, white noise\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLower-priced electronic rocker: 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet\n\nOur pick\n\nMany parents turn to this electronic bassinet as a cheaper alternative to the Snoo. It doesn’t have the Snoo’s ability to sense and respond to your baby’s needs, but it does have a range of motion and sound settings that can be controlled manually or via an app.\n\nBest for: Parents who want the soothing motion and sound that a smart bassinet can provide, minus the exorbitant price (and technical sophistication) of the Snoo.\n\nWhy we like it: The 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet is a good option for parents looking for a lower-priced alternative to the Snoo Smart Sleeper.\n\nFirst, note that the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet is not to be confused with the 4Moms MamaRoo Baby Swing, an infant swing that was voluntarily recalled in August of 2022 due to an unsafe dangling strap that posed a strangulation hazard.\n\nThe 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet has a high-tech, futuristic-looking appearance and a touchscreen control panel that comes to life when you press the power button. From there, you can activate four white noise settings and five different sleep-inducing movement patterns (my baby found “Tree Swing” to be the most soothing), and you can adjust the speed of each motion between five levels.\n\nThe bassinet can also be operated with a Bluetooth-enabled MamaRoo app. It allows you to set auto-shutoff timers, so the bassinet can stay in motion for up to four hours before shutting off.\n\nThis bassinet isn’t responsive. Unlike the Snoo and the Cradlewise, the other smart bassinets we tested for this guide, the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet won’t launch into motion when it senses your baby fussing. If you need it to spring into action, you’ll have to be the one at the helm calling the shots. But its movements are smooth and organic-feeling, and it did an excellent job of tree-swinging, kangaroo-hopping, and rock-a-bye-ing my little guy to sleep. (For whatever reason, he was less enticed by the “Car Ride” and “Wave” modes.)\n\nFor naps and bedtime, I used the streamlined, basic app to set a timer to shut off after 10 to 15 minutes, and I had no problem successfully programming the timer or maintaining a Bluetooth connection to the bassinet. The white noise sound options include the sounds of a fan, rain, the ocean, and shushing; I found them to be peaceful and calming. In terms of volume, a MamaRoo spokesperson said the average decibel level on level 4 (the highest volume setting) is 62 decibels; the speaker is located at the front of the bassinet, by the control panel, and faces downward, projecting the sound off of the floor.\n\nPutting the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet together took about 16 minutes, including unpacking time, and didn’t require any tools.\n\nOnce assembled, this bassinet has a fairly compact footprint (I measured it as 25 by 34 inches). It stands on four stable-feeling legs, which can be adjusted between a height of 34½ and 39 inches (by removing or adding an included spacer to each leg). At about 17 by 29 inches, the bassinet’s sleep area is a bit snugger than those of some of the other bassinets we tested, partially due to its rounded corners. (At 12 weeks, my average-size son looked a tad hemmed in; I don’t think he could have lasted beyond four months in it.)\n\nThe 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet has a water-resistant mattress that seems high-quality and comfy while sticking to the safety standards of being firm and flat. The mesh sides of the bassinet are easy to see into and can be spot-cleaned with a mild soap or detergent. The mattress comes with a gray fitted washable sheet.\n\nLike the Snoo, this bassinet has to be positioned near an electrical outlet in order to use the motion and sound functions. Unlike the Snoo, the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet does not have special swaddles that immobilize the baby on their back.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet doesn’t come with any storage space. However, the company does sell a well-designed storage basket (which we tested) that hooks to the legs of the bassinet and is large enough to hold all of your middle-of-the-night essentials.\n\nFor us, the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet didn’t deliver the same sleep magic as the Snoo did, simply because it’s not responsive; it just operates in the mode you set it on and doesn’t increase or decrease when a baby fusses. But it was effective at lulling my baby to sleep and then shutting off at the preprogrammed time (without jarring him awake when it stopped). That isn’t so much a flaw as it is a reality. It’s why this bassinet is over $1,000 less than the Snoo, and it’s important that people manage their expectations and understand exactly what it is they’re getting.\n\nA Wirecutter staffer who used this bassinet with her son found that the touch panel was not very responsive; it often took her several tries to get it to respond. One Amazon reviewer also noted a similar issue.\n\nBecause the 4Moms MamaRoo Sleep Bassinet is a rocking bassinet, like the Snoo, it may be prone to some of the same criticisms; in theory, the soothing motion could be so effective that it prevents a baby from waking on their own often enough for feedings.\n\nKey specs\n\nAssembly time: 16 minutes\n\nDimensions: 34 by 24 by 39 inches (LWH), with leg extenders; 34½ inches (H), without leg extenders\n\nBassinet weight: 30 pounds\n\nBaby weight limit: 25 pounds\n\nAdjustable: yes, vertically\n\nStorage: no (lower basket sold separately)\n\nIncluded accessories: fitted sheet\n\nOther special features: movement and sound\n\nAnother good bassinet\n\nIf you want a responsive smart bassinet that will convert to a crib and will see your baby through the first year or two: The Cradlewise is a stylish smart crib with a lot to offer—if you can get past its incredibly steep price tag (around $1,900 at the time of publishing).\n\nThe Cradlewise crib takes considerable time to put together—about an hour and 15 minutes, for us. And once assembled, it takes up more floor space than any other bassinet we recommend, with a 25-by-40-inch footprint. But that’s because the Cradlewise is designed to be used beyond just the bassinet phase—it’s sized like a mini-crib. So you can start out with the drop-in bassinet converter, and then remove the converter and keep it in play until your baby reaches 33 pounds (usually around age 2) or is able to climb the rails. (This crib’s longer life cycle does help to slightly offset the incredibly high price.)\n\nLike the Snoo Smart Sleeper, the Cradlewise crib has responsive movement and white noise, so it can sense when your baby is fussing and soothe them (in this case, with a bouncing motion) without parental intervention. However, this crib doesn’t offer constant movement throughout the night like the Snoo does, nor does it require tethering the baby to the mattress via a swaddle.\n\nThe Cradlewise crib’s app is excellent; it’s intuitive and simple to use, and it makes customization easy for things like dictating the bassinet’s responsiveness, length of bouncing, and white noise options. Like the Snoo’s app, the Cradlewise app provides sleep insights and data about how and when your child slept over a 24-hour period, and it sends notifications when your baby is fussing and needs your attention.\n\nThe app also functions as a baby monitor; there’s a built-in camera on the top bar of the Cradlewise crib. The camera quality is terrific and includes night vision, a temperature gauge, and the ability to control whether you hear sound from the monitor continuously or only when there’s fussing (even when the app isn’t open on your smartphone).\n\nThe bassinet itself is made of an attractive wood that’s easy to keep clean, and it comes with a thick, soft, waterproof, and machine-washable mattress cover. The sides of the bassinet are mesh, and they can be spot-cleaned with a mild soap or detergent.\n\nOverall, we found this bassinet to be well designed and effective, though the bouncing didn’t keep our baby asleep quite as effectively as the Snoo’s swaying. Concerns that have been raised about the Snoo—such as its working too well and causing infants to sleep more than they should—might apply to the Cradlewise as well.\n\nAlso, the Cradlewise is still a fairly new product (it launched in 2018 but began shipping nationwide in 2021), and the online reviews and feedback about it are limited. So it is still somewhat unvetted. We will continue to monitor it and update this guide in the future with our findings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy you should trust us\n\nI’ve been a journalist and product reviewer for more than a decade, primarily on staff for Bicycling and Runner’s World magazines. Since becoming a parent, in 2018, I’ve expanded my reach beyond sports tech and toward the many ingenious products that make life with kids a little easier and more fun. When my second child was on the way, in 2022, I began seeking out bassinet options that offer the best combination of safety, stability, and sleep-supportive features.\n\nTo help decide which bassinets and co-sleepers to test, I relied on my personal experience with my first child, as well as on recommendations and crowdsourcing from my social circle and many general Facebook parenting groups. I scoured online roundups, such as those from Babylist and What to Expect, and read thousands of Amazon rankings and reviews. Most importantly, I considered the advice of the key organizations that set US safety standards, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the AAP.\n\nI studied the work of Harvey Karp, author of the well-known newborn-sleep book The Happiest Baby on the Block and creator of the Snoo Smart Sleeper. And I spoke with several pediatric experts, including Rebecca F. Carlin, MD, of the Columbia University Department of Pediatrics, a pediatrician and one of the co-authors of the AAP’s 2022 safe sleep guidelines; Aleesha Burke, IBCLC, a lactation consultant (and Snoo skeptic) in Layton, Utah; and physical therapist Stacy Conder and occupational therapist Susan Klemm of Carolina Kinder Development, in Charlotte, North Carolina, who also advise against the use of Snoo and other smart bassinets.\n\nThis guide is an update to the research and work of journalist Caleb Hannan, who reviewed baby bassinets and co-sleepers for Wirecutter in 2017 and 2018. Hannan consulted with infant sleep experts, including Dr. Karp; James McKenna, PhD, head of the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at Notre Dame; and pediatrician and author Bill Sears.\n\nHow we picked and tested\n\nWe began our search by crowdsourcing bassinet intel in social media parenting groups, poring over the reviews of Amazon’s top sellers, and researching existing bassinet roundups from Babylist, What to Expect, the Bump, and other sites. We then compiled a list of 25 of the most-recommended and best-selling bassinets and created a massive spreadsheet full of specs, including pros, cons, and social media feedback for each. Ultimately, we narrowed the list down to 10 finalists and had all 10 sent to my house for testing. They all arrived when I was about 8 months pregnant with my second child.\n\nFor each bassinet, my wife and I timed how long it took to put it together, taking notes on how easy it was to assemble with the included instructions.\n\nOnce our baby was born, in July 2022, we had him spend five to 10 nights in each bassinet, giving each bed the chance to wow him. The testing occurred over a 16-week period, providing us almost four months to assemble, use, and debate the merits of 10 different sleep surfaces.\n\nWe used a spreadsheet to keep track of things like how comfortable our baby appeared, whether the bassinet seemed to aid or impede his falling asleep, how pleasant it was to use, how easy or difficult it was to adjust (including height and features like a drop-down side), how hard it was to take apart, and the ease of cleaning at the end of the test period. We also noted helpful features (like storage space), overall stability and sturdiness, the size of the footprint, the quality of the mattress, and aesthetics, among other factors.\n\nBy the end of the process, my baby had become the true expert on bassinets. After spending nearly every week of his life up to that point in a different sleep product, he was quick to express his personal tastes and approval.\n\nUltimately, we concluded that a bassinet worth recommending must have:\n\nA safe sleep surface: Each year, there are around 3,400 sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) in the US. To reduce the risk of infant sleep deaths, the AAP maintains a set of safe sleep guidelines that encourage parents to place babies to sleep on their backs on a firm, flat surface. Among their other recommendations: Blankets, pillows, toys, and other objects should be kept out of the sleep area; babies should sleep in the same room as their caregivers for the first six months (but never in the same bed). These guidelines were updated in 2022, placing more emphasis on the potential dangers of inclined sleepers (such as the recalled Fisher-Price Rock ’n Play Sleeper) and bed sharing, as well as the dangers of some specific sleep products, like weighted swaddles.\n\nAll products sold in the US that are labeled as bedside sleepers, play yards, bassinets, or cribs—including the ones we tested for this guide—must adhere to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) applicable safety standards, which include having a firm, flat surface with no more than a 10-degree incline.\n\nThoughtful design: A good bassinet should make it easy to transfer a baby into your bed and back again, even for recovering postpartum parents. The point of owning one of these is to have your baby in a nearby safe sleep space, so you can smoothly bring them to you for comfort and feeding, and then return them to their bed with minimal effort and sleep disruption. In order to nestle a bassinet close to an adult bed, it helps for a bassinet to have a compact footprint and legs that are adjustable (or that work well with different bed heights). Depending on your needs, a drop-down or push-down side makes baby retrieval even easier. We also looked for bassinets with mesh sides that were transparent enough to see through clearly, so you don’t have to get up and peer in to check on your baby.\n\nA stable and sturdy base: When you’re stumbling to the bathroom in the middle of the night, bleary-eyed and exhausted, the last thing you need in your path is a rickety, top-heavy obstacle with your baby inside. In support of clumsy, sleep-deprived fellow parents everywhere, we sought high-quality bassinets that felt strong, stable, and almost impossible to knock over, with bonus points for designs that seemed especially unlikely to trip up tired feet.\n\nUseful additional features: Although we didn’t rule out any bassinets for being basic, we did appreciate when they brought a little something extra to the party, and many did. We found dedicated storage space to be our favorite bonus feature: Again, when you’re operating on minimal sleep, it helps to have everything you need for a 2 a.m. diaper or wardrobe change immediately on hand. We also took into account the washability and quality of the mattresses and fitted sheets. As for tech functions, we didn’t judge bassinets for not having features like motion or white noise. But when we thought those features helped a baby get to sleep faster, we made note of it.\n\nAn attractive appearance: A bassinet is a piece of furniture—it lives in your home for up to six months, and you’ll be constantly looking at it and interacting with it throughout the day and night. Clearly, aesthetics are subjective, and the amount of weight you put into how great-looking your baby’s bassinet needs to be is up to you. But we wanted to find a variety of attractive, stylish bassinets that could deliver on form as well as function.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy we’re not recommending any in-bed sleepers\n\nWhen we first published this guide, in 2017, we tested four in-bed sleepers (small, leg-free infant sleepers designed to be placed directly in an adult bed): the DockATot Deluxe+, which has since been issued a notice of violation by the CPSC due to reports of infant deaths associated with the product; the Snuggle Me Organic; the SwaddleMe By Your Side Sleeper Deluxe (no longer available); and The First Years Close & Secure Sleeper (no longer available). At that time, we were concerned about the safety of some of these models, given well-known warnings against the use of crib bumpers and how some in-bed models have soft, bumper-like sides. But we recommended one of them: the now-discontinued SwaddleMe By Your Side Sleeper Deluxe, which had ventilated, non-padded sides. We reconsidered our stance as expert opinion evolved, and we decided to test only those sleepers that are subject to CPSC safety standards, which in-bed sleepers are not.\n\nThere are companies that advertise in-bed sleepers as a safer way to bed-share with an infant, compared with having the baby directly in bed with an adult. But unlike bedside sleepers, cradles, and bassinets, which are subject to CPSC safety standards, in-bed sleepers have no such standards. “The AAP continues to encourage families to use only CPSC-regulated products and recommends against all bed-sharing,” a spokesperson for the AAP told us by email.\n\nSome in-bed sleepers have soft surfaces or fluffy padding around the sides—neither of these conform to the AAP’s requirement that infants sleep on a firm, flat surface without soft bedding. Even for in-bed sleepers that have a relatively firm, flat sleep surface, placement of the sleeper on top of a softer, adult mattress could still put an infant at risk, said Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, a Portland, Oregon–based pediatrician and president of the AAP. A 2019 Consumer Reports investigation found that at least 12 infant deaths between 2012 and 2018 were linked to the use of in-bed sleepers, including two in the SwaddleMe By Your Side Sleeper. SwaddleMe subsequently denied that its products were linked to the deaths, and it cited reports by independent medical examiners concluding that the in-bed sleepers were not a contributing factor to the deaths in two cases.\n\nWhat about buying a used bassinet or co-sleeper?\n\nMost families will use a bassinet for a short window of time—typically just three to six months (if it’s not saved for subsequent babies). The upside of that brief use period is that it may be possible to find a co-sleeper or bassinet that’s still in good condition on the resale market.\n\nIn this guide, we recommend high-quality bassinets that can be passed down to multiple babies or purchased and resold on sites like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and OfferUp. Still, when it comes to a preowned crib or bassinet, you should always exercise caution: Don’t buy one built before 2011, when the current CPSC safety requirements were adopted. The CPSC also recommends against using a crib that’s more than 10 years old.\n\nThe Snoo, in particular, is a hot commodity on the resale market. If you don’t want to purchase a new model, you can rent one directly from Happiest Baby. Or you can purchase a used one from a resale site or any one of a dozen Facebook groups devoted to buying, selling, and trading Snoos. A used Snoo tends to go for about $800, sometimes more. If you’re buying one that’s preowned, before purchasing it, be sure to check that the Snoo app on your phone can pair with the bassinet and smoothly run it through the four levels of soothing. And be aware that the Snoo’s one-year limited warranty is non-transferrable. So if you purchase the bassinet secondhand, it won’t be covered against any defects or other issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe competition\n\nBassinets in Halo’s BassiNests line—including our pick in this guide, the Halo BassiNest Swivel Sleeper 3.0—are popular for their 360-degree swiveling mechanism and the push-down side (which lets you easily retrieve your baby without getting out of bed). We loved those features, but we found the base of the BassiNest Luxe—an upgrade model with two levels of vibration and four sound options—to be too ungainly to recommend, particularly given the bassinet’s price. The Luxe’s wide, 32½-by-32½-inch footprint created a frequent tripping hazard. And it also made the bassinet feel top-heavy (as if it might tip over) and sit at a slightly unlevel angle. Halo used to sell a Premiere version of the BassiNest that’s a step down from the Luxe; the Premiere has a vibrating feature and a floor light (and the same non-optimal base), but we didn’t test it.\n\nThe Ingenuity Dream & Grow Bedside Baby Bassinet appeared promising, with its adjustable bedside height, detachable sound machine (it can be used on its own), and ability to accommodate babies up to 12 months—all at a lower price than that of many other bassinets. However, assembling the bassinet was a 25-minute nightmare that invoked far more cursing than any other bassinet assembly, thanks to this model’s spring clips (which frequently disengaged from their holes and had to be pulled out with forceps), among other hard-to-wrangle parts. Once assembled, the Dream & Grow’s sleep surface was difficult to level and seemed uncomfortable for our baby, so we cut the test period short after a couple of nights.\n\nIn January 2024, Consumer Reports detailed some safety concerns with the Ingenuity Dream & Grow Bedside Bassinet, citing accounts by caregivers that the bassinet, which has a cantilevered base—meaning it’s only supported on one side—wasn’t staying level. The tilted bassinet caused their babies to roll into unsafe sleeping positions.\n\nWe had high hopes for the popular BabyBjörn—and we appreciated its sleek Scandinavian looks. But ultimately we found it had too many other shortcomings to recommend it. IKEA-esque in both appearance and assembly instructions, the BabyBjörn took less than five minutes to put together with the included Allen wrench. It has a high-quality, machine-washable mattress pad, but it doesn’t come with a fitted sheet, there are no pockets, and there’s no built-in storage. The primary feature is that the springy, suspended sleeping area bounces lightly—either when rocked by a parent or prompted by the baby’s natural movements within the bassinet. However, we found this motion to be more lurching than smooth and likelier to wake the baby than to soothe him. It also has a relatively low baby-weight limit of 18 pounds.\n\nSome families may choose mini-cribs (usually around 38 inches long by 24 inches wide) instead of bassinets. Mini-cribs are a bit larger and more furniture-like than bassinets (since they’re often made of wood or metal, like full-size cribs). So they don’t offer the same portability as many bassinets, and they can also be expensive, but it’s a matter of personal preference.\n\nCare and maintenance\n\nCleaning your bassinet\n\nCheck the manual for the specific cleaning instructions that apply to your bassinet. In our experience, the fitted sheets that come with bassinets can be machine-washed. Some mattress pads can be machine-washed on a gentle cycle in cold water, with mild detergent, and hung to dry; others must be hand-washed or spot-cleaned. Just don’t use bleach or other harsh cleaners, unless your bassinet’s instructions say otherwise; doing so can damage the materials. And to prevent mold, make sure all of the bedding is completely dry before you return it to the bassinet.\n\nTo clean the mesh on the bassinet’s sides, you can use a vacuum or duster to tackle any dust, and then spot-clean it with warm water and a mild detergent (or follow the care instructions in your manual, if they differ).\n\nStorage\n\nIf you’re storing your bassinet between babies, remove the mattress and sheet, clean them thoroughly, and put them in a tightly sealed plastic bin or plastic wrap (to protect them from moisture). When you retrieve them from storage, if you see any signs of mold on the mattress or fitted sheet, scrub the molded area with distilled white vinegar (a known mold killer) before machine-washing. If that doesn’t do the trick, replace those items.\n\nAlthough bassinets don’t technically expire, safety standards can change over time. If you’re using an older model, check online to make sure that it hasn’t been recalled and that it meets the current safety standards.\n\nThis guide was edited by Ingela Ratledge Amundson and Kalee Thompson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSources\n\nRebecca Carlin, MD, FAAP, co-author of Updated Safe Sleep Guidelines, phone interview , July 1, 2022\n\nStacy Conder, physical therapist at Carolina Kinder Development , email interview , November 7, 2022\n\nSusan Klemm, owner and occupational therapist at Carolina Kinder Development , email interview , November 7, 2022\n\nAleesha Burke, IBCLC , phone interview , July 1, 2022\n\nSleep-Related Infant Deaths: Updated 2022 Recommendations for Reducing Infant Deaths in the Sleep Environment , Pediatrics , June 21, 2022\n\nAbout SIDS and Safe Infant Sleep, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n\nHarvey Karp, MD, The Happiest Baby on the Block\n\nMeet your guide\n\nCaitlin Giddings\n\nCaitlin Giddings is a freelance writer based in Austin, Texas.
