        "text": "Do you run? Do you know Newton Running? You should. It’s a new year, which means lots of you are thinking about resolutions which surely include better health and more exercise. So yes, Hip Daddy has you covered. Newton is an amazing running shoe brand that has built up an amazing loyal, die hard, obsessive, and social community of followers. Runners love Newton. You should too. And yes, it’s most def a Hip Daddy Approved brand! We had the pleasure of talking to their head Prez, Craig Heisner, in our Spotlight #29…please enjoy.\n\nTell us about your kids. What’s it like being a Dad?\n\nMy wife Dena and I have two teenagers, Cole 16 and Paige 14 so we’re just starting the driving and high school years. What makes us proud is when another teacher or parent approaches us to tell us what great kids we have – with most of the credit going to their Hip Mommy. They are thoughtful, kind, very funny, and curious children. They both exercise both sides of their brains via sports, school, and music so they remain balanced. I like to think they are grounded kids too.\n\nBeing a father brings so much joy to me and it’s a role that I take very seriously. Losing my dad to pancreatic cancer when he was only 51, (I was 23) was tough on my family and I want to take advantage of every day I can with my family and always be creating memories. I love to watch them grow and cherish every milestone in their lives.\n\nTalk to us about your parenting style.\n\nMy wife and I take a team approach and try to stay on the same page, which isn’t always easy. I’d say we offer a fair mix of providing slack while keeping expectations clear. I want them to get everything they can out of each phase in their lives. I am also very self-deprecating. As a teenager, I was the one who used to help my dad work on the cars, (I sat in the car and turned the key). I used to beep the horn when he was under the hood and it was funny every time. Deep down, I think he thought it was funny too. And now my kids take every opportunity to get a good laugh at their dad’s expense, and I love it.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you cannot live without as Dad?\n\nTime. I always need more and I want it to slow down.\n\nEvery Hip Daddy needs a pair of Newtons. We love the brand. What’s next for Newton?\n\nEvery Hip Daddy should be a member of Newton Nation. It’s such a unique company and culture with our emphasis on the double bottom line of ensuring that we stay true to our core values of giving back more than we take from the world while still remaining profitable. The brand is a rocket ship and we’re always looking for ways to continue to innovate in the highly competitive running space. 2014 was huge for us with a new 5-lug technology platform and many exciting new products. The momentum headed into 2015 and beyond couldn’t be any stronger.\n\nHow do you manage responsibilities on the homefront with those of leading a very awesome footwear company?\n\nFamily is always first at Newton so we try to prioritize things accordingly. For me it’s not a work vs. life balance, it’s all just life. I make it work by shaving trips when I can and try to schedule everything as far in advance as possible. For the most part, it works well.\n\nWhat’s family life like in the wonderful state of Colorado?\n\nIt just doesn’t get any better than being in Colorado. There is so much that the area offers families who are active like ours – tremendous skiing, cycling, hiking, arts, etc. Just everything you could ask for. We love it.\n\nWhat does the perfect weekend look like?\n\nMaybe catch one of our children’s volleyball matches or basketball games on Friday followed by a full day of skiing on Saturday and a CU game and a long bike ride on Sunday. Of course, we have to fit in some Pizzeria Locale pizza or one of the other cool foodie spots in town."
