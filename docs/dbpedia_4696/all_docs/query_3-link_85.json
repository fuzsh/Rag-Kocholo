        "text": "Whether you’re a runner, a gym-goer or both, you need the right gear to support your hard work and help you feel your best. But with so many options for athletic shoes on the market, it can be difficult to determine which shoe will be best for each activity.\n\nYou might be tempted to just grab your most comfortable pair of sneakers on your way out the door, but wearing the wrong shoe type for your workout can increase your risk of injury. While cross-training shoes and running shoes have some similarities, running shoes provide the appropriate cushioning needed for long distances, while training shoes support a greater range of movement patterns. Here’s how to choose the perfect shoe for your next workout.\n\nRunning comes with a ton of physical and mental health benefits, from reducing anxiety to increasing your lung capacity. But the repeated impact of your feet hitting the ground can also put stress on your body and lead to injury if you’re not wearing the right gear. Running shoes are designed to provide shock absorption and support forward movement while still remaining lightweight so you can fly across the road or track. They have more midsole cushioning and arch support than training shoes, which can help protect against overuse injuries like stress fractures.\n\nTraining shoes are capable of supporting a wide range of movements, from lateral plyometric moves to squats on the spot to quick direction changes. Training shoes are typically flatter, with a lower heel-toe drop and greater flexibility. They’re also designed to provide more stability. For example, the Nike Air Zoom SuperRep 2 for men and women distributes energy across a full-length plate, braces your foot when you move from side to side and holds your foot in place with a mesh ribbed upper."
