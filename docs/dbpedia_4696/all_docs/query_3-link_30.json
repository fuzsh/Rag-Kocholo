        "text": "How to Select the Best Running Shoes For You\n\nWhen you’re searching for running shoes, where do you start? Most people start with an online search and read about a certain brand or look up a popular running shoe. If a running shoe is popular, then why not just pick that as my running shoe based on the fact that lots of other people run in that shoe?\n\nFor example, the Asics running shoes pictured above are popular. Does that mean these running shoes should work for anyone?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nWhen you think about what you want in a running shoe, remember that your desires and needs are different than other runners. You might like a lot of soft, fluffy cushion underfoot, while another runner might prefer a firmer, more dynamic feel. You might like to focus on finding a lightweight shoe while someone else likes to focus on the amount of room in the toebox. Also consider that your feet are not the same as anyone else’s.\n\nThat means the answer to today’s heading is YES! It does matter what shoes you run in.\n\nHow to Pick Running Shoes\n\nWhen it comes to running shoe brands, there are so many wonderful choices that the problem is almost never a lack of options, from Brooks to Nike, Saucony to Asics, Hoka to On, Diadora to Mizuno, and the list goes on. Instead, it’s figuring out what your feet need paired with your particular goals for running. With so many choices, how do you decide which running shoes to buy?\n\nThere is one piece of advice that you will see repeated on our blog, on our website, and in our store:\n\nGet a Proper Shoe Fitting\n\nThis is the best first step you can take when you want to find running shoes that work for you.
