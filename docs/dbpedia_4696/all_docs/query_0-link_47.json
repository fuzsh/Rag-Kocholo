        "text": "Introducing Newton's most cushioned model ever, powered by a super stack of ultra plush NRG+ foam and a new generation of ARTâ„¢ technology to create the perfect balance of cushion and springiness to take your run in entirely new directions.\n\nThe Isaac combines next gen NRG+ and Hytrel foams to minimize impact while the sculpted rocker geometry is designed to amplify forward momentum and minimize weight. The result? An amazingly soft but versatile shoe that feels just as great logging long miles as it does wearing around casually. The new Split-Lug Action Reaction Technology is designed to maximize rebound for a smoother, more energetic ride. Equipped with 8 independent flex lugs that compress and spring back like a trampoline, they reduce impact and return energy with each stride and work in harmony with the XPS+ Peebax plate to keep you stable and in total control. The Adaptive-Fit seamless air mesh molds to the shape of your foot and lets air flow freely; while features like non-friction lining and multi-positional lacing system provide the security and comfort that makes it feel like it was built just for you."
