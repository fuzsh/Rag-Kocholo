        "text": "Olivia Burton\n\nIf like me, you have spent the last few months eating your feelings and moving like a sloth – you might be in the market for some new running shoes.\n\nRunning shoes are difficult to purchase, they need to be the right shape, the right material and more importantly, need to last (here’s a great article on 5 Signs you should replace your running shoes.\n\nIn terms of ethics and environmental practices, sneaker brands are infamous for dodgy dealings (Nike has been accused of using sweatshops since the 1970s).\n\nIt’s also important to understand how little workers get paid, for example in Indonesia, workers earn around $3.70 for a pair of running shoes that later sells in store for about $180. The toxic dyes and materials in sneakers are also environmentally harmful.\n\n1. Allbirds – For the most eco\n\nListen up – I can personally vouch for the fact that these are the world’s best running and lifestyle shoes (for men, women and kids).\n\nEco footwear brand Allbirds was started by New Zealander Tim Brown alongside engineer and renewables expert; the B-Corp (businesses that do good).\n\nThe running shoes are unbelievably comfortable and long-lasting, made from renewable materials (eucalyptus trees) and designed for maximum cushioned support, stability and comfort whilst moving. The sole and base is designed for control, whilst also being made from sugarcane and natural rubber.\n\nThey take performance seriously, having logged thousands of miles in testing with pro athletes over a year-long period. They also take the environment seriously, with Tree Dasher style sneakers being carbon neutral.\n\n2. VEJA (Condor) – For the trendiest & friendliest\n\nThe uber-trendy eco-friendly (& ethical) VEJA sneakers have now entered the running shoe world, with a wide range of very cool and brightly coloured performance sneakers.\n\nIt took over 4 years apparently to develop the first ecological post-petroleum running shoe – but meet The Condor.\n\nThe VEJA Condor shoes are not for very intense activity but are still designed for comfort and support for everyday exercise. The shoe is made from recycled plastic bottles, recycled polyester, rubber, sugar cane, and natural latex (there’s even some banana oil in there somewhere!)\n\nLike the rest of VEJA’s range, they are made in a factory in Brazil with fair working rights.\n\n3. Adidas – For the classic\n\nIn the last few years, Adidas has really upped its game in terms of ethics and environmental commitment. Especially when compared to their brand competitors. As they should considering they are a huge brand (second largest activewear brand and profit over US$10 billion a year) with influence and power to make a significant change.\n\nThey are currently rated Good by Good On You, so aren’t a completely guilt-free brand but are on to a good start. The line of performance running shoes are still made with petroleum-based products, however, they recently bought out a line in partnership with an ocean charity – ADIDAS X PARLEY.\n\nThese with upcycled plastic waste from remote islands, beaches, coastal communities, and shorelines, saving new material and pollution in the ocean.\n\n4. Vivobarefoot – For the barefoot feel\n\nThe brand that connects health and sustainability with shoes = Vivobarefoot.\n\nThe brand is completely transparent on its website, with audits on supply chains, areas for environmental improvements, and chemical testing stages.\n\nIn 2019, they produced 512,000 pairs of life-changing wide, thin, and flexible shoes (made from recycled and eco-friendly materials).\n\nThere is a range of sleek running shoes that are lightweight, breathable, animal-free, and sustainable (the Ultra III BLOOM are made from algae foam). Each pair reduces 40 gallons worth of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and returns 57 gallons of clean water to the habitat."
