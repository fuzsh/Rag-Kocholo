        "text": "I tried my usual size, but there's not enough room length-wise, so I got mine (Lady Isaac and Terra Momentum) a half size bigger. On me, the toe box is ever so slightly wider than a normal shoe--I usually look for shoes that tend to run wide (without getting an actual wide width).\n\nCheck out the \"shoefitr\" gadget on the Runningwarehouse website. I find that Newtons vary between models, even model year. I have the current Newton Distance, and I needed at least a half size larger than I would normally wear. I also have the 2012 Gravity, and it fit in my normal running shoe size.\n\nThat shoefitr is a big help for me. I don't have to travel 100 miles to try on shoes, but local places don't tend to stock my size. Running Warehouse has helped me, since they have free shipping & returns. (This sounds like an ad, but I'm just trying to help the OP!)"
