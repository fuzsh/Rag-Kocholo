        "text": "You will notice something very different about the Newton Running Energy shoe. It is the second shoe in the Newton Running line-up that has five lugs versus the traditional four lugs. See picture below.\n\nYou will also notice the five lugs are less pronounced and extend to the margins of the outsole. This creates a more stable mediolateral feel versus the four lugs in the other Newton shoes.\n\nThe Energy comes in at around 9 oz. For me, they fit true to size. Others have made comments that they needed to size down ½ size. The size 9 (my normal size) fit perfectly for me.\n\nThe Newton Energy felt great out of the box. They are definitely more cushioned that the traditional Newton shoes. The upper construction is a mesh material with the great cushioning around the ankles and heel. From my perspective, the upper on the Energy are more durable than the upper on the Gravitas (but the Gravitas is 1 oz lighter).\n\nI like the pricing of the Energy ($119) which is more in-line with other shoe prices.\n\nROAD TEST\n\nThe Energy performed well on the roads and non-technical trails. I have put over 400 miles on them. The have the normal wear and tear on the outsole and have stood up to many different running sessions – easy, long, tempo, etc. They drain well when wet.\n\nI also removed the original insoles and replaced them with thinner insoles to provide a less cushioning feel. The shoes felt more like a 4mm drop (unofficial measurement) versus the 6mm drop as advertised. The midsole has sufficient cushioning for the occasional heel striker. Overall, the Energy is a solid shoe from Newton.\n\nTECH SPECS\n\nWeight – 9.10 oz (258 g) (Size 9)\n\nOffset: 6mm (can change by replacing insole)\n\nNon-gusseted tongue\n\nNeutral Shoe\n\nNo Rock Plate (Road Shoe)\n\nMidsole – EVA\n\nUpper – Synthetic\n\nMade In – Indonesia\n\nWomen’ Version\n\nWeight Table\n\nCONCLUSION"
