        "text": "So glad to have many of you on board for fall half marathon training! If you missed Friday‚Äôs post, it‚Äôs not too late to join us. The fun kicks off on September 4.\n\nSince I‚Äôve been talking about running a lot the last couple of weeks, I thought it would be a good time to share my review of the updated Newton Fate 3. I started running in Newtons two years ago and I have been hooked ever since. For full transparency, I‚Äôm a brand ambassador for them and these shoes were sent to me as a gift but I‚Äôm not receiving any compensation for sharing my Newton love.\n\nNewton Fate 3 Review\n\nThe Fate is a neutral running shoe. It‚Äôs well-suited for a wide variety of runners and offers what I think is a perfect blend of cushioning, support and flexibility.\n\nThe biggest distinguishing factor when it comes to Newtons is their P.O.P. technology. Point of Power is the patented lug system that gives Newtons their unique shape, ride and feel. You can see the lugs across the forefoot of the shoe in this picture.\n\nThe Newton Fate 3 has P.O.P 2 technology, which is beveled lugs that provide a nice intro to Newton‚Äôs proprietary Action/Reaction‚Ñ¢ Technology. According to their website, ‚Äúgenerated by the active movement of the lugs, Action/Reaction Technology creates a responsive, trampoline-like cushioning system that provides quicker bounce-back and loses less energy than a traditional foam-core running shoe.‚Äù\n\nI think the Newton Fate 3 is my favorite model yet. Here are a few notes about Newton shoes and the Fate 3 that you might find helpful.\n\nI needed to size up on the Fate 3 and all of Newton‚Äôs new shoes. I‚Äôm a 7.5 in dress and usually an 8 in athletic shoes. I went to an 8.5 for the first time with this update and the extra bit of room was needed!\n\nThis is such a small thing but I love the bright colors that Newton uses in the design of their shoes.\n\nNewton running shoes feature a level platform. Many running shoes have become more stacked in the heel and thicker/cushier overall. Newton shoes have a lower heel to toe drop so that you are in a position to find your most natural running form.\n\nThe Fate 3s are very breathable and stretchy (in a good way).\n\nThe Fate 3 fits nice and snug in the heel but I find the toe box to be roomy (once again, in a good way!).\n\nI highly recommend this shoe. The lugs take a little getting used to but I think you‚Äôll love them!\n\nLast Week‚Äôs Workouts\n\nI haven‚Äôt shared workouts lately, here‚Äôs a snapshot of what the last few weeks have looked like for the most part.\n\nMonday: 3.6 mile run, teach Y2 Strength\n\nTuesday: hot yoga, teach Y2 Strength and Pure Resistance (since I taught 2 classes back to back, I gave about 60% effort in both and did a lot of walking around and form correcting and went lighter on some weight selections)\n\nWednesday: teach Y2 Strength, hot yoga\n\nThursday: 60 minute walk, teach Y2 Strength\n\nFriday: 5.7 mile run, 20 minutes of yoga\n\nSaturday: REST\n\nSunday: will be a longer run, shooting for 7-8 miles\n\nAn Important Note on Rest!\n\nLast weekend I was busy with our last TT weekend and also feeling a little worn out/beaten down so I took three consecutive days off of exercise (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). I didn‚Äôt even go for walks. It was magical. I can‚Äôt tell you how refreshed and renewed I felt coming into this week‚Äôs workouts. Oh and I also got an amazing massage on Friday night that helped too. üôÇ\n\nJust a little reminder that rest is such a key part of training and there is nothing wrong with taking MORE than one rest day!\n\nWhat‚Äôs your current favorite running shoe?\n\nHow have you been doing with taking rest days lately?"
