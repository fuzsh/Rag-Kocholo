You can learn more about our review process here and see our list of affiliate partners here.*\n\nIn this complete guide to the best sustainable and ethical running shoes, we’ll review the top available options on the market.\n\nWe researched and analyzed these running shoes along the criteria of performance, impact on people, and impact on the environment.\n\nFor more on how we assessed the most sustainable running shoes, read our section titled: “What Makes a Sustainable Running Shoe?” below.\n\nOur goal here (as well in every single one of our Buy Ensemble reviews or lists) is to help make purchasing and supporting planet and people-friendly products easier. Specifically here, we want you to feel good about how your running shoes help you perform and as well, how they (and the brands behind them) affect the planet and the people living on it.\n\nWe’ll offer a quick list of the best sustainable options we’ve found before diving into more in-depth reviews.\n\nLet’s make that next run more impactful.\n\nQuick List: The Most Sustainable & Ethical Running Shoes\n\nBelow are our eight picks for the best sustainable running shoes you can buy. The corresponding star rating you’ll see is based on our assessment of the shoe’s performance, effects on people, and effects on the planet. You can see the full analysis behind each assigned rating down below.\n\nAllbirds (⭐️3.5) — Best for Casual Runners ($135) – TOP PICK\n\nVivobarefoot (⭐️3.7) — Best Barefoot Trail Running Shoes ($190) – TOP PICK\n\nHylo (⭐️3.7) — Best Sustainable Running Shoes for the Gym and Casual Wear ($135) – TOP PICK\n\nVeja (⭐️4) — All Vegan Running Shoe ($170) – TOP PICK\n\nEcoAlf (⭐️2.8) — Most Affordable Sustainable Running Shoe ($129)\n\nIceBug (⭐️3) — Best Overall Trail Running Shoes ($169.95)\n\nBrooks (⭐️2.7) — Best for Heel Strikers ($140)\n\nOn Running (⭐️2.7) — Most Comfortable Sustainable Running Shoe ($179.99)\n\nAllbirds: Tree Dasher 2\n\nBest for the Casual Runners\n\nHeel Drop: 7mm | Weight: 10.3 oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAllbirds co-founder Tim Brown was inspired by merino wool in New Zealand as an alternative to synthetic materials. He teamed with renewables expert and engineer Joey Zwillinger to create wool fabric for shoes.\n\nAllbirds offers additional runners, but we’ll focus on the Allbirds Tree Dasher 2. If you’re interested in other styles of Allbirds shoes, check out our complete Allbirds Review, here.\n\nIn our experience, the Tree Dasher 2s are best made for short runs and active casual wear.\n\nWe tested these on hikes, walks, and runs of varying distances. The traction on the Dasher 2s is excellent and performed well on hiking trails and making quick movements on pavement/courts.\n\nThe fit on these Dashers is a little snug and can feel at times clunky. These are one of the heavier pairs of runners that we’ve listed here. With this fit, our testers came to prefer other runners for longer distances. In our opinion, these shoes are best made for those looking for an active casual shoe to wear around day-to-day on walks and hikes, or even to the tennis/pickleball court with friends. For those looking for a purer, higher mileage running shoe, we might recommend considering a different option on this list.\n\nAllbirds is cutting edge with their transparency and commitment to making the world’s most sustainable shoe line, the Tree Dasher 2s are no different. Allbirds lists in detail the materials used to make the shoe (eucalyptus tree fiber, sugarcane, natural rubber, merino wool, castor bean oil, among others). As well, Allbirds has made the point to calculate the exact carbon footprint of the shoe and display that on the box (10.7 kg CO2e). Allbirds is also a Certified Climate Neutral company, meaning, they offset all emissions they have yet to reduce through certified carbon projects.\n\nWe would however like that Allbirds incorporates a specific end-of-life plan for their products in the near future.\n\nIn our view, Allbirds lacks some transparency into their supply chain. While we are made aware of where the shoes are produced (Vietnam), we aren’t given great detail as to what the working conditions are.\n\nAll this considered together, we do believe that the Allbirds Tree Dasher 2s are one of the best options for sustainable runners out there now and hope to see the company make ground on those key labor/end-of-life components.\n\n→ $135 – Allbirds.com or find an Allbirds store near you,here\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n*This review here has been consolidated, as our full review of the Allbirds Tree Dasher 2s can be found below.\n\nRead Review: Allbirds Tree Dasher 2\n\nVivobarefoot: Primus Trail Knit\n\nBest Barefoot Trail Running Shoes\n\nHeel Drop: 0 | Weight: 8.82 oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nVivobarefoot offers great options for trail running and road running. Their shoes mimic the shape of the foot, allowing you to feel more of the ground beneath you. Vivobarefoot also backs up its health claims with scientific research. The Primus Trails are a good alternative to Nike’s Free Run shoes.\n\nPerformance\n\nUsers commonly report getting a good couple years out of their Vivos. Of course, that will depend on your frequency of use, etc\n\nIn the event that a repair is needed, Vivo offers a refresh, reconditioning, or revive option through its ReVivo repair service.\n\nComfort:\n\nThe Primus Trail Knit only goes down to a size 7 (40 EU) for men. Women’s sizes go to US 5.5.\n\nDon’t expect to lace up and go for a 5-mile run off the bat. Running “barefoot” isn’t for beginners. Your ankles and feet need practice.\n\nThese shoes are really for the barefoot believers. If you think that barefoot shoes might be a lifestyle for you, then, yes, these are a great option.\n\nBut! You need to be committed to it. It’s a journey. You have to get comfortable with barefoot shoes first before expecting to buy runners and take off from the start.\n\nIf you do, you’ll be painfully sore at best, at worst cause injury.\n\nBut, if you’re up for sticking it out and follow the regimen recommended by the brand, then these shoes are extremely comfortable.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nVivobarefoot’s goal is to become a regenerative business. With a 99-page report, the company prides itself on radical transparency. Fully leaning into the idea that sustainability exists on a spectrum, they call their report “Unfinished Business.”\n\nThe report includes a breakdown of how many products were revived through their Revivo program, a list of this year’s failures (including figuring out if selling on Amazon is right for the brand), and a map of its supply chain.\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nAs of 2020, 85% of shoes were made by one supplier, who was not the owner of the factory, which limited communication on labor practices.\n\nThe good news: Vivobarefoot is shifting to a new vendor to open lines of communication and promote accountability.\n\nContribution:\n\nVivobarefoot hopes to pioneer this concept of regeneration and sustainability far beyond their own company. Their Livebarefoot Fund invests in biomechanics research, indigenous shoemaking, regenerative innovation, education, and advocacy.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nPrimus Trail Knits are vegan/animal-free as defined by the company.\n\nWhile the product description lists “recycled materials” and “natural materials,” it doesn’t provide a full breakdown or percentage like we’ve seen in other sustainable running shoes.\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nVivobarefoot prevents returns by allowing customers to take a photo of their foot to determine the right size prior to purchase.\n\nWhenever they can, Vivobarefoot tries to select resources that are close to factories to limit emissions. In their Unfinished Business report, they list greenhouse gas emission as a key area for improvement. As of their last report, they’re still in the process of collecting their emissions data.\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nThrough Revivo, its shoe repair service, Vivobarefoot sets out to prevent shoes from ending up in the landfill. For now, as of spring 2022, the program is only available in the UK.\n\nIn 2019, Vivobarefoot created a product assessment, evaluating the product’s durability, materials, and end of life. The Primus score is 7/25 and they’re working to “build the most regenerative shoe that we can.”\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $190 – Vivobarefoot.com, or shop them on Publiclands.com\n\nHylo: Run Two\n\nBest for the Gym and Casual Wear\n\nHeel Drop: 9.5mm | Weight: 8.64 oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFounded by European football player Michael Doughty, Hylo’s goal is to provide high-performance and sustainable running shoes with a low impact on the planet. The vegan Corn Runners are made of corn fiber, organic cotton, and less than 1% polyester. Five of the ten materials are sourced within 100 miles, minimizing carbon emissions.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nComfy and versatile, Corn Runners work for everything from HIIT training to taking your dog for a walk on the beach. They’re lightweight, attractive, and great for everyday wear, going to the gym, and casual runs.\n\nBecause there’s no padding in the tongue of the shoe, they’re not as cushioned as some runners prefer.\n\nDurability:\n\nMachine washable, Corn Runners are a great concept, but these shoes aren’t as durable as you’d hope for a “sustainable” running shoe.\n\nThey start breaking up after about 5 months of consistent use, making them less sustainable than some of the other running shoes.\n\nSome positive news: the company is quick to help recycle or replace shoes and has potentially updated the product designs for greater durability.\n\nComfort:\n\nThe laces are on the stiffer side, making them less flexible to take on and off.\n\nOn the plus side, they’re pretty drafty and breathable. Perfect for a summer stroll.\n\nPeople\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nHylo has an in-depth guide to its supply chain standards, which business partners/factory owners must sign and agree to meet.\n\nThe business partners must report compliance failures, which may leave room for gaps in communication. Hylo or a third party may audit unannounced, but it isn’t clear how often.\n\nAccording to the first audit of suppliers, run by auditor Elevate, all workers are “paid correctly and above the regional average. The lowest take-home pay is 23% above the regional average.”\n\nContribution:\n\nHylo donates 1% of its net revenue to Common Goal, an organization focused on sustainability and equality.\n\nPlanet\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nThey do carbon offsets for their returns to bring them closer to carbon neutral.\n\nHylo also has a unique recycling program. When you send your shoes back, they give you a £10 Hylo Credit as a thank you.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $135﹘Hylo.com, or shop them on Sneakinpeace.com\n\nVeja: Condor 2\n\nBest All Vegan Running Shoe\n\nHeel Drop: 10mm | Weight: 10.6 oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nIn 2019, Veja shared its first ecological running shoe: the Condor. The Condor 2 is lightweight and perfect for your short daily run. Veja believes in being as transparent as possible, allowing a behind-the-scenes view into much of their business. They also make an effort to support the land and people producing their materials, paying upfront for organic cotton, and paying more than the market price for cotton and rubber.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nThese vegan running shoes aren’t for sprints or long sessions. Instead, the Condor is more for short daily runs, low-impact jogs, and quick recovery sessions.\n\nDurability:\n\nThe shoes can be cleaned using warm soapy water with a brush (not machine-washable).\n\nInsoles should hang to dry between uses.\n\nComfort:\n\nWith a 1-inch sole, the Condor is well-cushioned and has a nice squishy feel to it. But even with the added height and softness, the shoe doesn’t provide as much bounce on the pavement as you’d expect.\n\nDefinitely be sure to break these in beforehand, as they run a little small.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nVeja believes it’s better to share everything rather than keep consumers in the dark.\n\nThe company shares a cotton source map with the lifecycle of cotton—from production to spinning, weaving, and fashioning.\n\nIt also includes a list of organic cotton and natural rubber suppliers, along with a copy of the contracts with the farmer families.\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nIn 2019, Veja paid up to 50% in advance for organic cotton.\n\nThey offer twice the market price for organic cotton to provide a living wage for the farmers.\n\nRubber producers also get 220% the market price, with Veja paying R$8,00 per kg CVP (compared to R$2,50 market price).\n\nContribution:\n\nPaying upfront covers the quality of the cotton and rubber, gives families income stability, and supports forest conservation.\n\nVeja also partners with the NGO Esplar to support organic cotton producers and assist in adopting agro-ecology to enrich and protect soil.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nThe Condor’s canvas and laces are made with Brazilian and Peruvian organic cotton, eliminating the use of pesticides and protecting biodiversity.\n\nMaterials also include Amazonian rubber for the soles and recycled plastic bottles or recycled polyester.\n\nPracticing upcycling, B-mesh fabric is entirely made from plastic bottles.\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nWhen evaluating carbon emissions, Veja takes us from seed to store, sharing every piece of the supply chain and its impact. In 2019, 0.5% of emissions came from collecting and transporting raw materials and 18% came from sneaker transportation.\n\nVejas packaging is made from 80% recycled plastic, with plans to use 100% plastic-free packaging in the future.\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nShoes can be recycled in-store in Paris, Bordeaux, and New York.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $170﹘Veja.com, or pick up a pair at REI\n\nEcoAlf: Oregalf\n\nMost Affordable Sustainable Running Shoes\n\nPros & Cons\n\nThe founder of Ecoalf set out to create a sustainable fashion brand and stop using natural resources carelessly. Oregalf sneakers are durable, sustainable vegan running shoes for your everyday jogs.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nWe weren’t able to gather good information on how these shoes stood up to higher-mileage runs.\n\nDurability:\n\nFrom the information we gathered, the Oregalf is super easy to clean, even after walking in the muddy woods!\n\nComfort:\n\nWe were unable to pull sufficient user data on this shoe. Until we can get some first-hand experience, we’ll have to leave this a mystery.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nPeople, planet, and traceability are graded through BCOME, a sustainability platform helping businesses improve their supply chains and transparency. The BCOME Evaluation System allows consumers to view an overview of each product’s environmental and social impact.\n\nThe grades in the system are as follows:\n\nHIGH 0-33%\n\nADVANCED 34-66%\n\nHONORS 65-100%\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nEven with the BCOME grading system in place, transparency about farmers, manufacturers, and factory workers is lacking. Though they do list three of their third-party auditors that evaluate the supply chain.\n\nContribution:\n\nThe Ecoalf Foundation aims to “upcycle the oceans” by promoting waste recovery and collaborating with the fishing industry to clean the oceans.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nPowered by BCOME, customers get to see a sustainability report for each shoe.\n\nThe Oregalf was graded C+ for planet, C+ for people, and B+ for traceability. It also saves 0.38 kg CO2 eq and 0.16 liters of water. (Though we’re not sure compared to what? Maybe a prior model?).\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nTo remove the need for shopping bags, Ecoalf shoe boxes are made from 100% recycled cardboard and include a 100% recycled polyester strap.\n\nThey also use dye-free, recycled paper that is 100% biodegradable.\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nInstead of merely offering a standard return policy, Ecoalf takes the opportunity to educate its customers.\n\nThe company encourages customers to think twice before purchasing, as repacking and re-delivering means more carbon emissions and less sustainability.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $129﹘Ecoalf.com, or shop them at Campsaver.com\n\nIcebug: Arcus\n\nBest Overall Trail Running Shoe\n\nHeel Drop: 6mm | Weight: 8.82oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nIcebug encourages more people to get outside and enjoy nature. Their Arcus running shoe is your ideal companion for long runs on the trail.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nGreat for all temperatures, the Arcus keeps your feet dry and has a solid tread for trail running.\n\nPurchase studs if you’re planning to run in slippery or freezing conditions.\n\nDurability:\n\nWaterproof and sturdy, the Arcus can withstand tough weather conditions and last through multiple seasons tracking through mud, gravel, clay, and everything in between.\n\nComfort:\n\nThese are a little stiff on the first go. Wear these around your house or while you’re grabbing groceries to break these in before you lace up for a run.\n\nAvoid running on the road, if you can. They’re great on trails but not as comfortable on pavement.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nIcebug is in the process of pulling all of its supply chain data through the TrusTrace platform.\n\nCustomers can see the product’s journey or “Follow the Footprints” with a list of factories involved in production.\n\nIcebug doesn’t mention farmers or factory workers on their sustainability page.\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nAccording to their Sustainability Report, Icebug planned to follow up on codes of conduct and evaluate worker conditions in their supply chain, but travel restrictions due to Covid prevented further investigation.\n\nContribution:\n\nIcebug is a 1% for the Planet member, donating 1% of total sales to environmental nonprofit organizations.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nIcebug does a great job showing its carbon footprint, sharing the amount of CO2 emissions produced per shoe.\n\nThe Arcus produces 9,1 kg CO2 eqv. per pair and is made of 27% recycled materials, including 15% recycled rubber in the outsole and 100% recycled PET polyester.\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nBeginning in 2020, Icebug committed to compensating for 200% of its carbon emissions.\n\nFor most final products, Icebug chooses sea freight over air transportation to minimize carbon emissions.\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nWhile Icebug doesn’t have a recycling program in place, it does work to prevent running shoe waste in two ways:\n\nExplaining how to care for shoes, and offering tailored solutions depending on the wear and tear.\n\nProviding replacement parts (ex: laces, studs, hooks, and zipper pulls). Stud replacements are provided without charge.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $169.95﹘Icebug.com or Outlandusa.com, and Backcountry.com\n\nBrooks: Ghost 14\n\nBest for Heel Strikers\n\nMidsole Drop: 12mm | Weight: 9.9oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nBrooks recently announced its new sustainability strategy, with the goal of being carbon neutral by 2040. Ghost 14 is the company’s first carbon-neutral shoe. The company’s goal is to move to 100% recycled polyester in footwear by 2023 and share a circular performance shoe by 2030.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nGhost 14 is perfect for every day, easy and long runs on the road.\n\nThey’re not ideal for sprints. The heavyweight of the shoe makes it feel less responsive in high-speed workouts\n\nDurability:\n\nFrom our research, with a dense outsole and midsole, the Brooks Ghost can last 350-400 miles.\n\nComfort:\n\nIf you need a soft landing and tend to strike on your heels, Brooks has you covered. Ghost 14 is extra roomy in the toe box, giving you some leeway coming down hills or making quick turns.\n\nAvoid running in cold weather as the shoe stiffens in freezing temperatures.\n\nFor most runners, the shoe runs true to size or slightly larger.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nIn the transparency statement, Brooks includes a link to the supplier code of conduct and details new supplier onboarding.\n\nSuppliers are assessed by third-party auditors to confirm Brooks’ standards are met.\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nAt onboarding, suppliers must agree to be transparent about working hours and payroll. Like many other brands, Brooks doesn’t appear to publish the pay or working hours of suppliers/factory workers.\n\nIt’s important to note that product assembly factories are required to complete a social compliance assessment, but we’re not sure if it’s a third-party or self-assessment.\n\nThe good news: one factory didn’t pass the audit in 2020, so they parted ways.\n\nContribution:\n\nIn 2020, Brooks donated over 35,000 shoes to healthcare workers.\n\nOn its recycle page, Brooks also links to Soles4Souls as an option for donating used shoes.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nThe carbon emissions of the Ghost 14 are 10.34 kg CO₂e. Brooks partners with ClimateCare to offset Ghost 14’s carbon emissions.\n\nAbout 20% of the upper materials are recycled.\n\nThere is no listing of what materials are used or where the raw materials are sourced from.\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nOne perk for consumers is the ability to take Brooks shoes for a 90-day test run.\n\nHowever, what does this policy mean for the planet? What does returning in 90-days look like in terms of extra plastic/paper/packaging, and carbon emissions? Something to consider.\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nFor now, recycling is the closest we can get to biodegradable running shoes. Thankfully, most Brooks stores provide the option to recycle your shoes.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $140﹘Brooksrunning.com or pick up a pair at REI\n\nOn: Cloudultra\n\nMost Comfortable Sustainable Running Shoes\n\nHeel-Toe Drop: 8mm | Weight: 8.64oz\n\nPros & Cons\n\nBased in Switzerland, On offers a collection of performance running shoes. With a bouncy superfoam and a snug fit, the Cloudultra shoe brings soft landings perfect for long-distance runners.\n\nIn summer 2022, they have plans to launch the Cyclon Cloudneo. A fully recyclable, circular shoe.\n\nPerformance\n\nBest Use:\n\nThe Cloudultra is a versatile running shoe perfect for trail running, rolling hills, and hiking.\n\nIf you’re looking to regulate your temperature and stay dry, the Cloud Ultra has breathable and ventilated mesh, making it ideal for those warm summer runs.\n\nDurability:\n\nOne downside to the Cloudultra is it’s not waterproof. Whether it’s misting outside or you’re running the day after a storm, you need to be careful with these.\n\nComfort:\n\nIf you want some extra cushion, the Cloudultra is a great option.\n\nBut, it is a tighter fit, so we’d recommend buying a half size up to ensure appropriate sizing.\n\nPeople\n\nTransparency:\n\nWith a list of locations and number of workers at each spot, On Running is on its way to transparency.\n\nHowever, the only mention of the people behind the product is a mention of “team spirit.”\n\nLabor Practices:\n\nThere are no specific details about wage or factory safety, save for a link to their supplier code of conduct.\n\nOn Running does an initial assessment of factories, followed by visiting the production site several times a year. It’s not clear if visits are by On staff or a third party.\n\nOn does acknowledge an overtime problem in the fashion industry, and commits to forecast in advance to “prevent excessive overtime.”\n\nContribution:\n\nOn sponsors the Athlete Refugee Team.\n\nPlanet\n\nMaterials:\n\nThe total recycled content is about 5%, including 20% recycled polyester.\n\nWith inorganic cotton and rubber, we wonder what the full environmental impact is of using these materials.\n\nThe company is working to integrate 100% certified organic cotton and 100% mulesing-free wool.\n\nFor now, it meets an important sustainability goal: using vegan fabrics.\n\nShipping & Packaging:\n\nOn Running rebranded to protect the planet. It moved away from all-black ink packages, saving at least 7 tonnes of black ink each year (a substance that can lead to soil and water pollution). The company also switched to 100% recycled shoe boxes, saving:\n\n18 tonnes of paper\n\n15 tonnes of plastic\n\n160 tonnes of CO2\n\nEnd of Life:\n\nFrom our research, we couldn’t find any consideration for the end of life of Cloudultra. However, the upcoming Cyclon Cloudneo subscription will allow customers to return shoes for recycling.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\n→ $179.99﹘On-running.com or shop them at Backcountry, BSTN, and END\n\nFAQ: What Makes a Sustainable Running Shoe?\n\nSustainability exists on a spectrum. Here are the three main categories we assessed to define what makes a running shoe sustainable.\n\n1. Performance (Product)\n\nFor shoes (or any product) to be sustainable, they must serve their purpose. Is it a good running shoe?\n\nOf course, “good” is in the eye of the beholder. We look at three main categories to evaluate a sustainable running shoe’s performance: comfort, best use, and durability.\n\nComfort\n\nComfort depends on what you’re looking for. Do you want extra cushion? Bounce? Are you hoping for extra room in the toe box?\n\nDo your best to know your running shoe preferences before making a purchase. Check your foot type (ex: arch vs. flat) so you can make the right choice depending on your needs. It’ll limit your need to return or exchange, and, in turn, minimize your carbon footprint.\n\nBest Use\n\nDoes the shoe work best on paved roads or bumpy trails? Does it provide stability and motion control, depending on the terrain? We provide a variety of options so you can select the running shoe that works with your own running routine.\n\nDurability\n\nThe easiest way to make a product more sustainable is to make sure it has the longest useful life possible. Are the shoes washable? Will they break down in a few months or will they last for years?\n\nRunning is a high-impact activity, so we’re all too aware no running shoe will last forever. What’s important is that your shoe can travel the distance with you.\n\n2. People (Ethics)\n\nWe evaluate each company based on its transparency, labor practices, and give-back programs (or community contribution).\n\nTransparency\n\nHow easy is it for us to gather information on the where/how/who of production?\n\nIs the company open about its sourcing, production, and labor practices? Or is information super hard to find?\n\nLabor\n\nHow are the workers behind the products treated?\n\nWe want to know:\n\nWhat wages are they paid?\n\nAre working conditions safe?\n\nIs the information verified by someone other than the brand themselves?\n\nContribution\n\nDoes the company have a charitable giving program?\n\nIt’s important to approach companies’ claims with skepticism. While there isn’t tight regulation on sustainability claims or the global labor supply chain, it’s our job to do our due diligence.\n\nSustainable running shoe companies should:\n\nShare the people behind the product\n\nDisclose its farm and factory locations\n\nAcknowledge where there are gaps or areas of growth\n\nAgain, if the information is missing, it should give you pause.\n\nCompany “codes of conduct” are a good start, but they don’t tell us the full story. We also want to go beyond pictures and stories of workers and factories. Are working conditions safe? Are farmers and factory workers provided a living wage?\n\n3. Planet (Sustainability)\n\nWe’re constantly working to define what sustainability means. We’re especially curious about circularity—does the company consider the land and materials required for production? Does a product’s end of use lead to a landfill or are there ways to repair, recycle, or rewear?\n\nWhen evaluating running shoes, we look at materials, shipping and packaging, and end of life.\n\nMaterials\n\nWhat raw materials do they use? Do they limit their use of plastic (ex: polyester or other synthetic fibers)?\n\nWe also look at how production impacts the environment. Do they protect biodiversity by using organic materials? Does the company offset its carbon emissions from production/transportation?\n\nShipping and Packaging\n\nDoes the company use recyclable packaging? Limit its use of dyes and inks?\n\nWhat about transportation? Do they lean fully on air transportation, or opt for a more sustainable option (like ship freights or keeping farms and factories local to each other)?\n\nEnd of Life/Circularity\n\nDoes the company take responsibility for a product’s end of life? Do they offer a recycling program?\n\nIn searching for the most sustainable running shoe, look for products with:\n\nCarbon offsets or carbon neutrality\n\nRecyclable and/or circular materials\n\nOrganic and/or vegan materials\n\nMinimal/no use of plastic in shipping and packaging\n\nHow We Assess Products & Companies\n\nSustainability is a journey. Year after year, companies we regard as leaders in their respective categories are still finding ways to reduce, offset, and reverse their negative impacts.\n\nWe see sustainability on a spectrum. No companies or singular products are completely “sustainable,” but some are more sustainable than others. Our Buy Ensemble content exists to make finding sustainable and better-for-the-world products easier for you.\n\nIn evaluating brands and products, we look at three categories:\n\nPerformance\n\nPeople (Ethics)\n\nPlanet (Sustainability)\n\nOur priority is to share honest and objective evaluations of sustainable products. Learn more about our review process here.\n\nWe do want to stress (and we communicate this with any/all brands), the exchange of products does not and cannot influence our reviews.\n\nHave you had experience with any of these products or companies?\n\nIs there something we missed? Send us a message or leave a comment below. We want our reviews to evolve as we learn more information from our own experience, your experience, and further research."
