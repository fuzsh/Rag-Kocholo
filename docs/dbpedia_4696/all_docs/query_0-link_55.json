Newton Running products were conceived and designed by Danny Abshire through his experience as a runner and designer of lightweight custom orthotics. Working with elite athletes, Danny dreamed of creating a shoe that would help runners of all levels get back to natural running techniques. Danny has been a running coach and the Director of Biomechanics and Injury Prevention for Multisports.com since 1993. He is also a consultant with the Lydiard Foundation and received his Pedorthic training from Northwestern University. Danny not only is an avid runner but also enjoys art, camping and spending time with his wife Jennifer, who manages the Newton Running Lab, and his two sons.\n\nWhere did the idea for Newtons begin?\n\nAre there different types or styles of a running shoe like a Newton?\n\nWhat type of distances and speeds would that type of shoe be designed for?\n\nAre there injury risks or precautions that people should be aware of if they are switching from a non-Newton shoe?\n\nShould people put orthotics in a shoe like Newton?\n\nDo you support the use of barefoot running?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSpecial Announcements:\n\n-The first BenGreenfieldFitness Inner Circle podcast was released this week!

Even if I stretch my quads a little first, this still happens. What could be causing this, and what can I do to alleviate it?\n\nAshley asks: I 29 years old and have been running for 10 years. I have run 1 half marathon, and had hopes of running a full marathon, but this past spring I was diagnosed with ITB and Runner's knee. This derailed my running plan to say the least. I worked diligently with a PT and strengthened my quads, and glutes. I also started incorporating a lot of stretching and using the foam roller. My ITB and knee are great now, my latest issue is Plantar Fasciitis. I have never had foot pain before and I am frustrated that my body keeps putting up road blocks preventing me from running. I am a vegetarian and eat very little dairy, I am diligigent about taking my daily multi-vitamin, D, Flax Seed oil, C, as well as Magnesium, Calcium and Zinc. Since the PF has come up I have been rolling my foot and icing it as well as stretching my foot. Can you suggest anything else I could do? Thanks for your help.\n\nIn my response to Ashley, I recommend the free Muscle Imbalances Revealed report and also the podcast #97 interview with Tom Vachet.\n\nMat asks: Do you think longer consistent sleep is more important than total hours(should I get up an hour later and forego my work nap)?\n\nYou can take the deep sleep sheep test by clicking here.\n\nMat asks: I spend at least 4.5hours everyday in the car,is there anything I can do in that time,other than listen to your podcast,that will help me achieve my fitness goals? I've heard you suggest jumping jacks every hour but that would just prolong my journey time….you did mention ‘powerbreath' recently,is there anything else of a similar nature that could be used whilst driving?\n\nKim asks: My friend and I have been discussing the right time to take Vitamin B-12. We are both vegan and take a Vitamin B-12 supplement as well as Chlorella, which has a high amount of Vitamin B-12. My first question is: Should we be taking this much Vitamin B-12?\n\nSecondly, she recently underwent some blood work which showed her B-12 to be low. We have read that Vitamin C blocks Vitamin B-12 when taken at the same time, so we avoid taking both together. However, we were wondering that since most of the food we consume consists of Vitamin C, is it possible that it is blocking the Vitamin B-12 we supplement in our diet? And, if so, how do we get around that?\n\nListener Robert asks: I have been told newly caffeine has a huge impact on adrenal gland since those are all the time “provoked” so that some time they no longer are able to fulfill their mission, plus ongoing high adrenal level in the body, in general, has unwished impacts on the body either way. What’s your take on that matter, and how far may I go [mg of caffeine on daily basis]. Is there any proven evidence backing this up or merely another uprising hysteria?\n\nLee asks: If you get the chance, would you mind having a look at this supplement, Vital Greens? http://www.vitalgreens.com/ I am unable to get some of the supplements you mention here in Australia and wondered what you get from the ingredients list on the site.\n\nIn my response to Lee, I mention Enerprime (pictured right). Go here: http://www.pacificfit.net/supplements.php#enerprime\n\nListener Jeff asks: I'm taking up aqua jogging to overcome a tenacious bout of plantar fasciitis. I'm a runner and begin marathon training in late November. I want to knock out this demon for good and stay off the roads until I do. I'm sustituting two indoor cycling classes per week, 2-3 swims per week and now aqua jogging. The Speedo belt and aqua shoes are enroute from Swim Outlet.com. I'll be in the pool with a free range of motion (that is, not touching the pool bottom). Can you recommend some aqua jogging workouts?"
