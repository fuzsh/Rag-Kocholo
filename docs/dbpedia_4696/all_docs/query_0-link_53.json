        "text": "As fall marathon season unfolds, tens of thousands of runners thud along trails across the country.\n\nSquint, and the races look like bags of tropical Skittles, or perhaps an outtake from a lost 1980s music video. Hello, neon. It is everywhere this year.\n\nFlip through a shoe catalog, browse the shelves of a running store or check out the winding roads of Central Park’s jogging paths, and you are likely to see eye-popping running gear brightening an otherwise staid sport.\n\nAlison Feller, 28, ran the New York City Marathon this year in head-to-toe electric tangerine gear. “It’s totally silly and fun to wear,” she said."
