        "text": "Running has become one of the most practiced sports on the planet and gets more followers year after year. Given humanity’s propensity for personal well-being and quality of life, outdoor running has become more popular and currently attracts many amateur athletes around the world.\n\nThis fever for running has not escaped the big sports brands and marked a new fierce competition to capture a huge market around the world: shoes, clothing and accessories for this sport from Adidas, Nike and other firms. brands have resorted to advancements in technology to provide maximum possible comfort to the users while running, as well as other important aspects in the sport such as improving the weight of the shoe and the possibility of avoiding injuries and improving the technique depending on the design.\n\nNot only has aesthetics been important in design, but runners are looking for shoes which allow them to travel great distances, without adding additional effort due to the weight, and which primarily avoids injuries. Designers, backed by technology, have been in charge of studying different types of footprints to better adapt the product to the needs of the runner.\n\nThe first difference that brands take into account for design is gender. A women’s running shoe is narrower, more flexible and has less cushioning, as the female foot has greater flexing capacity and carries less body weight. Opposite of this, are men’s running shoes, which are wider in the heel area, are less flexible and have more cushioning to support the higher weight. For example, adidas men’s sneakers feature Boost technology, which was developed to provide energy back to the feet after hitting the ground. The Adidas Innovation Team (AIT) enlisted the help of a group of German chemists to manufacture expanded thermoplastic polyurethane, which allows the brand to position itself among one of the most popular.\n\nBiomechanics is the study of body motion, taking into account structure and function, and this is perhaps the most important aspect when choosing sports shoes that allow for long hours of training and competition. Biomechanics aims to improve movement techniques based on scientific knowledge, for which it uses technological advances that provide measurement and characterization of the human body. Based on this study, it is possible to design items that can improve the technique of athletes, in this specific case, runners or runners. For some time now, running shoe design has been divided into three main categories: supine, neutral and prone, based on the footprint of each user.\n\nThe supine or supinator tread is one in which the person has a very pronounced plantar arch and causes an outward bending of the ankle, so the area of ​​greatest impact is outside the base of the foot. The pronator tread is one that is made up of the inner part of the foot, which brings the knees together. This type of walking can also lead to plantar fasciitis and calluses on the bottom of the foot. Neutral walking is best because body weight is compensated by the base of the entire foot. Here the wounds are significantly reduced compared to the other two.\n\nFor all cases of footfall, brands have invested in technological advances to compensate for the difficulties runners face and improve performance based on their shoe design. These advances ultimately lead athletes who want healthy lives without injuries, whether elite or amateur, to continue to choose the brand with which they practice their races.\n\nOne of our amazing partner with the Buckhead Run Club, Road Runner Sports, can help you get the perfect running shows just for you.
