        "text": "There is no ONE best running shoe\n\nAll feet are unique and even some of the best-rated running shoes might not work for you specifically.\n\nBut the good news is that the running footwear market is so saturated that you are sure to find a shoe that would feel tailor-made for your feet!\n\nIn this guide, we break down the most important considerations to help you narrow down the choices and find that perfect pair.\n\nWhere to start: road vs. trail running shoes\n\nThis one is simple: If you mostly run on asphalt, tarmac, treadmill, 4x4 road, or even major forest trails or the likes, then buy road running shoes.\n\nOnly buy trail running shoes if you run on single trails or off trails. Otherwise, you don’t need them.\n\nRoad running shoes\n\nSome road shoes can also be used for light-to-moderate trails. Just make sure that they have thick and sturdy rubber outsoles.\n\nOutsole durability shows how deep was the damage caused by 22 seconds of drilling the shoe’s rubber with a Dremel at 10K RPM speed.\n\nTrail running shoes\n\nYou should not be afraid to run on roads with your trail running shoes once in a while. Quite often, you’d need to run up to a mile before you get to your nearest trail, and that is not a problem. However, we recommend that you keep it at a minimum as feet and knees can start to hurt.\n\nThe bigger the lugs, the sooner your feet will start hurting. For road-to-trail shoes, lugs below 3 mm are best.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you mostly run off trails, in the wild, with mud caking up under your feet within minutes, you must get a trail shoe with deeper lugs. They will keep you surefooted by biting into the ground more aggressively. They also tend to be more spaced-out to shed off the mud while running.\n\nKey differences between road and trail shoes\n\nOutsole: Road shoes have flatter and pavement-ready soles. Trail shoes have lugs (tread patterns), for better traction on uneven terrain.\n\nProtection: Most trail shoes are equipped with rugged toe bumpers and rock plates to keep the runner’s feet protected from various terrain challenges.\n\nWeight: Because of the added ruggedness and protection, trail shoes are on average an ounce heavier than road shoes.\n\nUpper: Road shoes have lighter, more breathable uppers because road races don’t have any obstacles. Trail shoes are reinforced with various protective elements, including additional layers in high-wear areas, which makes them less breathable.\n\nBased on our in-house ventilation tests, the average breathability score of road shoes is 4 out of 5, while the average of trail shoes is 3 out of 5.\n\nUse: The most important factor\n\nA beginner-friendly trainer is going to be vastly different from a carbon-plated marathon race shoe. Let’s take a closer look at the main running shoe categories based on their intended use.\n\nDaily running shoes (also best for beginners and daily wear)\n\nWell-cushioned and comfort-loaded, daily trainers make up the majority of running shoes on the market. This is where you find that go-to daily beater that never fails.\n\nWe highly recommend shoes from this category to beginner runners as they meet the following criteria:\n\nwell-cushioned (at least 30 mm of heel stack)\n\naverage heel-to-toe drop (8-14 mm, ideal for a beginner’s heel-striking pattern)\n\nbalanced softness (neither too firm nor mushy)\n\nno carbon plates or aggressive rockers\n\nMSRP of $140 or less\n\nCan you wear daily running shoes for everyday use? Absolutely! The characteristics mentioned above make this footwear category ideal for spending long hours on your feet.\n\nSome daily trainers have features of speed-oriented shoes. These are more expensive but let you have two pairs in one.\n\nSpeed training/tempo running shoes\n\nLighter than daily trainers, this category is better equipped for picking up the pace or even setting a new speed record.\n\nThe average weight of speed shoes is 2.4 oz (68g) lighter than the average of daily trainers!\n\nDaily trainers Speed trainers Average weight 10.0 oz (283g) 7.6 oz (216g)\n\nSpeed training shoes also tend to have bouncier foams and springier rides. Some of them even use stiff carbon plates for added propulsion. You can learn more about how plates work in our extensive research.\n\nSome speed trainers can also be used for daily training or even competitions.\n\nRace/competition running shoes\n\nThis is where you find the world-record-shattering Nike Vaporfly’s and Alphafly’s, Adidas’s buzzworthy $500 Evo 1, among other iconic shoes.\n\nThe lightest of running shoes (7.5 oz/213g on average), these racers feature the brands’ most cutting-edge technologies to help you achieve the most efficient performance.\n\nFor professional runners, choosing the perfect race shoe gets even more complicated. But it is our mission to help you sort that out. Explore our meticulous guides on foams, carbon plates, rockers, and shoe uppers to get more insights.\n\nConsider the distance as well\n\nA 5K/10K race calls for a much faster pace than a marathon. Your best companion here is a light and springy trainer. Depending on your preference, you can choose between a classic minimally cushioned flat and a super soft and plated maximalist shoe.\n\nGoing for a marathon or even an ultra marathon? Make sure you're packed with plenty of cushioning, lasting underfoot support, and a perfect fit.\n\nSome super shoes are so versatile, they can be effective for both 5K and 42K.\n\nCushioning and ride in running shoes\n\nThat slab of foam in between your foot and the ground is what ultimately makes or breaks a running shoe. Getting the following parameters right will guarantee your comfort and best performance:\n\nstack height\n\nheel-to-toe drop\n\nfoam softness\n\npresence of a carbon plate\n\npresence of a rocker\n\nStack height in running shoes\n\nStack height refers to the amount of material in between your foot and the ground. We cut each tested shoe in half in our lab to measure its heel and forefoot stack heights following the rules set by World Athletics (at 12% and at 75% of the inside length of the shoe).\n\nFor beginners, we recommend going for heel height in the 28-35 mm range. These shoes are neither too flat (low to the ground) nor too high.\n\nIf you need tons of cushioning, go for the 35-40 mm range. Keep in mind that 40 mm is the maximum heel stack allowed for competitions by the World Athletics. Anything above means disqualification.\n\nSome seasoned runners also prefer to go down the minimalist and even barefoot path. These shoes have a heel stack of 20 mm or less and require an adaptation period as they activate different biomechanics.\n\nStill not sure which one to choose? We have developed a tool to help you find out which stack height is perfect for your running needs.\n\nHeel-to-toe drop in running shoes\n\nIf you’re new, or if you run less than 10 miles per week, there’s no need to know about heel-to-toe drop as long as you buy shoes with at least 6 mm drop (preferably 8-12 mm).\n\nThe only exception is if you have a record of severe ankle, knee, hip, ITB, Achilles, or plantar fasciitis injuries. In such cases, seek out a specialist before buying running shoes.\n\nMore experienced runners tend to show interest in the heel-to-toe drop. There are a lot of opinions on the subject. If you want to learn more, check our in-depth scientific guide to heel-to-toe drop.\n\nHeel drop effects\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nThe lower the drop, the greater the potential to improve cadence. Foot switch is slower in higher drop shoes. Lower and zero drop shoes promote midfoot and forefoot strike. A higher drop allows for rearfoot strike because the elevated heel helps with high impacts when the heel hits the ground. Lower heel drop might help with ITB, (anterior) knee pain, gluteal overuse syndrome. Higher heel drop might help with plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy (stiff Achilles), calf injuries. Low drop shoes allow for more ankle flexion during landing. The ankle absorbs the impact and works as a spring. These shoes can place greater stress on the foot, ankle, lower leg. High drop has a higher knee flexion moment. This means it has the potential to load hips and knees more, similar to heel strike. Overstriding rearfoot strike might be prevented with a lower drop. Overstriding forefoot strike might be prevented with a higher drop.\n\nFoam softness\n\nAs a beginner runner, you want a balanced type of cushioning that's neither too plush nor firm. These shoes also work for most runners, walking a fine line between comfort and performance. This type of cushioning is used in the \"workhorse\" shoes used for daily running, tempo runs, and racing.\n\nTo help you know exactly how soft each running shoe is, we use an HA durometer in our lab to measure foam softness. The lower the number on the tool, the softer the foam. The average durometer measurement for running shoes hovers around 25 HA.\n\nSofter shoes offer maximum impact protection and are usually high-stacked. They are best for long runs, recovery runs, marathons, and ultras.\n\nExample of a very plush foam (9.8 HA)\n\nLower-stacked and aggressive-looking, firmer shoes are best for quick transitions. Studies show that greater midsole hardness in running shoes results in shorter contact time. But keep in mind that there is much less shock absorption here than in soft shoes. On the bright side, firmer shoes tend to be stable enough to double as gym shoes.\n\nExample of a very firm foam (34.4 HA)\n\nIf you want more data-backed insights into choosing between soft and firm cushioning, see our in-depth guide on the topic. Especially if you're wondering how shoe foams behave in the freezer!\n\nCarbon-plated running shoes\n\nIf you are a beginner runner, we recommend staying away from carbon-plated shoes for now. These shoes are most beneficial for races and speed training as they are intended for maintaining faster paces.\n\nFirst introduced in the Nike Vaporfly in 2016, carbon plates changed the running shoe game forever. Since then, every men's and women's record on every distance has been broken by runners wearing plated shoes.\n\nAt least 5% of running shoes on the market today feature some variation of a plate.\n\nA stiff carbon plate is sandwiched inside the midsole to add propulsion upon take-off. Kind of like a swimming pool springboard.\n\nWe dive deeper into the topic of carbon-plated shoes in our extensive guide backed by science and our own lab findings.\n\nWhat is arch support and why it matters\n\nIf you've never heard about arch support, your ankles don't collapse inwards, and shoes don't have a tendency to wear out more on the inner side, then you can probably skip this section.\n\nArch support is only necessary when you have flat feet, overpronation, or other foot conditions that call for supportive components in running shoes (like plantar fasciitis). The latter are also called stability shoes.\n\nYou can see the difference in foot and ankle stability between a neutral shoe (above) and a stability shoe (below) in our lateral movement test.\n\nHere are a few rough guidelines:\n\nIf you don’t know anything particular about your feet, buy neutral running shoes.\n\nIf you have a moderate arch and neutral pronation, buy neutral running shoes.\n\nIf you have a high arch, consider neutral running shoes.\n\nIf you have a moderate arch, buy stability running shoes.\n\nTo determine pronation, look at your used footwear - do you wear them evenly? If they’ve been worn more on the outer sides, you’re underpronating. If they’ve been worn more on the inner sides, you’re overpronating. Even wear means neutral pronation.\n\nIf you want to know everything about arch support in running shoes, you must check out our in-depth guide.\n\nBefore we can recommend a stability running shoe, we perform a series of tests and measurements to assess its supportive capacity:\n\ntorsional stiffness (higher rigidity = better support)\n\nheel counter stiffness (higher rigidity = firmer heel hold)\n\nmidsole width (extended contact points prevent the foot from rolling over)\n\nChoosing the right size and fit in running shoes\n\nIf it's been a while since you last purchased a running shoe, we highly recommend measuring your foot length from scratch.\n\nToo busy for that? Grab an athletic shoe that fits you the best and enter its CM or MM size (i.e. 260, 265, etc.) into this shoe size converter.\n\nGoing with the shoe size you think you have is a risky strategy as every brand has a different size chart. Even within the same brand, the right size for you may vary from one model to another.\n\nSo once you have your precise foot length measurement, do consult the corresponding brand size chart.\n\nIn addition to size (length), you must also consider your future shoe's fit. It must not be too tight or too loose around your heel, midfoot, or forefoot. Unfortunately, it's hard to gauge the first two when purchasing online, but we can help with the toebox fit!\n\nUsing a caliper, we measure each shoe's upper width at the widest part (near the big toe joint). We also repeat the measurement closer to the shoe's tip (where the big toe ends).\n\nHaving both measurements allows us to convey the entire toebox shape as some shoes can be wide enough at the metatarsals but taper aggressively towards the front.\n\nIf you are someone with wide feet or bunions, we recommend checking our toebox measurements before purchasing the shoe.\n\nFor more nuances on the fit of running shoes, see our guide on choosing the right toebox.\n\nConsider breathability and waterproofing\n\nA vast majority of running shoes are made with breathable mesh uppers which keep the feet fresh. Based on our smoke-pumping machine tests, 60% of running shoes have high breathability scores of 4-5 out of 5.\n\nWe assess ventilation by the amount of smoke that escapes through the upper fabric. We then also hover the shoe's half-cut upper over the light to see where most ventilation pores are concentrated.\n\nWaterproof shoes are needed in very rare cases. Only if you regularly run in rainy weather, puddles, slush, and low temperatures. Or if you have multiple creeks or streams crossing your trail. There is a good reason why only 7% of running shoes in our catalog are waterproof.\n\nFor winter, you might be just fine getting a non-waterproof pair with a lower breathability score of 1-3."
