        "text": "Lots of runners are now aware of carbon-plated running shoes and their potential benefits. Although, many runners are uncertain if they should be using carbon-plated running shoes and if they’re worth it - particularly if they’re not sure about being ‘fast’ enough for them.\n\nThis article breaks down how they work, what to look for, and if they’re right for you.\n\nWhy is there so much hype around carbon-plated running shoes?\n\nIt's highly unlikely that you'll see elite runners competing in road races in anything other than super shoes. We’re using the term ‘super shoe’, as some models feature alternative structures to plates; for example, carbon-infused rods. The reason they’re racing in these is because it’s very likely this type of running shoe is improving their running economy. In the simplest terms, improving running economy means reducing the amount of oxygen our bodies use when running at a given speed or intensity.\n\nThis benefit is not exclusive to elite runners. In fact, elite runners typically have superior biomechanics to recreational runners. It’s fair to say that carbon-plated running shoes might improve a recreational runner’s running economy to an even greater extent than they would for an elite.\n\nThis is why there’s so much excitement around them, and why so many runners are using them in half-marathons and marathons. They have the potential to unlock a new level of performance, for a wide range of running abilities. The notion that carbon-plated running shoes are only for elites is simply not true.\n\nThe tech behind carbon-plated running shoes:\n\nThe carbon-plate is only one of the factors. Arguably, the foam in super shoes is the most important part. More commonly referred to as ‘super foams’, the highly resilient materials are both exceptionally soft and very responsive. Importantly, they’re not all the same. Each brand has their own unique recipe and manufacturing process - which ultimately creates different results. The common denominator is that a super foam feels very bouncy.\n\nHaving said that, a carbon-fibre plate, or rod-like structure, serves multiple functions. First of all, super foams are extremely soft - making them inherently unstable. A stiffer structure makes the midsole more stable. Next, a carbon plate helps limit energy loss through the midsole. Finally, and most importantly, a carbon plate improves the longitudinal bending stiffness of the midsole. This creates the potential for the ‘teeter-totter effect’ to come into action.\n\nThe ‘teeter-totter effect’:\n\nWhen force is applied to the front of a curved carbon plate (as you load the front of the shoe), the opposite part of the lever (under your heel area), will go through an upward movement - which corresponds to an upward force. If the heel of the shoe lifts faster, your hips will pass over the centre of gravity faster, and this improves forward momentum. The other result is a reduction in workload at the ankle, and lower leg area; which is why many runners notice a reduction in calf discomfort in carbon-plated running shoes.\n\nWhat are the best carbon plated running shoes?\n\nThis is a good time to mention that there isn’t a ‘best’ or ‘fastest’ model. Both the stiffness and curvature of the carbon-fibre plate (or similar structure) affect the potential of the teeter-totter effect. This is why brands all use contrasting shapes and styles of carbon plates. They all have their own idea as to what’s best. However, as we’re all different, it’s impossible to create a design that works optimally for everyone. How we land and load the midsole will produce varying results. This is why you’ll hear different runners say they prefer one model over another - and vice versa.\n\nWhy do super shoes look so different?\n\nIn order for a carbon plate to work as effectively as possible, it has to be curved. This means the midsole also has to be curved, and thick enough to ‘house’ the bent structure - hence why super shoes have such chunky midsoles. World Athletics prohibits the use of midsole stacks that are higher than 40 mm in elite racing though - and this places somewhat of a ceiling on development.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped brands from innovating. The most notable model are the Nike Alphafly Road Racing Shoes, with the visible Air Zoom unit in the forefoot. Nike’s proprietary technology enhances energy return, while also creating an unmistakable silhouette.\n\nHow will they feel to run in?\n\nCarbon-plated running shoes feel very different to normal road running shoes. As mentioned earlier, the cushioning will typically feel much bouncier than what you’re used to. However, the most noticeable difference you’ll experience will be the manner in which your feet roll forward.\n\nWe noted previously that a carbon-fibre plate increases the longitudinal bending stiffness of the midsole. One of the benefits of this is that it reduces the mechanical energy lost at the metatarsophalangeal joints. This is the junction between your toes and longer foot bones (metatarsals). The way this impacts the transition from landing to take-off can feel like quite a new experience at first. A lot of runners simply can’t believe how much easier this makes it to run faster, and maintain a given pace.\n\nDo carbon-plated running shoes feel stable?\n\nOn the whole, super shoes don’t feel as stable as traditional running shoes. However, they work in a very different way. When you’re running faster (relative to your slower to steady paces), the midsoles should typically feel stable and supportive. The main thing to watch out for is around corners, as the higher-stacked midsoles can feel less stable.\n\nIf you run in stability running shoes, you can run in carbon-plated running shoes. It’s just likely that some models may work better for you than others, due to the way the midsoles are shaped. For example, some super shoes feature wider plates than others, making them more stable and supportive underfoot.\n\nHow to pick the right ones for you?\n\nFit is one of the most important areas to consider when it comes to super shoes. The shape and feel can be very different from one model to another. Trying them on and seeing which ones feel most comfortable is a great start to finding the right ones.\n\nAlthough stability is not the most important part, it can be helpful to find out which models compliment your gait most effectively. Especially if you’re using them for longer distance events, such as marathons.\n\nWhy can’t you run in carbon-plated running shoes all the time?\n\nThere’s a few reasons why this isn’t a good idea. Firstly, super shoes are not very durable. This is because the features which would make them more durable would reduce energy return and performance. Saving them for race day means you’ll get the most out of them.\n\nNext, you’ll probably start to notice less of a benefit if you run in them too much. Yes, you want to get used to them; but saving them for race day means you’re more likely to experience maximum benefits.\n\nFinally, plated shoes are likely to transfer more load higher up your kinetic chain - around your upper hamstring and glute. Running in them too much could lead to overuse problems in these areas. Our article When should you run in super shoes? explains more about this.\n\nWhat does this all mean for you?\n\nWe hope this article has helped break down how carbon-plated running shoes work, that there isn’t a ‘fastest’ model, and that they have potential benefits for anyone who wants to run faster. And that’s the key, if your aim is to run faster - whether it’s in a 10K or marathon - carbon-plated running shoes can help you. Traditional running shoes simply cannot offer the same benefits as super shoes.\n\nFurthermore, a considerable number of runners find that super shoes reduce the amount of muscle soreness they experience after running hard. This is yet to be backed up by sound scientific research, but it’s very likely this is one of the benefits you’ll notice. This has benefits for life and your training routine.\n\nYes, they’re expensive. However, if you save them for races and key workouts, they should last a relatively long time. The potential improvement in performance is arguably one of the most cost effective advantages in sport.\n\nOur top picks:\n\nIf you’re looking for the biggest performance benefits, then it’s best to choose an option which features a very stiff plate/structure. The following models sit in this category:\n\nadidas Adizero Adios Pro\n\nNike Alphafly\n\nNike Vaporfly\n\nMizuno Wave Rebellion Pro\n\nSaucony Endorphin Elite\n\nSaucony Endorphin Pro\n\nEach brand also produces models which are known as super trainers. These feature similar qualities to super shoes, but they’re made with more durable materials and are more flexible. This makes them more suitable for training miles. The following models sit in in this category:\n\nAdidas Adizero Boston\n\nNike Zoom Fly\n\nMizuno Neo Vista\n\nSaucony Endorphin Speed\n\nJournal article updated 7th June 2024."
