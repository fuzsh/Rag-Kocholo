        "text": "Anyone who runs on a treadmill knows it can get really old, really fast. (They did get their humble start as prison torture devices, after all.)\n\nYou can make your treadmill workouts a bit more bearable by making yourself as comfortable as possible. A big part of comfort on a treadmill is the treadmill itself (features like deck cushioning and stride accommodation make a huge difference), but another important component is having the best running shoes for treadmill.\n\nThe right shoes can propel you to new speeds, while the wrong ones can cause blisters; eff up your foot strike; and even contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis or joint pain. Luckily, our expert product testers have slipped more than a dozen pairs of sneakers onto their feet to find the best treadmill running shoes.\n\nEnduring the “Dreadmill” So You Don’t Have To\n\nWe’ve collectively spent more hours on a treadmill than you probably even want to think about. Among five product testers, our team put more than a dozen outsoles to tread belts to find the best treadmill shoes—so you can ditch the testing process and hit the ground (er, deck) running.\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes in 2024\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes Overall: Brooks Ghost 14\n\nBest Cushioned Treadmill Running Shoes: HOKA Clifton 8\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes for Wide Feet: New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v12\n\nBest Minimalist Treadmill Running Shoes: Lululemon Chargefeel\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes for Flat Feet: Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22\n\nMost Versatile Treadmill Running Shoes: On Cloud X\n\nBest Neutral Treadmill Running Shoes: Saucony Kinvara 13\n\nBest Cross-Training Shoes for Treadmill Running:Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 39\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes Overall: Brooks Ghost 14\n\nGood for: Runners who want a durable daily trainer that will take them from sprint sessions to long-distance runs with no problem\n\nAlthough I’ve tested nearly a dozen pairs of running shoes in the last two years—and many more before that—I always end up back in a pair of Brooks Ghost shoes. These have been my go-tos since high school cross country, and I’ve probably worn my way through at least six pairs of them.\n\nI love the Ghosts because they feature neutral cushioning—not too much, not too little—and enough arch support for light assistance with pronation. They aren’t overly bouncy, but they still provide great feedback and energy return thanks to the 100% DNA LOFT (Brooks’ proprietary foam) midsole.\n\nI do think the outsole could be slightly thicker to accommodate more mileage, but for treadmill running, that shouldn’t be a problem. Wherever you wear these, you’ll appreciate the breathable knit upper and reinforced toe box.\n\nBest Cushioned Treadmill Running Shoes: HOKA Clifton 8\n\nGood for: Runners who desire extra cushioning to provide extreme shock absorption and soft landings\n\nHOKA One One is known for their ultra-cushioned running shoes, and the Clifton 8 fits that bill. Caroline Lubinsky, GGR staff writer and cardio queen, tested the HOKA Clifton 8 for this guide.\n\nHere’s what she had to say about them: “TikTok girlies go wild about these, and for good reason. If you need more cushioning, you’ll probably really enjoy these. If you’re a part of the club that believes your foot should be as close to the ground as possible and should have very little support, you’ll absolutely hate these.”\n\nHowever, she continues, “If you want a less painful way to walk or run because of arch issues or an injury, the Hoka Clifton 8 will probably serve you well.”\n\nAs for the aesthetics…They aren’t really there. “I think they look slightly dorky, but plenty of people disagree with me on that,” Caroline says. “It’s totally personal preference. The bottom of the shoes are so thick; I feel like I’m wearing orthopedic shoes.”\n\nBut, we’re not rating running shoes purely on looks. Function first!\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes for Wide Feet: New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v12\n\nGood for: Runners with wide feet who struggle to find a good pair of shoes with ample room in the toe box, midfoot, and heel\n\nIt’s tough finding good shoes for wide feet, regardless of the specific style you’re looking for. We love that New Balance offers their Fresh Foam X 880v12 in four (yes, four!) different width options: narrow, standard, wide, and extra-wide.\n\nThese are definitely a more traditional running shoe, says tester Caroline Lubinsky. “They feel well-cushioned but are a little chunky, although I must say these feel the most durable out of the shoes I tested. It likely has to do with how thick and substantial these feel.”\n\n“There are a bunch of cool colorways,” she continues, “and I think these are well-cushioned shoes. However, there isn’t anything particularly special about them. If you’re into the more minimalist running shoes, you won’t like these. If you need more support and a more comfy run, these are excellent.”\n\nCustomer reviews indicate that the New Balance Fresh Foam shoes may run small, but Caroline says they’re true-to-size.\n\nBest Minimalist Treadmill Running Shoes: Lululemon Chargefeel Mid\n\nGood for: Runners who want minimal cushioning and soft ankle support\n\nThe Chargefeels are activewear giant Lululemon’s first foray into footwear. Honestly, we didn’t have high expectations, but our product tester who wore these was pleasantly surprised.\n\n“I ended up loving these a lot more than I thought I would,” Caroline says. “I picked up the Mids, but there is also a low option. The Mids hug my ankle like my soccer cleats did, which gives them a little extra support. They’re super easy to slip on and off and look good with a lot of things.\n\nThey seem to have a propensity for blistering due to the high ankle fabric: “I would recommend wearing taller socks (not no-shows) so you don’t get a wicked blister,” Caroline deadpans.\n\nWe dubbed these “best minimalist” since the cushioning is much more moderate than other shoes on this list. With a modest 9-millimeter heel-to-toe drop and the added ankle support, the Chargefeel Mids can take you from treadmill to trail without screwing up your stride.\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes for Flat Feet: Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22\n\nGood for: Runners who need targeted cushioning to prevent overpronation and collapsing of the arch\n\nSince I’m a Brooks gal for life, I opted to test the Adrenaline GTS 22 for this guide to see if I’d like them better than my trusty Ghosts. The Adrenalines didn’t quite usurp my favorite pair of shoes, but I did really enjoy running and walking in them.\n\nThese have a bit too much cushioning in the midfoot for my liking, and I suspect that’s probably going to be the case for most runners who don’t have overpronation issues. However, if you do struggle with collapsing arches, I recommend the Adrenaline GTS 22.\n\nEquipped with a 100% DNA LOFT foam midsole, knit mesh upper, and 12-millimeter heel-to-toe-drop, these shoes help promote a natural striking and transition pattern to keep joints aligned. They also have a reinforced toe box and heel cup, as well as guide rails in the midfoot for additional support.\n\nMost Versatile Treadmill Running Shoes: On Cloud X\n\nGood for: People who want a good running shoe they can also use for other activities\n\nAs the company says, “The Cloud X is for those who refuse to define themselves by one activity.” I’m much obliged to agree, as is Kate Meier, GGR Head of Content and the runner who tested these shoes.\n\nImportantly, they “have a super springy outsole that’s cute AF.”\n\nKate says they’re ideal for anyone doing speed training, since they have some serious bounce to them. But that also makes them great for everyday activities and plyometrics. Kate has taken them from the treadmill to the coaching floor near-daily since receiving them, mainly because she loves the extra pep in her step and clean athletic look of the shoes.\n\n“They’re really comfortable without being overly cushioned,” Kate says. “They still give you some stability in case you want to use them for cross-training.”\n\nRELATED: Treadmill Buying Guide\n\nUnfortunately, the low-cut heel and ankle rub against the skin and kind of requires you to wear high socks, which Kate isn’t fond of. Also, they developed a squeak—”only when I heel-strike, which is annoying but I suppose a good reminder to land with a neutral foot.”\n\nBest Neutral Treadmill Running Shoes: Saucony Kinvara 13\n\nGood for: Runners who want something lightweight, stable, and dependable\n\nNicole, GGR editor and product tester, tried the Saucony Kinvara 13.\n\n“I love the look of these and they’re super light,” she says. “The first time I wore them, I got a HUGE blister on the back of my ankle, which was a bummer. They’re not uber cushion-y, but I think that comes down to personal preference.”\n\n“I wanted to give these a 5 out of 5 because they’re so light yet feel so supportive,” Nicole continues, “but I can’t get over the huge blister I got. It still rubs when I wear them, but it’s fine now that I’ve broken them in. I hate that I had to break in a $120 pair of shoes, though…”\n\nWe’re aware that everyone’s foot anatomy is different, so we can’t say that everyone will get blisters wearing these. We’re looking past it to focus on the phenomenal neutral cushioning and breathable knit upper, as well as the unusually small 4-millimeter heel-to-toe drop.\n\nThe Saucony Kinvara 13s are definitely designed for runners who don’t need too much support in one way or another, and people who feel confident in their typical gait. And, despite the blister, Nicole loved the sheer subtlety of these shoes: They’re an impressive blend of durable, supportive, and lightweight.\n\nBest Cross-Training Shoes for Treadmill Running: Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 39\n\nGood for: Runners who want a twofer of a running shoe and training shoe\n\nNike is known for much more than its shoes nowadays, but we’d be remiss not to include the Air Zoom Pegasus on our list. This versatile shoe is great for treadmill running and HIIT treadmill workouts alike.\n\nIt has a waffle-like outsole (not quite what you see on Vans, but Vans adjacent), and they performed well on just about every surface, including the treadmill, road, grass, and gravel.\n\nThe upper is an engineered mesh that gives extra breathability, flexibility, and durability. “I haven’t had problems on hotter days so I’d say it’s doing its job,” Anthony quips.\n\n“After about two weeks they still feel and look new,” Anthony says. “The heel tab allows me to take them on and off pretty easily (even when I don’t unlace them; don’t yell at me).”\n\nThe footing feels pretty secure, even during longer runs, he says, and they boast a lot of features that supposedly help with heel-to-toe transition—but Anthony didn’t feel a drastic difference compared to other shoes.\n\nHis bottom line? “I really like this shoe, but if I’m being honest there’s just nothing spectacular about it. If you want something that will feel supportive, keep your feet cool and comfortable, and looks good, this is it. If you’re looking for the crème de la crème, look elsewhere.”\n\nOther Treadmill Running Shoes We Researched\n\nThough the above running shoes are our top picks, we have tested many other pairs that we think are worth calling out in case they’re right for you.\n\nNOBULL Mesh Runner: Our testers generally like these as an everyday lifestyle shoe, but the upper is not very durable.\n\nNOBULL Runner+: I was not impressed with the Runner+ and felt unstable during runs, as if the shoe lurched me too far forward. However, I love them for walking and casual wear.\n\nASICS Gel-Kayano: I’ve tried a few pairs of ASICS and generally find the gel cushioning to have too much give. For people who want less feedback and energy return, I think they’re a good fit.\n\nASICS Gel-Nimbus: Ditto. The gel midsole is right for specific types of runners.\n\nASICS GT 2000 10: These feature ASICS’ FLYTEFOAM, which is different from their gel midsole material, and is much more responsive.\n\nNike Free Runs: GGR Head of Content loves her Nike Free Runs and recommends them to people looking for a lightweight, minimalist running shoe.\n\nLululemon Blissfeel: I tested these and wasn’t impressed with them for running. For walking, they’re great, but I don’t see them holding up for very long if you’re a daily runner.\n\nAdidas Ultraboost: These are some of the most expensive shoes we tested at almost $200 a pop. We think there are better options at and below that price point.\n\nHow We Picked and Tested the Best Treadmill Running Shoes\n\nAfter sifting through dozens of product listings on Amazon, and manufacturer and other retail sites, we created a shortlist of running shoes we thought could be top picks for treadmill running. From there, we sent pairs out to five product testers on our team (hello, Caroline, Anthony, Nicole, and Kate!) and spent several weeks wearing them for treadmill workouts and other goings-on.\n\nDuring testing, we judged the shoes against a variety of criteria, including:\n\nPurchasing process and delivery\n\nAesthetics/appearance\n\nSizing availability\n\nConstruction, materials, and durability\n\nMidsole contour\n\nStability and support\n\nEnergy return, responsiveness, and feedback\n\nOutsole traction\n\nCustomer reviews\n\nReturn and exchange policies\n\nValue\n\nOur testers took detailed notes on all of these factors and together, we decided on the best treadmill running shoes above.\n\nBenefits of Treadmill Running Shoes\n\nAmong fitness novices, it’s common to think that any shoe will do for any activity. Allow us to spare your joints from this mistake.\n\nBuying a pair of shoes specifically designed for a particular activity is a top way to maximize performance and limit discomfort (aside from the general discomfort that occurs when exercising, which is unavoidable if you’re pushing yourself).\n\nRunning shoes are designed the way they are in order to promote optimal foot striking, heel-to-toe transitions, joint alignment throughout the stride, and reduced joint impact.\n\nConversely, weightlifting shoes are designed to maximize ground contact, promote stability through the midfoot, and enhance barbell receiving positions. So, you certainly wouldn’t wear this type of shoe on a run—and you wouldn’t wear a running shoe to max out your clean-and-jerk, either.\n\nA good pair of running shoes, whether your primary terrain is road, trail, or treadmill, will allow you to run farther and faster for longer distances.\n\nBuying Guide: What to Look for in Treadmill Running Shoes\n\nNot quite ready to buy? No problem. Here’s some more information to help you decide on the best treadmill running shoes for you.\n\nFit, Sizing, and Comfort\n\nAvailable sizes: Obviously, you need a pair of shoes that is available in your size. Some brands, typically the larger ones, like Nike, New Balance, and Adidas, have larger size ranges.\n\nWidth options: Some shoes are only available in standard width, while other brands offer shoes in narrow, standard, wide, and extra-wide sizes.\n\nToe box: Pay particular attention to the shape of the toe box. A narrow forefoot won’t allow your toes to naturally splay, which can cause discomfort and, over time, chronic pain in the feet.\n\nMaterials and Durability\n\nUpper: Most running shoes feature a knit mesh upper for optimal breathability. If you like a pair that has something other than a knit or mesh fabric, investigate the material to see if it provides enough breathability for your liking.\n\nMidsole: The middle layer of the shoe is where the support lies. Many shoes use some type of EVA foam, but many brands have also developed proprietary foams with particular features. For example, Nike’s React foam is known for its great energy response and feedback, while Brooks’ DNA LOFT is known for its softness and shock-absorbing properties.\n\nOutsole: I’ve never known a running shoe that didn’t feature a rubber outsole. The differences, you’ll find, lie in the lug pattern and thickness of the outsole. For treadmill running, you don’t need a super thick outsole like you might for trail running.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop\n\nThis is one of the most important factors in running shoes. Generally, the bigger the heel-to-toe drop, the more cushioning a shoe has. A large heel-to-toe drop will lurch you forward, unlike a smaller drop, which provides minimal-to-moderate support.\n\nCushioning and Arch Support\n\nOverpronation: Overpronation is when your arch collapses during your stride. This is also known as flat foot syndrome. Shoes with a lot of arch support will help prevent overpronation.\n\nUnderpronation: Under pronation is when your foot overly rolls outward, so the majority of the pressure lies on the outer ridge of your foot from your pinky toe to your heel. Neutral and minimalist shoes are best for combatting underpronation. Too much arch support can exacerbate the problem.\n\nBest Treadmill Running Shoes FAQs"
