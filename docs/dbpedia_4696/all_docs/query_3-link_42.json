        "text": "Huffing and puffing along side running group buddy Denny (yes the over 6’6, 75 year old who kicks my butt), we started chatting about being the only two in the group sporting some kickin’ Hokas. He may or may not have laughed at how bright mine were as I pondered why he went with the all white option, but we both agreed they were both necessary for our running shoe rotation.\n\nAs the miles progressed and the conversation veered this way and that like the path, we found ourselves back to the topic of running shoes.\n\nBoth proclaiming that one of the keys to staying injury free was multiple pairs of running shoes!\n\nListen up, if this man can run marathons injury free at 75, for MANY YEARS on end, it’s sound advice!\n\nDo you really need an excuse to buy a new pair of running shoes??\n\nOf course.\n\nLet me help you justify it to anyone who might ask why your current plethora needs another friend {it’s like finding a stray kitten, you want to cuddle them all}.\n\nHow Many Running Shoes Should I Have?\n\nMost runners need a minimum of two pairs of running shoes. Though this is a trick question because you can’t have too many.\n\nBut if you’re running at least 4 days a week a minimum of 2 pairs, allowing you to follow the tips below about rotating running shoes.\n\nIf you’re only running 1-2 days per week as cross training, then a single pair may be just fine. Ensure you are wearing different shoes for your other activities (checkout running vs walking shoes).\n\nRunning on a lot of different terrain then you might need trail shoes and two road shoes.\n\nWorking on speed, you might have a pair of carbon plate shoes just for speed and race day, plus two other everyday trainers.\n\nYou’ll find in my closet at least 9 different styles (yes, totally different shoes, not just stocking up on models I like). Of course, part of my job is shoe testing, but I’m not abnormal among long time runners.\n\nMost of this is about injury prevention, which we’ll touch on. But it’s also about having a good shoe ready for race day based on how long they last.\n\nWhat Should My Running Shoe Rotation Be?\n\nMy first advice is not to worry about having a big shoe rotation on day one. Part of growing your rotation is going to be finding the shoes that feel the best to you.\n\nThere are in fact studies showing that you perform better in shoes that FEEL the best to you, regardless of all the other shoe features. So don’t feel like you must buy the stability shoe that the running store recommends when it doesn’t feel good.\n\nHere are the shoes we want to ensure are in your rotation:\n\nDaily Trainer – Likely 2+ pairs\n\nThis may be the only type of shoe you have and you may simply have two different models. That’s perfectly fine! The goal is to have two different types of shoes with slightly different feel or heel-to -toe drop, so your feet have to work a little differently.\n\nA few of my personal recommendations:\n\nNew Balance 1080 V13 – pretty soft\n\nSaucony Triumph 21 – pretty soft\n\nOn Cloudmonster – a little more firm than the above, but that’s better for many\n\nNike Pegasus 40 – not as soft, but a true favorite of so many\n\nIf you are running back to back days, then you want to rotate shoes each day.\n\nSpeed Workout Shoes – 1+ pairs\n\nFor many, many years of my running this was not a shoe in my rotation. So it’s absolutely not a must have!\n\nBut once I started focusing more on speed workouts and really wanting to go after PR’s in shorter distances, I wanted pairs that I could slip on for these workouts. Part of this is a mental shift telling my brain and body that today is a let’s go day!\n\nHOKA Mach 5 – lightweight, but still good cushion\n\nSaucony Kinvara 14 – technically this goes for a great daily trainer too\n\nCheckout these best lightweight running shoes, which are generally designed thinking about speed\n\nRace Day Shoes\n\nRace day shoes can depend on your goal and what you’re currently training for.\n\nYou may simply want to use a newer model of the daily trainer that you’ve used throughout training. This is what I did for decades and set plenty of PR’s. The plan is just to ensure you get a new pair about a month before race day, so they are broken in, but not broken down.\n\nWhen you’re ready to step things up a notch then we’re starting to look at adding a carbon plate running shoe.\n\nOn Cloudboom Echo 3 – winning shoe of the London marathon\n\nNike Alphafly – more stable than the Vaporfly\n\nOR any of the speed workout shoes might also be what you decide to go with\n\nJust remember you need to have tested out these shoes on a run of at least 10 miles for a half or 15 miles for a full to make sure you don’t have any blisters or hot spots.\n\nTrail Running Shoes\n\nThe last piece of your running shoe rotation are those designed specifically for the types of trails that you’ll be exploring. A light crushed gravel path around town, might be just fine with your daily road running shoes.\n\nBut if you’ll be hitting more single track trails, dealing with rocks or uneven terrain then it’s really beneficial to get a trail running shoe. This is going to help protect your toes with a rockplate and often keep your feet dry from streams, etc.\n\nShould We Rotate the Same Shoe or Different Types?\n\nBoth shoe rotations have value. Let’s talk about which is most necessary for you.\n\nIf you have a model you swear by and you’ve been injury free a long time, then yes you can simply rotate two pairs of the same running shoe model.\n\nIf you have had some injuries, I’d recommend you rotate different styles of running shoes.\n\nSee below for the benefits of rotating different models.\n\nHow Often Should You Change Running Shoes?\n\nIt’s been said the average lifespan of a running shoe is roughly 500 miles. This is going to vary depending on:\n\nhow heavy you land\n\nthe surfaces you run on (treadmill shoes last longer)\n\nthe frequency of your runs\n\nwhether or not you rotate your shoes\n\nread more on when to replace running shoes\n\nTwo pairs of shoes is great, but I’m telling you that the best marathon running shoes are ones you’ve worn for maybe a month or two, while rotating with another pair.\n\nWhat is the Best Running Shoe?\n\nI’m throwing this question in because it’s asked so often.\n\nI believe the particular running shoe you need is very dependent on your running form, foot strike, surface and personal preference. If forced I would say these are the best marathon running shoes.\n\nPersonally, right now I’m on my upteenth model of the Saucony Kinvara, the NB 1080 and running a lot of easy miles in the Saucony Triumph as well. But when it comes to speed work and race day, right now I’m rotating through the Nike Vaporfly and the Adidas Adizero Pro.\n\nThese are changes over what felt good even a few years ago when I was skeptical of the Triumph and putting a lot more miles in on the HOKA Clifton.\n\nWhy Do They Change Running Shoe Models Every Year?\n\nNothing frustrates a runner more than find out their favorite running shoe has been released in a new model. Why? Well we know what we like and we aren’t positive we’ll like whatever they did!\n\nBut shoes will continue to adapt for a variety of reasons.\n\nNew technology that could make the shoe lighter or more durable\n\nUpdates based on feedback from many runners\n\nUpdates to current materials and colors that are popular\n\nBecause if nothing changes it’s a lot harder to get your attention or media attention to keep sales rolling\n\nWhy It’s Good to Rotate Running Shoes\n\nAH ha, let’s talk more about how rotating your shoes makes them last longer and why it’s actually really important for injury prevention.\n\nI know I talk A LOT about tips to prevent common running injuries, but it’s the worst thing to happen besides having your favorite running shoe model suddenly change.\n\n1. Eliminate Potential Muscle Imbalances\n\nIf your body is used to running in the exact same shoe all the time, but it’s not the perfect shoe for you (often it’s not) then it will compensate for muscle imbalances.\n\nFor example, if you’re in a stability shoe because your foot is overpronating, but the actual issue is your weak hip muscles everything is about to get worse. For awhile the shoe will prop up your foot. You’ll think things are fine, while your hip gets weaker and eventually you’ve got pain from hip to foot.\n\nThis study showed those rotating running shoes through at least 2 models were 39% less likely to get injured.\n\nAnd here Saucony goes in to a more detailed explanation:\n\n“Our bodies are best at doing one thing: Adapting to the environment and the stresses we expose them to. For runners this means that our bodies adapt to the stress of running, becoming fit and strong.\n\nBut… because running is so repetitive, it can occasionally overstress our bodies, especially when we increase training intensity.\n\nEvery step loads the same tissues in the same way as the previous step. Running shoes can affect how the stress of running is distributed within the tissues of your body.\n\nBy wearing different shoes on different days, you may avoid overloading any one muscle, tendon, bone, or ligament while simultaneously strengthening others.”\n\n2. Enjoy More Cushioned Running Shoes\n\nWhen I worked onsite at New Balance creating their wear test program, the shoe engineers (yup it’s a massive job) told me that cushioned shoes can need up to 24 hours to fully bounce back to proper form to support your foot.\n\nGiving them time to return to their full cushion makes them feel better, prevents injury and prolongs use. Bonus points because it’s wonderful when your shoe just feels softer too!\n\nIf you love cushion like I do, checkout my review of the Hoka Bondi, the most cushioned shoe I’ve ever tried.\n\nRemember that more cushion isn’t always better. But I do love cushion for my recovery days and often for long runs.\n\nWhile you can add in some insoles that provide cushion, this doesn’t mean you’ve corrected the actual break down of the shoe.\n\nAs the functional breakdown occurs, it will actually change the way your foot lands, which changes your stride.\n\n3. Different Shoes are for Different Runs\n\nI think different shoes are meant for different types of runs and I’m not alone. This is a key reason we rotate running shoes.\n\nDifferent running shoes affect running kinetics and kinematics at or before heel strike, but not at mid-stance — University of Cape Town research\n\nWhile I love my minimal shoes (those with a lower heel to toe drop and less cushion), I learned the hard way that over 18 miles my knees and feet weren’t so pleased. For anything up to the half marathon they’re a great way to stay focused on connecting to the ground.\n\nThe more cushioned new style of daily trainers made me feel comfortable in longer runs by reducing the overall pounding.\n\nBut again, on super long runs if you start to shuffle rather than pick up your feet, beware these can lead to trips! However, they are often the preferred shoe of many ultrarunners, so maybe I’m just clumsy!\n\nRead more about choosing maximal or minimal shoes>>\n\nOf course, you’ve also go options for a stability or other foot corrections, which I’m going to detail below.\n\nI think these can be helpful to wear as part of your rotation, especially when coming back from an injury and working on your muscle imbalances.\n\nIn fact, I’m testing out the best insoles for runners, to help provide my knee more support as my legs build back up post surgery.\n\nTypes of Running Shoes?\n\nConfused by what are the different types of running shoes. Have no fear, I am hear to give you a quick and easy breakdown, along with a recommendation from shoes that I have tested over the years or heard from other runners really met their needs.\n\nNeutral running shoe:\n\nShoes that are designed for the average runner who has no issues with their gate. I recommend most runners opt for these and work on correcting muscle imbalances instead of the shoe doing the work for them.\n\n✅Example: On Cloudmonster – the shoe I mention above as one of my favorites for fit, comfort and cushion.\n\nStability running shoe:\n\nFor runners that want help to correct a foot that rolls inward, often due to weak hips, but could also be caused by flat feet or low arches.\n\n✅Example: New Balance 860 also provides a great cushion and yup I’m a fan of some good cushion.\n\nMotion control running shoe:\n\nFor runners who have moderate or severe overpronation. These running shoes have stiffer heels and medial supports, this is basically the next step from a stability shoe.\n\n✅Example: Asics Gel Kayano is on to model 29 because the shoe is a long time favorite that they have a continued to tweak.\n\nMinimal running shoe:\n\nShoes that have a smaller heel to toe number, usually between 4-8mm.\n\n✅Example: The Saucony Kinvara is a long time favorite of mine and shoe you will often see me wear. It lasts, it’s minimal but with a light amount of cushion. And yes, I totally will buy the older model to save money and love it just as much as a new version.\n\nMaximal running shoe:\n\nShoes that have a larger built up sole, which is designed to provide a lot of cushion. To the surprise of many they are also a low heel to toe ratio, which is often a feature of a minimal shoe.\n\nSo they’re great for both cushion and being ideal for eliminating issues of a high heel, like heel striking.\n\n✅Example: Hoka Bondi is my current favorite for a great feeling of cushion the day after a long run where my legs feel a bit more tired.\n\nBarefoot running shoe:\n\nShoes that put very little between you and the ground, usually having a separation for each toe. Personally, I don’t love these for most runners because I’ve seen a high rate of injuries when people switch to these.\n\nZero drop running shoe:\n\nA step up from barefoot, you could actually enjoy some cushion, but the shoe will have no difference from he heel to the toe making it similar in style to the benefits of barefoot running.\n\n✅Example: Altra Running Shoes have cornered this market and do an incredible job.\n\nTrail running shoe:\n\nSeems obvious, but trail running shoes are designed to provide you with more traction and grip. They work not only on the trails, but to get you running in the snow all winter with a little more stability. I have done a lot of trail running in road shoes and for sure, I wish I’d simply made the switch sooner.\n\n✅Example: Brooks Cascadia is a style I’ve used\n\nBeyond the actual names and types due to differences, there are just the types of shoes you use for different workouts.\n\nHere is a good article on the different uses and example shoes:\n\n“LONG RUN shoes need to support you when you fatigue, and when your running form deteriorates over the run (this is normal!). Long Run shoes are your heavier shoes and give more support and cushioning than your FAST RUN shoes.\n\nFAST RUN shoes are designed to go fast. They are lighter, have less bells and whistles, and are much more flexible to allow the foot to move fast through the heel to toe transition.”\n\nThen of course you have trail runs, which is a whole different ballgame and obviously requires a different shoe!\n\nYour trail run shoes need to help protect your feet from rocks, provide traction and often be waterproof.\n\n4. Feed the Fun\n\nFine this is probably not the best reason ever, but I LOVE running shoes.I love the colors matching my shorts. I love that some pairs make me feel crazy fast and others feel like a warm blanket allowing me to get comfy to run for hours.\n\nAnd I really love that getting a new pair makes me want to immediately go for a run.\n\nBasically if a new pair of shoes or having different shoes gives you a mental boost then why not?\n\nI absolutely have certain shoes that I put on and just know they are my SPEED shoes or my RACE shoes. Mental games are a big part of running well and I like all the tricks\n\nNeed an excuse to buy new #running shoes?? Read this! #injuryprevention Share on X\n\n5. Run Stronger\n\nYou might not be in a place to go on a super long run with a minimal shoe, but really want to try it for some speed work.\n\nUsing a minimal or zero drop shoe allows you to build strength in those smaller feet, ankle and calf muscles that are challenged in a lighter shoe.\n\nWhile a stability shoe might help on an easy day to reteach you how to maintain good foot position. Not using them for some runs gives you a chance to build up the hip strength to move to a neutral shoe all the time.\n\nRotating shoes means that your body does not adapt to one style and therefore get lazy, which leads to muscles turning off.\n\nOur goal is not to let any muscle get lazy because the shoe is doing the work for it.\n\n6. Running Only Shoes\n\nYes having two pairs of running shoes means double the cost. But not really. You were going to need that second pair eventually. You’re just doubling up now, instead of later.\n\nSOOO to extend the life of either your 1 pair or both pairs make sure they are used for running ONLY.\n\nThat’s right, walking or other cross training in your shoes can change your foot pattern in the shoe. This increases the speed of their retirement party.\n\nProlong the life of your running by not wearing them for all your daily activities. It’s so easy to grab them on the way out the door. But if you want that pricey pair to last you’ve got to stop.\n\nI started keeping a couple pairs of running shoes that are retired from mileage, but still feel really good by the front door. Now I grab them instead of my current trainers for a walk. Of course, eventually they all make their way back to the running store for recycling!\n\nLooking for more running shoe info?\n\nHow to pick the perfect running shoe\n\nHow to make sure running shoes fit properly\n\nHow to clean running shoes (hint it’s not in the washer)\n\nHoka Vs Asics\n\nNike Vs New Balance\n\nOther ways to connect with Amanda\n\nInstagram Daily Fun: RunToTheFinish\n\nFacebook Community Chatter: RunToTheFinish"
