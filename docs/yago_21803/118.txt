Sneak Peek "Gainsbourg: Heroic Life"", the 2010 French-language feature directed by Joann Sfar, following the life of singer/songwriter/film director 'Serge Gainsbourg' (Eric Elmosnino), from his childhood in occupied France, to his rise as an international pop star.

His varied style and individuality made Gainsbourg's songs difficult to categorize, although he is regarded as one of the world's most influential pop musicians.

In 1969, Gainsbourg released the song "Je t'aime... moi non plus", featuring explicit lyrics accompanied by the simulated sounds of a female orgasm.

"Je t'aime" was released with Gainsbourg's future girlfriend Jane Birkin.

The song also appeared on the LP "Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg".

While Gainsbourg declared the composition the "ultimate love song" "Je T'aime" was censored in various countries, with the Vatican declaring at the time, that the song was 'offensive'.

Despite the controversy, the song charted in the top ten across Europe, with Gainsbourg following up by writing soundtracks for more than 40 films as well as directing the films "Je t'aime... moi non plus", "Ã‰quateur" and "Charlotte For Ever".
