An exceptional collection - "The Cinema of Serge Gainsbourg Version 2015", revised and expanded 5 CD collection featuring 6 hours of music showcasing the output of Gainsbourg for used in films.

Between his first venture, L'Eau à la Bouche (A Game for Six Lovers) and Stan the Flasher, composed a year before he died, Gainsbourg never stopped writing for the screen. Was it just an opportunity to get away from the song format? Not really. As a matter of fact, when Gainsbourg was composing for films, the spectre of song was never far away. Actually, film directors sought him out mainly because of what he represented in popular music: they often had a theme-tune in mind, with Gainsbourg as the performer, and to this we owe a few jewels expressly set in the crown of films, like L'Eau à la Bouche, L'Herbe Tendre, Requiem pour un Con, Slogan, Cannabis, Sex-Shop, Dieu Fumeur de Havanes..

This set is complete, precise in its detail, and offers a broad panorama of Gainsbourg's relationship to films through the music he wrote for them.

This deluxe edition features a 44 page booklet as well as text and interviews with Jane Birkin, Bertrand Blier, Georges Lautner and Pierre Granier-Deferre,
