        "text": "Looking back on their lives together in a series of soft-spoken, extremely personal mother-daughter conversations, these two celebrated women touch on Birkin’s extraordinary lives with her three partners – British composer John Barry, French singer/songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, and French filmmaker Jacques Doillon.\n\nThis spare, delicate portrait of a fascinating, now 76-year-old mother by a daughter who clearly cherishes her, emerges as a frank portrayal of two very human, insecure, talented women, as they take stock of both the joys and the tragedies they have shared over the years. Official selection Cannes Film Festival 2021.\n\n***************\n\nSpecial Offer\n\nBUY 4 FRENCH FILM FESTIVAL FILMS - AND GET A 5TH FOR FREE\n\n- Automatically calculated at checkout.\n\nClick on the French Film Festival logo below to view all FFF films.\n\n***************"
