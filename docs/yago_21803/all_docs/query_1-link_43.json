        "text": "Universal will make their first local-language French film which is to be based on the life of Gaul's iconic singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who died in 1991, according to Variety.\n\nSerge Gainsbourg (vie héroïque) will mark graphic novelist Joann Sfar's debut as a director.\n\nEric Elmosnino has been tapped to play the chanteur who was as famous for his glamorous lovers, including Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin, as he was for penning such hits as \"Je t'aime ... moi non plus.\"\n\nFrench model Laetitia Casta will play Bardot, with Mylene Jampanoi set to play Gainsbourg's last paramour, Bambou, and Anna Mouglalis tapped to play French singer Juliette Greco, who collaborated with Gainsbourg for many years.\n\nThe film will trace Gainsbourg from his youth growing up in 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris, when he was called Lucien Ginsberg, through to his transformation into the hard-living showman. He died in 1991 at age 62.\n\nThe film starts lensing Jan. 19 in Paris for 13 weeks. Universal Pictures Intl. Studio is co-producing with Studio 37, the production banner of French telco giant Orange.\n\nOne World Films' Marc du Pontavice and Didier Lupfer are producing, with Sfar also penning the screenplay.\n\n\"Joann Sfar's cutting-edge creativity and unique take on the character of Serge Gainsbourg is what really drew us to this project,\" said Universal Pictures Intl. Studio president Christian Grass.\n\nUniversal will retain French theatrical and homevideo rights to the pic, which will be released in France in 2010.\n\nmovieweb.com\n\n---\n\nI thought it'd be perfect time to start a thread on this since marjanthelion brought us the first pictures of the film this week and there are many fans around here who might like to discuss this one.\n\nYeah, I'd also be interested to know if Charlotte or Jane are involved in this in some way, if only as guidance.\n\nThis reminds me of the Jeff Buckley dilemma, and the fact that everyone dreads Jeff's mom for wanting to take his life to the big screen but, I actually think the woman had a point when she said that they will make a film about Buckley sooner or later so she would rather do it herself once and for all instead of letting all of his legacy there, for some stranger to come, arrange the pieces according to his own perspective and take it from there.. everyone talks now about Mary (Jeff's mother) being incredibly greedy but I probably would've done the same. It's virtually impossible to capture an entire life on film but for me, as long as you capture the aura the artist had, his approach to life, transmit what he brought to the world of music, and expose him in a dignified manner to new generations that would've never even cared otherwise, then I feel like the film's mission has been accomplished more or less.\n\nthis will be an interesting one for sure. the cast's resemblance is shocking indeed. they made a good job with that so far, and most of them are respectable actors, too. Has Laetitia Casta done acting before, though? that's the only choice I find a bit strange, she surely exudes some of the sensuality Bardot did, but her acting skills are still a mystery for me."
