        "text": "A 1969 soundtrack by Serge Gainsbourg, which had been presumed lost for 45 years, has been discovered in an old suitcase.\n\nThe score for the André Cayatte film Les Chemins de Katmandou was written by Gainsbourg and Jean-Claude Vannier and was thought to have been lost forever, reports Fact. That was until the daughter of Vannier’s former copyist unearthed the dusty master tapes in an old suitcase earlier this year.\n\nA remastered partial version of the soundtrack will now feature in Le Cinema De Serge Gainsbourg, a five-CD box set of the French songwriter and composer’s film work, spanning 1959 to 1990, which is due for release later this year via EmArcy/Mercury/Universal France.\n\nLes Chemins de Katmandou, titled The Pleasure Pit in the U.K. and U.S., was a 1969 French-Italian crime drama that starred both Gainsbourg and his partner Jane Birkin.\n\nGainsbourg, who fathered the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, died in 1991, aged 62."
