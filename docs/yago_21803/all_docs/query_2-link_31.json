        "text": "‘Arthur the King’, the film about the dog who joins Mikael Lindnord’s team on an adventure race in Ecuador, premieres this March.\n\nThe movie ‘Arthur the King’ premieres this March 22 in Ecuador, but the film leaves a “bad taste” in the country even before.\n\nThe trailer is already being shown in theaters and, to the surprise of many, it is evident that the film says that the story occurred in the Dominican Republic and not in Ecuador.\n\nOthers already knew it, since the trailer was released months ago, but the doubt revives: why doesn’t the film about ‘Arthur’ mention Ecuador?\n\nExternal decisions\n\nPrimicias consulted Gabriel Carrión, general manager of Lord Guau, representative of the ‘Arthur’ brand in Ecuador, about the filming of ‘Arthur the King’.\n\nCarrión commented that three years ago, Mikael returned to Ecuador to give lectures about his book ‘Arthur – The Dog Who Crossed the Jungle to Find a Home’, on which the film is based.\n\nThen he arrived accompanied by staff from the film’s production company, to review scenery and analyze the possibility of filming in Ecuador.\n\n” The conditions were not the best and the decision of where to film the film corresponds to Lionsgate (production company),” he says.\n\nCarrión adds that “Mikael is also concerned and above all looking for Ecuador to be mentioned in the credits.”\n\nHe insists that the athlete has always highlighted that ‘Arthur’ is Ecuadorian and that the story occurred in Ecuador.\n\n” We have proposed that a video be included at the end of the film, before the credits, thanking Ecuador and explaining that the true story was Ecuador,” he mentioned.\n\nThe little dog ‘Arthur’\n\nThe Ecuadorian dog ‘Arthur’, who died in December 2020 in Sweden, is played by several dogs, details Carrión."
