        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Composer , Actor , Screenwriter more\n\nBirth name Lucien Ginsburg\n\nNationality French\n\nBirth April 2, 1928 (Paris, France)\n\nDeath March 2, 1991\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nIt was after seeing his face on the cover of his first record, Le poinçonneur des lilas , that Jacques Poitrenaud , assistant to director Michel Boisrond , whispered the name of Serge Gainsbourg to play the role of a master- singer in Will You Dance With Me? , the musician’s first appearance on screen in 1959. With Jane Birkin , whom he met on the set of Slogan in 1968, he played in films like The Roads of Katmandou or Serious as Pleasure . A fan of deceitful roles, he appeared in some 60s peplums and in films for which he composed the music, such as Le Pacha , and I love you by Claude Berri .\n\nIn 1975, he moved on to direct with Je t’aime, moi non plus , a daring love story between an androgynous woman (Birkin) and a homosexual ( Dallesandro ) in a public dump. The film disconcerted critics and the public, but acquired the status of a cult work over the years. A failed painter, Gainsbourg makes cinema as an esthete, as evidenced by the very elaborate long shots of Equateur , his second film, presented – and whistled at – at Cannes in 1983. He will not have more success with the troubled Charlotte for ever in 1986. In Stan the Flasher , the fourth and final film, he made Claude Berri, who plays an exhibitionist confronted with a Lolita played by the young Elodie Bouchez , say aphorisms .\n\n“It’s the accomplishment of all the disciplines that I have tackled ,” Gainsbourg declared to the magazine Positif about cinema, an art that he also approached a lot as a composer. From 1959, and L’Eau a la bouche , he continued to be sought after by filmmakers. He notably wrote the music of Les Bronzés (with the hit Sea, sex and sun ), Tenue de soir , and Madame Claude . Let us add that Serge Gainsbourg will have a number of French actresses sing, from Brigitte Bardot to Isabelle Adjani via Catherine Deneuve , Jane Birkin, Valérie Lagrange and Mireille Darc ."
