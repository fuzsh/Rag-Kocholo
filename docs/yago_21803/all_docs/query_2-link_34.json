        "text": "Description\n\nIn her opulent home in the Ecuadorian countryside, Luisa (Anahi Hoeneisen) sinks further and further into a forlorn state brought on by a bout with postpartum depression. Luisa strives to return to her notion of normalcy, taking long solitary jogs and socializing at luxurious dinner parties over a glass of wine. But dysphoric tendencies begin to take hold and create a fissure between herself and the life she once knew. In Lo Invisible, director Javier Andrade captures Hoeneisen’s magnetic performance as Luisa, articulating the new mother’s turbulent dissolution with a striking degree of restraint, while allowing a keen focus on nonverbal dialogue and quietly composed moments to speak volumes on the complexity of a frequently misunderstood and unseen crisis.\n\nFilm Details"
