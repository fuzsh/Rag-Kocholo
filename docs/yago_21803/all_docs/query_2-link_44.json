        "text": "North American Premiere\n\nIván Vallejo and Sebastián Cordero are Ecuadorian climbers and filmmakers, respectively. Together they begin a documentary of Vallejo’s ascent to the top of Mt. Everest, but as they climb higher, their vision of the film differs radically, and dangerously.\n\nIn 1999, Iván Vallejo became the first Ecuadorian mountain climber to summit Mount Everest twice without supplemental oxygen. That same year filmmaker Sebastián Cordero premiered his first film at Venice Film Festival. Two decades later they begin a collaboration to document the ascent of a career along a perilous and at times transcendental journey of self-discovery."
