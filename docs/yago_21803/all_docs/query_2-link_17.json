        "text": "Gilbert Dufour is a young Swiss man who immigrated to Ecuador. He appeared to be professionally successful and lead a harmonious family life. But in May 2006 his life was completely disrupted when the police in Quito accused him of the murder of his wife, Mirka, who had disappeared the week before. This is the story of a journey into hell. Moved from one prison to another and paraded before the media, he steadfastly maintains his innocence. Finally, declared innocent, he was released and now lives with his three children in Switzerland. One year thereafter, people are beginning to talk."
