        "text": "Charlotte Gainsbourg has directed her own video for “Lying With You”, taken from her recent album Rest.\n\n“Lying With You” was filmed in the home of her father Serge Gainsbourg, which has been kept intact since the musician’s death. The video sees Gainsbourg both as a child and adult move between old heirlooms, curios, instruments, and more esoteric objects. The song’s lyrics reimagine her father’s death and imagine herself as a 19-year-old finding her body.\n\nWhen she announced Rest, the multi-hyphenate artist revealed that Lars Von Trier encouraged her to direct her own videos. “I needed a push and Lars (Von Trier) was there to help,” she said in a statement."
