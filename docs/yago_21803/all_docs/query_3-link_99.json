        "text": "Serge Gainsbourg is undeniably one of the most well-known and revered French singers of all time, but he wasn’t just known for his talent as a lyricist – he was also famed for his ability to seduce and captivate women throughout his life. From his short yet passionate involvement with Brigitte Bardot to his iconic twelve-year romance with Jane Birkin, we’re revisiting the women who touched the dandy’s life and influenced his five-decade-long reign in the French music scene.\n\nFrançoise Pancrazzi\n\nAfter his first marriage to Elisabeth Levitsky ended in 1957, Serge Gainsbourg had a highly publicized and passionate relationship with Françoise Antoinette Pancrazzi, who was the daughter of a wealthy businessman who could support their luxurious habits. They married on January 7, 1964, and they had two children together, Natacha and Paul. The relationship ended in divorce in 1966.\n\nBrigitte Bardot\n\nBrigitte Bardot, the ultimate sex symbol of the 60s, also succumbed to the charming Gainsbourg’s advances. The celebrity couple of their time, their relationship was short-lived but intense. In October 1967, the two singers joined forces in the record studio to record their now-legendary song, Harley Davidson. Their secret relationship only lasted for three months, as Bardot was married to millionaire Gunter Sach at the time, who, upon discovering her indiscretion, quickly divorced Bardot. A tragic but influential moment for Gainsbourg’s career.\n\nJane Birkin\n\nPerhaps the most iconic couple of all, Serge Gainsbourg met Jane Birkin in the 60s whilst filming for the Pierre Grimblat film Slogan. Birkin was 22 and Gainsbourg 40, but that didn’t faze the couple, and they embarked on their relationship. However, this time it was Gainsbourg who was not single, as he was seeing American actress Marisa Berenson at the time. This didn’t stop Gainsbourg, though, and the duo went on to be together for twelve years, during which Birkin gave birth to their daughter, Charlotte, in 1971.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg was born on July 21, 1971 in London. Charlotte, daughter to Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is a successful French actress and singer, starring most notably in The Impudent Girl by Claude Miller for which she won the César Award for Most Promising Actress. The most influential muse to her father, the pair sang the song Lemon Incest together in 1984. The song discussed the love between a father and daughter, and shocked audiences with its on-the-line lyrics hinting at sexual relations.\n\nBambou\n\nAfter breaking up with Jane Birkin, Serge Gainsbourg returned to his greatest vice: alcohol. He plunged himself into a libertine and bohemian lifestyle, and after a stream of drunken nights at debaucherous Parisian clubs, he fell in love with Caroline von Paulus – also known by her nickname Bambou. The 30-year old called Gainsbourg by a nickname too – Gainsbarre. Bambou is also the mother of Gainsbourg’s fourth child, Lucien, born January 5 1986.\n\nFrance Gall\n\nIn the fall of 1964, France Gall graced the cover of Mademoiselle âge tendre and Gainsbourg was immediately struck by her beauty. He decided to write a song for the child star called Poupée de cire, poupée de son, and France Gall went on to win the Eurovision song contest in 1965 with the song. He wrote her a follow-up song called Les sucettes à l’anis, however the juvenile France Gall did not understand the erotic undertones of the lyrics.\n\nCatherine Deneuve\n\nAt the dawn of the 80s, Serge Gainsbourg came out of the slump he had been in since his relationship with Jane Birkin ended. He met Catherine Deneuve, and wrote for her the iconic song Dieu est un fumeur de havane before going on to pen her entire album. A true friendship was forged between two French icons.\n\nVanessa Paradis\n\nSerge Gainsbourg played an incredibly influential role in Vanessa Paradis’ career. Gainsbourg wrote two of the for songstress’ most emblematic singles – Tandem et Dis-lui toi que je t’aime, as well as almost all of her second album Variations sur le même t'aime. They were a huge factor in Paradis’ success in her musical career, and earned her the Victoire de la musique award in the female singer category in 1990."
