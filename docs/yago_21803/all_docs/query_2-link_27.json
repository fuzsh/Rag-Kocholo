        "text": "Alba is eleven years old. One afternoon, her mother is admitted in the hospital and she has to move to live with Igor, a father she barely knows. Igor’s attempts to get closer to Alba, school girls, her first kiss…all are stimulus that pave her way into adolescence and to accept her family.\n\nAlba is a coming-of-age film that is both heart-rending and unsentimental. It’s striking that such a mature and powerful debut comes from Ecuador, the country that until the beginning of this century had only made one film a year. Young leading actress Macarena Arias is one to keep an eye on. She manages to use a minimum of dialogue to devastating effect.\n\n“I search for a narrative that evokes strong feelings by telling few things, by showing just the tip of unseen things, suggesting that they’re very deep. I’m interested in films that go beyond a story, those that leave a scent behind, a particular and long lasting taste. I want to avoid cold narratives and work instinctively, to explore the contrast between tenderness and pain of a girl’s process of becoming an adult. Sickness, blood, underarm hair; the discovery and blossom of a strange and even rough femininity. I want to find beauty in clumsy bodies, in the shame Alba feels towards her father, in three lonely characters that barely talk and live surrounded by noise.” – Ana Cristina Barragán, director"
