        "text": "Many tried. But Joann Sfar was the first to receive the blessing of Serge Gainsbourg's family to create a portrait of the French pop rogue.\n\nThe trepidation is understandable. Gainsbourg -- a cult figure in America but a star in his native France -- is one of pop's most scandalous characters.\n\nThe singer-songwriter bedded a host of sex kittens, including Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin. He also wrote and performed kinky duets with them, with none kinkier than \"Je t'aime . . . moi non plus.\"\n\nIt's an ode to sex that comes complete with moaning, groaning and graphic come-ons that helped define Gainsbourg's image as a provocateur -- well, to those who didn't see him as a pervert.\n\nBut there was more to the man than a determined ladies' man, as \"A Heroic Figure\" hints at.\n\nTherein lies the problem, because \"A Heroic Figure\" settles for hints instead of digging deep into the enigma that is Gainsbourg.\n\nSfar adapted the film from his graphic novel on Gainsbourg. You can tell, from the episodic narrative to the fairy-tale, otherworldly treatment of his life.\n\nWhich is commendable. After all, the easy way to recount a life is to do the \"straight\" biopic.\n\nBut could anything be straight in the case of Gainsbourg, a man whose dashing image was countered by a childhood as a Jew hiding from the Nazis?\n\nSfar opens with the little boy getting his yellow star, the marking Jews were forced to wear under the Nazis.\n\nYoung Gainsbourg arrives early to get his; he even acts as if it's some sheriff's badge in the Old West, to the authorities' chagrin. Already, he was a provocateur with an anti-authority streak.\n\nAll too quickly, Sfar drops the storyline, instead opting to insert an alter-ego into the narrative. He is a puppet that plays on Jewish caricature -- Gainsbourg's \"mug\" -- and acts like some sort of demonic muse, spurring him on to write songs and bed women.\n\nUnfortunately, that's what we're left with for most of \"A Heroic Life.\" The film focuses on the songs as a vehicle to pick up ladies, with the puppet along for the ride.\n\nOstensibly, the alter-ego puppet acts as some psychological portal into Gainsbourg's Jewishness, his self-esteem issues regarding his looks, and his desire to paint.\n\nUnfortunately, the views are surface at best, and the puppet gets way too much face time.\n\nWe do know that Gainsbourg was derided as a drinking, smoking lush. But we never find out whether musical odes to debauchery were merely reflections of a hedonistic lifestyle or something more rebellious.\n\nWe know he was a Jewish kid suddenly dropped into French high society. But we never get a deeper glimpse into the psychology of this complicated man.\n\nWe have an entertaining fable -- well-intentioned and well-acted, especially by Gainsbourg lookalike Eric Elmosnino. But we never get the in-depth life story, the kind we received with another film about a French star, \"La Vie En Rose,\" about singer Edith Piaf.\n\nIn other words, too much comic strip and not enough film. And way too much of that puppet. More man, less puppet."
