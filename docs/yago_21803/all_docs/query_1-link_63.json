        "text": "FIAF honors the career of celebrated actress, musician, and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg with a CinéSalon series devoted to her work on screen.\n\nKnown for her bold choices and unfailingly independent spirit, Gainsbourg has become a muse for renowned directors from Lars von Trier to Yvan Attal. The daughter of two European stars—Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg—the younger Gainsbourg was recognized as a supreme talent by her early teens. She won the César Award for Most Promising Actress at 14 years old for her performance in L’effrontée, and has been a consistently brilliant presence in cinema on both sides of the Atlantic since. Over the course of her career, Gainsbourg has crafted a mesmerizing screen presence with raw and emotional intensity which is captured through the films in this series."
