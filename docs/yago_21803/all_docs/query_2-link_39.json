A goal is being introduced to establish a fair economy (sharp tongues might say it´s a propaganda movie). The introduced ideas are almost too good to be true.\n\nThen, we are informed about the offer Ecuador made to the EU to not destroy the rain forest for the production of oil if the rich countries were willing to pay compensations for the conservation of the forest.\n\nThe quality of the pictures are good and the staging is ok.\n\nI didn´t find out what came out of these ideas but it seems that the project of conserving the rain forest has been given up, probably because nobody wanted to engage."
