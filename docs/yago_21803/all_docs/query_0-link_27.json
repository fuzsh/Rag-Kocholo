        "text": "Georges Simenon. Tropic Moon. [Le coup de lune]. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, [1943]. First U. S. edition. Octavo (8 x 5.25 inches; 202 x 133 mm.). [5], [1, blank], 218 pages. Publisher's smooth grayish-blue cloth, spine lettered in black; all edges of the text block trimmed; plain endpapers. In the original dust jacket, priced $2.00, with art by Buboni. Spine just barely leaning; backstrip very faintly dulled; spine ends gently pushed; bottom corners tapped; two minor blemishes to the front board. Text block very lightly tanned (but not at all brittle); infrequent and trivial spotty soiling to the page edges; light discoloration along the hinges from binding glue. Dust jacket spine panel faded just a shade; edges lightly worn with some very shallow chipping to the crown; two faint tidemarks along the bottom edge, one on the front panel visible only in last two letters of Simenon, the other in the middle of the rear panel (the true extent visible on the verso); label affixed to the bottom of the front flap encouraging sending this book a soldier. A near fine copy in a very good dust jacket. Translated by Stuart Gilbert. Source for the 1983 film Équateur, written and directed by Serge Gainsbourg, who was also responsible for the soundtrack (obviously). (#10042)."
