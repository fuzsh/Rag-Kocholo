        "text": "Gilbert Dufour, a young Swiss expatriated in Equator, shows all the signs of a professional and familial success. In May 2006, his life changes radically. He is accused by the police of Quito of having murdered his wife Mirka, who died a week before this blame. The film narrates the descent into hell. Dragged off to the Equatorial jails and in front of the media of the country, the man proclaims his innocence. Finally, released and exonerated, he lives nowadays in Switzerland with his three children. After Eighteen months, he spills the beans.\n\nCredits\n\nDirectorsÂ : Raymond Vouillamoz - David Rihs\n\nImage : Olivier Auverlau - Phillipe Mory\n\nSound : Leon Felipe Troya - Benedetto Garro\n\nEditor : Christine Hoffet\n\nSound editor : Pascale Schaer\n\nSound mixing : Michel Goossen\n\nVoice-over : David Rihs\n\nProduction and Partners\n\nProduction : Simple Production - Pointprod - TSR - RTBF\n\nPartners : Foundation Vaudoise for the CinÃ©ma, the City of Geneva, Funds Regio Films, Valais Cinema and with the help of the Centre du CinÃ©ma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FÃ©dÃ©ration Wallonie-Bruxelles\n\nDvd"
