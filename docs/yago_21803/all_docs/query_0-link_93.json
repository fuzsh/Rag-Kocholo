        "text": "The Josef Gugler collection consists of promotional materials for films produced in or directed by filmmakers from Africa and the Middle East. Over 500 unique films by approximately film directors are represented.\n\nThe posters in this series range from 14 x 10 inches to a 78 x 54.75-inch poster of Campo Thiaroye by Semb√®ne Ousmane. The majority, however, are a mix of sizes ranging from approximately 21 x 16 inches to approximately 62 x 47 inches. Since the posters were printed and distributed throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North America, which use slightly different sizing-systems, it is difficult to further classify them by size.\n\nApproximately half of the posters have text in French. Most of the other half are made up of posters in English and German. The remaining 55 items are in Arabic, Bambara, Croatian, Czech, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Thai, and Turkish.\n\nThe original release dates of the posters go back as early as 1947 (Ibrahim Emaras's Akhaam al-Arab, aka The Wisest Arab), but the majority were released between 1962 and 2010. The most commonly represented countries of production include France, Algeria, South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, and Turkey, but over three dozen additional countries are also represented."
