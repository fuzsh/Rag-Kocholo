        "text": "\"Society of the Snow\" is inspired by Flight 571, which had 45 people on board when it crashed in a remote part of the Andes Mountains in 1972. It debuted on Netflix this week.\n\nEveryone loves a story of grit, survival and beating the odds, and Netflix's \"Society of the Snow\" is just that.\n\nThe new film, which debuted on Netflix on Thursday, is based on doomed Flight 571, which crashed in the remote Andes Mountains on Oct. 13, 1972.\n\n\"The tale is not for the faint of heart: For those not familiar with the story, 'Society of the Snow' involves graphic depictions of the accident and what the victims had to do to keep from starving to death, including cannibalism,\" said Netflix about the film.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the film from award-winning Spanish Director J.A. Bayona,\n\nWhat they got right: Fact checking 'Society of the Snow' plane disaster with Director J.A. Bayona\n\nIs 'Society of the Snow' based on a true story?\n\n\"Society of the Snow,\" which closed out the Venice Film Festival in September, is inspired by Flight 571, which was carrying a Uruguayan rugby team and their friends and family when it crashed in a remote part of the Andes Mountains in 1972, instantly killing a dozen passengers. Several others died of their injuries soon after.\n\nSearch and rescue crews failed to find the plane and after eight days, called off their efforts. The eventually had to choose between death and cannibalism.\n\nIncredibly, two survivors, Nando Parado and Roberto Canessa, traversed mountains and glaciers and hiked nearly 40 miles without proper gear to eventually get help. In the end, 16 of the 45 people on board survived.\n\nThe new film is based on Uruguayan author and journalist Pablo Vierci's 2008 book, \"La Sociedad de la Nieve.\" While Vierci himself was not on the flight, he attended Stella Maris College in Montevideo, Uruguay, with flight survivors, who gave him firsthand accounts of their ordeal, according to Forbes.\n\nBayona told USA TODAY that the filmmakers \"tried to be as close to what happened as possible.\"\n\n\"I remember having conversations with the other writers asking them not to alter the facts to make it more appealing to the audience and instead focus more on understanding the psychology behind what they did, and show that on the screen,\" Bayona said.\n\nWhere are the Andes Mountains?\n\nThe longest mountain range in the world at about 4,500 miles, the Andes are located along the entire western coast of South America, spanning seven countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, according to LiveScience.\n\nFlight 571 crashed in a remote area on the range near the Argentine border, about 80 miles south of Santiago. The site of the crash is known as the Valley of Tears.\n\nFlight 571 survivors\n\nMore than 50 years have passed since the crash took place and all but two survivors are alive. Javier Methol and José Luis \"Coche\" Inciarte died in 2015 and 2023, respectively.\n\nCanessa and Parrado were actively involved in the film's production, supporting it at various media events. The film's production team had extensive conversations with the victims’ families and survivors.\n\n“The survivors were instrumental. Their enthusiasm fueled the film and my perspective,” Bayona told Netflix. “It was essential for the (actors) to connect with the survivors and the other families.”\n\nRoberto Canessa\n\nCanessa, who was a 19-year-old medical student at the time of the crash, according to TIME, is now in his 70s and is a renowned pediatric cardiologist.\n\nNando Parrado\n\nParrado was 22 at the time of the crash and was \"just a regular middle-class Uruguayan man waiting to start university,\" reports The Guardian.\n\nOver the years, Parrado has led a successful television production company, grown his family hardware business and even raced cars.\n\nDaniel Fernandez\n\nFernandez has largely remained in the shadows and not much is known about him.\n\n'Society of the Snow' Cast\n\nHere are the actors who play the real-life rugby players:\n\nEnzo Vogrincic Roldán as Numa Turcatti\n\nMatías Recalt as Roberto Canessa\n\nAgustín Pardella as Nando Parrado\n\nTomas Wolf as Gustavo Zerbino\n\nDiego Vegezzi as Marcelo Pérez\n\nEsteban Kukuriczka as Adolfo “Fito” Strauch\n\nFrancisco Romero as Daniel Fernández Strauch\n\nRafael Federman (The Sleepwalkers) as Eduardo Strauch\n\nFelipe González Otaño as Carlitos Páez\n\nAgustín Della Corte as Antonio “Tintín” Vizintín\n\nValentino Alonso as Alfredo “Pancho” Delgado\n\nSimón Hempe as José Luis “Coche” Inciarte\n\nFernando Contigiani García as Arturo Nogueira\n\nBenjamín Segura as Rafael “el Vasco” Echavarren\n\nRocco Posca as Ramón “Moncho” Sabella\n\n'Society of the Snow' trailer\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
