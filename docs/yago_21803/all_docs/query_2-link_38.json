        "text": "Jacques Sarasin began his career as a yachtsman from 1976-1982 and was a world champion. In 1983, he founded the Yacht Broker Company and served as its Director until 1988. In 1989, he switched gears and founded the International Foundation of Architectural Synthesis (FISA), which developed social housing in Africa and South America.\n\nIt was in 1996 when he made another career move and became a producer for Les Productions Faire Bleu and produced four films through 1999. Then he moved into directing, starting with two documentary shorts, \"European DN\" and \"Seul Autour du Monde.\" His love for documentaries and current political themes have been his passion ever since.\n\nSome of his other films include: \"Je Chanterai Pour Toi\" (\"I'll Sing For You\"), the story of Boubacar \"KarKar\" TraorÃ©, a Malian singer who sang of independence; \"On the Rumba River,\" shot in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is a musical tribute to the Congolese people through the music of Antoine Kolosoy known as \"Wendo.\"\n\nIn 2006-2009, Sarasin made two films about Nobel Prize Winner and former Chief Economist of the World Bank, Joseph Stiglitz. The first one, \"Where is the World Going Mr. Stiglitz?\" and \"Around the World with Joseph Stiglitz.\"\n\nHis latest film, \"Ecuador: Rainforest vs. Globalization\" takes a look at Ecuador and the ecological, economical, political and social mission of the country's president, Rafael Correa.\n\nPhoto Credit: Les Productions Faire Bleu Alberto Acosta is a political economist and the former Minister of Energy and Mines in Ecuador.
