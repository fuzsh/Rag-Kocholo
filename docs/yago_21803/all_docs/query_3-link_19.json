        "text": "After the success of “Piaf,” this would be inevitable: Variety reports that production will soon begin on a French-language bio-pic of Serge Gainsbourg, the brilliant, self-destructive singer-songwriter, who died in 1991. He’ll be played by Eric Elmosnino; the graphic novelist Joann Sfar will write and direct. Interesting choice; Sfar’s work, such as “Klezmer,” “The Rabbi’s Cat,” and “Black Olives,” is centered on his own Jewish heritage, and Gainsbourg, né Lucien Ginsberg, suffered persecution during the Second World War as a Jew in France under German occupation, and wrote a song about it, “Yellow Star.”\n\nHere is Gainsbourg, from 1964, in a strikingly clever film clip for a song called “New York U.S.A.” The Warholesque aspect of his writing, the blank reflection of things as they are, emerges here: the French lyrics translate to: “I’ve seen New York, New York U.S.A. I’ve never seen anything so high”—and the refrain, “Oh, c’est haut” means, “Oh, it’s high.”"
