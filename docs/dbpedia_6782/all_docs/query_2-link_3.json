If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Densely Populated Countries in Asia.\n\nPopulation Trends in Asia\n\nThe Asia and the Pacific region houses 60% of the global population, which comes up to about 4.3 billion people. It also includes the most populous countries in the world, including India and China. At the same time, Asia is also home to some of the smallest populations across the globe, especially the developing island countries in the Pacific. These two ends of the spectrum arise because of overall low mortality rates, speedy urbanization, and significant intra and inter-migrations across the region.\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the total fertility rate in Asia and the Pacific stands at around 2.1 births per woman. However, these statistics are not uniform, for fertility rates in East Asia have dropped to 1.7 births per woman, while those in South Asia have gone up to 2.5 births per woman.\n\nThe UNFPA predicts that the number of people aged 60 and above will reach about 1.3 billion in Asia by 2050, double its current rate. About one in four people would be 60 years or older by the middle of the 21st century in Asia, comparable with the present rate of one in ten people. Another report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific suggests that the overall growth rate of Asia's population is decreasing with a 0.96% growth rate per year.

Additionally, TSMC is set to start the development of its first facility in Europe by committing $3.80 billion to build a fabrication plant in Dresden, Germany.\n\nNow that we have taken a look at the major players driving Asia's economy and trends, let's get into the 20 most densely populated countries in Asia.
