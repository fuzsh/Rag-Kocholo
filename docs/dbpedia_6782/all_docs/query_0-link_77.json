The second smallest country in the world is Monaco at .78 square miles. For comparison, the largest country in the world is Russia which measures in at 6.6 MILLION square miles.

In fact, some of the smallest countries in the world have the most people. A great example of this is Singapore. The nation only boasts about 280 square miles but has an enormous population of 5,703,600 people. That’s a population density of 20,446 people every square mile!\n\nThe 10 Largest Countries in the World\n\nNow that you’ve seen the world’s smallest countries, are you curious to learn more about the largest countries in the world?
