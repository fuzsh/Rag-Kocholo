        "text": "Background\n\nThe archipelago was once largely under the control of Buddhist and Hindu rulers. By around the 7th century, a Buddhist kingdom arose on Sumatra and expanded into Java and the Malay Peninsula until it was conquered in the late 13th century by the Hindu Majapahit Empire from Java. Majapahit (1290-1527) united most of modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia. Traders introduced Islam around the 11th century, and the religion was gradually over the next 500 years. The Portuguese conquered parts of Indonesia in the 16th century, but the Dutch ousted them (except in East Timor) and began colonizing the islands in the early 17th century. It would be the early 20th century before Dutch colonial rule was established across the entirety of what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.\n\nJapan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence shortly before Japan's surrender, but it required four years of sometimes brutal fighting, intermittent negotiations, and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted \"Guided Democracy.\" After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist sympathizers, SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until 1998, President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his \"New Order\" government. After street protests toppled SUHARTO in 1998, free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999 while the country's first direct presidential election occurred in 2004. Indonesia has since become a robust democracy, holding four direct presidential elections, each considered by international observers to have been largely free and fair.Â\n\nIndonesia is now the world's third-most-populous Â democracy and the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. It has had strong economic growth since overcoming the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. By the 2020s, it had the largest economy in Southeast Asia, and its economy ranked in the world's top 10 in terms of purchasing power parity. It has also made considerable gains in reducing poverty. Although relations amongst its diverse population--there are more than 300 ethnic groups--have been harmonious in the 2000s, there have been areas of sectarian discontent and violence, as well as instances of religious extremism and terrorism. A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005, but a separatist group in Papua continued to conduct a low-intensity conflict as of 2024.\n\nGeography - note\n\nnote 1: according to Indonesia's National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping, the total number of islands in the archipelago is 13,466, of which 922 are permanently inhabited (Indonesia is the world's largest country comprised solely of islands); the country straddles the equator and occupies a strategic location astride or along major sea lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean\n\nnote 2: Indonesia is one of the countries along the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake epicenters bordering the Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's earthquakes and some 75% of the world's volcanoes occur within the Ring of Fire; 80% of tsunamis, caused by volcanic or seismic events, occur within the \"Pacific Ring of Fire\"\n\nnote 3: despite having the fourth largest population in the world, Indonesia is the most heavily forested region on earth after the Amazon\n\nnote 4: two major food crops apparently developed on the island of New Guinea: bananas and sugarcane\n\nDemographic profile\n\nIndonesia has the worldâs fourth-largest population.Â It is predominantly Muslim and has the largest Muslim population of any country in the world.Â The population is projected to increase to as much as 320 million by 2045.Â A government-supported family planning program.Â The total fertility rate (TFR) â the average number of births per woman â from 5.6 in the mid-1960s to 2.7 in the mid-1990s.Â The success of the program was also due to the social acceptance of family planning, which received backing from influential Muslim leaders and organizations.\n\nThe fertility decline slowed in the late 1990âs when responsibility for family planning programs shifted to the district level, where the programs were not prioritized.Â Since 2012 the national government revitalized the national family planning program, and Indonesiaâs TFR has slowly decreased to 2.3 in 2020. Â The government may reach its goal of achieving replacement level fertility â 2.1 children per woman â but the large number of women of childbearing age ensures significant population growth for many years.Â\n\nIndonesia is a source country for labor migrants, a transit country for asylum seekers, and a destination mainly for highly skilled migrant workers.Â International labor migration, both legal and illegal, from Indonesia to other parts of Asia (most commonly Malaysia) and the Middle East has taken place for decades because of high unemployment and underemployment, poverty, and low wages domestically.Â Increasing numbers of migrant workers are drawn to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US.Â The majority of Indonesian labor migration is temporary and consists predominantly of low-skilled workers, mainly women working as domestics.\n\nIndonesiaâs strategic location between Asia and Australia and between the Pacific and Indian Oceans â and its relatively easy accessibility via boat â appeal to asylum seekers.Â It is also an attractive transit location because of its easy entry requirements and the ability to continue on to Australia. Â Recent asylum seekers have come from Afghanistan, Burma (Rohingyas), Iraq, Somalia, and Sri Lanka.Â Since 2013, when Australia tightening its immigration policy, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been stranded in Indonesia, where they live in precarious conditions and receive only limited support from international organizations.Â The situation for refugees in Indonesia has also worsened because Australia and the US, which had resettled the majority of refugees in Indonesia, have significantly lowered their intake.\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\ndegree of risk: very high (2023)\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever\n\nvectorborne diseases: dengue fever, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases: hepatitis B (2024)\n\nnote: on 31 August 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Southeast Asia; Indonesia is currently considered a high risk to travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nTelecommunication systems\n\ngeneral assessment: Indonesia faces more than the usual number of obstacles in terms of enabling widespread access to quality telecommunications services for its population of more than 270 million; the geographical challenges have been further compounded by a variety of social, political, and economic problems over the years that have kept the countryâs wealth distributed very thinly; the fixed-line (fiber) and mobile operators have continued to expand and upgrade their networks across the country; Indonesiaâs 18,000 islands (many of which, however, are sparsely populated) makes the deployment of fixed-line infrastructure on a broad scale difficult; there has been renewed activity in fiber optic cable, but the bundling of fixed-line telephony with TV and internet services will see the countryâs teledensity stabilize; mobile subscriptions have reached more than 130% and is projected to exceed 150% by 2026; with 4G LTE universally available, the major mobile companies have been busy launching 5G services in selected areas; the rollout of 5G will be hampered by the lack of availability of suitable frequencies; the 4G had to be reallocated from broadcasting services, and indications are that the same process is going to have to be followed in order to allow the expansion of 5G into its core frequency bands (3.3 to 4.2GHz) (2022)\n\ndomestic: fixed-line subscribership roughly 3 per 100 and mobile-cellular 134 per 100 persons (2021)\n\ninternational: country code - 62; landing points for the SEA-ME-WE-3 & 5, DAMAI, JASUKA,Â BDM,Â Dumai-Melaka Cable System, IGG, JIBA,Â Link 1, 3, 4, Â & 5, PGASCOM, B3J2, Tanjung Pandam-Sungai Kakap Cable System, JAKABARE, JAYABAYA, INDIGO-West, MatrixÂ Cable System, ASC, SJJK, Jaka2LaDeMa, S-U-B Cable System, JBCS, MKCS, BALOK, Palapa Ring East, WestÂ and Middle, SMPCS Packet-1 and 2, LTCS, TSCS, SEA-US and Kamal Domestic Submarine Cable System, 35Â submarine cable networks that provide links throughout Asia, the Middle East,Â Australia, Southeast Asia, AfricaÂ and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean) (2019)\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe military is responsible for external defense, combatting separatism, and responding to natural disasters; in certain conditions it may provide operational support to police, such as for counterterrorism operations, maintaining public order, and addressing communal conflicts; the TNI has undergone reforms since the 1990s to improve its professionalism and limit its involvement in internal politics\n\nthe Army is involved in counterinsurgency operations in Papua against the West Papua Liberation Army, the military wing of the Free Papua Organization, which has been fighting a low-level insurgency since Indonesia annexed the former Dutch colony in the 1960s; the Army has also been assisting police in Sulawesi in countering the Mujahideen Indonesia Timur (MIT; aka East Indonesia Mujahideen), a local militant group affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS)\n\nthe Navy is responsible for coastal defense and patrolling Indonesiaâs territorial waters where it faces such issues as piracy, transnational crime, illegal fishing, and incursions by Chinese vessels; Indonesia is not a formal claimant in the South China Sea, although some of its waters lie within China's ânine-dash lineâ maritime claims, resulting in some stand offs in recent years; since 2016, the Indonesian military has bolstered its presence on Great Natuna Island (aka Pulau Natuna Besar), the main island of the Middle Natuna Archipelago, which is part of the Riau Islands Province, and held military exercises in the surrounding waters (2024)"
