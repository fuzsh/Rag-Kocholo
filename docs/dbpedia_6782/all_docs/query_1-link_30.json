The most densely populated countries and territories are Macau, Monaco, and Singapore, with population densities of over 8,000 people per square kilometer. On the other end of the spectrum, the least densely populated countries and territories are Mongolia, Greenland, and Western Sahara, with population densities of less than one person per square kilometer.\n\nMany of the countries with the highest population densities are located in Asia, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Taiwan, and South Korea. Some African countries like Rwanda, Burundi, and Malawi also have high population densities. In contrast, many of the countries with the lowest population densities are located in Africa, such as Namibia, Botswana, and Mauritania. Australia, Canada, and Russia also have low population densities due to their vast land areas and harsh climates.\n\nPopulation density can have significant implications for a country, including resource use, infrastructure development, and environmental impact. Countries with high population densities may struggle to provide adequate resources and services to their citizens, while countries with low population densities may face challenges in developing infrastructure and providing services over vast areas. Ultimately, understanding population density can provide valuable insight into a country’s demographics, economy, and social issues.\n\nPopulation Density by Country\n\nMost Densely Populated Countries\n\nThe ten most densely populated countries and territories are Macau, Monaco, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Maldives, Malta, Bangladesh, Sint Maarten, and Bermuda. The most densely populated territory in the world is Macau, with a population density of 21,402.71 per km². Monaco follows as the second most densely populated country, with a population density of 18,148.5 per km². Singapore ranks third, with a density of 8,377.05 per km², followed by Hong Kong at fourth place with 7,134.87 per km². Bahrain is the fifth most densely populated country, with 1,892.37 per km², and Maldives is the sixth most densely populated country with a density of 1,736.74 per km². Malta is the seventh most densely populated country with a density of 1,672.08 per km², followed by Bangladesh with 1,328.68 per km². Sint Maarten ranks ninth with a population density of 1,300.65 per km². Finally, Bermuda is the tenth most densely populated country with a population density of 1,186.46 per km².\n\nThe ten most densely populated countries and territories are:\n\n1. Macau – 21,402.71 per km²\n\n2. Monaco – 18,148.5 per km²\n\n3. Singapore – 8,377.05 per km²\n\n4. Hong Kong – 7,134.87 per km²\n\n5. Bahrain – 1,892.37 per km²\n\n6.

Despite its small size of only 32.9 km², Macau has a population of over 680,000 people, which makes it one of the most densely populated regions in the world. The territory’s high population density is due to its limited land area and the fact that it is a popular tourist destination, which attracts a large number of visitors every year.\n\nMonaco is known for being one of the most luxurious and glamorous places on earth, but it’s also the second smallest independent nation in the world and the most densely populated country in the world. With a population density of 18,148.5 people per square kilometer, Monaco’s area of just 2.1 km² is home to a population of approximately 39,000 people.
